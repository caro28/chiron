At length the temples of the gods themselves,  Changed into charnels, and their sacred shrines  Thronged with the dead: for superstition now,  The power of altars, half their sway had lost,  Whelmed in the pressure of the present woe.  Nor longer now the costly rites prevailed  Of ancient burial, erst punctilious kept:  For all roved restless, with distracted mind,  From scene to scene ; and worn with grief and toil  Gave to their friends th' interment chance allowed.  And direst exigence impelled them oft,  Headlong, to deeds most impious; for the pyres  Funereal seized they, reared not by themselves,  And with loud dirge, and wailing wild, o'er these  Placed their own dead; amid th' unhallowed blaze  With blood contending, rather than resign  The tomb thus gained, or quit th' enkindling corse.
