          </ab>
          <p>OF the life of Lucretius but little information has reached us. <lb/>
            Ad nos vix tenuis famæ perlabitur aura.</p>
          <p>That he was a Roman by birth, is inferred from the pas­ <lb/>
            sages in his poem in which he speaks of the Roman world as <lb/>
            his country,1 and of the Roman language as his native tongue.2</p>
          <p>As to the time of his birth, it is stated by Eusebius in his <lb/>
            Chronicon, that he was born in the second year of the hundred <lb/>
            and seventy-first Olympiad, or ninety-five years before Christ. <lb/>
            At this period, Ennius had been dead about seventy years ; <lb/>
            Cicero was in his twelfth year; twenty-five years were to <lb/>
            elapse before the birth of Virgil, and four before that of Julius <lb/>
            Caesar. His style, indeed, would make him seem older, but <lb/>
            its antiquated character may be partly affected, in imitation, <lb/>
            perhaps, of Ennius, for whom he expresses great veneration.3</p>
          <p>Concerning his family nothing is known. The name of <lb/>
            Lucretius, from the time of Lucretia downwards, occurs fre­ <lb/>
            quently in the history of Rome, with the surnames Tricipiti­ <lb/>
            nus, Cinna, Ofella, and others, attached to it; but with whom <lb/>
            the poet was connected, or from whom descended, it is impossi­ <lb/>
            ble to discover. There was a Lucretius Vespillo contemporary <lb/>
            with him, a senator, mentioned by Cicero and Caesar,5 of <lb/>
            whom Lambinus conjectures that he may have been the <lb/>
            brother; suggesting that the one brother, by engaging in <lb/>
            public life, might have attained senatorial dignity, while the <lb/>
            other, devoting himself to literature and retirement, might have <note type="footnote"> 1 Nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniquo, etc. i. 42. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I. 31; ii. 259. </note><note type="footnote">2 I. 118. </note><note type="footnote">4 Cic. Brut. c. 48. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> a. c. i. 18; iii 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            continued in the equestrian or even plebeian rank, in which <lb/>
            he was born. But all this is mere empty conjecture.</p>
          <p>Equally groundless is the supposition, started also by Lain­ <lb/>
            binus, that in his youth he went to Athens to study, and <lb/>
            there, under the instruction of Zeno, who was then at the head <lb/>
            of the Epicureans, became imbued with the doctrines of Epi­ <lb/>
            curus. That he attached himself to the tenets of Epicurus is <lb/>
            certain, but when or where he studied them is not now to be <lb/>
            ascertained.</p>
          <p>Dunlop, however, asserts that "Lucretius was sent, with <lb/>
            other young Romans of rank, to study at Athens.”1 Thus it <lb/>
            is that errors creep into biography and history; the learned <lb/>
            conjecture, and the less learned affirm. Lambinus suggests <lb/>
            that Lucretius might have gone to Athens, Dunlop states that <lb/>
            he did go; Lambinus says that it is probable, Dunlop says it <lb/>
            is fact.</p>
          <p>He wrote his poem, or part of it, as appears from a passage <lb/>
            near the beginning of the first book,2 at a time when the <lb/>
            Roman commonwealth was in a disturbed state; but whether <lb/>
            the disorders to which he alludes were, as is generally supposed, <lb/>
            those excited by Catiline, or, as Forbiger suggests, those which <lb/>
            were raised by Clodius eight years afterwards, there is no <lb/>
            means of deciding.</p>
          <p>His poem and his life, if we may trust Eusebius, were ended <lb/>
            in the manner following. “ Having been driven to madness <lb/>
            by an amatory potion, and having composed several books in <lb/>
            the intervals of his insanity, which Cicero afterwards cor­ <lb/>
            rected, he died by his own hand in the forty-fourth year of <lb/>
            his age." By whom the potion was administered, is conjec­ <lb/>
            tured only from a passage in St. Jerome, who says that a cer­ <lb/>
            tain Lucilia killed her husband or her lover, by giving him a <lb/>
            philtre which was intended to secure his love, but of which the <lb/>
            effect was to render him insane.3 This Lucilia is supposed <lb/>
            to have been the wife or mistress of Lucretius, but by whom <lb/>
            the supposition was first made, I am not able to discover.</p>
          <p>He is said by Donatus, or whoever wrote the old Life of <lb/>
            Virgil, to have died on the day on which Virgil assumed the <lb/>
            toga virilis. <note type="footnote"> 1 Hist. of Rom. Lit. vol. i. p. 417. </note><note type="footnote">2 I. 42. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Epist. Dissuas. ad Rufinum, c. 22, torn. xi. p. 245 ed. Veron. </note> <pb n="vii"/>
            </p>
          <p>That Cicero corrected what he wrote, there is, except from <lb/>
            the passage in Eusebius, no indication.</p>
          <p>From a passage in Varro,1 it has been concluded that he <lb/>
            wrote many more books than have reached us; for “ Lucre­ <lb/>
            tius," says he, "suorum unius et viginti librorum initium <lb/>
            fecit hoc: Ætheris et terræ genitabile quaerere tempus." <lb/>
            But Lambinus has very plausibly conjectured that for Lu­ <lb/>
            cretius should be substituted Lucilius, or the name of some <lb/>
            other writer unknown to us. This is the more probable, <lb/>
            observes Eichstadt, as Varro was older than Lucretius, and <lb/>
            was not accustomed to draw examples and testimonies from <lb/>
            younger writers.</p>
          <p>From the six books, as they now stand, there is no infer­ <lb/>
            ence to be drawn that more were written. That something <lb/>
            more was intended is perhaps true; for when we consider <lb/>
            how the sixth book breaks off, we must either suppose that <lb/>
            he designed to write a conclusion to it, or that he meant an­ <lb/>
            other book to follow. He signifies, however,2 that he was <lb/>
            drawing to the conclusion of his undertaking; and, indeed, <lb/>
            the doctrines of Epicurus are so fully set forth in the six <lb/>
            books, that little more could have been added respecting them.</p>
          <p>It is true that there are two or three allusions among the <lb/>
            grammarians to passages and verses which are not now found <lb/>
            in the six books; allusions which have led to the belief that <lb/>
            there were more books, but which, with other considerations, <lb/>
            led Spalding, the editor of Quintilian,3 to the suspicion that <lb/>
            there were two editions given by the author himself, and <lb/>
            that, though the second was generally followed, the first was <lb/>
            not quite forgotten. Thus the 937th verse of the first book, <lb/>
            which is now read, <lb/>
            " Contingunt mellis dulci flavoque liquore," <lb/>
            is cited by Quintilian, <lb/>
            " Aspirant mellis dulci flavoque liquore." <lb/>
            And Servius, on those lines in the Georgics,4 <lb/>
            " Non ego cuncta meis amplecti versibus opto; <lb/>
            Non mihi si linguae centum sint oraque centum, <lb/>
            Ferrea vox," <note type="footnote">1 De L. L. v. p. 27, ed. Spengel. </note><note type="footnote">2 vi. 45, 91. </note><note type="footnote">a Inst. Or. in. 1, 4. </note><note type="footnote">4 II. 42. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            says, “ The verses are Lucretius's; but he has ænea vox, not <lb/>
            ferrea;” verses which are not now to be found in Lucretius. <lb/>
            This notion of two editions Eichstadt has noticed at some <lb/>
            length in his dissertation, De Lucretii Vitâ et Carmine ; and <lb/>
            Forbiger has written a long essay to show that Lucretius's <lb/>
            verses have been much altered. “ Fateor enim," says For­ <lb/>
            biger,1 “ ex quo primùm Lucretii carmen, studiosiùs perlege­ <lb/>
            rim operamque meam ei navaverim, plures mihi oblatas esse <lb/>
            causas suspicandi, nobis in his sex de rerum natura libris <lb/>
            non unius Lucretii, sed duorum scriptorum longè diversorum <lb/>
            manum agnoscendam, ideoque hune etiam auctorem iis annu­ <lb/>
            merandum esse, quorum scripta a serioribus multis in locis <lb/>
            mutata, aucta vel contracta, emendata vel corrupta, denique <lb/>
            longè alia ab ea, quam auctor ipsis dederit, formâ induta, ad <lb/>
            nostra tempera pervenerint." " I confess, that since I first <lb/>
            read the poem of Lucretius with attention, and bestowed <lb/>
            serious labour upon it, many reasons occurred to me for sus­ <lb/>
            pecting that, in these six books concerning the nature of <lb/>
            things, we have to recognise, not the hand of Lucretius alone, <lb/>
            but those of two writers of far different characters; and that <lb/>
            this author is therefore to be numbered with those, whose <lb/>
            works have come down to us altered in many places by later <lb/>
            writers ; having been augmented or diminished in bulk, <lb/>
            amended or corrupted, and invested with a different form <lb/>
            from that which the author himself gave them." But per­ <lb/>
            haps, in the case of Lucretius, the variations which we find <lb/>
            in the verses which are cited from him, are to be attributed, <lb/>
            not to any regular revision or emendation of his writings, <lb/>
            but to the casual mistakes of transcribers, and the lapse of <lb/>
            memory in grammarians. Perhaps also passages, containing <lb/>
            verses cited by Servius and others, have been lost. Lach­ <lb/>
            mann, the last editor, finds, or imagines that he finds, defi­ <lb/>
            ciencies in several pages.</p>
          <p>The Memmius to whom the poem is addressed, was, as <lb/>
            Lambinus and others think, Caius Memmius Gemellus, a <lb/>
            Roman knight, who is described by Cicero2 as "a learned <lb/>
            man, well-read in Greek, but disdainful of Latin literature; <lb/>
            a clever orator, and of an agreeable style; but shrinking from <lb/>
            the labour, not only of speaking, but even of thinking; and <note type="footnote"> I De Lucretii Carmine, p. 6. </note><note type="footnote">2 Brut. 70. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            doing injustice to his ability by his want of industry." He <lb/>
            became prætor, and after his prætorship had the province of <lb/>
            Bithynia, to which he was accompanied by Catullus the poet. <lb/>
            Being supported by Cæsar, he stood for the consulship, but <lb/>
            was unsuccessful, and, after being accused and condemned of <lb/>
            bribery, went into exile at Patræ, where he died. Cicero <lb/>
            defended him on his trial, and addressed to him some letters <lb/>
            which may be found in the thirteenth book of his Epistles to <lb/>
            his friends.1</p>
          <p>The general voice of criticism has awarded to Lucretius <lb/>
            high praise as a poet. The earliest notice which we find of <lb/>
            his works, is that of Cicero in a letter to his brother Quintus,2 <lb/>
            in which he says, as the passage stands in Ernesti, Lucretii <lb/>
            poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt; non multis luminibus ingenii, <lb/>
            multæ tamen artis. " The poetry of Lucretius is such as you <lb/>
            say; having not much splendour of genius, but a great deal <lb/>
            of art." Wakefield would omit the non, but is opposed by <lb/>
            Eichstadt and Schutz, and by general opinion.3 Cicero, how­ <lb/>
            ever, if we read his words rightly, seems hardly to do justice <lb/>
            to the poet,4 or to hit the general character of his work. To us, <lb/>
            of the present day, he appears to be chiefly distinguished by a <lb/>
            rough vigour, and to have been anxious rather to express his <lb/>
            thoughts strongly, than to clothe them in elegance or niceties <lb/>
            of language. Not that he disdained poetical beauties, for <lb/>
            Virgil and others have found in him many worthy of adop­ <lb/>
            tion ; but vigour and animation seemed to have been his chief <lb/>
            aim. Statius did him more justice, when he spoke of the <lb/>
            docti furor arduus Lucret, “ the lofty rage of the learned <lb/>
            Lucretius.”6 Ovid thoroughly understood his merit, and pre­ <lb/>
            dicted that his poem was destined to be immortal: <lb/>
            Carmina sublimis tune aunt peritura Lucreti, <lb/>
            Exitio terras cum dabit una dies.7 <note type="footnote">1 See Lambinus in Prolegom. 2 Ad Quint. Frat. ii. 11. </note><note type="footnote">a Tanaquil Faber proposed to read, omitting the non, "lita sunt <lb/>
            multis luminibus,” &amp;c., which Ernesti, as Eichstadt remarks, justly <lb/>
            condemns. Who indeed could endure the expression luminibus liners? </note><note type="footnote">4 See Warton's Essay on Pope, vol. ii. p. 328. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Stat.

            Cornelius Nepos ranks him in elegance with Catullus; for <lb/>
            speaking of a certain Julius Calidus, who was rescued from <lb/>
            proscription by Pomponius Atticus, he calls hint “ the most <lb/>
            elegant poet since the death of Catullus and Lucretius." <lb/>
            Quintilian 2 gives him similar praise, saying that he is elegans <lb/>
            in suâ materiâ, elegant in his peculiar department, though he <lb/>
            thinks him "difficult" for the student. Aulus Gellius calls <lb/>
            him a poet “ excelling ingenio et facundiâ, in genius and force <lb/>
            of language;" Serenus Sammonicus4 styles him the great <lb/>
            Lucretius;" and Velleius Paterculus,5 Vitruvius,6 Seneca, <lb/>
            Macrobius,8 and Pliny the younger,9 notice him as ranked <lb/>
            among the most eminent poets, though without bestowing on <lb/>
            him any specific commendation. He is recognised in a simi­ <lb/>
            lar way by Propertius10 and Tacitus.11</p>
          <p>There was therefore little cause for Dunlop to complain of <lb/>
            "the slight mention that is made of Lucretius by succeeding <lb/>
            Latin authors," and of "the coldness with which he is spoken <lb/>
            of by all Roman critics and poets, with the exception of Ovid." <lb/>
            Horace, indeed, who makes abundant mention of Ennius and <lb/>
            Lucilius, has, it must be acknowledged, not named Lucretius. <lb/>
            Dunlop, to account for this silence of Horace, and the sup­ <lb/>
            posed intended silence of others, suggests that “ the spirit of <lb/>
            free-thinking which pervaded his writings, may have rendered <lb/>
            it unsuitable or unsafe to extol his poetical talents. There <lb/>
            was a time," he adds, “ when, in this country, it was thought <lb/>
            scarcely decorous or becoming to express high admiration of <lb/>
            the genius of Rousseau and Voltaire." With reference to <lb/>
            Horace, and his times, there may have been some ground for <lb/>
            this supposition. Cicero, in his De Amicitiâ,12 introduces Lae­ <lb/>
            lius saying that " he does not agree with those who have <lb/>
            lately begun to assert that souls perish together with their <lb/>
            bodies, and that death makes an end of all." " I rather sub­ <lb/>
            mit myself," he continues, "to the authority of the ancients, or <lb/>
            of our own forefathers, who appointed religious rites for the <lb/>
            dead; rites which they would not have instituted, bad they <lb/>
            thought that the dead could not be affected by them, * * * <lb/>
            or to the authority of him who was pronounced by the oracle <note type="footnote"> I Vit. Att. xii. 4. </note><note type="footnote">2 Instit.

            of Apollo the wisest of men ; and who did not on this, as on <lb/>
            most subjects, assert sometimes one thing and sometimes an­ <lb/>
            other, but maintained invariably the same opinion, that the <lb/>
            souls of men are divine, and that, when they are released from <lb/>
            the body, a return to heaven is open to them, and first of all <lb/>
            to the best and most worthy. But," he concludes, as if un­ <lb/>
            willing to side too closely with either party, “ should the <lb/>
            opinion of those be true, who think that the soul and the body <lb/>
            perish together, and that all sense is terminated by their <lb/>
            separation, death will then be attended with neither good nor <lb/>
            evil."</p>
          <p>The moderns have certainly not been less willing to praise <lb/>
            Lucretius than the ancients. Barthius and Turnebus2 com­ <lb/>
            mend the attractive simplicity of his antique Latinity; Cri­ <lb/>
            nitus and Casaubon 3 speak of his style in a similar manner; <lb/>
            and Julius Scaliger4 calls him “a divine man, and incompar­ <lb/>
            able poet." The eulogies bestowed upon him by Lam bin us, <lb/>
            Faber, and his other commentators, I omit, as they might be <lb/>
            regarded as the offspring of partiality.</p>
          <p>Our own countrymen have not been behind others in offer­ <lb/>
            ing their tribute of admiration, as exhibited in editions, trans­ <lb/>
            lations, remarks, and quotations. Dr. Warton, in his Essay on <lb/>
            Pope,5 calls the Nature of Things "the noblest descriptive <lb/>
            poem extant," and has most happily illustrated the poet's <lb/>
            vigour of conception and execution: “ The Persians," says <lb/>
            he, “ distinguish the different degrees of the strength of fancy <lb/>
            in different poets, by calling them painters or sculptors. Lu­ <lb/>
            cretius, from the force of his images, should be ranked among <lb/>
            the latter. He is, in truth, a sculptor-poet. His images have <lb/>
            a bold relief " If Lucretius had not been spoiled by the <lb/>
            Epicurean system," says Lord Byron,6 "we should have had a <lb/>
            far superior poem to any now in existence. As mere poetry, <lb/>
            it is the first of Latin poems." But the most discriminating <lb/>
            and ample praise, that has been given him by any English <lb/>
            author, is that of Dryden : 7</p>
          <p>“ If I am not mistaken," says he, “ the distinguishing cha- <note type="footnote"> I Advers. xxiii. 1. </note><note type="footnote">2 Advers. xviii. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Not. in Johan. c. 5, cited in the Life prefixed to Creech's version. </note><note type="footnote"> * In Aristot.

            meter of Lucretius, I mean of his soul and genius, is a certain <lb/>
            kind of noble pride, and positive assertion of his own opinions. <lb/>
            He is every where confident of his own reason, and assuming <lb/>
            an absolute command, not only over his vulgar readers, but <lb/>
            even his patron Memmius; for he is always bidding him at­ <lb/>
            tend, as if he had the rod over him, and using a magisterial <lb/>
            authority, while he instructs him. * * * He seems to disdain <lb/>
            all manner of replies, and is so confident of his cause, that he <lb/>
            is beforehand with his antagonists ; urging for them whatever <lb/>
            he imagined they could say, and leaving them, as he supposes, <lb/>
            without an objection for the future. All this too with so <lb/>
            much scorn and indignation, as if he were assured of the tri­ <lb/>
            umph before he entered into the lists.</p>
          <p>“From this sublime and daring genius of his, it must of <lb/>
            necessity come to pass, that his thoughts must be masculine, <lb/>
            full of argumentation, and that sufficiently warm. From the <lb/>
            same fiery temper proceeds the loftiness of his expressions, <lb/>
            and the perpetual torrent of his verse, when the barrenness <lb/>
            of his subject does not too much restrain the quickness of his <lb/>
            fancy. For there is no doubt to be made, but that he could <lb/>
            have been every where as poetical as he is in his descriptions, <lb/>
            and in the moral part of his philosophy, if he had not aimed <lb/>
            more to instruct in his system of nature, than to delight."</p>
          <p>With regard to the subject of his poem, Lucretius is to be <lb/>
            contemplated as a natural and moral philosopher.</p>
          <p>The physical part of his philosophy, and most, indeed, of the <lb/>
            moral part, he took from Epicurus, who, as Cicero1 observes, <lb/>
            had previously adopted his physics from Democritus. Of this, <lb/>
            the great principle is, that nothing can proceed from nothing,2 <lb/>
            and that, consequently, this world, in which we live, and <lb/>
            every other object in the universe, was formed from matter <lb/>
            that previously existed. How this matter came to exist, we <lb/>
            need not inquire; we are to suppose that it existed always. <lb/>
            In its original state it was an infinitude of detached atoms, <lb/>
            moving or falling through unlimited space; for that space is <lb/>
            unlimited is by Lucretius elaborately proved.3</p>
          <p>These atoms are infrangible and indestructible; for matter <lb/>
            is not infinitely divisible ; there must be a point at which di- <note type="footnote"> 1 De Fin. i. 6. </note><note type="footnote">2 I. 156, 544. </note><note type="footnote">3 I. 967. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xiii"/>
            vision ends. They are hard and solid, or they would be un­ <lb/>
            able to endure agitation and attrition throughout an infinity <lb/>
            of ages.1 They are of different shapes, suited for the forma­ <lb/>
            tion of various substances by combination.2 The number of <lb/>
            their forms, however, is limited; but the number of each form <lb/>
            is infinite.3</p>
          <p>The atoms were moving; but whence had they the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of motion ? From their own gravity; for all bodies <lb/>
            move downwards by their own weight.4 This is the com­ <lb/>
            mencement of absurdity in the system; for, if space be infi­ <lb/>
            nite, one direction in it cannot be called downwards more than <lb/>
            another; as Lucretius himself indeed acknowledges, observing <lb/>
            that nil est funditus imum;5 nor can any reason be assigned <lb/>
            why an atom should move from one part of infinite space to <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>This commencement of motion, however, being assumed, it <lb/>
            is next to be shown how atoms combined. Had they all <lb/>
            moved, as might have been supposed, in straight lines, as they <lb/>
            fell or proceeded through space, there could have been no <lb/>
            coalition among them, unless the heavier had overtaken the <lb/>
            lighter. But Lucretius, or Epicurus, had sufficient conception <lb/>
            of the motion of bodies in empty space, to understand that light <lb/>
            bodies must move through it as speedily as heavy ones, and <lb/>
            that, consequently, one atom could not overtake another., It <lb/>
            was necessary, therefore, to make some of them deviate from <lb/>
            the straight or perpendicular line, and it is accordingly as­ <lb/>
            sumed that some do deviate from it. “ This supposition," <lb/>
            says Cicero,7 "is mere puerility; for he introduces the devia­ <lb/>
            tion arbitrarily; he makes some atoms decline from the straight <lb/>
            course without cause ; and to say that any thing takes place <lb/>
            without a cause is to a natural philosopher the most disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful of all things. To assert, too, that some decline, and some <lb/>
            go straight onwards, is, as it were, to give properties and duties <lb/>
            to atoms despotically, determining which is to go in a right <lb/>
            line, and which obliquely."</p>
          <p>But when, from partial deviations, some had come in con­ <lb/>
            tact with others, they began to form combinations. They <lb/>
            strove, as it were, for a long time ineffectually,8 but at length <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> 1 I 484—635. </note><note type="footnote">2 11. 94—107. </note><note type="footnote">3 II. 426—580. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 II. 79—87. </note><note type="footnote">5 I. 992. </note><note type="footnote">6 II. 225, seq. </note><note type="footnote">7 De Fin. i. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> I. 1023, seg.; V. 188—195. </note> <lb/>

            the larger and heavier atoms coalesced into the denser sub­ <lb/>
            stances, as earth and water; the smaller and lighter, into more <lb/>
            subtle matters, as air and fire. From combinations of such <lb/>
            substances arose plants and animals; as trees and worms still <lb/>
            spring from the earth when it is moistened and warmed. Of <lb/>
            the rise of animals in general, and of man especially, the reader <lb/>
            will find an ample account, according to the notions of Epi­ <lb/>
            curus, in the fifth book.1</p>
          <p>Nature does not abhor a vacuum. On the contrary, it is <lb/>
            necessary that there should be, throughout the whole of mat­ <lb/>
            ter, certain portions of empty space, or the movement of par­ <lb/>
            ticles would be utterly impeded. Water, for instance, could <lb/>
            not be a liquid, unless there were vacuities among its atoms <lb/>
            to allow them to yield to pressure.2</p>
          <p>Man consists of a body and a soul. The body is constituted <lb/>
            of coarser, and the soul of finer matter. Both are produced <lb/>
            together, and grow up and decay together; at death, the con­ <lb/>
            nexion between them is dissolved; the soul takes its departure, <lb/>
            to be decomposed, and mingled with other matter; and the <lb/>
            body begins to decay, that it may undergo a similar fate.</p>
          <p>The mind is intimately connected with the soul; so inti­ <lb/>
            mately that they must be said to form one substance. Both <lb/>
            are composed of heat, vapour, air, and a certain fourth sub­ <lb/>
            stance, which has no name, but which is the most important <lb/>
            of the four, as being the origin of motion in the whole man. <lb/>
            That both are wholly corporeal is indisputable, from their <lb/>
            power to act on the body: <lb/>
            Tangere enim et tangi, nisi corpus, nulla potest res.3</p>
          <p>Ideas of objects in the mind are produced by the mysteri­ <lb/>
            ous action of images of things on the soul and intellect; images <lb/>
            of a light vapoury substance, which are perpetually passing <lb/>
            off from the surface of all bodies whatsoever, and exhibiting <lb/>
            the exact resemblance of the objects from which they are de­ <lb/>
            tached. Other images, too, are formed spontaneously in the <lb/>
            atmosphere, as we see clouds, at times, form themselves into <lb/>
            likenesses of things on the face of the sky. Of images, ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, the number is infinite, so that, whenever a man <lb/>
            wishes to think on any thing, the image of it is generally ready <note type="footnote"> 1 Ver. 780, seq. </note><note type="footnote">2 I. 347—383, et seg. </note><note type="footnote"> a On the Soul, see book ii. passim. </note> <lb/>

            to present itself for his contemplation. If he cannot recollect <lb/>
            what he wishes to think on, he may consider that an image of <lb/>
            it is not at hand. Dreams are excited by images, which, as <lb/>
            they pass through the air, penetrating the coverings of the <lb/>
            body, come in contact with such atoms of the soul as are at <lb/>
            the surface of the body, and thus communicate their impres­ <lb/>
            sions to the whole of the soul and mind.</p>
          <p>Vision is produced by the same images flying off from the <lb/>
            surface of the objects at which we look, and striking on the <lb/>
            eye. Reflection from mirrors, and other smooth surfaces, is <lb/>
            produced by the image first striking the reflecting plane, and <lb/>
            then being reverberated to the eye. Voice, like all sounds, is <lb/>
            a corporeal substance, because it frequently, as it passes forth, <lb/>
            causes abrasion of the throat, and because much speaking ex­ <lb/>
            hausts the corporeal frame by detraction of atoms.1</p>
          <p>The members and organs of the body were not formed with <lb/>
            a design that they might be used; for there could have been <lb/>
            no design in the offspring of fortuitously meeting atoms ; but, <lb/>
            as they have been formed, and we find them capable of being <lb/>
            used, we apply them, accordingly, to the uses for which they <lb/>
            seem adapted. The feet were not formed for walking, but, <lb/>
            as we find they enable us to walk, we employ them in walking.2</p>
          <p>Of all our knowledge the foundation must rest on the per­ <lb/>
            ceptions of our senses. To our senses we can assuredly trust, <lb/>
            for what shall refute them ? Will any thing distinct from <lb/>
            them refute them, or will they refute one another? That <lb/>
            which shall convict them of falsehood must be more trust- <lb/>
            worthy than they; but what can be more trust-worthy ? <lb/>
            What shall convince us that those bodies which appear to <lb/>
            the senses square, or hot, or black, are not possessed of those <lb/>
            qualities ?3</p>
          <p>The motions and combinations of atoms being established, <lb/>
            all natural phenomena, as thunder, lightning, rain, earth­ <lb/>
            quakes, are easily shown to arise from their changes of place <lb/>
            and effects on one another.4</p>
          <p>Even were it not demonstrable that the world was for­ <lb/>
            tuitously formed by the coalescence of atoms, it might yet be <lb/>
            safely affirmed, from the numerous faults apparent in it, and <lb/>
            from the various causes of suffering to animal life which it <note type="footnote"> I Of images, &amp;c. see book iv. passim. </note><note type="footnote">2 IV. 825. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 IV. 380—523. </note><note type="footnote">4 See book v. </note> <lb/>

            contains, that it was not made by divine wisdom as an abode <lb/>
            for living creatures.! It sprung into being casually; and <lb/>
            animals, that casually sprung from it, make the best of that <lb/>
            abode to which they are confined, and from which there is no <lb/>
            release but death.</p>
          <p>This world, which we inhabit, is not the only one in the <lb/>
            universe.2 The number of atoms being infinite, it is naturally <lb/>
            to be supposed that they must have produced more worlds <lb/>
            than one. It is therefore probable that there are many <lb/>
            worlds of many kinds. And as these worlds have been gener­ <lb/>
            ated, we may fairly argue that they also decay. Men, other <lb/>
            animals, and the trees of the forest, are born but to die; and <lb/>
            why should not a world be subject to the same fate as the <lb/>
            things which grow in it ? We see, indeed, the symptoms of <lb/>
            decadence in the world which we inhabit; for the present pro­ <lb/>
            ductions of the earth are not of the same vigour as those of <lb/>
            its earlier days. All, then, around us, we may conclude is <lb/>
            making progress towards dissolution; the great globe will <lb/>
            continue to sink and grow infirm, until at last, mouldering and <lb/>
            disruptured, it scatters its atoms through surrounding space, to <lb/>
            contribute to the formation of other worlds like or unlike <lb/>
            itself. <lb/>
            Star after star from heaven's bright arch shall rush, <lb/>
            Suns sink on suns, and systems systems crush; <lb/>
            Headlong, extinct, to one dark centre fall, <lb/>
            And Death, and Night, and Chaos, mingle all. <lb/>
            Till, o'er the wreck, emerging from the storm, <lb/>
            Immortal Nature lifts her changeful form, <lb/>
            Mounts from her funeral pyre on wings of flame, <lb/>
            And soars and shines another and the same. Darwin.</p>
          <p>Such were the general tenets of Lucretius as a natural <lb/>
            philosopher; tenets on which the reader will find him amply <lb/>
            enlarging in the following pages.</p>
          <p>His doctrines as a moral philosopher may be noticed with <lb/>
            greater brevity.</p>
          <p>His great boast as a moralist was, that he freed men from <lb/>
            the terrors of death, and of suffering after death. The soul, <lb/>
            says he, when it is separated from the body, is dispersed among <lb/>
            the matter from which it was collected, and the man ceases to <lb/>
            be. His atoms continue to exist, for they are indestructible, <lb/>
            but his own existence, as an individual being, is no more. He <note type="footnote"> 1 V. 196, seg. </note><note type="footnote">2 II. 1075. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            is separated into his parts, and his consciousness that he ever <lb/>
            existed as a whole is at an end. Of what has been, he will <lb/>
            have no recollection; of what shall be, he will have no <lb/>
            knowledge. Why then should he dread to die, when after <lb/>
            death no suffering can ensue? He that is about to die <lb/>
            young, may felicitate himself that he shall escape that trouble <lb/>
            and affliction of which some falls to the lot of every man; he <lb/>
            that dies at an advanced age, may be satisfied that he has had <lb/>
            so long opportunity for those enjoyments of which no man <lb/>
            fails to obtain some. After a certain period life offers nothing <lb/>
            new, and why should we seek to prolong it ?1</p>
          <p>The greatest enjoyment of life consists in tranquil plea­ <lb/>
            sure. To labour for honour and dignities, which are unsatis­ <lb/>
            factory when attained, is mere folly. Nature has supplied <lb/>
            every thing necessary to satisfy our wants, and to enable us <lb/>
            to spend our existence in ease, contentment, and pleasure ; if <lb/>
            we only study the best method of making the most of what <lb/>
            is set before us. A wise man can live on a little; and to live <lb/>
            contentedly on a little is to be equal in enjoyment to him who <lb/>
            has more than ourselves, and who, however much he may <lb/>
            have, can have no solid satisfaction unless he is contented <lb/>
            with that which he possesses.2 The highest degree of wisdom <lb/>
            that we can attain, is to be able to look down from the serene <lb/>
            elevations of philosophy, on the unreasoning crowds wander­ <lb/>
            ing beneath us, seeking for the path of happiness, and vainly <lb/>
            hoping to find it in the pursuit of the splendours and distinc­ <lb/>
            tions of the world.3</p>
          <p>Whether he really believed in the existence of gods, that <lb/>
            is, of beings of a similar but superior nature to ourselves, it <lb/>
            is not easy, from the perusal of his works, to decide. He at <lb/>
            times speaks of gods, like Epicurus, as certainly existing,4 and <lb/>
            enjoying a state of tranquil felicity, unconcerned about the <lb/>
            affairs of the world, and unaffected by human good or human <lb/>
            evil.5 At other times, he seems to consider them as mere <lb/>
            creatures of the imagination, to which men have attributed, <lb/>
            in the operations of nature, those effects of which they cannot <lb/>
            discover the causes.6 <note type="footnote"> 1 Book iii., sub fin. </note><note type="footnote">2 II. 20—60. </note><note type="footnote">a II. 1—13. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 VI. 76. In ii. 599, he notices that the earth is called magna <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>The first edition of Lucretius was printed at Brescia, by Fer­ <lb/>
            andus, without date, but, as Wakefield and others think, about <lb/>
            the year 1470. It is of all editiones principes the most rare.</p>
          <p>The second edition appeared at Verona, printed by Freiden­ <lb/>
            perger, in 1486, and the third at Venice, by T. de Ragazoni­ <lb/>
            bus, in 1495. From Venice, too, in 1500, came forth the <lb/>
            first edition of Aldus; and fifteen years afterwards the second, <lb/>
            superintended by Naugerius, who did more to make his author <lb/>
            intelligible than had been done in the former edition. In the <lb/>
            mean time, however, (1511,) had appeared at Bononia the <lb/>
            edition of Baptista Pius, who brought much learning and <lb/>
            ability to bear upon his author, and many of whose notes are <lb/>
            still worthy of preservation.</p>
          <p>The second edition of Aldus is said by Lachmann1 to have <lb/>
            been greatly improved from the revised text of Michael Ma­ <lb/>
            rullus, which was published from his manuscripts after his <lb/>
            death, by Petrus Candidus, whose name the edition bears, at <lb/>
            Florence, in 1512; of which text succeeding editors have <lb/>
            overlooked the merits, or have been unwilling to do justice <lb/>
            to them.</p>
          <p>But all other editions were thrown into the shade by those <lb/>
            of Lambinus, of which the first appeared in 1563, the second <lb/>
            in 1565, and the third in 1570. Of all editors and expound­ <lb/>
            ers of Lucretius, Lambinus still deserves to stand at the head. <lb/>
            He is accused by Wakefield of inconsulta temeritas, injudici­ <lb/>
            ous rashness, in intruding his own conjectures into the text; <lb/>
            and by Eichstadt, of having had too high an opinion of his <lb/>
            own judgment and ability; but though there be some grounds <lb/>
            for such accusations, his character as an editor is still of the <lb/>
            highest order. He brought to his work a powerful mind, and, <lb/>
            knowing that Lucretius always intended to write sense, he <lb/>
            took upon himself to put sense, perhaps at times too arbi­ <lb/>
            trarily, into verses which had been left meaningless by tran­ <lb/>
            scribers. And it is surely no dishonour to him to have shown <lb/>
            his contempt for such a man as Gifanius, who, in 1565, printed <lb/>
            an edition at Antwerp, and whose annotations have little other <lb/>
            claim to notice than that of attacking Lambinus with the <lb/>
            meanness with which a low mind always attacks a higher. <note type="footnote"> I Prolegom. in Notas, p. 11. </note> <pb n="xix"/>
            </p>
          <p>There were some other editions, but of not much account, <lb/>
            between Gifanius's and that of Tanaquil Faber, which was <lb/>
            published in 1662, containing notes, brief indeed, but evincing <lb/>
            the great learning and acuteness of the editor.</p>
          <p>To Faber, in 1695, succeeded Creech. His text is Lambi­ <lb/>
            nus's with scarcely any variation, and though he never fails to <lb/>
            expose a mistake of Lambinus when he finds one in his comment­ <lb/>
            ary, he is very ready to profit by all Lambinus's instructions. <lb/>
            His interpretation after the manner of the Delphin editions, is of <lb/>
            little use, for, wherever there is any difficulty of construction, <lb/>
            he invariably abbreviates. Yet, if we may credit the last <lb/>
            editor, Lachmann, “ multa rectiùs interpretatus est quàm <lb/>
            scripsit, in philosophiâ explicandA sane diligens, sed linguæ <lb/>
            Latinæ imperitissimus." This is too strong; but there are <lb/>
            in his notes inelegances and inaccuracies.</p>
          <p>In 1725 appeared the splendid edition of Havercamp, which <lb/>
            is extremely useful, as containing all the notes of Lambinus, <lb/>
            Gifanius, Creech, and Faber, with a selection from those of <lb/>
            Pius, and with a few, of considerable value, from Abrahamus <lb/>
            Preigerus, a friend of Havercamp. Of Havercamp's own <lb/>
            there is comparatively little.</p>
          <p>At length, in 1796, came out, with a dedication to Fox, the <lb/>
            well-known edition of Wakefield. Wakefield had discovered, <lb/>
            by the inspection of a manuscript or two, that Lambinus had <lb/>
            taken, as he thought, unjustifiable liberties with the text of <lb/>
            Lucretius, and conceived that he should be enabled to re­ <lb/>
            store it to something like its original integrity. Had he <lb/>
            been content to reinstate only those words or phrases which <lb/>
            Lambinus or others had unreasonably ejected, he might have <lb/>
            done greater service, but he replaced also such readings as <lb/>
            any editor would have been blamed for suffering to remain. <lb/>
            I will give one instance. In Lambinus and Creech the 863rd <lb/>
            verse of the third book stands thus: <lb/>
            Interrupta semel quum sit repetentia nostra; <lb/>
            “ repetentia nostra," our memory or recollection. This is in­ <lb/>
            telligible; but Wakefield finding in manuscripts nostris, re­ <lb/>
            placed it as a crux to his reader, who, as soon as he comes to <lb/>
            it, is stuck fast. What, he inquires, is to be understood with <lb/>
            nostris? It is in vain to seek for any thing in what precedes, <lb/>
            and he must consult Wakefield's notes to find that, according <lb/>
             <pb n="xx"/>
            to Wakefield's notion, rebus must be supplied. How mich <lb/>
            the difficulties in an author may be increased by such changes <lb/>
            is easily conceivable; but he who has only read Lambinus or <lb/>
            Creech's edition of Lucretius, can have no conception how <lb/>
            much the difficulties in Lucretius have been increased by <lb/>
            Wakefield's arbitrary alterations. Whether Wakefield ever <lb/>
            "construed through a brick wall," I do not know; but that he <lb/>
            has raised abundance of brick walls through which others <lb/>
            are left to construe, is manifest. There is in his notes, <lb/>
            besides other unnecessary matter, a vast quantity of super­ <lb/>
            fluous railing at the inscitia and inverecundia of Lambinus, <lb/>
            and the inscitia and stupor of Creech, of which the reader may <lb/>
            see an average specimen on vi. 582, and in various other <lb/>
            places. A man worthy to edit Lucretius should have for­ <lb/>
            borne to apply the term inscitia to such a predecessor as <lb/>
            Lambinus.</p>
          <p>In 1801, Wakefield's text was reprinted at Leipsic by <lb/>
            Eichstadt, who had previously obtained repute by his edition <lb/>
            of Diodorus Siculus. The first volume, containing the text <lb/>
            of the six books, judicious prolegomena, and an excellent in­ <lb/>
            dex, is the only one that has appeared.</p>
          <p>In 1828 came forth the edition of Forbiger, which, chiefly <lb/>
            perhaps from the convenience of its size, has been much used. <lb/>
            His text is Wakefield's, with but very few alterations, and all <lb/>
            his explanations of passages are Wakefield's. His work, says <lb/>
            Lachmann, was mercenary; and it would be doing him great <lb/>
            injustice to suppose him capable of seeing any thing by the <lb/>
            light of his own intellect.</p>
          <p>In 1850, at Berlin, appeared Lachmann's edition, in two <lb/>
            thin volumes octavo. He is a little too fond of transposing <lb/>
            verses, and discovering deficiencies in the text, but deserves <lb/>
            great commendation for restoring many readings that Wake­ <lb/>
            field had ejected. His notes are not at all explanatory, but <lb/>
            are wholly occupied about changes in the text.</p>
          <p>With regard to versions of Lucretius, the earliest attempt <lb/>
            to render him into English was made by John Evelyn, the <lb/>
            author of " Sylva," who, in 1656, published the first book in <lb/>
            verse, with a commentary. His lady designed the frontispiece, <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            and Waller prefixed a copy of verses. The translation is <lb/>
            faithful, but tame.</p>
          <p>In 1682 was published the translation by Creech, which, as <lb/>
            the first complete version of the poet, was cordially welcomed. <lb/>
            Evelyn furnished some laudatory couplets, saying how much <lb/>
            he was pleased that the entire work had fallen to more vigor­ <lb/>
            ous hands than his own. Duke, Tate, and Otway gave also <lb/>
            their tribute of verse, and Creech was every where known as <lb/>
            the English Lucretius. But posterity have had time to dis­ <lb/>
            covel the faults in his performance. Many of his lines are <lb/>
            vigorous, but many are stiff and awkward ; and the licences <lb/>
            which he has taken with the original are almost beyond be­ <lb/>
            lief. Whoever will look at the commencement of his first <lb/>
            book, will find that between the tenth and sixteenth verses he <lb/>
            inserts five lines of his own. Similar interpolations may be <lb/>
            found in other places; and he likewise curtails with equal <lb/>
            freedom whenever it suits his purpose.</p>
          <p>About the same time Dryden produced some translations, or <lb/>
            rather paraphrases, of particular passages, executed with his <lb/>
            usual vigour.</p>
          <p>In 1743 there appeared, in two volumes octavo, a prose <lb/>
            translation, which Good calls Guernier's, but which was the <lb/>
            work of an unknown hand. Guernier, with others, furnished <lb/>
            the plates. The version is but indifferent. Some parts of it, <lb/>
            though printed as prose, run into blank verse.</p>
          <p>In 1799 the first book was translated in rhyme by an <lb/>
            anonymous author; and in 1808, also in rhyme, by the Rev. <lb/>
            W. Hamilton Drummond. Both versions have merit, but the <lb/>
            greater share of praise belongs to Mr. Drummond.</p>
          <p>In 1805 Dr. Good laid before the public his two quarto <lb/>
            volumes, containing a version of the whole poem in blank <lb/>
            verse, with copious notes. This translation is in general <lb/>
            pleasing and animated, but some parts are rather stiff. Taken <lb/>
            as a whole it is by far the best extant, and is deemed, by my <lb/>
            publisher, a desirable addition to the present volume.</p>
          <p>In 1813 was published by subscription, in two pompous <lb/>
            volumes quarto, the rhymed version of Thomas Busby, Mus. <lb/>
            D. He is, to do him justice, tolerably faithful to the sense, but <lb/>
            his couplets are far inferior to those of Mr. Drummond's First <lb/>
            Book. His notes are heavy and tedious; and all his learning <lb/>
            second-hand. The whole book reminds the reader of the com­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xxii"/>
            mencement of his well-known prologue, which Lord Byron, <lb/>
            says Moore, unnecessarily travestied: <lb/>
            When energizing objects men pursue <lb/>
            What are the prodigies they cannot do!</p>
          <p>In French, Lucretius has been translated several times. <lb/>
            The earliest version is that of the Abbé de Marolles, in prose, <lb/>
            published in 1650, which has not obtained more esteem than <lb/>
            his other translations of classical authors. In 1685 another <lb/>
            prose translation was published by the Baron de Coutures, <lb/>
            which is paraphrastic, but seems tolerably faithful to the sense. <lb/>
            In 1768 La Grange published a third, which gives the thoughts <lb/>
            of the poet with exactness, but wants vigour and animation; <lb/>
            and in 1794 Le Blanc de Guillet brought out a fourth, in verse, <lb/>
            which I have not minutely examined, but on which his coun­ <lb/>
            trymen set no very high value. The last, in 1825, was that <lb/>
            of Pongerville, in prose, rather a paraphrase than a transla­ <lb/>
            lion, and preserving nothing of the sententiousness of Lu­ <lb/>
            cretius.</p>
          <p>The Italian version of Marchetti, in blank verse, published <lb/>
            in London 1717, and since several times reprinted, has always <lb/>
            been highly esteemed.</p>
          <p>The Germans have three translations; one by Mayr, 1784, <lb/>
            in prose, which Degen, cited by Moss, calls “ pretty accurate <lb/>
            another by Meineke, 1795, in hexameter verse, which is ge­ <lb/>
            nerally considered faithful to the sense; and the last by Kne­ <lb/>
            bel, 1821, which is also in hexameter verse, and which is the <lb/>
            most highly valued of the three.</p>
          <p>The Dutch have a prose translation by De Wit, printed in <lb/>
            1701, which Good says that he had seen, "but without being <lb/>
            induced to imitate it.”</p>
          <p>I beg leave to observe, that, in the notes attached to the <lb/>
            following translation, I have not taken upon me to refute any <lb/>
            of the doctrines of Lucretius or Epicurus. To have offered <lb/>
            formal refutations of them would have occupied more space <lb/>
            than could be afforded in the present volume; and many <lb/>
            of them, in these days, require no refutation. I have there­ <lb/>
            fore restricted myself to discharging that which Dryden ad­ <lb/>
            monishes me to be the duty of a translator,—to do my author <lb/>
            all the right I can, and to translate It;. to the best advantage. <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            Those who seek for arguments against his tenets, physical or <lb/>
            moral, may find them in Lactantius ; in Arnobius; in the <lb/>
            Anti-Lucretius of Cardinal Polignac ; in the Bridgewater <lb/>
            Treatises ; and in abundance of other English books.</p>
          <p>The famous refutation by Cardinal Polignac, called Anti- <lb/>
            Lucretius, I might have quoted in every page; and the reader <lb/>
            will perhaps wonder that I have not done so. But I for­ <lb/>
            bore to quote him, as I forbore to quote others. He assailed <lb/>
            Lucretius with great determination; his versification, though <lb/>
            deficient in Lucretian ardour, is always respectable, and some­ <lb/>
            times elevated; and he would perhaps be more read, had he <lb/>
            not unluckily, as Voltaire observes, when he attacted Lucre­ <lb/>
            tius attacked Newton.</p>

          <p>Lucretius invokes Venus as the great cause of production, ver. 1—44. He <lb/>
            then dedicates his work to Memmius; praises Epicurus, whose doctrine <lb/>
            he follows; vindicates his subject from the charge of impiety; exposes the <lb/>
            emptiness of the religious system of his day, and the fictions of the <lb/>
            poets; and introduces, not without allusion to the difficulties to be over­ <lb/>
            come, the great arguments of which he proposes to treat, ver. 45—159. <lb/>
            Entering upon his subject, he shows, first, that nothing can proceed from ^ <lb/>
            nothing, and that nothing can return to nothing, ver. 160—265. Secondly, <lb/>
            that there are certain minute corpuscles, which, though imperceptible to <lb/>
            our senses, are conceivable in our minds, and from which all things origin­ <lb/>
            ate, ver. 266—329. Thirdly, that there is vacuum or empty space, ver. <lb/>
            330—430. Fourthly, that there is nothing in the universe but body and <lb/>
            space, and that all other things which are said TO BE, are only adjuncts <lb/>
            or events, properties or accidents of body and space, ver. 431—483. He <lb/>
            then proceeds to demonstrate that the primary corpuscles, or elements of <lb/>
            things, are perfectly solid, indivisible, and eternal, ver. 484—635. He re­ <lb/>
            futes those who had held other opinions, as Heraclitus, who said that fire <lb/>
            was the origin of things; and others, who had maintained the same of air, <lb/>
            water, and earth, ver. 636—712. He attacks Empedocles, who said that <lb/>
            the universe was compounded of the four elements, and Anaxagoras, who <lb/>

            or food to men." Thus we have alma Cere8, Virgo Geo. i. 7, alme <lb/>
            Sol, Hor. Carm. Saec. 9, besides alma TeMus, and many other similar <lb/>
            applications of the epithet. Horace has also alma Venus, Od. iv. 15, <lb/>
            31. And Ausonius has the same expression in many places, besides <lb/>
            this inscription for a statue of Venus, which he has borrowed from <lb/>
            Lucretius: <lb/>
            Orta salo, suscepta solo, patre edita coelo, <lb/>

            “Others,” says Creech, " interpret lœta, fœcunda, grata; I prefer <lb/>
            benigna, a word which expresses all the other virtues of Venus, to <lb/>

            the translation of this word is, whether it is to be rendered visitest fre­ <lb/>

            signification is, in my opinion, infinitely better adapted to what fol­ <lb/>

            but give the preference to this. Wakefield interprets " frequentas <lb/>

            lus, who has " commoves." The word occurs twice in other places of <lb/>
            Lucretius, but not in any sense that illustrates this passage. It is to <lb/>
            be observed that the preposition con, with, is not to be considered <lb/>
            useless; looking to the subject of the poem, we may regard it as <lb/>
            signifying that Venus (herself material) co-operates with matter in <lb/>

            examination,1 of what the soul and the nature of the mind <lb/>
            consist, and what it is, which, haunting us, sometimes when <lb/>

            not the rays of the sun, or the bright shafts of day,2 that must <lb/>

            which our first principle shall hence take its commence­ <lb/>
            ment, THAT NOTHING IS EVER DIVINELY4 GENERATED FROM <lb/>
            NOTHING. For thus it is that fear restrains all men, because <lb/>
            they observe many things effected on the earth and in <lb/>
            heaven, of which effects they can by no means see the. <lb/>
            causes, and therefore think that they are wrought by a divine <lb/>
            power. For which reasons, when we shall have clearly seen <lb/>
            that NOTHING CAN BE PRODUCED FROM NOTHING,5 we shall <lb/>
            then have a more accurate perception of that of which we are <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. I. 161—186."/> <lb/>
            might be produced from all things; nothing would require <lb/>
            seed. In the first place, men might spring from the sea; the <lb/>
            scaly tribe, and birds, might spring from the earth ; herds, <lb/>
            and other cattle, might burst from the sky; the culti­ <lb/>
            vated fields, as well as the deserts, might contain every kind <lb/>
            of wild animal, without any settled law of production: nor <lb/>
            would the same fruits be constant to the same trees, but would <lb/>
            be changed ; and all trees might bear all kinds of fruit. Since, <lb/>
            when there should not be generative elements for each pro­ <lb/>
            duction, how could a certain parent-producer remain invariable <lb/>
            for all individual things ? But now, because all things are <lb/>
            severally produced from certain seeds, each is produced, and <lb/>
            comes forth into the regions of light, from that spot in which <lb/>
            the matter, and first elements of each, subsist. And for this <lb/>
            cause all things cannot be produced from all, inasmuch as there <lb/>
            are distinct and peculiar faculties in certain substances.</p>
          <p>Besides, why do we see the rose put forth in spring,' corn <lb/>
            in summer heat, and vines under the influence of autumn, if <lb/>
            it be not because, when the determinate seeds of things have <lb/>
            united together at their proper time, whatever is produced <lb/>
            appears while the seasons are favourable, and while the <lb/>
            vigorous earth securely brings forth her tender productions <lb/>
            into the regions of light. But if these were generated <lb/>
            from nothing, they might arise suddenly at indefinite periods, <lb/>
            and at unsuitable seasons of the year, inasmuch as there would <lb/>
            be no original elements, which might be restrained from a <lb/>
            generative combination at any season, however inconvenient.</p>
          <p>Nor, moreover, would there be need of time for the coming <lb/>
            together of seed2 for the growth of things, if they could grow <note type="footnote"> which he afterwards argues,) something might spring up from that <lb/>
            vacuum. Should there be a vacuum in the sea, a man might spring <lb/>
            from it; should there be a vacuum in the air, a tree might flourish <lb/>
            out of it. Seed, or originating particles, would be quite superfluous; <lb/>
            simple vacant space, the abode of non-entity, would suffice to pro­ <lb/>
            duce abundance of entities. The rest of the paragraph follows of <lb/>
            course. This is his first argument on this head. I have translated <lb/>

              out of nothing. For young men might on a sudden be formed <lb/>
              from puny infants, and groves, springing up anexpectedly, <lb/>
              might dart forth from the earth ; of which things it is plain <lb/>
              that none happen, since all things grow gradually, as is fitting, <lb/>
              from unvarying atoms, and, as they grow, preserve their kind, <lb/>
              so that you may understand that all things individually are <lb/>
              enlarged and nourished from their own specific matter.</p>
          <p>Add to this, that the earth cannot furnish her cheering <lb/>
            fruits without certain rains1 in the year; nor, moreover, <lb/>
            can the nature of animals, if kept from food, propagate their <lb/>
            kind, and sustain life; so that you may rather deem that <lb/>
            many elements are common to many things, (as we see letters <lb/>
            common to many words,) than that any thing can exist with­ <lb/>
            out its proper elements.</p>
          <p>Still further, why could not nature produce men of such2 a <lb/>
            size that they might ford the sea on foot,3 and rend great moun­ <lb/>
            tains with their hands, and outlast in existence many ages of <lb/>
            human life, if it be not because certain matter has been assigned <lb/>
            for producing certain things, from which matter it is fixed what <lb/>
            can or cannot arise ? It must be admitted therefore, that no­ <lb/>
            thing can be made from nothing, since things have need of <lb/>
            seed, from which all individually being produced, may be <lb/>
            brought forth into the gentle air of heaven.</p>
          <p>Lastly, since we observe that cultivated places excel4 the <lb/>
            uncultivated, and yield to our hands better fruits, we may see <note type="footnote"> ment-from natural growth. If things might grow up from nothing, <lb/>

            that there are in the ground the primitive elements of things, <lb/>
            which we, in turning the fertile glebe with the ploughshare, <lb/>
            and subjugating the soil of the earth, force into birth. But <lb/>
            were there no such seeds, you might see things severally <lb/>
            grow up and become much better of their own accord with­ <lb/>
            out our labour.</p>
          <p>Add, too,1 that nature resolves each thing into its own <lb/>
            constituent elements, and DOES NOT REDUCE ANY THING TO <lb/>
            NOTHING.</p>
          <p>For if any thing were perishable in all its parts, every <lb/>
            thing might then dissolve, being snatched suddenly from be­ <lb/>
            fore our eyes; for there would be no need of force to pro­ <lb/>
            duce a separation of its parts, and break their connexion. <lb/>
            Whereas now, since all things individually consist of eternal <lb/>
            seed, nature does not suffer the destruction of any thing to <lb/>
            be seen, until such power assail them as to sever them with a <lb/>

            less bound by mutual connexion. For a mere touch, indeed, <lb/>
            would be a sufficient cause of destruction, supposing that there <lb/>
            were no parts of eternal consistence, but all perishable, the <lb/>

            thing opposes its waves. Thus, therefore, must the blasts of <lb/>
            the wind also be borne along; which (when, like a mighty <lb/>

            rival mighty rivers, which are of manifest bodily substance.</p>
          <p>Moreover we perceive various odours of objects, and yet <lb/>
            never see them approaching our nostrils. Nor do we behold <lb/>

            in the habit of viewing sounds; all which things, however, <lb/>
            must of necessity consist of a corporeal nature, since they have <lb/>

            hands made smaller by the touch of people frequently saluting <lb/>
            them, and passing by. These objects, therefore, after they <lb/>
            have been worn, we observe to become diminished; but what <lb/>
            particles take their departure on each particular occasion, <lb/>
            jealous nature has withheld from us the faculty of seeing.2</p>
          <p>Lastly, whatever substances time and nature add little by <lb/>
            little to objects, obliging them to increase gradually, those <lb/>
            substances no acuteness of vision, however earnestly exerted, <lb/>
            can perceive ; nor, moreover, whatever substances waste <lb/>
            away through age and decay ; nor can you discern what <lb/>
            the rocks, which overhang the sea, and are eaten by the <lb/>
            corroding salt 3 of the ocean, lose every time that they are <lb/>
            washed by the waves. Nature, therefore, carries on her <lb/>
            operations by imperceptible particles.</p>
          <p>Nor, however,4 5 are all things held enclosed by corporeal <lb/>
            substance ; for there is a VOID in things; a truth which it <lb/>
            will be useful for you, in reference to many points, to know; <lb/>
            and which will prevent you from wandering in doubt, and from <lb/>

            being distrustful of my words. Wherefore, I say, there is space <lb/>

            things could by no means be moved; for that which is the <lb/>
            quality of body, namely, to obstruct and to oppose, would be <lb/>
            present at all times, and would be exerted against all bodies; no­ <lb/>
            thing, therefore, would be able to move forward, since nothing <lb/>
            would begin to give way. But now, throughout the sea and land <lb/>
            and heights of heaven, we see many things moved before our <lb/>
            eyes in various ways and by various means, which, if there <lb/>
            were no void, would not so much want their active motion, as <lb/>
            being deprived of it, as they would, properly speaking, never <lb/>
            by any means have been produced at all ; 1 since matter, <lb/>
            crowded together on all sides, would have remained at rest. <lb/>
            and have been unable to act.</p>
          <p>Besides, although some things may be regarded as solid, <lb/>
            yet you may, for the following reasons, perceive them to be <lb/>
            of a porous consistence. In rocks and caves, the liquid mois­ <lb/>
            ture of the waters penetrates their substance, and all parts <lb/>
            weep, as it were, with abundant drops ; food distributes itself <lb/>
            through the whole of the body in animals; the groves in­ <lb/>
            crease, and yield their fruits in their season, because nourish­ <lb/>
            ment is diffused through the whole of the trees, even from <lb/>
            the lowest roots, over all the trunks and branches; voices <lb/>
            pass through the walls, and fly across the closed apartments <lb/>
            of houses; keen frost2 penetrates to the very marrow of our <lb/>
            bones; which kind of effects, unless there were void spaces in <lb/>
            bodies, where the several particles might pass, you would never <lb/>
            by any means observe to take place.</p>
          <p>Lastly, why do we see some things exceed other things in <lb/>
            weight, though of no greater shape and bulk? For, if there <lb/>
            is just as much substance in a ball of wool as there is in a <lb/>
            ball of lead, it is natural that they should weigh the same, <lb/>
            since it is the property of all bodily substance to press every <lb/>
            thing downwards; but the nature of a VOID, on the contrary, <lb/>
            continues without weight. That body, therefore, which is equally <note type="footnote"> 1 Would not so much want their active motion, (as being deprived <lb/>

            large with another, and is evidently lighter, shows plainly that <lb/>
            it contains a greater portion of VACUITY. But the heavier body, <lb/>
            on the other hand, indicates that there is in it more material <lb/>
            substance, and that it comprises much less empty space.</p>
          <p>That, therefore, which we are now, by the aid of searching <lb/>
            argument, investigating, that, namely, which we call VOID; <lb/>
            is doubtless mixed among material substances.</p>
          <p>In considering these matters, I am obliged to anticipate <lb/>
            that objection which some imagine, lest it should seduce you <lb/>
            from the truth. They say, for instance, that water yields to <lb/>
            fishes pushing forwards, and opens liquid passages, since the <lb/>
            fish leave spaces behind them, into which the yielding waters <lb/>
            may make a conflux; so also that other things may be moved <lb/>
            among themselves, and change their place, although all parts <lb/>
            of space be full. But this notion, it is evident, has been <lb/>
            wholly conceived from false reasoning. For in what direc­ <lb/>
            tion, I pray, will fish be able to go forward, if the water shall <lb/>
            not give them room ? Or in what direction, moreover, will <lb/>
            the water have power to yield, supposing the fish shall have <lb/>
            no power to go forward to divide it ? Either, therefore, we <lb/>
            must deny motion to all bodies whatsoever, or we must admit <lb/>
            that vacuity is more or less inherent in all material substances, <lb/>
            whence every thing that moves derives the first commence­ <lb/>
            ment of its motion.</p>
          <p>Lastly, if two broad and flat bodies, after having come in­ <lb/>
            to collision, suddenly start asunder, it is clear that air must <lb/>
            necessarily take possession of all the vacuum which is then <lb/>
            formed between the bodies. And further, although that air <lb/>
            may quickly unite to flow into the vacancy, with blasts blowing <lb/>
            rapidly from all sides, yet the whole space will not be able to be <lb/>
            filled at once; for the air must of necessity occupy some part <lb/>
            first, then another, till in succession all parts be occupied.</p>
          <p>But if any person perchance, when the bodies have started <lb/>
            asunder, thinks that that separation is thus effected by reason <lb/>
            that the air condenses itself, he is in error; for a vacuum is <lb/>
            then formed between the bodies, which was not there before, <lb/>
            and the part likewise behind the bodies, which was vacant be­ <lb/>
            fore, is filled; nor can air be condensed in such a way; nor, <lb/>
            even if it could, would it have the power, I think, to draw it­ <lb/>
            self into itself,1 and unite its particles together without the aia <note type="footnote"> 1 To draw itself into itself.] Ver. 398. Ipse in se trahere. Lam­ </note> <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. I. 399—421."/> <lb/>
            of a void. For which reason, although you may long hesitate, <lb/>
            alleging many objections, you must nevertheless at last con­ <lb/>
            fess that there is vacuum in bodies.</p>
          <p>I have the ability, moreover, to collect credit for my doc­ <lb/>
            trines, 1 by adducing many additional arguments. But these <lb/>
            small traces which I have indicated will be sufficient for a sa­ <lb/>
            gacious mind; traces by which, indeed, you yourself may dis­ <lb/>
            cover others. For as dogs, when they have once lighted upon <lb/>
            certain tracks on the path, very frequently find by their scent <lb/>
            the lair of a wild beast that ranges over the mountains, <lb/>
            though covered over with leaves; so you yourself will be able, <lb/>
            in such matters as these, to note, of your own sagacity, one <lb/>

            give you the following assurance. My tongue, so agreeable <lb/>

            I fear lest slow old age may creep over our limbs, and break <lb/>
            down the gates of life within us, before all the abundance of <lb/>
            arguments in my verses, concerning any one subject, can <lb/>
            have been poured into your ears. But now, that I may re­ <lb/>

            words, summamque sequetur, will be ranked in the multitude of <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. I. 433—462."/> <lb/>
            which would, indeed, be as it were a third kind of nature. <lb/>
            For whatsoever shall exist, must in itself be something, either <lb/>
            of large bulk, or ever so diminutive, provided it be at all; <lb/>
            when, if it shall be sensible to the touch, however light and <lb/>
            delicate, it will increase the number of bodies, and be ranked <lb/>
            in the multitude of them; but if it shall be intangible, inas­ <lb/>
            much as it cannot hinder in any part any object proceeding to <lb/>
            pass through it, it then, you may be sure, will be the empty <lb/>
            space which we call a vacuum.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whatsoever shall exist of itself, will either do <lb/>
            something, or will be obliged TO SUFFER other things acting <lb/>
            upon it, or will simply BE, so that other things may exist and <lb/>
            be done in it. But nothing can DO or SUFFER without being <lb/>
            possessed of bodily substance, nor, moreover, afford place for <lb/>
            acting and suffering, unless it be empty and vacant space. No <lb/>
            third nature, therefore, distinct in itself, besides vacant space <lb/>
            and material substance, can possibly be left undiscovered in <lb/>
            the sum of things; no third kind of being, which can at any <lb/>
            time fall under the notice of our senses, or which any one can <lb/>
            find out by the exercise of his reason.</p>
          <p>For whatsoever other things are said to be,1 you will find <lb/>
            them to be either necessary ADJUNCTS of these two things, <lb/>
            or accidents of them. A necessary ADJUNCT is that which can <lb/>
            never be separated and disjoined from its body without a dis­ <lb/>
            union attended with destruction to that body; as the weight <lb/>
            of a stone, the heat of fire, the fluidity of water; sensibility to <lb/>
            touch in all bodies, insensibility to touch in empty space. On <lb/>
            the other hand, such things as slavery, poverty, riches, liberty, <lb/>
            war, concord, and other things, by the coming or going of <lb/>
            which the nature of the subject affected remains uninjured, <lb/>
            these we are accustomed (as is proper) to call ACCIDENTS.</p>
          <p>Time, likewise, is not an existence in itself, but it is merely <lb/>
            our understanding that collects from things themselves what <lb/>
            HAS BEEN DONE in the past age; what also is PRESENT ; what, <lb/>
            moreover, MAY FOLLOW afterwards. And it must be owned <note type="footnote">I For whatsoever other things are said to be, &amp;c.] Ver. 450. These <lb/>
            observations about adjuncts, and events or accidents, are sufficiently <lb/>
            clear to require no comment. The observations about Helen being <lb/>
            carried off, &amp;c., are, says Creech, nugæ dialectice, which Lucretius <lb/>
            would not have inserted, but that to oppose the Stoics made it <lb/>
            necessary. </note> <pb n="23"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. I. 463—488."/> <lb/>
            that no one has conceived of time existing by itself apart from <lb/>
            progressive motion and quiet rest.</p>
          <p>Moreover, when writers say that Helen WAS carried off, and <lb/>
            that the Trojan people WERE subdued in war, we must take <lb/>
            care lest, perchance, those writers induce us to admit that <lb/>
            those events, viz. the abduction of Helen and the subjugation <lb/>
            of the Trojans, WERE of themselves; when time, irrevocably <lb/>
            past, has carried away those generations of men, of whom <lb/>
            these transactions were the events or accidents. For what­ <lb/>
            ever shall have been done, will properly be called an event <lb/>
            or accident, whether occurring to lands, or to legions1 (that is, <lb/>
            men) themselves.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, if there were not this bodily substance in <lb/>
            things, nor this room and space in which all things severally <lb/>
            are done, the flame lighted up by the love of Helen's beauty, <lb/>
            spreading through the breast of the Phrygian Paris, would <lb/>
            never have kindled the famous contests of cruel warfare; nor <lb/>
            would the wooden horse have secretly set fire to the citadel <lb/>
            of the Trojans by a nocturnal delivery of Greeks. So that <lb/>
            you may plainly see that all transactions whatsoever do not <lb/>
            CONSIST or EXIST of themselves, as body does, nor are spoken of <lb/>
            as existing in the same way as a vacuum exists; but rather <lb/>
            that you may justly call them events or accidents of body, or <lb/>
            of space in which all transactions are brought to pass.</p>
          <p>Bodies, besides, are partly original elements 2 of things, and <lb/>
            partly those which are formed of a combination of those ele­ <lb/>
            ments. But those which are elements of things, no force can <lb/>
            break; for they successfully resist all force by solidity of sub­ <lb/>

            any thing of so solid a substance can be found in nature; for <lb/>
            the lightning of heaven passes through the walls of houses, as <lb/>
            also noise and voices pass; iron glows, being penetrated by <lb/>
            heat, in the fire; rocks often burst with fervent heat; the <lb/>
            hardness of gold, losing its firmness, is dissolved by heat; the <lb/>
            icy coldness of brass, overcome by flame, melts; heat, and <lb/>
            penetrable cold, enter into the substance of silver, for we <lb/>
            have felt both with the hand, when, as we held silver cups <lb/>
            after our fashion,1 water was poured into them from above; so <lb/>
            that, as far as these instances go, there seems to be nothing <lb/>
            solid in nature. But because, however, right reason, and the <lb/>
            nature of things, compel me to hold a contrary opinion, grant <lb/>
            me your attention a while, until I make it plain, in a few <lb/>
            verses, that there really exist such bodies as are of a solid <lb/>
            and eternal corporeal substance; which bodies we prove to be <lb/>
            seeds and primary particles of things, of which the whole <lb/>
            generated universe now consists.</p>
          <p>In the first place, since a two-fold nature 2 of two things, a <lb/>
            two-fold nature, or rather two natures extremely dissimilar, <lb/>
            has been found to exist, namely, matter, and space in which <lb/>
            every thing is done, it must necessarily be that each exists by <lb/>
            itself for itself, independently of the other, and pure from ad­ <lb/>
            mixture; for wheresoever there is empty space, which we call <lb/>
            a vacuum, there there is no matter, and, likewise, wheresoever <lb/>
            matter maintains itself, there by no means exists empty <lb/>
            space. Original substances are therefore solid and without <lb/>
            vacuity.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, since in things which are produced,3 or com- <note type="footnote"> 1 As we held silver cups after our fashion.] Ver. 496. Manu reti­ <lb/>
            nentes pocula rite. I have added the word silver from Creech's in­ <lb/>
            terpretation. Lucretius seems to have had in his imagination a <lb/>
            guest at a feast, holding up his cup partly filled with wine, for an <lb/>
            attendant to pour hot or cold water into it. They mixed cold water <lb/>
            with their wine in summer, and hot in winter. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the first place, since a two-fold nature, &amp;c.] Ver. 504. Solid <lb/>

            body; and in space which is filled with solid body there can be no <lb/>

            pounded of matter, there is found empty space, solid matter must <lb/>
            exist around it; nor can any thing be proved by just argu­ <lb/>
            ment to conceal vacuity, and to contain it within its body, <lb/>
            unless you admit that that which contains it is a solid. But <lb/>
            that solid can be nothing but a combination of matter, such <lb/>
            as may have the power of keeping a vacuity enclosed. That <lb/>
            matter, therefore, which consists of solid body, may be eternal, <lb/>
            while other substances, which are only compounds of this mat­ <lb/>
            ter, may be dissolved.</p>
          <p>In addition, too,1 if there were no space to be vacant and <lb/>
            unoccupied, all space would be solid. On the other hand, <lb/>
            unless there were certain bodies to fill up completely the places <lb/>
            which they occupy, all space, which any where exists, would <lb/>
            be an empty void. Body, therefore, is evidently distinct from <lb/>
            empty space, though each has its place alternately; since all <lb/>
            space neither exists entirely full, nor, again, entirely empty. <lb/>
            There exist, therefore, certain bodies which can completely fill <lb/>
            the places which they occupy, and distinguish empty space <lb/>
            from full.</p>
          <p>These bodies, which thus completely fill space, can neither <lb/>
            be broken2 in pieces by being struck with blows externally, nor, <lb/>
            again, can be decomposed by being penetrated internally; nor <lb/>
            can they be made to yield if attempted by any other method; <lb/>
            a principle which we have demonstrated to you a little above; <lb/>
            for neither does it seem possible for any thing to be dashed in <lb/>
            pieces without a vacuum, nor to be broken, nor to be divided <lb/>
            into two by cutting ; nor to admit moisture, nor, moreover, <lb/>
            subtle cold, nor penetrating fire, by which operations and <note type="footnote"> combination of solid original particles; and, though this compound <lb/>
            solid may be dissolved, yet the original solid atoms of which it is <lb/>
            composed remain imperishable. This I consider to be the drift of <lb/>
            the argument in. the text, which, perhaps from some corruption, <lb/>
            seems not very clear. Lambinus has this comment: "Generated <lb/>
            things have vacuity within them ; otherwise they would not perisb <lb/>
            or be dissolved. But if they perish because they have vacuity in <lb/>
            them, there must yet be matter in which there is no vacuity, solid <lb/>
            and indissoluble, lest all things should be reduced to nothing. " </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In addition, too. &amp;c.] Ver. 521. There must be body that <lb/>
            completely fills space, or how would empty space be distinguished <lb/>
            from full ? </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These bodies — can neither be broken, Ver. 529. Since, <lb/>
            then, there are solid bodies, they must be eternal; for, since they <lb/>
            contain no vacuity, how can they be broken or dissolved ? </note> <pb n="26"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. I. 537—565."/> <lb/>
            means all things compounded are dissolved. And the more <lb/>
            any thing contains empty space within it, the more it yields <lb/>
            when thoroughly tried by these means. If, therefore, the <lb/>
            primary atoms are solid and without void, they must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity be eternal.</p>
          <p>Again, unless there had been eternal matter, 1 all things, before <lb/>
            this time, would have been utterly reduced to nothing ; and <lb/>
            whatsoever objects we behold would have been reproduced <lb/>
            from nothing. But since I have shown above, that nothing <lb/>
            can be produced from nothing, and that that which has <lb/>
            been produced cannot be resolved into nothing, the primary <lb/>
            elements must be of an imperishable substance, into which <lb/>
            primary elements every body may be dissolved, so that matter <lb/>
            may be supplied for the reproduction of things. The pri­ <lb/>
            mordial elements, therefore, are of pure solidity; nor could <lb/>
            they otherwise, preserved, as they have been, for ages, re­ <lb/>
            pair things, as they have done, through that infinite space of <lb/>
            time which has elapsed since the commencement of this material <lb/>
            system.</p>
          <p>Besides, if nature had set no limit2 to the destruction of <lb/>
            things, the particles of matter would, by this time, have been <lb/>
            so reduced, by reason of every former age wasting them, that <lb/>
            no body compounded of them could, from any certain time, <lb/>
            however remote, reach full maturity of existence. For <lb/>
            we see that any thing may be sooner taken to pieces than put <lb/>
            together again; for which reason, that which the infinitely <lb/>
            long duration of all past time had broken into parts, disturb­ <lb/>
            ing and dissevering it, could never be repaired in time to <lb/>

            tain limit to destruction, since we see every thing recruited, <lb/>
            and stated portions of time assigned to every thing according <lb/>
            to its kind, in which it may be able to attain full vigour <lb/>
            of age. <note type="footnote"> 1 Again, unless there had been eternal matter, &amp;c.] Ver. 541. <lb/>
            Had there been no such solid and imperishable bodies, things must, <lb/>

          <p>To this is added,1 that though the primary particles of mat­ <lb/>
            ter are perfectly solid, yet that all things, which are formed of <lb/>
            them, may be rendered soft and yielding, as air, water, earth, <lb/>
            fire (in whatever way they may be produced, and by what­ <lb/>
            ever influence they may be directed); but this happens be­ <lb/>
            cause there is vacant space intermingled with the substance of <lb/>
            things compounded. But, on the other hand, if the primordial <lb/>
            elements of things were soft, how strong flints and iron could <lb/>
            be produced, no explanation could be given, for, by this <lb/>
            supposition, nature will be deprived of all possibility of com­ <lb/>
            mencing a foundation. The primordial elements, therefore, <lb/>
            are endowed with pure solidity; by the dense combination of <lb/>
            which all compound bodies may be closely compacted, and <lb/>
            exhibit powerful strength.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if you still persist2 to say that no limit has been <lb/>
            appointed to the dissolution of bodies, you will then, however, <lb/>
            have to allow that there must remain certain dissoluble bodies <lb/>
            in the world, which have not yet been assailed with any trial <lb/>
            of their strength. But since dissoluble bodies are endued only <lb/>
            with a fragile nature, it is inconsistent to suppose that they <lb/>
            could have lasted through an infinite course of time, if they <lb/>
            had been harassed, age after age, with innumerable assaults.</p>
          <p>Further, since also a limit3 has been assigned for the growth <lb/>
            of things according to their kinds, and for their support of <lb/>
            life; and since it is established by the laws of Nature what <lb/>
            each kind can or cannot do; and since nothing is changed, but <lb/>
            all things remain constant to such a degree, that even the <lb/>
            birds of different plumage, all in succession, show, existing <lb/>
            upon their bodies, spots distinctive of their species; we must <note type="footnote"> 1 To this is added, &amp;c.] Ver. 566. The original atoms are not <lb/>

            soft, how would hard bodies be generated from them ? </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Moreover, if you still persist, &amp;c.] Ver. 578. But if you will <lb/>

            there are dissoluble bodies which have not yet been assailed by any <lb/>
            power sufficient to destroy them; but to conceive that such bodies <lb/>
            exist, and that they have not been attacked, among all the changes <lb/>
            in things since the beginning of time, by any force sufficient to take <lb/>

            could be changed, by being successfully wrought upon in any <lb/>
            way, it would then also become uncertain what might or might <lb/>

            The extreme point of a body is the first part of it, if you reckon <lb/>

          <p>Primordial atoms are therefore of pure solidity, which, <lb/>
            composed of the smallest points, closely cohere; not combined <lb/>

            allows nothing to be broken off, or even diminished, reserving <lb/>
            these primordial atoms as seeds for her productions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, unless there shall be some LEAST,' some point <note type="footnote"> been for the authority of Lambinus, I was inclined to render it the <lb/>

            Præterea, nit erit MINIMUM. It is observed by Locke, (Essay, <lb/>
            book ii. chap. 23, § 31,) that " the infinite divisibility of matter <lb/>
            whether we grant or deny it, involves us in inexplicable conse­ <lb/>
            quences." If we allow that matter, that is, any portion of matter, <lb/>
            is infinitely divisible, we admit that afinite body contains an infinite <lb/>
            number of parts; if we affirm that it is not infinitely divisible, we <lb/>
            say, that after a certain number of divisions, we come to a por­ <lb/>
            tion of matter which has no parts ; for that which has parts <lb/>
            must be divisible into those parts. (See Reid's Inquiry into the <lb/>
            Human Mind.) From this difficulty the Epicureans cleared them­ <lb/>
            selves, by asserting that there are certain least possible quantities <lb/>
            of matter; quantities which are of course indivisible, and which <lb/>
            are the atoms of which all things are constituted. " Observe," <lb/>
            says Bayle, (Art. Zeno, note G,) " that those who espouse the <lb/>
            hypothesis of atoms, do not do it because they apprehend that <lb/>
            an extended body may be simple, but because they believe <lb/>
            * * other hypotheses to be impossible." This is the case with <lb/>
            Lucretius; he says that there have from the first been atoms, into <lb/>
            which matter may be divided, but which cannot themselves be <lb/>
            divided; and were there not such atoms, he asks, or were there no <lb/>
            limit to the division of matter, how could substances be kept dis­ <lb/>
            tinct, or how could things be preserved at all? How far the dis­ <lb/>
            coveries of modern chemistry uphold the hypothesis of atoms, is <lb/>
            well known. See infrà, on ver. 626. </note><note type="footnote"> Sir Isaac Newton admitted the same sort of atoms as Epicurus, <lb/>
            referring their origination, however, to an Almighty power. " It <lb/>
            seems probable," says he, " that God, in the beginning, formed <lb/>
            matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, moveable particles, of <lb/>
            such sizes, figures, and with such other properties, and in such pro­ <lb/>

            where division ends, the smallest bodies will individually con­ <lb/>
            sist of infinite parts, as, in that case, any part of the half of <lb/>
            any body1 will always have its own half; nor will any thing <lb/>
            set a limit to this division. What, therefore, will be the dif­ <lb/>

            Universe, be infinite, yet the smallest things which exist in it <lb/>
            will equally consist of infinite parts. To which position since <lb/>

            rarefied, if the parts of fire retained the same nature which <lb/>
            the whole of fire still has.1 For though there might be a <lb/>
            fiercer heat in the condensed parts, and a more languid warmth <lb/>

            will then have the capability to be condensed, or left rare­ <lb/>

            there are many things adverse to them and their doctrines, <lb/>
            and therefore shrink from admitting a pure vacuum to exist <lb/>

            stant elements, which always retain the same nature, by <lb/>
            the departure and accession of which, and by their change <lb/>
            of order, things alter their nature, and compound bodies con­ <lb/>
            vert themselves into a different consistence, it is easy to under­ <lb/>
            stand that these elements of things are not fiery. For it <lb/>
            would be to no purpose that some of these elements should <lb/>
            detach themselves and depart from one place, and be as­ <lb/>
            signed to another, and that some should have their order <lb/>
            changed, if they all still retained the nature of fire, for <lb/>
            whatever fire might produce would be in all forms only fire. <lb/>
            But, as I am of opinion, the truth stands thus: There are <lb/>
            certain elementary bodies, whose combinations, movements, <lb/>
            order, position, shapes, produce fire, and which, when their <lb/>
            order is changed, change their nature as a compound; nor, <lb/>
            as I think, are they in themselves like to fire, or to any other <lb/>
            thing, which has the power of emitting particles to our senses, <lb/>
            and affecting our touch by its application.</p>
          <p>To say, moreover, that all things are fire, and that no real <lb/>
            substance exists in the whole number of things but fire, (an <lb/>
            assertion which this philosopher makes,) seems to be in the <lb/>
            highest degree absurd. Since he himself, while arguing from <lb/>
            his senses, combats against his senses,1and shakes the credit <lb/>
            of those perceptions, on which all things that we believe de­ <lb/>
            pend, and by the aid of which that which he names fire is <lb/>
            known to him. For he believes that his senses distinguish <lb/>
            fire accurately; other things, which are not at all less clear, <lb/>
            he does not believe that they can distinguish; an inconsistency <lb/>
            which seems to me both folly and madness. For to what <lb/>
            shall we refer for information ? What can be a more certain <lb/>
            criterion to us than the senses themselves ? How, if we cease <lb/>
            to trust them, can we distinguish what is true, and what is false ?</p>
          <p>Besides, why should any one rather set aside all other <lb/>
            things, and desire to admit the substance of fire as the only <lb/>
            substance, than deny that fire exists, and still allow existence <lb/>
            to all other substances ?2 For to advance either assertion, <lb/>

            and divinely, they gave oracles, as it were, from the inmost- <lb/>
            temple of their heart, more sacredly, and with much more <lb/>
            true reason, than the Pythia who speaks from the tripod and <lb/>
            laurel of Phœbus, yet stumbled2 in attempting to expound the <lb/>
            principles of things, and, great as they were, fell there with <lb/>
            a heavy downfal. In the first place they erred, because they <lb/>
            settle that motion may take place, though all vacuum be ex­ <lb/>
            cluded from matter, and because they admit that there exist <lb/>
            soft and subtle bodies, (air, sun, fire, earth, animals, vegetable <lb/>
            productions,) and yet mingle no vacuity in their composition. <lb/>
            Secondly, they erred, because they assert that there is no limit <lb/>
            at all to the division of material-particles, and that no bound <lb/>
            is set to their fracture; nor do they at all allow that any LEAST <note type="footnote"> ing to Havercamp was written in Latin: " That part (of Italy) <lb/>

            namely, the extreme point of every body, which seems to be <lb/>
            least to our senses; so that you may hence conclude that <lb/>
            there exists in bodies a least possible quantity, which you <lb/>
            yourself cannot perceive, but which, nevertheless, they have <lb/>
            as an extreme.</p>
          <p>To this is also added, that they make the elements of things <lb/>
            to be soft bodies, which soft bodies we see to be generated, and <lb/>
            altogether of a perishable consistence. But if the elements of <lb/>
            things were soft and perishable, the whole universe must fall <lb/>
            back to nothing,1 and the abundance of things flourish by <lb/>
            being re-produced from nothing. But how far each of these <lb/>
            suppositions is distant from the truth, you have already had <lb/>
            proof.</p>
          <p>Besides, these four elements are in many ways hostile2 and <lb/>
            destructive to one another; for which reason, on coming to­ <lb/>
            gether, they will either be naturally destroyed, or will start <lb/>
            away from one another, as we see, when a tempest has arisen, <lb/>
            the lightnings, and rains, and winds, not congregating together, <lb/>
            but scattering themselves abroad.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if all things'are produced from those four bodies,3 <lb/>
            and all things are again dissolved into those bodies, how can <lb/>
            those four be more justly called the primary elements of <lb/>
            things, than, on the other hand, things may be called the pri­ <lb/>
            mary elements of them, and a backward computation, as it <note type="footnote"> I Whore universe must fall back to nothing.] Ver. 757. If the <lb/>

            produced alternately, and change their appearance, and their <lb/>
            whole substance among themselves, perpetually. But if <lb/>
            perchance you imagine that the substances of fire and earth, <lb/>
            and ethereal air and the liquid of water, meet together in <lb/>
            such a way that by their combination they make no change <lb/>
            in their nature, nothing will be produced for you from them, <lb/>
            neither animated creature, nor any thing of inanimate sub­ <lb/>
            stance, as a tree; for each element in the conflux of the vary­ <lb/>
            ing heap will exhibit only its own nature, and air will be seen <lb/>
            to remain mixed together with earth and with some portion <lb/>
            of liquid ;1 but primary elements, for the production of things, <lb/>
            must exercise a latent and unapparent influence, lest any <lb/>
            element arise above the rest, which may resist their action, <lb/>
            and prevent whatsoever is being formed from being able to <lb/>
            attain its proper character.</p>
          <p>These philosophers, moreover, take a beginning from heaven <lb/>
            and its fires, and make fire first to change itself into the air <lb/>
            of the sky; from air they say that water is produced, and that <lb/>
            earth is generated from water; and then they say again that <lb/>
            all things return back from earth, first water, afterwards air, <lb/>
            then heat; and that these elements do not cease to interchange, <lb/>
            and to pass from heaven to earth, and from earth to the stars <lb/>
            of heaven; which primary elements ought by no means to <lb/>
            do. For it is necessary that there should remain something <lb/>
            unchangeable, lest all things should be reduced utterly to <lb/>
            nothing. Since whatsoever, being changed, goes beyond its <lb/>
            own limits, this change becomes forthwith the death or ter­ <lb/>
            mination of that which it was before. Wherefore, since these <lb/>
            four bodies which we have previously mentioned, pass into <lb/>
            changer they must necessarily consist of other elements which <lb/>
            cannot be changed in any way, lest all things should return, as <lb/>

            and nourished by certain substances, and other and other <lb/>
            things are nourished by certain substances; because, as is <lb/>
            evident, many common elements of many things3 are mixed in <lb/>

            moreover, that gold may consist of crumbs of gold, and that <lb/>
            earth may be a concrete of little earths ;that fire may be from <lb/>
            fires, and moisture from moistures. Other things he ima­ <lb/>
            gines and supposes to be produced in a similar way. Yet he <lb/>
            does not allow that there is any where a void in things, or <lb/>
            that there is any limit to the division of bodies. Wherefore <lb/>
            in both these respects he seems to me to err equally with those <lb/>
            of whom we have before spoken.</p>
          <p>Add to this, that he supposes principles which are too frail, <lb/>
            if, indeed, they are principles which are made to be endowed <lb/>
            with like nature as the things themselves that are produced <lb/>
            from them, and equally suffer and decay; nor does any thing <lb/>
            withhold them from destruction. For what portion of them <lb/>
            will endure under violent oppression, so as to escape dissolu­ <lb/>
            tion under the very teeth of death ? Will it be fire, or moisture, <lb/>
            or air ? which of these ? Or will it be blood, or bone ? Not one <lb/>
            of all those substances, as I conceive; since every thing uni­ <lb/>
            versally will be equally perishable as those things which we <lb/>
            see manifestly perish from before our eyes, when overcome <lb/>
            by any violence. But I call to witness the positions which I <lb/>
            have before proved, that neither can things be reduced to no­ <lb/>
            thing, nor again grow up from nothing.</p>
          <p>Moreover, since food augments and nourishes the body, we <lb/>
            may understand that veins, and blood, and bones, and nerves, <lb/>
            consist of heterogeneous parts. Or, if these philosophers shall <lb/>
            say that all food is of a mixed substance, and contains in itself <lb/>
            small elements of nerves and bones, and also veins and par­ <lb/>
            ticles of blood, it will follow, that both all solid food, and <lb/>
            liquid itself, must be thought to consist of such heterogeneous <lb/>
            matters, and to be mixed up of bones, and nerves, and veins, <lb/>
            and blood. Besides, if whatever bodies grow from the earth <lb/>
            are previously latent in the earth, earth must consist of <lb/>
            all those heterogeneous matters which spring from earth. <lb/>
            Transfer this reasoning to other objects, and you may likewise <lb/>
            use the same phraseology: in wood, for instance, if there is <note type="footnote"> ossa et cutem est." Servius ad Virgo Æn. vii 253. The text <lb/>
            might be rendered, "flesh is generated from small and minute <lb/>
            fleshes.”Evelyn took it in the sense of entrails: " That entrails do <lb/>
            of little entriazls breed." </note> <pb n="42"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B I 873—889"/> <lb/>
            concealed flame, and smoke, and ashes, wood must necessarily <lb/>
            consist of the heterogeneous particles of those substances.</p>
          <p>Here some slight opportunity is left to this sect of philoso­ <lb/>
            phers for eluding the arguments of their adversaries; an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of which Anaxagoras avails himself, by alleging that <lb/>
            although he thinks all things lie-secretly mixed with all <lb/>
            things, yet that that alone appears on the surface of each, of <lb/>
            which there are most particles mixed in the composition of <lb/>
            each, and placed more as it were in readiness and in front; <lb/>
            which, however, is far removed from just reasoning. For, if <lb/>
            this hypothesis were correct, it might-naturally-be-expected <lb/>
            also that corn, when it is broken by the overwhelming force <lb/>
            of the mill-stone,1 would exhibit some token of bloody or some­ <lb/>
            thing of those substances which are nourished in our bodies; <lb/>
            (that when we rub stone against stone, blood should flow;) <lb/>
            in like manner, also, it would be probable that herbs would <lb/>
            send forth drops of a sweet liquid, and of similar taste, such <lb/>
            as are the drops of milk, that issue from the udder of the <lb/>
            sheep. And, without doubt, we might also suppose that fre­ <lb/>
            quently, when clods of earth are broken, rudiments of the <lb/>
            several kinds of herbs, and corn, and leaves of trees would ap­ <lb/>
            pear scattered about, and be proved to lie hid in the earth in <note type="footnote"> 1 Overwhelming force of the mill-stone.] Ver. 880. Minaci robore <lb/>

            and blood is produced in our bodies by the medium of corn, surely <lb/>
            we should, says Lucretius, on crushing corn, sometimes find drops <lb/>
            of blood in it. What follows, " that when we rub stone against stone <lb/>
            blood should flow,”Quum lapidem in lapidem terimus manare cruorem, <lb/>
            is a verse which Faber, Preiger, Havercamp, and Bentley concur <lb/>
            in condemning as spurious, and which, though preserved and de­ <lb/>
            fended by Wakefield, even Forbiger himself, following Eichstadt, <lb/>
            has ventured to include in brackets. It evidently encumbers the <lb/>
            text uselessly. " It seems to have been written in the margin," <lb/>

            minute particles ; moreover that in wood, when it is broken, <lb/>
            ashes, and smoke, and small particles of fire would be found <lb/>
            to lie concealed. Of which occurrences, since manifest expe­ <lb/>
            rience shows that none take place, we may understand that <lb/>
            substances are not so mixed with substances; but, if Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras were right, the common seeds of many things must lie <lb/>
            secretly mixed, in many ways, among other things.</p>
          <p>But, you will say, it often happens that on the high moun­ <lb/>
            tains, the extreme tops of tall trees, when near to one another, <lb/>
            are rubbed together, the strong south winds compelling them <lb/>
            to act thus, until they shine with a flash of flame bursting <lb/>
            forth. It is so. And yet the fire is not inherent in the wood, <lb/>
            but there are in it many seeds of heat, which, when they have <lb/>
            become confluent by friction, produce a conflagration in the <lb/>
            woods. But if positive flame1 were hidden in the woods, the <lb/>
            fire could not be concealed for any length of time, but would <lb/>
            openly consume the forests, and burn up the groves.</p>
          <p>Do you now see, therefore, (what we remarked a little be­ <lb/>
            fore,) that it is frequently of great consequence with what <lb/>
            other elements and in what position the same elements are <lb/>
            combined, and what motions they reciprocally impart and re­ <lb/>
            ceive ? And that the same elements a little altered2 in respect <lb/>
            to each other, produce fire from wood, ignes è lignis, just as <lb/>
            also the words themselves consist of elements or letters a lit­ <lb/>

          <p>Finally, if you think that whatever things you see in the <lb/>
            visible world, could not be conceived to have been formed <lb/>
            without supposing the primary particles of matter to be en­ <lb/>

          <p>And now give me your attention as to what remains; <lb/>
            learn and hear more fully and plainly. Nor does it escape <lb/>
            my knowledge how obscure these matters are; but the <lb/>

            me to pluck the fresh flowers, and to obtain a distinguished <lb/>
            chaplet for my head from those groves whence the Muses have <lb/>
            hitherto veiled the temples of no one. In the first place, be­ <lb/>

            will either pass beyond it, or will be stopped by some opposing <lb/>

            of necessity admit and adopt; of which alternatives either <lb/>
            cuts off escape from you, and compels you to grant that the <lb/>
            WHOLE extends without limit. Since whether there is any <lb/>
            thing to stop the javelin, and to cause that it may not go on in <lb/>
            the direction in which it was aimed, and fix itself at the destined <lb/>
            termination of its flight, or whether it is borne onwards be­ <lb/>
            yond the supposed limit, it evidently did not begin-its-flight <lb/>
            from a boundary of the WHOLE. In this manner I will go on <lb/>
            with you, and wheresoever you shall fix the extreme margin <lb/>
            of space, I will ask you what then would be the case with the <lb/>
            javelin. The case will be, that a limit can no where exist; <lb/>
            and that room for the flight of the javelin will still extend <lb/>
            its flight.</p>
          <p>Further, if all the space of the entire WHOLE were shut-in <lb/>
            and bounded on all sides by certain limits, the quantity of <lb/>
            matter in the universe would before this time have flowed <lb/>
            together to the bottom, by reason of its solid weight; nor <lb/>
            could any thing be carried on beneath the canopy of heaven; <lb/>
            nor, indeed, would there be a heaven at all, or light of the <lb/>
            sun; for all matter, from sinking down for an infinite space <lb/>
            of time, would be accumulated at the bottom of the WHOLE. <lb/>
            But now, it is evident, no rest is given to the atoms of the <lb/>
            primary-elements; because no part of the universe is com­ <lb/>
            pletely and fundamentally lowest, whither the atoms might, as <lb/>
            it were, flow together, and where they might fix their seat; <lb/>
            and therefore all things are always carried on in all parts in <lb/>
            perpetual motion, and the lowest atoms of matter, or those <lb/>
            which we may conceive to be the lowest, stirred up from the <lb/>
            infinite of space, are supplied for the generation of things.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in things before our eyes, object seems to bound <lb/>
            object; the air sets-a-boundary-to the hills, and the hills to <lb/>
            the air; the land limits the sea, and the sea, on the other <lb/>
            hand, limits the entire land; but, as to the WHOLE, there is <lb/>
            nothing beyond it that can bound it. The nature, therefore, <lb/>
            of space, and the extent of the profound whole, is such a vast, <lb/>
            which neither famous rivers,1 in their course, can run through, <note type="footnote"> I Famous rivers.] Ver. 1002. Clara flumina.—“ Celebres fluvii," <lb/>

            though flowing for an eternal length of time, nor, by passing <lb/>
            on, can at all cause that less distance should remain for them <lb/>
            to go. To such a degree, on every side, vast abundance of <lb/>
            room lies open for all things, all limit being set aside every <lb/>
            where and in every direction.</p>
          <p>Besides, Nature herself prevents the WHOLE OF THINGS <lb/>
            from being able to provide bounds for itself, inasmuch as she <lb/>
            compels body to be bounded by that which is vacuum, and <lb/>
            that which is vacuum to be bounded by body; that so, by this <lb/>
            alternate bounding of one by the other, she may render ALL <lb/>
            infinite.1 Else, moreover, if one or other of these did not <lb/>
            bound the other by its simple nature, so that one of them, the <lb/>
            vacuum for instance, should extend unlimited, neither the sea, <lb/>
            nor the land, nor the bright temples of heaven,2 nor the race <lb/>
            of mortals, nor the sacred persons of the gods, could subsist <lb/>
            for the small space of an hour. For the body of matter, <lb/>
            driven abroad from its union, would be borne dispersed <lb/>
            through the mighty void, or rather, in such a case, never <lb/>
            having been united, would never have produced any thing, <lb/>
            since, when originally scattered, it could not have been <lb/>
            brought together.</p>
          <p>For certainly neither the primary elements of things dis­ <lb/>
            posed themselves severally in their own order, by their own <lb/>
            counsel or sagacious understanding; nor, assuredly, did they <lb/>
            agree among themselves what motions each should produce; <note type="footnote"> I Render all infinite.] Ver. 1010. Infinita omnia reddat. " Uni­ <lb/>

            but because, being many, and changed in many ways, they <lb/>
            are for an infinite space of time agitated, being acted upon by <lb/>
            forces, throughout the WHOLE, they thus, by experiencing <lb/>
            movements and combinations of every kind, at length settle <lb/>
            into such positions, by which means, (i. e. positions,)1 this SUM <lb/>
            of things, being produced, exists. And this sum of things, <lb/>
            when it was once thrown into suitable motions, being also <lb/>
            maintained in that state through many long years, causes that <lb/>
            the rivers recruit the greedy sea with large floods of water, <lb/>
            and that the earth, cherished by the heat of the sun, renews <lb/>
            its productions; also that the race of living creatures flour­ <lb/>

            Which effects atoms could by no means produce, unless an <lb/>
            abundant supply of matter could arise from the infinite of <lb/>
            space, whence every thing that is produced is accustomed to <lb/>
            repair in time the parts lost. For as the nature of animals, <lb/>
            when deprived of food, wastes and decays, losing its substance, <lb/>
            so must all things fall away, as soon as matter, turned by any <lb/>

          <p>Nor can impacts,4 as some may imagine, produced externally <lb/>
            on all sides, keep together the entire WHOLE, or whatever of <lb/>
            matter has been combined into a whole. For though some <lb/>

            sures from without, and that the highest and lowest parts, as <lb/>
            we call them, cannot be resolved, or thrown back in any direc­ <lb/>
            tion, because all things strive towards the middle; (if, indeed, <lb/>
            you DO believe that any thing, as the earth, according to them, <lb/>
            can rest upon itself in the middle; and that those heavy bodies <lb/>
            which are on the lower part of the earth, all tend upwards, or <lb/>
            to the centre, and rest upon the earth, although placed in a re­ <lb/>
            verse position to ourselves, like the shadows of things which we <lb/>
            every day see in the water, with their lower parts uppermost.) <lb/>
            And in like manner they contend that the animals beneath us <lb/>
            range about with their feet upwards, nor can fall back from <lb/>
            the earth into the lower parts of heaven, more than our bodies <lb/>

            that they share the times of heaven, the hours of light and <lb/>

          <p>Having exhorted Memmius to the study of philosophy, vert 1—60, Lucre­ <lb/>
            tius proceeds to treat of the properties of atoms, of which the first it <lb/>
            motion, which they owe either to their own weight or the impulse of other <lb/>
            atoms, ver. 60—87. Atoms are borne downwards, as being heavy, and <lb/>
            when solid atoms come in collision, they must necessarily rebound; some <lb/>
            unite with others; those that unite closely, form bodies hard and dense; <lb/>
            those that combine more loosely, thin and subtle substances, ver. 88—107. <lb/>
            Some do not coalesce, but wander continually through space, impelling <lb/>
            and agitating other atoms, ver. 108—140. The swiftness of atoms, ver. <lb/>
            141—166. He attacks those who deny the Epicurean doctrine of atoms, <lb/>
            and refuse to admit that this unchangeable order of things is maintained <lb/>
            without a divine providence, ver. 167—183. Atoms in their course down­ <lb/>
            wards decline a little from the right line, 184—221. Were they not to <lb/>
            decline, nothing would be produced, and there could be no free agency <lb/>
            in animals when produced, vert 222—271. Atoms are still borne on in <lb/>
            the same way in which they have moved from all eternity; nor is this <lb/>
            assertion to be disputed because all things seem at rest, ver. 272—332. <lb/>
            The second remarkable property of atoms is figure; how greatly they <lb/>
            differ in this is shown by the vast variety of things produced from them, <lb/>
            ver. 332—425. Some atoms are rough and jagged, others smooth and <lb/>
            round; some produce bitter and some sweet, some hard and some soft <lb/>
            bodies, vert 426—476. But the figures of atoms are not infinite, though <lb/>
            the number of each figure is infinite, ver. 477—580. Shows that com­ <lb/>
            pound bodies contain atoms of different figures, and alludes to the natural <lb/>
            history of the earth, and the fabulous history of Cybele, ver. 580—728. <lb/>
            Atoms have not those qualities which we call sensible qualities, as colour, <lb/>
            taste, heat, cold, &amp;c., though they generate bodies having those qualities, <lb/>
            ver. 729—1021. The infinite number of atoms, moving through the in­ <lb/>
            finite of space, compose infinite worlds, which are sometimes increased by <lb/>
            atoms being added, and sometimes diminished and dissolved by the separ­ <lb/>
            ation and departure of atoms, ver. 1022—1149; just as, before our eyes, <lb/>
            plants and animals grow up, decline, and perish, ver. 1150—1172.</p><pb n="54"/>

          <p>IT is sweet, when the winds1 disturb the waters on the vast <lb/>

            not because it is a joyous pleasure that any one should be-made­ <lb/>

            But if we see that such suppositions and expectations are ridi­ <lb/>
            culous and merely objects of derision, and that in reality the <lb/>
            fears and pursuing cares of men dread neither the sound of <lb/>
            arms nor cruel weapons, and mingle boldly among kings and <lb/>
            rulers of affairs, nor shrink before the brightness gleaming <lb/>
            from gold, or the shining splendour of a purple garment, why <lb/>
            do you doubt but that to produce these effects is wholly the <lb/>
            office of reason,1 especially when all our life labours under the <lb/>
            darkness of ignorance ? For as children tremble 2 and fear <lb/>
            every thing in thick darkness, so we, in the light, fear some­ <lb/>
            times things which are not more to be feared than those <lb/>
            which children dread, and imagine about to happen, in the <lb/>
            dark. This terror of the mind, therefore, it is not the <lb/>
            rays of the sun or the bright arrows of day that must dis­ <lb/>
            pel, but the contemplation of nature, and the exercise of <lb/>
            reason.</p>
          <p>Attend now, therefore, and I will explain to thee by what <lb/>
            motions 3 the generative bodies of matter produce various things, <lb/>
            and resolve them when produced; and by what force they <lb/>
            are thus compelled to act, and what activity has been com­ <lb/>
            municated to them for passing through the mighty void <lb/>
            of space. Do thou remember to give thyself wholly to my <lb/>
            words.</p>
          <p>For, assuredly, matter does not constantly cohere as being <lb/>
            closely condensed in itself, since we see every object dimin­ <lb/>
            ished, and perceive that all things flow away, as it were, <lb/>
            through length of time, and that age withdraws them from our <note type="footnote"> tempus "time," though Lambinus said that if it were genuine it <lb/>

            eyes; while, nevertheless, the sum of all seems to remain un­ <lb/>
            decayed. And this happens for this reason, that the particles <lb/>
            of matter which depart from each object, lessen the object from <lb/>
            which they depart, and endow with increase the object or objects <lb/>
            to which they have transferred themselves; and oblige the <lb/>
            former to decay, but the latter, on the contrary, to flourish. <lb/>
            Nor do they continue always in the place to which they have <lb/>
            gone; and thus the sum of things is perpetually renewed, and <lb/>
            the races of mortal men subsist by change and transference <lb/>
            from one to the other. Some nations increase, others are di­ <lb/>
            minished, and, in a short space of time, the tribes of living <lb/>
            creatures are changed by successive generations, and, like the <lb/>
            racers, deliver the torch 1 of life from hand to hand.</p>
          <p>If you think that the elemental-atoms of things can remain <lb/>
            at rest, and can, by remaining at rest, generate fresh motions <lb/>
            of things, you stray with a wide deviation from true reason. <lb/>
            For, since the primary-particles of all things wander through <lb/>
            the void of space, they must necessarily be all carried forwards <lb/>
            by their own gravity, or, as it may chance, by the force of <lb/>
            another body; for when, being often moved, they, meeting, <lb/>
            have struck against one another, it happens that they suddenly <lb/>
            start asunder in different directions; since neither is it to be <lb/>
            wondered at that bodies should do so, which are of the ut­ <lb/>
            most hardness, and of solid weight; nor, it is to be observed, <lb/>
            does any thing behind oppose their motion.2 And that you <lb/>
            may the more clearly understand that all the atoms of matter <lb/>
            are tossed about and kept in motion, remember that in the <lb/>
            sum of the whole, or in the entire universe, there is no lowest <lb/>
            place; nor has it any point where the primary atoms may <note type="footnote"> I Like the racers, deliver the torch, &amp;c.] Ver. 78. Et quasi cursores <lb/>

            fly, when struck, far off, and rebound away to great distances; <lb/>
            these supply to us the thin air and radiant light of the sun.</p>
          <p>And many atoms besides wander through the great void, <lb/>
            which are rejected by combinations of bodies, and have no <lb/>
            where been able, admitted into union, to associate their motions <lb/>
            with other atoms. Of which circumstance, as I conceive,2 an <lb/>
            example and image is, from time to time, moving and present <lb/>
            before our eyes. For, behold, whensoever the beams of the <lb/>
            sun pour themselves through a chink into the dark parts of <lb/>
            houses, you will see, in the light of the rays, many minute <lb/>
            particles throughout the open space, mingled together in many <lb/>
            ways, and, as it were, in perpetual conflict, exhibiting battles <lb/>
            and fights, contending in companies, nor allowing any pause <lb/>
            to their strife, being agitated by frequent concussions and se­ <lb/>
            parations ; so that you may conjecture, from this spectacle, <lb/>
            what it is for the primary-particles of things to be perpetually <note type="footnote"> 1 Proved by indisputable argument.] Ver. 93. Certâ et rations <lb/>

            ought perhaps to adopt. </note> <pb n="59"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 122—151"/> <lb/>
            tossed about in the great void. Assuredly a small thing may <lb/>
            give an example, and traces leading to the knowledge of great <lb/>
            things. On this account it is more fitting that you should give <lb/>
            your attention to these motes which seem to confuse one an­ <lb/>
            other in the rays of the sun ; because such disorders signify that <lb/>
            there secretly-exist tendencies to motion also in the principles <lb/>
            of matter, though latent and unapparent to our senses. For <lb/>
            you will see there, among those atoms is the sun-beam, many, <lb/>
            struck with imperceptible forces, change their course, and turn <lb/>
            back, being repelled sometimes this way, and sometimes that, <lb/>
            every where, and in all directions. And doubtless this er­ <lb/>
            rant-motion 1 in all these atoms proceeds from the primary <lb/>
            elements of matter; for the first primordial-atoms of things <lb/>
            are moved of themselves ; and then those bodies which <lb/>
            are of light texture, and are, as it were, nearest to the na­ <lb/>
            ture of the primary elements, being urged by secret im­ <lb/>
            pulses of those elements, are put into motion, and these lat­ <lb/>
            ter themselves, moreover, agitate others which are somewhat <lb/>
            larger. Thus motion ascends from the first principles, and <lb/>
            spreads forth by degrees, so as to be apparent to our senses, <lb/>
            and so that those atoms are moved before us, which we <lb/>
            can see in the light of the sun; though it is not clearly <lb/>
            evident by what impulses they are thus moved.</p>
          <p>And now, 0 Memmius, what activity and swiftness of mo­ <lb/>
            tion2 has been given to the original atoms of matter, you may <lb/>
            learn from what follows. In the first place, when Aurora <lb/>
            sprinkles the earth with new light, and the various birds, flit­ <lb/>
            ting through the pathless groves, fill every part, amid the soft <lb/>
            air, with their liquid notes; how suddenly, at such a time, the <lb/>
            rising sun, overspreading all things, is wont to clothe them with <lb/>
            his rays, we observe to be visible and manifest to all. But that <lb/>
            heat, and clear light, which the sun sends forth, do not pass <lb/>
            through mere empty space; on which account, it is compelled <lb/>
            to go more slowly, because it has thus to force a passage <note type="footnote"> 1 And doubtless this errant-motion, &amp;c.] Ver. 131. Scilicet hied <lb/>

            " In this manner all other parts of matter are tossed and wander <lb/>

            through the flood of air; nor do the particles of heat pass <lb/>
            every one singly, but connected and combined together; for <lb/>
            which reason they are, at the same time, both retarded by <lb/>
            one another, and externally obstructed, so as to be obliged <lb/>
            to proceed less rapidly. But the primordial-atoms, which are <lb/>
            of pure solidity,1 when they pass through empty spaced and <lb/>
            nothing external retards them; and when, moreover, they <lb/>
            themselves, being one and uncompounded in all their parts, <lb/>
            are to that one place borne onwards, by their own tendency,3 <lb/>
            to which they have begun to proceed, must be thought, it is <lb/>
            evident, to excel in swiftness, and to be carried forwards <lb/>
            much more rapidly than the light of the sun, and to run <lb/>
            through a much greater region of space 4 in the same time as <lb/>
            the beams of the sun traverse the heaven. For neither have <lb/>
            they to delay, being retarded by deliberation how they shall <lb/>
            proceed, nor have they to pursue the neighbouring atoms one <lb/>
            after the other, that they may learn by what method every <lb/>
            thing is to be done.</p>
          <p>But some ignorant persons, in opposition to these opinions, <lb/>
            think that the nature of matter cannot, without the will and <lb/>
            providence of the gods, be ordered so suitably to human plans <lb/>
            and conveniences, as to change the seasons of the year, and to <lb/>
            produce the fruits of the earth, and to effect also other things <lb/>
            in which the directress of life, divine Pleasure, prompts mor­ <lb/>
            tals, and herself leads them, to engage; so that they may pro­ <lb/>
            pagate their kind through the allurement of gratification, <lb/>
            lest the race of men should perish. For whose sake, when <lb/>
            they imagine that the gods settled all things, they seem in all <lb/>
            respects to have departed far from just reasoning. For though <lb/>
            I were ignorant what the primary-elements of things were, <lb/>
            yet this I could venture to assert from a contemplation of the <note type="footnote"> I Of pure solidity.] Ver. 156. Solidâ—simplicitate. “ Of solid aim. <lb/>

            nature of heaven itself, and to demonstrate from many other <lb/>
            things, that the world was by no means made for us by divine <lb/>
            power ; although these opinions incur reprehension among <lb/>
            the generality of mankind. Which matters, 0 Memmius, I <lb/>
            will make clear to you hereafter; we will now explain what <lb/>
            remains to be said concerning the motions of atoms.</p>
          <p>This is now the place, as I think, in discussing these sub­ <lb/>
            jects, to make plain to you, that no corporeal substance can, of <lb/>
            its own proper force, be borne and advance upwards ; lest the <lb/>
            particles of flame should deceive you in this matter. For <lb/>
            though they are produced upwards, and take increase upwards, <lb/>
            yet also the smiling corn, and groves, have their growth up­ <lb/>
            wards ; though all weights, as far as is in them, are borne down­ <lb/>
            wards. Nor, when fire springs up to the roofs of houses, and <lb/>
            consumes the beams and rafters with a swift flame, is it to be <lb/>
            thought that it does so without a compelling force; as is the <lb/>
            case, for example, when blood, sent forth from our body, <lb/>
            spouts out, springing up on high, and sprinkling abroad a <lb/>
            purple stream. Do you not see, also, with how strong a force <lb/>
            the liquid substance of water repels beams and logs of wood ? <lb/>
            Do you not observe how, the more we have, on any occasion, <lb/>
            urged them straight downwards, and have powerfully pressed <lb/>
            them down with great force and with difficulty, so the more <lb/>
            eagerly the water casts them back and sends them upwards, <lb/>
            so that they rise up and leap forth with a larger portion of their <lb/>
            substance?1 And yet we do not doubt, I suppose, that these <lb/>
            bodies, as far as is in them, are all borne downwards through <lb/>
            empty space. Thus, accordingly, flames must also have the <lb/>
            power to rise, when driven up, through the air of heaven, al­ <lb/>
            though their own weights, as far as is in them, strive to draw <lb/>
            them downwards. Do you not, moreover, see that meteors in <lb/>
            the night, flying through the height of heaven, draw long tracks <lb/>
            of flame in whatever directions nature has given them a passage ? <lb/>
            Do you not see shooting stars fall to the earth ? The sun, also, <lb/>
            from the highest point of the sky, spreads abroad his heat on <note type="footnote"> 1 Leap forth with a larger portion of their substance.] Ver. 200. <lb/>
            Plus ut parte foras emergant exsiliantque. " They naturally rose above <lb/>
            the water at first with a certain portion of their bulk; but, after <lb/>
            being pressed down, they start up above it with a still greater por­ <lb/>
            tion." Wakefield. </note> <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 211—238"/> <lb/>
            all sides, and covers the fields with his light ? The heat of <lb/>
            the sun, therefore, also tends downwards to the earth. And <lb/>
            you observe likewise the lightnings fly through the oblique <lb/>
            showers; the fires, bursting from the clouds, rush sometimes <lb/>
            in one way, sometimes in another; and the body of flame falls <lb/>
            very frequently to the earthy</p>
          <p>In reference to these subjects, also, we wish you to under­ <lb/>
            stand this; that the particles-of-matter, when they are borne <lb/>
            downwards straight through the void of space, do for the most <lb/>
            part, by their own weights, at some time, though at no fixed <lb/>
            and determinate time, and at some points, though at no fixed <lb/>
            and determinate points, turn aside2 from the right line, but <lb/>
            only so far as you can call the least possible deviation.</p>
          <p>But unless the atoms were accustomed to decline from the <lb/>
            right line, they would all fall straight down, through the void <lb/>
            profound, like drops of rain through the air; nor would there <lb/>
            have been any contact produced, or any collision generated <lb/>
            among the primary-elements; and thus nature would never <lb/>
            have produced any thing.</p>
          <p>But if, perchance, any one believes that the heavier bodies, <lb/>
            as being borne, more swiftly, straight through the void of <lb/>
            space, might fall from above on the lighter ones, and thus <lb/>
            produce concussions, which might give rise to generative <lb/>
            movements, he deviates and departs far from just reasoning. <lb/>
            For whatsoever bodies fall downwards through the water and <lb/>
            the air, they, of necessity, must quicken their motions accord­ <lb/>
            ing to their weights, inasmuch as the dense consistence of <lb/>
            water, and the subtle substance of the air, cannot equally re­ <lb/>
            tard every body, but yield sooner to the heavier bodies, being <lb/>
            overcome by them. But, on the contrary, a pure vacuum can <lb/>
            afford no resistance to any thing, in any place, or at any time, <lb/>
            but must constantly allow it the free passage which its nature <lb/>
            requires. For which reason all bodies, when put into motion, <note type="footnote"> 1 Falls very frequently to the earthy Ver. 215. Cadit in terras— <lb/>

            it necessary to make them, or some of them, deviate from the straight <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 239—259."/> <lb/>
            must be equally borne onwards, though not of equal weights, <lb/>
            through the unresisting void. The heavier atoms will, there­ <lb/>
            fore, never be able to fall from above on the lighter, nor, of <lb/>
            themselves, produce concussions which may vary the motions <lb/>
            by which nature performs her operations.</p>
          <p>For which cause, it must again and again be acknowledged <lb/>
            that atoms decline a little from the straight course, though it <lb/>
            need not he admitted that they decline more than the least <lb/>
            possible space; lest we should seem to imagine oblique <lb/>
            motions, and truth should refute that supposition. For this <lb/>
            we see to be obvious and manifest, that heavy bodies, as far <lb/>
            as depends on themselves, cannot, when they fall from above, <lb/>
            advance obliquely ; a fact which you may yourself see. But <lb/>
            who is there that can see1 that atoms do not at all turn them­ <lb/>
            selves aside, even in the least, from the straight direction of <lb/>
            their course ?</p>
          <p>Further, if all motion is connected and dependent, and a <lb/>
            new movement perpetually arises from a former one in a cer­ <lb/>
            tain order, and, if the primary-elements do not produce any <lb/>
            commencement of motion by deviating from the straight line <lb/>
            to break the laws of fate, so that cause may not follow cause <lb/>
            in infinite succession, whence comes this freedom of will to all <lb/>

            Whence is our liberty of action? Ask of the atoms themselves : <lb/>
            if their motion be invariably direct, there arises from this motion a <lb/>
            chain of fate and necessity; if there be collision, (supposing collision <lb/>
            to take place withperfectly direct motion,) there arises from it the <lb/>
            same necessity. To declension from the right line only, therefore, <lb/>
            can liberty of action be attributable." Creech. See Cicero do Fato, <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 260-291"/> <lb/>
            in any fixed part of space, but just as our mind has prompted <lb/>
            us. For doubtless, in such matters, his own will gives a com­ <lb/>
            mencement of action to every man; and hence motions are <lb/>
            diffused through the limbs. Do you not see also, that when <lb/>
            the barriers on the race-course are set open at a certain in­ <lb/>
            stant, yet the eager strength of the horses cannot spring for­ <lb/>
            ward so suddenly as the inclination itself desires ? For the <lb/>
            whole mass of matter throughout the whole body, excited <lb/>
            in all the members, must be collected,l and roused simul­ <lb/>
            taneously into action, that it may second the desire of the <lb/>
            mind in connexion with it ; so that you may see that the <lb/>
            commencement of motion is produced from the heart, and that <lb/>
            the tendency to act proceeds in the first place from the in­ <lb/>
            clination of the mind, and is thence spread onwards through <lb/>
            the whole body and its members.</p>
          <p>Nor is this similar to the case in which we go forwards, <lb/>
            when impelled by a blow, from the great strength and violent <lb/>
            compulsion of another person, for then it is evident that the <lb/>
            whole matter of the entire body moves, and is hurried on­ <lb/>
            wards, against our consent, until the will, acting throughout <lb/>
            the members, has reined it back. Do you now see, therefore, <lb/>
            that although external force drives along many men, (that is, <lb/>
            often drives men along,) and compels them frequently to go <lb/>
            forwards against their will, and to be hurried away headlong, <lb/>
            yet that there is something in our breast which can struggle <lb/>
            against and oppose it; according to the direction of which, <lb/>
            also, the aggregate of matter within us is at times obliged to <lb/>
            be guided throughout our several limbs and members, and. <lb/>
            when driven forward, is curbed, and sinks down into rest? <lb/>
            Wherefore you must necessarily confess that the same is the <lb/>
            case in the seeds of matter, and that there is some other cause <lb/>
            for motion besides strokes and weight, from which this power <lb/>
            is innate in them, since we see that nothing can be produced <lb/>
            from nothing. For weight forbids that all effects should be <lb/>

          <p>Nor was the general body of matter ever more condensed <lb/>
            together, or, on the other hand, distributed in parts at greater <lb/>
            intervals, than it is at present. For to that body neither does <lb/>
            any increase ever take place, nor is any diminution made from <lb/>
            it through decay. For which reason, in whatever motion the <lb/>
            atoms of primordial seeds are now, in the same motion they <lb/>
            were in past time, and hereafter will always be moved in a <lb/>
            similar manner; and whatever things have been wont to be <lb/>
            produced, will still be produced under like circumstances, and <lb/>
            will exist, and grow, and acquire strength, as far as has been <lb/>
            granted to each by the laws of nature; nor can any influence <lb/>
            change the sum of things. For neither is there any part of <lb/>
            space to which any kind of matter can fly off from the WHOLE, <lb/>
            nor, again, is there any part from which any new force, hav­ <lb/>
            ing arisen there, can burst in upon the WHOLE, and thus <lb/>
            change the entire order of things and alter its movements.</p>
          <p>In these matters, it is not at all to be regarded as wonder­ <lb/>
            ful, why, when all the primordial-elements of things are in <lb/>
            motion, yet the WHOLE of things seems to stand in perfect <lb/>
            rest, except whatever individual thing exhibits motion in its <lb/>
            own body.2 For the entire nature of original-principles lies <lb/>
            far removed from our senses, and beneath them; for which <lb/>
            cause, when you cannot see the thing itself, its motions must <lb/>
            also hide themselves from your eyes; especially when even <lb/>
            many things that we can see, nevertheless often conceal their <lb/>
            motions from us, as being separated from us by a great dis­ <lb/>

            by manifold shapes. Not that a few only are endowed with; <lb/>

            great differences. Nor is this wonderful; for since the abund­ <lb/>

            For, on many occasions, a calf, sacrificed at the frankin­ <lb/>

            the gods, pouring forth a warm stream of blood from its <lb/>
            breast; but the mother, meanwhile, deprived of her young, <lb/>
            wandering through the green forests, leaves traces imprinted <lb/>
            on the ground with her cloven feet, surveying all places with <lb/>
            her eyes, if any where she may discern her lost offspring, and <lb/>
            then, standing still, fills the leafy grove with her complaints; <lb/>
            she also frequently goes back to look at the stall, penetrated <lb/>
            with regret for her calf; nor are the tender willows, or the <lb/>
            grass fresh with dew, or any streams, gliding level with the <lb/>
            top of their banks, able to soothe her feelings, and drive away <lb/>
            her sudden affliction ; nor can any other forms of calves, over <lb/>
            the fertile pastures, divert her attention or lighten her of her <lb/>
            care; so perseveringly does she require some shape that is <lb/>
            familiar and known to her. Moreover, the tender kids, with <lb/>
            their tremulous voices, know, as they plainly indicate, their <lb/>
            horned dams, and sheep distinguish the bleating of the butting <lb/>

            with gentle waves, strews the bibulous sand on the winding <lb/>
            shored Again and again, therefore, I repeat, the primordial <lb/>
            atoms of things, since they exist in their own nature, and are <lb/>
            not fashioned to a certain shape by the hand of one artificer, <lb/>
            must likewise circulate through the universe in certain shapes <lb/>
            dissimilar one from another.</p>
          <p>It is very easy for us, then, by the clear guidance of rea. <lb/>
            son, to explain why the flame of lightning passes through the <lb/>
            air with much more penetration than our fire, which arises <lb/>
            from fuel of the earth. For you may justly argue that the <lb/>
            celestial fire of lightning, as being more subtle, consists of <lb/>
            smaller atoms, and therefore flies through diminutive passages, <lb/>
            which this fire of ours, taking its rise from wood, and pro­ <lb/>
            duced by torches, cannot enter.</p>
          <p>Besides, light passes through horn, but water is repelled <lb/>
            by it. Why? unless that the atoms of light are less than <lb/>
            those of which the genial liquid of water consists.</p>
          <p>Wine, also, we observe to flow as quickly as possible through <lb/>
            a strainer, but thick oil, on the contrary, moves through it <lb/>
            slowly; because, as it appears, the latter either consists of <lb/>
            larger atoms, or of such as are more hooked and involved <lb/>
            with one another. And thus it happens, that the individual <lb/>
            atoms, not being so quickly detached from their coherence <lb/>
            with each other, cannot so easily pass through the individual <lb/>
            pores of any body.</p>
          <p>To this is added, that the liquids of honey and milk are <lb/>
            moved about in the mouth with a pleasant sensation to the <lb/>
            tongue; but, on the contrary, the bitter substance of worm­ <lb/>
            wood, and acrid centaury,2 torment the palate with a disa­ <lb/>
            greeable taste; so that you may easily infer that those things <lb/>
            which can affect the senses with pleasure, consist of smooth <lb/>
            and round particles; but that, on the other hand, whatever <lb/>
            things seem bitter and rough, are held united together of par. <note type="footnote"> 1 Strews the bibulous sand, &amp;c.] Ver. 376. Litoris incurvi bibulam <lb/>

            melodious notes of music, which musicians form upon the <lb/>
            strings, awaked, as it were, by their swiftly-moving fingers; <lb/>
            and that you may not suppose that atoms of like form pene­ <lb/>
            trate the nostrils of men, when they burn offensively-smelling <lb/>
            carcasses, and when the stage is freshly sprinkled with Cilician <lb/>
            saffron,1 and the altar, near at hand, exhales Panchæan odours. <lb/>
            Nor conceive that pleasing colours, which can feast the eye <lb/>
            with delight, and those which are, as it were, pungent to the <lb/>
            sight, and compel us to shed tears, or which seem ugly and <lb/>
            hideous with a repulsive look, consist of like seminal-atoms. <lb/>
            For every object, whatever it be, that soothes the sense ot <lb/>
            the beholders, is not produced without some smoothness in its <lb/>
            elements, but, on the contrary, whatever is of a disagreeable <lb/>
            and rough consistence, has not been formed without something <lb/>
            offensive in its material-principles.</p>
          <p>There are some atoms, also, which are neither justly <lb/>
            thought to be smooth, nor altogether hooked with bent <lb/>
            points, but rather to be furnished with small angles slightly <lb/>
            jutting out, and which have the power rather to titillate the <lb/>

            pointed in different ways, the touch of each is a sufficient <lb/>
            indication. For the touch, the touch, (0 sacred deities of <lb/>

            confound the sense; as if, for example, you yourself should <lb/>
            strike any part of your own body, and make trial of this <lb/>

            their elementary-principles.</p>
          <p>Further, those bodies that seem to us hard and dense, must <lb/>
            necessarily consist of particles more locked with one another, <lb/>

            Among which kind of bodies, adamantine rocks, naturally- <lb/>

            and round particles are mixed pungent particles causing <lb/>
            pain. Nor yet is it necessary that these atoms should hold <lb/>
            themselves together by being hooked; for you may be certain <lb/>
            that though the particles are rough, they are yet globose, so <lb/>
            that they may flow among those of the fluid, though at the same <lb/>
            time they may hurt the sense. And that you may the more cer­ <lb/>
            tainly believe that rough are mixed with smooth particles, of <lb/>
            both of which, for instance, the mass of the waters of the <lb/>
            ocean consists, there is, I may mention, a method of separating <lb/>
            them and considering them apart. The same water of the sea, <lb/>
            for example, becomes sweet,2 when it is often filtered through <lb/>
            the earth, so that it may flow, as you may sometimes see, into <lb/>
            a trench, and thus lose its saltness. For it leaves above, or near <lb/>
            the surface of the earth, the particles of bitter salt, which are <lb/>
            rough and jagged; so that they more easily inhere in the <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>Which point since I have now demonstrated, I shall proceed <lb/>
            to join with it another proposition, which, depending on this, <note type="footnote"> I May have a pungent effect upon the body.] Ver. 460. Pun­ <lb/>

            derives its creditfrom it; that the primary-atoms of things vary <lb/>
            in figure, but only with a limited number of shapes.1 If this <lb/>
            were not so, some seminal-principles would, moreover, necessa­ <lb/>
            rily he of an immense bulk of body. For this is evident, be­ <lb/>
            cause within the same individual minute-frame of any one <lb/>
            seminal-principle, the figures or arrangements of its parts <lb/>
            cannot vary much among themselves. Since, suppose that the <lb/>
            primary-principles consist of a certain definite number of very <lb/>
            small parts; say three, or increase them, if you please, by a <lb/>
            few more; assuredly when, after arranging all those parts, <lb/>
            and altering the place of the highest and lowest parts of that <lb/>
            one body, anti changing the right for the left, you shall have <lb/>

            wish still further to vary its forms, you will have to add <lb/>
            other parts; and from thence will follow, in like manner, that <lb/>
            a third arrangement will require still more, if you shall wish <lb/>
            by a third arrangement still to vary its forms. An increase of <lb/>
            bulk, therefore, follows upon the variation of shapes; for <lb/>
            which reason you cannot believe that seminal-principles differ <lb/>
            from one another by an infinite variety of shapes; lest, by such <lb/>
            a supposition, you should make some to be of immense bulk; <lb/>
            which I have already shown that it is not possible to prove.</p>

            lyre, would, in like manner, be silenced, as being outdone by <lb/>
            something new; for, in every class of things, some new thing <lb/>
            might arise more excellent than others which are now thought <lb/>
            the best</p>
          <p>Or all things might also fall back into a worse state, as we <lb/>
            have said that they might possibly rise to a better. For, in a <lb/>
            retrograde order, one thing might arise, time after time, more <lb/>
            disagreeable than others preceding it, to the nostrils, ears, <lb/>
            and eyes, and taste of the palate.</p>
          <p>Since this, however, is not so, but a certain limit set to <lb/>
            things in both directions, as to what is bad and what is good, <lb/>
            confines the whole, you must of necessity admit that the <lb/>
            particles of matter also vary from one another only by shapes <lb/>
            that are finite in number.</p>
          <p>Lastly, a distance, so to speak, has been defined from the <lb/>
            heat of summer1 to the freezing cold of winter, and has been <lb/>
            measured back from cold to heat in like manner. For the <lb/>
            whole year is, or consists of, heat and cold ;2 and the moderate <lb/>
            warmths of spring and autumn lie between both the other two <lb/>
            seasons, filling up the whole in succession. The seasons of <lb/>
            spring and autumn, therefore, as made and appointed, are <lb/>
            kept-distinct by a limited portion to each ; since they are <lb/>
            marked on each side by two points, and shut in on the one <lb/>
            hand by heats, and on the other side by rigid frosts.</p>
          <p>Since I have now proved this, I shall proceed to join with <lb/>
            it another observation, which, depending on this, derives its <lb/>
            credit from it; that the primordial-atoms of things, which <lb/>
            are formed of a like figure one to the other, are infinite in <lb/>
            number ; for since the diversity of their forms is finite, it ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily follows that those which are alike are infinite; or it <lb/>
            would appear that the sum of matter must be finite; which <lb/>

            nity,1 by a succession2 of movements on every side.</p>
          <p>For though you see in any particular region certain ani­ <lb/>

            less rare, to be more productive,3 yet in another region and dis­ <lb/>
            trict, and in distant lands, it is possible that there may be many <lb/>
            animals of that kind, and that the deficiency of their numbers <lb/>
            in one place may be compensated in another; just as we see, <lb/>
            in the race of quadrupeds, to be especially the case with the <lb/>
            snake-handed elephants, with many thousands of which India <lb/>
            is defended as with an ivory rampart, so that it cannot be at <lb/>

            that country, but of which we see very few specimens among us.</p>

            in your imagination, any single creature you please, existing <lb/>
            alone with its own natural body, and to which there may be <lb/>

            no method of combining themselves. But, as when great and <lb/>

            give admonition to mortals, to resolve to avoid the treachery, <lb/>

            casion, to be too credulous, when the insidious flattery of the <lb/>
            calm deep smiles; so if you, in this case, shall once settle <lb/>
            for yourself that certain primordial atoms are finite in number, <lb/>
            you must then allow that the different agitations of matter will <lb/>
            necessarily toss them about, scattered, as they will be, for ever; <lb/>
            so that they can at no time, being driven together, unite in <lb/>
            combination, or, if they should unite, remain in combination, or <lb/>
            swell with increase ; both of which effects manifest proof shows <lb/>
            to occur before our eyes, namely, that things are produced, and <lb/>
            that, when produced, they have the power to increase. It is <lb/>
            therefore evident, that, in every class of beings, the primordial- <lb/>
            elements of things, from which all are supplied, are infinite <lb/>
            in number.</p>
          <p>Nor, therefore, inasmuch as original-elements are infinite, <lb/>
            can the movements of things, which are destructive to vital <lb/>
            existence, always prevail, or bury its safety for ever; though <lb/>
            neither, on the other hand, can motions productive of gener­ <lb/>
            ation and increase, always preserve things which have been <lb/>
            formed. Thus a war of principles, grown up from the infi­ <lb/>
            nite space of the past, is carried on with equal strife; the <lb/>
            vital principles of things prevail sometimes in one place, <lb/>
            sometimes in another, and are prevailed over in their turn. <lb/>
            The wail which infants raise, when they come forth to view <lb/>

          <p>In considering these points, it is- proper for you, also, to <lb/>
            have it impressed, as with a seal, upon your mind, and to keep <lb/>
            it faithfully intrusted to your memory, that there is nothing, <lb/>
            among all objects of which the nature is apparent before us, <lb/>
            which consists only of one kind of elements; nor any thing, <lb/>
            which does not consist of mixed seminal-principles. And <lb/>
            whatever possesses in itself more numerous powers and ener­ <lb/>
            gies than other things, thus demonstrates that it contains more <lb/>
            numerous kinds of primary-particles and various configura­ <lb/>
            tions of them.</p>
          <p>In the first place, the earth has in itself primary atoms, from <lb/>
            which springs, rolling forth cool waters, incessantly recruit the <lb/>
            immense sea; it has also in itself atoms from which fires arise. <lb/>
            For in many places, the soil of the earth, when set on fire, <lb/>
            burns; and the violence of Ætna rages with mighty flames. <lb/>
            Moreover, the earth contains atoms from which it can raise up <lb/>
            rich corn and cheerful groves for the tribes of men ; and from <lb/>
            which also it can afford waving leaves and abundant pasturage <lb/>
            for the brood of wild beasts ranging over the mountains. For <lb/>
            which reasons the earth alone is called the great mother of the <lb/>
            gods, and mother of beasts, and parent of the human race.</p>
          <p>The old and learned poets of the decks sung that she, in <lb/>
            her seat on her chariot, drives two lions yoked together; sig­ <lb/>
            nifying that the vast earth hangs in the open space of the air, <lb/>
            and that one earth cannot stand upon another earth. They <lb/>
            added the lions, because any offspring, however wild, ought to <lb/>
            be softened, when influenced by the good offices of parents. <lb/>
            And they surrounded the top of her head with a mural crown, <lb/>
            because the earth, fortified in lofty places, sustains cities ; dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished with which decoration the image of the divine <lb/>
            mother is borne, spreading terror, through the wide world. <lb/>
            Her various nations, according to the ancient practice of their <lb/>
            worship, call the Idæan mother, and assign her bands of <lb/>
            Phrygians as attendants, because they say that from those <lb/>
            parts corn first began to be produced, and thence was diffused <lb/>
            over the globe of the earth. They assign to her also the <lb/>
            Galli; because they wish to intimate that those, who have <lb/>
            violated the sacred-respect due to their mother, and have been <lb/>
            found ungrateful to their fathers, are to be thought unworthy <lb/>
            to bring living offspring into the realms of light. Distended <lb/>
            drums, and hollow cymbal resound in their hands around the <pb n="77"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 620—650."/> <lb/>
            goddess; and their horns threaten with a hoarse noise, while <lb/>
            the hollow pipe excites their minds with Phrygian notes. <lb/>
            And they carry weapons outstretched before them, as signs <lb/>
            of violent rage, which may alarm with terror the undutiful <lb/>
            minds and impious hearts of the crowd, struck with the power <lb/>
            of the goddess.</p>
          <p>As soon, therefore, as, riding through great cities, she, <lb/>
            being dumb, bestows a silent blessing on mortals, they strew <lb/>
            the whole course of the road with brass and silver, enriching <lb/>
            her with munificent contributions ; while they diffuse a shower <lb/>
            of roses, overshadowing the mother and her troop of attend­ <lb/>
            ants. Here the armed band, whom the Greeks call by the <lb/>
            name of Phrygian Curetes, dance round vigorously with ropes,1 <lb/>
            and leap about to their tune, streaming with blood. Shaking <lb/>
            the terrible crests on their heads as they nod, they represent <lb/>
            the Dictæan Curetes, who are formerly said, in Crete, to have <lb/>
            concealed that famous infant-cry of Jupiter, when the armed <lb/>
            youths, in a swift dance around the child, struck, in tune, <lb/>
            their brazen shields with their brazen spears, lest Saturn, <lb/>
            having got possession of him, should devour him, and cause <lb/>
            an eternal wound in the heart of his mother. Either for this <lb/>
            reason, therefore, armed men accompany the great mother; <lb/>
            or else because the priests thus signify that the goddess ad­ <lb/>
            monishes men to be willing to defend the land of their country <lb/>
            with arms and valour, and to prepare themselves to be a pro­ <lb/>
            tection and honour to their parents.</p>
          <p>These pageants, though celebrated as being fitly and excel­ <lb/>
            lently contrived, are yet far removed from sound reason. For <lb/>

            its immortal existence in the most profound tranquillity, far <lb/>
            removed and separated from our affairs; since, being free from <lb/>
            all pain, exempt from all dangers, powerful itself in its own <lb/>
            resources, and wanting nothing of us, it is neither propitiated <note type="footnote"> 1 Dance round vigorously with ropes.] Ver. 631. Inter se forte <lb/>

          <p>The earth, indeed, is at all times void of sense, but, because <lb/>
            it contains the primary elements of many things, it brings <lb/>
            forth many productions, in many ways, into the light of the <lb/>
            sun. If any one, then, shall resolve to call the sea Neptune, <lb/>
            and corn Ceres, and chooses rather to abuse the name of Bac­ <lb/>
            chus, than to utter the proper appellation of wine; let us <lb/>
            concede that such a one may pronounce the orb of the earth <lb/>
            to be the mother of the gods, provided that it still be allowed <lb/>
            to remain its real self.</p>
          <p>But to return, then, to the infinite variety of atoms, the <lb/>
            woolly sheep,1 we often see, cropping the grass from the same <lb/>
            plain, and the warlike brood of horses, and the horned herds, <lb/>
            living under the same part of the canopy of heaven, and <lb/>
            quenching their thirst from the same stream of water, grow <lb/>
            up of dissimilar species, retaining the parent nature; and <lb/>
            all follow habits according to their kinds; so various is the <lb/>
            nature of the matter in each kind of herb; so great is the <lb/>
            variety of particles in each river. Hence, moreover, though, <lb/>
            the same parts, bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, viscera, <lb/>
            and nerves, make up any one you please of all animals, still <lb/>
            these, being very different in themselves, are formed of pri­ <lb/>
            mary-particles of an entirely different figure.</p>
          <p>Further, whatever bodies, being set on fire, burn, show <lb/>
            that there are cherished in their mass, if nothing else, those <lb/>
            various seminal-atoms, from which they are enabled to throw <lb/>
            forth fire and cast up light, and also to put sparks in motion, <lb/>
            and scatter abroad embers.</p>
          <p>Surveying other things with like reasoning, you will ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly find that they conceal in their consistence the seeds <lb/>
            of many things, and contain various conformations of atoms.</p>
          <p>Again, you observe many objects to which both colour and <lb/>
            taste have been assigned, together with smell; especially most <lb/>
            of the gifts which you offer to the gods, when you feel your <lb/>
            mind affected, in a debasing manner,2 with religion. These <note type="footnote"> 1But to return, — the woolly sheep, &amp;c.] Ver. 660. Since different <lb/>

            tain various sorts of seminal principles. </note><note type="footnote"> I In a debasing manner.] Ver. 681. Turpi pacto This is Wake-</note> <pb n="79"/>

            things must therefore consist of various conformations of <lb/>
            atoms; for scent penetrates where juices which excite the <lb/>
            taste do not make a way to the corporeal organs; also juices <lb/>
            by their particular method, and flavour by its particular <lb/>
            method, win their way to the senses; so that you may know <lb/>
            that they arise from different conformations of atoms. Dis­ <lb/>
            similar forms of particles, therefore, combine in one mass, and <lb/>
            things consist of mixed seminal-principles.</p>
          <p>Besides, even in my own verses you see every where many <lb/>
            elements common to many words; though you must neverthe­ <lb/>
            less necessarily acknowledge that the verses and words con­ <lb/>
            sist part of some elements and part of others, differing among <lb/>
            themselves ; not because only a few common letters run through <lb/>
            the words, or because no two words, out of all, are alike in <lb/>
            having any letter in common ; 2 but because, taking the words <lb/>
            throughout, all the letters are not common to all. So likewise <lb/>
            in other matters, many common elements, as they are the pri­ <lb/>
            mary-principles of many things, may yet exist in dissimilar <lb/>
            combinations among themselves; so that the human race, <lb/>
            and the fruits of the earth, and the rich groves, may justly be <lb/>
            considered to consist each of distinct original-particles.</p>
          <p>Nor yet is it to be thought that all particles can be com­ <lb/>
            bined in all ways; for, if this were the case, you would every <lb/>
            where see monsters arise; you would behold shapes produced <lb/>
            half-man half-beast, and sometimes tall boughs of trees grow <lb/>
            out of an animated body ; you would observe many members <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 708- 734."/> <lb/>
            larities it is evident that none occur, since we see that all <lb/>
            things, being produced from certain seeds, by an unerring <lb/>
            generative nature, can, as they grow up, preserve their kind <lb/>
            pure and unmixed.</p>
          <p>And it is plain that this must necessarily be the case ac­ <lb/>
            cording to strict method and laws. For, from the several <lb/>
            sorts of food that are eaten, the particles, suitable to each <lb/>
            animal, pass internally into its limbs and other parts, and, <lb/>
            being there combined, produce motions fitted to that animal. <lb/>
            But, on the other hand, we see that nature throws back upon <lb/>
            the earth those particles which are unsuitable to the animal; <lb/>
            and many, existing in imperceptible substances, escape out of <lb/>
            the body, being wrought upon by the impulses and agitations <lb/>
            of other particles; which effluent particles could neither be <lb/>
            combined in any part, nor consent, and be animated, to par­ <lb/>
            ticipate in the vital movements.</p>
          <p>But lest you should think that animals only are bound by <lb/>
            these laws, a certain order and regularity, let me observe, <lb/>
            keeps all things distinct. For as, throughout the whole of <lb/>
            nature, things dissimilar from one another are individually <lb/>
            produced, so it is necessary that each should consist of a differ­ <lb/>
            ent form of elements. Not that only a few elements are endowed <lb/>
            with like forms, but because all, throughout all bodies, are not <lb/>
            similar to all.</p>
          <p>Since, moreover, seminal particles differ, their intervals, <lb/>
            passages, connexions, weights, impulses, collisions, motions, <lb/>
            must necessarily differ; variations which not only keep dis­ <lb/>
            tinct the bodies of animals, but give peculiarity to the land <lb/>
            and the whole sea, and cause the heaven to differ in nature <lb/>
            from the earth.</p>
          <p>And now attendfurther,1 and receive into your mind my pre­ <lb/>
            cepts which I, with pleasing toil, have collected together. Do <lb/>
            not, by any chance, imagine that those things which you see be <lb/>
            fore your eyes of a white colour consist, because they are white, <lb/>
            of white elemental-atoms; or that those which are black, arc <lb/>
            produced from black seminal-particles; nor suppose that any <lb/>
            objects, which are tinged with any other colour whatsoever, <note type="footnote"> 1 And now attend further, &amp;c.] Ver. 729. " He now proceeds to <lb/>
            show that the primary-atoms are void of colour, and indeed of all <lb/>
            qualities, except shane, size, and weight." Lambinus. This is in <lb/>
            conformity with the doctrine of Epicurus, as given in the Epistle to <lb/>
            Herodotus, in Diog. Laert. book x </note> <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 736—768."/> <lb/>
            wear that colour because their material elements are tinctured <lb/>
            with a hue similar to it. For there is no colour at all in the ele­ <lb/>
            mentary-atoms of matter, either similar to that of the bodies in <lb/>
            which they exist, or dissimilar. Into the nature of which ele­ <lb/>
            mentary atoms, if you think that the mind cannot penetrate, so <lb/>
            as to form an idea of them, because they are without colour, <lb/>
            you wander far away from the truth. Since, when those who <lb/>
            have been born blind, and who have never seen the light of <lb/>
            the sun, yet distinguish substances by the touch, which to <lb/>
            them have seemed unmarked by colours from their earliest <lb/>
            youth, we may understand also that substances actually un­ <lb/>
            tinctured with colour, may be brought under the comprehen­ <lb/>
            sion of our intellect. Moreover whatever objects we ourselves <lb/>
            touch in thick darkness, we do not perceive to be tinged with <lb/>
            any colour at all.</p>
          <p>Since I prove it to be possible that atoms may be colourless, <lb/>
            I will now show that it certainly is so. For every colour is, or <lb/>
            may be, changed into all colours whatsoever; but this is a <lb/>
            transmutation which primordial elements must by no means <lb/>
            undergo ; since it is necessary that there should remain some­ <lb/>
            thing unchangeable, lest all things should be reduced utterly <lb/>
            to nothing. For whatsoever being changed,1 goes beyond its <lb/>
            own limits, this change forthwith becomes the death or termin­ <lb/>
            ation of that which it was before. Be cautious, therefore, <lb/>
            not to tinge the seeds of things with colours, lest all things <lb/>
            for your gratification2 should be reduced to nothing.</p>
          <p>Besides, if no kind of colour has been assigned to primary- <lb/>
            particles, and if they are endowed with various forms, by which <lb/>
            they generate and vary all kinds of colours ; and since, more­ <lb/>
            over, it is of great consequence with what atoms, and in <lb/>
            what configuration, seminal-particles are severally combined, <lb/>
            and what impacts they mutually give and receive; you may <lb/>
            at once, with the greatest ease, render a reason why those <lb/>
            objects which were a while ago of a black colour, may sud­ <lb/>
            denly become of a marble whiteness; as when the sea, after <lb/>
            violent winds have stirred up its waters, is changed in hue, <lb/>
            and boils up into waves white as the whiteness of marble <lb/>
            For you may readily say of any object which we generally <lb/>
            observe to be black, that, when its material-atoms have been <note type="footnote">1 For whatsoever being changed, &amp;c.] Ver. 753. See i. 671. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For your gratification.] Ver. 756. Tibi. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 779—797"/> <lb/>
            disturbed, and the order of the particles changed, and some <lb/>
            taken away and others added, it forthwith becomes possible <lb/>
            that it may seem of a glowing whiteness.1 But if the waters <lb/>
            of the sea consisted of cærulean atoms, they could by no means <lb/>
            become white; for, in whatever way you may disorder and <lb/>
            commingle those atoms which are cærulean, they can never <lb/>
            pass into the colour of marble. But if the atoms which make <lb/>
            up the simple and pure colour of the sea, were tinged with va­ <lb/>
            rious and diverse colours; as frequently we see, from different <lb/>
            forms and dissimilar figures, is formed a perfect square, con­ <lb/>
            sisting of only one figure ; it would follow, that, as in the <lb/>
            square we see the other different figures exist, so in the water <lb/>
            of the sea, or in any other simple and pure colour, we should <lb/>
            see those wholly different and distinct colours, from which <lb/>
            the uniform colour of the sea proceeds.</p>
          <p>Further, the different figures which make up the square, by <lb/>
            no means hinder or prevent the whole outline2 of the com­ <lb/>
            pound figure from being or appearing square; but the various <lb/>
            colours of any substances which make up any compound sub­ <lb/>
            stance, impede and prohibit that whole compound substance <lb/>
            from possibly being of one uniform hue.</p>
          <p>Then, moreover, the reason which prompts and induces us <lb/>
            sometimes to impute colours to primary-particles, namely, that <lb/>
            coloured substances are compounded of them, passes for no­ <lb/>
            thing ; because white substances, as the foam of the sea for <lb/>
            instance, are not necessarily produced from other white sub­ <lb/>
            stances; nor substances which are black, from other black sub­ <lb/>
            stances; but from substances of various colours; and because, <lb/>
            moreover, white substances will more readily arise, and be <lb/>
            produced, from primary-particles of no colour than from pri­ <lb/>
            mary-particles of a black colour, or from particles of any <lb/>
            other colour whatsoever that is adverse and opposed to white.</p>
          <p>Further, since there can be no colours without light, and <lb/>
            the primary-particles of things do not come forth into the <lb/>
            light,3 you may hence feel certain that they are vested with <note type="footnote"> 1 Of a glowing whiteness.] Ver. 771• Candens—et album. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Whole outline.] Ver. 785. Omne extra. " In superficie et am­ <lb/>

            not true, for the primary-particles that are on the surface of things <lb/>
            do come <unclear>fourth</unclear> into the light. " He reasons thus," says Lambinus; </note> <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B II 798—817."/> <lb/>
            no colours at all. For what sort of colour will there possible <lb/>
            exist in thick darkness, when colour is a thing which is <lb/>
            changed in and by mere light, because it appears different, as <lb/>
            it is struck by direct or oblique light ? As the plumage of <lb/>
            doves which is situate round the back of the head, and encir­ <lb/>
            cles the neck, appears of a different colour as it is seen differ­ <lb/>
            ently in the sun. For in one position it is affected so as to be <lb/>
            red with the huC of the bright carbuncle; at another time, in <lb/>
            a certain aspect,1 it is so changed that it seems to mix the <lb/>
            colour of green emeralds with blue. The tail of the peacock, <lb/>
            also, when it is covered with a flood of light, changes its co­ <lb/>
            lours, as it is presented in different ways, in like manner. <lb/>
            And since all these colours are produced by a certain effect of <lb/>
            the light, it must be considered that colour cannot be produced <lb/>
            at all, without that light.</p>
          <p>Since, too, the pupil of the eye2 receives upon itself one <lb/>
            kind of impulse when it is said to perceive a white colour, <lb/>
            and another again, when it perceives black and other colours; <lb/>
            and since it is of no moment, as to the feeling, with what <lb/>
            colour those things, which you touch, are distinguished, but <lb/>
            rather of what shape they are formed, you may conclude that <lb/>
            primary-particles have no need of colours, but have only to <lb/>
            affect the touch differently through the different forms in which <lb/>
            they are combined.</p>
          <p>Besides, since there is no certain kind of colours peculiar3 to <note type="footnote"> " Without light colours are not seen ; primary-atoms are not seen; <lb/>
            therefore primary-atoms are without colour : a syllogism which is <lb/>
            unsound, though all its parts are true." Lambinus was too indul­ <lb/>
            gent ; he should have disputed the minor. The atoms of things are <lb/>
            not seen individually, but they meet the light on surfaces collectively. </note><note type="footnote"> I In a certain aspect ] Ver. 804. Quodam sensu. " As the French <lb/>

            accordingly with all sorts of colours, each in its several kind, <lb/>
            whatsoever it may be ? For, under this supposition, it might <lb/>
            be expected that crows, as they fly, would often shed forth <lb/>
            a white colour from white feathers, and that swans, if spring­ <lb/>
            ing perchance from black atoms, would be born black, or, if <lb/>
            from atoms of any other colour, might be of any other hue <lb/>
            whatsoever, uniform or varied.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the more any body is divided into small parts, <lb/>
            the more you can see its colour by degrees die away and be­ <lb/>
            come extinct, as happens when gold is broken into small frag­ <lb/>
            ments. So purple and scarlet, (by far the brightest of colours,) <lb/>
            when they have been divided thread by thread, are utterly <lb/>
            deprived of lustre. So that you may from this infer, that the <lb/>
            small parts of bodies throw off all colour, before they are re­ <lb/>
            duced to their ultimate-atoms.</p>
          <p>Further, since you grant that all bodies do not emit sound <lb/>
            or smell, it consequently happens that you do not attribute to <lb/>
            all bodies sounds or smells. So, since we cannot see all bodies <lb/>
            with our eyes, we may conceive that certain bodies exist, which <lb/>
            we do not see, as much destitute of colour as others are free <lb/>
            from smell, and void of sound; and that an intelligent mind <lb/>
            can form a notion of these colourless bodies, no less than of <lb/>
            others which are destitute of other qualities and distinctions.</p>
          <p>But that you may not perchance imagine that primary atoms <lb/>
            remain void of colour only, they are also, you may understand, <lb/>
            altogether destitute of heat and cold ;1 and are understood <lb/>
            to be barren of sound, and dry of all moisture; nor do they <note type="footnote"> certain shapes of atoms; for example, that all triangular atoms are <lb/>
            black, all quadrangular atoms blue, &amp;c., but will allow that in each <lb/>
            shape there must be atoms of different colours; for instance, that <lb/>
            among triangular atoms some must be white, some black, some of <lb/>
            intermediate colours. Let us suppose, then, that crows consist <lb/>
            chiefly of triangular atoms; it would hence follow that crows might <lb/>
            be born not black, but white, or green, or blue, or variegated. But <lb/>
            this never happens; atoms are therefore without colour." Lambinus. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Altogether destitute of heat and cold.] Ver. 844. Secreta teporis <lb/>

            send out any odour of their own from their substance. Thus <lb/>
            when you proceed to compound a sweet ointment of amaracus, <lb/>
            and myrrh, and the flower of nard, which breathes nectar to <lb/>
            the nostrils, it is, in the first place, proper to seek, as far as <lb/>
            is convenient, and as far as you may be able to find, the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of inodorous olive oil, which emits no scent to the <lb/>
            nostrils, that it may, as little as possible, by the infection of <lb/>
            any strong smell of its own, corrupt the odours mixed and <lb/>
            digested in its body as a vehicle for them.</p>
          <p>Finally, therefore, it must be granted that the primary-atoms <lb/>
            of things communicate no odour or sound of their own, to the <lb/>
            things to be produced from them, since they can emit from them­ <lb/>
            selves none of these qualities; nor, in like manner, do they emit <lb/>
            any savour at all, or cold or heat. Other qualities, moreover,2 <lb/>
            which are such that they are themselves, and in the bodies with <lb/>
            which they are connected, perishable, as pliancy from soft­ <lb/>
            ness, brittleness from decay, hollowness from tenuity of sub­ <lb/>
            stance, must all, of necessity, be separated from primary-ele­ <lb/>

            on which their entire security may rest, that the whole universe <lb/>
            may not be resolved into nothing.</p>
          <p>And now let me observe that those creatures, whatsoever <lb/>
            they are that we perceive to have sense, you must necessarily <lb/>
            acknowledge to consist wholly of senseless atoms.3 Nor do <lb/>
            manifest appearances,4 which are readily observed, refute this <note type="footnote"> I Sweet ointment of amaracus, &amp;c.] Ver. 847. Sicut amaracini <lb/>

            us by the hand, as it were, and compel us to believe that ani­ <lb/>
            mals, though possessed of sense, are generated, as I say, from <lb/>
            atoms without sense.</p>
          <p>For you may observe living worms proceed from foul dung, <lb/>
            when the earth, moistened with immoderate showers, has <lb/>
            contracted a kind of putrescence; and you may see all other <lb/>
            things besides change themselves, similarly, into other things. <lb/>
            The rivers turn themselves into leaves of trees; and the rich <lb/>
            pastures into cattle; the cattle change their substance into <lb/>
            that of our bodies; and from our bodies the strength of wild <lb/>
            beasts, and the frames of birds, are often augmented. Nature, <lb/>
            therefore, changes all kinds of food into living bodies, and <lb/>
            hence produces all senses of animals in a method not very far <lb/>
            different from that by which she resolves dry wood into flames, <lb/>
            and turns all combustible bodies into fire.</p>
          <p>Do you now understand, therefore, that it is of great im­ <lb/>
            portance in what order the primordial elements of things are <lb/>
            severally placed, and with what other elements being mingled, <lb/>
            they give and receive impulses ?</p>
          <p>Besides, what is it that acts upon your mind, what moves <lb/>
            you, and induces you to express a different opinion, preventing <lb/>
            you from believing that what is possessed of sense is produced <lb/>
            from atoms without sense ? It is, evidently, this: that stones, <lb/>
            and wood, and earthy however mixed together, are neverthe­ <lb/>
            less unable to produce vital sense.</p>
          <p>On these subjects, then, it will be proper for you to remem­ <lb/>

            that senses themselves, are of course3 produced from all atoms in <lb/>

            are to produce a being of sense, and with what shape they <lb/>
            are distinguished; and, in the next place, what they are in <lb/>
            their movements, arrangements, and positions ; of which par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, we, from our imperfect perceptions, see nothing take <lb/>
            place in wood and clods ; and yet these, when they are as it <lb/>
            were rendered putrescent by rain, produce worms, and for <lb/>
            this reason, because the atoms of matter, being driven from <lb/>
            their former arrangements by some new impulse, are combined <lb/>
            in such a manner as makes it indispensable for animals to be <lb/>
            produced.</p>
          <p>Besides, when philosophers determine that a being which has <lb/>
            sense can be produced only from atoms endowed with sense, <lb/>
            they forthwith, accustomed to adopt opinions from others, <lb/>
            make those atoms soft; for all sense is connected with viscera, <lb/>
            nerves, veins, and whatever soft substances we see exist and <lb/>
            grow in a mortal body.</p>
          <p>But let it be supposed, for a moment, that these atoms, of <lb/>
            which animals consist, may, though sensible and soft, remain <lb/>
            eternal. They must then, however, either have sense as parts <lb/>
            of animals,1 or be thought similar to whole animals. But it <lb/>
            cannot be that as parts they have sense of themselves, for every <lb/>
            part and member, if separated from the body, breaks off con­ <lb/>

            but it ought to agree with primordia, (comp. ver. 916,) or to refer to <lb/>
            the primordia in some way. Lambinus and Creech read similia. <lb/>

            spuit." But the reading can hardly be sound. Gifanius proposed <lb/>
            namque aliûm sensus membrorum res petit omnis, which Havercamp <lb/>
            admitted into the text. Lachmann gives something different: <lb/>
            “Quid poeta voluerit," says he, " dubium esse non potest; negat <lb/>
            enim membra singula seorsum sentiri posse, quippe quæ ad aliud <lb/>
            referantur, hoc est, ad animam: neque hoc difficile est ex verbis <lb/>
            leviter corruptis extundere: namque alio sensus membrorum respicit <lb/>

            the hand, when dissevered from us, nor any part of the body <lb/>
            whatsoever, retain alone the sense of the whole body. It re­ <lb/>
            mains, therefore, that they must resemble whole animals, so <lb/>
            that they may be animated with vital sense throughout. But <lb/>
            how, then, will it be possible for them to be called the elements <lb/>
            of things, and avoid the paths to death, when they are of an <lb/>
            animal nature, and, existing themselves in perishable animals, <lb/>
            are one and the same with them?</p>
          <p>Yet if we allow that primordial atoms, though imperishable, <lb/>
            may nevertheless be endowed with sense, they will necessarily <lb/>
            in that case produce nothing but a crewd and multitude of <lb/>
            animals; just as men, cattle, and wild beasts, would be un­ <lb/>
            able to produce by combination severally among themselves, <lb/>
            any thing but men, cattle, and wild beasts. How then could <lb/>
            things inanimate, as trees and metals, be produced? It is <lb/>
            only on this supposition, accordingly,1 (viz. that they can ge- <lb/>
            MeTate nothing but sentient beings,) that we should be obliged, <lb/>
            as far as we see, to allow primordial-atoms to be sentient.</p>
          <p>But if, perhaps, you say that the primordial-atoms, being, <lb/>
            as you think, sentient, lay aside, in combination, their own <lb/>
            proper sense, and take another, what need was there, in that <lb/>
            case, that that should be assigned to them, which is afterwards <lb/>
            taken away? And besides, to recur to an illustration to <lb/>
            which we had recourse before, inasmuch as we see eggs of <lb/>
            animals changed into birds, and worms spring forth when a <lb/>
            kind of putrescence, from immoderate rains, has affected the <lb/>
            ground, we know that animals having senses may be produced <lb/>
            from objects without senses.</p>
          <p>But if any one, perchance, shall say that sentient-beings <lb/>
            may certainly2 arise from senseless atoms, but that this must be <lb/>
            effected by some CHANGE which takes place in those atoms, as <lb/>
            from some new BIRTH, before the sentient being which they con­ <lb/>
            stitute is brought forth into existence, it will be sufficient to <lb/>

            CHANGE is effected without a combination of primordial -atoms ; <lb/>
            for no senses of any animal body can exist before the substanco <lb/>
            itself of the animal is formed; and this is evident, inasmuch <lb/>
            as senseless matter is kept dispersed throughout the air, rivers, <lb/>
            earth, and things produced from the earth; nor, though it may <lb/>
            have united,1 has it so united as to engender in itself those con­ <lb/>
            cordant vital motions, by which the all-observing senses of ani­ <lb/>
            mals being generated, direct and preserve every living creature.</p>
          <p>Besides, a blow inflicted, if heavier2 than nature can endure, <lb/>
            strikes down any animal at once, and has the effect of con­ <lb/>
            founding all sense of the body and of the mind; for the posi­ <lb/>
            tions and connexions of the atoms are dissolved, and the vital <lb/>
            motions are utterly impeded; until at last the matter of the <lb/>
            body, suffering concussion in every member, unlooses from <lb/>
            the body the vital ties of the soul, and drives it forth, scat­ <lb/>
            tered abroad, through every outlet. For what more can we <lb/>
            suppose that an inflicted blow can do, than shake to pieces <lb/>
            and dissolve the several elements that were previously united ?</p>
          <p>It also happens, that when a blow is inflicted with less vio­ <lb/>
            lence, the remains of vital motion often prevail; prevail, 1 <lb/>
            say, over the effects of it, and calm the violent disorders occa­ <lb/>
            sioned by the stroke, and recall every thing again into its <lb/>
            proper channel; and thus dispel, as it were, the movement of <lb/>
            death, when asserting-its-power in the body, and revive the <lb/>
            senses when almost lost and overcome. For under what in­ <lb/>
            fluence, if not under this revival of the sentient motions, can <lb/>
            bodies return to life, the mind being re-established,3 even from <lb/>
            the very threshold of dissolution, rather than depart and pass <lb/>

          <p>Furthermore, since pain happens when the principles of <lb/>
            matter in any living body, disturbed by any force throughout <lb/>
            the viscera or the limbs, are agitated in their situations with­ <lb/>
            in, and driven from their proper places; and since an agree­ <lb/>
            able pleasure succeeds when they return into their places ; it <lb/>
            is but right to infer, that primordial-atoms can be affected <lb/>
            with no pain, and enjoy no pleasure, of themselves; for they, <lb/>
            being primary bodies, do not consist of those combinations of <lb/>
            primary-bodies, the motions of which suffer pain, or receive <lb/>
            enjoyment of gentle pleasure, from alteration. Primordial <lb/>
            atoms, therefore, must not be considered as endowed with <lb/>
            any sense whatever.</p>
          <p>Besides, if, in order that animals may severally have sense, <lb/>

            cachinnation, and sprinkle their faces and cheeks with distil­ <lb/>
            ling tears; they, moreover, can tell much of the mixture of <lb/>
            bodies, and inquire, besides, what are their own elements. <lb/>
            For, as they resemble entire men, compounded of elements, <lb/>
            they themselves must also be compounded of other elements; <lb/>
            and these others must be composed of others again, so that, <lb/>
            reckoning thus, you would never make a stop, but go on to in­ <lb/>
            finity. For I shall pursue the argument, and demand that <lb/>
            whatever you shall admit to speak, and laugh, and under­ <lb/>
            stand, must consist of other elements exercising the same <lb/>
            powers. But if we plainly see such reasoning to be absurd <lb/>
            and insane; and if a being can laugh that is compounded <lb/>
            of elements which do not laugh, and can understand, and <lb/>
            render a reason in intelligible words, though he be not com­ <lb/>
            pounded of intelligent and eloquent seminal-principles, why <lb/>
            may not all those creatures which we observe to be sentient <lb/>
            around us, be compounded of seminal-atoms wholly destitute <lb/>
            of sense?</p>
          <p>Finally, we are all sprung from celestial seed; the father <lb/>
            of all is the same ÆTHER, from which, when the bountiful <lb/>
            earth has received the liquid drops of moisture, she, being <lb/>
            impregnated, produces the rich crops and the joyous groves, <lb/>
            and the race of men; produces all the tribes of beasts; since <note type="footnote"> 1 Laugh, shaking their sides, &amp;c ] Ver. 976. See i. 918. </note> <pb n="91"/>

            she supplies them food, by means of which they all support <lb/>
            their bodies, and lead a pleasant life, and propagate offspring ; <lb/>
            on which account she has justly obtained the name of Mother. <lb/>
            That, also, which first arose from the earth, returns back into <lb/>
            the earth; and that which was sent down from the regions of <lb/>
            the sky, the regions of the sky again receive when carried back <lb/>
            to them; nor does death so put an end to things as to destroy <lb/>
            the atoms of matter, but only disunites their combinations, <lb/>
            and produces new unions of particles, and is the cause that <lb/>
            all things so change their forms, and vary their colours, and <lb/>
            receive perception, and in a moment of time yield it up again. <lb/>
            So that you may understand it to be of the greatest import­ <lb/>
            ance with what elements, and in what position and connexion, <lb/>
            the same primordial-atoms of things are combined, and what <lb/>
            impulses they mutually give and receive; (nor suppose that <lb/>
            the primary particles of things cannot remain eternal, because <lb/>
            we see them fluctuate upon the surface of things, and some­ <lb/>
            times apparently born and suddenly perish;) as even in these <lb/>
            very verses of mine it is of great consequence with what <lb/>
            letters, and in what order, other letters are severally placed; <lb/>
            for the same letters, variously selected and combined, signify <lb/>
            heaven, sea, earth, rivers, sun ; the same signify corn, groves, <lb/>
            animals; if the words are not all, yet by far the greater part <lb/>
            are, alike, 1 at least so far as to have some letter or letters in <lb/>
            common; but the subjects which they express are distinguished <lb/>
            by the different arrangements of the letters to form the words. <lb/>
            So likewise even in things themselves, when the intervals, <lb/>
            passages, connexions, weights, impulses, collisions, move­ <lb/>
            ments, order, position, and configurations of the atoms of <lb/>
            matter are interchanged, the things which are formed from <lb/>
            them must also be changed. <note type="footnote"> 1 If the words are not all, yet by far the greater part are, alike, <lb/>

          <p>Give your attention now, closely, 1 to the conclusions of just <lb/>
            reasoning, from what we have previously stated. For a new <lb/>
            doctrine presses earnestly to approach your ear, and a new <lb/>
            scene of things to display itself. But neither is any thing so <lb/>
            easy, or credible, as that it may not seem rather difficult of be­ <lb/>
            lief at first; nor, likewise, is there any thing so great, or any <lb/>
            thing so admirable at first, at which all men alike do not by <lb/>
            degrees less and less wonder.</p>
          <p>In the first place, consider the bright and pure colour of <lb/>
            the sky, and that which the stars, wandering in all directions, <lb/>
            contain in themselves, and the resplendency, from brilliancy <lb/>
            of light, of the moon and the sun; all which objects, if they <lb/>
            were now first apparent to mortal eyes ; if they were, I say, <lb/>
            now first presented to them unexpectedly and suddenly, what <lb/>
            could be mentioned, which would be more wonderful than <lb/>
            these phenomena, or which the nations of the world could <lb/>
            less presume, beforehand, to believe would exist ? Nothing, <lb/>
            as I conceive; so wonderful to men would this scene of things <lb/>
            have been, for the sake of which no man, you may observe, <lb/>
            now deigns to look up to the bright regions of the sky, every <lb/>
            one being listless from satiety of viewing it. Wherefore for­ <lb/>
            bear, through being alarmed at mere novelty, to reject any <lb/>
            argument or opinion from your mind, but rather weigh it <lb/>
            with severe judgment, and, if it seem to you to be just, yield <lb/>
            your assent to it; or, if it be false, gird up your loins to op­ <lb/>
            pose it. For, since the sum of space, abroad beyond these <lb/>
            walls of our world, is, as I have proved, infinite, my mind <lb/>
            proceeds to make inquiry what there exists farther onwards, <lb/>
            in those parts into which the mind perpetually longs to look, <lb/>
            and into which the free effort of thought itself earnestly- <lb/>
            desires to penetrate.</p>
          <p>The first point which I advance is, that in every direction <lb/>
            around us, and on all sides, above and below, there is no limit <lb/>
            through the whole of space, as I myself have demonstrated, <lb/>
            and as truth itself spontaneously proclaims, and the nature of <note type="footnote"> 1 Give your attention now, closely, &amp;c.] Ver. 1023. Nunc animum <lb/>

            worlds, and that they are born and perish; a doctrine which many <lb/>

            gravely demanding the attention of the reader. </note> <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. II. 1051—1080."/> <lb/>
            the profound itself makes clear as light. But by no means <lb/>
            can it be thought probable, when infinite space lies open in <lb/>
            every quarter, and when seminal-atoms, of incomputable <lb/>
            number and unfathomable sum, driven about by everlasting <lb/>
            motion, fly through the void in infinite ways, that this one <lb/>
            globe of the earth, and this one heaven, have been alone pro­ <lb/>
            duced ; and that those innumerable particles of matter do <lb/>
            nothing beyond our sphere; especially when this world was <lb/>
            made by merely natural-causes, and the atoms of things jost­ <lb/>
            ling about 1 of their own accord in infinite modes, often brought <lb/>
            together confusedly, ineffectually, and to no purpose, at length <lb/>
            successfully coalesced;-at least such of them as, thrown to­ <lb/>
            gether suddenly, became in succession2 the beginnings of great <lb/>
            things, of the earth, the sea, the heaven, and the race of ani­ <lb/>
            mals. For which reason, it is irresistibly incumbent on you <lb/>
            to admit, that there are other combinations of matter in other <lb/>
            places, such as is this world, which the ether holds in its vast <lb/>
            embrace.</p>
          <p>Further, when abundance of matter is ready, and space is <lb/>
            at hand, and when no object or cause hinders or delays, things <lb/>
            must necessarily be generated 3 and brought into being. <lb/>
            And now, if there is such a vast multitude of seminal-atoms <lb/>
            as the whole age of all living creatures would not suffice to <lb/>
            number, and if there remains the same force and nature, that <lb/>
            can throw together the atoms of things into every part in the <lb/>
            same manner as they have been thrown together into this, <lb/>
            you must necessarily suppose that there are other orbs of earth <lb/>
            in other regions of space, and various races of men and gener­ <lb/>
            ations of beasts.</p>
          <p>To this is to be added, that in the WHOLE of our world there <lb/>
            is no one thing which is produced single, and grows up alone <lb/>
            and by itself, but that every thing is of some class, and that <lb/>
            there are many individuals in the same kind. Thus, among <lb/>
            animals especially, you will, by your own observation, 4see this <note type="footnote"> 1 Jostling about.] Ver. 1059. Fortè offensando. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Became in succession.] Ver. 1062. Fierent semper. From time <lb/>

            to be the case as to the brood of wild beasts that <unclear>range</unclear> over <lb/>
            the mountains; you will find the same as to the race of men, <lb/>
            male and female ; 1the same, moreover, as to the mute swarms <lb/>
            of fishes, and all the kinds of birds. Wherefore it is to be <lb/>
            admitted, that, in like manner, the heaven, and the earth, and <lb/>
            the sun, the moon, the sea, and other things which exist, are <lb/>
            not single, but rather of infinite number; since these follow <lb/>
            the same general law 2 as other things that arise and decay; <lb/>
            the limit of existence, deeply and unalterably fixed, awaits <lb/>
            these parts of nature as well as others, and they consist as <lb/>
            much of a natural body, generated but to die, as the whole <lb/>
            race of animals which abound, in their several kinds, in this <lb/>
            state of things.</p>
          <p>Which points if, being well understood, you keep in mind, <lb/>
            and reason from them, the system of nature immediately ap­ <lb/>
            pears, as a free agent, released from tyrant masters, to do <lb/>
            every thing itself of itself spontaneously, without the help of <lb/>
            the gods. For (0 ye sacred bosoms of the deities, that pass in <lb/>
            tranquil peace a calm and most serene existence !) who is able <lb/>
            to rule the whole of this immense universe? Who can hold in <lb/>
            his hand, with power to guide them, the strong reins of this <lb/>
            vast combination of things ? What god can, at the same time, <lb/>
            turn round all the heavens, and warm all the earth with ethereal <lb/>
            fires ? Or what god can be, at the same moment, present in all <lb/>
            places, to produce darkness with clouds, and shake the calm <lb/>
            regions of heaven with thunder, and then to hurl bolts, and <lb/>
            overturn, as often happens, his own temples; or afterwards, <lb/>
            retiring to the desert and uninhabited parts of the earth, to <lb/>
            rage there, exercising that weapon with which he often misses <lb/>
            the guilty, and kills the innocent and undeserving ?</p>
          <p>And after the time when the world was produced, and the <lb/>
            natal day of the sea, and the rise of the earth and the sun, <lb/>
            atoms were added from without; seeds, which the vast WHOLE, <lb/>
            by agitation, contributed, were conjoined; whence the sea and <lb/>
            the earth had the means of increase, and whence the mansion <lb/>
            of the sky amplified its vastness, and raised its lofty vaults far <lb/>
            above the earth, and the air rose higher and higher. For to <note type="footnote"> 1 Race of men, male and female.] Ver. 1082. Hominum geminam <lb/>

            every body in nature, from all regions of space, are con­ <lb/>
            tributed, by the agitation of particles, its own proper atoms, and <lb/>
            they betake themselves severally to their own kinds of mat­ <lb/>
            ter; the particles oj moisture pass to water; the earth is in­ <lb/>
            creased with atoms of earth; and the fiery-principles produce <lb/>
            fire, and the aerial air; until, as such operations proceeded, <lb/>
            nature, the perfectress and parent of the world, brought all <lb/>
            things to the utmost limit of growth; as happens when that <lb/>
            which is received into the vital passages, is no more in quan­ <lb/>
            tity than that which flows away and passes off. In these cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, the age and growth of all beings 1 must be at a <lb/>
            stand; here nature, by her own influence, restrains further <lb/>
            increase.</p>
          <p>For whatsoever creatures you see enlarge themselves to a <lb/>
            full and lively <unclear>bulk</unclear>, and climb, by degrees, the steps to a <lb/>
            mature age, receive into themselves more atoms than they <lb/>
            emit; whilst the nourishment is readily distributed through <lb/>
            the veins, and whilst their bodies are not so widely dilated 2 as <lb/>
            to expel many, that is, a disproportionate number of particles, <lb/>
            and to cause the waste to be greater than the food on which <lb/>
            their life sustains itself. For certainly we must admit that <lb/>
            many atoms flow off and pass away from bodies; but, till they <lb/>
            have reached the highest point of growth, more ought to <lb/>
            accrue to them. From that point, age reduces by degrees <lb/>
            their mature force and strength, and melts away and sinks <lb/>
            down to its decline. Since the larger any creature is, at the <lb/>
            time when its increase is stopped, and the greater is its extent <lb/>
            of surface, the more atoms it disperses,3 and emits from itself, <lb/>
            in all directions around; nor is the whole of its food readily <lb/>
            distributed through its veins; nor is there sufficient nourish­ <lb/>
            ment generatedfrom the food, in proportion to the effluvia which <lb/>

            can arise and be supplied to it,1 and whence nature can recruit <lb/>
            what is requisite. Bodies, therefore, naturally decay, as they <lb/>
            are wasted by their substance passing off, and as all things <lb/>
            yield to external attacks ; for food at last fails to support ad­ <lb/>
            vanced age; and hostile atoms, striking externally, cease not <lb/>
            to exhaust every creature, and subdue it with assaults.</p>
          <p>So likewise the walls of the great world, being assailed <lb/>
            around, shall suffer decay, and fall into mouldering ruins. <lb/>
            For, if things are kept in vigour, it is nourishment that must <lb/>
            recruit them all by renewal; and it is nourishment that must <lb/>
            support, nourishment that must sustain all. But it is in vain <lb/>
            to expect that this frame of the world will last for ever ; for <lb/>
            neither do its veins, so to speak, submit to receive what is suf­ <lb/>
            ficient for its maintenance, nor does nature minister as much <lb/>
            aliment as is needed.</p>
          <p>And thus, even now, the age of the world is debilitated, and <lb/>
            the earth, which produced all races of creatures, and gave <lb/>
            forth, at a birth, vast forms of wild animals, now, being ex­ <lb/>

            waves that beat the rocks, produce them; but the same earth, <lb/>
            which now nourishes them from her own substance, generated <lb/>
            them at first.</p>

          <p>Having, in the first two books, treated of the nature and qualities of atoms, <lb/>
            Lucretius proceeds, in the four following books, to speak of what is formed <lb/>
            from those atoms. He occupies the third book with a description of the na­ <lb/>
            ture of the mind and the soul, commencing (ver. 1—13) with a eulogy on <lb/>
            Epicurus, who taught that the world was formed, not by any divine power, <lb/>
            but from a fortuitous concourse of atoms, and who succeeded, beyond any <lb/>
            other philosopher, in relieving the minds of men from the fear of the gods, <lb/>
            of death, and of torments after death, ver. 14—40. Many who pretend to be <lb/>
            free from this fear, are still disquieted with it; and it is often the source of <lb/>
            crimes, ver. 41—93. He then shows that the mind and soul are a part of <lb/>
            man, not less than the hand or foot, and not a mere harmony of the parts <lb/>
            of the body, as some philosophers taught, ver. 94—106. Reasons on the <lb/>
            separate affections of the body and mind, on sleep, on corporeal mutila­ <lb/>
            tions, and on. the cessation of breathing, ver. 107—137. Uses the terms <lb/>
            mind and soul indiscriminately, yet shows that the mind (animus)is the <lb/>
            chief part, residing in the middle of the breast, the soul (anima) being <lb/>
            diffused throughout the body, and under the direction of the mind, ver. <lb/>
            138—161. That this mind, and soul, are corporeal, acting on the body by <lb/>
            material impact, and consisting of minute atoms, imperceptible to the <lb/>
            senses, ver. 161—231. That the substance of the soul and mind is not <lb/>
            simple, but composed of four subtle consistences, heat, air, aura, and a <lb/>
            fourth, to which no name is given, ver. 232—323. That the soul and body <lb/>
            cannot be separated without destruction to both; and that the sentient <lb/>
            power is not confined to the soul, ver. 324—370. He then refutes the <lb/>
            opinion of Democritus, who thought that the soul and body had corre­ <lb/>
            spondent parts, ver. 371—396. Shows that the preservation of life depends <lb/>
            more on the mind than on the soul, ver. 397—417. Afterwards he demon­ <lb/>
            strates, by twenty strict arguments, and six additional observations, that <lb/>
            the soul perishes with the body, ridiculing, by the way, the Pythagorean <lb/>
            transmigration, ver. 418—841. Hence heobserves, that, as death is the <lb/>
            end of man, nothing is to be feared after it; that it cannot be in itself an <lb/>
            evil, because the dead can regret nothing that they have left; and that <lb/>
            prolongation of life is not to be desired, as it would furnish nothing but <lb/>
            what has been already enjoyed, ver. 842—988. Says that all the Tarta­ <lb/>
            rean sufferings which are dreaded after death, are witnessed and endured <lb/>
            in life, ver. 989—1036. Consoles mankind, by observing that the best men <lb/>
            have died as well as the worst, and exhorts them to contemplate death <lb/>
            with reason and calmness, ver. 1037—1088. Concludes with a few more <lb/>
            moral reflections to the same purpose, ver. 1089—1107.</p><pb n="100"/>

            amazed that nature, thus manifestly displayed by thy power, <lb/>
            has been in all parts revealed to us.</p>
          <p>And since I have shown 1 of what kind the primordial atoms <lb/>
            of all things are, and how, differing in their various forms, <lb/>
            and actuated by motion from all eternity, they fly through the <lb/>
            void of space of their own accord ;2 and since I have also de­ <lb/>

            duced from them ; the nature of the MIND and of the SOUL now <lb/>
            seems, next to these subjects, proper to be illustrated in my <lb/>
            verses; and there must be driven utterly from our minds 3 that <lb/>
            fear of Acheron, which disturbs human life from its very <lb/>
            foundation, suffusing all things with the blackness of death, <lb/>
            nor allows any pleasure to be pure and uncontaminated.</p>
          <p>For as to what men often say, that diseases, and a life of <lb/>
            infamy, are more to be feared than Tartarus, the successor of <lb/>
            death; and that they know the consistence of the soul to be <lb/>
            of the nature of blood, or even of breath, (if their inclination <lb/>
            happen to lead them to such an opinion,) and have no need <lb/>
            at all of our reasoning and instruction; you may perceive, <lb/>
            for the reasons that follow, 4 that all these observations are <lb/>
            thrown out more for the sake of praise and vain-glory, than <lb/>
            because the belief itself is settled in their minds; for the very <lb/>
            same boasters, exiled from their country, and driven far from <lb/>
            the sight of men, disgraced with foul guilt, and afflicted with <lb/>
            all calamities, yet still continue to live; and whithersoever, <lb/>
            notwithstanding, the unhappy men have come, they offer sa­ <lb/>

            much more zealously to religion than before. For which rea­ <lb/>

            to judge of his character, in doubtful dangers, and to learn <lb/>
            what he is in adverse circumstances; since words of truth <lb/>
            are then at last elicited from the bottom of the heart, and the <lb/>
            mask is taken away, while the reality of the manremains.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, avarice, and the blind desire of honours, <lb/>
            which drive men to transgress the bounds of right, and some­ <lb/>
            times, as the accomplices and ministers of crimes, to strive <lb/>
            night and day, with excessive labour, to rise to the height of <lb/>
            power; these passions, I say, which are the wounds and <lb/>
            plagues of life, are nourished for the most part by the dread <lb/>
            of death. For, in general, infamous contempt, and sharp po­ <lb/>
            verty, seem removed from a pleasing and secure state of life, <lb/>
            and seem to dwell, as it were, before the very gates of de­ <lb/>
            struction. From which cause, while men, not submitting to <lb/>
            die to avoid those evils, but restrained by a false terror of death <lb/>
            and its consequences, wish that they may escape far, and re­ <lb/>
            move themselves to a distance, from disgrace and want, they <lb/>
            increase their property with civil bloodshed, and greedily double <lb/>
            their riches, heaping slaughter on slaughter; they cruelly re­ <lb/>
            joice at the sad end of a brother, and hate and dread the <lb/>
            tables1 of their relations.</p>
          <p>From the same terror,2 in like manner, envy often wastes <lb/>
            men away; they grieve that he who walks before them in <lb/>
            shining honour, should be powerful, should be looked upon <lb/>
            with respect; they complain that they themselves are tossed <lb/>
            about in obscurity and dishonour.3 Some pine to death for <lb/>
            the sake of statues and a name, and often to such a degree <lb/>
            from the fear of death, does the hatred of life, and of seeing <lb/>

            and their dear parents, while seeking to avoid the regions of <lb/>
            Acheron. Since as children tremble,2 and fear every thing in <lb/>
            thick darkness, so we, in the light, fear sometimes things which <lb/>
            are not more to be feared than those which children dread, <lb/>
            and imagine about to happen, in the dark. This terror of <lb/>
            the mind, therefore, it is not the rays of the sun, or the <lb/>
            bright arrows of day, that must dispel, but the contemplation <lb/>
            of nature, and the exercise of reason.</p>
          <p>First, then, I say, that the mind, 3 which we often call the <lb/>
            intellect, in which is placed the conduct and government of <lb/>

            and soul his first assertion is, that the mind (animus), which we <lb/>
            often call the intellect (mens), and which is the director of life, is <lb/>

            thought that the sense of the mind is not placed in any cer­ <lb/>
            tain part, but is a kind of vital habit or resulting power of <lb/>
            the body, (called by the Greeks a harmony,) 1 which causes <lb/>
            us to live endowed with a mental sense, though the mind is <lb/>
            situate in no particular part of us. As, frequently, when <lb/>
            good health is said to be a sensation of the body, and yet this <lb/>
            health is itself no portion of the person that enjoys health; so <lb/>
            those philosophers place the sense of the mind in no particular <lb/>
            part of the person. In which hypothesis they seem to wander <lb/>
            far astray. For frequently the body, which is openly seen, <lb/>
            is diseased and dejected, while we nevertheless feel pleasure2 <lb/>
            in the other part, which is hid within us; and on the other <lb/>
            hand again, it often happens that the reverse is the case, when <lb/>
            he who is wretched in mind is well in his whole body; just <lb/>
            in the same way as if, when the foot of a sick man is pained, <lb/>

            Besides, when the limbs are resigned to gentle sleep, and the <lb/>
            body, heavy with slumber, lies stretched without sense, there <lb/>
            is yet something else within us, which, at that very time, is <lb/>
            agitated in diverse ways, and admits into itself all the affec­ <lb/>
            tions of joy, and all the empty solicitudes of the heart.</p>
          <p>And now, also, that you may befurther convinced that the <lb/>
            soul is actually one among our members,3 and is not wont to <lb/>
            hold or occupy the body as a harmony,4 it happens in the first <note type="footnote"> 1 Harmony.] Ver. 101. Many however have thought otherwise. <lb/>
            and some have considered the mind to be a mere effect of the ar­ <lb/>

            whom was Aristoxenus, who, says Cicero, (Tusc. i. 10, 18,) being <lb/>
            both a philosopher and musician, imagined that the mind was <lb/>
            merely a harmony resulting from the nature and shape of the body, <lb/>
            as tunes spring from the consenting motions of musical instruments. <lb/>

            place, you may observe, that, even when much 0f the body is <lb/>
            taken away, the life nevertheless often remains in the mem­ <lb/>
            bers that are left;1 and, again, the same life, when a few atoms <lb/>
            of the heat of the body have dispersed, and air has been sent <lb/>
            forth through the mouth, immediately quits the veins, and <lb/>
            relinquishes possession of the bones: so that you may conclude <lb/>
            from hence, that all particles of the body have not equal parts <lb/>
            and powers, but that those which are the constituent-atoms <lb/>
            of air and quickening heat,2 exercise more influence than <lb/>
            others that life may dwell and be retained in the members. <lb/>
            The vital heat, therefore, and air, which desert our limbs <lb/>
            when dying, are existent in the body itself, and form a part <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>For which reason, since the nature of the mind and the <lb/>
            soul is thus found to exist as a part of man, give back to these <lb/>
            philosophers their name of harmony, whether brought down <lb/>
            by musicians from lofty Helicon, or whether they themselves <lb/>
            took it from any other quarter, 3 and transferred it to that <lb/>
            object, which then wanted a distinctive appellation. What­ <lb/>
            soever is the case, let them have it to themselves; listen thou <lb/>

            It will be seen below, (ver. 232, seq.,) that he makes the anima, <lb/>

            diffused throughout the body, and which is often itself affected with <lb/>
            pleasure or pain, when the soul connected with it is wholly un­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. III. 138—168."/> <lb/>
            one another, and form of themselves one nature or substance; <lb/>
            but that that which is as it were the head, and which rules in <lb/>
            the whole body, is the reason, the thinking or intellectual part <lb/>
            which we call mind and understanding; and this remains seated <lb/>
            in the middle portion of the breast. For here dread and terror <lb/>
            throb; around these parts joys soothe; here therefore is the <lb/>
            understanding and mind. The other part of the soul, or vital <lb/>
            power, distributed through the whole body, obeys, and is moved <lb/>
            according to the will and impulse of the mind. And this rational <lb/>
            or intellectual part thinks of itself alone, and rejoices for itself, <lb/>
            at times when nothing of the kind moves either the rest of the <lb/>
            soul or the body. And as when the head or the eye, when <lb/>
            pain affects it, is troubled in us, and as part of us, but we are <lb/>
            not afflicted throughout the whole body, so the mind is some­ <lb/>
            times grieved itself alone, and is sometimes excited with joy, <lb/>
            when the other part of the soul, diffused through the limbs and <lb/>
            joints, is stimulated by no new sensation. But when the mind <lb/>
            is more than ordinarily shaken by violent terror, we see the <lb/>
            whole soul, throughout the several members, sympathize with <lb/>
            it, and perspirations and paleness, in consequence, arise over <lb/>
            the whole body, and the tongue rendered powerless and the <lb/>
            voice die away; while, we find the eyes darkened, the ears <lb/>
            ringing, and the limbs sinking underneath.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we often see men faint altogether from terror <lb/>
            of mind; so that any one may easily understand from this, <lb/>
            that with the mind is united the soul, which, when it has been <lb/>
            acted upon by the power of the mind, then influences and <lb/>
            affects the body.</p>
          <p>This same course of reasoning teaches us that the nature <lb/>
            or substance of the mind and soul is corporeal ; 1 for when <lb/>
            this nature or substance is seen to impel the limbs, to rouse <lb/>
            the body from sleep, and to change the countenance, and to <lb/>
            guide and turn about the whole man ;—of which effects we <lb/>
            see that none can be produced without touch, and that touch, <lb/>
            moreover, cannot take place without body ;-must we not ad­ <lb/>
            mit that the mind and soul are of a corporeal nature ? <note type="footnote"> 1 The same-reasoning -mind and soul corporeal.] Ver. 162. <lb/>
            As the mind and soul act upon the body, they must be corporeal, <lb/>
            for nothing but body can act upon body; as he asserts i. 305: Tan­ <lb/>

            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="B. III. 169-183."/>
          <p>Besides, you see that the mind suffers with the body, 1 and <lb/>
            sympathizes for us with the body. Thus, if the violent force <lb/>
            of a dart, driven into the body, the bones and nerves being di­ <lb/>
            vided, does not hurt the life itself, yet there follows a languor, <lb/>
            and a kind of agreeable inclination-to-sink to the ground,2 and <lb/>
            when we are on the ground, a perturbation3 and giddiness <lb/>
            which is produced in the mind, and sometimes, as it were, an <lb/>
            irresolute desire to rise. It therefore necessarily follows that <lb/>
            the nature of the mind is corporeal, since it is made to suffer <lb/>
            by corporeal weapons and violence.</p>
          <p>I shall now proceed to give you a demonstration, in plain <lb/>
            words, of what substance this mind is, and of what it consists.</p>
          <p>In the first place, I say that it is extremely subtle, 4 and is <lb/>
            formed of very minute atoms. And you may, if you please, <lb/>
            give me your attention, in order that you may understand <lb/>
            clearly that this is so, from the following arguments.5 No­ <lb/>
            thing is seen to be done in so swift a way,6 as if the mind pro- <note type="footnote"> I Suffers with the body.] Ver. 169. Fungi cum corpore. Facere et <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεπτομερὲς σω̃μα</foreign>, and says that it consists of atoms not very dissimi­ <lb/>

            Nil adeo fieri celeri ratione videtur <lb/>
            Quam si mens fieri proponit, et inchoat ipsa. <lb/>
            This seems to be but a cumbrous and circuitous way of expressing <lb/>
            that nothing is so active as thought. Good has it, <lb/>
            nought so swiftly speeds <lb/>
            As what the mind determines and completes. <lb/>
            Creech contents himself with <lb/>
            no action is so swiftly done <lb/>
            As what the mind begins. <lb/>
            Busby is very spirited, to show how Lucretius ought to have ex­ <lb/>
            pressed himself: </note> <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. III. 181—214."/> <lb/>
            poses it to be done, and itself undertakes it. The mind, <lb/>
            therefore, impels itself more speedily than any thing, among <lb/>
            all those of which the nature is manifestly seen before our <lb/>
            eyes. But that which is so exceedingly active, must consist <lb/>
            of atoms exquisitely round and exquisitely minute; that they <lb/>
            may be moved, when acted on, by a slight impulse. For <lb/>
            water is moved, and flows, with so trifling a force as we see <lb/>
            act upon it, inasmuch -as it is composed of voluble and small <lb/>
            particles. But the substance of honey, on the other hand, is <lb/>
            more dense, and its fluid sluggish, and its movement more <lb/>
            tardy ; 1 for its whole mass of material-particles clings more <lb/>
            closely together; because, as is evident, it consists of atoms <lb/>
            neither so smooth, nor so small and round. For a gentle and <lb/>
            light breeze can make a tall heap of poppy-seed waste away, <lb/>
            from the top to the bottom, before your eyes; but, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, can have no such effect upon a heap of stones and darts; <lb/>
            particles, therefore, according as they are most diminutive2 <lb/>
            and most smooth, have also the greatest facility of motion. <lb/>
            But, on the other hand, whatever particles are found of a <lb/>
            greater weight, and rougher surface, are so much the more <lb/>
            fixed and difficult to move.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, the nature of the mind has been found pre- <lb/>
            eminently active, it must of necessity consist of particles ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly diminutive, and smooth, and round. Which point, <lb/>
            being thus known to you, my excellent friend, will be found <lb/>
            useful, and be of advantage, in many of your future in­ <lb/>
            quiries.</p>
          <p>This fact also indicates the nature of the soul, and shows <lb/>
            of how subtle a texture it consists, and in how small a space <lb/>
            it would contain itself, if it could be condensed; because, <lb/>
            when the tranquil repose of death has taken possession of a <lb/>
            man, and the substance of the mind and the soul has departed, <lb/>
            you can there perceive nothing detracted as to appearance, <note type="footnote">Attend: this potent truth thou'lt well perceive; <lb/>
            For what its point so swiftly can achieve <lb/>

            nothing as to weight, from the whole body. Death leaves all <lb/>
            things entire, 1 except vital sense and quickening heat.2</p>
          <p>It must therefore necessarily be the case, that the whole <lb/>
            soul consists of extremely small seminal-atoms, connected and <lb/>
            diffused throughout the veins, the viscera, and the nerves; <lb/>
            inasmuch as, when the whole of it has departed from the <lb/>
            whole of the body, the extreme outline of the members still <lb/>
            shows itself unaltered, nor is an atom of weight withdrawn ;3 <lb/>
            just as is the case when the aroma of wine has flown off, or <lb/>
            when the sweet odour of ointment has passed away into the <lb/>
            air, or when the flavour has departed from any savoury sub­ <lb/>
            stance 4 for still the substance itself does not, on that account, <lb/>
            appear diminished to the eye, nor does any thing seem to have <lb/>
            been deducted from the weight; evidently because many and <lb/>
            minute atoms compose the flavour and odour throughout the <lb/>
            whole constitution of bodies.</p>
          <p>Wherefore again and again I say, you may feel assured <lb/>
            that the nature or substance of the mind and soul is produced <lb/>
            from exquisitely small seminal-atoms, since, when it escapes <lb/>
            from the body, it carries away no weight with it.</p>
          <p>Nor yet is this nature or substance to be regarded by us as <lb/>
            simple and uncompounded. For a certain subtle aura,5 mixed <note type="footnote"> I Death leaves all things entire.] Ver. 215. Mors omnia prœstat. <lb/>

            ,air with it; nor is there any heat with which air is not also <lb/>
            mixed; since, as its substance is rare, many atoms of air must <lb/>
            necessarily be borne with it.</p>
          <p>The substance of the mind is now therefore found to be <lb/>
            triple. Nor yet are all these constituent parts, aura, heat, <lb/>
            and air, sufficient to produce mental sense or power; since <lb/>
            the mind admits none of these to be able to generate sensible <lb/>
            motions, such as revolve any thoughts in the mind. A certain <lb/>
            fourth nature, or suhstance,1 must therefore necessarily be <lb/>
            added to these; this is wholly without a name; it is a sub­ <lb/>
            stance, however, than which nothing exists more active or <lb/>
            more subtle, nor is any thing more essentially composed of small <lb/>
            and smooth elementary particles; and it is this substance <lb/>
            which first distributes sensible motions through the members. <lb/>
            For, being formed of small atoms, it is itself first excited; <lb/>
            then the heat, and the secret power of the aura, receive motion <lb/>
            from it; next the air, and afterwards all parts, are quick­ <lb/>
            ened ; the blood is agitated, and all the viscera partake-in-the- <lb/>
            sensation ; and (whether it be pleasure, or whether it be the <lb/>
            contrary feeling) it is communicated to the bones and marrow <lb/>
            last of all. Nor can pain easily penetrate, or any violent evil <lb/>
            spread, so far as this, without all parts being perturbed: so <lb/>
            that, in such a case, room is wanting for life, and the particles <lb/>
            of the soul fly off through all the passages of the body. But <lb/>
            on the surface of the body, as it were, a limit is generally put <lb/>
            to sensible motions; and from this cause we have the power <lb/>
            to retain life within us.</p>
          <p>And now, though I would fain give a full exposition, in <lb/>

            standing, as far as I shall be able to treat of these subjects <lb/>
            summarily, I will touch upon them.</p>
          <p>For the primordial-atoms, by the motion of the elements <lb/>
            among themselves, so actively-intermingle in the substance of <lb/>
            the soul, that no one can be separated from the rest, nor can <lb/>
            their power become divided by any interval, but, being many, <note type="footnote"> I A certain fourth nature o substance.] Ver. 242. Quarta quadam <lb/>

            they are, as it were, the power of a single body. As, in the <lb/>
            herd of animals, whichsoever you would inspect, 1 there is a <lb/>
            certain odour, and heat, and taste; and still from all these is <lb/>
            composed one mass and combination of body. So heat, and <lb/>
            air, and the secret power of aura, and that other active force, <lb/>
            (which communicates the beginning of motion from itself to <lb/>
            the other three, whence a sensible movement first arises <lb/>
            through the viscera,2) being mixed, produce one nature or sub­ <lb/>
            stance. For this fourth principle lies entirely hid, and re­ <lb/>
            mains in secret, within; nor is any thing more deeply seated <lb/>
            within our body; and it is itself, moreover, the soul of the <lb/>
            whole soul. As the force of the mind, and the power of the <lb/>
            soul, mixed up with our limbs and entire body, remains latent, <lb/>
            because it is composed of small and few atoms, so this name­ <lb/>
            less force, compounded of small particles, lies concealed, and <lb/>
            is besides, as it were, the very soul of the whole soul, and <lb/>
            rules throughout the whole body. In like manner, it must be <lb/>
            the case that the aura, and air, and heat, mixed throughout <lb/>
            the limbs, possess-their-vigour one with another; and that <lb/>
            one may possibly subside at times, or become prominent, more <lb/>
            than the rest; but so that they may still seem to be one prin­ <lb/>
            ciple compounded of them all; and that the heat and aura by <lb/>
            themselves, or the power of air by itself, may not, being se­ <lb/>
            parated from the whole, destroy and dissipate the sense.</p>
          <p>There is also that heat in the mind, which it assumes in <lb/>
            anger, when it burns, and ardour gleams vividly from the <lb/>
            eyes. There is also much cold aura, the attendant of fear, <lb/>
            with which it produces shivering throughout the various mem­ <lb/>
            bers, and agitates the limbs. There is also that state of the air <lb/>
            when at rest, which happens in concurrence with a tranquil <lb/>
            breast and serene countenance. But in those animals, whose <lb/>
            fierce hearts, and angry feelings, easily burn in wrath, there is <lb/>
            more heat; in which class especially is the violent fury of <note type="footnote"> 1 As, in the herd of animals, whichsoever you would inspect.] <lb/>

              lions, which, raging, often burst, as it were, their hearts with <lb/>
              roaring, nor can contain within their breasts their torrents of <lb/>
              ire. But the cold temperament of deer has more of the aura <lb/>
              in it, and sooner excites a chill influence through the viscera, <lb/>
              which cause a tremulous motion to arise in the limbs. But <lb/>
              the nature of the ox subsists more on calm air, nor does the <lb/>
              smoky torch of wrath, applied to him,1 ever irritate him to <lb/>
              fury like that of the lion, suffusing him with a shade of thick <lb/>
              darkness ;2 nor is he torpid, transfixed with the cold darts of <lb/>
              aura; but is situate between the two natures, those of deer <lb/>
              and fiercer lions.</p>
          <p>Thus is the race of men. Each has a certain temperament; <lb/>
            and though instruction may in a manner render some in­ <lb/>
            dividuals polished, it still leaves the first traces of the nature <lb/>
            of every mind; nor is it to be thought that vices can be so <lb/>
            plucked out by the root, but that one man will run more <lb/>
            readily than another into violent anger; a second will be af­ <lb/>
            fected somewhat sooner than another by fear; while a third <lb/>
            will regard certain things more indulgently than is right. And <lb/>
            in many other respects the various natures, and yielding man­ <lb/>
            ners of men, must necessarily differ; of which differences I <lb/>
            cannot now explain the secret causes, nor find so many names <lb/>
            for figures as there are diversities of shape in the atoms from <lb/>
            which this variety in things arises.</p>
          <p>But, with reference to these subjects, I think myself compe­ <lb/>
            tent to affirm this ; that so small are the traces left of the natural <lb/>
            principles, which reason cannot remove3 by her dictates, that <lb/>

          <p>This mental nature, therefore, 1 or compound intellectual <lb/>
            substance, is contained in every body, and is itself the <lb/>
            guardian of the body, and the cause of its safety; for the two, <lb/>
            the body and soul, cohere, as it were, by common roots, with <lb/>
            one another, nor seem capable of being torn asunder without <lb/>
            destruction to both. For as it is impossible to separate the <lb/>
            perfume from balls of frankincense, without the nature of it, <lb/>
            at the same time, being destroyed, so it is impossible to ex­ <lb/>
            tract the nature or substance of the mind and soul from the <lb/>
            whole body, without all parts being dissolved; with such <lb/>
            closely interwoven elements, from their first origin, are they <lb/>
            endowed with common life; nor does the power of the body <lb/>
            or mind seem capable of having-perception apart, each for it­ <lb/>
            self, without the vigour of the other; but the sentient-power <lb/>
            lighted up through our viscera is conjointly-produced by their <lb/>
            common motions one with the other.2</p>
          <p>Besides, the body is never produced,3 nor ever grows, by <lb/>
            itself; nor is it observed to retain-its-existence after death, or <lb/>
            the departure of the soul from it. For it is net as when the <lb/>
            liquid-substance of water frequently throws off heat, which <lb/>
            has been communicated to it, nor is on that account dispersed <lb/>
            itself ;-not so, I say, can the limbs, when deserted by the soul, <lb/>
            bear the separation of the soul from them, but, thus divided <lb/>
            from it, altogether perish and rot. For the mutual inter-con­ <lb/>
            nexions of the soul and the corporeal frame, from the very be­ <lb/>
            ginning of life, even in the body and secret womb of the mother, <lb/>
            so acquire the vital movements together, that a separation <lb/>
            cannot take place without destruction and damage to each ; so <lb/>
            that you may see that, since their means of preservation are <lb/>
            united, the nature and substance of them must also be united.</p>

            the body has sense, and believes that the soul, mixed with the <lb/>
            entire body, takes wholly upon itself that motion which we <lb/>
            call sense; he contends against manifest and certain facts. <lb/>
            For who will ever explain what it is for the body to have <lb/>
            sense, if it be not that which experience itself has manifestly <lb/>
            shown and taught us ? But the soul being set free from the <lb/>
            body, the body is void of sense in all parts: for it loses that <lb/>
            which was not peculiar to itself in any period of its life; and <lb/>
            it besides loses many things as the soul is-being-expelled <lb/>
            by age.1</p>
          <p>To affirm, moreover, that the eyes2 themselves can see no <lb/>
            object, but that the mind merely looks through them as through <lb/>
            open doors, is difficult; when the sense of these eyes leads to a <lb/>
            contrary opinion; for the sense of the eyes draws the mbid,3 <lb/>
            and attracts it from within, to the sights or pupils themselves. <lb/>
            While, let it especially be considered, we are often unable to <lb/>
            look at bright objects, because our eyes are prevented by their <lb/>
            effulgence ; which is not the case with regard to mere doors; <lb/>
            for mere open doors, where we look through, do not feel any <lb/>
            inconvenience. Besides, if our eyes are only instead of doors <lb/>
            the mind, when the eyes are taken out, and the door-posts <lb/>
            themselves, so to speak, removed, seems bound to see even <lb/>
            more clearly than before.</p>
          <p>On these points, you can by no means assume as true1 that <note type="footnote"> 1 And it besides loses many things as the soul is-being-expelled <lb/>

            have interpreted this line according to Wakefield, who, however, <lb/>
            reads dum. The soul loses some portion of her faculties, as the body <lb/>

            which the divine opinibn of the philosopher Democritus. lays <lb/>
            down; namely, that the several atoms of the body and mind, <lb/>
            applied and corresponding each to each, vary and connect the <lb/>
            members.1 For not only are the atoms of the soul much <lb/>
            more diminutive than those of which our body and viscera <lb/>
            consist, but are also inferior in number, and are distributed <lb/>
            thinly, with spaces between them, throughout the limbs; se <lb/>
            that you may safely warrant that the primary particles of the <lb/>
            soul occupy, and are distributed at those intervals only, at <lb/>
            which corporeal atoms cast upon us, and striking against us <lb/>
            may, if of sufficient gravity, be able to excite sensible motions <lb/>
            through the body, the concussions being communicated from <lb/>
            the surface to the internal parts. For neither at times do we <lb/>
            perceive the adhesion of dust on the body, nor feel powdered <lb/>
            chalk, shaken over the limbs, settle on them; nor do we feel <lb/>
            a mist at night, nor the subtle threads of the spider's web <lb/>
            meeting us, when we are entangled in them as we go along; <lb/>
            nor do we notice the old vesture of the same spider fall upon <lb/>
            our head, nor feathers of birds, or the flying down of thistles, <lb/>
            which, from extreme lightness, generally fall with difficulty. <lb/>
            and strike but gently the object on which they fall; nor do we <lb/>
            observe the progress of every creeping animal, nor every first <lb/>
            step of the feet, which gnats and other such insects place upon <lb/>
            our body; so many particles in us must be moved, before the <lb/>
            primordial-atoms of the soul, mixed throughout the limbs in <lb/>
            our bodies, can feel-the-sensation, and, impelling one another, <lb/>
            (at how great intervals!) can, in succession, strike together, <lb/>
            meet, and rebound.</p>
          <p>And the mind is more efficient in holding the bars of life,3 <note type="footnote"> the body, were equal in number, and were united, atom to atom, <lb/>
            throughout the whole human frame. But this cannot be true, says <lb/>
            Lucretius; for, if it were, whatever might touch any atom on the <lb/>
            surface of the body, however lightly, would agitate the correspond­ <lb/>

            and more prevalent to preserve vitality; than the power of the <lb/>
            soul. For without the understanding and mind no part of <lb/>
            the soul can have-its-residence in the body even for a small <lb/>
            portion of time; but when the mind takes its departure, the <lb/>
            soul readily follows as its companion, and leaves the chilled <lb/>
            limbs in the cold of death. But he to whom understanding <lb/>
            and mind have remained, continues in life, although he be <lb/>
            mutilated, with his limbs even cut off on all sides. The trunk. <lb/>
            though portions of the soul be taken away around it, and it be <lb/>
            separated from the limbs, still lives, and inhales the vital air;­ <lb/>
            deprived, if not altogether, yet in a great measure, of the soul, <lb/>
            it still delays and continues in life. So when the eye is la­ <lb/>
            cerated round about, if the pupil has remained uninjured, the <lb/>
            vivid faculty of seeing survives; but this is only provided you <lb/>
            do not injure the entire ball of the eye, but merely cut round <lb/>
            the pupil, and leave that alone whole; for such injury cannot <lb/>
            be committed without destruction of the eyes; but, if the very <lb/>
            smallest part of the middle of the ball is perforated, though <lb/>
            the bright orb be otherwise unharmed, the sight is at once <lb/>
            lost, and darkness follows. With such a connexion the soul <lb/>
            and the mind are constantly united.</p>

            tues, 2 verses collected during a long time, and prepared with <note type="footnote"> Ver. 397. Et magis est animus vitaï claustra coercens. As he has <lb/>
            placed the mind (animus) in the breast, and distributed the soul <lb/>
            (anima) through the whole body, he now shows that though part of <lb/>
            the soul may, by mutilation of the body, be taken away, life, as <lb/>
            long as the mind remains uninjured, will still be preserved; just as <lb/>
            the sight of the eye will continue perfect, as long as no damage is <lb/>
            done to the pupil. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 And now attend. That thou mayest understand, &amp;c.] Ver. 418. <lb/>
            He now proceeds, with all the force of reasoning that he can collect, <lb/>
            to show that the united substance of the mind and soul is born, grows, <lb/>
            decays, and dies, together with the body. In this process he uses, <lb/>

            sweet labour. And thou, my friend, take care to include <lb/>
            both of them under one name, whichsoever of the two I may <lb/>
            use; and, for example, when I proceed to speak of the soul, <lb/>
            teaching that it is mortal, suppose that I also speak of the <lb/>
            mind; inasmuch as they are one by mutual combination, and <lb/>
            their substance is united.</p>
          <p>In the first place, since I have shown1 that the soul, being <lb/>
            subtle, consists of minute particles, and is composed of much <lb/>
            smaller atoms than the clear fluid of water, or mist, or smoke; <lb/>
            (for it far surpasses those bodies in susceptibility-of-motion, <lb/>
            and is more readily impelled when acted upon from a slight <lb/>
            cause; inasmuch as both the mind and soul are moved by the <lb/>
            mere images of smoke and mist; 2 as when, lulled in sleep, we <lb/>
            see high altars exhale with vapour, and carry up smoke; <lb/>
            since doubtless these phantasms are produced in us ; ) 3 now, <lb/>
            therefore, 1 say, since, when vessels are broken to pieces. <lb/>

            27, 28. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In the first place, since I have shown, &amp;c.] Ver. 425. This is <lb/>
            his first argument. Since the soul is more subtle than vapour or <lb/>
            smoke, it must surely be sooner dissipated than those light sub­ <lb/>
            stances, when it is once set free from the body that confines it. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Inasmuch as both the mind and soul are moved by the mere <lb/>
            images of smoke and mist.] Ver. 431. Quippe ubi imaginibus fumi <lb/>
            nebulœeque moventur. " Quippe ubi," says Lambinus, " is quippe quia, <lb/>
            or quippe cùm." Moventur, in the plural, is the reading of Wakefield, <lb/>
            to include the mind and the soul; but, as Lachmann remarks, it is <lb/>
            absurd, since Lucretius considers the two as one; other copies have <lb/>
            movetur. As to the imagines in the mind, says Turnebus, (Advers. <lb/>
            xx. 26,) Lucretius means that the atoms of the mind are finer <lb/>
            than those of smoke and mist, since they are moved even by the <lb/>
            images and simulacra of smoke and mist." " A pleasant argument," <lb/>
            says Faber; " the images of smoke and mist move the mind; there­ <lb/>
            fore it must be very light." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Since doubtless these phantasms are produced in us.] Ver. 434. <lb/>
            Nam procul hœc dubio nobis simulacra genuntur. " Procul dubio ista­ <lb/>
            rum rerum phantasmata per simulachra in nobis excitantur." <lb/>
            Creech. Lucretius, with his master, Epicurus, thought that the <lb/>
            images thrown off from objects (as shown in book iv.) flying about <lb/>
            in the air, and coming in contact with our bodies, produced such <lb/>
            impressions upon the soul as to excite dreams. " For without <lb/>
            images," says Lambinus, " Epicurus supposed that nothing could <lb/>
            be seen, or thought, or dreamed." Incohibessit, at the end of the <lb/>
            paragraph, (ver. 445,) I have rendered as the present. </note> <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. III. 437—464."/> <lb/>
            and since, also, mist and smoke disperse into the air; you <lb/>
            must conclude that the soul is likewise scattered abroad, and <lb/>
            is dissipated much sooner than mist and smoke, and more <lb/>
            easily resolved into its original elements, when it has once been <lb/>
            withdrawn from the body of a man, and has taken its depar­ <lb/>
            ture. For how can you believe that this soul can be held <lb/>
            together by any combination of air, when the body itself (which <lb/>
            is, as it were, its vessel) cannot contain it, if it be convulsed <lb/>
            by any violence, or rendered thin and weak by blood being <lb/>
            taken from the veins ? How can that air which is more rare <lb/>
            than our body confine it ?</p>
          <p>Besides, we observe that the mind is produced' together <lb/>
            with the body, and grows up along with it, and waxes old at <lb/>
            the same time with it. For as children wander and totter <lb/>
            about with a weak and tender body, so the subtle sense of the <lb/>
            mind follows and corresponds to the weakness of their frame. <lb/>
            Then, when their age has grown up in robust vigour, their <lb/>
            understanding is also greater, and their strength of mind <lb/>
            more enlarged. Afterwards, when the body is shaken by the <lb/>
            prevailing power of time, and, the strength being depressed, <lb/>
            the limbs have sunk into infirmity, the understanding then <lb/>
            halts, the tongue and the mind lose their sense, all parts fail <lb/>
            and fade away at once. It is therefore natural that the whole <lb/>
            substance of the soul should be dissolved, as smoke, into the <lb/>
            sublime air of heaven ; since we see that it is produced toge­ <lb/>
            ther with the body, and grows up together with it, and both, <lb/>
            as I have shown, overcome by age, decay in concert.</p>
          <p>To this is added,2 that as we observe the body itself to- <lb/>
            be-subject-to violent diseases and severe pain, so we see the <lb/>
            mind to be susceptible of sharp cares, and grief, and fear. <lb/>
            For which cause it is reasonable that it should also be a par­ <lb/>
            taker of death.</p>
          <p>Moreover the mind, in diseases of the body, often wanders <note type="footnote"> I Besides, we observe that the mind is produced, &amp;c.] Ver. 446. <lb/>
            The second argument. Since the mind appears tend( r when the body <lb/>
            is tender; mature, when the body is mature; and declining, when <lb/>
            the body is declining; it is but fair to conclude, that it perishes <lb/>
            when the body perishes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 To this is added, &amp;c.] Ver. 460. The third argument. Since, <lb/>
            when the body is weakened by disease, the mind or soul is weaken­ <lb/>
            ed with it, must we not conclude that, when the body dies, the <lb/>
            mind or soul dies with it ? </note> <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. III 465—490."/> <lb/>
            distracted ; for it loses its faculties, and utters senseless <lb/>
            words; and sometimes, by a heavy lethargy, is borne down into <lb/>
            a deep and eternal sleep, the eyes and the nodding-head sink­ <lb/>
            ing ; 1 hence it neither hears the voice, nor can distinguish <lb/>
            the countenances, of those who stand around recalling it to <lb/>
            life, bedewing their faces and cheeks with tears. Wherefore <lb/>
            you must necessarily admit that the mind is also dissolved, <lb/>
            since the contagion of disease penetrates into it. For pain <lb/>
            and disease are each the fabricator of death; a truth. which <lb/>
            we have been taught by the destruction of many millions in <lb/>
            past times.</p>
          <p>Further, when the violent power of wine has penetrated the <lb/>
            heart of men, and its heat, being distributed, has spread into <lb/>
            the veins, a heaviness of the limbs follows, the legs of the <lb/>
            tottering person are impeded, the tongue grows torpid, the <lb/>
            mind is, as it were, drowned; the eyes swim ; noise, hiccups,3 <lb/>
            and quarrels arise, and other things of this kind, whatever are <lb/>
            consequent on intoxication. Why do these effects happen, <lb/>
            unless because the vehement force of the wine has exerted­ <lb/>
            its-customary-power to disturb the soul as it is diffused <lb/>
            through the body itself? But whatsoever things can be thus <lb/>
            disturbed and obstructed in their operations, show, that if a <lb/>
            cause somewhat stronger shall spread within them, the conse­ <lb/>
            quence will be that they must perish, deprived of all future <lb/>
            existence.</p>
          <p>Moreover, frequently, overcome by the force of disease,4 a <lb/>
            person suddenly falls down before our eyes, as if struck by <lb/>
            the blow of a thunder-bolt, and foams at the mouth, groans, <lb/>
            and trembles in his joints, loses his senses, stretches his nerves <lb/>

            wearies his limbs with tossing about; evidently because the <lb/>
            violence of the malady, dispersed throughout the body, and <lb/>
            acting upon the soul, perturbs it, as the waves, on the foaming <lb/>
            salt ocean, boil with the strong fury of the winds. Groans are <lb/>
            then forced but, because the limbs are seized with pain, and <lb/>
            especially because the particles of the voice are drawn forth, <lb/>
            and carried, collected in a body, out of the mouth, the may by <lb/>
            which they have, as it were, been accustomed to pass, and where <lb/>
            the course of the road is paved for them.1 Loss of understand­ <lb/>
            ing takes place, because the united power of the mind and <lb/>
            soul is disturbed, and, as I have shown, is divided and rent <lb/>
            asunder, distracted by that same distemper. Afterwards, when <lb/>
            the cause of the disease has given way, and the violent humour <lb/>
            of the disordered body has retired into its, hiding-place, then, <lb/>
            as if staggering, the person first rises, and, by degrees, returns <lb/>
            to all his senses, and re-possesses the right state of his soul.</p>
          <p>When these substances, therefore, the mind and the soul, <lb/>
            are shaken with such powerful diseases in the body itself, and <lb/>
            suffer, distracted in such miserable ways, why do you conceive <lb/>
            that the same mind and soul can support an existence with­ <lb/>
            out a body, in the open air, and amidst strong winds ?</p>
          <p>And since we see that the mind may be healed,2 like a sick <lb/>
            body, and wrought upon by means of medicine, this also sig­ <lb/>
            nifies that the mind exists only as a mortal substance. For <lb/>
            whoever attempts, and commences, to change the mind, or to <lb/>
            alter any other nature or substance 3 whatsoever, it is requi­ <lb/>
            site either that he add new parts, or transpose the parts in a <lb/>
            new order, or take away at least some small portion from the <lb/>
            whole. But any substance, which is immortal, neither allows <note type="footnote"> 1 The course of the road is paved for them.] Ver. 497. Sung <lb/>

            he wished to cancel the whole verse, but, as it seems, without rea­ <lb/>
            son. We say of a man who drinks very hot liquids, that his throat <lb/>

            The sixth argument. Since the mind, when affected by sickness, is <lb/>

            suppose that the mind is mortal like the body ? </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To alter any other nature or substance.] Ver. 515. Aliam quam­ <lb/>

            its parts to be transposed, nor to-be-increased-by-addition, nor <lb/>
            permits an atom to pass away from them. For whatever, <lb/>
            being changed, goes beyond1 its own limits, this change is <lb/>
            forthwith the death or termination of that which it was before.</p>
          <p>The mind, therefore, whether it be diseased, or whether it <lb/>
            be wrought upon by medicine, exhibits, as I have demonstrated, <lb/>
            mortal symptoms: so far is the force of true reason seen to <lb/>
            oppose false 2 reasoning, and to cut off escape from him who <lb/>
            shrinks from its conclusions, and to overthrow what is wrong <lb/>
            by a double refutation.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we often see a man decay by degrees,3 and <lb/>
            lose his vital power in one limb after another. On the feet <lb/>
            we observe the toes and nails first grow livid; then the feet <lb/>
            themselves and the legs mortify; afterwards, throughout the <lb/>
            other limbs, we perceive the traces of cold death thence pro­ <lb/>
            ceed step by step.4 And since the substance of the soul is <lb/>
            thus divided, and does not continue, always and at the same <lb/>
            time, entire and unimpaired, it must be deemed mortal. But <lb/>
            if perchance you think that the soul can itself contract itself <lb/>
            internally throughout the limbs, and condense its parts into <lb/>
            one place, and thus withdraw feeling from all the members <note type="footnote"> I For whatever, being changed, goes beyond, &amp;c] See i. 378, 875; <lb/>

            successively, yet, in such a case, that place in which so great <lb/>
            a mass of soul is collected, ought to seem in possession of <lb/>
            greater feeling. But since this place of such increased feel­ <lb/>
            ing is no where apparent, the soul, as we said before, is <lb/>
            evidently, being separated-into-parts, scattered abroad, and <lb/>
            therefore perishes.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if we even consent to grant that which is false, <lb/>
            and to allow that the soul may be thus concentrated in the <lb/>
            bodies of those who leave light and life by dying part after <lb/>
            part, you must still confess that the soul is mortal; for neither <lb/>
            is it of any importance whether it perishes, being scattered <lb/>
            throughout the air, or loses its sense when drawn together <lb/>
            from being dispersed in its several parts, 1 when animation <lb/>
            steals away from the whole man more and more on all sides, <lb/>
            and less and less of life is every where left.</p>
          <p>And as the mind is one single part 2 of a man, and remains <lb/>
            fixed in a certain place, as the ears and eyes are, and the other <lb/>
            organs of sense, whatsoever govern life; and as the hand, and <lb/>
            the eye or nose, when detached from us, cannot, separately of <lb/>
            themselves, have sensation or even existence, for, when cut off, <lb/>
            they are in a short time wasted with putrefaction; so the <lb/>

            again, can the body, deprived of the soul, continue its state of <lb/>
            existence, and use its faculties. Just, for example, 1 as the <lb/>
            eye itself, torn from its roots, can discern no object apart <lb/>
            from the whole body, so the mind or soul seems to have no <lb/>
            power in itself; evidently because when mingled throughout <lb/>
            the veins and viscera, throughout the nerves and bones, they <lb/>
            are held-in-close-confinement by the whole body, and their <lb/>
            primary-particles, not being free, cannot fly asunder to great <lb/>
            distances; consequently, being thus confined, they move with <lb/>
            sensitive motions, with which, after death, when cast forth <lb/>
            beyond the body into the air of heaven, they cannot move; <lb/>
            for this very reason, that they are not held-confined in a si­ <lb/>
            milar manner. For surely the air forms body and soul,2 if <lb/>
            the soul shall be able to keep itself together in the air, and <lb/>
            to contain itself for exerting those motions, which it before <lb/>
            exercised amidst the nerves, and in the body itself. On <lb/>
            which account, 1 say again and again, you must necessarily <lb/>
            admit that when the whole enclosure of the body is dissolved, <lb/>
            and the vital breath cast forth, the sentient-existence of the <lb/>
            mind and the soul is dissolved; since there is common cause <lb/>
            and like fate to both.</p>

            soul, without putrifying with offensive odour, why do you <lb/>
            doubt but that the essence of the soul, rising from the depths <lb/>
            and innermost part of the body, has passed forth, and has been <lb/>
            diffused abroad like smoke ? and that for this reason the body, <lb/>
            decaying with so great a dissolution, has utterly fallen away, <lb/>
            because the foundations 1 have been removed from their place, <lb/>
            and the spirits pass out through the limbs, and through all <lb/>
            the windings of the passages and ducts that are in the body ? <lb/>
            So that you may understand from many considerations, that <lb/>
            the nature or substance of the soul, being disparted, has gone <lb/>
            out through the members of the body, and that it was disse­ <lb/>
            vered within the body itself, before, gliding outwards, it flowed <lb/>
            forth into the air of heaven.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whilst the soul dwells within the bounds2 of life, <lb/>
            it yet frequently, when it has received a shock from some <lb/>
            cause, seems to pass away, and presents the appearance that <lb/>
            the mind is let loose from the whole body; and the counte­ <lb/>
            nance then seems to become inanimate as at the last hour, and <lb/>
            all the relaxed members to fail the languid frame. Such is <lb/>
            the case, when it is said that the mind has been damaged,3 or <lb/>
            the vital power has suffered-syncope; while all is trepidation, <lb/>
            and all are anxious to recover the last link of life. For then <lb/>
            all the mind, and power of the soul, are shaken; and these, <lb/>
            it is evident, sink with the body itself; so that a cause of some­ <lb/>
            what greater force may bring them to dissolution.</p>
          <p>Why then do you doubt, but that, at the hour of death, the <lb/>

            decay in that part; as he is conscious of the other senses <lb/>
            losing-their-power each in its own quarter ; but if our soul <lb/>
            were immortal, it would not so much complain that it suffers <lb/>

            we must consider it, as I suppose, to be endowed with the <lb/>
            five senses; nor in any other way can we represent to our­ <lb/>
            selves the infernal souls as wandering on the banks of the <lb/>
            Acheron. Accordingly painters, and the past generations of <lb/>
            writers, have introduced in their compositions souls thus en­ <lb/>
            dowed with senses. But neither can the eyes, nor the nos­ <lb/>
            trils, nor the hand itself, preserve-existence apart from the <lb/>
            soul; nor can the tongue; nor can the ears perceive hearing, <lb/>
            or even remain-in-being, apart from the soul. How then can <lb/>
            souls be possessed of the five senses, when all the organs of <lb/>
            those senses have perished ?</p>
          <p>And since we see that the vital sense spreads through the <lb/>
            whole body, 1 and that the whole is animated, if, on a sud­ <lb/>
            den, any violence shall cut through the body in the middle, so <lb/>
            as to sever the two parts asunder, the substance of the soul, <lb/>
            also, without doubt, being disunited and divided together with <lb/>
            the body, will be dispersed and scattered abroad. But that <lb/>
            which is divided, and separates into any parts, evidently <lb/>
            shows that it has not an ever-during nature.</p>
          <p>People relate that chariots armed with scythes, warm with <lb/>
            promiscuous slaughter, often cut off limbs with such sudden­ <lb/>
            ness, that the part which, being severed, has fallen from the <lb/>
            body, is seen to quiver on the ground, when, notwithstanding, <lb/>
            the mind and spirit of the man, from the quickness of the <lb/>
            wound, cannot feel any pain. And because at the same time, <lb/>
            the mind, in the ardour of battle, is given up to action, it <lb/>
            pursues fighting and slaughter with the remainder of the <lb/>
            body; nor is one man aware, frequently, in the midst of the <lb/>
            horses, that the wheels and amputating scythes have carried <lb/>
            away his left hand, which is lost together with its defence, <lb/>
            nor is another conscious, while he climbs the wall and presses <lb/>
            forward, that his right hand has dropped off. A third next <lb/>
            attempts to rise after having lost his leg, while his dying foot, <lb/>
            close by him, moves its toes on the ground. And the head of <note type="footnote"> 1 And since-vital sense-through the whole body.] Ver. 634. <lb/>
            The fifteenth argument. Since the soul spreads through the body, it <lb/>
            may be divided with the body - but that which may be divided is <lb/>
            mortal. Or shall we say that when a limb is cut off from the body, <lb/>
            and shows that it retains life in it, there is still in it a soul? But to <lb/>
            assert this would be to assert that one animal has many souls. </note> <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. III. 655-679."/> <lb/>
            a fourth, severed from the warm and living trunk, keeps, <lb/>
            while lying on the ground, its look of life and its eyes open, <lb/>
            until it has yielded up all remains of the soul within it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if, when the tongue of a serpent vibrates against <lb/>
            you, and his tail and long body threaten you, you may feel <lb/>
            inclined to cut both tail and body into several parts with your <lb/>
            sword, you will see all the parts separately, cut through with <lb/>
            the recent wound, writhe about, and sprinkle the earth with <lb/>
            blood; and you will observe the fore part, turning backward, <lb/>
            seeking itself, that is, the hinder part of the body, with its <lb/>
            mouth, so that, pierced with the burning anguish of the <lb/>
            wound, it may seize it with its teeth.</p>
          <p>Shall we then say that there are entire souls in all those <lb/>
            several parts ? But from that position it will follow that one <lb/>
            living creature had several souls in its single body. And since <lb/>
            this is absurd, we must admit, therefore, that that has been <lb/>
            divided which was one with the body; wherefore both must <lb/>
            be thought to be mortal; since both are equally divided into <lb/>
            several portions.</p>
          <p>Besides, if the nature of the soul exists imperishable, and <lb/>
            is infused into men at their birth, why are we unable to re­ <lb/>
            member the period-of-existence previously spent by us, nor <lb/>
            retain any traces of past transactions ? For if the power of <lb/>
            the mind is so exceedingly changed, that all remembrance of <lb/>
            past things has departed from. it, that change, as I think, is <lb/>
            not far removed from death itself For which reason you <lb/>
            must of necessity acknowledge, that whatever soul previously <lb/>
            existed has perished, and that that which exists for the pre­ <lb/>
            sent has been produced for the present.</p>
          <p>Again, if, after the body is completely formed,2 the vital <note type="footnote"> 1 Besides, if the nature of the soul — infused into men, Sc.] Ver. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n=" B. III. 680-703"/> <lb/>
            power of the soul is wont to be introduced into us at the very <lb/>
            time when we are born and when we cross the threshold of <lb/>
            life, it would not be in accordance with this, that it should seem, <lb/>
            as it now seems, to have grown up in the blood itself together <lb/>
            with the body, and with its several members; but it would <lb/>
            rather be natural that it should live alone, as in a cage, by <lb/>
            itself and for itself; though in such a manner, that the whole <lb/>
            body, by its influence, should abound with sense and vitality. <lb/>
            For which reason, I say again and again, we must neither <lb/>
            think that souls are without beginning, nor that they are exempt <lb/>
            from the law of death. For neither must we deem that souls, <lb/>
            if infused into us from without, could have been so completely <lb/>
            united with our bodies; (which complete union, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, manifest experience proves to take place; for the soul <lb/>
            is so combined with the body throughout the veins, viscera, <lb/>
            nerves, and bones, that even the very teeth have a share of <lb/>
            feeling; as their aching proves, and the acute-pain from cold <lb/>
            water, and the cranching of a hard pebble1 suddenly among <lb/>
            our food;) nor, when they are so completely united, does it <lb/>
            seem possible for them to come out entire, and to extricate <lb/>
            themselves unharmed from all the nerves, and bones, and <lb/>
            joints.</p>
          <p>But if still, perchance, you think that a soul, infused from <lb/>
            without,2 is wont to expand itself through our limbs, yet to <lb/>
            admittthis, is only to admit that every man's soul, being spread <lb/>
            out with the body, will so much the more certainly perish <lb/>
            with it. For that which is diffused throughout the body, is <lb/>

            not be possible for the soul to be justly accounted immortal; <lb/>
            since when she took her departure, sce was diminished of some <lb/>
            lost particles. But if, when removed, she fled with all her <lb/>
            parts so entire, that she left no atoms of her substance in the <lb/>
            body, whence do dead carcasses, when the viscera become pu­ <lb/>
            trid, send forth worms ? And whence does such an abund­ <lb/>
            ance of living creatures, void of bones and blood, swarm over <lb/>
            the swollen limbs ?</p>

            suppose that they may pass each into its own body, and yet <lb/>
            omit to consider for what cause many thousands of souls should <lb/>
            congregate in the place from which one soul has withdrawn, <lb/>
            this point, however, which you leave out of consideration, is <lb/>
            of such a nature, that it seems especially worthy to be sought <lb/>
            into and brought under examination. It is proper not only <lb/>
            to reflect, I say, whether souls hunt for particular atoms of <lb/>
            worms, and build for themselves carcasses in which they may <lb/>
            dwell, or whether they infuse themselves into bodies already <lb/>
            made; but also to consider that there is no reason to be given 1 <lb/>
            why they should make bodies, or why they should labour at <lb/>
            all; for, while they are without a body, they fly about undis­ <lb/>
            turbed by diseases, and cold, and hunger; since it is the body <lb/>
            that rather labours under these maladies, (as well as from <lb/>
            death,) and the soul suffers all evils from contact with it. <lb/>
            But, nevertheless, let it be as advantageous as you please for <lb/>
            these souls to make a body which they may enter, there seems, <lb/>
            however, to be no means by which they may make it. It is <lb/>
            fair, therefore, to conclude that souls do not make for them­ <lb/>
            selves bodies and limbs. Nor yet is there a possibility, as it <lb/>
            appears, that they can be infused into bodies perfectly-formed; <lb/>
            for neither under that supposition can they be exactly fitted <lb/>
            together; nor will their mutual-motions be carried on with <lb/>
            sympathy.</p>

            body to body, how is it that, occasionally, the dispositions of animals <lb/>
            have not been varied by a difference in the souls that have passed <lb/>
            into them? How is it, for example, that the soul of a lion, passing <lb/>
            into a stag, has never produced a lion-like stag, or that a human <lb/>
            soul, passing into a horse, has never made a rational horse? Or, <lb/>
            supposing human souls restricted to human bodies, how is it that <lb/>
            the soul of a man, passing into a child, has never produced a mature­ <lb/>
            minded child? What reason can be given for the non-occurrence <lb/>
            of such phenomena, but that no such transmigrations take place, and <lb/>
            that in every individual body its own particular soul is generated <lb/>
            grows, and decays? </note> <pb n="131"/>

            fear add speed to their limbs ? And as to other qualities of <lb/>
            this sort, why do they all generate, in the body and temper­ <lb/>
            ament, from the earliest period of life, if it be not because a <lb/>
            certain disposition of mind grows up together with each body <lb/>
            from its own seed and stock ? But if the soul were immortal, <lb/>
            and were accustomed, as the Pythagoreans think, to change <lb/>
            bodies, surely animals would gradually alter, and grow of <lb/>
            mixed dispositions; the dog of Hyrcanian breed would often <lb/>
            flee from the assault of the horned stag; the hawk, flying <lb/>
            through the air of heaven, would tremble at the approach of <lb/>
            the dove; men would lose their understanding, and the savage <lb/>
            tribes of wild beasts become reasonable.</p>
          <p>For that which some assert, namely, that an immortal soul <lb/>
            is altered by a change of body, is advanced upon false reason­ <lb/>
            ing ; as that which is altered, loses its consistence, and there­ <lb/>
            fore perishes; since the parts are transposed, and depart from <lb/>
            their original arrangement; wherefore the parts of the soul, <lb/>
            under this hypothesis, must also be subject to dissolution <lb/>
            throughout the limbs; so that finally they may all perish to­ <lb/>
            gether with the body.</p>
          <p>But if they shall say that the souls of men always migrate <lb/>
            into human bodies, I shall nevertheless ask, why a soul, from <lb/>
            being wise in a wise body, should possibly become foolish in <lb/>
            the body of a fool; why no child is found discreet, or inform­ <lb/>
            ed with a soul of mature understanding, and why no foal of <lb/>
            a mare is as skilful in his paces as the horse of full vigour ? <lb/>
            why, I say, is this, if it be not because a certain temper of <lb/>
            mind grows up with each body from its own seed and stock ? <lb/>
            These philosophers, forsooth, will take refuge in the assertion, 1 <lb/>
            that the mind becomes tender in a tender body ; but if this <lb/>
            be the case, you must admit that the soul is mortal, since, <lb/>
            being so exceedingly changed in its new body, it loses its <lb/>
            former vitality and powers.</p>
          <p>Or in what way will the vigour of a soul,2 strengthened in <note type="footnote"> 1Take refuge in the assertion.] Ver. 769. " Confugient eo <lb/>
            scilicet, ut dicant mentem tenerascere in corpore tenero." Lambi­ <lb/>

            ever is immortal is unchangeable. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Or in what way will the vigour of a soul, Ver. 770. Having <lb/>

            forcible character. I shall entitle these, additional observations. The </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a </note> <pb n="132"/>

            concert with each particular body, be able to reach with it <lb/>
            the desired flower of mature age, unless it shall be joined to it <lb/>
            in its first origin ? Or with what motive does the soul go <lb/>
            forth from limbs that are grown old ? Does it fear to remain <lb/>
            imprisoned in a decaying-carcass, lest it should decay with it? <lb/>
            Or is it afraid lest its tenement, shaken with a long course of <lb/>
            life, should fall and overwhelm it? But to that which is <lb/>
            immortal, there are no such dangers.</p>
          <p>Moreover, to imagine that souls stand ready 1 at the amor­ <lb/>
            ous intercourses, or parturitions, of beasts, to enter into the <lb/>
            young, seems exceedingly ridiculous. It appears too absurd to <lb/>
            suppose that immortal beings, in infinite numbers, should <lb/>
            wait for mortal bodies, and contend emulously among them­ <lb/>
            selves which shall be first and foremost to enter ;-unless per­ <lb/>
            chance you suppose that agreements have been made among <lb/>
            the souls, that the first which shall have come flying to the <lb/>
            body, shall have first ingress, and that they may thus have <lb/>
            no contest in strength with one another.</p>
          <p>Again, neither can a tree exist in the sky,2 nor clouds in <lb/>
            the deep sea; nor can fish live in the fields; nor blood be <lb/>
            in wood, nor liquid in stones. It is fixed and arranged where <lb/>
            every thing may grow and subsist; thus the nature or sub­ <lb/>
            stance of the mind cannot spring up alone without the body, <lb/>
            or exist apart from the nerves and the blood. Whereas if this <lb/>
            could happen, the power of the mind might at times rather <lb/>
            arise in the head or the shoulders, or the bottom of the heels, <lb/>
            and might rather accustom itself to grow in any place, than to re­ <lb/>
            main in the same man and in the same receptacle.3 But since <lb/>
            it seems fixed and appointed also in our own body, where the <note type="footnote"> first is, that if the soul were independent of the body, and not born <lb/>
            with it, it would hardly desire to live in it from its infancy to its <lb/>
            maturity, and, if not afraid to die with it, would hardly be always <lb/>
            found to leave it at an advanced age. </note><note type="footnote"> I Moreover, to imagine that souls stand ready, &amp;c.] Ver. 777. <lb/>

            soul and the mind may subsist and grow up by themselves, it <lb/>
            is so much the more to be denied that they can endure and be <lb/>
            produced out of the entire body. For which reason, when the <lb/>
            body has perished, you must necessarily admit that the soul, <lb/>
            which is diffused throughout the body, has perished with it.</p>
          <p>Besides, to join the mortal to the immortal, 1 and to suppose <lb/>
            that they can sympathize together, and perform mutual opera­ <lb/>
            tions, is to think absurdly; for what can be conceived more <lb/>
            at variance with reason, or more inconsistent and irreconcila­ <lb/>
            ble in itself, than that that which is mortal, joined to that which <lb/>
            is imperishable and eternal, should submit to endure violent <lb/>
            storms and troubles in combination with it ?</p>
          <p>Further, whatsoever bodies remain eternal, must either, as <lb/>
            being of a solid consistence, repel blows, and suffer nothing to <lb/>
            penetrate them, that can disunite their compact parts within ; <lb/>
            (such as are the primary-particles of matter, the nature of <lb/>
            which we have shown above;) or they must be able to en­ <lb/>
            dure throughout all time, because they are free from blows, <lb/>
            or unsusceptible of them ; (as is a vacuum, which remains in­ <lb/>
            tangible, and suffers nothing from a stroke;) or they must be <lb/>
            indestructible for this reason, that there is no sufficiency of <lb/>
            space round about, into which their constituent substances may, <lb/>
            as it were, separate and be dissolved ; (as the entire universe is <lb/>
            eternal, inasmuch as there is neither any space without it into <lb/>
            which its parts may disperse; nor are there any bodies <lb/>
            which may fall upon it, and break it to pieces by a violent <lb/>
            concussion:) but, as I have shown, neither is the nature of <lb/>
            the soul of a solid consistence, since with all compound bodies <lb/>
            vacuum is mixed; nor is it like a vacuum itself; nor, again, <lb/>
            are bodies wanting, which, rising fortuitously from the infi­ <lb/>
            nite of things, may overturn this frame of the mind with a <lb/>
            violent tempest, or bring upon it some other kind of disaster <lb/>
            and danger; nor, moreover, is vastness and profundity of <lb/>
            space wanting, into which the substance of the soul may be <lb/>
            dispersed, or may otherwise perish and be overwhelmed by <lb/>
            any other kind of force. The gate of death, therefore, is <lb/>
            not shut against the mind and soul. <note type="footnote"> 1 Besides, to join the mortal to the immortal, &amp;c.] Ver. 801. <lb/>

          <p>But if perchance the soul, in the opinion of any, is to be <lb/>
            accounted immortal the more on this account,3 that it is kept <lb/>
            fortified by things preservative of life; or because objects <lb/>
            adverse to its safety do not all approach it; or because those <lb/>
            that do approach, being by some means diverted, retreat be­ <lb/>

            those who think thus is evidently far removed from just rea­ <lb/>
            soning. For besides that it sickens from diseases of the body, <lb/>
            there often happens something to trouble it concerning fu­ <lb/>
            ture events, and keep it disquieted in fear, and harass it <lb/>
            with cares; while remorse for faults, from past acts wickedly <lb/>
            and foolishly committed, torments and distresses it. Join <lb/>
            to these afflictions the insanity peculiar to the mind, and the <lb/>
            oblivion of all things; and add, besides, that it is often sunk <lb/>
            into the black waves of lethargy.</p>
          <p>Death, therefore, is nothing, nor at all concerns us, since <lb/>
            the nature or substance of the soul is to be accounted mortal. <lb/>
            And as, in past time, we felt no anxiety, when the Cartha­ <lb/>
            ginians gathered on all sides to fight with ourforefathers, and <lb/>
            when all things under the lofty air of heaven, shaken with the <lb/>
            dismaying tumult of war, trembled with dread ; and men were <lb/>
            uncertain to the sway of which power every thing human, by <lb/>
            land and by sea, was to fall; so, when we shall cease to be, <lb/>
            when there shall be a separation of the body and soul of which <lb/>
            we are conjointly composed, it is certain that to us, who shall <lb/>
            not then exist, nothing will by any possibility happen, or ex­ <lb/>
            cite our feeling, not even if the earth shall be mingled with <lb/>
            the sea, and the sea with the heaven.</p>
          <p>And even if the substance of the mind, and the powers of <lb/>
            the soul, after they have been separated from our body, still <lb/>
            retain-their-faculties, it is nothing to us, who subsist only as <lb/>
            being conjointly constituted by an arrangement and union of <lb/>
            body and soul together. Nor, if time should collect our ma­ <lb/>
            terial-atoms after death, and restore them again as they are <lb/>
            now placed, and the light of life should be given back to us, <lb/>
            would it yet at all concern us that this were done, when the <lb/>

            Ver. 874, seq. This passage, as given by Wakefield and copied <lb/>
            by Forbiger, is one of the most unsatisfactory in Lucretius. In <lb/>
            Lambinus's edition, and all others before Wakefield, the passage <lb/>
            stood thus: <lb/>

            rupts all consciousness, and prevents all memory of the past, <lb/>
            precludes the possibility of this ; and since the circumstance of <lb/>

            infected with mala scabies, of which learned men should have been <lb/>
            ashamed, and re-modelled the whole thus: <lb/>
            Debet enim misere est quoi forte aegreque futurum, <lb/>
            Ipse quoque esse in eo turn tempore, quoi male possit <lb/>
            Adcidere : id quoniam mors eximit, esseque prohibet <lb/>
            Ilium, quoi possint incommoda conciliari <lb/>
            Hæc eadem, quibus è nunc nos Humus, ante fuisse; <lb/>
            Scire licet, &amp;c. <lb/>
            Giving the following as the order and sense: " Quoniam mors ex­ <lb/>
            imit id, et (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign>) fuisse ante prohibet ilium, cui haec incommoda pos­ <lb/>
            sint conciliari, esse eadem (semina), è quibus nos nunc sumus <lb/>
            (compositi)." According to this interpretation, there ought to be a <lb/>
            comma after Hœc, but there is not, either in any edition of Wake­ <lb/>
            field, or in those of Eichstadt and Forbiger, who both copied him. <lb/>
            As I have followed Wakefield's text, I have also followed, as the <lb/>
            reader will see, his interpretation; but surely to make ante fuisse <lb/>
            the nominative case to prohibet, to refer hœc to incommoda, and to <lb/>
            couple eadem with the remote esse, can be satisfactory to few. Lach­ <lb/>
            mann, the last editor, makes a transposition of a verse, which I <lb/>
            cannot exhibit to the reader without transcribing a few previous <lb/>
            lines: <lb/>
            Facile hoc adcredere possis, <lb/>
            Semina sæpe in eodem, ut nunc sunt, ordine posta <lb/>
            Hæc eadem, quibus è nunc nos sumus, ante fuisse: <lb/>
            Nec memori tamen id quimus repraehendere mente: <lb/>
            Inter enim jectast vitaï pausa, vageque <lb/>
            Deerrarunt passim motus a sensibus omnes. <lb/>
            Debet enim, misere si forte aegreque futurumst, <lb/>
            Ipse quoque esse in eo turn tempore, cui male possit <lb/>
            Accidere : id quoniam mors eximit, esseque probet (for prohibet) <lb/>
            Illum cui possit incommoda conciliari, <lb/>
            Scire licet nobis, &amp;c, <lb/>
            This may be partly right, but, if I may venture to express an <lb/>
            opinion, I should say that no alteration will restore the passage to <lb/>
            its genuine state, unless it be such as shall, by whatever method, <lb/>
            join conciliari with semina; for concilio, conciliatus, and concilium are <lb/>
            words which Lucretius delights to apply to his atoms; and the <lb/>
            phrase incommoda conciliari " could hardly be regarded, in any <lb/>
            uta comic author, (malè conciliati occurs in Plaut. Pseud, i. 2, 1,) <lb/>
            otherwise than with suspicion. </note> <pb n="137"/>

            dated, from existing a second time, (with any recollection of <lb/>
            his other life,) as the same combination of atoms of which we <lb/>
            now consist, we may be assured that in death there is nothing <lb/>
            to be dreaded by us; that he who does not exist, cannot be­ <lb/>
            come miserable; and that it makes not the least difference to <lb/>
            a man, when immortal death has ended his mortal life, that <lb/>
            he was ever born at all.</p>
          <p>Whenever, therefore, you see a man express concern that <lb/>
            it should be his lot after death either to putrify on the ground <lb/>
            when his body is laid aside, or to be destroyed by flames, or <lb/>
            by the jaws of wild beasts, you may know that his mind is <lb/>
            not in a healthy state, and that some secret disquietude as to <lb/>
            his fate is concealed in his breast, although he may himself <lb/>
            deny that he believes any consciousness will remain to him <lb/>
            after death. For, as I think, he does not make good what he <lb/>
            professes, nor speaks from conviction, from which he pretends <lb/>
            to speak ;1 nor withdraws and removes himself, in thought, <lb/>
            wholly out of life, but, foolish as he is, makes something of <lb/>
            himself still to survive. For when any one of such a character <lb/>
            represents to himself, while alive, that birds and beasts will <lb/>
            tear his body at death, he is seized with commiseration for <lb/>
            himself; for neither does he at all distinguish himself dead <lb/>
            from himself living, nor sufficiently withdraw himself from <lb/>
            his exposed carcass; but supposes it to be still himself, and <lb/>
            standing by it, in imagination, communicates to it a portion <lb/>
            of his own feeling. Hence he is concerned that he was born <lb/>
            mortal, nor reflects that in real death there will remain of him <lb/>
            no other self, which, surviving, may mourn for him that he <lb/>
            has perished, and, standing upright, may lament that he, lying <lb/>
            down, is torn in pieces or burnt to ashes. For if it is an evil <lb/>
            at death, to be ill-treated by the jaws and teeth of wild beasts, <lb/>
            I do not see how it can be otherwise than unpleasant for a <lb/>
            man, being laid on a funeral-pyre, to burn in hot flames, <lb/>
            or, placed in honey, to be suffocated,2 or to grow stiff with <lb/>

            receive you, nor your excellent wife; nor shall your dear <lb/>
            children run to snatch kisses, and touch your breast with <lb/>
            secret delight. You will no more be able to be in flourishing <lb/>
            circumstances, and to be a protection to your friends. Un­ <lb/>
            happily, one adverse day has taken from you, unfortunate <lb/>
            man, all the numerous blessings of life." In such remarks <lb/>
            they do not add this, " Nor now, moreover, does any regret <lb/>
            for those things remain with you." 1 Which truth if men would <lb/>
            well consider in their thoughts, and adhere to it in their words, <lb/>
            they would relieve themselves from much anxiety and fear of <lb/>
            mind. " You, for your part," says a mourner over a corpse, <lb/>
            " laid to sleep in your bed, will so remain as you are for what­ <lb/>
            ever time is to come, released from all distressing griefs; but <lb/>
            we, standing near you, shall inconsolably lament you reduced to <lb/>
            ashes on the awful pyre; and no lapse of time shall remove our <lb/>
            unfading sorrow from our hearts." Of him, however, who <lb/>
            makes such lamentations, we may ask this question, "If the <lb/>
            matter of death is reduced to sleep and rest, what can there be <lb/>
            so bitter in it, that any one should pine in eternal grief for <lb/>
            the decease of a friend ?"</p>
          <p>This also is often a practice among men, that when they <lb/>
            have sat down to a feast, and hold their cups in their hands, <lb/>
            and overshadow their faces with chaplets, they say seriously <lb/>
            and from their hearts, " This enjoyment is but short to us <lb/>
            little men; soon it will have passed; nor will it ever here­ <lb/>
            after be possible to recall it." As if at their death this evil <lb/>
            were to be dreaded above all, that parching thirst should scorch <lb/>
            and burn up the wretches, or an insatiable longing for some <lb/>
            other thing should settle on them. Yet how different will be <lb/>
            the fact! Since not even when the mind and body are merely <lb/>
            at rest together in sleep, will any one feel concern for himself <lb/>
            and his life; for, for our parts, our sleep might thus be eternal; <lb/>
            nor does any care for ourselves affect us; and yet, at that sea­ <lb/>
            son, the atoms, throughout our limbs, withdraw to no great <lb/>
            distance from sensible motions, 2 and the man who is suddenly­ <note type="footnote">len. v. 3, 19) mentions that Agesipolis, one of the Spartan kings, <lb/>

            roused from sleep quickly recollects himself. Death, then, we <lb/>
            must consider to be of far less concern to us, if less can be than <lb/>
            that which we see to be nothing. For a greater separation of <lb/>
            the atoms of matter takes place in death, nor does any man <lb/>
            awake when once the cold pause of life has overtaken him.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, if UNIVERSAL NATURE should suddenly utter <lb/>
            a voice, and thus herself upbraid any one of us: "What <lb/>
            mighty cause have you, 0 mortal, thus excessively to in­ <lb/>
            dulge in bitter grief? Why do you groan and weep, at the <lb/>
            thought of death ? For if your past and former life has been <lb/>
            an object of gratification to you, and all your blessings have <lb/>
            not, as if poured into a leaky vessel, flowed away and been <lb/>
            lost without pleasure, why do you not, 0 unreasonable man, <lb/>
            retire like a guest satisfied with life, and take your undisturbed <lb/>
            rest with resignation ? But if those things, of which you have <lb/>
            had the use, have been wasted and lost, and life is offensive <lb/>
            to you, why do you seek to incur further trouble,2 which may <lb/>
            all again pass away and end in dissatisfaction ? Why do you not <lb/>
            rather put an end to life and anxiety? For there is nothing <lb/>
            further, which I can contrive and discover to please you ; every <lb/>
            thing is always the same. If your body is not yet withered <lb/>
            with years, and your limbs are not worn out and grown feeble, <lb/>
            yet all things remain the same, even if you should go on to out­ <lb/>
            last all ages in living ; and still more would you see them <lb/>
            the same, if you should never come to die." What do we <lb/>
            answer to this, but that Nature brings a just charge against <lb/>
            uUS, and sets forth in her words a true allegation ?</p>
          <p>But would she not more justly reproach and upbraid, in se­ <lb/>
            vere accents, him who, being miserable unreasonably, deplores <lb/>
            death ? " Away with thy tears, wretch," she might well say, "and <lb/>
            forbear thy complaints." But if he who is older, and more <lb/>
            advanced in years, complain, sce may retort thus: " After <lb/>
            having been possessed of all the most valuable things of life, <lb/>
            thou pinest and wastest away with age. But, because thou. <lb/>

            Now, however, resign all things unsuitable to thy age, and <lb/>
            yield at once, with submissive feelings, to that which is <lb/>
            stronger than thum;1 for it is necessary." And justly, as I <lb/>
            think, would she address him; justly would she upbraid and re­ <lb/>
            proach him; for that which is old, driven out by that which is <lb/>
            new, always retires, and it is indispensable to repair one thing <lb/>
            out of another; nor is any man consigned to the gulf of Erebus, <lb/>
            or black Tartarus, but allowed to retire peaceably to a dream <lb/>
            less sleep. The matter, of which thou art made, is wanted <lb/>
            by nature that succeeding generations may grow up from it; <lb/>
            all which, however, when they have passed their appointed <lb/>
            term of life, will follow thee: and so have other generations, <lb/>
            before these, fallen into destruction; and other generations, <lb/>
            not less certainly than thyself, will fall. Thus shall one thing <lb/>
            never cease to rise from another; and thus is life given to <lb/>
            none in possession, but to all only for use.</p>
          <p>Consider, also, how utterly unimportant to us was the past <lb/>
            antiquity of infinite time, that elapsed before we were born. <lb/>
            This, then, nature exhibits to us as a specimen of the time <lb/>
            which will be again after our death. For what does there <lb/>
            appear terrible in it ? Does any thing seem gloomy ? Is not <lb/>
            all more free from trouble than any sleep ?</p>
          <p>And of the souls likewise, whatever are said to be in the <lb/>
            profundity of Acheron, all the sufferings happen to ourselves, <lb/>
            not in death, but in life. Tantalus, torpid with vain terror, <lb/>
            does not (as it is reported) fear the huge rock impending over <lb/>
            him in the air; but such terror rather dwells with us in life; <lb/>
            a groundless fear of the gods oppresses mortals, and they dread <lb/>
            that fall which fortune may assign to each.</p>

          <p>A Sisyphus, likewise, is before our eyes in life, who sets <lb/>
            his heart 1 to solicit from the people the fasces and sharp axes, <lb/>

            in their course, and bring their fruits and various charms; <lb/>
            whilst we, notwithstanding, are never satisfied with the bless­ <lb/>
            ings of life; this is, I think, that which they relate of the <lb/>
            damsels in the flower of their youth, that they pour water into <lb/>
            a punctured vessel, which, however, can by no means be filled.</p>
          <p>But also Cerberus and the Furies are mentioned, and pri­ <lb/>

          <p>If men could feel, as they seem to feel, that there is an <lb/>
            oppression on their minds, which wearies them with its <lb/>
            weight, and could also perceive from what causes it arises, <lb/>
            and whence so great a mass, as it were, of evil exists in their <lb/>
            breasts, they would not live in the manner in which we <lb/>
            generally see them living; for we observe them uncertain what <lb/>
            they would have, and always inquiringly something new; and <lb/>
            changing their place, as if by the change they could lay aside <lb/>
            a load.</p>
          <p>He, who has grown weary of remaining at home, often <lb/>
            goes forth from his vast mansion, and suddenly returns, inas­ <lb/>
            much as he perceives that he is nothing bettered by being <lb/>
            abroad. He runs precipitately, hurrying on his horses, to his <lb/>
            villa, as if he were eager to carry succour to an edifice on <lb/>
            fire; but, as soon as he has touched the threshold of the <lb/>
            building, he yawns, or falls heavily to sleep, and seeks for­ <lb/>
            getfulness of himself or even with equal haste goes back and <lb/>
            revisits the city.</p>
          <p>In this way each man flees from himself; but himself as it <lb/>
            always happens, whom he cannot escape, and whom he still <lb/>
            hates, adheres to him in spite of his efforts; and for this rea­ <lb/>
            son, that the sick man does not know the cause of his disease, <lb/>
            which if every one could understand, he would, in the first <lb/>
            place, having laid aside all other pursuits, study to learn the <lb/>
            NATURE OF THINGS; since in such inquiries the state of eter­ <lb/>
            nity, not of one hour merely, is concerned; a state in which <lb/>
            the whole age of mortals, whatever remains after death, must <lb/>
            continue.</p>
          <p>Besides, why does so pernicious and so strong desire of ex­ <lb/>
            istence compel us to remain anxious in uncertain perils ? A <lb/>
            certain bound of life is fixed to mortals; nor can death be <lb/>
            avoided, or can we exempt ourselves from undergoing it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we are continually engaged and fixed in the <lb/>
            same occupations; nor, by the prolongation of life, is any <lb/>
            new pleasure discovered. Yet that which we desire, seems, <pb n="144"/>

            while it is distant in the future, to excel all other objects; <lb/>
            but afterwards, when it has fallen to our lot, we covet some­ <lb/>
            thing else; and thus a uniform thirst of life occupies us, long­ <lb/>
            ino, earnestly for that which is to come; while what fate the <lb/>
            last period may bring us, or what chances may throw in our <lb/>
            way, or what death awaits us, still remains in uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Nor, by protracting life, do we deduct a single moment <lb/>
            from the duration of death; we cannot diminish aught1 from <lb/>
            its reign, or cause that we may be for a less period sunk in <lb/>
            non-existence. How many generations soever, therefore, we <lb/>

          <p>After an exordium, (ver. 1—25,) in which Lucretius speaks of his subject, and <lb/>
            his mode of recommending it, he proceeds to treat of the images of Epi­ <lb/>
            curus, by which the senses are excited, ver. 26—45. He shows that images, <lb/>
            of exquisite subtlety, are emitted from the surfaces of objects, which are <lb/>
            for the most part unseen, but which are observed when reflected from a <lb/>
            mirror, or any smooth surface, ver. 46—108. Besides these images de­ <lb/>
            tached from bodies, there are others spontaneously generated in the air, <lb/>
            ver. 109—216. He demonstrates that vision is produced by the impact of <lb/>
            images on the eyes, ver. 217—239. He then solves various questions re­ <lb/>
            lating to images in mirrors, and to light and shade, ver. 240—379. He <lb/>
            shows that the senses may be trusted, though some would question their <lb/>
            evidence; and that false opinions arise from false reasoning about the <lb/>
            testimony of the senses, ver. 380—469. Pursues the subject more fully, <lb/>
            refuting the Academics, ver. 470—523. Proceeding to the other senses, <lb/>
            he asserts that voice and sounds are of a corporeal substance, and dis­ <lb/>
            courses on the nature and formation of the voice, ver. 524—565. Speaks of <lb/>
            the diffusion, reverberation, and penetration of sounds, ver. 566—617. <lb/>
            Treats of taste and odour, and their diversities, ver. 618—724. Shows <lb/>
            that imagination and thought are produced by means of images, which <lb/>
            penetrate the body through the senses, ver. 725—759. Explains the na­ <lb/>
            ture of dreams, and why a man thinks of that on which he wishes to <lb/>
            think, ver. 760—808. Shows how we are often deceived by images, ver. <lb/>
            809—823. Proceeds to prove that the organs of the body were produced <lb/>
            before the use of them was discovered; that they were not designed for <lb/>
            use, but that it was found out, after they were formed, that they could be <lb/>
            used, ver. 824—878. That motion in animals arose from the motions of <lb/>
            images, ver. 879—908. He then speaks more fully of sleep and dreams, <lb/>
            of which he suggests various causes, ver. 908—1035. Of love, desire, and <lb/>

          <p>I RANGE over the trackless regions1 of the Muses, trodden <lb/>
            before by the foot of no poet. It delights me to approach the <lb/>
            untasted fountains, and to drink; and it transports me to <lb/>
            pluck the fresh flowers, and to obtain a distinguished chaplet <lb/>
            for my head from those groves whence the Muses have hitherto <lb/>
            veiled the temples of no one. In the first place, because I <lb/>
            give instruction concerning mighty things, and proceed to free <lb/>
            the mind from the closely-confining shackles of religion; in <lb/>
            the next place, because I compose such lucid verses concern­ <lb/>
            ing so obscure a subject, affecting every thing with the grace <lb/>
            of poetry. Since such ornament, also, seems not unjustifiable <lb/>
            or without reason. But as physicians, when they attempt to <lb/>
            give bitter wormwood to children, first tinge the rim round <lb/>
            the cup with the sweet and yellow liquid of honey, that the <lb/>
            age of childhood, as yet unsuspicious, may find the lips de­ <lb/>
            luded, and may in the mean time drink of the bitter juice of <lb/>
            the wormwood, and, though deceived, may not be injured, but <lb/>
            rather, recruited by such a process, may recover strength : so <lb/>
            now I, since this argument seems, in general, too severe and <lb/>
            forbidding to those by whom it has not been handled, and <lb/>
            since the multitude shrink back from it, was desirous to set <lb/>
            forth my chain-of-reasoning to thee, 0 Memmius, in sweetly- <lb/>
            speaking Pierian verse, and, as it were, to tinge it with the <lb/>
            honey of the Muses; if perchance, by such a method, I might <lb/>
            detain thy attention upon my strains, until thou gainest a <lb/>

            simulacra, the images of things, which the Epicureans supposed to <lb/>
            be perpetually flying off from the surfaces of bodies.. If these <lb/>

            true representations of the objects from which they came; if they <lb/>
            were broken, or inverted, or mixed one with another, we then saw <lb/>
            monsters, such as Centaurs or Chimaeras. See ver. 736, seq. of this </note> <pb n="147"/>

            distinguished they fly spontaneously1 through space, actuated <lb/>
            by motion from all eternity, and in what manner all things may <lb/>
            severally be produced from them; and since I have shown <lb/>
            what is the nature of the soul, and from what substances it <lb/>
            derives its vigour in-its-connexion with the body, and in <lb/>
            what way, being separated from it, it returns to its original <lb/>
            elements, I shall now begin to treat of another subject, which <lb/>
            is of the greatest concern to these inquiries, namely, that there <lb/>
            exist those shapes which we call IMAGES OF THINGS ; shapes <lb/>
            which, being separated, like membranes, from the surface of <lb/>
            the bodies of objects, flit hither and thither through the air; <lb/>
            and which same shapes, not only occurring to us when awake, <lb/>
            startle our minds, but also alarm us in sleep, when we often <lb/>
            seem to behold strange forms and spectres of the dead, that <lb/>
            frequently, when we are torpid in slumber, rouse us with <lb/>
            horror: I say that these are images thrown off the bodies oj <lb/>
            objects, that we may not, by any possibility, suppose that souls <lb/>
            escape from Acheron, or that shades of the dead hover about <lb/>
            among the living, or that any portion of us can be left after <lb/>
            death, when, after the body, and substance of the soul, have <lb/>
            been disunited, they have suffered dissolution into their re­ <lb/>
            spective elements.</p>
          <p>I affirm, then, that thin shapes and figures of objects are <lb/>
            detached from those objects; from the surface, I mean, of <lb/>
            their bodies; shapes which are to be designated, as it were, <lb/>
            their pellicle or bark, because each image bears the likeness <lb/>
            and form of that object, whatsoever it be, from whose surface <lb/>
            it is detached and seems to wander2 through the air. <note type="footnote"> book. As to the spectres of the dead, Epicurus and Lucretius <lb/>
            supposed them to be pellicles thrown off from corpses, which were <lb/>
            so thin as to pass through coffins and all other obstructions, and <lb/>
            which, though we might not notice them amidst business and bustle, <lb/>
            we became liable to perceive in solitude and retirement. It was <lb/>
            such a spectre that Brutus saw before the battle of Pharsalia. <lb/>
            Dreams were produced, they thought, by means of these subtle <lb/>

            with the soul through the surface of the body. See ver. 728, seq. <lb/>

          <p>This fact any one, with however dull an intellect, may un­ <lb/>
            derstand from what follows. In the first place, since many <lb/>
            bodies, among objects manifest before our eyes, send off, when <lb/>
            disunited, various particles from their substance, partly diffused <lb/>
            and subtle, as wood discharges smoke and fire heat, and partly <lb/>
            more close and condensed, as whenever grasshoppers in sum­ <lb/>
            mer lay aside their thin coats, and when calves, at their birth, <lb/>
            cast the membrane from the surface of their bodies, and, like­ <lb/>
            wise, when the slippery snake puts off his garment among the <lb/>
            thorns, (for we frequently see the briers gifted with their <lb/>
            spoils): since these things, I say, take place, a thin image may <lb/>
            naturally be detached 2 from bodies; that is to say, from the <lb/>
            extreme surface of bodies. For why those substances which <lb/>
            are more dense, should more readily fall away and recede from <lb/>
            bodies, than these shapes which are light and subtle, it is <lb/>
            quite impossible to tell; especially when there are number­ <lb/>
            less minute particles on the surface of objects, which may be <lb/>
            thrown off in the order in which they have lain, and keep the <lb/>
            outline of their figure; and this so much the more easily, as, <lb/>
            being comparatively few, and placed on the outmost super­ <lb/>
            ficies, they are less liable to be obstructed.</p>
          <p>For, assuredly, we not only see many particles discharge <lb/>
            themselves, and become detached, as we said before, from the <lb/>
            middle and inward parts of bodies,3 but we observe also colour <lb/>
            itself frequently fly off from their surfaces; and this effect <lb/>
            yellow, red, and purple curtains4 publicly exhibit, when, <lb/>
            stretched across the vast theatres, displayed over the poles and <lb/>

            actually passed off in thin pellicles from the curtains.—“ May na­ <lb/>

            vary them with their own colour; and the more the walls of <lb/>
            the theatre are shut in around, so much the more all these <lb/>
            objects within, suffused with the hue of the curtains, (the light <lb/>
            of day being affected with it,) smile and look goy. When the <lb/>
            curtains, therefore, send off colour from their surface, all other <lb/>
            objects may naturally send off subtle images; for it is from <lb/>
            the superficies that both emit. There are therefore, we must <lb/>
            believe, certain outlines of figures, which, formed of a subtle <lb/>
            texture, fly abroad, and which nevertheless cannot, at the time <lb/>
            that they are separated from bodies, be individually discerned <lb/>
            by the eye.</p>
          <p>Besides, if all odour, smoke, vapour, and other similar sub­ <lb/>
            stances, fly off from bodies in a scattered manner, it is because, <lb/>
            while rising from within, they are, as they issue forth, broken <lb/>
            by winding passages; nor are there any direct openings of <lb/>
            the orifices, by which they strive, as they spring up, to fly <lb/>
            out.1 But, on the other hand, when a thin coat of colour <lb/>
            from the surface is thrown off, there is nothing that can scat­ <lb/>
            ter it, since, being placed on the very superficies, it lies in <lb/>
            readiness to fall off unbroken.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whatever images appear to us in mirrors, in the <lb/>
            water, and in any bright object, their substance, since they <lb/>
            are distinguished by a form similar to their objects, must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily consist2 in forms thrown off from those objects. For <lb/>
            why those grosser consistences, as smoke and vapour, which <lb/>
            many bodies obviously send forth from their substance, should <lb/>
            more readily detach themselves, and recede from objects, than <lb/>
            those which are thin and subtle, there is no possibility of tell­ <lb/>
            ing. There are, therefore, we may believe, thin images of <lb/>
            the forms of bodies, and unlike those of a grosser nature, which, <lb/>
            though no one can see them severally thrown off, yet, being <lb/>
            thrown off, and repelled by successive and frequent reflec­ <lb/>

          <p>Give me now your attention further, and learn of how <lb/>
            subtle a nature or substance an image consists. You may <lb/>
            imagine this subtlety, in the first place, inasmuch as the pri­ <lb/>
            mordial-atoms of things are so far below our senses, and so ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly less than those smallest objects which our eyes first <lb/>
            begin to be unable to distinguish.. But that I may make <lb/>
            plain to you how exquisitely diminutive the primary-particles <lb/>
            of all bodies are, listen to what I shall state in these few ob­ <lb/>
            servations.</p>
          <p>First, there are some animals so exceedingly minute, that <lb/>
            the third part of them can by no possibility be seen.2 Of <lb/>
            what size can any internal part of these creatures be imagined <lb/>
            to be ? What is the globule of their heart, or of their eye ? <lb/>
            What are their members and joints ? How extremely dimi­ <lb/>
            nutive must they be! What, moreover, is the size of the <lb/>
            several atoms of which their vital-principle, and the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of their soul, must necessarily consist ? Do you not <lb/>
            conceive how subtle and minute they must be ?</p>
          <p>Contemplate, besides, whatever bodies exhale from their <lb/>
            substance a powerful odour, as panacea, bitter wormwood, <lb/>
            strong-smelling southern wood, and pungent centaury, any one <lb/>
            of which if you shall happen to shake gently, and imagine <lb/>
            how small must be the atoms that affect your nostrils, you may <note type="footnote"> in the opinion of Epicurus, one, but many ; produced by a quick <lb/>
            succession of images passing off from the body, and striking against <lb/>

            process making the many appear as one." Lambinus. This will be <lb/>
            seen more clearly as the reader proceeds. Epicurus's doctrine of <lb/>
            images is one of the weakest points in his philosophy. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Our eyes first begin to be unable to distinguish.] Ver. 112. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 126—148."/> <lb/>
            then the better understand that numerous images of bodies, <lb/>
            composed of still smaller atoms, may flit about in various ways, <lb/>
            without force or weight, and without impression on the senses.1 <lb/>
            [Of which bodies how fine a part the image is, there is no <lb/>
            one can express, or give the due estimation of it in words.]</p>
          <p>But lest perchance you should think, that those images of <lb/>
            objects alone wander abroad, which fly off from the objects <lb/>
            themselves, there are others, also, which are produced spon­ <lb/>
            taneously, and are combined of themselves in this sky which <lb/>
            is called the air; those images, namely, which, fashioned in <lb/>
            various shapes, are borne along on high, and, being soft in <lb/>
            their contexture, never cease to change their figure, and to <lb/>
            metamorphose themselves into the outlines of forms of every <lb/>
            sort. This we sometimes see the clouds do, when we observe <lb/>
            them thicken on high, and dim the serene face of the firma­ <lb/>
            ment, yet soothing the air, as it were, with their motion ;2 as, <lb/>
            frequently, the faces of giants seem to fly over the heaven, <lb/>
            and to spread their shadows far and wide; sometimes huge <lb/>
            mountains, and rocks apparently torn from those mountains, <lb/>
            seem now to go before the sun, now to follow close behind <lb/>
            him; then some monster seems to drag forward, and to ob­ <lb/>
            trude, other stormy clouds.</p>
          <p>Understand, now, with how easy and expeditious a process <lb/>
            these images are formed, and perpetually flow off, and pass <lb/>
            away from objects. For there is always on the surface of <lb/>
            bodies something redundant, which they may throw off; and <lb/>
            this redundancy, or outside form, when it comes in contact <lb/>
            with certain objects, as, for example, a thin garment,3 passes <note type="footnote"> 1 Without force — and without impression on the senses.] Ver. <lb/>

            through it; but, when it strikes against rough rocks, or the <lb/>
            substance of wood, is at once broken into fragments, so that <lb/>
            it can present no image. But when objects which are bright <lb/>
            and dense have stood in its way, as, above all, a looking-glass, <lb/>
            neither of these effects happens; for neither can images pass <lb/>
            through it like a garment, nor be divided into parts before the <lb/>
            smooth surface has succeeded in securing its entireness.1 From <lb/>
            this cause it happens that images abound among us; and, <lb/>
            however suddenly, at any time whatsoever, you may place a <lb/>
            mirror opposite an object, the image of it appears; so that you <lb/>
            may conclude that filmy textures of objects, and subtle shapes, <lb/>
            are perpetually flying off from the superficies of every body. <lb/>
            Many images are therefore carried off in a short space, so that <lb/>
            the production of these forms must naturally be thought rapid.2 <lb/>
            And as the sun must send forth many rays in a short time, <lb/>
            that all places may be constantly full of light, so, by a like <lb/>
            process, many different images of bodies must necessarily be <lb/>
            carried off from those bodies in a moment of time in all direc­ <lb/>
            tions round about; since, whatsoever way we turn the mirror <lb/>
            to the figures of objects, the objects are represented in it of a <lb/>
            correspondent form and colour.</p>
          <p>Besides, at times when the state of the sky has just before <lb/>
            been clear as possible, it becomes, with extreme suddenness, so <lb/>
            frightfully overclouded on all sides, that you might think that <lb/>
            all the darkness had left Acheron, and filled the immense vault <lb/>
            of heaven ; so formidably, when such a gloomy night of clouds <lb/>
            has arisen, does the face of black terror hang over the earth <lb/>
            from above. Of which clouds, thin as they are, how thin a <lb/>
            portion their image must be, as viewed in a reflecting surface, <lb/>
            there is no man that can express, or give in words such an <lb/>
            estimation as would be conceivable.</p>
          <p>And now attend further, and with how swift a motion <lb/>
            images are borne along, and what activity is given to them as <lb/>
            they swim across the air, so that, to whatever part they move, <lb/>
            each with its several tendency, a short time only is spent in a <note type="footnote"> 1 Has succeeded in securing its entireness.] Ver. 154. Meminit <lb/>

            long distance, I will proceed to explain, though rather, if pos­ <lb/>
            sible, in agreeably-sounding verses than in many; 1 as the short <lb/>
            melody of the swan is better than the croak of cranes swept­ <lb/>
            afar among the ethereal clouds driven by the south-wind.</p>
          <p>In the first place, we have constant means of observing <lb/>
            how swift in their motion those bodies which are light, and <lb/>
            which consist of minute particles, are. Of which kind is the <lb/>
            sun's light, and his heat; for this reason, that they are com­ <lb/>
            posed of minute primary-atoms, which are, as it were, struck <lb/>
            out, and make no difficulty to pass through the interval of <lb/>
            air, driven on by a succeeding stroke; for the place of light <lb/>
            passing on is instantly supplied by other light, and brightness <lb/>
            is, as it were, propelled by successive brightness.2 Wherefore <lb/>
            images must, in like manner, be able to pass through an inex­ <lb/>
            pressible space in a moment of time; in the first place, because <lb/>
            there is always some slight impulse3 at a distance behind them, <lb/>
            which may carry them forward and urge them on; and se­ <lb/>
            condly, because they are sent forth formed with so subtle a <lb/>
            texture, that they can easily penetrate any substances what­ <lb/>
            soever, and, as it were, flow through the intervening-body <lb/>
            of air.</p>
          <p>Besides, if those atoms of bodies which are sent forth from <lb/>
            within,4 and from the central portion of them, as the light and <lb/>
            heat of the sun, are seen, gliding over the whole space of the <note type="footnote"> 1 In agreeably-sounding verses than in many.] Ver. 181. Suavi. <lb/>

            what shall we say of those particles, then, which lie ready on <lb/>
            the outmost surface of bodies ? Do you not conceive how much <lb/>
            quicker and farther they ought to go, when they are once <lb/>
            thrown off, and when nothing delays their progress ? And do <lb/>
            you not feel certain that they should fly over a much greater <lb/>
            distance of space in the same time in which the light of the <lb/>
            sun traverses the heaven ?</p>
          <p>This also seems to be an eminently fitting example to show <lb/>
            with how swift a motion the images of things are borne along, <lb/>
            namely, that as soon as a bright-surface of water is placed <lb/>
            in the open air, when the clear heaven is shining with stars, <lb/>
            the radiant constellations of the sky immediately correspond <lb/>
            in the water. Do you now understand, then, in what a <lb/>
            moment of time this image descends from the regions of the <lb/>
            air to the regions of the earth ? From which cause, however <lb/>
            wonderful,1 you must necessarily admit, again and again, the <lb/>
            existence of bodies which strike the eyes and excite our vision, <lb/>
            and flow with a perpetual issue from certain substances; as <lb/>
            cold from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the waves of <lb/>
            the sea, which is the consumer of walls round the shore; nor <lb/>
            do various voices cease to fly through the air ;2 moreover the <lb/>
            moisture, so to speak, of a salt taste, comes often into the <lb/>
            mouth, when we are walking near the sea; and, again, when <lb/>
            we look at diluted wormwood being mixed, a bitterness af­ <lb/>
            fects our palate. So evidently a certain substance is borne <lb/>

            ground ; nor is there any delay or interruption allowed to <lb/>
            the efflux; since we perpetually perceive it with our senses, <lb/>
            and may see all objects at all times, and smell them, and hear <lb/>
            them sound.</p>
          <p>Further, since any figure felt with the hands in the dark is <lb/>
            known to be the same which is seen by day and in clear light, <lb/>
            it necessarily follows that touch and sight are excited by a <lb/>
            like cause. If, therefore, we handle a square object, and that <lb/>
            object affects us as a square in the dark, what object, in the <lb/>
            light, will be able to answer to the shape of it, except its <lb/>
            quadrangular image ? For which reason the faculty of dis­ <lb/>
            cerning forms is found to depend upon images, and it seems <lb/>
            that no object can be distinguished by the eye without them.</p>
          <p>Now those images of objects, of which I am speaking, are <lb/>
            carried in every direction, and are thrown off so as to be dis­ <lb/>
            tributed on all sides; but, because we can see only with our <lb/>
            eyes, it therefore-happens, that whatsoever way we turn our <lb/>
            sight, all objects on that quarter strike on it with their shape <lb/>
            and colour. And the image causes us to see, and gives-us­ <lb/>
            means to distinguish, how far each object is distant from us. <lb/>
            For when it is sent forth from the object, it immediately strikes <lb/>
            and drives forward that portion of air, which is situated be­ <lb/>
            tween itself and our eyes; and the whole of that air thus <lb/>
            glides through our eyes,1 and, as it were, brushes the pupils <lb/>
            gently, and so passes on. Hence it comes to pass that we see <lb/>
            how far distant each object is ; and the more air is driven before <lb/>
            the image, and the longer the stream of it that brushes through <lb/>
            our eyes, the farther each object seems to be removed from us. <lb/>
            These effects, you may be sure, are produced with an ex- <note type="footnote"> 1 The whole of that air thus glides through our eyes. J Ver. 249. <lb/>

            Wakefield's note, who, finding a difficulty, proposed to read sub in­ <lb/>
            stead of per. This notion about the stream of air making known the <lb/>
            distance, is repeated in ver. 280, seg. </note> <pb n="156"/>

            quisitely rapid process, so that we see what the object is, and, <lb/>
            at the same time, how far it is distant.</p>
          <p>In these matters it is by no means to be accounted wonderful, <lb/>
            why, when those images which strike the eyes cannot be <lb/>
            severally discerned, the objects themselves, from which they <lb/>
            proceed, are perceived. For, in like manner, when the wind <lb/>
            strikes upon us by degrees, and when sharp cold spreads over <lb/>
            us, we are not wont to perceive each first and successive par­ <lb/>
            ticle of that wind and cold, but rather the whole together; <lb/>
            and we then perceive, as it were, blows inflicted upon our <lb/>
            body, as if some substance were striking us, and producing in <lb/>
            our frame a sense of its force which is without us. Besides, <lb/>
            when we strike a stone with our finger, we touch the very ex­ <lb/>
            treme superficies of the stone, and the outside colour; and yet. <lb/>
            we do not feel that colour with our touch, but rather perceive <lb/>
            the hardness of the stone deeply seated within its substance.</p>
          <p>And now learn in addition to this, why. the image of an <lb/>
            object in a mirror is seen beyond the mirror; for certainly it <lb/>
            seems extremely remote from us. The case is the same as <lb/>
            with those objects which are plainly seen out of doors, when a <lb/>
            door, standing open, affords an unobstructed prospect through <lb/>
            it, and allows many objects out of the house to be contem­ <lb/>
            plated. For this view, also, as well as that in the mirror, <lb/>
            takes place, if I may so express it, with a double and twofold <lb/>
            tide of air. For first is perceived the air on this side of the <lb/>
            door-posts; then follow the door-posts themselves on the <lb/>
            right hand and on the left; next the external light strikes <lb/>
            the eyes, and the second portion of air, and all those objects <lb/>
            which are clearly seen abroad. So, when the image from the <lb/>
            glass has first thrown itself forward, and whilst it is coming <lb/>
            to .our sight, it strikes and drives forward the air which is <lb/>
            situate between itself and the eyes, and causes us to per­ <lb/>
            ceive all this air before we see the mirror; but when we <lb/>
            have looked on the mirror itself,1 the image which is thrown <note type="footnote"> I But when we have looked on the mirror itself, &amp;c.] Ver. 284. <lb/>

            Thus stands the passage in Wakefield and Forbiger. Wakefield <lb/>
            would join insensimus, and this is perhaps the best thing that can be <lb/>
            done. As for the eum in the next line, he makes it agree with aëra. </note> <pb n="157"/>

            off from us, reaches it, and, being reflected, returns to oui <lb/>
            eyes, and so, propelling another portion of air before it, rolls <lb/>
            it on, and causes us to perceive this air before we see itself; <lb/>
            and on that account seems to be distant, and to be so much <lb/>
            removed from or behind the mirror. For which reason, again <lb/>
            and again I say, it is by no means right for those who study <lb/>
            these matters, to wonder at the effects which attribute vision <lb/>
            from the surface of mirrors to the influence of two portions of <lb/>
            air; since the appearance is produced by means of both.</p>
          <p>Now that which is in reality the right side of our bodies, is <lb/>
            made to appear on the left side in mirrors, for this reason, <lb/>
            that when the image, which proceeds from our person, strikes <lb/>
            upon the plane of the mirror, it is not reflected without a <lb/>
            change, but, being turned back, it is so struck out of its former <lb/>
            state, as would be the case with a mask of plaster, if, before it <lb/>
            were dry, any one should dash its face against a pillar or a <lb/>
            beam; when, if it should preserve, at that instant, its true <lb/>
            figure as in front, or as when its front was presented to you, <lb/>
            and should exhibit itself, or its exact features, driven back <lb/>
            through the hinder part of the head, it will happen that the <lb/>
            eye which before was the right, is now become the left, and <lb/>
            that which was on the left, correspondently, is made the <lb/>
            right.</p>
          <p>It is contrived, also, that an image may be transmitted from <lb/>
            mirror to mirror; so that five, and even six images, have been <lb/>
            often produced. For whatsoever object in a house shall be <lb/>
            hid, as lying back in the interior part of it, it will yet be pos­ <lb/>
            sible that every such object, however removed out of sight by <lb/>
            crooked turnings and recesses, may, (being drawn out, by <note type="footnote"> First comes to us the imago speculi, propelling a certain portion of <lb/>

            seen to be in the building. So exactly is an image reflected <lb/>
            from glass to glass ; and, when it has been presented to us on­ <lb/>
            the-left-hand, it happens afterwards that it is produced on-the­ <lb/>
            right; and thence it returns again, and changes to the same <lb/>
            position as before.</p>
          <p>Moreover, whatever small sides or plates there are of glasses, <lb/>
            formed with a round flexure similar to that of our own side, <lb/>
            they, on that account, reflect to us images in the right posi­ <lb/>
            tion;1 either because the image is transferred from glass to <lb/>
            glass, and thence, being twice reflected, flies forward to us ; <lb/>
            or, again, because the image, when it comes forth, is turned <lb/>
            about, inasmuch as the curved shape of the glass causes it to <lb/>
            wheel itself round to us.</p>
          <p>Further, you would suppose that our images in a mirror <lb/>
            advance together with us, and place their foot with ours, and <lb/>
            imitate our gesture; which appearance happens from this cause, <lb/>
            that from whatever part of the mirror you recede, the images, <lb/>
            after that moment, cannot be reflected from that part, since <lb/>
            nature obliges all images to be reflected from mirrors, (as well <lb/>
            as to fly off from objects,) according to the corresponding ges­ <lb/>
            tures of the person whom they represent.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 They, on that account, reflect to us images in the right position.] <lb/>

            ed, or in what position we must conceive them placed, is very far <lb/>
            from clear. I was inclined at one time to think that the columnar­ <lb/>
            concave mirror was meant, so that de speculo in speculum, ver. 315, <lb/>
            might signify from side to side of the glass ; and there is nothing in <lb/>
            the text to contradict this supposition, unless it be said that de spe­ <lb/>

            allowed to doubt. Lambinus, however, explains it, teres speculifigura <lb/>
            instar columnæ, evidently thinking the shape convex. Other com­ <lb/>
            mentators say nothing to the purpose. The notion of concavity <lb/>
            seems rather to be favoured by ver. 318. Flexa figura docet speculi <lb/>

            ing. The sun even blinds you, if you persist to direct your <lb/>
            eyes against it; inasmuch as the power of it is great; and <lb/>
            images from it are borne down impetuously from on high <lb/>
            through the clear air, and strike the eyes forcibly, disturbing <lb/>
            and causing pain in their sockets.1 Moreover, whatever splen­ <lb/>
            dour is strong, often burns the eyes, because it contains many <lb/>
            seeds of fire, which produce pain in the organs-of-sight by <lb/>
            penetrating into them.</p>
          <p>Besides, whatever objects jaundiced persons2 look upon, be­ <lb/>
            come in their sight yellow like themselves; because many <lb/>
            atoms of yellow colour flow off from their bodies, meeting and <lb/>
            tinging the images of objects; and many of the same atoms <lb/>
            are moreover mixed in their eyes, which, by their contagion, <lb/>
            paint all things with lurid hues.</p>
          <p>But when we are in the dark, we see, from the darkness, <lb/>
            objects that are in the light, because when the black air of the <lb/>
            darkness, being nearer to us, has entered the open eyes first, <lb/>
            and taken possession of them, the bright white air immediately <lb/>
            follows, which, as it were, clears them, and dispels the black <lb/>
            shades of the other air; for this lucid air is by many degrees <lb/>
            more active, and far more subtle and powerful: which, as soon <lb/>
            as it has filled with light, and laid open, the passages of the <lb/>
            eyes, which the dark air had previously stopped, plain images <lb/>
            of objects immediately follow and strike upon the eyes, so that <lb/>
            we see those objects which are situated in the light. This, on <lb/>
            the other hand, we cannot do, when we look from the light to­ <lb/>
            wards objects in the dark, because the thicker air of darkness <lb/>
            follows behind the light air; which thicker air fills the pores, <lb/>
            and stops up the passages of sight, so that the images of any <lb/>
            things whatsoever, being involved in it, cannot be moved <lb/>

            way off, it happens, on account of the distance, that they often <lb/>
            scem round, because every angle, being afar off, is seen as ob­ <lb/>
            tuse, or rather is not seen at all; the impulse of its image dies <lb/>
            away, and the force of it does not reach to our eyes ; since, <lb/>
            while the images of it are borne through a large body of air, <lb/>
            the air, by frequent percussions upon them, obliges that force <lb/>
            to become-ineffective. Hence it comes to pass, that when every <lb/>
            angle has escaped our vision at the same time, the constructed <lb/>
            stones are seen as if fashioned to a round;1 not, however, like <lb/>
            round objects which are immediately before us, and which are <lb/>
            exactly circular, but they appear, as it were, nearly, after a <lb/>
            shadowy fashion, resembling them.</p>
          <p>Our shadow likewise seems to us to move in the sun, and to <lb/>
            follow our footsteps, and to imitate our gesture; (if you can <lb/>

            excluded from the radiance, wherever we, as we go, obstruct <lb/>
            it; and that part of it, which we have left, is again covered <lb/>
            with light. From this cause it happens, that what was the <lb/>
            shadow of our body, seems to be still the same, and to have <lb/>
            followed exactly-opposite us. For fresh illuminations of rays <lb/>

          <p>A ship, in which we sail, is carried forward, when it seems <lb/>
            to stand still; and that which remains stationary, is imagined <lb/>
            to go by us; and the hills and plains, past which we row our <lb/>
            vessel, or fly with sails, seem to flee away astern.</p>
          <p>All the stars seem to be at rest, as being fixed to the vaults <lb/>
            of the sky; and yet all are in perpetual motion; for when, <lb/>
            after rising, they have traversed the heaven with their shining <lb/>
            orbs, they return to their distant places-of-setting. And the <lb/>
            sun and the moon, in like manner, seem to remain stationary; <lb/>
            bodies which observation itself shows to be carried forwards.</p>
          <p>And mountains rising up, at a distance, from the middle <lb/>
            of the sea, between which a free passage for ships is open, <lb/>
            yet appear without separation, so that one vast island seems to <lb/>
            be formed from the two united.</p>
          <p>It likewise happens that to children, after ceasing to whirl <lb/>
            themselves about, the rooms seem to turn, and the pillars to <lb/>
            run round, so that they can hardly believe that the whole <lb/>
            building is not threatening to fall upon them.</p>
          <p>And when nature begins to raise on high the beams of the <lb/>
            sun, red with tremulous fires, and to exalt them above the <lb/>
            hills, the hills over which the sun then appears to be, himself <lb/>
            apparently touching them close, (glowing with his own beams,) <lb/>
            are scarcely distant from us two thousand flights of an arrow, <lb/>
            often even scarcely five hundred casts of a dart; yet between <lb/>
            them and the sun, which seems in contact with them, lie broad <lb/>
            expanses of sea, stretched out under vast regions of sky; and <lb/>
            many thousand miles of land also intervene, which various <lb/>
            nations of men, and tribes of wild beasts, occupy and overrun. <lb/>
            And, to mention another ocular delusion, a puddle of water, <lb/>
            not deeper than a finger, which settles among the stones in <lb/>
            the paved streets, affords, apparently, a prospect downwards <lb/>
            under the earth, to a depth as great1 as the height to which <lb/>
            the lofty arch of heaven extends above the earth; so that you <lb/>
            seem to look down upon the clouds and to see a heaven be- <note type="footnote"> I To a depth as great.] Ver. 417. Impete tanto. " Id est tantâ at­ <lb/>

          <p>Moreover, when a spirited courser sticks fast with us in the <lb/>
            middle of a river, and we look down into the swiftly-flowing <lb/>
            water of the stream, a force seems to be carrying the body of <lb/>
            the horse, though standing still, in a contrary direction to the <lb/>
            current, and to drive it rapidly up the river; and, whitherso­ <lb/>
            ever we turn our eyes, all objects appear to us to be carried <lb/>
            along, and to flow, in a similar manner.</p>

            whole length, contracts gradually, as it were, to the apex of a <lb/>
            tapering cone, joining the roof to the floor, and all the right­ <lb/>
            hand parts to the left, until it has narrowed-itself to the in­ <lb/>
            distinct point of the cone.</p>
          <p>To sailors at sea it occurs that the sun, having risen from <lb/>
            the waves, seems also to set, and bury its light, in the waves; <lb/>
            as, in their situation, they behold nothing else but water and <lb/>
            sky; a remark which I make, that you may not lightly sup­ <lb/>
            pose that the senses are altogether deceived.</p>
          <p>But to those ignorant of the sea,2 ships in the harbour often <lb/>
            appear to strive, disabled in their equipments, against the <lb/>
            broken waves; for though whatever part of the oars is raised <lb/>
            above the water of the sea, is straight, and the part of the helm <lb/>
            above the water is straight, the parts which go down, and are <lb/>
            sunk in the water, seem all, as if broken, to be turned and in­ <lb/>
            verted, sloping upwards, and, thus bent back, to float almost <lb/>
            up to the surface of the water.</p>
          <p>And when the winds, in the night time, carry light vapours <lb/>
            athwart the sky, the bright constellations seem then to glide <lb/>
            against the clouds, and to pass along on high in a far different <lb/>
            direction than that in which they are really borne.3 <note type="footnote"> I Altogether deceived.] Ver. 436. Labefactari undique. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 But to those ignorant of the sea, &amp;c.] Ver. 437. <lb/>

          <p>But if by chance the hand, applied to one eye, presses it <lb/>
            underneath, it happens, by some impression on the sense, tha <lb/>
            all things, at which we look, seem to become double as we <lb/>
            gaze on them; two lights in the lamps appear blossoming with <lb/>
            flames; the twin furnit ure seems to be doubled throughout the <lb/>
            house; and the faces of the people seem double, and their <lb/>
            persons double.</p>
          <p>Moreover, when sleep has bound our limbs in agreeable re­ <lb/>
            pose, and the whole body lies in profound rest; yet, at that <lb/>
            very time, our limbs appear to be awake and to move them­ <lb/>
            selves, and we imagine that, in the thick darkness of night, <lb/>
            we see the sun, and the light of day; and, though in a con­ <lb/>
            fined place, we seem to change our position with respect to the <lb/>
            heaven, the sea, rivers, and mountains, and to cross over plains <lb/>
            on foot, and to hear sounds, though the unbroken silence of <lb/>
            night reigns around us, and to utter words, though our tongues <lb/>
            remain still.</p>
          <p>Other things of this class, exciting our wonder, we see in <lb/>
            great numbers; all which seek, as it were, to destroy the <lb/>
            credit of our senses: but they strive in vain ; since the greatest <lb/>
            part of these appearances deceive us only because of the <lb/>
            fancies which we allow to bear upon them; so that those <lb/>
            things which have not been seen by our senses, are to us as if <lb/>
            seen. For nothing is more difficult than to separate certain <lb/>
            from doubtful things; things which the mind, when their <lb/>
            fallaciousness is discovered, straightway rejects from itself.1</p>

            this, I should still put to him the following question: when <lb/>
            he has seen no truth in things previously, how he knows what <lb/>
            it is to know and not to know, in contradistinction to one <lb/>
            another ? What cause, I shall ask him, produced his know­ <lb/>
            ledge of truth and falsehood, and what power has proved to <lb/>
            Aim that what is doubtful differs from what is certain ?</p>
          <p>The knowledge of truth, you will find, is derived from the <lb/>
            senses as-its-origin,1 and you will own that the senses cannot be <lb/>
            refuted. For that which, of its own power,2 can refute false <lb/>
            notions by real facts, must be found of greater credit than to <lb/>
            be liable to confutation. What, then, must be esteemed of <lb/>
            greater credit than the senses ? Shall reasoning, arising from <lb/>
            erring sense,3—reasoning, I say, which has arisen wholly from <lb/>
            the senses, and which can depend on nothing else,—be of suffi­ <lb/>
            cient force to refute those senses? For unless these, our <lb/>
            tenses, are true and trust-worthy, all reasoning consequently <lb/>
            becomes false and unfounded ? But what, that is external to <lb/>
            the senses, shall confute the senses, or will they disagree among <lb/>
            themselves, and refute one another? Will the ears be able to <lb/>

            nostrils confute the other senses, or will the eyes contradict <lb/>
            them? It is, as I think, not so; for to each sense is separately <lb/>
            assigned its own faculty; each has its own power; and it is <lb/>
            therefore necessary that what is soft, and what is cold, and <lb/>
            what is hot, should seem so; and it is necessary, also, that we <lb/>
            should perceive distinctly the various colours of things, and <lb/>
            whatever things are connected with colours. The taste of the <lb/>
            mouth, likewise, has its own power separately; scents are pro­ <lb/>
            duced independently, and sounds independently of the other <lb/>
            senses; and it necessarily follows, therefore, that some senses <lb/>
            cannot confute others. Nor again, will they, as a body, con­ <lb/>
            fute themselves; for equal trust must at all times be placed <lb/>
            in every one of them. That, therefore, which, at any time <lb/>
            whatsoever, has seemed true to them, is true.</p>
          <p>And if reasoning shall be unable to unfold the cause why <lb/>
            those objects which, when close at hand, were square, have <lb/>
            appeared round at a distance, yet it is better for a man, being <lb/>
            partially deficient in reasoning, to give explanations of each <lb/>
            figure erroneously, than by any means to let slip1 from his <lb/>
            bands things that are manifest, and to destroy the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of belief, and tear up all the foundations on which life <lb/>
            and safety rest. For not only would all reasoning fall to the <lb/>
            ground, but life itself would at once come-to-nothing, unless <lb/>
            you venture to trust your senses, and to avoid precipices,2 and <lb/>
            other things of this sort which are to be shunned, and to pur­ <lb/>
            sue those things which are of a contrary character. That, <lb/>
            therefore, is all an empty body of words, you may be sure,3 <lb/>
            which is arrayed and drawn up against the senses.</p>
          <p>Lastly, as, in a building, if the rule is wrongly applied at <lb/>

            proper position, and if the level is in the least inexact in any <lb/>

            seem inclined to fall, and some actually do fall, being all made <lb/>
            unsound by false measures at the commencement. Thus, ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, whatever reasoning on things has sprung from fal. <lb/>
            lacious senses, must of necessity be erroneous and deceitful. <lb/>
            If the senses be false, all arguments from them must be false.</p>
          <p>We have already spoken of sight; and now no difficult <lb/>
            argument is left for us, to show how the other senses discern <lb/>
            each its own object.</p>
          <p>In the first place, every sound and voice is heard, when, <lb/>
            being infused into the ears, they have struck with their sub­ <lb/>
            stance on the sense. For we must admit that voice and sound <lb/>
            are corporeal, since they can make impression on the senses. <lb/>
            On this account the voice often abrades the throat, and its <lb/>
            loud sound, as it passes forth, makes the wind-pipe rougher. <lb/>
            For when the atoms of the voice (a larger body of them than <lb/>
            usual having risen together) have proceeded to go forth from <lb/>
            the mouth, the passage of the mouth, from the pores being <lb/>
            filled up, is rendered hoarse, and the voice injures the road <lb/>
            by which it issues into the air. It is by no means to be doubted, <lb/>
            therefore, that voices and words consist of corporeal particles, <lb/>
            as having power to cause corporeal injury.</p>
          <p>Nor does it escape your knowledge, also, how much sub­ <lb/>
            stance perpetual speaking, protracted from the rising splen­ <lb/>
            dour of Aurora to the shade of black night, detracts from the <lb/>
            body, and how much it wears away from the very nerves and <lb/>
            strength of men, especially if it is uttered with extreme loud­ <lb/>
            ness. The voice, therefore, must necessarily be corporeal, <lb/>
            since he who speaks much, loses, from its effect, a portion of <lb/>
            his corporeal-substance.</p>
          <p>Nor do the particles of sound penetrate the ear under a <lb/>
            like form, when the crooked barbarian trumpet bellows hea­ <lb/>
            vily with a deep murmur, and calls up a hoarse dead-sound; <lb/>
            and when swans, in the pangs of death, raise, with a mourn­ <lb/>
            ful voice, a liquid dirge from the vales of Helicon.</p>
          <p>These words and sounds, therefore, (when, being formed <lb/>
            within, we expel them from our body, and send then forth <lb/>
            straight by the mouth,) the active tongue, skilful-in-forming <lb/>
            words, articulates ; and the shape into which the lips are <lb/>
            put, partly assists to fashion them. But asperity of the voice <lb/>
            is caused by asperity of its particles, and its smoothness is also <lb/>
            produced by their smoothness.</p><pb n="167"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 555 -583."/>
          <p>For this reason, when the distance is not great to the spot <lb/>
            whence each word, having started forth, arrives at our ears, <lb/>
            it happens, of necessity, that the words themselves are also <lb/>
            plainly heard, and distinguished in-every-note; for the voice <lb/>
            keeps its formation, and maintains its figure. But if a greater <lb/>
            space than is convenient is interposed, the words, passing <lb/>
            through a large body of air, are necessarily confused, and the <lb/>
            voice, while it flies through the aerial-interval, is disordered. <lb/>
            It accordingly happens that you hear a sound, but cannot <lb/>
            distinguish what is the meaning of the words;1 so confused <lb/>
            and obstructed does the voice come to you.</p>
          <p>Besides, one word, uttered from the mouth of a crier in the <lb/>
            midst of the people, often penetrates the ears of all. One <lb/>
            voice, therefore, suddenly divides into many voices, since it <lb/>
            distributes itself to each individual ear, stamping on it, as it <lb/>
            were, the form and clear sound of the words. But that part <lb/>

            those which we utter, when we seek our companions wandering <lb/>
            among the shady hills, and call them, as they are scattered <lb/>
            abroad, with a loud voice. I have noticed places repeat six <lb/>

            whose noise, and sportive play, re-echoing through the night, <lb/>
            they universally affirm that the dead silence is broken, and <lb/>
            that sounds of chords and sweet plaintive-notes are heard, <lb/>
            which the pipe, struck with the fingers of those playing, pours <lb/>
            forth around. They relate, also, that the race of husbandmen <lb/>
            hear far and wide, when, frequently, Pan, shaking the piny <lb/>
            garland of his half-savage head, runs over the open reeds with <lb/>
            his curved lip, ceasing not to repeat1 his sylvan song. Other <lb/>
            wonders and prodigies of this kind they relate, lest, perhaps, <lb/>
            they should be thought to dwell in lonely places, deserted even <lb/>
            by the gods; for this reason they talk of such marvels in their <lb/>
            discourse, or, perchance, are prompted by some other cause, <lb/>
            as all men are too eager for ears that will listen to wonderful <lb/>
            stories.2</p>
          <p>Furthermore, it is not surprising, how, through places <lb/>
            where the eyes cannot discern plain objects, through these <lb/>
            very places voices pass, and excite the ears. We often, too, wit­ <lb/>
            ness a dialogue held between two persons in different apart­ <lb/>
            ments, with the doors closed. The cause is evidently this, that <lb/>
            the voice can pass unbroken through winding pores of bodies, <lb/>
            though images refuse to pass through them; for the latter are <lb/>
            broken to pieces, unless they go through straight passages, <lb/>
            such as those of glass, through which every image flies.</p>
          <p>Besides, the voice is distributed in all directions, inasmuch <lb/>
            as some voices are produced from others; for this happens <lb/>
            where one voice has split itself into many, as a spark of fire, <lb/>
            when it has started forth, is often wont to disperse itself into <lb/>
            its own separate fires. Places, accordingly, which have been <lb/>
            all shut up behind and around the speaker, are filled with <lb/>
            voices, and shaken with sound. But as for images, they all, when <lb/>
            once they have been thrown off, pass only by straight open­ <lb/>
            ings, for which reason no one can see objects beyond walls, <lb/>
            though he may hear voices from beyond them. And yet this <lb/>
            very voice, also, while it goes through the obstructed passages, <lb/>
            is dulled, and we seem to hear a sound rather than distinct words.</p>

            the tongue and the palate, requires for itaelf somewhat more <lb/>
            argument and more explanation.</p>
          <p>In the first place, we perceive savour in the mouth, when <lb/>
            we express it from food by mastication; as when any one, for <lb/>
            example, proceeds to press and dry with his hand a sponge full <lb/>
            of water. What we express, is then distributed through all the <lb/>
            ducts of the palate, and the tortuous pores of the soft tongue.1 <lb/>
            By this means, when the atoms of the juice flowing out are <lb/>
            smooth, they touch the sense agreeably, and affect all parts, <lb/>
            around the humid exuding regions of the tongue, with plea­ <lb/>
            sure. But, on the other hand, as atoms are severally more <lb/>
            endowed with roughness, so much the more, issuing forth in <lb/>
            a body,2 they sting and lacerate the sense.</p>
          <p>Moreover, pleasure experienced from the taste of food is <lb/>
            limited by the extent of the palate; as, when the juice has <lb/>
            descended downwards through the throat, there is no enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment while it is all being distributed through the members; <lb/>
            nor is it of any consequence with what food the body is <lb/>
            nourished, so that you be but able to disperse what you take, <lb/>
            when digested, through the organs, and preserve the humec­ <lb/>
            tant3 tenor and action of the stomach.</p>
          <p>I will now explain, (in order that we may understand this <lb/>
            point,) how it is that different food is allotted to different ani­ <lb/>
            mals, or why that which is sour and bitter to some, may yet <lb/>
            seem to others extremely sweet. And so great is the differ­ <lb/>
            ence and variety in these matters, that that which to some is <lb/>
            food, to others is rank poison. Thus it happens that a ser­ <lb/>
            pent, which is touched with human saliva,4 perishes, and even <note type="footnote"> lingua atque palatum, Plusculum habent in se rationis, &amp;c. The hoc is <lb/>

            commits suicide by biting himself. Besides, hellebore is <lb/>
            strong poison to us, but increases the fat of goats and quails.</p>
          <p>That you may understand by what means this happens, it <lb/>
            becomes you in the first place to call to mind what we have <lb/>
            often said before, that in bodies are contained many seminal- <lb/>
            atoms, mingled in many ways. Moreover, as all living crea­ <lb/>
            tures, which take food, are dissimilar externally, and as the <lb/>
            extreme outline of their limbs restricts them variously accord­ <lb/>
            ing to their kinds, so they likewise consist of different seminal- <lb/>
            particles, and vary in the figure of their elements. Further, <lb/>
            when the seminal-particles differ, their intervals and passages, <lb/>
            which we call pores, in all the limbs, and in the mouth, and <lb/>
            the palate itself, must likewise differ. Some of these pores, <lb/>
            therefore, must be greater, and some less; some animals must <lb/>
            have triangular pores, some square; many pores must be round, <lb/>
            and some polygonal, varied in several ways. For as the na­ <lb/>
            ture of the shapes of the semnal-particles, and their motions, <lb/>
            require, the figures of the pores must differ accordingly, and <lb/>
            the intervals among the atoms must vary just as the combina­ <lb/>
            tion of the atoms demands. On this account, when that which <lb/>
            is sweet to some animals is bitter to others, exquisitely-smooth <lb/>
            atoms must enter gently and easily into the pores of the palate <lb/>
            of that animal to whom it is sweet; but, on the contrary, <lb/>
            rough and jagged particles, as is evident, pierce the mouths <lb/>
            of those animals to whom the same substance is bitter.</p>
          <p>From these facts it is now easy to understand every parti­ <lb/>
            cular connected with this subject. For when in any person <lb/>
            fever has arisen from the superabundance of the bile, or any <lb/>
            violence of disease has been excited by any other means, his <lb/>
            whole body is at once disturbed, and all the positions of the <lb/>
            atoms in him are changed; it happens that particles which <lb/>
            before suited his sense of taste, are now unsuitable to it, and <lb/>
            others, which, when they have penetrated the pores, produce <lb/>
            a bitte sensation, are more adapted to it. For even in sweet <lb/>
            bodies, as in the flavour and substance of honey, both rough <lb/>
            and smooth particles are mixed; a fact which we have de­ <lb/>
            monstrated to you frequently before.1</p>
          <p>And now give me your attention further; for I shall show <lb/>
            in what manner the approach of odour affects the nostrils. <note type="footnote"> I Demonstrated to you frequently before.] Ver. 674. See i. 815, <lb/>
            894; ii. 685. </note> <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 677—705."/> <lb/>
            First, there must necessarily exist many substances, from <lb/>
            which a varied effluence of odours streams forth and evolves <lb/>
            itself; for that odours do both flow off, and are sent forth <lb/>
            and dispersed abroad, we must naturally suppose. But certain <lb/>
            odours, on account of the different shapes of their particles, are <lb/>
            more suited to some animals than to others: and thus bees <lb/>
            are attracted by the smell of honey in the air, however far <lb/>
            distant, and vultures by the smell of carcasses; also the keen- <lb/>
            scent of dogs, preceding their steps, leads them1 whithersoever <lb/>
            the cloven hoof of the stag has directed its course; and the <lb/>
            white goose, the preserver of the citadel of the Romans, per­ <lb/>
            ceives from afar the smell of a man. Thus different scent <lb/>
            assigned to different animals, leads each to its own food, and <lb/>
            causes it to recoil from destructive poison ; and by this means <lb/>
            the tribes of beasts are preserved.</p>
          <p>Of this very odour, then, which excites the nostrils, it hap­ <lb/>
            pens that one kind is carried farther than another; but yet <lb/>
            none of them is carried so far as sound, or as the voice;—I <lb/>
            forbear to say as those airy substances which strike the <lb/>
            eyes, and excite vision. For odour, wandering about, passes <lb/>
            but slowly, and, being dispersed through the yielding air, <lb/>
            soon gradually dies away; 2 chiefly because it is with difficulty <lb/>
            evolved out of any substance from its interior. For that <lb/>
            odours flow and come forth from the interior of substances, <lb/>
            this consideration sufficiently indicates, that all bodies when <lb/>
            broken, bruised, or split into fragments in the fire, seem to <lb/>
            cast a stronger scent than when whole. It is, besides, easy to <lb/>
            see that odour is composed of larger atoms than sound ; since <lb/>
            it does not penetrate through stone walls, through which the <lb/>
            voice and sounds constantly pass. For which reason you will <lb/>
            see that it is not so easy to ascertain in what quarter a body <lb/>
            that casts a scent is placed, as to find out one that emits a sound. <lb/>
            For the force and impulse of an odour, by moving slowly <lb/>
            through the air, soon becomes chill and powerless; nor do the <note type="footnote"> 1 The keen-scent of dogs, preceding their steps, leads them.] Ver. <lb/>

            sa." Vis I take in the sense of faculty, keen-scent. In Virgil's odora <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 706—740"/> <lb/>
            atoms, the heralds of substances, come warm to the sense. <lb/>
            From this cause dogs are often at fault, and have to seek for <lb/>
            traces of the scent.</p>
          <p>Nor does this occur, indeed, in respect to odours only, and <lb/>
            in the case of tastes; but the appearances and colours of <lb/>
            things, likewise, do not so agree with the senses of all men <lb/>
            alike, but that some are more acrid and repulsive to the sight <lb/>
            than others. Even fierce lions cannot endure to stand against, <lb/>
            and to look upon, a cock, which, as his flapping wings startle <lb/>
            the night,1 is accustomed to call Aurora with his loud voice ; <lb/>
            lions, I say, will not endure him, so suddenly do they bethink <lb/>
            them of flight; the cause evidently being, that there are in the <lb/>
            bodies of cocks certain particles, which, when sent forth into <lb/>
            the eyes of lions, pierce the pupils, and cause sharp pain, so <lb/>
            that the beasts, however fierce, cannot hold out against them, <lb/>
            although these same particles cannot at all hurt our eyes; <lb/>
            either because they do not penetrate, or because, if they do <lb/>
            penetrate, a free outlet from the eye is permitted to them, so <lb/>
            that they cannot in any respect hurt the organs of sight by <lb/>
            remaining in them.</p>
          <p>And now give me your attention, and learn what substances <lb/>
            affect the mind; and understand, in a few words, whence those <lb/>
            things which come into the mind proceed.</p>
          <p>In the first place, I assert this, that numbers of subtle <lb/>
            images of things wander about in many ways in all directions; <lb/>
            images which, when they meet, are easily united together in the <lb/>
            air, as the spider's web, and a leaf of gold. For these images <lb/>
            are far finer in their texture than those which affect the eyes <lb/>
            and excite vision; since these penetrate through the small <lb/>
            pores of the body, and excite the subtle substance of the mind <lb/>
            within, and arouse the sense.</p>
          <p>Thus it is that we see Centaurs, and the members of Scyllæ, <lb/>
            and the Cerberean mouths of dogs, and the apparitions of <lb/>
            those whose bones, after death has been passed, the earth con­ <lb/>
            tains. Since spectra of all kinds are every where carried <lb/>
            about, which are partly such as are formed spontaneously in <lb/>
            the air, partly, whatever fly off from various objects; and <lb/>
            partly, those which images, formed of figures of these two kinds, <note type="footnote"> 1 As his flapping wings startle the night. ] Ver. 712. Noctem ex. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 741—763."/> <lb/>
            compose.1 Foi assuredly the image of a Centaur is not formed <lb/>
            from a living Centaur, since there has been no such figure in <lb/>
            life; but when the images of a horse and a man have come <lb/>
            together by chance, they easily and quickly cohere, (as we <lb/>
            said before,) because of their subtle nature and filmy texture.</p>
          <p>Other images of this sort are produced in the same manner; <lb/>
            and since these, from their extreme lightness, are, as I have <lb/>
            shown above, swiftly carried about, any one thin image of <lb/>
            them all easily stimulates our mind with a single impression; <lb/>
            for the mind is itself subtle and eminently excitable.</p>
          <p>That these things take place, as I state, you may easily <lb/>
            learn from hence; that inasmuch as this impression on the <lb/>
            mind2 is similar to that on the bodily senses, it necessarily <lb/>
            follows that that which we see with the mind, and that which <lb/>
            we see with the eye, are effected by similar means. As I have <lb/>
            shown, accordingly, that I perceive lions, for example,3 by <lb/>
            means of images of lions, which excite the eyes ; we may un­ <lb/>
            derstand that the mind is moved by images of lions in like <lb/>
            manner, and by other images of other things,4 which it sees <lb/>
            and discerns equally and not less than the eyes ; only we must <lb/>
            observe that it sees more subtle images.</p>
          <p>Nor for any other reason does this sense of the mind be­ <lb/>
            come awake when sleep has spread itself over the limbs, <lb/>
            than because these same images excite our minds, which affect <lb/>
            our senses when we are corporeally awake; to such a degree <lb/>
            that we seem plainly to behold him, of whom, his life having <note type="footnote"> I Partly, those which images, formed of figures of these two kinds, <lb/>

            been yielded up, death and the earth have already taken pos­ <lb/>
            session. This Nature of necessity brings to pass; and from <lb/>
            this cause, that all the senses of the body, being obstructed <lb/>
            and bound up by sleep, are at rest throughout the several mem­ <lb/>
            bers, and are unable to refute any false appearance by real <lb/>
            facts. Besides, the memory lies inactive and torpid in sleep ; <lb/>
            and shows no disbelief in appearances, or intimates that he, <lb/>
            whom the mind imagines that it sees alive, has long ago par­ <lb/>
            taken of death and forgetfulness.</p>
          <p>As to what remains for consideration, it is not surprising <lb/>
            that images should move, and agitate their arms, and other <lb/>
            members, with regularity; for it happens that many an image <lb/>
            seems to do this in our sleep. This is to be explained in the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing way; that when the first image passes off, and a second <lb/>
            is afterwards produced in another position, the former then <lb/>
            seems to have changed its gesture. This, doubtless, we must <lb/>
            conceive to be done by a very rapid process; so great is the <lb/>
            -activity of images, and so great the number of things from <lb/>
            which they proceed; and so great too is the abundance of <lb/>
            atoms, that it may suffice for that which is to be perceived by <lb/>
            the senses, at any time whatsoever. And many other ques­ <lb/>
            tions are raised on these matters, and many points must be <lb/>
            made clear by us, if we wish to explain these subjects dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly.</p>
          <p>In the first place, it is inquired why the mind immediately <lb/>
            thinks of that very thing of which any one has desired to <lb/>
            think.1 Do images watch our pleasure, and, as soon as we <lb/>
            wish, does an image present itself to us ? If it is our desire <lb/>
            to think of the sea, of the earth, or of the heaven, of assem­ <lb/>
            blies of men, of a procession, of banquets, of battles, does <lb/>
            nature create and prepare images of all these things at our <lb/>
            word ? Especially when the minds of different men in the <lb/>
            same country and place, think of things entirely different ?</p>
          <p>What shall we say, moreover, when we perceive images in <lb/>
            our sleep advance before us in order, and move their pliant <lb/>
            limbs; when, as we observe them, they wave with ease their <lb/>
            bending arms alternately, and repeat gesture after gesture with <lb/>
            the foot corresponding to the look? Are images, forsooth, <lb/>
            inspired with the art of dancing, and do they, skilled in ges- <note type="footnote"> I Of which any one has desired to think.] Ver. 781. Quod cuique <lb/>

            ticulation, wander about, in order that they may make sport for <lb/>
            us in the night time ? Or will this rather be the truth, that <lb/>
            we perceive that variety of motions in one and the same por­ <lb/>
            tion of time; as in that time in which one word is uttered,1 <lb/>
            many smaller portions of time, (which reason discovers to be <lb/>
            in it,) are contained? From this cause it happens, that <lb/>
            at any time whatsoever, any images are ready at hand, pre­ <lb/>
            pared for all places; so great is their activity, and so great <lb/>
            the abundance of objects from which they proceed. By this <lb/>
            means, when the first image passes away, and a second is <lb/>
            afterwards produced in another position, the first then seems <lb/>
            to have changed its gesture.</p>
          <p>And because images are subtle, the mind cannot acutely <lb/>
            discern any but those which it earnestly endeavours to discern; <lb/>
            all, therefore, which exist besides these, pass away unnoticed, <lb/>
            unless the mind has thus prepared itself and endeavoured to <lb/>
            distinguish them. The mind, accordingly, does prepare itself <lb/>
            and expects that that will occur which is consequent2 on that <lb/>
            which has preceded; so that it observes each particular oc­ <lb/>
            currence. Thus, therefore, the effect is produced.</p>
          <p>Do you not see, also, that the eyes, when they have begun <lb/>
            to look at things which are small, exert and prepare them­ <lb/>
            selves; and that we could not, without this exertion, clearly <lb/>
            di scern them ? And even in respect, also, to objects easily dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishable, you may observe, that if you do not apply your <lb/>
            mind to remark any one of them, it is just the same as if it <note type="footnote"> 1 As in that time in which one word is uttered, &amp;c.] Ver. 797. <lb/>

            it therefore surprising, if the mind loses sight of all other <lb/>
            images, except those concerning matters to which it is itself <lb/>
            directed? Besides, we form opinions of great things from <lb/>
            small indications, and thus lead ourselves into the delusion of <lb/>
            deceit.</p>
          <p>It happens, also, that sometimes a second image is not pre­ <lb/>
            sented of the same kind as the first, but that that which was <lb/>
            before a woman under our hands, seems to be before us <lb/>

            take long steps on the road; and, moreover, that the fore-arms <lb/>
            fitted to the stout upper arms, and the hands ministering on <lb/>
            either side, were given us that we might perform those <lb/>
            offices which would be necessary for the support of life.</p>
          <p>Other suppositions of this sort-whatever explanations men <lb/>
            give-are all preposterous, reasoning being thus perverted. <lb/>
            For nothing was produced in the body to the end that we <lb/>
            might use it; but that which has been produced, being found <lb/>
            serviceable for certain ends, begets use. Neither was the fa­ <lb/>
            culty of seeing in existence before the light of the eyes was <lb/>
            made, nor that of speaking with words before the tongue was <lb/>
            formed; but rather the origin of the tongue long preceded <lb/>
            speech, and the ears were made long before any sound was <lb/>
            heard; and, in fine, all members, as I think, existed before <lb/>
            there was any use of them discovered. They could not, there­ <lb/>
            fore, have been produced for the sake of being used.</p>
          <p>But, on the contrary, to engage in battle with the hand, and <lb/>
            to tear the limbs, and to pollute the body with gore, was prac­ <lb/>
            tised long before bright darts were hurled; and nature com­ <lb/>
            pelled us to avoid a wound, before the left hand, by the help <lb/>
            of art, presented the defence of a shield.</p>
          <p>And, certainly, to commit the wearied body to rest is of <lb/>
            much more antiquity than the soft cushions of the couch; and <lb/>
            to quench the thirst was practised before cups were invented.</p>
          <p>Such things as these, then, which were found out from expe­ <lb/>
            rience and the objects of life, may be believed to have been in­ <lb/>
            vented for the purpose of using them; those things, however, <lb/>
            which were all first produced independently, gave a knowledge <lb/>
            of their utility afterwards. Of which kind, especially, we see <lb/>
            that the senses and members of the body are. Wherefore again <lb/>
            and again 1 say, it is impossible for you to believe1 that they <lb/>
            could have been produced for the sake of use.</p>
          <p>This, also, is not to be wondered at, that the very nature <lb/>
            of the body of every animal requires food. For I have shown <lb/>
            that many atoms pass off and recede from substances in many <lb/>
            ways; but the most numerous must pass off from animals ; <lb/>
            because they are exercised by motion, and many particles are <lb/>
            carried forth, urged from the interior of the body, by perspir­ <lb/>
            ation ; many, also, are exhaled through the mouth, when they <note type="footnote"> I It is impossible for you to believe.] Ver. 857. Procul est ut <lb/>
            credere possis. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 866—895."/> <lb/>
            pant from weariness. By these means, therefore, the body <lb/>
            wastes, and all its nature is undermined; a state on which <lb/>
            pain is attendant. On this account food is taken, that it may <lb/>
            support the limbs, and, being given at intervals, may recruit <lb/>
            the strength, and repress the eager desire of eating through­ <lb/>
            out the organs and veins.</p>
          <p>Liquid also descends into all parts of the body, whatsoever <lb/>
            require liquid; and the moisture, coming into the frame, dis­ <lb/>
            sipates the many collected atoms of heat, which cause a burn­ <lb/>
            ing in our stomach, and extinguishes them like fire, so that <lb/>
            arid heat may no longer dry up Cur limbs. Thus, therefore, <lb/>
            you see, panting thirst is expelled from our bodies; thus the <lb/>
            pining desire offfood is satisfied.</p>
          <p>I will now state how it comes to pass that we can advance <lb/>
            our steps when we please, and how it is given us to move <lb/>
            our limbs out–of–the–direct–line;1 and what cause is wont to <lb/>
            push forward this great weight of our body. Do thou, my <lb/>
            friend, attentively-receive my instructions.</p>
          <p>I affirm, then, that IMAGES OF GOING first approach to the <lb/>
            mind, and impinge on the mind, as we observed before re­ <lb/>
            specting images in general. Thence arises will, for no man <lb/>
            begins to do any thing, before his mind has discerned <lb/>
            what it will do. And according to what it discerns, is <lb/>
            the image of his action.2 When, therefore, the mind so stirs <lb/>
            itself, that it desires to proceed and move forward, it immedi­ <lb/>
            ately acts on the substance of the soul, which is distributed in <lb/>
            the whole body, and through the limbs and joints; and this <lb/>
            is easily done, since the substance of the soul is held united <lb/>
            with the mind. That substance of the soul forthwith acts upon <lb/>
            the body; and thus, by degrees, the whole mass of the man <lb/>
            is protruded and moved forwards.</p>
          <p>The body at that time, moreover, opens its pores, and the <lb/>
            air, which is always easily excited to motion, enters, as it na­ <lb/>
            turally must indeed, through the open spaces, and penetrates <note type="footnote"> 1 Out–of–the–direct–line.] Ver. 879. Varè. Wakefield's reading <lb/>

            reads At quod, &amp;c., and interprets the passage thus: “ That which the <lb/>

            to do." </note> <pb n="179"/>

            the passages abundantly, and is thus dispersed through every <lb/>
            minute portion of the body; thus, therefore, the body, by <lb/>
            two several powers,1 is made to move along as a ship with <lb/>
            sails and wind.</p>
          <p>Nor yet is it wonderful, in these matters, that atoms so <lb/>
            small can wield so great a body, and turn about all our weight. <lb/>
            For the wind, though but light and of thin substance, drives <lb/>
            forward a large ship with vast power; and one hand rules <lb/>
            the vessel, with whatever speed it may be going; while one <lb/>
            helm turns it in any direction. And a machine, by the help <lb/>
            of wheels and pulleys, lifts many bodies of great weight, and <lb/>
            raises them on high with but a slight force.</p>
          <p>And now I shall explain by what means sleep spreads rest <lb/>
            through our limbs, and dispels the cares of the mind from our <lb/>
            breast; but I shall do this rather in agreeably-sounding than <lb/>
            in numerous verses, as the short melody of the swan2 is better <lb/>
            than the croak of cranes, dispersed among the clouds of hea­ <lb/>
            ven, driven by the south wind. Do you only, 0 Memmius, <lb/>
            devote to me your attentive ears and discerning mind, that <lb/>
            you may not deny what I say to be possible, and depart from <lb/>
            me with a breast repelling true precepts, when you yourself <lb/>
            are in fault, and yet cannot perceive that such is the case.</p>
          <p>In the first place, sleep occurs when the substance of the <lb/>
            soul has been disturbed throughout the several members, and <lb/>
            has partly seceded from the body, (as being driven forth <lb/>
            abroad,) and has partly, as being more concentrated, retreated <lb/>
            into the interior of the body; for then, at length, when the <lb/>
            frame is in this state, the limbs are relaxed and lose their power. <lb/>
            Since there is no doubt but that this our vital sense exists in us <lb/>
            by means of the soul, which sense when sleep hinders from be­ <lb/>
            ing exerted, we must then suppose that our soul is disturbed, <lb/>
            and expelled from the body; but not wholly, for if it were all <lb/>
            withdrawn, the body would lie steeped in the eternal cold of <lb/>
            death, as, in that case, no part of the soul would remain latent <lb/>
            in the members, (concealed as fire lies hidden under thick <lb/>
            ashes,) whence the sense might be suddenly rekindled through­ <lb/>
            out the limbs, and flame, as it were, rise from secret heat.</p>
          <p>But by what means this change from wakefulness to sleep <note type="footnote"> 1 By two several powers.] Ver. 897. Rebus utrinque duabus. Vis. <lb/>

            is produced, and how the soul may be disturbed, and the body <lb/>
            languish, I will explain. Do you, my friend, take care that <lb/>
            I may not pour out my words to the winds.</p>
          <p>In the first place, it necessarily happens that the body <lb/>
            since it is touched by the breezes of the air to which it is ex­ <lb/>
            posed, must be externally assailed and harassed by the frequent <lb/>
            impulse of that air; and, for this reason, almost all animated <lb/>
            bodies are covered with hide, or even with shells, or with hard <lb/>
            skin, or bark. This same air, likewise, impinges on the in­ <lb/>
            terior part of the body of animals, when, as they breathe, it <lb/>
            is drawn in and respired. For which reason, when the body <lb/>
            is affected from both causes,1 and when assaults penetrate <lb/>
            through the small pores of our frame to its primary parts and <lb/>
            first elements, a labefactation, as it were, takes place by de­ <lb/>
            grees throughout our members; for the positions of the ele­ <lb/>
            ments of the body and mind are disturbed, so that part of the <lb/>
            soul is drawn forth from them, and part retires hidden into <lb/>
            the interior; part also, dispersed throughout the limbs, cannot <lb/>
            remain united together, nor perform its ordinary motions mu­ <lb/>
            tually with other parts; for nature obstructs the communica­ <lb/>
            tions and passages, and therefore, the motions of the atoms being <lb/>
            changed, sense wholly fails.2 And since there remains nothing <lb/>
            that can, as it were, prop up the limbs, the body becomes weak, <lb/>
            and all its members languish; the arms and the eye-lids fall, <lb/>
            and the hams often subside with a sinking lassitude,3 and relax <lb/>
            their strength.</p>
          <p>Sleep, too, follows upon taking food, because food, while it <lb/>
            is being distributed through all the veins, produces the same <lb/>
            effects which the air produces ; and that sleep is far the most <lb/>
            heavy which you take when full or weary; because most of <lb/>
            the atoms of the frame are then disturbed, being shaken with <lb/>
            much effort. By the same means, a deeper concussion in the <lb/>
            substance of the soul takes place, as well as a larger ejection <lb/>
            of it without, and it becomes more divided in itself and dis­ <lb/>
            tracted within. <note type="footnote"> 1 Affected from both causes.] Ver. 940. Utrinque seem—vapulet. <lb/>

          <p>And in general, as 3ach of us, having pursued any study, <lb/>
            is devoted to it in his thoughts, or in whatever occupation we <lb/>
            have been much engaged previously,-and the mind has been <lb/>
            more exerted in that pursuit,—we seem, for the most part, to <lb/>
            go through the same employments in sleep. Lawyers seem <lb/>
            to plead causes and to make laws; generals to fight and en­ <lb/>
            gage in battles; sailors to wage settled war with the winds: <lb/>
            and myself to pursue this work, and investigate perpetually the <lb/>
            nature of things, and to explain it, when discovered, in the <lb/>
            language of my country.</p>
          <p>Thus other studies and arts seem generally, in sleep, to <lb/>
            occupy the minds of men with delusions. And whatsoever per­ <lb/>
            sons have given continual attention to games and spectacles <lb/>
            for many days in succession, we generally see that, in those <lb/>
            persons, when they have ceased to observe those objects with <lb/>
            their bodily senses, there are yet passages remaining open in <lb/>
            the mind, where the same images of the same objects may <lb/>
            enter. For very many days, therefore, those same images <lb/>
            are presented before their eyes, so that they seem, even when <lb/>
            awake, to see figures dancing, and moving their pliant limbs, <lb/>
            and to listen with their ears to the liquid music and speaking <lb/>
            chords of the lyre; and, likewise, to perceive the same assem­ <lb/>
            bly, and to contemplate, at the same time, the various decora­ <lb/>
            tions of the scene shining before them. Of so great influence <lb/>
            is study and inclination, and so much difference does it make <lb/>
            in what pursuits, not only men, but indeed all animals, have <lb/>
            been accustomed to be engaged. For you will see stout horses, <lb/>
            when their limbs shall be stretched in sleep, yet perpetually <lb/>
            perspiring and panting, and apparently exerting their utmost <lb/>
            strength for the palm of victory, or often starting in their sleep <lb/>
            as if the barriers were just set open.</p>
          <p>And the dogs of huntsmen, when stretched in gentle repose, <lb/>
            often throw out their legs on a sudden, and hurriedly utter <lb/>
            cries, and frequently draw in the air with their nostrils, as if <lb/>
            they were pursuing the newly-discovered traces of wild-beasts; <lb/>
            and oftentimes, after they are awakened, they follow in ima­ <lb/>
            gination the empty images of stags, as if they saw them turned <lb/>
            to flight, until, their delusions being dispelled, they return to <lb/>
            their senses. And the fawning breed of dogs that are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to the house, begin at times to rouse themselves and <lb/>
            start up from the ground, just as if they saw strange faces <pb n="182"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 1002—1028"/> <lb/>
            and looks. And the more fierce any breeds are, the more must <lb/>
            the same breeds show fierceness in their sleep.</p>
          <p>But various birds, likewise, take flight, and suddenly disturb <lb/>
            with their wings the groves of the gods during the night, if, <lb/>
            in their quiet sleep, hawks have appeared, pursuing and flying <lb/>
            after them, to offer battle and threaten hostilities.</p>
          <p>Moreover the minds of men, whatever great things they <lb/>
            effect with vast efforts in the day, frequently perform and <lb/>
            carry on the same things also during their sleep. Kings <lb/>
            storm cities,1 we taken prisoners, join battle, raise a cry as if <lb/>
            they were being stabbed on the spot. Many struggle-desper­ <lb/>
            ately, and utter groans as if in pain, and fill all parts around <lb/>
            with loud shrieks, as if they were torn by the bite of a panther <lb/>
            or savage lion. Many in sleep speak of important matters; <lb/>
            and men have very often made in dreams a revelation of <lb/>
            their own guilt. Many, apparently, die; many show terror <lb/>
            through their whole frame, like persons who are casting them­ <lb/>
            selves to the ground from high mountains, and, as if deprived <lb/>
            of their senses, (so disturbed are they by the agitation of their <lb/>
            body,) scarcely, after sleep, recover themselves.</p>
          <p>A thirsty man, also, in his dream, often sits near a river or <lb/>
            pleasant fountain, and almost swallows up the whole stream <lb/>
            with his mouth. Boys, too, bound fast in sleep, fancy that, <lb/>
            being near a tank or broken vessel, they are raising up their <lb/>
            garment, and pour forth the bottled liquid 2 of the whole body, <lb/>
            when the Babylonian coverlets, of magnificent splendour, are <lb/>
            saturated.</p>

            That, as the tender toil were all achieved, <lb/>

          <p>For, as we erst have sung, the seeds of life <lb/>
            First spring when manhood first the frame confirms. <lb/>
            And as on various functions various powers <lb/>
            Alone can act propulsive, human seeds <lb/>
            By nought but human beauty can be rous'd. <lb/>
            These, when once gender'd from their cells minute <lb/>
            O'er every limb, o'er every organ spread, <lb/>

            Excite they oft, as forms of beauty rise, <lb/>

            is entitled,” he adds, to the joint thanks of naturalists and ana­ <lb/>
            tomical philosophers for irradiating their dark and thorny paths <lb/>
            with the light and fire of the Muses. * * * Lucretius is a lecturer <lb/>
            upon natural philosophy; he admits us to his theatre, and gravely <lb/>
            and scientifically developes the principles of this important subject. </note><note type="footnote"> * * * A serious and attentive reader of this truly learned, as well <lb/>
            as poetical discourse, whether male or female, cannot possibly, I <lb/>
            think, peruse it without the acquisition of some degree of useful <lb/>
            knowledge; and even the medical professor himself cannot but be <lb/>
            astonished at the copiousness of his research, and the accuracy that <lb/>
            accompanies much of its reasoning." </note><note type="footnote"> " There is here no impurity of language, nothing that may not be <lb/>
            mentioned with propriety. If any thing shall appear objectionable, <lb/>
            such appearance is to be attributed, not to the fault of the poet, but <lb/>
            to that of the reader." Faber. </note><note type="footnote"> " De amore, sterilitate, fœcunditate, et aliis omnibus hanc ma­ <lb/>

            to high and cultivated intellect. The remark applies here with pe­ <lb/>
            culiar force. Lucretius was too much of a man of sense, too much <lb/>
            of a philosopher, too well acquainted with human feelings, not to <lb/>
            know that the higher order of minds are little liable to seduction <lb/>
            from the gross exposures of nature ; and only to such minds is his <lb/>
            poem addressed." </note> <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 1042—1075"/> <lb/>
            Then springs the tender tumour, the warm wish <lb/>
            Full o'er the foe, the luscious wound who deals, <lb/>
            With dexterous aim to pour the high-wrought charge, <lb/>
            And full contending in the genial fight. <lb/>
            So falls the victim on the part assailed: <lb/>
            With the red blood the glistening bruise so swells; <lb/>
            And o'er th' assassin flows the tide he draws.</p>
          <p>So he who feels the shaft of love propell'd <lb/>
            From the dear form that charms him, towards the spot <lb/>
            Aims, whence the wound proceeds; supreme he pants <lb/>
            To join the congest, and from frame to frame <lb/>
            Pour the rich humour; for the fierce desire, <lb/>
            Now felt, assures how vast the bliss to come. <lb/>
            This, this is Venus: this he deems true love; <lb/>
            Hence flow the drops delicious that the heart <lb/>
            Erode hereafter, and its train of cares. <lb/>
            For, though the form adored be absent, still <lb/>
            Her phantoms haunt the lover, and his ear <lb/>
            Rings with her name, whatever the path pursued.</p>
          <p>Yet fly such phantoms, from the food of love <lb/>
            Abstain, libidinous; to worthier themes <lb/>
            Turn, turn thy spirit; let the race at large <lb/>
            Thy liberal heart divide, nor lavish, gross, <lb/>
            O'er one fond object thy exhausted strength, <lb/>
            Gend'ring long cares, and certain grief at last. <lb/>
            For love's deep ulcer fed, grows deeper still, <lb/>
            Rank, and more pois'nous; and each coming day <lb/>
            Augments the madness, if the wretch, perchance, <lb/>
            Heal not old wounds by those of newer date, <lb/>
            From fair to fair wide-wand'ring, or his mind <lb/>
            Turn from such subjects to pursuits unlike.</p>
          <p>Nor are the joys of love from those shut out <lb/>
            Who brutal lust avoid; the pure of heart <lb/>
            Far surer pleasures, and of nobler kind, <lb/>
            Reap, than the wretch of lewd and low desires, <lb/>
            Who, in the moment of enjoyment's self, <lb/>
            Still fluctuates with a thousand fears subdued ; <lb/>
            O'er the fair wanton, dubious, long who hangs, <lb/>
            What charm his eyes, his hands shall first devour: <lb/>
            Till fixt, at length, with furious force the spot <lb/>
            Painful he presses, through his luscious lips <pb n="185"/>

            Striving in vain for joys unmix'd, and urg'd <lb/>
            By latent stimulus the part to wound, <lb/>
            Where'er its seat, that frenzies thus his soul. <lb/>
            But Venus softly smooths the wrongs endur'd, <lb/>
            And mutual pleasures check the lover's rage.</p>
          <p>Then hopes he, too, in the same form to quench <lb/>
            The maddening fires where first the flame arose. <lb/>
            Vain hope, by every fact disproved; for this, <lb/>
            The more the soul possesses, still the more <lb/>
            Craves she with keenest ardour. Foods and drinks <lb/>
            As through the frame they pass, by toil worn out, <lb/>
            Fill many a huge interstice; obvious whence <lb/>
            Dies the dread sense of hunger and of thirst; <lb/>
            But human beauty, and the rosy cheek, <lb/>
            With nought the panting lover can endow <lb/>
            But fruitless hopes, but images unsound, <lb/>
            Scattered by every wind. As, oft, the man, <lb/>
            Parch'd up with thirst, amid his dreams to drink <lb/>
            Strives,1 but in vain, since nought around him flows <lb/>
            But void, unreal semblances of floods; <lb/>
            So with her votaries sports the power of love, <lb/>
            False phantoms sole presenting, nor can sight, <lb/>
            Where'er it rove, be sated with the gaze, <lb/>
            Nor can the lover's lawless fingers tear <lb/>
            Aught from his idol, o'er her as he hangs, <lb/>
            And the full power of every charm explores.</p>

            To sow the fertile field, though then amain <lb/>

            Instant to quit her ; his long-labour'd speech <lb/>
            Of suffering drops, and owns himself a fool, <lb/>
            That for one moment he could deem her crown'd <lb/>

            This know full well the Paphian nymphs, and, deep <lb/>

            But vain th' attempt; for oft the mind will guess <lb/>
            The latent blemish, and the laugh unfold. <lb/>
            Whence those of soul ingenuous frankly own, <lb/>
            Frequent, those faults which none can all escape.</p>
          <p>Yet not for ever do the softer sex <lb/>

            By mutual hopes to run the race of love. <lb/>
            Thus nature prompts; by mutual hopes alone, <lb/>
            By bliss assur'd, birds, beasts, and grazing herds, <lb/>
            The task essay; nor would the female else <pb n="189"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. IV. 1197—1230. "/>E'er bear the burden of the vigorous male, <lb/>
            By mutual joys propell'd. Hast thou not seen, <lb/>
            Hence tempted, how in mutual bonds they strive <lb/>
            Work'd oft to madness ? how the race canine <lb/>
            Stain with their vagrant loves the public streets, <lb/>
            Diversely dragging, and the chain obscene <lb/>
            Tugging to loose, while yet each effort fails ? <lb/>
            Toils they would ne'er essay if unassur'd <lb/>
            Of mutual bliss, and cheated to the yoke. <lb/>
            Whence o'er and o'er the bliss must mutual prove.</p>
          <p>If when the male his genial energy <lb/>
            Imparts, the female deep her breath retract <lb/>
            Transported most, the race produced will, then, <lb/>
            From female store prove female ; if reversed, <lb/>
            From store paternal, male. But when the form <lb/>
            Blends both its parents' features, it ascends <lb/>
            From equal powers of each; the impulse warm <lb/>
            Rousing alike, through each conflicting frame, <lb/>
            The seeds of latent life in scale so nice <lb/>
            That neither conquers, nor to conquest yields.</p>
          <p>Oft view we, too, the living lines portrayed <lb/>
            Of ancestors remote; for various seeds, <lb/>
            Commingled various, through the parent frame <lb/>
            Lurk, which from race to race preserve entire <lb/>
            The form, the features of the anterior stock. <lb/>
            Diversely such the power creative blends; <lb/>
            Whence oft the voice revives, the hair, the hue, <lb/>
            The full complexion of the race deceased; <lb/>
            For these as sure from seeds defin'd ascend <lb/>
            As e'en the face, the body, or the limbs. <lb/>
            Then, too, though male the fetus, female stores <lb/>
            Aid the production; while, if female formed, <lb/>
            The tide paternal mixes in the make; <lb/>
            For both must join, or nought can e'er ensue. <lb/>
            But obvious this, that when the semblance more <lb/>
            Inclines to either, the prevailing sex <lb/>
            Chief lent the seeds of life, and rear'd complete <lb/>
            The virgin embryo, or incipient man.</p>
          <p>Nor ever interfere the gods above <lb/>

            Vainly, at length th' appropriate stores acquire, <lb/>
            And feel the lovely load their wombs enrich. <lb/>
            While he, perchance, whose prior banns forbade <lb/>
            All the fond hope of offspring, happier now <lb/>
            A mate has found of more concordant powers, <lb/>
            And boasts a race to prop his crumbling age.</p>
          <p>So much imports it that the seeds of life <lb/>
            With seeds should mix symphonious, that the gross <lb/>
            Condense the rare, the rare the gross dilute, <lb/>
            And man with woman duly paired unite. <lb/>
            Much, too, concerns it what the foods employed; <lb/>
            For some augment the genial stores, and some <lb/>
            Dissolve their crasis, and all power destroy. <lb/>
            Nor small the moment in what mode is dealt <lb/>

            That the world was not made by the gods for the sake of man, or for their <lb/>

            other arguments, ver. 156—235. As the four elements are changeable <lb/>

            Epicurus Or who has such power over words, that he can <lb/>

            ever be able. For if we ought to speak as the known dignity <lb/>
            of the subjects which he expounded requires, he was a god, a <lb/>
            god, I say, 0 illustrious Memmius, who first discovered that <lb/>
            discipline of life1 which is now called WISDOM; and who, by <lb/>
            the science of philosophy, placed human existence, from amid <lb/>
            so great waves of trouble, and so great darkness of the mind, <lb/>
            in so tranquil a condition and so clear a light.</p>
          <p>For compare with his investigations the ancient discoveries <lb/>
            of others which are called divine; as Ceres is said to have <lb/>
            pointed out corn to mortals, and Bacchus the liquid of wine <lb/>
            produced from the grape; though life, nevertheless, might <lb/>
            have continued without these gifts, as it is reported that some <lb/>
            nations even now live without them; but men could not have <lb/>
            lived well and happily without a pure and undisturbed breast. <lb/>
            For which reason he, from whom the sweet consolations of <lb/>
            existence, now spread abroad through mighty nations, calm <lb/>
            the minds of men, seems to us the more justly to be accounted <lb/>

            been killed, hurt us, if they had not been conquered, and were <lb/>
            now alive ? Not at all, as I am of opinion; for thus, even <lb/>
            now, the earth is abundantly overrun1 with wild beasts, and <lb/>
            filled with alarming terror throughout the groves, and vast <lb/>
            mountains, and deep woods; but these are places which we <lb/>
            for the most part have power to avoid.</p>
          <p>But unless the mind is purified, what contests and dangers <lb/>
            must we incur in spite of our utmost efforts! How many <lb/>
            bitter cares, arising from lust, tear the man distracted by them, <lb/>
            and how many consequent terrors! Or what ills do pride, <lb/>
            uncleanness, wantonness, produce! How great calamities do <lb/>
            they cause! And what evils do luxury and sloth generate!</p>
          <p>Will it not be fit, then, that we should deem this man, who <lb/>
            subdued all these evils, and expelled them from the mind, not <lb/>
            with arms, but with words, worthy to be ranked in the num­ <lb/>
            ber of the gods ? Especially when he was accustomed to give <lb/>
            precepts, both numerous and divinely expressed, concerning <lb/>
            the immortal gods themselves, and to set forth in his instruc­ <lb/>
            tions the whole nature of things.</p>
          <p>This is he on whose track I have entered, whilst I pursue <lb/>

          <p>On this subject, before I begin to utter oracles, (expressed <lb/>

            those of the Pythian priestess, who speaks from the tripod and <lb/>

            learned and philosophic arguments, lest, perchance, being re­ <lb/>
            strained by religion, you should suppose that the earth, the <lb/>
            sun, the heaven, the stars, and the moon, being endowed with <lb/>
            a divine nature, must pursue their courses eternally; and lest <lb/>
            you should conceive, in consequence, that it is just for all <lb/>
            those, (after the manner of the giants,) to suffer punishment <lb/>
            for their monstrous wickedness, who, by their reasoning, <lb/>
            would shake the walls of the world, and seek to quench the <lb/>
            radiant sun in the heavens; animadverting, in mortal speech, <lb/>
            on bodies which are called immortal, but which, in reality, <lb/>
            are so far distant from divine power, and are so unworthy to <lb/>
            appear in the number of gods, that they may rather be thought <lb/>
            adapted to give us a notion of that which is altogether re­ <lb/>
            moved from vital motion and sense.</p>
          <p>For it is not possible that the nature and rationality of in­ <lb/>
            tellect should be thought capable of existing in all kinds of <lb/>
            bodies whatsoever. As a tree cannot exist in the sky,1 nor <lb/>
            clouds in the salt sea; nor can fish live in the fields, nor blood <lb/>
            be in wood, nor liquid in stones; so it is fixed and appointed <lb/>
            where every thing may grow and subsist. Thus the nature <lb/>
            of the mind cannot spring up alone without the body, or exist <lb/>
            apart from the nerves and the blood. Whereas if this could <lb/>
            happen, the faculty of the human soul might rather arise in the <lb/>
            head, or shoulders, or in the bottom of the heels, and might <lb/>
            rather indeed be accustomed to grow in any place, than to <lb/>
            remain in the same man and the same receptacle of the man. <lb/>
            But since it seems certain and fixed even in our own body, in <lb/>
            what part the soul and the mind may subsist and grow up by <lb/>
            themselves, it is so much the rather to be denied that they can <note type="footnote"> I As a tree cannot exist in the sky, &amp;c.] Ver. 129. Sicut in æthers <lb/>

            exist out of the entire body, and without an animal form, <lb/>
            whether in the soft clods of earth, or in the fire of the sun, or <lb/>
            in the water, or in the lofty regions of the air. The heaven­ <lb/>
            ly bodies, therefore, since they cannot be animated with life, <lb/>
            are not endowed with a divine sense.</p>
          <p>It is not possible, moreover, that you should believe there <lb/>
            are sacred seats of the gods in any quarters of our world. <lb/>
            For the nature and substance of the gods, being subtle and far <lb/>
            removed from our senses, is scarcely apprehended by the power <lb/>
            of our mind. And since it has hitherto escaped the touch and <lb/>
            impact of our hands, it can assuredly touch nothing that is <lb/>
            tangible by us ; for nothing can touch another body, if it is not <lb/>
            possible for itself to be touched. For which reason the abodes <lb/>
            of the gods, also, must be dissimilar to our abodes, as being <lb/>
            subtle, and correspondent to their own nature.1 These points <lb/>
            I shall hereafter prove to you with abundance of argument.</p>
          <p>To say, moreover, that the gods designed to arrange all this <lb/>
            noble fabric of the world for the sake of men, and therefore <lb/>
            that we ought to extol it as an honourable achievement of <lb/>
            the deities, and to believe that it will certainly be eternal <lb/>
            and imperishable; and to affirm that it is unlawful ever to <lb/>
            disturb from its seat, by any force of argument, that which <lb/>
            was established for the human race by ancient contrivance and <lb/>
            for perpetual duration, or to shake and displace, though only <lb/>
            in words, the sum of things from their basis ;2 and to feign <lb/>
            and add other conceits of this sort, dear Memmius, is to be <lb/>
            guilty of the utmost folly; for what profit can our gratitude <lb/>
            afford to those who are immortal and blessed in themselves, <lb/>
            that they should labour to effect any thing for our sake ? Or <lb/>
            what new incitement could induce those, who were before <lb/>
            tranquil, to desire, so long afterwards, to change their former <lb/>
            mode of life?3 For it would seem that he only, whom old <note type="footnote"> 1 Subtle, and correspondent to their own nature.] Ver. 155. Tenues, <lb/>

            things offend, ought to delight in things that are new; but in <lb/>
            him to whom no trouble has happened in past time, when he <lb/>
            spent life happily, what could excite the desire of novelty ?1 <lb/>
            Or, forsooth, the life of the gods was oppressed with gloom and <lb/>
            sorrow, until the genial birth of terrestrial things shone forth ? <lb/>
            Or, again, what evil would it have been to us never to have <lb/>
            been born ? For whoever is born must certainly wish to re­ <lb/>
            main in life, as long as any alluring pleasure shall engage <lb/>
            him; but to him who never tasted the love of life, nor was <lb/>
            ever in the number of living beings? what affliction is it not <lb/>
            to have been born ?</p>
          <p>Moreover, whence was a model or idea for making things, <lb/>
            and whence was the notion of men themselves, implanted in <lb/>
            the gods at first, that they should know, and conceive in their <lb/>
            mind, what they should seek to do ? Or by what means was <lb/>
            the power of primary-particles known, and what they could <lb/>
            effect by their change of order and place, if Nature herself did <lb/>
            not give the first specimens of production ?</p>
          <p>For the primordial atoms of things were driven in so many <lb/>
            ways by so many impulses, through an infinite duration of <lb/>
            time, and were accustomed so to be borne and carried forward <lb/>
            by their own weight, and to meet in all modes, and to try all <lb/>
            endeavours, as if to ascertain what their combinations might <lb/>
            generate, that it is not surprising if they fell at last into such <lb/>
            positions, and acquired such motions, as those by which this <lb/>
            universe of things, through perpetual renovation is now car­ <lb/>
            ried on.</p>
          <p>But if I were even ignorant what the primary-elements of <lb/>
            things are, yet this I could venture to assert, from the scheme <lb/>
            of the heaven itself, and to support it from many other rea­ <lb/>
            sons, that the system of things was by no means prepared for <note type="footnote"> produce a world, or worlds, for the sake of making a change in it ? <lb/>
            Was it merely that they might have a new subject on which to <lb/>
            bestow their attention? But what motive, asks Lucretius, could <lb/>
            they have for taking such trouble, when they had previously all that <lb/>

            us by divine power, so great is the faultmess with which it <lb/>
            stands affected.</p>
          <p>In the first place, of all that space which the rapid circum­ <lb/>
            volution of the heaven covers, mountains and woods, the <lb/>
            abodes of wild beasts, have occupied a vast portion ;1 rocks, <lb/>
            and great marshes, and the sea, which widely separates the <lb/>
            coasts of countries, cover another vast portion. Moreover, <lb/>
            burning heat, and the constant descent of frost, deprive mor­ <lb/>
            tals of almost two-thirds of what is left. And as to the land <lb/>
            which yet remains, nature would still, by her own operation, <lb/>
            cover it with thorns, if human strength did not prevent; which, <lb/>
            for the sake of a living, is accustomed to groan under the stout <lb/>
            mattock, and to cut the earth with ploughs urged through it. <lb/>
            For unless we, turning up the fertile clods with the plough­ <lb/>
            share, and forcing the soil, excite it to send forth its pro­ <lb/>
            ductions, they would be unable of themselves to rise into <lb/>
            the liquid air. And yet at times, when all things, procured <lb/>
            with so great labour, are green and flourish over the earth, <lb/>
            either the sun in the heavens burns them up with violent heat, <lb/>
            or sudden showers and cold frosts destroy them, or blasts of <lb/>
            winds, with violent hurricanes, tear them to pieces.</p>
          <p>Besides, why does nature cherish and increase, by land and <lb/>
            by sea, a terrible brood of wild beasts and monsters, hostile to <lb/>

            voice of the nurse1 necessary to be used to one of them. Nor <lb/>
            do they require different dresses according to the season of <lb/>
            the year; nor, besides, have they any need of arms, or high <lb/>
            walls, with which they may defend their property, since the <lb/>
            earth herself, and Nature, the artificer of things, produce all <lb/>
            supplies for all in abundance.</p>
          <p>Above all, since the body of the earth, and the water, and <lb/>
            the light breezes of the winds, and the warm heat, of which <lb/>
            this Sum of Things seems to be constituted, consist wholly of <lb/>
            generated and dissoluble substance, the whole frame of the <lb/>
            world must be considered to be of a similar nature.2 For of <lb/>
            whatever creatures, in mortal shapes, we see the parts and <lb/>
            members to be of a generated consistence, we observe, in <lb/>
            general, these same creatures to be themselves both generated <lb/>
            and mortal. For which-reason, when I see the four elements, <lb/>
            the vast members and divisions of the world, wasted and re­ <lb/>
            produced, I may conclude that there was also a time when the <lb/>
            heaven and earth had a beginning, and that there will be a <lb/>
            time for their destruction.</p>
          <p>On these points, do not imagine, my Memmius, that I have <lb/>
            assumed any thing too hastily, in supposing earth and fire to <lb/>
            be perishable; in not doubting that water and air waste <lb/>
            away; and in saying that the same elements are again pro­ <lb/>
            duced and augmented. In the first place, some part of the <lb/>
            earth, parched with the constant heat of the sun, and tram­ <lb/>
            pled with the perpetual action of feet, exhales mists and fly­ <lb/>
            ing clouds of dust, which strong winds disperse through the <lb/>
            whole air; part also of the clods is washed off by showers,3 <lb/>
            while rivers, as they strike against their banks, wear them <lb/>
            away. Besides, whatever body increases another, is, on its <note type="footnote"> 1 Fond and broken voice of the nurse.] Ver. 231. Blanda atque <lb/>

            which is easier to be understood. A little below, in " both gener­ <lb/>

            own part, diminished; and since the earth, which is the <lb/>
            parent of all things, seems, without doubt, to be the common <lb/>
            sepulchre of all things; the earth, therefore, you may be as­ <lb/>
            sured, is wasted, and is recruited and grows again.</p>
          <p>Further, there is no need of words to show that the sea, <lb/>
            rivers, and fountains abound with new liquid, and that waters <lb/>
            flow incessantly into the ocean; for the vast deflux of streams <lb/>
            from all sides declares it; but we must observe, above all <lb/>
            things, that a certain portion of the water is carried off, and <lb/>
            that it happens at last that there is no superabundance1 of <lb/>
            water; for first that part is removed which the strong winds, <lb/>
            sweeping the ocean, and the ethereal sun, dispelling it with <lb/>
            his rays, subtract from its surface; and next that part which <lb/>
            is distributed through all the earth underneath. For the salt <lb/>
            is strained off in its passage through the ground, and the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of the water flows back, and all meets, here and there, <lb/>
            at the sources of rivers; whence it flows, in a fresh stream, <lb/>
            over the earth, wherever a passage, once cut, has borne <lb/>
            along the waters in their liquid course.2</p>
          <p>I shall now, therefore, observe concerning the air, that it <lb/>
            is changed,3 every hour, in innumerable ways. For whatever <lb/>
            is perpetually passing off from bodies, is all carried into the <lb/>
            vast ocean of air; and unless it were to restore particles back <lb/>
            to those bodies, and to recruit them as their substance passes <lb/>
            away, all things would by this time have been dissolved and <lb/>
            converted into air. It accordingly does not cease to be per- <note type="footnote"> 1 That a certain portion of the water is carried off. and that it <lb/>

            Lambinus notices the easy flow of this verse, and observes how well <lb/>

            of representative versification which perhaps no other English line <lb/>

            petually generated from bodies, and perpetually to return <lb/>
            back to bodies; since it is agreed that all things are in con­ <lb/>
            stant flux.</p>
          <p>The ethereal sun, too, the great fountain of liquid light, <lb/>
            floods the heaven perpetually with new brightness, and in­ <lb/>
            stantly supplies with a new ray the place of the ray that has <lb/>
            passed off. For whatever brightness it first sends forth, is, <lb/>
            wherever it falls, lost to it. This you may collect from hence, <lb/>
            that as soon as clouds have begun to come over the sun, and, <lb/>
            as it were, to break through the rays of light, all the lower <lb/>
            part of these rays is immediately lost, and the earth, wherever <lb/>
            the clouds pass, is overshadowed; so that you may understand <lb/>
            that things constantly require a fresh supply of light, and <lb/>
            that every first emission of radiance is dispersed; nor could <lb/>
            objects otherwise be seen in the sunshine, unless the fountain <lb/>
            of light itself furnished a perpetual supply.</p>
          <p>Even your nocturnal torches, which are things of earth, <lb/>
            your hanging lamps, and tapers, brilliant with waving flames, <lb/>
            and showing themselves fat with abundance of smoke, are im­ <lb/>
            pelled,1 in a similar manner, by the agency of heat, to emit <lb/>
            new radiance; they incessantly discharge their tremulous <lb/>
            rays;2 they never cease; nor does the light, as if broken off, <lb/>
            leave the place dark. So swiftly is the destruction of that <lb/>
            flame hastened from all its rays, through the rapid origination <lb/>
            and emission of new particles. Thus, too, we must suppose <lb/>
            that the sun, and moon, and stars throw off their light through <lb/>
            successive generations of beams,3 and perpetually lose what­ <lb/>
            ever rays are first to pass from them; so that you must not <lb/>
            by any means suppose that these bodies maintain imperishable <lb/>
            vigour.</p>
          <p>Do you not see, moreover, that even stones are overcome <lb/>
            by time ? Do you not observe that lofty towers fall, and that <lb/>
            rocks decay ? Do you not notice that the temples and images <lb/>
            of the gods, overcome with age, open in fissures; and that the <lb/>
            sacred deities themselves cannot extend the limits of fate, or <lb/>
            struggle against the laws of nature ? <note type="footnote"> I Are impelled.] Ver. 298. Properant. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 They incessantly discharge their tremulous rays.] Ver. 299. <lb/>

          <p>Besides, do we not see that the monuments of heroes fail ? <lb/>
            You might even believe that they desire for themselves a time <lb/>
            to grow old.1 Do we not observe that flints crumble from the <lb/>
            lofty mountains, and cannot endure and withstand the powerful <lb/>
            force of even a finite age ? For if they were bodies which, <lb/>
            through infinite ages, had sustained all the assaults of time, and <lb/>
            continued exempt from dissolution, they would not now sud­ <lb/>
            denly be broken away and fall to pieces.</p>
          <p>Further, contemplate this heaven around and above us, <lb/>
            which contains all the earth in its embrace; it produces, as <lb/>
            some say, all things from itself, and receives all things, when <lb/>
            dissolved, into itself. But it was a generated body, and con­ <lb/>
            sists wholly of perishable substance. For whatever increases <lb/>
            and nourishes other things from itself, must by that means be <lb/>
            diminished, and must be recruited by receiving2 into itself <lb/>
            fresh substances.</p>
          <p>In addition, if there was no origin of the heavens and earth <lb/>
            from generation, and if they existed from all eternity, how is <lb/>
            it that other poets, before the time of the Theban war, and the <lb/>
            destruction of Troy, have not also sung of other exploits of <lb/>
            the inhabitants of earth ? How have the actions of so many <lb/>
            men thus from time to time fallen into oblivion? How is it <lb/>
            that they no where survive in remembrance, and are no where <lb/>
            stamped on everlasting monuments of fame ?</p>
          <p>But, as I am of opinion, the whole of the world is of com­ <lb/>
            paratively modern date, and recent in its origin; and had its <note type="footnote"> 1 You might even believe that they desire for themselves a <lb/>

            as Bentley observes, there is no example to support it,) but whether <lb/>

            beginning but a short time ago. From which cause, also, some <lb/>
            arts are but now being refined, and are even at present on the <lb/>
            increase; many improvements are in this age added to ships; <lb/>
            musicians have but recently produced melodious sounds. This <lb/>
            nature and system of the world, too, of which I write, has been <lb/>
            but lately discovered ; and I myself, among the first discover­ <lb/>
            ers, have been found the first poet that could express it in <lb/>
            the language of my country.</p>
          <p>But if, perchance, you suppose that all these arts2 formerly <lb/>
            existed the same as at present, but that generations of men have <lb/>
            perished by burning fire, or that cities have fallen by some <lb/>
            great catastrophe of the world, or that violent rivers, through <lb/>
            continual rains, have inundated the earth, and overwhelmed <lb/>
            cities, you must so much the more, being convinced by these <lb/>
            facts? admit that there will probably be also a destruction of <lb/>
            the earth and the heaven. For, since things were affected and <lb/>
            shaken by so great disorders, and so great dangers, if a more <lb/>
            serious cause had then pressed upon them, they might univers­ <lb/>
            ally have suffered destruction and mighty ruin. Nor do we, <lb/>

            assaults, or unsusceptible of them; (as is a vacuum, which re­ <lb/>
            mains intangible, and suffers nothing from impact;) or they <lb/>
            must be indestructible for this reason, that there is no suffici­ <lb/>
            ency of space round about, into which substances may, as it <lb/>
            were, separate and be dissolved (as the entire universe is <lb/>
            eternal, inasmuch as there is neither any space without it, <lb/>
            into which its parts may disperse; nor are there any bodies <lb/>
            which may fall upon it, and break it to pieces by violent con­ <lb/>
            cussion). But, as I have demonstrated, neither is the nature <lb/>
            of this world of a solid consistence, since in all compound <lb/>
            bodies vacuity is mixed ; nor is it like vacuity itself; nor, <lb/>
            again, are bodies wanting, which, rising fortuitously from the <lb/>
            infinite of space, may overthrow the sum of things with <lb/>
            a violent tempest, or bring upon it some other kind, whatever <lb/>
            it may be, of disaster and danger; nor, moreover, is vastness <lb/>
            and profundity of space wanting, into which the walls of the <lb/>
            world may be scattered, or, assaulted by some other kind of <lb/>
            force, may be dissolved. The gate of death, therefore, is not <lb/>
            closed to the heaven, or to the sun, or to the earth, or to the <lb/>
            deep waters of the sea, but stands open, and looks back for <lb/>
            them, with a mighty and huge abyss.</p>
          <p>For which reason, since these existing things are dissoluble, <lb/>
            you must necessarily allow that they are generated of indisso­ <lb/>
            luble elements; for bodies which are of mortal consistence, <lb/>
            could not have been able, from all eternity, to contemn till <lb/>

            stantly do the waters threaten, even of their own power, to <lb/>
            deluge all things from the deep gulf of the ocean ; (but their <lb/>
            threats are vain ; for winds, sweeping the floods, and the ethe­ <lb/>
            real sun, dispelling them with his rays, diminish their bulk, <lb/>
            and seem to trust that they can dry up all things before the <lb/>
            waters can attain the completion of their design;) maintain­ <lb/>
            ing so great a war, they persist to strive with one another for <lb/>
            their great objects, and to contend, as it seems, with equal <lb/>
            efforts; though, as is reported, fire was once superior on the <lb/>
            earth, and water once reigned triumphant over the plains.</p>
          <p>For fire prevailed, and burnt and consumed many parts, <lb/>
            when the erring and impetuous fury of the sun's horses hur­ <lb/>
            ried Phaethon through the whole heaven and over the entire <lb/>
            earth. But the omnipotent Father, incensed with fierce rage, <lb/>
            hurled Phaethon from his chariot to the earth by the sudden <lb/>
            stroke of a thunderbolt; and the Sun, meeting him as he fell, <lb/>
            caught up the eternal lamp of the world, brought back his <lb/>
            scattered horses, and yoked them trembling to the car; <lb/>
            and, guiding them in their own path, restored and re-organ­ <lb/>
            ized all things. This, you must be aware, is the story which <lb/>
            the poets of the Greeks sung, but which is too far removed <lb/>
            from truth and reason. For fire may have the superiority, <lb/>
            when more atoms than usual of igneous matter have collected <lb/>
            from the infinite of space; but afterwards its strength, being by <lb/>
            some means repressed, necessarily subsides; else all things, <lb/>
            burned up by a scorching atmosphere, would utterly perish.</p>
          <p>Once, too, as tradition tells, water having-risen-in-a-body,1 <lb/>
            began to have the mastery; at which period it overwhelmed <lb/>
            numbers of mankind with its waves; but subsequently, when <lb/>
            its strength, (which had risen from the infinite profound,) was <lb/>
            in some way turned aside and repelled, the rains came to a <lb/>
            stand, and the rivers diminished their violence.</p>
          <p>But I shall now proceed to relate, in due course, how the <lb/>
            combination of matter2 established the heaven and the earth, <lb/>
            the depths of the sea, and the revolutions of the sun and moon <note type="footnote"> 1 Once, too,-water having risen-in-a-body, &amp;c.] Ver. 412. Humot <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>For assuredly neither the primary elements of things dis. <lb/>
            posed themselves severally in their own order by wisdom or <lb/>
            counsel arising from a sagacious understanding; nor, certainly, <lb/>
            did they agree among themselves what motions each should <lb/>
            produce; but because the primordial atoms of the world, being <lb/>
            many, were agitated by concussions, in many ways, through <lb/>
            an infinite space of time, and were accustomed to be carried <lb/>
            forward by their own weights, and to combine in all modes, <lb/>
            and to try all efforts, as if to ascertain whichsoever of them, <lb/>
            meeting together, might give birth to some offspring, it from <lb/>
            this cause happens that, being spread abroad during a vast <lb/>
            period of duration, and attempting all kinds of combinations <lb/>
            and movements, those at length came together, which, having <lb/>
            suddenly coalesced, became at first, and become now, from <lb/>
            time to time, the commencements of great productions,1 the <lb/>
            origin of the earth, the sea, and the heaven, and of every kind <lb/>
            of living creatures.</p>
          <p>Here, at that time, could be seen neither the chariot of the <lb/>
            sun, flying on high with its abundant light, nor the stars of the <lb/>
            great firmament, nor the sea, nor the heaven, nor the earth, <lb/>
            nor the air; nor could any thing be discerned similar to our <lb/>
            present objects, but only a certain crude agitation of matter, <lb/>
            and a congeries swelling up together. Afterwards the parts <lb/>
            began to separate ; and similar things began to be united with <lb/>
            similar, and to evolve the world, and display its parts, and <lb/>
            arrange its different members, which were generated from all <lb/>

            high heaven from the earth, and to cause that the sea and <lb/>
            other water should spread abroad separately, and that the stars <lb/>
            of heaven should shine by themselves pure and distinct.</p>
          <p>For, in the first place, the several atoms of earth, because <lb/>
            they were heavy, and involved one with another, met all to­ <lb/>
            gether in the middle, and took, as it were, the lowest place;1 <lb/>
            which atoms, the more closely they cohered, the more effectu­ <lb/>
            ally they excluded from themselves those particles which were <lb/>
            to form the sea, the stars, the sun and the moon, and the walls <lb/>
            of this great world. For all these latter parts of nature con­ <lb/>
            sist of more smooth and round particles, and of atoms much <lb/>
            more diminutive, than the earth; and, accordingly, the fiery <lb/>
            ether, bursting forth from the several parts, through the small <lb/>
            pores of the earth, first raised itself on high, and, being light, <lb/>
            carried with it much fire; by a process similar to what we <lb/>
            often witness, when, in the morning, the golden rays of the <lb/>
            beaming sun first blush over the grass gemmed with dew, <lb/>
            and when the stagnant lakes, and ever-flowing rivers, exhale <lb/>
            a mist, and earth itself sometimes appears to smoke; all which <lb/>
            vapours, when they are united in the height above us, cover <lb/>
            the heaven in an apparently condensed body. So, too, at <lb/>
            that time, the light and expanded ether, diffused around in a <lb/>
            united mass, collected itself; and thus, being widely extended <lb/>
            in every direction, enclosed all other things in its vast embrace.2</p>
          <p>To this formation of the ether succeeded the rise of the sun <lb/>
            and moon, and of those bodies whose orbs revolve in the air <lb/>
            between both; bodies which neither the earth nor the vast <lb/>
            ether attracted to itself, because they were neither so heavy <lb/>
            as to sink down to the earth, nor so light as to glide in the <lb/>
            highest regions; and yet they so exist between both, that they <lb/>
            revolve as active bodies,3 and are a part of the entire world. <note type="footnote"> 1 Met all together in the middle, and took, as it were, the lowest <lb/>

            As, in our own bodies, some members may remain at rest. <lb/>
            whilst others are still in motion.</p>
          <p>These substances, therefore, being withdrawn, the earth, <lb/>
            where the vast blue region of the sea now spreads, suddenly <lb/>
            sunk down, and hollowed out depths by means of the salt <lb/>
            flood; and in proportion as, day after day, the surrounding <lb/>
            tide of air, and the warm rays of the sun, urged the earth <lb/>
            (lying exposed even to its extreme bounds) with frequent im­ <lb/>
            pulses, so that, being thus acted upon, it might collect in con­ <lb/>
            densation towards its own centre, so much the more the salt <lb/>
            fluid, pressed out from its body, increased with its flood the <lb/>
            sea and the liquid plains; and so much more the numerous <lb/>
            particles of heat and air, escaping forth from other substances, <lb/>
            flew upwards, and formed, afar from the earth, the lofty and <lb/>
            shining temples of the sky. The plains sunk down, and the <lb/>
            slopes of the high mountains increased; for such inequality was <lb/>
            inevitable; as the rocks could neither subside, nor could all <lb/>
            parts of the ground settle to the same level. Thus, then, the <lb/>
            heavy-mass of the earth, with condensed bulk, stood firm; <lb/>
            and all the heavy grossness of the world, as it were, collected <lb/>
            to the bottom, and sunk down like dregs into the deep.</p>
          <p>Then the sea, the air, and the fiery ether itself, which were <lb/>
            of liquid consistence, were all left pure; and of these bodies <lb/>
            some were lighter than others, and the ether, being of the <lb/>
            greatest subtlety and levity, floats above the breezes of the <lb/>
            air, nor allows its clear substance to mingle with the matters <lb/>
            that disturb the aerial regions; it leaves all these lower parts <lb/>
            to be swept with violent whirlwinds; it leaves them to be <lb/>
            disturbed with tumultuous storms; whilst itself, gliding with <lb/>
            settled impulse, bears along its own fires. For that the ether <lb/>
            may revolve thus steadily, and with uniform tenor, the flood <lb/>
            in the Euxine shows,1 which moves with a settled flux, pre­ <lb/>
            serving one unvaried direction in its course. <note type="footnote">1 The flood in the Euxine shows.] Ver. 508. Significat Ponto <lb/>

            not, like other seas, with tides alternating in opposite directions, <lb/>

          <p>Let us now state what is the cause of the motion of the <lb/>
            stars. In the first place, if the great orb of heaven whirls <lb/>
            round, we must admit that air presses and urges the sky on <lb/>
            either side, and confines it externally, and encloses it in each <lb/>
            direction ; then that another body of air flows over our heads, <lb/>
            and tends in the same direction in which the bright stars of <lb/>
            the eternal world roll;1 and that there is still other air beneath <lb/>
            our feet,2 which carries along the heaven in the opposite direc­ <lb/>
            tion, as we see running streams turn wheels and buckets.</p>
          <p>It is likewise possible that the whole heaven may remain <lb/>
            stationary, though the bright constellations are nevertheless <lb/>
            borne along; whether because active tides of ether are con­ <lb/>
            fined within the sky, and, seeking an outlet, whirl themselves <lb/>
            round, and roll with them the stars through the vast regions <lb/>
            of heaven ; or whether air, flowing from some quarter with­ <lb/>
            out, wheels and impels the stars; or whether they of them­ <lb/>
            selves can move forward, whither the sustenance of each <lb/>
            attracts3 and invites them, while pursuing their course, and re­ <lb/>
            cruiting their igneous substances every where throughout the <lb/>
            heavens. For which of these causes prevails in this world, it <lb/>
            is difficult to lay down as certain ; but I demonstrate only what <lb/>
            is possible, and may be effected, throughout the universe, in <lb/>
            various worlds, formed in various ways,4 and seek to assign <lb/>
            several causes for the motions of the stars; which causes may. <lb/>
            operate, in different parts, through the whole of things; but <lb/>
            of which one must necessarily be this very cause, that produces <lb/>
            motion in our stars; though to decide which of them it is, is, <note type="footnote"> I In which the bright stars of the eternal world roll.] Ver. 515. <lb/>

            by no means the part of a man proceeding, like myself, cau­ <lb/>

          <p>And that the earth may rest in the middle1 part of the <lb/>
            world, it is necessary that its weight should gradually, as it <lb/>
            were, become evanescent and imperceptible,2 and that it should <lb/>
            have another substance beneath it, united with it from its <lb/>
            earliest age, and closely connected with the aerial parts of the <lb/>
            world, in which it was produced and continues to live. The <lb/>
            earth is, therefore, no burden to the air, nor at all depresses it; <lb/>
            just as his limbs are no burden to a man ; and just as the head <lb/>
            is no burden to the neck; nor do we feel the whole weight of <lb/>
            the body press upon the feet. But whatever weights fall upon <lb/>
            us, and are laid upon us, externally, hurt or annoy us, although <lb/>
            they are often far less than those which are within us; of so great <lb/>
            importance it is to understand what one thing can effect by <lb/>
            union with another. The earth, accordingly, was not brought <lb/>
            into this world suddenly, as a foreign body, and cast, from some <lb/>
            other quarter, upon air that was strange to it, but was produced <lb/>
            together with the rest of the world, and as a regular part of it, at <lb/>
            its first origin; just as our members are seen to be formed <lb/>
            with us.</p>
          <p>Besides, the earth, when shaken with violent thunder, imme­ <lb/>
            diately shakes all things which are above it with its motion ; <lb/>
            an effect which it could by no means produce, unless it were <lb/>
            combined with the aerial parts of the world, and with the <note type="footnote"> I And that the earth may rest in the middle, §c.] Ver. 535. <lb/>
            Terraque ut in media mundi regione quiescat, &amp;c. " It may reasonably <lb/>
            be asked how the earth, when Lucretius so often speaks of its weight, <lb/>
            can remain in the middle of the air; and why it does not leave its <lb/>
            position, and sink into the infinite void. To this the poet answers, <lb/>
            that though the air alone surrounds the earth, yet that, as the earth <lb/>
            and air are closely connected, and have been from their origin parts <lb/>
            of the same whole, the earth is in consequence no burden to the air, <lb/>
            but rests upon it as if all its gravity were laid aside. But the case <lb/>
            would be otherwise if the earth had been brought into this world <lb/>
            from another; for then its weight would be felt by the air as that of <lb/>
            a foreign body; as we, in regard to our own bodies, feel even a <lb/>
            small substance that lies upon them externally, though neither the <lb/>
            head, nor the other members of the body, are a burden to one an. <lb/>
            other; inasmuch as they are congeneous, and bound by a common <lb/>
            law of connexion. Epicurus, in his Epistle to Herodotus, says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν <lb/>

            stance of the soul sustains the body, which is of great weight, <lb/>
            simply because it is so closely united and combined with it ? <lb/>
            What power, too, but that of the soul, which governs the limbs, <lb/>
            can raise the body with a vigorous leap from the ground ?</p>
          <p>Do you now understand how much force a subtle sub­ <lb/>
            stance may have, when it is united with a heavy body, as the <lb/>
            air is joined with the earth, and the power of the soul with <lb/>
            ourselves ?</p>
          <p>Nor can the circumference of the sun be much greater, or <lb/>
            its fire less,' than it appears to our senses. For from what­ <lb/>
            ever distances fires can throw their rays, and cast a warm <lb/>
            heat upon our bodies, the ejection of the heat from those dis­ <lb/>
            tances detracts nothing from the bulk of the igneous matter, <lb/>
            and the fire is not at all more contracted to the view. Since, <lb/>
            therefore, the heat of the sun, and its effused light, reach to <lb/>
            our senses, and the parts about us shine with its rays, the <lb/>
            form and outline of the sun must, on this account, appear as <lb/>
            it really is, so that you can add nothing more to it, or make it <lb/>
            less.</p>
          <p>And the moon, whether, as she glides through the sky, she illu­ <lb/>
            minates its regions with a borrowed light, or whether she sends <lb/>
            forth radiance from her own body ; whichsoever is the case, <lb/>
            she is, as sAe pursues her course, of no larger a dimension 2 than <lb/>
            she appears to our eyes as we observe her. For all objects <lb/>
            which, being far remote from us, we view through a large <lb/>
            body of air, look confused in their appearance, before their out­ <lb/>
            line seems at all diminished. For which reason the moon, <lb/>
            since it presents a clear shape and defined outline, (as it does <note type="footnote"> 1 Nor can the circumference of the sun be much greater, or its <lb/>
            fire less, §c.] Ver. 567. Nee nimio solis major rota, nec minor ardor <lb/>
            esse potest. All that is meant is, that the sun cannot be much <lb/>
            greater or much less than it appears to us. " An irrational and ab­ <lb/>

            whenever its outmost edges1 are observed,) must hence appear <lb/>
            to us in the sky just as large as it is.2</p>
          <p>Further, whatsoever stars in the heavens you view from <lb/>
            hence, can, assuredly, be only very little less, or only very little <lb/>
            larger,3 than they appear; since of whatsoever fires we see <lb/>
            on the earth, even whilst the motion of their light is plain, and <lb/>
            their glow is clearly perceived, the outline seems at times to <lb/>
            vary in one way or other, contracting or expanding, according <lb/>
            as it is more or less distant.</p>
          <p>It is not, moreover, a matter of wonder, how so small a <lb/>
            body as the sun can emit so large a quantity of light, as to <lb/>
            cover with its flood the seas, the whole earth, and the heavens, <lb/>
            and to pervade all things with its quickening heat. Since it <lb/>
            is possible that one fountain of the light of the whole world, <lb/>
            opened from hence, may flow forth abundantly, and scatter its <lb/>
            radiance abroad;4 because the atoms of heat, we may suppose, <lb/>
            so meet together here from all parts of the world, and their <lb/>
            assemblage forms such a flood, that all this heat may flow <lb/>
            from one source. For do you not observe, too, how small a <lb/>
            spring of water sometimes irrigates the meadows far and wide, <lb/>
            and flows exuberantly over the fields ?</p>
          <p>It is also possible that heat may pervade the air with a <lb/>
            strong glow from no very great fire in the sun, if, perchance, <lb/>
            the air be so tempered and disposed as to be excited to warmth, <lb/>
            though affected with but gentle fervour; as we sometimes see <lb/>
            fire, from one spark, spread in all directions among corn-fields <lb/>
            and straw.</p>
          <p>And, perhaps, the sun, shining on high with its rosy light, <lb/>
            contains about it much heat in secret stores-of-fire, which, <lb/>

          <p>Nor does the law of the sun's motion appear plain and evi. <lb/>
            dent, nor is it demonstrable how he passes from his summer <lb/>
            regions to. the wintry part of his course in Capricorn, and <lb/>
            how, coming back from thence, he turns to the solstitial <lb/>
            points; nor do toe understand how the moon seems to traverse <lb/>
            that space in each month, in passing through which the sun <lb/>
            occupies the period of a year; a plain reason, I say, has not <lb/>
            been assigned for these phenomena.</p>
          <p>For, in the first place, that appears possible which the ven­ <lb/>
            erable opinion of the philosopher Democritus asserts; that <lb/>
            the nearer each of the heavenly bodies is to the earth, the <lb/>
            less swiftly can they be carried round by the revolution of <lb/>
            the heaven; since the rapid and strong force of the upper <lb/>
            sky decreases and loses its power beneath; and that, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, the sun, with the lower constellations following it,1 is <lb/>
            gradually left behind, because it is much beneath the fiery <lb/>
            signs ;2 also that the moon, from this same cause, falls back so <lb/>
            much the more, for the more distant its course, being lower, <lb/>
            is from the heaven, and approaches to the earth, the less can <lb/>
            it exert its swiftness with the signs. Since the more gentle <lb/>
            is the speed with which the moon, being lower than the sun, <lb/>
            is borne along, the more easily all the signs around overtake <lb/>
            it, and are carried past it. Hence it happens, that the moon <lb/>
            seems to return more quickly to each sign, because the signs <lb/>
            return towards it.</p>
          <p>It is possible, also, that two currents of air, at a certain <lb/>
            season, may blow in turns3 from opposite quarters of the <lb/>
            world; of which currents one may be that which drives the sun <note type="footnote"> 1 With the lower constellations following it.] Ver. 626. Cum pos­ <lb/>

            from the summer signs into the winter part of his course, and <lb/>
            into freezing cold; and the other may be that which sends him <lb/>
            back from the freezing shades of cold into the warm regions <lb/>
            and glowing constellations. And, in like manner, we may <lb/>
            suppose that the moon, and the stars, which revolve for long <lb/>
            years in vast orbits, may move by means of two currents of <lb/>
            air in opposite directions. Do you not notice, also, that clouds, <lb/>
            by means of opposite winds, go in different ways, the lower <lb/>
            contrary to the upper ? And why, therefore, may not these <lb/>
            heavenly bodies be borne through the vast circuits of the sky <lb/>
            by currents opposed to each other ?</p>
          <p>But the reason why night1 covers the earth with its great <lb/>
            darkness, is either because the light grows weak when the sun, <lb/>
            after his long course, has reached the extremity of the heaven, <lb/>
            and has sent forth his fires languidly, as being exhausted with <lb/>
            the journey,2 and wasted by passing through a long tract of <lb/>
            air; or because the same force, which carried the solar orb <lb/>
            above the earth, compels it to turn its course beneath the earth.</p>
          <p>Matuta, also, the goddess of the morning, leads forth the rosy <lb/>
            Aurora, and spreads abroad the light, at a certain hour, either <lb/>
            because the same sun, which was under the earth, returning <lb/>
            again, aspires to the heaven, proceeding to enlighten it with <lb/>
            his rays; or because, at that particular time, bodies of fire <lb/>
            congregate, and many atoms of heat are accustomed to meet <lb/>
            in confluence, which cause a new light of the sun to be per­ <lb/>
            petually produced. Thus it is said, that from the lofty hills <lb/>
            of Ida3 the rays of the sun, when his light rises in the east, are <lb/>
            seen dispersed, and that they afterwards collect, as it were, <lb/>
            into one body, and form a complete orb.</p>
          <p>Nor ought it, in such phenomena, to be a subject of won­ <lb/>
            der, that these atoms of fire can thus flow together, and re­ <lb/>
            new the splendour of the sun, at a certain time. For we <lb/>
            observe many other things which take place at a certain time <note type="footnote"> I But the reason why night, §c.] Ver. 649. He now begins to ex­ <lb/>

            in all departments Of nature; the groves flourish at a certain <lb/>
            time, and at a certain time drop their verdure. At a certain <lb/>
            time, also, age directs the teeth to be shed; and causes the <lb/>
            immature youth to bloom with soft down, and to let the flexible <lb/>
            beard, too, descend from his cheeks. Lightnings, moreover, <lb/>
            snow, rain, cloudy weather, and winds, take place at seasons <lb/>
            of the year by no means uncertain. For since the first com­ <lb/>
            mencement of causes thus arose, and the affairs of the world <lb/>
            thus proceeded, as at present, from their earliest origin, <lb/>
            every event is a consequence in the unvarying course of <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>That the days also increase while the nights grow shorter, <lb/>
            and that the days are diminished in length when the nights <lb/>
            become augmented, may possibly happen, either because the <lb/>
            same sun, revolving below and above the earth, divides the <lb/>
            regions of the air with unequal curves, and distinguishes the <lb/>
            orb of heaven into dissimilar parts, while, whatever it has <lb/>
            taken from one part of it, it adds, as it revolves, just so much <lb/>
            to the opposite part, until it has come to that sign in the <lb/>
            heavens where the node of the year1 makes the darkness of <lb/>
            night equal to the light of day: (for the heaven has two sepa­ <lb/>
            rate points, at equal distances, where the courses of the north <lb/>
            wind and the south meet ;2 owing to the position of the whole <lb/>
            circle of the zodiac, in which the revolving sun consumes the pe­ <lb/>
            riod of the year, illumining the earth and the sky with oblique <lb/>
            light,-as the system of those declares who have observed that <lb/>
            whole region of the heaven which is distinguished by the array <lb/>
            of the twelve signs:) or, because the air is denser in certain <lb/>
            parts, the tremulous rays of light are therefore retarded, and <lb/>
            cannot easily penetrate it and emerge to the dawn ; for which <lb/>
            reason the nights in the winter delay long, until the bright <lb/>

          <p>As for the moon, sAe may shine because she is struck with <lb/>
            the rays of the sun, and may turn towards us every day a <lb/>
            larger portion of light in her aspect, as she recedes farther <lb/>
            from the sun's orb, until, being opposite to him, she has shone <lb/>
            forth with fullest splendour, and, rising on high in the east, has <lb/>
            beheld his setting in the west; thence, also, retiring back­ <lb/>
            wards, she may, as it were, hide her light gradually, as she <lb/>
            approaches from the opposite side, along the circle of the <lb/>
            zodiac, nearer to the sun's radiance; as those philosophers <lb/>
            suppose, who make the moon to be in shape like a ball, and to <lb/>
            pursue her path of revolution beneath the sun; land hence <lb/>
            it happens that they seem to say what is true.]1</p>
          <p>There is also a hypothesis by which the moon may revolve <lb/>
            and present various phases of brightness, with her own light. <lb/>
            For it is possible that there may be another body, which moves <lb/>
            and advances2 together with her, and which in every way ob­ <lb/>
            structs and hinders her light, but nevertheless cannot be seen, <lb/>
            as it passes along in total darkness.</p>
          <p>And the moon may possibly revolve upon her axis, like a <lb/>
            ball3 tinged with shining light only on one side, and may, by <lb/>
            turning her orb, present to us her various phases. Thus, pro­ <lb/>
            gressively, she turns that part which is illuminated, so as to <lb/>
            behold us with full aspect and open eye ;4 then, by degrees, <lb/>
            she turns away and removes from us the brilliant side of her <lb/>
            orb ;5 as, indeed, the Babylonish doctrine of the Chaldæans <lb/>
            taught, which, refuting the method of the Greek astrologers, <note type="footnote"> 1 And hence it happens that they seem to say what is true.] <lb/>

            always revolve devoid of light, be considered able to produce <lb/>
            such an effect at the same time ?</p>
          <p>And why, also, may not the sun, at a certain time, send <lb/>

            shining light,) I now return to the early age of the world, and <lb/>
            the tender fields of earth, to consider what kind of productions <lb/>
            they first ventured,1 with their new power of generation, to <lb/>
            raise into the regions of light, and to commit to uncertain <lb/>
            winds.</p>
          <p>In the beginning, then, the earth spread over the hills the <lb/>
            growth of herbs, and the beauty of verdure, and the flowery <lb/>
            fields, throughout all regions, shone with a green hue; and <lb/>
            then was given, to the various kinds of trees, full power of <lb/>
            shooting upwards through the air.2 For as feathers, and hairs, <lb/>
            and bristles, are first produced over the limbs of quadrupeds <lb/>
            and the bodies of the winged tribes, so the new earth then <lb/>
            first put forth herbs and trees; and afterwards generated the <lb/>
            numerous races of animals,8 which arose in various forms and <lb/>
            by various modes. For animals, that were to live on the earth, <lb/>
            could assuredly neither have fallen from the sky,4 nor have <lb/>
            come forth from the salt depths of the sea. It remains, there­ <lb/>
            fore, to believe that the earth must justly have obtained the <lb/>
            name of MOTHER, since from the earth all living creatures were <lb/>
            born. And even now many animals spring forth from the <lb/>
            earth, which are generated by means of moisture and the <lb/>
            quickening heat of the sun. It is accordingly less wonderful, <lb/>
            if, at that time, creatures more numerous and of larger size <lb/>
            arose, and came to maturity while the earth and the air were <lb/>
            yet fresh and vigorous.</p>
          <p>First of all, the race of winged animals, and variegated <lb/>
            birds, left their eggs, being excluded in the season of spring; <lb/>
            as grasshoppers, in these days, spontaneously leave their thin <lb/>
            coats 5 in the summer, proceeding to seek sustenance and life.</p>
          <p>Next, be assured, the earth produced, for the first time, the <lb/>
            tribes of men and beasts; for much heat and moisture abound- <note type="footnote"> 1 Ventured.] Ver. 780. Creduint. " Creduint for crediderint, i. e. <lb/>

            ed through the plains, and hence, where any suitable region <lb/>
            offered itself, a hind of wombs sprung up.1 adhering to the <lb/>
            earth by fibres. These, when the age of the infants within <lb/>
            them, at the season of maturity, had opened, (escaping from <lb/>
            their moist-enclosure, and seeking for air,) nature, in those <lb/>
            places, prepared the pores of the earth, and forced it to pour <lb/>
            from its open veins a liquid like milk ; just as every woman <lb/>
            at present, when she has brought forth, is stored with sweet <lb/>
            milk, because all the strength of the food is directed to the <lb/>
            breasts. Thus the earth afforded nourishment to the infants ; <lb/>
            the warmth rendered a garment unnecessary; and the grass <lb/>
            supplied a couch abounding with luxuriant and tender down.</p>
          <p>But the early age of the world gave forth neither severe <lb/>
            cold nor extraordinary heat, nor winds of impetuous violence. <lb/>
            For all these alike increase and acquire strength by time.</p>
          <p>For which cause, I say again and again, the earth has <lb/>
            justly acquired, and justly retains, the name of MOTHER, since <lb/>
            she herself brought forth the race of men, and produced, at <lb/>
            this certain time, almost every kind of animal which exults <lb/>
            over the vast mountains, and the birds of the air, at the same <lb/>
            period, with all their varied forms. But because she must <lb/>
            necessarily have some termination to bearing, she ceased, like <lb/>
            a woman, exhausted by length of time. For lapse of time <lb/>
            changes the nature of the whole world, and one condition after <lb/>
            another must succeed to all things, nor does any being con­ <lb/>
            tinue always like itself. All is unsettled; nature alters and <lb/>
            impels every thing to change. For one thing decays, and, <lb/>
            grown weak through age, languishes ; another, again, grows <lb/>
            up, and bursts forth from contempt.2 Thus age changes the <lb/>
            nature of the whole world, and one condition after another <lb/>
            falls upon the earth; so that what she could once bear she <lb/>
            can bear no longer ; while she can bear what she did not bear <lb/>
            of old.</p>
          <p>The earth, also, in that age, made efforts to produce va­ <lb/>
            rious monsters, that sprung up with wonderful faces and <lb/>
            limbs; the hermaphrodite, between both sexes, and not either, <note type="footnote"> 1 Wombs sprung up, &amp;c.] Ver. 806. Crescebant uteri terræ radicibus <lb/>

            but removed from both; others wanting feet, and others des­ <lb/>
            titute of hands; some also were found dumb for want of a <lb/>
            mouth, and some blind without even a face; and others again <lb/>
            were shackled by the cohesion of their limbs over their whole <lb/>
            bodies, so that they could neither do any thing, nor go in any <lb/>
            direction; could neither avoid harm, nor take what was ne­ <lb/>
            cessary to preserve life.</p>
          <p>Other prodigies and portents of this kind she generated ; <lb/>
            but to no purpose; for nature abhorred and prevented their <lb/>
            increase; nor could they reach the desired maturity of age, <lb/>
            or find nutriment, or be united in the pleasures of love. For <lb/>
            we see that many circumstances must concur with other cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, in order that living creatures may be able to pro­ <lb/>
            duce their kinds by propagation. First it is necessary that <lb/>
            there be food; then that there be genial semen throughout <lb/>
            the organs, which may flow when the limbs are relaxed in <lb/>
            union; and likewise, for the female to be united with the <lb/>
            male, they must both have correspondent members, by which <lb/>
            each may combine in mutual delight with the other.</p>
          <p>Many kinds of animal life, too, must then have perished, not <lb/>
            having been able to continue their species by propagation. For <lb/>
            whatever creatures you see breathing the vital air, assuredly <lb/>
            either craft, or courage, or at least activity, has preserved and <lb/>
            defended their race from the commencement of its existence. <lb/>
            And there are many which, from their usefulness to mankind, <lb/>
            remain, as it were, intrusted to us, and committed to our <lb/>
            guardianship.</p>
          <p>In the first place, courage has protected the fierce brood of <lb/>
            lions, and the savage races of other wild animals; and craft <lb/>
            has secured the fox, as swiftness has saved the stag. But the <lb/>
            light-slumbering breed of dogs, with their faithful affections, <lb/>
            and all the various species of horses,1 and the woolly flocks, <lb/>
            too, and horned cattle, all these, my dear Memmius, are com­ <lb/>
            mitted to the protection of man. For they have anxiously <lb/>
            avoided wild beasts, and have sought peace; and plenty of <lb/>
            subsistence has been provided for them without labour of <lb/>
            theirs, which subsistence we secure to them as a reward in <note type="footnote"> 1 And all the various species of horses.] Ver. 863. Et genus <lb/>

            return for their service. But of those to whom nature has <lb/>
            given no such qualities, that they should either be able to <lb/>
            live of themselves, or to afford us any service, why should we <lb/>
            suffer the races to be maintained and protected by our sup­ <lb/>
            port ? Indeed all these, rendered helpless by their own fatal <lb/>
            bonds, were exposed as a prey and a prize to other animals, <lb/>
            until nature brought their whole species to destruction.</p>
          <p>But Centaurs, and such creatures, there neither were, nor <lb/>
            ever can be; for there can never exist an animal formed of a <lb/>
            double nature and of two bodies; an animal made up of such <lb/>
            heterogeneous members that the power in the opposite por­ <lb/>
            tions of the frame cannot possibly be equal. This you may <lb/>
            learn, with however dull an understanding,1 from the follow­ <lb/>
            ing observations.</p>
          <p>First, the horse, when three years of his age have passed, <lb/>
            is flourishing in full vigour; the boy, at this time of life, is <lb/>
            by no means so, but will even often seek in his sleep the milky <lb/>
            teats of his mother's breast. Afterwards, when, in old age, his <lb/>
            lusty vigour and stout limbs are failing the horse, (growing tor­ <lb/>
            pid as life is departing,) behold, at that very period, the young <lb/>
            manis age being in its flower, youth prevails in him,2 and <lb/>
            clothes his cheeks with soft down; so that you cannot pos­ <lb/>
            sibly imagine that Centaurs can be composed or consist of <lb/>
            a man and the servile seed of a horse ;3 or that there can <lb/>
            be Scyllæ, of half-marine bodies, cinctured with fierce dogs; <lb/>
            or other monsters of this sort, whose parts we observe to be <lb/>
            incompatible with each other; parts which neither grow up <lb/>
            together in their bodies, nor acquire vigour together, nor lose <lb/>
            their strength4 together in old age; and which are neither <lb/>
            excited by the same objects of affection, nor agree with the <lb/>
            same tempers, nor find that the same kinds of food are nu­ <lb/>
            tritious to their bodies.5 For you may observe that bearded <note type="footnote"> 1 With however dull an understanding.] Ver. 880. Quamvis he­ <lb/>

            goats often grow fat on hemlock, which to men is rank <lb/>
            poison.</p>
          <p>Since, too, the flame of fire is accustomed to scorch and <lb/>
            burn up the tawny bodies of lions, as well as every kind of <lb/>
            creature on earth that consists of flesh and blood, how was it <lb/>
            possible that a Chimæra, one animal compounded of three <lb/>
            bodies, the fore part a lion, the hinder a dragon, the middle a <lb/>
            goat,1 could blow abroad at its mouth a fierce flame out of its <lb/>
            body?</p>
          <p>For which reason, he who supposes that such animals might <lb/>
            have been produced, even when the earth was new and the <lb/>
            air fresh, (leaning for argument only on this empty term of <lb/>
            newness,) may babble, with equal reason, many other hypo­ <lb/>
            theses of a like nature. He may say that rivers of gold then <lb/>
            flowed every where over the earth, and that the groves were <lb/>
            accustomed to blossom with jewels; or that men were formed <lb/>
            with such power and bulk of limbs, that they could ex­ <lb/>
            tend their steps over the deep seas, and turn the whole <lb/>
            heaven around them with their hands. For though, at the <lb/>
            time when the earth first produced animal life, there were in­ <lb/>
            numerable seeds of things in the ground, this is yet no proof <lb/>
            that creatures could have been generated of mixed natures, <lb/>
            and that heterogeneous members of animals could have been <lb/>
            blended together. Since the various kinds of herbs, and fruits, <lb/>
            and rich groves, which even now spring-up-exuberantly from <lb/>
            the earth, can nevertheless not be produced with a union of <lb/>
            different kinds. But they can readily be produced, if each <lb/>
            proceeds in its own order, and all preserve their distinctions <lb/>
            according to the fixed law of nature.</p>
          <p>And that early race of men upon the earth was much more <lb/>
            hardy; as it was natural that they should be, for the hard <lb/>
            earth herself bore them. They were internally sustained with <lb/>
            bones both larger and more solid, and furnished with strong <lb/>
            nerves throughout their bodies; nor were they a race that <lb/>
            could easily be injured by heat or cold, or by change of food, <lb/>
            or by any corporeal malady.</p>
          <p>And during many lustres of the sun, revolving through the <lb/>
            heaven, they prolonged their lives after the roving manner <lb/>

            plough, or knew how to turn up the fields with the spade, or <lb/>
            to plant young seedlings in the earth, or to cut, with pruning- <lb/>
            hooks, the old boughs from the lofty trees. That supply which <lb/>
            the sun and rain had afforded, or which the earth had yielded <lb/>
            of its own accord, sufficiently gratified their desires. They <lb/>
            refreshed themselves, for the most part, among the acorn-laden <lb/>
            oaks. The earth, too, then furnished abundance of whortle- <lb/>
            berries,1 even larger than at present, which you now see ripen <lb/>
            in winter, and become of a purple colour. And many rude <lb/>
            kinds of nourishment besides, ample for hapless mortals, the <lb/>
            florid freshness of the world in those days produced.</p>
          <p>The rivers and fountains then invited them to quench their <lb/>
            thirst, as the echoing fall of waters from the high hills now <lb/>
            calls, far and wide, the thirsty tribes of wild beasts. After­ <lb/>
            wards they occupied the sylvan temples of the nymphs, well <lb/>
            known to the wanderers; from which the goddesses sent forth <lb/>
            flowing rills of watery to lave with a copious flood the humid <lb/>
            rocks, trickling over the green moss, and to swell and burst <lb/>
            forth, with a portion of their streams, over the level plain.</p>
          <p>Nor as yet did they understand how to improve their con­ <lb/>
            dition by the aid of fire, or to use skins, and to clothe their <lb/>
            bodies with the spoils of wild beasts. But they dwelt in <lb/>
            groves, and hollow mountains, and woods; and, when com­ <lb/>
            pelled to flee from the violence of the wind and rain, sheltered <lb/>
            their rude limbs amid the thickets.</p>
          <p>Nor could they have regard to any common interest, or <note type="footnote"> 1 Whortle-berries.] Ver. 939. Arbuta. Good translates this, " The <lb/>

          <p>And Venus united the persons of lovers in the woods; for <lb/>

            were the purchase of her favours.</p>
          <p>And, relying on the extraordinary vigour of their hands <lb/>
            and feet, they pursued the sylvan tribes of wild beasts with <lb/>
            missile stones and ponderous clubs; and many they overcame, <lb/>
            while a few escaped them in their dens; and, when surprised <lb/>
            by night, they threw their savage limbs, like bristly boars, <lb/>
            unprotected on the earth, covering themselves over with leaves <lb/>
            and branches.</p>
          <p>Nor did they, trembling and wandering in the shades of <lb/>
            night, seek to recall the day2 and the sun with loud cries <lb/>
            throughout the fields, but, silent and buried in sleep, they <lb/>
            waited till Phœbus, with his roseate beams, should again <lb/>
            spread light over the heavens. For since they had always <lb/>
            been accustomed, from their infancy, to see darkness and <lb/>
            light produced at alternate seasons, it was impossible that <lb/>
            they should ever wonder at the change, or feel apprehension <lb/>
            lest, the beams of the sun being withdrawn for ever, eternal <lb/>
            night should keep possession of the earth. But what rather <lb/>
            gave them trouble, was, that the tribes of wild beasts often <lb/>
            disturbed the rest of hapless sleepers; while, driven from their <lb/>
            cell at the approach of a foaming boar or stout lion, they fled <lb/>
            from their rocky shelter, and yielded up with trembling, at the <lb/>
            dead of night, their couches of leaves to the savage intruders.</p>

            one individual of their number, being caught by wild beasts, <lb/>
            and consumed by their teeth, afforded them living food, and <lb/>
            filled, meanwhile, the groves, and mountains, and forests, with <lb/>

            them of life. Yet, in those times, one day did not consign to <lb/>

            nor did the boisterous floods of the sea dash ships and men <lb/>

          <p>Afterwards, when they procured huts, and skins, and fire, <lb/>
            and the woman, united to the man, came to dwell in the <lb/>
            same place with him; and when the pure and pleasing con­ <lb/>
            nexions of undivided love were known, and they saw a pro­ <lb/>
            geny sprung from themselves; then first the human race <lb/>
            began to be softened and civilized. For fire now rendered <lb/>
            their shivering bodies less able to endure the cold under the <lb/>
            canopy of heaven; and love diminished their strength; and <lb/>
            children with their blandishments easily subdued the ferocious <lb/>
            tempers of their parents. Then, also, neighbours, feeling a <lb/>
            mutual friendship, began to form agreements not to hurt or <lb/>
            injure one another; and they commended, with sounds and <lb/>
            gestures, their children, and the female sex, to each other's <lb/>
            protection; while they signified, with imperfect speech, that <lb/>
            it is right for every one to have compassion on the weak. <lb/>
            Such concord, however, could not be established universally; <lb/>
            but the better and greater part kept their faith inviolate, or <lb/>
            the human race would then have been wholly destroyed, and <lb/>
            the species could not have continued its generations to the <lb/>
            present period.</p>
          <p>But nature prompted men to utter the various sounds of the <lb/>
            tongue, and convenience drew from them the names of things, <lb/>
            almost in the same manner as inability to use the tongue seems <lb/>
            to excite children to gesture, when it causes them to point <lb/>
            with the finger at objects which are present before them. For <lb/>
            every creature is sensible that it can use its own faculty. <lb/>
            Even before horns are produced on the forehead of a calf, it <lb/>
            butts and pushes fiercely with it when enraged; and the young <lb/>
            of panthers, and whelps of lions, contend with their talons, <lb/>
            and feet, and teeth, when their teeth and talons are yet scarcely <lb/>
            grown. We see, moreover, that the whole race of birds trust <lb/>
            to their wings, and seek a fluttering support from their pinions. <lb/>

            to things, and that men thence learned their first words, is to <lb/>
            think absurdly; for why should this one man be able to dis­ <lb/>

            of the voice, and others not be deemed able to do this at the <lb/>
            same time ? Besides, if others had not also used words among <lb/>
            themselves, whence was the knowledge of them ingrafted in him ? <lb/>
            Whence was power first given to him, that he should under­ <lb/>
            stand, and discern in his mind, what expediency would wish <lb/>
            to effect ? One, likewise, would not be able to compel many, <lb/>
            and oblige them, by force, to submit to learn his names of <lb/>
            things ; nor could he by any means teach, or persuade men <lb/>
            unfitted to listen, what was necessary to be done ; for neither <lb/>
            would they at all bear with patience, or long suffer him to din­ <lb/>
            into their ears, to no purpose, the strange and unintelligible <lb/>
            sounds of his voice.</p>
          <p>Lastly, what is there so wonderful in this matter, if the <lb/>
            human race, whose voice and tongue were in full vigour, dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished various objects by sounds, according to their various <lb/>
            feelings ; when dumb cattle, and even the tribes of wild beasts, <lb/>
            are wont to utter different and distinct cries when terror or <lb/>
            pain affects their hearts, and when joy prevails in them ? For <lb/>
            this you may observe by manifest instances.</p>

          <p>The sun next instructed them to dress their food, and soften <lb/>
            it with the heat of flame; for they saw many things, through­ <lb/>
            out the fields, mollified by the force of his beams and subdued <lb/>
            by his warmth. Hence those who excelled in sense, and had <lb/>
            power of understanding, taught the others, every day more <lb/>
            and more, to change their rude diet,3 and former mode of <lb/>
            life, for new practices and improvements by means of fire.</p>
          <p>At length the leaders began to build cities, and to found <lb/>
            fortresses, as a protection and refuge for themselves. They <lb/>
            also divided the cattle and the fields, and allotted them accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the beauty, and strength, and understanding of each in­ <lb/>
            dividual; for beauty was then much esteemed, and strength <lb/>
            had great influence. Afterwards wealth was introduced, and <lb/>
            gold brought to light, which easily robbed the strong and <lb/>
            beautiful of their honour; for men, however strong, or en­ <lb/>
            dowed with however beautiful a person, generally follow the <lb/>
            party of the richer.</p>
          <p>But to man, whoever governs his life according to true rea­ <lb/>
            son, it is great wealth to live on a little with a contented <lb/>
            mind; for of a little there is no want. Yet men wished <lb/>
            themselves to be honoured and powerful, that their fortune <lb/>
            might rest on a steady foundation, and that themselves, being <note type="footnote"> 1 All the fire in the world.] Ver. 1092.

            strong, might pass an undisturbed life. But this they desired <lb/>
            in vain; for, as they strove to reach the hignest honours, <lb/>
            they rendered the course of their steps full of trouble. And <lb/>
            still, though they attain their object, envy, like a thunderbolt, <lb/>
            hurls them at times from their pre-eminence, and sinks them <lb/>
            with scorn as into the gloom of Tartarus; so that it is far <lb/>
            better to obey in quiet, than to seek to hold states under our <lb/>
            sway, and to manage kingdoms. Let men, therefore, if they <lb/>
            will, sweat out their life's blood,1 wearying themselves to no <lb/>
            purpose, and struggling along the narrow road of ambition; <lb/>
            (for the highest objects, and whatever are more exposed on <lb/>
            eminences,2 are generally sooner scorched with envy as well <lb/>
            as with lightning;) since they gather knowledge only from <lb/>
            the mouths of others, and pursue things rather from what they <lb/>
            hear than from their own judgments. Nor does this folly <lb/>
            prevail more now, or will it prevail more hereafter, than it <lb/>
            has already prevailed in past time.</p>
          <p>Kings, therefore,3 being deposed and slain, the ancient ma­ <lb/>
            jesty of their thrones, and their proud sceptres, lay overthrown <lb/>
            in the dust; and the illustrious ornament of the royal head, <lb/>
            stained with blood beneath the feet of the rabble, mourned <lb/>
            the loss of its supreme honour; for that which has been too <lb/>
            much feared before, is eagerly trodden down.</p>
          <p>Power, accordingly, returned to the lowest dregs and rabble <lb/>
            of mankind, whilst each sought dominion and eminence for <lb/>
            himself. But at length the Miser part taught them to establish <lb/>
            a government, and made lawsfor them, that they might consent <lb/>
            to observe order; for mankind, weary of passing their lives in a <lb/>
            state of violence, were worn out with contentions ; on which <lb/>
            account they fell more submissively under the power of laws <lb/>
            and strict ordinances. For because every one, in his resent­ <lb/>

            is now allowed by equitable laws, men, for this reason. be­ <lb/>

            the fear of punishment poisons the enjoyments of life; for <lb/>
            violence and injury involve every one, and generally recoil <lb/>
            upon the head of him from whom they arose ; nor is it possible <lb/>
            for any one to live a quiet and peaceable life, who violates by <lb/>
            his actions the common bonds of peace. For though his guilt <lb/>
            escape, for a time, the knowledge of both gods and men, yet <lb/>
            he cannot feel sure that it will always be hidden; since many, <lb/>

            all distinguished places;) whence also terror pervades mortals; <lb/>
            a terror which raises new temples of the deities throughout <lb/>
            the whole globe of the earth, and impels men to celebrate their <lb/>
            worship on feast days; it is not so difficult, as it may seem, <lb/>
            to explain.1</p>
          <p>For, in those early times of which we speak, the tribes of <lb/>
            mortals beheld in their minds, even when awake, glorious <lb/>
            images as of gods,2 and saw them, in their sleep, still more dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly, and of a wondrous magnitude of figure. To these, <lb/>
            therefore, they attributed vitality, because they seemed to move <lb/>
            their limbs, and to utter majestic words, suitable to their dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished appearance and mighty strength. And they as­ <lb/>
            signed to them an immortal existence, because their appear­ <lb/>
            ances came-in-constant-succession, and their form remained <lb/>
            the same; although they might certainly have deemed them <lb/>
            immortal on another account? as they would consider that <note type="footnote"> I To explain.] Ver. 1167. Rationem reddere verbis. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Glorious images as of gods.] Ver. 1168. Divôm egregias facies. <lb/>
            This is a most unsatisfactory way of accounting for the first con­ <lb/>
            ception of supernatural beings. " Consistently with his common <lb/>
            doctrine," says Good, " Lucretius imputes the more frequent ap­ <lb/>
            pearance of those heavenly semblances, or rather their being more <lb/>
            frequently perceived by mankind, in those early ages of the world, <lb/>
            to the greater degree of solitude and tranquillity in which life was <lb/>
            then passed." This is, however, not to be found in the passage <lb/>
            before us. Other commentators are silent. </note><note type="footnote"> a Although they might certainly have deemed them immortal on another <lb/>

            beings, endowed with such apparent strength, could not easily <lb/>
            be subdued by any destructive force. And they thought them <lb/>
            pre-eminent in happiness, because the fear of death could thus <lb/>
            trouble none of them, and because, at the same time, they saw <lb/>
            them, in their dreams, do many and wonderful actions, and ex­ <lb/>
            perience, as it seemed, no difficulty in the performance of them.</p>
          <p>Besides, they observed the revolutions of the heavens, and <lb/>
            the various seasons of the year, go round in a certain order, <lb/>
            and yet could not understand by what causes these effects <lb/>
            were produced. They had, then, this resource for themselves, <lb/>
            to ascribe all things to gods, and to make all things be guided <lb/>
            by their will.</p>
          <p>And the seats and abodes1 of these gods they placed in the <lb/>
            sky, because through the sky the night and the moon are seen <lb/>
            to revolve; the moon, I say, the day, and the night, and the <lb/>
            august constellations2 of night, and the nocturnal luminaries <lb/>
            of the heavens, and the flying meteors, as well as the clouds, <lb/>
            the sun, rain, snow, winds, lightnings, hail, and the vehement <lb/>
            noises and loud threatening murmurs of the thunder.</p>
          <p>O unhappy race of men as they attributed such acts, be­ <lb/>
            sides ascribing bitter wrath, to the gods! What lamentations <lb/>
            did they then prepare for themselves, and what sufferings for <lb/>
            us! what fears have they entailed upon our posterity!</p>
          <p>Nor is it any piety for a man to be seen, with his head <lb/>
            veiled, turning towards a stone, and drawing near to every <lb/>
            altar; or to fall prostrate on the ground, and to stretch out <lb/>
            his hands before the shrines of the gods; or to sprinkle the <lb/>
            altars with copious blood of four-footed beasts, and to add <lb/>
            vows to vows; but it is rather piety to be able to contemplate <lb/>
            all things with a serene mind. For when we look up to the <lb/>
            celestial regions of the vast world above, and contemplate the <lb/>
            firmament studded with glittering stars, and reflect upon the <lb/>
            revolutions of the sun and moon, the apprehension lest there <lb/>
            should, perchance, be an almighty power of the gods above <lb/>
            us, which guides the stars in their various motions, begins <lb/>
            then to raise its head, as if awaking, within our breast; an <note type="footnote"> from the suggestion of Wakefield. Other editions have Et manet <lb/>

            apprehension which, perhaps, before lay dormant under the <lb/>
            weight of other cares. Since poverty of reason, and ignor­ <lb/>
            ance of natural causes, disquiet the mind, while it doubts <lb/>
            whether there was any birth or commencement of the world, <lb/>
            or whether there is any limit of time, until which the walls <lb/>
            of the world,1 and the silent movements of the heavenly bodies, <lb/>
            can endure this incessant labour; or whether the heavens, di­ <lb/>
            vinely endowed with an imperishable nature, can, as they roll <lb/>
            along time’s eternal course, defy the mighty power of endless <lb/>
            age.</p>
          <p>Besides, whose heart does not shrink at the terrors of the <lb/>
            gods ? Whose limbs do not shudder with dread, when the <lb/>
            scorched earth trembles with the awful stroke of lightning, <lb/>
            and when the roars of thunder pervade the vast heaven ? Do <lb/>
            not people and nations tremble ? And do not proud monarchs, <lb/>
            penetrated with fear of the deities, recoil in every nerve, lest, <lb/>
            for some foul deed, or arrogant word, the dread time of pay­ <lb/>
            ing penalty be come ?</p>
          <p>When, likewise, the mighty force of a tempestuous wind, <lb/>
            raging over the sea, sweeps athwart the deep the commander <lb/>
            of a fleet with all his powerful legions and elephants,2 does <lb/>
            he not solicit peace of the gods with vows, and timidly im­ <lb/>
            plore them with prayers, for a lull of the winds and a pros­ <lb/>
            perous gale ? But, alas ! he implores them to no purpose; <lb/>
            for, frequently, seized by a violent hurricane, he is neverthe­ <lb/>
            less borne away to the shoals of death. Thus some unseen <lb/>
            power, apparently, bears upon human things, and seems to <lb/>
            trample down proud fasces and cruel axes, and make them <lb/>
            merely a sport for itself.</p>
          <p>Further, when the whole earth totters under our feet, and <lb/>
            cities, shaken to their base, fall or threaten to fall, what wonder <lb/>
            is it, that the nations of the world despise and humble them­ <lb/>
            selves, and admit the vast influence of the gods over the world, <lb/>

            well as heavy silver, and the substance of lead,1 at a time when <lb/>
            fire had consumed mighty forests upon the high mountains, <lb/>
            either from lightning having been hurled upon them, or because <lb/>
            men, warring among themselves in the woods, had set fire to <lb/>
            them for a terror to their enemies; or else because, moved by the <lb/>
            goodness of the soil, they wished to lay open fertile fields, and to <lb/>
            render the country fit for pasturage; or because they sought <lb/>
            to kill the wild beasts, and to enrich themselves with their <lb/>
            spoils. For to catch the game by means of pitfalls and fire, <lb/>
            became a practice before men surrounded the forest with nets, <lb/>
            or roused the animals with dogs.</p>
          <p>However this may be, or from whatever cause the rage of <lb/>
            the fire, with frightful noise, had consumed the woods from <lb/>
            their deepest roots, and had melted the earth with heat, there <lb/>
            flowed from the boiling veins, uniting in the hollow places of <lb/>
            the soil, a stream of silver and gold, as well as of brass and <lb/>
            lead ; which, when they afterwards saw it congealed, and <lb/>
            shining with a bright colour on the ground, they took up, <lb/>
            being attracted by its glittering and smooth lustre; and they <lb/>
            observed that the masses were formed of the same shape as <lb/>
            the figure of the receptacle of each had been. It then occur­ <lb/>
            red to them, that these metals, being melted with heat, might <lb/>
            settle into any form or figure of things, and might also be <lb/>
            fashioned, by beating out, into the sharpest and finest points <lb/>
            of instruments, so that they might make tools for themselves, <lb/>
            and be able both to cut down the woods, and hew timber, <lb/>
            and smooth and polish boards, as well as to pierce, excavate, <lb/>
            and bore.</p>
          <p>These instruments they at first attempted to make of silver <lb/>
            and gold, no less than of the strong substance of hard brass; <lb/>
            but in vain; for the consistence of those metals yielded and <lb/>
            gave way, and both were alike unable to bear severe usage <lb/>

            daily more and more sought, and which, when found, flour­ <lb/>
            ishes among mankind with special praise and wonderful <lb/>
            honour.</p>
          <p>It is now easy for thee to understand of thyself, my Mem­ <lb/>
            mius, how the nature and use of iron were discovered.</p>
          <p>The first weapons of mankind were the hands, nails, and <lb/>
            teeth ; also stones, and branches of trees, the fragments of <lb/>
            the woods; then flame and fire were used, as soon as they <lb/>
            were known; and lastly was discovered the strength of iron <lb/>
            and brass. But the use of brass was known earlier than that <lb/>
            of iron; inasmuch as its substance is more easy to work, and <lb/>
            its abundance greater.2 With brass they turned up the soil <lb/>
            of the earth ; and with brass they excited the tumults of war, <lb/>
            and inflicted deep wounds, and took away the cattle and lands <lb/>
            of their neighbours; for every thing unarmed and defenceless <lb/>
            easily surrendered to those that were armed. Then gradu­ <lb/>
            ally came forth the sword of steel, and the form of the brazen <lb/>
            pruning-hook was turned into contempt. With iron they <lb/>
            began to cleave the ground, and the contests of doubtful war­ <lb/>
            fare were made equal.</p>
          <p>And it appears that man mounted armed upon the back of <lb/>
            a horse, and guided it with reins, and exerted his right hand <lb/>

            than four, or than to mount in full armour on chariots equipped <lb/>
            with scythes. In process of time the Carthaginians taught <lb/>
            fierce elephants,3 with towers on their backs, and with snake- <lb/>

            martial battalions into confusion. Thus sad discord produced <lb/>
            one invention after another, to spread terror in battle among <lb/>
            the tribes of men, and added daily increase to the horrors of <lb/>
            contention.</p>
          <p>They tried bulls, also, in the business of war, and endea­ <lb/>
            voured to impel fierce boars against the enemy. The Parthi­ <lb/>
            ans, too, sent strong lions before them, with armed keepers <lb/>
            and daring guides, to govern them and hold them in chains. <lb/>
            But such attempts were in vain ; for the savage beasts, heated <lb/>
            with tumultuous slaughter, and shaking their terrible manes <lb/>
            on every side, disordered all troops without distinction. Nor <lb/>
            could the riders soothe the spirits of their horses, which were <lb/>
            alarmed at the roaring of the lions, and turn them with the <lb/>
            reins against the enemy. The lions, in their rage, threw <lb/>
            themselves with leaps among the soldiers in every part; they <lb/>
            flew at the faces of those who came against them, and seized <lb/>
            on others from behind unawares, and, clasping them round <lb/>
            about, threw them to the earth sinking under wounds, <lb/>
            clinging to them with their strong teeth and hooked talons. <lb/>
            The bulls tossed their own people, and trampled them under <lb/>
            foot; they gored with their horns the sides of the horses, and <lb/>
            their bellies underneath, and tore up the earth with alarming <lb/>
            fury. But the boars killed their own friends with strong <lb/>
            tusks, staining, in their rage, the broken darts with their <lb/>
            blood, and spread promiscuous destruction among cavalry <lb/>
            and infantry. For though the horses, leaping aside, shunned <lb/>
            the fierce attacks of their teeth, or, rearing up, pawed the air <lb/>
            with their feet, yet they struggled to no purpose; since you <lb/>
            might have seen them sink down hamstrung, and cover the <lb/>
            earth with a heavy fall. Whatever beasts they thought suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently tame at home, they saw, in the heat of action, mad­ <lb/>
            dened with wounds, cries, flight, terror, and tumult. Nor <lb/>
            could they recall any portion of them to order; for all the <lb/>
            different kinds of beasts scattered themselves abroad; as ele­ <lb/>
            phants even now, when imperfectly inured to weapons, flee <lb/>
            hither and thither, after having inflicted much cruel damage <lb/>
            on their masters.</p>
          <p>Thus, and with these views, it is possible that they might <lb/>
            act. But I am scarcely inclined to think that they could not <lb/>
            originally foresee, and consider in their minds, how general <lb/>
            and calamitous an evil such warfare would prove to succeeding <pb n="241"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. V. 1346-1375."/> <lb/>
            times. But they were willing to adopt1 this practice, not so <lb/>
            much with the hope of conquering, as to cause annoyance to <lb/>
            the enemy; and men who distrusted their numbers, and were <lb/>
            without efficient arms, naturally grew desperate, and were <lb/>
            ready to perish themselves, if they might but destroy their op­ <lb/>
            ponents.</p>
          <p>The garment of skins, fastened together, existed before the <lb/>
            woven dress ; the woven succeeded the discovery of iron; for <lb/>
            by iron weaving is performed. Nor, indeed, of any other mate­ <lb/>
            rial can instruments of such smoothness as treadles, spindles, <lb/>
            shuttles, and rattling yarn-beams, be produced.</p>
          <p>And nature obliged men to work in wool before women; <lb/>
            for all the male sex far excel in art, and are much more inge­ <lb/>
            nious than the female. This state of things continued until <lb/>
            the sturdy husbandmen made it a reproach to the workers in <lb/>
            wool; making them consent to resign it to the hands of <lb/>
            women, and themselves to endure hard labour together with <lb/>
            the tillers of the ground, and strengthen their limbs and hands <lb/>
            with severe toil.</p>
          <p>But of sowing and planting,2 and of grafting, nature, the <lb/>
            great producer of all things, was herself the first example and <lb/>
            origin. For berries and acorns that fell from the trees, ex­ <lb/>
            hibited, in the proper season, a crop of seedlings underneath ; <lb/>
            from observing which they also ventured to intrust slips to <lb/>
            the boughs, and to plant young stocks throughout the fields.</p>
          <p>They then tried different methods of tilling the kindly <lb/>
            soil, and saw wild fruits become improved in their lands by <lb/>
            being cherished and indulgently cultivated. And they com­ <lb/>
            pelled the woods to withdraw daily farther up the mountains, <lb/>
            and to give room below for tillage; so that they might have <lb/>
            meadows, lakes, rivulets, corn-fields, and rich vineyards <lb/>
            throughout the hills and plains, and that a green tract of <lb/>
            olives, marking the ground, might run between other trees, <lb/>
            stretching far over the heights, and valleys, and plains; as <lb/>

            which, intersected with rows of dulcet apples, men lay out <lb/>
            and adorn, and which they keep planted around with other <lb/>
            fruit trees.</p>
          <p>But to imitate with the mouth the liquid voices of birds1 <lb/>
            was practised long before men could play melodious tunes, <lb/>
            and delight the ear with music. The whistling of the zephyr <lb/>
            through the empty reeds first taught the rustics to blow <lb/>
            through hollow stalks. Then by degrees they learned the <lb/>
            sweet plaintive notes, which the pipe, pressed by the fingers <lb/>
            of the players, pours forth; the pipe, which is now found <lb/>
            through all the pathless groves, and woods, and glades, <lb/>
            through the solitary haunts, and divine resting-places,2 of the <lb/>
            shepherds.</p>
          <p>Thus time by degrees suggests every discovery, and skill <lb/>
            evolves it into the regions of light and fame.</p>
          <p>These melodies softened the hearts of those swains, and de­ <lb/>
            lighted them when they were satisfied with food; for then <lb/>
            every thing affords pleasure.</p>
          <p>Oftentimes, therefore, stretched upon the soft grass, near a <lb/>
            rivulet of water, under the boughs of a high tree, they socially, <lb/>
            though with no great wealth, gratified their senses with <lb/>
            pleasure, especially when the weather smiled upon them, and <lb/>
            the seasons of the year painted the green herbage with flowers. <lb/>
            Then jests, and pleasant talk, and agreeable laughter, were <lb/>
            wont to be enjoyed; for then the rustic muse had full vigour <lb/>
            and influence. Then sportive gaiety prompted them to deck <lb/>
            their heads and shoulders with garlands of flowers and leaves, <lb/>
            and to stand forth in irregular dances, moving their limbs <lb/>
            stiffly, and to stamp on mother earth with heavy foot; whence <lb/>
            arose smiles and jocund laughter, because all these exhibitions <lb/>
            had then greater effect, as being new and wonderful. Hence <note type="footnote"> I But to imitate-voices of birds, &amp;c.] Ver. 1378. He says that <lb/>

            they were sub dio; or whether he uses the epithet in some other <lb/>
            sense. The commentators give no opinion, except that Creech, in <lb/>

            to produce various modulations of voice, and to weave tunes, and <lb/>
            to run over the reeds with compressed lips, were compensations <lb/>
            for want of sleep, as they watched during the night. From <lb/>
            whom, also the men of the present day, wakeful in nocturnal <lb/>
            orgies, have received and maintain the same practices,1 and <lb/>
            have learned to preserve regularity of numbers ; and yet they <lb/>
            do not, even now, enjoy their amusement with greater delight <lb/>
            than that which the sylvan sons of earth then experienced.</p>
          <p>For that gratification which is present, if we have pre. <lb/>
            viously known nothing more agreeable, delights us pre-emi­ <lb/>
            nently, and seems to be superior to every thing else; but any <lb/>
            thing better, which is discovered afterwards, blunts and alters <lb/>
            our feelings as to all we enjoyed before. Thus dislike of <lb/>
            acorns came upon mankind; thus those ancient beds, formed <lb/>
            of grass and leaves, were abandoned. Skins, too, and the <lb/>
            savage dress, fell into contempt; a dress of which I can <lb/>
            imagine the discovery to have excited such envy,2 that he who <lb/>
            first wore it, possibly died from a treacherous-combination <lb/>
            against him; and that his garment, being torn, with much <lb/>
            bloodshed, among those who slew him, was at last spoiled, and <lb/>
            rendered incapable of being used.</p>
          <p>In those days skins, in these gold and purple, disturb the <lb/>
            life of men with cares, and harass it with war. In which re­ <lb/>
            gard, as I think, blame has fallen far more justly on us than <lb/>
            on them. For cold tormented the uncovered children of earth, <lb/>
            when they were without skins ; but to be destitute of a purple <lb/>
            garment, adorned with gold and cumbrous figures, causes no in­ <lb/>
            convenience to us, provided that we have, instead of it, a com­ <lb/>
            mon dress that may defend us against the weather. The <lb/>
            human race, accordingly, labour perpetually in vain and to no <lb/>
            purpose, and consume their life in empty cares; evidently <lb/>
            because they do not know what is the proper limit to acquisi­ <lb/>

            speaks of " compensations for want of sleep," I have followed Wake­ <lb/>

            has gradually carried them into a sea of evils, and thorough­ <lb/>
            ly aroused the mighty tumults of war.</p>
          <p>But the wakeful and untiring sun and moon, that illumine <lb/>
            with their light the vast revolving region of the heaven, taught <lb/>
            mankind that the seasons of the year proceed, and that every <lb/>
            thing is carried on, by a certain Jaw and in a certain order.</p>
          <p>They afterwards passed their lives defended with strong <lb/>
            fortresses, and the earth, divided and marked out, was culti­ <lb/>
            vated and peopled.</p>
          <p>The sea was next covered with ships for the sake of per­ <lb/>
            fumes.1 Men had auxiliaries and allies, with settled treaties. <lb/>
            The poets now began to hand down great deeds in their poems; <lb/>
            letters had only a short time before been discovered. Hence <lb/>
            our age cannot trace what previously occurred, except so far <lb/>
            as reason gives indications.</p>
          <p>Ships, and the culture of land, walls of cities, laws, arms, <lb/>
            roads, garments, and other things of this kind ; all the bless­ <lb/>

            wrought statues, improving use,2 and the experience of the <lb/>
            active mind, proceeding step by step, taught all mankind <lb/>
            gradually to adopt.</p>
          <p>Thus time by degrees suggests every discovery, and skill <lb/>
            evolves it into the regions of light and celebrity. Thus, in <lb/>
            the various arts, we see that different inventions proceed from <lb/>

          <p>IN early days, Athens, of illustrious name, first communi­ <lb/>
            cated to suffering mortals the method of producing corn ; <lb/>
            Athens, also, first improved life, and established laws; Athens, <lb/>
            moreover, first afforded sweet consolations of existence, when <lb/>
            she gave birth to that pre-eminent MAN, endowed with such <lb/>
            mighty genius, who once poured forth instruction on all sub­ <lb/>
            jects from his truth-speaking mouth; and whose fame, spread <lb/>
            abroad of old on account of his discoveries, is raised, since <lb/>
            his death, even to the skies.</p>
          <p>For when he observed that almost all things, which neces­ <lb/>
            sity requires for subsistence, and by which mankind may <lb/>
            render life free from care, are already prepared for them by <lb/>
            nature, yet saw that men may abound in wealth, may be <lb/>
            crowned with honour and applause, and may have pride in <lb/>
            the good fame of their children, but that, notwithstanding, <lb/>
            there may be griefs in the heart of each at home, and each <lb/>
            may disquiet life with unhappy querulousness of mind, he <lb/>
            understood, at once, the cause which compels them to lament <lb/>
            with such troublesome complaints; he perceived that the vessel <lb/>
            itself was in fault, and that all good things which were collected <lb/>
            and brought into it from abroad, were spoiled by its imperfection <lb/>
            within; he was convinced of this, partly because he saw that <lb/>
            it was unsound and perforated, so that it could never by any <lb/>

            showed the way, in a narrow track, by which we may in a <lb/>

            sorrowful tumults of care. For as children tremble,1 and <lb/>
            fear every thing in thick darkness, so we, in the light, fear <lb/>
            sometimes things which are not more to be feared than those <lb/>
            which children dread, and imagine about to happen, in the <lb/>

            the contemplation of nature and the exercise of reason. For <lb/>

            der, because the clouds in the air, as they fly along on high, <lb/>
            when winds are opposed to each other, meet together in collision. <lb/>
            For in a clear part of the sky no noise takes place. But the <lb/>
            more densely the clouds are collected, in any quarter whatso­ <lb/>
            ever, with so much louder a noise does the thunder frequently <lb/>
            proceed from that quarter.</p>
          <p>The clouds, too, it is to be observed, can neither be of so <lb/>
            dense a substance as stones and wood are; nor again, of so <lb/>
            subtle a consistence as flying mists and smoke are. For, in the <lb/>
            one case, they would either fall, being brought down by their <lb/>
            own dead weight, or, in the other, they would, like smoke, be <lb/>
            unable to keep together, or to retain within them the cold snows <lb/>
            and showers of hail.</p>
          <p>Clouds also produce a sound,1 by certain motions, athwart <lb/>
            the regions of the open sky, as canvass, stretched over the <lb/>
            large theatres, makes a noise when it is tossed about among <lb/>
            the posts and beams. Sometimes a cloud is ruffled and torn <lb/>
            in pieces by boisterous winds, and then imitates the rattling <lb/>
            noise of paper; for that kind of crackling you may also ob­ <lb/>
            serve in thunder. Or it sounds as when the winds shake <lb/>
            with their blasts a hanging garment, or flying sheets of parch­ <lb/>
            ment, and rattle them in the air.</p>
          <p>It sometimes happens, moreover, that clouds cannot so <lb/>
            much come into collision front to front, as meet side to side, <lb/>
            rubbing their masses slowly against one another, with various <lb/>
            movements; whence that dry kind of sound, which you may <lb/>
            sometimes observe, strikes upon the ear, and which is pro­ <lb/>
            tracted for some time, until the clouds have escaped from the <lb/>
            confined space.</p>
          <p>Thus too, not unfrequently, all things around, convulsed <lb/>
            with violent thunder, seem to tremble, and the mighty walls <lb/>
            of the capacious world appear at once to have started and <lb/>
            burst asunder; and this happens when a collected body of <lb/>
            strong wind has suddenly involved itself within a cloud, and, <lb/>
            being shut up there, forces the cloud, (as the whirling air <note type="footnote"> 1 Clouds also produce a sound, &amp;c.] Ver. 108. Dant etiam sonitum, <lb/>
            &amp;c. Lucretius, and those of his school, had certainly extravagant <lb/>
            notions respecting clouds. In this passage he expresses his opinion <lb/>
            that a cloud may make a noise like canvass flapping or splitting, <lb/>
            and, a little below, (ver. 150, seq.,) says that a cloud may be burned <lb/>
            up, and produce a crackling, like leaves of laurel. Yet he seems in <lb/>
            general to have thought that clouds were mists: see ver. 495, seq. </note> <pb n="251"/>

            stretches it more and more in all directions,) to become hollow, <lb/>
            but with a thick crust round the cavity. Afterwards, when <lb/>
            the strong force and spirit of the wind within has fermented, <lb/>
            it at length, being emitted from confinement, gives a crack, <lb/>
            with a frightfully-crashing sound. Nor is this surprising, <lb/>
            when a small bladder, filled with air, often produces, if sud­ <lb/>
            denly burst, a loud sound of a similar kind.</p>
          <p>There is also another reason why the winds, when they <lb/>
            blow among the clouds, may produce a sound; for we often <lb/>
            see branched and rough clouds carried about in the air in <lb/>
            various directions. So that such a noise may arise in the <lb/>
            clouds as when the north-west gales blow through a thick wood, <lb/>
            and the leaves make a rustling and the boughs crackle.</p>
          <p>It happens, likewise, at times, that the vehement force of a <lb/>
            strong blast tears a cloud asunder, cleaving it through with a <lb/>
            straight-forward assault. For what the wind may effect in the <lb/>
            sky, manifest experience demonstrates on the earth, where, <lb/>
            though it is less violent, it often overthrows and tears up lofty <lb/>
            woods from their lowest roots.</p>
          <p>There are also waves in the clouds, which, breaking hea­ <lb/>
            vily, make a murmuring noise; such as is likewise excited <lb/>
            in deep rivers, and in the vast sea, when it is broken and <lb/>
            rages with the tide.</p>
          <p>It occurs, moreover, that when the burning violence of <lb/>
            lightning passes from one cloud into another, the second cloud, <lb/>
            if it receives the fire into a large body of moisture, imme­ <lb/>
            diately extinguishes it with a loud noise; as hot iron, taken <lb/>
            from a glowing furnace, hisses when we plunge it into the <lb/>
            cold water standing near.</p>
          <p>Further, if a cloud, which is more dry than ordinary, re­ <lb/>
            ceives the lightning, it is at once set on fire, and scorched up <lb/>
            with a loud sound; such as is heard if a flame, on any occa­ <lb/>
            sion, spreads over hills covered with laurel, burning it up <lb/>
            with great fury, and impelled by a storm of wind. Nor does <lb/>
            any substance burn with a more startling sound, as the flame <lb/>
            crackles among its boughs, than the Delphic laurel of Phœbus.</p>
          <p>In addition, we may observe that a great crashing of ice, <lb/>
            and fall of hail, among the vast clouds in the sky, frequently <lb/>
            produce a loud sound. For masses of cloud, closely con­ <lb/>
            densed, and mixed with hail, are, when the wind compresses <lb/>
            them, shattered and broken to pieces.</p><pb n="252"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. VI. 160-184"/>
          <p>It lightens, also, when the clouds, by their collision, have <lb/>
            struck out numerous atoms of fire; just as if a stone strikes <lb/>
            another stone, or a piece of iron; for then, in like manner, a <lb/>
            light bursts forth, and scatters abroad bright sparks of fire.</p>
          <p>But it always happens that we hear the sound of the thun­ <lb/>
            der some time after we perceive it lighten,1 because objects, <lb/>
            which affect the hearing, always come more slowly to the ears, <lb/>
            than those, which affect the sight, arrive at the eye. This you <lb/>
            may easily understand from the following instance. If you <lb/>
            observe a man at a distance cutting down the trunk of a tree <lb/>
            with an axe, you will see the stroke itself before the noise of <lb/>
            the stroke makes any sound in the air. So, too, we see the <lb/>
            lightning before we hear the thunder, which, however, is <lb/>
            emitted at the same time with the flash, and produced from <lb/>
            the same collision of the clouds.</p>
          <p>Clouds, likewise, sometimes tinge the parts around with <lb/>
            swiftly-diffused light, and the storm gleams with tremulous <lb/>
            ardour, from the following cause: when wind has penetrated <lb/>
            a cloud, and, rolling about within it, has made the cloud (as <lb/>
            I showed above) become hollow in the middle, and condensed <lb/>
            round about, it acquires heat by its own activity, as you see <lb/>
            all bodies glow when made warm by motion; and a ball of <lb/>
            lead, from being whirled2 through a long space, even melts. <lb/>
            This hot wind, accordingly, when it has burst a dark cloud, <lb/>
            suddenly scatters atoms of heat, which are, as it were, driven <lb/>
            out by its violence, and which cause the vibrating gleams of <lb/>
            the lightning. Then follows the noise, which affects the ear <lb/>
            more slowly than the beams which come to our eyes3 strike <note type="footnote"> I But—we hear the sound of the thunder some time after we perceive <lb/>

            true reason is, that the appearances of visible objects are always <lb/>

            them. This, you will understand, takes place when the clouds <lb/>
            are condensed, and when they are piled, at the same time, <lb/>
            high above one another, with extraordinary effect.1</p>
          <p>And do not be misled by the circumstance, that we, from <lb/>
            below, see more plainly how broad the clouds are, than how <lb/>
            high they are built up. For observe their appearance, when <lb/>
            the winds will carry these clouds, resembling great mountains, <lb/>
            along through the air; or when you shall see, on the sides of <lb/>
            high hills, some clouds piled upon others, and those placed in <lb/>
            the upper region, while the winds are buried in repose, press­ <lb/>
            ing down those in the lower; and you will then be able to <lb/>
            comprehend their vastness of bulk, and observe the caverns <lb/>
            within them, which are formed as it were of hanging rocks; <lb/>
            and when the winds, at the rising of a tempest, have filled <lb/>
            them, the winds themselves, being thus confined within the <lb/>
            clouds, complain with a loud murmuring, and utter threats <lb/>
            like wild beasts in dens. Sometimes they send their roarings <lb/>
            in one direction, and sometimes in another, through the clouds, <lb/>
            and, seeking an outlet, turn themselves about, and roll to­ <lb/>
            gether atoms of fire from the cloudy-masses; and thus they <lb/>
            collect many igneous particles, and whirl about the flames <lb/>
            within as in hollow furnaces, until, the cloud having burst, <lb/>
            they dart forth with a flash.</p>
          <p>From this cause, also, it happens, that that gleaming golden <lb/>
            colour of liquid fire flies down upon the earth; inasmuch as <lb/>
            the clouds themselves must of necessity contain many atoms <lb/>
            of fire ; as, when they are without any moisture, their colour <lb/>
            is generally fiery and shining. For they must receive many <lb/>
            igneous particles from the light of the sun, so that they na­ <lb/>
            turally look red, and send forth fire. When, therefore, the <lb/>
            wind, driving them along, has thrust, compressed, and con­ <lb/>
            densed them into one place, they pour forth the atoms offire, <lb/>
            which are squeezed out, and which cause the colour of flame <lb/>
            to shine through the sky.</p>
          <p>It likewise lightens when the clouds in heaven are rare­ <lb/>
            fied. For when the wind gently divides and attenuates them <lb/>
            as they pass, those atoms, which cause the lightning, must <lb/>
            fall even in spite of them; and then it lightens without any <lb/>
            great terror, or sounds, or commotion. <note type="footnote"> I With extraordinary effect.] Ver. 186. Impete miro. " That is, <lb/>

          <p>Of what nature, moreover,1 the lightning consists, its strokes, <lb/>
            and the signs and marks which are burnt into objects by its <lb/>
            fire, and which exhale a strong scent of sulphur, sufficiently <lb/>
            indicate. For these are tokens of fire, and not of wind or <lb/>
            rain.</p>
          <p>Besides, lightnings often set on fire the roofs of houses, and <lb/>
            revel with a swift flame throughout houses themselves. For <lb/>
            nature has formed this attenuated fire, you may be sure,2 of <lb/>
            the most minute particles of flame, and with the subtlest mo­ <lb/>
            tions and atoms, so that nothing whatever can resist it. Pow­ <lb/>
            erful lightning, indeed, passes through the walls of houses like <lb/>
            sounds and voices; it passes through stones and brass, and <lb/>
            melts brass and gold in a moment. It causes wine, also, <lb/>
            to flow out suddenly from vessels which still remain entire; <lb/>
            because, as is evident, its heat, at its contact, easily relaxes <lb/>
            and expands all the earthen-substance of the vessel ;3 so that, <lb/>
            penetrating into the liquid itself, it actively separates and dis­ <lb/>
            pels the atoms of the wine; agitating it with its flashing heat <lb/>
            to a degree which the warmth of the sun seems unable to pro­ <lb/>

            fluence oflightning.</p>
          <p>How these lightnings are generated, and become possessed <lb/>

            whole herds of cattle at once; and with what power they can <lb/>
            effect all other things of this kind, I will now proceed to ex­ <lb/>
            plain, nor will I delay you longer with promises.1</p>
          <p>It must be admitted that lightnings are produced from <lb/>
            clouds that are dense, and piled high in the air; for none are <lb/>
            ever emitted from a clear sky, or from clouds that are but thinly <lb/>
            collected. For doubtless manifest observation shows this to <lb/>
            be the case; because, at the time when thunder is heard, the <lb/>
            clouds are condensed from all sides through the whole atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere, so that we might suppose all the darkness to have left <lb/>
            Acheron, and to have filled the immense vault of heaven; so <lb/>
            formidably, when the dire gloom of storms has collected, and <lb/>
            when the tempest begins to forge its thunderbolts, does the <lb/>
            face of black terror impend over the earth from above.</p>
          <p>Over the sea, too, very frequently, a black stormy cloud, <lb/>
            like a flood of pitch flowing down from heaven, so terribly <lb/>
            descends upon the waters, and rolls onward in such thick <lb/>
            darkness, and draws with it a black tempest so pregnant with <lb/>
            thunder and hurricanes, (being charged, too, to the utmost with <lb/>
            fire and wind,) that even men upon land shudder and seek <lb/>
            shelter in their houses. Thus, therefore, we must believe that <lb/>
            tempestuous-clouds rise high above our heads; for neither <lb/>
            could clouds overwhelm the earth with such thick darkness, <lb/>
            (the sun being wholly obscured,) unless they were built up, <lb/>
            numbers upon numbers, to a great height; nor could they, <lb/>
            when descending in rain, deluge the earth with such vast <lb/>
            showers, as to make the rivers overflow, and the plains a sheet <lb/>
            of water, unless the atmosphere contained clouds ranged high <lb/>
            over one another.</p>
          <p>In the air, therefore, at the time of storms, all parts of the <lb/>
            clouds are replete with wind and fire; and thus thunders and <lb/>
            lightnings are produced. For I have shown above that the <lb/>
            hollow clouds must contain many atoms of heat; and they <lb/>
            must also of necessity receive many from the rays and warmth <lb/>
            of the sun. Thus, when the same wind, which has collected <lb/>
            the clouds by chance into any one place, has elicited from them <note type="footnote"> I Delay you longer with promises.] Ver. 245. Neque te in pro­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. VI. 275-297"/> <lb/>
            many atoms of heat, and with that heat has mingled itself, <lb/>
            the vortex of ''ind, compressed within the cloud, whirls itself <lb/>
            about in it, and sharpens the lightning, as in a hot furnace, <lb/>
            within its depths. For this wind is heated in two ways; it <lb/>
            both grows warm by its own motion, and by the contact of fire. <lb/>
            Then, when the substance of the wind has grown hot of itself, <lb/>
            or the strong influence of fire has excited it, the lightning, <lb/>
            being ripe as it were, bursts suddenly through the cloud, and <lb/>
            the fiery gleam is roused and driven forth,1 illumining all <lb/>
            places with vibrating light; close upon which follows the <lb/>
            awful crash2 of thunder, so that the regions of heaven above <lb/>
            seem suddenly to be disruptured, and to totter. Tremor <lb/>
            then violently pervades the earth, and murmurs run along the <lb/>
            lofty skies; for almost all the stormy air then trembles with <lb/>
            the shock, and loud noises are sent forth; after which concus­ <lb/>
            sion follows heavy and abundant rain, so that the whole sky <lb/>
            seems to be turned into showers, and thus, falling precipitately, <lb/>
            to excite the waters to a new deluge.3 So mighty a sound issues <lb/>
            forth from the displosion of a cloud, and from a tempest of <lb/>
            wind, when the lightning flies abroad with its burning impetus.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, too,4 the vehement force of the wind falls upon <lb/>
            a dense cloud externally, striking on its summit just ripe for <lb/>
            explosion;5 and, when it has burst through it, there flies out <lb/>

            call lightning. And this is not confined to one point only, <lb/>
            but extends to other parts, wheresoever the force of the wind <lb/>
            has diffused itself.</p>
          <p>It happens at times, also, that a furious wind, though issu­ <lb/>
            ing forth without fire, yet ignites as it goes, in a long space, <lb/>
            and protracted flight; losing, too, in its course, some of those <lb/>
            larger atoms which cannot penetrate through the air equally <lb/>
            with the smaller; and collecting from the air itself, as it flies <lb/>
            through it, some of those minute particles which, when mixed, <lb/>
            generate fire; almost in the same manner as a ball of lead <lb/>
            very frequently grows hot in its course, when, throwing off <lb/>
            many atoms of cold, it conceives heat in the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>It occurs, moreover, that the force of a mere stroke excites <lb/>
            fire in a cloud, when a cold blast of wind, darting forth with­ <lb/>
            out any fire at all, has struck upon it; because as is evident, <lb/>
            when the wind has dashed against the cloud with a violent <lb/>
            impetus, atoms of heat may flow both from the wind itself, <lb/>
            and also from that cloudy substance which then receives its <lb/>
            impact; just as fire flies out when we strike a stone with <lb/>
            iron; nor, because the substance of iron is cold, do those par­ <lb/>
            ticles of igneous brightness the less, on that account, flow <lb/>
            together at the stroke. Thus any substance, likewise, must <lb/>
            naturally be kindled by lightning, if it be adapted and dis­ <lb/>
            posed to take fire. Nor can the substance of the wind be <lb/>
            easily supposed to be altogether cold, considering its rapid <lb/>
            flight from the parts whence it was so forcibly discharged <lb/>
            from above;1 for though it be not kindled by heat in its <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύφων</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκνεφίας</foreign>.” Lambinus. By these words the Greeks meant <lb/>
            a hurricane, or perhaps sometimes the wind that produces a water- <lb/>
            spout. See Plin. N. H. ii. 48, 99. Sen. Nat. Quæst. v. 12. It is <lb/>
            apparent therefore that Lucretius means a fiery wind or hurricane, <lb/>
            but I have thought it better to retain vortex in the English. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Whence it was so forcibly discharged from above.] Ver. 317. <lb/>
            Nec temere omnino plank vis frigida venti <lb/>
            Esse potest: ex quo tantâ vi missa superne est. <lb/>
            Lambinus explains ex quo by ex quo tempore, or ex quo loco, giving <lb/>
            this turn to the passage : We can hardly suppose the wind itself <lb/>
            to be quite cold when it strikes the cloud, if we reflect on the dis­ <lb/>
            tance from which it came, and the rapidity of its descent.—Creech <lb/>
            interprets, " cum tanto impetu è nubibus emittitur,” as if he thought <lb/>
            that ex quo might be taken in the sense of cùm or propterea quod a <lb/>
            sense which it will, perhaps, bear. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. VI. 322—349."/> <lb/>
            descent before it arrives in these lower regions, it yet comes <lb/>
            to them tepid and mixed with warmth.</p>
          <p>But the activity and impulse of the lightning are so great <lb/>
            as you observe them to be, and the thunderbolts in general <lb/>
            fly with so swift a descent, because the force of the wind, <lb/>
            when roused, first collects itself fully within the clouds, and <lb/>
            makes a great struggle to issue forth. Then, when the cloud <lb/>
            can no longer restrain the increased-violence of its efforts, its <lb/>
            fury bursts out, and flies, accordingly, with wonderful impe­ <lb/>
            tus, like darts which are hurled from powerful engines.</p>
          <p>Add to this, that it consists of small and smooth particles; <lb/>
            nor is it easy for any body to withstand so subtle a substance; <lb/>
            for it winds and penetrates through the most minute pas­ <lb/>
            sages. It is not, therefore, checked or delayed1 by many <lb/>
            obstacles, and it accordingly flies and spreads with the most <lb/>
            active swiftness.</p>
          <p>Consider, further, that all bodies universally tend down­ <lb/>
            wards by nature; and that, when an impulse is added, the <lb/>
            swiftness is doubled, and the force aggravated; so that what­ <lb/>
            ever obstacles oppose its power, it but the sooner and more <lb/>
            vigorously scatters them with a stroke, and pursues its own <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <p>Besides, that which comes to the earth with a long flight, <lb/>
            must acquire speed; which continually increases2 by progres­ <lb/>
            sion, and augments its vehement impetus, and gives force to <lb/>
            its stroke. For its velocity causes whatever atoms there are <lb/>
            in the body, to be borne forward,3 as it were, straight to <lb/>
            one point, combining them all, as they roll on, in that single <lb/>
            direction.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the lightning, too, may, in its passage through the <lb/>
            sky, attract to itself certain particles from the air, which may <lb/>
            increase the violence of its strokes.</p>
          <p>And it passes through substances that remain uninjured, <lb/>
            and penetrates many objects that continue unaltered, because <note type="footnote"> I It is not, therefore, checked or delayed.] Ver. 333. Non—in <lb/>

            autumn, and when the flowery season of spring displays it­ <lb/>
            self, more than at other times. For in winter heat is deficient; <lb/>
            and in summer the winds fail, and the clouds are not of so <lb/>
            dense a consistence. But when the seasons of the year are <lb/>
            between the two, all the various causes of thunder then con­ <lb/>
            cur. For the intermediate-portion of the year2 blends the <lb/>
            cold and the heat, both of which are necessary to produce <lb/>
            thunder for us; so that, for the generation of it, there may be <lb/>
            a discord in things, and that the atmosphere, raging with heat <lb/>
            and wind, may be agitated with a vast tumult. For the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of summer, and the end of winter, is the season of <lb/>
            spring; from which cause the two dissimilar natures, heat and <lb/>
            cold, must at that time jar with one another, and produce a <lb/>
            commotion as they mingle. And the termination of summer <lb/>
            comes on, meeting the commencement of winter; at a time <lb/>
            which is called the season of autumn; and then, too, violent <lb/>
            colds contend with violent heats. These seasons may, there­ <lb/>
            fore, be styled the WAR-TIMES OF THE YEAR.3 Nor is it <lb/>
            wonderful if, at these conjunctures, much thunder-and-light­ <lb/>

            penetrated through walled apartments, and how, having exer­ <lb/>
            cised its power, it has extricated itself from them; or what <lb/>
            injury the stroke of a bolt from heaven can inflict.</p>
          <p>But if Jupiter, and the other gods, shake the shining re­ <lb/>

          <p>Why, also, if the gods hurl thunderbolts at men, do they <lb/>

            thunder-strokes are discharged on the earth at the same mo­ <lb/>

          <p>Moreover, why does he shatter the sacred temples3 of the <lb/>

            the sea. For it sometimes happens that they drop, like a <lb/>
            column let down, from the sky into the ocean ; around which <lb/>
            column the waters boil, being excited by violent blasts of wind; <lb/>
            and whatever vessels are then caught in that vortex, are tossed <lb/>
            about, and incur the greatest danger. This occurs, when <lb/>
            (as is at times the case) the impetuous force of the wind is <lb/>
            not able to burst a cloud of which it has taken possession, but <lb/>
            bears it down, so that it becomes, by degrees, like a pillar <lb/>
            reaching from the heaven into the sea; as if something were <lb/>
            thrust down from above with a hand, and the force of an arm, <lb/>
            and stretched into the waters. Hence, when the fury of the <lb/>
            wind has burst the cloud, it rushes forth into the sea, and ex­ <lb/>
            cites an extraordinary agitation among the waves. For the <lb/>
            blast descends as a rolling whirlwind, and brings down with <lb/>
            it the cloud, which is of a yielding substance, and not easy to <lb/>
            be disruptured; and when it has once thrust the heavy body <lb/>
            of the cloud into the water of the ocean, it suddenly plunges <lb/>
            itself wholly into the waves, and disturbs all the sea with a <lb/>
            mighty noise, forcing it to boil with agitation.</p>
          <p>It happens also, at times, that a vortex of wind1 involves <lb/>
            itself in clouds, gathering up cloudy atoms from the air, and <lb/>
            imitates as it were a PRESTER sent down from heaven. When <lb/>
            this vortex has descended to the earth, and has burst, it vomits <lb/>
            forth, and tempests abroad,2 the impetuous fury of a whirl­ <lb/>
            wind. But such a vortex, because it is formed but seldom, <note type="footnote"> cretins means a hot or fiery wind, involved in a cloud, which it de­ <lb/>
            pressed towards the earth. If, in its descent, it alighted on the sea, <lb/>
            it produced what we call a water-spout; if it came down on the land, <lb/>
            it was a whirlwind. This was the doctrine of Epicurus: see Diog. <lb/>
            Laert. x. 104. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρηστὴρ</foreign> might, however, burst from the cloud, <lb/>
            and scorch or burn any object. Thus, in Xen. Hell. i. 3, 1, it is <lb/>

            appears more commonly in the wide prospect and open atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere over the sea.</p>
          <p>Clouds are formed, when many atoms of a rough and hooked <lb/>
            nature, flying in the higher region of the heaven above us, <lb/>
            have suddenly come together and combined; atoms which, <lb/>
            though attached only in a slight degree, may yet be held <lb/>
            united in a body. These first cause small clouds to gather; <lb/>
            those small clouds then unite1 and are combined with one <lb/>
            another, and, as they join, swell and are carried along by the <lb/>
            winds with such violence, that at length a raging tempest <lb/>
            arises.2</p>
          <p>It occurs, too, that the nearer to any part of the sky the <lb/>
            elevated summits of hills are, so much the more constantly do <lb/>
            they smoke, as it were, with the thick mist of a yellow cloud ;3 <lb/>
            because, when the clouds first gather, and before the eye can <lb/>
            discern their thin substance, the winds, carrying them off, col­ <lb/>
            lect them on the highest tops of the hills. Here at last it <lb/>
            happens, that, when a larger collection is formed, one dense <lb/>
            and solid cloud seems both to show itself and to rise at the <lb/>
            same time from the summit of the hills into the clear sky. <lb/>
            For the nature of the ground itself, and our own perceptions <lb/>
            as we climb high mountains, demonstrate that breezy emi­ <lb/>
            nences 4 are open to the ascent of exhalations.</p>
          <p>Besides, that nature raises many atoms of vapour from the <lb/>
            whole surface of the ocean, garments suspended upon the shore <lb/>
            testify ; inasmuch as they contract and retain moisture.5 To <lb/>
            augment the clouds, therefore, many atoms seem likely to <lb/>
            arise from the motion of the salt water; for the nature and <lb/>
            action of all waters is similar. <note type="footnote"> 1 Those small clouds then unite.] Ver. 456. Inde ea comprendunt <lb/>

            cover the sky with obscurity, and, uniting together by de­ <lb/>
            grees, form clouds high in the air. For the influence1 of the <lb/>

          <p>It is possible, likewise, that to this assemblage of clouds2 <lb/>

            scend upon the earth. In the first place I shall observer that <lb/>
            many atoms of moisture arise, together with the clouds them­ <lb/>
            selves,2 from all things on the earth, and that both these sub­ <lb/>

            clouds, increase together, in the same manner as our body <lb/>

            other moisture, which are diffused throughout the limbs, are <lb/>
            augmented together with them. The clouds, too, when the wind <lb/>
            drives them over the wide sea, frequently attract much mois­ <lb/>
            ture from the salt water, like fleeces of wool suspended in the <lb/>
            air. In like manner moisture is raised from all rivers into the <lb/>
            clouds; where, when numerous particles of water have in <lb/>
            many ways collected, and have been augmented from every <lb/>
            quarter, the swollen clouds strive for two reasons to discharge <lb/>
            themselves; for the force of the wind presses them ; and the <lb/>
            mass of clouds itself, when a greater body than ordinary has <lb/>
            united, urges and weighs them down from above, and makes <lb/>
            the rain flow forth upon the earth.</p>
          <p>Moreover, when the clouds are rarefied by the wind, or when <lb/>
            they are dissolved by the influence of the sun's heat from <lb/>
            above, they forthwith discharge rain; their moisture distilling <lb/>
            as wax,3 thoroughly melted, drops over a strong fire.</p>
          <p>But violent rain takes place, when the clouds are vehe­ <lb/>
            mently urged by both forces; being densely heaped upon one <lb/>
            another, and pressed by the impetuosity of the wind.</p>

            a considerable period, when many particles of moisture flow <lb/>

            rivers; all these, though numerous, it is yet very easy to un­ <lb/>
            derstand, and to comprehend how they are produced, and <lb/>
            from what cause they arise, when you have thoroughly learned <lb/>
            what virtues and qualities belong to the atoms which constitute <lb/>
            their substance.</p>
          <p>Give me now your attention further, and learn what is the <lb/>
            cause of earthquakes.2 And first, suppose the earth to be <lb/>
            below, as it is above, filled in every part with airy caverns, <lb/>
            and containing also, in its bosom, many lakes and many pools, <lb/>
            as well as stones and fissured rocks; while you must likewise <lb/>
            suppose that it rolls along forcibly, beneath the surface of the <lb/>
            soil, many hidden rivers, floods, and submerged rocks; for <lb/>
            nature herself requires that the earth be similar to itself <lb/>
            throughout.</p>
          <p>These points, then, being laid down and admitted, the earth <lb/>
            quakes on the surface, when it is shaken by great falls of sub­ <lb/>
            stances beneath, as when age brings down vast caverns; for <lb/>
            then whole mountains sink, and, from the violent shock, trem­ <lb/>
            bUngs spread far and wide in a moment; an effect which we <lb/>
            may naturally imagine; since whole houses totter by the side <lb/>
            of a road, when shaken with waggons, though of no great <lb/>
            weight; nor are edifices less agitated3 when the stout drivers <note type="footnote"> 1 All bodies, (all, I say, without exception.)] Ver. 528. Omnia, <lb/>

            of chariots hurry dong the street the iron rounds of the <lb/>
            wheels.</p>
          <p>It happens, also, that when a large mass of earth1 rolls <lb/>
            down, from the effects of time, into a wide and deep pool of <lb/>
            water, the water is agitated, and the earth, too, trembles with <lb/>
            the concussion of the flood; as a vessel of liquid cannot stand <lb/>
            still upon the ground, unless the liquid, after being shaken, has <lb/>
            ceased to sway with a rocking motion within it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, when wind, collected in the hollow places under <lb/>
            the earth, bears strongly from one quarter, and, struggling <lb/>
            with vast power, crowds into the deep caverns, the earth, to­ <lb/>
            wards the part where the force of the blast directs itself, <lb/>
            inclines and gives way; and then the buildings which are <lb/>
            erected upon the earth's surface,2 sloping and being driven <lb/>
            from the perpendicular, lean in the same direction, and so <lb/>
            much the more as they respectively rise higher into the air; <lb/>
            while the beams, being stretched, stand out, as ready to start <lb/>
            from their places. And do men hesitate to believe that a <lb/>
            time of ruin and destruction awaits the whole fabric of the <lb/>
            world, when they see so vast a mass of the earth give way ? <lb/>
            Whereas, even now, unless the winds were to remit their fury, <lb/>

            going to destruction; but, because they relax and struggle <lb/>
            by turns, and, as if collecting their force, return to the charge, <lb/>
            and then retreat as if repulsed; the earth, on this account, <lb/>
            oftener threatens ruin than actually suffers it;1 for it inclines <lb/>
            and starts back, as it were, only for a time, and then, making <lb/>
            an effort with its whole weight, recovers its station.2 From <lb/>
            this cause, accordingly, all our houses tremble and reel; the <lb/>
            highest more than the middling, the middling more than the <lb/>
            lowest, the lowest scarcely at all.3</p>
          <p>There is also this cause of great quaking of the earth to be <lb/>
            mentioned. When wind, and any vast quantity of air, collected <lb/>
            either without or within the earth, has suddenly thrown itself <lb/>
            into hollow places under the ground, it there rages, at first,4 <lb/>
            with violent fury, among the vast caverns, and rolls and urges <lb/>
            itself along; but at length, when its force is roused and ex <lb/>
            cited, it bursts forth abroad, and, cleaving the deep soil, forms <lb/>
            a huge yawning chasm; as happened in Syrian Sidon,5 and <note type="footnote"> non ulla refrænet <lb/>

            was seen at Ægium in the Peloponnesus;1 which cities, such <lb/>
            an eruption of air, and an earthquake produced at the same <lb/>
            time, overthrew and destroyed. Many other cities, also, by <lb/>
            reason of violent earthquakes, have sunk down to the ground ; <lb/>
            and many cities, with their inhabitants, have been over­ <lb/>
            whelmed in the sea. But if the force of the air, and violent <lb/>
            fury of the wind, do not burst through the soil, they yet <lb/>
            spread, like shuddering blasts, through the numerous open­ <lb/>
            ings under ground, and thus cause a tremour on the surface; <lb/>
            as cold, when it penetrates into our limbs, shakes them, and <lb/>
            compels them to tremble and quiver against our will. Men, <lb/>
            therefore, in cities, are appalled, on such occasions, with dou­ <lb/>
            ble terror; for they dread the buildings above them; and are <lb/>
            afraid, at the same time, lest the earth should suddenly break <lb/>
            up3 the depths below, and lest, being disruptured and dis­ <lb/>
            ordered, it should open wide its jaws, and prepare to fill them <lb/>
            with its own ruins.</p>
          <p>Though men, therefore, think that the heavens and the <lb/>
            earth will be imperishable, and are intrusted to eternal safety,4 <lb/>
            yet, at times, the present influence of danger causes in some <lb/>
            degree the sensation of fear; a fear lest the earth, suddenly <lb/>
            withdrawn from beneath their feet, should sink down into a <lb/>
            gulf; and lest the SUM OF THINGS, utterly overthrown, should <lb/>
            follow it, and only a confused wreck of the world remain.</p>
          <p>I must now proceed to give a reason why the sea knows <note type="footnote"> field recalled, observing that Pliny, N. H. xxxv. 51, has " terrA in <lb/>
            Syriâ, circa Sidonem, oppidum maritimum." " And," says Forbiger, <lb/>
            “since geographers (as Strabo, xvi. p. 749, Cas.; Plin. N. H. v <lb/>
            13; Pomp. Mela, i. 11, 1) comprise under the name of Syria, in <lb/>
            its wider sense, all the lands between Cilicia, Arabia, Egypt, and <lb/>
            the Tigris, and, consequently, Phœnice, why might not Lucretius <lb/>

            no augmentation.1 In the first place, men wonder that nature <lb/>
            does not necessarily enlarge the ocean, into which there is so <lb/>
            great a conflux of waters, and into which the-rivers run from <lb/>
            all quarters. But add to the rivers, if you please, the wan­ <lb/>
            dering showers and flying storms, which scatter and discharge <lb/>
            themselves over all the sea and the earth; add, if you please, <lb/>
            the sources of the rivers; yet all these, compared with the <lb/>
            vastness of the sea, are but as one drop of water fcr the aug­ <lb/>
            mentation of the whole. It is no wonder, therefore, that the <lb/>
            mighty ocean is not increased.</p>
          <p>Besides, the sun, by the influence of his heat, draws a large <lb/>
            portion away from it. For we observe how the sun dries, <lb/>
            with his burning rays, garments that are drenched with mois­ <lb/>
            ture. But the ocean, we see, is large, and widely extended <lb/>
            beneath his beams; and although, therefore, the sun may ex­ <lb/>
            hale but a small portion of moisture from each spot on the <lb/>
            seal it will yet deduct a large quantity from its waters through­ <lb/>
            out so great an extent of surface.</p>
          <p>Moreover the winds,-the winds, I say, which sweep the <lb/>
            ocean,-may carry off a considerable portion of its liquid; for <lb/>
            we often see the roads, after being drenched with rain, dried <lb/>
            in a single night, and a crust of mud, which before was soft, <lb/>
            hardened and congealed upon them.</p>
          <p>The clouds, too, I have before shown, take up a large quan­ <lb/>
            tity of moisture, which is attracted by them from the vast <lb/>
            surface of the ocean; and which they sprinkle, in various <lb/>
            parts, over the whole round of the earth, at times when rain <lb/>
            falls on the ground, and when he winds drive the clouds <lb/>
            athwart the sky.</p>
          <p>Lastly, since the earth is of a porous consistence, and is in <lb/>
            contact with the sea, encompassing the shores of the deep on <note type="footnote"> 1 Why the sea knows no augmentation.] Ver. 608. Cur augmen <lb/>
            nesciat æquor. " To the question, why the sea, into which all rivers <lb/>
            run, is not increased, Lucretius answers, 1. That the sea is so vast, <lb/>
            that all the water of the rivers, together with all the rain that falls <lb/>
            from the clouds, is but as a drop to the whole. 2. That the sun ex­ <lb/>
            hales much water from it. 3. That the winds carry away much. <lb/>
            4. That the clouds take away a portion. 5. That as the rivers run <lb/>
            into the sea. so they pass out of the sea, by openings in the earth <lb/>
            from the bed of the ocean, to their own sources; producing a cir­ <lb/>
            culation of water which makes it not at all wonderful that there is <lb/>
            no increase in the sea." Creech. </note> <pb n="271"/>

            all sides, the water, as it flows from the earth into the sea, <lb/>
            must likewise pass, reciprocally, from the salt sea into the <lb/>
            earth; for the salt is strained off, and the pure substance of <lb/>
            the water flows back into the ground, and collects all together <lb/>
            at the sources of rivers; from whence it returns, in fresh <lb/>
            streams, over the earth, wherever a passage, once cut, has <lb/>
            conveyed the flood in its liquid course.1</p>
          <p>I shall now explain what is the cause that fires at times <lb/>
            burst forth, with such tempestuous fury, from the jaws of <lb/>
            Mount Ætna.2 For it was not from any divine origin of <lb/>
            calamity,3 that a storm of fire, rising and raging over the <lb/>
            fields of the Sicilians, attracted to itself the attention of the <lb/>
            neighbouring nations, when, observing all the regions of <lb/>
            heaven covered with smoke, and gleaming with flames, they <lb/>
            felt their breasts filled with awful anxiety, dreading what new <lb/>

            might, in the opinion of some, support the notion of the world being <lb/>

            fire of Ætna, at which, though it lays waste a large portion of Sicily, <lb/>
            we ought not inconsiderately to wonder, as being beyond the <lb/>
            powers of nature. Some may think it supernatural, because it is <lb/>
            vast, but they think it vast, only because they have not seen a <lb/>
            greater; nor ought we to wonder at the vastness of any thing, when <lb/>
            we compare it with the immensity of the universe; which would <lb/>
            supply atoms for a conflagration that would far exceed those of <lb/>
            Ætna. Eruptions of this kind are like diseases in the human frame; <lb/>
            and as the seeds of disease may come into the human body from the <lb/>
            world in which we live, so they may come into the world from the <lb/>
            universe; for if you make a comparison, you may say that as man <lb/>
            is to this world, so is this world to the universe." From Creech. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 From any divine origin of calamity.] Ver. 642. Neque enim diA <lb/>

            if you fully consider, and fully understand, when it is fairly <lb/>
            presented to your mind, you may forbear to wonder at many <lb/>
            things which now excite your admiration.</p>
          <p>For, in respect to our own bodies, which of us is surprised <lb/>
            if any of his neighbours has contracted a fever, that spreads <lb/>
            through his frame with a burning heat, or has felt any other <lb/>
            painful disease in his limbs ? Since the foot often swells on a <lb/>
            sudden; a sharp pang frequently seizes the teeth, or darts <lb/>
            through the eyes; erysipelas arises, and, creeping through the <lb/>
            frame, burns whatever part it has attacked, and spreads itself <lb/>
            over the limbs. Nor is it strange that such maladies should <lb/>
            occur; for there are atoms ready to produce many effects; <lb/>
            and this earth and air contain seeds enough of noxious dis­ <lb/>
            ease, from which an abundance of infinite disorder may have <lb/>
            its growth. Thus, too, we must suppose that, as to our own <lb/>
            bodies, so to the whole heaven and earth, are plentifully sup­ <lb/>
            plied all kinds of atoms from the immensity of matter, by the <lb/>
            effects of which the earth, being suddenly moved, may quake <lb/>
            with agitation, while a rapid hurricane may rush over sea and <lb/>
            land, the fire of Ætna may swell forth, and the heaven be in <lb/>
            a blaze; for even this happens, even the celestial regions glow <lb/>
            with heat. Thus, too, storms of rain arise with a greater <lb/>
            combination-of-force, when particles of moisture have in like <lb/>
            manner chanced to unite themselves.</p>
          <p>“But the raging fire of Ætna,” you will say, " is extraordi­ <lb/>
            narily great." Doubtless, I answer; and a river, which has <lb/>
            been seen by any person, appears extraordinarily great to him <lb/>
            who has never before seen a greater; and a man or a tree <lb/>
            possibly appears large to the eyes of some animals; and every <lb/>
            one imagines every thing of every sort, which is the greatest <lb/>
            that he has seen, to be extremely large; although all things <lb/>
            that he beholds, together with the heaven and the earth and <lb/>
            the ocean, are as nothing in comparison with the ENTIRE SUM <lb/>
            OF THE ENTIRE WHOLE.1</p>
          <p>I will now, however, explain by what causes the fire ot <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοστὸν μέρος</foreign>, which he observes that Strabo (lib. i. p. 26, ed. Cas.) <lb/>

            AEtna, when suddenly excited, bursts forth from its vast fur­ <lb/>
            naces. In the first place, the fabric of the mountain is hollow <lb/>
            underneath, supported, for the most part, by arches of flint- <lb/>
            stone. In all the caverns, moreover, is wind and air, for air, <lb/>
            when it is moved by any agitating impulse, becomes wind. <lb/>
            When this air, then, has grown hot, and has heated all the <lb/>
            rocks and earth round about, as far as it reaches, and elicited <lb/>
            from them fire raging with violent flames, it mounts up, and <lb/>
            thus expels the blaze straight from the jaws of the mountain, <lb/>
            high into the air, and spreads it far abroad, and scatters the <lb/>
            embers to a great distance, and rolls forth smoke heavy with <lb/>
            thick darkness, while it darts out, at the same time, rocks of <lb/>
            a wonderful weight. You cannot, therefore, doubt, but that <lb/>
            it is the violent force of air which produces these effects.</p>
          <p>Besides, the sea, for a considerable distance, alternately <lb/>
            breaks its waves, and again retracts its tide, at the base of <lb/>
            that mountain. From this sea caverns extend under ground <lb/>
            as far as the ascending jaws of the mountain; by these <lb/>
            caverns you must admit (for fact absolutely compels you) <lb/>
            that blasts of wind enter1 and penetrate from the open sea, and <lb/>
            thus exalt the flame, and cast up rocks, and raise clouds of <lb/>
            sand. For on the summit of the mountain are craters, as the <lb/>
            Greek call them, but which we call jaws and mouths.</p>
          <p>There are some phaenomena, too, for which it is not suf­ <lb/>
            ficient to assign merely one cause, but it is requisite to enumerate <lb/>
            many: of which, however, one only can be the true cause. <lb/>
            As if, for example, you should see the dead body of a man <lb/>
            lying on the ground at a distance, you naturally run over all <lb/>
            the probable causes of his death,2 that the one cause of it may <lb/>
            be sure to be mentioned. For neither, perhaps, can you prove <note type="footnote"> 1 Blasts of wind enter.] Ver. 698. <lb/>

            that he died by the sword, nor of the effects of cold, nor by <lb/>
            disease, nor by poison; but we know that it is something ot <lb/>
            this destructive nature that has happened to him. This same <lb/>
            observation we may make in respect to many other things.</p>
          <p>The Nile, the river of all Egypt,1 is the only one of all <lb/>
            streams in the world that swells towards summer, and inun­ <lb/>
            dates the fields. This river waters Egypt, from time to time, <lb/>
            during the middle of the hot season; and this happens, possi­ <lb/>
            bly,2 because the north winds, which are said to be Etesian <lb/>
            winds,3 prevail at that time in the summer over against the <lb/>
            mouth of the river, and, blowing up the stream, retard it; and <lb/>
            thus, forcing the flood up the channel, fill it, and compel the <lb/>
            waters to stagnate. For without doubt these breezes, which <lb/>
            come from the cold stars of the north pole, advance against <lb/>
            the stream. The river flows from the warm countries, taking <lb/>
            its rise from the extreme south, and from the regions of noon- <note type="footnote"> Ver. 707. Fit ut omnes dicere causas conveniat leti, dicatur ut illius <lb/>

            of the increase of the Nile in the summer; a matter concerning <lb/>
            which there was much inquiry among the ancients. Herodotus <lb/>
            notices and refutes their opinions ; of which, the first attributed the <lb/>
            effect to the Etesian winds ; the second, to the ocean; the third, to <lb/>
            the melting of snow near the upper portion of the stream; and then <lb/>
            proposes his own as a fourth, imputing the swell of the river to the <lb/>
            change of position in the sun, which, in winter, passing over Libya, <lb/>
            exhales a great quantity of water from the Nile ; but, at the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of summer, retreating to the north, has the same effect on <lb/>
            the rivers of Greece; so that, according to Herodotus, the Nile <lb/>
            only seems to increase in summer, when, in reality, it decreases in <lb/>
            winter. This opinion is opposed by Diod. Sic. lib. i. See also Plin. <lb/>

            now pretty generally considered that the inundation arises chiefly <lb/>
            from the periodical rains, which fall in the tropical regions from <lb/>
            June to September; but that it is partially promoted, at the same <lb/>
            time, by the Etesian or annual winds, which blow violently from <lb/>
            the north-east, and diminish the discharge of water from the river <lb/>

          <p>It is possible, also, that a great collection of sand3 (at times <lb/>
            when the sea, excited by the wind, drives the sand within the <lb/>
            bed of the river) may cause obstruction4 at the mouth of the <lb/>
            stream to the waters coming towards it. By this means it <lb/>
            may happen that the outlet of the river may be less free, and <lb/>
            that the current of the water, likewise, may be rendered less <lb/>
            impetuous.</p>
          <p>It is also possible, perhaps, that rain may fall more abund­ <lb/>
            antly near its source, at the very time when the Etesian winds <lb/>
            from the north drive all the clouds into those parts. For <lb/>
            when the clouds, impelled towards the regions of the south,5 <lb/>
            have collected there in a body, they are at last pressed and <lb/>
            driven against the lofty mountains, and compelled by the force <lb/>
            of the wind to discharge their waters.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, too, it may have its increase entirely from the <lb/>
            high hills of the Ethiopians, at the time when the sun, shining <lb/>
            on all parts of them, forces the white snow, with his dissolving <lb/>

          <p>Give me now your attention, and I will show with what <lb/>
            nature and qualities the regions and lakes, which are called <lb/>
            Avernian,1 are distinguished.</p>
          <p>In the first place, as to the circumstance that they are <lb/>
            named Avernian, that name has been given them from their <lb/>
            peculiar property, inasmuch as they are destructive to all <lb/>
            kinds of birds; and because, when any of the feathered tribe <lb/>
            have, in their flight, come over against those parts,2 forgetful <lb/>
            of their steerage, they relax the sails of their pinions, and, <lb/>
            sinking down with powerless neck, fall headlong on the ground, <lb/>
            if, perchance, the nature of the parts beneath allow them to fall <lb/>
            thus, or into the water, if a lake of Avernus happen to be <lb/>
            stretched under them. Such a spot is near Cumæ, where the <lb/>
            hills smoke from being charged with vivid sulphur, and <lb/>
            abounding with hot springs.</p>
          <p>There is also a place within the walls of Athens, on the <lb/>
            very summit of the hill, close by the temple of bountiful <lb/>
            Tritonian Pallas, to which the hoarse crows never direct their <lb/>
            flight; not even when the altars smoke with offerings. So <lb/>
            carefully do they avoid, not the violent wrath of Pallas on <lb/>
            account of watchfulness,3 as the poets of the Greeks have <lb/>
            sung, but the fumes of the sulphur; for the nature of the <lb/>
            place produces this effect of itself.</p>
          <p>There is also reported to be a place in Syria, plainly to be <lb/>
            seen,4 to which as soon as four-footed animals have directed <note type="footnote"> 1 Regions and lakes which are called Avernian.] Ver. 739. Aver­ <lb/>

            their steps, the very nature of it causes them to fall heavily <lb/>

          <p>But all these things are effected by the operation of nature; <lb/>
            and the origin of them, and from what causes they arise, is <lb/>
            apparent. So that the gate of Tartarus must not be thought <lb/>
            to be situate in these regions, nor, moreover,1 must we imagine <lb/>
            that the infernal deities can possibly draw souls down from <lb/>
            hence into the coasts of Acheron, as swift stags,2 with the <lb/>
            breath of their nostrils, are often supposed to draw the crawl­ <lb/>

            I pray you, how far all this is at variance with just reasoning; <lb/>
            for I now proceed to give you a full explanation concerning <lb/>
            this very subject.</p>
          <p>In the first place, I assert this, (which I have also fre <lb/>
            quently asserted before,3) that there are in the earth all kinds <lb/>
            of forms of the atoms of things ; of which there are many that <lb/>
            are wholesome for food, and many that may bring on disease <lb/>
            and hasten death. We have also previously shown4 that for <lb/>
            different animals, with regard to the sustenance of life, some <lb/>
            substances are better adapted than others, on account of their <lb/>
            dissimilar natures, and opposite constitution one to the other, <lb/>
            and the primary figures of their seminal-particles. Many <lb/>
            noxious atoms pass through the ears; many that are offensive <lb/>
            and harsh to the sense penetrate through the nostrils; nor <lb/>
            are there few only which are to be avoided by the touch, or <lb/>
            shunned by the sight, or which are bitter to the taste.</p>

            pernicious influence on mankind, both disagreeable and deadly. <lb/>

            therefore fair to suppose that Forbiger and Eichstadt referred percepit <lb/>

            Wakefield evidently referred it to odor vini; quum odor vini per­ <lb/>

          <p>Or have you not learned how much poison is in the earth <lb/>
            for gold mines to exhale?2 What sort of looks and com­ <lb/>
            plexions do they produce in the men who work in them ? Do <lb/>

            sarily withheld from those whom superior power confines in <lb/>
            such an employment ? The earth, evidently, steams forth all <lb/>
            these vapours, and breathes them out into the regions of the <lb/>
            air, which are open and ready to receive them.</p>
          <p>So, likewise, the regions of Avernus must send up from <lb/>
            beneath a vapour destructive to birds; a vapour which <lb/>
            ascends from the earth into the air, in such abundance as to <lb/>
            poison the body of the atmosphere to a certain extent. So <lb/>
            that, as soon as a bird has been borne thither on its wings, it <lb/>
            is there stopped, being so violently affected by the invisible <lb/>
            poison, that it drops down over against the spot where the <lb/>
            exhalation raises itself. And when the bird has fallen there,3 <lb/>
            this same force of the exhalation takes away the remains of <lb/>
            life from all its members. For at first it only excites, as it <lb/>
            were, a certain giddiness in the birds, but afterwards, when <lb/>

            sider, with Creech, that there ought to be a point after corruit, which <lb/>
            is to be referred, not to the vapour, but to the bird. When the bird <lb/>
            has fallen down, the vapour deprives it of life. It is observable <lb/>
            that Lucretius here uses œstus at the end of three verses out of <lb/>

            poison, it comes to pass that they must there yield up even <lb/>
            their life, because a vast quantity of the poisonous-exhalation <lb/>
            surrounds them.</p>
          <p>It happens also, at times, that this vapour and exhalation <lb/>
            of Avernus disperses the air which intervenes between the <lb/>
            birds and the earth, so that that portion of the atmosphere is <lb/>
            left, from this cause, almost empty. And when the birds, in <lb/>
            their flight, have come over against this part, the effort of their <lb/>
            wings immediately halts and grows ineffectual, and every <lb/>
            struggle of their pinions, on either side, is unsupported. <lb/>
            Thus, when they are unable to flap their wings, or to rest <lb/>
            upon them, nature, you will understand, compels them to de­ <lb/>
            scend to the earth by their own weight, and accordingly, sink­ <lb/>
            ing down through the part which is almost a vacuum, they <lb/>
            disperse abroad their lives through every pore of the body.</p>
          <p>Water in wells,' moreover, grows cooler in summer, and <lb/>
            for this reason, that the earth is then rarified by the heat, and <lb/>
            emits rapidly into the air any atoms of warmth which it may <lb/>
            happen to contain. The more, accordingly, the earth is ex­ <lb/>
            hausted of its heat, the cooler, also, does the water become <lb/>
            which is concealed under-ground. And on the contrary, too, <lb/>
            when the earth is contracted, and condensed, and congealed, <lb/>
            as it were, with cold, it happens that, as it contracts, it dis­ <lb/>
            charges into the wells whatever heat it contains.</p>
          <p>Near the temple of Jupiter Ammon, there is said to be <lb/>
            a fountain which is cold in the day and warm in the night. <lb/>
            At the peculiarity of this fountain men greatly wonder, and <lb/>
            imagine that the earth is heated, in its turn,3 by the power of <lb/>
            the sun from beneath, during the time when night has covered <lb/>
            the earth with its awful darkness; a supposition which is too <lb/>

            from above are possessed of such violent heat, cannot make <lb/>
            it warm even on the surface, how can this same sun act upon <lb/>
            the water, and infuse into it his quickening heat, from <lb/>
            beneath the earth, which is of so dense and solid a consist­ <lb/>
            ence? Especially when he can scarcely make his warmth, <lb/>
            by means of his glowing rays, penetrate through the walls <lb/>
            of houses.</p>
          <p>What, then, is the cause ? It is evidently this: that certain <lb/>
            ground, less dense than the rest of the ground, encircles this <lb/>
            fountain; and that there are many atoms of heat near the <lb/>
            body of water. Hence, when night covers the earth with its <lb/>
            dewy shade, the ground underneath immediately becomes <lb/>
            cold and contracts. By this process it happens that the soil, <lb/>
            as if it were compressed with the hand, discharges into the <lb/>
            fountain whatever atoms of heat it contains, which make the <lb/>
            water warm to the touch, 1 as well as the steam of it. After­ <lb/>
            wards, when the sun, with his morning rays, has relaxed and <lb/>
            rarefied the earth, (as his active heat mingles with it,) the <lb/>
            atoms -of heat return again into their former places, and all <lb/>
            the warmth of the water passes into the ground. From this <lb/>
            cause the fountain becomes cold in the day-time.</p>
          <p>Besides, the water is acted upon by the rays of the sun as <lb/>
            the day comes on,2 and is rarefied by the tremulous heat of <lb/>
            his beams. It accordingly happens, that whatever particles of <lb/>
            heat it contains, it disperses; as water often dispels the cold <lb/>
            which it contains, and dissolves its ice, and relaxes its fetters.</p>
          <p>There is also a cold spring at Dodona,3 over which when <lb/>
            tow is placed, it frequently, catching fire at once, throws out <lb/>
            flame; and in like manner a torch, lighted at its waters, casts <lb/>
            a radiance, wherever it swims or is impelled by the winds over <lb/>
            the surface; the cause evidently being, that there are in the <lb/>
            water many atoms of heat; and particles of warmth must also <lb/>
            arise from the earth itself over all the bottom of the fountain, <note type="footnote"> 1 Make the water warm to the touch.] Ver. 869. Calidumfaciunt <lb/>

            and be exharod and pass forth, at the same time, into the air; <lb/>
            yet these particles must not be so vivid as that the spring can <lb/>
            be rendered hot by them.</p>
          <p>Besides, some powerful influence excites those atoms of heat, <lb/>
            when dispersed abroad, to burst suddenly upwards through <lb/>
            the water, and to combine on the surface; as, in the sea around <lb/>
            Arados,l there is a spring of fresh water which bubbles up <lb/>
            through it, and puts aside the salt waves around it. And in <lb/>
            many other places the sea affords a seasonable relief to thirsty <lb/>
            mariners, inasmuch as it casts up fresh water among the salt. <lb/>
            Thus, too, those atoms of heat may burst up through that foun­ <lb/>
            tain of which we have spoken, and diffuse themselves abroad <lb/>
            among the tow; which atoms, when they combine together, <lb/>
            or adhere to the substance of the tow or torch, easily take <lb/>
            fire at once; because tow and torches contain likewise many <lb/>
            particles of heat, which may unite with those in the water to <lb/>
            produce flame.</p>
          <p>Do you not observe, also, that when you hold the wick of <lb/>
            a lamp? recently extinguished, to a night taper, it takes fire <lb/>
            before it touches the flame ? And have you not noticed a torch <lb/>
            catch fire in like manner? Many 'other substances, too, <lb/>
            affected by the mere heat, begin to burn at a distance from a <lb/>
            fire, before its flame closely involves them.3 Such, therefore, <lb/>
            we must conceive to be the case with respect to that fountain.</p>
          <p>In the next place, I shall proceed to show by what law of <lb/>

            magneto from the name of the region that produced it, (for <note type="footnote"> I In the sea around Arados.] Ver. 891. Indu mari Aradio. Arados <lb/>

            the inhabitants were called Magnetes ; and from them, according to <lb/>
            Lucretius and others, the magnet was named. Others say it had <lb/>
            its name from Magnes, a young man, who, walking over some stones, <lb/>
            found himself held fast by the iron attached to his shoes, and thug <lb/>
            first discovered the power of the magnet. See Plin. H. N. v. 29, <lb/>

            it was first found in the country of the Magnetes,) has the <lb/>
            power to attract iron.</p>
          <p>At this stone men look with astonishment, for it often ex­ <lb/>
            hibits a chain of little rings suspended from it. Since you <lb/>
            may at times see five or more, hanging in a straight line, <lb/>
            oscillate in a gentle breeze, whilst one depends from another, <lb/>
            attached to it underneath; and whilst they feel from each <lb/>
            other the influence and attraction of the stone; so thoroughly <lb/>
            does its force pervade the whole succession of rings.</p>
          <p>In matters of this kind, you must establish many points be­ <lb/>
            fore you can state the principle of the thing itself; and I <lb/>
            must, accordingly, approach the subject by a long circuit of <lb/>
            introductory remarks; on which account I entreat your atten­ <lb/>
            tive ear andfavourable regard.</p>
          <p>In the first place, from all bodies,l whatsoever we behold, <lb/>
            there must necessarily flow, and be emitted and dispersed, <lb/>
            certain substances which strike the eye and excite vision; <lb/>
            odours, too, are perpetually flying off from some bodies; as <lb/>
            cold is also diffused from rivers, heat from the sun, spray <lb/>
            from the billows of the ocean, which consumes walls near <lb/>
            the shore; nor do various voices cease to flit through <lb/>
            the air; moreover the moisture, so to speak, of a salt taste <lb/>
            comes often into the mouth when we are walking near the <lb/>
            sea; and when we look at diluted wormwood being mixed, a <lb/>
            bitterness affects Cur palate. So evident is it that a certain <lb/>
            substance is carried off perpetually from all bodies, and is dis­ <lb/>
            persed in all parts round about; nor is there any delay or <lb/>
            rest allowed to the efflux ; since we constantly perceive it <lb/>
            with our senses, and may see all objects at all times, and <lb/>
            smell them, and hear them sound.</p>
          <p>Here I shall observe again2 that which is set forth in the <lb/>
            first part of my poem, namely, of how porous a consistence <lb/>
            bodies are. For though to understand this is of importance <lb/>
            to many subjects, it is especially necessary to establish, with <lb/>
            regard to the very matter immediately under our notice <lb/>
            (concerning which I am proceeding to speak,) that there is <note type="footnote"> 1 In the first place, from all bodies, &amp;c.] Ver. 922. Fifteen verses <lb/>

            nothing in the whole of things before us I but body intermingled <lb/>
            with vacuity.</p>
          <p>It is apparent, first of all, that in caverns2 the overhanging <lb/>
            rocks exude moisture, and distil running drops. From the <lb/>
            whole of our own bodies, also, perspiration trickles; our <lb/>
            beard springs forth from them, and hairs arise over all our <lb/>
            limbs and members; the food which we take is distributed <lb/>
            through all our veins, and swells and nourishes the extreme <lb/>
            parts of the body, and even the very nails; we feel cold, too, <lb/>
            and vivid heat, penetrate through brass; we feel them like­ <lb/>
            wise pass through gold and silver, when we are holding full <lb/>
            cups.3 Moreover voices fly through the stone walls of houses; <lb/>
            odours, and cold, pervade them; as well as the heat of fire, <lb/>
            which has power to penetrate even the substance of iron, as <lb/>
            is felt where the corslet confines the circuit of the neck.4 The <lb/>
            infection of disease likewise penetrates walls, as it enters into <lb/>
            houses from without. Philosophers too, with reason, send <lb/>
            far back again5 into the depths of heaven and earth, the <note type="footnote"> 1Before us.] Ver. 942. In promtu. “ Nihil in rerum naturâ.” <lb/>
            Creech. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In caverns, &amp;c.] Ver. 943. His design, in these observations, is <lb/>
            to show that in all bodies, however apparently solid, more or less of <lb/>
            vacuity is intermingled; and that into the vacua, or empty spaces, <lb/>
            the atoms of other substances may enter. Our bodies contain vacua, <lb/>
            or are porous, for out of them perspiration trickles and through <lb/>
            them are distributed particles of food ; metals and walls are porous, <lb/>
            for they admit atoms of heat and cold, of voices and sounds. <lb/>
            The heavens, and the earth in general, are of a similar consistence, <lb/>
            for they can emit from their substance, whilst it remains apparently <lb/>
            undiminished, atoms to produce a tempest; and receive them back <lb/>

            This is Wakefield's reading, and is translated according to his ex­ <lb/>
            position. " The atoms of a tempest," says he, " which arise from the </note> <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="B. VI 958—985."/> <lb/>
            tempest which has burst forth from the earth and the heaven ; <lb/>
            since they rightly consider that there is no combination of <lb/>
            matter, ethereal or terrestrial, which is not of a consistence <lb/>
            far-from-impenetrable to other atoms.1</p>
          <p>To this is to be added, that all atoms, which are discharged <lb/>
            from bodies, are not possessed of the same power to affect the <lb/>
            senses, nor are they all alike adapted to all substances.</p>
          <p>The sun, we may first observe, extracts the moisture from <lb/>
            the earth, and renders it dry; while it melts ice, and forces <lb/>
            the snows, piled on the high mountains, to dissolve in the heat <lb/>
            of its rays. Wax, too, placed in the warmth of the sun, be­ <lb/>
            comes liquid. Fire, moreover, melts brass, and dissolves <lb/>
            gold, but contracts and draws together the hides and flesh <lb/>
            of animals. Water, also, hardens iron when fresh from the <lb/>
            fire, but softens hides and flesh when hardened with heat. <lb/>
            The wild olive tree, than which there is nothing that grows <lb/>
            more bitter to the taste of man, delights the bearded goats as <lb/>
            if it were flavoured with nectar and ambrosia. Swine, be­ <lb/>
            sides, shrink from ointment of amaracus,2 and dread every kind <lb/>
            of perfume ; for that which seems, at times, to restore us, as <lb/>
            it were, to life, is to bristly boars strong poison. But mud, <lb/>
            on the contrary, which is to us most repulsive filth, seems <lb/>
            clean and attractive to swine, so that they roll themselves <lb/>
            over and over in it without being tired.</p>
          <p>There is this, likewise, which remains to be noticed, and <lb/>
            which seems necessary to be stated before I proceed to speak <lb/>
            of the exact subject before us. Since in various bodies are <lb/>
            situated many pores, these pores must be distinguished by na­ <lb/>
            tures differing from one another, and have respectively their <lb/>
            own forms and shapes.3 For there are various senses in ani­ <note type="footnote"> heaven and earth, are into the heaven and earth received back again." <lb/>
            With facessunt, which sadly wants a nominative, he understands <lb/>
            philosophi, and takes remote facessunt in the sense of send far back. <lb/>
            Lambinus and Creech have another lection, which, however, does <lb/>
            not much alter the sense. </note><note type="footnote"> I Far-from-impenetrable to other atoms.] Ver. 959. I have ren­ <lb/>

            mals, of which each perceives for itself its own peculiar object; <lb/>
            since we observe that by one sense sounds penetrate into us, <lb/>
            by another taste from the juices of food, by another the smell <lb/>
            of perfume. Besides, one thing seems to pass through stone, <lb/>
            another through wood, another through gold. One substance <lb/>
            seems to penetrate silver, and another glass ; for through the <lb/>
            latter images seem to pass, and through the former heat. <lb/>
            One thing, too, seems to penetrate through the same passages <lb/>
            quicker than another. This difference, you may be certain, <lb/>
            the nature of the passages obliges to exist; since it evidently <lb/>
            varies (as we showed a little above) according to the different <lb/>
            consistence and texture of bodies.</p>
          <p>For which reason, since all these points are established and <lb/>
            laid down, and every thing prepared and made ready for us, <lb/>
            the principle of the magnet will hence, moreover,1 be easily <lb/>
            shown, and the whole cause, which attracts the substance of <lb/>
            the iron, will be made manifest.</p>
          <p>In the first place, many atoms, or effluvia, must necessarily <lb/>
            fly off from the stone, which, by their impact, disperse the <lb/>
            air that is situate betwixt the stone and the iron. When this <lb/>
            space is emptied, and a large void is made between them, <lb/>
            atoms of the iron, immediately darting forward, rush in a body <lb/>
            into the vacuum ; and the whole ring of necessity follows, and <lb/>
            passes onward with its whole body. For no substance coheres <lb/>
            and combines more closely,-having its primary-elements in­ <lb/>
            timately involved,-than the cold and rough consistence of <lb/>
            stout iron.2 It is therefore the less wonderful, if (as is <lb/>
            stated) certain of its atoms,3 starting forth in a body from the <lb/>
            iron itself cannot rush into the void without the whole ring <lb/>
            following; which it does, and continues to move until it has <note type="footnote"> enter them; i. e. their own shapes. " Propriam figuram, propri­ <lb/>

            reached the stone itself, and has become fixed to it by secret <lb/>
            attachment. The same process takes place on all sides; and <lb/>
            wherever an empty space is formed, whether at the side qf the <lb/>
            iron or above it, the nearest atoms tend immediately into the <lb/>
            void. For they are impelled by impacts from other surround­ <lb/>
            ing atoms; nor can they, of themselves, rise upwards, or pass <lb/>
            away from the magnet, into the air.</p>
          <p>To this is to be added another reason why this motion of <lb/>
            the atoms may still more certainly take place; namely, that as <lb/>
            soon as the air before the ring has become thinner, and the <lb/>
            space between it and the magnet more vacant and open, it <lb/>
            immediately happens that the air which is situate at the back <lb/>
            of the ring, carries it forward, as it were, and impels it from <lb/>
            behind. For the air surrounding all bodies continually strikes <lb/>
            upon them; but the air that surrounds the iron drives it for­ <lb/>
            ward at such times as it approaches the magnet, because the <lb/>
            space on one side is empty, and receives it into itself. And <lb/>
            this air too, of which I am speaking, subtilly conveying itself, <lb/>
            through the numerous pores of the iron, into its small recesses, <lb/>
            thrusts and pushes it forward. This substance of the iron, <lb/>
            accordingly, is helped forward by this assistance and impulse, <lb/>
            as ships and their sails are driven onwards by the wind.</p>
          <p>All bodies, moreover, must contain air in their substance, <lb/>
            since their consistence is more or less porous, and air sur­ <lb/>
            rounds and is in contact with every thing. This air, then, <lb/>
            which is concealed within the iron, is continually agitated <lb/>
            with a restless motion, and thus, doubtless, strikes upon the <lb/>
            ring, and moves it, as you may conceive, internally; and the <lb/>
            whole air, within and without, tends in the same direction in <lb/>
            which it has once started, and where it has found a vacuum <lb/>
            to assist its efforts.</p>
          <p>It happens, too, at times, that the substance of the iron re­ <lb/>
            cedes I from this stone, as if accustomed to start back from it, <lb/>
            and to follow it, by turns. <note type="footnote"> I Substance of the iron recedes.] Ver. 1041. " It happens, too, <lb/>
            says Lucretius, that the iron at times starts back from the magnet, <lb/>
            being accustomed sometimes to follow it, and sometimes to flee from <lb/>
            it: to follow it, when nothing intervenes between the two ; and to <lb/>
            flee from it, when brass is interposed." Lambinus. Gassendi thought <lb/>
            that Lucretius may have been acquainted with the difference in the <lb/>
            two poles of the magnet; but the poet, says Creech, doubtless had <lb/>
            no more knowledge than he exhibits. </note> <pb n="289"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n=" B. VI. 1043—1070."/>
          <p>Thus have I seen iron rings of Samothrace,1 as well as <lb/>
            filings of iron, lying in brazen basins, thrown into agitation, <lb/>
            and start up, when the magnet was applied anderneath; so <lb/>
            that it seems desirous to flee away from the load-stone, when <lb/>
            the brass is interposed; for it is by the intervention of the <lb/>
            brass that so great an aversion is produced; since, as is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, when the effluvia of the brass have pre-occupied and <lb/>
            filled up the open pores of the iron, the effluvia of the stone <lb/>
            follow, and find all parts of the iron full; and have no way <lb/>
            to pass through, as they would have had before. They are <lb/>
            therefore obliged to strike against the substance of the iron, <lb/>
            and to drive it upward, with their own stream; by which <lb/>
            means the magnet repels from itself, and drives away through <lb/>
            the brass, that metal, which, without the interference of the <lb/>
            brass, it most frequently attracts.</p>
          <p>But do not wonder, in the consideration of these subjects, <lb/>
            that the effluvia from this stone cannot also repel other sub­ <lb/>
            stances. For some substances remain unmoved as being sus­ <lb/>
            tained by their own weight; of which sort is gold; and others <lb/>
            cannot be repulsed, because they are of a porous consistence, <lb/>
            so that the effluvia pass through them unobstructed ; of which <lb/>
            kind wood appears to be. The substance of iron, however, <lb/>
            is placed between these two, so that, when it has admitted <lb/>
            certain atoms of the brass, it is then possible for the stream <lb/>
            of particles from the magnet to impel it.</p>
          <p>Nor are these mutual affinities of the magnet and iron so <lb/>
            unlike the affections of all other substances, but that many <lb/>
            instances of the kind occur to me; instances of bodies which <lb/>
            I could mention as remarkably adapted to each other.</p>

          <p>I shall now explain what is the nature and origin of dis­ <lb/>
            eases,1 and how a morbid infection of the air, suddenly arising, <lb/>
            may spread deadly destruction among the race of mankind and <lb/>
            the tribes of inferior animals. In the first place, I have already <lb/>
            shown2 that there are in many substances atoms which tend <lb/>
            to preserve our life; and, on the other hand, many must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily fly abroad which are productive of disease and death; <lb/>
            and when these have by chance combined, and disordered the <lb/>
            air, the air, when in this state, consequently becomes unwhole­ <lb/>
            some. And all this prevalence and pestilentialness of diseases <lb/>
            arise either from without the earth, (as clouds and mists gather <lb/>
            in the heaven above us,) or spring, as frequently happens, from <lb/>
            the earth itself, when, drenched with immoderate and un­ <lb/>
            timely rains, and acted upon by fierce rays of the sun, it has <lb/>
            contracted a kind of putrescence.</p>
          <p>Do you not observe, also, how those who visit any place <lb/>
            far from their country and their home, are affected by the <lb/>
            change in the air and water ? And this happens, because the <lb/>
            substances in those elements greatly differ. For how much <lb/>
            must we suppose that the air of the Britons varies from that <lb/>
            which is in Egypt, where the north pole of the world fails to <lb/>
            show itself?3 Or how much must we imagine that that which <lb/>
            hangs over Pontus differs from that which stretches over <lb/>
            Cadiz, and towards the races of men blackened by the parching <lb/>
            heat of the sun?4 These four kinds of air, which we observe <lb/>
            to proceed from the four winds and four several quarters of <lb/>
            the heaven, we know to be different one from another ; and the <lb/>
            complexion and looks of the men, also, appear to differ widely ; <lb/>
            and peculiar diseases seem to affect each individual nation. <note type="footnote"> shown how the iron may be brought to the loadstone, and he now <lb/>

          <p>There is the disease called leprosy,1 which has its rise on <lb/>
            the river Nile, in the middle of Egypt, and in no other <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>In Attica the feet2 are affected with the gout; and in the <lb/>
            country of Achaia the eyes are afflicted with soreness. Hence <lb/>
            various regions are unfavourable to various parts and mem­ <lb/>
            bers ; and this effect the difference of the air produces.</p>
          <p>When that air, therefore, which to us is strong poison, puts it­ <lb/>
            self in motion, and an unwholesome atmosphere begins to spread, <lb/>
            it creeps along, by degrees, like a mist or cloud, and disorders <lb/>
            the whole heaven, wherever it advances, and compels it to <lb/>
            alter its nature. It happens, accordingly, that when this cor­ <lb/>
            rupt air has at length joined our air, it infects it, and renders <lb/>
            it like itself, and unsuitable for us.</p>
          <p>This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls <lb/>
            into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other <lb/>
            food of men and cattle. Or even, as may be the case, the in­ <lb/>
            fection remains suspended in the air itself;3 and when, as we <lb/>
            breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily absorb those seeds of disease into our body. By a <lb/>

              water in wells; for a parching thirst, raging insatiably, and <lb/>
              driving-them-to-plunge their bodies into the flood, made vast <lb/>
              showers seem only as small drops.</p>
          <p>Nor was there any intermission of the malady; the bodies <lb/>
            of men lay exhausted; medicine spoke in low tones with a <lb/>
            secret dread ;2 so incessantly did the patients roll their eyes, <lb/>
            which remained wide open, burning with disease, and un­ <lb/>
            visited by sleep. Many other signs of death at the same time <lb/>
            showed themselves; the mind was distracted with anguish <lb/>
            and dread; the brow was gloomy; the look wild and fierce; <lb/>
            the ears disturbed and filled with noises; the breathing was <lb/>
            either fast, or thick, or drawn but seldom; there was a moist <lb/>
            dew of perspiration shining upon the neck; the saliva was <lb/>
            thin, scanty, and tinged with the colour of saffron; it was <lb/>
            also salt, and expelled with difficulty from the hoarse throat <lb/>
            by coughing. In the hand, the nerves contracted; and the <lb/>
            whole arm shook. From the feet a coldness rose quickly, <lb/>
            yet gradually,3 over the body; the nostrils, towards the closing <lb/>
            hour of life, were compressed; the point of the nose was sharp; <lb/>
            the eyes were hollow ; the temples sunk ; the skin cold and <lb/>
            hard; a distortion overspreading the mouth; the forehead <lb/>
            tense and prominent; and, not long after these appearances, <lb/>
            the limbs lay stretched in rigid death; and for the most part, <lb/>
            when the eighth light of the sun shone, or, at farthest, at his <lb/>
            ninth rising, they yielded up their life.</p>
          <p>Of which sufferers, if any one for a time escaped death, (as <lb/>

            the case, an excessive flux of corrupt blood, attended with <lb/>
            violent pains in the head, issued from the obstructed nostrils; <lb/>
            and, by this outlet, the whole strength and substance of the <lb/>
            loan passed away.</p>
          <p>He, moreover, who had escaped this violent flux of foul <lb/>
            blood, was not certain wholly to recover; for still the disease <lb/>
            was ready-to-pass into his nerves and joints, and into the <lb/>
            very genial organs of the body. And of those who suffered <lb/>
            thus, some, fearing the gates of death, continued to live, though <lb/>
            deprived by the steel of the virile part; and some, though <lb/>
            without hands and feet, and though they lost their eyes, yet <lb/>
            persisted-to-remain in life; so strong a dread of death had taken <lb/>
            possession of them. Upon some, too, came forgetfulness1 of <lb/>
            all things, so that they knew not even themselves.</p>
          <p>And though numerous corpses, heaped upon corpses, lay <lb/>

            stench, or, after having tasted the flesh, sickened with instant <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>But, indeed, during those days, scarcely any bird appeared <lb/>
            in the sky; nor did the destructive tribes of savage beasts <lb/>
            leave the woods during the nights. Most of them suffered <lb/>

            cially, stretched along all the streets, unwillingly relinquished <lb/>
            life; the force of the disease, however, wrested the vital power <lb/>
            from his limbs.</p>
          <p>Funerals, unattended and solitary, were eagerly hurried <lb/>
            over.1 Nor was there any certain mode of cure common and <lb/>
            efficientfor all. For that which had secured to one the privi­ <lb/>
            lege of breathing the vital air,2 and of beholding the regions <lb/>
            of the sky, was mere poison to others, and hastened their <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>But that which, in these circumstances, was pre-eminently <lb/>
            deplorable and wretched, was, that when any one found him­ <lb/>
            self seized with the pestilence, he lay down, as if he were con­ <lb/>
            demned3 to death, sunk in spirit, and with a despairing hearty <lb/>
            thinking only of death, and gave up the ghost on the same <lb/>
            spot on which he fell.</p>
          <p>At no time, however, did the contagion of the insatiable <lb/>
            disease cease to spread itself from one man to another, as a <lb/>
            murrain is disseminated among woolly sheep and horned cattle. <lb/>
            And this circumstance, even above all others, heaped death <lb/>
            upon death. For on those, who shrunk from visiting their <lb/>
            sickfriends, fatal neglect soon took vengeance, (as having been <lb/>
            too fond of life and too apprehensive of death,) causing them to <lb/>
            perish by a squalid and miserable end, deserted by their rela­ <lb/>
            tives, and destitute of relief. But those who had been ready <lb/>
            to give assistance, fell into the malady from infection, and by <lb/>

            Nor aught was seen but ghastly views of death. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="P. VI. 1244—1266."/> <lb/>
            the sufferers, mingled with sounds of reproach,1 compelled <lb/>
            them to undergo. The most excellent characters, accordingly, <lb/>
            incurred this kind of death most frequently.</p>
          <p>Those, moreover, who strove to bury the multitude of their <lb/>
            dead, one after another,2 returned home overcome with weep­ <lb/>
            ing and mourning. Hence men were stretched on their beds <lb/>
            in great numbers, through sorrow and despondency; nor could <lb/>
            any one be found, whom, in such a time of calamity, neither <lb/>
            disease, nor death, nor mourningfor the loss offriends, had af­ <lb/>
            fected.</p>
          <p>Besides, as the pestilence now spread, every shepherd and <lb/>
            herdsman, as well as every stout driver of the crooked plough, <lb/>
            languished under the infection; their bodies lay cooped up <lb/>
            within their narrow huts, consigned to death from the effects <lb/>
            of want and disease. You might have seen the dead corpses <lb/>
            of parents stretched on their dead children, and sometimes, <lb/>
            again, children expiring on the bodies of their mothers and <lb/>
            fathers.</p>
          <p>And this affliction was brought, in no small portion, into <lb/>
            the city from the country; affliction which a sick and in­ <lb/>
            fected multitude of rustics, flocking together from all parts, <lb/>
            introduced. They crowded all places of reception and of <lb/>
            shelter; for which reason, as they were thus crammed toge­ <lb/>
            titer, death the more easily strewed them in heaps by the <lb/>
            force of contagion.</p>
          <p>Many bodies, from the effects of thirst, lay stretched at the <lb/>
            public conduits,3 prostrate and extended along the road, their <lb/>
            breath having been stopped by too great indulgence in the <lb/>
            deliciousness of the water. And every where, along the open <lb/>

            If any one neglected to pay the rites of burial to those who were <lb/>

          <p>Thus abruptly ends the description of the plague, and the poem <lb/>
            of Lucretius.</p>
          <p>Much of the account of the pestilence, as is observed above, is <lb/>
            taken from Thucydides. I have not thought it necessary to trans­ <lb/>
            cribe in the notes the passages of Thucydides which Lucretius imi­ <lb/>
            tates ; the English reader may refer to the whole description in Mr. <lb/>
            Dale's Thucydides; and the scholar has ample references in Lam­ <lb/>
            binus and Creech.</p>
          <p>Procopius has given a full account of the plague which began to <lb/>
            spread through the world, and devastated the city of Constantinople, <lb/>
            in the reign of Justinian ; an account in which Gibbon says that he <lb/>
            " has emulated the skill and diligence of Thucydides in his descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of the plague at Athens." It is observable that he represents <lb/>
            it, like that of Athens, as taking its rise from Egypt. " Ethiopia and <lb/>
            Egypt," says Gibbon, (ch. xliii. sub fin.,) "have been stigmatized, <lb/>
            in every age, as the great source and seminary of the plague. In a <lb/>
            damp, hot, stagnating air, this African fever is generated from the <lb/>
            putrefaction of animal substances, and especially from the swarms <lb/>
            of locusts, not less destructive to mankind in their death than in <lb/>
            their lives."</p>
          <p>The assertion of Macrobius, (Sat. vi. 2,) that Virgil took the prin­ <lb/>

            cipal colouring and features of his description of a pestilence an.ong <lb/>
            cattle (Georg. iii. 478—566) from Lucretius's picture of the Athenian <lb/>
            plague, rests on very slight foundation. Virgil may have been in­ <lb/>
            duced to write his description in emulation of that of Lucretius; <lb/>
            but very little that is actually copied will be found in it. In Ovid's <lb/>
            description of the same Athenian pestilence, (Metam. vii. 523—613,) <lb/>
            the attentive reader will find far more marks of imitation.</p>
          <p>Silius Italicus (xiv. 580—617) also, like his great predecessors, <lb/>
            gives a description of the plague which attacked the Roman army <lb/>
            at the siege of Syracuse. Many of his points are taken from Lu­ <lb/>
            cretius, as in the following passage: <lb/>
            Helpless the victims sunk; the tongue was parched; <lb/>
            Cold perspiration o'er the trembling frame <lb/>
            Flowed copious; while the tumid throat forbade <lb/>
            The food's half-forced descent; a vehement cough <lb/>
            Shook the vexed lungs; and from the arid mouth <lb/>
            Fumed fiery breath, that ceaseless thirst proclaimed. <lb/>
            The eyes, that scarce th' oppressive light could bear, <lb/>
            Sunk in deep ghastly hollows by the side <lb/>
            Of the sharp nose; foul bile, commixed with blood, <lb/>
            Forth gushes from the stomach; the weak limbs, <lb/>
            Fleshless and wasted, shrink to skin and bone.</p>
          <p>The general features of pestilential destruction are also carefully <lb/>
            detailed by Seneca in his Œdipus, Act i.</p>

          <p>Boccacio, in his description of the plague at Florence, seems to <lb/>
            have had Thucydides in view.</p>

          <p>PARENT of ROME ! by gods and men beloved, <lb/>
            Benignant VENUS! thou, the sail-clad main <lb/>
            And fruitful earth, as round the seasons roll, <lb/>
            With life who swellest, for by thee all live, <lb/>
            And, living, hail the cheerful light of day :— <lb n="5"/>
            Thee, goddess, at thy glad approach, the winds. <lb/>
            The tempests fly : dedalian Earth to thee <lb/>
            Pours forth her sweetest flow'rets: Ocean laughs, <lb/>
            And the blue heavens in cloudless splendour decked. <lb/>
            For, when the Spring first opes her frolic eye, <lb n="10"/>
            And genial zephyrs long locked up respire, <lb/>
            Thee, goddess, then, th' aerial birds confess, <lb/>
            To rapture stung through every shivering plume: <lb/>
            Thee, the wild herds ; hence, o'er the joyous glebe <lb/>
            Bounding at large; or, with undaunted chest, <lb n="15"/>
            Stemming the torrent tides. Through all that lives <lb/>
            So, by thy charms, thy blandishments overpowered, <lb/>
            Springs the warm wish thy footsteps to pursue: <lb/>
            Till through the seas, the mountains, and the floods, <lb/>
            The verdant meads, and woodlands filled with song <lb n="20"/>
            Spurred by desire each palpitating tribe <lb/>
            Hastes, at thy shrine, to plant, the future race.</p>
          <p>Since, then, with universal sway thou rul'st, <lb/>
            And thou alone; nor aught without thee springs, <pb n="304"/>

            </note>Aught gay or lovely; thee I woo to guide <lb n="25"/>
            Aright my flowing song, that aims to paint <lb/>
            To MEMMIUS' view the ESSENCES OF THINGS: <lb/>
            MEMMIUS, my friend, by thee, from earliest youth, <lb/>
            O goddess ! led, and trained to every grace. <lb/>
            Then, 0, vouchsafe thy favour, power divine! <lb n="30"/>
            And with immortal eloquence inspire. <lb/>
            Quell, too, the fury of the hostile world, <lb/>
            And lull to peace, that all the strain may hear. <lb/>
            For peace is thine: on thy soft bosom he, <lb/>
            The warlike field who sways, almighty MARS, <lb n="35"/>
            Struck by triumphant Love's eternal wound, <lb/>
            Reclines full frequent: with uplifted gaze <lb/>
            On thee he feeds his longing, lingering eyes, <lb/>
            And all his soul hangs quivering from thy lips. <lb/>
            O! while thine arms in fond embraces clasp <lb n="40"/>
            His panting members, sovereign of the heart! <lb/>
            Ope thy bland voice, and intercede for ROME. <lb/>
            For, while th' unsheathed sword is brandished, vain <lb/>
            And all unequal is the poet's song ; <lb/>
            And vain th' attempt to claim his patron's ear. <lb n="45"/>
            </p>
          <p>Son of the MEMMII! thou, benignant, too, <lb/>
            Freed from all cares, with vacant ear attend ; <lb/>
            Nor turn, contemptuous, ere the truths I sing, <lb/>
            For thee first harmonized, are full perceived. <lb/>
            Lo! to thy view I spread the rise of things; <lb n="50"/>
            Unfold th' immortals, and their blest abodes : <lb/>
            How Nature all creates, sustains, matures, <lb/>
            And how, at length, dissolves; what forms the muss, <lb/>
            Termed by the learned, Matter, Seeds of Things, <lb/>
            And generative Atoms, or, at times, <lb n="55"/>
            Atoms primordial, as hence all proceeds.</p>
          <p>Far, far from mortals, and their vain concerns, <lb/>
            In peace perpetual dwell th' immortal gods: <lb/>
            Each self-dependent, and from human wants <lb/>
            Estranged for ever. There, nor pain pervades, <lb n="60"/>
            Nor danger threatens; every passion sleeps; <lb/>
            Vice no revenge, no rapture virtue prompts.</p>
          <p>Not thus mankind. Them long the tyrant power <lb/>

            Auspicious rose, who first the combat dared, <lb/>
            And broke in twain the monster's iron rod. <lb/>
            No thunder him, no fell revenge pursued <lb/>
            Of heaven incensed, or deities in arms. <lb n="70"/>
            Urged rather, hence, with more determined soul, <lb/>
            To burst through Nature's portals, from the crew! <lb/>
            With jealous caution closed; the flaming walls <lb/>

            Till the vast whole beneath him stood displayed. <lb n="75"/>
            Hence taught he us, triumphant, what might spring, <lb/>
            And what forbear: what powers inherent lurk, <lb/>
            And where their bounds and issues. And, hence, we- <lb/>
            Triumphant too, o'er SUPERSTITION rise, <lb/>
            Contemn her terrors, and unfold the heavens. <lb n="80"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor deem the truths PHILOSOPHY reveals <lb/>
            Corrupt the mind, or prompt to impious deeds. <lb/>
            No: SUPERSTITION may, and nought so soon, <lb/>
            But Wisdom never. SUPERSTITION 'twas <lb/>
            Urged the fell GRECIAN chiefs, with virgin blood, <lb n="85"/>
            To stain the virgin altar. Barbarous deed ! <lb/>
            And fatal to their laurels ! AULIS saw, <lb/>
            For there DIANA reigns, th' unholy rite. <lb/>
            Around she looked ; the pride of GRECIAN maids, <lb/>
            The lovely IPHIGENIA, round she looked,- <lb n="90"/>
            Her lavish tresses, spurning still the bond <lb/>
            Of sacred fillet, flaunting o'er her cheeks,- <lb/>
            And sought, in vain, protection. She surveyed <lb/>
            Near her, her sad, sad sire; th' officious priests <lb/>
            Repentant half, and hiding their keen steel, <lb n="95"/>
            And crowds of gazers weeping as they viewed. <lb/>
            Dumb with alarm, with supplicating knee, <lb/>
            And lifted eye, she sought compassion still; <lb/>
            Fruitless and unavailing: vain her youth, <lb/>
            Her innocence, and beauty ; vain the boast <lb n="100"/>
            Of regal birth ; and vain that first herself <lb/>
            Lisped the dear name of Father, eldest born. <lb/>
            Forced from her suppliant posture, straight she viewed <lb/>
            The altar full prepared : not there to blend <lb/>
            Connubial vows, and light the bridal torch ; <lb n="105"/>

            </note>While Hymen called aloud, to fall, e'en then, <lb/>

            Of GRECIAN navies, favoured thus with gales.- <lb/>
            Such are the crimes that SUPERSTITION prompts ! <lb n="110"/>
            </p>
          <p>And dost thou still resist us ? trusting still <lb/>
            The fearful tale by priests and poets told ?— <lb/>
            I, too, could feign such fables; and combine <lb/>
            As true to fact. and of as potent spell, <lb/>
            To freeze thy blood, and harrow every nerve.— <lb n="115"/>
            Nor wrong th' attempt. Were mortal man assured <lb/>
            Eternal death would close this life of woe, <lb/>
            And nought remain of curse beyond the grave, <lb/>
            E'en then religion half its force would lose ; <lb/>
            Vice no alarm, and virtue feel no hope. <lb n="120"/>
            But, whilst the converse frights him, man will dread <lb/>
            Eternal pain, and flee from impious deeds. <lb/>
            Yet doubtful is the doctrine, and unknown <lb/>
            Whether, co-eval with th' external frame, <lb/>
            The soul first lives, when lives the body first, <lb n="125"/>
            Or boasts a date anterior: whether doomed <lb/>
            To common ruin, and one common grave, <lb/>
            Or through the gloomy shades, the lakes, the caves, <lb/>
            Of EREBUS to wander: or, perchance, <lb/>
            As ENNIUS taught, immortal bard, whose brows <lb n="130"/>
            Unfading laurels bound, and still whose verse <lb/>
            All Rome recites, entranced -perchance condemned <lb/>
            The various tribes of brutes, with ray divine, <lb/>
            To animate and quicken: though the bard, <lb/>
            In deathless melody, has elsewhere sung <lb n="135"/>
            Of ACHERUSIAN temples, where, nor soul <lb/>
            Nor body dwells, but images of men, <lb/>
            Mysterious shaped; in wondrous measure wan. <lb/>
            Here HOMER'S spectre roamed, of endless fame <lb/>
            Possest: his briny tears the bard surveyed, <lb n="140"/>

          <p>Such are the various creeds of men. And hence <lb/>
            The philosophic sage is called t' explain, <lb/>
            Not the mere phases of the heavens alone, <lb/>
            The sun's bright path, the moon's perpetual change. <lb n="145"/>

            Meet for the subject; to dispel each shade, <lb/>
            And bid the mystic doctrine hail the day. <lb/>
            For shades there are, and terrors of the soul, <lb/>
            The day can ne'er disperse, though blazing strong <lb/>
            With all the sun's bright javelins. These alone <lb n="165"/>
            To Nature yield, and Reason; and, combined, <lb/>
            This is the precept they for ever teach, <lb/>
            That NOUGHT FROM NOUGHT BY POWER DIVINE HAS RISEN. <lb/>
            But the blind fear, the superstition vain <lb/>
            Of mortals uninformed, when spring, perchance, <lb n="170"/>
            In heaven above, or earth's sublunar scene, <lb/>

            Admit this truth, that NOUGHT FROM NOTHING SPRINGS, <lb/>
            And all is clear. Developed, then, we trace, <lb n="175"/>
            Through Nature's boundless realm, the rise of things. <lb/>
            Their modes, and powers innate; nor need from heaven <lb/>

            </note>With foreign fruit: and all things all things yield. <lb/>
            Whence but from elemental seeds that act <lb n="190"/>
            With truth, and power precise, can causes spring <lb/>
            Powerful and true themselves ? But grant such seeds, <lb/>
            And all, as now, through Nature's wide domain, <lb/>
            In time predicted, and predicted place, <lb/>
            Must meet the day concordant; must assume <lb n="195"/>
            The form innately stampt, and prove alone <lb/>
            Why all from all things never can proceed.</p>
          <p>Whence does the balmy rose possess the spring ? <lb/>
            The yellow grain the summer ? or, the vine <lb/>
            With purple clusters, cheer th' autumnal hours ? <lb n="200"/>
            Whence, true to time, if such primordial seeds <lb/>
            Act not harmonious, can aught here surveyed, <lb/>
            Aught in its season, rear its tender form, <lb/>
            And the glad earth protrude it to the day ? <lb/>
            But, if from nought things rise, then each alike, <lb n="205"/>
            In every spot, at every varying month, <lb/>
            Must spring discordant; void of primal seeds <lb/>
            To check all union till th' allotted hour.</p>
          <p>Nor space for growth would then be needful: all <lb/>
            Springing from nought, and still from nought supplied. <lb n="210"/>
            The puny babe would start abrupt to man; <lb/>
            And trees umbrageous, crowned with fruit mature, <lb/>
            Burst, instant, from the greensward. But such facts <lb/>
            Each day opposes; and, opposing, proves <lb/>
            That all things gradual swell from seeds defined, <lb n="215"/>
            Of race and rank observant, and intent <lb/>
            T' evince th' appropriate matter whence they thrive.</p>
          <p>. But matter thus appropriate, or e'en space <lb/>
            For growth mature, form not the whole required. <lb/>
            The timely shower from heaven must add benign <lb n="220"/>
            Its influence too, ere yet the teeming earth <lb/>
            Emit her joyous produce; or, the ranks <lb/>
            Of man and reptile, thence alone sustained, <lb/>
            May spring to life, and propagate their kinds. <lb/>
            Say rather, then, in much that meets the view, <lb n="225"/>
            That various powers combine, concordant all, <lb/>
            Common and elemental, as in words <lb/>
            Such elemental letters,-than contend, <lb/>
            That void of genial atoms, aught exists. <pb n="309"/>

            Or live o'er lapsing ages victor still ? <lb/>
            Why, but because primordial matter, fixt <lb/>
            And limited in act, to all is dealt <lb n="235"/>
            Of things created, whence their forms expand. <lb/>
            And hence again we learn, and prove express, <lb/>
            Nought springs from nought, and that, from seeds precise, <lb/>

          <p>Mark how the cultured soil the soil excels <lb n="240"/>

            And subjugates the sod, exert their power, <lb/>
            And swell the harvest: else, spontaneous, all <lb n="245"/>
            Would still ascend by labour unimproved.</p>
          <p>And as from nought the genial seeds of things <lb/>
            Can never rise, so Nature that dissolves <lb/>
            Their varying forms, to nought can ne'er reduce.</p>
          <p>Were things destructible throughout, then all <lb n="250"/>
            Abrupt would perish, passing from the sight; <lb/>
            Nor foreign force be wanting to disjoin <lb/>

            The deep supply ? or, ether feed the stars ? <lb n="265"/>
            Whatever could perish, ever-during time, <lb/>
            And rolling ages, must have long destroyed. <lb/>
            But if, through rolling ages, and the lapse <lb/>
            Of ever-during time, still firm at base, <lb/>
            Material things have stood, then must that base <pb n="310"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Exist immortal, and the fates defy. <lb n="270"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus, too, the same efficient force applied <lb/>
            Alike must all things rupture, if, within, <lb/>
            No substance dwelled eternal to maintain <lb/>
            In close, and closer, links their varying bonds. <lb n="275"/>
            E'en the least touch,-for every cause alike <lb/>
            Must break their textures, equal in effect, <lb/>
            If no imperishable power opposed,- <lb/>
            E'en touch were then irrevocable death. <lb/>
            But since, with varying strength, the seeds within <lb n="280"/>
            Adhere, of form precise, and prove express <lb/>
            Their origin eternal,-free from ill, <lb/>
            And undivided must those forms endure, <lb/>
            Till some superior force the compact cleave. <lb/>
            Thus things to nought dissolve not; but, subdued, <lb n="285"/>
            Alone return to elemental seeds.</p>
          <p>When, on the bosom of maternal EARTH, <lb/>
            His showers redundant genial ETHER pours, <lb/>
            The dulcet drops seem lost: but harvests rise, <lb/>
            Jocund and lovely; and, with foliage fresh, <lb n="290"/>
            Smiles every tree, and bends beneath its fruit. <lb/>
            Hence man and beast are nourished ; hence overflow <lb/>
            Our joyous streets with crowds of frolic youth; <lb/>
            And with fresh songs th' umbrageous groves resound. <lb/>
            Hence the herds fatten, and repose at ease, <lb n="295"/>
            O'er the gay meadows, their unwieldy forms; <lb/>
            While from each full-distended udder drops <lb/>
            The candid milk spontaneous; and hence, too, <lb/>
            With tottering footsteps, o'er the tender grass, <lb/>
            Gambol their wanton young, each little heart <lb n="300"/>
            Quivering beneath the genuine nectar quaffed.</p>
          <p>So nought can perish, that the sight surveys, <lb/>
            With utter death; but Nature still renews <lb/>
            Each from the other, nor can form afresh <lb/>
            One substance, till another be destroyed. <lb n="305"/>
            </p>
          <p>But come, my friend, and, since the muse has sung <lb/>
            Things cannot spring from, or return to nought, <lb/>
            Lest thou should'st urge, still sceptic, that no eye <lb/>
            Their generative atoms e'er has traced ; <lb/>
            Mark in what scenes thyself must own, perforce, <lb n="310"/>

            </note>And, first, th' excited wind torments the deep ; Wrecks the tough bark, and tears the shivering clouds: <lb/>
            Now, with wide whirlwind, prostrating alike <lb/>
            O'er the waste champaign, trees, and bending blade; <lb n="315"/>
            And now, perchance, with forest-rending force, <lb/>
            Rocking the mighty mountains on their base. <lb/>
            So vast its fury !—But that fury flows <lb/>
            Alone from viewless atoms, that, combined, <lb/>
            Thus form the fierce tornado, raging wild <lb n="320"/>
            O'er heaven, and earth, and ocean's dread domain. <lb/>
            As when a river, down its verdant banks <lb/>
            Soft-gliding, sudden from the mountains round <lb/>
            Swells with the rushing rain-the placid stream <lb/>
            All limit loses, and, with furious force, <lb n="325"/>
            In its resistless tide, bears down, at once, <lb/>
            Shrubs, shattered trees, and bridges, weak alike <lb/>
            Before the tumbling torrent: such its power !— <lb/>
            Loud roars the raging flood, and triumphs still, <lb/>
            O'er rocks, and mounds, and all that else contends. <lb n="330"/>
            So roars th' enraged wind: so, like a flood, <lb/>
            Where'er it aims, before its mighty tide, <lb/>
            Sweeps all created things : or round, and round, <lb/>
            In its vast vortex curls their tortured forms.- <lb/>
            Though viewless, then, the matter thus that acts, <lb n="335"/>
            Still there is matter: and, to Reason's ken, <lb/>
            Conspicuous as the visual texture traced <lb/>
            In the wild wave that emulates its strength.</p>
          <p>Next, what keen eye e'er followed, in their course, <lb/>
            The light-winged ODOURS ? or developed clear <lb n="340"/>
            The mystic forms of cold, or heat intense ? <lb/>
            Or sound through ether fleeting ?-yet, though far <lb/>
            From human sight removed, by all confessed <lb/>

            But matter; or, in turn, be touched itself.</p>
          <p>Thus, too, the garment that along the shore, <lb/>
            Lashed by the main, imbibes the briny dew, <lb/>
            Dries in the sunbeam : but, alike unseen, <lb/>

          <p>A thousand proofs spring up. The ring that decks <lb/>
            The fair one's finger, by revolving years, <lb n="355"/>
            Wastes imperceptibly. The dropping shower <lb/>
            Scoops the rough rock. The plough's attempered share <lb/>
            Decays: and the thick pressure of the crowd, <lb/>
            Incessant passing, wears the stone-paved street. <lb/>
            E'en the gigantic forms of solid brass, <lb n="360"/>

            All lose, we view, by friction, their extent; <lb/>
            But, in what time, what particles they lose, <lb n="365"/>
            This envious Nature from our view conceals.</p>
          <p>Thus, too, both Time and Nature give to things <lb/>
            A gradual growth: but never yet the sight <lb/>
            That gradual growth explored ; nor marked their fall, <lb/>

            Loaded with brine, the caustic wave dissolves.- <lb/>
            So fine the particles that form the world.</p>
          <p>Yet not corporeal is the whole produced <lb/>
            By Nature. In created things exists, <lb n="375"/>
            Search where thou wilt, an INCORPOREAL VOID. <lb/>
            This mark, and half philosophy is thine. <lb/>
            Doubtful no longer shalt thou wander: taught <lb/>
            Th' entire of things, and by our verse convinced. <lb/>
            And know this VOID is SPACE UNTOUCHED and PURE. <lb n="380"/>
            </p>
          <p>Were SPACE like this vouchsafed not, nought could move: <lb/>
            Corporeal forms would still resist, and strive <lb/>
            With forms corporeal, nor consent to yield; <lb/>
            While the great progress of creation ceased. <lb/>
            But what more clear in earth or heaven sublime, <lb n="385"/>
            Or the vast ocean, than, in various modes, <lb/>
            That various matter moves ? which, but for SPACE, <lb/>
            'Twere vain t' expect: and vainer yet to look <lb/>
            For procreative power, educing still <lb/>
            Kinds from their kinds through all revolving time. <lb n="390"/>
            </p>
          <p>True, things are solid deemed: but know that those <pb n="313"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Deemed so the most are rare and unconjoined. <lb/>
            From rocks, and caves, translucent lymph distils, <lb/>
            And, from the tough bark, drops the healing balm. <lb/>
            The genial meal, with mystic power, pervades <lb n="395"/>
            Each avenue of life; and the grove swells, <lb/>
            And yields its various fruit, sustained alone <lb/>
            From the pure food propelled through root and branch. <lb/>
            Sound pierces marble; through reclusest walls <lb/>
            The bosom-tale transmits: and the keen frost <lb n="400"/>
            E'en to the marrow winds its sinuous way.- <lb/>
            Destroy all vacuum, then, close every pore, <lb/>
            And, if thou canst, for such events account.</p>
          <p>Say, why of equal bulk, in equal scale, <lb/>
            Are things oft found unequal in their poise ? <lb n="405"/>
            O'er the light wool the grosser lead prevails <lb/>
            With giant force. But were th' amount alike <lb/>
            Of matter each contained, alike the weight <lb/>
            Would prove perpetual: for, from matter sole, <lb/>
            Flows weight, and moment, ever prone to earth: <lb n="410"/>
            While vacant space nor weight nor moment knows. <lb/>
            Where things surpoise, then, though of equal bulk, <lb/>
            There MATTER most resides: but where ascends <lb/>
            The beam sublime, the rising substance holds <lb/>
            A smaller share, and larger leaves the VOID. <lb n="415"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hence draws the sage his creed: in all produced <lb/>
            Finds vacuum still, and calls that vacuum SPACE.</p>
          <p>But some there are such doctrines who deny: <lb/>
            And urge in proof, deceptive, that we wave <lb/>
            Not through imagined pores admits the race <lb n="420"/>
            With glittering scales-but yields at once, and opes <lb/>
            The liquid path ; and occupies, in turn, <lb/>
            The space behind the aureat fish deserts. <lb/>
            Thus, too, that all things act: the spot possessed <lb/>
            Exchanging sole, while each continues full. <lb n="425"/>
            Believe them not. If nought of space the wave <lb/>
            Give to its gilded tenants, how, resolve, <lb/>
            Feel they the power t' advance ? and if t' advance <lb/>
            They know not, how can, next, the wave thus yield ?— <lb/>
            Or matter ne'er can move, then, or within <lb n="430"/>
            Some VOID must mix through all its varying forms, <lb/>
            Whence springs alone the power of motion first. <pb n="314"/>

            Hence deem they matter pervious all, and void <lb/>
            Of solid substance. But attend, benign, <lb/>
            And, since right reason, and the frame of things <pb n="317"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Demand the verse, the muse shall briefly prove <lb/>
            The seeds, the principles of matter all <lb n="555"/>
            Both solid, and eternal, whence alone <lb/>
            Springs the stupendous fabric of the world.</p>
          <p>Of SPACE, of MATTER, as already sung, <lb/>
            Th' ENTIRE of things consists, by nature formed <lb/>
            Distinct and adverse; and existing pure <lb n="560"/>
            Each uncontrolled of each. Where matter dwells <lb/>
            Void space can ne'er be found, nor matter found, <lb/>
            Search where thou wilt, where space resides and reigns. <lb/>
            As space is vacant then, material seeds <lb/>
            Must solid prove, perforce, and free from void. <lb n="565"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus, too, as vacuum dwells in all produced, <lb/>
            Some solid substance must that vacuum bound: <lb/>
            Nor aught of vacuum can created things <lb/>
            Be proved to enclose, if solids not exist, <lb/>
            Whose power alone can such enclosures form. <lb n="570"/>
            But solids must be matter; the prime seeds <lb/>
            Of all surveyed, harmonious in their act, <lb/>
            And undecayed when all decays around.</p>
          <p>Were there no space, th' ENTIRE OF THINGS would prove <lb/>
            One boundless solid : and were nought conceived <lb n="575"/>
            Of viewless seeds, close filling, void of space, <lb/>
            Each spot possest, all then were vacuum blank. <lb/>
            Thus each from each, from matter space exists <lb/>
            Distinct and clear: since never all is void, <lb/>
            Nor ever full; but this from that preserved <lb n="580"/>
            By countless atoms acting though unseen. <lb/>
            These, as already sung, no powers can pierce: <lb/>
            O'er blows external, 9'er each vain attempt <lb/>
            Of penetrative solvents, or aught else <lb/>
            Philosophy reveals, triumphant still. <lb n="585"/>
            For nought can break, of vacuum all devoid, <lb/>
            Or melt, or moulder, or within admit <lb/>
            Vapour, or cold, or power of pungent heat, <lb/>
            By which dissolves this fabric of the world. <lb/>
            'Tis vacuum lays the base: as this exists, <lb n="590"/>
            Augments, or lessens, things alone decay. <lb/>
            What then is solid, and from vacuum free, <lb/>
            Must undecayed, and still eternal live.</p>
          <p>Were matter not eternal, ages since <pb n="318"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I <lb/>
            </note>All had returned to nothing whence it sprang, <lb n="595"/>
            And from that nothing all again revived. <lb/>
            But since from nothing nought can ever rise, <lb/>
            As proved above, nor aught to nothing shrink, <lb/>
            Seeds there must be of ever-during date, <lb/>
            To which, perpetual, things dissolve, or whence <lb n="600"/>
            Flows the fresh pabulum that all repairs. <lb/>
            But seeds thus simple must be solid too; <lb/>
            Else unpreserved through countless ages past, <lb/>
            And useless to recruit th' exhausted world.</p>
          <p>Else friction, too, had injured: each by each <lb n="605"/>
            Through myriad years abraded, and reduced, <lb/>
            Till nought conceptible had lived to rear, <lb/>
            Each in its time, the progenies of earth: <lb/>
            For all is wasted easier than renewed. <lb/>
            And hence, had all been thus disturbed, dissolved, <lb n="610"/>
            And frittered through the long anterior lapse <lb/>
            Of countless ages, future time in vain <lb/>
            Would strive the ruined fragments to repair. <lb/>
            But what more obvious than that bounds exist <lb/>
            To matter decompounding, primal seeds <lb n="615"/>
            To forms defined coercing; since again <lb/>
            All springs to birth, harmonious, kinds from kinds, <lb/>
            True to their times, and perfect in their powers ?</p>
          <p>Yet, though the principles of matter thus <lb/>
            Prove firm and solid, its component forms, <lb n="620"/>
            As air, earth, vapour, or translucent stream, <lb/>
            May still be soft and pliant, as combined, <lb/>
            E'en from their birth, with less, or larger void. <lb/>
            But had those principles themselves been reared <lb/>
            Pliant and soft, then whence the sturdy steel, <lb n="625"/>
            The close-compacted flint, or aught besides, <lb/>
            Of equal texture, traced through Nature's realm ? <lb/>
            Thus simple solids must be still contest; <lb/>
            And all be soft, or rigid, as of these <lb/>
            In more or less concentrate mode composed. <lb n="630"/>
            </p>
          <p>To all has Nature given a bound precise <lb/>
            Of being and perfection ; and promulged, <lb/>
            To every varying rank, her varying laws; <lb/>
            Urging to this, from that restraining firm. <lb/>
            Nought suffers change: the feathery tribes of heaven <pb n="319"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Bear, on their glossy plumes, through every class, <lb n="635"/>
            The same fixt hues that first those classes stamped. <lb/>
            Hence matter too, through all its primal steels, <lb/>
            Is proved immutable: for if, o'ercome <lb/>
            By aught of foreign force, those seeds could change, <lb n="640"/>
            All would be doubtful; nor the mind conceive <lb/>
            What might exist, or what might never live: <lb/>
            Nor why, decide, such variance in their powers, <lb/>
            And final terms of life, or instinct strong, <lb/>
            Through every age, still urging every race <lb n="645"/>
            To each pursuit, each action of their sires.</p>
          <p>Know, too, each seed, each substance is composed <lb/>
            Of points extreme no sense can e'er detect: <lb/>
            Points that, perforce, minutest of themselves, <lb/>
            To parts can ne'er divide: nor self-educed, <lb n="650"/>
            Nor, but as formed, existing, else destroyed. <lb/>
            Parts such can hold not: each the first, pure part, <lb/>
            Itself, of other substance: which, when joined <lb/>
            Alone by kindred parts, in order due, <lb/>
            Forms, from such junction, the prime seeds of things. <lb n="655"/>
            But e'en such parts, though by the mind as parts <lb/>
            Conceived, disjoined can ne'er exist; and thence <lb/>
            Adhere by firm, indissoluble bond.</p>
          <p>Thus seeds are simple solids, formed compact <lb/>
            Of points extreme, that never can recede : <lb n="660"/>
            Not lab'ring jointly to produce some end, <lb/>
            But potent from simplicity alone, <lb/>
            And hence eternal: equally unprone <lb/>
            To waste or sever; and by nature kept <lb/>
            To feed the suffering fabric of the world. <lb n="665"/>
            </p>
          <p>Di i no such points exist, extreme and least, <lb/>
            Each smallest atom would be, then, combined <lb/>
            Of parts all infinite; for every part <lb/>
            Parts still would boast, dividing without end. <lb/>
            And, say, what difference could there, then, subsist <lb n="670"/>
            'Twixt large and small ? for though th' ENTIRE OF things <lb/>
            Should infinite be deemed, each smallest speck <lb/>
            Still parts as infinite would hold embraced. <lb/>
            But since at this the reasoning mind revolts, <lb/>
            Then must it own, overpowered, that points exist <lb n="675"/>
            Least by their nature, and of parts devoid: <pb n="320"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>And solid, hence, and of eternal date.</p>
          <p>Hence seeds arise, the last, least parts conceived <lb/>
            Of actual being: the extremest points <lb/>
            To which creative Nature all resolves. <lb n="680"/>
            Which, if not least, if still of parts possest, <lb/>
            Could ne'er, with close exactitude, renew <lb/>
            The universal frame: all, all would rise <lb/>
            Of weight diverse, and ever varying form, <lb/>
            Casual in tie, in motion undefined. <lb n="685"/>
            </p>
          <p>Yet should we grant that matter, without end, <lb/>
            For ever wastes; e'en then, from earliest time, <lb/>
            Some matter must have triumphed undecayed, <lb/>
            Cohering still: but what can thus cohere, <lb/>
            What brave the unnumbered repercussions felt <lb n="690"/>
            Through ages now evolved, can ne'er decay: <lb/>
            Alike the future conquering as the past.</p>
          <p>Hence those who deem the fabric of the world <lb/>
            Educed from FIRE, itself the source of all, <lb/>
            Far wander from the truth. Thus deemed the sage, <lb n="695"/>
            Chief of his sect, and fearless in the fight, <lb/>
            Famed HERACLITUS ; by the learn'd esteemed <lb/>
            Of doubtful phrase, mysterious; but revered <lb/>
            By crowds of GRECIANS, flimsy, and untaught. <lb/>
            For such th' obscure applaud; delighted most <lb n="700"/>
            With systems dark, and most believing true <lb/>
            The silver sounds that charm th' enchanted ear. <lb/>
            But whence, I ask, if all from FIRE proceed <lb/>
            Unmixed and simple, spring created things <lb/>
            So various in their natures ? Urge not here <lb n="705"/>
            That fire condenses now, and now expands; <lb/>
            For if the same, divided or entire, <lb/>
            Its parts condensed a heat can only prove <lb/>
            More fierce; and less when rarefied, and thin. <lb/>
            Still all is FIRE. Nor canst thou e'er conceive <lb n="710"/>
            From fire that aught can spring but fire itself. <lb/>
            Much less, in fire made dense alone, or rare, <lb/>
            Trace the vast variance of created things. <lb/>
            Dense, too, and rare a vacuum must imply, <lb/>
            As urged already; yet full well convinced <lb n="715"/>
            What straits surround them if a void exist, <lb/>
            Such sages doubt, but, doubting, still deny: <pb n="321"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Fearful of danger, yet averse from truth. <lb/>
            Such, too, reflect not that from things create, <lb/>
            Should void withdraw, the whole at once were den.e, <lb n="720"/>
            One solid substance all, and unempowered <lb/>
            Aught from itself t' eject, as light, and smoke <lb/>
            Flies from the purple flame; evincing clear <lb/>
            Its parts unsolid, and commixt with void. <lb/>
            But should it still, perchance, be urged, that fires <lb n="725"/>
            Perish by junction, and their substance change, <lb/>
            Then must that changing substance waste to nought; <lb/>
            And thus from nought th' ENTIRE of nature spring. <lb/>
            For what once changes, by the change alone <lb/>
            Subverts immediate its anterior life. <lb n="730"/>
            But still, victorious, something must exist, <lb/>
            Or all to nought would perish; and, in turn, <lb/>
            From nought regerminate to growth mature.</p>
          <p>Yet though, most certain, things there are exist <lb/>
            That never change, the seeds of all surveyed, <lb n="735"/>
            Whose presence, absence, or arrangement new <lb/>
            That ALL new-models, certain 'tis, alike, <lb/>
            Those seeds can ne'er be FIRE. For what avails <lb/>
            Such absence, presence, or arrangement new <lb/>
            Of igneous matter, if the whole throughout <lb n="740"/>
            Alike be igneous ? Change howe'er it may, <lb/>
            Through every variance all must still be flame.— <lb/>
            Ask'st thou whence fire proceeds then ? As I deem, <lb/>
            From certain seeds to certain motions urged, <lb/>
            Or forms, or combinations; which, when changed, <lb n="745"/>
            Change too their nature ; and, though yielding fire, <lb/>
            Not fire resembling, or aught else perceived <lb/>
            By human sense, or tangible to touch.</p>
          <p>To hold, moreover, as HERACLITUS held, <lb/>
            That all is fire, and nought besides exists <lb n="750"/>
            Through Nature's boundless fabric, is to rave. <lb/>
            T' oppose the mental sense, erroneous oft, <lb/>
            To sense external, whence all knowledge flows, <lb/>
            And whence himself first traced that flame exists. <lb/>
            To sense he trusts, when sense discloses fire, <lb n="755"/>
            And yet distrusts in things disclosed as clear. <lb/>
            Can there, in man, be conduct more absurd ! — <lb/>
            Where shall we turn us ? Where, if thus we fly <note type="footnote">XI </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            Those senses chief that sever true from false ?—</p>
          <p>Why, rather, too, should all that else exists <lb n="760"/>
            Be thus denied, and fire alone maintained, <lb/>
            Than fire denied, and all maintained besides ? <lb/>
            Tenets alike preposterous and wild. <lb/>
            Hence those, in FIRE, who trace the rise of things, <lb/>
            And nought but FIRE; or those for AIR who strive <lb n="765"/>
            As source of all; or those the dimpling STREAM <lb/>
            Who fondly fancy; or the ponderous EARTH, <lb/>
            For each has armed its champions in its turn, <lb/>
            Alike wide wander from unerring truth.</p>
          <p>Nor wanders less the sage who AIR with FIRE <lb n="770"/>
            Would fain commix, or limpid STREAM with EARTH; <lb/>
            Or those the whole who join, FIRE, ETHER, EARTH, <lb/>
            And pregnant SHOWERS, and thence the world deduce. <lb/>
            Thus sung EMPEDOCLES, in honest fame <lb/>
            First of his sect; whom AGRIGENTUM bore <lb n="775"/>
            In cloud-capt SICILY. Its sinuous shores <lb/>
            Th' IONIAN main, with hoarse, unwearied wave, <lb/>
            Surrounds, and sprinkles with its briny dew: <lb/>
            And, fromthe fair ÆOLIAN fields, divides <lb/>
            With narrow frith that spurns the impetuous surge. <lb n="780"/>
            Here vast CHARYBDIS raves: here ÆTNA rears <lb/>
            His infant thunders, his dread jaws unlocks, <lb/>
            And heaven and earth with fiery ruin threats. <lb/>
            Here many a wonder, many a scene sublime, <lb/>
            As on he journeys, checks the traveller's steps ; <lb n="785"/>
            And shows, at once, a land in harvests rich, <lb/>
            And rich in sages of illustrious fame. <lb/>
            But nought so wonderous, so illustrious nought, <lb/>
            So fair, so pure, so lovely, can it boast, <lb/>
            EMPEDOCLES, as thou ! whose song divine, <lb n="790"/>
            By all rehearsed, so clears each mystic lore, <lb/>
            That scarce mankind believed thee born of man. <lb/>
            Yet e'en EMPEDOCLES, and those above, <lb/>
            Already sung, of far inferior fame, <lb/>
            Though doctrines frequent from their bosoms flowed <lb n="795"/>
            Like inspiration, sager and more true <lb/>
            Than e'er the PYTHIAN maid, with laurels crowned, <lb/>
            Spoke from the tripod at APOLLO'S shrine; <lb/>
            E'en these mistook the principles of things, <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>And greatly wandered in attempt so great. <lb n="800"/>
            And, first, they deemed that motion might exist <lb/>
            From VOID exempt: that things might still be rare, <lb/>
            Still soften, as earth, ether, fire, or fruits, <lb/>
            Or e'en the ranks of animated life, <lb/>
            Though VOID commixed not with their varying frames. <lb n="805"/>
            Then, too, they held no final term ordained <lb/>
            To comminuting atoms: which, through time, <lb/>
            Still crumbled on, and never could be least. <lb/>
            Though from such points as sense itself surveys, <lb/>
            Extreme and least, conjecture we may form <lb n="810"/>
            Of points extreme, impalpable to sight, <lb/>
            Least in themselves, that never can divide.</p>
          <p>With them, moreover, the seeds of things were formed <lb/>
            Soft, and unsolid: but whatever is soft, <lb/>
            Whatever unsolid, as at first they spring <lb n="815"/>
            From other substance, must perforce decay. <lb/>
            So all to nought would perish, and again <lb/>
            From nought regerminate to growth mature: <lb/>
            Doctrines the muse already has disproved. <lb/>
            Such seeds, too, must be foes; created each <lb n="820"/>
            To each adverse ; and hence can never meet <lb/>
            But sure perdition waits: or, chance, they part, <lb/>
            Disperst abrupt, as, in contending storms, <lb/>
            Wind, rain, and thunder scatter, and are lost.</p>
          <p>But, from such four-fold foes, could all things spring, <lb n="825"/>
            And, sprung, to such dissolve-why rather term <lb/>
            Those jarring powers the primal seeds of things, <lb/>
            Than things of them ? since, in alternate course, <lb/>
            Each flows from each: th' alternate form is seized, <lb/>
            Th' alternate nature, through perennial time. <lb n="830"/>
            Yet could'st thou deem such powers adverse might blend, <lb/>
            And earth with fire, with ether lymph commix, <lb/>
            And still retain their natures unimpaired; <lb/>
            Whilst thus retained, no living form could rise <lb/>
            Traced through creation, animate, or void, <lb n="835"/>
            As springs the verdant shrub, of reasoning soul. <lb/>
            For each its nature, through the varying mass, <lb/>

            </note>Mutual they gender, must, perforce, assume <lb n="840"/>
            An unobtrusive nature, close concealed, <lb/>
            Lest aught superior rise, of power adverse, <lb/>
            And thus th' harmonious union be destroyed.</p>
          <p>Such sages, too, from heaven, and heaven's bright fires <lb/>
            Maintain that all proceeds: that fire drawn hence <lb n="846"/>
            Converts to ether, ether into showers, <lb/>
            And showers benign to earth: and hence again, <lb/>
            That all from earth returns: first liquid dew, <lb/>
            Then air, and heat conclusive; changing thus, <lb n="850"/>
            In ceaseless revolution, changing thus <lb/>
            From heaven to earth, from earth to heaven sublime: <lb/>
            A change primordial seeds could ne'er sustain. <lb/>
            So something still must, void of change, exist; <lb/>
            Or all would perish, all to nought return ; <lb n="855"/>
            For what once changes, by the change alone <lb/>
            Subverts immediate its anterior life. <lb/>
            Since, then, as sung above, these all commute <lb/>
            Each into each, some seeds must still be owned <lb/>
            That ne'er can change, or all to nought would waste. <lb n="860"/>
            Hold rather, then, such seeds exist, endowed <lb/>
            With powers so curious that, as now combined, <lb/>
            If fire they form, combine them but anew, <lb/>
            Add, or deduct, give motion, or subtract, <lb/>
            And all is air; and changing thus, and changed, <lb n="865"/>
            That things from things perpetual take their rise.</p>
          <p>Nor urge, still sceptic, that each hour displays <lb/>
            All life protruded from the genial EARTH: <lb/>
            Fed by the balmy AIR; by heaven's own FIRE <lb/>
            Matured ; and saved from pestilence and death <lb n="870"/>
            Alone by SHOWERS benignant: and that hence <lb/>
            Man, beast, and herbs alike exist, and thrive. <lb/>
            The fact we own : we own from solid food, <lb/>
            And crystal streams, man draws his daily breath, <lb/>
            Of nerve, of bone, of being else deprived: <lb n="875"/>
            But, owning, add, the compounds meet for man, <lb/>
            For brute, for herbage, differ in their kinds, <lb/>
            By different tastes discerned: and differ thus, <lb/>
            And only thus, as formed from various seeds, <lb/>
            To all things common, but in various modes <lb n="880"/>
            Combined, and fitted to each rising want. <pb n="325"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Nor small of import are the modes diverse <lb/>
            In which those seeds approach, recede, or blend: <lb/>
            Since heaven, and earth, and suns, and seas immense, <lb/>
            Herbs, instinct, reason, all are hence derived: <lb n="885"/>
            The mode but changed, the matter still the same. <lb/>
            Thus, though the lines, these doctrines that recite, <lb/>
            Flow from the same fixt elemental types, <lb/>
            Yet line from line, in sense, in sound compared, <lb/>
            Egregious differs. Re-arranged alone, <lb n="890"/>
            Such the vast power by graphic types possest ! <lb/>
            Start not when told, then, that the seeds of things <lb/>
            Boast powers superior, and can all create.</p>
          <p>From such mistakes, detected and exposed, <lb/>
            Now turn we: and in order next survey <lb n="895"/>
            Those docrines first the GRECIAN schools imbibed <lb/>
            From sapient ANAXAGORAS, by them <lb/>
            Termed HOMŒOMERY ; a phrase ourselves, <lb/>
            In tongue deficient, never can translate. <lb/>
            But these its institutes: that bone from bones, <lb n="900"/>
            Minute, and embryon, nerve from nerves arise, <lb/>
            And blood from blood, by countless drops increased. <lb/>
            Gold, too, from golden atoms, earths concrete <lb/>
            From earths extreme; from fiery matters fire, <lb/>
            And lymph from limpid dew. And thus throughout <lb n="905"/>
            From primal kinds that kinds perpetual spring. <lb/>
            Yet VOID he granted not in aught create, <lb/>
            Nor POINTS EXTREME that never can divide. <lb/>
            In both erroneous, and with those deceived <lb/>
            Classed in our numbers, and opposed above. <lb n="910"/>
            </p>
          <p>Too feeble, too, the rudiments he chose, <lb/>
            If rudiments they be, that hold, at once, <lb/>
            The powers of things, and form the things themselves. <lb/>
            All toil alike, and perish void of aid: <lb/>
            For, when the hour of dissolution draws, <lb n="915"/>
            Say, which can baffle the dread fangs of death ? <lb/>
            Can ether, lymph, or fire ? can nerve, or bones ? <lb/>
            In each the strife were vain: since all produced, <lb/>
            Surveyed, or viewless, impotent alike, <lb/>
            Must yield to fate, and perish unredeemed. <lb n="920"/>
            But things produced to nought can never fall, <lb/>
            Or fallen, regerminate, as proved above. <pb n="326"/>

            </note>Food rears the body, and its growth sustains: But well we know its tendons, nerves, and blood, <lb/>
            Hence all matured, are foreign and unlike. <lb n="925"/>
            If, then, each food be compound, if commixt <lb/>
            With miniatures of all, of blood and nerve, <lb/>
            Of bone and veins; each food compact, or moist, <lb/>
            Of parts unlike must then itself consist; <lb/>
            Of bone, of blood, of tendon, vein, and nerve. <lb n="930"/>
            Thus all things spring from earth: but if in earth <lb/>
            All lurk enveloped, earth of forms consists <lb/>
            Strange, and discordant, panting for the day. <lb/>
            Change still the picture, and the same still flows: <lb/>
            In timbers, thus, if smoke, flame, ashes blend, <lb n="935"/>
            Then, too, those timbers hostile parts comprise.</p>
          <p>But, here, the ready answer, framed of yore, <lb/>
            By him, the founder of the system, springs: <lb/>
            That, though in all things all things lurk commixt, <lb/>
            What most prevails, what boasts the largest share, <lb n="940"/>
            Lies superficial, and is noticed chief. <lb/>
            Fruitless remark, unsolid, and untrue. <lb/>
            For still, at times, when crushed to dust minute <lb/>
            Beneath the pond'rous mill-stone's mighty orb <lb/>
            The crumbling corn with human blood must weep, <lb n="945"/>
            Or aught besides of fluid found in man, <lb/>
            And stain with hues obscene: and still, at times, <lb/>
            Each herb unfold the balmy milk so sweet, <lb/>
            That swells the fleecy flock, or odorous kine. <lb/>
            The furrowed glebe, the labouring plough beneath, <lb n="950"/>
            Must, too, develope, in its secret womb, <lb/>
            Plants, fruits, and foliage, oft dispersed, and hid : <lb/>
            And, to the woodman, the cleft stock disclose <lb/>
            With ashes smoke, and smoke commixt with fire. <lb/>
            These, facts deny: in things things ne'er exist; <lb n="955"/>
            But seeds of things, in various modes arranged, <lb/>
            Various themselves: whence rises all surveyed.</p>
          <p>But should'st thou urge that oft beneath the storm, <lb/>
            When rubbed by many a repercussion rude, <lb/>
            Branch against branch, the forest's topmost height <lb n="960"/>
            Has blazed from tree to tree; the fact we grant: <lb/>
            Not, with each trunk, that native fires combine: <lb/>
            But that perpetual friction quick collects <pb n="327"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Their seeds dispersed; hence gathering ten-fold force, <lb/>
            And flame engendering. For could fire itself <lb n="965"/>
            A part constituent of the forest form, <lb/>
            No hour could hide the mischief; every tree <lb/>
            Would blaze, and burn till boundless ruin reigned.</p>
          <p>See, then, as earlier sung, how much imports <lb/>
            Th' arrangement, motion, magnitude, and form <lb n="970"/>
            Of primal seeds combined: and how the same, <lb/>
            Transposed but little, fuel quick convert <lb/>
            To flame, bright blazing up the swarthy flue: <lb/>
            As FLUE and FUEL, terms of different sound, <lb/>
            Of different sense, their letters but transposed, <lb n="975"/>
            Each into each converts with magic speed.</p>
          <p>But should'st thou urge that all things still may flow <lb/>
            From primal seeds, and yet those seeds possess <lb/>
            The form, the nature of the things themselves; <lb/>
            The scheme falls self-destroyed.- For then, must seeds <lb n="980"/>
            Hold powers adverse; and laugh, and shake their sides, <lb/>
            While tears of anguish down their cheeks distil.</p>
          <p>Come, now, and mark perspicuous what remains. <lb/>
            Obscure the subject: but the thirst of fame <lb/>
            Burns all my bosom; and through every nerve <lb n="985"/>
            Darts the proud love of letters, and the muse. <lb/>
            I feel th' inspiring power; and roam resolved <lb/>
            Through paths PIERIAN never trod before. <lb/>
            Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new; <lb/>

            Those flowers to pluck, and weave a roseate wreath, <lb/>
            The muses yet to mortals ne'er have deigned. <lb/>
            With joy the subject I pursue ; and free <lb/>

            With joy th' obscure illume; in liquid verse, <lb n="995"/>

            Deceiving thus, while yet unused to guile. <lb/>
            His unsuspecting lip ; till deep he drinks, <lb/>
            And gathers vigour from the venial cheat: <lb/>
            So I, since dull the subject, and the world <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>Abashed recoils, would fain, in honeyed phrase, <lb n="1005"/>
            Tuned by the muses, to thine ear recite <lb/>
            Its vast concerns; if haply I may hope <lb/>
            To fix thine audience, while the flowing verse <lb/>
            Unfolds the nature, and the forms of things.</p>
          <p>Taught then, already that material seeds <lb n="1010"/>
            Are solid, and o'er time triumphant live, <lb/>
            Attend, benignant, while we next decide <lb/>
            Their number, or if infinite; and tell, <lb/>
            Since VOID throughout exists, assigning space <lb/>
            For place and motion, if th' ENTIRE of things <lb n="1015"/>
            Be bounded, or unfathomed, and immense.</p>
          <p>Th' ENTIRE of things, then, bounds can never know: <lb/>
            Else parts possest of farthest and extreme. <lb/>
            But parts can only be extreme, beyond <lb/>
            Where other substance springs, those parts extreme <lb n="1020"/>
            Binding, though sense the limit ne'er can trace. <lb/>
            If, then, some other substance rise, the first <lb/>
            Forms not th' ENTIRE of things. Whatever it be <lb/>
            That other substance still must part compose. <lb/>
            Vain too is distance: the vast whole alike <lb n="1025"/>
            To all extends, embracing, and embraced.</p>
          <p>Yet grant th' ENTIRE of things of bound possest. <lb/>
            Say, to what point shall yon keen archer, placed <lb/>
            E'en on its utmost verge, his dart direct ? <lb/>
            Shall aught obstruct it, or the path be clear? <lb n="1030"/>
            Take which thou wilt: some substance choose, possest <lb/>
            Of power t' impede, and check its rapid race: <lb/>
            Or let it fly unconquered, nor restraint <lb/>
            E'en once encounter: thou must still confess <lb/>
            Th' ENTIRE of nature nought of limit knows. <lb n="1035"/>
            Throughout the dart I'11 chase; and when, at length, <lb/>
            Th' acceded bound is gained, I'll still demand <lb/>
            What yet obstructs it; still new proofs adduce <lb/>
            That the vast whole is boundless; and that flight <lb/>
            Still beyond flight for ever might be urged. <lb n="1040"/>
            </p>
          <p>Were, too, th' ENTIRE of nature thus confined, <lb/>
            Thus circumscribed precise, from its own weight <lb/>
            Long since, all matter to the extremest depth <lb/>
            Had sunk supine: nor aught the skies beneath, <lb/>
            Nor skies themselves, with countless stars adorned <pb n="329"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I. <lb/>
            </note>And sun's unsuffering splendour, had remained. <lb n="1045"/>
            Down, down th' accumulated mass had fallen <lb/>
            From earliest time, devoid of power to rise. <lb/>
            But nought of rest supine material seeds <lb/>
            Evince through nature; since no depth exists <lb n="1050"/>
            Extreme, and fathomable where those seeds <lb/>
            Might fix collected in inert repose. <lb/>
            All, all is action: the vast whole alike <lb/>
            Moves in each part; and, from material seeds, <lb/>
            Draws, undiminished, its eternal food. <lb n="1055"/>
            </p>
          <p>Things, to the sense, are circumscribed by things. <lb/>
            Air bounds the hills, and hills the liquid air: <lb/>
            Earth ocean, ocean earth: but the vast whole <lb/>
            What fancied scene can bound ? O'er its broad realm, <lb/>
            Immeasured, and immeasurably spread, <lb n="1060"/>
            From age to age resplendent lightnings urge, <lb/>
            In vain their flight perpetual; distant, still, <lb/>
            And ever distant from the verge of things. Is <lb/>
            So vast the space on opening space that swells, <lb/>
            Through every part so infinite alike. <lb n="1065"/>
            </p>
          <p>Ask thy own reason. It will prove at once <lb/>
            Th' ENTIRE of nature never can have bounds. <lb/>
            VOID must perforce bound MATTER, MATTER VOID ; <lb/>
            Thus mutual, one illimitable whole <lb/>
            Forming for ever. For were each of each <lb n="1070"/>
            &gt; Free and unshackled, uncombined, and pure <lb/>
            In their own essence, not one short-lived hour <lb/>
            Could earth, or ocean, the refulgent fane <lb/>
            Of heaven sublime, or mortal forms, or those <lb/>
            The gods themselves inhabit, then subsist. <lb n="1075"/>
            Freed from all order, disarranged, and rude, <lb/>
            Through boundless vacuum the drear mass of things <lb/>
            Would quick be borne : or, rather, nought had risen <lb/>
            From the crude chaos, joyless, and inert. <lb/>
            For never, doubtless, from result of thought, <lb n="1080"/>
            Or mutual compact, could primordial seeds <lb/>
            First harmonize, or move with powers precise. <lb/>
            But ever changing, ever changed, and vext, <lb/>
            From earliest time, through ever-during space, <lb/>
            With ceaseless repercussion, every mode <lb n="1085"/>
            Of motion, magnitude, and shape essayed; <pb n="330"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I<lb/>
            </note>At length th' unwieldy mass the form assumed <lb/>
            Of things created. Persevering, thus, <lb/>
            Through many an age, unnumbered springs the deep <lb/>
            Feed with perpetual tides: by the warm sun <lb n="1090"/>
            Sustained, and cherished, earth renews her fruits, <lb/>
            And man, and beast survive; and ether glows <lb/>
            With living lights innum'rous: scenes throughout <lb/>
            'Twere vain t' expect, from all eternal time, <lb/>
            Had no primordial seeds, in stores immense, <lb n="1095"/>
            Been ever nigh to renovate the world. <lb/>
            For as, of food deprived, the languid frame <lb/>
            Of man must perish, so th* ENTIRE OF THINGS <lb/>
            Must instant cease, should once primordial seeds <lb/>
            Their aid withhold, or deviate in their course. <lb n="1100"/>
            Nor deem from mutual impulse, things with things <lb/>
            Can sole their forms preserve; th* eternal seeds <lb/>
            May, hence, be oft restrained, and e'en perchance, <lb/>
            Their flight delayed, till, from th' exhaustless store, <lb/>
            Fresh seeds arrive the fainting frame to feed: <lb n="1105"/>
            But from concussion, frequent, they rebound, <lb/>
            Dissolve all tie, and leave to transient rest <lb/>
            The common matter whence each substance springs. <lb/>
            Hence must incalculable seeds exist <lb/>
            Ceaseless in act; and the vast whole derive <lb n="1110"/>
            Alone from boundless matter impulse due.</p>
          <p>But fly, 0 MEMMIUS, fly the sect deceived, <lb/>
            Who teach that things, with gravitation firm, <lb/>
            To the vast centre of th' ENTIRE, alike, <lb/>
            Unerring press: the world who fain would prove <lb n="1115"/>
            Void of external impulse, may subsist, <lb/>
            And nought its post desert, profound, or high, <lb/>
            Since of such gravitating power possest. <lb/>
            For canst thou deem that aught may thus sustain, <lb/>
            And poise itself? that aught of solid weight, <lb n="1120"/>
            Placed at earth's utmost depth, could upwards strive <lb/>
            Reversed; and to the surface-( in the stream <lb/>

            For thus such sages hold: thus man, and beast <lb/>

            When night to us unfolds his stars, surveyed; <lb/>
            And equal measuring, in alternate course, <lb n="1130"/>
            With us, their months, their darkness, and their day. <lb/>
            Such are the specious fancies error feigns, <lb/>
            In idle hour, to minds perverse and vain. <lb/>
            Where all is infinite, what spot precise <lb/>
            Can e'er be central ? or were centre owned, <lb n="1135"/>
            Why towards such spot should matter rather tend, <lb/>
            Than elsewhere more remote, and deeper still ? <lb/>
            For vacant space, through every part alike, <lb/>
            Central or not, must yield to things compact, <lb/>
            And pond'rous, as their varying weight compels; <lb n="1140"/>
            Nor through the boundless VOID one point exists <lb/>
            Where things may rest, as if of weight deprived. <lb/>
            No power it boasts t' uphold ; but still recedes, - <lb/>
            As Nature prompts, and opes the needed path. <lb/>
            Hence, by the love alone of centre struck, <lb n="1145"/>
            Th' harmonious frame of things could ne'er be formed.</p>
          <p>Moreo'er such sages urge not that the whole <lb/>
            Strives towards the centre equal; but terrene <lb/>
            Alone, and fluid matters; the deep main, <lb/>
            The mountain cataract, and the forms produced <lb n="1150"/>
            From earth Dedalian: while the breezy air, <lb/>
            And the light flame, far from such centre stray, <lb/>
            Through ether trembling, and, with lambent fire, <lb/>
            Feeding, through time, the sun's refulgent blaze; <lb/>

            Of herbs, and trees, and animated life, <lb/>
            From her own bosom nurtured, and sustained. <lb/>
            Thus, too, they teach that heaven, with bound sublime, <lb/>

          <p>Since, then, nor wealth, nor splendour, nor the boast <lb/>

            Man pants for these from poverty of mind, <lb/>
            Wandering in darkness, and through life misled?</p>
          <p>For as the boy, when midnight veils the skies, <lb n="55"/>
            Trembles, and starts at all things, so, full oft, <lb/>
            E'en in the noon men start at forms as void <lb/>

            A terror this the radiant darts of day <lb n="60"/>

          <p>Come, then, and mark how seeds primordial form <lb/>

            Their force, their action, whence, and power to move, <lb n="65"/>
            Pass, and repass, through all th' immense of space: <lb/>
            Benign attend, while thus the muse explains.</p>

             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Indissoluble, since each gradual wastes, <lb/>
            And, in the lapse of time, flies off entire, <lb n="70"/>
            By age o'erpowered. Yet the great mass of things <lb/>
            Still meets the view uninjured, from the stores <lb/>
            Sustained of primal atoms. These, as oft <lb/>
            Their punctual flight they take, each form decrease, <lb/>
            And, as they join, augment: hence things attain <lb n="75"/>
            Their growth mature, and thence their sure decay. <lb/>
            Thus, void of rest, the changeful world renews, <lb/>
            And man on man lives mutual; nations thus <lb/>
            Flourish, or fade; a few brief years roll round, <lb/>
            And sire to son, through every reasoning rank, <lb n="80"/>
            Yields, like a racer o'er the busy course, <lb/>
            His lamp of life, and instant disappears.</p>
          <p>Who deems primordial atoms e'er can rest, <lb/>
            And, resting, urge through matter motion still, <lb/>
            Far wanders from the truth. Primordial seeds, <lb n="85"/>
            Through space unfathomed as their flight they wing, <lb/>
            From their own gravitating power must pass, <lb/>
            Or blows extrinsic; each o'er each, alike, <lb/>
            Casual prevails: for oft the mass of seeds <lb/>
            That prone descends, with seeds repugnant meet <lb n="90"/>
            In contest tough, and distant far rebound. <lb/>
            Nor wondrous this, of firmest texture formed, <lb/>
            And nought t' obstruct the retro-cursive flight. <lb/>
            And though thou trace the seeds unequal heaped <lb/>
            Of primal matter, still, reflect, th' entire <lb n="95"/>
            Knows nought of bottom, nought of spot profound <lb/>
            Where they may rest collected: space throughout <lb/>
            Boundless exists, as, in our earlier verse, <lb/>
            Decisive proved, on every side immense.</p>
          <p>Since, then, primordial seeds through space profound <lb/>
            Repose can never know: but rather, urged <lb n="101"/>
            To ceaseless motions, varying and adverse, <lb/>
            By the rude conflict part far off rebound, <lb/>
            And part with speed unite, the severing blow <lb/>
            Surmounted soon. Hence those, through trivial space <lb n="105"/>
            Briefly repelled, the vigorous bond scarce broke, <lb/>
            With quick reunion intertwining strong, <lb/>
            Form the rude base of flints, and rigid steel, <lb/>
            And matters firm alike: while those beyond, <pb n="335"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Far wandering through the void, of feebler link <lb n="110"/>
            Mutual possest, the liquid air create, <lb/>
            And the pure light the sun perpetual pours.</p>
          <p>Nor these the whole compose. For seeds there are <lb/>
            That through the boundless void for ever stray, <lb/>
            Of social bond abhorrent, and in turn <lb n="115"/>
            Refused all compact in the frame of things: <lb/>
            Not unresembling, if aright I deem. <lb/>
            Those motes minute that, when th' obtrusive sun <lb/>
            Peeps through some crevice in the shuttered shade, <lb/>
            The day-dark hall illuming, float amain <lb n="120"/>
            In his bright beam, and wage eternal war. <lb/>
            There may'st thou view them, now in crowds combine, <lb/>
            Now part discordant, o'er the restless scene <lb/>
            Urging the pigmy battle; and may'st hence <lb/>
            Learn what vast contests oft mid primal seeds, <lb n="125"/>
            Ceaseless, prevail, through boundless space propelled. <lb/>
            Thus things minute instruct us, and unfold <lb/>
            The laws, at times, of things momentous most.</p>
          <p>Such motes, moreover, and let the sage remark <lb/>
            Impress thy judgment, agitated thus <lb n="130"/>
            In the pure sun-beam, from the strife alone <lb/>
            Prove, in their primal seeds, some motion lurks <lb/>
            Unseen, and secret, whence the pigmy mass <lb/>
            Draws motion first. For oft the curious eye <lb/>
            Sees the light goss, by viewless force subdued, <lb n="135"/>
            Turn from the path selected, backwards urged, <lb/>
            Now here, now there, through every point propelled. <lb/>
            Such the perplexing power of primal seeds.</p>
          <p>From seeds all motion springs; by impulse hence <lb/>
            Through molecules minute of seeds conjoined, <lb n="140"/>
            Nearest in power, protruded, though unseen. <lb/>
            Hence urged again, in turn, through things create <lb/>
            Of ampler form, till soon the sense itself <lb/>
            The congregated action marks distinct. <lb/>
            As in the lucid beam's light woof we trace <lb n="145"/>
            Still motion visual, though unseen its source.</p>
          <p>Nor small the motive power of primal seeds. <lb/>
            This, MEMMIUS, should'st thou doubt, we thus confirm : <lb/>
            When first Aurora, o'er the dewy earth, <lb/>
            Spreads her soft light, and through the pathless grove <pb n="336"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>A thousand songsters ope their liquid throats, <lb n="150"/>
            All ether charming—sudden we survey <lb/>
            Th' effusive sun, as with a garment, deck <lb/>
            With his own radiance all created things; <lb/>
            Instant in speed, unbounded in his blaze. <lb n="155"/>
            But the bright fluid, the pure stream he throws, <lb/>
            Flows not without resistance; many a wave, <lb/>
            Through space profound, ethereal checks its flight; <lb/>
            And many a self-engendered power perverse, <lb/>
            Reared from its complex frame: perpetual hence <lb n="160"/>
            Lags the light fluid, doomed to double strife. <lb/>
            But primal atoms, firm and solid sole <lb/>
            From pure simplicity, when through void space <lb/>
            Free and unchecked their easy course they wing, <lb/>
            One in themselves, at once their goal attain. <lb n="165"/>
            Hence than the rapid light more rapid still <lb/>
            Rush they, in equal hour through ampler space <lb/>
            Urged, than the beams that gild the glowing vault. <lb/>
            No pause for council need they, no delay, <lb/>
            Nor deep research to sever right from wrong, <lb n="170"/>
            Or prove what path their duty bids pursue.</p>
          <p>Yet some there are, untaught, who dare contend <lb/>
            Primordial matter ne'er without the gods <lb/>
            Thus, in nice symmetry, to please mankind, <lb/>
            Could form th' alternate seasons, rear the fruits <lb n="175"/>
            That gladden life, or urge those gentler joys, <lb/>
            Gay PLEASURE, guide and goddess of the world, <lb/>
            Prompts in the panting breast, lest every tribe <lb/>
            Should fail on earth, the rites of Venus spurned. <lb/>
            These from the gods, as sovereign cause of all, <lb n="180"/>
            Such sophists trace, wide wandering from the truth. <lb/>
            For, though the rise of things I ne'er could prove, <lb/>
            Yet dare I, from the heaven's defective frame, <lb/>
            And many a scene alike perverse, affirm <lb/>
            No power divine this mass material reared <lb n="185"/>
            With ills so pregnant. This, in order due, <lb/>
            The muse shall full demonstrate: turn we now <lb/>
            To what of motion yet remains unsung.</p>
          <p>And here, 0 Memmius! mark this precept well; <lb/>
            That nought corporeal, of itself, can e'er <lb n="190"/>
            Ascend sublime through regions urged above. <pb n="337"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Nor let th' aspiring flame, with specious boast, <lb/>
            Heedless deceive thee. True, with upward flight, <lb/>
            E'en from the first, its spreading spires unfold ; <lb n="195"/>
            And fruits and plants their growth still upwards urge. <lb/>
            Yet as the weight by all possest, below <lb/>
            Drives all things, deem not thou, when the bright blaze <lb/>
            Flames through th' affrighted house, the crackling roof <lb/>
            Tumbling precipitate, then deem not thou <lb n="200"/>
            It mounts spontaneous but from foreign force. <lb/>
            Thus, from the wounded vein, the vital blood <lb/>
            Ascends, and pours its purple strength sublime: <lb/>
            And springs not thus the ponderous trunk immersed <lb/>
            In the clear stream, rejected by the wave ? <lb n="205"/>
            Though deep we plunge it, with redoubled force <lb/>
            Still back it bounds, and, o'er th' elastic tide, <lb/>
            Rears half its solid bulk. Yet doubt we not, <lb/>
            Spite of such facts, that all things, uncontrolled, <lb/>
            Through space tend downward. From control alone <lb n="210"/>
            The lambent flame thus mounts, towards heaven impelled, <lb/>
            Else prone from native weight. Falls not, at night, <lb/>
            The mimic star, the meteor trailing long <lb/>
            Its line of fire, whene'er, amid the gloom, <lb/>
            Th' elastic ether opes the needed path ? <lb n="215"/>
            The mid-day sun flings down his rays direct <lb/>
            And sows the fields with light: and the dread flash, <lb/>
            When thunder rends the skies, though wide it dart, <lb/>
            Now here, now there, amid the rushing rain, <lb/>
            Its forky fires-spends its chief strength on earth. <lb n="220"/>
            </p>
          <p>This, too, regard intent; that primal seeds, <lb/>
            When down direct their potent path they urge, <lb/>
            In time uncertain, and uncertain space, <lb/>
            Oft from the right decline-yet so minute <lb/>
            Veer they, no fancy less can e'er conceive. <lb n="225"/>
            Without this devious curve primordial seeds <lb/>
            Would drop successive, like the crystal shower, <lb/>
            Void of all contest, all re-active blow, 4 <lb/>
            Whence Nature sole her. world of wonders works.</p>
          <p>If, then, there be, who deem the seeds of things <lb n="230"/>
            More ponderous, as their rectilinear course <lb/>

            Through the pure air, or clear translucent wave, <lb n="235"/>
            Doubtless, all ponderous forms more swift descend; <lb/>
            This, from the variance of resistance sole, <lb/>
            Flows, by such fluids formed 'gainst things unlike, <lb/>
            The grosser quick overpowering. But pure space, <lb/>
            In every part, in every hour the same, <lb n="240"/>
            Throughout resists not, the demanded path <lb/>
            Yielding submissive. Hence, in equal time, <lb/>
            Through the blank void, unequal weights descend <lb/>
            Of every fancied variance: and hence, too, <lb/>
            The grosser ne'er the lighter urged below <lb n="245"/>
            Can gain, triumphant; or the contest rouse <lb/>
            Whence spring new motions, and all nature lives. <lb/>
            Hence doubly flows it why the seeds of things <lb/>
            Should from the right decline; yet, in degree, <lb/>
            The least conceptibly, lest we should deem <lb n="250"/>
            The line oblique which Nature ne'er assumes. <lb/>
            For nought more obvious, as the sight confirms, <lb/>
            Than that all weights, their downward course, at will <lb/>
            Steering, obliquely never can descend ; <lb/>
            But what keen sight of man can prove precise <lb n="255"/>
            That the swift cadence ne'er declines at all ? <lb/>
            Had all one motion uniform, the new <lb/>
            Th' anterior skilful copying, if throughout <lb/>
            Primordial seeds declined not, rousing hence <lb/>
            Fresh springs of action, potent to subvert <lb n="260"/>
            The bonds of fate, and break the rigid chain <lb/>
            Of cause on cause, eternal,—whence, resolve, <lb/>
            Flows through the world this freedom of the mind ? <lb/>
            This power to act, though fate the deed forbid, <lb/>
            Urged by the will alone ? The free-born mind <lb n="265"/>
            Acts, or forbears, spontaneous; its own time, <lb/>
            Its place, alike uncertain: these the will, <lb/>
            Doubtless, alone determines, and, at once, <lb/>
            Flies the fleet motion through th' assenting frame. <lb/>
            Dost thou not see, as down the barrier drops <lb n="270"/>
            That J eins the racer, instant though he dart, <lb/>
            Not half so instant darts he as his soul <lb/>
            Ambitious covets ? Deep through all his frame <lb/>
            Th' elastic nerves must first the wish convey <pb n="339"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Ere yet the consentaneous flight succeed. <lb n="275"/>
            Hence, obvious, springs all motion from the heart, <lb/>
            Roused by the mind's resolve, and instant urged <lb/>
            Through every nerve, through every quivering limb. <lb/>
            A force far different this than e'er prevails <lb/>
            When aught without coerces. Passive, then, <lb n="280"/>
            Bends all the frame th' extrinsic power beneath, <lb/>
            Borne down reluctant; till th' awakening will <lb/>
            Unchains each member, and resumes her right. <lb/>
            For oft, though foreign force, with tyrant sway, <lb/>
            Rule us, resistless, headlong hurrying down- <lb n="285"/>
            Say-lurks no adverse something in the breast <lb/>
            Proud to withstand ? full oft, at whose control, <lb/>
            Swift flows the nervous tide from limb to limb, <lb/>
            Bursting each bond-and, oft, as swift retires ? <lb/>
            Hence firm maintain we primal seeds some cause <lb n="290"/>
            Must feel of rising motion unbestowed <lb/>
            By weight, or blow reactive, whence alone <lb/>
            Upsprings this secret power by man possest: <lb/>
            Nought forming nought, as reason proves precise. <lb/>
            For weight forbids the credence that alone <lb n="295"/>
            Things by reaction move; yet, lest the mind- <lb/>
            Bend to a stern necessity within, <lb/>
            And, like a slave, determine but by force,- <lb/>
            Though urged by weight, in time, in place unfixt, <lb/>
            Each primal atom trivial still declines. <lb n="300"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor interstitial more, nor more compact, <lb/>
            Was e'er this frame of matter; nor augment <lb/>
            Primaeval seeds, nor e'er admit decay. <lb/>
            Hence every movement in anterior time <lb/>
            That e'er subsisted, still subsists the same, <lb n="305"/>
            And will through endless ages: all begot, <lb/>
            Begotten must be, punctual to their kinds, <lb/>
            Exist, increase, and perish; following firm <lb/>
            The laws by Nature framed; nor aught of power, <lb/>
            Act where it may, can change th' entire of things. <lb n="310"/>
            For nought expands of spot where primal seeds <lb/>
            From the vast whole may fly ; or e'er afresh, <lb/>
            Armed with new powers, re-enter, adverse thus <lb/>
            To Nature's plans, disorganizing all.</p>
          <p>Nor this stupendous, that, though primal seeds <note type="footnote">z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Move on incessant, and, through different forms, <lb n="315"/>
            Rouse different actions, the vast whole to sense <lb/>
            Rests undisturbed. For far beyond all ken, <lb/>
            Lies the prime base impalpable of things. <lb/>
            As this eludes all vision, so, alike, <lb n="320"/>
            Its motion too elude. E'en oft the sight <lb/>
            No motion marks where still the moving scene <lb/>
            Springs obvious, by the distance sole concealed.— <lb/>
            The fleecy flocks, o'er yonder hill that browse <lb/>
            From glebe to glebe, where'er, impearled with dew, <lb n="325"/>
            The jocund clover calls them, and the lambs <lb/>
            That round them gambol, saturate with milk, <lb/>
            Proving their frontlets in the mimic fray- <lb/>
            Press, at this distance, on the sight confused, <lb/>
            One white mass forming o'er the verdant steep. <lb n="330"/>
            Thus, too, when warlike squadrons crowd the field, <lb/>
            Horrent in arms, with horses scarce restrained, <lb/>
            Shaking the solid glebe, while the bright pomp <lb/>
            Flames through the skies, and gilds the glowing earth, <lb/>
            While groans the ground beneath their mighty tread, <lb n="335"/>
            And hills and heavens re-echo to their shouts- <lb/>
            Viewed from afar, the splendid scene that spreads <lb/>
            Seems void of motion, to the fields affixt.</p>
          <p>Come now, my friend, and, next, perspicuous mark <lb/>
            What countless shapes primordial seeds assume, <lb n="340"/>
            How vast their variance : for, though myriads swarm <lb/>
            Of equal figures, oft unlike they meet. <lb/>
            Nor wondrous this, since, such th' abundance formed, <lb/>
            No bounds can chain, no numbers e'er compute. <lb/>
            Hence, not unfrequent, each from each, through space, <lb n="345"/>
            Must meet diverse, unkindred in their frames.</p>
          <p>Thus Nature varies ; man, and brutal beast, <lb/>
            And herbage gay, and silver fishes mute, <lb/>
            And all the tribes of heaven, o'er many a sea, <lb/>
            Through many a grove that wing, or urge their song <lb n="350"/>
            Near many a bank of fountain, lake or rill, <lb/>
            Search where thou wilt, each differs in his kind, <lb/>
            In form, in figure differs. Hence alone, <lb/>
            Knows the fond mother her appropriate young, <lb/>
            Th' appropriate young their mother, 'mid the brutes, <lb n="355"/>
            As clear discerned as man's sublimer race. <pb n="341"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Thus oft before the sacred shrine, perfumed <lb/>
            With breathing frankincense, th' affrighted calf <lb/>
            Pours o'er the altar, from his breast profound, <lb/>
            The purple flood of life. But wandering wild <lb n="360"/>
            O'er the green sward, the dam, bereft of hope, <lb/>
            Beats with her cloven hoof th' indented dale, <lb/>
            Each spot exploring, if, perchance, she still <lb/>
            May trace her idol; through th' umbrageous grove, <lb/>
            With well-known voice, she moans ; and oft re-seeks, <lb n="365"/>
            Urged by a mother's love, the accustomed stall. <lb/>
            Nor shade for her, nor dew-distended glebe, <lb/>
            Nor stream soft gliding down its banks abrupt, <lb/>
            Yields aught of solace; nor the carking care <lb/>
            Averts, that preys within; nor the gay young <lb n="370"/>
            Of others soothe her o'er the joyous green : <lb/>
            So deep she longs, so lingers for her own. <lb/>
            Thus equal known, thus longed for, seek, in turn, <lb/>
            The tender heifer, tremulous of voice, <lb/>
            And the gay bleating lamb, their horned dams, <lb n="375"/>
            Lured by the milky fount that nurtures life.</p>
          <p>The corn, moreo'er, the yellow harvest yields, <lb/>
            Matures not all alike;—e'en the same kind <lb/>
            In size oft varying to the curious eye. <lb/>
            Thus vary, too, th' enamelled shells, that paint <lb n="380"/>
            The bending shore; whose thirsty sands drink deep <lb/>
            The main's soft waves, redundant rolled along. <lb/>
            Hence doubly flows it why the seeds of things, <lb/>
            Compact by nature, by mechanic art <lb/>
            Shaped not to one fixt model, each from each <lb n="385"/>
            Should differ oft in figure through the void.</p>
          <p>Illumined thus, the mind with ease decides <lb/>
            Why heaven's electric flash a subtler power <lb/>
            Boasts, than the flame by torches fed below: <lb/>
            That formed than this of atoms finer far, <lb n="390"/>
            Triumphant piercing many a pore minute <lb/>
            By the dull taper's blaze essayed in vain.</p>
          <p>Light, the clear glass pervades, while lymph recoils <lb/>
            Whence springs the difference, but that subtler seeds <lb/>
            Rear the bright sun-beam than the fountain form ? <lb n="395"/>
            Free through the strainer flows the sparkling wine, <lb/>
            While the slow oil hangs heavy : in its course <pb n="342"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Checked, or by atoms of a grosser frame, <lb/>
            Or more perplexed, and tangled ; each from each <lb/>
            Hence severing tardy, and, with toil extreme, <lb n="400"/>
            Transuding separate through th' attenuate lawn.</p>
          <p>Thus vary tastes: and while the dulcet draught <lb/>
            Of milk or honey charms the enchanted lip, <lb/>
            The wormwood straight convulses, by the tongue <lb/>
            Abhorred, and writhing every sapid nerve. <lb n="405"/>
            Hence may'st thou learn those seeds that rouse, combined, <lb/>
            A joyous flavour, round exist, and smooth; <lb/>
            While those that form the bitter, and austere, <lb/>
            Are hook'd, or jagged, and their path propel <lb/>
            Alone by wounding, hostile to the sense. <lb n="410"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus all things live ; from primal atoms reared <lb/>
            Of shape diverse, as deep within they ope <lb/>
            Some secret source of pleasure or of pain. <lb/>
            So deem not thou the saw's discordant scream, <lb/>
            Horrid, and harsh, flows from the same smooth seeds <lb n="415"/>
            That wake the strain mellifluous, when the fair, <lb/>
            With flying fingers, sweeps th' accordant lyre. <lb/>
            Nor deem those atoms like, from putrid scenes <lb/>
            That spring malignant, and the essential sweets <lb/>
            Breathed from CILICIAN saffron, or the blaze <lb n="420"/>
            Of fragrant altars fed from orient groves. <lb/>
            Nor canst thou form from the same source those hues, <lb/>
            On which the vision feeds with fond delight, <lb/>
            And those abhorred, and hideous, or the germs <lb/>
            Pungent and keen, that rouse the sight to tears. <lb n="425"/>
            'Twere vain t' attempt: for all the soul that wakes <lb/>
            To various pleasure, boasts a base rotund; <lb/>
            While pain but springs from atoms hook'd and harsh.</p>
          <p>Yet seeds there are between ; not smooth complete, <lb/>
            Nor deeply jagged, but with angles shaped <lb n="430"/>
            Just peeping o'er the surface. These the nerves <lb/>
            Pain not, but titillate; a sense perceived <lb/>
            When sweets with bitters, sours with sweets combine, <lb/>
            As oft in sauces, catered to the taste <lb/>
            From the pale inula, or grape's soft grounds. <lb n="435"/>
            </p>
          <p>But fires and frosts spring different; from a base <lb/>
            Unlike indented, though indented each. <lb/>
            This if thou doubt, the TOUCH shall quick decide. <pb n="343"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>For TOUCH, 0 TOUCH ! ye powers of heaven supreme! TOUCH forms the genuine sense whence chief we trace <lb n="440"/>
            Whatever without insinuates, or within <lb/>
            Springs up innate, injurious in th* escape, <lb/>
            Or, like the genidi tide by Venus roused, <lb/>
            Pregnant with pleasure; or, perchance, the frame <lb/>
            Affecting inly, as th' essential seeds <lb n="445"/>
            Collect tumultuous, urged to civil strife. <lb/>
            A feeling, this, full oft educed amain <lb/>
            Whene'er the uplifted palm, from sport or ire, <lb/>
            Lets fall its vengeance o'er the reddening cheek. <lb/>
            Hence, from effects so various, various too <lb n="450"/>
            Must be the forms to primal seeds assigned.</p>
          <p>. There are, moreover, that hard exist, and dense; <lb/>
            From atoms, these, more crook'd and clinging spring, <lb/>
            Like tangled branches intertwined throughout. <lb/>
            Such, mid the foremost, shines the diamond's blaze, <lb n="455"/>
            Fearless of insult, such the valid flint, <lb/>
            The steel's enduring vigour, and the brass <lb/>
            Discordant creaking from the public gates. <lb/>
            While those, reversed, a fluent power that boast <lb/>
            Swell into birth from seeds rotund, and smooth, <lb n="460"/>
            Unlinked th' essential globules, and with ease <lb/>
            Poured headlong down, dissevering as they fall. <lb/>
            Those, too, that quick fly off, as clouds or smoke, <lb/>
            Or lambent flame, if not from seeds educed <lb/>
            Rotund, and polished, doubtless, in their make <lb n="465"/>
            Nought know perplext, or hook'd, since armed with power <lb/>
            To pierce the Parian marble, nor to view <lb/>
            Cohering equal, like th* embracing brier: <lb/>
            Not jagged, but pointed, hence, the base they own.</p>
          <p>Nor wondrous this; that things of fluent frame <lb n="470"/>
            As the broad ocean, oft should strike the sense <lb/>
            With taste unlovely; for, though round and smooth <lb/>
            The genial atoms whence all fluids flow, <lb/>
            Still, seeds discordant oft will intermix, <lb/>
            Rough, though globose, and by the tongue abhorred, <lb n="475"/>
            Though fitted still the fluent mass to form. <lb/>
            This to confirm, to prove with polished seeds <lb/>
            Seeds harsh full oft combine, whence springs alone <lb/>
            The main's disflavour—from the briny wave <pb n="344"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>The nauseous mass subtract, and all is sweet. <lb n="480"/>
            Thus Nature acts : through many a thirsty sand <lb/>
            The surge she filters, freshening in its course, <lb/>
            Till freed, at length, from every acrid power, <lb/>
            Tangled, and fixt behind, the dulcet lymph <lb/>
            Resprings to view, a calm and lucid pool. <lb n="485"/>
            </p>
          <p>This proved, what follows, as a truth derived, <lb/>
            But that the forms of seeds, though varying much, <lb/>
            Ne'er vary endless; not unfrequent, else, <lb/>
            Full many a seed must boast a bulk immense: <lb/>
            For many a differing figure ne'er can lurk <lb n="490"/>
            In things minute. Deem, then, primordial seeds <lb/>
            Three fancied parts comprise, or grant e'en more, <lb/>
            Invert their order, .let the right be left, <lb/>
            Depress the loftiest, the profound exalt,- <lb/>
            Soon will the pigmy mass exhaust complete <lb n="495"/>
            Its tiny change of figures: would'st thou, then, <lb/>
            Augment the variance, thou must add, perforce, <lb/>
            New primal matter, hence augmented sole. <lb/>
            Thus from fresh forms increase of size must flow <lb/>
            Perpetual; nor the seeds of things in shape <lb n="500"/>
            Can differ endless, or e'en once evince <lb/>
            A bulk immense, as erst the Muse has proved.</p>
          <p>Already else the purple woof superb <lb/>
            Of MELIBŒA, robbing for its dye <lb/>
            The SYRIAN coasts,-already, dropt with gold, <lb n="505"/>
            The peacock's laughing plumage else had sunk <lb/>
            By gaudier hues overpowered. The balmy myrrh, <lb/>
            The luscious honey never more had urged <lb/>
            A boast unrivalled; e'en the swan's soft dirge <lb/>
            Had ceased, and PHŒBUS dropt his liquid lyre: <lb n="510"/>
            All things o'er all prevailing undefined.</p>
          <p>Thus those by sense abhorred, as these beloved, <lb/>
            To more abhorred would yield; each still o'er each, <lb/>
            In sight or sound, in taste or smell diverse <lb/>
            More hateful reared, more hideous, and obscene. <lb n="515"/>
            But since such powers exist not, since a bound <lb/>
            Is stampt on all things, we must own, convinced, <lb/>

            </note>Th' extremes creating; while progressive warmth <lb n="520"/>
            Fills up, between, the modulated scale. <lb/>
            Thus each degree, though varying, varies not <lb/>
            For ever, by extremes adverse confined, <lb/>
            Combustion here, and there the polar ice. <lb n="525"/>
            </p>
          <p>But mark this truth, a truth connected close, <lb/>
            That all primordial seeds, of shape alike, <lb/>
            Alike are endless; for though few the forms <lb/>
            Those seeds admit, yet finite were themselves <lb/>
            Th' ENTIRE of things, a doctrine erst disproved, <lb n="530"/>
            Were finite too, by bounds surmountless chained.</p>
          <p>Come, then, while thus, in short, but sweetest verse, <lb/>
            We prove them infinite; prove hence alone <lb/>
            The world's vast fabric lives, cemented strong <lb/>
            By blows re-active unremitted urged. <lb n="535"/>
            </p>
          <p>Few are the forms the casual sight surveys <lb/>
            Of brutes exotic ; and, with us, but small <lb/>
            Their unprolific power: yet foreign climes, <lb/>
            And realms far distant, view each class complete, <lb/>
            Boundless in number. Thus, though seldom here <lb n="540"/>
            Heaves the huge elephant his ponderous limbs, <lb/>
            Prince of the savage tribes ; yet myriads guard, <lb/>
            As with an ivory mound, all INDIA'S sons; <lb/>
            A mound no power can pierce. Such the vast stores <lb/>
            That Nature boasts in orders deemed most rare. <lb n="545"/>
            Yet could Creation's utmost scope produce <lb/>
            A form unparalleled by all that breathes, <lb/>
            Alone and individual,-were the base <lb/>
            Not infinite whence first the monster sprang, <lb/>
            How sprang he then at all ? nor birth were his, <lb n="550"/>
            Nor e'en, though born, the power to nurture life. <lb/>
            But grant the primal atoms whence alone <lb/>
            Such individual springs, were finite found, <lb/>
            How, when, and where, by what concerted plan, <lb/>
            What power innate, could e'er those atoms meet, <lb n="555"/>
            Through ocean, scattered of ungenial seeds ? <lb/>
            These time could never join. As when the main, <lb/>
            Worked into fury, many a mighty ship <lb/>
            Wrecks ruthless, and towards every coast impels <lb/>
            Masts, yards, and streamers, cordage, sails, and helms, <lb n="560"/>
            And planks disparted, teaching as they float <pb n="346"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>What dangers lurk unseen; what snares to lure <lb/>
            Unthinking mortals;—and forewarning loud <lb/>
            To fly the smooth temptation, nor e'en once <lb/>
            Trust the false waves, though decked in loudest laugh: <lb n="565"/>
            So, should'st thou make the primal seeds of aught <lb/>
            Once finite, instant the tumultuous war <lb/>
            Of adverse atoms, through the boundless void <lb/>
            Drives them far distant-never more to meet, <lb/>
            Or met, cohere, or e'en, cohering, grow; <lb n="570"/>
            Facts without which Creation's self would fail, <lb/>
            As all must thus proceed, augment, mature. <lb/>
            And hence the primal seeds of all that live <lb/>
            Must, too, be boundless, whence each want is fed.</p>
          <p>Nor can the mortal motions that wear out <lb n="575"/>
            The varied forms of things, with utter doom, <lb/>
            Prevail for ever: nor e'en those, reversed, <lb/>
            Of genial power, that quicken into life, <lb/>
            Can, through perpetual time, that life sustain. <lb/>
            Thus war eternal, midst the seeds of things, <lb n="580"/>
            With equal triumph reigns; now here, now there, <lb/>
            The vital powers overcoming, and overcome. <lb/>
            The sigh funereal mingles with the bleat <lb/>
            Of babes just bursting to the light of heaven ; <lb/>
            Nor night o'er day, nor morn o'er night prevails, <lb n="585"/>
            But marks the discord—INFANCY'S shrill cry <lb/>
            Mixt with sick moans, the apparitors of DEATH.</p>
          <p>This too, attentive, treasure in thy mind: <lb/>
            That nought the sight surveys, the soul conceives, <lb/>
            Flows from one class of primal seeds alone. <lb n="590"/>
            Whatever exists is compound; and the more <lb/>
            The latent powers, the energies it boasts, <lb/>
            The more complex its nature; reared to life <lb/>
            From seeds more various, and of various shape.</p>
          <p>First EARTH herself th' essential atoms holds <lb n="595"/>
            Of streams and fountains, whence the main renews; <lb/>
            Holds in herself the secret seeds of fires, <lb/>
            Oft the brown heath wide-parching, unperceived, <lb/>
            And oft, like Ætna, blazing to the day: <lb/>
            And holds each embryon, whence, to glad mankind, <lb n="600"/>
            Springs the gay corn, the blossomed fruit-tree springs, <lb/>
            Or whence the brutal tribes that roam at large <pb n="347"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>

            Of brutes, and men, is EARTH full frequent feigned. <lb n="605"/>
            </p>
          <p>Her the sage bards of GREECE, in ancient song, <lb/>
            Paint drawn by lions in a car sublime: <lb/>
            Hence, teaching how, in ether poised, she hangs, <lb/>
            Unpropt by aught beneath; the savage beasts <lb/>
            They yoked and reined, to demonstrate how sure <lb n="610"/>
            The wildest young a mother's cares may tame; <lb/>
            And, with a mural crown her brows they bound, <lb/>
            Since with her towers she guards man's civic rights. <lb/>
            Thus deckt, tremendous, round from realm to realm, <lb/>
            Still moves the solemn pomp, by all adored. <lb n="615"/>
            Her many a state, from holiest legends, call <lb/>
            Parent of IDA; and with PHRYGIAN nymphs <lb/>
            Surround, her fair attendants ; PHRYGIAN termed, <lb/>
            Since these the climes where first, as fame reports, <lb/>
            The field was cultured, and the harvest rose. <lb n="620"/>
            Her priests are eunuchs—emblem this devised <lb/>
            To teach that sons rebellious to their sires, <lb/>
            Or those the sacred fame that dare traduce <lb/>
            Of her who bore them, never shall themselves, <lb/>
            Worthless and vile, by gods and men abhorred, <lb n="625"/>
            Boast aught of babe to glad their longing sight. <lb/>
            With vigorous band the clamorous drum they rouse <lb/>
            And wake the sounding cymbal: the hoarse horn <lb/>
            Pours forth its threatening music, and the pipe <lb/>
            With PHRYGIAN airs distracts the maddening mind, <lb n="630"/>
            While arms of blood the fierce enthusiasts wield <lb/>
            To fright th* unrighteous crowds, and bend profound <lb/>
            Their impious souls before the power divine.</p>
          <p>Thus moves the pompous idol through the streets, <lb/>
            Scattering mute blessings, while the throngs devout <lb n="635"/>
            Strew, in return, their silver and their brass, <lb/>
            Loading the paths with presents, and o'ershade <lb/>
            The heavenly form, and all th' attending train <lb/>
            With dulcet sprays of roses, pluckt profuse. <lb/>
            A band select before them, by the GREEKS <lb n="640"/>
            CURETES called, from PHRYGIAN parents sprung, <lb/>
            Sport with fantastic chains, the measured dance <lb/>
            Weaving infuriate, charmed with human blood, <pb n="348"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>And madly shaking their tremendous crests. <lb/>
            These picture, haply, the DICTÆAN train, <lb n="645"/>
            Alike CURETES termed, as fame reports, <lb/>
            Who drowned the infant cries of JOVE in CRETE, <lb/>
            When round the boy divine, in arms they danced, <lb/>
            Boys still themselves, and beat to measured sounds <lb/>
            Their clashing shields, lest SATURN the shrill shriek <lb n="650"/>
            Should trace, and RHÆA shed eternal tears. <lb/>
            Thus these the matron-goddess now precede: <lb/>
            Or else, perchance, they paint how every breast <lb/>
            Should burn with patriot fire, and every arm <lb/>
            Prove the firm guardian of a parent's years. <lb n="655"/>
            </p>
          <p>All these, though pageants well-devised, and bold, <lb/>
            Will wander still from philosophic fact. <lb/>
            For, far from mortals, and their vain concerns, <lb/>
            In peace perpetual dwell th' immortal gods: <lb/>
            Each self-dependent, and from human wants <lb n="660"/>
            Estranged for ever. There no pain pervades, <lb/>
            Nor dangers threaten ; every passion sleeps, <lb/>
            Vice no revenge, and virtue draws no boon.</p>
          <p>Meantime the earth sensation never knows; <lb/>
            But, blest with the rude principles of things, <lb n="665"/>
            In various mode hence various forms she rears. <lb/>
            Call, if thou choose it, the resounding deep <lb/>
            NEPTUNE, and CERES term the golden grain; <lb/>
            Be BACCHUS wine, its vulgar source forgot, <lb/>
            And e'en this mass of senseless earth define <lb n="670"/>
            Parent of gods; no harm ensues,—but mark, <lb/>
            'Tis fiction all, by vital facts disproved.</p>
          <p>Thus varies earth in product; and, alike <lb/>
            In primal seeds, thus varies all she bears. <lb/>
            The steed, the steer, the fleecy flock that range <lb n="675"/>
            Beneath the same pure sky, from the same fount <lb/>
            Their thirst that quench, and o'er the flowery lawn <lb/>
            Crop the same herbage, differ still, through time, <lb/>
            In form generic; each parental stamp <lb/>
            Retaining close, from sire to sire propelled. <lb n="680"/>
            Such the vast variance of primordial seeds; <lb/>
            Through every herb, through every fountain such. <lb/>
            Each form, moreover, of animated life <lb/>
            Compounded, flows from muscle, bone, and nerve, <pb n="349"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II </note>Vein, heat, and moisture ; yet e'en these comprise <lb n="685"/>
            Full many an atom, each, of shape unlike.</p>
          <p>Thus fire itself is complex ; for if nought <lb/>
            Deep blend besides, the germs, at least, combine <lb/>
            Of heat, smoke, ashes, and translucent light: <lb/>
            And reasoning thus, thy vigorous mind may deem <lb n="690"/>
            Still powers beyond lurk deeper, though unknown.</p>
          <p>Of the same substance, as the fragrant gums <lb/>
            Burnt o'er the altar to th' offended gods, <lb/>
            Emits both taste and odour, hence from seeds <lb/>
            Educed, of various figures ; odours oft <lb n="695"/>
            Piercing the nerves that tastes essay in vain, <lb/>
            And tastes where odours fail: facts that evince <lb/>
            Their forms diverse; and prove that seeds unlike <lb/>
            Rear the mixt mass diffused through all that lives.-</p>
          <p>Mark but these fluent numbers ; many a type <lb n="700"/>
            To many a term is common ; but the terms, <lb/>
            The numbers culled, as differing these from those, <lb/>
            From different types evolve: not so diverse <lb/>
            That the same type recurs not through the whole, <lb/>
            Or that, recurring, it recurs alone <lb n="705"/>
            From types too bounded ; but from types alike <lb/>
            Free to each term, yet ever new combined, <lb/>
            Flows the vast change, th' harmonious system flows. <lb/>
            Thus, through the world, the primal seeds of all, <lb/>
            To all things common, re-arranged diverse, <lb n="710"/>
            In myriad forms shoot forth ; and herbs, and men, <lb/>
            And trees umbrageous own the same fixt source.</p>
          <p>Yet not in endless modes combine the seeds <lb/>
            Of things at random ; many a monster else <lb/>
            Would start tremendous, the fair frame of man <lb n="715"/>
            Sprout forth half formed, and trunks of trees have souls. <lb/>
            Shapes then would swarm half earthly, half marine, <lb/>
            And Nature's all-prolific womb propel, <lb/>
            With breath of fire, Chimæras; things the sight <lb/>
            Meets never, since from seeds, and powers precise, <lb n="720"/>
            All spring to life, and thus preserve their kinds.</p>
          <p>Then all must spring, since all, from every food, <lb/>
            To every tribe adapted, straight digests; <lb/>
            And, blending with each limb, the train renews <lb/>
            Of acts appropriate ; while th' ungenial mass <pb n="350"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Meets earth unchanged; or if, perchance, absorbed, <lb n="725"/>
            Flies off impalpable through pores extreme, <lb/>
            Void of all union, and for life unfit.</p>
          <p>Nor deem each animated tribe alone <lb/>
            Such laws avows-all nature feels their force. <lb n="730"/>
            For since the difference 'twixt created things <lb/>
            Is total, their primordial seeds in form <lb/>
            M ust differ too: not that they ne'er commix <lb/>
            Of equal shape, but e'en when mixt that still, <lb/>
            From re-arrangement, the result is changed. <lb n="735"/>
            Nor only in their forms thus vary seeds <lb/>
            Primordial; but, alike, in weight, and power, <lb/>
            In concourse, motion, intervening space, <lb/>
            And close connexion ; changes that define, <lb/>
            Not men and brutes alone, but bound secure <lb n="740"/>
            From ocean earth, and earth from heaven sublime.</p>
          <p>But haste we, many a truth lies yet unsung <lb/>
            Culled from my own loved labours. Deem not thou, <lb/>
            When aught of substance black or white the view <lb/>
            Solicits obvious,-deem not, in the germs <lb n="745"/>
            Of embryon matter, black or white inheres, <lb/>
            Or aught besides of tint, where aught occurs, <lb/>
            Rousing the vision ; since the seeds of things <lb/>
            Live void of colours actual or conceived. <lb/>
            This should'st thou doubt, contending nought exists <lb n="750"/>
            Through the wide world but must evince some hue, <lb/>
            The doubt flows groundless. He, whose sightless orb <lb/>
            Ne'er drank the day enlightened, still perceives <lb/>
            Whate'er exists, though tints elude his ken. <lb/>
            Hence not essential colours to the form <lb n="755"/>
            Of things created: frequent e'en ourselves, <lb/>
            Mid the deep shade of night, by touch alone <lb/>
            Prove what surrounds us, every hue extinct.</p>
          <p>All hues, moreo'er, to all by turns convert; <lb/>
            A change primordial seeds can ne'er sustain; <lb n="760"/>
            Since something still through nature must exist <lb/>
            All change defying, lest th' ENTIRE surveyed <lb/>
            Fall into nought; for that which once admits <lb/>
            Mutation dies, its pristine powers destroyed.- <lb/>
            Tinge, then, with caution, the prime seeds of things, <lb n="765"/>
            Lest, hence, thou ope the doors of death to all. <pb n="351"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK II <lb/>
            </note>But though material atoms thus live void Of hue; still many a differing form is theirs, <lb/>
            Whence hues they gender, and their variance stamp. <lb/>
            Much, then, import th' arrangement, and the powers, <lb n="770"/>
            The kinds, connexions of primordial seeds, <lb/>
            Positions, impulse, and effects impelled; <lb/>
            Since, hence, with ease the mind may, instant, trace <lb/>
            Why what is black this moment, should, the next, <lb/>
            Pour o'er the view with alabaster dye. <lb n="775"/>
            Thus, when loud tempests tear the tortured main, <lb/>
            The dashing surge is robed in dazzling white, <lb/>
            This may'st thou fathom hence, and prove precise <lb/>
            Why, oft though black, from combinations new <lb/>
            Of its primordial atoms, added these, <lb n="780"/>
            And those withdrawn, oft, too, the deep should wear <lb/>
            A vest contrasted, whitening to the day. <lb/>
            But were its primal atoms tinged themselves <lb/>
            Black, or but blue, concussion ne'er could change <lb/>
            The fixt result; nor turn the black or blue <lb n="785"/>
            To the pure polish of the marble bust. <lb/>
            Nor urge from seeds of varying tints, perchance, <lb/>
            Springs, when combined, the main's resplendent face ; <lb/>
            As in the cube mechanic many a shape <lb/>
            Diverse unites to rear its frame complete. <lb n="790"/>
            For as the keen sight in the cube surveys <lb/>
            Those varying figures, so the splendid deep, <lb/>
            Or aught of equal lustre, would evince <lb/>
            The varying tinctures whence that lustre flows. <lb/>
            The differing forms, moreover, the cube contains <lb n="795"/>
            Mar not its unity, but differing hues <lb/>
            A blended tinge create, by each diverged.</p>
          <p>A cause like this, too, all effect destroys ; <lb/>
            Since white or black springs not from seeds so dyed, <lb/>
            But seeds commixt of various dyes possest. <lb n="800"/>
            Though, doubtless, white flows rather from the want <lb/>
            Of each existent tincture, than from seeds <lb/>
            With black, in part, imbued, or aught besides <lb/>
            Of equal contrast, and as firm a foe.</p>

            Were hues essential to the seeds of things <lb/>
            These, too, would die in darkness : for, resolve <pb n="352"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>What hues exist beneath the midnight gloom ? <lb/>
            Hues born of sun-beams, changing but their s! adcs <lb/>
            As, playful, changes the refracted ray? <lb n="810"/>
            Thus the gay pigeon, as his plumes he waves, <lb/>
            Drinks in new tinctures from the noon-tide blaze: <lb/>
            Now glows the ruby, and now, tinged with blue, <lb/>
            Sports the green emerald o'er his glossy neck. <lb/>
            Thus, too, the peacock, as direct, or bent <lb n="815"/>
            Falls the full beam, wears each prismatic dye. <lb/>
            Since, then, th' impinging light each hue creates, <lb/>
            So, without light, each, instant, must expire. <lb/>
            And as the stimulus the sight that strikes <lb/>
            Varies, from things that varying dyes educe, <lb n="820"/>
            Black, white, or aught besides, and nought imports, <lb/>
            Change how it may, th' existing hue, but sole <lb/>
            The different figures whence those hues are reared: <lb/>
            Hence useless colours to the seeds of things, <lb/>
            From varying forms by varying frictions roused. <lb n="825"/>
            </p>
          <p>Since, too, no seeds defined with tints are stained <lb/>
            Defined alike, and every shape concurs <lb/>
            In all that springs, whatever the hue evinced, <lb/>
            Whence flows it, then, that every class alike <lb/>
            Reflects not every tincture ?-whence that crows <lb n="830"/>
            Robe not in white from seeds that white create ? <lb/>
            Or that the downy swan, in black arrayed, <lb/>
            Or hues as hideous, ne'er the sight appals ?</p>
          <p>As things, moreover, to parts minute divide, <lb/>
            Th' anterior tincture fades. Thus fades away, <lb n="835"/>
            To dust impalpable reduced, the dye <lb/>
            Of gold refulgent: thus the TYRIAN woof, <lb/>
            Frittered to threads, its purple pride foregoes; <lb/>
            Hence proving clear that hues from things concrete <lb/>
            Evanish total ere to seeds dissolved. <lb n="840"/>
            </p>
          <p>From many a substance sound, or odour fine, <lb/>
            Flies never; nor the race of man bestows <lb/>
            Odours, or sounds on all things. Judge then, hence, <lb/>
            That, since not all things the keen sight discerns, <lb/>
            Full many a substance, too, as void exists <lb n="845"/>
            Of varying hues, as these of scent, or sound: <lb/>
            Things, than which nought the mind more clear perceives, <lb/>
            Whate'er the powers possest of, or denied. <pb n="353"/>

            </note>Nor deem primordial seeds devoid alone Of hues prismatic. Heat, and cold severe, <lb n="850"/>
            Moisture, and sound, these, too, they never know; <lb/>
            Nor aught of fluent odours, to the sense <lb/>
            Hateful or sweet. Thus when, to please the fair, <lb/>
            Some rich perfume the skilful artist plans, <lb/>
            Drawn from the fragrant nard, the dulcet powers <lb n="855"/>

            Lest, with th' effluvia thus selected choice, <lb/>
            Aught else combine, and mar th' harmonious whole. <lb n="860"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus void of scent primordial seeds must spring, <lb/>
            Thus void of sound; and hence nor scent, nor sound, <lb/>

            Nought can transmit but what themselves possess. <lb/>
            And hence, moreover, the powers of heat, or cold, <lb n="865"/>
            Vapour, or taste, these never can bestow, <lb/>
            Nor aught alike destructive, aught surveyed, <lb/>

            From bodies soft, putrescent, or relaxed; <lb/>
            These thou must sever from primordial seeds<lb n="870"/>
            If things created on a base be built <lb/>

            This every fact of every day, if scanned, <lb/>
            Far from resisting, proves a truth most firm; <lb/>
            That sentient things, things void of sense create.</p>
          <p>Thus into life th' insensate dunghill rears <lb n="880"/>
            The race of worms, when once the mingling shower <lb/>

            And flocks, and herds to man ; and man, in turn, <lb n="885"/>
            Feeds the foul strength of birds, and barbarous beasts. <lb/>
            From every food, thus Nature s chemic power <lb/>

            That sentient things from things insensate flow ? <lb/>
            What but that stocks, and stones, and earth's dull clod, <lb/>

            Yet mark, attentive, the sage muse ne'er yet <lb n="900"/>
            Has urged that all things doubtless must alike <lb/>
            Spring forth percipient, and with sense endued: <lb/>
            But that of vast concern, as hence alone, <lb/>
            Sensation ceaseless flows—the modes diverse <lb/>
            Of motion, order, form, with which, through time, <lb n="905"/>
            Primordial atoms blend: -modes the dull clod <lb/>
            Knows not, its frame unorganized and rude. <lb/>
            Though the dull clod, or sapless root as dull, <lb/>
            When the moist shower the putrid strife has roused, <lb/>
            Themselves the vermin race in crowds create: <lb n="910"/>
            Changed, then, their nature, from arrangements new, <lb/>
            And full empowered perceptive life to rear.</p>
          <p>Those, too, who hold that sentient forms throughout <lb/>
            Spring but from sentient seeds, those seeds must deem <lb/>
            Soft and unsolid, since unsolid all, <lb n="915"/>
            And soft each region, where sensation reigns, <lb/>
            Th' interior bowels, and the flesh without; <lb/>
            And hence such seeds must doubtless waste to nought.</p>
          <p>Yet grant their dates eternal: such must then <lb/>
            The total sense possess of things they rear, <lb n="920"/>
            Or sense of separate parts : but parts alone <lb/>
            Have no perception, nor alone can live. <lb/>
            Each leans on each ; the loose dismembered hand <lb/>
            Drops powerless; nor can aught itself sustain, <lb/>
            From the full form, the total sense that flows. <lb n="925"/>
            What then remains but that each seed exists <lb/>
            An animal complete, endowed throughout <lb/>
            With vital functions ? but resolve, how then <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>But grant e'en this: their combination still <lb/>
            No forms could rear, but those of sentient life; <lb/>
            Nor men, nor herds, nor savage beasts produce <lb/>
            Aught but themselves; the sense generic shown <lb n="935"/>
            Varying as varies the generic frame.</p>
          <p>Nor urge that sentient seeds, at times, perchance, <lb/>
            Lose all sensation, and insensate live; <lb/>
            Why with an attribute so soon destroyed <lb/>

            The vermin nations rise, with soul replete, <lb n="945"/>

          <p>Nor deem sensation senseless seeds create <lb/>
            Sole from some change anterior, long educed <lb/>
            Ere into birth the sentient being springs. <lb/>
            What more fallacious ? since nor birth complete <lb n="950"/>
            Nor aught of change can Nature's self create <lb/>
            But from the sympathy of primal seeds: <lb/>
            Nor, till the frame percipient be combined, <lb/>
            Can e'er perception flow ; since wide through space, <lb/>
            In earth, in air, in streams, and lambent fire, <lb n="955"/>
            Are spread the rude materials, unarranged, <lb/>
            And void of social bond, whence first exists <lb/>
            Each vital motion, whence each guardian sense <lb/>

          <p>When too, abrupt, falls some tremendous blow, <lb n="960"/>
            Throughout the system suffers, every sense <lb/>
            Of soul and body discomposed alike. <lb/>
            Then fails the arrangement of primordial seeds, <lb/>
            Each vital action fails ; and, shook severe <lb/>

            And through th' external pores By off at large. <lb/>

            The dread solution, and the death of all.</p>

            For else, why rather should those powers retreat <lb n="975"/>
            Back from destruction with recruited strength, <lb/>
            Than still proceed, and burst the bars of life ?</p>
          <p>As pain, too, springs when, midst th' interior frame, <lb/>

            Each vital atom shakes through all its course, <lb n="980"/>

            No pain they know, nor e'er the fruit can pluck <lb/>
            Of dear delight; hence nought of sense is theirs.</p>
          <p>But if, that things sensation may possess, <lb n="985"/>
            Their seeds primordial must possess the same,- <lb/>
            Say, from what seeds, then, springs the race of man ? <lb/>
            From those, forsooth, incited quick to laugh, <lb/>
            Those down whose cheeks perpetual tears distil, <lb/>
            And those deep-versed in causes and effects, <lb n="990"/>
            Discussing grave the seeds that rear themselves. <lb/>
            For grant this system, and whate'er exists <lb/>
            Must spring from seeds minuter, endless urged, <lb/>
            And draw, progressive, every power displayed <lb/>
            Of thought, or laughter, from the parent stock. <lb n="995"/>
            This if thou smile at, and contend that things <lb/>
            With power endowed of laughter, speech, and thought <lb/>
            Still rise from seeds that no such powers avow, <lb/>
            Why not concede, then, sentient things alike <lb/>
            May flow from seeds of total sense devoid ? <lb n="1000"/>
            </p>
          <p>All spring from heaven, ethereal, all that live: <lb/>
            The sire of all is ETHER: he, full oft, <lb/>
            In dulcet drops descends of genial rain <lb/>
            And the bland EARTH impregnates. Timely, then, <lb/>
            Rises the glossy blade, the joyous leaf <lb n="1005"/>
            Shoots forth, and man and beast, in countless tribes, <lb/>
            Fed from the various banquet of the fields, <lb/>
            Live their gay hours, and propagate their kinds. <lb/>
            Maternal, hence, is EARTH most justly named. <lb/>
            Thus all things rise, thus all again return: <lb n="1010"/>

            </note>Yet death destroys not the prime seeds of things, <lb/>
            But scatters only ; atoms hence commix <lb/>
            With stranger atoms, every form commutes, <lb n="1015"/>
            And every tint; perception springs amain, <lb/>
            And, instantaneous, wastes again to nought. <lb/>
            Of such vast moment are the modes diverse <lb/>
            In which primordial seeds their posts arrange, <lb/>
            Act, and re-act, give motion, and accept: <lb n="1020"/>

            Through the vast whole, now obvious to the view, <lb/>
            Now quick disperst, can ne'er eternal live. <lb/>
            Such then the moment, as already urged, <lb/>
            With which the types, these numbers that compose, <lb n="1025"/>
            Change their positions, and retreat, or blend. <lb/>
            Thus the same letters, or with variance small, <lb/>
            Heaven, earth, and water, seas, and suns express, <lb/>
            Fruits, plants, and mortals ; common are the types, <lb/>
            The terms but change from combinations new. <lb n="1030"/>
            Thus change material things: their primal seeds <lb/>
            In site, connexion, interval of space, <lb/>
            Position, motion, weight, attractive power, <lb/>
            In these as varying, varies the result.</p>
          <p>Now bend thy mind to truths profounder still: <lb n="1035"/>
            For stranger doctrines must assault thine ear, <lb/>
            And a new scene of wonders yet unfold. <lb/>
            Whate'er is new, though obvious and defined, <lb/>
            Gains not an easy credence ; but when once <lb/>
            Flies the fresh novelty, th' unsteady soul <lb n="1040"/>
            Yields its full faith to facts mysterious most.</p>
          <p>The vault of heaven cerulean, spangled thick <lb/>
            With stars, and with th'effulsive lustre cheered <lb/>
            Of sun and moon refulgent-were at once <lb/>
            This scene celestial o'er the race of man <lb n="1045"/>
            To burst abrupt-how would the nations start! <lb/>
            What wonders, then, be traced ! with what vast toil <lb/>

            Yet now, full sated with the scene sublime, <lb/>
            Man scarce lifts up his listless eyes to heaven. <lb n="1050"/>
            Cease, then, alarmed by aught profound, or strange, <lb/>
            Right reason to reject; weigh well the proofs <lb/>
            Each scheme advances; if by truth upheld <pb n="358"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>
            </note>Embrace the doctrine ; but, if false, abjure. <lb/>
            Urged thus, by truth,-beyond the world's wide walls <lb n="1055"/>
            Since space spreads boundless, the redundant mind, <lb/>
            Free in its flights, pants, ardent, to discern <lb/>
            What fills those realms where sight can never soar.</p>
          <p>And first, th' ENTIRE OF THINGS, above, below, <lb/>
            Search where thou wilt on every side alike <lb n="1060"/>
            Spreads unconfined: this, as already taught, <lb/>
            Right reason proves, and many a clamorous fact. <lb/>
            Then deem not thou, since thus perpetual space <lb/>
            Flows infinite, and infinite the seeds <lb/>
            That, from exhaustless founts, in endless modes <lb n="1065"/>
            Fly through the void, by endless motions urged, <lb/>
            Deem not this visual system of the heavens <lb/>
            Alone exists, unparalleled by aught, <lb/>
            And that all matter elsewhere sleeps supine. <lb/>
            Since too of its own nature the vast mass <lb n="1070"/>
            Sprang forth spontaneous, rousing every power <lb/>
            To every mode of motion, rashly oft, <lb/>
            Oft vain and fruitless, till, at length, it formed <lb/>
            Th' unchanging rudiments of things sublime, <lb/>
            And heaven, and earth, and main, and mortals rose:- <lb n="1075"/>
            Hence doubly flows it, other systems still, <lb/>
            Like ours, must deck the vast ethereal void, <lb/>
            Enfolded in its avaricious grasp.</p>
          <p>Ample, moreover, the matter thus required, <lb/>
            The place at hand, the cause efficient full, <lb n="1080"/>
            Whence new creations may for ever spring. <lb/>
            Since, then, so boundless the great mass of seeds <lb/>
            That endless ages ne'er could cast th' amount,- <lb/>
            Since the same power presides, the nature still <lb/>
            That reared this visual system, and alike <lb n="1085"/>
            Those seeds can mould to systems such as ours- <lb/>
            The fact flows doubtless, mid the void immense, <lb/>
            That other worlds in other parts must rise, <lb/>
            Peopled with reasoning, and with brutal tribes.</p>
          <p>Add, too, that nought, through universal space, <lb n="1090"/>

            The sole sustained; still countless every class, <lb/>

            The race of man consociate, the mute fish <pb n="359"/>

            Nor the broad main, nor aught besides, alone <lb/>
            Can live, but each unlimited in kind. <lb/>
            Each the same substance, the same seeds of death, <lb/>
            Bears in its frame, that stamp the ranks diverse <lb n="1100"/>
            More obvious, gendered by connubial love.</p>
          <p>These truths avowed, all Nature shines at once, <lb/>
            Free in her acts, no tyrant to control, <lb/>
            Self-potent, and uninfluenced by the gods. <lb/>
            For, 0 ye powers divine! whose tranquil lives <lb n="1105"/>
            Flow free from care, with ceaseless sunshine blest,- <lb/>
            Who the vast whole could guide, midst all your ranks ? <lb/>
            Who grasp the reins that curb th' ENTIRE OF THINGS ? <lb/>
            Turn the broad heavens, and pour, through countless worlds, <lb/>
            Th' ethereal fire that feeds their vital throngs ? <lb n="1110"/>

            Who form the louring clouds ? the lightning dart, <lb/>

            That, while the guilty triumphs, prostrates stern <lb/>
            The fairest forms of innocence and worth ?</p>
          <p>Long after the wide world had risen, the sun <lb/>
            Shot his young beams, and earth and sea rejoiced <lb/>
            In infant being-still primordial seeds, <lb n="1120"/>
            From the vast compass of th' ENTIRE, conjoined; <lb/>
            Conjoined from every part; hence earth and main <lb/>
            Increased; hence the broad mansions of the heavens <lb/>
            Spread wider; and th' ethereal dome was filled <lb/>
            With new-born air; for all, harmonious, blend <lb n="1125"/>
            Kinds with their kinds, and thence those kinds augment. <lb/>
            Earth from the seeds of earth, from fiery, fire, <lb/>
            Air from aerial, from the dewy, dew: <lb/>
            Till all-prolific Nature rears at length <lb/>
            To full perfection the vast frame of things, <lb n="1130"/>
            And the gorged system can no more absorb <lb/>
            Than what flies casual from th' external pores. <lb/>
            Then boasts the whole completion; Nature, then, <lb/>
            Restrains all progress, every power matured.</p>
          <p>For all with gradual growth that swells, and thus <pb n="360"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK II. <lb/>

            Far less emits than what its frame receives. <lb/>
            Wide through the system flows the genial food <lb/>
            Towards every part disperst: yet not so wide <lb/>
            That much transudes external, and the day <lb n="1140"/>
            Thus loses larger than the day digests. <lb/>
            For still, though much evanish, ampler still <lb/>
            The nutriment that spreads, till the full form <lb/>
            Gains, by degrees, its point of perfect power.- <lb/>
            Then back, by gradual march, its strength declines, <lb n="1145"/>
            Its fond perfection, and, from day to day, <lb/>
            Melts all its vigour.- This the ceaseless course <lb/>
            Of things created. But those chief, with speed, <lb/>
            Waste into nought that boast a bulk immense; <lb/>
            Since wider, here, the surface whence, each hour, <lb n="1150"/>
            Flies off the light effluvium, nor with ease <lb/>
            Winds the fresh food through all the mighty mass, <lb/>
            By ceaseless strife exhausted, and a store <lb/>
            Asking far ampler than the store received. <lb/>
            Thus all must perish, unsupplied within, <lb n="1155"/>
            And, from without, by blows tumultuous urged; <lb/>
            Blows that, resistless, from whatever adjoins, <lb/>
            Ply their full vigour till the victim yields.</p>
          <p>Thus shall the world's wide walls hereafter sink <lb/>
            In boundless ruins: thus, though yet sustained <lb n="1160"/>
            By food appropriate, and preserved entire. <lb/>
            For not for ever will her powers digest <lb/>
            The due recruit, nor Nature's hand supply.-</p>
          <p>E'en now her glory fades, and the faint earth, <lb/>

            In every class profuse,-scarce now protrudes, <lb/>
            With utmost toil, a scant and puny race. <lb/>
            For deem not thou some golden chain from heaven <lb/>
            Each tribe conducted down to realms below; <lb/>
            Nor from the boisterous billows of the main <lb n="1170"/>
            That mortals sprung: Earth from herself produced <lb/>
            The various ranks that still herself sustains.</p>
          <p>Then, too, spontaneous, from the soil she reared <lb/>
            Those luscious fruits, those vines that gladden life; <lb/>
            And crowned with pasture, and with glossy corn, <lb n="1175"/>
            Those fields where man now toils almost in Vain: <pb n="361"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Where faints the steer, the ploughman faints fatigued, <lb/>

            Can scarce supply th' exhaustion:—such the call <lb/>
            For labour now, so foods forbear to rise. <lb n="1180"/>
            Thus musing, the rude husbandman shakes oft <lb/>
            His weary head ; his thriftless pains bewails, <lb/>
            Thriftless too sure: and, while his wandering thought <lb/>
            Weighs, with the present, the fair times elapsed, <lb/>
            Envies the lot the men of yore enjoyed. <lb n="1185"/>
            Then, luckless planter of degenerate vines! <lb/>
            His day he curses, then all heaven he tires, <lb/>
            Muttering that earlier times, though virtuous more, <lb/>
            Should, thus, have more been favoured,-thus have reared <lb/>
            An ampler harvest e'en from narrower farms,- <lb n="1190"/>
            Heedless that all things by degrees must fail, <lb/>
            Worn out by age, and doomed to certain death.</p>

          <p>O GLORY of the Greeks ! who first didst chase <lb/>
            The mind's dread darkness with celestial day, <lb/>
            The worth illustrating of human life- <lb/>
            Thee, glad, I follow-with firm foot resolved <lb/>
            To tread the path imprinted by thy steps; <lb n="5"/>
            Not urged by competition, but, alone, <lb/>
            Studious thy toils to copy; for, in powers, <lb/>
            How can the swallow with the swan contend ? <lb/>
            Or the young kid, all tremulous of limb, <lb/>
            Strive with the strength, the fleetness of the horse; <lb n="10"/>
            Thou, sire of science! with paternal truths <lb/>
            Thy sons enrichest: from thy peerless page, <lb/>
            Illustrious chief! as from the flowery field <lb/>
            Th' industrious bee culls honey, we alike <lb/>
            Cull many a golden precept-golden each- <lb n="15"/>
            And each most worthy everlasting life.</p>
          <p>For as the doctrines of thy godlike mind <lb/>
            Prove into birth how nature first uprose, <pb n="362"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III <lb/>
            </note>All terrors vanish; the blue walls of heaven <lb/>
            Fly instant-and the boundless void throughout <lb n="20"/>
            Teems with created things. Then too we trace <lb/>
            The powers immortal, and their blest abodes; <lb/>
            Scenes where the winds rage never-unobscured <lb/>
            By clouds, or snow white drifting,-and o'erspread <lb/>
            With laughing ether, and perennial day. <lb n="25"/>
            There nature fills each want, nor aught up-springs <lb/>
            To mar th' eternal harmony of soul.- <lb/>
            Yet nought exists of hell's infernal reign: <lb/>
            Nor hides the solid earth the scenes from sight <lb/>
            Spread through the void beneath.-On these vast themes <lb n="30"/>
            As deep I ponder, a sublime delight, <lb/>
            A sacred horror sways me—Nature thus <lb/>
            By thy keen skill through all her depths unveiled.</p>
          <p>Since, then, we erst have sung the make minute <lb/>
            Of primal seeds ; how, in spontaneous course <lb n="35"/>
            Re-active urged, their various figures fly, <lb/>
            And, hence, how all things into life ascend, <lb/>
            Next let our daring verse the frame unfold <lb/>
            Of soul, and reasoning mind ;-and chase, far chase <lb/>
            Those fears of future torment that distract <lb n="40"/>
            Man's total being; with the gloom of death <lb/>
            Tinge all things; nor e'en suffer once the tide <lb/>
            Of present joy to flow serene and pure.</p>
          <p>For though, full oft, men boast they far prefer <lb/>
            Death to disease, or infamy of name, is <lb n="45"/>
            Assert they know the soul but springs from blood, <lb/>
            Or, if the humour urge them, is but air, <lb/>
            And hence, that useless all the lore we bring:- <lb/>
            Oft flows the boast from love of praise alone. <lb/>
            For when of home debarred, from every haunt <lb n="50"/>
            Of man cut off, with conscious guilt overpowered, <lb/>
            Midst every ill such boasters still survive: <lb/>
            Still fell new victims, and th' infernal powers <lb/>
            Implore with black oblations; through their breast <lb/>
            Religion thus with ten-fold force propelled. <lb n="55"/>
            Through doubtful dangers, hence, through straits Severa <lb/>
            Pursue the race of man; then sole ascends <lb/>

            Striving the crowd t' o'ertop—these pests of life <lb/>

            For infamy, contempt, and want severe, <lb/>
            These chief embitter mortals; these, they deem, <lb/>
            Death's foremost train ; and, studious these to shun, <lb/>
            Far off they fly, still wand'ring from the right, <lb/>

            Ceaseless, their stores insatiate: raptured high <lb/>

            And with mistrust, through every nerve alarmed, <lb/>
            Joining the feast some jovial kinsman forms. <lb n="75"/>
            </p>
          <p>From the same source, the same deep dread of death. <lb/>
            Springs ENVY poisoning all things: mortals, hence, <lb/>
            Lament to power that this, to glory that, <lb/>
            Crowned with the people's plaudits should ascend, <lb/>
            While all unnoticed, mid the crowd obscure<lb n="80"/>
            Themselves still jostle; pining every hour, <lb/>
            For names, for statues; and, full oft, so strong <lb/>
            From dread of death, hate they the light of heaven, <lb/>
            That, sick at heart, through their own breast they plunge <lb/>
            The fatal steel: heedless that this alone, <lb n="85"/>
            This pungent dread, engenders all their cares, <lb/>
            Nips the keen sense of shame-turns friends to foes, <lb/>
            And bursts the bonds that harmonize the heart. <lb/>
            For, goaded hence, hell ever in his sight, <lb/>
            Man oft betrays his country; and, for gold, <lb n="90"/>
            Yields up the reverend form that gave him birth. <lb/>
            For as the boy, when midnight veils the skies, <lb/>
            Trembles and starts at all things-so, full oft, <lb/>
            E'en in the noon, men start at forms as void <lb/>
            Of real danger as the phantoms false <lb n="95"/>
            By darkness conjured, and the schoolboy's dread. <lb/>
            A terror this the radiant darts of day <lb/>
            Can ne'er disperse. To truth's pure light alone, <lb/>
            And wisdom yielding, intellectual suns.</p>
          <p>First, then, the mind, the spirit named at times, <pb n="364"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>That which controls, which measures sentient life, <lb n="100"/>
            Forms of this mortal make a part as clear <lb/>
            As the keen eye, the finger, or the foot. <lb/>
            Here cleave we firm, though many a sage contends <lb/>
            The mental sense no part specific frames, <lb n="105"/>
            But springs the vital product of the whole. <lb/>
            This the GREEK schools term HARMONY-A sense <lb/>
            Of living power while still th' essential soul <lb/>
            No point appropriates-as corporeal health <lb/>
            Flows not from sections, but the form entire. <lb n="110"/>
            Thus, deem they, springs the mind; a tenet fraught, <lb/>
            If right we judge, with error most absurd. <lb/>
            For oft th' external frame disease sustains, <lb/>
            While all escapes within: and thus, reversed, <lb/>
            The mind oft sickens while the body thrives: <lb n="115"/>
            As, when the gout the tortured foot. inflames, <lb/>
            The distant head still boasts its wonted ease. <lb/>
            When, too, sweet sleep o'er all the wearied limbs <lb/>
            Spreads his soft mantle, and locks every sense, <lb/>
            Still something stirs within us—something urged, <lb n="120"/>
            E'en then, to various motions, and alive <lb/>
            To joy's glad impulse, or fictitious fears.</p>
          <p>Yet more; to prove the soul a part exists <lb/>
            Constituent of the body-to subvert <lb/>
            This fancied HARMONy-mark oft how life <lb n="125"/>
            Mid the dread loss of many a limb endures; <lb/>
            While instant as the vital heat but ebbs, <lb/>
            The vital breath flies off—pulsation stops, <lb/>
            And heart and limb all lifeless lie alike. <lb/>
            Hence may'st thou judge that not in every part <lb n="130"/>
            Dwells the same portion of percipient power, <lb/>
            Nor health from each flows equal; but that those <lb/>
            Chief nurture life, and check its flight abrupt, <lb/>
            Reared from aerial seeds, or fluent heat. <lb/>
            As these exist, then, heat and vital air, <lb n="135"/>
            Health through the members sickens or abounds.</p>
          <p>This proved precise-that soul, that mind exists <lb/>
            Part of the body-let such sages still <lb/>
            Hold the term HARMONY—deduced, perchance, <lb/>
            From the sweet chords of Helicon; let such <lb n="140"/>
            Still something mean, whatever that something be, <pb n="365"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>No name of theirs expresses: thou, meanwhile, <lb/>
            Quitting such contests, mark what yet remains.</p>
          <p>The soul, the mind, then, one same substance forms <lb/>
            Minutely blended; but, in vulgar phrase, <lb n="145"/>
            That call we mind, or spirit, which pervades, <lb/>
            As chief, the heart’s deep avenues, and rules <lb/>
            The total frame. Here grief, and terror spring, <lb/>
            Here pleasure plays ; and here we hence conceive <lb/>
            Dwells mind, or spirit; while the remnant soul, <lb n="150"/>
            Through every limb diffused, the mind's dread nod <lb/>
            Obeys, and yields submissive to its will. <lb/>
            Of its own powers, mind reasons and exults, <lb/>
            While soul, like flesh, can never rouse alone. <lb/>
            As oft the head, or eye, some anguish keen <lb n="155"/>
            Sustains, while yet the general frame escapes, <lb/>
            So, in itself, the mind, full oft, endures <lb/>
            Rapture or pain, while yet the soul at large, <lb/>
            Spread through the members, nought of change perceives. <lb/>
            But when the mind some shock severe subdues, <lb n="160"/>
            The total soul then sympathizes: then, <lb/>
            Should deadly horror sway o'er all the frame <lb/>
            Spreads the cold sweat, the livid paleness spreads, <lb/>
            Clouds dim the sight, the palsied tongue is mute, <lb/>
            Tingles the ear, and every limb dissolves. <lb n="165"/>
            Oft, too, from mental terror faints the frame: <lb/>
            Whence may'st thou mark how close the bond that knits <lb/>
            The soul and spirit; this exciting that, <lb/>
            And that, when roused, deep-rousing every nerve.</p>
          <p>Hence prove we, too, that both alike exist <lb n="170"/>
            Corporeal:—hence, since every member yields <lb/>
            With quick submission to the joint behest: <lb/>
            Since bursts from sleep the body, since the face <lb/>
            Obsequious varies, and the total man <lb/>
            Feels the full sway profound; for nought can act <lb n="175"/>
            Where touch subsists not, nor can touch subsist <lb/>
            Void of corporeal base :-can we, then, doubt <lb/>
            That soul, that spirit must corporeal spring ?</p>
          <p>In all, moreover, of ease or anguish keen <lb/>
            The body feels, the assenting mind partakes. <lb n="180"/>
            Thus, when some deadly dart through many a nerve, <lb/>
            Mid many a bone, tremendous, winds its way <pb n="366"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Quick faints the spirit :-a fond wish to die <lb/>
            Now sways, and now the native love of life. <lb/>
            Material, hence, the mental frame must live, <lb n="185"/>
            Since by material arms so soon assailed.</p>
          <p>Now list attentive, while we next unfold <lb/>
            Its make mysterious, and to sight educe.</p>
          <p>First, then, we firm maintain the mind results <lb/>
            From seeds of matter, most minute and smooth. <lb n="190"/>
            This hence we prove, that nought so swiftly speeds <lb/>
            As what the mind determines and completes ; <lb/>
            The mind, whose keen rapidity o’erpowers <lb/>
            All that the sight marks instantaneous most. <lb/>
            But what thus rapid moves, from seeds must spring <lb n="195"/>
            Most exquisitely subtile, and rotund, <lb/>
            Roused into action by minutest force. <lb/>
            Thus moves the fluent stream, urged on with ease, <lb/>
            Since reared from atoms polished, and exile, <lb/>
            While the tough honey, of compactor frame, <lb n="200"/>
            More tardy flows, and ampler force demands. <lb/>
            For more tenacious here the total mass, <lb/>
            From heavier seeds engendered, tenuous less, <lb/>
            And less globose. Thus zephyrs gentlest breath <lb/>
            Wide scatters, oft, the seeds the poppy rears, <lb n="205"/>
            Heaped in the sun-beam,—while the grosser mass <lb/>
            Of congregated stones, or missile darts <lb/>
            Feels no impression. Hence material things <lb/>
            Move brisk or sluggish, as from atoms reared <lb/>
            Light and globose, or denser, and more rough. <lb n="210"/>
            </p>
          <p>Since then the mind, in every act, we trace <lb/>
            Most voluble, from seeds of subtlest size, <lb/>
            Rotund and light, its mystic make must spring: <lb/>
            A fact, 0 friend to truth! thou oft shalt find <lb/>
            Of utmost moment in what yet remains. <lb n="215"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hence learn we, too, of what attenuate frame <lb/>
            The mind consists ; and to what trivial space <lb/>
            Must shrink its texture if compacted close- <lb/>
            That, when in death the wearied body sleeps, <lb/>
            And soul and spirit wander from their post, <lb n="220"/>
            E'en then the sight no diminution marks <lb/>
            In weight or figure; death usurping sole <lb/>
            The warm-breathed vapour, and the vital senae.</p><pb n="367"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>From seeds minutest, hence, the soul entire Must flow,—through all the frame profusely poured; <lb n="225"/>
            And, e'en when fled, still leaving every limb <lb/>
            Its wonted weight, its figure most precise. <lb/>
            So, from the juice of BACCHUS, when flies off <lb/>
            Its flower ethereal, from the light perfume <lb/>
            When mounts the essential spirit, or from man <lb n="230"/>
            Th' excreted lymph exhales-the curious eye <lb/>
            Nought marks diminished,-the same weight survives, <lb/>
            Th' same fixt bulk, since from minutest seeds <lb/>
            Springs the light scent, the ethereal spirit springs.</p>
          <p>Hence doubly flows it why the mind's pure frame <lb n="235"/>
            Must, too, be reared from seeds of subtlest size,- <lb/>
            Hence, as its flight to visual change creates, <lb/>
            But bulk alike, and substance still endure.</p>
          <p>Yet not unmixt its nature : the light gas <lb/>
            Breathed from the dying, in its texture blends <lb n="240"/>
            Heat, air, and vapour, ever each with each <lb/>
            Compacted ; vapour, in its ample pores, <lb/>
            Absorbing heat, and heat ethereal air.</p>
          <p>Triple the substance, hence, the soul that builds ; <lb/>
            Yet e'en the whole perception ne'er can form: <lb n="245"/>
            For nought in each subsists of power t' excite <lb/>
            Those sensile motions whence perception flows. <lb/>
            Hence some fourth substance, doubtless, must we deem, <lb/>
            Conjoint existing ; which, though void of name, <lb/>
            Springs from minutest atoms, lightest most <lb n="250"/>
            And most attenuate; deep-endowed with power <lb/>
            Of fleetest speed, and hence, that first begets <lb/>
            Those sensile movements that the frame pervade. <lb/>
            This first begets, as formed from subtlest seeds, <lb/>
            Next heat the incipient action, vapour next <lb n="255"/>
            Partakes, and air posterior, till the soul <lb/>
            Rouses throughout: then flows the blood, then feels <lb/>
            Each vital organ,-till, through every bone, <lb/>
            E'en to its central marrow, winds, in turn, <lb/>
            The sinuous rapture, or the sense of pain. <lb n="260"/>
            Yet pain, thus deep within, can never pierce <lb/>
            With keen corrosion, but the total man <lb/>
            Shakes from his basis-life no more subsists, <lb/>
            And the light soul through every pore flies off. <pb n="368"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III <lb/>
            </note>Hence less profound descends, in general ills, <lb n="265"/>
            Th' excited action, and man still survives.</p>
          <p>And here, in phrase appropriate, would we prove <lb/>
            In what firm bonds, what various modes, the make <lb/>
            Of each with each commixes, but the dearth <lb/>
            Of terms select restrains us; yet attend <lb n="270"/>
            While thus our utmost efforts we essay.</p>
          <p>Each primal substance, then, with each coheres <lb/>
            In every act so firm that nought conceived <lb/>
            Can sever; nought can central space admit; <lb/>
            But as the powers they live of one joint frame. <lb n="275"/>
            As the fresh victim blends in every limb <lb/>
            Heat, taste, and odour, while the total builds <lb/>
            But one compacted mass, so here, alike, <lb/>
            But one same nature flows from heat and air, <lb/>
            And mystic vapour, and the power unnamed <lb n="280"/>
            That rears the incipient stimulus, and first <lb/>
            Darts sentient motion through the quivering frame. <lb/>
            Far from all vision this profoundly lurks, <lb/>
            Through the whole system's utmost depth diffused, <lb/>
            And lives as soul of e'en the soul itself. <lb n="285"/>
            As with each limb the general spirit blends, <lb/>
            Though ne'er discerned, so subtle and so few <lb/>
            Its primal seeds-so, through the spirit, spreads <lb/>
            This form ineffable, this mystic power, <lb/>
            Soul of the soul, and lord of mortal man. <lb n="290"/>
            Thus, too, commixt must vapour, heat, and air, <lb/>
            Live through each limb united; and, though oft <lb/>
            Each rise o'er each triumphant, still uprear <lb/>
            One frame harmonious, lest the power of air, <lb/>
            Of heat, or vapour, each from each disjoined, <lb n="295"/>
            Mar all sensation, and fly off dissolved.</p>
          <p>Heat springs superior in the mind enraged, <lb/>
            When burns the total system, and the eye <lb/>
            Darts forth its lurid lightnings: vapour chill <lb/>
            The ascendance gains when fear the frame pervades, <lb n="300"/>
            And ruthless HORROR, shivering every limb; <lb/>
            While the pure air, of tranquillizing power, <lb/>
            Smooths all the visage, and the soul serenes. <lb/>
            Heat sways, as urged already, in the form <lb/>
            With acrid breast, that rouses soon to ire , <pb n="369"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Chief in the rampant lion, whose proud heart <lb n="305"/>
            Bursts with impetuous roaring, nor can bound <lb/>
            Th* infuriate tide that ceaseless raves within. <lb/>
            For ampler vapour mark the timid deer: <lb/>
            Quick spreads its chilling dew through every limb <lb n="310"/>
            In many a tremor quivering ; while the ox <lb/>
            Proves, through his placid life, a temper formed <lb/>
            From air supreme. Him ne'er the torch of ire <lb/>
            Maddens abrupt in clouds and smoke involved, <lb/>
            Nor shuddering fear transfixes; but, remote, <lb n="315"/>
            'Twixt both he stands, and lifts his honest front, <lb/>
            The trembling deer, the lion gaunt and grim.</p>
          <p>Thus varies man: though education trim <lb/>
            Add its bland polish, frequent still we trace <lb/>
            The first deep print of nature on the soul, <lb n="320"/>
            Nor aught can all-erase it: ever, whence, <lb/>
            This yields to sudden rage, to terror that, <lb/>
            While oft a third beyond all right betrays <lb/>
            A heart of mercy. Thus, in various modes, <lb/>
            The moral temper, and symphonious life <lb n="325"/>
            Must differ; thus from many a cause occult <lb/>
            The sage can ne'er resolve, nor human speech <lb/>
            Find phrase t' explain ; so boundless, so complex, <lb/>
            The primal sources whence the variance flows! <lb/>
            Yet this the muse may dictate that so few <lb n="330"/>
            The native traces wisdom ne'er can rase, <lb/>
            Man still may emulate the gods in bliss.</p>
          <p>Thus through each limb th' impressive spirit spreads, <lb/>
            Lord of the body, the prime fount of health, <lb/>
            Thus with each limb in league so close combines <lb n="335"/>
            Nought void of death can sever them in twain. <lb/>
            As the clear frankincense its fond perfume <lb/>
            Can ne'er desert till both together die, <lb/>
            So, from the flesh, the spirit and the soul <lb/>
            Part not till each one common fate dissolve. <lb n="340"/>
            So live they mutual, so, from earliest birth, <lb/>
            In intertwined existence, that apart, <lb/>
            Nor this nor that perception can possess, <lb/>
            The joint result of each, by effort joint <lb/>
            First kindled, and through all the frame diffused. <lb n="345"/>
            </p>
          <p>This frame, moreo'er, alone can never spring, <note type="footnote">2 a </note> <pb n="370"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Can never thrive, the dread attack of death <lb/>
            Can never conquer. For, with aim sublime, <lb/>
            Though the light vapour from the tepid lymph <lb/>
            Fly off profuse, while yet the lymph itself <lb n="350"/>
            Exists uninjured-the deserted limbs <lb/>
            Not harmless, thus, can bear the soul's escape, <lb/>
            Doomed to one ruin, and one common grave. <lb/>
            So, from their first crude birth, the vital acts <lb/>
            Of soul and body each solicits each <lb n="355"/>
            With fond contagion, from the earliest hour <lb/>
            The new-formed fetus quickens in the womb, <lb/>
            No power can sever them devoid of death.- <lb/>
            Since life but flows, then, from the two combined, <lb/>
            Combined alone their natures must subsist. <lb n="360"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hence those who hold the body never feels, <lb/>
            But sole the spirit through the body poured, <lb/>
            Each vital fact oppose: for how, resolve, <lb/>
            Could man e'er deem the body crowned with sense <lb/>
            But from such facts instructed and confirmed ? <lb n="365"/>
            True-body feels not when the spirit flies, <lb/>
            For sense from each springs mutual, and, in death, <lb/>
            Not sense alone is lost, but much besides.</p>
          <p>To deem the eyes, then, of themselves survey <lb/>
            Nought in existence, while th' interior mind <lb n="370"/>
            Looks at all nature through them as alone <lb/>
            Through loop-holes, is to trifle—sight itself <lb/>
            The creed absurd opposing every hour. <lb/>
            For oft the eye-ball dares not meet the day, <lb/>
            The flood of light overpowering: but were eyes <lb n="375"/>
            The mind's mere loop-holes, toil were never theirs. <lb/>
            Then too, each portal the reflected beam <lb/>
            Must more obstruct than usher ;-and, removed, <lb/>
            Th' exulting mind must drink a double day.</p>
          <p>Nor be the sacred doctrine here advanced <lb n="380"/>
            Urged by DEMOCRITUS, that soul extends <lb/>
            Atom for atom, through the total frame, <lb/>
            With grosser body: for as less of size <lb/>
            The soul's primordial seeds than those that rear <lb/>
            Th' organic structure, so in number too <lb n="385"/>
            Yield they,-less freely through the limbs diffused. <lb/>
            Hence may'st thou rather deem the soul'is pure seeds <pb n="371"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Placed at such intervals as just suffice <lb/>
            To rouse alone when needful, through the frame, <lb/>
            Percipient motions. For full oft the dust <lb n="390"/>
            Blown by the breeze, or fine fugacious chalk, <lb/>
            Lights on the limbs unheeded: so, at eve, <lb/>
            The dews we feel not, nor the silky threads <lb/>
            By dexterous spider spun from spray to spray <lb/>
            That twine around us,—nor the tattered web <lb n="395"/>
            From some old roof that on the hair descends, <lb/>
            Nor the soft down of feathers, nor the gOBS <lb/>
            Sportive and light, that scarcely falls at last. <lb/>
            Nor live we conscious, frequent, of the tread <lb/>
            Of animalcules, or the secret path, <lb n="400"/>
            O'er all our frame, the busy gnat pursues. <lb/>
            For many a primal seed, that rears at large <lb/>
            Each member, must be stimulated first, <lb/>
            Ere the keen atoms of the soul, hence roused, <lb/>
            Engender sense, through every severing space <lb n="405"/>
            Blending, rebounding, and reblending still.</p>
          <p>But 'tis the mind guards chief the gates of life, <lb/>
            And than the soul with ampler vigour sways. <lb/>
            For, without mind or spirit, soul itself <lb/>
            In no one portion through the man can live <lb n="410"/>
            E'en for a moment: as companion fond <lb/>
            With speed it follows, dissipated wide, <lb/>
            And leaves the limbs beneath the ice of death: <lb/>
            While he whose mind, whose spirit safe subsists, <lb/>
            Still holds existence, though th' exterior form <lb n="415"/>
            Throughout be mangled; e'en though much of soul, <lb/>
            Though every limb be lost, he still survives <lb/>
            Deep in the remnant trunk; the vital air <lb/>
            Still breathes, and lingers out his joyless hours. <lb/>
            Thus, though the visual orb be wounded, still, <lb n="420"/>
            If safe the central pupil, sight remains: <lb/>
            Where'er descends the blow, should this alone <lb/>
            Elude its vengeance, ruin ne'er ensues. <lb/>
            But, if of this the least existent point <lb/>
            Once suffer, though the total else escape, <lb n="425"/>
            Light fails immediate, and dread darkness reigns. <lb/>
            Such the connexion 'twixt the soul and mind.</p>
          <p>Now mark profound: to teach thee how this soul, <note type="footnote">2 B 2 </note> <pb n="372"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>This subtle spirit, with th' external frame <lb/>
            Begot, alike must perish,-next the muse <lb n="430"/>
            Shall pour forth numbers thine illustrious birth <lb/>
            Well worthy, and with sweetest labour culled. <lb/>
            This chief observe, that either phrase assumes <lb/>
            Here a like import; and that when we urge <lb/>
            The soul is mortal, this the mind includes: <lb n="435"/>
            Such their joint bond, their close connexion such.</p>
          <p>First, having proved, then, this attenuate power <lb/>
            From subtlest atoms reared, minuter far <lb/>
            Than those of water, smoke, or buoyant mist, <lb/>
            Since much in speed it conquers, and, by force <lb n="440"/>
            Far less, is roused to action-for full oft <lb/>
            E'en the faint phantasms of such forms alone <lb/>
            The soul excites, as when, in deep repose, <lb/>
            The fragrant altar smokes, and vapours rich <lb/>
            Rise to the view-a sense, no doubt, induced <lb n="445"/>
            From the light phantasms of substantial forms <lb/>
            Floating around us—this already proved, <lb/>
            Judge next, since lymph when bursts th' enclosing vase, <lb/>
            Flows at each fracture, since fugacious smoke, <lb/>
            Since vapours vanish into viewless air, <lb n="450"/>
            Judge how the soul must dissipate amain, <lb/>
            How sooner perish, and its primal seeds <lb/>
            Speedier dissolve, when once the flesh they quit. <lb/>
            For since this flesh, the vase the soul that bounds, <lb/>
            Bounds it no more when bruised by foreign force, <lb n="455"/>
            Or of its life-blood robbed,-how canst thou deem <lb/>
            Th' unsolid ether, or that aught more rare <lb/>
            Than flesh itself, the soul can e'er confine ?</p>
          <p>The mind, moreover, as every hour confirms, <lb/>
            Springs with the body, with the body grows, <lb n="460"/>
            And yields alike to- years. The tottering babe, <lb/>
            Weakly of limb, betrays a mind as weak: <lb/>
            But, as his strength matures, his vigorous soul <lb/>
            Ripens in reason, till in equal hour, <lb/>
            As age overcomes, and every organ fails, <lb n="465"/>
            Fail too his mental powers: then raves the tongue, <lb/>
            The judgment raves, the total man declines, <lb/>
            And, in a moment, all alike expires. <lb/>
            Hence the whole nature of this reasoning frame <pb n="373"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Must all dissolve, as smoke in ambient air, <lb n="470"/>
            Hence since, as urged above, all springs alike, <lb/>
            All ripens gradual, and together droops.</p>
          <p>As, too, the body feels full oft the force <lb/>
            Of bitter pains, and many a huge disease- <lb/>
            So strives the mind with grief, and cruel care, <lb n="475"/>
            Hence proved partaker of one common fate.</p>
          <p>In many an ill, moreover, the flesh sustains, <lb/>
            The judgment suffers: the distracted wretch <lb/>
            Now raving wild, and sinking, now profound <lb/>
            In stupid slumber; his fixt eyeballs stare, <lb n="480"/>
            His head hangs heavy, sound no more is heard, <lb/>
            Nor the fond visage noticed e'en of those, <lb/>
            Who yet, yet calling back to life, bedew <lb/>
            With many a tear his mouth and cheeks suffused. <lb/>
            Hence must the mind too, with the body cease, <lb n="485"/>
            Since by diseases thus alike transfixt: <lb/>
            For grief, for sickness, equal, the dread work <lb/>
            Of death accomplish, as each hour confirms.</p>
          <p>Why, too, when once the pungent power of wine <lb/>
            Flies through the system, and the blood inflames, <lb n="490"/>
            Why torpid grows each organ ? reels each limb ? <lb/>
            Falters the tongue ? rebels the maddening mind ? <lb/>
            Why swim the eyes ? and hiccough, noise and strife, <lb/>
            And each oonsociate ill their force combine ? <lb/>
            Why but that deep the frantic bowl disturbs, <lb n="495"/>
            Ev'n in the body, the secluded mind ? <lb/>
            But what can once be thus disturbed-what once <lb/>
            Impeded-should the hostile power augment, <lb/>
            Must perish, doubtless, void of future days.</p>
          <p>Oft, too, some wretch, before our startled sight, <lb n="500"/>
            Struck, as with lightning, by some keen disease, <lb/>
            Drops sudden :-by the dread attack overpowered, <lb/>
            He foams, he groans, he trembles, and he faints; <lb/>
            Now rigid, now convulsed, his labouring lungs <lb/>
            Heave quick, and quivers each exhausted limb. <lb n="505"/>
            Spread through the frame, so deep the dire disease <lb/>
            Perturbs his spirit; as the briny main <lb/>
            Foams through each wave beneath the tempest's ire. <lb/>
            He groans, since every member smarts with pain, <lb/>
            .And from his inmost breast, with wontless toil, <pb n="374"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Confused, and harsh, articulation springs. <lb n="510"/>
            He raves, since soul and spirit are alike <lb/>
            Disturbed throughout, and severed each from each, <lb/>
            As urged above, distracted by the bane. <lb/>
            But when, at length, the morbid cause declines, <lb n="515"/>
            And the fermenting humours from the heart <lb/>
            Flow back-with staggering foot the man first treads, <lb/>
            Led gradual on to intellect and strength.</p>
          <p>Since, then, the soul such various ills endures, <lb/>
            E'en in this solid frame,-such various modes <lb n="520"/>
            Feels of severe distraction—canst thou deem, <lb/>
            In the wide air unsheltered and forlorn, <lb/>
            Mid boisterous winds, it ever could exist ?</p>
          <p>And as the mind, like body, when diseased <lb/>
            Heals oft, and owns the genial power of drugs, <lb n="525"/>
            Hence springs a proof that mind is mortal too. <lb/>
            For he the secret soul, or aught besides, <lb/>
            Who fain would change, must lessen or augment <lb/>
            Its primal atoms, or combine anew: <lb/>
            But things immortal ne'er can be transposed, <lb n="530"/>
            Ne'er take addition, or encounter loss. <lb/>
            For what once changes, by the change alone <lb/>
            Subverts immediate its anterior life.</p>
          <p>Sickening, or healed, then, by balsamic herbs, <lb/>
            The seeds of death alike the soul betrays. <lb n="535"/>
            So triumph facts o'er all the sophistis art <lb/>
            Precluding answer, doubly silenced here.</p>
          <p>Of man, moreover, by slow degrees, we mark, <lb/>
            Limb after limb consume: first the pale toes, <lb/>
            The nails grow livid; in succession next <lb n="540"/>
            The feet, and legs; till gradual, o'er the frame, <lb/>
            Creeps the chill track of death.-Since, then, the soul <lb/>
            Thus suffers, nor one moment can resist <lb/>
            Sound, and entire, its make must mortal prove. <lb/>
            But should'st thou deem, when thus assailed, it shrinks <lb n="545"/>
            Back through each member, to one point condensed- <lb/>
            Then must that point, towards which the soul retreats, <lb/>
            Throng with increased sensation: but as this <lb/>
            Time ne'er evinces, it must still disperse <lb/>
            Like tattered shreds by every wind destroyed. <lb n="550"/>
            </p>
          <p>Yet grant the converse, and the soul allow <pb n="375"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>In those concentrates, gradual who decline ;— <lb/>
            Say what imports it whether wide it waste <lb/>
            From limb to limb, or perish from one point ? <lb/>
            Still more and more sensation fails, and life <lb n="555"/>
            Less and still less its dwindled power sustains.</p>
          <p>Since, too, the mind forms part of man, and dwells <lb/>
            In one fixt spot, as dwells the eye or ear, <lb/>
            Or aught besides of sense that governs life ; <lb/>
            And since, moreover, the sight, the hand, the nose, <lb n="560"/>
            Once severed from us, feel not, nor exist, <lb/>
            Dissolving instant-so the mind alike <lb/>
            Lives not alone without th' exterior frame, <lb/>
            Which like a vessel holds it, or aught else, <lb/>
            If aught there be, of bond compactor still. <lb n="565"/>
            So to the body cleaves th' adhesive mind.</p>
          <p>The vital power, moreover, of each subsists <lb/>
            Alone conjoint, for mutual is their life. <lb/>
            Nor without body can the soul fulfil <lb/>
            Its destined functions, nor the body live <lb n="570"/>
            Of soul devoid, participant of sense. <lb/>
            As the bare eye, when rooted from its orb, <lb/>
            Sees nought around it, spirit thus and soul <lb/>
            Nought can accomplish singly;—hence diffused <lb/>
            Through every vessel, organ, bone, and nerve, <lb n="575"/>
            Of all that breathes. Nor part their primal seeds <lb/>
            With long interstice, fatal to the power <lb/>
            Of resilition; rather so confined, <lb/>
            As sensile motions fits them best t' excite: <lb/>
            Such as, at death, when mixt with vacant air, <lb n="580"/>
            'Twere vain to expect, of all restraint devoid. <lb/>
            For air itself must body first become <lb/>
            Compact and vital, ere the secret soul <lb/>
            Its pores can tenant, or those motions urge, <lb/>
            Urged, during life, through all the sentient frame. <lb n="585"/>
            Hence doubly flows it why the soul and mind, <lb/>
            One in themselves, of body when disrobed, <lb/>
            And scattered boundless, instant should dissolve.</p>
          <p>Since, too, the body the departed soul <lb/>
            Endures not, but with putrid smell decays, <lb n="590"/>
            Canst thou, then, doubt the soul, when thus effused, <lb/>
            Like smoke flies total, every seed disperst? <pb n="376"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>And that th' external frame thus sinks defiled <lb/>
            In putrid death, since from their wonted posts <lb/>
            Urged off, through every passage, every pore, <lb n="595"/>
            Press the percipient seeds, from every limb, <lb/>
            From every membrane o'er the system spread ? <lb/>
            And seest thou not, from many a fact hence proved, <lb/>
            That through the total body lives the soul, <lb/>
            And e'en in body severs, seed from seed, <lb n="600"/>
            Ere thence expelled, and scattered into air ?</p>
          <p>E'en during life the fractured soul seems oft <lb/>
            From force abrupt half-hurried from her home; <lb/>
            Each vital function failing, and the face, <lb/>
            As though in death, all pallid, changed, and wan. <lb n="605"/>
            Such the deep swoon evinces, when within <lb/>
            Sinks the faint spirit, and each prostrate power <lb/>
            Pants for its final doom. Such then the force <lb/>
            That mind and body oft alike unnerves <lb/>
            That, but the least augmented, death ensues. <lb n="610"/>
            </p>
          <p>Can, then, the soul, thus impotent of frame, <lb/>
            When once disrobed, abandoned, and exposed, <lb/>
            Through the wide air, to every boisterous breeze, <lb/>
            Can it then triumph, dost thou firmly deem, <lb/>
            Not o'er all time, but e'en one moment live? <lb n="615"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor do the dying e'er the soul perceive <lb/>
            Rush out entire, when exiled from the heart, <lb/>
            The bronchial tube first filling, then the throat, <lb/>
            And mouth successive; but at once it fails <lb/>
            In its own region, as each sense alike <lb n="620"/>
            Fails in its destined theatre of power. <lb/>
            Were, too, its date immortal, man no more, <lb/>
            At his last hour, would mourn the severing blow: <lb/>
            Charmed to throw off his vesture, like the snake, <lb/>
            Or, like the stag his antlers, and be free. <lb n="625"/>
            </p>
          <p>Why, too, are wisdom and the mind restrained <lb/>
            To one sole organ, while the feet, the hands, <lb/>
            These never gender ? why but that each spot <lb/>
            Exists for some fixt function-nor can e'er <lb/>
            Pervert its destined view ? while, through the whole, <lb n="630"/>
            Nice order reigns by nought preposterous marred. <lb/>
            So flows the tide of things, nor water fire, <lb/>
            Through time, creates, nor fire the sparry frost. <pb n="377"/>

          <p><note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Were, too, the soul immortal, and possest Of ancient powers when severed from the flesh, <lb n="635"/>
            Then with new organs must it, or we err, <lb/>
            Be instant re-endowed; for thus alone <lb/>
            Th' infernal shades can tread the shores of hell. <lb/>
            Thus painters feign them, and the bards renowned <lb/>
            Of ancient times—thoughtless that eyes, and nose, <lb n="640"/>
            And hands, and mouth, to the divided soul <lb/>
            Can ne'er pertain, nor e'en the sense of sound.</p>
          <p>And since the total system soul pervades, <lb/>
            And vital action-when some blow severe <lb/>
            Midway divides it, part from part, abrupt, <lb n="645"/>
            Then must the soul alike be cleft in twain, <lb/>
            Driven with the mangled body. But what thus <lb/>
            Admits partition, and to foreign force <lb/>
            Yields e'en but once, immortal ne'er can be.</p>
          <p>Oft, arm'd with scythes, the warlike car, we read, <lb n="650"/>
            Hot with repeated slaughters, so abrupt <lb/>
            Severs a limb, that o'er the field it lies <lb/>
            With life long quivering, while the hero still <lb/>
            Fights on, of pain unconscious: his high soul <lb/>
            Absorbed so total, he nor heeds the loss <lb n="655"/>
            Of his broad shield, or shield-supporting hand, <lb/>
            Whirled in the strife of coursers, and of cars. <lb/>
            From this the sword-arm drops, while still the rock <lb/>
            He climbs impetuous; that, perchance, to earth <lb/>
            Felled, on one leg yet vainly strives to rise; <lb n="660"/>
            While, at his side, his amputated foot <lb/>
            Its trembling toes still moves. Thus, too, the head, <lb/>
            Whene'er dissevered from the vital trunk, <lb/>
            Still keeps its look of life, with open eye <lb/>
            Still stares, till all the gradual soul expire. <lb n="665"/>
            </p>
          <p>So should thy blade some serpent's length of tail <lb/>
            Divide, quick-brandishing its furious tongue, <lb/>
            The severed parts writhe, agonized, and broad <lb/>
            Scatter the purple fluid ; while himself <lb/>
            Looks round revengeful, and, from pain severe, <lb n="670"/>
            Gnashes the segments of his mangled frame.</p>
          <p>Shall we then say that each divided part <lb/>
            A perfect soul contains ? then with such souls <lb/>
            The total form, ere injured, must have thronged. <pb n="378"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Hence severs, then, the soul, though close combined, <lb n="675"/>
            Anterior, with the body; and hence, too, <lb/>
            Both must alike be mortal, since alike <lb/>
            To parts divisible with equal ease.</p>
          <p>Grant, too, the soul immortal, and infused, <lb/>
            At earliest birth, within us—whence, resolve, <lb n="680"/>
            This full oblivion of all past events, <lb/>
            All former life ?-for if the soul so change, <lb/>
            That nought remains of memory in its make, <lb/>
            A change so total differs scarce from death. <lb/>
            Thus, what before existed, must have ceased, <lb n="685"/>
            And on its ruins sprung what now exists.</p>
          <p>If the light soul, moreover, then only join <lb/>
            The full-formed body, when that body first <lb/>
            Springs into birth, and treads the porch of life, <lb/>
            Ne'er can it then, as though diffused at large, <lb n="690"/>
            E'en with the vital blood, through all the frame, <lb/>
            Grow with each growing member: but confined, <lb/>
            As in a den, in solitude must dwell, <lb/>
            From the first hour exciting equal sense. <lb/>
            Hence doubly flows it, souls can ne'er exist <lb n="695"/>
            Of birth devoid, nor free from final fate. <lb/>
            Nor could they, as each daily fact confirms, <lb/>
            If from without infused, the total frame <lb/>
            Fit with such nice precision : for so close <lb/>
            Blend they with every organ, bone, and nerve, <lb n="700"/>
            That e'en th' enamelled tooth sensation shares; <lb/>
            As oft its ache evinces, or the approach <lb/>
            Of ice abrupt; or when, beneath its gripe, <lb/>
            Grate some harsh pebble mid the subject food. <lb/>
            Nor thus connected could they e'er retreat <lb n="705"/>
            Safe, and uninjured through the sinuous paths <lb/>
            Of organs, membranes, vessels, bones, and nerves.</p>
          <p>But, from without, th' insinuating soul, <lb/>
            If still thou deem through all this frame diffused, <lb/>
            Then, since diffused, much surer must it fail; <lb n="710"/>
            For what thus flows diffusive, must dissolve, <lb/>
            And perish, doubtless, forced through every pore. <lb/>
            As vanish foods, through every mazy gland, <lb/>
            Through every limb when urged, to different forms <lb/>

            Dissolves by junction ; for through every sluice, <lb/>
            Through every organ intricate and fine, <lb/>
            Must percolate its atoms, severed hence, <lb/>
            And decomposed,-and hence the base alone <lb n="720"/>
            Of that which after sways th' external frame.</p>
          <p>Thus must the soul a natal day possess, <lb/>

          <p>Fly, too, at death, the soul's pure'seeds entire, <lb/>

            If aught remain, then idly must thou deem <lb/>
            The soul immortal, since diminished thus, <lb/>
            And shorn of substance; but if all escape, <lb/>
            If not an atom loiter-whence, I ask, <lb/>
            Rears the putrescent carcass, in its womb, <lb n="730"/>
            The race of worms ? or sport o'er every limb <lb/>
            The boneless, bloodless crowds of things unnamed ?</p>
          <p>If from without thou deem their souls they draw, <lb/>
            To each a soul entire, unheeding here <lb/>
            What throngs must flock where dwelt but one before, <lb n="735"/>
            Pause yet one moment ere thou thus resolve: <lb/>
            Such souls must, then, the vermin seeds themselves <lb/>
            Have wise-selected, and their fabrics reared, <lb/>
            Or into bodies entered ready formed. <lb/>
            But nor can reason, if themselves have raised <lb n="740"/>
            The wretched buildings, for the toil account, <lb/>
            Nor tell why thus for hunger, and disease, <lb/>
            And shivering cold they thirst, or aught besides <lb/>
            Of ill the body to the soul supplies. <lb/>
            Yet grant them anxious for such vile abodes, <lb n="745"/>
            Still must the structure far exceed their powers, <lb/>
            Hence reared not by themselves. Nor from without <lb/>
            Could they insinuate into bodies formed; <lb/>
            Since nor adapted to their sinuous pores, <lb/>

            For were the soul immortal, changing oft <lb n="760"/>
            To different bodies, different tempers, then, <lb/>
            Must mark each order; the HYRCANIAN dog <lb/>
            Oft, then, must dread the high-horned stag's approach; <lb/>
            Hawks fly from doves, e'en man himself turn brute, <lb/>
            And the brute tribes, preposterous, rule the world. <lb n="765"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor heed the sophistry which here contends <lb/>
            That souls oft change the body's change to meet: <lb/>
            For that which changes must dissolve, and die, <lb/>
            Severed its parts, its order all destroyed. <lb/>
            Hence souls must, too, dissolve through every limb, <lb n="770"/>
            And with the body share one common fate.</p>
          <p>But should'st thou urge that human souls their flight <lb/>
            To human forms restrain-then, since once wise, <lb/>
            To folly why relapse ? why spring not boys <lb/>
            Replete with wisdom ? nor displays the colt <lb n="775"/>
            The skilful paces of the steed mature ? <lb/>
            Why but that some fixt power of mind descends <lb/>
            E'en with the lineal seed through all begot, <lb/>
            Evolving gradual with the gradual growth ? <lb/>
            Nor think the soul, too, weakens in a weak <lb n="780"/>
            And puny system, since most surely then <lb/>
            Doomed to destruction ; by the change sustained <lb/>
            Shorn of its vigour, and interior sense.</p>
          <p>Why, if endeared not by one common birth, <lb/>
            Thus should it pant in equal hour to reach <lb n="785"/>
            Perfection with the body ? or, reversed, <lb/>
            Why long for freedom when the frame decays ? <lb/>
            Fears, then, the soul confinement after death <lb/>
            Mid the foul members ? or the dangerous fall <lb/>
            Of its own tottering mansion ? But, reflect, <lb n="790"/>
            What lives immortal, danger ne'er can know.</p>
          <p>What, too, so idle, as that souls should throng <lb/>
            Round each vile intercourse, or beast that bears: <lb/>
            Immortal souls ! contesting who shall first <lb/>
            Enter the feeble fetus; if, perchance, <lb n="795"/>
            This not decides them, and all strife precludes, <lb/>
            That who first gains it, claims a prior right. <pb n="381"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            Trees not in ether, not in ocean clouds, <lb/>
            Nor in the fields can fishes e'er exist; <lb/>
            Nor blood in planks, nor vital juice in stones; <lb n="800"/>
            But all springs definite in scenes defined. <lb/>
            So in the bosom lives, and there alone, <lb/>
            Mixt with its blood, and nerves, the secret mind: <lb/>
            There only lives,-for could it roam at all, <lb/>
            Then rather should we through the body's self, <lb n="805"/>
            The heel, or shoulder, or where else it chose, <lb/>
            Oft trace it wandering, than forlorn abroad. <lb/>
            Since e'en in body, then, the soul and mind <lb/>
            Are fixt thus definite—we amply prove <lb/>
            That out of body these can ne'er exist: <lb n="810"/>
            That when the flesh its certain doom sustains, <lb/>
            The soul must, too, through every limb dissolve.</p>
          <p>To deem, moreover, that mortal can combine <lb/>
            With aught immortal,-can together live <lb/>
            Concordant, and in mutual duties blend, <lb n="815"/>
            Is full delirium. Can there be conceived <lb/>
            Aught more unmeet, incongruous, or absurd, <lb/>
            Than with a mortal that a frame should mix <lb/>
            Immortal, doomed to all its weight of woe ?</p>
          <p>What lives immortal, too, must so exist, <lb n="820"/>
            Or from its own solidity, empowered <lb/>
            Each blow to conquer, undivided still, <lb/>
            As primal atoms, long anterior sung; <lb/>
            Or since, like vacuum, of all friction void, <lb/>
            Free from all touch, by impulse unimpaired; <lb n="825"/>
            Or from the want of circling space, in which <lb/>
            The severing atoms may dissolve and fall; <lb/>
            Such want the boundless whole of nature proves, <lb/>
            And hence eternal-for no place beyond <lb/>
            Spreads, where its seeds could waste; nor, from without, <lb/>
            Can foreign force e'er enter to destroy. <lb n="831"/>
            But nor, as urged above, exists the mind <lb/>
            All solid, since in all things void combines, <lb/>
            Nor yet all vacuum ; nor, from the profound, <lb/>
            Are wanting powers adverse that, into act <lb n="835"/>
            Once roused tempestuous, the whole mind derange, <lb/>
            Or sever total ;-nor deficient space <lb/>
            Spread widely round, through which, in countless modes, <pb n="382"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>The mental frame may crumble, and dissolve; <lb/>
            Hence not precluded from the gates of death. <lb n="840"/>
            </p>
          <p>But should'st thou still the soul immortal deem, <lb/>
            Since guarded deep from many a mortal wound, <lb/>
            Safe from full many an insult that assails <lb/>
            The health exterior, and since many a blow, <lb/>
            Aimed at its powers, discomfited recoils <lb n="845"/>
            Ere scarce ourselves the dread approach perceive, <lb/>
            Still far thou wanderest; for the common woes <lb/>
            Excluding that from body draw their birth, <lb/>
            Yet pines she anxious for to-morrow's fate, <lb/>
            Yet shakes with dread, with carking care consumes, <lb n="850"/>
            Or smarts from conscience of committed crimes. <lb/>
            Add, too, that madness is her own-that oft <lb/>
            All memory fails, and o'er each torpid power, <lb/>
            Creeps the dull pool of lethargy profound.</p>
          <p>Hence, death is nought, and justly claims our scorn, <lb n="855"/>
            Since with the body thus the soul decays. <lb/>
            And as we now, through long anterior time, <lb/>
            Look back indifferent on the PUNIC hosts <lb/>
            That threatened ROME, when, with the din of war, <lb/>
            All shook tremendous heaven's high cope beneath, <lb n="860"/>
            And doubtful hung the scale which power should rule <lb/>
            Earth, main, and mortals, with unrivalled sway; <lb/>
            So when we cease, and soul and body once <lb/>
            Meet their joint doom whose union formed our lives, <lb/>
            No ill shall then molest us,—nought alarm <lb n="865"/>
            Our scattered senses, and dissevered frame, <lb/>
            Though earth with main, or main commix with skies.</p>
          <p>E'en could the soul, the spirit still survive <lb/>
            The wreck corporeal, and perception boast, <lb/>
            To us what boots it, who exist alone <lb n="870"/>
            The joint result of soul and body mixt ? <lb/>
            To us what boots it, should some future time <lb/>
            Collect our atoms, the dismantled frame <lb/>
            Restore entire, and e'en with life relume, <lb/>
            When once the memory of ourselves is fled ? <lb n="875"/>
            We heed not now what erst, in time elapsed, <lb/>
            We have been, nor with anxious heart explore <lb/>
            What from our dust hereafter may arise: <lb/>
            For if thou weigh th' eternal tract of time <pb n="383"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Evolved already, and the countless modes<lb n="880"/>
            In which all matter moves, thou canst not doubt <lb/>
            That oft its atoms have the form assumed <lb/>
            We bear ourselves this moment-though the mind <lb/>
            Recalls not now those scenes of being past; <lb/>
            For many a pause the discontinuous chain <lb n="885"/>
            Of life has severed, and full many a mode <lb/>
            Of motion sprung to every sense adverse. <lb/>
            He to whom pain hereafter is decreed <lb/>
            Must then exist whene'er that pain arrives. <lb/>
            But as the man, whose atoms erst have lived, <lb n="890"/>
            Lives now unconscious of ills then sustained, <lb/>
            By death since decomposed, and every power <lb/>
            Of sense and memory scattered-hence we prove <lb/>
            Death holds no sting t' alarm us; that the man <lb/>
            To be who ceases, ceases from all woe ; <lb n="895"/>
            Nor aught imports it that he e'er was born, <lb/>
            When death immortal claims his mortal life.</p>
          <p>Should'st thou, then, mark some fool indignant burn <lb/>
            At this alone, that, when existence fails, <lb/>
            His corse may moulder, or in flames consume, <lb n="900"/>
            Or sate, perchance, the jaws of savage beasts- <lb/>
            Believe him not :-some secret dread still lurks <lb/>
            Of future pain, though e'en his lips deny <lb/>
            That sense or thought can after death exist. <lb/>
            Thus, if I err not, he conceals his creed, <lb n="905"/>
            Believes not life all-ceases, but that still <lb/>
            Some future self his present will survive. <lb/>
            For he who, living, shudders at the thought <lb/>
            That birds or beasts his frame may soon devour, <lb/>
            That frame divides not, but his self confounds <lb n="910"/>
            With his own future corse, whose dread decay <lb/>
            This self, he deems, must witness and partake. <lb/>
            Hence heaves his heart indignant at the doom <lb/>
            Of mortal man: heedless that, after death, <lb/>
            No other self shall then himself bemoan, <lb n="915"/>
            Nor feel the tooth that tears his mangled limbs. <lb/>
            If, too, the tiger's tusk, the vulture's beak, <lb/>
            Be deemed an ill—what lighter ill results <lb/>
            From the red fury of the funeral pyre ? <lb/>
            The fulsome tide of honey, o'er the frame <pb n="384"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>Poured, cold and stiffening in the marble tomb ? <lb n="920"/>
            Or the sunk grave, by earth's vast pressure crushed ?</p>
          <p>" But thy dear home shall never greet thee more! <lb/>
            No more the best of wives!—thy babes beloved, <lb/>
            Whose haste half-met thee, emulous to snatch <lb n="925"/>
            The dulcet kiss that roused thy secret soul, <lb/>
            Again shall never hasten !-nor thine arm, <lb/>
            With deed heroic, guard thy country's weal!- <lb/>
            O mournful, mournful fate!" thy friends exclaim, <lb/>
            " One envious hour of these invalued joys <lb n="930"/>
            Robs thee for ever!"—But they add not here, <lb/>
            " It robs thee, too, of all desire of joy” <lb/>
            A truth, once uttered, that the mind would free <lb/>
            From every dread, and trouble. " Thou art safe! <lb/>
            The sleep of death protects thee ! and secures <lb n="935"/>
            From all th' unnumbered woes of mortal life! <lb/>
            While we, alas ! the sacred urn around <lb/>
            That holds thine ashes, shall insatiate weep, <lb/>
            Nor time destroy th' eternal grief we feel!" <lb/>
            What then has death, if death be mere repose, <lb n="940"/>
            And quiet only in a peaceful grave, <lb/>
            What has it thus to mar this life of man ?</p>
          <p>Yet mar it does. E'en o'er the festive board, <lb/>
            The glass while grasping, and with garlands crowned, <lb/>
            The thoughtless maniacs oft indignant roar, <lb n="945"/>
            " How short the joys of wine !—e'en while we drink <lb/>
            Life ceases, and to-morrow ne'er returns!" <lb/>
            As if, in death, the worst such wretches feared <lb/>
            Were thirst unquenched, parching every nerve, <lb/>
            Or deemed their passions would pursue them still. <lb n="950"/>
            Not anxious, thus, mankind the world resign <lb/>
            At evening hour when soul and body rest; <lb/>
            Nor would they though that rest were ne'er to end: <lb/>
            Nor thus the day's desire pursues their dreams; <lb/>
            Though then the seeds of sense not wander far <lb n="955"/>
            From sensile movements, scarcely, oft, allayed, <lb/>
            And quick resumed when starts the soul at morn. <lb/>
            Of much less moment, then, should death be held <lb/>
            Than sleep, if aught can less than that which ne'er <lb/>
            Moment excites whatever; for the crowd <lb n="960"/>

            </note>Nor wakes he e'er to action, and the day, <lb/>
            Whose frame once feels the chilling pause of life.</p>
          <p>Were then THE NATURE OF CREATED THINGS <lb/>
            To rise abrupt, and thus repining man <lb n="965"/>
            Address—" 0 mortal! whence these useless fears ? <lb/>
            This weak, superfluous sorrow ? why th' approach <lb/>
            Dread'st thou of death? For if the time elapsed <lb/>
            Have smiled propitious, and not all its gifts, <lb/>
            As though adventured in a leaky vase, <lb n="970"/>
            Been idly wasted, profitless, and vain- <lb/>
            Why quitt'st thou not, thou fool! the feast of life <lb/>
            Filled,-and with mind all panting for repose ? <lb/>
            But if thyself have squandered every boon, <lb/>
            And of the past grown weary-why demand <lb n="975"/>
            More days to kill, more blessings to pervert, <lb/>
            Nor rather headlong hasten to thine end ? <lb/>
            For nothing further can my powers devise <lb/>
            To please thee ;-things for ever things succeed <lb/>
            Unchanged,—and would do, though revolving years <lb n="980"/>
            Should spare thy vigour, and thy brittle frame <lb/>
            Live o'er all time: e'en amplier would'st thou then <lb/>
            Mark how unvaried all creation moves."- <lb/>
            Were NATURE thus t' address us, could we fail <lb/>
            To feel the justice of her keen rebuke ? <lb n="985"/>
            So true the picture, the advice so sage !</p>
          <p>But to the wretch who moans th' approach of death <lb/>
            With grief unmeasured, louder might she raise <lb/>
            Her voice severe—“ Vile coward ! dry thine eyes- <lb/>
            Hence with thy snivelling sorrows, and depart!" <lb n="990"/>
            Should he, moreover, have past man's mid-day hour­ <lb/>
            " What! thou lament ? already who hast reaped <lb/>
            An ample harvest ? by desiring thus <lb/>
            The past once more, the present thou abhorr'st, <lb/>
            And life flies on imperfect, unenjoyed, <lb n="995"/>
            And death untimely meets thee, ere thy soul, <lb/>
            Cloyed with the banquet, is prepared to rise. <lb/>
            Leave, then, to others bliss thy years should shun ; <lb/>
            Come, cheerful leave it, since still leave thou must." <lb/>
            Justly I deem might NATURE thus reprove: <lb n="1000"/>
            For, through creation, old to young resigns, <lb/>
            And this from that matures; nor aught descends <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <pb n="386"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            To the dread gulfs, the fancied shades of hell. <lb/>
            The mass material must survive entire <lb/>
            To feed succeeding ages, which, in turn, <lb n="1005"/>
            Like thee shall flourish, and like thee shall die; <lb/>
            Nor more the present ruins than the past. <lb/>
            Thus things from things ascend; and life exists <lb/>
            To none a freehold, but a use to all.</p>
          <p>Reflect, moreover, how less than nought to us <lb n="1010"/>
            Weighs the long portion of eternal time <lb/>
            Fled ere our birth: so, too, the future weighs <lb/>
            When death dissolves us. What of horror, then, <lb/>
            Dwells there in death ? what gloomy, what austere ? <lb/>
            Can there be elsewhere slumber half so sound? <lb n="1015"/>
            </p>
          <p>The tales of hell exist not in the grave, <lb/>
            But here, and curse us living. TANTALUS, <lb/>
            With broad, rough rock impending o'er his head, <lb/>
            And crazed with terror, there is never seen: <lb/>
            But terror dwells with mortals—fate they fear, <lb n="1020"/>
            And fortune, and a host of fancied gods.</p>
          <p>Nor TITYUS there exists, the prey of birds. <lb/>
            Nor, though he did, could these the victim's breast <lb/>
            Consume for ever ; e'en though his wide bulk, <lb/>
            Not thrice three acres merely might extend, <lb n="1025"/>
            But cover the vast globe; nor could he bear <lb/>
            Eternal pain, nor yield perpetual food. <lb/>
            But he is TITYUS, and by vultures torn, <lb/>
            Whose anxious breast the rage of love devours; <lb/>
            Or aught of passion equal in its force. <lb n="1030"/>
            </p>
          <p>Here, too, is Sisyphus—the man who pants <lb/>
            For public honours, and the giddy crowd <lb/>
            Caresses ever, ever but in vain. <lb/>
            For thus to toil for power, itself at- best <lb/>
            A bubble, and that bubble ne'er to boast, <lb n="1035"/>
            Yet still toil on-is doubtless to roll back, <lb/>
            Up the high hill, the huge, stern, struggling stone; <lb/>
            That which, the steep peak once urged up, rebounds <lb/>
            Rapid, resistless, over all the plain.</p>
          <p>Then, too, to feed th' ungrateful mind, and fill <lb n="1040"/>
            With every good, while still it craves for more, <lb/>
            (As feed mankind the seasons in their turn, <lb/>
            With fruits, ana endless beauties, while themselves <pb n="387"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>

            This, or I err, the fable well unfolds, <lb n="1045"/>
            Feigned of the damsels doomed, in flower of youth, <lb/>
            To fill for ever the still leaking urn.</p>
          <p>The FURIES, CERBERUS, and HELL itself <lb/>
            Of light devoid, and belching from its jaws <lb/>
            Tremendous fires, live not, nor can they live: <lb n="1050"/>
            But well they paint the dread of justice here <lb/>
            For crimes atrocious, the reward of guilt, <lb/>
            The scourge, the wheel, the block, the dungeon deep, <lb/>
            The base-born hangman, the TARPEIAN cliff ; <lb/>
            Which, though the villain 'scape, his conscious soul <lb n="1055"/>
            Still fears perpetual, torturing all his days, <lb/>
            And still foreboding heavier pangs at death. <lb/>
            Hence earth itself to fools becomes a hell.</p>
          <p>Thus ponder oft, retired: ANcus the good, <lb/>
            E'en he has closed his eyes on mortal things; <lb n="1060"/>
            A man, thou coward ! worthier far than thou ! <lb/>
            Thousands, moreover, like him of crowns possest, <lb/>
            Have fall'n like him, and all their pomp resigned.</p>
          <p>E'en he who wandered o'er the mighty main, <lb/>
            Led on his legions, and first oped the way <lb n="1065"/>
            To tread on foot th' unfathomed gulfs below, <lb/>
            He who thus braved the billows, and the storms, <lb/>
            Has closed his eye-lids, and his soul resigned. —</p>
          <p>SCIPIO, the war's dread thunderbolt, the scourge <lb/>
            Of ransacked TYRE, sleeps, like the slave, inhumed. <lb n="1070"/>

            Add HOMER'S self the muses' realm who rules; <lb/>
            These all, like meaner mortals, rest in peace.—</p>
          <p>When hoary hairs DEMOCRITUS forewarned <lb n="1075"/>
            His mental powers were hastening to decay, <lb/>
            Quick he uprose, and midway met his fate.-</p>
          <p>E'en he is fallen, his lamp of life extinct, <lb/>
            Th' illustrious EPICURUS, whose vast mind <lb/>
            Triumphant rose o'er all men, and excelled, <lb n="1080"/>
            As, in the heavens, the sun excels the stars.</p>
          <p>And dost thou murmur, and indignant die, <lb/>
            Whose life, while living, scarcely death exceeds ? <lb/>
            Thou ! who in sleep devourest half thy days ? <note type="footnote">2 C 2 </note> <pb n="388"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>And, e'en awake, who snorest, dreaming still, <lb n="1085"/>
            And torturing all thy mind with vain alarms ? <lb/>
            Thou ! who lamentest, oft, unknowing why, <lb/>
            Urged on, with fear intoxicated deep, <lb/>
            And in a maze of mental errors lost ?</p>
          <p>Did men but think, and oft to think they seem, <lb n="1090"/>
            That from themselves their heaviest sorrows rise, <lb/>
            And knew they too whence thus themselves create <lb/>
            These bosom sufferings-seldom should we see <lb/>
            Life spent as now each passing hour portrays. <lb/>
            All pant perpetual for they know not what, <lb n="1095"/>
            Nor learn by searching-changing their abodes, <lb/>
            As though the change would leave their load behind.</p>
          <p>This, from mere listlessness, his mansion flies; <lb/>
            Straight he returns ;—’tis listless all abroad. <lb/>
            That to his villa posts, with rapid wheels, <lb n="1100"/>
            As though the building were in flames, and called <lb/>
            His instant aid.-No sooner treads his foot <lb/>
            The sounding hall, than, on the sofa thrown, <lb/>
            He yawns disgusted-or indulges sleep, <lb/>
            And seeks oblivion ; or, perchance, he starts, <lb n="1105"/>
            And towards the town drives back with equal speed.</p>
          <p>Thus each his self would fly, that self which still <lb/>
            Haunts every step, and every pain creates, <lb/>
            Heedless of what torments him: which if clear <lb/>
            The wanderer traced, his restless soul, at once <lb n="1110"/>
            The world forsaking, and the world's vain boasts, <lb/>
            Would scan THE NATURE OF CREATED THINGS. <lb/>
            For little weighs the passing hour of time <lb/>
            When with eternity compared, that state <lb/>
            Which, after death, to mortals yet remains. <lb n="1115"/>
            </p>
          <p>Through what vast woes this wild desire of life <lb/>
            Drives us, afraid ! what dangers, and what toils! <lb/>
            Yet death still hastens, nor can mortal man, <lb/>
            With all his efforts, turn th' unerring shaft.</p>
          <p>Life, through its circuit too, is still the same, <lb n="1120"/>
            Nor can it boast one source of new delight. <lb/>
            The bliss we covet seems, at distant view, <lb/>
            To all superior; but, when once possest, <lb/>
            It cloys, we spurn it, and another call. <lb/>
            Yet the same thirst of life corrodes us still, <pb n="389"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Though doubtful of to-morrow, and the fate <lb n="1125"/>
            To-morrow brings—our blessing, or our curse.</p>
          <p>E'en could we life elongate, we should ne'er <lb/>
            Subtract one moment from the reign of death, <lb/>
            Nor the deep slumber of the grave curtail. <lb n="1130"/>
            O'er ages could we triumph-death alike <lb/>
            Remains eternal-nor of shorter date <lb/>

          <p>PIERIAN paths I tread untrod before. <lb/>
            Sweet are the springing founts with nectar new, <lb/>
            Sweet the new flowers that bloom ; but sweeter still <lb/>
            Those flowers to pluck, and weave a roseate wreath <lb/>
            The muses yet to mortals ne'er have deigned.<lb n="5"/>
            With joy the subject I pursue, and free <lb/>
            The captive mind from Superstition's yoke: <lb/>
            With joy th* obscure illume; in liquid verse, <lb/>
            Graceful and clear, depicting all surveyed : <lb/>
            By reason guided. For as oft, benign, <lb n="10"/>
            The sapient nurse, when anxious to enforce <lb/>
            On the pale boy the wormwood's bitter draught, <lb/>
            With luscious honey tints the goblet's edge, <lb/>
            Deceiving thus, while yet unused to guile, <lb/>
            His unsuspecting lip, till deep he drinks, <lb n="15"/>
            And gathers vigour from the venial cheat;- <lb/>
            So I, since dull the subject, and the world <lb/>
            Abashed recoils; would fain, in honeyed phrase, <lb/>
            Tuned by the muses, to thine ear recite <lb/>
            Its vast concerns; if haply I may hope <lb n="20"/>
            To fix thine audience, whilp the flowing verse <lb/>
            Unfolds the nature, and the use of things.</p>
          <p>Since, then, our earlier strain the fact has proved <lb/>
            Of seeds primordial; how, in various forms, <lb/>
            Oft differing each from each, at will they roam, <pb n="390"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Urged on by ceaseless motion,-proved the mode <lb n="25"/>
            Whence all existing, thence exists alone: <lb/>
            Since, too, the mind's deep nature we have traced, <lb/>
            Whence first it springs, with body how unites, <lb/>
            And how, when severed, to primordial seeds <lb n="30"/>
            Again it lapses ;-haste we next t' unfold <lb/>
            Those forms minute, a theme connected close, <lb/>
            Termed by the learned IMAGES OF THINGS : <lb/>
            Forms that, like pellicles, when once thrown off <lb/>
            Clear from the Surface of whatever exists, <lb n="35"/>
            Float unrestrained through ether. Fearful these <lb/>
            Oft through the day, when obvious to the sense, <lb/>
            But chief at midnight, when in dreams we view <lb/>
            Dire shapes and apparitions, from the light <lb/>
            Shut out for ever, and each languid limb <lb n="40"/>
            With horror gaunt convulsing in its sleep. <lb/>
            For deem not thou the soul can e'er escape <lb/>
            From hell profound; that spectres of the dead <lb/>
            Can haunt the living; or that aught we feel <lb/>
            One hour survives when once the stroke of fate <lb n="45"/>
            Severs the mind from body, and remands <lb/>
            Each to th' appropriate atoms whence they sprang.</p>
          <p>Hence hold we firm that effigies of things, <lb/>
            Fine, filmy floscules from the surface fly, <lb/>
            Like peels, or membranes, of whatever exists; <lb n="50"/>
            The form precise, how wide soe'er diffused, <lb/>
            Maintaining still the parent body boasts. <lb/>
            This e'en the dull may learn; since sight itself <lb/>
            Marks the light film from many a substance urged, <lb/>
            Oft loosely floating, as the fume impure <lb n="55"/>
            From crackling faggots, or the brighter blaze <lb/>
            Of red, resplendent furnace; oft compact, <lb/>
            And firm of texture as the silken veil <lb/>
            Thrown from the grasshopper, when summer wanes, <lb/>
            By many a month worn out; or that the calf <lb n="60"/>
            Casts on his birth-day; or the spotted robe <lb/>
            Rent from the snake, that trembles on the brier, <lb/>
            The brier full oft with spoils like these bedeckt. <lb/>
            Since these exist, then, floscules rarer still <lb/>
            May, too, be exiled from the face of things: <lb n="65"/>
            For why the grosser, palpable to sight. <pb n="391"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Should rather thus exfoliate, than the flake <lb/>
            Of finer texture that all sight eludes, <lb/>
            The mind discerns not; for such viewless flakes <lb/>
            Live, doubtless, o'er each surface loose diffused, <lb n="70"/>
            Ranged ever equal, and with ampler ease <lb/>
            Dispelled, since gendered of a lighter frame, <lb/>
            And in the front of objects fixt supreme. <lb/>
            For sight not merely bodies marks minute <lb/>
            Thrown from th' interior, or the base profound, <lb n="75"/>
            As proved already, but, like rainbow hues, <lb/>
            Poured from the surface. This the crowd surveys <lb/>
            Oft in the theatre, whose curtains broad, <lb/>
            Bedecked with crimson, yellow, or the tint <lb/>
            Of steel cerulean, from their fluted heights <lb n="80"/>
            Wave tremulous; and, o'er the scene beneath, <lb/>
            Each marble statue, and the rising rows <lb/>
            Of rank and beauty, fling their tint superb. <lb/>
            While as the walls, with ampler shade repel <lb/>
            The garish noon-beam, every object round as <lb n="85"/>
            Laughs with a deeper dye, and wears profuse <lb/>
            A lovelier lustre, ravished from the day. <lb/>
            As then the trembling drapery ejects <lb/>
            Hues from its surface, superficial too <lb/>
            From every substance effigies minute<lb n="90"/>
            Must stream perpetual, each alike discharged. <lb/>
            And hence from all things vestiges there are <lb/>
            Of subtlest texture hovering through the void, <lb/>
            All sight evading when but simply poured.</p>
          <p>Each essence, vapour, fume, or aught alike <lb n="95"/>
            Attenuate, hence alone flows void of form, <lb/>
            That, gendered deep within, through tortuous paths <lb/>
            Loose, and disjoined, it struggles to the day ; <lb/>
            While the light quintessence of utmost hues <lb/>
            Streams unobstructed as supremely placed. <lb n="100"/>
            </p>
          <p>The main, moreover, the mirror, or aught else <lb/>
            Of polished front, each object full reflects <lb/>
            With perfect semblance. Whence this semblance fair <lb/>
            But from supernal images expelled ? <lb/>
            These, as more gross, we mark ; yet why the gross <lb n="105"/>
            Should rather thus exfoliate than the flake <lb/>
            Of subtler texture reason ne'er can prove. <pb n="392"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            Hence effigies there are from all things poured <lb/>
            Of nice resemblance, and the fairest web; <lb/>
            Which, though, when single, from the sight concealed, <lb n="110"/>
            When close reflected in perpetual stream <lb/>
            From the clear mirror, obvious meet the view. <lb/>
            Nor can the sophist other cause adduce <lb/>
            Whence springs the picture so correctly just.</p>
          <p>Come, now, and mark with what attenuate frame <lb n="115"/>
            Such pictures live. This the prime seeds of things <lb/>
            So fugitive to sense, so less than aught <lb/>
            The keenest sight can pierce, perchance may prove, <lb/>
            How subtle these, then, thus the muse explains.</p>
          <p>First, there are insects so minute, the view <lb n="120"/>
            Not half their puny members can discern. <lb/>
            What here are organs ? what intestines here ? <lb/>
            The globule what that forms their heart or eye ? <lb/>
            Their tiny limbs ? their tendons ? but o'er all <lb/>
            What the nice atoms whence the soul proceeds? <lb n="125"/>
            Each part so subtile, so minute the whole.</p>
          <p>Next, each wild herb that from its branches pours <lb/>
            Ungrateful odours, southernwood severe, <lb/>
            The rueful wormwood, centaury, or that <lb/>
            Famed for all cures, termed all-heal by the crowd, <lb n="130"/>
            These, by the lightest finger brushed, emit <lb/>
            Myriads of effigies in various modes <lb/>
            Void of all strength, wide hovering unperceived. <lb/>
            Such who can calculate ? what powers of mind <lb/>
            Scan their light textures, or their woof unfold? <lb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>Yet deem not thou such images alone <lb/>
            From things themselves emane; spontaneous, too, <lb/>
            Spring they in heaven above, combining strange, <lb/>
            Borne through th' aerial realms in modes diverse, <lb/>
            Their forms for ever shifting, till at length <lb n="140"/>
            Nought lives on earth the phantoms never ape. <lb/>
            Hence clouds concrete, th' aerial vault serene <lb/>
            Shadowing with moisture, grateful as it moves: <lb/>
            Hence, shapes gigantic spread, protruding broad <lb/>
            Their interposing features; mountains hence, <lb n="145"/>
            And mountain-rocks, torn from their base abrupt, <lb/>
            Seem oft to hover, blotting now the sun <lb/>
            With front opposed, now deep diffused behind, <pb n="393"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Gendering fresh clouds, a monster each to view.</p>
          <p>Mark, now, how swift such phantoms form-how swift <lb/>
            Exhale from all things, and, when formed, dissolve. <lb n="151"/>
            A steam there is that from the face of things <lb/>
            Pours forth perpetual. This, when urged amain <lb/>
            On porous textures, as the clothes we wear, <lb/>
            Pierces entire: when bold with wood, or stone <lb n="155"/>
            It dares conflict, the subtile membrane breaks, <lb/>
            Nor aught returns of semblance; but when flung <lb/>
            On dense and splendid objects (foremost such <lb/>
            Shines the pure mirror) nought of these ensues: <lb/>
            For then nor pierces the light lymph, nor quick <lb n="160"/>
            Breaks ere the mirror give the semblance sound. <lb/>
            Hence springs the vision, every object hence, <lb/>
            Opposed to splendours, pours perpetual forth <lb/>
            Its mimic likeness ; and, perpetual too, <lb/>
            Hence the pure effluence that the likeness yields <lb n="165"/>
            Must fleetly rush, reiterated urged. <lb/>
            As from the sun each moment many a ray <lb/>
            Must flow that things with lustre may be filled, <lb/>
            from each object many an image light <lb/>
            Streams without end ; for, turn howe'er thou please <lb n="170"/>
            The splendid plate, still the same semblance springs, <lb/>
            Punctual in form, appropriate in its dyes.</p>
          <p>Oft, too, the lucid front of heaven serene <lb/>
            Blackens abrupt; in subtlest vapours veiled <lb/>
            So blackens, fancy may conceive all hell <lb n="175"/>
            Had with his direst shades the welkin stormed, <lb/>
            Shivering with horror every human nerve. <lb/>
            But what such vapours to the films of things ? <lb/>
            These who can calculate ? what powers of mind <lb/>
            Scan their light textures, or their woof unfold ? <lb n="180"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus proved attenuate, mark, benignant, next, <lb/>
            Their keen rapidity: with what vast speed <lb/>
            Fleet they through ether, with elastic wing <lb/>
            Conquering dull time, urged various to their goals. <lb/>
            This shall the muse in melodies evince <lb n="185"/>
            More sweet than prolix; as the swan's lone dirge <lb/>
            Flows forth superior to the clamorous croak <lb/>
            Of countless cranes, by every wind disperst.</p>
          <p>Know, then, th' attenuate substance must move quick ; <pb n="394"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>But few th' exceptions. Hence the rapid race <lb n="190"/>
            Of light, and lustre from th' effusive sun, <lb/>
            Since these, too, spring from atoms most minute, <lb/>
            With ease protruded, by posterior force <lb/>
            Urged on ; for light for ever light succeeds, <lb/>
            And floods of splendour floods of splendour drive. <lb n="195"/>
            Hence, from like cause, the semblances of things <lb/>
            Through countless space must instantaneous rush ; <lb/>
            For equal powers propellant press behind, <lb/>
            And the same texture rears them that pervades <lb/>
            Forms most compact, and fills th' aerial void. <lb n="200"/>
            If, too, those particles of things that lurk <lb/>
            Deep in th' interior, oft sublimely bound, <lb/>
            And quit the surface, as the sun's pure light, <lb/>
            And lustre fair, if instant these we view <lb/>
            Rush through all space, o'er earth and main diffuse, <lb n="205"/>
            And heaven's high arch, by utmost lightness winged; <lb/>
            Say, what the speed of atoms placed supreme, <lb/>
            Poured from the front of things, by nought delayed ? <lb/>
            Seest thou not these, in the same point of time, <lb/>
            With swifter flight through ampler bounds must dart <lb n="210"/>
            Than the blue radiance that through ether streams ?</p>
          <p>To proofs thus cogent of the rapid race <lb/>
            Of insubstantial semblances, adjoin <lb/>
            This fact decisive; that, when once at night, <lb/>
            th the spangled concave, gleams the vase <lb n="215"/>
            Filled from the bubbling brook, the curious eye <lb/>
            Marks in the lymph, responsive, every star <lb/>
            That strews with silver all the radiant pole. <lb/>
            Seest thou not hence, then, in what point of time <lb/>
            Th' ethereal image darts from heaven to earth ? <lb n="220"/>
            Hence doubly flows it such stupendous forms <lb/>
            Must crowd th' horizon, and the sight compel, <lb/>
            Of things defined born ceaseless. From the sun <lb/>
            Thus heat exhales, cold, dewy damp from streams, <lb/>
            And the rough spray from ocean, with fierce fang <lb n="225"/>
            Gnawing the mound that dares resist its waves. <lb/>
            Thus sounds, too, hover in the breezy air; <lb/>
            And, when the beach we traverse, oft the tongue <lb/>
            Smarts with the briny vapour: or if chance, <lb/>
            By dexterous leech, fell wormwood near be bruised, <pb n="395"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>We taste th' essential bitter, and abhor. <lb n="230"/>
            Thus some light effluence streams from all create, <lb/>
            Streams forth for ever, void of dull repose, <lb/>
            Towards every point diffused: for man perceives, <lb/>
            Where'er his station, sight alike exists, <lb n="235"/>
            The sense of fluent odours, and of sounds.</p>
          <p>And as, moreover, th' essaying hand decides <lb/>
            Oft in the dark an object as precise <lb/>
            As the keen eye at mid-day,—hence we deem <lb/>
            Touch and the sight by equal causes swayed. <lb n="240"/>
            Thus, if a cube we handle, and, at night, <lb/>
            Its shape assure us, what but the mere shape <lb/>
            Proves the same substance is a cube by day ?— <lb/>
            Hence shapes, hence images alone create <lb/>
            All we survey, of vision the sole cause: <lb n="245"/>
            And hence from every object forms like these <lb/>
            Towards every point must radiate ; since the eye, <lb/>
            Source of all sight, where'er its orb inclines, <lb/>
            Sees all that moves, in shape and hue precise: <lb/>
            And since such semblances alone decide <lb n="250"/>
            How distant dwells each substance we discern. <lb/>
            These sole decide ; for every film exhaled <lb/>
            Drives on immediate the recumbent air <lb/>
            Placed 'twixt the visual orb and object viewed. <lb/>
            Then fleets its total column, o'er the ball <lb n="255"/>
            Rushing amain, till all its gradual length <lb/>
            Strikes on the sentient pupil, and retires. <lb/>
            Hence how far distant judge we things exist; <lb/>
            And as an ampler air, and larger tide <lb/>
            Of friction goad the vision, cautious, thus, <lb n="260"/>
            Deem more remote th' objective substance lies. <lb/>
            While such the speed evinced, at once we tell <lb/>
            The thing surveyed, its distance and its kind.</p>
          <p>Nor wondrous this, that, though, when singly urged, <lb/>
            Each separate image viewless strikes the sight, <lb n="265"/>
            The parent form springs obvious. When severe <lb/>
            Blows the fresh breeze, each particle of wind, <lb/>
            Of bitter cold the sense can ne'er discern, <lb/>
            But the full body rather: then the frame <lb/>
            Shrinks as though blows from some exterior foe <lb n="270"/>
            Were plied perpetual, every nerve availed. <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>When, too, the finger o'er the polished spar <lb/>
            Lets fall its weight, it touches then alone <lb/>
            The crystal hues, and surface; yet nor hues <lb/>
            Nor surface feels it, but the hardness sole <lb n="275"/>
            Its total body boasts, compact and firm.</p>
          <p>Now next unfold we whence the semblance seen <lb/>
            In the clear mirror, far beyond recedes, <lb/>
            Or so pretends, deceptive. Sleights like these <lb/>
            We trace for ever when th' attentive eye <lb n="280"/>
            Peeps in some hall, beyond th' unfolded doors, <lb/>
            And through their vista marks the scene without. <lb/>
            In both a twin, a double tide of air <lb/>
            Strikes on the vision. In the mansion thus <lb/>
            First floats th' interior ether, bounded close <lb n="285"/>
            By the broad portals opening right and left, <lb/>
            Then light external, and another air <lb/>
            Assail the pupil, and the real scene <lb/>
            At last developes. Thus the semblance too, <lb/>
            The mirror's self projects, as towards the sight <lb n="290"/>
            1 It yet, yet tends, the midway air protrudes <lb/>
            Placed 'twixt the visual orb and object viewed; <lb/>
            Whence first th' aerial tide assaults us ere <lb/>
            Conspicuous springs the mirror; which surveyed, <lb/>
            Next instant flows the semblance from ourselves <lb n="295"/>
            Ceaseless exhaled, and from the splendid plate <lb/>
            Reflected punctual, visiting in turn <lb/>
            The sentient eye-ball, and in turn its tide <lb/>
            Of air first forcing o'er the goaded view; <lb/>
            Thus doubly distant, and the glass beyond <lb n="300"/>
            Painting the mimic image we discern. <lb/>
            Hence not the meanest marvel can attach <lb/>
            To forms reflected from the fulgent plain <lb/>
            Through two-fold airs, by the twin tide resolved.</p>
          <p>The part, too, of the semblance that to us <lb n="305"/>
            The right creates, seems, in the mirror, left: <lb/>
            Hence Springs the vision, that when once the film <lb/>
            Strikes on the level radiance, it rebounds <lb/>
            Unaltered never, by th' elastic blow <lb/>
            In every trait reversed: as when we dash, <lb n="310"/>
            'Gainst some broad beam, the new-made mask of clay <lb/>
            Soft yet, and pliant, if with front direct <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            It bear the blow, the hollow frame inverts: <lb/>
            Each feature then transposes, the right eye <lb/>
            Claims the left side, the left the right usurps. <lb n="315"/>
            </p>
          <p>From mirror, too, to mirror may we spread <lb/>
            The playful image, till its like, with ease, <lb/>
            Be thrice, or ampler doubled ; and till nought <lb/>
            Lurk so retired, so deep behind, so hid <lb/>
            In tortuous angles, but that many a plate, <lb n="320"/>
            Rightly disposed, may yet through every maze <lb/>
            Drag forth the latent landscape, and at large <lb/>
            E'en in the mansion's central depths display. <lb/>
            So glides from glass to glass the semblance true <lb/>
            By each transposed in order, right and left <lb n="325"/>
            Changing alternate, and again restored.</p>
          <p>Mirrors there are, moreover, of shape rotund <lb/>
            With flexile sides like mortals, that present <lb/>
            To right or left each object free from change. <lb/>
            Thus solve the problem that the convex plate, <lb n="330"/>
            Like a twin mirror, twice the scene reflects <lb/>
            Ere yet it touch the vision; or, perchance, <lb/>
            Th* approaching image turns completely round, <lb/>
            A turn the flexile splendour proves precise.-</p>
          <p>Then the light image, too, with us affects <lb n="335"/>
            To move responsive, every gesture caught. <lb/>
            Hence the deception, that whatever the part <lb/>
            Of the pure plate relinquished, thence no more <lb/>
            Flies the fleet semblance ; fate's eternal laws <lb/>
            Deciding ceaseless that the film propelled <lb n="340"/>
            Must bear each variance of the parent form.</p>
          <p>Such are the sleights of mirrors. Mark we next, <lb/>
            How hates the eye-ball every gaudy glare ; <lb/>
            How darkens in the sun when poured direct; <lb/>
            Such his vast power. Yet here that power alike <lb n="345"/>
            Flows from a stream of effigies through heaven <lb/>
            Impetuous flung, the tender pupil oft <lb/>
            Wounding severely ; and, at times, so fierce <lb/>
            Rushes the radiant tide, the total orb <lb/>
            Burns with the fiery particles contained. <lb n="350"/>
            </p>
          <p>The jaundiced thus, not unaccordant, see <lb/>
            All clad in yellow, many a yellow seed <lb/>
            Forced from their frames, the semblances of things <pb n="398"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Accosting frequent; and the lurid eye, <lb/>
            Deep, too, imbued with its contagious hue, <lb n="355"/>
            Painting each image that its disc assails.</p>
          <p>Things in the light, though in the dark ourselves, <lb/>
            We mark conspicuous; for as the black air <lb/>
            Adjoining, first usurps th' expanded eye, <lb/>
            Quick flows th' illumined tide, from every shade <lb n="360"/>
            Purging the pupil, formed of finer seeds, <lb/>
            More potent far, more voluble in act. <lb/>
            Hence as at once the visual orb it clears, <lb/>
            Till then obstructed, and with lustre fills, <lb/>
            Each floating image, in the light exhaled, <lb n="365"/>
            Next rushes, and its stimulus applies. <lb/>
            But when, reversed, from day to dark we look, <lb/>
            We see not, for the stream of shadowy air <lb/>
            That last arrives, of grosser texture wrought, <lb/>
            Fills every avenue, each optic nerve <lb n="370"/>
            Clogs, and the semblances of things arrests.</p>
          <p>View yon square turrets, too, that guard our state <lb/>
            From hills remote, and each appears rotund. <lb/>
            Hence solve the vision; that, at distance seen, <lb/>
            All angles soften; first surveyed obtuse, <lb n="375"/>
            Then fading total; the dilated orb <lb/>
            Attaining never, or devoid of force: <lb/>
            For the light image, through the fluttering air <lb/>
            As swift it glides, abrades at every point. <lb/>
            Hence, as each angle flies the prying sight, <lb n="380"/>
            Cylindric seems the structure, distant far <lb/>
            From the true circle, but cylindric still.</p>
          <p>The shade, moreo'er, moves with us in the sun, <lb/>
            Attends our steps, and every gesture apes; <lb/>
            Moves, or so seems, if terms like these apply <lb n="385"/>
            To aught like shadow, the mere void alone <lb/>
            Of light, and lustre. Such the phase evinced, <lb/>
            Thou thus resolve it; that, whene'er we walk <lb/>
            Beneath the solar blaze aslant propelled, <lb/>
            Our interposing limbs perforce must hide <lb n="390"/>
            The heavenly ray from spots illumined else, <lb/>
            And still illumed the moment we forsake: <lb/>
            Hence must the shadow with the moving frame <lb/>
            Seem, too, to move most punctual; for the streams <pb n="399"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Of new-born radiance that for ever flow <lb n="395"/>
            Die instant, as the filaments of wool <lb/>
            In fiercest flames, by streams succeeded still: <lb/>
            Whence quick of light may every spot be robbed, <lb/>
            And quick relumed, the negro shade expelled.</p>
          <p>Yet deem not thou from this, or aught besides, <lb n="400"/>
            The vision e'er can err: its office sole <lb/>
            Tells where is shine or shadow, while the rest, <lb/>
            Whether the shining current live the same, <lb/>
            Or change perpetual; whether the dark shade <lb/>
            Wait on each step progressive, or the dogm <lb n="405"/>
            Just urged be truth,-all this the mind alone <lb/>
            Weighs, and determines; for th' exterior sight <lb/>
            Scans not the powers of things; so blame not thou <lb/>
            Th' unerring vision for the mind's defects.</p>
          <p>Th' advancing bark seems to the crew at rest; <lb n="410"/>
            At rest, advancing; and the hills and vales, <lb/>
            Near which we voyage, seem compelled astern.</p>
          <p>Thus seem the stars, though reason proves their flight, <lb/>
            Fixt to th' ethereal vault, o'er whose broad bounds <lb/>
            Their lucid course they steer, and rise and set <lb n="415"/>
            Alternate ; thus the sun and moon alike <lb/>
            Move not to sight, though moving without end.</p>
          <p>The mountain rocks, whose severed sides admit <lb/>
            Whole fleets between, look in the distant deep <lb/>
            But one continuous chain, one solid isle. <lb n="420"/>
            </p>
          <p>So to the wanton boy, whom many a twirl <lb/>
            Makes dizzy, pillars, pictures, walls alike <lb/>
            Roll rapid round, and menace with their fall.</p>
          <p>When first the rosy dawn, with trembling fires, <lb/>
            Peeps o'er the mountains, mountains where the sun <lb n="425"/>
            Rests all his rising radiance,-the bright pomp <lb/>
            Seems scarce two thousand bow-shots from ourselves; <lb/>
            Oft might five hundred reach it: yet between <lb/>
            These rich-wrought mountains and the solar disc <lb/>
            Spreads many an ocean, many a heaven unknown, <lb n="430"/>
            Of span immense, and many a mighty realm <lb/>
            Peopled with nations, and the brutal tribes. <lb/>
            So in the puny pools inch-high that fill, <lb/>
            When showers descend, the hollows in our streets, <lb/>
            A prospect opens, earth as deep below <pb n="400"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV <lb/>
            </note>As bends o'er earth th' ethereal vault sublime: <lb n="435"/>
            Where may'st thou trace the flitting clouds, the heavens, <lb/>
            And heavenly orbs in wondrous guise displayed.</p>
          <p>Thus, too, when mounted on the mettled steed, <lb/>
            Full in the stream then plunge,-if midway o'er <lb n="440"/>
            Thou rest-the stationary steed seems still <lb/>
            With the broad torrent struggling, up the tide <lb/>
            Urging his dauntless chest, while all around <lb/>
            With equal motion looks alike overpowered.</p>
          <p>The pillared portico, whose aisle throughout <lb n="445"/>
            In breadth ne'er varies, propt through all its course <lb/>
            With equal columns, from its entrance viewed <lb/>
            Seems lessening gradual, side approaching side, <lb/>
            And ceiling floor, till at its utmost bound <lb/>
            All, like the cone, ends in a point acute. <lb n="450"/>
            </p>
          <p>To those at sea the restless sun ascends, <lb/>
            And sets in ocean, quenching there his fires; <lb/>
            For nought but skies and ocean meet their view: <lb/>
            So blame not thou that thus the sight reports.</p>
          <p>E'en while in port the bark, to those unskilled, <lb n="455"/>
            Oft seems distrest, and with disabled arms <lb/>
            Against the tide contending: for though straight <lb/>
            Looks the tough length of oar the brine above, <lb/>
            And straight the helm superior, all below <lb/>
            Seems broke abrupt, refracted by the wave, <lb n="460"/>
            Inversed, and boating near the rory brim.-</p>
          <p>When through the welkin the wild winds at night <lb/>
            Drive the light clouds, the starry gems of heaven <lb/>
            Seem forced athwart them, in perplext career <lb/>
            Urged rapid on, wide wandering from their paths. <lb n="465"/>
            </p>
          <p>If but one eye-ball lightly thou compress <lb/>
            Below, with casual finger, all around <lb/>
            Looks instant double; every taper flames <lb/>
            With double lights, with double garniture <lb/>
            The mansion labours, and each friend assumes, <lb n="470"/>
            Preposterous sight! two faces, and two forms.</p>
          <p>So, too, when sleep his opiate wand has stretched <lb/>
            And lulled each limb in soft and sound repose, <lb/>
            Still watchful seem we, every member still <lb/>
            Feels in full motion: wrapt in midnight gloom <lb n="475"/>
            The cheerful day still smiles: though close pent up, <pb n="401"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>O'er main, and mountains, hills and heavens we roam, <lb/>
            Tread with firm foot the champaign ; grave debates <lb/>
            Hear mid the noiseless solitude that reigns, <lb/>
            And e'en while silent loudly make reply. <lb n="480"/>
            </p>
          <p>These, and a thousand visions, strange alike, <lb/>
            Assault our senses, and would fain deceive. <lb/>
            But vain th' attempt: since, though full oft we err, <lb/>
            'Tis mind misguides us with results unsound, <lb/>
            That deeming seen which ne'er the sight surveys.. <lb n="485"/>
            For nought more arduous than to sever forms <lb/>
            True, from ideal by the mind begot.</p>
          <p>Who holds that nought is known, denies he knows <lb/>
            E'en this, thus owning that he nothing knows. <lb/>
            With such I ne'er could reason, who, with face <lb n="490"/>
            Retorted, treads the ground just trod before. <lb/>
            Yet grant e'en this he knows; since nought exists <lb/>
            Of truth in things, whence learns he what to know, <lb/>
            Or what not know ? what things can give him first <lb/>
            The notion crude of what is false, or true ? <lb n="495"/>
            What prove aught doubtful, or of doubt devoid ?</p>
          <p>Search, and this earliest notion thou wilt find <lb/>
            Of truth and falsehood from the senses drawn, <lb/>
            Nor aught can e'er refute them: for what once, <lb/>
            By truths opposed, their falsehood can detect, <lb n="500"/>
            Must claim a trust far ampler than themselves. <lb/>
            Yet what than these an ampler trust can claim ? <lb/>
            Can reason, born forsooth of erring sense, <lb/>
            Impeach those senses whence along it springs ? <lb/>
            And which, if false, itself can ne'er be true. <lb n="505"/>
            Can sight correct the ears ? can ears the touch ? <lb/>
            Or touch the tongue's fine flavour ? or, o'er all, <lb/>
            Can smell triumphant rise ? absurd the thought. <lb/>
            For every sense a separate function boasts, <lb/>
            A power prescribed; and hence or soft or hard, <lb n="510"/>
            Or hot or cold, to its appropriate sense <lb/>
            Alone appeals. The gaudy train of hues, <lb/>
            With their light shades, appropriate thus alike <lb/>
            Perceive we; tastes appropriate powers possess; <lb/>
            Appropriate, sounds and odours: and hence, too, <lb n="515"/>
            One sense another ne'er can contravene, <lb/>
            Nor e'en correct itself; since, every hour, <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <pb n="402"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>In every act each claims an equal faith: <lb/>
            So what the senses notice must be true.- <lb/>
            E'en though the mind no real cause could urge <lb n="520"/>
            Why what is square when present, when remote <lb/>
            Cylindric seems, 'twere dangerous less t' adopt <lb/>
            A cause unsound, than rashly yield at once <lb/>
            All that we grasp of truth and surety most, <lb/>
            Rend all reliance, and root up, forlorn, <lb n="525"/>
            The first, firm principles of life and health. <lb/>
            For not alone fails reason, life itself <lb/>
            Ends instant, if the senses thou disturb; <lb/>
            And dare some dangerous precipice, or aught <lb/>
            Against warned equal, spurning what is safe. <lb n="530"/>
            Hence all against the senses urged is vain, <lb/>
            Mere idle rant, and hollow pomp of words.</p>
          <p>As, in a building, if the first lines err, <lb/>
            If aught impede the plummet, or the rule <lb/>
            From its just angles deviate but a hair, <lb n="535"/>
            The total edifice must rise untrue, <lb/>
            Recumbent, curved, o’erhanging, void of grace, <lb/>
            Tumbling, or tumbled from this first defect, <lb/>
            So must all reason prove unsound, deduced <lb/>
            From things created, if the senses err. <lb n="540"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus perfect SIGHT, unfold we next, a task <lb/>
            Not arduous, how each other sense perceives.</p>
          <p>SOUND, and the VOICE, then, first are felt when deep <lb/>
            Pierce their light corpuscles the mazy ear, <lb/>
            And rouse impulsive; for corporeal, too, <lb n="545"/>
            Are sound and voice, since each the sense impels. <lb/>
            Thus voice full oft abrades the palate; sound, <lb/>
            Forth issuing from the lungs, th' aerial tube <lb/>
            Roughens: for when the vocal atoms press <lb/>
            With throng unusual through the bronchial straits, <lb n="550"/>
            Th' elastic stream their tender tunics goads, <lb/>
            And the whole passage smarts with pain severe. <lb/>
            Hence, doubtless, voice and words sonorous spring <lb/>
            From seeds corporeal, armed with power to wound.</p>
          <p>Nor here forget how much the speaker wastes, <lb n="555"/>
            How faints enervate, shorn of vital force, <lb/>
            Who from the dawn harangues till night's black shade; <lb/>
            How doubly wastes if loud th' oration urged. <pb n="403"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Corporeal, hence, the voice must prove, since he <lb/>
            Who long debates, corporeal loss sustains. <lb n="560"/>
            Roughness, moreover, of voice, from atoms rough, <lb/>
            From smooth its suavity perpetual flows: <lb/>
            Nor of like figure wind they through the ear <lb/>
            When roars the deep-toned trumpet, or the horn <lb/>
            With hoarse, harsh gamut strains its serpent throat; <lb n="565"/>
            And when the swan, amid the pangs of death, <lb/>
            Pours o'er PARNASSUS his last, liquid dirge.</p>
          <p>The vocal tide thus reared, when from the lungs <lb/>
            Sublime we press it through the bronchial duct, <lb/>
            The tongue dædalian, and vivacious lips <lb n="570"/>
            Mould it to words, articulated nice. <lb/>
            And when not far th' irruptive voice is thrown <lb/>
            It strikes emphatic, and is heard distinct, <lb/>
            Unchanged, uninjured every primal seed.</p>
          <p>But when at distance urged, the severing air <lb n="575"/>
            Must break each sentence, and the wandering voice <lb/>
            Through the long medium all connexion lose. <lb/>
            And thus, though sounds attract us, we collect <lb/>
            Nought they should teach, so blended and destroyed.</p>
          <p>When, mid the gaping throng, the crier loud <lb n="580"/>
            Bawls out his mandate, each its purport hears. <lb/>
            Hence, too, the voice to vocicles minute <lb/>
            Severs abrupt, since every ear alike <lb/>
            Drinks in each tone with equal clearness felt; <lb/>
            While what its nerve ne'er reaches, wide diffused, <lb n="585"/>
            Wastes through all ether; or, if aught, perchance. <lb/>
            Strike some compact enclosure, it rebounds <lb/>
            In faithless speech, mere semblances of words.</p>
          <p>Whence may'st thou solve, ingenuous ! to the world <lb/>
            The rise of echoes, formed in desert scenes, <lb n="590"/>
            Mid rocks, and mountains, mocking every sound, <lb/>
            When late we wander through their solemn glooms, <lb/>
            And, with loud voice, some lost companion call. <lb/>
            And oft re-echoes echo till the peal <lb/>
            Ring seven times round: so rock to rock repels <lb n="595"/>
            The mimic shout, re-iterated close.</p>
          <p>Here haunt the goat-foot satyrs, and the nymphs, <lb/>
            As rustics tell, and fauns whose frolic dance <lb/>
            And midnight revels oft, they say, are heard <note type="footnote">2 D 2 </note> <pb n="404"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Bicaking the noiseless silence; while soft strains <lb n="600"/>
            Melodious issue, and the vocal band <lb/>
            Strike to their madrigals the plaintive lyre. <lb/>
            Such, feign they, sees the shepherd, obvious oft, <lb/>
            Led on by PAN, with pine-leaf garland crowned, <lb/>
            And seven-mouthed reed his labouring lip beneath, <lb n="605"/>
            Waking the woodland MUSE with ceaseless song. <lb/>
            These, and a thousand legends wilder still <lb/>
            Recount they; haply lest their desert homes <lb/>
            Seem of the gods abandoned, boastful hence <lb/>
            Of sights prodigious; or by cause, perchance, <lb n="610"/>
            More trivial urged, for ne'er was tale so wild <lb/>
            Feigned, but the crowd would drink with greedy ears.</p>
          <p>Nor strange, moreover, conceive it that the voice <lb/>
            Full many a scene should pierce, the nerve of sound <lb/>
            Rousing, where sight's keen gaze can never reach. <lb n="615"/>
            For voice unhurt through flexile tubes can wind; <lb/>
            But the light image never; since the pore <lb/>
            When not direct, as that of lucid glass <lb/>
            Which all transmits, abrades it and destroys.-</p>
          <p>Voice through the total scene, too, spreads alike; <lb n="620"/>
            Since, when once formed, to vocicles minute <lb/>
            It breaks innumerous, as sparks at night <lb/>
            To countless sparklings; hence the scene throughout <lb/>
            O'erflows with sound, through every winding felt. <lb/>
            Yet visual images, when once propelled, <lb n="625"/>
            Rush but in lines direct; whence none can see <lb/>
            Things pent above, though voice th' enclosure pierce. <lb/>
            Yet voice itself, thus piercing, faints obtuse, <lb/>
            Heard indistinct, and rather sound than sense.</p>
          <p>To TASTES proceed we: whence the tongue's nice powers <lb/>
            Spring, and the curious palate, full t' unfold.- <lb n="631"/>
            </p>
          <p>First tastes the tongue, then, when the sturdy teeth <lb/>
            Wring from the food its juices ; as though sponge, <lb/>
            Pregnant with water, by th' embracing hand <lb/>
            Were squeezed to dryness. O'er the pores perplext <lb n="635"/>
            Of tongue and palate next th' excreted lymph <lb/>
            Rushes amain; and, when from atoms reared <lb/>
            Smooth and rotund, the masticating sense <lb/>
            Through its moist temple swells with dear delight: <lb/>
            But when the rough assail it, it recoils <pb n="405"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>And shrinks abhorrent, wounded in the strife. <lb n="640"/>
            Last, flows the trickling pleasure, or the pain, <lb/>
            Back towards the tonsils where the gorge first opes ; <lb/>
            There flows and ceases, nothing felt beyond <lb/>
            Of joy or suffering through the frame diffused. <lb n="645"/>
            For nought imports it what the food employed, <lb/>
            If but the stomach into genial tides <lb/>
            Concoct it sole, and pour through every limb.</p>
          <p>Oft find we, too, that various frames demand <lb/>
            As various viands; and that what to some <lb n="650"/>
            Seems harsh and hateful, some perpetual deem <lb/>
            Delicious most; while e'en so vast, at times, <lb/>
            The strange discordance, that what poisons this <lb/>
            To that proves healthful, and prolongates life. <lb/>
            Thus dies the snake that human spittle tastes, <lb n="655"/>
            Worked into madness, self-destroyed ; and thus <lb/>
            Wild hellebore, that goats and quails matures, <lb/>
            By man once swallowed stamps his instant fate.</p>
          <p>These facts to solve, thy mind must first retrace <lb/>
            A doctrine earlier urged, that all things hold <lb n="660"/>
            Deep in their texture seeds unlike of form, <lb/>
            And that each sentient class by food sustained, <lb/>
            Since large the variance of its outer make, <lb/>
            And stamp generic, must from nutrient seeds <lb/>
            Of form unlike be reared, and powers diverse. <lb n="665"/>
            But if its seeds thus differ, different too <lb/>
            Must prove in shape the fine absorbent pores <lb/>
            Whence draws the frame its nurture, o'er the tongue <lb/>
            Spread bibulous, the palate, and the limbs; <lb/>
            Now large, now small, triangular, rotund, <lb n="670"/>
            Squares, polygons, in every changeful mode. <lb/>
            For to the varying seed the varying duct <lb/>
            With nicest adaptation must respond. <lb/>
            And, hence, when foods of bitter taste to some <lb/>
            Prove sweet to others, where the flavour charms, <lb n="675"/>
            The smoothest seeds alone the palate drinks, <lb/>
            Through all its pores inebriate; while, reversed, <lb/>
            Where aught offends, those jagged more and rough <lb/>
            Pierce the nice tubes, and tear their tender mouths.</p>
          <p>Thus all alike springs obvious. When the frame, <lb n="680"/>
            From bile o'erflowing, or some cause as fierce, <pb n="406"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV, <lb/>
            </note>Sickens with fever, every organ shakes <lb/>
            With tumult dire, through all its texture changed. <lb/>
            Hence atoms erst apportioned, now no more <lb/>
            Apportioned prove; while those far readier fit <lb n="685"/>
            That rouse the sense to hatred and disgust: <lb/>
            For both in all things lurk, as urged above, <lb/>
            E'en in the sweets Hyblæan honey boasts.</p>
          <p>But come, for ODOURS call us, and the powers <lb/>
            That sway th' obsequious nostrils. Odours fine, <lb n="690"/>
            Wave after wave, flow forth in ceaseless tide <lb/>
            From many a substance, many a living tribe <lb/>
            Attracting different, as diversely reared. <lb/>
            Hence bees, through distant ether, wind the scent <lb/>
            Of honeyed flowrets! vultures, foul of maw, <lb n="695"/>
            Track the vile carcass ; the vivacious hound <lb/>
            Hunts o'er the hills the cloven-footed foe ; <lb/>
            And the white goose, preserver of our state, <lb/>
            The haunts explores of mortals. Odours hence <lb/>
            From odours differing, every brutal tribe <lb n="700"/>
            Its food selects, from baneful poison flies, <lb/>
            And through all time maintains its rank entire.</p>
          <p>Thus varying scents the varying nostrils wound, <lb/>
            To different distance urged; yet none so far <lb/>
            As voice or sounds, not here those films to name <lb n="705"/>
            That strike the pupil, and solicit sight. <lb/>
            For scents roam tardy, in uncertain path, <lb/>
            And die with ease beneath the breath of heaven, <lb/>
            Since from the depth of things with labour flung. <lb/>
            For that thus deep they rise thou thus may'st prove: <lb n="710"/>
            That all when frittered, into dust reduced, <lb/>
            Or probed by fire, an ampler essence yield. <lb/>
            Then spring they, too, from particles more gross, <lb/>
            Since void of power the firm flint wall to pierce, <lb/>
            Pierced oft by sounds, by voices. Doubtful hence <lb n="715"/>
            Feel we full frequent, though in scents immersed, <lb/>
            From what point flows the perfume; for the stream <lb/>
            Chills as it loiters, and with languid force <lb/>
            jxcites the dubious nostrils; and hence, too, <lb/>
            Oft the fleet pack wide wanders mid the chase. <lb n="720"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor tastes alone, nor odours different strike <lb/>
            The different tribes percipient; the light hues, <pb n="407"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>The semblances of things, diversely, too, <lb/>
            Pungent, or bland, the conscious sight assault. <lb/>
            The lion, thus, the cock's indignant eye <lb n="725"/>
            Flies, nor can e'er encounter, loud of wing, <lb/>
            Who drives the shadows, and the lazy dawn <lb/>
            Wakes with shrill clarion iterated oft. <lb/>
            For seeds there are that in the warlike cock <lb/>
            Of power peculiar lurk, which when once urged <lb n="730"/>
            Against the lion's sight, with wound severe <lb/>
            Tear the keen pupil; whence the tortured beast <lb/>
            Dares not the shock; while yet the human eye <lb/>
            Escapes uninjured, since the puny darts <lb/>
            Pierce not, or, piercing, through the yielding pores <lb n="735"/>
            Find a free entrance, and as free retire.</p>
          <p>Now mark while briefly, next, the muse displays <lb/>
            What forms the mind excite, and through the soul <lb/>
            Rush viewless. First be this imprinted deep, <lb/>
            That light, innumerous semblances of things, <lb n="740"/>
            Towards every point, in modes innumerous press, <lb/>
            Combining soon through ether when they meet, <lb/>
            As the wove woof of spiders, or the threads <lb/>
            Fine-wrought of filmy gold. For slenderer far <lb/>
            Of these the texture than aught e'er that strikes <lb n="745"/>
            Conspicuous on the pupil, since with ease <lb/>
            Pierce they the porous body, reach, recluse, <lb/>
            Th' attenuate mind, and stimulate the sense. <lb/>
            Hence Centaurs see we, Scyllas, and the face <lb/>
            Of dogs Cerberean, or the spectres pale <lb n="750"/>
            Of those whose bones the tomb has long embraced. <lb/>
            For countless effigies of countless kinds <lb/>
            Float vagrant round us, self-engendered, now <lb/>
            In air sublime, now flung from all that lives, <lb/>
            And now combined in many a monster form: <lb n="755"/>
            For the wild semblance of a Centaur yet <lb/>
            Ne'er flowed from Centaurs living, nature such <lb/>
            Creating never; but when once in air <lb/>
            A man's light image with a horse's meets, <lb/>
            Quick they cohere, as just maintained, since reared <lb n="760"/>
            Of subtlest texture, and the phantom springs. <lb/>
            Thus spring, too, kindred phantoms, by their make <lb/>
            All volatile, and, with percussion joint, <pb n="408"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Rousing the mind, soon roused, since reared itself <lb/>
            Of subtlest texture, and vivacious most. <lb n="765"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus all with ease developes. As the mind <lb/>
            Sees but the features sight surveyed before, <lb/>
            Each into act some equal cause must prompt.- <lb/>
            Since the fierce lion, as the muse has taught, <lb/>
            Sight, then, surveys from semblances alone, <lb n="770"/>
            Nought but mere semblances the mind can rouse; <lb/>
            Hence seen the same, or but attenuate more. <lb/>
            Thus only, when the limbs dissolve in sleep, <lb/>
            The wakeful spirit of the mind descries <lb/>
            Trains of unreal objects, moved throughout <lb n="775"/>
            By the same images the day displays ; <lb/>
            So moved that those oft obvious seem to spring <lb/>
            Whom long the grave has folded in its grasp: <lb/>
            A creed e'en urged by nature, since, profound, <lb/>
            Through the still frame then slumbers every sense, <lb n="780"/>
            Void of all power to mark the true from false; <lb/>
            Nor rouses the dull memory to clear <lb/>
            The fancied scene, or prove the forms we see <lb/>
            Erewhile fell victims to oblivious fate.-</p>
          <p>Nor wondrous deem it that such forms should move, <lb n="785"/>
            Or wave their hands, as dreams full oft disclose, <lb/>
            Or trip their frolic feet to numerous time. <lb/>
            For the light image stays not, but flows on <lb/>
            In streams successive; hence when this to that <lb/>
            Yields of diverse arrangement, from the change, <lb n="790"/>
            Rapid as thought, the first seems moving sole. <lb/>
            So vast their powers of action ; such the stores <lb/>
            Of things create, the countless phantoms such <lb/>
            Flung through each moment's least capacious point.</p>
          <p>Yet many a question themes like these excite, <lb n="795"/>
            Deep thought demanding ere illumined clear.</p>
          <p>Whence springs it that the mind, with instant haste, <lb/>
            Thinks on whatever the wayward will resolves ? <lb/>
            If heaven the heart, if earth, or main, possess, <lb/>
            Pomps, spectacles, or senates, feasts, or fights, <lb n="800"/>
            Does NATURE then her images create <lb/>
            Prompt to the moment ? whence that mortals placed <lb/>
            In the same country, in the self-same spot, <lb/>
            On different themes employ the thoughtful mind? <pb n="409"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK IV <lb/>
            </note>Whence, too, those graceful attitudes, in turn, The changeful phantoms oft in dreams disclose ? <lb n="805"/>
            The flexile arm that, through the measured dance, <lb/>
            To arm voluptuous answers ? and the foot <lb/>
            To foot symphonious, exquisitely true ? <lb/>
            Taste, then, the phantoms science? are they taught <lb n="810"/>
            Thus loose to wanton mid the night's dead hours ? <lb/>
            Or flows it not much rather that each space <lb/>
            Of time minutest, e'en while the fleet lip <lb/>
            Sounds but a syllable, of parts consists <lb/>
            Minuter still, within whose rapid reign <lb n="815"/>
            Rush they in swarms, towards every point propelled ? <lb/>
            So vast their powers of action ; such the stores <lb/>
            Of things create. And hence when this to that <lb/>
            Yields of diverse arrangement, from the change <lb/>
            The first alone seems moving to the sight. <lb n="820"/>
            Then, too, so fine their texture, that the mind, <lb/>
            Save when profound it pries, their separate forms <lb/>
            Can ne'er distinguish; hence, unnoticed, waste <lb/>
            Those the dull mind prepares not to survey. <lb/>
            For thus prepares it ceaseless, and expects <lb n="825"/>
            The coming vision, hence surveyed alone. <lb/>
            E'en seest thou not the pupil, when it first <lb/>
            Kens some fine object, all its orb contracts, <lb/>
            And strains ere yet the figure full disclose ? <lb/>
            Thus, too, in scenes more obvious, if thy soul <lb n="830"/>
            Thou bend not to the vision, it remains <lb/>
            As though from thee far distant and disjoined. <lb/>
            What wonder each light image, then, should die <lb/>
            Viewless, the mind ne'er rouses to survey. <lb/>
            Then things minute, too, large full oft we deem <lb n="835"/>
            Wide wandering from the fact, and self-deceived.</p>
          <p>And oft a form the present phantom wears <lb/>
            Unlike th' anterior, woman now, and now <lb/>
            The bolder sex, or shaped with different age, <lb/>
            And features fresh, while still oblivion deep, <lb n="840"/>
            And languid rest restrain us from surprise.</p>
          <p>Yet fly abhorrent, here, with vigour fly <lb/>
            Their creed who hold that every organ sprang <lb/>
            To use self-destined: that the pupil rose <lb/>
            Conscious of vision; that the legs, the thighs <pb n="410"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>On the firm foot upreared their columns, versed <lb n="845"/>
            Previous in paces ; that the flexile arm <lb/>
            Hence nerved with strength its muscles; and the hands <lb/>
            Hung on each side, the messengers of life. <lb/>
            This, and whatever such sophists else affirm, <lb n="850"/>
            Is futile all, preposterous, and wild. <lb/>
            For nought so knows its office as to act <lb/>
            When first produced, but all produced alone <lb/>
            Learns it progressive. The nice power to see <lb/>
            Lived not before the eye-ball; to debate <lb n="855"/>
            With graceful speech before the tongue was formed, <lb/>
            The tongue long first created ; nor to hear <lb/>
            Ere rose the sense of sound; nor aught besides <lb/>
            Of organ could anticipate its use. <lb/>
            Hence urged by use, no organ ever sprang. <lb n="860"/>
            </p>
          <p>Wars, we admit, with all their ills, began, <lb/>
            And savage blows were dealt, and tides of blood <lb/>
            Flowed forth obscene, ere yet the lucid spear <lb/>
            Was hurled indignant; and to fly its force <lb/>
            Preceded long the left hand's sturdy shield. <lb n="865"/>
            Thus, too, repose the weary members claimed, <lb/>
            Long ere the down displayed its soft expanse; <lb/>
            And the parched lip was slaked ere goblets rose.</p>
          <p>Doubtless such instruments from use foreseen <lb/>
            Were gradual framed, as life and nature called, <lb n="870"/>
            But nought besides; for all created else <lb/>
            First sprang, and then their proper use explored, <lb/>
            The senses chief, and active limbs of man.— <lb/>
            Hence far the creed reject, then, that affirms <lb/>
            These e'er produced from office pre-conceived. <lb n="875"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor is it wondrous that each form that breathes <lb/>
            Should, from its nature, need diurnal food : <lb/>
            Since, as we erst have taught, in many a mode <lb/>
            Full many an atom flies from all create; <lb/>
            From ranks percipient most, by toil fatigued. <lb n="880"/>
            For ceaseless vapour here the skin bedews, <lb/>
            Flung forth profound, and quick the labouring lungs <lb/>
            Part with their vital spirit; hence the frame <lb/>
            Sinks all exhausted ; faintness preys profuse <lb/>
            O'er every power, and ruin stares around. <lb n="885"/>
            So foods are claimed the languid limbs to brace, <pb n="411"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>To fill with strength recruited, and appease <lb/>
            The craving hunger that subdues the soul. <lb/>
            So, too, the goblet spreads its liquid stores <lb/>
            Where'er those stores are sought, with grateful draught <lb/>
            Quenching the fiery stomach, and absorbed <lb n="891"/>
            Through all the members, freshening as it flows. <lb/>
            Hence dies the raging hunger ; and the thirst, <lb/>
            Panting no more, is drowned in fluent bliss.</p>
          <p>Now next unfold we, thou the doctrine mark, <lb n="895"/>
            How the firm foot advances at our will ? <lb/>
            Whence draw the lips their motion ? and within <lb/>
            What this strange power the body's bulk that drives ?—</p>
          <p>First, then, we hold-a precept urged before- <lb/>
            That the light images that rove around <lb n="900"/>
            Beset, and strike the mind ; hence springs the will <lb/>
            Determined instant; for no mortal aught <lb/>
            Can e'er commence but what th' interior mind <lb/>
            Wills, and decides; and what the mind thus wills <lb/>
            Th' assailing image governs by its form. <lb n="905"/>
            So when the mind, thus roused, resolves to walk, <lb/>
            Quick through the total soul, the soul diffused <lb/>
            O'er all the system, the commotion felt <lb/>
            It spreads percussive, spreads with instant ease, <lb/>
            Since close the bond between them; and, in turn. <lb n="910"/>
            Urged by the soul, the body final moves, <lb/>
            Feels the propulsion, and its power obeys.</p>
          <p>Then, too, the frame expands, and the light air <lb/>
            All volatile, through every path, and pore, <lb/>
            Each aperture minutest, ampler flows ; <lb n="915"/>
            And hence from two-fold force, as sails the bark <lb/>
            With wind and canvass, man majestic moves.</p>
          <p>Nor strange conceive it that such trivial powers <lb/>
            Should turn the body, and its bulk direct. <lb/>
            For the pure gale, of subtlest atoms reared, <lb n="920"/>
            With force immense the mightiest ship propels; <lb/>
            While one light hand, one slender helm, with ease <lb/>
            Guides its vast burden o'er the bending main. <lb/>
            And, armed with wheels, and pulleys, the firm crane <lb/>
            Lifts loads at will, the groaning ground that crush. <lb n="925"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now by what means soft SLEEP bedews the limbs, <lb/>
            And from the mind drives every carking care, <pb n="412"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>This next the muse in melodies shall sing <lb/>
            More sweet than prolix; as the swan's lone dirge <lb/>
            Flows forth superior to the clamorous croak <lb n="930"/>
            Of countless cranes, by every wind disperst. <lb/>
            Hear thou attentive, and with mind acute, <lb/>
            Lest aught appear incongruous, and thy breast <lb/>
            Recoil abhorrent from the truths we teach, <lb/>
            Foe to the creed from ignorance alone. <lb n="935"/>
            </p>
          <p>Sleep, then, occurs when fades through every limb <lb/>
            The soul's sensorial power, part by fatigue <lb/>
            Wasted through ether, and concentred part <lb/>
            Deep in each vital organ ; till, at length, <lb/>
            Lax grow the members, listless, and dissolved. <lb n="940"/>
            For power sensorial doubtless from the soul <lb/>
            Derives; and hence, when sleep the senses locks, <lb/>
            Th' enfeebled soul itself to reason seems <lb/>
            Worn out, and all ejected into air. <lb/>
            Yet not entire: for then this mortal make <lb n="945"/>
            Must sink subdued in death's eternal ice, <lb/>
            No latent atom left, as sparks that lurk <lb/>
            In smothered embers, whence its powers afresh <lb/>
            Might blaze, triumphant, with recovered flame.</p>
          <p>Yet by what means this wondrous change results, <lb n="950"/>
            Whence fails the soul, and all the body droops, <lb/>
            Now mark, nor let the dictates waste in air.</p>
          <p>Know then all ether, that around us flows, <lb/>
            Beats on the body, open to its force, <lb/>
            With ceaseless repercussion. Nature hence, <lb n="955"/>
            To check its fury, oft the tender frame <lb/>
            With skin surrounds, hair, bark, or painted shells. <lb/>
            Nor ceases here th' assault; the breeze inhaled <lb/>
            Winds, too, through all the system, and each duct <lb/>
            Lashes amain with every fleeting breath. <lb n="960"/>
            Since with a two-fold foe, then, Nature, thus, <lb/>
            Through all her depths, through all her pores minute, <lb/>
            Strives ceaseless, ruin by degrees must threat: <lb/>
            For each primordial seed is deep deranged <lb/>
            Of mind and body: while th' enfeebled soul, <lb n="965"/>
            By transudation shorn, concentrates part <lb/>
            In the deep vitals, and in part still roams <lb/>
            Through all the limbs distracted seed from seed <pb n="413"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IV. <lb/>
            </note>Severed, to join all powerless, or resume <lb/>
            Their wonted action ; hence each varying sense, <lb n="970"/>
            The fount sensorial failing, must itself <lb/>
            Fail too abrupt, the total body droop, <lb/>
            The limbs grow languid, listless hang the hands, <lb/>
            Totter the knees, and the faint eye-lids fall.</p>
          <p>Thus food, alike, when through the frame it pours <lb n="975"/>
            Its stream salubrious, since the toiling air <lb/>
            It mocks in action, slumber too excites. <lb/>
            And heavier far his sleep whom diet full, <lb/>
            Or long fatigue overpowers, for ampler, then, <lb/>
            Th' intestine labour, and the soul flies off <lb n="980"/>
            Ampler external; while the remnant shrinks <lb/>
            Profounder part, and part through every limb <lb/>
            Strays more distracted, of all bond devoid.</p>
          <p>Thus slumber issues ; and whatever the thoughts <lb/>
            That chief subdue us, the concerns that claim <lb n="985"/>
            Our ceaseless care, or what the mind explores <lb/>
            With patient pause, in dreams we still pursue. <lb/>
            The lawyer, thus, o'er briefs and statutes pores; <lb/>
            New wars the soldier wages; with the winds <lb/>
            Strives the vain mariner ; while we the laws <lb n="990"/>
            Of nature scan perpetual, and how best, <lb/>
            When traced, to paint them in our native tongue.</p>
          <p>So various lores beside, and arts diverse <lb/>
            Haunt, oft, in sleep the cheated mind of man. <lb/>
            He who from eve to eve, assiduous, long <lb n="995"/>
            Has marked the public stage, though now no more <lb/>
            It strikes his senses, through his porous frame <lb/>
            Still the light images admits that float <lb/>
            Countless around him. Hence, for many a day, <lb/>
            E'en while awake, the scene before his eyes <lb n="1000"/>
            Seems still renewed ; the light-deckt dancers move <lb/>
            Their modulated limbs, the living lyre <lb/>
            He hears entranced, from every fluent string <lb/>
            Speaking impassioned; he the throng surveys, <lb/>
            And all the pageantry the drama boasts.. <lb n="1005"/>
            </p>
          <p>Of such vast import are the plans pursued, <lb/>
            The thoughts indulged, the customs deep impressed <lb/>
            Of man not merely, but of brutes as well. <lb/>
            For the nerved steed, as o'er the glebe he lies, <lb/>
            Oft sweats, and pants laborious in his sleep, <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
             <note type="margin"> BOOK IV <lb/>
            </note>As though amain contending for the palm.</p>
          <p>So, too, the hound, amid his soft repose, <lb/>
            Oft starts abrupt, and howls, and snuffs the breeze <lb/>
            With ceaseless nostrils, as though full at hand <lb/>
            He tracked the antlered trembler. And, at times, <lb n="1015"/>
            E'en while awake, with vigour he pursues <lb/>
            Vain semblances of deer as though themselves <lb/>
            Started before him, till the phantoms void <lb/>
            Vanish at length, and truth regain her sway. <lb/>
            E'en the soft lap-dog his inglorious sleep <lb n="1020"/>
            Breaks not unfrequent, rousing all erect, <lb/>
            Urged by the semblance of some face unknown. <lb/>
            And as of harsher seeds the trains are formed <lb/>
            Of floating phantoms, with augmented force <lb/>
            Strike they the mind. Hence birds, with flight abrupt, <lb n="1025"/>
            Oft to the centre of the sacred groves <lb/>
            At midnight hurry, in their dreams disturbed <lb/>
            By hideous sight of hawks, on outstretched wing, <lb/>
            Prowling aloft all active for the pounce.</p>
          <p>Then what vast toils engage men when asleep! <lb n="1030"/>
            How pants the mind beneath superb exploits ! <lb/>
            Kings strive with kings in combat; or at large <lb/>
            Contend, surrender, pour the cries of death; <lb/>
            While some fight on, though wounded, loading still <lb/>
            All heaven with groans, as though to atoms torn <lb n="1035"/>
            By some huge lion, or remorseless pard. <lb/>
            Some, too, aloud their machinations tell, <lb/>
            And thus in sleep full oft themselves accuse. <lb/>
            Some on their death-bed seem; and some to leap <lb/>
            Headlong from precipices ; by the fright <lb n="1040"/>
            Awoke, of reason so bereft, the mind <lb/>
            Scarce with the day resumes its wonted reign.</p>
          <p>While, oft, the dreamer, all athirst, overhangs <lb/>
            Some joyous stream, and drinks the total tide. <lb/>
            So boys asleep, too, deeming near at hand <lb n="1045"/>
            The public sewer, or close appropriate vase, <lb/>
            Oft lift their skirts the native brine t' eject, <lb/>
            And stain with saffron all the purple bed. <lb/>

            May pour forth praises worthy his desert <lb/>
            Whose matchless mind such wonders first disclosed ? <lb n="5"/>
            No mortal, doubtless. For, of things explored, <lb/>
            Such the majestic dignity, the sage <lb/>
            Must, so to speak, have been a god indeed: <lb/>
            A god, illustrious MEMMIUS ! he who first <lb/>
            The rules of life devised, now termed by all, <lb n="10"/>
            Sole, solid WISDOM ; he whose happy art <lb/>
            From such wild waves, such shades of ten-fold night <lb/>
            Leads us to truth, tranquillity, and day.</p>
          <p>What are to him the gods of earlier times ? <lb/>
            CERES, who taught the fruits of earth to rear, <lb n="15"/>
            As fame reports ? or BACCHUS, first who stole <lb/>
            The vine's purpureal spirit ? foods mankind <lb/>
            Without may flourish, and, through many a clime, <lb/>
            This moment know not; but of virtue void, <lb/>
            And purity of heart, man ill can thrive. <lb n="20"/>
            Hence ampler far his claim to rites divine <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Ours, too, the task to show how Nature bends, <lb/>
            With power presiding, the reluctant sun <lb/>
            And moon through all their courses; lest thou deem <lb/>
            These of themselves, 'twixt heaven and earth, fulfil <lb/>
            Their ceaseless rounds; renewing, as they roll, <lb n="85"/>
            Fruits, and the sentient tribes; or hold the gods <lb/>
            Guide the vast frame, unwearied, and unseen. <lb/>
            For he who j ustly deems th' immortals live <lb/>
            Safe, and at ease, yet fluctuates in his mind <lb/>
            How things are swayed, how chiefly those discerned <lb n="90"/>
            In heaven sublime,-to superstition back <lb/>
            Lapses, and rears a tyrant host, and, then, <lb/>
            Conceives, dull reasoner ! they can all things do; <lb/>
            While yet himself nor knows what may be done <lb/>
            Nor what may never; nature powers defined <lb n="95"/>
            Stamping on all, and bounds that none can pass.</p>
          <p>First, to delay no more then, we maintain <lb/>
            That earth, air, ocean, these stupendous scenes, <lb/>
            These triple bodies so diversely reared, <lb/>
            These, MEMMIUS! these one common day shall doom <lb n="100"/>
            To utter ruin; when, for ages propt, <lb/>
            The world’s vast system shall itself dissolve.</p>
          <p>Nor hid from me how new the creed we teach, <lb/>
            How wondrous to the mind, that heaven and earth <lb/>
            Should perish ever; or how hard the task <lb n="105"/>
            By words alone such tenets to confirm. <lb/>
            For thus thou e'er wilt find it when thy tongue <lb/>
            Opes some fresh subject sight has ne'er surveyed, <lb/>
            Nor touch developed, the main roads belief <lb/>
            Treads to the breast, and temple of the mind. &lt;<lb n="110"/>
            Yet will I strive; facts, haply, shall themselves <lb/>
            Aid me, and thou the world's vast fabric own <lb/>
            By dread convulsions shortly must be shook. <lb/>
            May fortune's smile this hour from us avert! <lb/>
            And truth, not feeling, the tremendous roar <lb n="115"/>

            Than e'er the PYTHIAN maid, with laurels crowned, <lb/>

             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>Some salutary precepts would I add, <lb n="120"/>
            Lest, chained by superstition, thou should'st deem <lb/>
            Heaven, earth, and ocean, sun, moon, stars exist <lb/>
            Gods in their frame, and of eternal date, <lb/>
            And fear for those the vengeance that pursued <lb n="125"/>
            The race gigantic, who, with lettered lore, <lb/>
            Shake the world's walls, the radiant eye of heaven <lb/>
            Quench, and th' immortals sketch in mortal terms. <lb/>
            For these, so far from arrogating, proud, <lb/>
            Celestial honours, and the rank of gods, <lb n="130"/>
            Full proof exhibit, rather, how devoid <lb/>
            Of vital action matter may exist, <lb/>
            And that not every compound frame alike <lb/>
            Boasts the high powers of intellect and mind.</p>
          <p>Trees not in ether, not in ocean clouds, <lb n="135"/>
            Nor in the fields can fishes e'er exist; <lb/>
            Nor blood in planks, nor vital juice in stones; <lb/>
            But all springs definite in scenes defined.. <lb/>
            So in the bosom lives, and there alone, <lb/>
            Mixt with its blood and nerves, the secret mind. <lb n="140"/>
            There only lives; for, could it roam at all, <lb/>
            Then rather should we through the body's self, <lb/>
            The heel or shoulder, or where else it chose, <lb/>
            Oft trace it wandering than forlorn abroad. <lb/>
            Since, e'en in body then, the soul and mind <lb n="145"/>
            Are fixt thus definite, we amply prove <lb/>
            That out of body, and a reasoning frame, <lb/>
            In putrid glebes of earth, or solar fire, <lb/>
            In air, or water, sense can never dwell. <lb/>
            And hence these ne'er divinity can boast, <lb n="150"/>
            Since e'en devoid of animated life.</p>
          <p>Nor deem the sacred mansion of the gods <lb/>
            O'er aught extend of this material frame: <lb/>
            For their immortal nature, far removed <lb/>
            From human sense, from matter gross and dull <lb n="155"/>
            Scarce by the mind's pure spirit can be traced. <lb/>
            Hence, as no touch of matter these can reach, <lb/>
            Their finer textures never can impress <lb/>
            Material objects for whate'er exists <lb/>
            Intangible, itself can never touch. <lb n="160"/>

            And that most impious is it to arraign <lb/>
            Aught thus constructed by the gods themselves <lb/>

            Most impious, though in words alone, to shake <lb/>
            The world's firm basis,-such conceits to feign, <lb/>
            To talk thus idly, MEMMIUS, is to rave. <lb/>
            For what vast gain can e'er th' immortal powers, <lb/>
            Blest in themselves, from human praise derive <lb n="175"/>
            To rouse them in our favour ? what new hope, <lb/>
            Such ages after of unsullied peace, <lb/>
            Could tempt them once to linger for a change ? <lb/>
            New scenes to welcome, joyless proves the past; <lb/>
            But where no ill can rise, where every hour, <lb n="180"/>
            Age after age, propitious still must glide, <lb/>
            How can the breast here burn for what is new ? <lb/>
            Dragged they their lives in darkness, then, and woe <lb/>
            Till sprang th' illumined world ? or, if ne'er born, <lb/>
            What cause could man have marshalled for complaint ? <lb n="185"/>
            Born, it behoves him, doubtless, to remain <lb/>
            In life while life one blessing can afford; <lb/>
            But what of vital joy ne'er tasted, ne'er <lb/>
            Ranked with the living, how can such object, <lb/>
            And with what reason, that it ne'er was formed? <lb n="190"/>
            </p>
          <p>Whence could the gods the model, too, deduce <lb/>

            Whence, too, the powers of atoms could they learn, <lb/>

            Then torrid heat, too, and perpetual frost <lb/>
            Shut from mankind near half the solid earth. <lb/>
            While what of glebe remains, from power innate <lb/>

            The growth restrain; by love of life led on <lb n="220"/>

            In every mode: for all that pours profuse <lb/>
            From things perpetual, the vast ocean joins <lb/>
            Of air sublime; which if to things again <lb n="290"/>
            Paid not, thus balancing the loss sustained, <lb/>
            All into air would dissipate and die. <lb/>
            Hence, born from things, to things air still returns <lb/>
            Ceaseless, as prove their fluctuating forms.</p>
          <p>Then, too, th' ethereal sun, exhaustless fount <lb n="295"/>
            Of liquid light, all heaven with flame bedews, <lb/>
            And pours o'er lustre lustre ever new. <lb/>
            For, fall where'er it may, th' impinging beam <lb/>
            Dies in the contest instant. This full clear <lb/>
            See we, whene'er by interposing clouds, <lb n="300"/>
            The solar disc is blotted, and its rays <lb/>
            Fractured abrupt; for the bright stream below <lb/>
            Then fades, and all the sickening scene is shade. <lb/>
            Hence may'st thou learn that things for ever claim <lb/>
            New radiance, and that every wave propelled <lb n="305"/>
            Wastes instantaneous-while alone survives <lb/>
            Perpetual shine from rays perpetual poured.</p>
          <p>So from our earthly lights, too, trimmed at eve, <lb/>
            The pendant lamp, the taper, or the torch <lb/>
            Flaring bituminous through clouds of smoke, <lb n="310"/>
            Stream new-born lustres from their several fires <lb/>
            With brandish ceaseless, ceaseless or the scene <lb/>
            Would instant frown with discontinuous blaze. <lb/>
            So rapid rush they ! such the headlong speed <lb/>
            With which the present triumphs o'er the past. <lb n="315"/>
            So sun, moon, stars alike are deemed t' eject, <lb/>
            Birth after birth, still fresh-engendered rays, <lb/>
            Glittering through time with light that never lives.</p>
          <p>E'en seest thou not how stones themselves decay ? <lb/>
            How turrets totter, and the rigid rock <lb n="320"/>
            Crumbles in time to dust ? how yield, at length, <lb/>
            Fanes, altars, images by age worn out ? <lb/>
            Nor can the gods resist th' impending fate, <lb/>
            Or war with nature. Moulder not, moreover, <lb/>
            The marble tombs of heroes ? as though each <pb n="423"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V <lb/>
            </note>Sought, like the form it clasps, an early end. <lb n="325"/>
            And rush not oft huge crags, from mountain heights <lb/>
            Hurled headlong, powerless to resist the rage <lb/>
            Of finite time ? for had they nourished firm <lb/>
            From time eternal, they had flourished still. <lb n="330"/>

            Folds all creation in its mighty grasp; <lb/>
            This whence, as some tell, all first rose, and where <lb/>
            All shall at last return-this too exists <lb/>
            Create and mortal; for whatever augments <lb n="335"/>
            Aught else, and nurtures, must itself decrease, <lb/>
            Repaired alone by matters re-absorbed.</p>
          <p>Yet grant this heaven, this earth the heaven surrounds, <lb/>
            Time ne'er produced, eternal of themselves- <lb/>
            Whence ere the THEBAN war, and fate of TROY, <lb n="340"/>
            Have earlier bards no earlier actions sung ? <lb/>
            Whence fell each chief unhonoured ? and his deeds <lb/>
            Shut from the tablet of immortal fame ? <lb/>
            But, or I err, the world's vast scope exists <lb/>
            New from its nature, and of recent birth:<lb n="345"/>
            For many a liberal art now first unfolds, <lb/>
            And much is still progressive; genius much, <lb/>
            E'en at this hour, to navigation adds; <lb/>
            Nor minstrels long have struck the dulcet lyre: <lb/>
            While the vast science of the RISE OF THINGS <lb n="350"/>
            Throughout is novel; and, among the first, <lb/>
            I first aID numbered who the lore devised, <lb/>
            And taught its dictates in our native tongue.</p>
          <p>Yet should'st thou deem that all things erst ensued <lb/>
            As now, but that the race of men unknown, <lb n="355"/>
            With all their records, conflagrations dire <lb/>
            Swept from the world, or earthquakes deep ingulfed, <lb/>
            Or floods, rapacious from perpetual rains, <lb/>
            Drowned, and their towns and citadels dissolved: <lb/>
            Then flows it doubly thou must own, convinced, <lb n="360"/>
            That heaven and earth hereafter may decay. <lb/>
            For since such woes, such dangers can assail <lb/>
            Created things, when once the cause augments <lb/>
            Perdition boundless must perforce ensue. <lb/>
            Nor by aught else can we ourselves decide <lb n="365"/>
            Mortal, but that with maladies we droop <lb/>

            1 <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>Like those whom NATURE ceaseless calls from life.</p>
          <p>What lives immortal, too, must so exist <lb/>
            Or from its own solidity, empowered <lb/>
            Each blow to conquer, undivided still <lb n="370"/>
            As primal atoms, long anterior sung; <lb/>
            Or since, like vacuum, of all friction void, <lb/>
            Free from all touch, by impulse unimpaired; <lb/>
            Or from the want of circling space in which <lb/>
            The severing atoms may dissolve and fall: <lb n="375"/>
            Such want the boundless whole of nature proves, <lb/>
            And hence eternal, for no place beyond <lb/>
            Spreads where its seeds could waste; nor from without <lb/>
            Can foreign force e'er enter to destroy. <lb/>
            But nor, as urged above, exists the world <lb n="380"/>
            All solid, since in all things void combines, <lb/>
            Nor yet all vacuum ; nor, from the profound, <lb/>
            Are wanting powers adverse that, into act <lb/>
            Once roused tempestuous, may the world derange, <lb/>
            Or sever total; nor deficient space <lb n="385"/>
            Spread widely round, through which, in countless modes, <lb/>
            The frame mundane may crumble and dissolve; <lb/>
            Hence not precluded from the gates of death <lb/>
            Is heaven, or earth, or sun, or main immense, <lb/>
            Gates in full view, unfolded wide to each. <lb n="390"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hence too, since mortal, each alike exists <lb/>
            Of frame created; for no mortal make <lb/>
            Could, from eternal time, the rage have borne <lb/>
            Of countless ages urgent to devour.</p>
          <p>And since, moreover, the world's vast members strive <lb n="395"/>
            In ruthless war, contending each with each, <lb/>
            Seest thou not clear some final shock must soon <lb/>
            Decide the contest ? that the fiery sun <lb/>
            Perchance may conquer, and each flood drink up <lb/>
            Till nought survive ; as oft disposed he seems; <lb n="400"/>
            Yet idly. For so vast the stores supplied <lb/>
            From springs perpetual, such the boundless main, <lb/>
            A daily deluge threats us; yet alike <lb/>
            Threats us in vain ; for much the winnowing winds <lb/>
            Skim from the surface, and th' ethereal sun <lb n="405"/>
            Such draughts exhales insatiate, that the world <lb/>
            With drought than deluge rather must expire: <pb n="425"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>So strive they equal, so with powers alike <lb/>
            Pant for the lists. And hence, as fame reports, <lb/>
            Flame triumphed once, and once the boisterous waves <lb n="410"/>
            Leaped o'er their boundaries, and the world ingulfed. <lb/>
            Flame triumphed, and the total orb was fire <lb/>
            When the wild fury of the solar steeds <lb/>
            Whirled through the heavens, and o'er th' astounded earth <lb/>
            Ill-fated PHAETON, whom, deep-incensed, <lb n="415"/>
            Almighty JOVE hurled headlong from the skies, <lb/>
            While PHŒBUS caught th' eternal lamp, restrained <lb/>
            Abrupt the trembling coursers, reined afresh, <lb/>
            And into peace re-organized the world. <lb/>
            So feign the bards of GREECE, devoid alike <lb n="420"/>
            Of truth and reason. Yet the power of fire <lb/>
            Doubtless might triumph, should the fiery seeds <lb/>
            Collect too largely from th' abyss of things: <lb/>
            When or some fiercer force their rage must quell, <lb/>
            Or the red siroc burn the world to dust. <lb n="425"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus, too, th' insurgent waters once o’erpowered, <lb/>
            As fables tell, and deluged many a state; <lb/>
            Till, in its turn, the congregated waves <lb/>
            By cause more potent conquered, heaven restrained <lb/>
            Its ceaseless torrents, and the floods decreased. <lb n="430"/>
            </p>
          <p>But from this boundless mass of matter first <lb/>
            How heaven, and earth, and ocean, sun, and moon, <lb/>
            Rose in nice order, now the muse shall tell. <lb/>
            For never, doubtless, from result of thought, <lb/>
            Or mutual compact, could primordial seeds <lb n="435"/>
            First harmonize, or move with powers precise. <lb/>
            But countless crowds in countless manners urged, <lb/>
            From time eternal, by intrinsic weight, <lb/>
            And ceaseless repercussion, to combine <lb/>
            In all the possibilities of forms, <lb n="440"/>
            Of actions, and connexions, and exert <lb/>
            In every change some effort to create- <lb/>
            Reared the rude frame at length, abruptly reared, <lb/>
            Which, when once gendered, must the basis prove <lb/>
            Of things sublime ; and whence eventual rose <lb n="445"/>
            Heaven, earth, and ocean, and the tribes of sense.</p>
          <p>Yet now nor sun on fiery wheel was seen <lb/>
            Riding sublime, nor stars adorned the pole, <pb n="426"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V <lb/>
            </note>Nor neaven, nor earth, nor air, nor ocean lived, <lb/>
            Nor aught of prospect mortal sight surveys; <lb n="450"/>
            But one vast chaos boisterous, and confused. <lb/>
            Yet order hence began; the mingled mass <lb/>
            Unveiled its various powers ; congenial parts <lb/>
            Parts joined congenial; and the rising world <lb/>
            Gradual evolved: its mighty members each <lb n="455"/>
            From each divided, and matured complete <lb/>
            From seeds appropriate; whose wild discord erst, <lb/>
            Reared by their strange diversities of form, <lb/>
            With ruthless war so broke their proper paths, <lb/>
            Their motions, intervals, conjunctions, weights, <lb n="460"/>
            And repercussions, nought of genial act <lb/>
            Till now could follow, nor the seeds themselves, <lb/>
            E'en though conjoined, in mutual bond cohere. <lb/>
            Thus air, secreted, rose o'er labouring earth; <lb/>
            Secreted, ocean flowed; and the pure fire, <lb n="465"/>
            Secreted too, towards ether sprang sublime.</p>
          <p>But first the seeds terrene, since ponderous most, <lb/>
            And most perplext, in close embraces clung, <lb/>
            And towards the centre conglobating sunk. <lb/>
            And, as the bond grew firmer, ampler forth <lb n="470"/>
            Pressed they the fluent essences that reared <lb/>
            Sun, moon, and stars, and main, and heaven's high walls. <lb/>
            For these of atoms lighter far consist, <lb/>
            Subtler, and more rotund than those of earth. <lb/>
            Whence, from the pores terrene, with foremost haste <lb n="475"/>
            Rushed the bright ether, towering high, and swift <lb/>
            Streams of pure fire attracting as it flowed. <lb/>
            Not differing wide from what full oft we view <lb/>
            When, at the dawn, the golden-tressed sun <lb/>
            Flames o'er the meadows rich with rory gems, <lb n="480"/>
            And from the mountains, lakes, and teeming glebes, <lb/>
            Draws many a vapour; which, when once aloft <lb/>
            By the chill air condensed, to clouds concretes, <lb/>
            And with its filmy drapery veils the heavens. <lb/>
            So the light ether, as from every point <lb n="485"/>
            Fluent it rose, concreted, and a bound <lb/>
            Gradual assumed, and, thus assuming, grasped <lb/>
            In its vast compass all th' evolving world.</p>
          <p>Then mounted, next, the base of sun, and moon, <pb n="427"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>'Twixt earth and ether, in the midway air, <lb n="490"/>
            Rolling their orbs; for into neither these <lb/>
            Could blend harmonious, since too light with earth <lb/>
            To sink deprest, while yet too ponderous far <lb/>
            To fly with ether towards the realms extreme: <lb/>
            So 'twixt the two they hovered; vital there <lb n="495"/>
            Moving for ever, parts of the vast whole; <lb/>
            As move for ever in the frame of man <lb/>
            Some active organs, while some oft repose.</p>
          <p>These from the mass discharged, much next of eartu <lb/>
            Subsided sudden, and the gulf disclosed <lb n="500"/>
            Where ocean rolls his blue and briny tide. <lb/>
            And as th' ethereal gas, and solar blaze <lb/>
            Flowed more profuse, and lashed, with ceaseless rage, <lb/>
            The porous surface, firmer thus condensed <lb/>
            Towards its own centre, the corrosive lymph <lb n="505"/>
            Ampler transuded; and with livelier streams <lb/>
            Filled the wide hollow of the liquid plains: <lb/>
            And ampler, too, th' attenuate textures rushed <lb/>
            Of air, and fire, and, borne on swifter wing, <lb/>
            High reared the radiant temples of the sky. <lb n="510"/>
            Low sunk the vales, the mountains still sublime <lb/>
            Stood, for no power their rocky base could shake, <lb/>
            Nor equal settled e'en the softer soils. <lb/>
            So all was formed : the ponderous bulk of earth <lb/>
            Concentred close, and to the lowliest base <lb n="515"/>
            Fell, the foul faeces of th' unfolding world: <lb/>
            While ocean, air, and ether filled with fire, <lb/>
            Sprang from the remnant atoms more refined. <lb/>
            Yet these, too, differed; for, though liquid all, <lb/>
            And light, yet ether far the rest surpassed, <lb n="520"/>
            Most light, most liquid, and in heaven sublime <lb/>
            Hence loftiest towered it, never mingling once <lb/>
            With the rude tumults of the lowlier air: <lb/>
            For whirlwinds this, and wayward tempests, oft, <lb/>
            Shatter abrupt, while ether glides through time <lb n="525"/>
            In one smooth course, and bears its fires along ; <lb/>
            As flows th' undevious EUXINE, and preserves <lb/>
            One ceaseless tenor, limpid and serene.</p>
          <p>How move the stars, now next the muse shall sing. <lb/>
            And first, if heaven's vast orb we deem revolve <pb n="428"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V <lb/>
            </note>Round the fixt earth, some subtle gas, perchance, <lb n="530"/>
            Bounds it on all sides, and with two-fold stream, <lb/>
            Whirls round its poles; the current urged above <lb/>
            Steering the course the gliding planets point, <lb/>
            Themselves hence soon propelled; while that below <lb n="535"/>
            Flows adverse, and the nether sphere drives on, <lb/>
            As drives the tide the mill's unwearied wheel.</p>
          <p>Yet, if unmoved the heavenly orb we deem, <lb/>
            Its fires may still revolve: some restless seeds <lb/>
            Of all-elastic ether, close pent up, <lb n="540"/>
            Panting for ease, may agitate their balls, <lb/>
            And round the sky's refulgent concave whirl. <lb/>
            Or air absorbed extrinsic may, alike, <lb/>
            With restless rage compel them; or themselves <lb/>
            Each choose his various path as food invites, <lb n="545"/>
            Their lucid lamps recruiting through the heavens. <lb/>
            But of these causes which in this world rules <lb/>
            'Tis hard t' affirm ; whence rather here we teach <lb/>
            What through th' ENTIRE OF NATURE may subsist <lb/>
            Mid various worlds to various models framed, <lb n="550"/>
            And strive t' unfold whate'er may haply bend, <lb/>
            In different systems, different stars, than aught <lb/>
            Assign precise for either. One alone <lb/>
            Of those now numbered, one sole cause propels <lb/>
            The stars of earth, but which that cause the sage <lb n="555"/>
            Yet dares not name, who treads with cautious foot.</p>
          <p>But, that this mass terrene might hold unmoved <lb/>
            The world's mid regions, its excess of weight, <lb/>
            From its own centre downwards, gradual ceased; <lb/>
            And all below a different power assumed <lb n="560"/>
            From earliest birth, a nature more attuned <lb/>
            To the pure air on which it safe reposed. <lb/>
            Hence earth to air no burden proves, nor deep <lb/>
            Grinds it with pressure; as the limbs no load <lb/>
            Feel to the body, to the neck no weight <lb n="565"/>
            Th' incumbent head, nor e'en the total form <lb/>
            Minutest labour to the feet below: <lb/>
            While yet each foreign substance, though but light, <lb/>
            Grieves oft severely instant as imposed; <lb/>
            So vast th' importance things their like should join. <lb n="570"/>
            For from a distance earth was never brought, <pb n="429"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>And into air at once abruptly hurled; <lb/>
            But both sprang equal when the world first rose, <lb/>
            Each part of each as limb with limb combines.</p>
          <p>When, too, with thunder shake the realms above <lb n="575"/>
            Earth feels the dread concussion, and rebounds; <lb/>
            Effect which ne'er could flow did nought of tie <lb/>
            Bind it to ether, and the world of air: <lb/>
            For each to each, as with commingled roots, <lb/>
            Cleave from their birth, congenial, and conjoined. <lb n="580"/>
            Seest thou not, ceaseless, how th' attenuate soul <lb/>
            Bears up the ponderous body, since alike <lb/>
            Conjoined, congenial; when the total frame <lb/>
            Leaps up abrupt, whence flows the salient force <lb/>
            But from the soul the members that commands ? <lb n="585"/>
            </p>
          <p>Seest thou not hence, then, what the subtlest power <lb/>
            May compass when with ponderous frames conjunct, <lb/>
            As earth with air, or with the body mind ?</p>
          <p>Nor less, nor larger much the solar wheel <lb/>
            Measures than meets the view: far be the space <lb n="590"/>
            Of utmost length through which aught igneous throws <lb/>
            Its liquid heat, its lustre o'er the limbs, <lb/>
            While these yet reach us it can ne'er so far <lb/>
            Lie that the distance should curtail its size. <lb/>
            Since, then, the sun flings down his fires, profuse, <lb n="595"/>
            His light on all things, he must still exist <lb/>
            Nor less, nor larger than the vision views.</p>
          <p>Thus too the moon, shine she with borrowed blaze, <lb/>
            Or pour essential splendour from herself, <lb/>
            Moves with the magnitude the sight surveys. <lb n="600"/>
            For all discerned through tracts of air remote <lb/>
            Grows first confused and indistinct of form <lb/>
            Ere yet its size diminish; but the moon, <lb/>
            Since traced precise through e'en her utmost orb, <lb/>
            Must prove the sphere the sight descries sublime. <lb n="605"/>

          <p>Th' ethereal stars, moreo'er—since lights terrene <lb/>

            Their lambent fires, their radiance unimpaired, <lb/>
            Scarce obvious dwindle,-must themselves alike <lb/>
            In size scarce vary from the form they show. <lb n="610"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor deem it strange that so minute a sun <lb/>

            Through all things, here as to their fountain flow, <lb/>
            And hence well forth o'er all th' exulting world <lb/>
            In boundless flood: seest thou how small a spring <lb/>
            Feeds with its liquid treasures meads, full oft, <lb/>
            Of amplest breadth, and all their glebe overflows ? <lb n="620"/>

          <p>Or the small globe of solar flame, perchance, <lb/>
            Th' effusive air may fire, than aught besides <lb/>

          <p>Or haply stores, impalpable to sight, <lb/>

            Whence amply draws it its eternal blaze.</p>
          <p>Nor trace we clear by what unvarying law, <lb/>
            When summer fades, the sun his downward path <lb n="630"/>
            Bends towards the wintry goat, and thence, in turn, <lb/>
            Reclimbs the heavens, and, from the red crab, pours <lb/>
            The sultry solstice; or, why seems the moon <lb/>
            O'er the same space to voyage every month <lb/>
            The toiling sun claims twelve t' achieve complete. <lb n="635"/>
            These nought unfolds decisive; for the dogm <lb/>
            Of sage DEMOCRITUS we, first, may deem <lb/>
            Haply efficient, that the radiant signs, <lb/>

            Roll in the heaven's vast whirlpool, heaven below <lb n="640"/>
            Gradual its race relaxing; whence the sun <lb/>
            And solar satellites must more and more <lb/>
            Be backwards left, deserted, since full deep <lb/>
            Lie they beneath the blue ethereal fires: <lb/>
            While the bright moon lies deeper still, and hence <lb n="645"/>
            Still powerless more, as nearer earth's low bounds, <lb/>
            To match the speed the loftier signs display. <lb/>
            As tardier moves she in her proner path <lb/>
            Than moves the sun, as swifter o'er her rolls <lb/>
            The wondrous vortex of sublimest heaven. <lb n="650"/>
            Whence seems she speedier through each sign t' advance, <lb/>
            While o'er herself each sign but fleeter flies.</p>
          <p>Or different airs, perchance, at times defined, <pb n="431"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>Rush o'er the converse hemispheres of earth; <lb/>
            This the moon driving from the summer fires <lb n="655"/>
            Down towards the wintry arc, and realms of ice; <lb/>
            And that, alternate, raising her again <lb/>
            From frost's drear solstice to the sultry signs. <lb/>
            Thus moves the sun too, haply, and the stars <lb/>
            Alternate thus, by converse airs propelled, <lb n="660"/>
            Roll their vast rounds, and fill the mighty year. <lb/>
            Seest thou not oft, from different winds, the clouds <lb/>

            Why then, alike, may different streams of air <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Then night, at length, the world with darkness shrouds, <lb/>
            Or since the sun, at heaven's remotest verge, <lb/>

            Curtailed already by the race achieved <lb/>

            Still drives his restless axle earth beneath, <lb/>
            That, through the day, propelled his orb sublime.</p>
          <p>Then the young MORNING, too, at hour precise <lb/>

            Renew the solar splendour: facts like these <lb/>

            Clouds, thunders, tempests, rains, and gelid snows, <pb n="432"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>At punctual seasons all alike recur. <lb n="695"/>
            For as the train of causes first uprose, <lb/>
            And the young world its earliest features found, <lb/>
            Things follow things in order most exact.</p>
          <p>And day elongates, and the night contracts, <lb/>
            And night augments, and day curtails its course, <lb n="700"/>
            Since the same sun, earth under and above <lb/>
            Revolving, ether with unequal curve <lb/>
            Cleaves, and to parts of magnitude unlike <lb/>
            Severs the globe; alternate this o'er that <lb/>
            Prevailing gradual till the nodes he reach <lb n="705"/>
            Where night and day assimilate their reigns. <lb/>
            For, in the central realms 'twixt north and south, <lb/>
            His utmost wanderings, midway, heaven divides: <lb/>
            So traverse winds the star-enamelled path <lb/>
            Through which his mazy steps the seasons lead, <lb n="710"/>
            With ray oblique illuming earth and sky. <lb/>
            For thus they hold the heavenly orb who mark <lb/>
            Throughout arranged with constellations fair. <lb/>
            Or, earth beneath, the atmosphere, perchance, <lb/>
            Hangs,in fixt places, heavier; whence the seeds <lb n="715"/>
            Of congregating fires, with toil immense, <lb/>
            Wade through, and later weave the trembling dawn: <lb/>
            And whence, through winter, long the tedious night <lb/>
            Drawls, ere the day-star rears his radiant front. <lb/>
            Or, haply, the young fires that frame the sun <lb n="720"/>
            More swift or tardy towards the purple east <lb/>
            Alternate rush, as round the seasons roll.</p>
          <p>The moon may shine by solar lustres struck, <lb/>
            Her argent front augmenting every day <lb/>
            As from the sun she wanders, till, at length.' <lb n="725"/>
            Now full opposed, her total disc is light, <lb/>
            And, rising east, she marks his westward fall: <lb/>
            Then step by step retracting, earth beneath, <lb/>
            Her full-blown lamp, as towards the sun she curves, <lb/>
            Through all the remnant of the radiant signs; <lb n="730"/>
            As deems the sage who holds her form globose, <lb/>
            And that below the solar orb her path <lb/>
            Punctual she winds ; and sound the doctrine seems.</p>
          <p>Yet may the moon with lustre all her own <lb/>
            Shine, every phase unfolding, if,in front, <lb n="735"/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            Some other orb attend her, through her course <lb/>
            Gliding complete, in every mode convolved, <lb/>
            While viewless still to sight since reared opaque. <lb/>
            Or she may still, if spherical of form, <lb/>
            Each change disclose, though luminous but half: <lb n="740"/>
            For, as she self-revolves,her gradual lamp <lb/>
            Must grow till all her bright side beams complete; <lb/>
            Then, rolling still, as gradual must she close <lb/>
            Her lucid eye, till all opposed is shade; <lb/>
            As teach CHALDEAN magi, striving strong <lb n="745"/>
            The schools of GREECE t’o'erpower, as though the creeds <lb/>
            Waged endless war, or this than that adduced <lb/>
            Proofs more conclusive to th' unbiassed mind.</p>
          <p>Why too may not each rising moon be new ? <lb/>
            Its time, form, place, by nicest order swayed, <lb n="750"/>
            And, springing daily, daily too decay, <lb/>
            Still reproduced for ever ? this to solve <lb/>
            Both words and reasoning arduous find alike, <lb/>
            Since things throughout in order flow precise.</p>
          <p>SPRING comes, and VENUS, and, with foot advanced, <lb n="755"/>
            The light-winged ZEPHYR, harbinger beloved, <lb/>
            Maternal FLORA strewing, ere she treads, <lb/>
            O'er every footstep blooms of choicest hue, <lb/>
            And the glad ETHER loading with perfumes. <lb/>
            Then HEAT succeeds, the parched ETESIAN breeze, <lb n="760"/>
            And dust-discoloured CERES ; AUTUMN, then, <lb/>
            Follows, and tipsy BACCHUS arm in arm, <lb/>
            And STORMS and TEMPESTS; EURUS roars amain; <lb/>
            And the red SOUTH brews thunders: till, at length, <lb/>
            COLD shuts the scene, and WINTER'S train prevails, <lb n="765"/>
            SNOWS, hoary SLEET, and FROST with chattering teeth. <lb/>
            Whence scarce stupendous seems it that the moon <lb/>
            Should punctual rise, and, rising, punctual die, <lb/>
            Since things at large, so punctual, things succeed.</p>
          <p>Thus, too, to various causes may'st thou charge <lb n="770"/>
            The sun's eclipse, or shade of lunar light. <lb/>
            For why should rather, 'twixt the sun and earth, <lb/>
            The moon rush rampant, and with shadowy orb, <lb/>
            Shut from mankind the radiant fount of day, <lb/>
            Than aught besides that haply may subsist <lb n="775"/>
            Rolling sublime, but ever void of light ? <note type="footnote"> 2 F </note> <pb n="434"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V <lb/>
            </note>Why may not, too, in time and place prescribed, <lb/>
            The sun himself grow languid, his bright beam <lb/>
            Powerless to pour, till now the spot he pass <lb/>
            That thus obstructs his glory and renews ? <lb n="780"/>
            </p>
          <p>And why, moreover, should earth alone arrest <lb/>
            Light from the labouring moon, and, riding high, <lb/>
            Blindfold the solar disc, the lunar sphere, <lb/>
            Still loftier, gliding through her shadowy cone, <lb/>
            While nought of body else, 'twixt moon and sun <lb n="785"/>
            Rushing, can quench the ray profusely dealt ? <lb/>
            So, if the moon herself be lustrous, why <lb/>
            May ne'er that lustre languish till the bound <lb/>
            Joyous she pass that poisons all her lamp ?</p>
          <p>Thus having traced the causes obvious most <lb n="790"/>
            That sway the sapphire heavens; whence the bright sun, <lb/>
            The moon fulfil their courses, and the shade <lb/>
            How reared that oft their radiant front enwraps, <lb/>
            Hiding abrupt, as though their eyes now winked, <lb/>
            And now re-opened, o'er the face of things <lb n="795"/>
            Shedding afresh clear floods of lucid white; <lb/>
            Once more return we to the world's pure prime, <lb/>
            Her fields yet liquid, and the tribes survey <lb/>
            First she put forth, and trusted to the winds.</p>
          <p>And first the race she reared of verdant herbs, <lb n="800"/>
            Glistening o'er every hill; the fields at large <lb/>
            Shone with the verdant tincture, and the trees <lb/>
            Felt the deep impulse, and with outstretched arms <lb/>
            Broke from their bonds rejoicing. As the down <lb/>
            Shoots from the winged nations, or from beasts <lb n="805"/>
            Bristles or hair, so poured the new-born earth <lb/>
            Plants, fruits, and herbage. Then, in order next, <lb/>
            Raised she the sentient tribes, in various modes, <lb/>
            By various powers distinguished: for nor heaven <lb/>
            Down dropped them, nor from ocean's briny waves <lb n="810"/>
            Sprang they, terrestrial sole; whence, justly, EARTH <lb/>
            Claims the dear name of mother, since alone <lb/>
            Flowed from herself whatever the sight surveys.</p>
          <p>E'en now oft rears she many a sentient tribe, <lb/>
            By showers and sun-shine ushered into day. <lb n="815"/>
            Whence less stupendous tribes should then have risen <lb/>
            More, and of ampler make, herself new-formed, <pb n="435"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>In fiower of youth, and ETHER all mature.</p>
          <p>Of these birds first, of wing and plume diverse, <lb/>
            Broke their light shells in spring-time: as in spring <lb n="820"/>
            Still breaks the grasshopper his curious web, <lb/>
            And seeks, spontaneous, foods and vital air.</p>
          <p>Then rushed the ranks of mortals; for the soil, <lb/>
            Exuberant then, with warmth and moisture teemed. <lb/>
            So, o'er each scene appropriate, myriad wombs <lb n="825"/>
            Shot, and expanded, to the genial sward <lb/>
            By fibres fixt; and as, in ripened hour, <lb/>
            Their liquid orbs the daring fetus broke <lb/>
            Of breath impatient, nature here transformed <lb/>
            Th' assenting earth, and taught her opening veins <lb n="830"/>
            With juice to flow lacteal; as the fair <lb/>
            Now with sweet milk o'erflows, whose raptured breast <lb/>
            First hails the stranger-babe, since all absorbed <lb/>
            Of nurture, to the genial tide converts. <lb/>
            Earth fed the nursling, the warm ether clothed, <lb n="835"/>
            And the soft downy grass his couch composed.</p>
          <p>For the fresh world, as yet, no chills severe, <lb/>
            No parching heats, nor boisterous whirlwinds knew; <lb/>
            These, like all else, by time alone matured.</p>
          <p>Hence the dear name of mother, o'er and o'er, <lb n="840"/>
            Earth claims most justly, since the race of man <lb/>
            Long bore she of herself, each brutal tribe <lb/>
            Wild-wandering o'er the mountains, and the birds <lb/>
            Gay-winged, that cleave, diverse, the liquid air. <lb/>
            Yet drew, at length, the moment when herself <lb n="845"/>
            Could bear no longer; like her daughters since, <lb/>
            By age divested of parturient power. <lb/>
            For age the total world transforms, from state <lb/>
            To state for ever passing ; nought remains <lb/>
            Long its own like; all migrates sight surveys, <lb n="850"/>
            Varying each hour, from change to change propelled. <lb/>
            This grows and ripens, and with age corrupts; <lb/>
            That, from its ruins, springs, and perfects life. <lb/>
            So time transmutes the total world's vast frame, <lb/>
            From state to state urged on, now void of powers <lb n="855"/>

            Distant, yet neither total; shapes unsound, <lb n="860"/>
            Footless, and handless, void of mouth or eye, <lb/>
            Or from misj unction, maimed, of limb with limb: <lb/>
            To act all impotent, or flee from harm, <lb/>
            Or nurture take their loathsome days t' extend.</p>
          <p>These sprang at first, and things alike uncouth; <lb n="865"/>
            Yet vainly; for abhorrent NATURE quick <lb/>
            Checked their vile growth; so life's consummate flower <lb/>
            Ne'er reached they, foods appropriate never cropped, <lb/>
            Nor tasted joys venereal. For with cause <lb/>
            Cause ceaseless must combine, or nought can rise <lb n="870"/>
            Of race generic; genial foods must spring <lb/>
            And genial organs, from the total frame <lb/>
            The vital seeds concocted to collect; <lb/>
            And male must blend with female, and the bliss <lb/>
            Educed prove mutual, ere effect can flow. <lb n="875"/>
            </p>
          <p>Hence, doubtless, many a tribe has sunk supprest, <lb/>
            Powerless its kind to gender. For whatever <lb/>
            Feeds on the living ether, craft or speed, <lb/>
            Or courage stern, from age to age preserves <lb/>
            In ranks uninjured: while full many a class <lb n="880"/>
            Man guards himself, incited by their use.</p>
          <p>In strength ferocious thus the lion trusts, <lb/>
            In guile the fox, the stag in peerless flight; <lb/>
            While the light-slumbering dog, of heart sincere, <lb/>
            The bounding courser, herds, and fleecy flocks, <lb n="885"/>
            These, MEMMIUS, these protection claim from man. <lb/>
            For these the baser broods fly anxious, fond <lb/>
            Of quiet soft, and meals themselves ne'er bought; <lb/>
            Boons we bestow from certainty of gain. <lb/>
            But those such powers that boast not, void of means <lb n="890"/>
            Formed, for defence, nor tribute to mankind <lb/>
            Repaying ever-why should human aid <lb/>
            to such be lent, redeeming them from death ? <lb/>
            These, from their native bondage, must perforce <lb/>
            Fall to the feller sports, and victims rude, <lb n="895"/>
            Till the whole order cease, from earth extinct.</p>
          <p>Yet CENTAURS lived not: nor could shapes like these <lb/>
            Live ever, from two different natures reared, <lb/>
            Discordant limbs, and powers by powers reversed. <pb n="437"/>

          <p>The steed, o'er whom the year has thrice revolved, <lb/>
            Grows firm and vigorous; but the babe a babe <lb/>
            Still proves, and haply still explores, asleep, <lb/>
            The dulcet breast whose stores were late his own. <lb/>
            When, too, the steed's strong fibres faint with age, <lb n="905"/>
            And every member feels the coming fate, <lb/>
            Youth o'er the boy his fairest flower expands, <lb/>
            And the soft down sprouts earliest from his chin. <lb/>
            Deem not that man, then, and the servile horse, <lb/>
            Seeds mixt with seeds, can CENTAURS e'er create ;<lb n="910"/>
            Or, false alike, that SCYLLAS e'er exist, <lb/>
            Half-maid, half-mastiff; or aught else of shape <lb/>
            Engendered equal, dissonant of limb, <lb/>
            Whose flowery strength at different age matures, <lb/>
            And fades as different; whose connubial fires <lb n="915"/>
            Burn not the same; whose total tempers jar, <lb/>
            And from discordant foods who nurture life : <lb/>
            For hemlock, oft, rank poison to mankind, <lb/>
            Fattens the bearded goat with foul repast.</p>
          <p>too, since flame the lion's tawny skin <lb n="920"/>
            As fiercely burns as aught of brute besides, <lb/>
            Whence, when three natures into one combine, <lb/>
            The front a lion forming, the vile rump <lb/>
            A dragon, and the midst a goat grotesque, <lb/>
            Hence termed CHIMERA, can the breathing lungs <lb n="925"/>
            Pour streams of fire innocuous from the mouth ?</p>
          <p>Hence those who hold, when heaven and earth were new. <lb/>
            Urged by that newness as their total proof, <lb/>
            Such monsters rose, and shapes alike absurd, <lb/>
            On equal ground might feign the world's first floods <lb n="930"/>
            Were liquid gold, her earliest blossoms pearls, <lb/>
            And the first men such massy limbs displayed <lb/>
            That seas might rush beneath each ample stride, <lb/>
            And their vast fingers twirl the heaven's high orb. <lb/>
            But though, commixt, then various seeds of things <lb n="935"/>
            Thronged through the teeming soil, it flows not hence <lb/>
            That tribes unlike sprang forth with blended limbs. <lb/>
            Still from the soil herbs, fruits, and trees diverse <lb/>
            Shoot in profusion ; but each separate class <lb/>
            Ne'er blends preposterous. Things throughout proceed <pb n="438"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>In firm, undevious order, and maintain. <lb n="940"/>
            To nature true, their fixt generic stamp.</p>
          <p>Yet man's first sons, as o'er the fields they trod, <lb/>
            Reared from the hardy earth, were hardier far; <lb/>
            Strong built with ampler bones, with muscles nerved <lb n="945"/>
            Broad and substantial; to the power of heat, <lb/>
            Of cold, of varying viands, and disease, <lb/>
            Each hour superior; the wild lives of beasts <lb/>
            Leading, while many a lustre o'er them rolled. <lb/>
            Nor crooked plough-share knew they, nor to drive,<lb n="950"/>
            Deep through the soil, the rich-returning spade; <lb/>
            Norhow the tender seedling to re-plant, <lb/>
            Nor from the fruit-tree prune the withered branch. <lb/>
            What showers bestowed, what earth spontaneous bore, <lb/>
            And suns matured, their craving breasts appeased. <lb n="955"/>
            But acorn-meals chief culled they from the shade <lb/>
            Of forest-oaks; and, in their wintry months, <lb/>
            The wild wood-whortle with its purple fruit <lb/>
            Fed them, then larger and more amply poured. <lb/>
            And many a boon besides, now long extinct, <lb n="960"/>
            The fresh-formed earth her hapless offspring dealt.</p>
          <p>Then floods, and fountains, too, their thirst to slake, <lb/>
            Called them, as now the cataract abrupt <lb/>
            Calls, when athirst, the desert's savage tribes. <lb/>
            And, through the night still wandering, they the caves <lb n="965"/>
            Thronged of the wood-nymphs, whence the babbling well <lb/>
            Gushed oft profuse, and down its pebbly sides, <lb/>
            Its pebbly sides with verdant moss o’erspread, <lb/>
            Oozed slow, or sought, redundant sought, the plains.</p>
          <p>Nor knew they yet the crackling blaze t' excite, <lb n="970"/>
            Or clothe their limbs with furs, or savage hides. <lb/>
            But groves concealed them, woods, and hollow hills; <lb/>
            And, when rude rains, or bitter blasts o'erpowered, <lb/>
            Low bushy shrubs their squalid members wrapped.</p>
          <p>Nor public weal they boasted, nor the bonds <lb n="975"/>
            Sacred of laws, and order; what loose chance <lb/>
            Offered, each seized instinctive; for himself, <lb/>
            His life, his limbs, instructed sole to care.</p>
          <p>Wild in the forests they fulfilled their loves, <lb/>
            Or urged by mutual raptures, or the male, <lb n="980"/>
            Stung by fierce lust the female form subdued, <pb n="439"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>Or bought her favours by the tempting bait <lb/>
            Of acorns, crabs, or berries blushing deep.</p>
          <p>And in their keen rapidity of hand <lb/>
            And foot confiding, oft the savage train <lb n="985"/>
            With missile stones they hunted, or the force <lb/>
            Of clubs enormous ; many a tribe they felled, <lb/>
            Yet some in caves shunned, cautious; where, at night, <lb/>
            Thronged they, like bristly swine; their naked limbs <lb/>
            With herbs and leaves entwining. Nought of fear <lb n="990"/>
            Urged them to quit the darkness, and recall, <lb/>
            With clamorous cries, the sunshine and the day: <lb/>
            But sound they sunk in deep, oblivious sleep, <lb/>
            Till o'er the mountains blushed the roseate dawn. <lb/>
            For, from their birth, with ceaseless sight they traced <lb n="995"/>
            Night and the noon alternate, nor e'en once <lb/>
            Sprang the dread thought that such alternate night <lb/>
            Would ere long reign eternal, and the noon <lb/>
            O'er their closed eye-balls never glitter more. <lb/>
            This ne'er distressed them, but the fear alone <lb n="1000"/>
            Some ruthless monster might their dreams molest, <lb/>
            The foamy boar, or lion, from their caves <lb/>
            Drive them aghast beneath the midnight shade, <lb/>
            And seize their leaf-wrought couches for themselves.</p>
          <p>Yet then scarce more of mortal race than now <lb n="1005"/>
            Left the sweet lustre of the liquid day. <lb/>
            Some, doubtless, oft the prowling monsters gaunt <lb/>
            Grasped in their jaws, abrupt; whence, through the groves, <lb/>
            The woods, the mountains, they vociferous groaned, <lb/>
            Destined thus living to a living tomb. <lb n="1010"/>
            And some, by flight though saved from present fate, <lb/>
            Covering their fetid ulcers with their hands, <lb/>
            Prone o'er the ground death-still, with horrid voice, <lb/>
            Called, till vile worms devoured them, void of aid, <lb/>
            And all unskilled their deadly pangs t' appease. <lb n="1015"/>
            But thousands, then, the pomps of war beneath, <lb/>
            Fell not at once; nor ocean's boisterous waves <lb/>
            Wrecked, o'er rough rocks, whole fleets and countless crews <lb/>
            Nor ocean then, though oft to frenzy wrought, <lb/>
            Could aught indulge but ineffectual ire: <lb n="1020"/>
            Nor, lulled to calms, could e'er his traitor face <lb/>
            Lead, o'er the laughing waves, mistrustful man, <pb n="440"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V <lb/>
            </note>Untaught the dangerous science of the seas. <lb/>
            Then want consumed their languid members, now <lb/>
            Full-gorged excess devours us: they themselves <lb n="1025"/>
            Fed, heedless, oft with poisons: otter still <lb/>
            Men now for others mix the fatal cup.</p>
          <p>Yet when, at length, rude huts they first devised, <lb/>
            And fires, and garments; and, in union sweet, <lb/>
            Man wedded woman, the pure joys indulged <lb n="1030"/>
            Of chaste connubial love, and children rose, <lb/>
            The rough barbarians softened. The warm hearth <lb/>
            Their frames so melted they no more could bear, <lb/>
            As erst, th' uncovered skies; the nuptial bed <lb/>
            Broke their wild vigour, and the fond caress <lb n="1035"/>
            Of prattling children from the bosom chased <lb/>
            Their stern ferocious manners. Neighbours now <lb/>
            Joined in the bonds of friendship,and resolved <lb/>
            The softer sex to cherish, and their babes; <lb/>
            And owned by gestures, signs, and sounds uncouth, <lb n="1040"/>
            'Twas just the weaklier to protect from harm. <lb/>
            Yet all such bonds obeyed not; but the good, <lb/>
            The larger part their faith still uncorrupt <lb/>
            Kept, or the race of man had long expired, <lb/>
            Nor sire to son transferred the life received. <lb n="1045"/>
            </p>
          <p>Then nature, next, the tongue's innumerous tones <lb/>
            Urged them to try ; and sage convenience soon <lb/>
            To things applied them: as the embryo speech <lb/>
            Of infants first the aid of gesture claims, <lb/>
            And pointing finger to define its sense. <lb n="1050"/>
            For all their proper powers perceive, and feel <lb/>
            The use intended. The young calf, whose horns <lb/>
            Ne'er yet have sprouted, with his naked front <lb/>
            Butts when enraged: the lion-whelp or pard <lb/>
            With claws and teeth contends, ere teeth or claws <lb n="1055"/>
            Scarce spring conspicuous: while the pinioned tribes <lb/>
            Trust to their wings, and, from th' expanded down <lb/>
            Draw, when first fledged, a tremulous defence. <lb/>
            But to maintain that one devised alone <lb/>
            Terms for all nature, and th' incipient tongue <lb n="1060"/>
            Taught to the gazers round him, is to rave. <lb/>
            For how should he this latent power possess <lb/>
            Of naming all things, and inventing speech, <pb n="441"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>If never mortal felt the same besides ? <lb/>
            And, if none else had e'er adopted sounds, <lb n="1065"/>
            Whence sprang the knowledge of their use ?or how <lb/>
            Could this first linguist to the crowds around <lb/>
            Teach what he meaned ? his sole unaided arm <lb/>
            Could ne'er overpower them, and compel to learn <lb/>
            The vocal science, nor could aught avail <lb n="1070"/>
            Of eloquence or wisdom : nor with ease <lb/>
            Would the vain babbler have been long allowed <lb/>
            To pour his noisy jargon o'er their ears.</p>
          <p>But why so wondrous seems it that mankind, <lb/>
            With voice and tongue endowed, to notice things <lb n="1075"/>
            That voice should vary with the things themserves, <lb/>
            When the mute herds, and beasts ferocious, urged <lb/>
            By grief, or fear, or soft, emollient joy, <lb/>
            Press from their lungs sounds various and unlike ? <lb/>
            This every hour displays. When half-enraged <lb n="1080"/>
            The rude MOLOSSIAN mastiff, her keen teeth <lb/>
            Baring tremendous, with far different tone <lb/>
            Threats, than when roused to madness more extreme, <lb/>
            Or when she barks, and fills the world with roar. <lb/>
            Thus when her fearless whelps, too, she with tongue <lb n="1085"/>
            Lambent caresses, and with antic paw, <lb/>
            And tooth restrained, pretending still to bite, <lb/>
            Gambols, soft yelping tones of tender love- <lb/>
            Far differ then those accents from the din <lb/>
            Urged clamorous through the mansion when alone, <lb n="1090"/>
            Or the shrill howl her trembling bosom heaves <lb/>
            When, with slunk form, she waits th' impending blow.</p>
          <p>Neighs not the steed, too, different, when at large, <lb/>
            Mid the young mares, in life's luxuriant prime, <lb/>
            Pierced by the goads of pinioned love, he raves,- <lb n="1095"/>
            And when his full-blown nostrils snort for war, <lb/>
            And every quivering limb the tumult hails ?</p>
          <p>So, too, the feathery tribes of wing diverse, <lb/>
            Osprey, or hawk, or cliff-delighted gull <lb/>
            Gathering its vital nurture from the deep, <lb n="1100"/>
            Far different sounds at different times protrude <lb/>
            Than when they strive, in hostile guise, for prey. <lb/>
            E'en with the seasons some, as fame reports, <lb/>
            Change their hoarse accents, as the social rook, <pb n="442"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>And time-triumphant raven, when for showers, <lb n="1105"/>
            Or limpid rills they croak ; or, sultry, pant, <lb/>
            Beneath the dog-star, for the freshening breeze.</p>
          <p>Since then such various feelings can compel <lb/>
            Kinds the most mute such various sounds to eject, <lb/>
            How just ensues it that the race of man <lb n="1110"/>
            Should things diverse by countless tones denote ?</p>
          <p>If through such subjects thou would'st farther pry, <lb/>
            Know, then, that fire from thunder earliest sprang, <lb/>
            Each flame hence gendered. For full many a scene <lb/>
            Worked into blaze, th* ethereal flash beneath, ills <lb n="1115"/>
            See we the moment the dread shock is dealt. <lb/>
            Oft see we, too, when, waving in the winds, <lb/>
            Trees war with trees, the repercussion fierce <lb/>
            'Twixt branch and branch, stupendous, heat evolve, <lb/>
            Heat oft by flame succeeded; whence, perchance, <lb n="1120"/>
            From both mankind their primal fires deduced.</p>
          <p>But from the sun first learned they to prepare <lb/>
            The cultured meal hot-hissing o'er the hearth. <lb/>
            For all the plains produced the genial sun <lb/>
            They saw subjecting, by perpetual warmth <lb n="1125"/>
            Matured, and sweetened: whence the wiser part <lb/>
            First dared the change, and taught their wondering peers <lb/>
            The powers of coction, and the crackling blaze.</p>
          <p>Those, too, elected rulers, now began <lb/>
            Towns to project, and raise the massy fort, <lb n="1130"/>
            Heedful of distant dangers. Into shares <lb/>
            Their herds and lands they severed; and on those <lb/>
            Chief famed for beauty, eloquence, or strength, <lb/>
            Allotted ampler portions: for the form <lb/>
            Much then availed, and much the potent arm. <lb n="1135"/>
            But wealth ere long was fashioned, gold uprose, <lb/>
            And half the power of strength,and beauty fled. <lb/>
            And still the brave, the beauteous still, too oft, <lb/>
            Alike to riches bow the servile knee.</p>
          <p>Yet truest riches, would mankind their breasts <lb n="1140"/>
            Bend to the precept, in a little lie, <lb/>
            With mind well-poised; here want can never come. <lb/>

          <p>This clear discussed, learn next that silver, gold, <lb n="1270"/>
            Lead, hardier copper, iron, first were traced <lb/>
            When, o'er the hills, some conflagration dire <lb/>
            Burned from its basis the deep-rooted grove ; <lb/>
            By lightnings haply kindled, or the craft <lb/>
            Of hosts contending o'er the woodland scenes, <lb n="1275"/>
            A double fear thus striking through their foes: <lb/>
            Or by the shepherd's wish his bounds t' enlarge <lb/>
            O'er tracts of specious promise; or, perchance, <lb/>
            Wild beasts to slaughter, and their spoils possess ; <lb/>
            For such, with fire, and guileful pit, mankind <lb n="1280"/>
            First caught, ere hounds were marshalled to the chace, <lb/>
            Or round the copse the mazy net-work drawn.-</p>
          <p>Whatever the cause, when now the unctuous flame <lb/>
            Had from their utmost roots, with hideous crash, <lb/>
            Felled the tall trees, and, with its torrid heat, <lb n="1285"/>
            The soil deep-reddened, rills of liquid gold, <lb/>
            Lead, silver, copper, through its fervid pores <lb/>
            Glided amain, and every hollow filled. <lb/>
            These when, condensed, long after men surveyed <lb/>
            Glistening in earth, attracted by the glare, <lb n="1290"/>
            The splendid mass they dug ; and marked, surprised, <lb/>
            Each formed alike, and, to the channeled bed <lb/>
            Where late it lay, adapted most precise. <lb/>
            Then instant deemed they, liquefied by flame, <lb/>
            The power were theirs each various shape t' assume, <lb n="1295"/>
            Drawn dexterous out, of point or edge acute; <lb/>
            The power unrivalled theirs each tool to frame <lb/>
            Art needs to fell the forest, and its trees <lb/>
            Mould into planks or beams; to cleave, or smooth, <lb/>
            Pierce, hollow, scoop, whatever the plan conceived. <lb n="1300"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor strove they less such instruments t' obtain <lb/>
            From gold, or silver, than stern copper's strength. <lb/>
            Yet vainly : for their softer texture failed, <lb/>
            Powerless to bear the sturdy toil required. <lb/>
            Whence copper chief they courted, while all gold <lb n="1305"/>
            Neglected lay, too blunt and dull for use. <lb/>
            Now triumphs gold, while copper sinks despised. <lb/>
            So rolling years the seasons change of things : <lb/>
            What once was valued loses all its worth, <pb n="447"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>And what was worthlessrises in its stead, <lb n="1310"/>
            Swells into notice daily, every hour <lb/>
            Blooms with new praise, and captive leads the world.</p>
          <p>And hence how first the vigorous iron charmed, <lb/>
            Thyself, 0 MEmmius, may'st with ease deduce.</p>
          <p>Man's earliest arms were fingers, teeth, and nails, <lb n="1315"/>
            And stones, and fragments from the branching woods. <lb/>
            Then fires and flames they joined, detected soon; <lb/>
            Then copper next; and last, as latest traced, <lb/>
            The tyrant iron, than the copper vein <lb/>
            Less freely found, and sturdier to subdue. <lb n="1320"/>
            Hence first with copper ploughed they; in the waves <lb/>
            Mixed of wild warfare, dealt its deadly wounds, <lb/>
            And ransacked fields, and cattle; for th' unarmed <lb/>
            Soon yielded all things to the armed foe. <lb/>
            But, by degrees, the blade of iron gleamed, <lb n="1325"/>
            Triumphant rising o'er the copper tool. <lb/>
            With iron sole the genial soil they clove, <lb/>
            And with its fury tried the doubtful fray.</p>
          <p>First, too, on horse-back strove the martial chief, <lb/>
            The reins his left hand guiding, and his right <lb n="1330"/>
            Ruling the battle: then appeared he next <lb/>
            Drawn by twin steeds in warlike car sublime, <lb/>
            Both hands in action, by the driver sped. <lb/>
            Then twins to twins he joined, and to the car <lb/>
            Fixed the curved scythe. And next the TYRIAN tribes <lb/>
            Taught the huge elephant, with fortress loins <lb n="1336"/>
            And lithe proboscis, to delight in wounds, <lb/>
            And break the hostile squadrons. Step by step <lb/>
            So DISCORD poured her plagues accurst o'er man, <lb/>
            And heightened daily all the woes of war. <lb n="1340"/>
            </p>
          <p>Some too, as story tells, wild bulls and boars <lb/>
            Trained to the strife, and taught to face the foe. <lb/>
            While the rude PARTHIANS marshalled, mid their ranks, <lb/>
            Troops of fierce lions, by their keepers led, <lb/>
            To chain or loose them as the combat called. <lb n="1345"/>
            Yet vain th' attempt; for, maddened by the blood <lb/>
            Promiscuous spilt, o'er friends and foes alike <lb/>
            Rushed they voracious, shaking their dread crests; <lb/>
            Nor could the horseman his affrighted steed <lb/>
            Calm, or goad on the battle to renew. <pb n="448"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>Wide sprang the forest-tyrants, all in front <lb n="1350"/>
            Instant overpowering ; and, full oft, behind <lb/>
            Tumbling abrupt, the backward crowds, aghast, <lb/>
            Fixed they to earth, vain-grappling,—by their paws <lb/>
            And teeth terrific torn alike to death. <lb n="1355"/>
            Then, too, the boars, high tossed tli' infuriate bulls, <lb/>
            Or crushed them with their hoofs ; or through the steeds <lb/>
            Drove deep their gory horns, appalled and faint, <lb/>
            Or 'gainst the ground their frantic foreheads dashed. <lb/>
            While the mad boars against their owners aimed <lb n="1360"/>
            Their tusks remorseless, tinging with their blood <lb/>
            Th' unbroken darts, (the broken they themselves <lb/>
            Tinged with their own blood, trailing o'er the ground,) <lb/>
            In one joint tumult slaughtering man and horse. <lb/>
            And though the steed strove oft by sudden start, <lb n="1365"/>
            Sidelong, to fly the fang, or pranced erect <lb/>
            Beating th' unsolid air, 'twas idle all, <lb/>
            Since, rent through many a tendon, down he sunk, <lb/>
            Shaking the champaign. Thus the beasts they deemed <lb/>
            At home tamed amply, mid the battle's rage, <lb n="1370"/>
            Its wounds, its shrieks, its terrors, and its toils, <lb/>
            Frantic once more surveyed they, void of rule. <lb/>
            All, rampant, raved alike, as frequent now <lb/>
            Raves the young elephant to arms unused, <lb/>
            Trampling his keepers with tremendous crush. <lb n="1375"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus men, perchance, have fought; or, rather, thus <lb/>
            Their fights have planned in secret, pausing deep <lb/>
            O'er the dread ills such schemes were sure t' unfold. <lb/>
            Whence, if such wars have raged, 'tis safer far, <lb/>
            Amid the various worlds through space that throng, <lb n="1380"/>
            To leave their seat uncertain, than towards earth <lb/>
            Specific point, or aught of world besides. <lb/>
            Yet must they, doubtless, have been waged from hope <lb/>
            Far less of conquest than revenge, each host <lb/>
            Unarmed, unmarshalled, and of death assured. <lb n="1385"/>
            </p>
          <p>The rude-stitched hide preceded the wove vest, <lb/>
            Planned after iron, and with iron wrought: <lb/>
            For without this the loom had ne'er been framed, <lb/>
            Its shuttles, treadles, sley, and creaking beam.</p>
          <p>Yet men first used the distaff, and the wheel, <lb n="1390"/>
            Ere learned the female race ; since males throughout <pb n="449"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V. <lb/>
            </note>Prove prompter far, more dexterous, and expert; <lb/>
            Till the rough swain, at length,such labours mocked <lb/>
            As sole the woman’s province, sterner toils <lb/>
            The man's rude strength demanding, hardier arts <lb n="1395"/>
            His form to harden, nerved with double force.</p>
          <p>But Nature's self th' untutored race first taught <lb/>
            To sow, to graft; for acorns ripe they saw, <lb/>
            And purple berries, shattered from the trees, <lb/>
            Soon yield a lineage like the trees themselves. <lb n="1400"/>
            Whence learned they, curious, through the stem mature <lb/>
            To thrust the tender slip, and o'er the soil <lb/>
            Plant the fresh shoots that first disordered sprang.</p>
          <p>Then, too, new cultures tried they, and, with joy, <lb/>
            Marked the boon earth, by ceaseless care caressed, <lb n="1405"/>
            Each barbarous fruitage sweeten and subdue. <lb/>
            So loftier still and loftier up the hills <lb/>
            Drove they the woodlands daily, broadening thus <lb/>
            The cultured foreground, that the sight might trace <lb/>
            Meads, corn-fields, rivers, lakes, and vineyards gay, <lb n="1410"/>
            O'er hills and mountains thrown; while through the dales, <lb/>
            The downs, the slopes, ran lavish and distinct <lb/>
            The purple realm of olives; as with hues <lb/>
            Distinct, though various still the landscape swells <lb/>
            Where blooms the dulcet apple, mid the tufts <lb n="1415"/>
            Of trees diverse that blend their joyous shades.</p>
          <p>And from the liquid warblings of the birds <lb/>
            Learned they their first rude notes, ere music yet <lb/>
            To the rapt ear had tuned the measured verse; <lb/>
            And ZEPHYR, whispering through the hollow reeds, <lb n="1420"/>
            Taught the first swains the hollow reeds to sound: <lb/>
            Whence woke they soon those tender-trembling tonea <lb/>
            Which the sweet pipe, when by the fingers prest, <lb/>
            Pours o'er the hills, the vales, and woodlands wild, <lb/>
            Haunts of lone shepherds, and the rural gods. <lb n="1425"/>
            So growing time points, ceaseless, something new. <lb/>
            And human skill evolves it into day.</p>
          <p>Thus soothed they every care, with music, thus, <lb/>
            Closed every meal, for rests the bosom then. <lb/>
            And oft they threw them on the velvet grass, <lb n="1430"/>
            Near gliding streams, by shadowy trees o’er-arched, <lb/>
            And void of costly wealth found still the means <note type="footnote"> 2 G </note> <pb n="450"/>

            </note>To gladden life. But chief when genial Spring <lb/>
            Led forth her laughing train, and the young year <lb/>
            Painted the meads with roseate flowers profuse- <lb n="1435"/>
            Then mirth, and wit, and wiles, and frolic, chief, <lb/>
            Flowed from the heart; ,for then the rustic muse <lb/>
            Warmest inspired them : then lascivious sport <lb/>
            Taught round their heads, their shoulders, taught to twine <lb/>
            Foliage, and flowers, and garlands richly dight; <lb n="1440"/>
            To loose, innumerous time their limbs to move, <lb/>
            And beat, with sturdy foot, maternal earth; <lb/>
            While many a smile, and many a laughter loud, <lb/>
            Told all was new, and wondrous much esteemed. <lb/>
            Thus wakeful lived they, cheating of its rest <lb n="1445"/>
            The drowsy midnight; with the jocund dance <lb/>
            Mixing gay converse, madrigals, and strains <lb/>
            Run o'er the reeds with broad recumbent lip: <lb/>
            As, wakeful still, our revellers through night <lb/>
            Lead on their defter dance to time precise; <lb n="1450"/>
            Yet cull not costlier sweets, with all their art, <lb/>
            Than the rude offspring earth in woodlands bore.</p>
          <p>Thus what first strikes us, while ourselves as yet <lb/>
            Know nought superior, every charm combines, <lb/>
            But when aught else of ampler boast succeeds <lb n="1455"/>
            We slight the former, every wish transferred. <lb/>
            Thus acorns soon disgusted ; the coarse couch <lb/>
            Of herbs and leaves was banished, and the hides <lb/>
            Of savage beasts deemed barbarous, and uncouth. <lb/>
            Yet the vast envy such these first inspired <lb n="1460"/>
            Their earliest wearer by the faithless crowd <lb/>
            Fell, and the garb, ferocious fought for still, <lb/>
            Rent into tatters, perished void of use.</p>
          <p>Then man for skins contended: purple now <lb/>
            And gold for ever plunge him into war; <lb n="1465"/>
            Far slenderer pretext! for, such skins without, <lb/>
            Thenaked throngs had dreaded every blast: <lb/>
            But us no ills can menace, though deprived <lb/>
            Of purple woof brocaded stiff with gold, <lb/>
            While humbler vests still proffer their defence. <lb n="1470"/>
            Yet vainly, vainly toil earth's restless tribes, <lb/>
            With fruitless cares corroding every hour; <lb/>
            Untaught the lust of wishing where to bound, <lb/>

          <p>But, through the heavens, the wakeful sun and moon <lb/>
            Driving, meanwhile, their radiant cars sublime, <lb/>
            Taught first to mortals how the seasons rolled, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Now many a fort they reared, and into shares <lb/>

            And state with state in social compact joined: <lb/>
            While rising bards, the types of sound just traced, <lb n="1485"/>
            Stamped each exploit, and told to times unborn. <lb/>
            Whence nought of earlier date, as facts precise, <lb/>
            Know we, alone by reason led to guess.</p>
          <p>Thus navigation, agriculture, arms, <lb/>

            Useful to life, or to the bosom dear, <lb/>

            First taught the blessings of the cultured field, <lb/>
            His life re-modelled, and with laws secured. <lb/>
            She, too, the soul's sweet solaces first oped <lb/>

          <p>For when he saw with what vast ease mankind <lb/>

             <note type="margin">BOOK VI <lb/>
            </note>How wealth full oft o’verflowed them with its tide, <lb n="10"/>
            How honours thronged on honours, and a race <lb/>
            With every virtue gifted, round them rose, <lb/>
            While still their hearts beat anxious, and their minds <lb/>
            Raged with complaints, vexations, and alarms,- <lb n="15"/>
            Then deemed the sage the mental vase itself <lb/>
            Unsound throughout; despoiling, hence, the power <lb/>
            Of all that entered, useful or beloved; <lb/>
            Fractured, perchance, or porous, and each boon <lb/>
            Wasting profuse the moment it arrived; <lb n="20"/>
            Or, from innate corruption, all received <lb/>
            Poisoning perpetual through its total frame.</p>
          <p>With truth-instilling precepts, hence, the soul <lb/>
            Purged he, the bounds of wishing and of fear <lb/>
            Pointed precise, and showed to mortal man <lb n="25"/>
            The good supreme his heart would fain possess. <lb/>
            He oped its essence, he the path disclosed, <lb/>
            Narrow, but straight, that leads us where it dwells. <lb/>
            He, too, evinced what ills on life must wait; <lb/>
            What casual spring, from nature what uprise, <lb n="30"/>
            At random roaming, or by fate compelled, <lb/>
            And how such ills the soul may best resist; <lb/>
            Nor sink, as frequent sinks the world, ingulfed <lb/>
            In boundless tides of turbulence and care. <lb/>
            For as the boy, when midnight veils the skies, <lb n="35"/>
            Trembles and starts at all things, so full oft <lb/>
            E'en in the noon men start at things as void <lb/>
            Of real danger as the phantoms false <lb/>
            By darkness conjured and the school-boy's dread. <lb/>
            A terror this the radiant darts of day <lb n="40"/>

            With sacred awe overwhelms him, and his soul <lb/>
            Bows to the dust; the cause of things concealed <lb/>
            Once from his vision, instant to the gods <lb n="55"/>
            All empire he transfers, all rule supreme, <lb/>
            And doubtful whence they spring, with headlong haste <lb/>
            Calls them the workmanship of powers divine. <lb/>
            For he who, justly, deems th* immortals live <lb/>
            Safe, and at ease, yet fluctuates in his mind <lb n="60"/>
            How things are swayed; how, chiefly, those discerned <lb/>
            In heaven sublime,-to superstition back <lb/>
            Lapses, and rears a tyrant host, and then <lb/>

            While yet himself nor knows what may be done, <lb n="65"/>

            Foretaste the heavenly vengeance that thou dread'st. <lb/>
            Not that the majesty of powers like these <lb/>
            Rage e'er can violate, or dire revenge <lb/>
            Rouse into action ; but that thou thyself <lb n="75"/>
            Hence thy own ease wilt shipwreck with the storms <lb/>

          <p>Such life the wisdom we propound rejects: <lb/>

            Where speeds its fury ? by what means empowered <lb n="90"/>

            Now the last limits of the path prescribed, <lb/>
            That the bright crown with plaudits I may claim.</p>
          <p>First the blue cope of heaven with thunder shakes <lb/>
            When, borne through ether, clouds with clouds contend <lb/>
            By winds adversely driven ; for nought of sound <lb n="100"/>
            Strikes us where pure the concave; but where thick <lb/>
            Clouds heaped o'er clouds, there, measured by their mass, <lb/>
            The deep-toned peal with broadening bellow rears.</p>
          <p>Then less compact their texture than the frame <lb/>
            Of wood or stone, while less diffused by far <lb n="105"/>
            Than the loose web of mists,or light-winged smoke. <lb/>
            For else, like those, plumb downward must they rush <lb/>
            With flight abrupt, or swift as these dissolve, <lb/>
            Powerless to buoy the measured hail or snow.</p>
          <p>Then, too, resound they through the sapphire vault, <lb n="110"/>
            As oft resound the flickering curtains drawn <lb/>
            O'er the thronged theatre from beam to beam. <lb/>
            And oft to fragments frittered by the blast, <lb/>
            Like crackling scrolls they rattle through the skies: <lb/>
            Whence peals the thunder, as the fluttering sheet <lb n="115"/>
            Of parchment crisp, or canvass broad unfurled, <lb/>
            Lashed by the tempest, and to tatters torn.</p>
          <p>And frequent the fierce clouds with front direct <lb/>
            Fight not, but jostle side-long, with the strife <lb/>
            Their total tracts abrading; whence the harsh, <lb n="120"/>
            The long-drawn murmur that the soul appals <lb/>
            Ere yet the full-mouthed clangour burst its bounds.</p>
          <p>Then things with thunder oft, perchance, may quake, <lb/>
            And heaven's high walls be shattered through their cope, <lb/>
            When air elastic, by capacious clouds <lb n="125"/>
            Absorbed redundant, once ferments abrupt, <lb/>
            Broadening their central hollows as it spreads, <lb/>
            And close their sides condensing, till, at length, <lb/>
            Rends the pent power its prison, and aloft <lb/>
            Roars o'er the world the repercussive shock. <lb n="130"/>
            Nor wondrous this, since, filled with vapour, e'en <lb/>
            The bursting bladder loud alike resounds.</p>
          <p>Oft, too, perchance, the bickering blast itself, <pb n="455"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Borne 'gainst the clouds direct, the crash creates: <lb/>
            For ragged oft in various shapes they fly, <lb n="135"/>
            Ramous and wavy, hence sonorous too; <lb/>
            As when the north-east whistles through the groves <lb/>
            The leaves all rustle, and the branches crack: <lb/>
            Or, haply else, the horizontal gust, <lb/>
            Urged on abrupt, may rend the cloud in twain. <lb n="140"/>
            For what its force here oft on earth we learn, <lb/>
            On earth where gentler, but where still its rage <lb/>
            Roots up the forest headlong from its base.</p>
          <p>Worked into billows, too, the clouds, at times, <lb/>
            Conflicting murmur as the torrent tide <lb n="145"/>
            Of streams or ocean by the tempest tost.</p>
          <p>Oft springs the roar, too, when from cloud to cloud <lb/>
            Darts the blue lightning sudden: these, if filled <lb/>
            With limpid vapour, instant the fierce flash <lb/>
            Quench with vast clamour, as the red-hot steel <lb n="150"/>
            Fresh from the forge wide hisses when the smith <lb/>
            Deep drowns its fury in the gelid pool.</p>
          <p>But if the cloud be sear, with blaze abrupt <lb/>
            Flames it sonorous; as, when blown by storms, <lb/>
            Fires the loose brand the laurel-crested hills, <lb n="155"/>
            Decrepitating loud, for louder nought <lb/>
            In conflagration crackles than the tree <lb/>
            Sacred to PHCEBUS on the DELPHIC mount.</p>
          <p>While not unfrequent may the din resound <lb/>
            From ice or hail-clouds, by the whizzing wind <lb n="160"/>
            Lashed till they fracture, and, with clattering crash, <lb/>
            Falls the dread avalanche, down dashed amain.</p>
          <p>But the blue lightningsprings from seeds of fire <lb/>
            With seeds conflicting mid the war of clouds. <lb/>
            As when the flint with flint, or steel, contends, <lb n="165"/>
            Swift flows the flash, and sparkles all around.</p>
          <p>Then earlier see we, too, the rushing blaze <lb/>
            Than hear the roar, since far the fluent films <lb/>
            Of sight move speedier than of laggard sound. <lb/>
            As, when the woodman fells some branch remote, <lb n="170"/>
            It drops conspicuous ere the bounding blow <lb/>
            Strike on the ear—so the keen lightning far <lb/>
            Anticipates the thunder, though alike <lb/>
            Reared from one cause, from one concussion reared. <pb n="456"/>

            </note>Or haply hence the winged lustre springs Trembling amid the tempest; that when air, <lb n="175"/>

            That hollow broadening, as already sung, <lb/>
            And close its sides condensing, the pent air <lb/>
            Heats from its motion ; as, from motion, heats <lb n="180"/>

            Drive thwart the welkin when the tempests rave; <lb/>
            Or climb the giddy cliff, and, e'en in calms, <lb/>
            View what vast loads, accumulated deep, <lb n="195"/>
            Roll, tire o'er tire, through ether; and thou, then, <lb/>
            Must own their magnitudes, and well may'st deem <lb/>
            What caves stupendous through such hanging rocks <lb/>
            Spread; what wild winds possess them, through the storm <lb/>
            Roaring amid their bondage, as, at night, <lb n="200"/>
            Roar through their dens, the savage beasts of prey. <lb/>
            How strive they stern, now here, now there convolved, <lb/>

            Springs the bright flame, the splendid hues evinced. <lb/>
            For from the sun such seeds the clouds must drink, <lb/>
            Poured down perpetual, or their rainbow skirts <lb/>
            No lustre e'er could redden. These when once <lb/>

            </note>Forth from their pores the radiant atoms start, <lb n="215"/>
            And wave the serpent-brandish through the skies.</p>
          <p>Thus springs the flash, too, when the filmy clouds <lb/>
            Abrade beneath the whirlwind: for, so thin <lb/>
            Wears oft their web by friction, the red seeds <lb n="220"/>
            Drop, unconfined, wide-glittering. But the blaze <lb/>
            Then noiseless spreads, innocuous, and serene.</p>
          <p>What next ensues, the substance what that forms <lb/>
            The bolt, at times, the mystic meteor shoots, <lb/>
            This its own stroke betrays, its caustic scathe, <lb n="225"/>
            And the foul scent of sulphur steaming round ; <lb/>
            Marks not of wind, or shower, but fire alone: <lb/>
            While, oft, the volant mischief we behold <lb/>

          <p>This igneous shaft, then, Nature rears, recluse, <lb n="230"/>
            From subtlest fires, from atoms most minute, <lb/>
            Vivacious most, that nought can e'er resist. <lb/>
            For e'en through walls it pierces, as the power <lb/>
            Of voice or sound, through rocks and solid brass; <lb/>
            The solid brass hence, instant, turned to stream. <lb n="235"/>
            While oft the vase it empties of its wine, <lb/>
            Yet leaves uninjured; loosening all around, <lb/>
            And wide each pore relaxing, that within <lb/>
            May wind its heat mysterious, and to seeds <lb/>
            Primal, resolve and scatter all contained. <lb n="240"/>
            Effect the solar lustre in an age <lb/>

            Whole towns to tumble, and their splintered beams <lb/>
            Whirl through the heavens,—the hero's tomb dispart, <lb/>

          <p>From dense, dark clouds reared mass o'er mass sublime, <lb/>

            Smiles all serene, or but o'ershadowed light, <lb/>
            Such ne'er we mark ; since daily ether first <lb n="255"/>

            Ere yet the tempest forge his glittering bolts. <lb n="260"/>
            </p>
          <p>Oft, too, o'er ocean, like a flood of pitch, <lb/>
            Some negro cloud prone rushes from the skies, <lb/>
            Dire leader of the darkness, followed close <lb/>

            With fire surcharged, and fierce fermenting air, <lb n="265"/>
            Driving appalled each mortal to his home. <lb/>
            Whence high through ether must the tempest reach, <lb/>
            Piled cloud o'er cloud, the sun obstructing deep, <lb/>
            Or ne'er such ten-fold darkness could be reared, <lb/>

          <p>These all with fires, with furious airs are filled, <lb/>
            Whence spring the flash, and repercussive roar. <lb/>
            For, as we erst have sung, full many a seed <lb/>
            Igneous, the hollow-bosomed clouds contain, <lb n="275"/>
            And many alike absorb they from the sun. <lb/>
            These, when th' aerial tide, expanding still, <lb/>
            Has from the cloud's condensing frame exprest, <lb/>
            And with their fury its own rage combined, <lb/>
            Then springs the fiery vortex, and within <lb n="280"/>
            Forges profound, and points its deadly darts. <lb/>
            Doubly enkindled, by the boisterous air <lb/>

            Then springs, and raves, and ripens, till, at length, <lb/>

            And down abrupt, with vibratory flash <lb/>
            Diffused o'er all things, flings the missile fate. <lb/>
            Roars next the deep-toned clangour, as though heaven <lb/>
            Through all its walls were shattered; earth below <lb/>
            Shakes with the mighty shock, from cloud to cloud <lb n="290"/>

            While, loosened by the conflict, prone descends <lb/>
            Th' accumulated torrent, broad and deep, <lb/>
            As though all ether into floods were turned, <lb/>
            And a new deluge menaced man and beast. <lb n="295"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Oft, too, th’ external whirlwind, as it flies, Against the cloud strikes sudden, that within <lb/>
            Holds the ripe tempest, and its form divides. <lb n="300"/>
            And, hence released, the fiery vortex quick, <lb/>
            The vivid bolt, descends, now here, now there, <lb/>
            In varying path, apportioned to its strength.</p>
          <p>And oft the gas projected, though at first <lb/>
            Void of combustion, in its course inflames, <lb n="305"/>
            Rapid and long ;forsaking, as it flies, <lb/>
            Its grosser atoms impotent of speed, <lb/>
            And, from th' abraded air, those more minute <lb/>
            Collecting, prompt th' incipient blaze to rouse. <lb/>
            As when,swift-winged, the ball of missile lead <lb n="310"/>

            Losing, and fires by atoms gained from air.</p>
          <p>Nor seldom may the stroke itself excite <lb/>
            The dread combustion, as with fury flies, <lb/>
            Void of all flash, the fulminating bolt. <lb n="315"/>
            For, from itself, the shock may seeds alike <lb/>
            Igneous elicit, and the substance struck,- <lb/>
            Instant combined; as, when with steel we ply <lb/>
            The sparry flint, the spark immediate springs, <lb/>
            Nor lingers sluggish from the steel's cold touch. <lb n="320"/>
            So by the bolt each substance struck must flame, <lb/>

            Flight that, if powerless of itself to fire, <lb n="325"/>

          <p>So speeds th' aerial shaft, its wing so fleet, <lb/>
            So fierce its fell encounter; mid the clouds <lb/>
            So wide its infant forces it collects, <lb/>
            And strives, impatient of restraint, t' escape! <lb n="330"/>
            Till, grown mature, the full-distended cloud <lb/>
            Bursts instantaneous, and, with matchless might, <lb/>
            Rushes the rampant meteor, as the storm <lb/>
            Of rocks and darts, from giant-engines hurled.</p>
          <p>Then too most light, most subtle are its seeds: <lb n="335"/>

            Direct in travel, and more potent far <lb/>
            Borne towards the spot that feels its final brunt.</p>

            Joined too, perchance, by atoms drawn from air <lb/>
            Whose ceaseless lash gave pinions to its speed.</p>
          <p>Then many a frame the missile bolt pervades, <lb/>

          <p>Hence, with much ease, the meteor may we trace <lb/>
            Termed, from its essence, PRESTER by the GREEKS, <lb n="435"/>
            That oft from heaven wide hovers o'er the deep. <lb/>
            Like a vast column, gradual from the skies, <lb/>
            Prone o'er the waves, descends it; the vext tide <lb/>
            Boiling amain beneath its mighty whirl, <lb/>
            And with destruction sure the stoutest ship <lb n="440"/>
            Threatening that dares the boisterous scene approach. <lb/>
            Thus solve th' appearance; that the maniac wind, <lb/>
            In cloud tempestuous pent, when unempowered <lb/>
            To burst its bondage, oft the cloud itself <lb/>
            Stretches cylindric, like a spiral tube <lb n="445"/>
            From heaven forced gradual downwards to the deep; <lb/>
            As though some viewless hand, its frame transpierced, <lb/>
            With outspread palm had thrust it from above. <lb/>
            This, when, at length, the captived tempest rends, <lb/>
            Forth flows it, fiery, o'er the main, and high <lb n="450"/>
            Boils from its base th' exaggerated tide. <lb/>
            For, as the cone descends, from every point <lb/>
            A dread tornado lashes it without, <lb/>
            In gyre perpetual, through its total fall: <lb/>
            Till, ocean gained, the congregated storm <lb n="455"/>
            Gives its full fury to th' uplifted waves, <lb/>
            Tortured, and torn, loud howling midst the fray.</p>
          <p>Oft, too, the whirlwind from the clouds around <lb/>
            Fritters some fragments, and itself involves <lb/>
            Deep in a cloudy pellicle, and close <lb n="460"/>
            Mimics the prester, lengthening slow from heaven; <pb n="463"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Till, earth attained, th' involving web abrupt <lb/>
            Bursts,and the whirlwind vomits and the storm. <lb/>
            Yet, as on earth the mountains' pointed tops <lb/>
            Break oft the texture, tubes like these, at land <lb n="465"/>
            Far rarer form than o'er the marble main.</p>
          <p>The rise of clouds next calls us. When in heaven <lb/>
            Meet various bodies subtile and sublimed, <lb/>
            Of jagged figure, instant they cohere; <lb/>
            Not strong the junction, but cohesive still. <lb n="470"/>
            Thus spring the lighter clouds; and these conjoined, <lb/>
            Comprest, condensed, and congregated close, <lb/>
            Urged by the winds, to boundless bulk augment, <lb/>
            Till broad o'er ether frowns the finished storm.</p>
          <p>Chief o'er the mountain-tops, as nearest heaven, <lb n="475"/>
            In tide perpetual smoke the yellow steams <lb/>
            That clouds engender, here conspicuous first. <lb/>
            For, undiscerned at birth, the winnowing wind <lb/>
            Here in huge masses, palpable to view, <lb/>
            Dense, and redundant, drives them, whence aloft <lb n="480"/>
            Mount they embodied from the humid height. <lb/>
            For fact itself demonstrates, as we climb <lb/>
            The tall, steep cliff, that breezy scenes like these <lb/>
            Ope the best path for vapours to the skies.</p>
          <p>Then from the seas that nature much selects <lb n="485"/>
            Prove the light garments fluttering o'er the strand <lb/>
            That catch the rising moisture; doubtless whence <lb/>
            Much, too, the clouds from ocean's restless brine <lb/>
            Draw ceaseless forth, their airy base to build: <lb/>
            For, as the blood, so fluids all transpire. <lb n="490"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus from each river, e'en from earth itself, <lb/>
            We trace th' ascending moisture, and the mist, <lb/>
            Like vital breath, borne upwards: which, when once <lb/>
            Firmly condensed, and congregated close, <lb/>
            Veil all the heavens with clouds, and darkness deep; <lb n="495"/>
            While tides of rushing ether closer still <lb/>
            Drive the light woof, and weave a thicker shade.</p>
          <p>Then, too, perchance, the primal seeds of things, <lb/>
            Borne from without, the mingled mass may join, <lb/>
            And swell the cloudy drapery. These how wide <lb n="500"/>
            Diffused through space, how countless their amount, <lb/>
            With what vast speed, what instantaneous flight <lb/>

            That storms, and blackness, gendered e'en above, <lb n="505"/>
            Should oft abrupt o'er mountains, plains, and seas <lb/>
            Of amplest breadth, their dreary mantle stretch ; <lb/>
            Since through all ether's nice, innumerous pores, <lb/>
            O'er the wide world like spiracles bespread, <lb/>

            Water and cloud, and all that cloud contains, <lb/>
            As with its frame augments the vital blood, <lb/>
            Or aught besides of moisture through the limbs. <lb/>
            Then, too, the cloudy floscules, as they fly <lb/>
            O'er the broad main, the briny dew imbibe, <lb n="520"/>
            As pendant fleeces from the new-shorn flock. <lb/>
            While from each stream, alike, their spongy webs <lb/>
            Drink the light moisture ; which, when once comprest, <lb/>
            Atom with atom, in innumerous modes, <lb/>
            Innumerous masses, the redundant clouds, <lb n="525"/>
            Prest by the winds, strive doubly to discharge: <lb/>
            For, while such pressure bursts them, their own weight, <lb/>
            Cloud thronged o'er cloud, compels the falling shower.</p>
          <p>Then, too, abraded by the winnowing winds, <lb/>
            Or by the sun relaxed, the cloudy film <lb n="530"/>
            Pours down its moisture, as the strainer thick <lb/>
            Of woof redoubled, near the solvent fire, <lb/>

            But fierce the torrent falls when fierce at once <lb/>

            </note>Ceaseless reflects, and rears the gaudy bow.</p>
          <p>Thus all, through heaven, that forms or floats sublime, <lb/>
            Or in the clouds concretes, wind, hail, and snows, <lb n="546"/>
            And hoary pearl, and frost's stupendous power, <lb/>
            Stern hardener of the waters, the restraint <lb/>
            That chains the rivers panting to be free, <lb/>
            These all the mind may hence, with ease, unfold; <lb n="550"/>
            Their rise develope, why created solve, <lb/>
            Taught by the seeds that form their various frames.</p>
          <p>Next learn the cause why earth's firm frame, at times, <lb/>
            Quakes wide around. And, first, conceive her shaped <lb/>
            Below as upwards ; filled with roaring winds, <lb n="555"/>
            Fissures, and caverns, crags, and pools profound, <lb/>
            And fractured rocks, through all her bosom spread: <lb/>
            While, mid her hollows, boundless rivers roll, <lb/>
            Wave after wave, and hide their secret heads : <lb/>
            For fact itself proves earth throughout the same. <lb n="560"/>
            </p>
          <p>These truths premised, earth trembles, then, profound, <lb/>
            Shook into ruins, when the rage of time, <lb/>
            Deep down the caves immensely scooped below, <lb/>
            Tumbles th' incumbent hills ; abrupt they fall <lb/>
            With vast concussion, while, from scene to scene, <lb n="565"/>
            Winds the dread tremour, propagated quick: <lb/>
            And well may wind ; since e'en the sluggish wain, <lb/>
            Though filled but half, as o'er the street it rolls, <lb/>
            Shakes every mansion; since, alike disturbed, <lb/>
            Quake they when, near, the light aerial car <lb n="570"/>
            Drawn by fleet coursers whirls its rattling wheels.</p>
          <p>Earth trembles, too, when, undermined by age, <lb/>
            Wide into lakes of boundless breadth beneath <lb/>
            Th' incumbent glebe sinks sudden, her vast shell <lb/>
            By the deep dash far staggered, as the bowl <lb n="575"/>
            Reels, filled with fluid, when its fluid rocks.</p>
          <p>And when the winds, that oft her hollows crowd, <lb/>
            Rush all collected, with fermenting force, <lb/>
            Towards one vext quarter,-where the fight prevails <lb/>
            Earth nods o'erpowered; each building reared above <lb n="580"/>
            Totters throughout, while those of loftier height <lb/>
            Dread instant ruin, their connecting beams <lb/>
            Disjointed, torn, and tumbling from their posts. <lb/>
            And shrink mankind, then, from the creed that soon <note type="footnote">2 H </note> <pb n="466"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Some ruthless conflict the wide world itself <lb n="585"/>
            Shall crush with wreck unbounded-while they see <lb/>
            Earth shook so largely through her inmost mass ? <lb/>
            E’en now, should ne'er such winds their rage relax, <lb/>
            Their boisterous ferment, nought of power opposed <lb/>
            Could stem th' assault, and instant fate must flow. <lb n="590"/>
            But as, by turns, these labour, and forbear, <lb/>
            Now firm advance, and now, exhausted, fly, <lb/>
            Earth ofter far is menaced than destroyed. <lb/>
            For, from her centre thrown, she straight returns. <lb/>
            Confirms her balance, and her course resumes; <lb n="595"/>
            While, mid the shock, each building reels; the high <lb/>
            Most, less the low, the lowliest least of all.</p>
          <p>Hence, too, the mighty tremour: that when wind, <lb/>
            Or air elastic, into tumult worked, <lb/>
            Upreared within, or entering from above, <lb n="600"/>
            Still towards one point of earth's vast caverns pours, <lb/>
            Whirled in wild vortex, its enormous force <lb/>
            At length bursts sudden—and the solid soil <lb/>
            Fractures amain, with broad tremendous yawn. <lb/>
            Such SYRIAN SIDON saw, and ÆGIUMsuch, <lb n="605"/>
            Pride of MOREAN plains. What earthquakes dire, <lb/>
            What towns overthrown has this disruption sole <lb/>
            Of frantic air engendered ! what vast walls <lb/>
            Have tumbled from their base ! what peopled ports <lb/>
            Deep down the main in common ruin sunk ! <lb n="610"/>
            E'en should th' elastic vapour the stern soil <lb/>
            Cleave not abrupt, yet, issuing through its pores, <lb/>
            Earth trembles still, with quivering horror shook, <lb/>
            As shakes the frame, through every limb convulsed, <lb/>
            When cold severe assaults us unprepared. <lb n="615"/>
            A twofold terror, then, mankind appals ; <lb/>
            Above, the buildings menace, and, below, <lb/>
            The shuddering ground threats instant into depths <lb/>
            Boundless to sink, or ope its giant jaws <lb/>
            And, in a moment, swallow all that lives. <lb n="620"/>
            E'en those who hold that heaven and earth exist <lb/>
            Each incorrupt, and of eternal date, <lb/>
            Touched by the present danger, then betray <lb/>
            Strong latent dread lest earth forsake their feet, <lb/>

          <p>Next why the main overflows not let us solve. <lb/>
            And, first, man wondrous deems it the hoarse fall <lb/>
            Of mountain cataracts, the ceaseless press <lb n="630"/>
            Of streams innumerous from innumerous points, <lb/>
            Year after year, its limits never swell. <lb/>
            Yet add to these whate'er from heaven descends <lb/>
            In showers and tempests, scattered wide alike <lb/>
            O'er earth and ocean, every fountain add, <lb n="635"/>
            And still the vast accumulated mass, <lb/>
            Weighed with the deep, would scarce a drop exceed. <lb/>
            Whence nought stupendous that it ne'er augments.</p>
          <p>Next, daily, much the solar heat exhales. <lb/>
            For as the sun o'er humid garments pours <lb n="640"/>
            His beams profuse, with instant haste they dry. <lb/>
            But broad and spacious spreads the liquid main ; <lb/>
            Whence, from each spot though small the lymph absorbed, <lb/>
            Yet large th' amount its total surface yields.</p>
          <p>Then, too, the flickering winds with ceaseless wing <lb n="645"/>
            Winnow an ample portion. Such their power <lb/>
            Oft, in a night, the swampiest paths they cleanse, <lb/>
            Brush off the wet, and harden all the mire.</p>
          <p>And earlier have we taught that every cloud <lb/>
            Imbibes, luxurious, the redundant dew <lb n="650"/>
            Raised from the face of ocean ; and o'er earth, <lb/>
            Lashed by the breeze, in copious showers distils.</p>
          <p>And as this mass terrene of frame consists <lb/>
            Porous throughout, and with a thousand coasts <lb/>
            Girds all the deep-since to the deep it sends, <lb n="655"/>
            In part, its fluids, doubtless so, alike, <lb/>
            Part still retreats, and, percolated pure, <lb/>
            Fresh bubbles distant at some fountain-head. <lb/>
            Whence winds again the dulcet tide through paths <lb/>
            Its liquid feet have printed oft before.<lb n="660"/>
            </p>
          <p>Now next explain we whence, from ÆTNA’S jaws, <lb/>
            Bursts the bright storm of wild projectile fire ; <lb/>
            Storm that, once kindled o'er SICILIANS plains, <lb/>
            Raves with no common ruin, as around <lb/>
            From many a realm the general eye it draws, <lb n="665"/>

            </note>Wondering, beneath the dingy-flaring cope, <lb/>

            And long expatiate o'er their separate parts; <lb n="670"/>
            Recall the doctrine that th' ENTIRE OF THINGS <lb/>
            Throughout is boundless; and how small, reflect, <lb/>
            One system sole when with th' ENTIRE compared <lb/>

          <p>Who strange conceives it that this mortal frame <lb/>

            Here nought lurks wondrous: for from various seeds <lb n="685"/>
            Spring they, contest, in various modes combined; <lb/>
            While heaven and earth alone such seeds adverse <lb/>
            Amply supply to rear the tyrant ill.— <lb/>
            Deem, then, alike, that heaven and earth themselves <lb/>

            For heaven thus blazes from the seeds of fire <lb/>

            And, first, the mighty mount is scooped throughout. <lb/>

            </note>Fill all its caves, for agitated air <lb/>
            To wind converts, resistless in its might. <lb/>
            This, when once heated, and its torrid breath <lb n="710"/>
            Has heated, too, the mingled mass around <lb/>
            Of rocks, and earths sulphureous, and a flood <lb/>
            Of frantic flame engendered—bursts abrupt, <lb/>
            And, through the mountain's monster-jaws, ejects <lb/>
            Towards every point its embers, and its blaze; <lb n="715"/>
            Belches whole atmospheres of smoke, and high <lb/>
            Hurls from its base huge crags of weight immense. <lb/>
            To air incensed such wonders, all, resolve.</p>
          <p>Then to the main, too, spreads th' enormous hill <lb/>
            Its roots profound, the rough, rebellowing surge <lb n="720"/>
            Baffling at each encounter: for thus far <lb/>
            Doubtless extend its glimmering halls, and hence <lb/>
            Draws it, at times, fresh stores of maddening wind; <lb/>
            An ampler storm hence brewing, and its flames, <lb/>
            Its rocks, its sands projecting wider still: <lb n="725"/>
            While, at its top, the whirlwind craters throng, <lb/>
            By us termed aptly its voracious jaws. <lb/>
            Thus many a cause we bring; for many a cause <lb/>
            Oft it behoves us, though but one subsist. <lb/>
            As when, at distance, some dead corse thou view'st <lb n="730"/>

            Sole stream on earth its boundaries that o'erflows <lb/>
            Punctual, and scatters plenty. When the year <lb/>

            First bubbling, distant, o'er the burning line.</p>
          <p>Then ocean, haply, by th' undevious breeze <lb/>

            Now full matured, with deep dissolving ray <lb/>
            May melt th' agglomerate snows, and down the plains <lb n="765"/>
            Drive them, augmenting, hence, th' incipient stream.</p>
          <p>But come, th' AVERNI beckon; and the muse <lb/>
            Their nature, next, their depths, their lakes shall pierce.</p>
          <p>And first, their name from power adverse to birds <lb/>

          <p>Such the dread gulf at CUMÆ, belching high <lb/>
            Fumes of hot sulphur o'er the mountains round. <lb/>
            Such, too, at ATHENS, deep within her walls, <lb/>
            Steams from the tower, MINERVA'S temple near ; <lb/>
            Where never raven, e'en when victims smoke <lb n="780"/>
            O'er the red altar, shows his jetty plumes. <lb/>
            Yet not restrained, as GRECIAN poets sing, <lb/>
            By wrath of PALLAS o'er the tell-tale spy <lb/>
            Profusely lavished, but the place alone. <lb/>
            Such place in SYRIA, too, as fame reports, <lb n="785"/>
            The traveller traces, o'er whose dire domains <lb/>
            The brute that treads drops instant, as though felled <lb/>
            In prompt oblation to th' infernal powers.</p>
          <p>These all subsist from Nature's general laws, <pb n="471"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>And whence their source their earliest rise unfolds <lb n="790"/>
            Lest we should judge them the first gates of hell, <lb/>
            And through such portals deem th' infernal gods <lb/>
            Draw the pale spirit to the shades below; <lb/>
            As, with their breath, the foot-winged deer, 'tis said, <lb/>
            Draw from the furze the spotted race of snakes; <lb n="795"/>
            A creed how false our numbers now shall prove.</p>
          <p>First we maintain, then, and have earlier oft <lb/>
            Maintained the same, that Nature's primal seeds <lb/>
            In shape wide vary, whence the frame of things <lb/>
            Much holds nutritious, baneful much, and big <lb n="800"/>
            With certain fate; while different foods, to kinds <lb/>
            Different themselves, an ampler nurture yield, <lb/>
            As reared with bond, with texture reared unlike. <lb/>
            This have we erst decided. Sounds abhorred <lb/>
            Wound the vext ear; the shuddering nostrils drink <lb n="805"/>
            Oft atoms harsh and hateful to their smell; <lb/>
            Nor fewer far the bodies touch rejects; <lb/>
            Hostile to sight, or grievous to the taste.</p>
          <p>Then, too, how frequent things with power adverse, <lb/>
            Noxious to life, e'en man himself oppress. <lb n="810"/>
            Thus there are trees whose shade malignant strikes <lb/>
            With instant head-ache all, in idle hour, <lb/>
            Who loosely throw them on the grass beneath. <lb/>
            While some, o'er HELICON, a blossom bear <lb/>
            Of scent so deadly, few the smell survive. <lb n="815"/>
            These spring from earth ; for earth within her holds <lb/>
            Innumerous seeds of things innumerous, joined <lb/>
            In countless modes, and yields them as they blend.</p>
          <p>The midnight taper, as its dying snuff <lb/>
            Pours o'er the nostrils, stupifies with sleep <lb n="820"/>
            Deep as, the brain, when apoplexy numbs. <lb/>
            So stupid swoons the maid, too, who in hour <lb/>
            Of full, overflowing nature, castor gross <lb/>
            Scents, floating round; and from her graceful hands <lb/>
            Drops, loosely drops the polished work she plies. <lb n="825"/>
            </p>
          <p>But endless are the substances that, thus, <lb/>
            Melt all the members, and the soul subvert. <lb/>
            If long thou loiter in the public bath, <lb/>
            Or bathe at home overloaded with repast, <lb/>
            Wilt thou not faint, unsinewed by the warmth ? <pb n="472"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>

            If from the brook we drink not ere they fail ? <lb/>
            While the foul gas, that from fermenting must <lb/>
            Springs, like a blow deep stuns us with its force.</p>
          <p>Then breeds not earth, imbedded in herself, <lb n="835"/>
            Bitumens, sulphurs, ever steaming forth <lb/>
            In dews malignant ? from the mines profound <lb/>
            Of gold, or silver, rise not such o'er those <lb/>
            Who delve, unblest, amid their rigid veins ? <lb/>
            What ills hence issue ! o'er the miner's limbs <lb n="840"/>
            What ghastly hues ! what horrors o'er his face! <lb/>
            Hast thou not heard how soon existence fails, <lb/>
            How languid life, mid wretches thus condemned ?- <lb/>
            These vapours all earth genders in herself, <lb/>
            And breathes through many an opening to the day. <lb n="845"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus breathe th' AVERNI through their openings dire <lb/>
            Fumes reared from earth, and fatal found to birds, <lb/>
            Tainting far round the heavenly breeze that blows. <lb/>
            Here, as the plumy people first approach, <lb/>
            The fluent bane arrests them, and below <lb n="850"/>
            Deep plunges headlong down th' envenomed gulf, <lb/>
            Where their last pulse soon fails through every limb. <lb/>
            A wontless thrill, a giddiness of brain <lb/>
            First feel they, falling, till, profounder sunk, <lb/>
            Life flows amain, since more condensed th' assault. <lb n="855"/>
            </p>
          <p>Then, too, perchance th' AVERNI may, at times, <lb/>
            With deadly blast the total air dissolve, <lb/>
            Full nigh to vacuum, 'twixt the flutterer spread <lb/>
            And earth beneath; whence, once the spot attained, <lb/>
            Vain prove his wings, each utmost effort vain <lb n="860"/>
            To prop the parent body : robbed abrupt <lb/>
            Of buoyant ether, powerless, and forlorn, <lb/>
            Down, like a weight, he tumbles through the void, <lb/>
            And from each pore his airy soul exhales.</p>
          <p>In wells profound the gurgling lymph that springs, <lb n="865"/>
            Springs chilliest in the summer :-for all earth <lb/>
            Expands beneath the sun-beams, and emits <lb/>
            The seeds of fire far prompter to the day: <lb/>
            Whence more her surface burns with heat evolved, <lb/>
            And colder flows the fountain deep-concealed. <lb n="870"/>
            While, mid the wintry frosts, her frame contracts, <lb/>

            </note>Condenses closer, and, condensing, strains <lb/>
            the fiery atoms into caves and wells.</p>
          <p>A fount, 'tis rumoured, near the temple purls <lb/>
            Of JOVE AMMONIAN, tepid through the night, <lb n="875"/>
            And cold at noon-day: and th' astounded sage <lb/>
            Stares at the fact, and deems the punctual sun <lb/>
            Strikes through the world's vast centre, as the shades <lb/>
            Of midnight shroud us, and with ray reverse <lb/>
            Maddens the well-spring:—creed absurd and false. <lb n="880"/>
            For if, full blazing o'er the naked tide, <lb/>
            Poured from above in fierce meridian might, <lb/>
            No heat he gender-how can his deep orb <lb/>
            Flame through earth's solid substance, and the lymph <lb/>
            Lash into fervour ? how-since e'en at noon <lb n="885"/>
            Scarce can his rage the cottage wall transpierce ?</p>
          <p>Dost thou the cause demand, then ? clearly hence. <lb/>
            That round the fountain earth more spongy spreads <lb/>
            And seeds of fire throng ampler; whence, when night <lb/>
            Pours o'er the world his dew-distilling shades, <lb n="890"/>
            The chilled, contracting soil here strains abrupt, <lb/>
            As though comprest by fingers, towards the fount <lb/>
            Such seeds profusely, and the bubbling wave <lb/>
            Proves to the touch, the taste more tepid proves. <lb/>
            But when, reversed, the sun with new-born beam <lb n="895"/>
            Earth rarefies, and quickens, back profound <lb/>
            Fly the young fire-seeds to their native haunts, <lb/>
            The fount forsaking; whence the sparkling tide <lb/>
            Tastes in the day more frigid than at night.</p>
          <p>Then, too, the crystal fluid, by the sun <lb n="900"/>
            Thrilled, deep dilates beneath his trembling ray, <lb/>
            And yields its embryo fires ; as, when congealed, <lb/>
            Yields it alike its frost beneath the blaze, <lb/>
            Melts all its ice, and every bondage bursts.</p>
          <p>A fount there is, too, which, though cold itself, <lb n="905"/>
            With instant flare the casual flax inflames <lb/>
            Thrown o'er its surface; and the buoyant torch <lb/>
            Kindles alike immediate, o'er its pool <lb/>
            Steering the course th' ethereal breeze propels. <lb/>
            Nor wondrous this; for countless seeds of heat <lb n="910"/>
            Throng through the water, raised from earth profound, <lb/>
            And thence, in turn, projected into air <pb n="474"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Yet ne'er so active as the wave to warm.</p>
          <p>Some latent energy the seeds, moreover, <lb/>
            Thus scattered, forces to the water's brim <lb n="915"/>
            Sudden, and there concentrates; as, at times, <lb/>
            Springs the fresh fount amid th* unbounded main, <lb/>
            And drives the brine broad circling as it flows. <lb/>
            Nor thus unfrequent to the thirsty crew <lb/>
            Does bounteous nature ope the dulcet draught, <lb n="920"/>
            High-spouting freshness through the world of salt. <lb/>
            So through the well-spring that the flax inflames <lb/>
            Burst forth the lurking fire-seeds to the day, <lb/>
            Commingling with its fibres; which achieved, <lb/>
            Or with the torch once blended, all is blaze; <lb n="925"/>
            Themselves alike high-charged with latent fire.</p>
          <p>When, just extinct, the taper we apply <lb/>
            To one full blazing, seest thou not how soon, <lb/>
            E'en ere it touch, th' extinguished snuff relumes ? <lb/>
            Relumes not thus the torch, too ? and alike <lb n="930"/>
            Full many a substance, useless to recount, <lb/>
            At distance kindled ere the flame arrive ? <lb/>
            acts the fountain, such the cause concealed.</p>
          <p>And next explain we by what curious law <lb/>
            The stone termed MAGNET by the GREEKS, attracts <lb n="935"/>
            Th' obsequious iron; magnet termed since first <lb/>
            Mid the MAGNETES men its power descried.</p>
          <p>Vast is the wonder, mid th' admiring crowd, <lb/>
            This stone excites; for oft a pendant chain <lb/>
            Forms it of rings unlinked and loosely joined.<lb n="940"/>
            And frequent see they, sporting in the breeze, <lb/>
            Such rings quintupled, in succession long, <lb/>
            The lowlier cleaving to the sphere above, <lb/>
            And this to that, proclaiming, as it hangs, <lb/>
            Its deep-felt conscience of the magnet's power. <lb n="945"/>
            Such the resistless energy it boasts.</p>
          <p>In facts like these full many a truth profound <lb/>
            First must we prove, ere yet their power thou trace, <lb/>
            And many a maze unravel ;-thou with heed <lb/>
            List, then, for now thy closest ear we claim. <lb n="950"/>
            </p>
          <p>And, first, from all things bodies most minute <lb/>
            Flow forth for ever, scattered, and diffused, <lb/>
            Wounding the pupil, and compelling sight. <pb n="475"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>From forms defined spring odours ; from the sun <lb/>
            Thus heat exhales ; cold, dewy damp from streams, <lb n="955"/>
            And the rough spray from ocean, with fierce fang <lb/>
            Gnawing the mound that dares resist its waves. <lb/>
            Thus sounds, too, flutter through the breezy air; <lb/>
            And when the beach we traverse, oft the tongue <lb/>
            Smarts with the briny vapour; or, at hand, <lb n="960"/>
            If the bruised wormwood yield its acrid juice, <lb/>
            We taste th' essential bitter and abhor. <lb/>
            Thus some light effluence streams from all create, <lb/>
            Streams forth for ever, void of dull repose, <lb/>
            Towards every point diffused; for man perceives, <lb n="965"/>
            Where'er his station ; sight alike exists, <lb/>
            The sense of fluent odours, and of sounds.</p>
          <p>This thus premised, recall we next to mind <lb/>
            How rare the frame of all things, as erewhile <lb/>
            Conspicuous proved we in our earliest strain. <lb n="970"/>
            A theme, though ever useful, useful most <lb/>
            Found, when compelled, as now, to re-affirm <lb/>
            That nought exists but matter mixt with void.</p>
          <p>For, first, the roofs of rocky caverns sweat <lb/>
            With dews, and crystals; and the frame of man <lb n="975"/>
            Throws through each pore the perspirable lymph. <lb/>
            Beard through the visage permeates, through each limb <lb/>
            Peeps the young down, and every meal imbibed <lb/>
            Flows through the veins profuse, and feeds, augments, <lb/>
            And quickens all things e'en to th' utmost nails. <lb n="980"/>
            Cold the tense brass, and heat alike transpierce: <lb/>
            So pierce they gold, and silver, as the vase <lb/>
            Proves, filled with fluids by the fingers clasped. <lb/>
            Through the stone wall voice winds its sinuous way, <lb/>
            And frosts, and odours, and the power of heat: <lb n="985"/>
            Heat that pervades e'en steel, and through the helm <lb/>
            Rushes, where rests it round the fretted neck. <lb/>
            So rushes, too, contagion from without <lb/>
            Deep through each quivering organ. The red storm <lb/>
            In heaven engendered pierces earth profound ;<lb n="990"/>
            Or, if in earth it ripen, heaven above <lb/>
            Shakes with the shock through all its shattering walls. <lb/>
            For nought combines through nature void of pores.</p>
          <p>Then not unvarying in exterior shape <pb n="476"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>All atoms flow from all things; nor alike <lb n="995"/>
            On all things act they, with effect unchanged.</p>
          <p>The beam that barns and dries the moistened earth, <lb/>
            Fluxes the frost, o'er mountains piled sublime <lb/>
            Rolls, in loose tide, the macerated snows, <lb/>
            And with its effluence melts th' adhesive wax. <lb n="1000"/>
            Fire fuses gold and copper, but contracts <lb/>
            The flesh of beeves and shrivels their tough hides. <lb/>
            Red from the flame, steel hardens in the pool, <lb/>
            But hides and flesh relax. The bearded goat <lb/>
            On the wild olive most luxurious feasts, <lb n="1005"/>
            Deems it all nectar, all ambrosia deems, <lb/>
            While nought so hateful to the mouth of man. <lb/>
            Swine fly perfumes, sweet marjoram is death, <lb/>
            Scents that, with us, the spirit oft revive. <lb/>
            While the gross slough, mere filth among ourselves, <lb n="1010"/>
            To them proves cleanliness; and deep within <lb/>
            Plunge they, all joyous mid its miry waves.</p>
          <p>This, too, the muse should notice ere we yet <lb/>
            Full on the magnet enter; that, as things <lb/>
            Oft various classes hold of pores within, <lb n="1015"/>
            Each class from each must differ, and a breadth, <lb/>
            A shape possess, appropriate to itself. <lb/>
            For many a sense each vital tribe endows, <lb/>
            Various, empowered as various parts t' achieve <lb/>
            And mark its proper objects as they rise. <lb n="1020"/>
            Thus sounds by one assail us, this conveys <lb/>
            Taste from each juice, and streams of odour that. <lb/>
            So the firm stone some substances transpierce, <lb/>
            Some wood, some gold, some silver, crystal some, <lb/>
            Heat those pervading, the light image this. <lb n="1025"/>
            And thus through all things different objects rush <lb/>
            With ease far different; nature to their forms, <lb/>
            Their powers diverse, as long anterior proved, <lb/>
            Th' appropriate duct adapting most exact.</p>
          <p>These axioms thus premised, then, and maintained, <lb n="1030"/>
            All else flows obvious, and the total cause <lb/>
            Unfolds spontaneous that the steel compels.</p>
          <p>First, from the magnet countless atoms stream <lb/>
            In tide perpetual, chasing the mid air <lb/>
            Twixt the stern iron placed, and stone itself. <pb n="477"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>This space once emptied, and a total void <lb n="1035"/>
            Formed broad between, abrupt the seeds of steel, <lb/>
            Thrown forth alike, usurp it, close conjoined, <lb/>
            Dragging the ring resistless as they rush. <lb/>
            For nought exists with primal seeds more harled, <lb n="1040"/>
            More clinched, more tangled in commutual bonds <lb/>
            Than the cold steel, all horror to the touch. <lb/>
            Whence wondrous less the doctrine thus announced, <lb/>
            That from the steel those atoms ne'er can part, <lb/>
            Urged through the vacuum, but the ring succeeds: <lb n="1045"/>
            Abrupt succeeds it, gains the stone abrupt, <lb/>
            And fixt and firm in mystic league coheres. <lb/>
            So flies it, too, towards every point alike, <lb/>
            Borne upwards, or transverse, where'er the void <lb/>
            Spreads round the magnet, following, in its course, <lb n="1050"/>
            The seeds that nearest touch the vacant sphere, <lb/>
            Themselves hence foremost prest from strife within, <lb/>
            And powerless, else, through ether e'er t' ascend.</p>
          <p>Hence, too, the ring draws pinions in its flight: <lb/>
            That as, at once, secedes th' anterior air, <lb n="1055"/>
            And forms the void, th' elastic tide behind <lb/>
            Drives it, perpetual plying at its back. <lb/>
            For air encircles all things ; but alone <lb/>
            Can act coercive, and the steel protrude, <lb/>
            When first the momentary void exists, <lb n="1060"/>
            Opes its pure passage, and admits it free. <lb/>
            Then potent acts it; through the total ring, <lb/>
            Through every pore, its puny atoms darts, <lb/>
            Chasing the steel as winds the bark impel.</p>
          <p>Then air, moreover, whatever exists, within <lb n="1065"/>
            Holds, doubtless ; since of tenuous frame composed, <lb/>
            And by surrounding air for ever lashed. <lb/>
            Whence air through iron roves, too, deep-concealed, <lb/>
            Ceaseless in action, and the docile ring <lb/>
            Plies with internal tempest, doubly hence <lb n="1070"/>
            Borne towards the void where centres all its aim;</p>
          <p>Armed with new speed, new succour for the flight. <lb/>
            Oft from the magnet, too, the steel recedes, <lb/>
            Repelled by turns, and re-attracted close.</p>
          <p>And oft in brazen vessels may we mark <lb n="1075"/>
            Ringlets of SAMOTHRACE, or fragments fine <pb n="478"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Struck from the valid iron, bounding high <lb/>
            When close below the magnet points its powers. <lb/>
            So vast th' aversion, e'en the brass beneath, <lb/>
            Feel they at times ; the discord such induced. <lb n="1080"/>
            Thou thus resolve the problem : that the brass <lb/>
            First throws, as nearest, its attenuate breath, <lb/>
            And fills the pores of iron ; which when, next, <lb/>
            The stream magnetic reaches, it in vain <lb/>
            Toils to transpierce, each avenue possest. <lb n="1085"/>
            Checked in its course, with wave perpetual, hence, <lb/>
            The rings, the raspings beats it, and above <lb/>
            Far off repulses, else embracing strong.</p>
          <p>Nor strange conceive it the magnetic stream <lb/>
            Nought drives besides: for powers there are resist, <lb n="1090"/>
            Like the firm gold, confiding in their weight; <lb/>
            While some a frame so loose present and rare <lb/>
            The rushing vapour permeates, void of touch. <lb/>
            Such frame all timbers offer. But the steel <lb/>
            Springs 'twixt the two: and hence, when through its pores <lb/>
            Clogged with the brass effluvium, the full flood <lb n="1096"/>
            Flung from the magnet dashes it sublime.</p>
          <p>Nor are such unions through created things <lb/>
            Discerned unfrequent, nor severe the task <lb/>
            To point affinities of equal strength. <lb n="1100"/>

          <p>Lime only stones connects ; the strong steer-glue <lb/>

            The closest-textured table through its veins <lb/>
            Will easier sever than the glue desist.</p>
          <p>The vine's pure juice in close alliance dares <lb n="1105"/>
            League with the fountain; while the ponderous pitch <lb/>
            The light-winged oil refuses. With the fleece <lb/>
            The purple murex so minutely blends <lb/>
            Nought e'er can part them: no-though e'en thou toil <lb/>
            Day after day with all great NEPTUNE'S waves: <lb n="1110"/>
            No-his whole sea the stain would ne'er wash out.</p>
          <p>One cement sole with gold concentrates gold, <lb/>
            And nought but pewter brass with brass unites.</p>
          <p>Such facts how numerous ! but why more recite ? <lb/>
            To thee 'twere labour useless, and perplext; <lb n="1115"/>
            And. to the muse unjust; for much remains, <lb/>

            </note>Where things once fit with textures reared reverse, <lb/>

            Responds to this, alternate, they combine <lb n="1120"/>
            With firmest junction: but combine they, too, <lb/>
            Oft as though hooks and ringlets formed the bond: <lb/>
            And thus, perchance, the magnet meets the steel.</p>
          <p>Now whence diseases rise, the morbid power <lb/>
            What, that, once gendered, spreads its baneful blast <lb n="1125"/>
            O'er man's pale offspring, and the brutal throngs, <lb/>
            Next will we sing. Already hast thou heard <lb/>
            That seeds exist, from many a substance flung, <lb/>
            To life salubrious, yet, too oft, reversed, <lb/>
            Noxious, and big with death. When spring the last <lb n="1130"/>
            Through heaven full flocking, all the vital air <lb/>
            Sickens immediate, through its texture changed. <lb/>
            And thus full flock they, their pestiferous power <lb/>
            Fanning around them, from intrinsic birth <lb/>
            In heaven itself begot as mists or clouds; <lb n="1135"/>
            Or breathed from earth, when once her soddened soil <lb/>
            Ferments corrupted, plied by ceaseless rains <lb/>
            Untimely poured, and hot succeeding suns.</p>
          <p>Seest thou not, oft, the restless crowds that rove <lb/>
            Far from their homes, their countries, tried severe <lb n="1140"/>
            With the new stream they drink, the heaven inhale ? <lb/>
            From the dread change such sickness sole results. <lb/>
            How wide must BRITAIN differ in her clime <lb/>
            From EGYPT'S tribes, o'er whom the northern pole <lb/>
            Gleams never! orient PONTUS, how, from those <lb n="1145"/>
            Far westward, scattered o'er the GADIAN isles, <lb/>
            Or the swart ETHIOP, blackening in his blaze! <lb/>
            And since the world's vast quarters, each from each, <lb/>
            As various heavens and atmospheres divide, <lb/>
            So man himself in tincture, face, and form <lb n="1150"/>
            Alike must vary, and disease sustained.</p>
          <p>High up the NILE, mid EGYPT'S central plains, <lb/>
            Springs the dread leprosy, and there alone. <lb/>
            Gout clogs the feet in ATTICA; the sight <lb/>
            Fails in ACHAIA :different regions, thus, <lb n="1155"/>
            With different organs wage eternal war, <lb/>
            As urged by atmospheres of frame unlike.</p>
          <p>But when the heaven, of poisonous power to us <pb n="480"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI <lb/>
            </note>First moves remote, its hostile effluence creeps <lb/>
            Slow, like a mist or vapour ; all around <lb n="1160"/>
            Transforming as it passes, till, at length, <lb/>
            Reached our own region, it the total scene <lb/>
            Taints, and assimilates, and loads with death.</p>
          <p>Abrupt then falls the new, pestiferous bane, <lb/>
            Broad o'er the fountains, or the food invades <lb n="1165"/>
            Of man, or beast, the pasture or the grain. <lb/>
            Or, haply, still along the breezy air <lb/>
            It floats commingled; whence, with every breath, <lb/>
            Drink we alike the poison through our veins. <lb/>
            And hence the murrain that assaults, at times, <lb n="1170"/>
            The lusty herd, the blight that thins our flecks. <lb/>
            Nor aught imports it whether, urged by gain, <lb/>
            We change the covering of the skies, and seek <lb/>
            Ourselves the noxious climate, or its breeze <lb/>
            Meet us spontaneous; or aught else assail <lb n="1175"/>
            Of nature new, and strange to every sense.</p>
          <p>A plague like this, a tempest big with fate, <lb/>
            Once ravaged ATHENS, and her sad domains ; <lb/>
            Unpeopled all her city, and her paths <lb/>
            Swept with destruction. For amid the realms <lb n="1180"/>
            Begot of EGYPT, many a mighty tract <lb/>
            Of ether traversed, many a flood o'erpast, <lb/>
            At length, here fixed it; o'er the hapless realm <lb/>
            Of CECROPS hovering, and th' astonished race <lb/>
            Dooming by thousands to disease and death. <lb n="1185"/>
            </p>
          <p>The head first flamed with inward heat; the eyes <lb/>
            Reddened with fire suffused; the purple jaws <lb/>
            Sweated with bloody ichor; ulcers foul <lb/>
            Crept o’e the vocal path, obstructing close; <lb/>
            And the prompt tongue, expounder of the mind, <lb n="1190"/>
            Overflowed with gore, enfeebled in its post, <lb/>
            Hoarse in its accent, harsh beneath the touch.</p>
          <p>And when the morbid effluence through the throat <lb/>
            Had reached the lungs, and filled the faltering heart, <lb/>
            Then all the powers of life were loosened; forth <lb n="1195"/>
            Crept the spent breath most fetid from the mouth, <lb/>
            As steams the putrid carcass: every power <lb/>
            Failed through the soul-the body-and alike <lb/>
            Lay they liquescent at the gates of death. <pb n="481"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>While with these dread, insufferable ills <lb n="1200"/>
            A restless anguish joined, companion close, <lb/>
            And sighs commixt with groans; and hiccough deep, <lb/>
            And keen convulsive twitchings ceaseless urged, <lb/>
            Day after day, o'er every tortured limb, <lb/>
            The wearied wretch still wearying with assault. <lb n="1205"/>
            </p>
          <p>Yet ne'er too hot the system could'st thou mark <lb/>
            Outwards, but rather tepid to the touch : <lb/>
            Tinged still with purple-dye, and brandished o'er <lb/>
            With trails of caustic ulcers, like the blaze <lb/>
            Of erysipelas. But all within <lb n="1210"/>
            Burned to the bone; the bosom heaved with flames <lb/>
            Fierce as a furnace, nor would once endure <lb/>
            The lightest vest thrown loosely o'er the limbs. <lb/>
            All to the winds, and many to the waves, <lb/>
            Careless, resigned them ; in the gelid stream <lb n="1215"/>
            Plunging their fiery bodies, to be cooled : <lb/>
            While some, wide-gasping, into wells profound <lb/>
            Rushed all abrupt; and such the red-hot thirst <lb/>
            Unquenchable that parched them, amplest showers <lb/>
            Seemed but as dew-drops to th' unsated tongue. <lb n="1220"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor e'er relaxed the sickness ; the racked frame <lb/>
            Lay all-exhausted, and, in silence dread, <lb/>
            Appalled, and doubtful, mused the HEALING ART. <lb/>
            For the broad eye-balls, burning with disease, <lb/>
            Rolled in full stare, for ever void of sleep, <lb n="1225"/>
            And told the pressing danger; nor alone <lb/>
            Told it, for many a kindred symptom thronged. <lb/>
            The mind's pure spirit, all despondent, raved; <lb/>
            The brow severe; the visage fierce and wild; <lb/>
            The ears distracted, filled with ceaseless sounds; <lb n="1230"/>
            Frequent the breath; or ponderous oft, and rare; <lb/>
            The neck with pearls bedewed of glistening sweat; <lb/>
            Scanty the spittle, thin, of saffron dye, <lb/>
            Salt, with hoarse cough scarce laboured from the throat. <lb/>
            The limbs each trembled; every tendon twitched <lb n="1235"/>
            Spread o'er the hands; and from the feet extreme <lb/>
            O'er all the frame a gradual coldness crept. <lb/>
            Then, towards the last, the nostrils close collapsed; <lb/>
            The nose acute; eyes hollow; temples scooped; <lb/>
            Frigid the skin, retracted; o'er the mouth <note type="footnote"> 2 1 </note> <pb n="482"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI <lb/>
            </note>A ghastly grin ; the shrivelled forehead tense; <lb n="1240"/>
            The limbs outstretched, for instant death prepared; <lb/>
            Till with the eighth descending sun, for few <lb/>
            Reached his ninth lustre, life for ever ceased.</p>
          <p>And though, at times, th' infected death escaped <lb n="1245"/>
            From sanious organs, or the lapse profuse <lb/>
            Of black-tinged feces, fate pursued them still. <lb/>
            Hectic and void of strength, consumption pale <lb/>
            Preyed on their vitals; or, with head-ache keen, <lb/>
            Oft from the nostrils tides of blood corrupt <lb n="1250"/>
            Poured unrestrained, and wasted them to shades.</p>
          <p>And, e'en o'er these triumphant, frequent still <lb/>
            Fixed the morbific matter on the limbs, <lb/>
            Or seized the genial organs; and to some <lb/>
            The grave so hideous, they consented life <lb n="1255"/>
            E'en with th' excision of their sexual powers <lb/>
            Dearly to ransom: some their being bought <lb/>
            By loss of feet or hands; and some escaped <lb/>
            Void of all vision; such their dread of death. <lb/>
            And in oblivion some so deep were drowned <lb n="1260"/>
            Themselves they knew not, nor their lives elapsed.</p>
          <p>And though, unburied, corse o'er corse the streets <lb/>
            Oft thronged promiscuous, still the plumy tribes, <lb/>
            The forest monsters, either far aloof <lb/>
            Kept, the foul stench repulsing, or if once <lb n="1265"/>
            Dared they the plunder, instant fate pursued.</p>
          <p>Nor feathery flocks at noon, nor beasts at night <lb/>
            Their native woods deserted; with the pest <lb/>
            Remote they languished, and full frequent died. <lb/>
            But chief the dog his generous strength resigned, <lb n="1270"/>
            Tainting the highways, while the ruthless bane <lb/>
            Through every limb his sickening spirit drove.</p>
          <p>With eager strife th' enormous grave was snatched, <lb/>
            By friends untended: nor was aught of cure <lb/>
            Discerned specific ; for what here recalled <lb n="1275"/>
            To day's bright regions the vanescent soul, <lb/>
            And gave the living ether to the lips, <lb/>
            Proved poison there, and ten-fold stamped the fate.</p>
          <p>But this the direst horror, that when once <lb/>
            Man felt th' infection, as though full forewarned <unclear/><lb n="1280"/>
             Of sure destruction, melancholy deep <pb n="483"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>Preyed o'er his heart, his total courage failed, <lb/>
            Death sole he looked for, and his doom was death.</p>
          <p>Thus seized the dread, unmitigated pest <lb/>
            Man after man, and day succeeding day, <lb n="1285"/>
            With taint voracious: like the herds they fell <lb/>
            Of bellowing beeves, or flocks of timorous sheep: <lb/>
            On funeral funeral hence for ever piled. <lb/>
            E'en he who fled th' afflicted, urged by love <lb/>
            Of life too fond, and trembling for his fate, <lb n="1290"/>
            Repented soon severely, and himself <lb/>
            Sunk in his guilty solitude, devoid <lb/>
            Of friends, of succour, hopeless, and forlorn. <lb/>
            While those who nursed them, to the pious task <lb/>
            Roused by their prayers, with piteous moans commixt, <lb n="1295"/>
            Fell irretrievable: the best, by far, <lb/>
            The worthiest, thus most frequent met their doom.</p>
          <p>From ceaseless sepulchres, where each with each <lb/>
            Vied in the duteous labour, they returned <lb/>
            Faint, sad, and weeping; and from grief alone <lb n="1300"/>
            Oft to their beds resistless were they driven. <lb/>
            Nor lived the mortal then, who ne'er was tried <lb/>
            With death, with sickness, or severest woe.</p>
          <p>Then the rude herdsman, shepherd, and the man <lb/>
            Of sturdiest strength, who drove the plough afield, <lb n="1305"/>
            Languished remote; and in their wretched cots <lb/>
            Sunk, the sad victims of disease and want: <lb/>
            O'er breathless sires their breathless offspring lay, <lb/>
            Or sires and mothers o'er the race they bore.</p>
          <p>Nor small the misery through the city oft <lb n="1310"/>
            That poured from distant hamlets; for in throngs <lb/>
            Full flocked the sickening peasants for relief <lb/>
            From every point diseased ; and every space, <lb/>
            And every building crowded; heightening hence <lb/>
            The rage of death, the hillocks of the dead. <lb n="1315"/>
            </p>
          <p>Some, parched with thirst, beneath th' eternal spout <lb/>
            Dropped of the public conduits ; in the stream <lb/>
            Wallowing unwearied, and its dulcet draught <lb/>
            Deep-drinking till they bursted. Staggering, some <lb/>
            Threw o'er the highways, an:! the streets they trod, <lb n="1320"/>
            Their languid limbs; already half extinct, <lb/>
            Horrid with fetor, stiff with blotches foul, <note type="footnote"> 212 </note> <pb n="484"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI. <lb/>
            </note>With rags obscene scarce covered; o'er the bones <lb/>
            Skin only, nought but skin; and drowned alike <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>At length the temples of the gods themselves, <lb/>
            Changed into charnels, and their sacred shrines <lb/>
            Thronged with the dead: for superstition now, <lb/>
            The power of altars, half their sway had lost, <lb/>
            Whelmed in the pressure of the present woe. <lb n="1330"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor longer now the costly rites prevailed <lb/>

          <p>Soul. Opinions of the ancients about it <lb/>
            were various, but all was uncertainty, i. <lb/>
            113; Lucretius endeavours to settle the <lb/>
            nature of it, iii. 35 ; soul and mind so <lb/>
            intimately connected as to form one <lb/>
            substance, 137, 160; yet the soul is un­ <lb/>
            der the direction of the mind, iii. 140, <lb/>
            145; mind acts upon the soul, and the <lb/>
            soul upon the body, ib.; iii. 250; iv. <lb/>
            887; Lucretius refutes the doctrine of <lb/>
            those who thought the soul merely a <lb/>
            resulting harmony of the parts of the <lb/>
            body, iii. 98—136; soul and mind proved <lb/>
            to be alike corporeal, for they act and <lb/>
            are acted upon by touch, and sympathize <lb/>
            corporeally with the body, iii. 162—177; <lb/>
            consist of the very smallest atoms, iii. <lb/>
            180; their removal detracts nothing <lb/>
            perceptibly from the weight or size of <lb/>
            the body. iii. 209—231; soul and mind <lb/>
            consist of four substances,—heat, air, a <lb/>
            certain aura, and a fourth substance to <lb/>
            which Lucretius gives no name, iii. 232 <lb/>
            —288; origin of motion in the mind and <lb/>
            soul is from the fourth nameless sub­ <lb/>
            stance, iii. 246; mind and soul cannot <lb/>
            be separated from the body without de­ <lb/>
            struction to both, iii. 324—350; an <lb/>
            opinion of Democritus respecting the <lb/>
            soul refuted, iii. 371—396; soul has less <lb/>
            power in retaining life in the body than <lb/>
            the mind, iii. 397—417; soul proved a <lb/>

            a series of elaborate arguments, iii. 418 <lb/>
            —841; existence of the soul in the body <lb/>

            echoes, iv. 565—580;harshness and <lb/>
            sweetness in sounds proceed from the <lb/>
