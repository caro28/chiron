Ground truth files ("gold.*") in each folder differ from the ground truth used for LaBSE/LASER - Vecalign experiments. 

The gold.* files are all one-to-one or one-to-many, i.e. show matching translated sentences for every single source sentence.

The LaBSE/LASER Vecalign ground truth files reconstruct the chunk-level annotations available on Perseus. Thus they may be many-to-one or many-to-many as well.
