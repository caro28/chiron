          <p>1. THE following summer, the truce for a year 'continued <lb/>
            till the Pythian games, and then ended. During the suspension <lb/>
            of arms, the Athenians expelled the Delians from their island, <lb/>
            thinking that they had been consecrated when in a state of <lb/>
            impurity from some crime of ancient date ; and, moreover, that <lb/>
            this had been the deficiency in their former purification of it ; <lb/>
            in which case I have before explained that they considered <lb/>
            themselves to have performed it rightly by taking up the cof­ <lb/>
            fins of the dead. The Delians found a residence at Atramyt­ <lb/>
            tium in Asia, given to them by Pharnaces, as each of them <lb/>
            arrived there.</p>
          <p>2. After the armistice had expired, Cleon, having persuaded <lb/>
            - the Athenians to the measure, led an expedition against the <lb/>
            Thrace-ward towns, with twelve hundred heavy-armed, and <lb/>
            three hundred cavalry of the Athenians, a larger force of the <note type="footnote"> 1For the arguments with which Arnold establishes, as I think, this in­ <lb/>
            terpretation of the passage, see his Appendix. All the later German editors <lb/>
            adopt, with little or no variety, the view of Heilmann, Böckh, and others, <lb/>
            who suppose it to mean, that " in the following summer the truce was <lb/>
            Broken, and war renewed until the time of the Pythian games." In addi­ <lb/>
            tion to what Arnold has observed respecting the unsuitableness of the plu­ <lb/>
            perfect tense to such a mode of interpretation, it may be remarked that <lb/>
            Thucydides applies the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἐκεχειϱίϰν</foreign> to the year's truce in the last <lb/>
            chapter but one of the preceding book; and therefore it is much more na­ <lb/>
            tural that the same armistice should be intended by the same term in this <lb/>
            and the following chapters. It seems evident too that there is an opposition <lb/>
            expressed by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέν</foreign> here and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign> in the first line of the next chapter :­ <lb/>
            the one sentence stating how long the truce continued, viz. until the Py­ <lb/>
            thian games, and the other, what military measure was first executed after <lb/>
            its expiration; while the chief event which occurred during its continuance <lb/>
            is mentioned parenthetically between the two. Nor, again, does it seem at <lb/>
            all like the style of Thucydides to allude so cursorily, and by anticipation, to <lb/>
            the Pytluan games, as the cause which put a final stop to hostilities, and to <lb/>
            make no subsequent mention of them at all in what would be the natural <lb/>
            place for doing so; but to lead his readers to conclude that the proposals for <lb/>
            peace originated solely in the difficulties of both the great belligerent powers, <lb/>
            and their natural anxiety to be released from them; which is the sum and <lb/>
            substance of his history from chap. 13 to 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="310"/>
             <note type="margin">[3. <lb/>
            </note>allies, and thirty ships. After landing in the first place at <lb/>
            Scione, which was still being besieged, and taking thence some <lb/>
            heavy-armed from the garrison, he sailed into the port of the <lb/>
            Colophonians, belonging to the Toronæans, and at no great <lb/>
            distance from their city. Thence, having learned from de­ <lb/>
            serters both that Brasidas was not in Torone, and that those <lb/>
            who were in it were not strong enough to give him battle, <lb/>
            with his land forces he marched against the city, while he sent <lb/>
            ten ships to sail round into the harbour. First, then, he came <lb/>
            to the fortifications which Brasidas had raised anew round <lb/>
            the city, from a wish to include the suburb, and so by taking <lb/>
            down a part of the original wall had made it one city.</p>
          <p>3. Pasitelidas, the Lacedæmonian commander, and the gar­ <lb/>
            rison that was there, went to the defence of the fortifications, <lb/>
            and tried to resist the assault of the Athenians. When they <lb/>
            were being driven in, and the ships that had been sent round <lb/>
            were at the same time sailing into the harbour, Pasitelidas, <lb/>
            fearing that the ships might find the city deserted by its de­ <lb/>
            fenders before he could reach it, and that if the fortifications <lb/>
            were carried he might be made prisoner in them, left <lb/>
            them, and ran into the city. But the Athenians from the <lb/>
            ships had had time to take Torone, and their land forces, rush­ <lb/>
            ing after him, on the very first assault burst in with him <lb/>
            through the part of the old wall that had been removed. And <lb/>
            thus some of the Peloponnesians and Toronæans they slew <lb/>
            immediately in close combat, and others they took alive, with <lb/>
            Pasitelidas the commander. Now Brasidas was coming to the <lb/>
            relief of Torone ; but hearing of its capture while on his way, <lb/>
            he went back again, having been but forty stades short of <lb/>
            arriving in time. Cleon and the Athenians erected two tro­ <lb/>
            phies, one by the harbor, the other near the fortifications; <lb/>
            and sold into slavery the women and children of the Toronæ­ <lb/>
            ans, while the men themselves, with the Peloponnesians, and <lb/>
            whatever Chalcidians there were besides, seven hundred in <lb/>
            all, they sent off to Athens ; whence some of them afterwards <lb/>
            were dismissed, on conclusion of peace, while others were re­ <lb/>
            covered by the Olynthians, through an exchange of prisoners. <lb/>
            About the same time, too, the Bœotians took by treachery <lb/>
            Panactum, a fortress of the Athenians on the borders. Cleon, <lb/>
            after establishing a garrison in Torone, weighed anchor, and <lb/>
            sailed round Athos on his way to Amphipolis. <pb n="311"/>
             <note type="margin">4. 5.] </note></p>
          <p>4. About this same time, Phæax, son of Erasistratus, with <lb/>
            two colleagues, being commissioned by the Athenians, sailed <lb/>
            with two ships as ambassador to Italy and Sicily. For on <lb/>
            the departure of the Athenians from Sicily after the pacifica­ <lb/>
            tion, the Leontines had enrolled a large number of new <lb/>
            citizens, and the commons were thinking of dividing the land. <lb/>
            When the aristocratical party were aware of it, they called in <lb/>
            the Syracusans, and expelled the commons; who wandered <lb/>
            about as they severally happened; while the nobles entered <lb/>
            into an arrangement with the Syracusans, and having aban­ <lb/>
            doned and laid waste their own city, lived at Syracuse with <lb/>
            the enjoyment of the franchise. Afterwards some of them, <lb/>
            in consequence of not being pleased, withdrew from Syracuse, <lb/>
            and occupied a quarter of the city of Leontini, called I noceæ, <lb/>
            and Bricinniae, which was a stronghold in the Leontine coun­ <lb/>
            try. There the majority of the popular party who had been <lb/>
            expelled, came to them, and having thus established them­ <lb/>
            selves, they carried on the war from the fortifications. The <lb/>
            Athenians, hearing this, despatched Phaeax, to try if by any <lb/>
            means they might persuade the allies they had there, and the <lb/>
            rest of the Sicilians if they could, to join in attacking the <lb/>
            Syracusans, on the strength of their gaining such additional <lb/>
            power, and thus might save the commons of Leontini. So <lb/>
            Phæax came, and prevailed on the Camarinæans and Agri­ <lb/>
            gentines ; but when the question was settled against him at <lb/>
            Gela, he did not then proceed to the others, as he found that <lb/>
            he should not prevail on them ; but having returned through <lb/>
            the country of the Sicels to Catana, and having Oil his route <lb/>
            also visited Bricinniæ, and encouraged its inhabitants, he <lb/>
            sailed back again.</p>
          <p>5. On his course to Sicily and return from it, he also com­ <lb/>
            municated with certain cities in Italy on the subject of friend­ <lb/>
            ship with the Athenians. He likewise fell in with the <lb/>
            Locrian settlers banished from Messana, who, after the pacifi­ <lb/>
            cation effected by the Sicilians, when the Messanians were <lb/>
            divided into factions, and one of them had invited the Locri­ <lb/>
            ans to their aid, had been sent out for that purpose; and so <lb/>
            Messana came into the hands of the Locrians for some time. <lb/>
            Phæax then, having fallen in with these men on their way <lb/>
            home, did them no harm, as proposals had been made to him <lb/>
            by the Locrians for coming to terms with the Athenians. <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="margin"> [6,7 </note> <lb/>
            For they were the only people of the allies who, when the <lb/>
            Sicilians were reconciled to each other, did not make pence <lb/>
            with the Athenians: nor would they have done it then, had <lb/>
            they not been pressed by hostilities with the Itonæans and <lb/>
            Melaeans, who lived on their borders, and were a colony from <lb/>
            them. So Phæax returned, and arrived at Athens some time <lb/>
            after.</p>
          <p>6. Now when Cleon, at the time we last mentioned him, <lb/>
            sailed round from Torone to go against Amphipolis, making <lb/>
            Eion the base of his operations, he assaulted Stagirus, a <lb/>
            colony of the Andrians, but without reducing it; but Galep­ <lb/>
            sus, the Thasian colony, he took by storm. And having sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to Perdiccas, that he might join him with an army <lb/>
            according to the terms of their alliance, and others into <lb/>
            Thrace, to Polles, the king of the Odomantians, who was to <lb/>
            bring as many Thracian mercenaries as he could, he himself <lb/>
            remained quiet in Eion, awaiting their arrival. On hearing <lb/>
            this, Brasidas, on his side also, took up an opposite position on <lb/>
            Cerdylium. This spot is in the Argilian country, being on <lb/>
            the high ground on the other side of the river, not far from the <lb/>
            city of Amphipolis ; and every thing was distinctly seen from <lb/>
            it; so that Cleon could not unobserved by him set out with <lb/>
            his army; as he expected him to do, and despising the numbers <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians to march up with the forces he had <lb/>
            with him against Amphipolis. At the same time he was get­ <lb/>
            ting ready fifteen hundred Thracian mercenaries, and was call­ <lb/>
            ing all the Edonians to his aid, both targeteers and cavalry; <lb/>
            and he had a thousand targeteers of the Myrcinians and Chal­ <lb/>
            cidians, in addition to those in Amphipolis. All his heavy- <lb/>
            armed force too was mustered, about two thousand in number, <lb/>
            and three hundred Grecian horse. With fifteen hundred of <lb/>
            these Brasidas stationed himself on Cerdylium, whilst the <lb/>
            rest were posted with Clearidas in Amphipolis.</p>
          <p>7. Cleon remained quiet for some time, but was then com­ <lb/>
            pelled to do what Brasidas had expected. For his soldiers <lb/>
            being annoyed at sitting still, and reflecting, with regard to <lb/>
            his command, against what skill and daring in the enemy, with <lb/>
            what ignorance and cowardice in himself it would be held, and <lb/>
            how unwillingly they had accompanied him from home, he per­ <lb/>
            ceived their murmurs ; and not wishing them to be exasperated <lb/>
            by remaining stationary in the same place, he broke up his <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="margin"> 8.] <lb/>
            </note>camp and led them forward. And 1 he adopted the same plan <lb/>
            as he had also succeeded with at Pylus, and therefore felt con­ <lb/>
            fident in his own discernment. For that any one would come <lb/>
            out against him to battle, he bad not so much as a thought; <lb/>
            but said that he was going up rather to see the place, and was <lb/>
            waiting for his more numerous forces; not for the purpose of <lb/>
            gaining a victory without any risk, should he be compelled to <lb/>
            engage, but of surrounding the city on all sides, and so taking <lb/>
            it by storm. Having come, therefore, and posted his army on <lb/>
            a strong hill in front of Amphipolis, he himself proceeded to <lb/>
            reconnoitre the lake formed by the Strymon, and what was <lb/>
            the position of the city on the side of Thrace. He thought <lb/>
            to retire, whenever he pleased, without a battle; for indeed <lb/>
            there was neither any one seen on the wall, nor did any one <lb/>
            come out through the gates, but they were all closed: so that <lb/>
            he even considered he had made a mistake in not having come <lb/>
            down with engines ; for he believed that in that case he might <lb/>
            have taken the city.</p>
          <p>8. Immediately that Brasidas saw the Athenians in mo­ <lb/>
            tion, he too went down from Cerdylium, and entered Amphi­ <lb/>
            polis. Now for any regular sally, and array of troops against <lb/>
            the Athenians, he made none; being afraid of his own re­ <lb/>
            sources, and considering them inferior to the enemy; not so <lb/>
            much in numbers, (for they were pretty nearly equal,) but in <lb/>
            character ; (for 2it was the flower of the Athenian force that <lb/>
            was in the field, and the best of the Lemnians and Im­ <lb/>
            brians;) but he prepared to attack them by means of a strata­ <lb/>
            gem. For if he showed the enemy his numbers, and the <note type="footnote"> 1 Or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ τρόπῳ</foreign> may be understood, as by Haack and Arnold, " of the <lb/>
            temper and habits of Cleon's mind." But the aorist tense of the verbs <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχρήσατο, ἐπίστευσε</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤλπισεν</foreign> seems intended to refer to the single fact <lb/>
            of his having adopted a particular plan, and his reasons for doing it, rather <lb/>
            than to a continued state of mind, which would rather take the imperfect. And <lb/>

              equipment of the troops with him, which was such as 1neces­ <lb/>

              and having put the rest under the command of Clearidas, he <lb/>
              purposed making a sudden attack on the Athenians before <lb/>
              they could retire; as he did not think that he should catch <lb/>
              them again so isolated, if once their reinforcements should <lb/>
              have joined them. Calling therefore all his soldiers together, <lb/>
              and wishing to encourage them and acquaint them with his <lb/>
              design, he spoke to the following effect:</p>
          <p>9. " Men of the Peloponnese, with regard to the character <lb/>
            of the country from which we are come, namely, that through <lb/>
            its bravery it has always been a free country, and that you <lb/>
            are Dorians about to engage with Ionians, to whom you are <lb/>
            habitually superior, let a brief declaration suffice. But with <lb/>
            regard to the present attack, I will explain in what way I <lb/>
            purpose making it; that the fact of your meeting the danger <lb/>
            in small divisions, and not in one body, may not cause a want <lb/>
            of courage by an appearance of weakness. For I conjecture <lb/>
            that it is through contempt of us, and their not expecting any <lb/>
            one to march out against them to battle, that the enemy went <lb/>
            up to their present position, and are now thinking nothing of <lb/>
            us, while, without any order, they are engaged in looking <lb/>
            about them. But whoever best observes such mistakes in his <lb/>
            opponents, and also plans his attack upon them 3with regard <lb/>
            to his own power, not so much in an open manner and in <note type="footnote"> I " <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκαίαν οὒσαν</foreign>,] i. e. not such as they would have wished, but such <lb/>

            regular battle-array, as with reference to his present advantage, <lb/>
            that man would be most successful. And those stratagems by <lb/>
            which one would most deceive his enemies, and benefit his <lb/>
            friends, have the highest reputation. While, then, they are <lb/>
            still unprepared, yet confident, and are thinking, from what I <lb/>
            see, of retiring rather than remaining; while their minds are <lb/>
            irresolute, and before their plans are more definitely arranged, <lb/>
            I will take my own division, and surprise them, if I can, by <lb/>
            falling at full speed on the centre of their forces. And <lb/>
            do you, Clearidas, afterwards, when you see me now charging, <lb/>
            and in all probability frightening them, take your division, <lb/>
            both the Amphipolitans and the other allies, and suddenly <lb/>
            opening the gates rush out against them, and make all haste to <lb/>
            close with them as quickly as possible. For we may expect <lb/>
            that in this way they will be most alarmed; since the force <lb/>
            which follows up an attack is more terrible to an enemy than <lb/>
            that which is already before him and engaged with him. And <lb/>
            do you be a brave man yourself, as it is natural that you <lb/>
            should, being a Spartan ; and do ye, allies, follow him courage­ <lb/>
            ously ; and consider that it is the proof of good soldiership to <lb/>
            to be willing, and to be alive to shame, and to obey your com­ <lb/>
            manders. Reflect, too, that on this day you either gain your <lb/>
            liberty, if you act bravely, and the title of confederates of the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians ; or are slaves of the Athenians-if you fare <lb/>
            as well as you possibly can, without being reduced to personal <lb/>
            bondage, or put to death-and incur a more galling slavery <lb/>
            than before, while you oppose the liberation of the rest of the <lb/>
            Greeks. Do not you, then, act as cowards, seeing for how <lb/>
            much you are struggling; and I will show you that I am not <lb/>
            better able to give advice to others, than to carry it out in <lb/>
            action myself."</p>
          <p>10. Having thus spoken, Brasidas himself prepared for <lb/>
            marching out, and posted the rest of the troops with Clearidas <lb/>
            at what were called the Thracian gates, to sally out after him, <lb/>
            a-; had been arranged. His descent from Cerdylium having <lb/>
            been observed, as also, his sacrificing, when he was in the city <lb/>
            -of which a view is commanded from the outside-near the <lb/>
            temple of Minerva, and his being occupied with these mea­ <lb/>
            sures, tidings were carried to Cleon (for he had gone forward <lb/>
            at the time to look about him) that the enemy's whole force <lb/>
            was visible in the city; and that under the gates were observed <pb n="316"/>
            <note type="margin"> [10 </note> <lb/>
            many feet of horses and men, as though prepared to make a <lb/>
            sally. On receiving this intelligence he came up to the spot; <lb/>
            and when he saw that it was so, not wishing to come to a de­ <lb/>
            cisive engagement before his reinforcements also had arrived, <lb/>
            and thinking that he should have time to retire, he at once <lb/>
            gave orders for the signal to march back, and sent word to the <lb/>
            troops on the retreat to draw off in the direction of Eion, <lb/>
            moving on their left wing; which indeed was the only way <lb/>
            they could. But when he thought there was a dilatoriness <lb/>
            on their part, he himself made the right wing turn round, and <lb/>
            presenting their exposed side to the enemy, began to lead off <lb/>
            his troops. Upon this, Brasidas, marking his opportunity, and <lb/>
            seeing that the Athenian force was on the move, says to his <lb/>
            own company and the rest: " The men are not disposed to <lb/>
            wait for us, as is evident by the motion of their spears and of <lb/>
            their heads ; for those who have this going on amongst them <lb/>
            do not generally receive the charge of their assailants. So <lb/>
            then let somebody throw open for me the gates I have men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and let us march out against them as quickly as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, and with good courage." He, accordingly, sallied out <lb/>
            by the gates near the stockade, the first in the long wall <lb/>
            which was then standing, and ran full speed along the high <lb/>
            road, where the trophy now stands, as you go by the strongest <lb/>
            part of the position ; and falling on the Athenians, who were <lb/>
            both terrified by their own disorder and confounded by his <lb/>
            boldness, in the centre of their forces, he put them to the rout. <lb/>
            Clearidas too, as had been arranged, sallied out after him by <lb/>
            the Thracian gates, and rushed upon the enemy's troops. The <lb/>
            consequence was, that by this unexpected and sudden charge <lb/>
            on both sides, the enemy were thrown into confusion ; and their <lb/>
            left wing, on the side of Eion, which had already advanced <lb/>
            some distance, immediately broke away and fled. When it was <lb/>
            now on its retreat, Brasidas, in advancing along to attack the <lb/>
            right wing, received a wound ; and while the Athenians did not <lb/>
            observe his fall, those who were near him took him up, and <lb/>
            carried him off the field. The right of the Athenians, how­ <lb/>
            ever, stood its ground better; and though Cleon, who from <lb/>
            the first had no intention of making a stand, immediately fled, <lb/>
            and was overtaken and killed by a Myrcinian targeteer, his <lb/>
            heavy-armed retreated in a close body to the hill, and re­ <lb/>
            pulsed the charge of Clearidas twice or thrice, and did not <pb n="317"/>
            <note type="margin"> 11, 21] </note> <lb/>
            give way till the Myrcinian and Chalcidian horse, with the <lb/>
            targeteers, having surrounded them, and pouring their missiles <lb/>
            upon them, put them to the rout. And so now the whole <lb/>
            army of the Athenians, flying with great difficulty, and taking <lb/>
            many different roads over the mountains, effected their return <lb/>
            to Eion; excepting such as were killed either in the immedi­ <lb/>
            ate action, or by the Chalcidian horse and the targeteers. <lb/>
            Those who had taken up and rescued Brasidas, carried him <lb/>
            still breathing into the city; where he lived to hear that his <lb/>
            troops were victorious, but after a short interval expired. <lb/>
            The rest of the army, on returning with Clearidas from the <lb/>
            pursuit, stripped the dead, and erected a trophy.</p>
          <p>11. After this all the allies attended in arms, and interred <lb/>
            Brasidas at the public expense in the city, in front of the pre. <lb/>
            sent market-place. And ever since the Amphipolitans, having <lb/>
            enclosed his tomb with a fence, have made offerings to him as <lb/>
            to a hero, and have given him the honour of games and annua <lb/>
            sacrifices. They also referred the settlement to him as its <lb/>
            founder, demolishing the buildings of Hagnon, and obliterating <lb/>
            whatever memorui of his founding the place was likely to re­ <lb/>
            main : for they considered that Brasidas had been their pre­ <lb/>
            server ; and at the present time too, through fear of the <lb/>
            Athenians, they courted the Lacedæmonian confederacy; while, <lb/>
            on the other hand, they thought that Hagnon, in consequence <lb/>
            of their hostility towards the Athenians, would not retain his <lb/>
            honours either so beneficially or so agreeably to them. The <lb/>
            dead they restored to the Athenians. There were killed, of <lb/>
            the Athenians, about six hundred ; of their adversaries, only <lb/>
            seven ; because the battle was not fought with any regular order, <lb/>
            but was rather brought on by such an accidental occurrence <lb/>
            and previous alarm as has been described. After taking up <lb/>
            their dead, the Athenians sailed away home ; while Clearidas <lb/>
            and his party proceeded to settle matters about Amphipolis.</p>
          <p>12. About the same time, towards the close of the summer, <lb/>
            Ramphias, Autocharidas, and Epicydidas, Lacedæmonians, led <lb/>
            a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy-armed to the Thrace­ <lb/>
            ward towns, and on their arrival at Heraclea in Trachinia <lb/>
            arranged whatever appeared to them not to be on a good <lb/>
            footing. While they thus prolonged their stay in the place, <lb/>
            this battle of Amphipolis happened to be fought; and so the <lb/>
            summer ended. <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="margin"> [13, 14. </note> </p>
          <p>13. The following winter, Ramphias and his companions <lb/>
            immediately passed through the country as far as Pierius in <lb/>
            Thessaly; but as the Thessalians forbad their advance, and as <lb/>
            Brasidas, moreover, was dead, to whom they were leading the <lb/>
            force, they turned back home ; thinking the time for action <lb/>
            had gone by ; as both the Athenians had departed in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of their defeat, and they were not competent to execute <lb/>
            any of his designs. But, most of all, they returned because <lb/>
            they knew that the Lacedæmonians, at the time of their setting <lb/>
            out, were more strongly disposed for peace.</p>
          <p>14. It happened too, immediately after the battle of Am­ <lb/>
            phipolis and the retreat of Ramphias from Thessaly, that nei­ <lb/>
            ther party any longer applied themselves at all to the war, <lb/>
            but they were rather inclined for peace. The Athenians were <lb/>
            so, as having received a severe blow at Delium, and again <lb/>
            shortly after at Amphipolis; and as no longer having that con­ <lb/>
            fident hope in their strength, through which they would not <lb/>
            before accept the offered treaty, thinking, in consequence of <lb/>
            their present success, that they should come off victorious in <lb/>
            the struggle. Besides, they were also afraid of their allies, <lb/>
            lest they should be encouraged by their reverses to revolt on <lb/>
            a larger scale ; and they repented not having come to an ar­ <lb/>
            rangement, when they had a fine opportunity, after the events. <lb/>
            at Pylus. The Lacedæmonians, on the other hand, wished <lb/>
            for peace, because they found protracted beyond their expect­ <lb/>
            ation those hostilities by which they imagined that in a few <lb/>
            years they should reduce the power of the Athenians, if they <lb/>
            ravaged their land; and because they had met with the dis­ <lb/>
            aster on the island-sUch as had never yet befallen Sparta: <lb/>
            and in consequence of their country being plundered from <lb/>
            Pylus and Cythera ; while their helots also were deserting, <lb/>
            and there was a constant apprehension lest even those that re­ <lb/>
            mained in the country, trusting in the support of those who <lb/>
            were out of it, should, on the strength of the present state of <lb/>
            things, adopt some revolutionary designs against them, as on <lb/>
            former occasion. It happened, too, that their thirty years' <lb/>
            truce with the Argives was on the point of expiring, and the <lb/>
            Argives would not renew it, unless the Cynurian territory <lb/>
            were restored to them ; so that it appeared impossible for <lb/>
            them to carry on war at once with the Argives and Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. Besides, they suspected that some of the states in the <pb n="319"/>
             <note type="margin">15, 16.] </note> <lb/>
            Peloponnese would revolt from them to the Argives; as waa <lb/>
            really the case.</p>
          <p>15. On these considerations both parties thought it beet to <lb/>
            conclude the arrangement; and particularly the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans, through the desire of recovering their men taken in the <lb/>
            island ; for those of them who were Spartans were of the <lb/>
            highest rank,' and connected with themselves in the same <lb/>
            way. They began therefore to negotiate immediately after <lb/>
            their capture ; but the Athenians, being so successful, would <lb/>
            not yet make peace on fair terms. When, however, they had <lb/>
            been defeated at Delium, immediately the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            finding that they would now be more ready to accept their <lb/>
            proposals, concluded the armistice for a year, during which they <lb/>
            should meet together, and consult respecting a treaty for a <lb/>
            longer period.</p>
          <p>16. And when, moreover, the defeat at Amphipolis had be­ <lb/>
            fallen the Athenians, and Cleon and Brasidas were dead, who <lb/>
            on each side were most opposed to the cause of peace-the <lb/>
            one, because he was successful and honoured in consequence <lb/>
            of the war ; the other, because he thought, that if tranquillity <lb/>
            were secured, he would be more easily detected in his evil <lb/>
            practices, and less believed in his calumniations—then the in­ <lb/>
            dividuals who in either country were most desirous of taking <lb/>
            the lead, namely, Pleistoanax son of Pausanias, king of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and Nicias son of Niceratus, who of all his <lb/>
            contemporaries was most generally successful in his military <lb/>
            commands, were much more anxious for peace than ever. <lb/>
            Nicias was so, because he wished, while he had met with no <lb/>
            disaster, and was in high repute, permanently to secure his good <lb/>
            fortune ; and both at present to obtain a respite from troubles <lb/>
            himself and give his countrymen the same, and to hand down <lb/>
            to futurity a name for having continued to the end without <lb/>
            subjecting the state to any disaster ; and he thought that <lb/>
            such a result is secured by freedom from danger, and by a <lb/>
            man's committing himself as little as possible to fortune, and <lb/>
            that such freedom from danger is afforded by peace. Pleisto­ <lb/>
            anax, on the other hand, took the same view, because he wa <note type="footnote"> I ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομοίως</foreign>.] The meaning of this word Is considered very doubtful; but <lb/>

            calumniated by his enemies on the subject of his restoration, <lb/>
            and was continually being brought forward by them as the <lb/>
            object of religious scruple on the part of the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            whenever they met with any defeat; as though it were owing <lb/>
            to his illegal restoration that these things befell them. For <lb/>
            they charged him with having, in concert with Aristocles, his <lb/>
            brother, prevailed on the prophetess at Delphi to give the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing charge to such Lacedæmonians as went, during a long <lb/>
            period, to consult the oracle; " that they should bring back <lb/>
            the seed of the demigod son of Jupiter from a foreign land to <lb/>
            his own ; else they would 1 plough with a silver share." And <lb/>
            so they said that in the course of time, when he had gone as <lb/>
            an exile to Lycæum, (in consequence of his former return from <lb/>
            Attica, which was thought to have been effected by bribery,) <lb/>
            and had then, through fear of the Lacedæmonians, half his <lb/>
            house within the sanctuary of Jupiter, he induced them, in the <lb/>
            nineteenth year of his exile, to restore him with the same <lb/>
            dances and sacrifices as when they appointed their kings on <lb/>
            first settling in Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>17. Being annoyed therefore by this calumny, and thinking <lb/>
            that in time of peace, when no reverse was experienced, and <lb/>
            when, moreover, the Lacedæmonians were recovering their <lb/>
            men from the island, he too should give his enemies no handle <lb/>
            against him ; whereas, as long as there was war, the leading <lb/>
            men must always be exposed to accusations from the occurrence <lb/>
            of disasters; he was ardently desirous of the pacification. And <lb/>
            so during this winter they were meeting in conference; and <lb/>
            when it was now close upon spring, 2the terrors of an arma­ <lb/>
            ment, for which orders were sent round to the different states, <lb/>
            as though for the purpose of building forts, were held forth by <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, that the Athenians might the more readily <lb/>
            listen to them. And when, after these conferences had been <lb/>
            held, and they had urged many claims against each other, it <lb/>
            was agreed that they should make peace on restoring what <lb/>
            they had respectively taken during the war; but that the <lb/>
            Athenians should keep Nisaea ; (for on their demanding back <lb/>
            Platæa, the Thebans said that it was not by force that they <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. that owing to the scarcity of provisions, they would have to buy <lb/>

            selves having surrendered on definite terms, and not betrayed <lb/>
            it to them ; and the Athenians maintained that in the same <lb/>
            way had they got possession of Nisæa;) then the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians convened their allies; and when all the rest, except the <lb/>
            Bœotians, Corinthians, Eleans, and Megareans, who were dis­ <lb/>
            pleased with what was being done, had voted for putting an <lb/>
            end to the war, they concluded the arrangement, and made a <lb/>
            treaty and bound themselves by oaths to the Athenians, and <lb/>
            they to them, to the following effect:</p>
          <p>18. 1st, " The Athenians and Lacedæmonians, with their <lb/>

            ship of Alcæus at Athens, on the 25th of the month Elaphe­ <lb/>
            bolion. Those who took the oaths and subscribed the treaty <lb/>
            were as follows : on the side of the Lacedæmonians, [Pleisto­ <lb/>
            anax, Agis,j Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acan­ <lb/>
            thus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, <lb/>
            Tellis, Alcinidas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus: on the <lb/>
            side of the Athenians, Lampon, Isthmionicus, Nicias, Laches, <lb/>
            Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, <lb/>
            Thrasycles, Theogenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates. <lb/>
            Leon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes."</p>
          <p>20. This treaty was concluded at the end of the winter, <lb/>
            when the spring was commencing, immediately after the city­ <lb/>
            festival of Bacchus, when just ten years had elapsed, 1 with <lb/>
            the variation of a few days, since the invasion of Attica was <lb/>
            first made, and this war commenced. But let every one <lb/>
            regard this with reference to the periods of time, and not, as <lb/>
            placing greater confidence in such a view, with respect to the <lb/>
            enumeration of the public officers in the several places, or of <lb/>
            the titles derived from any honourable appointment which <lb/>
            serve to mark past events. For that gives no definite idea, as <lb/>
            to who were in the commencement of their office, or in the <lb/>
            middle of it, or whatever part it might be, when any event <lb/>
            occurred. But if he reckon by summers and winters, as I <lb/>
            have written my history, he will find 2that while each of <lb/>
            these amounts to half a year, there were ten summers and as <lb/>
            many winters included in this first war.</p>
          <p>21. Now the Lacedemonians (for it fell to their lot to be <lb/>
            the first to restore what they held) immediately released the <lb/>
            men who were prisoners in their country; and sending as <note type="footnote">the temple of Juno was said to be at Argos, Thucyd. IV. 133. 2, although it <lb/>

            ambassadors to the countries Thrace-ward, Ischagoras, Menas, <lb/>
            and Philocharidas, commanded Clearidas to restore Amphi­ <lb/>
            polis to the Athenians, and the rest of the states to accept the <lb/>
            treaty, as it had been severally arranged for them. They, <lb/>
            however, would not, as they thought it not favourable to <lb/>
            them; nor did Clearidas restore the city, wishing to oblige the <lb/>
            Chalcidians, and declaring that he could not give it up in op­ <lb/>
            position to them. He, however, went in haste to Lacedæmon <lb/>
            with ambassadors from that place, to defend himself, if Ischa­ <lb/>
            goras and his party should bring any charge against him for <lb/>
            not obeying; and at the same time from a wish to know <lb/>
            whether the arrangement might still be altered: but when he <lb/>
            found the treaty secured, being sent back again himself by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and ordered to deliver up the place, if possible, <lb/>
            but if not, to bring out all the Peloponnesians that were in it, <lb/>
            he set out with all speed.</p>
          <p>22. Now the allies happened 1themselves to be at Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon, and those of them who had not accepted the treaty <lb/>
            were commanded by the Lacedæmonians to adopt it. They, <lb/>
            however, on the same grounds as they had at first rejected it, <lb/>
            refused to accept it, unless they made a more equitable one <lb/>
            than that. So when they did not listen to them, they sent <lb/>
            them away, and themselves proceeded to conclude an alliance <lb/>
            with the Athenians; thinking that the Argives (2since they <lb/>
            refused, on Ampelidas and Lichas going to them, to make a <lb/>
            fresh treaty) would be by no means formidable without the <lb/>
            support of the Athenians, and that the rest of the Peloponnese <lb/>
            would be most disposed to remain quiet; whereas they would <lb/>
            have gone over to the Athenians, if they had had the power. <lb/>
            Ambassadors, therefore, having come from the Athenians, and <lb/>
            a conference having been held, they came to an agreement, <lb/>
            and oaths were taken, and this alliance concluded, on the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing terms:</p>
          <p>23. “ The Lacedæmonians shall be allies of the Athenians <lb/>
            for fifty years. <note type="footnote"> Arnold translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοί</foreign>, " of their own accord; " but Poppo remarks <lb/>

            ummoned by the Lacedæmonians, ch. 17. 2, and 27. 1. He supposes, <lb/>

          <p>This alliance was entered into not long after the treaty, and <lb/>
            the Athenians restored to the Lacedæmonians the men taken <lb/>
            from the island; and thus began the summer of the eleventh <lb/>
            year. During these ten years, then, the first war was car­ <lb/>
            ried on continuously, and such is the history of it.</p>
          <p>25. After the treaty, and the alliance between the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and Athenians, which were concluded at the end of <lb/>
            the ten years' war, in the ephoralty of Pleistolas at Lacedae­ <lb/>
            mon, and the archonship of Alcæus at Athens, those who had <lb/>
            acceded to them were at peace; but the Corinthians, and <lb/>
            some of the states in the Peloponnese, were trying to alter <lb/>
            what had been done; and another disturbance immediately <lb/>
            arose on the part of the allies against Lacedæmon. Moreover, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, as time went on, became suspected by the <lb/>
            Athenians also, through not performing in some respects what <lb/>
            had been agreed on, according to the treaty. And though <lb/>
            for six years and ten months they abstained from marching <lb/>
            against each other's territory, yet out of it, during the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of a doubtful suspension of arms, they were doing one <lb/>
            another the greatest possible damage. Subsequently, how­ <lb/>
            ever, they were compelled to break the treaty concluded after <lb/>
            the ten years' war, and again proceeded to open hostilities.</p>
          <p>26. And the same Thucydides the Athenian has also written <lb/>
            the history of these transactions in order, as they severally <lb/>
            happened, by summers and winters, until the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and their allies put an end to the sovereignty of the Athenians, <lb/>
            and took the long walls and Piræus. To the time of that event <lb/>
            there were spent in the war seven and twenty years in all. With <lb/>
            regard to the intervening arrangement, if any one shall object <lb/>
            to consider it as a state of war, he will not estimate it rightly. <lb/>
            For let him regard it as it is characterized by the facts of <lb/>
            the case, and he will find that there is no reason for its being <lb/>
            deemed a state of peace; since during it they neither gave <note type="footnote">1 On this use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διήϱηται</foreign>, see Poppo or Bloomfield.—With regard to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέ</foreign> in this clause, it is the opinion of Göller that it refers to <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> before <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὑρήσει</foreign>: but Poppo observes in opposition to this, that the imperative <lb/>

            much as its very stipulations were n ot all fulfilled ; and then there were <lb/>
            mutual causes of complaint with respect to other matters of which the treaty <lb/>
            had made no mention." </note> <pb n="327"/>

            </note>nor received back all they had arranged to do; and besides <lb/>
            this, there were offences committed on both sides, as in the <lb/>
            case of the Mantinean and Epidaurian wars, and other in­ <lb/>
            stances; and the Thrace-ward allies were in no respect less <lb/>
            at war than before; while the Bœotians had only a truce from <lb/>
            one ten days to another. Including, therefore, the first war <lb/>
            of ten years, the suspicious cessation of hostilities which fol­ <lb/>
            lowed it, and the subsequent war which succeeded to that, any <lb/>
            one will find that the number of years was what I have men­ <lb/>
            tioned, (reckoning by the great divisions of time,) with only <lb/>
            a few days' difference; and that such as positively asserted <lb/>
            any thing on the strength of oracles, found this the only fact <lb/>
            which proved true. At least I, for my own part, remember <lb/>
            that all along, both at the beginning of the war, and till it was <lb/>
            brought to a conclusion, it was alleged by many that it was to <lb/>
            last thrice nine years. And I lived on through the whole of <lb/>
            it, being of an age to comprehend events, and paying atten­ <lb/>
            tion, in order to gain accurate knowledge on each point. It was <lb/>
            also my lot to be banished my country twenty years after my <lb/>
            command at Amphipolis; and thus, by being present at the <lb/>
            transactions of either party, and especially of the Peloponnesians, <lb/>
            in consequence of my banishment, to gain at my leisure a more <lb/>
            perfect acquaintance with each of them. The difference, then, <lb/>
            which arose after the ten years, and the breaking upof the treaty, <lb/>
            and the subsequent course of hostilities, I will now relate.</p>
          <p>27. When, then, the fifty years' treaty had been concluded, <lb/>
            and the 1 alliance afterwards, the embassies from the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nese, which had been summoned for that business, returned <lb/>
            from Lacedæmon. Accordingly the rest went home ; but the <lb/>
            Corinthians repaired to Argos, and in the first place held <lb/>
            communications with some of the Argives who were in office, <lb/>
            to the effect that, since the Lacedæmonians, not for the good, <lb/>
            but for the subjugation of the Peloponnese, had entered into <lb/>
            treaty and alliance with the Athenians, who were before their <lb/>
            bitterest enemies ; the Argives ought to consider how the Pe­ <lb/>
            loponnese might be preserved; and to pass a decree, that any <lb/>
            city of the Greeks that wished, being independent, and giving <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ ξυμμαχίαι</foreign>.] Poppo remarks, in his note on 48. 1, on this use of the <lb/>
            plural noun with reference to a single alliance ; but does not offer any ex­ <lb/>
            planation of it. Probably it arises from the separate ratification of the <lb/>
            alliance by each of the two states so that it may be regarded as a twofold <lb/>
            transaction. </note> <pb n="328"/>

            judicial satisfaction for wrongs, on fair and equal terms, might <lb/>
            enter into alliance with the Argives, on condition of defending <lb/>
            each other's country: and that they should appoint a few per­ <lb/>
            sons as commissioners with full powers, instead of the discus­ <lb/>
            sion of the measure being held before the people; in order <lb/>
            that those might not be known who had failed to persuade the <lb/>
            multitude. And they asserted that many would come over to <lb/>
            them for hatred of the Lacedæmonians, The Corinthians then, <lb/>
            having suggested these things, returned home.</p>
          <p>28. When those of the Argives who heard their proposals <lb/>
            had reported them to the government and the people, the <lb/>
            Argives passed the decree, and chose twelve men, with whom <lb/>
            any one of the Greeks who wished should conclude an alliance, <lb/>
            except the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, neither of whom <lb/>
            should have liberty to enter into treaty without the consent of <lb/>
            the Argive people. The Argives acceded the more readily to <lb/>
            these proposals, because they saw that they should have the <lb/>
            war with the Lacedæmonians, (for their treaty with them was <lb/>
            on the point of expiring,) and also because they hoped to <lb/>
            gain the supremacy of the Peloponnese. For at that time <lb/>
            Lacedæmon was in very bad repute, and was despised in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of its misfortunes; while the Argives were in an <lb/>
            excellent condition in all respects, as they had taken no part <lb/>
            in the war against Athens, but had rather reaped the good <lb/>
            fruits of having been in treaty with both sides. Thus, then, <lb/>
            the Argives were admitting into alliance such of the Greeks <lb/>
            as wished it.</p>
          <p>29. The Mantineans and their allies were the first to join <lb/>
            them, through fear of the Lacedæmonians. For a certain <lb/>
            part of Arcadia had been reduced to subjection by the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans, while the war with the" Athenians was still going on ; <lb/>
            and they thought that the Lacedæmonians would not allow <lb/>
            their sovereignty over it, since they had now 1 leisure to in­ <lb/>
            terfere ; so that they gladly turned to the Argives, consider­ <lb/>
            ing them to be a powerful state, and one which was always at <lb/>
            variance with the Lacedæmonians, and under a democratical <lb/>
            government like themselves. When the Mantineans had re­ <lb/>
            volted, the rest of the Peloponnese also was thrown into <lb/>
            commotion, with the idea that they too ought to do the same; <note type="footnote"> I The force of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολήν</foreign>appears to be, " leisure, as well as <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> 30.] <lb/>
            </note>as they th. :git that they had changed sides through knowing <lb/>
            more than the rest. At the same time they were angry with <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians, both on other grounds, and because it had <lb/>
            been mentioned in the treaty with Athens, that it should be <lb/>
            consistent with their oaths to add to it, or take from it, whatever <lb/>
            might seem fit to both states, the Lacedæmonians and Athe­ <lb/>
            nians. For it was this clause, above all, that caused the <lb/>
            excitement in the Peloponnese, and set them on suspecting <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians, in concert with the Athenians, might <lb/>
            wish to reduce them to slavery: for it was only just, they <lb/>
            thought, that the alteration should have been referred to all <lb/>
            the allies. The majority therefore, through fear, were eager <lb/>
            to conclude the alliance with the Argives on their own part, <lb/>
            respectively, as the Mantineans had done.</p>
          <p>30. When the Lacedæmonians perceived this commotion <lb/>
            which had arisen in the Peloponnese, and that the Corinthians <lb/>
            were the advisers of it, and were themselves about to enter <lb/>
            into treaty with Argos, they sent ambassadors to Corinth, <lb/>
            wishing to prevent what was going to happen. They charged <lb/>
            them therefore with suggesting the whole business; and <lb/>
            said that if they withdrew from them, and became allies of <lb/>
            the Argives, they would violate their oaths; and that they <lb/>
            were already doing wrong in not accepting the treaty with <lb/>
            the Athenians, when it had been declared, that whatever the <lb/>
            majority of the allies decreed, should be binding, unless there <lb/>
            were some impediment on the part of gods or heroes. The <lb/>
            Corinthians, in the presence of all the allies who, like them­ <lb/>
            selves, had not acceded to the treaty, (for they had themselves <lb/>
            previously invited them thither,) spoke in reply to the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians ; not indeed directly stating the injuries they had <lb/>
            received, namely, that they had not recovered Sollium from the <lb/>
            Athenians, nor Anactorium—with any other point on which <lb/>
            they considered themselves to be aggrieved; but urging as a <lb/>
            pretext their determination not to betray the Thrace-ward <lb/>
            Greeks ; for they had taken oaths to them, both by themselves, <lb/>
            when in the first instance they revolted, in concert with the Po­ <lb/>
            tidæans, and others afterwards. They were not then, they said, <lb/>
            violating their oaths to the allies by refusing to accede to the <lb/>
            treaty with the Athenians ; for since they had sworn to their <lb/>
            Thrace-ward friends, with appeals to the gods, they should <lb/>
            not show a proper regard for their oaths, if they betrayed <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="margin"> [31 </note> <lb/>
            them. Besides, it had been expressly mentioned, " unless <lb/>
            there were some impediment on the part of gods or heroes ;” <lb/>
            this, then, they c jnsidered an impediment on the part of the <lb/>
            gods. Thus much they said on the subject of their former <lb/>
            oaths : with regard to the Argive alliance, they would con­ <lb/>
            suIt with their friends, and do whatever was right. So the <lb/>
            envoys of the Lacedæmonians returned home. But there <lb/>
            happened to be in Corinth at that time some ambassadors from <lb/>
            the Argives also, who urged the Corinthians to enter at once <lb/>
            into their confederacy, and not delay. They, however, told them <lb/>
            to come to the next congress which was to be held in their city.</p>
          <p>31. Immediately after, there came also an embassy from <lb/>
            the Eleans, who concluded an alliance with the Corinthians <lb/>
            in the first place, and then proceeded thence to Argos, as <lb/>
            they had been previously instructed, and became allies of the <lb/>
            Argives. For they were at variance with the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians just then about Lepreum. For a war having before <lb/>
            this arisen between the Lepreans and some of the Arcadians, <lb/>
            and the Eleans having been invited to alliance by the Lepre­ <lb/>
            ans, on condition of receiving half their territory, and having <lb/>
            brought the war to a conclusion, the Eleans imposed on the <lb/>
            Lepreans, who were themselves allowe d to occupy the territory, <lb/>
            the payment of a talent to the Olympian Jupiter. This they <lb/>
            continued to pay till the Attic war broke out; when, on their <lb/>
            ceasing to do so on the pretext of the war, the Eleans pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to compel them; on which they had recourse to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. When the case was thus submitted to the <lb/>
            arbitration of the Lacedæmonians, the Eleans, suspecting that <lb/>
            they should not have justice, renounced the reference, and laid <lb/>
            waste the Leprean territory. The Lacedæmonians neverthe­ <lb/>
            less decided that the Lepreans were independent, and that the <lb/>
            Eleans were acting with injustice; and inasmuch as they had <lb/>
            not stood by the arbitration, they sent into Lepreum a gar­ <lb/>
            rison of heavy-armed troops. So the Eleans, considering the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to be receiving a city which had revolted from <lb/>
            them, and alleging the agreement in which it had been de­ <lb/>
            dared, that whatever each party had when they entered on <lb/>
            the Attic war, that they should also have when they retired <lb/>
            from it; since they considered that they had not their due, <lb/>
            they went over to the Argives; and thus they too, las they <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθἀπεο ποοτ'οητο</foreign> I do not think that this expression can signify, </note><pb n="331"/>
             <note type="margin">32.] </note> <lb/>
            had been previously instructed, concluded the alliance. Im­ <lb/>
            mediately after them the Corinthians and Thrace-ward Chal­ <lb/>
            cidians also entered into alliance with the Argives; but the <lb/>
            Bœotians and Megareans, holding each the same language as <lb/>
            the other, remained quiet; being I neglected by the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, and yet thinking that the democracy of the Argives <lb/>
            was less suited to them, with their oligarchical form of go­ <lb/>
            vernment, than the constitution of the Lacedæmonians,</p>
          <p>32. About the same period of this summer, the Athenians, <note type="footnote">according to Bloomfield's translation of it, which Poppo approves, " in the <lb/>
            manner aforesaid;" i. e. by communicating with the twelve Argive commis­ <lb/>
            sioners, ch. 28. Surely, if that had been the writer's meaning, he would <lb/>
            have used the perfect tense, not the pluperfect. Haack's interpretation <lb/>
            therefore must be the correct one; " as had been previously ordered by <lb/>
            their countrymen." And in see. 5, where the same words are repeated with <lb/>
            reference to the Eleans, they may either refer to the decree passed by the <lb/>
            state at large for its own course of policy; or the whole people may be said <lb/>
            to have joined the Argive league, though it was done through the agency of <lb/>
            its ambassadors, in accordance with the commands they- had received for <lb/>
            the purpose. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιοϱώμενοι</foreign>.] To the interpretation of this word which Arnold adopts <lb/>
            from Bishop Thirlwall, Poppo, in his last edition, objects that there was no­ <lb/>
            thing in the terms of the peace to raise such a feeling in the minds of the <lb/>
            Bœotians and Megareans. But surely they might share the jealousy and <lb/>
            suspicion which, we are told, were excited throughout the whole of the Pe­ <lb/>
            loponnese by the clause of the treaty empowering Sparta and Athens to <lb/>
            make alterations in it by themselves, without the consent of the allies in ge­ <lb/>
            neral. Chap. 29. 3. At any rate, such a clause seems quite incompatible with <lb/>
            the supposition of the Megareans and Bœotians having been treated at this <lb/>
            particular time, however they might have been in general, with that extreme <lb/>
            respect and attention which Poppo speaks of, and which Göller and other com­ <lb/>
            mentators consider to be expressed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιορώμενοι</foreign>. The absence of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέν</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέ</foreign>, which one would certainly have expected. to mark the opposition between <lb/>
            the two clauses, may in some measure be supplied by the adversative force <lb/>
            which I have given to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί</foreign>; that conjunction in Attic writers sometimes <lb/>
            passing into the signification of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καίτοι</foreign>. See Jelf, Gr. Gr. 759. 3.—This diffi­ <lb/>
            culty would be entirely avoided, and a very appropriate meaning given to the <lb/>
            whole sentence, if <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιορώμενοι</foreign> could be taken in the sense of " left to them­ <lb/>
            selves, not interfered with, permitted to do what they pleased." The verb <lb/>
            is very frequently used in a manner closely approaching to this, as well as <lb/>
            the cognate ones from which it borrows some of its tenses ; but in such cases <lb/>
            it is usually followed by a participle, infinitive, or adjective, which serves to <lb/>
            limit its meaning to some particular case. If, however, it should be thought <lb/>
            possible for it to have been here used without such limitation, it would give <lb/>
            a very good reason why the states should prefer the Lacedæmonian alliance <lb/>
            to that of the restless and meddling Athenians. It would also express an <lb/>
            important difference between the case of the Megareans and Bœotians and <lb/>
            that of the Eleans, with whose policy towards the Lepreans Sparta is men­ <lb/>
            tioned as having interfered ; and that of the Mantineans, who are expressly <lb/>
            said to have abandoned their connexion with her, because they expected si­ <lb/>

            having reduced the Scionæans to surrender, put the adult <lb/>
            males to death ; while they sold into slavery the women and <lb/>
            children, and gave the territory for the Platæans to occupy. <lb/>
            On the other hand, they brought back the Delians to their <lb/>
            country, from scruples arising from their disasters in different <lb/>
            battles, and because the god at Delphi had so commanded them. <lb/>
            At this time, too, the Phocians and Locrians commenced hos­ <lb/>
            tilities. And the Corinthians and Argives, being now in al­ <lb/>
            liance, went to Tegea, to procure its revolt from the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, seeing that it formed a considerable part of the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, and thinking that, if it were added to them, they <lb/>
            would command the whole of it. But when the Tegeans said <lb/>
            they would do nothing in opposition to the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            the Corinthians, though hitherto very hearty in their mea­ <lb/>
            sures, relaxed in their vehemence, and were afraid that none <lb/>
            of the other parties might now come over to them. They <lb/>
            went, however, to the Bœotians, and begged them to enter <lb/>
            into alliance with themselves and the Argives, and act in all <lb/>
            other respects in concert with them. With reference to the <lb/>
            ten days' truces also, which had been made with each other <lb/>
            by the Athenians and Bœotians not long after the con­ <lb/>
            clusion of the fifty years' treaty, the Corinthians desired the <lb/>
            Bœotians to accompany them to Athens, and obtain the same <lb/>
            for them also, on the same footing as the Bœotians; and in <lb/>
            case of the Athenians not acceding to this, then to renounce <lb/>
            the suspension of arms, and in future to make no truce with­ <lb/>
            out being joined by them. On the Corinthians preferring <lb/>
            these requests, the Bœotians desired them to desist on the <lb/>
            subject of the Argive alliance: they went with them, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to Athens, but did not obtain the ten days' truce ; as the <lb/>
            Athenians answered, that they were already in treaty with <lb/>
            the Corinthians, inasmuch as they were allies of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians. The Bœotians, then, did not any the more on that <lb/>
            account renounce their ten days' truce, though the Corinthians <lb/>
            called on them to do so, and expostulated with them on the <lb/>
            ground of their having agreed to do it. Between the Corinthians, <lb/>
            however, and the Athenians there was a suspension of arms <lb/>
            1 without any actual truce. <note type="footnote"> 1 " By <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄσπονδος</foreign> is meant a mere agreement in words, not ratified by the <lb/>

          <p>33. The same summer, the Lacedæmonians made an ex­ <lb/>
            pedition with all their forces, under the command of Pleis­ <lb/>
            toanax, son of Pausanias, their king, into the country of <lb/>
            the Parrhasians in Arcadia, who were subject to the Manti­ <lb/>
            neans, and who had invited their interference in the spirit of <lb/>
            faction : intending also, if they could, to demolish the strong­ <lb/>
            hold at Cypsela, which, being situated in the Parrhasian terri­ <lb/>
            tory, the Mantineans had fortified and garrisoned with their own <lb/>
            troops, for the annoyance of the district of Sciritis in Laconia <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians therefore proceeded to ravage the land of <lb/>
            the Parrhasians ; while the Mantineans, having committed <lb/>
            their city to the custody of Argive troops, themselves kept <lb/>
            guard over their confederates' country. Being unable, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to save the fort at Cypsela, and the towns in Parrhasia, <lb/>
            they retired. The Lacedæmonians, after making the Par­ <lb/>
            rhasians independent, and demolishing the fortress, returned <lb/>
            home.</p>
          <p>34. Moreover, in the course of the same summer, on the <lb/>
            arrival of the troops from Thrace who had marched out with <lb/>
            Brasidas, and whom Clearidas had brought back after the <lb/>
            treaty was made, the Lacedæmonians decreed that the helots <lb/>
            who had fought under Brasidas should be free, and live where <lb/>
            they pleased ; and not long after they settled them, together <lb/>
            with the 1 Neodamodes, at Lepreum, which is situated on the <lb/>
            borders of Laconia and Elis ; for they were now at variance <lb/>
            with the Eleans. But with regard to those of their own body <lb/>
            who had been taken in the island, and had surrendered their <lb/>
            arms, fearing they might suppose that they would be sub­ <lb/>
            jected to some degradation in consequence of their misfor­ <lb/>
            tune, and so, if allowed to retain their franchise, might <lb/>
            attempt a revolution, they disfranchised them, even while <lb/>
            some were holding offices; and with a disfranchisement of such <lb/>
            a kind that they could neither take office, nor have power <lb/>
            to buy or sell any thing. Subsequently, however, in the course <lb/>
            of time, they were again enfranchised.</p>
          <p>35. The same summer also the Dians took Thyssus on the <note type="footnote">1 " That the Neodamodes were a distinct class from the newly enfran­ <lb/>

            rose to the condition of the former; possibly in the next generation; so that <lb/>

            promontory of Athos, a colony of the Athenians. And during <lb/>
            the whole of this summer there was intercourse indeed be­ <lb/>
            tween the Athenians and Peloponnesians, but both parties <lb/>
            suspected each other, from immediately after the conclusion <lb/>
            of the treaty, on the ground of their not mutually restoring <lb/>
            the places specified. For the Lacedæmonians, to whose lot <lb/>
            it fell first to restore Amphipolis and the other towns, had <lb/>
            not done so : nor did they make their Thrace-ward allies ac­ <lb/>
            cede to the treaty, nor the Bœotians, nor the Corinthians ; <lb/>
            though they were continually saying that, in conjunction <lb/>
            with the Athenians, they would compel those states to do so, <lb/>
            if they would not of their own accord. They also pleaded in <lb/>
            excuse the fact of the time not being specified, at which those <lb/>
            who did not accede to it were to be considered as enemies to <lb/>
            both sides. The Athenians therefore, seeing none of these <lb/>
            things really performed, suspected that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            had no upright intentions ; so that on their demanding back <lb/>
            Pylus, they refused to restore it, (nay, they even repented of <lb/>
            having given them back their prisoners taken in the island,) and <lb/>
            kept the other places, waiting till they, on their part, performed <lb/>
            for them what had been arranged. The Lacedæmonians said <lb/>
            that they had done what was possible; for that they had re­ <lb/>
            stored the Athenian prisoners who were in their hands, and <lb/>
            had recalled the troops in Thrace; and whatever else they had <lb/>
            in their power. With regard to Amphipolis, they. were not, <lb/>
            they said, masters of it, so as to give it up ; but they would <lb/>
            endeavour to bring the Bœotians and Corinthians over to the <lb/>
            treaty, and to recover Panactum ; and would restore as many <lb/>
            of the Athenians as were prisoners in Bœotia. They required, <lb/>
            however, that they should restore Pylus to them ; or if not that, <lb/>
            should withdraw the Messenians and helots, as they, on their <lb/>
            part, had withdrawn their troops from Thrace; and that the <lb/>
            Athenians themselves should garrison it, if they would. So <lb/>
            when conferences had been held, many and often, during this <lb/>
            summer, they prevailed on the Athenians to withdraw from <lb/>
            Pylus the Messenians, and the rest of the helots, and all who <lb/>
            had deserted from Laconia; and they settled them at Cranii <lb/>
            in Cephallenia. During this summer, then, there was peace <lb/>
            and free intercourse with each other.</p>
          <p>36. But the following winter, <unclear/>(different ephors happening <lb/>
            now to be in office, and not those under whom the treaty had <pb n="335"/>
            <note type="margin"><unclear/> 37.] </note> <lb/>
            been made, and some of them being even opposed to it,) <lb/>
            when embassies bad come from their confederacy, and the <lb/>
            Athenians, Bœotians, and Corinthians were there, and they <lb/>
            had held many discussions with one another, and come tc <lb/>
            no agreement; on their departing homeward, Cleobulus <unclear>and</unclear> <lb/>
            Xenares—those of the ephors who most wished to break <lb/>
            up the treaty-held a private conference with the Bœotians <lb/>
            and Corinthians, advising them to pursue as far as pos­ <lb/>
            sible the same policy; and that the Bœotians, after first en­ <lb/>
            tering into alliance with Argos themselves, should then en­ <lb/>
            deavour to bring the Argives together with themselves into <lb/>
            alliance with the Lacedæmonians. For in this way the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians were least likely to be forced to accede to the Attic <lb/>
            treaty; since the Lacedæmonians would prefer gaining the <lb/>
            friendship and alliance of the Argives even I at the risk of the <lb/>
            enmity of the Athenians and the dissolution of the treaty. <lb/>
            For they knew that the Lacedæmonians were always desirous <lb/>
            that Argos should be their friend on fair terms ; thinking <lb/>
            that so the war out of the Peloponnese would be more easily <lb/>
            conducted by them. They begged the Bœotians, however, <lb/>
            to put Panactum into the hands of the Lacedæmonians; that <lb/>
            by getting back Pylus, if they could, in exchange for it, they <lb/>
            might more easily proceed to hostilities with the Athenians.</p>
          <p>37. The Bœotians and Corinthians, having received from <lb/>
            Xenares and Cleobulus, and such of the Lacedæmonians as <lb/>
            were friendly towards 2 them, these instructions to carry to <lb/>
            their governments, went each their way. But two persons <lb/>
            of the Argives, who held the highest office in their country, <lb/>
            watched for them by the way, as they were returning ; and <lb/>
            having met them, entered into conversation with them on <lb/>
            the possibility of the Bœotians becoming their allies, as the <lb/>
            Corinthians, Eleans, and Mantineans had done ; for if that <lb/>
            could be well arranged, they thought they might then, on <lb/>
            advantageous terms, both carry on war and make peace, both <lb/>
            with the Lacedaemonians, if they should wish it—holding the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρό</foreign>.] More literally, " in the face of." Poppo adopts Dobree's ex­ <lb/>

            same language all together-and with whomever else it might <lb/>
            be necessary. The Bœotian envoys were pleased at hearing <lb/>
            this ; for they happened to ask the same things as their friends <lb/>
            in Lacedæmon had instructed them to propose. So when <unclear>the</unclear> <lb/>
            I men from Argos perceived that they listened to their sugges­ <lb/>
            tions, they said they would send ambassadors to the Bœotians, <lb/>
            and went away. The Bœotians, on their arrival, reported to <lb/>
            the Bœotarchs what had been said to them, both at Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            and by the Argives who had met them : and the Bœotarchs <lb/>
            were pleased and were much more eager in the business, since <lb/>
            it had turned out so luckily for them in both quarters, that <lb/>
            their friends amongst the Lacedæmonians requested the same <lb/>
            things as the Argives were anxiously wishing. Not long <lb/>
            after, ambassadors came from Argos with the proposals that <lb/>
            have been mentioned ; whom the Bœotarchs sent back after <lb/>
            assenting to their terms, and promising to send envoys to <lb/>
            Argos on the question of the alliance.</p>
          <p>38. In the mean time it was determined by the Bœotarchs, <lb/>
            the Corinthians, the Megareans, and the ambassadors from <lb/>
            Thrace, in the first place, to bind themselves by oaths to each <lb/>
            other, that assuredly, when occasion offered, they would assist <lb/>
            the party which needed it; and that they would carry on war <lb/>
            with none, or make peace, without common assent; and that <lb/>
            so the Bœotians and Megareans (for they had the same object <lb/>
            before them) should then enter into treaty with the Argives. <lb/>
            But before the oaths were taken, the Bœotarchs communicated <lb/>
            these resolutions to the four councils of the Boeotians, which have <lb/>
            the sole power of ratifying measures; and recommended to <lb/>
            them that oaths should be exchanged with such cities as wished <lb/>
            to league with them for mutual assistance. However, the mem­ <lb/>
            bers of the Bœotian councils did not accede to the plan, fearing <lb/>
            that they should do what was displeasing to the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            if they leagued with the Corinthians, who had separated from <lb/>
            them. For the Bœotarchs did not tell them of what had taken <lb/>
            place at Lacedæmon, namely, that Cleobulus and Xenares, <lb/>
            amongst the ephors, and their friends, advised them first to <lb/>
            enter into alliance with the Argives and Corinthians, and then <lb/>
            to join the Lacedaemonians ; as they imagined, that though <lb/>
            they should not mention it, the council would decree nothing <lb/>
            different from what they had 1previously determined on, and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφίσι προδιαγνόντες παραινυ̃σιν</foreign>.] Arnold is followed by Poppo and </note> <pb n="337"/>
            <note type="margin"> 39.1 </note> <lb/>
            now recommended to their country. When the business had <lb/>
            met with this check, the ambassadors from Corinth and Thrace <lb/>
            departed without concluding any thing ; while the Bœotarchs, <lb/>
            who before intended, if they carried these measures, to at­ <lb/>
            tempt also to effect the alliance with the Argives, did not now <lb/>
            bring the question of the Argives before the councils, or send <lb/>
            to Argos the ambassadors they had promised ; but there arose <lb/>
            an indifference and procrastination in the whole business.</p>
          <p>39. In the course of this same summer, the Olynthians <lb/>
            assaulted and took Mecyberna, which was garrisoned by <lb/>
            Athenians. After these events, conferences being continually <lb/>
            held between the Athenians and Lacedæmonians respecting <lb/>
            the possessions of each other which they still retained, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, hoping that, if the Athenians should receive <lb/>
            back Panactum from the Bœotians, they would themselves re­ <lb/>
            cover Pylus, went on an embassy to the Bœotians, and begged <lb/>
            them to deliver up to them Panactum and the Athenian <lb/>
            prisoners, that they might recover Pylus in exchange for <lb/>
            them. But the Bœotians refused to deliver them up, unless <lb/>
            they would make an especial alliance with them, as with the <lb/>
            Athenians. Although therefore the Lacedæmonians were <lb/>
            aware that they should be acting wrong to the Athenians, since <lb/>
            it had been stipulated that they should make neither peace <lb/>
            nor war with any but by mutual consent; yet, as they wished <lb/>
            to receive Panactum from them, believing that so they should <lb/>
            recover Pylus, and as the party which was anxious to break <lb/>
            up the treaty earnestly entered into the Boeotian negotiation ; <lb/>
            they concluded the alliance, when the winter was now closing <lb/>
            and the spring at hand ; and Panactum was immediately be­ <lb/>
            gun to be demolished. And thus ended the eleventh year of <lb/>
            this war. <note type="footnote"> Bloomfield in supposing that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφίσι</foreign> refers to the subject of ; but <lb/>

          <p>40. As soon as the spring of the next summer com­ <lb/>
            menced, the Argives, finding that the Boeotian ambassadors, <lb/>
            whom they said they would send, did not come, and that <lb/>
            Panactum was being demolished, and an especial alliance had <lb/>
            been concluded by the Bœotians with the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            were afraid that they might be left alone, and all the con­ <lb/>
            federacy go over to the Lacedaemonians. For they supposed <lb/>
            that the Bœotians had been persuaded by the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            both to demolish Panactum and to accede to the treaty with <lb/>
            the Athenians ; and that the Athenians were privy to these <lb/>
            measures ; so that they themselves had no longer power even <lb/>
            to make alliance with the Athenians: whereas they hoped be­ <lb/>
            fore, in consequence of the existing dissensions, that if their <lb/>
            treaty with the Lacedæmonians should not continue, they <lb/>
            would, at any rate, be in alliance with the Athenians. The <lb/>
            Argives, then, were involved in these difficulties, and feared <lb/>
            they might be engaged in war at once with the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians: and consequently, <lb/>
            though they did not before accept the treaty with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, but entertained the proud hope that they should en­ <lb/>
            joy the supremacy over the Peloponnese ; they sent as envoys <lb/>
            to Lacedaemon, as quickly as they could, Eustrophus and <lb/>
            Æson, who were considered to be the most acceptable persons <lb/>
            to them; thinking to live in quiet by making a treaty with the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, as they best could under present circum­ <lb/>
            stances, 1whatever might be the arrangement.</p>
          <p>41. On the arrival of their ambassadors, they made pro­ <lb/>
            posals to the Lacedæmonians, as to the terms on which the <lb/>
            treaty should be concluded between them. And at first the <lb/>
            Argives claimed that they should have a judicial reference <lb/>
            granted them, either to some state or individual, respecting <lb/>
            the Cynurian territory; concerning which they have always <lb/>
            been debating, as it is border-land: (it contains the towns of <lb/>
            Thyrea and Anthene, and is occupied by the Lacedæmonians.) <lb/>
            Afterwards, when the Lacedæmonians begged them not to <lb/>
            mention that, but said that if they wished to make a treaty as <lb/>
            before, they were ready to do so; the Argive ambassadors <lb/>
            nevertheless induced the Lacedaemonians to agree to the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing conditions: that at the present time they should make <note type="footnote">1 Or, “ on whatever terms they might, be allowed." See Bloomfield’s <lb/>
            note. </note> <pb n="339"/>
            <note type="margin"> 42] </note> <lb/>
            a treaty for fifty years; but that on either party giving a <lb/>
            challenge, at a time when there was neither plague nor war in <lb/>
            Lacedæmon or Argos, they should be at liberty to decide by <lb/>
            battle the question of this territory-as on a former occasion, <lb/>
            when each side claimed the victory for themselves-but not to <lb/>
            pursue the fugitives beyond the frontiers, whether towards <lb/>
            Argos or Lacedæmon. Now the Lacedaemonians at first con­ <lb/>
            sidered this as mere folly; but afterwards, (for they were <lb/>
            anxious on any terms to have Argos for a friend,) they agreed <lb/>
            to the conditions they demanded, and made a treaty with them <lb/>
            in writing. Before, however, any thing was definitely ar­ <lb/>
            ranged, the Lacedæmonians desired them to return first to <lb/>
            Argos, and show it to their people; and if it pleased them, <lb/>
            then to come at the Hyacinthia, to take the oaths. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly they returned.</p>
          <p>42. In the mean time, while the Argives were negotiating <lb/>
            these matters, the Lacedæmonian ambassadors, Andromedes, <lb/>
            Phoedimus, and Antimenidas, who were to restore Panactum <lb/>
            to the Athenians, and to receive the prisoners from the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians, and bring them back home, found Panactum demolished <lb/>
            by the Bœotians themselves, on the pretext of there having <lb/>
            been exchanged in former times between the Athenians and <lb/>
            Boeotians, in consequence of a dispute about it, an oath that <lb/>
            neither party should inhabit the place, but that they should <lb/>
            graze it in common. The men, however, whom the Bœotians <lb/>
            held as prisoners taken from the Athenians, Andromedes and <lb/>
            his colleagues received from them, and conveyed to Athens, and <lb/>
            restored. They likewise announced to them the demolition of <lb/>
            Panactum, thinking that 1 so they restored that too; for no <lb/>
            enemy to the Athenians would in future inhabit it. On this <lb/>
            announcement, the Athenians expressed great indignation; <lb/>
            thinking themselves wronged by the Lacedæmonians, both <lb/>
            with regard to the demolition of Panactum, which they ought <lb/>
            to have delivered up to them standing, and the intelligence of <lb/>
            their having on their own account made treaty with the <lb/>
            Bœotians, though they formerly declared that they would <lb/>
            join in compelling those who did not accede to the general <lb/>
            treaty. They also looked for any other points in which they <note type="footnote"> I Or, as Poppo explains it, " that that very announcement was equivalent <lb/>
            to <unclear>restering</unclear> it.' </note> <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            <note type="margin"> [43, 44 </note> <lb/>
            had departed from their compact, and considered themselves <lb/>
            to have been overreached by them; so that they gave an <lb/>
            angry reply to the ambassadors, and sent them away.</p>
          <p>43. When the Lacedæmonians, then, were in such a state <lb/>
            of variance with the Athenians, those at Athens, again, <lb/>
            who wished to do away with the treaty, were immediately <lb/>
            urgent against it. Amongst others who were so was Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades son of Clinias, a man who in age was still at that <lb/>
            time a youth, (as he would have been thought in any other <lb/>
            state,) but honoured on account of the nobility of his an­ <lb/>
            cestors. He considered that it was really better to side with <lb/>
            the Argives; though he also opposed the treaty in the bitter­ <lb/>
            ness of wounded pride, because the Lacedæmonians had ne­ <lb/>
            gotiated it through the agency of Nicias and Laches, having <lb/>
            overlooked him on account of his youth, and not having shown <lb/>
            him the respect suitable to the old connexion of his family as <lb/>
            their proxeni, which, having been renounced by his grandfather, <lb/>
            he himself thought to renew by showing attention to the pri­ <lb/>
            soners taken in the island. Considering himself therefore to be <lb/>
            in every way slighted by them, he both spoke against the treaty <lb/>
            in the first instance, saying that the Lacedæmonians were not <lb/>
            to be depended upon, but were only making a treaty in order <lb/>
            that by so doing they might deprive Athens of the Argives, <lb/>
            and again come against them when left alone; and at that <lb/>
            time, when this difference had arisen, he immediately sent to <lb/>
            Argos on his own account, urging them to come as quickly as <lb/>
            possible with proposals for alliance, in company with the <lb/>
            Mantineans and Eleans, since it was a fine opportunity, and <lb/>
            lie would co-operate with them to the utmost.</p>
          <p>44. When the Argives received this message, and found <lb/>
            that the alliance with the Bœotians had not been brought <lb/>
            about in concert with the Athenians, but that they were in­ <lb/>
            volved in a serious quarrel with the Lacedæmonians; they <lb/>
            thought no more of their ambassadors at Lacedæmon, who <lb/>
            were just at that time gone thither on the subject of the treaty, <lb/>
            but paid more attention to the Athenians ; thinking that so, <lb/>
            if they went to war, there would be on their side in it a state <lb/>
            which had been their friend from of old, and was under a de­ <lb/>
            mocratical form of government, like themselves, and wielded a <lb/>
            great power in the command of the sea. They immediately <pb n="341"/>
             <note type="margin">45, 46.J <lb/>
            </note>therefore sent ambassadors to the Athenians to treat of the <lb/>
            alliance ; and were also accompanied by envoys from the <lb/>
            Eleans and Mantineans.</p>
          <p>There came likewise with all speed, as ambassadors from <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, persons who were thought to be favour­ <lb/>
            ably inclined towards the Athenians, namely, Philocharidas, <lb/>
            Leon, and Enlius; through fear that in their anger they <lb/>
            might conclude the alliance with the Argives, and at the same <lb/>
            time to ask back Pylus in exchange for Panactum, and to <lb/>
            plead in excuse for the Boeotian alliance, that it had not been <lb/>
            made for the purpose of hurting the Athenians.</p>
          <p>45. By speaking in the council on these points, and de­ <lb/>
            claring that they had come with full powers to effect a settle­ <lb/>
            ment of all their disputes, they made Alcibiades afraid that if <lb/>
            they were to talk in the same strain to the popular assembly, <lb/>
            they would win over the multitude, and the Argive alliance <lb/>
            would be rejected. He adopted therefore the following <lb/>
            device against them. He gained the confidence of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians by giving them a solemn assurance, that if they <lb/>
            would not acknowledge in the assembly that they had come <lb/>
            with full powers, he would restore Pylus to them, (for he <lb/>
            would himself persuade the Athenians to the measure, as he <lb/>
            now opposed it,) and would settle all other points of difference. <lb/>
            It was with a wish to withdraw them from the influence of <lb/>
            Nicias that he did this; and in order that by accusing them <lb/>
            before the people, as having no sincere intentions, and never <lb/>
            saying the same thing, he might cause the Argives, Eleans, <lb/>
            and Mantineans, to be taken into alliance. And so it turned <lb/>
            out. For when, on coming before the people and being asked <lb/>
            that question, they did not say, as they had said in the coun­ <lb/>
            cil, that they were come with full powers, the Athenians could <lb/>
            endure it no longer; but on Alcibiades' exclaiming against <lb/>
            the Lacedsemonians much more vehemently than before, they <lb/>
            both listened to him, and were ready straightway to bring for­ <lb/>
            ward the Argives and those who were with them, and take <lb/>
            them into alliance. An earthquake, however, having occurred <lb/>
            before any thing was finally settled, that assembly was ad­ <lb/>
            journed.</p>
          <p>46. In the one which was held next day, although the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians had been outwitted, and he himself utterly <lb/>
            deceived with regard to their confessing not to have come <pb n="342"/>
             <note type="margin">[<unclear>46</unclear> <lb/>
            </note>with full powers, Nicias nevertheless maintained that they <lb/>
            ought rather to become friends of the Lacedæmonians, and, <lb/>
            deferring their measures with the Argives, to send once more <lb/>
            to them, and ascertain their intentions. He 1 represented <lb/>
            that it was to their own honour, but to their rivals' discredit, <lb/>
            for the war to be put off: for since their own affairs were in <lb/>
            so good a condition, it was best to preserve their prosperity <lb/>
            as long as possible; whereas to the Lacedæmonians, in their <lb/>
            present misfortunes, it would be gain to run all hazards as <lb/>
            quickly as possible. So he prevailed on them to send ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, of whom he was himself one, to bid the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, if they had any just intentions, to restore Panactum <lb/>
            standing, with Amphipolis, and to give up their alliance with <lb/>
            the Boeotians, if they refused to accede to the treaty-; as it <lb/>
            had been stipulated. that they should make peace with none <lb/>
            but by mutual consent. They told them also to say, that they <unclear/> <lb/>
            too, if they had wished to act unjustly, might have already <lb/>
            taken the Argives for their allies, since they were come to <lb/>
            them for that very purpose. And whatever complaint they <lb/>
            had against them, they gave instructions on the subject to <lb/>
            Nicias and his colleagues, and then sent them off. When they <lb/>
            came there, and, after delivering their other messages, finally <lb/>
            declared, that unless they gave up their alliance with the Boe­ <lb/>
            otians, in case of their not acceding to the treaty, the Athenians <lb/>
            also would take as their allies the Argives and those who <lb/>
            joined them ; the Lacedæmonians refused to renounce the <lb/>
            alliance with the Bœotians—the party of Xenares, the ephor, <lb/>
            and all the rest who had the same views, having sufficient <lb/>
            influence to secure that,-but the oaths they renewed at the <lb/>
            request of Nicias : for he was afraid of returning with all his <lb/>
            objects unaccomplished, and of being exposed to censure, (as <lb/>
            indeed was the case,) since he was considered as the author of <lb/>
            the treaty with the Lacedæmonians. On his return, when the <lb/>
            Athenians heard that nothing had been done at Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            immediately they were enraged; and since they considered <lb/>
            themselves injared, the Argives and their allies happening <lb/>
            to be present, (having been introduced by Alcibiades,) they <note type="footnote">1 Or, as Arnold, Poppo, and others explain it, " advising that hostilities <lb/>

            made a treaty and alliance with them on the following <lb/>
            terms:</p>
          <p>47. " The Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans <lb/>
            made a treaty for a hundred years, on behalf of themselves <lb/>
            and the allies in their respective dominions, to be observed <lb/>
            without guile or injury, both by land and by sea. That it <lb/>
            shall not be allowed to take up arms with a mischievous de­ <lb/>

            their allies, against the Athenians, or for the Athenians and <lb/>
            their allies against the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans, with <lb/>
            their allies, by any means whatever.</p>
          <p>“ That the following are the terms on which the Athenians, <lb/>
            Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall be allies for a hundred <lb/>
            years.</p>
          <p>“ That in case of an enemy marching against the territory <lb/>
            of the Athenians, the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall <lb/>
            go to the succour of Athens, according to whatever message <lb/>
            the Athenians may send them, in such manner as they can <lb/>
            most effectually, to the utmost of their power. That in case <lb/>
            of their having ravaged it and departed, that state shall be <lb/>
            considered as an enemy to the Argives, Mantineans, and <lb/>
            Eleans, and shall be exposed to the vengeance of all these <lb/>
            states ; and that no one of them shall be at liberty to termin­ <lb/>
            ate hostilities with that state, unless they all think fit to do so. <lb/>
            That the Athenians likewise shall go to the succour of Argos <lb/>
            Mantinea, and Elis, in case of an enemy marching against <lb/>
            the Elean, Mantinean, or Argive territory, according to what <lb/>

            and Argives, and shall be exposed to the vengeance of all of <lb/>

            with that state, unless all the states think fit to do so.</p>
          <p>" That they shall not allow armed troops to pass for hostile <lb/>
            purposes through their own land, or that of the allies in their <lb/>
            respective dominions, nor by sea, unless all the states, the <lb/>

            all the states.</p>
          <p>" That the reaty shall be sworn to, by the Athenians on be­ <lb/>
            half both of themselves and their allies, but on the part of the <lb/>
            Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies, by each several <lb/>
            state. That they shall swear that oath respectively which is the <lb/>
            most binding in their country, over full-grown victims ; and the <lb/>
            oath shall be to this effect; ' I will stand by this alliance ac­ <lb/>

            out guile, and will not violate it by any method or means <lb/>
            whatever.' That the persons to take the oath shall be, at <lb/>
            Athens, the council and the home magistrates, the prytanes <lb/>
            administering it; at Argos, the council, the 1 eighty, and the <lb/>

            urgi, the council, and the other magistrates, the theori and <lb/>
            the polemarchs administering it; at Elis, the demiurgi, the <lb/>
            magistrates, and the six hundred, the demiurgi and thesmo­ <lb/>
            phulaces administering it. That the oaths shall be renewed, <lb/>
            by the Athenians, on going to Elis, Mantinea, and Argos, <lb/>
            thirty days before the Olympic festival; by the Argives, <lb/>
            Eleans, and Mantineans, on going to Athens, ten days before <lb/>
            the great Panathenaic festival.</p>
          <p>" That the stipulations respecting the treaty, the oaths, and <lb/>
            the alliance, shall be inscribed on a stone pillar, by the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, in the citadel; by the Argives, in the market-place, in <lb/>
            the temple of Apollo; by the Mantineans, in the temple of <lb/>
            Jupiter in the market-place : and that a brazen pillar shall be <lb/>
            erected at their joint expense'at Olympia, at the present festi­ <lb/>
            val. That should these states think it better to make any <note type="footnote"> I For what little is known of the several offices here mentioned, see At. <lb/>

          <p>48. In this way were the treaty and alliances concluded ; <lb/>
            and yet that between the Lacedæmonians and Athenians was <lb/>
            not renounced on this account by either party. But though <lb/>
            the Corinthians were allies of the Argives, they did not ac­ <lb/>
            cede to the new treaty. Nay, before this time, when an al­ <lb/>
            liance was formed between the Eleans, Argives, and Manti­ <lb/>
            neans, to be at war and peace with the same states, they did <lb/>
            not join the league, but said that they were content with the first <lb/>
            alliance which had been made for purposes of defence, on con­ <lb/>
            dition of succouring one another, but not joining to attack <lb/>
            any party. The Corinthians, then, thus stood aloof from their <lb/>
            allies, and turned their thoughts again towards the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians.</p>
          <p>49. The Olympic festival was held this summer, that at <lb/>
            which Androsthenes the Arcadian was victor the first time in <lb/>
            the 1 pancratium. The Lacedæmonians were excluded from the <lb/>
            temple by the Eleans, so that they could neither sacrifice nor <lb/>
            enter the lists, as refusing to pay the fine to which the <lb/>
            Eleans, by virtue of the Olympian law, had condemned them, <lb/>
            alleging that they had attacked the fortress of Phyrcus. <lb/>
            and sent a body of their heavy-armed into Lepreum during <lb/>
            the Olympic truce. The fine imposed upon them was two <lb/>
            thousand minæ, being two for each heavy-armed soldier, as <lb/>
            the law ordains. But the Lacedæmonians sent ambassadors, <lb/>
            and pleaded that it had not been fairly imposed upon them ; <lb/>
            declaring that the truce had not yet been proclaimed at La­ <lb/>
            cedæmon, when they sent their troops into Lepreum. The <lb/>
            Eleans, however, maintained that the cessation of arms in <lb/>
            their country had already commenced, (for they proclaim it <lb/>
            amongst themselves first,) and that while they were living in <lb/>
            quiet, and not expecting any thing, as it was time of truce, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians had committed an injury upon them by sur­ <lb/>
            prise. The Lacedæmonians replied, that there was no need <lb/>
            of the Eleans having still proclaimed the truce at Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            if they had thought them already guilty of injustice ; but they <lb/>
            had done so, as not thinking it; and they themselves had no <lb/>
            longer gone any where to attack them. The Eleans, however, <note type="footnote">1 Consisting of wrestling and boxing. </note> <pb n="346"/>
            <note type="margin"> [50, a </note> <lb/>
            adhered to the same statement, namely, that they could never <lb/>
            be persuaded that they were not guilty; but that if they would <lb/>
            restore Lepreum to them, they were ready to give up their <lb/>
            own share of the money, and would themselves pay for them <lb/>
            that which fell to the god.</p>
          <p>.50. When they did not comply, they required them again <lb/>
            to do as follows: not to give back Lepreum, if they objected <lb/>
            to it, but to mount on the altar of the Olympian Jupiter-since <lb/>
            they were so anxious to have access to the temple-and swear <lb/>
            before the Greeks that assuredly they would discharge the <lb/>
            fine at a future period. But when they would not do this <lb/>
            either, the Lacedæmonians were excluded from the temple­ <lb/>
            from the sacrifice and from the games-and made their offer­ <lb/>
            ings at home; while the rest of the Greeks, except the Le­ <lb/>
            preans, sent their deputations to the festival. However, the <lb/>
            Eleans were afraid of their sacrificing by force, and kept guard <lb/>
            with a heavy-armed company of their young men ; while there <lb/>
            also came to them a body of Argives and Mantineans, each a <lb/>
            thousand strong, and some Athenian cavalry, that were at <lb/>
            Argos, waiting for the festival. And a great alarm was pro­ <lb/>
            duced in the assembly lest the Lacedæmonians should come in <lb/>
            arms; especially after Lichas son of Arcesilaus, a Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian, was scourged on the course by the 1lictors; because, <lb/>
            on his horses being the winners, and the Boeotian people being <lb/>
            proclaimed victor, on account of his having no right to enter <lb/>
            the lists, he came forward on to the course, and crowned the <lb/>
            charioteer, from a wish to show that the chariot was his. All <lb/>
            therefore were now much more afraid, and thought there <lb/>
            would be some disturbance. However, the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            kept quiet, and let the feast thus pass by.-After the Olym­ <lb/>
            pic festival, the Argives and their allies repaired to Corinth, <lb/>
            to beg that state to come over to them. Some Lacedaemonian <lb/>
            ambassadors, too, happened to be there; and after there had <lb/>
            been much discussion, nothing was accomplished at last; but <lb/>
            an earthquake having occurred, they dispersed to their several <lb/>
            homes. And so the summer ended.</p>
          <p>.51. The following winter the Heracleans in Trachinia fought <lb/>
            a battle with the Ænianians, Dolopians, Maleans, and some of <lb/>
            the Thessalians. For these nations were bordering on, and <lb/>
            hostile to, their city; as it was against no other country but <note type="footnote">1 Or, “ by the <unclear>impires</unclear>,” as Bredow, Haack, and others think. </note> <pb n="347"/>
            <note type="margin"> 62, 53.] </note> <lb/>
            theirs that the place was fortified. Accordingly they opposed the <lb/>
            city on its first settlement, by annoying it as far as they could ; <lb/>
            and at this time they defeated the Heracleans in the engage­ <lb/>
            ment, Xenares son of Cnidis, a Lacedæmonian, being slain, <lb/>
            and others of the Heracleans also cut off. And thus the <lb/>
            winter ended, and the twelfth year of the war.</p>
          <p>52. At the very commencement of the following summer, <lb/>
            the Bœotians seized on Heraclea, when it was miserably re­ <lb/>
            duced after the battle, and sent away Hegesippidas the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonian, on the charge of governing it ill. They occupied <lb/>
            the place through fear that, while the Lacedæmonians were <lb/>
            distracted with the affairs of the Peloponnese, the Athenians <lb/>
            might take it. The Lacedemonians, however, were offended <lb/>
            with them for what they had done. The same summer, Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades son of Clinias, being one of the generals at Athens, <lb/>
            having the co-operation of the Argives and the allies, went <lb/>
            into the Peloponnese with a few Athenian heavy-armed and <lb/>
            bowmen ; and taking with him some of the allies in those parts, <lb/>
            both proceeded to settle in concert with them other matters <lb/>
            connected with the alliance, marching about the Peloponnese <lb/>
            with his troops, and persuaded the Patreans to carry their <lb/>
            walls down to the sea; intending also himself to build a fort <lb/>
            beside the Achæan Rhium. But the Corinthians and Sicy­ <lb/>
            onians, and all to whose injury it would have been built, came <lb/>
            against him, and prevented his doing it.</p>
          <p>53. The same summer a war broke out between the Epi­ <lb/>
            daurians and Argives ; nominally, about the offering to Apollo <lb/>
            Pythæus, which the Epidaurians were bound to make, but <lb/>
            did not, for 1 certain lands by the river side ; (the Argives had <lb/>
            the chief management of the temple ;) but even independently <lb/>
            of this charge, Alcibiades and the Argives thought it desirable <lb/>
            to get possession of Epidaurus, if they could; both to insure <lb/>
            the neutrality of Corinth, and thinking that the Athenians <lb/>
            would find it a shorter passage for their succours through <lb/>
            Ægina, than by sailing round Scyllaeum. The Argives there­ <lb/>
            fore prepared to invade Epidaurus by themselves, in order to <lb/>
            exact the offering. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted Poppo's reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραποταμίων</foreign>, as Arnold himself con <lb/>

          <p>54. The Lacedæmonians, too, at the same time marched <lb/>
            out with all their forces to Leuctra, on their own borders, op­ <lb/>
            posite Mount Lycæum, under the command of Agis son of <lb/>
            Archidamus, their king; but no one knew what was their <lb/>
            destination, not even the 1cities from which contingents <lb/>
            were sent. When, however, the omens from their sacrifices <lb/>
            were not favourable for crossing the border, they both re­ <lb/>
            turned home themselves, and sent word to their allies to pre­ <lb/>
            pare to take the field after the ensuing month ; (that being the <lb/>
            month Carneus, a holy period amongst the Dorians). On theii <lb/>
            retiring, the Argives marched out on the 26th of the month pre­ <lb/>
            ceding Carneus;2 and advancing that day the whole of the time <lb/>
            invaded the Epidaurian territory, and proceeded to lay it waste <lb/>
            The Epidaurians invoked the aid of their allies; but some ot <lb/>
            them pleaded the month as an excuse, while others, even after <lb/>
            coming to the borders of Epidaurus, remained inactive. <note type="footnote"> 1 Duker and Poppo suppose the cities of Laconia to be here intended. </note><note type="footnote"> * I have followed Arnold's former interpretation of this very doubtful <lb/>
            passage, as appearing less objectionable, on the whole, than any other that <lb/>
            has been proposed; though he himself abandons it in his last edition. <lb/>
            Göller and Bloomfield put the comma after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην</foreign>, and read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσέαλλον</foreign>; <lb/>
            but to this there is what appears to me an insuperable objection. Often as <lb/>
            the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσάλλω</foreign> occurs in Thucydides, it is never used, when speaking of <lb/>
            a country, to signify a continuance of offensive measures ; but always ex­ <lb/>
            presses the one definite act of crossing an enemy's borders and invading his <lb/>
            territory; and the case is the same with regard to the cognate substantive <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσολή</foreign>. The imperfect tense therefore, though quite appropriate for ex­ <lb/>
            pressing the ravages which troops continued to make when once in the <lb/>
            country, is inappropriate with reference to the invasion itself; and could <lb/>
            only be used with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα τὸν χρόνον</foreign> on the supposition of the army retreat­ <lb/>
            ing within its own frontier continually, and invading the country afresh; <lb/>
            which is not only improbable in this particular instance, but in direct op­ <lb/>
            position to the first sentence of the next chapter: " <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ καθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃν χρόνον ἐν</foreign> <unclear>τη</unclear> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιδαύρῳ οἱ Ἀργει̃οι ἦσαν</foreign>.” Accordingly, in the very next chapter, see. <lb/>
            2, we have the aorist <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐσέαλον</foreign> followed by the imperfect <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐδῄουν</foreign>; and as all <lb/>
            the MSS. but two have the same reading here, there can be no doubt, I <lb/>
            think, of its being the genuine one.—Poppo objects to Göller’s explanation, <lb/>
            but does not propose any thing himself. Bp. Thirlwall adopts that of Por­ <lb/>
            tus, Acacius, and Hoffmann; " although they had always kept that day <lb/>
            holy." To this Arnold objects; "but can Thucydides have written <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>
            ἄγοντες</foreign> as signifying <foreign xml:lang="grc">καίπερ ἄγουτες</foreign> ?" I certainly do not see why he <lb/>
            could not, since he appears to have used a similar construction elsewhere; <lb/>
            see VI. 16. 6, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ</foreign> oil <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ περιγενόμενοι τῄ μαχῃ οὐδέπω</foreign> Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̃ν βεβαίως <lb/>
            θαρσου̃σι</foreign>; if not also 15. 4. But it is perhaps a more solid objection, that <lb/>
            he never uses either <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγειν</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέραν</foreign> in that sense (though he does with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑορτήν</foreign>); nor <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα τὸν χρόνον</foreign> to signify " the whole course of time," as <lb/>
            distinguished from " the whole of the time," i. e. of some definite period; <lb/>
            but either <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεί</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ παντός</foreign>. Nor, again, does the statement thus supposed <lb/>
            to be made respecting the holy day rest on any thing but assumption. </note> <pb n="349"/>

          <p>55. At the time that the Argives were in Epidaurus, de­ <lb/>
            putations from the states assembled at Mantinea, on the in­ <lb/>
            vitation of the Athenians. And when the conference began, <lb/>
            the Corinthians said that their words did not agree with their <lb/>
            deeds; since they were sitting in council on the subject of <lb/>
            peace, while the Epidaurians with their allies and the Arrives <lb/>
            were arrayed against each other under arms. Deputies there­ <lb/>
            fore from each party ought first to go and separate the armies, <lb/>
            and then come and speak again on the subject of peace. In <lb/>
            compliance with this sentiment, they went and brought back <lb/>
            the Argives out of the Epidaurian territory. They then as­ <lb/>
            sembled again, but could not even then come to any agree­ <lb/>
            ment ; but the Argives again invaded Epidaurus, and laid it <lb/>
            waste. The Lacedæmonians, too, marched out to Caryæ; <lb/>
            and returned again, when the omens on that occasion also <lb/>
            proved unfavourable to them. The Argives, after ravaging <lb/>
            about a third of the Epidaurian territory, returned home. <lb/>
            Moreover, a thousand heavy-armed of the Athenians had come <lb/>
            to their assistance, with Alcibiades as general; but on learn­ <lb/>
            ing that the Lacedæmonians had ended their expedition, and <lb/>
            that there was no longer any need for them, they returned <lb/>
            home. And so the summer passed by.</p>
          <p>56. The following winter, the Lacedæmonians eluded the <lb/>
            vigilance of the Athenians in sending by sea to Epidaurus <lb/>
            three hundred garrison troops, under command of Agesippidas. <lb/>
            The Argives therefore went to the Athenians, and complained, <lb/>
            that though it had been specified in the treaty that they <lb/>
            should not allow an enemy to pass through their respective <lb/>
            countries, they had allowed them to go there by sea; and <lb/>
            therefore they should consider themselves aggrieved, if the <lb/>
            Athenians, on their side, did not take the Messenians and he­ <lb/>
            lots to Pylus, to annoy the Lacedæmonians. So the Athenians, <lb/>
            at the instigation of Alcibiades, inscribed at the bottom of <lb/>
            the Laconian pillar, that the Lacedæmonians had not adhered <lb/>
            to their oaths; and they conveyed the helots who were at <lb/>
            Cranii to Pylus, to plunder the country; though in other re­ <lb/>
            spects they remained quiet. Now in the course of hostilities <lb/>
            during this winter between the Argives and Epidaurians, no <lb/>
            pitched battle was fought, but there were only ambuscades <lb/>
            and skirmishes, in which some were slain on each side, as <lb/>
            might happen. When the winter was closing, and spring was <pb n="350"/>
             <note type="margin">[57 68 <lb/>
            </note>now at hand, the Argives went with scaling ladders to Epi­ <lb/>
            daurus, supposing that it would be left unguarded on account <lb/>
            of the war, and intending to take it by storm; but returned <lb/>
            unsuccessful. And thus the winter ended, and the thirteenth <lb/>
            year of this war.</p>
          <p>57. In the middle of the next summer, when the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians saw that the Epidaurians, who were their allies. <lb/>
            were in distress, and that the other states in the Peloponnese <lb/>
            had either separated from them, or were unfavourably disposed <lb/>
            towards them; thinking that if they did not quickly prevent <lb/>
            it, they would proceed to a greater degree of disaffection, <lb/>
            they marched with all their forces, themselves and the he­ <lb/>
            lots, against Argos, under the command of Agis son of Ar­ <lb/>
            chidamus, king of the Lacedæmonians. They were accom­ <lb/>
            panied by the Tegeans, and as many others of the Arcadians <lb/>
            as were in alliance with them. The allies in the rest of the <lb/>
            Peloponnese also, and those beyond it, mustered at Phlius; <lb/>
            the Boeotians with five thousand heavy-armed, the same num­ <lb/>
            ber of light-armed, five hundred cavalry, and an equal num­ <lb/>
            ber of 1 hamippi; the Corinthians with two thousand heavy- <lb/>
            armed ; the rest as might severally happen ; but the Phliasians <lb/>
            in full force, as the army was posted in their country.</p>
          <p>58. Now the Argives had from the first been aware of the <lb/>
            preparations of the Lacedaemonians ; and when they were on <lb/>
            their march for the purpose of joining the rest at Phlius, then <lb/>
            they also took the field. They were reinforced by the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans with their allies, and by three thousand heavy-armed <lb/>
            of the Eleans. And as they advanced, they met the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians at Methydrium in Arcadia, and each army occupied <lb/>
            a hill. The Argives then prepared to engage the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, cut off as they were by themselves : but Agis broke up <lb/>
            in the night, and eluding them, proceeded to the rest of the <lb/>
            allies at Phlius. The Argives, on finding this, marched, as <lb/>
            soon as it was morning, to Argos first, and then to where they <lb/>
            expected the Lacedæmonians with their allies would descend <lb/>
            into their country, namely, the road running by Nemea. Agis, <lb/>
            however, did not take that road, as they expected him to do ; <lb/>
            but having given orders to the Lacedæmonians, Arcadi­ <lb/>
            ans, and Epidaurians, he advanced by another and more <note type="footnote">1 i. e. light infantry who accompanied the cavalry into action See <lb/>
            Poppo's note. </note> <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="margin">62, 60 </note> <lb/>
            difficult route, and so came down into the plain of Argos. <lb/>
            The Corinthians, Pellenians, and Phliasians marched by ano­ <lb/>
            ther steep road; while the Bœotians, Megareans, and Sicyo­ <lb/>
            uians had been ordered to descend by that leading to Nemea, <lb/>
            where the Arrives were posted, in order that, if the Argives <lb/>
            should advance into the plain against his own division, they <lb/>
            might hang on their rear, and use their cavalry with effect. <lb/>
            He then, having made these arrangements and entered the <lb/>
            plain, proceeded to ravage Saminthus and other places.</p>
          <p>59. The Argives, having discovered it, advanced from Ne­ <lb/>
            mea, when it was now day, to their succour; and falling in <lb/>
            with the forces of the Phliasians and Corinthians, killed a <lb/>
            few of the former, but themselves had rather more killed by <lb/>
            the latter. And now the Bœotians, Megareans, and Sicyo­ <lb/>
            nians advanced, as they had been ordered, towards Nemea, <lb/>
            and found the Argives no longer there; but they had gone <lb/>
            down, on seing their property ravaged, and were forming for <lb/>
            battle ; while the Lacedæmonians also were preparing to meet <lb/>
            them. Now the Argives were intercepted in the midst of <lb/>
            their enemies; for on the side of the plain the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and those with them excluded them from their city; above <lb/>
            them were the Corinthians, Phliasians, and Pellenians ; and <lb/>
            in the direction of Nemea the Bœotians, Sicyonians, and Me­ <lb/>
            gareans. They had no cavalry with them ; I for the Athenians <lb/>
            alone of all the allies had not yet joined them. Now the <lb/>
            mass of the Argives and their allies did not consider their <lb/>
            present position so formidable; but fancied that the battle <lb/>
            would be fought on favourable terms, and that they had inter­ <lb/>
            cepted the Lacedæmonians in their own country, and close by <lb/>
            their city. But two individuals of the Argives, Thrasyllus, <lb/>
            one of the five generals, and Alciphron, the proxenus of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, when the armies were now on the very point <lb/>
            of engaging, went to Agis, and in a conference urged him not <lb/>
            to bring on a battle; since the Argives were prepared to give <lb/>
            and accept fair and equal arbitration for whatever complaints <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians had against them, and to make a treaty <lb/>
            and live in peace for the future.</p>
          <p>60. Those of the Argives who made these statements did so <lb/>
            on their own authority, and not by order of the people ; and <note type="footnote">1 Implying, of course, that the Athenians were the only people amongst <lb/>
            the confederates who had any civalry. </note> <pb n="352"/>
            <note type="margin"> [61 </note> <lb/>
            Agis on his own discretion received th eir proposals ; and with­ <lb/>
            out consulting, any more than they had, with the majority, <lb/>
            but only communicating them to one of the officers who joined <lb/>
            the expedition, granted a truce for four months, during which <lb/>
            they were to fulfil their agreement. And so he immediately <lb/>
            led back the army, without explaining the matter to any of <lb/>
            the other confederates. The Lacedæmonians and allies fol­ <lb/>
            lowed, indeed, as he led them, out of respect for the law ; but <lb/>
            amongst each other they blamed him exceedingly, considering <lb/>
            that when they had had an opportunity of fighting on favour­ <lb/>
            able terms, and their enemies were hemmed in on all sides, <lb/>
            both by infantry and cavalry, they were returning without <lb/>
            having achieved any thing worthy of their preparations. For <lb/>
            indeed this was the finest Grecian army that had ever been <lb/>
            brought together up to that time; and it appeared such espe­ <lb/>
            cially while it was still all united at Nemea, consisting of the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians in full force, the Arcadians, Bœotians, Co­ <lb/>
            rinthians, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Phliasians, and Megareans ; <lb/>
            and those, too, all picked men from their respective popula­ <lb/>
            tions, and thinking themselves a match, not only for the Argive <lb/>
            confederacy, but even for another such added to it. Thus <lb/>
            then the army, finding great fault with Agis, withdrew, and <lb/>
            dispersed to their several homes. But the Argives, on their <lb/>
            side, blamed far more severely still those who had concluded <lb/>
            the truce without consulting the people ; as they too thought <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians had escaped when they never could <lb/>
            have had a finer opportunity of destroying them; since the <lb/>
            contest would have been decided near their own city, and in <lb/>
            concert with many brave allies. On their return therefore <lb/>
            they began to stone Thrasyllus in the bed of the Charadrus, <lb/>
            where they try all causes that may arise from any expedition, <lb/>
            before they enter the city. He escaped by flying for refuge <lb/>
            to the altar ; his property, however, was confiscated by them.</p>
          <p>61. After this, when the Athenian succours arrived, con­ <lb/>
            sisting of a thousand heavy-armed and three hundred cavalry, <lb/>
            commanded by Laches and Nicostratus, the Argives being <lb/>
            loath, notwithstanding their arrival, to break the truce with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, commanded them to go back, though <lb/>
            they wished to make a communication to them, and did <lb/>
            not grant them a public audience, until the Mantineans and <lb/>
            Eleans, (for they were still there,) by their entreaties, con- <pb n="353"/>
             <note type="margin">82, 63.J <lb/>
            </note>strained them to do so. The Athenians then—Alcibiades being <lb/>
            present as ambassador-spoke before the Argives and their <lb/>
            allies to this effect; that it was not right for the truce I even <lb/>
            to have been made, without the consent of the other allies ; and <lb/>
            that now, since their force had come so seasonably, they ought <lb/>
            to proceed to hostilities. And having persuaded the allies <lb/>
            by their arguments, they immediately marched against Orcho­ <lb/>
            menus, all but the Argives, who, though persuaded to the <lb/>
            measure, still stayed behind at first; afterwards, however, they <lb/>
            also went. Thus they all sat down before Orchomenus, and <lb/>
            besieged it, and made assaults upon it; being for other <lb/>
            -easons desirous to get possession of it, and especially as <lb/>
            some hostages from Arcadia were deposited there by the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians. The Orchomenians, alarmed at the weakness <lb/>
            of their wall and the number of the hostile forces, and fearing, <lb/>
            since no succours had arrived, that they might perish before <lb/>
            they did, surrendered on condition of joining the confederacy, <lb/>
            giving hostages of their own to the Mantineans, and delivering <lb/>
            up those whom the Lacedaemonians had deposited with them.</p>
          <p>62. After this, when the allies were now in possession of <lb/>
            Orchomenus, they consulted to which of the remaining places <lb/>
            they should proceed first. The Eleans urged them to go <lb/>
            against Lepreum, the Mantineans against Tegea ; and the <lb/>
            Argives and Athenians sided with the Mantineans. The <lb/>
            Eleans, being angry at their not determining to march against <lb/>
            Lepreum, returned home; while the rest of the allies made <lb/>
            preparations at Mantinea for proceeding against Tegea; and a <lb/>
            party of the Tegeans themselves in the town were ready to <lb/>
            give up the government to them.</p>
          <p>63. As for the Lacedæmonians, when they had returned <lb/>
            from Argos after concluding the four months' truce, they <lb/>
            blamed Agis exceedingly for not having brought Argos into <lb/>
            subjection to them, when there was so fine an opportunity as <lb/>
            they thought had never before presented itself; for it was no <lb/>
            easy thing to find so many and such allies collected together. <lb/>
            But when tidings also came of the capture of Orchomenus, they <lb/>
            were far more enraged, and under the influence of anger resolved <note type="footnote">1 Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένοιντο</foreign>.] An-old and Poppo agree with Bauer in thinking that <lb/>

            immediately (contrary to their general habit) that they ought <lb/>
            to demolish his house, and fine him ten thousand drachmas. <lb/>
            But he besought them to do none of these things; for he would <lb/>
            atone for his faults by good service when he next took the <lb/>
            field, or they might then do to him whatever they pleased. <lb/>
            Accordingly, they abstained from the fine and the demolition <lb/>
            of his house, but passed a law at that time which had nEWer <lb/>
            before existed amongst them ; for they chose ten Spartans to <lb/>
            act as counsellors with him, without whose consent he should <lb/>
            have no power to lead an army out of the city.</p>
          <p>64. Meanwhile intelligence reached them from their friends <lb/>
            in Tegea, that unless they came there quickly, Tegea would <lb/>
            go over from them to the Argives and their allies, and that it <lb/>
            had all but done so. Upon this then succour was given them <lb/>
            by the Lacedæmonians and their helots in full force, with vigour, <lb/>
            and in such a way as had never been done before. They ad­ <lb/>
            vanced to Orestheum, in the Mænalian territory ; and com­ <lb/>
            manded those of the Arcadians who were their allies to muster <lb/>
            and march close after them to Tegea ; while they themselves, <lb/>
            after coming all of them as far as Orestheum, from that place <lb/>
            sent back home the sixth part of their force, in which were <lb/>
            included those who were too old or too young for foreign ser­ <lb/>
            vice, to protect their property at home, and with the remainder <lb/>
            of their army arrived at Tegea, where their allies from Ar­ <lb/>
            cadia joined them not long after. They also sent to the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians. Bœotians, Phocians, and Locrians, with orders to <lb/>
            reinforce them as quickly as possible at Mantinea. But to <lb/>
            these the notice was short, and it was not easy, except in a <lb/>
            body, and after waiting for each other, to cross the enemy'a <lb/>
            territory; for it closed up the communication, lying just in <lb/>
            the way of it: however, they made all haste notwithstanding. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians, meanwhile, taking with them their Ar­ <lb/>
            cadian allies who had joined them, invaded the territory of <lb/>
            Mantinea, and having encamped near the temple of Hercules, <lb/>
            laid waste the land.</p>
          <p>65. The Argives and their allies, on seeing them, occupied <lb/>
            a position that was strong and difficult of access, and drew up <lb/>
            their troops for action. The Lacedæmonians and their allies <lb/>
            immediately advanced against them, and proceeded to within <lb/>
            stone's throw or arrow-shot; when one of the elders called out <lb/>
            to Agis, “ that he was purposing to cure evil with evil;" mean. <pb n="355"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear>36:</unclear> </note> <lb/>
            ing that his present unseasonable eagerness was intended to be <lb/>
            a reparation of his culpable retreat from Argos. He then, <lb/>
            whether in consequence of this exclamation, or because he was <lb/>
            himself suddenly struck by some resolution different from what <lb/>
            he had before adopted, led his army back again with all speed, <lb/>
            before the engagement had begun ; and going into the Tegean <lb/>
            country, diverted over that of the Mantineans the water about <lb/>
            which the Tegeans and Mantineans are continually engaged <lb/>
            in hostilities, as it causes a general injury to whichever coun­ <lb/>
            try it falls into. His object was to bring the Argives and <lb/>
            their allies down from the hill, on their coming xto resist the <lb/>
            diversion of the water, when they heard of it, and so to fight <lb/>
            the battle on the plain. Accordingly, after staying there in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of the water during that day, he turned it <lb/>
            off. The Argives and their allies, on the other hand, were at <lb/>
            first amazed at his sudden retreat, when at so short a distance <lb/>
            from them, and did not know what to conjecture. Afterwards, <lb/>
            when the enemy had withdrawn out of sight, while they them­ <lb/>
            selves remained still, and did not follow them, they then began <lb/>
            to blame their generals again ; both because, on the former oc­ <lb/>
            casion, the Lacedæmonians, when fairly caught near Argos, <lb/>
            had been suffered to escape; and now, when they were run­ <lb/>
            ning away, no one pursued them; but with perfect quiet the <lb/>
            enemy were saving themselves, while they were being be­ <lb/>
            trayed. The generals, then, were at the moment confounded, <lb/>
            but afterwards they led them off from the hill, and having ad­ <lb/>
            vanced on to the plain, pitched their camp, with the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of advancing against the enemy.</p>
          <p>66. The next day the Argives and their allies formed their <lb/>
            line as they intended to engage, should they fall in with their <lb/>
            opponents; and the Lacedæmonians, on going back again <lb/>
            from the water to the temple of Hercules, into their old en­ <lb/>
            campment, see the enemy at a short distance from them, all <note type="footnote"> 1 Though it is true, as Arnold observes, that neither <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοηθου̃ντας</foreign>, nor <lb/>

              by this time in order of battle, and advanced from the hill. <lb/>
              The Lacedæmonians, then, were on this occasion in the greatest <lb/>
              consternation they had ever experienced within their memory. <lb/>
              For their preparations had to be made on a short notice; and <lb/>
              immediately they fell into their ranks in a hurry, Agis, their <lb/>
              king, giving all orders, according to their law. For when a <lb/>
              king is at the head of an army, all commands are given by <lb/>
              him ; and he communicates to the polemarchs what is to be <lb/>
              done, they to the lochagi, those to the penteconters, these <lb/>
              again to the enomotarchs, and these to their enomoty; and <lb/>
              thus their orders, whatever they wish to be done, pass in the <lb/>
              same manner, and quickly reach the troops ; for pretty nearly <lb/>
              all the army of the Lacedæmonians, a small portion excepted, <lb/>
              are officers over officers; and to attend to what is going on <lb/>
              is a duty incumbent on many.</p>
          <p>67. On that occasion the Sciritæ formed their left wing; <lb/>
            who alone of the Lacedæmonians have always that post <lb/>
            by themselves. Next to them were the soldiers who had <lb/>
            served with Brasidas in Thrace, and the Neodamodes with <lb/>
            them. Then came the Lacedæmonians themselves, with <lb/>
            their lochi posted one after the other; by their side the <lb/>
            Arcadians of Heræa; after them the Mænalians; and on the <lb/>
            right wing the Tegeans, with a few of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            holding the extreme position. Their cavalry was posted on <lb/>
            each wing. The Lacedæmonians, then, were drawn up in <lb/>
            this way. On the side of their opponents, their right wing <lb/>
            was occupied by the Mantineans, because the action was to be <lb/>
            fought in their country; and by their side were the Arcadian <lb/>
            allies. Then came the thousand picked men of the Argives, <lb/>
            for whom the state had for a long time furnished at the public <lb/>
            expense a course of training in military matters; next to <lb/>
            them the other Argives; and after these, their allies the <lb/>
            Cleonaeans and Orneans ; then the Athenians, holding the ex­ <lb/>
            treme left, and their own cavalry with them.</p>
          <p>68. Such was the order of battle and the preparation on <lb/>
            both sides. The army of the Lacedæmonians appeared the <lb/>
            larger of the two; but as for stating any number, either of <lb/>
            the several divisions on each, side, or of their collective force, <lb/>
            I could not do it with accuracy. For the number of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, on account of the secrecy of their govern­ <lb/>
            ment, was not known; and that of the others, in consequence <pb n="357"/>
            <note type="margin"> 69.J <lb/>
            </note>of men's natural tendency to boasting with regard to their own <lb/>
            numbers, was regarded with distrust. From the following <lb/>
            mode of calculating, however, one may see the number of <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians that was present on that occasion.. There <lb/>
            were engaged in the battle seven lochi, exclusive of the Sci­ <lb/>
            ritae, who amounted to six hundred ; and 1in each lochus there <lb/>
            were four pentecostyes, and in the pentecosty four enomotiæ. <lb/>
            In the first rank of the enomoty there were four fighting men. <lb/>
            2 In depth, though they had not all been drawn up alike, but <lb/>
            as each lochagus chose, they took their position on the field <lb/>
            uniformly eight deep. And thus, along the whole line, the <lb/>
            first rank consisted of four hundred and forty-eight men, <lb/>
            besides the Sciritæ.</p>
          <p>69. When they were now on the point of engaging, the <lb/>
            following admonitions were, then severally addressed to them <lb/>
            by their own generals. To the Mantineans, that the battle <lb/>
            would be fought for their country, and to decide on the ques­ <lb/>
            tion of empire and slavery-that they might not be deprived <lb/>
            of the former after tasting it, and might avoid again tasting <lb/>
            the latter. To the Argives, that they would fight for their <lb/>
            original supremacy, and not to brook being for ever deprived <lb/>
            of their former equal share of the Peloponnese; and at the <lb/>
            same time to avenge themselves on men who were their ene­ <lb/>
            mies, and near ones too, for many acts of injustice. To the <lb/>
            Athenians, that fighting as they were in concert with many <lb/>
            brave allies, it was a glorious thing for them to show them­ <lb/>
            selves inferior to none; and that by defeating the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians in the Peloponnese, they would enjoy their empire <lb/>
            more securely, and to a greater extent, while no one else would <note type="footnote"> 1 " The regular complement of the enomotia was twenty-four men, be­ <lb/>

            have affected the breadth of the ranks as well as the depth of the files, <lb/>
            though the latter only is mentioned, or rather implied, by our author. The <lb/>
            supposition of such a change is warranted by the variation in the tenses of <lb/>
            the verbs ; and is the only way of solving the difficulty noticed by Dobiee— <lb/>
            that the depth of the line in each lochus appears to be left to the discretion <lb/>
            of its commander, even after the number of men in the front rank of all of <lb/>
            them has been said to have been uniformly four; though after this had once <lb/>
            been settled, the other must, of course, have been no less uniform. See <lb/>
            Poppo's note </note> <pb n="358"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[70—72."/> <lb/>
            ever march against their country. To the Argives and their <lb/>
            allies such were the admonitions that were addressed. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, on the other hand, both individually amongst <lb/>
            themselves, and with their national war-songs, exhorted one <lb/>
            another, as brave men, to remember what they had learned <lb/>
            before ; knowing that actual training for a long time previous <lb/>
            was of more benefit than a brief verbal exhortation, however <lb/>
            well expressed.</p>
          <p>70. After this the conflict commenced: the Argives and <lb/>
            their allies advancing with haste and impetuosity; the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians slowly, and to the music of many flute-players, <lb/>
            placed amongst them according to custom, not with a religious <lb/>
            object, but that they might advance evenly, stepping in time, <lb/>
            and so that their line might not be broken, a thing which <lb/>
            large armies are apt to do in their approaches to an enemy.</p>
          <p>71. While they were yet closing in battle, King Agis re­ <lb/>
            solved to execute a manoeuvre, as follows. All armies, on going <lb/>
            into battle, are forced out too much on their right wing; be­ <lb/>
            cause the men, in their fear, each shelter, as far as possible, <lb/>
            their exposed side with the shield of the man who is posted <lb/>
            next to them on the right, and think that the closer they are <lb/>
            locked together, the more effectually they are protected. The <lb/>
            man who primarily gives occasion to this is he who stands <lb/>
            first on the right wing, through wishing continually to with­ <lb/>
            draw from the enemy his own unarmed side; and the rest <lb/>
            follow him under the influence of the same fear. And so, on <lb/>
            that occasion, the Mantineans reached with their wing far <lb/>
            beyond the Sciritæ, and the Lacedæmonians and Tegeans far­ <lb/>
            ther still beyond the Athenians, inasmuch as their army was <lb/>
            larger than theirs. Agis therefore, being afraid that their left <lb/>
            might be surrounded, and thinking that the Mantineans were <lb/>
            extending too far beyond it, gave orders for the Sciritæ and <lb/>
            Brasidean soldiers to advance from their position with a part <lb/>
            of their number, and equalize their line to that of the Man­ <lb/>
            tineans ; while into the void thus created he ordered Hip­ <lb/>
            ponoidas and Aristocles, two of the polemarchs, to move over <lb/>
            from the right wing with their lochi, and by throwing them­ <lb/>
            elves into it to fill it up ; thinking that their own right would <lb/>
            still have an abundance of strength, and that the line opposite <lb/>
            the Mantineans would be formed the more firmly.</p>
          <p>72. Now as he gave these orders at the very moment of the <pb n="359"/>
             <note type="margin">72] <lb/>
            </note>charge, and on a sudden, the consequence was, that Aristocles <lb/>
            and Hipponoidas would not move on, (they were for this offence <lb/>
            afterwards banished from Sparta, being thought to have shown <lb/>
            cowardice,) and that so the enemy closed with them before <lb/>
            any thing could be done; and moreover, that when he ordered <lb/>
            the Sciritæ to rejoin their comrades, since the lochi did not <lb/>
            move on to their support, neither could these now fill up the <lb/>
            line. But when the Lacedæmonians were most decidedly and <lb/>
            in every respect beaten in point of skill, at that very time <lb/>
            they proved themselves no less superior in point of courage. <lb/>
            For when they had come to close quarters with their opponents, <lb/>
            though the right wing of the Mantineans broke their Sciritan <lb/>
            and Brasidean corps, and the Mantineans and their allies, with <lb/>
            the thousand picked men of the Argives, rushing in through <lb/>
            the open and unclosed part of the line, cut up the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, having surrounded and broken them, and drove them <lb/>
            to the baggage waggons, and killed some of the veterans <lb/>
            who were posted as a guard over them : though in this part <lb/>
            of the field, I say, the Lacedæmonians were worsted, yet <lb/>
            with the rest of their forces, and especially the centre, <lb/>
            where was King Agis, and around him the three hundred <lb/>
            horsemen, 2 as they are called, they fell on the veterans of the <lb/>
            Argives, and what are named the five lochi, with the <lb/>
            Cleonæans, the Orneans, and those of the Athenians who were <lb/>
            posted next to them, and put them to flight; the majority not <lb/>
            having even waited to close with them, but having, on the <lb/>
            approach of the Lacedæmonians, immediately given way, and <lb/>
            some of them having been even trodden under foot, 3 in their <lb/>
            hurry to avoid being anticipated and overtaken. <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, " proved that it was mainly through their courage that they won <lb/>

            really infantry. The actual cavalry were on the wings, as had been already <lb/>
            stated, ch. 67. 1. These " three hundred horsemen," as they were called, <lb/>
            “were originally, we may suppose, so many chiefs, who fought round their <lb/>
            king, not on foot, but in their chariots; this being the early sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱππεύν</foreign> <lb/>

          <p>73. When the army of the Argives and their allies had <lb/>
            given way on this side, 1 their line was now broken off both <lb/>
            ways; while at the same time the right wing of the Lacedæ <lb/>
            monians and Tegeans was surrounding the Athenians with the <lb/>
            troops which outflanked them, and they were encompassed <lb/>
            with danger on both sides, as they were being surrounded on <lb/>
            one, and were already beaten on the other. Indeed they would <lb/>
            have suffered most severely of all the army, if the presence of <lb/>
            their cavalry had not been of service to them. It happened <lb/>
            too, that Agis, on perceiving the Lacedæmonian left wing, <lb/>
            which was opposed to the Mantineans and the thousand Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, to be hard pressed, gave orders for the whole army to <lb/>
            advance to the support of the division which was being de­ <lb/>
            feated. And when this was done, the Athenians meanwhile, <lb/>
            as the enemy's forces passed on and withdrew from them, <lb/>
            escaped at their leisure, and with them the beaten division of <lb/>
            the Argives. The Mantineans and their allies, on the other <lb/>
            hand, and the picked men of the Argives, were no longer dis­ <lb/>
            posed to press on their adversaries; but seeing their own side <lb/>
            defeated, and the Lacedæmonians advancing against them, <lb/>
            they took to flight. And of the Mantineans many were slain, <lb/>
            but of the picked Argives the great majority escaped. However, <lb/>
            the flight and retreat were not hard pressed, nor to any great <lb/>
            distance; for though the Lacedaemonians, until they have <lb/>
            routed their enemies, fight for a long time, and stubbornly, as <lb/>
            regards standing their ground ; yet when they have routed <lb/>
            them, they pursue but for a short time and for a little distance.</p>
          <p>74. Of such a character then, and answering as nearly as <lb/>
            possible to this description, was the battle-the greatest that <lb/>
            had occurred for a very long time amongst the Greeks, and <lb/>
            fought by the most considerable states. The Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            after piling their arms in front of the enemy's dead, immedi­ <lb/>
            ately erected a trophy, and stripped the slain ; and taking up <lb/>
            their own dead carried them back to Tegea, where they were <lb/>
            buried, while they restored the enemy's under truce. There <lb/>
            were killed, of the Argives, Orneans, and Cleonæans, seven <lb/>
            hundred; of the Mantineans, two hundred; and the same <note type="footnote">which might seem an exception to what has been stated, is the second; and <lb/>
            that is not really one, if<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃μὴ ἐκΦεύγειν</foreign> be joined with <foreign xml:lang="grc">διώκοντας</foreign>, as Poppo <lb/>
            ties it. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 " i. e. by one part of it having advanced beyond it to pursue the enemy, <lb/>

            number of the Athenians including the Æginetans, with <lb/>
            their generals. On the side of the Lacedæmonians, the allies <lb/>
            did not suffer to such an extent that any number worth men­ <lb/>
            tioning were killed; and of themselves it was difficult to learn <lb/>
            the truth, but about three hundred were said to have fallen.</p>
          <p>75. Now when the engagement was about to take place, <lb/>
            Pleistoanax also, the other king, set out to their aid with those <lb/>
            who were above and below the usual age for service, and <lb/>
            reached as far as Tegea, but went back again on hearing of <lb/>
            the victory. The Lacedæmonians sent, too, and turned back <lb/>
            the allies from Corinth and from beyond the Isthmus; and <lb/>
            having themselves returned and dismissed their allies, they <lb/>
            kept the festival; (for it happened to be the time of their <lb/>
            Carnea). And the imputations which at that time were urged <lb/>
            against them by the Greeks, both on the score of cowardice in <lb/>
            consequence of their disaster in the island, and of their bad <lb/>
            management and dilatoriness in other respects, they wiped out <lb/>
            by this one action ; having been, as was now thought, re­ <lb/>
            duced by fortune, but still the same men at heart.</p>
          <p>Now the day before this battle it also happened that the <lb/>
            Epidaurians with all their forces invaded the Argive terri­ <lb/>
            tory, and cut off in great numbers, when they came out to give <lb/>
            them battle, those of the Argives who were left behind to keep <lb/>
            guard. Moreover, when three thousand of the Elean heavy- <lb/>
            armed had come after the battle to the succour of the Manti­ <lb/>
            neans, and a thousand Athenians in addition to their former <lb/>
            force, all these allies at once marched against Epidaurus, <lb/>
            while the Lacedæmonians were keeping the Carnea ; and <lb/>
            dividing the work between them, they began a wall of circum­ <lb/>
            vallation round the city. And though the rest abandoned the <lb/>
            work, the Athenians finished it round the promontory called <lb/>
            the Heræum, the part which had been assigned to them. And <lb/>
            having all joined in leaving a garrison in this fortress, they re­ <lb/>
            turned to their several cities. And so the summer ended.</p>
          <p>76. At the beginning of the following winter, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, after they had celebrated the Carnean festival, im­ <lb/>
            mediately took the field; and on arriving at Tegea, sent on <lb/>
            to Argos proposals for an accommodation. For there had <lb/>
            been there previously a party in their interest, and desirous of <lb/>
            putting down the democracy at Argos; and since the battle <lb/>
            had been fought, they were much better able to persuade the <pb n="362"/>
            <note type="margin"> [77 </note> <lb/>
            people at large to the proposed arrangement. Their wish <lb/>
            was, after first concluding a treaty with the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            then, in the second place, to enter into alliance with them; <lb/>
            and so at length to attack the democracy. Accordingly, there <lb/>
            came from the Lacedemonians to Argos, Lichas, son of Arcesi­ <lb/>
            laus, who was proxenus for the Argives, bearing two pro­ <lb/>
            posals, one as to the mode in which they should carry on <lb/>
            hostilities, if they preferred it; the other, as to the footing on <lb/>
            which they should remain at peace, if they preferred that. <lb/>
            And after there had been much controversy on the subject, <lb/>
            (for Alcibiades also happened to be present,) the party who ne­ <lb/>
            gotiated for the Lacedæmonians, and who now ventured to do <lb/>
            so openly, prevailed on the Argives to accept the proposal for <lb/>
            An accommodation ; which was to this effect:</p>
          <p>77. " It seems good to the assembly of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            to enter into agreement with the Argives on the following <lb/>
            conditions That they shall restore their children to the <lb/>
            Orchomenians, their men to the Mænalians, and the men de­ <lb/>
            posited at Mantinea to the Lacedæmonians. That they shall <lb/>
            evacuate Epidaurus, and demolish their fortification there: <lb/>
            and that if the Athenians do not withdraw from Epidaurus, <lb/>
            they shall be declared enemies to the Argives and Laced--­ <lb/>
            monians, with the allies of both those states.- That if the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians have any children in their custody, they shall <lb/>
            restore them to all the states.-That with respect to the offer­ <lb/>
            ing to the god, 1 the Epidaurians shall be at liberty to take an <lb/>
            oath on the subject, and that the Argives shall allow them to <lb/>
            do so.-That the states in the Peloponnese, both small and <lb/>
            great, shall be all independent, according to the institutions of <lb/>
            their fathers.- That if any of those beyond the Peloponnese <lb/>
            come against the Peloponnesian territory with evil intent, <lb/>
            they shall repel the invader 2 by common counsel, on such <lb/>
            terms as shall seem most just for the Peloponnesians.—That <lb/>
            whatever people out of the Peloponnese are allies of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, they shall stand on the same footing as the allies of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians and of the Argives, retaining their own pos­ <lb/>
            sessions.—3 That the contracting parties shall show these con- <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴμεν λη̨̃υ</foreign>.] For the various conjectures as to the true reading in this <lb/>
            passage, see Poppo. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμόθι</foreign>.] Or, as Arnold takes it, after Bredow, " any where." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">έσθαι</foreign>.] Bloomfield supposes the allies " to be the subject of <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> 78, 79.] </note> <lb/>
            ditions to the allies, and enter into agreement with them, if <lb/>
            they seem satisfactory to them ; but that if any thing else <lb/>
            seem good to the allies, they shall send them away home."</p>
          <p>78. This proposal the Argives in the first place accepted, <lb/>
            and the army of the Lacedaemonians returned home from <lb/>
            Tegea. Afterwards, when intercourse with each other was <lb/>
            now held by them, not long subsequently the same party <lb/>
            again contrived that the Argives should renounce their al­ <lb/>
            liance with the Mantineans, Eleans, and Athenians, and con­ <lb/>
            clude a treaty and alliance with the Lacedaemonians ; which <lb/>
            were to this effect:</p>
          <p>79. “ The following are the terms on which it seemed good <lb/>
            to the Lacedæmonians and Argives that a treaty and alliance <lb/>
            should be concluded between them for fifty years.- That they <lb/>
            shall afford to each other judicial decision of differences, on <lb/>
            fair and equal terms, according to the institutions of their <lb/>
            fathers.- That the other states in the Peloponnese shall par­ <lb/>
            ticipate in this treaty and alliance, as independent and self­ <lb/>
            governed, retaining their own possessions, and affording fair <lb/>
            and equal judicial decisions, according to the institutions of <lb/>
            their fathers.-That whatever people out of the Peloponnese <lb/>
            are allies of the Lacedæmonians, they shall stand on the same <lb/>
            footing as the Lacedæmonians, and the allies of the Argives on <lb/>
            the same footing as the Argives, retaining their own posses­ <lb/>
            sions.—That if a common expedition to any quarter should be <lb/>
            required, the Lacedaemonians and Argives shall consult upon <lb/>
            it, deciding as may be most just for the allies.-That if any of <lb/>
            the states, either in the Peloponnese or out of it, have any <lb/>
            points of dispute, whether concerning their borders or any <lb/>
            thing else, 1 they shall be judicially decided.-That if any of <note type="footnote">fers. The same parties must also be the subject of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπιάλλειν</foreign> in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing sentence: but their object in thus sending them away is doubtful; <lb/>
            whether it was that the ambassadors might consult their governments on the <lb/>
            objections they had made to the treaty; or, that they might not, by their <lb/>
            intrigues, attempt to unsettle the relations between Argos and Lacedæmon. <lb/>
            The latter appears to me more accordant with the brief and summary ex <lb/>
            pression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκαδ' ἀπιάλλειν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">διακριθη̃μεν</foreign>.] Or, as Arnold takes it, simply brought to an issue," of <lb/>
            whatever kind it might-be. Poppo agrees with Bloomfield that only an ap­ <lb/>
            peal to legal principles is here intended by the word; but observes that it is <lb/>
            a less definite term than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς πόλιν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλθει̃ν</foreign>, the method prescribed when both <lb/>
            the contending states were members of the leagues; as including the decisions, <lb/>
            not only of a third state, but also of the Delphian oracle, the <unclear>Amphisiyons</unclear>, <lb/>
            and of individual referees </note> <pb n="364"/>
            <note type="margin"> [80, 81. </note> <lb/>
            the allied states should have a quarrel with another, they shall <lb/>
            have recourse to the arbitration of whatever third state may <lb/>
            be thought impartial by both.-That the private citizens in <lb/>
            each state shall have their causes tried according to the in­ <lb/>
            stitutions of their fathers."</p>
          <p>80. This then was the treaty and alliance that was con­ <lb/>
            cluded ; and whatever belonging to each other they had <lb/>
            taken in the war, or whatever other ground of difference ex­ <lb/>
            isted between them, they came to a settlement of all such <lb/>
            matters. And as they now arranged their measures in con­ <lb/>
            cert, they adopted a resolution not to receive any herald or <lb/>
            embassy from the Athenians, unless they withdrew from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, and evacuated their forts; and neither to make <lb/>
            peace nor carry on war with any, except conjointly. And <lb/>
            besides conducting their other measures with vehemence, <lb/>
            they both of them sent ambassadors to the Thrace-ward <lb/>
            towns, and to Perdiccas, whom they persuaded to join their <lb/>
            league. He did not, however, immediately separate from the <lb/>
            Athenians, but purposed doing so, because he saw that the <lb/>
            Argives had also; for he himself was originally from Argos. <lb/>
            They likewise renewed their former oaths with the Chalcidi­ <lb/>
            ans, and bound themselves by new ones. Moreover, the <lb/>
            Argives sent ambassadors to the Athenians, commanding <lb/>
            them to evacuate their fortress in Epidaurus. They therefore, <lb/>
            seeing themselves to be but few against many who joined in <lb/>
            garrisoning it, sent Demosthenes to lead their men out of it; <lb/>
            who having arrived, and instituted, by way of pretext, a <lb/>
            gymnastic contest outside the fortress, when the rest of the <lb/>
            garrison had gone out, shut the gates upon them. After­ <lb/>
            wards, having renewed their treaty with the Epidaurians, the <lb/>
            Athenians by themselves gave up the fortress.</p>
          <p>81. Subsequent to the withdrawal of the Argives from the <lb/>
            confederacy, the Mantineans, after first holding out, and then <lb/>
            finding themselves unable to do so without the Argives, came <lb/>
            to terms on their part also with the Lacedæmonians, and relin­ <lb/>
            quished their sovereignty over 1the cities. And now the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians and Argives, each a thousand strong, took the <lb/>
            field together, and the Lacedæmonians by themselves went and <lb/>
            put the government of Sicyon into the hands of a smaller num- <note type="footnote"> L e. their subject alliea, mentioned ch. 33 58.1, and elsewhere. </note> <pb n="365"/>
            <note type="margin"> 82, 83.] </note> <lb/>
            her than before, and then both of them together also put down <lb/>
            the democracy at Argos, an oligarchy being established, in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with the interests of the Lacedæmonians. These <lb/>
            things occurred at the close of the winter, when spring was now <lb/>
            near at hand; and so ended the fourteenth year of the war.</p>
          <p>82. The following summer, the inhabitants of Dium on <lb/>
            Athos revolted from the Athenians to the Chalcidians; and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians settled the affairs of Achaia, which be­ <lb/>
            fore had not been suitable to their views. And now the com­ <lb/>
            mons party at Argos, gradually combining and recovering <lb/>
            their spirits, made an attack upon the oligarchical party, hav­ <lb/>
            ing watched their opportunity, when it was just the time of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian Gymnopædiæ. And a battle having been <lb/>
            fought in the city, the commons gained the victory, and slew <lb/>
            some of them, and banished others. The Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            while their friends had been sending for them a long time be­ <lb/>
            fore, did not go ; but at length put off the Gymnopaediae, and <lb/>
            marched to their aid. On hearing at Tegea that the oligarchi­ <lb/>
            cal party had been defeated, they would not advance any far­ <lb/>
            ther, though entreated by those who had escaped ; but returned <lb/>
            home, and kept the Gymnopædiæ. Afterwards, when ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors had come both from the Argives in the city 1 and from <lb/>
            those driven out of it, and when the allies also were present, <lb/>
            and much had been said on both sides, they decided that the <lb/>
            party in the city were in the wrong, and resolved to march <lb/>
            against Argos; but much delay and procrastination ensued. <lb/>
            In the mean time the commons at Argos were afraid of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and as they courted the alliance of Athens <lb/>
            again, and thought it would be of the greatest service to them, <lb/>
            they built long walls to the sea; that if they should be ex­ <lb/>
            eluded from the use of the land, the importation of things by <lb/>
            sea, through the help of the Athenians, might be of benefit to <lb/>
            them. Some of the cities in the Peloponnese were also privy <lb/>
            to their building these walls. The Argives therefore were <lb/>
            engaged in the work with all their population, themselves, their <lb/>
            wives, and their slaves ; while there came to them from Athens <lb/>
            carpenters and stone-masons. And so the summer ended.</p>
          <p>83. The following winter, when the Lacedæmonians were <note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="grc">αγγέλων</foreign>.] Bekker, Poppo, and Arnold all think this word corrupt; <lb/>
            while Göller understands by it a party in Argos who were in constant coin, <lb/>
            munication with Sparta: but surely that is a very forced interpretation. </note> <pb n="366"/>
            <note type="margin"> L83 </note> <lb/>
            aware of their building the walls, they marched against Argos, <lb/>
            both themselves and their allies, excepting the Corinthians; <lb/>
            communication being also held with them from Argos itself. <lb/>
            The leader of the army was Agis, son of Archidamus, king of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. With regard, then, to the advantages <lb/>
            which they thought they had secured in the city itself, <lb/>
            nothing more came of them; but the walls that were being <lb/>
            built, they took and demolished. And having taken Hysiæ, a <lb/>
            town in the Argive territory, and put to the sword all the <lb/>
            free-men they got into their hands, they returned, and dis­ <lb/>
            persed to their respective cities. After this, the Argives, in <lb/>
            their turn, marched against the Phliasian country, and laid it <lb/>
            waste before they returned, because they harboured their <lb/>
            exiles; for the greater part of them had settled there. 1 The <lb/>
            Athenians ravaged, too, during the same winter a part of Ma­ <lb/>
            cedonia also, charging Perdiccas with the league he had entered <lb/>
            into with the Argives and Lacedæmonians; and with the fact, <lb/>
            that when they had prepared to lead an army against the <lb/>
            Thrace-ward Chalcidians and Amphipolis, under the command <lb/>
            of Nicias son of Niceratus, he had proved false to his allies, <lb/>
            and the armament was chiefly broken up in consequence of <lb/>
            his having deserted the cause. He was therefore proclaimed <note type="footnote"> 1 All the editors agree in thinking different parts of this sentence corrupt, <lb/>
            and propose various emendations of it; but none of them, in my humble <lb/>
            opinion, has struck at the root of the evil, which lies, I think, in the verb <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέκλη̨σαν</foreign>. The idea of the Athenians " blockading " a whole country so <lb/>
            extensive as Macedonia appears too extravagant to be admitted; particularly <lb/>
            as no proof is adduced of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατακλέιειν</foreign> being ever used in such a sense ; but it <lb/>
            always refers to men being shut up" in particular places. Until Bloom­ <lb/>
            field therefore brings forward an instance of its being so employed, he must <lb/>
            not assume that his reading of the passage " yields an excellent sense, and <lb/>
            one not open to any well-founded objection." Krüger's conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατε­ <lb/>
            λήισαν</foreign> would suit the passage admirably; but Poppo observes that the active <lb/>
            form of the compound verb is never used, and that the simple verb <lb/>
            would be going too far from the traces of the common text. To rectify this <lb/>
            evil, I venture to propose <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἐλήΐσαν</foreign>; retaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μακεδονίας</foreign> as a partitive <lb/>
            genitive, and adopting Göller's punctuation, and reading of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περδίκκα</foreign> ; so <lb/>
            that the whole passage would run thus: Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλήἴσα νδὲ του̃ αὐτου̃ χειμωνος <lb/>
            καὶ Μακεδονίας Ἀθηναι̃οι, Περδίκκα ἐπίκαλ</foreign>. K. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ. λ</foreign>. Though after <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί</foreign> <lb/>
            is not used so frequently by Thucydides as by Xenophon and some other <lb/>
            writers, it occurs in three other places, if not more; namely, 1. 132. 2; II. <lb/>
            36.1; and VII. 56. 3, at the beginning of a paragraph in the last instance, <lb/>
            in a manner exactly similar to what is proposed here. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καἰ ἦν δὲ ἄξιος</foreign> 6 <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν κατά τε ταυ̃τα, κ</foreign>. T. X. I may add, that this reading is perhaps <lb/>
            confirmed by, or at any rate agrees very well with, the next notice we have <lb/>
            of Perdiccas, VI. 7. 4, where it is again mentioned that the Athenians </note> <figure type="illustration">

              an enemy. And thus the winter ended, and the fifteenth <lb/>
              year of the war.</p>
          <p>84. The next summer, Alcibiades sailed to Argos with <lb/>
            twenty ships, and seized three hundred men, who were still <lb/>
            thought to be suspicious characters, and to favour the cause of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians; and these the Athenians deposited in the <lb/>
            neighbouring islands within their dominions. The Athenians <lb/>
            also undertook an expedition against the island of Melos, with <lb/>
            thirty ships of their own, six of the Chians, two of the Lesbi­ <lb/>
            ans, sixteen hundred of their own heavy-armed, three hun­ <lb/>
            dred bowmen, twenty mounted archers, and about five thou­ <lb/>
            sand five hundred heavy-armed of the allies and the islanders. <lb/>
            Now the Melians are a colony of the Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            would not submit to the Athenians, like the rest of the island­ <lb/>
            ers, but at first remained quiet as neutrals, and then, when <lb/>
            the Athenians tried to compel them by devastating their land, <lb/>
            went openly to war with them. The generals therefore, <lb/>
            Cleomedes son of Lycomedes, and Tisias son of Tisimachus, <lb/>
            I having gone and encamped in their territory with this arma­ <lb/>
            ment, before injuring any part of the land, first sent am­ <lb/>
            bassadors to hold a conference with them. These the Melians <lb/>
            did not introduce to their popular assembly, but desired them <lb/>
            to state the objects of their mission before the magistrates and <lb/>
            the few. The ambassadors of the Athenians then spoke as <lb/>
            follows :</p>
          <p>85. Ath. " Since our words are not to be addressed to your <lb/>
            populace, in order that the many may not be deceived, for­ <lb/>
            sooth, by hearing at once in one continuous oration persua­ <lb/>
            sive and irrefutable arguments, (for we know that this is the <lb/>
            meaning of your introducing us to the few,) do ye who are seated <lb/>
            here in congress pursue a still more cautious method. For do <lb/>
            not ye, either, make one continuous speech on the several topics, <lb/>
            but immediately taking us up at whatever does not appear to <lb/>
            be advanced in accordance with your interest, decide that ques­ <lb/>
            tion. And first tell us if you are pleased with what we pro­ <lb/>
            pose." The commissioners of the Melians made this reply:</p>
          <p>86. Mel. " The fairness of thus calmly instructing each <lb/>
            other is open to no objection: but your preparations for war, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατοπεδευσάμενοι ἐ</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν γὴν</foreign>.] A concise form for what is more fully <lb/>

            at variance with it. For we see that you are come to be your­ <lb/>

          <p>87. Ath. " If now you have met to argue upon suspicions of <lb/>

            country with a view to its preservation, according to what is <lb/>
            present and before your eyes, we will stop; but if for this ob­ <lb/>
            ject, we will speak."</p>
          <p>88. Mel. " It is but natural and pardonable for men so <lb/>
            circumstanced to have recourse to many things, both in think­ <lb/>
            ing and speaking. However, this our meeting is held with a <lb/>
            view to our preservation; and let the discussion proceed, if <lb/>
            you please, in the way which you propose."</p>
          <p>89. Ath. " We then shall not ourselves advance fair pre­ <lb/>
            tences, either of our justly enjoying empire in consequence of <lb/>
            having overthrown the Mede, or of now coming against you <lb/>
            because we are being injured-and so make a long speech <lb/>
            which would not be believed ; nor do we wish you to think of <lb/>
            persuading us by saying, either that you did not join the <lb/>
            standard of the Lacedæmonians, though you were their <lb/>
            colony; or that you have done us no wrong. But we advise <lb/>
            you, according to the real sentiments of us both, to think of <lb/>
            getting what you can; since you know, and are speaking to <lb/>
            those who know, that, in the language of men, what is right is <lb/>
            estimated by equality of power to compel; but what is possi­ <lb/>
            ble is that which the stronger practise, and to which the weak <lb/>

          <p>90. Mel. " 2 So far then as our opinion goes, it is for our ad- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλεύσοντες</foreign>.] The active form of this verb occurs again, ch. III. 2, <lb/>

            account of our connexion with them, and for very shame."</p>
          <p>105. Ath. " As regards then the favour of heaven, we trust <lb/>
            that we too shall not fall short of it: since we are not requiring <lb/>
            or doing any thing beyond the opinion of men, with respect to <lb/>
            the gods, or their determination, with respect to themselves. <lb/>
            For of the gods we hold as a matter of opinion, and of men <lb/>
            we know as a certainty, that, in obedience to an irresistible in­ <lb/>
            stinct, they always maintain dominion, wherever they are the <lb/>
            stronger. And we neither enacted this law, nor were the <lb/>
            first to carry it out when enacted ; but having received it <lb/>
            when already in force, and being about to leave it after us to <lb/>
            be in force for ever, we only avail ourselves of it; knowing <lb/>
            that both you and others, if raised to the same power, would <lb/>
            do the same. And so, with regard to the gods, we are with good <lb/>
            reason fearless of defeat. But with regard to your opinion <lb/>
            respecting the Lacedæmonians, according to which you trust, <lb/>
            that from a sense of shame, forsooth, they will assist you ; <lb/>
            though we bless your simplicity, we do not admire your folly. <lb/>
            For with respect to themselves, and the institutions of their <lb/>
            country, the Lacedæmonians do indeed to a very great extent <lb/>
            practise virtue; but with respect to others, though we might <lb/>
            descant at length on their conduct towards them, speaking <lb/>
            most concisely we should declare, that of all the men we are <lb/>
            acquainted with, they most evidently consider what is agree­ <lb/>
            able to be honourable, and what is expedient to be just. And <lb/>
            yet such a view of things is not in favour of your present un­ <lb/>

          <p>106. Mel. "But it is on this very ground that we now rely <lb/>

          <p>108. Mel. " Nay, but we are of opinion that they would <lb/>

          <p>109. Ath. " Ay, but to men going to take part in a quarrel <lb/>
            safety does not appear to consist in the good feeling of those <lb/>
            who call them to their aid, but in the fact of their being far <lb/>
            superior in power for action ; and the Lacedæmonians look to <lb/>
            this even more than the rest of the world. At any rate, <lb/>
            through their mistrusting their own resources, it is only in <lb/>
            concert with many allies that they attack those who are near <lb/>
            to them; so that it is not likely they will cross over to an <lb/>
            island, while we are masters of the sea."</p>
          <p>110. Mel. "But they would have others to send; and the <lb/>
            Cretan sea is of wide extent, and to intercept a party in <lb/>
            crossing it is more difficult for those who command it, than to <lb/>
            escape is for those who wish to elude observation. Besides, <lb/>
            if they should be disappointed in this, they would proceed <lb/>
            against your territory, and to the remainder of your allies, <lb/>
            such as Brasidas did not reach: and you will have to exert <lb/>
            yourselves, not so much for territory which does not belong <lb/>
            to you, as for your own confederacy and country."</p>
          <p>111. Ath. " On this point you, as well as others, may learn <lb/>
            by actual experience, and not remain ignorant, that from no <lb/>
            single siege did the Athenians ever yet retreat through fear <lb/>
            of others. But it strikes us, that though you said you would <lb/>

            depend on hope and futurity, while your present resources are <lb/>
            too scanty, compared with those at present opposed to you, to <lb/>
            give you a chance of escape. And so you afford proof of <lb/>

            ing us to retire, adopt some counsel more prudent than this. <lb/>
            For you surely will not betake yourselves to that shame, which <lb/>
            in dangers that are disgraceful, because foreseen, destroys men <lb/>
            more than any thing else. For in the case of many men, <lb/>
            though they foresee all the time what they are running into, <lb/>
            the thing which is called disgrace, by the influence of a se­ <lb/>
            ducing name, allures them on, enslaved as they are to the <lb/>
            word, in fact to fall wilfully into irretrievable disasters, <lb/>
            and to incur a shame more shameful as the attendant on <lb/>
            folly than on fortune. Against this then you, if you take <lb/>
            good advice, will be on your guard; and will not consider it <lb/>
            discreditable to submit to the most powerful state, when it <lb/>
            offers you fair terms, namely, that you should become tributary <lb/>
            allies, with the enjoyment of your own country; and when a <lb/>
            choice of war or safety is given you, to avoid choosing through <lb/>
            animosity what is worse for you. For whatever men do not <lb/>
            yield to their equals, while they keep on good terms with their <lb/>
            superiors, and are moderate to their inferiors, they would be <lb/>
            most successful. Consider then, even after we have retired ; <lb/>
            and reflect again and again, that it is for your country that you <lb/>
            are consulting, 1 which you can do but for one country, and <lb/>

          <p>112. So the Athenians retired from the conference; and <lb/>
            the Melians, having been left to themselves, as they still <lb/>
            thought pretty nearly the same as they had maintained <lb/>
            in the discussion, gave the following answer : "We neither <lb/>

            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσται</foreign>-the infinitive being suggested by the indicative at the end of the <lb/>

            to, but to <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλήν. 'Ες μίαν</foreign> would then stand without its substantive, as it <lb/>
            does Horn. II. 2. 379, though in a different sense. Or, if that be considered <lb/>
            a difficulty, it would perhaps be nothing inconsistent with the frequently <lb/>
            careless style of Thucydides to Suppose a confusion of two expressions, so that <lb/>
            both <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίαν</foreign> should be left in concord with <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλήν</foreign>, The sense of the <lb/>

          <p>113. Such then wasthe answer which the Melians gave. <lb/>
            The Athenians, now departing from the conference, said <lb/>
            " Well then you are the only men who by these counsels, as <lb/>

            the Phliasians and their allies, were cut off to the number of <lb/>
            eighty. And now the Athenians at Pylus took great spoils <lb/>
            from the Lacedaemonians ; in consequence of which the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, though even then they did not renounce the <lb/>
            treaty, and go to war with them, proclaimed that any of <lb/>
            their people who pleased might plunder the Athenians. <lb/>
            Moreover, the Corinthians proceeded to hostilities with the <lb/>
            Athenians for some private quarrels of their own; but the <lb/>
            rest of the Peloponnesians remained quiet. The Melians, too, <lb/>
            attacked by night the part of the Athenian lines opposite the <lb/>
            2 market-place, and slew some of the men; and having carried <lb/>
            in corn, and as many useful things as they could, returned and <note type="footnote"> I These words are, I think, implied by the omission of the article before <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [116. </note> <lb/>
            kept quiet; while the Athenians made bettor provision for the <lb/>
            guard in future. And so the summer ended.</p>
          <p>116. The following winter, the Lacedæmonians intended to <lb/>
            march against the Argive territory, but returned on finding, <lb/>
            when at the frontier, that the sacrifices for crossing it were not <lb/>
            favourable. Owing to this intention on their part, the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, suspecting a certain party in their city, seized some of <lb/>
            them, while others escaped them. About the same time, the <lb/>
            Melians again took a part of the Athenian lines in another di­ <lb/>
            rection, the garrison not being numerous. Afresh force hav­ <lb/>
            ing afterwards come from Athens in consequence of these <lb/>
            occurrences, under the command of Philocrates son of Demeas, <lb/>
            and the inhabitants being now vigorously blockaded, after <lb/>
            there had also been some treachery practised by their own <lb/>
            men, they surrendered at discretion to the Athenians ; who <lb/>
            put to death all the Melian adults they took, and made slaves <lb/>
            of the children and women. As for the country, they after­ <lb/>
            wards sent out five hundred colonists, and inhabited it them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p><pb n="377"/>

          <p>1. THE same winter the Athenians wished to sail again to <lb/>
            Sicily, with a larger armament than that under Laches and <lb/>
            Eurymedon, and bring it into subjection to them, if they <lb/>
            could ; the mass of the people being ignorant of the size of the <lb/>
            island, and the number of its inhabitants, both Greeks and <lb/>
            barbarians ; and that they were undertaking a war not much <lb/>
            inferior in magnitude to that with the Peloponnesians.</p>
          <p>For the voyage round Sicily in a merchant vessel is one of <lb/>
            not much less than eight days ; and 1 though it is of such ex­ <lb/>
            tent, it is only excluded by the space of about twenty stades <lb/>
            of sea from being mainland.</p>
          <p>2. Now it was settled originally in the following manner, <lb/>
            and these were all the nations that occupied it. The earliest <lb/>
            people said to have lived in any part of the country are the <lb/>
            Cyclopes and Læstrygones ; with regard to whom, I can nei­ <lb/>
            ther tell their race, nor whence they came into it, nor whither <lb/>
            they departed out of it: but let that suffice which has been <lb/>
            said by the poets, and which every body in any way knows of <lb/>
            them. The Sicanians appear to have been the first who <lb/>
            settled in it after them ; indeed, as they themselves assert, <lb/>
            even before them, as being the aboriginal population ; but as <lb/>
            the truth is found to be, they were Iberians, and were driven <lb/>
            from the river Sicanus, in Theria, by the Ligurians. And it <lb/>
            was from them that the island was at that time called Sicania, <lb/>
            having previously been called Trinacria; and still, even to <lb/>
            this day, they inhabit Sicily in its western districts. But on <lb/>
            the capture of Troy, some of the Trojans, having escaped the <lb/>
            Greeks, came in vessels to Sicily, and having settled in the <note type="footnote"> 1 " The reasoning employed in the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοσαύτη οὐσα</foreign> is very much in <lb/>
            the style of the geography or Herodotus. The notion is, that so large an <lb/>
            island ought to have been in the midst of a wide sea, proportioned to its own <lb/>
            magnitude; and not to have been so close upon the coast, as to seem a sort <lb/>
            of appendage to the mainland."—Arnold. </note> <pb n="378"/>

            neighbourhood of the Sicanians, they were all together called <lb/>
            Elymi, and their cities, Eryx and Segesta. There were also <lb/>
            settled with them some of the Phocians, who, while returning <lb/>
            from Troy, were carried by a tempest, first to Libya, and then <lb/>
            from that country to Sicily. The Sicels, again, went over into <lb/>
            Sicily from Italy, (for it was there that they used to live,) while <lb/>
            flying from some Opicans ; crossing on rafts, (as is probable, and <lb/>
            reported to have been the case,) having watched an opportunity <lb/>
            for the passage, when the wind 1 set down the strait; or, perhaps, <lb/>
            having sailed to it in some other way. Even to this day there <lb/>
            are still Sicels in Italy ; and it was in this way that the country <lb/>
            was called Italy, after Italus, a king of the Sicels who had <lb/>
            that name. Having gone, then, to Sicily with a great host, <lb/>
            and being victorious in battle over the Sicanians, they com­ <lb/>
            pelled them to remove to the southern and western parts of it, <lb/>
            and caused the island to be called Sicily, instead of Sicania, <lb/>
            and occupied the best parts of the land; having held them, <lb/>
            after they crossed over, nearly three hundred years before any <lb/>
            Greeks came into Sicily; and still, even to this day, they re­ <lb/>
            tain the central and northern parts of the island. There were <lb/>
            also Phœnicians living 2 around the whole of Sicily, having <lb/>
            occupied promontories on the sea-coast, and the small islands <lb/>
            adjacent, for purposes of trading with the Sicels : but after <lb/>
            the Greeks sailed to it in great numbers by sea, in addition to <lb/>
            those already there, they evacuated the greater part of them, <lb/>
            and lived in Motya, Solois, and Panormus, near the Elymi, <lb/>
            having united with them, both from confidence in their al­ <lb/>
            liance, and because from that quarter the voyage from Sicily <lb/>
            to Carthage is shortest. As regards barbarians, then, so many <lb/>
            of them were there that inhabited Sicily, and in such a <lb/>
            manner.</p>
          <p>3. Of the Greeks, <unclear/>-..n the other hand, some Chalcidians of <lb/>
            Euboea first sailed with Thucles as the leader of the colony, <lb/>
            and founded Naxos, and built the altar to Apollo 3 Archegetes, <note type="footnote">1 Or, " set steadily in that direction," i. e. was favourable </note><note type="footnote"> 11 Or, as Poppo explains it, " all about the whole island." But the words <lb/>

              </note>which is now outside the city, and on which when any deputies <lb/>
              to the games sail from Sicily, they first sacrifice. Syracuse <lb/>
              was founded the next year by Archias, of the family of Her­ <lb/>
              cules at Corinth, after he had first expelled the Sicels from <lb/>
              the island ; on which, being no longer surrounded with water, <lb/>
              the inner city now stands; and at a later period the outer one <lb/>
              also was enclosed within the wall, and became populous. More­ <lb/>
              over, Thucles and the Chalcidians from Naxos set out in the <lb/>
              fifth year after the founding of Syracuse, and having expelled <lb/>
              the Sicels by arms, re-settled Leontini, and after it Catana, <lb/>
              the Catanians themselves having chosen Evarchus as their <lb/>
              founder.</p>
          <p>4. At the same time Lamis arrived in Sicily with a colony <lb/>
            from Megara, and after settling in a place beyond the river <lb/>
            Pantacyas, Trotilus by name, and subsequently removing <lb/>
            thence, and uniting for a short time with the Chalcidians at <lb/>
            Leontini, and being driven out by them, he founded Thapsus, <lb/>
            and then he himself died ; while the rest, being expelled from <lb/>
            Thapsus, effected a settlement at Megara, called the Hyblæan, <lb/>
            Hyblo, a Sicel king, having given up the place to them and <lb/>
            led them in. After inhabiting it two hundred and forty-five <lb/>
            years, they were expelled from the city and country by Gelo, <lb/>
            tyrant of Syracuse. Before their expulsion, however, a hun­ <lb/>
            dred years after their settlement, they founded Selinus, hav­ <lb/>
            ing sent Pamillus for the purpose, who came from Megara, <lb/>
            their mother-city, and joined them in founding it. Gela, <lb/>
            again, was founded by Antiphemus from Rhodes, and Enti­ <lb/>
            mus from Crete, who led a common colony, in the forty- <lb/>
            fifth year after the founding of Syracuse. The name of the <lb/>
            city was taken from the river Gelas, but the spot where "the <lb/>
            city," [properly so called,] now stands, and which was first <lb/>
            fortified, is named 1 Lindii. The institutions established <lb/>
            amongst them were Dorian. Just about a hundred and eight <lb/>
            years after their own settlement, the Geloans settled Acragas, <lb/>
            [or Agrigentum,] naming the city from the river Acragas: <lb/>
            they made Aristonous and Pystilus the leaders of their colony, <lb/>
            and gave it the institutions of the Geloans. Zancle, again, <lb/>
            was originally founded from Cuma, the Chalcidian city in the <lb/>
            country of the Opici, by some freebooters who went there; <note type="footnote">1 " So named because Antiphemus and his Rhodian companions had prin­ <lb/>
            cipally come from Lindus in Rhodes. See Herod. VII. 153. 2."—Arnold- </note><pb n="380"/>

            but afterwards a great number went from Chalcis and the rest <lb/>
            of Eubœa, and shared with them in the occupation of the <lb/>
            land; its founders being Perieres and Cratæmenes, one from <lb/>
            Cuma, the other from Chalcis. As regards its name, it was <lb/>
            at first called Zancle by the Sicels, because the site resembles <lb/>
            a reaping-hook in figure, and the reaping-hook is called by the <lb/>
            Sicels zanclon. Afterwards, these settlers were expelled by <lb/>
            some Samians and other Ionians, who landed in Sicily while <lb/>
            flying from the Medes; and again, Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhe­ <lb/>
            gium, having not long after expelled the Samians, and <lb/>
            colonized their country with a mixed population, changed its <lb/>
            name to Messana, after his own original country.</p>
          <p>5. Himera was founded from Zancle by Euclides, Simus, <lb/>
            and Saco, and most of those who went to the colony were Chal­ <lb/>
            cidians, though there were also united with them some exiles <lb/>
            from Syracuse, who had been defeated in a strife of factions­ <lb/>
            the Mylætidæ, as they are called. The language was a mix­ <lb/>
            ture of the Chalcidian and Dorian; but the Chalcidian were <lb/>
            the prevailing institutions. Acræ and Casmenæ were founded <lb/>
            by the Syracusans; Acræ seventy years after Syracuse, and <lb/>
            Casmenæ nearly twenty years after Acræ. Camarina was <lb/>
            in the first instance founded by the Syracusans, just about a <lb/>
            hundred and thirty-five years after the building of Syracuse, <lb/>
            its founders being Dascon and Menecolus. But the Camarinæ­ <lb/>
            ans having been driven out after a war by the Syracusans on <lb/>
            account of their revolting from them, some time after, Hippo­ <lb/>
            crates, tyrant of Gela, having received their territory as a <lb/>
            ransom for some Syracusan prisoners, himself acting as <lb/>
            founder, re-settled Camarina. And having again been de­ <lb/>
            populated by Gelo, it was settled for the third time by the <lb/>
            Geloans.</p>
          <p>6. So many were the nations of Greeks and barbarians that <lb/>
            inhabited Sicily, and such was the size of the island against <lb/>
            which the Athenians were eager to make an expedition; be­ <lb/>
            ing desirous (to mention their truest motive) of gaining <lb/>
            dominion over the whole of it; but at the same time wishing, <lb/>
            as a plausible pretext, to succour their own kinsmen, and the <lb/>
            allies they had gained besides. Above all, they were insti­ <lb/>
            gated by ambassadors from the Segestans, who had come to <lb/>
            Athens and invoked their aid more earnestly than ever. For <lb/>
            being borderers of the Selinuntines, they had gone to war with <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="margin"> 7.] <lb/>
            </note>them on certain questions respecting marriage rights, and for <lb/>
            some debated territory; and the Selinuntines, having taken <lb/>
            the Syracusans for their allies, were pressing them hard with <lb/>
            hostilities both by land and sea. Consequently the Segestans <lb/>
            reminded the Athenians of their alliance, which had been <lb/>
            formed in the time of Laches and of the former war with the <lb/>
            Leontines, and begged them to send a fleet and assist them; <lb/>
            alleging many other things, and, as the sum and substance of <lb/>
            all, " that if the Syracusans should be unpunished for the de­ <lb/>
            population of Leontini, and, by ruining such of the Athenian <lb/>
            allies as were still left should themselves obtain the whole <lb/>
            power of Sicily; there would be danger of their some time or <lb/>
            other coming with a large force, as Dorians, to the aid of Do­ <lb/>
            rians, on the strength of their connexion, and, moreover, as <lb/>
            colonists, to the aid of the Peloponnesians who had sent them <lb/>
            out, and so joining in the destruction of the Athenian power. <lb/>
            It were wise therefore, in concert with the remaining allies, to <lb/>
            resist the Syracusans; especially as they would themselves <lb/>
            furnish money sufficient for the war." The Athenians, hearing <lb/>
            these things in their assemblies from the Segestans and their <lb/>
            supporters, who were repeatedly alleging them, I passed a de­ <lb/>
            cree on the subject; sending ambassadors, in the first place, to <lb/>
            see about the money, whether it were already laid up, as they <lb/>
            asserted, in the treasury and in the temples, and at the same <lb/>
            time to ascertain what was the state of the war with the Se­ <lb/>
            linuntines.</p>
          <p>7. The ambassadors of the Athenians, then, were thus sent <lb/>
            to Sicily. The same winter, the Lacedæmonians and their allies, <lb/>
            except the Corinthians, having made an expedition into the Ar­ <lb/>
            give territory, ravaged a small part of the land, and took some <lb/>
            yokes of oxen, and carried off some corn. They also settled <lb/>
            the Argive exiles at Orneæ; and having left them a few men <lb/>
            from the rest of their forces also, and made a truce for some <lb/>
            time, on condition of the Orneatæ and the Argives not injur­ <lb/>
            ing each other's land, they returned home with their army. <lb/>
            But the Athenians having come no long time after with thirty <lb/>
            ships and six hundred heavy-armed, the Argives, in con­ <lb/>
            junction with the Athenians, taking the field with all their <lb/>
            force, besieged the men in Orneæ one day; but at night, the <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, " voted to send," &amp;c., according to Bekker's and Poppo's reading of <lb/>

            army having bivouacked at some distance, they escaped out of <lb/>
            it. The next day, the Argives, on finding this, razed Orneæ <lb/>
            and returned, and the Athenians afterwards went home with <lb/>
            their ships. Moreover, the Athenians took by sea some of <lb/>
            their own cavalry, and the Macedonian exiles who were with <lb/>
            them, to Methone, the country bordering on Macedonia, and <lb/>
            ravaged the territory of Perdiccas. The Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            therefore sent to the Chalcidians Thrace-ward, who had a truce <lb/>
            with the Athenians from one ten days to another, and urged <lb/>
            them to join Perdiccas in the war ; but they would not. And <lb/>
            go the winter ended, and the sixteenth year of this war, of <lb/>
            which Thucydides wrote the history.</p>
          <p>8. The following summer, as soon as the spring commenced, <lb/>
            the ambassadors of the Athenians came from Sicily, and the <lb/>
            Segestans with them, bringing sixty talents of uncoined silver, <lb/>
            as a month's pay for sixty ships which they were to beg them <lb/>
            to send. And the Athenians having held an assembly, and <lb/>
            heard from the Segestans and their own ambassadors a seduc­ <lb/>
            tive and untrue report on the other subjects, and also, with re­ <lb/>
            gard to the money, that it was provided in abundance in the <lb/>
            temples and the treasury; they voted to send sixty ships, <lb/>
            with Alcibiades son of Clinias, Nicias son of Niceratus, and <lb/>
            Lamachus son of Xenophanes, as commanders, with full <lb/>
            powers, to assist the Segestans against the Selinuntines, and <lb/>
            to join in re-founding Leontini, should they gain any advan­ <lb/>
            tage in the war, and to carry out all other measures in Sicily, <lb/>
            as they should deem best for the Athenians.—On the fifth day <lb/>
            after this, an assembly was again held, to consider in what <lb/>
            way the preparations for the ships should be most quickly <lb/>
            made, and whatever else was wanted by the generals be voted <lb/>
            them for the expedition. Nicias then, who had been chosen <lb/>
            against his will to take the command, and thought that the <lb/>
            state was not well advised, but, on a trifling and specious pre­ <lb/>
            text, was coveting the whole of Sicily—an arduous design to <lb/>
            achieve-came forward with a wish to divert the Athenians <lb/>
            from it, and advised them to the following effect:</p>
          <p>9. " This assembly was, it is true, convened to consider the <lb/>
            subject of our preparations, namely, in what way we ought to <lb/>
            make the expedition to Sicily. My opinion, however, is, that <lb/>
            we ought still to consider this very point, whether it be better <lb/>
            to send out our ships ; and not on such slight deliberation oil <pb n="383"/>
             <note type="margin">10J <lb/>
            </note>matters of great moment, at the instigation of aliens, to take <lb/>
            upon ourselves a war, with which we have nothing to do. <lb/>
            And yet I, for my own part, receive honour from such a <lb/>
            policy, and have less fear than others for my own personal <lb/>
            safety: (though I consider that man to be an equally good <lb/>
            citizen who takes some forethought both for his person and <lb/>
            his property ; for such a man would, for his own sake, be most <lb/>
            desirous that his country also should prosper:) nevertheless, <lb/>
            neither aforetime have I ever spoken contrary to my con­ <lb/>
            victions, for the sake of being honoured above others, nor <lb/>
            will I now, but as I think best, so will I speak. And though <lb/>
            against your inclinations my words would be powerless, should <lb/>
            I advise you to keep what you have, and not expose your <lb/>
            present possessions to danger for things which are uncertain <lb/>
            and future; yet that neither are you timely in your haste, nor <lb/>
            the objects of your ambition easy to attain, on these points I <lb/>
            will give you instruction.</p>
          <p>10. " I say then, that you wish, though leaving many <lb/>
            enemies behind you here, to bring hither fresh ones besides, <lb/>
            by sailing there. And you fancy, perhaps, that the treaty <lb/>
            that has been made by you affords some ground of confidence. <lb/>
            But though, as long as you remain quiet, that will, indeed, <lb/>
            be a treaty—in name, (for to this condition have certain per­ <lb/>
            sons here and amongst your enemies brought it by their in­ <lb/>
            trigues,) yet if we are ever defeated with any considerable <lb/>
            force, those who hate us will quickly make an attack upon us ; <lb/>
            seeing, in the first place, that the arrangement was made of <lb/>
            necessity by them, under circumstances of disaster, and of <lb/>
            greater discredit to them than to us; and, secondly, that in <lb/>
            this very arrangement we have many subjects open to debate. <lb/>
            There are some, too, who have not yet acceded even to this <lb/>
            composition, such as it is, and those not the least powerful <lb/>
            states; but some of them are at war with us downright, and, <lb/>
            in the case of others, because the Lacedæmonians remain <lb/>
            quiet at present, they too are restrained by truces from one <lb/>
            ten days to another. But probably, if they should find our <lb/>
            power divided, (which we are now so anxious to bring about,) <lb/>
            they would with all their might attack us, in conjunction with <lb/>
            the Siceliots, whose alliance they would in time past have <lb/>
            valued 1most highly. Every one therefore ought to look tc <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally, " above many things.,, Compare I. 33. </note> <pb n="384"/>
            <note type="margin"> [II </note> <lb/>
            this, and not presume to run risks with a state so unsettled, <lb/>
            and to grasp at another empire before we have secured the <lb/>
            one we have ; seeing that the Chalcidians Thrace-ward, though <lb/>
            they have revolted from us so many years, are still unsub­ <lb/>
            dued ; and there are some others on the different coasts of the <lb/>
            mainland who yield us but a doubtful obedience. And so <lb/>
            we are quick to succour the Segestans, who are our allies, for. <lb/>
            sooth, as 'being injured; but on those by whose revolt we have <lb/>
            ourselves long ago been injured, we still defer to avenge our­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>11. " And yet the latter, if subdued, might be kept in sub­ <lb/>
            jection by us ; but the former, even if we conquered them, we <lb/>
            should hardly be able to govern, so far off and so numerous as <lb/>
            they are. But it is folly to go against men whom we could <lb/>
            not keep under, if we conquered them; while, if we did not <lb/>
            succeed in the attempt, we should not be in the same position <lb/>
            as we were before making it. Again, regarding the present <lb/>
            condition of the Siceliots, they appear to me even still less <lb/>
            likely to be formidable to us, if the Syracusans should have <lb/>
            dominion over them; that supposition with which the Seges­ <lb/>
            tans especially try to frighten us. For at present they might, <lb/>
            perhaps, come hither as separate states, to oblige the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians ; but in the other case, it is not likely that they <lb/>
            should undertake the expedition, empire against empire: for <lb/>
            in the same manner as they, in conjunction with the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, had taken away ours, it is probable that they would <lb/>
            have their own taken away by the same Peloponnesians, I and <lb/>
            by the same principle. And the Greeks in those parts would be <lb/>
            most in awe of us, if we did not go there at all; and next to <lb/>
            that, if after making a demonstration of our power we re­ <lb/>
            tired in a short time : but if we should meet with any reverse, <lb/>
            they would very quickly despise us, and attack us in concert <lb/>
            with our enemies here. For we all know that what is farthest <lb/>
            off is most admired, and what gives the least room for having <lb/>
            its fame tested. And this has at present been your case, <lb/>
            Athenians, with reference to the Lacedæmonians and their <lb/>
            allies ; from having, contrary to your expectation, gained the <lb/>
            advantage over them, (comparing your present position with <lb/>
            the fears you at first entertained,) you have despised them, <note type="footnote">1 i. e. their wish to rescue the cities from the yoke of Syracuse, as they <lb/>
            had done from that of Athens </note><pb n="385"/>
             <note type="margin">12, 18.) <lb/>
            </note>ancI are now desiring the conquest of Sicily. You ought not, <lb/>
            however, to be elated through the misfortunes of your adver­ <lb/>
            saries, but then only to feel confident when you have mastered <lb/>
            their spirits ; nor should you think that the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            are doing ought but considering, in consequence of their dis­ <lb/>
            grace, in what way they may even now, if possible, overthrow <lb/>
            us, and bring their own discredit to a happy termination; <lb/>
            especially as they have studied a reputation for bravery, as a <lb/>
            thing of the greatest importance, and for the greatest length of <lb/>
            time. So that our great struggle will be, if we are wise, not <lb/>
            for the Segestans in Sicily, men who are barbarians, but that <lb/>
            we may vigorously guard against a state which is plotting <lb/>
            against us 1by the spread of oligarchical principles.</p>
          <p>12. "We ought to remember, too, that we have but lately <lb/>
            recovered a little from a great pestilence and war, so as to be <lb/>
            somewhat recruited both in our property and persons; and <lb/>
            that it is but fair for us to expend these here at home, on oui­ <lb/>
            . selves, and not on these exiles who are begging your aid; <lb/>
            whose interest it is to utter specious falsehoods, and contend­ <lb/>
            ing at their neighbours' risk, while they themselves only con­ <lb/>
            tribute words, either to show no proper gratitude if they suc­ <lb/>
            ceed, or if in any instance they fail, to ruin their friends along <lb/>
            with them. And if there be any one who is pleased at being <lb/>
            appointed to command, and therefore urges you to make the <lb/>
            expedition, looking to his own interest alone, (especially as he <lb/>
            is yet too young for office,) in order that while he is admired, <lb/>
            for his horse-keeping, he may also receive from his appoint­ <lb/>
            ment some benefit on the score of expense; do not, either, allow <lb/>
            that man to exhibit his own individual splendour at the peril <lb/>
            of the state ; but consider that such men injure the public in­ <lb/>
            terests, while they squander their private possessions ; and that <lb/>
            this is a business of great importance, and not one for a young <lb/>
            man to deliberate upon, and rashly to take in hand.</p>
          <p>13. "I am alarmed, indeed, when I see such characters sit­ <lb/>
            ting here at present by the side of that same individual, in <lb/>
            compliance with his bidding; and in return I bid the older <lb/>
            men—whichever of them may have one of those characters <lb/>
            sitting by him-not to be put down through shame, in order <lb/>
            to avoid being thought a coward if he should not vote for going <note type="footnote">1 Or, as Arnold renders it, "in the way of oligarchy;" i. e. threatening <lb/>

            to war; nor, as their opponents themselves might feel, to be <lb/>
            madly enamoured of what they do not possess; being con­ <lb/>
            vinced that in very few things do men succeed through desire, <lb/>
            but in very many through forethought; but in behalf of their <lb/>
            country, as exposing itself to the greatest danger it has ever <lb/>
            done, to give their support to the opposite side, and vote that <lb/>
            the Siceliots keep the same boundaries with respect to us as at <lb/>
            present-boundaries with which no one can find fault-namely, <lb/>
            the Ionian Sea, if one sail along shore; and the Sicilian, if one <lb/>
            cross the open deep ; and that while they enjoy their own pos­ <lb/>
            sessions, they shall also settle their own quarrels : and that we <lb/>
            tell the Segestans in particular, that since they went to war with <lb/>
            the Selinuntines in the first instance without consulting the <lb/>
            Athenians, they may also make peace with them by them­ <lb/>
            selves : and that we do not in future make alliance, as we have <lb/>
            been accustomed, with men whom we shall assist when they <lb/>
            are unfortunate, and when we ask assistance ourselves, shall <lb/>
            not obtain it.</p>
          <p>14. " And do you, Prytanis, if you think it your duty to care <lb/>
            for the state, and if you wish to show yourself a good citizen, <lb/>
            put this to the vote, and take a second time the opinion of the <lb/>
            Athenians ; reflecting, if you feel afraid to move the question <lb/>
            again, that the violation of the law would not, with so many <lb/>
            abettors, involve any guilt; but that you would be acting as a <lb/>
            physician to the state, when it had taken bad counsel; and <lb/>
            that good government consists in this,-for a man to do his <lb/>
            country as much good as possible, or, at least, to do it volun­ <lb/>
            tarily no harm."</p>
          <p>15. To this effect spoke Nicias. Of the Athenians, the <lb/>
            greater part who came forward advised making the expedition, <lb/>
            and not annulling what had been decreed; though there were <lb/>
            some also who spoke against it. But the man who most earn­ <lb/>
            estly recommended the expedition was Alcibiades son of <lb/>
            Clinias, who at once wished to thwart Nicias—both as being <lb/>
            in other respects opposed to him in politics, and because he had <lb/>
            alluded to him in a disparaging manner-and was most anxious <lb/>
            to take the command, and hoped by that means to reduce Sicily <lb/>
            and Carthage, and at the'same time, in consequence of his <lb/>
            success, to promote his own private interests in point of fame <lb/>
            and wealth. For, being held in high repute by the citizens, <lb/>
            he indulged his inclinations on too large a scale for his exist- <pb n="387"/>
            <note type="margin"> 16.] <lb/>
            </note>ing means, with regard to keeping horses, and all other ex­ <lb/>
            penses. And this too was what afterwards mainly caused <lb/>
            the destruction of the Athenian state. For being alarmed at the <lb/>
            extent of his disregard for the laws in his own person, with <lb/>
            respect to his mode of life, and of his designs in the measures he <lb/>
            severally undertook, in whatever business he might be engaged, <lb/>
            the greater part of the people became his enemies on the belief of <lb/>
            his aiming at tyranny; and though in his public capacity he <lb/>
            conducted the war most ably, yet being severally offended <lb/>
            at his habits in his private life, and committing the adminis­ <lb/>
            tration to others, after no long interval they brought their <lb/>
            country to ruin. However, at that time he came forward, <lb/>
            and advised the Athenians as follows:</p>
          <p>16. "It is both 1befitting, Athenians, for me, more than <lb/>
            others, to enjoy command, (for with this topic must I com­ <lb/>
            mence my speech, since Cleon has attacked me upon it,) and <lb/>
            at the same time, I deem myself worthy of it. For those <lb/>
            things about which 21 am so assailed with clamour, confer <lb/>
            honour on my ancestors and myself, and benefit on my country <lb/>
            at the same time. For the Greeks considered our state to be <lb/>
            greater than they had ever done, even beyond its actual power, <lb/>
            through the splendour of my display as its deputy to the Olympic <lb/>
            games ; (whereas they hoped before that it had been exhausted <lb/>
            by the war;) inasmuch as I entered seven chariots-a number <lb/>
            which no private individual had ever yet entered-and gained <lb/>
            the first prize, and was second and fourth, and provided every <lb/>
            thing else in a style worthy of my victory. For according to <lb/>
            the usual view of them, such things are a subject of honour; <lb/>
            while, from the practice of them, an idea of power is also <lb/>
            formed. And again, whatever distinction I gain at home by <lb/>
            my 3 exhibitions of choruses, or in any other way, it is naturally <lb/>
            envied by my fellow-citizens, but for foreigners 4 this too has <lb/>
            an appearance of power. And this is no useless folly, when a <note type="footnote"> 1 "<foreign xml:lang="grc">προσήκει μοι</foreign>, 'on account of my wealth, birth, and magnificent ex­ <lb/>

            man benefits at his own costs, not himself only, but his country <lb/>
            also. Nor is it unfair for one who prides himself on his own <lb/>
            prosperity, to refuse to be on an equality with the mass ; since <lb/>
            in the same way he who is unfortunate shares his calamities <lb/>
            with no one else. But as we are not courted when in ad­ <lb/>
            versity, by the same rule let a man also submit to be slighted <lb/>
            by the prosperous; or let him treat the unfortunate as on an <lb/>
            equal footing, [when he is in prosperity,] and so claim the like <lb/>
            treatment in return, [when he is himself in adversity]. I know, <lb/>
            however, that men in such circumstances, and all who ever <lb/>
            surpassed others in splendour of any kind, though disliked in <lb/>
            their own life-time, most of all in their dealings with their <lb/>
            equals, and then with the rest of the world also, have yet left to <lb/>
            some of those who came after them a desire to claim connexion <lb/>
            with them, even where there were no grounds for it; and a <lb/>
            subject for glorying to the country they belonged to, not as for <lb/>
            aliens, or offenders, but as for countrymen, who had achieved <lb/>
            glorious things. And in my case, who aim at such things, and <lb/>
            am therefore in private assailed with clamour, consider, with <lb/>
            regard to public affairs, whether I administer them in a man­ <lb/>
            ner inferior to any one else, or not. For having united the most <lb/>
            powerful states of the Peloponnese, without any great danger <lb/>
            or expense to you, I brought the Lacedæmonians to a single <lb/>
            day's struggle for their all at Mantinea; in consequence of <lb/>
            which, although they were victorious in the battle, they do <lb/>
            not ever now feel any firm confidence in themselves.</p>
          <p>17. "In this way, then, did my youth and preternatural <lb/>
            folly, as it is thought, deal with the power of the Peloponne­ <lb/>
            sians by means of suitable arguments; and, 1 gaining credit by <lb/>
            my vehemence, obtained their assent. And now too be not <lb/>
            afraid of it; but while I am still in the flower of it, and <lb/>
            Nicias appears fortunate, avail yourselves fully of the services <lb/>
            of each of us. And with regard to the expedition to Sicily, <lb/>
            change not your determination from an idea that it would be <lb/>
            undertaken against a great power. For it is only with a <lb/>
            mixed rabble that its cities are populous ; and they easily ad­ <lb/>
            mit changes in their government, and adopt new ones. And <lb/>
            for this reason no one is furnished, as though in behalf of his <lb/>
            own country, either with arms for the person, or with ordinary <note type="footnote"><unclear/> 1for other modes of interpreting this sentence, see Poppo's note. </note> <pb n="389"/>

            1 resources, as regards the country; but whatever each one <lb/>
            thinks that he can get from the people, either by persuading <lb/>
            them through his oratory, or by factious measures, and will so <lb/>
            find a home in another land, in case of his not being success­ <lb/>
            ful, with that he provides himself. It is not likely, then, that <lb/>
            a populace of such a character should either listen to any <lb/>
            counsel with one heart, or apply themselves to action in com­ <lb/>
            mon : but they would severally side with whatever was said to <lb/>
            please them; especially if they are torn by factions, as we <lb/>
            hear. Again, with regard to heavy-armed troops, neither <lb/>
            have the Siceliots so many as are boasted of, nor did the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks prove so numerous as they severally reckoned <lb/>
            themselves; but Greece had very much misstated them, and <lb/>
            was with difficulty equipped with them in sufficient numbers <lb/>
            on the outbreak of this war. The states in those parts, then, <lb/>
            from what I learn by report, are of this character, and still <lb/>
            more easy to deal with-for we shall have many barbarians, <lb/>
            who from hatred of the Syracusans will join us in attacking <lb/>
            them-and those here will not prove an obstacle, if you take <lb/>
            a right view of the matter. For our fathers had these very <lb/>
            men, whom they say you would leave behind you in hostility <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐν τη̃ χω̃ρα</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατασκευῑς</foreign>.] " This would refer not only to public <lb/>
            works for the defence of the country, such as forts, or the fortifications of <lb/>
            the city itself, but to what we should call ordinary improvements, such as <lb/>
            roads, bridges, &amp;c., and perhaps ornamental buildings, whether temples or <lb/>
            theatres."—Arnold. I cannot but think that in addition to these objects of <lb/>
            expenditure, if not before them all, reference is made to the slaves, cattle, <lb/>
            and implements, with which the land ought to be stocked, but was not, in <lb/>
            consequence of the unsettled state of the country. As <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδείς</foreign> seems to refer to <lb/>
            individuals, not to states, in the preceding clause, it would naturally refer to <lb/>
            them in this also; as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκαστος</foreign> also does in the following sentence. And with <lb/>
            regard to this signification of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατασκευή</foreign>, it is one which both the noun and <lb/>
            the verb formed from it repeatedly convey in Xenophon's political and <lb/>
            economical treatises; e. g. De Vectigalibus, IV. 11, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅπως θαρσυ̃να ες μὲν</foreign> </note><figure type="illustration">

              uses the verb particularly with reference to slaves, as though they formed the <lb/>
              chief stock in the country, in another speech which he puts into the mouth <lb/>
              of Alcibiades; ch. 91. 7, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οἶς τε. γὰρ ἡχώρα κατεσκεύασται, τὰ πολλὰ <lb/>

              especially the slaves, 'which formed the most valuable and important part, <lb/>
              while a country was in a peaceful and prosperous condition; but one so <lb/>
              likely to be lost in a period of war and revolution, that the Siceliots, accord­ <lb/>
              ing to the view of their unsettled state which Alcibiades here gives, would <lb/>
              have very little inducement to invest their money in them. </note> <pb n="390"/>

              when sailing there, and the Mede beside, as their enemies; <lb/>
              and still they won their empire; though strong in nothing else <lb/>
              but the superiority of their fleet. And as things stand now, <lb/>
              never yet were the Peloponnesians more hopeless with regard <lb/>
              to us: and even if they are ever so confident, for invading our <lb/>
              country indeed they are strong enough, even though we do <lb/>
              not undertake the expedition ; but with their naval force they <lb/>
              cannot hurt us, [though we do undertake it;] for we have <lb/>
              a fleet left behind that is a match for them.</p>
          <p>18. On what reasonable argument, then, could we ourselves <lb/>
            shrink from it; or on what plea addressed to our allies there <lb/>
            could we refuse to succour them ? For since we have entered <lb/>
            into league with them, we ought to assist them, and not to ob­ <lb/>
            ject that they too have not assisted us. For we united them with <lb/>
            us, not that they might come here to help us in their turn, but <lb/>
            that by annoying our enemies there they might prevent their <lb/>
            coming here to attack us. And it is in this way that empire <lb/>
            has been won, both by us and and by all others who have en­ <lb/>
            joyed it; I mean, by readily taking part with those barbari­ <lb/>
            ans or Greeks who from time to time called them to their aid; <lb/>
            since if all should remain quiet, or 1 nicely choose whom they <lb/>
            ought to assist; we should make but slight additions to it, <lb/>
            but should rather run a risk of losing even what it now is. <lb/>
            For men do not only defend themselves against a superior <lb/>
            when he has attacked them, but also strike the first blow, to <lb/>
            prevent his attacking them. And it is not possible for us to <lb/>
            portion out exactly how far we wish to hold dominion ; but <lb/>
            since we are in our present position, we must form designs <lb/>
            against some, and not give up others ; because we should be <lb/>
            subjected to the rule of another party, if we did not ourselves <lb/>
            rule over others. Nor must you take the same view of quiet <lb/>
            as the rest of the world, unless you will also receive fresh in­ <lb/>
            stitutions assimilating to theirs. Considering, then, that we <lb/>
            shall rather aggrandize our possessions here, if we go in quest <lb/>
            of those there, let us make the expedition; that we may both <lb/>
            prostrate the pride of the Peloponnesians, by being seen, re­ <lb/>
            gardless of present peace, to sail even against Sicily ; and at <lb/>
            the same time, by either ruling, as we most probably shall, <lb/>
            over the whole of Greece, through being joined by those there, <lb/>
            or at any rate by injuring the Syracusans, by which both <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, " make distinctions of race in choosing," &amp;c.; according to the <lb/>

            ourselves and our allies will be benefited. And as for secu­ <lb/>
            rity, whether for remaining there, in case of any success, or <lb/>
            for returning, our fleet will provide us with it: for by sea we <lb/>
            shall be superior to all the Siceliots put together. And let not <lb/>
            the non-interfering policy which Nicias recommends in his <lb/>
            speeches, nor his setting the young against the old, divert you <lb/>
            from your purpose; but acting in your usual order, just as <lb/>
            our fathers, by consulting young with old, raised the state to <lb/>
            its present height, do ye now too, in the same manner, endea­ <lb/>
            vour to advance it; being convinced that youth and old age <lb/>
            can do nothing without each other; but that the period of <lb/>
            levity, and of mid-age, and of extreme preciseness, will have <lb/>
            most power when joined together; and that the state, if it re­ <lb/>
            main quiet, will be worn out on itself, like any thing else, and <lb/>
            its skill in every thing grow dull; while by entering into con­ <lb/>
            test it will continually gain fresh experience, and will find <lb/>
            self-defence habitual to it, not in word, but rather in deed. <lb/>
            My decided opinion then is, that I think a state of no inactive <lb/>
            character would most quickly be ruined by a change to inac­ <lb/>
            tivity ; and that those men live most securely, who regulate <lb/>
            their affairs in accordance with their existing habits and insti­ <lb/>
            tutions, even though they may be of an inferior character, <lb/>
            with the least variation."</p>
          <p>19. To this effect spoke Alcibiades. When the Athenians had <lb/>
            heard him and the Segestans and some Leontine exiles, who, <lb/>
            coming forward, begged and entreated them to assist them, re­ <lb/>
            minding them of their oaths, they were much more eager for <lb/>
            the expedition than before. So Nicias, perceiving that he <lb/>
            could not now turn them from it by the same arguments as he <lb/>
            had used before, but might perhaps change their purpose by <lb/>
            the amount of armament, if he should command a numerous <lb/>
            one to be prepared; he came forward again, and addressed <lb/>
            them as follows :</p>
          <p>20. " Since I see you, Athenians, altogether bent on making <lb/>
            the expedition, may these things turn out as we wish: at the <lb/>
            present time, however, I will declare to you what my opinion <lb/>
            is. We are about to go then, as I learn from report, against <lb/>
            cities which are great, and not subject one to another, or in <lb/>
            want of a change, like that by which men would gladly pass <lb/>
            from a state of violent slavery to an easier condition instead <lb/>
            f it; which will reasonably refuse to accept our dominion <pb n="392"/>
             <note type="margin"><unclear>121</unclear> <lb/>
            </note>instead of freedom, and are many in number, considering that <lb/>
            they are in one island, even those of Greek origin. For be­ <lb/>
            sides Naxos and Catana, which I expect will side with us on <lb/>
            the strength of their connexion with Leontini, there are seven <lb/>
            others, and those equipped with every thing in a style just <lb/>
            agreeing with our own power, and most of all, those against <lb/>
            which we are more especially sailing, namely, Selinus and <lb/>
            Syracuse. For there are in them many heavy-armed, and <lb/>
            bowmen, and dartmen, with many triremes, and crowds to <lb/>
            man them. They have money too, partly in private funds, <lb/>
            and partly in the temples also at Selinus; while the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans have also first-fruits paid them by certain barbarian <lb/>
            tribes. But what they most of all excel us in is, that they posses' <lb/>
            many horses, and use corn of native growth, and not imported</p>
          <p>21. " Against such a power then we require, not only 1 a <lb/>
            marine and inefficient armament, but that a large land force <lb/>
            also should sail with us, if we are to achieve any thing suitable <lb/>
            to our design, and are not to be shut out from the land by nu­ <lb/>
            merous cavalry ; especially should the cities league together <lb/>
            in their fear, and none but the Segestans be our friends, <lb/>
            and furnish us with horse, wherewith to defend ourselves. <lb/>
            But it were disgraceful to return by compulsion, or to send for <lb/>
            fresh supplies afterwards, through having inconsiderately <lb/>
            formed our plans at first. On the contrary, we must go <lb/>
            against them with sufficient forces, knowing that we are about <lb/>
            to sail far from our own country, and not on an expedition of <lb/>
            the same kind as when you have gone at different times, in <lb/>
            the character of allies, against any of your subjects in these <lb/>
            parts, where supplies of additional necessaries were easily ob­ <lb/>
            tained from the friendly territory; but departing to a land al­ <lb/>
            together alien to you, from which for 2 as many as four months <lb/>
            in the winter it is not easy for a messenger to come here. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυτικη̄ς καὶ φαύλου στρατια̃ς</foreign>,] i. e, a force consisting only of the few <lb/>

            der them a very inefficient and weak force against the troops of Syracuse, on <lb/>

            which Poppo himself retains, be the correct one, it seems impossible that it <lb/>

          <p>22. " I think therefore that we ought to take many heavy- <lb/>
            armed, both of our own and of our allies, whether those who <lb/>
            are subject to us, or any in the Peloponnese that we may be <lb/>
            able either to prevail upon by argument, or to take into our pay ; <lb/>
            many bowmen also and slingers, to offer resistance to the Si­ <lb/>
            cilian horse; and that in ships we should have a very decided <lb/>
            superiority, in order that we may the more easily bring in <lb/>
            what is necessary: while we take our corn from home also <lb/>
            in merchant vessels, namely, wheat and parched barley, with <lb/>
            bakers from the mills, compelled, in proportion to their num­ <lb/>
            bers, to serve for pay ; that should we any where be detained <lb/>
            by stress of weather, the force may have provisions ; (for so <lb/>
            numerous as it is, it will not be one for every city to receive.) <lb/>
            All other things too we must provide, as far as we can, and <lb/>
            not depend upon others; but, most of all, we must take from <lb/>
            home as much money as possible. For as for that of the Se­ <lb/>
            gestans, which is asserted to be there in readiness, believe <lb/>
            that it is in the way of assertion, more than in any other way, <lb/>
            that it will be ready</p>
          <p>23. " For supposing us to go hence, not only provided on a <lb/>
            scale equal to the enemy, (2 excepting, at least, their heavy- <lb/>
            armed fighting force,) but even surpassing them in all re­ <lb/>
            spects ; yet scarcely even then shall we be able to subdue that <lb/>
            country, and to save this. Indeed we must consider that we <lb/>
            are going to found a city amongst aliens and enemies; and <lb/>
            such men must either, the first day they land, be at once mas­ <lb/>
            ters of the country, or know that if they fail to do so, they <lb/>
            will find every thing opposed to them. For myself then, <lb/>
            being afraid of this, and knowing that on many points we <lb/>
            must take good counsel, and on still more have good luck, <lb/>
            (and that is difficult for such as are but men,) I wish to sail <lb/>
            from home committing myself as little as possible to fortune, <lb/>
            and secured against failure by our preparations, according to <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν δὲ καὶ αύτόθεν σι̃του</foreign>.] Arnold thinks that ToO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίτο</foreign>u would be a <lb/>

            be taken as only distinguishing the class of provisions here spoken of from <lb/>
            another, viz. the corn they took with them, in opposition to that which they <lb/>

            safe for the state at large, and conducive to the preservation <lb/>
            of us who will go on the expedition. But if any one think <lb/>
            otherwise, I resign the command to him."</p>
          <p>24. Thus much spoke Nicias, thinking that he should <lb/>
            either deter the Athenians by the vast scale of his measures, <lb/>
            or that if he were compelled to join the expedition, he should <lb/>
            in this way sail on it most safely. They, however, had not <lb/>
            their desire for the voyage taken from them by the burden­ <lb/>
            some nature of the preparations, but were much more eager <lb/>
            for it than ever ; and the result proved just contrary to what <lb/>
            he had expected ; for it was thought that he had given them <lb/>
            good advice, and that now certainly they would have even <lb/>
            abundant assurance of success. And so all alike were seized <lb/>
            with a longing to go on the expedition: the elder, from a belief <lb/>
            that they should either subdue the places against which they <lb/>
            were about to sail, or that a large force would meet with no <lb/>
            misfortune: those in the prime of life, from a desire of foreign <lb/>
            sights and spectacles, and because they were in good hope of <lb/>
            returning safe from it: the mass of the people and of the sol­ <lb/>
            diery, from thinking that they should both make money at <lb/>
            present, and gain additional power, from which an unfailing <lb/>
            fund for pay would be obtained. So that owing to the excessive <lb/>
            desire of the majority for the measure, even if any one were not <lb/>
            pleased with it, he was afraid that by voting against it he might <lb/>
            appear ill-affected to the state, and therefore held his peace.</p>
          <p>25. At last one of the Athenians came forward, and calling <lb/>
            on Nicias, said that he ought not to make excuses and to pro­ <lb/>
            crastinate, but to say now before them all, what forces the <lb/>
            Athenians should vote him. He then, though reluctantly, <lb/>
            said that he would deliberate more leisurely on the question, in <lb/>
            concert with his colleagues: as far, however, as he saw at pre­ <lb/>
            sent, they should not sail with less than a hundred triremes, <lb/>
            (as many of the Athenian ships as might be thought fit would <lb/>
            carry the heavy infantry, while others must be sent for from <lb/>
            the allies,) with not fewer than five thousand heavy-armed in <lb/>
            all, of the Athenians and the allies, and even more, if at all <lb/>
            possible ; and that 1 they would get ready and take with them <note type="footnote">1 i. e. according to Arnold's explanation, " they, including himself, who <lb/>

            the rest of the armament in proportion, both archers from <lb/>

          <p>26. The Athenians, after hearing him, immediately voted <lb/>
            that the generals should be invested with full powers to make <lb/>
            arrangements, both concerning the number of troops, and <lb/>
            every thing connected with the whole expedition, as they might <lb/>
            judge to be best for Athens. After this, the preparations began <lb/>
            to be made ; and they both sent to the allies, and drew up their <lb/>
            muster-rolls at home. The city had lately recovered itself from <lb/>
            the plague, and from continued hostilities, as regarded both <lb/>
            the number of young men who had grown up, and the accu­ <lb/>
            mulation of money in consequence of the truce; so that every <lb/>
            thing was the more easily provided. And thus they were en­ <lb/>
            gaged in preparations.</p>
          <p>27. In the mean time, of all the stone Mercuries in the city <lb/>
            of Athens, (they are, according to the fashion of the country, <lb/>
            those well-known square figures, numerous both in private <lb/>
            and sacred door-ways,) the greater part had their faces muti­ <lb/>
            lated in one night. The perpetrators of this offence were known <lb/>
            to no one; but search was made for them, with great rewards <lb/>
            for information offered at the public expense. Moreover, <lb/>
            the people voted, that if any one knew any other act of impiety <lb/>
            to have been committed, whoever wished, whether citizen, <lb/>
            alien, or slave, should without fear give information of it. <lb/>
            And they took the matter up more seriously 1 than it deserved; <lb/>
            for it was considered to be an omen of the expedition, and also <lb/>
            to have been done on the strength of a conspiracy for bring­ <lb/>
            ing about a revolution, and for putting down the democracy.</p>
          <p>28. Information therefore was given by some naturalized <lb/>
            aliens, and slaves who were in personal attendance on their <lb/>
            masters, though not at all respecting the Mercuries, yet of <lb/>
            certain mutilations of other images which had before been per­ <lb/>
            petrated by some young men in a drunken frolic: and, more­ <lb/>
            over, that in certain private houses the mysteries were celebrated <lb/>
            in mockery. In this charge they implicated Alcibiades ; and <lb/>
            those took it up who were most hostile to him, as being an ob­ <lb/>
            stacle to their own taking the permanent lead of the people. <note type="footnote"> 1 Or the comparative may, perhaps, mean "more seriously than they <lb/>
            would have done under other circumstances." Or it may be used here, as in <lb/>
            other places, with a force scarcely distinguishable from that of the nositive. </note> <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="margin"> [29. 30. </note> <lb/>
            Thinking therefore, that if they expelled him, they would have <lb/>
            the first place, they magnified the business, and raised an out <lb/>
            cry, to the effect that both the affair of the mysteries and the <lb/>
            mutilation of the Mercuries had been done for the abolition of <lb/>
            democracy; and that there was none of all these things that <lb/>
            had been executed without his assistance : alleging in proof of <lb/>
            the assertion his general contempt for the law in his personal <lb/>
            habits, so opposed to the spirit of democracy.</p>
          <p>29. He at once defended himself against these charges, and <lb/>
            was ready to submit to trial, as to his being guilty of any of <lb/>
            these things, before going on the expedition, (for by this time <lb/>
            all things necessary for the armament had been provided,) and <lb/>
            if he had done any of these things, he was willing to be pun­ <lb/>
            ished ; but if he were acquitted, to take the command. He <lb/>
            protested, too, that they should not listen to slanders against <lb/>
            him in his absence, but put him to death at once if he were <lb/>
            guilty; and that it was more prudent not to send him out at <lb/>
            the head of so large an armament, with such an accusation <lb/>
            attaching to him, before they had decided the question. But <lb/>
            his enemies being afraid of the army, lest he should have its <lb/>
            good wishes, i" at once brought to trial; and lest the people <lb/>
            should relent, who courted him, because for his sake the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives and some of the Mantineans were joining in the expe­ <lb/>
            dition ; they wished to put it off, and earnestly dissuaded the <lb/>
            measure, by bringing forward other orators, who urged that at <lb/>
            present he should sail, and not delay the departure of the army, <lb/>
            but should on his return take his trial within such a number <lb/>
            of days as might be appointed. For they wished to have him <lb/>
            sent for, and brought home for trial on a graver charge, which <lb/>
            they could more easily get up in his absence. Accordingly it <lb/>
            was resolved that Alcibiades should sail.</p>
          <p>30. After this, when it was now midsummer, the departure <lb/>
            for Sicily took place. Now to the greater part of the allies, <lb/>
            with the provision ships, and the smaller craft, and all the <lb/>
            other vessels that accompanied them, orders had before been <lb/>
            given to muster at Corcyra, with a view to their crossing the <lb/>
            Ionian Sea in a body from that place to the Iapygian foreland. <lb/>
            But the Athenians themselves, and such of the allies as were <lb/>
            present, went down to the Piræus on an appointed day, as soon <lb/>
            as it was light, and proceeded to man their ships for the purpose <lb/>
            pf putting out to sea. The whole multitude too, (so to speak,) <pb n="397"/>
            <note type="margin"> 31.J <lb/>
            </note>that was in the city, both of citizens and foreigners, went down <lb/>
            with them. The natives accompanied, respectively, those who <lb/>
            belonged to them, whether friends, kinsmen, or sons; and <lb/>
            went at once with hope and with lamentations; with hope, <lb/>
            that they would attain what they went for; but with lament­ <lb/>
            ation, as doubtful if they should ever again see their friends, <lb/>
            when they remembered on how long a voyage they were set­ <lb/>
            ting out from their country. At the present time too, when <lb/>
            they were now to take leave of each other on a perilous un­ <lb/>
            dertaking, the thought of the dangers struck them more <lb/>
            forcibly than when they were voting for the expedition : <lb/>
            though, nevertheless, they were cheered by the sight of their <lb/>
            present strength, through the numbers of each part of the <lb/>
            armament which they beheld. As to the foreigners, and the <lb/>
            rest of the multitude, they went to see the sight, as that of an <lb/>
            enterprise worthy of their notice, and surpassing belief.</p>
          <p>31. This armament which 1 first sailed out, going from a <lb/>
            single city, and consisting of a Grecian force, was the most <lb/>
            costly and splendid of all up to that time. Yet in number of <lb/>
            ships and of heavy-armed, that against Epidaurus under <lb/>
            Pericles, and the same when going against Potidæa under <lb/>
            Hagnon, was not inferior to this: for there were in it four <lb/>
            thousand heavy-armed of the Athenians themselves, three <lb/>
            hundred horse, and a hundred triremes, with fifty of the <lb/>
            Lesbians and Chians, while many allies besides joined in the <lb/>
            expedition. But they were despatched on a short voyage and <lb/>
            with scanty preparation: whereas this expedition started with <lb/>
            the expectation of its being a long one, and was equipped for <lb/>
            both kinds of service, whichever might be required, with <lb/>
            ships and land forces at the same time. The fleet was elabor­ <lb/>
            ately fitted out, at great expense both on the part of the cap­ <lb/>
            tains and of the state. For the treasury gave a drachma a <lb/>
            day to each seaman, and furnished empty vessels, sixty fast <lb/>
            sailers and forty transports ; while the captains provided the <lb/>
            best crews for them, and gave gratuities in addition to the pay <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρασκευὴ αὓτη πρώτη</foreign>.] 1 nave followed Göller's and Arnold's inter­ <lb/>

            that time.—Unless "primus " is intended by him to express quality, and not <lb/>
            time; which does not seem probable. </note> <pb n="398"/>

            from the treasury, to the 1 thranitæ, and to the petty officers; <lb/>
            and made use besides of expensive ensigns and equipments ; <lb/>
            each one of them being in the highest degree desirous that <lb/>
            his own ship should excel most in beauty and fast sailing. <lb/>
            The land forces, on the other hand, were selected from the best <lb/>
            muster-rolls, and vied with each other in great attention to <lb/>
            their arms and personal accoutrements. The consequence <lb/>
            was, that there was at once a rivalry amongst themselves, in <lb/>
            the arm of the service to which they were severally appointed ; <lb/>
            and that with the rest of the Greeks it was imagined to be a <lb/>
            display of power and resources, rather than an armament <lb/>
            raised against an enemy. For if any one had reckoned the <lb/>
            public expenditure of the state, and the private outlay of in­ <lb/>
            dividuals ; with regard to the state, what sums it had already <lb/>
            spent upon it, and what it was sending out in the hands of the <lb/>
            generals ; and with regard to individuals, what each had laid <lb/>
            out on his personal equipment, and, in the case of a captain, on <lb/>
            his ship, with what he was likely to lay out still; and, more­ <lb/>
            over, what it was probable that every one had provided, in­ <lb/>
            dependently of his pay from the treasury, towards the expenses <lb/>
            of a voyage expected to be so long; and what each soldier or <lb/>
            trader took with him for the purpose of exchange; [if all <lb/>
            these sums, I say, had been calculated,] it would have been <lb/>
            found that many talents in all were being taken out of the city. <lb/>
            And the expedition was no less celebrated through men's <lb/>
            astonishment at its boldness, and the splendour of its appear­ <lb/>
            ance, than for the superiority of the armament, compared with <lb/>
            those whom they were going to attack; and from the fact of <lb/>
            its being the longest passage from their own country that had <lb/>
            hitherto been undertaken, and with the greatest hope of future <lb/>
            advantages in comparison with their present means.</p>
          <p>32. Now when the ships were manned, and every thing <lb/>
            was put on board that they meant to set sail with, silence <lb/>
            was proclaimed by trumpet, and they offered the prayers <lb/>
            which are usual before putting out to sea; not ship by ship <lb/>
            singly, but all together, responding to a herald; having mixed <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρανίταις</foreign>,] i. e. the highest of the three banks of rowers in a trireme, <lb/>
            whose labour was greater in proportion to the greater length of the oars they <lb/>

            of the sailors," and Poppo agrees with him, if the text be allowed to be <lb/>
            sound. I have followsd Arnold's interpretation. See his note on the <lb/>
            passage. </note> <pb n="399"/>

            </note>bowls of wine through the whole armament, and both seamen <lb/>
            and their officers making oblations with gold and silver goblets. <lb/>
            They were joined also in their prayers by the rest of the mul­ <lb/>
            titude. on shore, both the citizens and whoever else was there <lb/>
            that wished them well. When they had sung their hymn, <lb/>
            and finished their libations, they weighed anchor; and having <lb/>
            at first sailed out in a column, they then raced each other as <lb/>
            far as Ægina. And thus they hastened to reach Corcyra, <lb/>
            where the remaining force of the allies was also assembling.</p>
          <p>Now tidings of the expedition were brought to Syracuse from <lb/>
            many quarters, but for a long time received no credit at all. <lb/>
            Nay, even when an assembly was held on the subject, both by <lb/>
            others were speeches to the following effect delivered, (some <lb/>
            believing the report of the Athenian expedition, while some <lb/>
            contradicted it,) and Hermocrates, the son of Hermon, coming <lb/>
            forward to them, from a conviction that he had accurate in­ <lb/>
            formation on the subject, addressed to them the following <lb/>
            advice:</p>
          <p>33. " I shall, perhaps, appear to you, as some others have <lb/>
            done, to speak what is incredible concerning the reality of the <lb/>
            expedition that is coming against us : and I know that those <lb/>
            who either make statements, or bring reports, which do not <lb/>
            seem to be credible, not only fail to convince, but are also <lb/>
            thought to be foolish. Nevertheless I will not, through fear of <lb/>
            this, hold my tongue when the state is in danger, since I am <lb/>
            myself at any rate persuaded that I speak with more cer­ <lb/>
            tain knowledge than others. For the Athenians, much as you <lb/>
            are surprised at it, have set out against us with a large force <lb/>
            both for sea and land service, nominally, on account of an al­ <lb/>
            liance with the Segestans, and for the purpose of settling the <lb/>
            Leontines, but really through desire for Sicily, and most of all, <lb/>
            for our city, thinking that if they get this, they will easily get <lb/>
            the rest also. With a conviction, then, that they will quickly <lb/>
            be here, consider how with your present resources you may <lb/>
            best defend yourselves, and may neither through despising the <lb/>
            matter be taken off your guard, nor through disbelieving it <lb/>
            neglect the common weal. But if, on the other hand, I appear <lb/>
            to any one to speak credibly, let him not be struck with con­ <lb/>
            sternation at their boldness and power. For neither will they <lb/>
            be able to do us more harm than they receive, nor, because they <lb/>
            are coming against us with a great armament, are they on that <pb n="400"/>
            <note type="margin"> I 34. </note> <lb/>
            account without advantage for us; but it is much better with <lb/>
            respect to the rest of the Siceliots, (for they will be the more <lb/>
            willing, in their consternation, to join our alliance,) and in <lb/>
            case of our either defeating them, or repulsing them without <lb/>
            their obtaining the objects of their ambition, (for certainly I am <lb/>
            not afraid of their gaining what they expect,) it will prove the <lb/>
            most glorious achievement for us, and one which, by me at <lb/>
            least, is not unexpected. For few have been the great arma­ <lb/>
            ments, either of Greeks or barbarians, which have gone far <lb/>
            from home and proved successful. For they come not in <lb/>
            greater numbers than the natives of the country and those <lb/>
            who live near to it, (since all league together through fear,) <lb/>
            and if they fail through want of provisions in a foreign land, <lb/>
            even though they fail chiefly through their own fault, they <lb/>
            nevertheless leave a proud name to those who were the ob­ <lb/>
            jects of their attack. Just as these very Athenians, when the <lb/>
            Mede, contrary to expectation, was so signally defeated, grew <lb/>
            great on the strength of the report, that it was against Athens <lb/>
            that he had come. And there is reason for hoping that in <lb/>
            our case the result may be the same.</p>
          <p>34. " With good courage, then, let us both make our pre­ <lb/>
            parations here, and send to the Sicels, to strengthen the at­ <lb/>
            tachment of some of them, and endeavour to enter into friend­ <lb/>
            ship and alliance with others; while we despatch envoys to <lb/>
            the rest of Sicily, to prove that the danger is common to all; <lb/>
            and to Italy, that either we may gain their alliance for our­ <lb/>
            selves, or they may refuse to receive the Athenians. I think <lb/>
            it better, too, that we should also send to Carthage. For this <lb/>
            is nothing unexpected by them; but they are always in fear <lb/>
            that they may some time or other find the Athenians coming <lb/>
            against their country ; and therefore thinking, perhaps, that <lb/>
            if they abandoned these places, they would themselves be <lb/>
            brought into trouble, they might be willing to assist us; at <lb/>
            least secretly, if not openly; or at any rate in some way or <lb/>
            other. And they are more able to do it, if they please, than <lb/>
            any men of the present day; for they possess most gold and <lb/>
            silver; and it is by means of these that war, like every thing <lb/>
            else, prospers. Let us likewise send to Lacedremon and <lb/>
            Corinth, begging them to come hither to our aid us quickly as <lb/>
            possible, and to stir up the war there. And what I think the <lb/>
            most expedient course, though you, through your habitual <pb n="401"/>
            <note type="margin"> 34.] <lb/>
            </note>love of quiet, would be least quickly persuaded to adopt it, <lb/>
            shall, notwithstanding that, be mentioned. If then we <lb/>
            Siceliots—all in one body, if possible; but if not, as many as <lb/>
            possible in concert with us-would launch the whole of our <lb/>
            present navy, with two months' provisions, and go to meet the <lb/>
            Athenians at Tarentum and the Iapygian foreland, and show <lb/>
            them that they will not have to fight about Sicily before they <lb/>
            have fought for their own passage over the Ionian Sea; we <lb/>
            should strike them with the greatest fear, and set them on <lb/>
            considering that we are starting from a friendly country as its <lb/>
            guardians, (for Tarentum is ready to receive us,) but that for <lb/>
            them the tract of open sea is a wide one to cross with all their <lb/>
            armament; which would hardly remain in order through so <lb/>
            long a voyage, and would be easily attacked by us, while it <lb/>
            came on slowly and in small divisions. But supposing, on <lb/>
            the other hand, that, having lightened their ships, they should <lb/>
            attack us with the better sailing part of their fleet in a more <lb/>
            compact body; then, if they use their oars, we shall fall on <lb/>
            them when they are wearied ; or if we should not choose to do <lb/>
            so, we may also retire to Tarentum : while they, having <lb/>
            crossed with few provisions, on purpose for an engagement, <lb/>
            would be at a loss what to do in uninhabited regions; and <lb/>
            would either be blockaded, if they remained, or if they at­ <lb/>
            tempted to sail along the coast, would abandon the rest of their <lb/>
            armament, and would be dispirited, from having no certainty <lb/>
            whether the cities would receive them or not. I therefore, for <lb/>
            my part, am of opinion, that being deterred by this consider­ <lb/>
            ation, they would not so much as put out from Corcyra; but <lb/>
            would either, after deliberating and reconnoitring how many <lb/>
            we are, and in what position, be driven on by the season of <lb/>
            the year into winter; or, in consternation at the unexpected <lb/>
            result, break up the expedition: especially since the most <lb/>
            skilful of their generals, as I hear, is taking the command <lb/>
            against his will, and would gladly seize an excuse to return, <lb/>
            if any considerable resistance were seen on our part. We <lb/>
            should be reported too, I am quite sure, 1 as being more than <lb/>
            we really are: and in accordance with what is told them are <lb/>
            men's feelings also affected ; and of those who are beforehand <lb/>
            in attacking, or, at any rate, let those who are going to attack <note type="footnote"> Literally, " on the side of more, or excess;" like <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπι</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ τὶζου</foreign>, 1. 10. 3 </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 n </note> <pb n="402"/>

            them see beforehand that they will defend themselves, they <lb/>
            stand in greater fear, considering them equal to the danger <lb/>
            And this would be the case now with the Athenians. Foi <lb/>
            they are coming against us with a belief that we shall offer <lb/>
            no resistance; with good reason contemning us, because we <lb/>
            did not join the Lacedæmonians in destroying them. But if <lb/>
            they saw us acting with courage beyond their expectation, <lb/>
            they would be more dismayed at that unlooked-for result, than <lb/>
            at the power which we really possess. Be persuaded, there­ <lb/>
            fore to show this boldness, if possible; but if not, then, as <lb/>
            quickly as possible, to get ready all other resources for the <lb/>
            war; and to think, every one of you, that contempt for your <lb/>
            assailants is best shown by bravery of deeds ; but that, for the <lb/>
            present, to consider those preparations most safe which are <lb/>
            made with a feeling of fear, and to act as in a season of <lb/>
            danger, would prove most to your advantage. For those men <lb/>
            are both coming against us, and already, I know for certain, <lb/>
            on their voyage, and all but here."</p>
          <p>35. Such was the speech of Hermocrates. But the people <lb/>
            of Syracuse were at great strife one with another; some main­ <lb/>
            taining that the Athenians would by no means come, and that <lb/>
            what he said was not the truth ; others asking what they <lb/>
            could do, if they did come, which they would not suffer on a <lb/>
            larger scale in return. Others, again, treated the matter with <lb/>
            utter contempt, and turned it to ridicule; while there were <lb/>
            but few who believed Hermocrates, and were afraid of what <lb/>
            was coming. Athenagoras, who was a leader of the people, <lb/>
            and most influential with the multitude at the present time, <lb/>
            then came forward to them and spoke as follows :</p>
          <p>36. " With regard to the Athenians, whoever does not <lb/>
            wish them to be so senseless, and to be reduced into subjection <lb/>
            to us by coming here, is either a coward, or ill affected towards <lb/>
            his country. But with regard to those who bring such tidings, <lb/>
            and fill you with such excessive fear, I wonder at them, not <lb/>
            for their audacity, but for their folly, if they imagine that they <lb/>
            are not seen through. For being afraid themselves, they wish to <lb/>
            throw the whole city into consternation, in order that they <lb/>
            may get their own terror thrown into the shade by the general <lb/>
            alarm. And now this is the real value of these reports: they <lb/>
            do not arise in a natural way, but are concocted by men who <lb/>
            are always raising commotions here. But you, if well advised, <pb n="403"/>
             <note type="margin">37, 38.] <lb/>
            </note>will not look at and estimate probabilities by the news which <lb/>
            these persons bring, but by what men of talent and great ex­ <lb/>
            perience, as I presume the Athenians are, would be likely to <lb/>
            do. For it is not probable that they, leaving the Peloponne­ <lb/>
            sians behind them, and not having yet brought the war at <lb/>
            home to a sure conclusion, should voluntarily come here for <lb/>
            another no less arduous ; since, in my opinion, they are quite <lb/>
            contented that Me, with so many and so great cities as we have, <lb/>
            are not going against them.</p>
          <p>37. " But, indeed, if they should come, as they are said to <lb/>
            be coming, I consider Sicily more competent to bring the war <lb/>
            to a termination than the Peloponnese, (inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            better provided in all respects,) and our city by itself far <lb/>
            stronger than the army which is now, as they say, coming <lb/>
            against us, even though it came twice as large as it is. For I <lb/>
            know that neither will any horses accompany them, or be pro­ <lb/>
            vided for them here, except some few from the Segestans, nor <lb/>
            heavy-armed equal in number to our own, coming, as they <lb/>
            must have done, on board ship. For it is a great thing for <lb/>
            even the ships themselves, lightly laden, to perform so long a <lb/>
            voyage hither; and for all the other provisions required <lb/>
            against such a city, (which will be no few,) to be furnished. So <lb/>
            far then am I from believing this, that I think if they came <lb/>
            with another city as large as Syracuse in their possession, and <lb/>
            living there on our borders carried on the war, they would <lb/>
            hardly avoid utter ruin: much less then, surely, with the <lb/>
            whole of Sicily hostile to them, (for it will league together ;) <lb/>
            and with an army established in the country from on board <lb/>
            ship; and while they are not permitted by our cavalry to ad - <lb/>
            vance far from their wretched tents, and such poor equip. <lb/>
            ments as they are compelled to put up with. In short, I do <lb/>
            not think they would even effect a landing ; so far superior do <lb/>
            I consider our forces to be.</p>
          <p>38. " But the Athenians, as I tell you, being aware of this, <lb/>
            are engaged, I am well assured, in preserving their own pos­ <lb/>
            sessions ; and it is persons here that are making up these stories <lb/>
            of what neither is, nor could ever be, the case. And I am not <lb/>
            now for the first time convinced of them, but have ever been <lb/>
            no, that they wish to terrify your populace by such tales as <lb/>
            these, and still more wicked ones, if not even by deeds; <note type="footnote">2 D 2 </note><pb n="404"/>
             <note type="margin">[39. </note> <lb/>
            and so themselves to have the rule of the city. And in truth <lb/>
            I am afraid, lest some time or other, by making many at­ <lb/>
            tempts, they should even succeed; while we are ill disposed, <lb/>
            before we are in the act of suffering, to take precautionary <lb/>
            measures against them, and after finding them out, to proceed <lb/>
            against them. And so by these means our city is seldom at <lb/>
            rest, but is involved in many feuds and conflicts—not more <lb/>
            frequently with its enemies than with itself-and sometimes <lb/>
            in tyrannies and unprincipled cabals. But I will endeavour, <lb/>
            if only you will follow my advice, to let none of these things <lb/>
            occur in our time ; by convincing you who form the mass of <lb/>
            the people, and by chastising those who plot such things; not <lb/>
            only when convicted in the act, (for it is difficult so to catch <lb/>
            them,) but also for what they have the wish, though not the <lb/>
            power, to do. For we must avenge ourselves on our enemy, <lb/>
            not only for what he does, but beforehand also, for his in­ <lb/>
            tention to do it; inasmuch as if we are not first in guarding <lb/>
            against him, we shall be first in suffering. With regard to <lb/>
            the oligarchs, on the other hand, I shall reprove them on some <lb/>
            points, watch them on others, and warn them on others ; for in <lb/>
            this way I think I shall best deter them from their evil practices. <lb/>
            And, indeed, what is it (a question which I have often asked) <lb/>
            that ye really wish, ye young men ? Is it to enjoy power at <lb/>
            once ? But that is not lawful; and. that law was so enacted <lb/>
            in consequence of your incompetency, rather than with a <lb/>
            wish to degrade you when competent for the task. Well then, <lb/>
            is it to avoid being under the same laws with the people at <lb/>
            large ? And how then is it right for the same people not <lb/>
            to be thought worthy of the same privileges ?</p>
          <p>39. " Some one will say, that a democracy is neither a sensi­ <lb/>
            ble nor an equitable thing, but that those who have property <lb/>
            are also most competent to rule best. But I say, in the first <lb/>
            place, that ' democracy' is a name for all, but ' oligarchy' for <lb/>
            only a part; and, in the second place, that though the rich are <lb/>
            the best guardians of property, the intelligent would be the <lb/>
            best counsellors, and the mass of the people the best judges <lb/>
            after hearing measures discussed; and that all these things, <lb/>
            both severally and collectively, have their due share allotted <lb/>
            to them in a democracy. An oligarchy, on the other hand, <lb/>
            admits, indeed, the many to a share of dangers, but of advan- <lb/>

            gages it not only enjoys the larger part, but even takes away and <lb/>
            keeps the whole. And this is what the powerful and young <lb/>
            among you desire-a thing impossible to attain in a great city.</p>
          <p>40. " Nay then at length, even now, 1 0 ye dullest of all <lb/>
            men—(for of all the Greeks I know, are you either most sense­ <lb/>
            less, if you are not sensible that you are coveting evil things ; <lb/>
            or most unprincipled, if you know it, and still dare to pursue <lb/>
            hem:)—nay then, I say, either acquire that knowledge, or <lb/>
            tange those principles, and so advance the interest of the <lb/>
            ity, which is the common interest of all. For consider, that <lb/>
            those who are good among you will share that in an equal, or <lb/>
            even greater degree, than the mass of the people in the city; <lb/>
            but that if you wish any thing else, you run a risk of being <lb/>
            deprived of all. And have done with such reports as these, <lb/>
            knowing that they are brought to those who are aware of, <lb/>
            and will not tolerate, your designs. For this city, even if the <lb/>
            Athenians are coming, will resist them in a manner worthy of <lb/>
            itself; and we have generals who will look to these matters. <lb/>
            And if none of the reports be true, (which is my opinion,) it <lb/>
            will not lay a voluntary slavery on itself, by being panic-struck <lb/>
            at your intelligence, and by choosing you as its rulers; but <lb/>
            will look at the circumstances itself, and consider the words <lb/>
            spoken by you as equivalent to deeds ; and will not be deprived <lb/>
            of its present liberty by listening to you, but will endeavour to <lb/>
            preserve it by being cautious in its actions, and not allowing <lb/>
            you to go unpunished."</p>
          <p>41. To this effect spoke Athenagoras. One of the generals <lb/>
            then rose up, and would no longer permit any one else to <lb/>
            come forward, but himself spoke on the subject before them to <lb/>
            the following effect: " It is neither prudent for any parties to <lb/>
            utter calumnies against each other, nor for those who hear them <lb/>
            to admit them ; but rather to see, with regard to the intelli­ <lb/>
            gence brought to us, how we may prepare, both each man <lb/>
            severally and the whole city together, to defend ourselves well <lb/>
            against the invaders. And even supposing it not to be re­ <lb/>
            quired, there is no harm, at any rate, in the state being equip­ <lb/>
            ped with horses, and arms, and every thing else in which war <lb/>
            rejoices. And we ourselves will undertake to attend to and <note type="footnote"> I have attempted to translate this passage as it is found in the MSS., <lb/>
            but must refer to the different editors for the emendations which they pro <lb/>
            pose for what they all agree in thinking the corrupt part of it. </note> <pb n="406"/>
            <note type="margin"> [42,43. </note> <lb/>
            examine these things, and to send round to the cities, both for <lb/>
            observation, and whatever else may appear to be expedient. <lb/>
            To some of them, indeed, we have already attended; and <lb/>
            whatever we discover, we will lay before you." After the ge­ <lb/>
            neral had said thus much, the Syracusans departed from the <lb/>
            assembly.</p>
          <p>42. Now the Athenians were by this time at Corcyra, <lb/>
            themselves and all their allies. And in the first place, the <lb/>
            generals reviewed the armament a second time, and made their <lb/>
            dispositions, as they were to come to their moorings, and to <lb/>
            form their camp; making three squadrons, and allotting one to <lb/>
            each of their body, that they might not, by sailing in com­ <lb/>
            pany, be at a loss for water, and ports, and provisions, on their <lb/>
            touching any where; and that they might in other respects <lb/>
            be more orderly and easy to control, by being put under a <lb/>
            particular commander, according to the several squadrons. <lb/>
            They next sent forward three ships to Italy and Sicily, to as­ <lb/>
            certain which of the cities would receive them; with orders <lb/>
            to come out again and meet them, that they might know this <lb/>
            when they put in.</p>
          <p>.43. After this, the Athenians at length weighed anchor, <lb/>
            and proceeded to cross over from Corcyra to Sicily, with the <lb/>
            following force; viz.—a hundred and thirty-four triremes, in <lb/>
            all, and two Rhodian fifty-oared galleys ; (a hundred of these <lb/>
            were Athenian vessels, sixty of which were fast sailers, the <lb/>
            rest troop ships; the remainder of the fleet being composed <lb/>
            of Chians, and the other allies ;) of heavy-armed, in all, <lb/>
            five thousand one hundred, (of which there were raised by <lb/>
            the Athenians themselves fifteen hundred, and seven hundred <lb/>
            1 Thetes serving as Epibatæ on board the ships; the rest of <lb/>
            those who joined the expedition being allies, some of them <lb/>
            sent by their subjects, others by the Argives, to the number <lb/>
            of five hundred, with two hundred and fifty Mantineans, who <lb/>
            were also mercenaries;) of archers, in all, four hundred and <lb/>
            eighty, (eighty of which were Cretans ;) of Rhodian slingers, <lb/>
            seven hundred ; of light-armed Megareans, who were exiles, <lb/>
            one hundred and twenty; and one horse transport, carrying <lb/>
            thirty horses. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">θη̃τες</foreign>,] i. e. men included in the lowest of the four classes into which <lb/>
            Solon divided the Athenian people, and which consisted of all whose land <lb/>
            brought in less than two hundred mediani of corn yearly. See note 1, p. 167 </note> <pb n="407"/>
            <note type="margin"> 14, 45.] </note> </p>
          <p>44. Such was the amount of the first armament which <lb/>
            sailed over for the war. For these troops thirty ships of <lb/>
            burden, laden with corn, carried provisions, with the bakers, <lb/>
            stone-masons, carpenters, and all the tools for building fortifi­ <lb/>
            cations ; and also one hundred boats, which, together with <lb/>
            the ships of burden, were pressed into the service; while many <lb/>
            other boats and ships of burden followed the armament volun­ <lb/>
            tarily, for purposes of commerce; all of which proceeded at <lb/>
            that time to cross the Ionian Gulf from Corcyra. When the <lb/>
            whole armament had made the coast at the Iapygian foreland, <lb/>
            and Tarentum, and as they severally could, they sailed along <lb/>
            the coast of Italy, as the cities did not afford them a market, <lb/>
            or the protection of their walls, but only water and anchorage, <lb/>
            (and Tarentum and Locri not even these,) until they came to <lb/>
            Rhegium, a promontory of Italy. There they at once mus­ <lb/>
            tered, and pitched a camp outside the city, (as they would not <lb/>
            receive them within the walls,) in the sacred enclosure of <lb/>
            Diana, where they afforded them a market; and having drawn <lb/>
            up their ships ashore, they remained quiet. They then en­ <lb/>
            tered into communication with the Rhegians, calling upon <lb/>
            them, as Chalcidians, to assist the Leontines, who were Chal­ <lb/>
            cidians also. They, however, said that they would join nei­ <lb/>
            ther party, but whatever the rest of the Italiots should collec­ <lb/>
            tively determine, that they would do. The Athenians then <lb/>
            turned their attention to the state of things in Sicily, con­ <lb/>
            sidering in what way they would best deal with them; and at <lb/>
            the same time were waiting for the arrival from Segesta of <lb/>
            the ships which had been sent on in advance; wishing to <lb/>
            know respecting the money, whether there were such a sum <lb/>
            as the messengers stated at Athens.</p>
          <p>4.5. To the Syracusans, in the mean time, reports were <lb/>
            being brought from all quarters, and from those who had been <lb/>
            sent by them to reconnoitre came positive intelligence that the <lb/>
            ships were at Rhegium ; and on the belief of this, they began <lb/>
            to make preparations with all their heart, and were no longer <lb/>
            incredulous. Accordingly they sent about to the Sicels, in <lb/>
            some cases, guards; in others, ambassadors ; and were putting <lb/>
            garrisons into the stations of the I peripoli in their country ; <lb/>
            while in their city they were seeing if the equipments were <note type="footnote"> See note p. 266 </note><pb n="408"/>
             <note type="margin">46,47 </note> <lb/>
            complete, by examining arms and horses; and were settling <lb/>
            every thing else, in expectation of a war that was quickly <lb/>
            coming on them, and all but present.</p>
          <p>46. Now the three ships sent on in advance came from <lb/>
            Segesta to the Athenians at Rhegium, with tidings that the <lb/>
            other money which they had promised was not there, but that <lb/>
            only thirty talents were to be seen. The generals then were <lb/>
            immediately in a state of great despondency, because this <lb/>
            their first hope had disappointed them; as had the Rhegians <lb/>
            also, by their unwillingness to join their standard-the people <lb/>
            they had first attempted to persuade, and for whom it was <lb/>
            most natural to assist them, as they were of the same race as <lb/>
            the Leontines, and always favourably disposed towards them­ <lb/>
            selves. Nicias, indeed, was prepared for the tidings from the <lb/>
            Segestans, but by the other two it was quite unexpected. For <lb/>
            the Segestans had recourse to the following contrivance, at <lb/>
            the time when the first envoys of the Athenians came to them <lb/>
            to see the state of their funds. They took them to the temple <lb/>
            of Venus at Eryx, and showed them the treasures deposited <lb/>
            there, consisting of bowls, wine-ladles, censers, and other <lb/>
            articles of furniture in no small quantity; which being made <lb/>
            of silver, presented, with a value really trifling, a much greater <lb/>
            show of wealth. And in their private receptions of the tri­ <lb/>
            remes' crews, having collected the cups both of gold and silver <lb/>
            that were in Segesta itself, and borrowed those in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring cities, whether Phœnician or Grecian, they each <lb/>
            brought them to the entertainments, as their own. And thus, <lb/>
            as all used pretty nearly the same, and great numbers of them <lb/>
            were every where seen, it created much astonishment in the <lb/>
            Athenians from the triremes ; and on their arrival at Athens <lb/>
            they spread it abroad that they had seen great wealth. Those, <lb/>
            then, who had been themselves thus outwitted, and had at that <lb/>
            time persuaded the rest, were severely blamed by the soldiers, <lb/>
            when the report went abroad that there was not at Segesta <lb/>
            the money they had expected.</p>
          <p>47. The generals now took counsel on the present state of <lb/>
            affairs The opinion of Nicias was, that they should sail to <lb/>
            Selinus with all their forces, that being the object for which <lb/>
            they had, most of all, been sent: and in case of the Segestans <lb/>
            supplying money for the whole armament, that then they <lb/>
            should determine accordingly; otherwise, that they should <pb n="409"/>
             <note type="margin">48, 40.] </note> <lb/>
            beg them to give provisions for their sixty ships, the number <lb/>
            which they had asked for, and remaining there should bring <lb/>
            the Selinuntines to terms with them, either by force or by <lb/>
            treaty; and so, after coasting along by the other cities, and <lb/>
            displaying the power of the Athenian state, as well as proving <lb/>
            their zeal in the cause of their friends and allies, they should sail <lb/>
            back home —(unless they should be able, on a sudden, and <lb/>
            without expecting it, either to do the Leontines service, or <lb/>
            to bring over some of the other cities;)—and not expose their <lb/>
            state to danger by spending its own resources.</p>
          <p>48. Alcibiades, on the other hand, said that they ought <lb/>
            not, after sailing from home with so large a force, to return <lb/>
            with dishonour and without effecting their purpose; but to <lb/>
            send heralds to all the other cities, except Selinus and <lb/>
            Syracuse, and endeavour also to get some of the Sicels to re­ <lb/>
            volt from the Syracusans, and to gain the friendship of others <lb/>
            amongst them, with a view to obtaining corn and troops ; but <lb/>
            first of all to win over the Messanians ; (for they lay just in <lb/>
            the passage and approach to Sicily, and there would be a har­ <lb/>
            bour for them there, and the most suitable station for observ­ <lb/>
            ing the enemy.) When, then, they had brought over the <lb/>
            cities, and knew with whose assistance they would carry on <lb/>
            the war, then they should attack Syracuse and Selinus, if the <lb/>
            latter did not come to terms with Segesta, and the former <lb/>
            permit them to settle the Leontines.</p>
          <p>49. Lamachus, again, urged that they ought to sail straight <lb/>
            to Syracuse, and immediately fight the battle under the walls <lb/>
            of the city, while the inhabitants were most unprepared and <lb/>
            panic-struck. For every armament was most formidable in <lb/>
            the first instance ; but if it spent much time before coming <lb/>
            into sight, men grew bold again in spirit, and felt more con­ <lb/>
            tempt for it even on its appearance. If, then, they attacked <lb/>
            them on a sudden, while they were still with terror looking <lb/>
            for them, they would gain the most decided advantage over <lb/>
            them, and strike fear into them in every way; by their sight <lb/>
            of the forces, (for they would appear most numerous at the <lb/>
            present time,) by their expectation of what they would <lb/>
            suffer, and, most of all, by the immediate peril of the en­ <lb/>
            gagement. It was probable, too, that many would be sur­ <lb/>
            prised outside the city in consequence of their not believing <pb n="410"/>
            <note type="margin"> [50 <lb/>
            </note>that they would come; or, 1 if they were now carrying in <lb/>
            their effects, yet the army would be in no want of property, if <lb/>
            it sat down in superior force before the city. And so the <lb/>
            rest of the Siceliots would then the more shrink from entering <lb/>
            into alliance with the Syracusans, and join the Athenians ; and <lb/>
            would not put off, while they waited to see which party would <lb/>
            be the stronger. As for a naval station, he said that after <lb/>
            retiring [from before Syracuse,] and bringing their ships to <lb/>
            anchor, they should establish one at Megara; which was an <lb/>
            uninhabited place, at no great distance from Syracuse either <lb/>
            by sea or land.</p>
          <p>50. Though Lamachus spoke to this effect, he nevertheless <lb/>
            gave his support to the opinion of Alcibiades. After this, <lb/>
            Alcibiades sailed across in his own ship to Messana, and made <lb/>
            proposals to them for forming an alliance; but when he did <lb/>
            not prevail on them, but they answered that they could not <lb/>
            receive him within their city, though they would afford him a <lb/>
            market outside, he sailed back again to Rhegium. Then the <lb/>
            generals immediately joined in manning sixty ships out of the <lb/>
            whole number, and, taking provisions for them, coasted along <lb/>
            to Naxus, leaving the rest of the armament at Rhegium with <lb/>
            one of their own body. On the Naxians' receiving them within <lb/>
            their city, they coasted on to Catana; and when the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants refused to admit them, (for there was in that place a party <lb/>
            that favoured the cause of the Syracusans,) they proceeded to <lb/>
            the river Terias. Having spent the night there, the next day <lb/>
            they sailed in column towards Syracuse, with the rest of the <lb/>
            ships; for ten of their squadron they bad sent on before, to <lb/>
            sail into the great harbour, and observe whether there were <lb/>
            any fleet launched; and to proclaim from their ships. " that <lb/>
            the Athenians were come to reinstate the Leontines in their <lb/>
            own country, on the ground of alliance and kindred; and <lb/>
            therefore that such of them as were in Syracuse should with­ <lb/>
            draw from it, and without any apprehension join the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans. as friends and benefactors.' So when this proclama­ <lb/>
            tion had been made, and they had reconnoitred the city, the <lb/>
            harbours, and the features of the country which they would <lb/>
            have to make the base of their operations in the war, they <lb/>
            sailed back again to Catana. <note type="footnote"> I Or, as Arnold renders it, " while they were carrying,' &amp;c. </note> <pb n="411"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="51—53.]"/> </p>
          <p>51. An assembly having been held there, the inhabitants <lb/>
            did not admit the armament, but told the generals to come in <lb/>
            and say what they wished. While Alcibiades was speaking, <lb/>
            and the attention of those in the city was turned to the assem­ <lb/>
            bly, the soldiers, without being observed, broke through a <lb/>
            postern which had been ill built up in the wall, and entering <lb/>
            the city stationed themselves in the market-place. When <lb/>
            those of the Catanæans who favoured the Syracusans saw the <lb/>
            army within the walls, being immediately very much alarmed, <lb/>
            they secretly went out of the place, as they formed but a small <lb/>
            party; while the rest voted for an alliance with the Athenians, <lb/>
            and begged them to fetch the rest of their forces from Rhegium. <lb/>
            After this the Athenians sailed to Rhegium, and having now <lb/>
            put out with all their armament for Catana, on their arrival <lb/>
            there established themselves in their camp.</p>
          <p>52. Now tidings were brought to them, both from Camarina, <lb/>
            that if they went there, the inhabitants would go over to them, <lb/>
            and also that the Syracusans were manning a fleet. They coast­ <lb/>
            ed along therefore with all their force, in the first instance, to <lb/>
            Syracuse; and when they found no fleet manning, they again <lb/>
            proceeded along the shore towards Camarina; and having <lb/>
            brought to at the beach, sent a herald to the people. They, <lb/>
            however, did not admit them, saying that their agreement on <lb/>
            oath was to receive the Athenians, when they sailed to them <lb/>
            with only a single ship, unless they should themselves send for <lb/>
            more. Being thus unsuccessful, they sailed back again ; and <lb/>
            after they had landed on a part of the Syracusan territory, and <lb/>
            the cavalry from Syracuse had come to the rescue, and killed <lb/>
            some stragglers of the light-armed, they went back to Catana.</p>
          <p>53. There they found the ship Salaminia come from Athens <lb/>
            for Alcibiades—to order him to sail back and defend himself <lb/>
            against the charges which the state brought against him—and <lb/>
            for some others of the soldiers, who with him had been in­ <lb/>
            formed against, as being guilty of impiety with regard to the <lb/>
            mysteries, and some of them with regard to the Mercuries also. <lb/>
            For the Athenians, after the armament had sailed away, made <lb/>
            no less investigation into what had been done in the case of the <lb/>
            mysteries and in that of the Mercuries; and as they did not <lb/>
            test the character of the informers, 1 but in their suspicious <note type="footnote"> I Or, according to Poppo a reading, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα</foreign>, " taking, or regarding, every <lb/>
            thing in a suspicious light." </note> <pb n="412"/>
            <note type="margin"> [54. </note> <lb/>
            mood admitted all who came forward, on the credit of un­ <lb/>
            principled men they arrested and threw into prison very ex­ <lb/>
            cellent citizens; thinking i more expedient to sift the matter <lb/>
            and find it out, than that, in consequence of the bad principle <lb/>
            of an informer, an accused person, even though he had a good <lb/>
            character, should be unquestioned, and escape. For the <lb/>
            commons, knowing by report that the tyranny of Pisistratus <lb/>
            and his sons had proved galling at last, and, moreover, that it <lb/>
            had not even been put down by themselves and Harmodius, <lb/>
            but by the Lacedæmonians, were always afraid, and took every <lb/>
            thing suspiciously.</p>
          <p>54. For the daring deed of Aristogiton and Harmodius <lb/>
            was undertaken in consequence of a love-adventure; by re­ <lb/>
            lating which, at some length, I shall show that neither other <lb/>
            people, nor the Athenians themselves, give any accurate ac­ <lb/>
            count of their own tyrants, or of what has happened amongst <lb/>
            them. For when Pisistratus had died at an advanced age in <lb/>
            possession of the tyranny, it was not Hipparchus, as the <lb/>
            generality suppose, but Hippias, that was eldest of his sons, <lb/>
            and obtained the government. Now Harmodius being in the <lb/>
            flower of youth and beauty, Aristogiton, a citizen of middle <lb/>
            rank in the city, was enamoured of him, and enjoyed his fa­ <lb/>
            vour. Harmodius, then, being solicited by Hipparchus, son <lb/>
            of Pisistratus, and not prevailed upon, denounced him to <lb/>
            Aristogiton. He, lover-like, being exceedingly indignant, <lb/>
            and fearing the power of Hipparchas, lest he should take him <lb/>
            by force, immediately formed a design, (such as he could in <lb/>
            the position he held,) for putting down the tyranny. In the <lb/>
            mean time Hipparchus, having again solicited Harmodius with <lb/>
            no better success, would not indeed offer any violence to him, <lb/>
            but prepared to insult him in some secret way or other, as <lb/>
            though it were not on that account. For neither in his general <lb/>
            government was he severe towards the mass of the people, but <lb/>
            conducted it without exciting any odium; and, for tyrants, these <lb/>
            men in the greatest degree studied virtue and intelligence; and <lb/>
            though they exacted from the Athenians. only a twentieth of <lb/>
            their income, they adorned their city in a beautiful manner, and <lb/>
            carried on their wars, and provided sacrifices for the temples. <lb/>
            The state enjoyed, too, the laws which had been previous­ <lb/>
            ly enacted, in all other respects, except that they always <pb n="413"/>
            <note type="margin"> 55.] <lb/>
            </note>took care that one of their own family should hold the offices. <lb/>
            Amongst others of them who held the yearly archonship at <lb/>
            Athens was Pisistratus, son of the Hippias who had been ty­ <lb/>
            rant, who bore his grandfather's name, and dedicated, while <lb/>
            archon, the altar to the twelve gods in the market-place, and <lb/>
            that of Apollo in the Pythian precinct. The Athenian people <lb/>
            having afterwards made an addition to the length of that in <lb/>
            the market-place, obliterated the inscription on the altar ; but <lb/>
            that in the Pythian precinct is even still visible, though in <lb/>
            faded letters, to this purport: <lb/>
            " Pisistratus, the son of Hippias, here, <lb/>
            In Pythian precinct, marked his archon year."</p>
          <p>55. Now that Hippias, as being the eldest son, succeeded <lb/>
            to the government, I both positively assert, because I know <lb/>
            it by report more accurately than others, and one may also <lb/>
            learn it from this very fact. He alone of the legitimate bro­ <lb/>
            thers appears to have had children; as both the altar shows <lb/>
            and the pillar commemorating the wrong committed by the <lb/>
            tyrants, placed in the Athenian citadel, on which is inscribed <lb/>
            the name of no child of Thlessalus, or of Hipparchus, but <lb/>
            five of Hippias, who were born to him of Myrrhine, daughter <lb/>
            of Callias, son of Hyperechides. For it was natural that the <lb/>
            eldest should have married first. And he is the first men­ <lb/>
            tioned 1 on the pillar after his father; and that, too, not un­ <lb/>
            naturally, as he was the eldest next to him, and enjoyed the <lb/>
            tyranny. Nor, again, do I think that Hippias would ever have <lb/>
            obtained the tyranny with such ease at the moment, if Hip­ <lb/>
            parchus had been in power when he was killed, and Hippias <lb/>
            had had to establish himself in it on the same day. But <lb/>
            owing to his former habit, both of striking fear into the citi­ <lb/>
            zens, and of paying strict attention to his mercenaries, be <lb/>
            retained his sway with superabundant security; and was at <lb/>
            no loss, as though he had been a younger brother, and so <lb/>
            had not previously been familiar with 2 the constant exercise <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν τη̃ πρώτη̗ στήλη̗</foreign>.] As I do not think that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτη̗</foreign> can bear the mean­ <lb/>
            ing which Arnold, though with great doubt, proposes to give it, and as no <lb/>
            other editor professes to understand its force, I have not translated it at all. </note><note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυυεχω̃ς ώμιλήκειτἣ άρχη̗̃</foreign>.] These words seem to refer to the tempo­ <lb/>
            rary exercise of power which he might have enjoyed as archon for a year, in <lb/>
            opposition to the permanent exercise of it as tyrant, which he would not <lb/>
            have enjoyed, had he been the younger son of his father. </note> <pb n="414"/>
            <note type="margin"> [56, 67. </note> <lb/>
            of power. But it was the lot of Hipparchus, because he was <lb/>
            rendered famous by the sad fate which befell him, to receive <lb/>
            also in succeeding ages the repute of having enjoyed the <lb/>
            tyranny.</p>
          <p>56. So then, when Harmodius had resisted his solicitation, <lb/>
            he insulted him, as he intended. For after summoning a sis­ <lb/>
            ter of his, a young girl, to come and bear a basket in a certain <lb/>
            procession, they rejected her when she came, saying that they <lb/>
            had not summoned her at all, as she was 1 not worthy of the <lb/>
            honour. Harmodius being very indignant at this, Aristogiton <lb/>
            also was, for his sake, much more exasperated than ever. <lb/>
            And now all their other arrangements had been made with <lb/>
            those who were to join them in taking the business in hand; <lb/>
            but they were waiting for the great Panathenaic festival, on <lb/>
            which day alone it was not considered a suspicious circumstance <lb/>
            that those of the citizens who had conducted the procession <lb/>
            should meet together in arms; and they were themselves to be­ <lb/>
            gin, but the rest immediately to join in aiding them against the <lb/>
            Dody-guards. The conspirators were not numerous, for se­ <lb/>
            curity's sake ; for they hoped that if any number whatever <lb/>
            dared to make the attempt, even those who were not before <lb/>
            privy to it would be willing at the moment, inasmuch as they <lb/>
            had arms in their hands, to join in effecting their own freedom.</p>
          <p>57. When therefore the festival arrived, Hippias, with his <lb/>
            body-guard, was arranging outside of the walls, in what is called <lb/>
            the Ceramicus, how the several parts of the procession were to <lb/>
            proceed. And when they saw one of their accomplices in <lb/>
            familiar conversation with Hippias, (for he was easy of access <lb/>
            to all,) they were alarmed, and thought that some information <lb/>
            had been laid against them, and that they would be almost <lb/>
            immediately arrested. They wished therefore to avenge them­ <lb/>
            selves beforehand, if possible, on the man who had aggrieved <lb/>
            them, and for whose punishment they were exposing them­ <lb/>
            selves to all that danger; and so they rushed straightway <lb/>
            within the gates, and meeting with Hipparchus by the Leo­ <lb/>
            corium, at once fell on him in a reckless manner, under the <lb/>
            influence of the most vehement passion, inspired by love in <note type="footnote">1 Either because her family was of Phœnician extraction, which excluded <lb/>
            her from an honour confined to pure Athenians; or because her immoral <lb/>
            character, as they insinuated, incapacitated her for an employment in which <lb/>
            done but virgins of unblemished reputation could take a part. </note> <pb n="415"/>

            the one case, and by insult in the other, and smote him, and <lb/>
            slew him. Now one of them, namely, Aristogiton, escaped <lb/>
            from the guards at the moment, through the crowd running <lb/>
            up ; but was seized afterwards, and disposed of in no gentle <lb/>
            manner. Harmodius was immediately slain on the spot.</p>
          <p>58. When the news were brought to Hippias in the Cera­ <lb/>
            micus, he proceeded immediately, not to the scene of action, <lb/>
            but to the armed men in the procession, before they were <lb/>
            aware of the matter, in consequence of their being at some <lb/>
            distance from the spot; and with his countenance feigned to <lb/>
            quit the occasion, so as not to betray his feelings, he pointed <lb/>
            out a certain spot, and desired them to retire into it without <lb/>
            their arms. Accordingly they withdrew, supposing that he <lb/>
            would deliver an address to them; while he, after command­ <lb/>
            ing his guards to remove the arms, immediately picked out <lb/>
            such men as he was disposed to think guilty, and whoever was <lb/>
            found with a dagger; for it was only with shield and spear <lb/>
            that they were accustomed to make their processions.</p>
          <p>59. In this manner both the original conspiracy was entered <lb/>
            into by Harmodius and Aristogiton for a love offence, and <lb/>
            their rash venture attempted through their alarm at the mo­ <lb/>
            ment. After this, the tyranny was more severe on the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians than before; and Hippias, being now in greater appre­ <lb/>
            hension, both put to death many of the citizens, and kept his <lb/>
            eye also on foreign states, in whatever quarter he had a pros­ <lb/>
            pect of a safe retreat being secured for him, in case of any <lb/>
            revolution. At any rate, he married his daughter Archedice <lb/>
            to Æantides, son of the tyrant of Lampsacus - 1 Athenian <lb/>
            as he was, to a Lampsacene-because he saw that they had <lb/>
            great influence with king Darius. There is a monument to <lb/>
            her at Lampsacus, with this inscription : <lb/>
            " Beneath this dust Archedice finds peace, <lb/>
            Whose sire was Hippias, peerless once in Greece. <lb/>
            She, though of tyrants daughter, sister, bride, <lb/>
            And mother, ne'er was lifted up with pride."</p>
          <p>With regard to Hippias, having retained the tyranny at <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. to a native of a place so very far beneath his own country in reputa­ <lb/>

            Athens three years longer, and being deposed in the fourth <lb/>
            year by the Lacedaemonians and the banished Alemæonidæ, <lb/>
            he went, under treaty, to Sigeum, then to Æantides at Lamp­ <lb/>
            sacus, and thence to the court of king Darius ; from which <lb/>
            also he set out twenty years after, when now an old man, and <lb/>
            accompanied the Median forces to Marathon.</p>
          <p>60. Reflecting, then, on these things, and recalling to mind <lb/>
            all that they knew by report concerning them, the Athenian <lb/>
            people was wrathful at that time, and suspicious of those who <lb/>
            had incurred accusation on the subject of the mysteries, and <lb/>
            thought that every thing had been done on the strength of a <lb/>
            conspiracy for establishing an oligarchy, or a tyranny. So <lb/>
            when, in consequence of their anger on this account, many <lb/>
            persons of consideration were already in prison, and the mat­ <lb/>
            ter appeared not to lie stopping, but they were daily proceed­ <lb/>
            ing to greater severity and to more numerous arrests; under <lb/>
            these circumstances one of the men in confinement, who <lb/>
            was thought to be the most guilty of them, was persuaded by <lb/>
            one of his fellow prisoners to give information, whether true <lb/>
            or not; for suppositions are entertained both ways, and the cer­ <lb/>
            tain fact respecting those who had done the deed no one was <lb/>
            either able to state then, or has since been able. By his argu­ <lb/>
            ments then he persuaded him, that he ought, even if he had <lb/>
            not done the deed, both to save himself by gaining a promise <lb/>
            of impunity, and to stop his country from its present suspi­ <lb/>
            ciousness: for that his preservation was more sure, if he con­ <lb/>
            fessed with a promise of impunity, than if he denied it, and <lb/>
            were brought to trial. Accordingly he informed both against <lb/>
            himself and some others, respecting the Mercuries; and the <lb/>
            Athenian people having gladly ascertained, as they supposed; <lb/>
            the truth of the matter, and having been before indignant at <lb/>
            the thought of not discovering those who had plotted against <lb/>
            their commons, immediately set at liberty the informer and <lb/>
            his companions, such as he had not accused; while with re­ <lb/>
            gard to those who were charged with the crime, having <lb/>
            brought them to trial, they executed all of them who were <lb/>
            seized, and having passed sentence upon those who had fled, <lb/>
            proclaimed a reward in money for any one who slew them. <lb/>
            By this course, though it was doubtful whether those who <lb/>
            suffer _ nad been punished unjustly or not, yet the rest of the <lb/>
            sommunity were manifestly benefited. <pb n="417"/>
            <note type="margin"> 61.] </note> </p>
          <p>61. With regard to Alcibiades, the Athenians took a severe <lb/>
            view of the case, being instigated by his enemies, the same <lb/>
            men as had also attacked him before his going on the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion. And when they fancied they were in possession of the <lb/>
            truth respecting the Mercuries, they thought much more than <lb/>
            ever that the affair of the mysteries also, in which he was im­ <lb/>
            plicated, had been done by him with the same design, and in <lb/>
            connexion with the plot against the democracy. For a small <lb/>
            force of Lacedæmonians happened too, just at the time when <lb/>
            they were in commotion on these subjects, to have advanced <lb/>
            as far as the Isthmus, in pursuance of some scheme with the <lb/>
            Bœotians. They thought therefore that it had come by agree­ <lb/>
            ment, through his agency, and not on account of the Boeotians ; <lb/>
            and that if they had not, in consequence of the information <lb/>
            they had received, been beforehand in the arrest of the party, <lb/>
            the city would have been betrayed to them. One night in­ <lb/>
            deed they even slept in arms in the temple of Theseus within <lb/>
            the walls. The friends, too, of Alcibiades at Argos were at <lb/>
            the same time suspected of a design to attack the popular go­ <lb/>
            vernment ; and those persons of the Argives who had been <lb/>
            deposited in the islands the Athenians on that occasion gave <lb/>
            up to the Argive commons to put to death on that account. <lb/>
            Thus on all sides there arose suspicion against Alcibiades; <lb/>
            and consequently wishing to bring him to trial, and put him <lb/>
            to death, in this way they sent the ship Salaminia to Sicily, <lb/>
            both for him and for the rest who had been informed against. <lb/>
            Their orders were, to charge him to accompany the vessel home <lb/>
            to plead his defence, but not to arrest him ; for they were at the <lb/>
            same time careful to avoid raising a commotion amongst both <lb/>
            their own soldiers in Sicily and their enemies, and especially <lb/>
            wished the Mantineans and Argives to remain there, whom <lb/>
            they considered to have been prevailed on by Alcibiades to <lb/>
            join them in the expedition. He then, with his own ship and <lb/>
            those who had been accused with him, sailed away in the com­ <lb/>
            pany of the Salaminia from Sicily, as though to return to <lb/>
            Athens. But when they had reached Thurii, they followed it <lb/>
            no further, but left the vessel and concealed themselves, being <lb/>
            afraid of going home to trial with such a prejudice existing <lb/>
            against them. The crew of the Salaminia for some time <lb/>
            made search for Alcibiades and his companions, but when <lb/>
            they were no where to be found, they departed on their voy- <note type="footnote">2 E </note><pb n="418"/>
             <note type="margin">[62, 63. </note> <lb/>
            age back. Alcibiades therefore, being now an outlaw, crossed <lb/>
            not long after on board a boat from Thurii to the Peloponnese: <lb/>
            and the Athenians, 1 when they were not forthcoming, passed <lb/>
            sentence of death upon him and those with him.</p>
          <p>62. After these things, the remaining generals of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians in Sicily, having made two divisions of the army, and <lb/>
            each taken by lot one of them, sailed with the whole force for <lb/>
            Selinus and Segesta ; wishing to know whether the Segestans <lb/>
            would give the promised money, and at the same time to in­ <lb/>
            spect the condition of the Selinuntines, and to learn the state <lb/>
            of their differences with the Segestans. And so coasting along <lb/>
            Sicily, with the shore cn their left hand, on the side towards <lb/>
            the Tyrrhene gulf, they landed at Himera, which is the only <lb/>
            Grecian city in that part of the island. When they would not <lb/>
            receive them, they proceeded on their voyage; and as they <lb/>
            coasted along, took Hyccara, which, though a Sicanian town, <lb/>
            was engaged in war with the Segestans, and was a petty <lb/>
            sea-port. Having taken the inhabitants of the town for slaves, <lb/>
            they gave it up to the Segestans, (for some of their cavalry had <lb/>
            joined them,) and they themselves returned by land through <lb/>
            the country of the Sicels, till they came to Catana ; while their <lb/>
            ships sailed along the coast with the prisoners on board. Ni­ <lb/>
            cias, however, coasted along straightway from Hyccara to Se­ <lb/>
            gesta ; and after transacting his other business, and receiving <lb/>
            thirty talents, rejoined the forces. They then sold their slaves, <lb/>
            from which were realized a hundred and twenty talents; and <lb/>
            sailed round to the allies of the Sicels, giving orders to send <lb/>
            them troops. With half of their own force, too, they went <lb/>
            against Hybla, in the territory of Gela, which was hostile to <lb/>
            them ; but did not take it. And thus the summer ended.</p>
          <p>63. The following winter, the Athenians at once began to <lb/>
            prepare for their advance upon Syracuse, and the Syracusans <lb/>
            also, on their side, for marching against them. For when they <lb/>
            did not, in accordance with their first alarm and expectation, <lb/>
            attack them immediately ; as every day went on, they regained <lb/>
            their courage more. And when they were seen to be sailing <lb/>
            on the other side of Sicily, far away from them, and had gone <lb/>
            to Hybla, and made an attempt on it without taking it by <lb/>
            storm, they despised them still more, and called on their ge- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">έρήμη̗ ςίκη̗</foreign>.] Literally, "by a deserted, or abandaned trial' See <lb/>

            nerals—acting as a multitude is wont to do when full of con­ <lb/>
            fidence-to lead them against Catana, since the enemy would <lb/>
            not come to them. Moreover, Syracusan parties of horse, sent­ <lb/>
            out to reconnoitre, were continually riding up to the Athenian <lb/>
            armament, and asking them, amongst other insulting expres­ <lb/>
            sions, whether they had come themselves to settle with them. <lb/>
            in a strange country, rather than to reinstate the Leontini.</p>
          <p>64. The Athenian generals were acquainted with these <lb/>
            things, and wished to draw them as far as possible from their <lb/>
            city with their whole force, and themselves, in the mean time, <lb/>
            to coast along with their ships by night, and quietly occupy a <lb/>
            place for encampment in a favourable position ; knowing that <lb/>
            1 so they would be better able to do it, than if they should land <lb/>
            from their ships in face of an enemy prepared to receive them, <lb/>
            or should be known to be going by land ; (for the Syracusan <lb/>
            horse, which was numerous, while they themselves had none, <lb/>
            would do great mischief to their light-armed and mob of camp- <lb/>
            followers ;) and that thus they would take a position where they <lb/>
            would not be annoyed by the cavalry in a degree worth speak­ <lb/>
            ing of; (for some Syracusan exiles who accompanied them <lb/>
            told them of the spot near the Olympieum, which they actually <lb/>
            occupied.) The generals, therefore, adopted the following stra­ <lb/>
            tagem in furtherance of their wishes. They send a person who <lb/>
            was a faithful friend to them, and no less in the interest of the <lb/>
            Syracusans, according to their opinion. The man was a Ca­ <lb/>
            tanian, and said that he was come from certain individuals in <lb/>
            Catana, with whose names they were acquainted, and whom <lb/>
            they knew to be still left in the town amongst those who were <lb/>
            well affected to them. He stated, then, that the Athenians <lb/>
            passed the night at some distance from their arms, within the <lb/>
            walls of the city; and that if the Syracusans would come with <lb/>
            all their force early in the morning of an appointed day to <lb/>
            attack their armament, the Catanians would close the gates on <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ούκ ἂν όμοίως δυνθέτες καί εί</foreign>.] Poppo, Göller, and Bloomfield, all <lb/>

              the men who were with them, and would fire their ships; while <lb/>
              the Syracusans would easily take 1 the armament by an attack <lb/>
              on their stockade. There were many too of the Catanians, <lb/>
              lie said, who would co-operate with them in this, and were <lb/>
              already prepared to do so; namely, the party from which he <lb/>
              had himself come.</p>
          <p>65. The generals of the Syracusans, besides feeling conn­ <lb/>
            dent in other respects, and intending, even without this, to <lb/>
            make their preparations for marching to Catana, gave far too <lb/>
            inconsiderate credence to the man, and immediately fixing a <lb/>
            day on which they would be there, dismissed him ; while they <lb/>
            themselves (for by this time the Selinuntines and some other <lb/>
            of their allies had also come) gave orders for all the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans to march forth in a body. When their preparations <lb/>
            were made, and the time at which they had agreed to come <lb/>
            was near at hand, they set out for Catana, and bivouacked on <lb/>
            the river Symæthus, in the Leontine territory. The Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, on learning their approach, took the whole of their own <lb/>
            force, with such of the Sicels, or any other people, as had <lb/>
            joined them, and putting them on board their ships and boats, <lb/>
            sailed by night to Syracuse. And thus, when the morning <lb/>
            came, the Athenians were landing on the ground opposite the <lb/>
            Olympieum, for the purpose of securing their camp; and at <lb/>
            the same time the Syracusan cavalry, having ridden up first <lb/>
            to Catana, and found that the whole armament had put to sea, <lb/>
            returned and carried the news to the infantry, when they all <lb/>
            turned back together, and went to the aid of the city.</p>
          <p>66. In the mean time, as the march they had to make was a <lb/>
            long one, the Athenians quietly pitched their camp in a fa­ <lb/>
            vourable position, where they would be able to commence an <lb/>
            engagement just when they pleased, and the Syracusan horse <lb/>
            woum cause them the least annoyance, both during the action <lb/>
            and before it. For on one side they were flanked by walls, <lb/>
            houses, trees, and a marsh ; on the other, by cliffs. They <lb/>
            also felled the trees near to them, and carrying them down to <lb/>
            the sea, fixed a palisade by their ships; while with rude stones <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ στράτευμα</foreign>.] I see no reason at all for altering this, as Arnold pro­ <lb/>

            and wood they hastily erected a fort at Dascon, where their <lb/>
            position was most open to the enemy's attack, and broke down <lb/>
            the bridge over the Anapus. While they were making these <lb/>
            preparations, no one came out from the city to stop them ; but <lb/>
            the Syracusan cavalry was what first came against them, and <lb/>
            afterwards all the infantry was mustered. And at first they <lb/>
            advanced near the camp of the Athenians ; then, when they <lb/>
            did not go out against them, they withdrew, and crossed the <lb/>
            road to Helorus, and there encamped for the night.</p>
          <p>67. The next day the Athenians and their allies prepared <lb/>
            for battle, and made their dispositions as follows. The right <lb/>
            wing was held by the Argives and Mantineans, the centre by <lb/>
            the Athenians, and the remainder of the line by the rest of <lb/>
            the allies. Half of their force was posted in advance, drawn <lb/>
            up eight deep ; the other half, close upon their tents, in a hol­ <lb/>
            low square, which was also formed eight deep, with orders to <lb/>
            look out where any part of the army might be most distressed, <lb/>
            and go to its support. Within this body of reserve, too, they <lb/>
            placed the camp-followers. The Syracusans, on the other <lb/>
            hand, drew up their heavy infantry sixteen deep, consisting of <lb/>
            the Syracusans in full force, and as many allies as had joined <lb/>
            them : (they were reinforced most extensively by the Selinun­ <lb/>
            tines ; next to them, by the Geloan cavalry, to the number of <lb/>
            two hundred in all ; and by about twenty horse, and fifty <lb/>
            archers, from Camarina.) Their cavalry they posted on their <lb/>
            right flank, amounting to not less than twelve hundred, and <lb/>
            by their side the dartmen also. The Athenians being about <lb/>
            to commence the attack, Nicias advanced along the line, and <lb/>
            addressed the following exhortation to them, both in their <lb/>
            several nations, and collectively:</p>
          <p>68. " What need is there, soldiers, that we should have re­ <lb/>
            course to long exhortation, 1 who are come here for the same <lb/>
            struggle ? For our force itself seems to me more capable of <lb/>
            supplying confidence, than well-spoken words with a weak <lb/>
            army. For where we have in the field Argives, Mantineans, <lb/>
            Athenians, and the prime of the islanders, on what grounds ought <note type="footnote">1 " We are all engaged in one common cause, and the sight of each other <lb/>
            should mutually encourage us."—Arnold. As <foreign xml:lang="grc">οῒπάρεσμεν</foreign> seems to refer to <lb/>
            the whole force, and not to the general only who was addressing them, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρήσθαι</foreign> must be taken in a sense sufficiently wide to include both the speaker <lb/>

            we not, with allies so brave and numerous, to entertain every <lb/>
            one a strong hope of victory ? especially as we are opposed to <lb/>
            men who are defending themselves in a promiscuous crowd, and <lb/>
            not chosen troops, as we are; and moreover, against Siceliots, <lb/>
            who despise us indeed, but will not receive our attack, because <lb/>
            they have less skill in arms than boldness. Let this thought too <lb/>
            be entertained by each of you; that we are far from our own <lb/>
            land, and with no friendly country near us, but such as your­ <lb/>
            selves win by fighting. And so I offer to you an admonition, <lb/>
            the very reverse of the exhortation which our enemies are, I <lb/>
            well know, addressing to each other. For they are urging, <lb/>
            that the battle will be for their country; but I, that it will be <lb/>
            fought in what is not our country, but where you must con­ <lb/>
            quer, or not easily get away: for their cavalry will press upon <lb/>
            us in great numbers. Remembering then your own high <lb/>
            character, make a spirited attack on your opponents, and re­ <lb/>
            gard your present necessity and difficulties as more formidable <lb/>
            than the enemy."</p>
          <p>69. Nicias delivered this address, and immediately led on <lb/>
            his troops. As for the Syracusans, they were not expecting <lb/>
            to engage at present, and some of them, as their city was close <lb/>
            at hand, had actually gone away to it; and these, although <lb/>
            they went to the aid of their comrades in haste, and at a full <lb/>
            run, were too late [to take their proper place in the ranks,] <lb/>
            but posted themselves as each one came up to the main body. <lb/>
            For in truth they were not deficient in zeal, or in daring, <lb/>
            neither in this battle, nor in the others; but though not infe­ <lb/>
            rior in courage, so far as their military science served, yet in <lb/>
            consequence of that failing them they reluctantly abandoned <lb/>
            their resolution also. Although therefore, as I have said, they <lb/>
            did not imagine that the Athenians would be the first to <lb/>
            make an attack, and although they were compelled to defend <lb/>
            themselves on a short warning, they took up their arms, and <lb/>
            immediately advanced to meet them. And in the first place <lb/>
            the stone-throwers, and slingers, and archers on each side be­ <lb/>
            gan skirmishing, and successively routed each other, as light <lb/>
            troops might be expected to do. Then there were priests <lb/>
            bringing forward the usual victims for sacrifice, and trumpet­ <lb/>
            ers stirring on the heavy-armed to the charge. And so they <lb/>
            advanced; the Syracusans, to fight for their country, and <lb/>
            their own personal safety at present, and freedom in future <pb n="423"/>
            <note type="margin"> 70, 71.] </note> <lb/>
            the Athenians, on the side of their opponents, to fight for <lb/>
            another people's land, that they might win it as their own; <lb/>
            and to avoid weakening their own by defeat ;-the Argives <lb/>
            and the independent allies, to join them in securing the ob­ <lb/>
            jects they had come for, and by means of victory to look <lb/>
            again on the country that was already theirs;-while the <lb/>
            subject allies showed a ready zeal, most of all, for their imme­ <lb/>
            diate safety, which was hopeless unless they conquered ; then, <lb/>
            as a secondary consideration, for the chance of serving on <lb/>
            easier terms, in consequence of having assisted to reduce a <lb/>
            fresh country under the Athenian dominion.</p>
          <p>70. When they had come to close combat, they withstood each <lb/>
            other's attacks for a long time. And there happened to come on <lb/>
            at once both thunder, and lightning, and heavy rain: so that <lb/>
            to those who were fighting for the first time, and had had very <lb/>
            little acquaintance with war, even this helped to increase their <lb/>
            fear; while to the more experienced party these occurrences <lb/>
            appeared to be produced simply by the season of the year, but <lb/>
            the fact of their opponents not being defeated caused far <lb/>
            greater alarm. But when the Argives had first driven in the <lb/>
            left wing of the Syracusans, and after. them the Athenians had <lb/>
            repulsed those opposed to them, the rest of the Syracusan army <lb/>
            was now also broken and put to flight. The Athenians did not <lb/>
            pursue them to any great distance, (for the Syracusan horse, <lb/>
            which was numerous and unbroken, kept them in check, and <lb/>
            by charging their heavy infantry, wherever they saw any <lb/>
            pursuing in advance of the rest, drove them back again.) <lb/>
            However they followed them in a body as far as was safe, <lb/>
            and then returned again, and erected a trophy. The Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, on the other hand, having collected themselves again <lb/>
            on the Helorine road, and put themselves in as good order as <lb/>
            present circumstances would permit, sent, notwithstanding <lb/>
            their defeat, a garrison to the Olympieum, fearing that the <lb/>
            Athenians might take some of the treasures that were there; <lb/>
            while the rest of them returned into the city.</p>
          <p>71. The Athenians, however, did not go to the temple, but <lb/>
            after carrying their own dead together, and laying them on a <lb/>
            funeral pile, passed the night on the ground. The next day <lb/>
            they restored to the Syracusans their dead, under a truce, <lb/>
            (there had fallen, of them and their allies, about two hundred <lb/>
            and sixty,) and collected the bones of their own, (about fifty <pb n="424"/>
             <note type="margin">[72. </note> <lb/>
            of themselves and their allies having been killed,) and with <lb/>
            the spoils of the enemy sailed back to Catana. For it was <lb/>
            winter, and they thought it impossible at present to carry on <lb/>
            war before Syracuse, till they had sent for cavalry from <lb/>
            Athens, and also raised some from their allies in the country, <lb/>
            to avoid being utterly defeated by the enemy's horse. They <lb/>
            wished too, at the same time, to collect money in the island, <lb/>
            and to get a supply from Athens; as also to win over some of <lb/>
            the cities to their cause, which they hoped would more readily <lb/>
            listen to them after the battle; and to provide themselves with <lb/>
            corn and every thing else they might require, with a view to <lb/>
            attacking Syracuse in the spring.</p>
          <p>72. They, then, with these intentions sailed off to Naxos <lb/>
            and Catana, for the winter. The Syracusans, on the other hand, <lb/>
            after burying their dead, held an assembly. And now came <lb/>
            forward to them Hermocrates son of Hermon, a man at once <lb/>
            second to none in general intelligence, and who had proved him­ <lb/>
            self able in war through his experience, and a person of signal <lb/>
            bravery. He encouraged them, and told them " not to submit <lb/>
            in consequence of what had happened; for it was not their <lb/>
            spirit that was vanquished, but their want of discipline that <lb/>
            had been so injurious. They had not, however, been so much <lb/>
            inferior to their enemies as might have been expected; espe­ <lb/>
            cially since they had been matched against the first of the <lb/>
            Greeks—1 mere amateurs, so to speak, against regular work­ <lb/>
            men. They had also been much hurt by the great number <lb/>
            of their generals and the multiplicity of orders, (for their <lb/>
            generals were fifteen in number,) and also by the tumultuous <lb/>
            insubordination of the troops in general. But should only a <lb/>
            few men of experience be elected generals, and prepare their <lb/>
            heavy-armed force for service during that winter, by furnish­ <lb/>
            ing with arms those who did not possess any, in order that <lb/>
            they might be as numerous as possible, and by compelling <lb/>
            them to attend to their training also; they would, he said, in <lb/>
            all probability have the advantage over their enemies; since <lb/>
            courage they already possessed, and discipline for the execu­ <lb/>
            tion of their measures would thus have been acquired. For <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, as Bloomfield renders it, " raw-hands." See his note. Poppo reads <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτέχνας</foreign>, and renders the passage, " Quod cum iis qui primi Grecorum <lb/>

            nassent. </note> <pb n="425"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="73—75.]"/> <lb/>
            both these things would improve ; their discipline being prac­ <lb/>
            tised in the midst of dangers; and their courage growing <lb/>
            more confident than ever from being accompanied by the as­ <lb/>
            surance of science. They ought, then, to elect their general--­ <lb/>
            both few in number and invested with absolute authority; <lb/>
            taking to them the oath, 'that assuredly they would allow <lb/>
            them to command as they might think best.' For so what <lb/>
            ought to be kept secret would be more effectually concealed; <lb/>
            and every thing else would be prepared in due order and <lb/>
            without listening to any excuses."</p>
          <p>73. The Syracusans, after hearing his speech, voted every <lb/>
            thing as he advised; and elected Hermocrates himself as ge­ <lb/>
            neral, with Heraclides son of Lysimachus, and Sicanus son of <lb/>
            Execestes, these three. They also despatched envoys to <lb/>
            Corinth and Lacedsemon ; that an allied force might join <lb/>
            them, and that they might persuade the Lacedæmonians, for <lb/>
            their benefit, to carry on the war with the Athenians more <lb/>
            decidedly, by open measures; that either they might be com­ <lb/>
            pelled to return from Sicily, or might less easily send fresh <lb/>
            succours to their army now there.</p>
          <p>74. As for the Athenian forces at Catana, they sailed im­ <lb/>
            mediately to Messana, in expectation of its being betrayed to <lb/>
            them. But the intrigues that were being carried on did not <lb/>
            come to any thing. For Alcibiades, when he was now sum­ <lb/>
            moned home, and had left his command, knowing that he <lb/>
            would be outlawed, gave information of the intended move­ <lb/>
            ment, to which he was privy, to the friends of the Syracusans <lb/>
            in Messana; and they had both previously put to death the <lb/>
            men implicated in it, and at that time such as were on the <lb/>
            same side, breaking out into sedition, and taking up arms, <lb/>
            prevailed so far as to prevent their admitting the Athenians. <lb/>
            When they, therefore, after staying ten days, were suffering <lb/>
            from the severe weather, had no provisions, and found none <lb/>
            of their plans succeed, they retired to Naxos, and having <lb/>
            made a palisade round their encampment, took up their win­ <lb/>
            ter quarters there. They also sent a trireme to Athens for <lb/>
            both money and cavalry, to join them in the spring.</p>
          <p>75. The Syracusans, on their part, both built in the <lb/>
            course of the winter a wall to their city, along the whole <lb/>
            quarter looking towards Epipolæ, including the Temenites, to <lb/>
            prevent their being circumvallated so easily as they would <pb n="426"/>
             <note type="margin">[76. </note> <lb/>
            with a less circuit, in case of their being defeated; and also <lb/>
            fortified Megara as an out-post, and another in the Olym­ <lb/>
            pieum. They fixed palisades, too, along the edge of the sea, <lb/>
            at all points where there were facilities for landing. And <lb/>
            as they knew that the Athenians were wintering at Naxos, <lb/>
            they marched in full force to Catana, and both ravaged part <lb/>
            of their land, and after burning the tents and encampment of <lb/>
            the Athenians, returned home. Hearing, moreover, that the <lb/>
            Athenians were sending an embassy to Camarina, on the <lb/>
            strength of that alliance concluded under Laches, to try if by <lb/>
            any means they might win them over to their side, the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans also sent a counter-embassy. For they had suspicions <lb/>
            of the Camarinæans, both that they had not sent heartily what <lb/>
            they sent to join in the first battle; and that for the future <lb/>
            they would not wish to assist them any more, since they saw <lb/>
            that the Athenians had been successful in the engagement, <lb/>
            but would be persuaded to join the invaders on the strength <lb/>
            of their former friendship. On the arrival therefore at Cama­ <lb/>
            rina of Hermocrates and some others from Syracuse, and of <lb/>
            Euphemus and others from the Athenians, an assembly of the <lb/>
            Camarinæans having been convened, Hermocrates, wishing <lb/>
            to prejudice them beforehand against the Athenians, addressed <lb/>
            them as follows:</p>
          <p>76. " It was not, Camarinæans, from any fear of your being <lb/>
            terrified at the present forces of the Athenians that we came <lb/>
            on this embassy, but rather from apprehension that the words <lb/>
            which would be spoken by them before you heard any thing <lb/>
            from us might prevail upon you. For they are come to Sicily <lb/>
            on the pretext, indeed, which you hear, but with the purpose <lb/>
            which we all suspect; and, in my opinion, they are wishing, <lb/>
            not to restore the Leontines to their home, but to eject us from <lb/>
            ours. For surely it is not consistent that they should de­ <lb/>
            populate the cities in Greece, but re-settle those in Sicily; <lb/>
            and that they should care for the Leontines, who are Chalci­ <lb/>
            dians, because of their connexion with them, but keep in <lb/>
            slavery the Chalcidians in Eubœa, from whom these are a <lb/>
            colony. But the method is, the same, by which they both <lb/>
            gained possession of those places, and are attempting to do so <lb/>
            with these. For after they had been appointed leaders, by <lb/>
            the free choice both of the Ionians and of all who were of <lb/>
            Athenian origin, for the purpose of taking vengeance on the <pb n="427"/>
            <note type="margin"> 77, 78.] </note> <lb/>
            Mede ; by charging some of them with failure in military ser­ <lb/>
            vice, others with mutual hostilities, and others on any specious <lb/>
            plea which they severally had to urge, they reduced them to <lb/>
            subjection. And so they did not withstand the Mede for the <lb/>
            sake of liberty-neither these men for that of the Greeks, nor <lb/>
            the Greeks for their own-but the former did it to enslave <lb/>
            the Greeks to themselves, instead of to the Mede; the latter, <lb/>
            to get a new master, one not more unwise, but more wise for <lb/>
            evil.</p>
          <p>77. "But, open as the Athenian state is to accusation, we <lb/>
            are not come at the present time to prove before those who <lb/>
            know this already, in how many respects it is committing in­ <lb/>
            justice ; but much rather to censure ourselves, because, with <lb/>
            the warnings given us by the Greeks in those quarters, how <lb/>
            they were enslaved through not assisting one another, and <lb/>
            with the same sophisms being now practised on ourselves- <lb/>
            their re-instatements of their Leontine kinsmen, and suc- <lb/>
            -ours to their Segestan allies-we will not unite together, and <lb/>
            show them that the people here are nolonians, or Hellespontines <lb/>
            and islanders, who are always passing to a new master, either <lb/>
            the Mede or some one else, and still kept in slavery, but free <lb/>
            Dorians from the independent Peloponnese now living in <lb/>
            Sicily. Or do we wait till we have separately been subdued, <lb/>
            city by city ? knowing, as we do, that in this way only are we <lb/>
            vincible; and seeing them having recourse to this method, <lb/>
            so as to set some of us at variance by words ; to set others at <lb/>
            war through hope of finding. allies; and to injure others by <lb/>
            saying something flattering to them, as they severally can. <lb/>
            And do we then think, that if our distant fellow countryman <lb/>
            is destroyed before us, the danger will not come to each of our­ <lb/>
            selves also, but that he who suffers before us keeps his mis­ <lb/>
            fortune to himself ?</p>
          <p>78. " If, again, the thought has presented itself to any one, <lb/>
            that although the Syracusans are hostile to the Athenians, he <lb/>
            himself is not; and if he consider it a hardship to incur dan­ <lb/>
            gers for our country, let him reflect that it is not for ours <lb/>
            especially, but in like manner for his own also that he will <lb/>
            fight in ours; and that he will do it with proportionately <lb/>
            greater safety, inasmuch as he will not enter on the struggle <lb/>
            after we have been first ruined, but with us for allies, and not <lb/>
            left by himself. And let him consider that the wish of the <pb n="428"/>
             <note type="margin">[79. </note> <lb/>
            Athenians is, not to chastise our enmity, but, making us their <lb/>
            excuse, to 1 secure no less his own friendship. If, moreover, <lb/>
            any one envies us, or is afraid of us, (for to both these feel­ <lb/>
            ings are more powerful states exposed,) and for this reason <lb/>
            wishes Syracuse to be brought down, that we may be taught <lb/>
            moderation, but yet for his own safety's sake would have it <lb/>
            escape destruction, he indulges a wish beyond the limit of hu­ <lb/>
            man power. For it is not possible for the same man to be <lb/>
            alike the arbiter of his own desire and of fortune. And <lb/>
            should he fail in his views, then, 2 while lamenting his own <lb/>
            misfortunes, he might, perhaps, some time or other, wish again <lb/>
            to envy our advantages. But that will be impossible if he <lb/>
            abandon us, and will not take his part in the same perils ; <lb/>
            which are incurred, not for names, but for realities ; for though <lb/>
            nominally he would preserve our power, he would really secure <lb/>
            his own safety. And it was reasonable that you especially, <lb/>
            Camarinæans, who live on our borders, and are the next to incur <lb/>
            the danger, should have provided for this, and not have joined <lb/>
            us remissly, as you are now doing ; but rather that you should <lb/>
            yourselves have come to us; and what you would have en­ <lb/>
            treated, while calling us to your aid, if the Athenians had first <lb/>
            come against Camarina, that ought you now, on the same <lb/>
            principle, to have come and urged on us as an exhortation, that <lb/>
            we should on no point submit. But neither have ye, hitherto, <lb/>
            nor the rest, bestirred yourselves for these objects.</p>
          <p>79. "But through cowardice, perhaps, you will study what <lb/>
            is just, both towards us and towards the invaders, and allege <lb/>
            that there is an alliance between you and the Athenians. Yes, <lb/>
            but you did not conclude that to the injury of your friends, <lb/>
            but in case any of your enemies might attack you ; and to <lb/>
            assist the Athenians, surely, when they were wronged by <lb/>
            others, and not when they were themselves wronging their <lb/>
            neighbours, as they are now. For not even do the Rhegians, <lb/>
            although of Chalcidian extraction, consent to join in the re­ <lb/>
            instatement of the Chalcidian Leontines. And it is a strange <lb/>
            thing if they, suspecting the real meaning of this fine pretence, <lb/>
            are wise without any reason to offer for their conduct, while <lb/>
            you, with a 3 reasonable plea to urge, choose to assist your na- <note type="footnote">1 " i. e. so to reduce the power of every state in the island, that none shall <lb/>

            men who are still more your natural connexions. Nay, that is <lb/>
            not just; but rather, to assist us, and not to be afraid of their <lb/>
            armament. For it is not formidable, if we all take our stand <lb/>
            together ; but only if, on the contrary, we are separated from <lb/>
            each other, which they are so anxious to effect: since even <lb/>
            when they came against us alone, and were victorious in bat­ <lb/>
            tle, they did not achieve what they wished, but quickly went <lb/>
            away again.</p>
          <p>80. " Surely then, if we were united, it were not reasonable <lb/>
            for us to be disheartened : but we ought to enter more heartily <lb/>
            into alliance, especially as succours will join us from the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese also, the inhabitants of which are altogether superior <lb/>
            to these men in military matters. And no one should think <lb/>
            that forethought of yours to be fair to us, while it is safe for <lb/>
            you; I mean your assisting neither party, as being allies of <lb/>
            both. For it is not fair in fact, as it is in profession. For if <lb/>
            it be through your not siding with us that both the sufferer is <lb/>
            defeated and the conqueror gains the victory, what else do ye <lb/>
            but refuse, by the self-same standing aloof, to aid the one party <lb/>
            for their preservation, and to prevent the other from behaving <lb/>
            basely ? And yet it were honourable for you, by joining those <lb/>
            who are injured, and at the same time your own kinsmen, to <lb/>
            guard the common interest of Sicily, and not to permit the <lb/>
            Athenians, your friends forsooth, to do wrong. In short, we <lb/>
            Syracusans say, that it is of no use to afford certain informa­ <lb/>
            tion, either to you or to the rest, about what you know your­ <lb/>
            selves, as well as we ; but we entreat you, and at the same <lb/>
            time protest, if we do not prevail on you, that we are plotted <lb/>
            against by Ionians, who are always our enemies, while we are <lb/>
            betrayed by you, Dorians by Dorians. And if the Athenians <lb/>
            reduce us to subjection, though it is by your decisions that <lb/>
            they will gain the victory, it is in their own name that they <lb/>
            will enjoy the honour; and they will receive no other prize <lb/>
            for the victory than those men who put the victory into their <lb/>
            hands. If, on the other hand, ice are the conquerors, you will <note type="footnote"> really ts reasonable, in opposition to <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύπρερής</foreign>, what only appears to be so, <lb/>
            that I cannot agree with Arnold and Poppo, who give a different sense to it <lb/>
            in this passage; the former rendering it " with a seeming reasonable pre­ <lb/>
            text;" the latter, " utentes probabili (seu speciosâ) excusatione (qua restrain <lb/>

            also have to submit to the punishment due to the authors of <lb/>
            our dangers. Consider then, and choose at once, either imme­ <lb/>
            diate slavery without any peril, or the chance of gaining the <lb/>
            victory with us, and so avoiding a disgraceful submission <lb/>
            to these men as your masters, as also of escaping our enmity, <lb/>
            which would be of no trivial kind."</p>
          <p>81. Hermocrates spoke to this effect; and after him, Eu­ <lb/>
            phemus, the Athenian ambassador, as follows:</p>
          <p>82. "Though we are come hither for the purpose of re­ <lb/>
            newing our former alliance, yet, as the Syracusan orator has <lb/>
            attacked us on that head, we must also address you on the <lb/>
            subject of our empire, to show that we enjoy it on just <lb/>
            grounds. The strongest proof, then, of this he himself has <lb/>
            mentioned, in his assertion that the Ionians have ever been <lb/>
            hostile to the Dorians, And such too is the case. For we, who <lb/>
            are Ionians, considered, with regard to the Peloponnnesians, <lb/>
            who are Dorians, and more numerous than ourselves, and <lb/>
            living near us, in what way we might be least subject to them. <lb/>
            And after the Median invasion, having got a fleet, we released <lb/>
            ourselves from the empire and supremacy of the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians ; since they had no more right to command us than we <lb/>
            them, except so far as they were at present more powerful. <lb/>
            Thus having been ourselves appointed leaders of those who <lb/>
            were before under the king, we so continue; considering that <lb/>
            in this way we should least fall under the power of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians, by having a force with which to defend ourselves ; <lb/>
            and, to speak accurately, not having unjustly, either, reduced <lb/>
            the Ionians and islanders to subjection, whom the Syracusans <lb/>
            say that we have enslaved, though our kinsmen. For they <lb/>
            came against their mother-country, against us, I mean, in <lb/>
            company with the Mede; and could not bring themselves to <lb/>
            revolt from him, and to sacrifice their property-as we did, <lb/>
            when we evacuated our city-but chose slavery themselves, <lb/>
            and to bring the same on us also.</p>
          <p>83. " Wherefore we are worthy of the empire we enjoy, be­ <lb/>
            cause we supplied the most numerous fleet, and showed un­ <lb/>
            compromising zeal in behalf,of the Greeks ; and because these <lb/>
            men, by so readily acting as they did, 1 even in favour of the <lb/>
            Mede, inflicted injury on us ; while at the same time we aim <lb/>
            at gaining strength against the Peloponnesians. And we make <note type="footnote"> I i e. of one so ..utterly opposed to the good of Greece. </note> <pb n="431"/>
            <note type="margin"> 84 85.] </note> <lb/>
            no fine professions of justly enjoying dominion, either as hav­ <lb/>
            ing by ourselves overthrown the barbarian, or as having faced <lb/>
            danger for the liberty of these men, more than for that of all, <lb/>
            and of ourselves at the same time. For in no one is it an invidious <lb/>
            thing to provide for his own safety. And now, having come <lb/>
            hither also for the sake of our own security, we see that these <lb/>
            same things are expedient for you likewise. And we prove it <lb/>
            from what these men state to our prejudice, and what you, in <lb/>
            your too great alarm, suspect; 1 knowing that those who through <lb/>
            fear are suspicious, though pleased at the moment by the charms <lb/>
            of oratory, yet afterwards attend to their real interests in what <lb/>
            they undertake. For we have said that we hold our dominion <lb/>
            there under the influence of fear, and that for the same reason <lb/>
            we are come to put the states here on a safe footing, in con­ <lb/>
            cert with our friends; and not to enslave them, but rather to <lb/>
            prevent their being so treated.</p>
          <p>84. "And let no one suppose that we are interesting our­ <lb/>
            selves in you without any connexion existing between us ; since <lb/>
            he must know that through your being preserved, and resisting <lb/>
            the Syracusans, (being not too weak to do so,) we should be less <lb/>
            readily hurt by their sending a force to the Peloponnesians. <lb/>
            In this way, then, you are connected with us in the greatest <lb/>
            degree ; and on this account too it is reasonable that we should <lb/>
            reinstate the Leontines, not as subjects, like their kinsmen in <lb/>
            Eubœa, but in as powerful a condition as possible ; that from <lb/>
            their own country, living as they do close to these men's bor­ <lb/>
            ders, they may in our behalf be annoying to them. For in <lb/>
            Greece we are by ourselves able to cope with our enemies; <lb/>
            and the Chalcidians, after whose subjugation the orator says <lb/>
            that we are inconsistently giving liberty to those here, are ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous to us by being without any armament, and only <lb/>
            paying us money; but the people here, both the Leontines <lb/>
            and our other friends, by being left as independent as pos­ <lb/>
            sible.</p>
          <p>85. " To an individual, however, who has absolute power, <lb/>
            or to a state that holds dominion, nothing is inconsistent that <note type="footnote">1 " Hermocrates had endeavoured to excite the jealousy of the Camari­ <lb/>
            næans, by telling them, that the Athenians did but pretend to aid the Leon­ <lb/>
            tines, while their real object was the subjugation of all Sicily. ' Such <lb/>
            language,' says Euphemus, 'may possibly beguile you for the moment; but <lb/>
            when you come to act, you will follow your real interests.' ”—Arnold. </note> <pb n="432"/>

            is profitable, nothing reckoned as kindred that does not com­ <lb/>
            mand confidence; but in every case, as opportunity may <lb/>
            serve, you must become either a foe or a friend. And in our <lb/>
            case, our advantage here consists in this,-not that we should <lb/>
            reduce our friends to weakness, but that, owing to the strength <lb/>
            of our friends, our foes should be powerless. Nor ought you <lb/>
            to doubt this. For even in the case of our allies in those parts, <lb/>
            as they are severally useful to us, so we govern them; the <lb/>
            Chians and Methymnæans as independent, on condition of <lb/>
            their supplying ships ; the greater part of them on more <lb/>
            stringent terms, subject to contribution of money ; but others, <lb/>
            although they are islanders and easy to reduce, as allies on <lb/>
            terms of entire freedom, because they lie in favourable posi­ <lb/>
            tions around the Peloponnese. So that here also it is natural <lb/>
            that we should regulate them with an eye to our advantage, <lb/>
            and, as we say, with reference to our fear of the Syracusans. <lb/>
            For they are aiming at dominion over you, and wish, after <lb/>
            uniting you on the strength of your suspicions of us, them­ <lb/>
            selves to sway the empire of Sicily, by force, or through your <lb/>
            forlorn condition, when we have departed without gaining our <lb/>
            object. And it must be so, if you unite with them; for nei­ <lb/>
            ther will so great a force, when united, be any longer easy for <lb/>
            us to manage, nor would these men want strength to deal <lb/>
            with you, when we were not here.</p>
          <p>86. " And whoever does not think this to be the case, the <lb/>
            very fact itself convicts him of being wrong. For on a former <lb/>
            occasion you called us to your aid by holding out to us no <lb/>
            other fear, than that, if we permitted you to fall under the <lb/>
            Syracusans, we ourselves also should be exposed to danger. <lb/>
            It is not right therefore now, that you should refuse to be <lb/>
            persuaded by that self-same argument by which you wished tc <lb/>
            persuade us; or that, because we are come with a larger arma­ <lb/>
            ment, you should be suspicious of us; but much rather, that <lb/>
            you should mistrust these men. We, at least, have no power <lb/>
            to remain amongst you without your support; and even if we <lb/>
            should show ourselves base, and bring you into subjection, we <lb/>
            should be unable to keep you under our dominion, both on <lb/>
            account of the length of the voyage, and the difficulty of keep­ <lb/>
            ing guard over cities so great in extent, and of an inland charac­ <lb/>
            ter, as regards their resources. These men, on the other hand, <lb/>
            living near you as they do, not in a camp, but in a city far <pb n="433"/>
            <note type="margin"> 87.] <lb/>
            </note>stronger than our force here present, are constantly plotting <lb/>
            against you ; and when, in each particular case, they have got <lb/>
            an opportunity, they do not let it slip, (as they have shown <lb/>
            both in other instances, and in that of the Leontines,) and <lb/>
            at the present time they have the hardihood to urge you, as <lb/>
            though you were void of sense, against those who are pre­ <lb/>
            venting this, and who have held up Sicily hitherto from sink­ <lb/>
            ing under- them. But we, in opposition to them, urge you to <lb/>
            a far more real safety, begging you not to betray that which <lb/>
            is secured to both of us by each other; and to consider, that <lb/>
            while for them, even without any allies, the way to you is <lb/>
            always open, you will not often have a chance of defending <lb/>
            yourselves in conjunction with so large a force of auxiliaries ; <lb/>
            of which, if through your suspicions you allow it to depart, <lb/>
            either unsuccessful, or, perhaps, even defeated, you will wish <lb/>
            yet to see even a very small portion, when its presence will <lb/>
            no longer accomplish any thing for you.</p>
          <p>87. " But neither do ye, Camarinaeans, nor the rest, be per­ <lb/>
            suaded by these men's calumnies. For we have told you the <lb/>
            whole truth concerning these things about which we are sus­ <lb/>
            pected, and will still remind you briefly of them, and so try to <lb/>
            persuade you. We say then, that we exercise dominion over <lb/>
            the men in those parts to avoid being subject to another; but <lb/>
            that we liberate those who are here, to avoid being hurt by <lb/>
            them ; that we are compelled to meddle with many things, be­ <lb/>
            cause we have also many things to guard against; and that <lb/>
            we came, both now and before, as allies to those of you here <lb/>
            who were being injured, not without being invited, but after <lb/>
            receiving an invitation. And do not ye, either as judges of <lb/>
            what is done by us, or as moderators, attempt to divert us, <lb/>
            (which would now be difficult,) but so far as any thing in our <lb/>
            meddling policy and disposition is at the same time profitable <lb/>
            for you, that take, and make the most of it. And believe that <lb/>
            it is not equally injurious to all, but that to a large majority <lb/>
            of the Greeks it is even beneficial. For every one in every <lb/>
            place, even where we are not already present, both he who <lb/>
            thinks that he will suffer wrong, and he who is meditating to <lb/>
            commit it, through having a prospect ever close at hand, the <lb/>
            one, of obtaining help from us against his injurer, the other, that <lb/>
            if we come, they run a risk of not being free from alarm, both, <note type="footnote">1 1 see no reason, either for changing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδεει̃ς</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδεές</foreign>, as Dobree and </note><note type="footnote">2 F </note><pb n="434"/>

            I say, are alike compelled, the one, to be moderate against his <lb/>
            own will, the other, to be saved without his own exertion. <lb/>
            This security, then, which is common to all who require it, <lb/>
            and which is now presented to you, do not ye reject; but, <lb/>
            acting like others, instead of constantly guarding against the <lb/>
            Syracusans, now unite with us, and take at length your equal <lb/>
            share in plotting against them."</p>
          <p>88. To this effect spoke Euphemus. Now the Camari­ <lb/>
            næans had felt on the subject as follows: Towards the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians they were well inclined, except so far as they might <lb/>
            think that they would subjugate Sicily, but with the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans they had always, in the spirit of borderers, been at <lb/>
            variance. Being, however, more afraid of the Syracusans, <lb/>
            who were close at hand, lest they might, even without their <lb/>
            assistance, gain the ascendency, they both sent them in the first <lb/>
            instance that small body of horse, and determined for the fu­ <lb/>
            ture to do more actual service for the Syracusans, (though as <lb/>
            sparingly as possible;) but for the present, that they might not <lb/>
            seem to show less respect for the Athenians—since they had <lb/>
            even proved the stronger in the battle-they resolved to give <lb/>
            a verbal answer that should be fair to both parties. Having, <lb/>
            therefore, adopted this counsel, they answered, " That since <lb/>
            mutual hostilities were being carried on by parties who were <lb/>
            both in alliance with them, they thought it to be most con­ <lb/>
            sistent with their oaths to aid neither party for the present." <lb/>
            And so the ambassadors on each side returned.</p>
          <p>The Syracusans were now preparing their forces for war, <lb/>
            while the Athenians encamped at Naxos were negotiating with <lb/>
            the Steels, to get as many as possible to join them. Now such of <lb/>
            the Sicels as lived more on the plains, and who were subject to <lb/>
            the Syracusans, in most cases stood aloof from them ; but those <lb/>
            who occupied the interior, their homes having before this al­ <lb/>
            ways been independent, immediately, with a very few ex­ <lb/>
            ceptions, sided with the Athenians, and carried down corn for <lb/>
            the army, and in some cases money also. Against those who <lb/>
            did not come over to them the Athenians made an expedition, <lb/>
            and compelled some, but were prevented from compelling others <lb/>
            by the Syracusans' sending them garrisons, and coming to their <lb/>
            aid. Having moved their station for the winter from Naxos <note type="footnote"> Arnold wish to do, or for taking the word with an active signification, <lb/>

            </note>to Catana, and having raised again the camp which had been <lb/>
            burned down by the Syracusans, they remained there the <lb/>
            rest of that season. They sent at this time a trireme to <lb/>
            Carthage with proposals of friendship, on the chance of their <lb/>
            obtaining any help, and another to Tyrrhenia, as some of its <lb/>
            cities had of their own accord offered to join them in the war. <lb/>
            They also despatched messengers about to the Sicels, and like­ <lb/>
            wise to Segesta, desiring that they would forward to them as <lb/>
            many horses as possible ; while they also prepared for the cir­ <lb/>
            cumvallation bricks, iron, and all other requisites, intending <lb/>
            to commence hostilities in the spring. The Syracusan am­ <lb/>
            bassadors, on the other hand, who had been despatched to <lb/>
            Corinth and Lacedæmon, both endeavoured, as they coasted <lb/>
            along, to persuade the Greeks of Italy not to look with in <lb/>
            difference on the proceedings of the Athenians, since they <lb/>
            were aimed equally at themselves, and when they were come <lb/>
            to Corinth, delivered an address to them, begging for assist­ <lb/>
            ance on the ground of their connexion. The Corinthians im­ <lb/>
            mediately, in the first place, themselves voted to assist them <lb/>
            with the greatest zeal, and then sent envoys with them to La­ <lb/>
            cedaemon, to join in persuading that people also both to carry <lb/>
            on the war with the Athenians more openly at home, and to <lb/>
            send succours to Sicily. Accordingly the ambassadors from <lb/>
            Corinth came to Lacedæmon, and Alcibiades also, with his <lb/>
            fellow exiles, who had crossed straightway on board a vessel <lb/>
            of burden from Thuria to Cyllene, in the Elean territory, in <lb/>
            the first instance, and then afterwards, when the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians themselves had sent for him, proceeded to Lacedæmon <lb/>
            under treaty ; for he was afraid of them, owing to the part he <lb/>
            had taken in the Mantinean business. And the result was, <lb/>
            that in the Lacedæmonian assembly the Corinthians, the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, and Alcibiades, by urging the same request, prevailed <lb/>
            on the people there. But when the ephors and the authorities, <lb/>
            though they purposed sending ambassadors to Syracuse, to <lb/>
            urge them to make no terms with the Athenians, were not dis­ <lb/>
            posed to assist them, Alcibiades came forward, and exasperated <lb/>
            and instigated the Lacedæmonians by addressing them as <lb/>
            follows:</p>
          <p>89. " It is necessary that I should first address you on the <lb/>
            subject of the prejudice felt against me, that you may not, <lb/>
            through your suspicions, attend to me the less on matters of <note type="footnote"> 2 F 2 </note> <pb n="436"/>

            public interest. When, then, 1our ancestors had, on the <lb/>
            ground of some quarrel or other, renounced their connexion <lb/>
            with you as your proxeni, I myself, from a wish to resume it, <lb/>
            paid attentions to you, both in other respects, and in the case <lb/>
            of your misfortune at Pylus. And when I continued thus <lb/>
            zealous, you, at the time you were concluding peace with the <lb/>
            Athenians, conferred influence on my enemies, by negotiating <lb/>
            through them, but brought dishonour on me. For these <lb/>
            reasons it was with justice that you received harm at my <lb/>
            hands, both when I turned to the Mantineans and Argives, <lb/>
            and on whatever other occasions I opposed you. And now, <lb/>
            if there be any one who at that time, while he was suffering, <lb/>
            was unfairly angry with me, let him look at the question in <lb/>
            the true light, and be led to a different conviction. Or if there <lb/>
            be any one who formed a worse opinion of me, because I <lb/>
            rather attached myself to the popular party, let him not on this <lb/>
            ground, either, suppose that he was with good reason- offended <lb/>
            at me. For we have always been foes to tyrants; and all <lb/>
            that are opposed to the dominant faction are called by the <lb/>
            name of ' people.' It was from this, then, that our taking the <lb/>
            lead of the populace continued; and besides, as the state was <lb/>
            under a democratical government, it was necessary on most oc­ <lb/>
            casions to follow the existing order of things. However, we <lb/>
            endeavoured to be more moderate in politics than suited the <lb/>
            intemperate spirit which had before prevailed. But there <lb/>
            were others, both in times of old and now, who led on the <lb/>
            multitude to more evil courses-the very party which also <lb/>
            banished me. But in our case it was the whole body of the <lb/>
            people that we headed; thinking it right to assist in pre­ <lb/>
            serving that form of government under which the country <lb/>
            was most great and free, and which we had received. For <lb/>
            with regard to democracy, all of us who had any sense knew <lb/>
            what it was; and I myself, perhaps, better than any one, 2in <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴμω̃ν</foreign>.] Arnold accounts for the use of the plural here and in other <lb/>

            of-this passage; though it is doubtful whether it can be extracted from the <lb/>
            Greek as it now stands. Arnold supposes that " some words have been lost <lb/>
            before <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοιδορήσαιμι</foreign>, so that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδενὸς ἂν χει̃ρον</foreign> properly belong to <lb/>

            proportion as I could also abuse it more. But of an acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged absurdity nothing new could be said ; and yet to put it <lb/>
            aside did not appear to us safe, while you, as our enemies, <lb/>
            were so closely besetting us.</p>
          <p>90. "With regard then to your prejudices against me, <lb/>
            such were the facts: but with regard to what you must de­ <lb/>
            liberate upon, and I, on whatever point I am better informed, <lb/>
            must advise, now learn from me. We sailed to Sicily, in the <lb/>
            first place, to subdue the Siceliots, if we could ; after them, again, <lb/>
            the Italiots ; and then also to make an attempt on the dominion <lb/>
            of the Carthaginians, and on their own city. If either all or most <lb/>
            of these schemes proved successful, then we intended to attack <lb/>
            the Peloponnese, after bringing here the united force of the <lb/>
            Greeks that had joined us in those parts, taking many barba­ <lb/>
            rians into our pay—both Iberians and others of those nations, <lb/>
            confessedly I the most warlike barbarians at the present day­ <lb/>
            and building many triremes in addition to what we have, <lb/>
            (since Italy contains timber in abundance). Blockading the <lb/>
            Peloponnese with these round its coasts, and at the same time <lb/>
            attacking it with our soldiers on the land side, after taking <lb/>
            some of the cities by storm, and walling in others, we hoped <lb/>
            with ease to reduce it, and after that to enjoy the sovereignty <lb/>
            of the whole Grecian race. And as for money and provisions, <lb/>
            to render each of these measures more practicable, the newly <lb/>
            acquired places in those quarters would by themselves supply <lb/>
            sufficient, independently of our revenues from these parts. <note type="footnote"> that <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί</foreign> might be a corruption of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἄν</foreign>, a contraction which occurs ch. 92. 4; <lb/>
            and this very slight change is perhaps sufficient to remedy the evil. —Though <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γιγνώσκοιμι</foreign> is probably understood with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄν</foreign> in the preceding clause, I can­ <lb/>
            not think that it could ever have been expressed, as Bloomfi <unclear>eld</unclear> uroposes to <lb/>
            do; at least not in the position which he would give to it, immediately after <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοιδορήσαιμι</foreign>, thus giving by the concurrence of the two optatives a most un­ <lb/>
            musical termination to the paragraph.- With regard to the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσῳ</foreign>, it <lb/>
            seems doubtful whether it is to be considered as qualifying a comparative <lb/>
            understood, as the commentators suppose, or as used absolutely, as in some <lb/>
            other passages of our author, signifying “inasmuch as;” e. g. chap. 92. 4, <lb/>

            expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδενος ἂν χει̃ρον</foreign>, was intended to be supplied from the preceding <lb/>

            sailed, you have heard its objects from the man who knows with <lb/>
            the greatest accuracy what we purposed by it: and the generals <lb/>
            who still remain there will, if they are able, carry them out <lb/>
            in the same way. But that the people there will not escape <lb/>
            their attack, unless you succour them, you must now learn. <lb/>
            The Siceliots indeed, although untrained, might still even now <lb/>
            gain the victory, if united in one body. But the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans alone, defeated as they have already been in battle with <lb/>
            all their forces, and hemmed in by sea at the same time, will <lb/>
            be unable to hold out against the Athenian armament now <lb/>
            there. And if that city is taken, the whole of Sicily also is <lb/>
            in their possession, and Italy, too, straightway ; and the danger <lb/>
            which I just now mentioned as impending from that quarter, <lb/>
            would in no long time fall upon you. Let no one then think <lb/>
            that he is deliberating about Sicily alone, but about the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese also, unless you quickly adopt these measures ; unless, <lb/>
            I mean, you send thither on board ship such a body of troops, <lb/>
            as, after working their own passage, shall immediately act as <lb/>
            heavy infantry ; and also, what I consider to be still more ser­ <lb/>
            viceable than troops, a Spartan as commander, both to disci­ <lb/>
            pline their present forces, and to compel those who are unwill­ <lb/>
            ing to serve. For so the friends you already have will feel the <lb/>
            greater confidence, and those who are doubting between the <lb/>
            two sides will more fearlessly join yours. You must also carry <lb/>
            on hostilities here in a more decisive manner; that the Syra­ <lb/>
            eusans, convinced that you take an interest in them, may offer <lb/>
            the greater resistance; and that the Athenians may the less <lb/>
            easily send reinforcements to their troops. And for that purpose <lb/>
            you must fortify Decelea, in Attica; a blow of which the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians have always been most afraid, and the only one which they <lb/>
            think they have not experienced in the present war. And in that <lb/>
            way would one most surely hurt his enemies, if, acting on certain <lb/>
            information, he should inflict upon them those things which he <lb/>
            knows them to fear most: for it is but reasonable that every peo­ <lb/>
            ple should know most accurately its own dangers, and fear them <lb/>
            accordingly. But with regard to the difficulties which, while <lb/>
            you benefit yourselves, you will create for your opponents by <lb/>
            thus fortifying the place, though I pass over many, I will <lb/>
            briefly mention the chief. Whatever then the country is <pb n="439"/>
            <note type="margin"> 92.] <lb/>
            </note>stocked with, the greater part will come to you, either through <lb/>
            being captured, or 1 of their own accord. They will also at <lb/>
            once be deprived of their revenues from the silver mines at <lb/>
            Laurium, with the advantages they now derive from their <lb/>
            land and their 2 courts of justice ; but, especially, of the revenue <lb/>
            from the allies, which will be less regularly paid by them, <lb/>
            when they consider that the war on your part is now vigor­ <lb/>
            ously prosecuted, and so think lightly of them. To have each <lb/>
            of these things done with greater speed and spirit rests with <lb/>
            you, Lacedæmonians; for that they are possible I am very <lb/>
            confident, and I do not think that I shall be proved to have <lb/>
            been mistaken.</p>
          <p>92. " And now, I beg that I may not be the worse thought <lb/>
            of by any among you, because I am now strenuously attacking <lb/>
            my country with its bitterest enemies, though I formerly had <lb/>
            a reputation for patriotism; and that my words may not be <lb/>
            suspected on the score of an exile's forwardness. For though <lb/>
            I am an exile, as regards the villany of those who banished <lb/>
            me, I am not one, as regards assistance to you, if you will be <lb/>
            persuaded by me: and the party hostile to me was, not you, <lb/>
            who only hurt your foes, but rather they who compelled their <lb/>
            friends to become their foes. My patriotism, too, I keep not <lb/>
            3 at a time when I am being wronged, but only while I enjoyed <lb/>
            my civil rights in security. Nor do I consider myself to be <lb/>
            going against what is still my country, but much rather to be <lb/>
            recovering that country which is mine no more. And the <lb/>
            patriot, in the true sense, is not that man who, when he has <lb/>
            unjustly lost his country, abstains from aggression upon it, <lb/>
            but he who, because of his longing for it, endeavours by all <lb/>
            means to regain it. Thus, as far as I am eoncerned, I beg <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτόματα</foreign>,] i. e. the slaves, which I believe to be chiefly alluded <lb/>

              selves, and enjoy a voluntary supremacy over the whole of <lb/>
              Greece, resting not on force but on affection."</p>
          <p>93. Such was the address of Alcibiades. The Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, who of themselves were previously intending to make an <lb/>
            expedition against Athens, but were still acting with delay <lb/>
            and circumspection, were far more determined, when he had <lb/>
            informed them of these several particulars, and when they <lb/>
            considered that they had heard them from the man who had <lb/>
            most certain knowledge of them. So that they now turned <lb/>
            their thoughts to the fortification of Decelea, and to immediately <lb/>
            sending some assistance to the Sicilians. Having appointed <lb/>
            therefore Clearidas to the command of the Syracusans, they in­ <lb/>
            structed him to deliberate with that people and the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians, and to provide for succours reaching them on as large a <lb/>
            scale, and with as much speed, as present circumstances per­ <lb/>
            mitted. Accordingly he desired the Corinthians to send him <lb/>
            at once two ships to Asine, and to let the rest, as many as they <lb/>
            purposed sending, be equipped and in readiness to sail, when <lb/>
            the proper time came. Having arranged these points, they <lb/>
            returned from Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>Now, too, arrived the Athenian trireme from Sicily, which <lb/>
            the generals had sent for money and cavalry. And -when the <lb/>
            Athenians had heard their request, they resolved to send both <lb/>
            the supplies for their armament and the cavalry. And so the <lb/>
            winter ended, and the seventeenth year of this war, of which <lb/>
            Thucydides wrote the history.</p>
          <p>94. At the very commencement of the spring of the next <lb/>
            summer, the Athenians in Sicily put out from Catana, and <lb/>
            coasted along towards the Sicilian Megara, from which the <pb n="441"/>
            <note type="margin"> 95, 96.] </note> <lb/>
            Syracusans, in the time of their tyrant Gelo, (as I have be­ <lb/>
            fore mentioned,) drove out the inhabitants, and themselves con­ <lb/>
            tinue to occupy the territory. Having landed therefore, they <lb/>
            ravaged the country ; and after going against a fort of the <lb/>
            Syracusans without taking it, they again proceeded both with <lb/>
            their land force and ships to the river Terias, and advancing <lb/>
            inland, both laid waste the plain, and fired the corn. After <lb/>
            falling in with a small body of the Syracusans, killing some of <lb/>
            them, and erecting a trophy, they returned to their ships. <lb/>
            When they had sailed back to Catana, and supplied themselves <lb/>
            with provisions there, they went with their whole force against <lb/>
            Centotripa, a town of the Sicels, and returned after getting <lb/>
            possession of it by capitulation, burning at the same time the <lb/>
            corn of the Inessseans and Hyblæans. On their arrival at Ca­ <lb/>
            tana, they found the horsemen come from Athens, two hundred <lb/>
            and fifty in number, without their horses, but with their equip­ <lb/>
            ments, in expectation of horses being provided there, with <lb/>
            thirty mounted archers, and three hundred talents of silver.</p>
          <p>95. The same summer the Lacedæmonians also marched <lb/>
            against Argos, and went as far as Cleonæ, but, on the occur­ <lb/>
            rence of an earthquake, returned. The Argives, after this, <lb/>
            made an incursion into the Thyrean country, which lies on <lb/>
            their borders, and took much booty from the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            which was sold for no less than five and twenty talents. The <lb/>
            commons of the Thespians also, this same summer, and not <lb/>
            long after what has been mentioned, having attacked those in <lb/>
            office amongst them, did not get the better; but Theban suc­ <lb/>
            cours having arrived, some of them were made prisoners, and <lb/>
            others fled the country and went to Athens.</p>
          <p>96. The Syracusans, the same summer, hearing that the <lb/>
            cavalry had joined the Athenians, and that they were about to <lb/>
            march against them, and thinking that unless the Athenians <lb/>
            were masters of Epipolæ, a precipitous tract, and lying right <lb/>
            above their city, they could not, even if defeated in battle, <lb/>
            be easily circumvallated, they determined to guard 1the ap­ <lb/>
            proaches to it, that the enemy might not gain the heights <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰς προσβάσεις αὐτω̃ν</foreign>,] "i. e. the openings in the cliff at different points <lb/>

            without their observation; for in no other way could they, as <lb/>
            they thought, effect it. For the rest of the position rises <lb/>
            high, sloping down to the city, and being all visible within it: <lb/>
            and so it is called by the Syracusans, from lying above the rest, <lb/>
            “Epipolas," [or " Overton.”] They, then, went out at day-break <lb/>
            with all their forces into the meadow along the course of the <lb/>
            river Anapus, (Hermocrates and his colleagues having just come <lb/>
            into office as their generals,) and held a review of their heavy- <lb/>
            armed, having first selected from those troops a chosen body <lb/>
            of six hundred, under the command of Diomilus, an exile from <lb/>
            Andros, to be a guard for Epipolæ, and quickly to muster <lb/>
            and present themselves for whatever other service they might <lb/>
            be required.</p>
          <p>97. 1 The Athenians, on the other hand, held a review the <lb/>
            day following this night, having already, unobserved by them, <lb/>
            made the coast with all their armament from Catana, opposite <lb/>
            a place called Leon, about six or seven stades from Epipolæ, <lb/>
            and having landed their soldiers, and brought their ships to <lb/>
            anchor at Thapsus ; where there is a peninsula running out into <lb/>
            the sea, with a narrow isthmus, being not far from the city of <lb/>
            Syracuse, either by land or by water. The naval armament <lb/>
            of the Athenians lay quiet at Thapsus, having thrown a stock­ <lb/>
            ade across the peninsula ; but the land forces proceeded at full <lb/>
            speed to Epipolæ, and had time to ascend it, on the side of <lb/>
            Euryelus, before the Syracusans, on perceiving it, could come <lb/>
            to them from the meadow and the review. They came, how­ <lb/>
            ever, against them, both the rest, as quickly as each could, and <lb/>
            Diomilus, with his six hundred: but they had a distance of <lb/>
            not less than five and twenty stades to go, before they came <lb/>
            up to them from the meadow. Falling on them therefore, <lb/>
            under these circumstances, in considerable disorder, and being <lb/>
            defeated in an engagement at Epipolæ, the Syracusans re­ <lb/>
            turned into the city, Diomilus being killed, and about three <lb/>
            hundred of the rest. After this, the Athenians having erected <lb/>
            a trophy, and restored to the Syracusans their dead under a <lb/>
            truce, came down the next day to the city itself; but when <lb/>
            they did not come out against them, they returned, and built a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξητάζοντο, καὶ ἔλαθον</foreign>, K. T. \.] " They had landed their men during <lb/>
            the night, and had then stationed their ships at Thapsus; while the soldiers. <lb/>

            fort on Labdalum, on the highest point of the cliffs of Epipolæ, <lb/>
            poking towards Megara, to be a magazine for their baggage <lb/>
            and treasures, whenever they advanced either to fight or to <lb/>
            work at the wall.</p>
          <p>98. Not long after, there came to them from Segesta three <lb/>
            hundred cavalry, and about a hundred from the Sicels, Naxians, <lb/>
            and some others, while there were already two hundred and <lb/>
            fifty from Athens, for whom they had received some horses <lb/>
            from the Segestans and Catanæans, and had bought others; <lb/>
            so that altogether a body of six hundred and fifty cavalry was <lb/>
            mustered. Having established a garrison in Labdalum, the <lb/>
            Athenians advanced to Syca, where they posted themselves, <lb/>
            and built with all speed 1 the central point of their wall of <lb/>
            circumvallation. They struck the Syracusans with constern­ <lb/>
            ation by the rapidity of their building; and consequently <lb/>
            they resolved to march out against them and give them battle, <lb/>
            and not allow them to proceed with the work. When they <lb/>
            were now being drawn up in battle-array against each other, the <lb/>
            Syracusan generals, perceiving that their forces were broken, <lb/>
            and did not easily fall into line, led them back again into the <lb/>
            city, excepting some part of their cavalry. These, staying <lb/>
            behind, prevented the Athenians from carrying their stones, <lb/>
            or dispersing to any great distance; until zone tribe of the <lb/>
            Athenian heavy-armed, with all their cavalry, charged and <lb/>
            routed the Syracusan horse, killed some of them, and erected <lb/>
            a trophy for this cavalry action.</p>
          <p>99. The next day some of the Athenians were building the <lb/>
            wall to the north of the central point, while others were collecting <lb/>
            stones and timber, and laying them along the line, to the point <lb/>
            called Trogilus ; keeping in the direction in which their wall of <lb/>
            circumvallation would be completed in the shortest distance from <note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτείχισαν τὸν κύκλον</foreign>.] To avoid appearing to assert that the whole <lb/>
            line of circumvallation w as at once completed, I have rendered <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκλον</foreign> in this <lb/>
            passage by one of the terms applied to it in Arnold's note; where he says that <lb/>
            " o <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκλος</foreign> which is spoken of as finished, was on the one hand a part of the <lb/>
            circumvallation, but was also a complete work in itself,-something, that is, <lb/>
            of an entrenched camp, which was to be the point of junction and key of the <lb/>
            two lines which were to run respectively to the sea by Trogilus, and to the <lb/>
            great harbour," &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We learn from Herodotus, VI. 111. 2, that the soldiers belonging to the <lb/>

            the great harbour to the sea. The Syracusans meanwhile, at <lb/>
            the suggestion of Hermocrates, more than of their other gene­ <lb/>
            rats, were no longer disposed to run the risk of general actions <lb/>
            with the Athenians, but thought it better to build a counter- <lb/>
            wall in the direction in which they intended to carry their <lb/>
            works ; thinking that if they anticipated them with this, there <lb/>
            would be an interruption to their lines ; and that, if at that time <lb/>
            they should come to oppose them, they themselves would send <lb/>
            a part of their forces against them, and have time to occupy the <lb/>
            approaches beforehand with their palisade, while the Athenians <lb/>
            would cease from their work, and all turn their attention to <lb/>
            them. They went out, therefore, and proceeded to build, be­ <lb/>
            ginning from their city, and carrying a cross wall below the <lb/>
            Athenian lines, cutting down the olives of the sacred ground, <lb/>
            and erecting wooden towers. The ships of the Athenians had <lb/>
            not yet sailed round from Thapsus into the great harbour, but <lb/>
            the Syracusans still commanded the sea-shore, and the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians conveyed their provisions from Thapsus by land.</p>
          <p>100. When the Syracusans thought that those parts of <lb/>
            their counter-work which had been completed by means of <lb/>
            palisades and masonry were sufficient, and when the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans did not come out to stop them, as they feared that the <lb/>
            enemy would more easily contend with them when they were <lb/>
            divided, and at the same time were hurrying to complete their <lb/>
            own wall of circumvallation ; the Syracusans, having left one <lb/>
            tribe to guard the building, returned into the city. The <lb/>
            Athenians, in the mean time, destroyed their pipes which ran <lb/>
            under ground into the city, carrying water for drinking; and <lb/>
            having watched when the rest of the Syracusans were in their <lb/>
            tents at mid-day, and some of them had even gone away into <lb/>
            the city, while those in 1 the stockade were keeping but a care. <lb/>
            less guard, they appointed three hundred picked men of them­ <lb/>
            selves, and a chosen body of the light troops, armed for the <lb/>
            purpose, to run suddenly at full speed to the counter-work, <lb/>
            while the rest of the army advanced in two divisions, one with <lb/>
            one of the generals to the city, in case they should come to the <lb/>
            rescue, the other with the other general to the stockade near <lb/>
            the postern. Accordingly the three hundred assaulted and <lb/>
            took the stockade, the guard evacuating it, and taking refuge <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τω σταυρώματι</foreign>.] "Apparently a stockade in advance of the cross <lb/>

            in the outworks around Temenites. Their pursuers also burst <lb/>
            in with them, but, after getting in, were forcibly driven out <lb/>
            again by the Syracusans, and some few of the Argives and <lb/>
            Athenians were slain there. And now the whole army hav­ <lb/>
            ing returned, threw down the wall, tore up the palisades, <lb/>
            transferred the pales to their own lines, and erected a trophy.</p>
          <p>101. The next day the Athenians, setting out from their <lb/>
            lines, began to build at the cliffs over the marsh, which on this <lb/>
            side of Epipolæ looks towards the great harbour, and in which <lb/>
            direction their wall of circumvallation would be finished in the <lb/>
            shortest distance by their going down over the plain and the <lb/>
            marsh to the harbour. The Syracusans meanwhile went out, <lb/>
            and on their part also began again to interrupt the line by a <lb/>
            palisade, commencing from the city across the middle of the <lb/>
            marsh ; and at the same time dug a ditch parallel with it, <lb/>
            that it might not be possible for the Athenians to carry their <lb/>
            wall of circumvallation as far as the sea. They, after their <lb/>
            work at the cliff was completed, again assaulted the palisade <lb/>
            and ditch of the Syracusans. They had ordered their fleet to <lb/>
            sail round from Thapsus to the great harbour of Syracuse, <lb/>
            while they themselves descended at dawn from Epipolæ into <lb/>
            the plain, and laying doors and planks over the marsh, where <lb/>
            1the mud was most firm, crossed it upon them, and in the <lb/>
            morning carried the palisade, excepting a small part of it, and <lb/>
            the ditch, and afterwards the remaining part. On this oc­ <lb/>
            casion a battle was fought, in which the Athenians were vic­ <lb/>
            torious, those of the Syracusans posted on the right wing <lb/>
            flying to the city, those on the left, to the river. Wishing to <lb/>
            intercept the passage of these, the three hundred chosen troops <lb/>
            of the Athenians pressed on at full speed to the bridge; but <lb/>
            the Syracusans were alarmed, and, as the greater part of their <lb/>
            forces were there, closed on these three hundred, routed <lb/>
            them, and drove them in on the right wing of the Athenians. <lb/>
            By their charge the tribe posted first on the wing was also <lb/>
            thrown into panic; on observing which, Lamachus came to <lb/>
            their assistance from their left, with a few archers and the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, and having crossed a ditch in advance, and being cut off <lb/>
            from the rest, with only a few who had crossed with him, was <lb/>
            killed with five or six of his men. These the Syracusans im­ <lb/>
            mediately snatched up, and had time to get over the river into <note type="footnote"> I laterally, "where it was muddy and most firm " </note> <pb n="446"/>
            <note type="margin"> [102, 103. </note> <lb/>
            a place of security; while their own troops retreated, as the <lb/>
            rest of the Athenian force was now coming against them.</p>
          <p>102. Meanwhile, those of them who had at first fled for re­ <lb/>
            fuge to their city, when they saw what was going on, resumed <lb/>
            their courage, and coming thence, themselves drew up against <lb/>
            the Athenians in front of them, and sent a part of their num­ <lb/>
            bers to the lines on Epipolæ, thinking they should take them <lb/>
            while unguarded. And they did, indeed, take and destroy their <lb/>
            I outwork of a thousand feet in length, but the lines themselves <lb/>
            Nicias prevented their taking, as he happened to have been <lb/>
            left behind in them through illness. He ordered the servants <lb/>
            to set fire to the engines, and all the timber that had been <lb/>
            thrown down in front of the wall; as he knew that for want <lb/>
            of men they could not escape in any other way. And such <lb/>
            was the result; for the Syracusans no longer came against <lb/>
            them on account of the fire, but withdrew again. Indeed, by <lb/>
            this time succours had gone up to the lines from the Athenians <lb/>
            below, who had repulsed the enemy in that part; and at the <lb/>
            same time their ships from Thapsus were sailing, as they had <lb/>
            been ordered, into the great harbour. At the sight of this, <lb/>
            those on the heights retreated with all speed, and the whole <lb/>
            army of the Syracusans retired into the city, thinking that <lb/>
            they would no longer be able with their present force to pre­ <lb/>
            vent the building of the wall down to the sea.</p>
          <p>103. After this, the Athenians erected a trophy, restoring <lb/>
            their dead to the Syracusans under a truce, and receiving <lb/>
            back those who had fallen with Lamachus, as well as himself. <lb/>
            And as they now had with them their whole force, both naval <lb/>
            and military, they began from Epipolæ and the cliffs, and cir­ <note type="footnote"> ' To <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκάπλεθρον προτείχισμα</foreign>.] Arnold supposes this to have been " a <lb/>
            sort of redoubt, or covering outwork, raised before that part of the line on <lb/>
            which the Athenians were at work, to protect the workmen, and to cover <lb/>
            the stones, timber, cranes, scaffoldings, and other things used for the build­ <lb/>
            ing." But the expression seems more suitable for a stationary outwork, <lb/>
            than for one which, according to this description, would be moved about as the <lb/>
            building progressed; and the last passage in which the building operations are <lb/>
            mentioned, transfers them from Epipolæ to " the cliff, which formed the <lb/>
            southern extremity of the high ground above the valley of the Anapus.' <lb/>
            (See ch. 101. 1, with Arnold's note on it.) It would therefore be better, per­ <lb/>
            haps, to consider the outwork in question to have been intended as an addi­ <lb/>
            tional defence for the central point of the lines, TOO <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκλον</foreign>, in which Nicias <lb/>
            might naturally have been left, as the place of greatest security. The engines <lb/>
            and timber which were not required for immediate use, might hare been <lb/>
            kept near the redoubt for the same reason. </note> <pb n="447"/>

            cumvallated the Syracusans down to the sea with a double <lb/>
            wall. Provisions were now brought for the armament from <lb/>
            all parts of Italy. Many of the Sicels too, who before were <lb/>
            looking to see how things went, came as allies to the Athenians; <lb/>
            as did also three fifty-oared galleys from Tyrrhenia. And every <lb/>
            thing else was prospering, so as to give them hope. For the <lb/>
            Syracusans no longer thought that they could escape by mili­ <lb/>
            tary measures, since no assistance had reached them from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese; but were proposing terms of capitulation, both <lb/>
            among themselves and to Nicias : for he alone held the com­ <lb/>
            mand since the death of Lamachus. No decision, indeed, was <lb/>
            come to ; but, as was natural for men who were in difficulties, <lb/>
            and besieged more closely than before, many discussions were <lb/>
            held with him, and still more in the city. For they also en­ <lb/>
            tertained some suspicion of one another, in consequence of their <lb/>
            present misfortunes, and deposed the generals under whose <lb/>
            command these things had befallen them-thinking that it was <lb/>
            either through their bad fortune, or treason, that they were <lb/>
            suffering—and chose others in their stead, namely, Heraclides, <lb/>
            Eucles, and Tellias.</p>
          <p>104. In the mean time, Gylippus, the Lacedæmonian, and <lb/>
            the ships from Corinth, were now off Leucas, wishing to come <lb/>
            to the aid of Sicily with all speed.. When therefore tidings <lb/>
            were carried to them of an alarming nature, and all concurring <lb/>
            in the same falsehood, namely, that Syracuse was by this time <lb/>
            entirely circumvallated, Gylippus had no longer any hope of <lb/>
            Sicily; but wishing to save Italy, he himself, and Pythen the <lb/>
            Corinthian, with two Laconian and two Corinthian ships, <lb/>
            crossed the Ionian Sea as quickly as possible to Tarentum ; <lb/>
            while the Corinthians having manned, in addition to their <lb/>
            own ten, two Leucadian and three Ambracian vessels, were to <lb/>
            sail after them. Gylippus, then, having first gone on an em­ <lb/>
            bassy from Tarentum to Thuria, on the ground of his father's <lb/>
            having formerly been presented with the franchise there, and <lb/>
            not being able to bring them over, weighed anchor, and <lb/>
            coasted along Italy. Having been caught, when opposite the <lb/>
            Terinæan gulf, by a wind which in this quarter blows vio­ <lb/>
            lently and steadily from the north, he was carried out to sea, <lb/>
            and after enduring exceedingly foul weather, again made Ta­ <lb/>
            rentum, and there drew up and refitted such of his ships as <lb/>
            had suffered from the tempest. Nicias on hearing of his ap- <pb n="448"/>
            <note type="margin"> [105 </note> <lb/>
            proach. despised the number of his ships, (as had been the <lb/>
            feeling of the Thurians also,) and thought that they were <lb/>
            sailing more like a piratical armament than any thing else; <lb/>
            and so at present he took no precautions against him.</p>
          <p>105. About the same period of this summer, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians invaded Argos, themselves and their allies, and <lb/>
            ravaged the greater part of the country. The Athenians went <lb/>
            to the assistance of the Argives with thirty ships ; and it was <lb/>
            these that broke their treaty with the Lacedæmonians in a <lb/>
            most decisive manner. For before this they only joined in <lb/>
            hostilities with the Argives and Mantineans by plundering <lb/>
            excursions from Pylus, and by landing on the other coasts <lb/>
            around the Peloponnese, rather than on the Laconian; and <lb/>
            though the Argives often desired them only to touch at Laco­ <lb/>
            nia with their heavy-armed, and to withdraw after devastating <lb/>
            it with them ever so little, they would not do it. But at <lb/>
            that time, having landed under the command of Pythodorus. <lb/>
            Læspodias, and Demaratus, at Epidaurus Limera, Prasiae, <lb/>
            and other places, they ravaged part of the territory, and so <lb/>
            rendered the excuse of the Lacedæmonians more plausible now <lb/>
            for defending themselves against the Athenians. After the <lb/>
            Athenians had with their fleet withdrawn from Argos, and the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians also, the Argives having made an irruption <lb/>
            into the Phliasian territory, ravaged part of their land, killed <lb/>
            some of their men, and returned home. <pb n="449"/>

          <p>1. GYLIPPUS and Pythen, after refitting their ships, sailed <lb/>
            along the coast from Tarentum to Locri Epizephyrii. And <lb/>
            now, on receiving more correct information, namely, that <lb/>
            Syracuse was not yet entirely invested, but that it was still <lb/>
            possible for a party coming with troops to enter it on the side <lb/>
            of Epipolæ, they deliberated whether they should keep Sicily <lb/>
            on their right hand, and so run the risk of sailing into it; or <lb/>
            whether, keeping it on the left hand, they should first sail to <lb/>
            Himera, and take with them both the people there, and any <lb/>
            other forces that they might prevail on to join them, and so <lb/>
            proceed by land. They determined, then, to sail for Himera, <lb/>
            especially as the four Athenian ships had not yet arrived at <lb/>
            Rhegium, which Nicias, on hearing of their being at Locri, <lb/>
            not withstanding his contempt for them, had sent out. Having <lb/>
            anticipated therefore this guard-squadron, they crossed over the <lb/>
            strait, and after touching at Rhegium and Messana, arrived at <lb/>
            Himera. While they were there, they persuaded the Hime­ <lb/>
            ræans to join them in the war, and both themselves to accom­ <lb/>
            pany them, and to furnish arms for such of the seamen from <lb/>
            their ships as had none, (for they had drawn up their ships on <lb/>
            shore at Himera.) They also sent and desired the Selinun­ <lb/>
            tines to meet them at a certain place with all their forces. <lb/>
            That people promised to send them a force of no inconsiderable <lb/>
            amount, as did the Geloans also, and some of the Sicels, who <lb/>
            were ready to join them with much greater forwardness, both <lb/>
            in consequence of the recent death of Archonidas, who, being <lb/>
            king over some of the Sicels in that part, and a man of con­ <lb/>
            siderable influence, was a friend of the Athenians, and because <lb/>
            Gylippus was thought to have come from Lacedæmon in a <lb/>
            spirited manner. Thus Gylippus took with him those of his <lb/>
            own seamen and Epibatæ who were provided with arms, about <lb/>
            seven hundred in number, the Himeræan heavy and light <note type="footnote"> 2 o </note> <pb n="450"/>
            <note type="margin"> [2, 3 </note> <lb/>
            troops, together mustering about a thousand, with a hundred <lb/>
            horse, some light-armed and horse of the Selinuntines, a few <lb/>
            Geloans, and a thousand Sicels in all, and so advanced against <lb/>
            Syracuse.</p>
          <p>2. The Corinthians, meanwhile, were coming to their as­ <lb/>
            sistance from Leucas with their other ships as quickly as they <lb/>
            could, and Gongylus, one of the Corinthian commanders, who <lb/>
            had put to sea last of all with a single vessel, arrived first at <lb/>
            Syracuse, though but a little before Gylippus. Finding them <lb/>
            on the point of holding an assembly to consult on bringing the <lb/>
            war to a conclusion, he prevented their doing so, and reassured <lb/>
            them by saying that there were other ships still sailing up, <lb/>
            and Gylippus, son of Cleandridas, sent by the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            in command of them. Upon this the Syracusans were reas­ <lb/>
            sured, and immediately went out in full force for the purpose <lb/>
            of meeting Gylippus ; for by this time they perceived him ac­ <lb/>
            tually near at hand. He, having taken on his passage Jetæ, a <lb/>
            fortress of the Sicels, and having formed his men for battle, <lb/>
            arrived at Epipolæ; after mounting which, on the side by <lb/>
            Euryelus, where the Athenians also had ascended at first, he <lb/>
            advanced in company with the Syracusans against the Athe­ <lb/>
            nian lines. He happened to have come at so critical a time, <lb/>
            that a double wall of seven or eight stades length had already <lb/>
            been completed by the Athenians, extending to the great har­ <lb/>
            bour, except for a short distance near the sea, which they <lb/>
            were still building. For the rest of their lines, to Trogilus on <lb/>
            the other sea, stones had already been laid for the greater part <lb/>
            of the distance, and some points were left half finished, while <lb/>
            others were entirely completed. To such extreme danger had <lb/>
            Syracuse been reduced.</p>
          <p>3. The Athenians, though thrown into consternation at first <lb/>
            by the sudden attack made upon them by Gylippus and the <lb/>
            Syracusans, quickly drew up for battle. Gylippus halted near <lb/>
            them, and sent on a herald to tell them, that if they chose to <lb/>
            depart from Sicily within five days, taking what belonged to <lb/>
            them, he was ready to make a truce to that effect. They, <lb/>
            however, paid no attention to him, and sent him back again <lb/>
            without giving any answer. After this, they made their pre­ <lb/>
            parations against each other. And Gylippus, seeing the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans in disorder and not easily falling into line, drew off his <lb/>
            forces more into the open ground; while Nicias did not lead <pb n="451"/>
            <note type="margin"> 4.1 </note> <lb/>
            the Athenians against them, but remained still near his own <lb/>
            wall. When Gylippus found that they were not advancing, <lb/>
            he withdrew his army to what is called the citadel of Temen­ <lb/>
            ites, and there they stationed themselves for the night. The <lb/>
            next day he took the greater part of his forces, and drew them <lb/>
            up near the walls of the Athenians, to prevent their going to <lb/>
            the relief of any other quarter, while he sent a detachment to <lb/>
            the fort of Labdalum, and took it, and put to the sword all <lb/>
            the men he found in it; the place not being within sight of <lb/>
            the Athenians. On the same day, too, a trireme of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, moored off the harbour, was taken by the Syracusans.</p>
          <p>4. After this, the Syracusans and their allies, commencing <lb/>
            at the city, began to build upwards along Epipolæ a single <lb/>
            wall in a cross direction, that the Athenians, if they could not <lb/>
            stop their progress, might no longer be able to invest them. <lb/>
            The Athenians had by this time gone up to the heights, after <lb/>
            completing their wall down to the sea; and there being one weak <lb/>
            part in the Athenian wall, Gylippus took his forces by night <lb/>
            and made an attack upon it. When the Athenians were aware <lb/>
            of his approach, (for they happened to be bivouacking out­ <lb/>
            side,) they advanced to meet him ; on observing which, he led <lb/>
            back the troops on his side as quickly as he could. The <lb/>
            Athenians having then raised it higher, themselves kept guard <lb/>
            at this point, and now disposed the other allies along the rest <lb/>
            of the works as they were severally to man them. Nicias de­ <lb/>
            termined also to fortify what is called Plemyrium, a headland <lb/>
            opposite the city, which runs out beyond the great harbour, <lb/>
            and narrows its mouth. If this were fortified, he thought that <lb/>
            the introduction of provisions would be more easily effected ; <lb/>
            as they would carry on their blockade from a less distance, near <lb/>
            I the port occupied by the Syracusans, and would not, as now, <lb/>
            put out against them from the bottom of the great harbour, in <lb/>
            case of their stirring at all with their fleet. And he now paid <lb/>
            more attention to the maritime operations of the war, seeing <lb/>
            that their affairs by land were more hopeless since the arrival <lb/>
            of Gylippus. Having, therefore, crossed over with a body of <lb/>
            troops and his ships, he completed the building of three forte, <lb/>
            in which were deposited the greater part of the stores; the <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. the lesser port, as it was called, to distinguish it from the greater, in <lb/>
            which the Athenian fleet now lay. </note> <note type="footnote"> 202 </note> <pb n="452"/>
            <note type="margin"> [5, 6 </note> <lb/>
            larger boats and the fast-sailing ships being now also mcored <lb/>
            there. And in consequence of this, it was chiefly at that time <lb/>
            that the wasting of the crews first began. For as they had but a <lb/>
            scanty supply of water, and that not close at hand ; and, more­ <lb/>
            over, as the sailors from time to time went out to gather fire­ <lb/>
            wood, they were cut off by the Syracusan horse, which had the <lb/>
            command of the country. For a third part of their cavalry <lb/>
            had been posted by the Syracusans in the small town in the <lb/>
            Olympieum, with an eye to the troops on Plemyrium, to pre­ <lb/>
            vent their marching out to commit ravages. Meanwhile Ni­ <lb/>
            cias learned that the rest of the Corinthian ships also were <lb/>
            sailing to the island, and sent twenty vessels to watch for them, <lb/>
            with orders to be on the look-out for them about Locri, Rhe­ <lb/>
            gium, and the approaches to Sicily.</p>
          <p>5. Gylippus, on the other hand, was at once building the wall <lb/>
            across Epipolæ—making use of the stones which the Athenians <lb/>
            before had thrown down along the line for their own use-and <lb/>
            leading out continually the Syracusans and their allies, and <lb/>
            drawing them up before the works ; while the Athenians form­ <lb/>
            ed their line against them. When Gylippus thought it a fa­ <lb/>
            vourable opportunity, he commenced the attack ; and, having <lb/>
            closed in battle, they fought in the space between the works, <lb/>
            where the cavalry of the Syracusans was of no use. When <lb/>
            the Syracusans and their allies had thus been defeated, and <lb/>
            had taken up their dead. under truce, and after the Athenians <lb/>
            had erected a trophy, Gylippus called his army together, and <lb/>
            said, that " the fault was not theirs, but his own ; for he had <lb/>
            deprived them of the benefit of their cavalry and dart-men by <lb/>
            his arrangements for the battle, which he had made too far <lb/>
            within the works: wherefore he would now lead them again <lb/>
            to the charge. And he begged them to make up their minds <lb/>
            to this view of the case-that they would not have the worse, <lb/>
            as regarded forces, and that with respect to resolution, it would <lb/>
            be intolerable if they should not determine, Peloponnesians <lb/>
            and Dorians as they were, to get the better of Ionians, and <lb/>
            islanders, and a mixed rabble of men, and to drive them out <lb/>
            of their country."</p>
          <p>6. After this, when a favourable opportunity presented it­ <lb/>
            self, he led them a second time against the enemy. Now <lb/>
            Nicias and the Athenians thought, that even if the Syracusana <lb/>
            should not wish to commence an engagement, it was necessary <pb n="453"/>
            <note type="margin"> 7.] <lb/>
            </note>for themselves not to permit their wall to be carried past their <lb/>
            own : for by this time the enemy's work had all but passed the <lb/>
            termination of the Athenian lines ; and if it went on any fur­ <lb/>
            ther, it was at once all the same to them, whether they were <lb/>
            continually fighting and victorious, or did not fight at all; and <lb/>
            therefore they advanced to meet the Syracusans. Gylippus <lb/>
            led his heavy-armed further beyond the fortifications of the <lb/>
            two parties than before, and so engaged them, posting his ca­ <lb/>
            valry and dart-men on the flank of the Athenians, in the open <lb/>
            space where the works connected with both walls terminated. <lb/>
            During the battle, the cavalry charged the left wing of the <lb/>
            Athenians which was opposed to them, and routed it; and <lb/>
            in consequence of this the rest of the army also was de­ <lb/>
            feated by the Syracusans, and driven within their lines. The <lb/>
            following night they had time to build up to the Athenian <lb/>
            works, and to pass them; so that now they could no longer be <lb/>
            stopped by the enemy, while they deprived them, even if vic­ <lb/>
            torious, of all chance of investing the city in future.</p>
          <p>7. After this, the remaining twelve vessels of the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians, Ambraciots, and Leucadians, having eluded the observa­ <lb/>
            tion of the Athenian guard-force, sailed into harbour, under <lb/>

            cusans in completing the remainder of their works up to the <lb/>
            cross 1wall. And now Gylippus went away into the rest of <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνετείχισαν</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοιπόν</foreign>, K. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ</foreign>. X.] Göller and Bishop Thirlwall under­ <lb/>
            stand this of the completion of the Syracusan counter-work, which they <lb/>
            suppose to have been before left in an imperfect state, at some points where <lb/>
            the position was naturally stronger than at others, but to have been now <lb/>
            carried to an uniform height up to the Athenian wall, here called <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ἐγκαρ­ <lb/>
            σίου τείχους</foreign>, as running at right angles to the counter-work. This, how­ <lb/>
            ever, appears to be an exceedingly doubtful interpretation of the passage, <lb/>
            like every other that has been proposed. For the supposition of the counter- <lb/>
            work having been left in an imperfect state has nothing whatever to support <lb/>
            it in our author's description of it in the preceding chapters, which would <lb/>
            naturally, 1 think, lead one to just the opposite conclusion. Nor does the <lb/>
            description of the actual surface of Epipolæ, as given in Arnold's Memoir, <lb/>
            make it probable that there would be, in the course of the wall, any points <lb/>
            of such natural strength as to have encouraged them to dispense, even for a <lb/>
            time, with the ordinary means of securing their work; as it does not appear <lb/>
            probable that it passed over any of the " four decided slopes of rock," by <lb/>
            which alone the " gradual and almost imperceptible ascent" is broken. And <lb/>
            although <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκάρσιον</foreign>, as "a mere relative expression," might be applied to <lb/>
            either of the two works whose relative position it describes, it is surely most <lb/>
            improbable, that after using it as our author undoubtedly, I think, does in <lb/>
            every other passage with reference to the work of the Syracusans, he should <lb/>
            in this single instance employ it in the very contrary manner. Or these </note> <pb n="454"/>
            <note type="margin"> [8. </note> <unclear/><lb/>
            Sichy for forces, intending to raise them both for sea and land <lb/>
            service; and at the same time to bring over any of the cities <lb/>
            that was either not hearty in the cause, or had hitherto stood <lb/>
            entirely aloof from the war. Other ambassadors of the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans and Corinthians were also sent to Lacedæmon and <lb/>
            Corinth, is order that a fresh force might be sent over to <lb/>
            them, in whatever way might answer best, whether in mer­ <lb/>
            chantmen, or boats, or any how else; since the Athenians too <lb/>
            were sending for reinforcements. Moreover, the Syracusans <lb/>
            proceeded to man and practise a fleet, for the purpose of <lb/>
            making an attempt in that way also, and were in other re­ <lb/>
            spects much more full of confidence.</p>
          <p>8. Nicias observing this, and seeing that the enemy's <lb/>
            strength and their own difficulties were every day increasing, <lb/>
            sent, on his side also, to Athens ; having, indeed, on many <lb/>
            other occasions sent messengers at the time of their several <lb/>
            operations, but doing so then especially, because he thought <note type="footnote"> grounds I think that Arnold's hypothesis is, on the whole, more probable; <lb/>
            viz. that he alludes to some additional work carried out by the whole force <lb/>
            of the Syracusans from the city wall, to join, and so strengthen, the counter- <lb/>
            wall. Or, if this should be thought inconsistent with the terms in which the <lb/>
            counter-wall is afterwards described, ch. 42. 4, the joint operations here <lb/>
            spoken of, may perhaps refer more generally to the building of out-works, ex­ <lb/>
            tending at intervals up to it; especially as three such <foreign xml:lang="grc">προτειχίσματα</foreign> are <lb/>
            actually mentioned as existing there, (ch. 43.4,) though we are not expressly <lb/>
            told when they were raised.-With regard to the verb being <lb/>
            used with reference to the nominative <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱ νη̃ες</foreign>, I cannot agree with Arnold <lb/>
            that " this is not the way in which Thucydides commonly writes;" or sup­ <lb/>
            pose, for this reason at least, that " something has dropped out of the text." <lb/>
            The other conclusion mentioned by him seems much more probable, viz. <lb/>
            " that the whole passage was written carelessly." There would seem to be <lb/>
            no abstract reason why actions should not be attributed to ships, which <lb/>
            could only have been performed by the men in them; in the same way as <lb/>
            they are continually attributed by our author to countries, cities, &amp;c. And <lb/>
            the following passages, amongst others which might be quoted, appear to <lb/>
            prove that " this is the way in which Thucydides writes," at least not unfre-</note> <figure type="illustration">

              that they were in a perilous condition, and that unless those <lb/>
              at home recalled them as quickly as possible, or sent out no <lb/>
              small reinforcement, there was no hope of preservation for <lb/>
              them. Fearing, however, that those who were sent by him, <lb/>
              either through incapacity for speaking, or through being defi­ <lb/>
              cient 1 in sense, or from a wish to say something to please the <lb/>
              multitude, should not report the real facts of the case, he <lb/>
              wrote a letter, thinking that by this means, more than any <lb/>
              other, the Athenians would learn his own sentiments, without <lb/>
              their being at all obscured by the messenger, and so would <lb/>
              deliberate on the true state of the case. Accordingly, those <lb/>
              whom he sent departed with the letter and all that they were <lb/>
              to say; while he himself attended to the affairs of the arma­ <lb/>
              ment, being engaged now in precautionary measures, rather <lb/>
              than in perils voluntarily incurred.</p>
          <p>9. At the close of the same summer, Evetion, an Athenian <lb/>
            general, having in concert with Perdiccas marched against <lb/>
            Amphipolis with a numerous body of Thracians, did not take <lb/>
            the city, but after bringing round some triremes into the Stry­ <lb/>
            mon, blockaded it from the river, making his approaches from <lb/>
            Himeræum. And thus the summer ended.</p>
          <p>10. The following winter, the messengers of Nicias arrived at <lb/>
            Athens, where they stated by word of mouth what had been told <lb/>
            them, answered whatever further question any one asked, and <lb/>
            delivered the letter; which the secretary of state came for­ <lb/>
            ward and read to the Athenians, being to the following purport:</p>
          <p>11. "With our former operations, Athenians, you have <lb/>
            been made acquainted by many other letters ; but at present, <lb/>
            it is especially seasonable that you should deliberate with a <lb/>
            knowledge of the position we are in. When, then, we had in <lb/>
            many engagements defeated the Syracusans, against whom we <lb/>
            were sent, and had built the walls in which we are now lying, <lb/>
            Gylippus, the Lacedæmonian, came with an army from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese and some of the cities in Sicily. And though <lb/>
            in the first battle he was beaten by us, in the one fought the <lb/>
            next day we were driven from the field by numerous cavalry <lb/>
            and dart-men, and retired within our walls. At present, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμης</foreign>.] In corroboration of Arnold's argument for this reading in <lb/>

              therefore, we have ceased working at our line of circumval­ <lb/>
              lation, in consequence of the enemy's numbers, and are lying <lb/>
              still; (for we should not, indeed, be able to avail ourselves <lb/>
              of all our force, since the guarding of our lines has exhaust­ <lb/>
              ed a considerable part of our heavy-armed;) while they, on <lb/>
              the other hand, have carried past us a single wall, so that <lb/>
              it is no longer possible to invest them, unless one should <lb/>
              assault this counter-work with a large force, and take it. <lb/>
              And the consequence is, that we who are thought to be be­ <lb/>
              sieging others, are rather being besieged ourselves, as far as <lb/>
              operations by land are concerned; for we cannot even go out <lb/>
              far into the country because of their horse.</p>
          <p>12. " They have also sent ambassadors to the Peloponnese <lb/>
            for fresh troops, and Gylippus is gone to the cities in Sicily, <lb/>
            to persuade some of them which are at present neutral to join <lb/>
            in the war, and to bring from others, if he can, an additional <lb/>
            land force, as well as naval armament. For they intend, as I <lb/>
            hear, at the same time to attempt our walls with their army, <lb/>
            and to attack us by sea with their fleet. And let none of you <lb/>
            think it strange that I say by sea also. For although, (as the <lb/>
            enemy also are aware,) our fleet was at first in fine condition, <lb/>
            as regards both the soundness of the ships and the complete­ <lb/>
            ness of their crews, yet now both the ships are leaky, from <lb/>
            having already been at sea so long a time, and the crews have <lb/>
            been wasted; it being impossible to haul up and careen the <lb/>
            vessels, because those of the enemy, being more than equal in <lb/>
            number, are continually causing expectation of their sailing <lb/>
            against us. For they are seen practising, and it rests with <lb/>
            them to make the attack [when they please]; and they have <lb/>
            greater facility of careening their ships, since they are not en­ <lb/>
            gaged in blockading others.</p>
          <p>13. "We, on the other hand, could scarcely enjoy this ad­ <lb/>
            vantage, though with a great superabundance of ships, and <lb/>
            though we were not compelled, as at present, to keep guard with <lb/>
            all of them. For if we relax our watching even in a slight <lb/>
            degree, we shall have no provisions; since even now we find <lb/>
            difficulty in bringing them in, past their city. On this account <lb/>
            our crews have been wasted and are still wasting; as some of <lb/>
            our seamen, in consequence of their fetching wood, of foraging, <lb/>
            and of distant watering, are cut off by their cavalry; while <lb/>

            </note>desert from us, and those of the foreigners who went on board <lb/>
            as pressed men straightway depart to the several cities; while <lb/>
            those, again, who were at first elated by the high pay, and <lb/>
            supposed that they were going to make money, rather than to <lb/>
            fight, since they have unexpectedly seen both the fleet and <lb/>
            every thing else on the side of the enemy offering resistance <lb/>
            to us, either leave us on finding some excuse for going over <lb/>
            to the enemy, or in whatever way they severally can, (' and <lb/>
            Sicily is a large country;) while in some instances, by engaging <lb/>
            in traffic themselves, after persuading the captains to take <lb/>
            Hyccarian slaves on board in their stead, they have destroyed <lb/>
            the perfection of our navy.</p>
          <p>14. "For you, to whom I am writing, know that 2 the flower <lb/>
            of A. crew is limited in number, and that there are but few sea­ <lb/>
            men who will get a ship under weigh, or keep the rowing in <lb/>
            time. But the most distressing of all these things is, that I, <lb/>
            their general, have no power to put a stop to these abuses, <lb/>
            (for your tempers are difficult to command,) and that we have <lb/>
            no means of recruiting our ships' crews, (which the enemy can <lb/>
            do from many quarters,) but both what is kept, and what is <lb/>
            expended, must be taken from what we brought with us. For <lb/>
            the cities which are at present in alliance with us, namely, <lb/>
            Naxos and Catana, are powerless. If, indeed, one additional <lb/>
            advantage be still gained by the enemy, I mean, that the <lb/>
            places in Italy which supply us with food, seeing the con­ <lb/>
            dition we are in, and in case of your not reinforcing us, go <lb/>
            over to the enemy, the war will be brought to a conclusion by <lb/>
            them without a single battle, through our being 3 starved out. I <lb/>
            might, it is true, have had more agreeable things than these to <lb/>
            write to you, but none more useful, if it is necessary for you <lb/>
            to deliberate with a clear knowledge of affairs here. And be­ <lb/>

            rals have become inadequate: but since the whole of Sicily is <lb/>
            being united together, and a fresh force is expected by them <lb/>
            from the Peloponnese, you must now deliberate with a convic­ <lb/>
            tion that your troops are not a match even for their present <lb/>
            enemies, but that you must either recall these, or send in ad­ <lb/>
            dition to them another armament not less numerous, both mili­ <lb/>
            tary and naval, and no small sum of money, as well as some <lb/>
            one to succeed me, since I am unable to remain at my post in <lb/>
            consequence of a nephritic disease. And I think that I may <lb/>
            claim some consideration at your hands; for when I was in <lb/>
            health, I did you much service during the periods of my com­ <lb/>
            mand. But whatever you mean to do, do it at the very com­ <lb/>
            mencement of spring, and without any delay; since the enemy <lb/>
            will in a short time provide themselves with the succours from <lb/>
            Sicily, and though not so quickly with those from the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese, yet if you do not pay attention to them, in some re­ <lb/>
            spects they will elude your observation, as before, and in others <lb/>
            will anticipate you."</p>
          <p>16. Such was the purport of Nicias's letter. The Athenians, <lb/>
            after hearing it, did not allow him to resign his command, but <lb/>
            till the arrival of others who were elected as his colleagues, <lb/>
            they joined with him two of those who were there on the spot, <lb/>
            Menander and Euthydemus, that he might not in his illness <lb/>
            bear the labour alone; while at the same time they voted to <lb/>
            send fresh forces, both naval and military, composed of Athe­ <lb/>
            nians on the muster-roll, and of their allies. They also elected <lb/>
            as his colleagues, Demosthenes son of Alcisthenes, and Eury­ <lb/>
            medon son of Thucles; the latter of whom they despatched <lb/>
            to Sicily immediately, about the winter solstice, with ten <lb/>
            ships, a hundred and twenty talents of silver, and orders to <lb/>
            tell the troops there that succours would come to them, and <lb/>
            that attention would be paid to their interests.</p>
          <p>17. Demosthenes, in the mean time, stayed behind, and <lb/>
            made preparations for the expedition, intending to start as soon <lb/>
            as it was spring; while he sent the allies word to levy troops, <lb/>
            and got ready at home money, ships, and heavy-armed. The <lb/>
            Athenians also sent twenty ships to cruise routed the Pelo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            ponnese, and to keep guard that none might cross over from <lb/>
            Corinth and the Peloponnese to Sicily. For the Corinthians, <lb/>
            after the ambassadors came to them, and brought a more fa­ <lb/>
            vourable report of affairs in Sicily, thinking that they had not <lb/>
            been unseasonable in sending their former squadron, were <lb/>
            now much more encouraged, and prepared, on their part, to <lb/>
            despatch heavy-armed troops for Sicily in vessels of burden, <lb/>
            as the Lacedæmonians did likewise from the rest of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnese. The Corinthians manned also five and twenty tri­ <lb/>
            remes, to try the result of a battle with the squadron keeping <lb/>
            watch at Naupactus, and that the Athenians there might be <lb/>
            less able to prevent their transports from putting out, having <lb/>
            to keep an eye upon the Corinthian line of triremes drawn up <lb/>
            against them.</p>
          <p>18. The Lacedæmonians prepared, too, for their invasion of <lb/>
            Attica, both in accordance with their own previous resolution, <lb/>
            and at the instigation of the Syracusans and Corinthians, <lb/>
            since they had heard of the reinforcements about to be sent <lb/>
            from Athens to Sicily; that they might be stopped by an in­ <lb/>
            cursion being, made into the country. Alcibiades also kept <lb/>
            urgently advising them to fortify Decelea, and not to let the <lb/>
            war rest. But most of all had they gained confidence, be­ <lb/>
            cause they thought that the Athenians, being engaged in a <lb/>
            two-fold war with both themselves and the Siceliots, would <lb/>
            be more easily subdued; and also because they considered <lb/>
            them to have first broken the truce. For in the former course <lb/>
            of hostilities they thought the guilt lay more on their own <lb/>
            side, both because the Thebans had entered Platæa during a <lb/>
            time of truce; and because, when it had been specified in <lb/>
            the former treaty, that none should take up arms against <lb/>
            others, if they were willing to submit to a judicial decision, <lb/>
            they themselves had not listened to the Athenians when ap­ <lb/>
            pealing to such a decision. On which account they considered <lb/>
            that they were justly unsuccessful, and made both their mis­ <lb/>
            fortune at Pylus, and whatever other might have befallen <lb/>
            them, a subject of 1 serious reflection. But when the Athenians <lb/>
            had set out from Argos with those thirty ships, and ravaged a <lb/>
            part of Epidaurus, Prasiæ, and some other places, at the same <lb/>
            time that they were also 2 spreading devastation from Pylus ; <note type="footnote">1 Or, " of religious scruple," as in some other passages. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">έληστεύοντο</foreign>] Or, as Arnold renders it, " they, the Lacedæmonians </note><pb n="460"/>
             <note type="margin">[19 <lb/>
            </note>and when they refused to intrust the matter to arbitration, <lb/>
            though the Lacedæmonians! as often as differences had arisen <lb/>
            concerning any of the debatable points in the treaty, appealed to <lb/>
            a judicial decision ; then, indeed, the Lacedæmonians thought <lb/>
            that the violation of the law, which in the former instance had <lb/>
            been committed by themselves, had now, again, come in the <lb/>
            same way to attach to the Athenians, and they were, therefore, <lb/>
            eager for hostilities. Accordingly, during this winter they <lb/>
            sent round to their allies orders for iron, and were getting all <lb/>
            the tools ready for building their fort. At the same time they <lb/>
            were themselves raising supplies, and compelling the rest of <lb/>
            the Peloponnesians to do so, with a view to despatching in the <lb/>
            merchantmen succours to those in Sicily. And so the winter <lb/>
            ended, and the eighteenth year of this war, of which Thucydides <lb/>
            wrote the history.</p>
          <p>19. The following spring, at its very commencement, the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and their allies made a very early incursion <lb/>
            into Attica, under the command of Agis son of Archidamus, <lb/>
            king of the Lacedæmonians. In the first place, then, they ra­ <lb/>
            vaged the parts of the country about the plain and then pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to fortify Decelea, dividing the work amongst the con <lb/>
            tingents of the different states. The place is distant from the <lb/>
            city of Athens about a hundred and twenty stades, and about <lb/>
            the same, or not much more, from Boeotia. Now the fortress <lb/>
            was raised for the annoyance of the plain and the richest parts <lb/>
            of the country, being visible as far as Athens. Thus, then, <lb/>
            the Peloponnesians in Attica, and their allies, were engaged <lb/>
            with their building. Those in the Peloponnese, about the <lb/>
            same time, were sending off their heavy-armed troops to <lb/>
            Sicily in the merchantmen, the Lacedæmonians having pick­ <lb/>
            ed for the purpose the best of the Helots and Neodamodes, <lb/>
            amounting both together to seven hundred, with Eccritus, a <lb/>
            Spartan, in command of them, and the Bœotians, three hun­ <lb/>
            dred heavy-armed, under the command of Xeno and Nico, The­ <lb/>
            bans, and Hegesander, a Thespian. These started amongst <note type="footnote"> were continually being plundered;" referring to V. 14. 2, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληστευένηςτη̃ <lb/>

            the first from Tænarus, in Laconia, and put out into the open <lb/>
            sea. Not long after them, the Corinthians despatched five hun­ <lb/>
            dred heavy-armed, some from Corinth itself, and some hired <lb/>
            from Arcadia besides, having appointed Alexarchus, a Cor­ <lb/>
            inthian, to the command of them. The Sicyonians also sent <lb/>
            off, at the same time with. the Corinthians, two hundred heavy- <lb/>
            Armed under the command of Sargeus, a Sicyonian. In the <lb/>
            mean time the five and twenty ships of the Corinthians, which <lb/>
            had been manned in the winter, were stationed in opposition <lb/>
            to the twenty Athenian vessels at Naupactus, till they had got <lb/>
            these heavy-armed on board the merchantmen out to sea: for <lb/>
            which purpose, indeed, they had been originally manned, that <lb/>
            the Athenians might not attend to the merchantmen so much <lb/>
            as to the triremes.</p>
          <p>20. Meanwhile the Athenians, at the time of the fortifica <lb/>
            tion of Decelea, and at the very commencement of the spring, <lb/>
            sent thirty ships to cruise round the Peloponnese, under the <lb/>
            command of Charicles son of Apollodorus, who was ordered <lb/>
            to go to Argos also, and call for a contingent of their heavy- <lb/>
            armed to go on board, according to the terms of their alliance. <lb/>
            Demosthenes, too, they despatched to Sicily, as they had in­ <lb/>
            tended, with sixty Athenian ships, and five Chian, twelve hun­ <lb/>
            dred Athenian heavy-armed from the muster-roll, and as many <lb/>
            islanders as they could possibly raise from the several places; <lb/>
            while they also supplied themselves from the other subject allies <lb/>
            with whatever they could get in any quarter that would be of <lb/>
            service for the war. Moreover, he was instructed, as he sailed <lb/>
            round, to join Charicles first in his military measures on the <lb/>
            coast of Laconia. So Demosthenes, after sailing to Ægina, <lb/>
            waited for any part of the armament that might have been <lb/>
            left behind, as well as for Charicles to fetch the Argive troops.</p>
          <p>21. In Sicily, about the same period of this spring, Gylip­ <lb/>
            pus came to Syracuse, bringing from the cities which he had <lb/>
            persuaded to join him as large a number of troops as he re­ <lb/>
            spectively could. And now, having called the Syracusans to­ <lb/>
            gether, he said that they ought to man as many ships as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, and try the experiment of a sea-fight; for that he <lb/>
            hoped to produce thereby a result worth the risk, towards the <lb/>
            issue of the war. Hermocrates, too, most earnestly joined <lb/>
            him in trying to persuade them, in order that they might not <lb/>
            want courage for attacking the Athenians by sea ; observing, <pb n="462"/>
             <note type="margin">r22. </note> <lb/>
            " that that people had no more than themselves enjoyed an <lb/>
            hereditary and perpetual experience at sea, but had become a <lb/>
            naval power after being, even more than the Syracusans, an <lb/>
            inland one ; and only because they were compelledto do so by <lb/>
            the Medes. And to men of a daring character, like the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, those who were daring in opposition to them would ap­ <lb/>
            pear most formidable: for the terror with which that people <lb/>
            paralysed their enemies, not, in some cases, by being superior <lb/>
            to them in power, but by attacking them with confidence, <lb/>
            1 they, too, would in the same way strike into their opponents. <lb/>
            And he was well assured, he said, that the Syracusans, by un­ <lb/>
            expectedly daring to offer resistance to the navy of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, would in a greater degree gain advantage from the <lb/>
            surprise of the enemy on that account, than the Athenians by <lb/>
            their skill would harm the unskilful Syracusans. He urged <lb/>
            them therefore to proceed to the trial with their fleet, and not <lb/>
            to shrink from it." Accordingly the Syracusans, at the per­ <lb/>
            suasion of Gylippus, Hermocrates, and whoever else joined <lb/>
            them, resolved on the sea-fight, and proceeded to man their <lb/>
            ships.</p>
          <p>22. When Gylippus had prepared the fleet for action, he <lb/>
            took the whole army under cover of the night, and himself in­ <lb/>
            tended to assault by land the forts on Plemyrium, while at the <lb/>
            same time, according to agreement, thirty-five of the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan triremes sailed to the attack from the great harbour, <lb/>
            and forty-five sailed round from the lesser, where their arse­ <lb/>
            nal was situated; wishing to effect a junction with those <lb/>
            within, and at the same time to sail against Plemyrium, in <lb/>
            order that the enemy might be disconcerted by an attack on <lb/>
            both sides. The Athenians, on the other hand, having with <lb/>
            all speed manned sixty ships to oppose them, with five and <lb/>
            twenty of them engaged the five and thirty of the Syracusans <lb/>
            that were in the great harbour, and with the remainder went <lb/>
            to meet those that were sailing round from the arsenal. Thus <lb/>
            they immediately entered into action before the mouth of the <lb/>
            great harbour, and for a long time resisted each other, the one <lb/>
            side wishing to force an entrance, the other being anxious to <lb/>
            prevent them. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί σΦα̃̃ςΚ</foreign>. T. X.] Or, " they " (i. e. the Athenians) " would themselves <lb/>
            aiso be subject to before their enemies: " supposing, as Dobree does, that <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> 23, 24.1 </note> </p>
          <p>23. In the mean time Gylippus, when the Athenians in <lb/>
            Plemyrium had gone down to the sea, and were paying atten­ <lb/>
            tion to the naval engagement, surprised them by suddenly at <lb/>
            daybreak assaulting the forts, of which he took the largest <lb/>
            first, and then the other two; their garrisons not having <lb/>
            awaited his attack, when they saw the largest easily carried. <lb/>
            From the first that was taken the men escaped with difficulty <lb/>
            to their camp, as many of them as took refuge in their boats <lb/>
            and merchantmen; for as the Syracusans were getting the <lb/>
            better in the engagement with their ships in the great har­ <lb/>
            bour, the fugitives were chased by one trireme, and that a fast <lb/>
            sailer; but when the other two forts were taken, at that time <lb/>
            the Syracusans, in their turn, were now being beaten, and so <lb/>
            those who were flying out of the forts sailed along shore with <lb/>
            greater ease. For the Syracusan ships that were fighting be­ <lb/>
            fore the mouth of the harbour, having forced their way <lb/>
            through those of the Athenians, sailed in without any order, <lb/>
            and being entangled with one another, transferred the victory <lb/>
            to the Athenians ; who routed both these, and those by which <lb/>
            they were at first being defeated in the harbour. They also <lb/>
            sank eleven of the Syracusan ships, killing most of the men <lb/>
            on board of them, excepting those whom they took prisoners <lb/>
            from three vessels ; while on their own side three ships were <lb/>
            lost. After hauling up the wrecks of the Syracusans, and <lb/>
            erecting a trophy on the small island in front of Plemyrium, <lb/>
            they withdrew to their own encampment.</p>
          <p>24. But although the Syracusans had thus fared with re­ <lb/>
            gard to the sea-fight, they were still in possession of the three <lb/>
            forts on Plemyrium, and erected three trophies for them. One <lb/>
            of the two forts last taken they razed, but the other two they <lb/>
            repaired, and held with garrisons. In the capture of the forts <lb/>
            many men were killed, and many made prisoners, and a large <lb/>
            amount of property in all was taken: for inasmuch as the <lb/>
            Athenians used them as a magazine, there was in them much <lb/>
            property and corn belonging to merchants, and much also be­ <lb/>
            longing to trierarchs, since there were taken in them, besides <lb/>
            other things, masts for forty triremes, with the rest of their <lb/>
            equipments, and also three triremes which had been drawn up <lb/>
            on shore. Indeed, what most and principally ruined the army <lb/>
            of the Athenians was the taking of Plemyrium; since even <lb/>
            the entrance into the harbour was no longer secure for carry- <pb n="464"/>
             <note type="margin">[25. </note> <lb/>
            ing in provisions; (for the Syracusans, blockading them at <lb/>
            that point with their vessels, prevented it, and their getting <lb/>
            them in was now always effected by battle;) and in other re­ <lb/>
            spects it struck consternation and dismay into their forces.</p>
          <p>25. After this, the Syracusans sent out twelve ships, with <lb/>
            Agatharchus, a Syracusan, on board of them as commander <lb/>
            One of these went to the Peloponnese, carrying ambassadors, <lb/>
            both to tell of their own affairs, " of the hopes they were full <lb/>
            of, and to excite them to the still more vigorous prosecution <lb/>
            of the war in those parts. The other eleven ships sailed to <lb/>
            Italy, hearing that some vessels laden with treasure were on <lb/>
            their way to the Athenians. Having fallen in with these ves­ <lb/>
            sels, they destroyed most of their contents, and burnt a quan­ <lb/>
            tity of timber in the Caulonian territory, which had been got <lb/>
            ready for the Athenians. After this they came to Locri, and <lb/>
            while lying at anchor there, one of the merchantmen from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese put in to shore, carrying a heavy-armed band of <lb/>
            Thespians. Having taken these on board their ships, the Sy­ <lb/>
            racusans coasted on homewards. The Athenians, with their <lb/>
            twenty vessels at Megara, being on the look-out for them, <lb/>
            took one ship with its crew ; the rest they could not overtake, <lb/>
            but they escaped from them to Syracuse. There was also <lb/>
            some skirmishing in the harbour about the piles which the <lb/>
            Syracusans had driven in the sea in front of the old docks, in <lb/>
            order that their ships might lie at anchor within them, and <lb/>
            the Athenians might not sail against them, and injure them by <lb/>
            their charge. For the Athenians having brought up to them <lb/>
            a ship of ten thousand talents burden, carrying wooden towers <lb/>
            and screens, from their boats fastened ropes round the piles, <lb/>
            and raised them with windlasses, and tore them up, or, diving <lb/>
            down, sawed them in two. The Syracusans plied their mis­ <lb/>
            siles on them from the docks, and the men on the ship of bur­ <lb/>
            den discharged theirs in return ; and at last the Athenians <lb/>
            removed the greater part of the piles. But the most dangerous <lb/>
            part of the stockade was that out of sight: for there were some <lb/>
            of the piles which they drove that did not rise above the sur­ <lb/>
            face of the sea, so that it was- dangerous to approach, lest any <lb/>
            one, through not seeing them beforehand, might strike his ship <lb/>
            on them, as on a sunken rock. But even in the case of these <lb/>
            divers went down and sawed them off for a reward ; but the <lb/>
            Syracusans made, notwithstanding, a fresh stockade. Many <pb n="465"/>
            <note type="margin"> 26,27.] </note> <lb/>
            other also were the contrivances which they employed against <lb/>
            one another, as was natural with the armaments lying near, and <lb/>
            opposed to, each other ; and they were engaged in skirmishes, <lb/>
            and attempts of every kind. The Syracusans also sent to the <lb/>
            cities embassies composed of Corinthians, Ambraciots, and <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, with tidings of the capture of Plemyrium, <lb/>
            and to state, with regard to the sea-fight, that it was not so <lb/>
            much by the power of the enemy as by their own confusion <lb/>
            that they had been beaten ; while, in other respects, they were <lb/>
            to inform them that they were in good hope, and to call upor <lb/>
            them to come to their aid, both with ships and troops; as the <lb/>
            Athenians also were expected with a fresh force, and if they <lb/>
            could but destroy their present armament before it came, there <lb/>
            would be an end to the war. The parties in Sicily, then, were <lb/>
            thus engaged.</p>
          <p>26. Demosthenes, on the other hand, when the armament <lb/>
            had been collected by him with which he was to sail to Sicily <lb/>
            to the aid of the force there, having put to sea from Ægina <lb/>
            and sailed to the Peloponnese, joined Charicles and the thirty <lb/>
            ships of the Athenians. After receiving the heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops of the Argives on board their ships, they sailed to La­ <lb/>
            conia, and in the first place ravaged a part of Epidaurus <lb/>
            Limera. Then, landing on the coast of Laconia opposite <lb/>
            Cythera, where stands the temple of Apollo, they fortified a <lb/>
            certain place in the form of an isthmus, in order that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian helots might desert to them there, and at the <lb/>
            same time foraging parties might make incursions from it, as <lb/>
            from Pylus. And now, immediately after assisting to oc­ <lb/>
            cupy this spot, Demosthenes sailed on for Corcyra, that he <lb/>
            might take up some of the allies there also, and proceed as <lb/>
            quickly as possible on his voyage to Sicily. Charicles, on the <lb/>
            other hand, waited until he had entirely fortified the place ; <lb/>
            when, having left a garrison there, he, too, afterwards returned <lb/>
            home with his thirty ships, and the Argives at the same time.</p>
          <p>27. There came also to Athens this same summer, to serve <lb/>
            as targeteers, a body of Thracians who carry swords, of the <lb/>
            tribe of the Dii, thirteen hundred in number, who were to <lb/>
            have sailed to Sicily with Demosthenes ; but as they had come <lb/>
            too late, the Athenians determined to send them back again to <lb/>
            Thracc) the country they had come from, as it seemed too ex­ <lb/>
            pensive to keep them for the war carried on from Decelea. <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note> <pb n="466"/>

            since each of them received a drachma a day. For since De­ <lb/>
            celea had been first fortified by the whole Peloponnesian army <lb/>
            during this summer, and afterwards was occupied for the an­ <lb/>
            noyance of the country by garrisons coming from the states at <lb/>
            successive periods, it greatly injured the Athenians, and was <lb/>
            amongst the principal things that ruined their interests, both <lb/>
            by the destruction of property and the loss of men. For pre­ <lb/>
            viously the invasions were but of brief duration, and did not <lb/>
            prevent their enjoying their territory at other times ; but then, <lb/>
            when the enemy were continually stationed there for their an­ <lb/>
            noyance, and sometimes attacked them with a more numerous <lb/>
            force, while at other times the regular garrison 1 of necessity <lb/>
            made incursions on the land, and forayed it, Agis the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonian king being also present, (who made no by­ <lb/>
            work of the war,) the Athenians suffered severely in conse­ <lb/>
            quence ; for they were deprived of their whole country, and <lb/>
            more than twenty thousand slaves had deserted, a great part <lb/>
            of them being artisans ; and all their sheep and beasts of bur­ <lb/>
            den were lost. Their horses also, as the cavalry were daily <lb/>
            on the move, making excursions to Decelea and keeping guard <lb/>
            in the country, were either lamed by being worked on rocky <lb/>
            ground, and that continually, or were disabled by wounds.</p>
          <p>28. The conveyance also of provisions from Euboea, which <lb/>
            was before effected more quickly by land from Oropus, through <lb/>
            Decelea, was now carried on with great expense by sea, round <lb/>
            Sunium. Indeed the city required every thing alike to be <lb/>
            imported; and instead of being a city, it was reduced to a <lb/>
            garrison. For the Athenians were harassed by keeping guard <lb/>
            on the fortifications, in succession by day, and all of them <lb/>
            (excepting the cavalry) by night-some being on duty where <lb/>
            the arms were piled, and others on the walls-both sum­ <lb/>
            mer and winter alike. But what pressed hardest on them <lb/>
            was, that they were engaged in two wars at once, and <lb/>
            had arrived at such a pitch of obstinate animosity as no one <lb/>
            would have believed, if he had heard it before it actually <lb/>
            occurred. For that even when besieged by the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians from the fortress in their country, they should not <lb/>
            even then have withdrawn from Sicily, but have proceeded, in <lb/>
            their turn, to besiege Syracuse in the same manner, a city not <lb/>
            less than Athens, considered by itself; and that they should <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξξ ανά</foreign><hi rend="overline"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κης</foreign></hi> i. e. for their own support </note> <pb n="467"/>

            </note>have exhibited to the Greeks so unexpected a display of power <lb/>
            and daring, that whereas, in the beginning of the war, some <lb/>
            of them thought they might hold out one year, some two, <lb/>
            some even three, but no one longer, if the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            should invade their country, they now, in the seventeenth <lb/>
            year after the first invasion, went to Sicily, when distressed <lb/>
            by hostilities in every way, and entered upon another war be­ <lb/>
            sides, not less important than that which they already had with <lb/>
            the Peloponnese, 1 [who, I say, would have believed this before <lb/>
            it actually took place ?] It was owing to these things, then, <lb/>
            to the great injury which Decelea inflicted on them, and the <lb/>
            other great expenses which befell them, that they were re­ <lb/>
            duced to straits for want of money; and it was at this time <lb/>
            that they imposed on their subjects the tax of 2 the twentieth <lb/>
            on all sea-borne commodities, instead of the tribute, thinking <lb/>
            that thus a larger amount of money would be raised by them. <lb/>
            For their expenses were not on the same scale as before, but <lb/>
            much greater; inasmuch as the war also was greater, while <lb/>
            their revenues were being destroyed.</p>
          <p>29. These Thracians, then, who came too late for Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, as they did not, in consequence of their present want <lb/>
            of money, wish to incur expense, they immediately sent back, <lb/>
            having commissioned Diitrephes to convey them, and in­ <lb/>
            structed him at the same time to inflict by their means what­ <lb/>
            ever harm he could on the enemy during the voyage along <lb/>
            shore, (for they were to pass through the Euripus.) Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly he landed them at Tanagra, and carried off some plunder <lb/>
            in a hurried manner ; and then in the evening sailed across <lb/>
            the Euripus from Chalcis in Eubœa, and landing them in <lb/>
            Bœotia, led them against Mycalessus. During the night he <lb/>
            bivouacked unobserved near the temple of Mercury, distant <lb/>
            from Mycalessus about sixteen stades, and at day-break as­ <lb/>
            saulted the town, which was not a large one, and took it; <lb/>
            having fallen on the inhabitants whilst off their guard, and not <lb/>
            expecting that any one would ever march up the country so <lb/>
            far from the sea to attack them; their wall, too, being weak, <lb/>
            and in some parts even fallen down, while in other parts it <note type="footnote"> 1 Owing to the length of the sentence in the original, the apodosis was <lb/>

            was built but low; and the gates, moreover, being open through <lb/>
            their feeling of security. The Thracians, then, having burst <lb/>
            into Mycalessus, plundered both private houses and temples, <lb/>
            and butchered the inhabitants, sparing neither old age nor <lb/>
            youth, but killing one after another all they met with, both <lb/>
            children and women, nay, further, even cattle and beasts of <lb/>
            burden, and whatever other living things they saw. For the <lb/>
            Thracian race, like the most blood-thirsty of the barbarians, <lb/>
            is most so when secure from resistance. And thus on that <lb/>
            occasion there was no little confusion in other respects, and <lb/>
            every form of butchery was exhibited. And, in particular, <lb/>
            they attacked a boys' school, the largest there was in the place, <lb/>
            (which the children had just entered,) and cut them all to <lb/>
            pieces. And this disaster, which fell on the whole town, was <lb/>
            inferior to none in extent, while it was more unexpected and <lb/>
            shocking than any other.</p>
          <p>30. When the Thebans were aware of it, they marched to <lb/>
            the rescue; and having overtaken the Thracians when they <lb/>
            had not at present advanced any great distance, they both re­ <lb/>
            covered their plundered property, and having struck them <lb/>
            with panic pursued them down to the sea, where their boats <lb/>
            which conveyed them were lying at anchor. And they slew <lb/>
            the greatest part of them during their embarkation, as they <lb/>
            could not swim, and as those on board the boats, on seeing <lb/>
            what was going on ashore, moored them out of bow-shot. <lb/>
            For in the rest of'the retreat the Thracians advanced in <lb/>
            no contemptible manner to meet the Theban horse, which <lb/>
            first fell upon them ; and closing their ranks, according to <lb/>
            their native tactics, defended themselves against them; and <lb/>
            thus only a few were killed in that part of the affair. Some <lb/>
            portion of them also were surprised in the city, through their <lb/>
            eagerness in plundering, and perished. Altogether, there fell <lb/>
            of the Thracians two hundred and fifty out of thirteen hun­ <lb/>
            dred ; while of the Thebans and the rest who joined in at­ <lb/>
            tacking them they slew about twenty, horse and foot together, <lb/>
            and amongst the Thebans, Scirphondas, one of the Bœotarchs. <lb/>
            On the side of the Mycalessians a considerable part of the <lb/>
            population was cut off. With regard, then, to Mycalessus, <lb/>
            which experienced, considering its extent, a calamity not less <lb/>
            lamentable than any which happened in the war, such were the <lb/>
            things which occurred there. <pb n="469"/>
            <note type="margin"> 31, 32.1 </note> </p>
          <p>31. Now Demosthenes being at that time on his voyage for <lb/>
            Corcyra, after he had built the fortifications on the side of <lb/>
            Laconia, fell in with a merchant vessel anchored at Phea in <lb/>
            the Elean territory, in which the Corinthian heavy-armed <lb/>
            were to cross over to Sicily ; and he destroyed the ship itself, <lb/>
            but the men escaped from it, and having subsequently got <lb/>
            another, proceeded on their voyage. After this, having come <lb/>
            to Zacynthus and Cephallenia, he took on board a body of <lb/>
            heavy-armed, sent for some of the Messenians from Naupactus, <lb/>
            and then crossed over to the opposite coast of Acarnania, on <lb/>
            the continent, to Alyzia and Anactorium, which the Athenians <lb/>
            had in their own hands. While he was in these parts, he was <lb/>
            met by Eurymedon returning from Sicily; who had been sent <lb/>
            out with treasure at the time that has been mentioned, during <lb/>
            the winter, and told him, amongst other tidings, that he had <lb/>
            heard, when already on his voyage, that Plemyrium had been <lb/>
            taken by the Syracusans. Conon, too, who was in command <lb/>
            at Naupactus, came to them, with information that the five and <lb/>
            twenty Corinthian ships stationed opposite to I the Athenian <lb/>
            squadron did not give up hostilities, but were prepared for <lb/>
            an engagement. He begged them therefore to send him some <lb/>
            ships, as his own eighteen were not competent to fight the <lb/>
            enemy's five and twenty. Accordingly Demosthenes and <lb/>
            Eurymedon sent with Conon the ten best sailers of all they <lb/>
            had, tn join those at Naupactus. They themselves at the <lb/>
            same time made preparations for the muster of their forces, <lb/>
            Eurymedon sailing to Corcyra, urging them to man fifteen <lb/>
            ships, and enlisting heavy-armed troops, (for he now shared <lb/>
            the command with Demosthenes, and had turned back again, <lb/>
            in consequence of his election,) and Demosthenes raising <lb/>
            slingers and dart-men from the parts about Acarnania,</p>
          <p>32. As for the ambassadors who had gone at the time men­ <lb/>
            tioned—after the taking of Plemyrium-from Syracuse to the <lb/>
            cities, they had prevailed on them to join their side, and had <lb/>
            raised and were just about to lead off the force, when Nicias, <lb/>
            receiving early intelligence of it, sent to those of the Sicels <lb/>
            who held the passes, and were in alliance with the Athenians, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">σΦίσιν</foreign> In this and in many other similar passages, the reflexive pro­ <lb/>

            namely, the Centotripes, Alicyæans, and some others, to beg <lb/>
            them not to give free passage to the enemy, but to unite together <lb/>
            and prevent their marching through their country, since there <lb/>
            was no other by which they would attempt to do so, as the <lb/>
            Acragantines would not grant them a passage through theirs. <lb/>
            When therefore the Siceliots were even on their march, the <lb/>
            Sicels, in compliance with the request of the Athenians, laid <lb/>
            an ambuscade for them in three different places, and falling <lb/>
            upon them while off their guard and without any notice, killed <lb/>
            about eight hundred of them, with all the ambassadors ex­ <lb/>
            cept one, namely, the Corinthian, who led to Syracuse those <lb/>
            that bundescaped, to the number of fifteen hundred.</p>
          <p>33. About that same time the Camarinasans also came to <lb/>
            their help with five hundred heavy-armed, three hundred dart­ <lb/>
            men, and three hundred bow-men. The Geloans, too, sent a <lb/>
            squadron of five ships, four hundred dart-men,'and two hun­ <lb/>
            dred horse. For by this time pretty nearly the whole of <lb/>
            Sicily—excepting the Acragantines, who were neutral-the <lb/>
            rest, I say, who before had waited to see the result of events, <lb/>
            now united with the Syracusans, and assisted them against <lb/>
            the Athenians. The Syracusans, then, after the disaster in <lb/>
            the Sicel country had befallen them, ceased for the present <lb/>
            from attacking the Athenians. Demosthenes and Eurymedon, <lb/>
            on the,other hand, their forces being now ready both from <lb/>
            Corcyra and the continent, crossed the Ionian gulf with all <lb/>
            their army to the Iapygian foreland. Starting thence, they <lb/>
            touched at the Chœrades islands, lying off Iapygia, and took <lb/>
            on board their ships some Iapygian dart-men, one hundred <lb/>
            and fifty in number, of the Messapian tribe; and after re­ <lb/>
            newing an old friendship with Artas, who also had provided <lb/>
            them with the dart-men, being one of their chieftains, they ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Metapontum in Italy. After persuading the Meta­ <lb/>
            pontines to send with them, on the strength of their alliance, <lb/>
            three hundred dart-men and two triremes, with this addition <lb/>
            to their armament they coasted along to Thuria. There <lb/>
            they found the opponents of the Athenians recently expelled in <lb/>
            consequence of a sedition. And as they wished to muster <lb/>
            there the whole army, in case any part had been left behind, <lb/>
            and to review it, as well as to persuade the Thurians to join <lb/>
            them as zealously as possible in the expedition, and to have <pb n="471"/>
            <note type="margin"> 34] </note> <lb/>
            considering their present position, the same foes and friends <lb/>
            as the Athenians, they waited awhile in Thuria, and were pro­ <lb/>
            secuting these designs.</p>
          <p>34. About the same time, the Peloponnesians in the five <lb/>
            and twenty ships, who, to secure the passage of the merchant­ <lb/>
            men to Sicily, were anchored over against the fleet at Nau­ <lb/>
            pactus, having made their preparations for a sea-fight, and <lb/>
            having manned some additional ships, so that they were now <lb/>
            but little inferior to the Athenian force, stationed themselves <lb/>
            off Erineus in Achæa, in the territory of Rhypa. And the <lb/>
            place in which they were stationed being in the form of a <lb/>
            crescent, their land forces which had come to their assistance <lb/>
            from the Corinthians, and from their allies on the spot, were <lb/>
            ranged on the projecting headlands on both sides; while the <lb/>
            ships occupied the intervening space, blocking up the entrance. <lb/>
            The commander of the fleet was Polyanthes, a Corinthian. <lb/>
            The Athenians sailed out against them from Naupactus with <lb/>
            three and thirty ships, under the command of Diphilus. The <lb/>
            Corinthians at first remained stationary, but afterwards, hav­ <lb/>
            ing raised their signal for battle, when there appeared to be a <lb/>
            favourable opportunity, they advanced upon the Athenians, and <lb/>
            engaged them. For a long time they resisted each other; at <lb/>
            length three ships on the side of the Corinthians were de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, while on that of the Athenians none was absolutely <lb/>
            sunk, but some seven were disabled, being struck prow to prow, <lb/>
            and having their foreships stove in by the Corinthian vessels, <lb/>
            which were provided with stronger 'cheeks than usual for <lb/>
            this very purpose. After fighting on equal terms, so that <lb/>
            either party might claim the victory, (though the Athenians, <lb/>
            nevertheless, had got possession of the wrecks, through the <lb/>
            wind driving them out into the open sea, and the Corinthians <lb/>
            no longer advancing against them,) they separated from each <lb/>
            other, and there was no pursuit made, nor were any prisoners <lb/>
            taken on either side: for the Corinthians and Peloponnesians <lb/>
            easily effected their escape, as they were fighting near shore, <lb/>
            and no ship on the side of the Athenians went down. When, <lb/>
            however, the Athenians had sailed back to Naupactus, the Ccr- <note type="footnote"> I Tas <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπωτιδας</foreign>] " The word is known only in its technical sense, su <lb/>

            intbians immediately erected a trophy, as conquerors; because <lb/>
            they had disabled a greater number of their enemy's ships, <lb/>
            and considered that they were not beaten, for the very same <lb/>
            reason that the other party considered them not to have con­ <lb/>
            quered : for the Corinthians regarded themselves as having the <lb/>
            advantage if they were not decidedly beaten, and the Athenians <lb/>
            considered them to be worsted, because they were not decidedly <lb/>
            conquerors. But when the Peloponnesians had sailed off, and <lb/>
            their troops had dispersed, the Athenians erected a trophy on <lb/>
            their side also, as having gained the victory, in Achaea, at <lb/>
            about twenty stades distance from Erineus, where the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthians were stationed. And so ended the sea-fight,</p>
          <p>35. Now Demosthenes and Eurymedon, when the Thurians <lb/>
            were prepared to join them in the expedition with seven hun­ <lb/>
            dred heavy-armed and three hundred dart-men, gave orders for <lb/>
            the ships to coast along towards, the Crotonian territory ; while <lb/>
            they themselves, having first reviewed all the land forces on <lb/>
            the river Sybaris, proceeded to lead them through the Thurian <lb/>
            country. When they were on the banks of the river Hylias, <lb/>
            and the Crotonians sent to them, and said that they should not <lb/>
            choose the army to pass through their territory, they descend­ <lb/>
            ed towards the shore, and encamped for the night by the sea, <lb/>
            at the mouth of the Hylias, their ships also meeting them <lb/>
            at the. same point. The following day, having put their men <lb/>
            on board, they coasted along, touching at all the cities, except­ <lb/>
            ing Locri, until they came to Petra in the Rhegian territory.</p>
          <p>36. The Syracusans, in the mean time, hearing of their ap­ <lb/>
            proach, wished to make a second attempt with their fleet and <lb/>
            other forces on shore, which they were collecting for this very <lb/>
            object, being desirous of striking a blow before they came. <lb/>
            Now they had equipped the rest of their navy according as <lb/>
            they saw, from the result of the former sea-fight, that they <lb/>
            would obtain any advantage ; and having cut down their <lb/>
            ships' prows into a less compass, they made them firmer than <lb/>
            usual, by fixing stout cheeks to them, and attaching 1 stays <lb/>
            from these to the ships' sides, for the length of six cubits both <note type="footnote">1 " The epotides were laid on the bow or stem of the vessel, and were part­ <lb/>
            ly within and partly without the frame of the hull, just as a ship's bowsprit <lb/>
            is at present. For the length of six cubits, whether from the prow, as Do­ <lb/>
            bree understands it, or from the inner extremity of the epotides, ' they sup­ <lb/>
            ported these cheeks by a set of spars (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντηρίδας</foreign>) that went irom the cheeks <lb/>
            to the ship's side, both inside and outside the ship.' "-Arnold. </note> <pb n="473"/>
            <note type="margin"> 37.] <lb/>
            </note>inside and outside the vessel; in the very same way as the <lb/>
            Corinthians had equipped their ships ahead against the squa­ <lb/>
            dron at Naupactus, and then proceeded to engage it. For the <lb/>
            Syracusans thought that in this way they would have an ad­ <lb/>
            vantage against the Athenian vessels, which were not in the <lb/>
            same manner built to resist them, but were slight ahead, (because <lb/>
            they did not charge prow to prow so much as on the side, after <lb/>
            taking a circuit;) and, moreover, that the battle being fought <lb/>
            in the larger harbour, against a great number of ships in no <lb/>
            great space, would be in their favour; for that by charging <lb/>
            stem to stem they would stave in their prows, striking as <lb/>
            they would with solid and stout beaks against hollow and weak <lb/>
            ones. Nor would the Athenians in their narrow room have <lb/>
            opportunity 1 of sailing round or cutting through their line, <lb/>
            the manoeuvres of their naval science in which they most con­ <lb/>
            fided ; for they themselves, to. the best of their power, would <lb/>
            not allow them to cut through their line, and the want of room <lb/>
            would prevent their making a circuit. And what was before <lb/>
            thought to be want of skill in masters, namely, to charge stem <lb/>
            to stem, was the very method they would chiefly adopt; for <lb/>
            they would have the advantage in it; as the Athenians, if <lb/>
            forced out of the line, would have no means of backing water <lb/>
            in any direction but towards shore, and that, too, at only a short <lb/>
            distance from them, and for a short space, namely, just oppo­ <lb/>
            site their own encampment. The rest of the harbour they <lb/>
            should themselves command ; and the enemy, if forced at any <lb/>
            point, by crowding together into a confined space, and all to <lb/>
            the same point, would run foul of each other, and be thrown <lb/>
            into confusion; (the very thing, indeed, which most hurt the <lb/>
            Athenians in all their sea-fights, since they had not, like the <lb/>
            Syracusans, the power of retreating over the whole harbour.) <lb/>
            And as for making a circuit into clearer sea-room, since they <lb/>
            themselves commanded the entrance from, and the retreat <lb/>
            into, the open deep, they would not be able to do it; espe­ <lb/>
            cially as Plemyrium would be hostile to them, and the mouth <lb/>
            of the harbour was not large.</p>
          <p>37. Having adopted such contrivances to suit their own de- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίπλουν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">διέκπλουνΤ</foreign>hese manoeuvres, as well as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνἀκρουσις</foreign> <lb/>
            afterwards mentioned, were different methods of giving the ship a momen­ <lb/>
            tum required for a second attack. See Arnold's notes on I. 49. 3, and II <lb/>

            gree of knowledge and power, and at the same time feeling <lb/>
            now more assured in consequence of their former battle, the <lb/>
            Syracusans prepared to attack them at once by land and by <lb/>
            sea. Those of their land forces which were in the city Gylip­ <lb/>
            pus led out a little before, and brought them up to the wall of <lb/>
            the Athenians, at that part of it which looked towards the city ; <lb/>
            while the troops from the Olympieum, both all the heavy-armed <lb/>
            that were there, and the horse and light-armed of the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, advanced against the wall on the other side ; immedi­ <lb/>
            ately after which, the ships of the Syracusans and their allies <lb/>
            sailed out. The Athenians thought at first that they would <lb/>
            make an attempt on the land side alone, but when they saw <lb/>
            their fleet also suddenly coming against them, they were <lb/>
            thrown into alarm ; and some were making preparations on <lb/>
            and in front of the walls to meet the attack, while others <lb/>
            marched out against those who with all speed were coming <lb/>
            from the Olympieum and the parts outside the city-both <lb/>
            horse in great numbers and dart-men-and others proceeded <lb/>
            to man the ships, and at once ran to the beach to oppose the <lb/>
            enemy. And when they were manned, they put out against <lb/>
            them with seventy-five vessels, those of the Syracusans being <lb/>
            about eighty in number.</p>
          <p>38. For a great part of the day they continued advancing <lb/>
            and retiring and making attempts upon one another ; and when <lb/>
            neither party could gain any advantage worth mentioning, ex­ <lb/>
            cept that the Syracusans sank one or two of the Athenians' <lb/>
            ships, they separated; and the troops at the same time with­ <lb/>
            drew from the walls. The next day the Syracusans regained <lb/>
            quiet, without showing at all what were their plans for the <lb/>
            future. Nicias, on the other hand, seeing that the battle had <lb/>
            been a drawn one, and expecting that they would attack them <lb/>
            again, compelled the captains to refit their ships, whichever of <lb/>
            them had at all suffered; and stationed merchantmen before the <lb/>
            stockade which had been fixed in the sea in front of their ships, <lb/>
            to serve the purpose of an enclosed harbour. These vessels he <lb/>
            placed at intervals of two hundred feet from each other, that <lb/>
            if any ship were bard pressed, it might have means of retreat­ <lb/>
            ing in safety and sailing out again at leisure. The Athenians, <lb/>
            then, continued to make these preparations during the whole <lb/>
            day until the night.</p>
          <p>39. The day following, the Syracusans engaged the Athe- <pb n="475"/>
            <note type="margin"> 40.] <lb/>
            </note>nians at an earlier hour, but on the same plan of attack, both <lb/>
            by sea and by land. And being opposed in the same manner <lb/>
            with their ships, they again continued making attempts upon <lb/>
            each other for a great part of the day; until Aristo son of <lb/>
            Pyrrhicus, a Corinthian, and the most able master the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans had, persuaded their naval commanders to send to those <lb/>
            who had the direction in the city, and beg them to remove as <lb/>
            quickly as possible the supply of things for sale, and to bring <lb/>
            it to the sea-side ; and whatever eatables any one had, to <lb/>
            compel all to come there and sell them ; that so 1they might <lb/>
            enable them to land their seamen and take their dinner imme­ <lb/>
            diately by the side of their ships, and, after a short interval, <lb/>
            again the very same day to attack the Athenians, when they <lb/>
            were not expecting it.</p>
          <p>40. They, then, in compliance with this request sent a mes­ <lb/>
            senger, and the market was prepared: upon which the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans suddenly backed water and sailed to the city, landing <lb/>
            immediately, and taking their dinner: while the Athenians, <lb/>
            supposing that they had retreated to the city because they <lb/>
            were worsted by them, went ashore at their leisure, and were <lb/>
            engaged both with other matters and with providing their din­ <lb/>
            ner, imagining that for that day -at least they would not have <lb/>
            to fight again. But the Syracusans having suddenly manned <lb/>
            their ships, sailed out against them a second time; while they, <lb/>
            in much confusion, and most of them unrefreshed, went on <lb/>
            board without any order, and with great difficulty put off to <lb/>
            meet them. For some time they forbore from attacking each <lb/>
            other, and stood on their guard ; but afterwards the Athenians <lb/>
            did not choose through their own act to be worn out with fa­ <lb/>
            tigue by waiting there, but to attack them as quickly as pos­ <lb/>
            sible ; and so they advanced with a cheer, and commenced the <lb/>
            action. The Syracusans received them, and charging with <lb/>
            their ships stem to stem, as they had determined beforehand, <lb/>
            with their beaks equipped as they were, they stove in the <lb/>
            Athenian vessels to a considerable extent of the foreships, <lb/>
            while the dart-men fighting on their decks inflicted great <lb/>
            damage on the Athenians, and still more those Syracusans who <lb/>
            were sailing about in their small boats, falling close in upon <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοι̃ς</foreign>.] " According to the rule given in the note on III. 98. 1, the <lb/>

            the oars of the enemy's ships, sailing up to their sides, aud <lb/>
            thence discharging their darts upon the seamen.</p>
          <p>41. At length, by fighting in this way with all their might, <lb/>
            the Syracusans gained the victory, and the Athenians turned <lb/>
            and fled between the merchantmen into their own station. <lb/>
            The Syracusan ships pursued them as far as those vessels ; but <lb/>
            then the beams that were hung from the merchantmen over <lb/>
            the passages between them, with 1 dolphins attached to them, <lb/>
            stopped their progress. Two, however, elated by their victory, <lb/>
            came up close to them, and were destroyed, one of them being <lb/>
            captured with its crew. After the Syracusans had sunk seven <lb/>
            Athenian ships and disabled many more, having taken some <lb/>
            of the men prisoners and killed others, they retired, and erect­ <lb/>
            ed trophies for both the engagements; entertaining now a <lb/>
            confident hope that by sea they were very decidedly superior, <lb/>
            and thinking that they should conquer the enemy's land forces <lb/>
            also. Accordingly they began to prepare for making another <lb/>
            attack in both ways.</p>
          <p>42. At this time Demosthenes and Eurymedon arrived <lb/>
            with the succours from Athens, consisting of above seventy- <lb/>
            three ships (including the foreign ones) and about five thou­ <lb/>
            sand heavy-armed of their own and the allies, with dart-men, <lb/>
            both Grecian and barbarian, not a few, slingers, bow-men, and <lb/>
            the rest of the armament on a large scale. No slight con­ <lb/>
            sternation was produced at the moment amongst the Syracu­ <lb/>
            sans and their allies, at the thought that they were to have <lb/>
            no final deliverance from their dangers, seeing that there was <lb/>
            newly come, none the less for the fortification of Decelea. <lb/>
            an armament equal, or nearly so, to the first, and that the <lb/>
            power of the Athenians appeared great on all sides ; while in <lb/>
            the former Athenian forces fresh confidence (considering their <lb/>
            late misfortunes) had now sprung up. Demosthenes, on the <lb/>
            other hand, seeing how matters stood, thought that it was not <lb/>
            possible for him to waste the time, and so to experience the <lb/>
            fate which Nicias had done. For although that general spread <lb/>
            terror on his first arrival, he was despised, through not imme­ <lb/>
            diately attacking Syracuse, but spending the winter at Catana, <lb/>
            and Gylippus anticipated his, success by arriving with forces <lb/>
            from the Peloponnese, which the Syracusans would never have <lb/>
            sent for at all if he had immediately attacked them ; for while <note type="footnote">1 i. e. heavy weights made something in the form of that fish. </note> <pb n="477"/>
            <note type="margin"> 43] </note> <lb/>
            fancying themselves a match for him, they would at once have <lb/>
            discovered their in eriority, and have been invested; so that, <lb/>
            even if they had sent for them, they would not then have done <lb/>
            them the same service. Reviewing these things, then, and <lb/>
            thinking that he himself too was decidedly most formidable <lb/>
            to the adversary at the present time, even the very first day, <lb/>
            Demosthenes wished, as quickly as possible, to avail himself to <lb/>
            the utmost of the present dismay of their forces. And seeing <lb/>
            that the counter-wall of the Syracusans, by which they bad <lb/>
            prevented the Athenians from circumvallating them, was but <lb/>
            a single one, and that if any one had carried the ascent to Epi­ <lb/>
            polæ, and then the camp on it, the work might easily be taken, <lb/>
            (for no one at all would so much as wait his attack,) he was in <lb/>
            a hurry to make the attempt. And this he thought was his <lb/>
            shortest way of bringing the war to a conclusion ; for he would <lb/>
            either gain possession of Syracuse by succeeding in his design, <lb/>
            or lead back the armament, and not exhaust for no purpose both <lb/>
            the Athenians who joined the expedition and the whole state. <lb/>
            In the first place, then, the Athenians went out and ravaged <lb/>
            a part of the Syracusan territory, about the Anapus, and were <lb/>
            superior in force, as they had originally been, both by land <lb/>
            and by sea: (for in neither way did the Syracusans come out <lb/>
            against them, except with their cavalry and dart-men from the <lb/>
            Olympieum.)</p>
          <p>43. Afterwards, Demosthenes resolved first to make an at­ <lb/>
            tempt on the counter-work with engines. But when the <lb/>
            engines, after he had brought them up, were burnt by the <lb/>
            enemy who were making a defence from the wall, and they <lb/>
            were beaten back when charging at many points with the rest <lb/>
            of his forces, he determined to delay no longer; but having <lb/>
            gained the assent of Nicias and the rest of his colleagues, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the plan he had formed, he proceeded to the attempt <lb/>
            on Epipolæ. Now, in the day-time it seemed to be impossible <lb/>
            for them to approach and make the ascent unobserved. But <lb/>
            having issued orders for five days' provisions, and taken all <lb/>
            the stone-masons and carpenters, with all the other apparatus <lb/>
            besides, both arrows and every thing else that was necessary <lb/>
            for them, should they succeed, to have while they were build­ <lb/>
            ing, he himself, with Eurymedon and Menander, took the whole <lb/>
            torce, after the first watch of the night, and advanced against <lb/>
            Epipolæ, Nicias being left behind in the lines. When they <pb n="478"/>
            <note type="margin"> [44. </note> <lb/>
            had come up to the hill on the side of Euryelus, the same way <lb/>
            that the former army also had in the first instance made tha <lb/>
            ascent, they escaped the observation of the Syracusan guard, <lb/>
            and having gone to the fort of the Syracusans which was there, <lb/>
            they took it, and put part of the garrison to the sword. But <lb/>
            the greater part fled immediately to the camps, (of which there <lb/>
            were three on Epipolæ, in outworks, one composed of the Sy­ <lb/>
            racusans, one of the other Siceliots, and one of their allies,) <lb/>
            and informed them of the attack, and told it to the six hun­ <lb/>
            dred Syracusans who had formed the original guard at this <lb/>
            part of Epipolæ. They immediately went against them ; and <lb/>
            Demosthenes and the Athenians falling in with them, routed <lb/>
            them, though they made a spirited resistance. They then <lb/>
            immediately pressed on, that they might not be retarded in <lb/>
            their present eagerness for accomplishing the objects they <lb/>
            had come for: while others of them proceeded, as their first <lb/>
            measure, to take the counter-wall of the Syracusans, and pull <lb/>
            down its battlements. The Syracusans and their allies, as <lb/>
            well as Gylippus and his division, went to the rescue from the <lb/>
            outworks ; and as they had had this daring attack made on <lb/>
            them in the night, they engaged the Athenians in some dis­ <lb/>
            may, and were at first compelled to retreat. But when the <lb/>
            Athenians were now advancing in greater confusion, as having <lb/>
            gained the victory, and were anxious to pass as quickly as pos­ <lb/>
            sible through the whole force of the enemy which had not yet <lb/>
            been engaged, that they might not rally again through their <lb/>
            relaxing in the attack; the Boeotians were the first to oppose <lb/>
            them, and both broke them by their charge, and put them to <lb/>
            flight.</p>
          <p>44. Now the Athenians were by this time in much disorder <lb/>
            and perplexity; but on this subject it was not easy for me to <lb/>
            ascertain from either side, in what way each event occurred. <lb/>
            For in the day-time the parties engaged have, indeed, a clearer <lb/>
            knowledge, though not a perfect one even then, for each man <lb/>
            barely knows what happens in his own part of the field. But <lb/>
            in a night engagement, (and this was the only one which oc­ <lb/>
            curred between great armies during this war,) how could <lb/>
            any one have a distinct knowledge of any thing ? For <lb/>
            though there was a bright moon, they only saw one another <lb/>
            (as was natural they should by moonlight) so as to discern the <lb/>
            form of the body before them, but to mistrust their knowledge <pb n="479"/>

            of its being that of a friend. And there were no few heavy- <lb/>
            armed on each side moving in a narrow space. Thus on the <lb/>
            side of the Athenians some were even now being defeated, and <lb/>
            others coming up unconquered for their first attack. A large <lb/>
            part, too, of the rest of their forces had only just ascended, <lb/>
            and others were still ascending ; so that they did not know on <lb/>
            what point to advance. For in consequence of the rout which <lb/>
            had taken place, every thing in front was now in confusion, <lb/>
            and it was difficult to distinguish orders through the uproar. For <lb/>
            the Syracusans and their allies, on gaining the advantage, <lb/>
            were cheering each other with no little shouting, (it being <lb/>
            impossible during the night to express themselves in any <lb/>
            other way,) and at the same time were receiving the charge of <lb/>
            their assailants: and the Athenians were in search of one <lb/>
            another, and thought that whoever met them was a foe, even <lb/>
            though he might be a friend, belonging to those who were <lb/>
            now flying back. And by their frequently asking for the <lb/>
            watchword, because they could not by any other means dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish them, they both caused great confusion on their own <lb/>
            side by all asking at once, and made it known to the enemy; <lb/>
            while theirs, on the other hand, they did not so easily dis­ <lb/>
            cover, because, as they were victorious and not dispersed, <lb/>
            they were better recognised by each other. So that if they <lb/>
            fell in with any of the enemy with the advantage of numbers <lb/>
            cn their own side, the Syracusans escaped from them, inas­ <lb/>
            much as they knew the Athenian watchword; but if they <lb/>
            themselves [in such a case] did not answer, they were put to <lb/>
            the sword. But what especially and in the greatest degree <lb/>
            hurt them, was the singing of their hymns ; for as it was very <lb/>
            similar on each side, it occasioned perplexity. For the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, the Corcyræans, and all of the Dorian race that were <lb/>
            with the Athenians, struck terror into them whenever they <lb/>
            raised their paean ; and so did the enemy likewise. Thus having <lb/>
            at last, when once they were thrown into disorder, come into <lb/>
            collision with each other in different parts of the army, friends <lb/>
            with friends, and countrymen with countrymen, they were not <lb/>
            only full of fear, but even closed in battle with each other, <lb/>
            and were with difficulty parted. And now, as they were <lb/>
            being pursued, the greater part threw themselves down the <lb/>
            cliffs, and perished ; as the way down again from Epipolæ was <lb/>
            narrow. And when those who escaped from the he ights had <pb n="480"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[45-47"/> <lb/>
            reached the plain, though many of them, especially such as <lb/>
            belonged to the former armament, through their greater ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance with the localities escaped safely to the camp, some <lb/>
            of those who had lately arrived lost their way, and wandered <lb/>
            about the country; and these, when it was day, the Syracusan <lb/>
            horse intercepted, and put to the sword.</p>
          <p>45. The next day the Syracusans erected two trophies, one <lb/>
            on Epipolæ, where the enemy's approaches had been made, and <lb/>
            the other on the spot where the Bœotians first withstood them; <lb/>
            while the Athenians recovered their dead under truce. No <lb/>
            few were killed, both of themselves and their allies, though <lb/>
            still more arms were taken than in proportion to the number <lb/>
            of the dead : for of those who were compelled to leap down the <lb/>
            cliffs unencumbered by their shields, though some perished, <lb/>
            yet others escaped with their lives.</p>
          <p>46. After this, the Syracusans being again, as before, re­ <lb/>
            stored to confidence on the strength of such unexpected good <lb/>
            fortune, despatched Sicanus with fifteen ships to Acragas, <lb/>
            which was torn by factions, to induce the city to join them, if <lb/>
            he could: while Gylippus again went by land to the other <lb/>
            parts of Sicily to bring more forces, being in hope of even <lb/>
            taking the Athenian lines by storm, since the affair on Epipolæ <lb/>
            had turned out as it did.</p>
          <p>47. The Athenian commanders, in the mean time, consulted <lb/>
            on the disaster which had befallen them, and on the want of <lb/>
            vigour which at present on all accounts prevailed in their <lb/>
            camp; seeing that they were both unsuccessful in their at­ <lb/>
            tempts, and that the soldiers were annoyed by their stay in the <lb/>
            country. For they were suffering with sickness from two dif­ <lb/>
            ferent causes, both because this was the season of the year at <lb/>
            which men are most liable to disease, and at the same time, <lb/>
            too, because the position in which they were encamped was <lb/>
            marshy and unfavourable ; while they were also distressed be­ <lb/>
            cause every thing else appeared hopeless to them. Demosthenes, <lb/>
            hen, was of opinion that they ought not to stay any longer; <lb/>
            but, according to the plan with which he had hazarded the attack <lb/>
            on Epipolæ, since that had failed, he gave his vote for departing, <lb/>
            and not wasting the time, while the sea might yet be crossed, <lb/>
            and while, as regarded forces, they might command the supe­ <lb/>
            riority with the squadron that had lately joined them, at any <lb/>
            rate. He said, too, that it would be more beneficial to the <pb n="481"/>
            <note type="margin"> 48.] <lb/>
            </note>state to carry on the war against those who were building <lb/>
            fortresses for their annoyance in their own country, than <lb/>
            against the Syracusans, whom it was no longer easy to sub­ <lb/>
            due: nor. again, was it right for them to waste large sums of <lb/>
            money to no purpose by continuing the siege. Such, then, <lb/>
            was the view entertained by Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>48. Nicias, however, though he too considered their cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances to be bad, yet did not wish to display their weak. <lb/>
            ness by words, nor that they should become a laughing-stock <lb/>
            to their enemies by voting for the retreat openly, and in 1 con­ <lb/>
            junction with many; for so they would far less elude their <lb/>
            observation in executing it, whenever they might wish. To a <lb/>
            certain extent also the affairs of the enemy, judging from <lb/>
            what he, more than others, knew of them, still afforded some <lb/>
            hope that they would be worse than their own, should they <lb/>
            persist in carrying on the siege ; for so they would exhaust <lb/>
            them by want of funds ; especially, too, as they had now, with <lb/>
            their present fleet, a more extensive command of the sea. A <lb/>
            party in Syracuse also, which wished to surrender the city to <lb/>
            the Athenians, was sending messengers to him, and urging <lb/>
            him not to raise the siege. Knowing these things, then, he <lb/>
            was in fact waiting because he was still inclined both ways, and <lb/>
            wished to see his course more clearly; but in the speech <lb/>
            openly made by him on that occasion he said, " that he re­ <lb/>
            fused to withdraw the forces ; for he well knew that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians would not put up with such a step on the part of the <lb/>
            generals—their returning, he meant, without a vote from them­ <lb/>
            selves to authorize it. Besides, those who would vote in <lb/>
            their case, would not give their verdict from seeing the facts, <lb/>
            as they themselves had done, instead of hearing them from the <lb/>
            invectives of others; but whatever calumnies any clever <lb/>
            speaker threw upon them, by those would they be persuaded. <lb/>
            Many too, nay, even the greater part of the soldiers present on <lb/>
            the spot, who were now clamouring about their perilous condi­ <lb/>
            tion, would, he said, on arriving there, raise the very contrary <lb/>
            clamour, namely, that their generals had utterly betrayed them <lb/>
            for money, when they returned. For himself, then, he did not <lb/>
            wish (knowing as he did the Athenian character and temper) <lb/>
            to die under a dishonourable charge and by an unjust sentence <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετἀ πολλω̃ν</foreign>] i. e. with the Taxiarchs and Trierarehs, who attended <lb/>
            when a regular council of war was held. Compare ch. 50. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a </note> <pb n="482"/>
            <note type="margin"> f49 </note> <lb/>
            at the hands of the Athenians, rather than run the risk, in his <lb/>
            own individual case, of meeting his fate at the hands of the <lb/>
            enemy, if it must be so. As for the affairs of the Syracusans, <lb/>
            however, he knew that they were in a still worse condition than <lb/>
            their own. For supporting mercenaries as they had to do with <lb/>
            their funds, and at the same time spending them on guard­ <lb/>
            posts, and maintaining, moreover, a large navy, as they had <lb/>
            now done for more than a year, they were in some respects ill <lb/>
            provided, and in others would be still more at a loss, as they <lb/>
            had already expended two hundred talents, and still owed <lb/>
            many more ; and should they lose any part whatever of their <lb/>
            present forces through not giving them supplies, their cause <lb/>
            would be ruined, as it was supported by voluntary aid, rather <lb/>
            than by compulsory exertions, like theirs. He maintained, <lb/>
            therefore, that they must continue to carry on the siege, and <lb/>
            not go away defeated in point of money, wherein they were <lb/>
            decidedly superior."</p>
          <p>49. Such were the views which Nicias was positive in <lb/>
            stating, from having gained an accurate acquaintance with the <lb/>
            state of affairs in Syracuse, and their want of money ; and be­ <lb/>
            cause there were some who were desirous that the state should <lb/>
            fall into the hands of the Athenians, and were sending mes­ <lb/>
            sages to him not to abandon the siege; and at the same time, <lb/>
            I because he was influenced by confidence in his fleet, at any <lb/>
            rate more than before. Demosthenes, however, would not at <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαρσήσει κρατηθεις</foreign>] I have given what appears to me the only sense <lb/>
            that this participle can bear, though different from any that has been attri­ <lb/>
            buted to it by others. Compare the somewhat similar use of the verb <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠσσω̃αι</foreign> in the sense of " yielding," or " giving way to," e. g. III. 38. 5, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠδονη̃ ἡσσώμενοι</foreign> and with a genitive, IV. 37. 1, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡσσηθει̃ν</foreign> TOO <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρόντος <lb/>
            δεινον̃</foreign> If, however, it should be thought that neither this meaning, " nor" <lb/>
            (to use the words of Arnold) " any other, can be fairly extracted from the <lb/>
            text as it now stands," I should be disposed to adopt a rather bolder emend­ <lb/>
            atio, than the mere substitution of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρατυνθείς</foreign> which Bauer and so many <lb/>
            others after him have admitted, but which, as Poppo observes, leaves the pas­ <lb/>
            sage scarcely less strange in its phraseology than before. From the fact that <lb/>
            six MSS. have y' <foreign xml:lang="grc">αν</foreign>, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γου̃ν</foreign> it seems probable that an infinitive <lb/>
            mood originally formed part of the sentence; and I venture therefore to pro­ <lb/>
            pose the following correction: Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂμαται̃ςγου̃ν</foreign> (or y<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἇν</foreign>, whichever may <lb/>
            be preferred) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡπρότερον θαρσσςκρατήσειν</foreign> taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρστήσειν</foreign> in <lb/>
            the same absolute sense as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρατει̃ν</foreign> has already borne in a very similar pas­ <lb/>
            sage, ch. 47. 3. If the objections urged by Göller against understanding <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̃λ­ <lb/>
            ον</foreign> before A be thought valid, his correction <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ</foreign>may be admitted; " from feel­ <lb/>
            ing confident that they should at any rate have the advantage at sea, as they <lb/>
            flail formerly;" i. e. before their recent defeat in the naval engagement. </note> <pb n="483"/>
            <note type="margin"> 50] </note> <lb/>
            all listen to the proposal for continuing the siege; but if it <lb/>
            were necessary for them not to withdraw the forces without a <lb/>
            decree from the Athenians, but to remain in the country, he <lb/>
            said that they should either remove to Thapsus and do so, or <lb/>
            to Catana, where they could overrun with their troops a large <lb/>
            part of the country, and support themselves by ravaging <lb/>
            their enemies' property, and so might injure them; while at <lb/>
            the same time with their fleet they would fight their battles <lb/>
            on the open deep, and not in a confined space, which was <lb/>
            more in favour of the enemy, but rather with spacious sea- <lb/>
            room, where their skill would be of service to them, and they <lb/>
            would have an opportunity of retreating and advancing in no <lb/>
            narrow and circumscribed space, both on putting out and <lb/>
            coming to land. In a word, he did not, he said, at all ap­ <lb/>
            prove of remaining in their present position, but of removing <lb/>
            immediately without delay. Eurymedon also supported him <lb/>
            in this view. But as Nicias objected to it, a degree of diffi­ <lb/>
            dence and hesitation was produced in them, and a suspicion <lb/>
            also that Nicias might be so positive from knowing something <lb/>
            more than he expressed. The Athenians, then, in this way <lb/>
            lingered on, and remained where they were.</p>
          <p>50. In the mean time, Gylippusand Sicanus had come to Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse; and though Sicanus had failed in winning Acragas, (for <lb/>
            while he was still at Gela, the party I friendly to the Syracusans <lb/>
            had been driven out;) yet Gylippus came with fresh troops <lb/>
            raised from the rest of Sicily, and with the heavy-armed which <lb/>
            had been sent out from the Peloponnese in the spring, on board <lb/>
            the merchantmen, and had arrived at Selinus from Libya. For <lb/>
            when they had been carried by a tempest to Libya, and the Cy­ <lb/>
            renæans had given them two triremes, and pilots for their voy­ <lb/>
            age, during their passage along shore they entered into alliance <lb/>
            with the Euesperitæ, who were being besieged by the Libyans, <lb/>
            and defeated the latter people ; and after coasting along thence <lb/>
            to Neapolis, an emporium of the Carthaginians, from which the <lb/>
            distance is shortest to Sicily, namely, a voyage of two days and a <lb/>
            night, they crossed over there from that place, and arrived at <lb/>
            Selinus. Immediately on their arrival, the Syracusans pre­ <lb/>
            pared to attack the Athenians again on both sides, by sea and <lb/>
            by land. When the Athenian generals, on the other hand, <note type="footnote"> Literally, "the party for the Syracusans, for friendship with them," u <lb/>
            Art.aid renders it. See his note. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I 2 </note> <pb n="484"/>
            <note type="margin"> [51,62 </note> <lb/>
            saw that a fresh force had joined them, and that their own <lb/>
            circumstances at the same time were not improving, but were <lb/>
            daily becoming worse, and most especially were depressed <lb/>
            through the sickness of the men, they repented of not having <lb/>
            removed before. And as even Nicias did not now oppose <lb/>
            them in the same degree, except by begging them not openly <lb/>
            to vote on the question, they gave orders, as secretly as they <lb/>
            could, for all to sail out of their station, and to be ready when <lb/>
            the signal should be given. And when, after all was in <lb/>
            readiness, they were on the point of sailing away, the moon <lb/>
            was eclipsed; for it happened to be at the full. The greater <lb/>
            part therefore of the Athenians urged the generals to stop, <lb/>
            regarding the matter with religious scruple; and Nicias (for <lb/>
            he was somewhat over addicted to superstition, and such feel­ <lb/>
            ings,) declared that he would not now so much as consider the <lb/>
            matter, with a view to moving, until, as the soothsayers di­ <lb/>
            rected, he had waited thrice nine days. And so the Athenians, <lb/>
            having been stopped on this account, remained in the country.</p>
          <p>51. When the Syracusans, too, heard this, they were much <lb/>
            more stimulated not to relax in their efforts against the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, since they themselves had now confessed that they were <lb/>
            no longer their superiors, either by sea or by land, (for they <lb/>
            would not else have meditated sailing away ;) and at the same <lb/>
            time, because they did not wish them to go and settle in any <lb/>
            other part of Sicily, and so to be more difficult to make war <lb/>
            upon ; but were desirous of forcing them to a sea-fight there, <lb/>
            as quickly as possible, in a position that was advantageous to <lb/>
            themselves. They manned their ships therefore, and prac­ <lb/>
            tised as many days as they thought sufficient. And when a <lb/>
            favourable opportunity presented itself, on the first day they <lb/>
            assaulted the Athenian lines ; and a small division of their <lb/>
            heavy-armed and horse having sallied forth against them <lb/>
            through certain gateways, they intercepted some of the heavy- <lb/>
            armed, and routed and pursued them back; and as the en­ <lb/>
            trance was narrow, the Athenians lost seventy horses, and <lb/>
            some few heavy-armed.</p>
          <p>52. On that day, then, the army of the Syracusans drew <lb/>
            off; but on the next they both sailed out with their ships, <lb/>
            seventy-six in number, and at the same time advanced with <lb/>
            their troops against the walls. The Athenians put out to meet <lb/>
            them with eighty-six ships, and closed and fought with them. <pb n="485"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="53-55. )"/> <lb/>
            Now when Eurymedon, who commanded the right wing of <lb/>
            the Athenians, and wished to surround the ships of the enemy, <lb/>
            had sailed out from the line too much towards the shore ; the <lb/>
            Syracusans and their allies, after first defeating the centre of <lb/>
            the Athenians, intercepted him also in the bottom and furthest <lb/>
            recess of the harbour, and both killed him, and destroyed the <lb/>
            ships that were following him. After which the Syracusans <lb/>
            closely pursued all the ships of the Athenians, and drove <lb/>
            them ashore.</p>
          <p>53. When Gylippus saw the enemy's ships defeated, and <lb/>
            carried beyond the stockades and their own station, wishing to <lb/>
            cut off the men that were landing from them, and that the <lb/>
            Syracusans might more easily tow off the vessels, through the <lb/>
            land being in possession of their friends, he ran down to meet <lb/>
            them at the break-water with some part of his army. The <lb/>
            Tyrrhenians (for it was they who were keeping guard at this <lb/>
            point) seeing them coming on in disorder, advanced towards <lb/>
            them, and fell upon and routed their van, and drove them into <lb/>
            what was called the marsh of Lysimelea. Afterwards, when <lb/>
            the force of the Syracusans and their allies had now come up <lb/>
            in greater numbers, the Athenians also advanced against <lb/>
            them, being afraid for their ships, and entered into action with <lb/>
            them, and defeated and pursued them to some distance, killing <lb/>
            a few heavy-armed. They saved also the greater part of <lb/>
            their own ships, and brought them together alongside their <lb/>
            station ; eighteen of them, however, the Syracusans and their <lb/>
            allies captured, and put all the men to the sword. Wishing <lb/>
            also to burn the rest of them, they filled an old merchantman <lb/>
            with faggots and pine-wood, and having thrown fire into it, <lb/>
            and the wind blowing right on the Athenians, they let the <lb/>
            vessel drift towards them. The Athenians, alarmed for their <lb/>
            ships, contrived, on the other hand, means for checking and <lb/>
            extinguishing it; and having stopped the flames and the near <lb/>
            approach of the merchantman, they thus escaped the danger.</p>
          <p>54. After this, the Syracusans erected a trophy, both for <lb/>
            their sea-fight, and for the interception of the heavy-armed <lb/>
            above, at the wall, where they als took the horses ; while the <lb/>
            Athenians did the same for the rout of those of the infantry <lb/>
            whom the Tyrrhenians drove into the marsh, and for that <lb/>
            which they themselves effected with the rest of their army.</p>
          <p>55. When the victory had now been so decisive on the side <pb n="486"/>
             <note type="margin">[66. </note> <lb/>
            of the Syracusans, even at sea, (for before thi? they were <lb/>
            afraid of the ships newly come with Demosthenes,) the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians were in a state of utter despondency; and great was <lb/>
            their disappointment, but far greater still their regret, for <lb/>
            having made the expedition. For these were the only states <lb/>
            they had hitherto attacked with institutions similar to their <lb/>
            own, and living under a democracy like themselves ; possess­ <lb/>
            ing, too, ships, and horses, and greatness : and as they were <lb/>
            not able either to introduce any change, as regarded their <lb/>
            government, to create dissension among them, by which they <lb/>
            might have been brought over, nor to effect that by means of <lb/>
            their forces, (though 1 they were far superior,) but had failed <lb/>
            in most of their attempts, they were even before this event in <lb/>
            perplexity ; and after they were defeated even at sea, which <lb/>
            they could never have expected, they were far more so still.</p>
          <p>56. The Syracusans, on the other hand, immediately began <lb/>
            to sail without fear along the harbour, and determined to close <lb/>
            up its mouth, that the Athenians might not in future sail out, <lb/>
            even if they wished it, unobserved by them. For they were <lb/>
            no longer attending to their own preservation merely, but also <lb/>
            to the prevention of the enemy's escape ; thinking (as was the <lb/>
            fact) that with their present resources their own cause was <lb/>
            decidedly the stronger; and that if they could conquer the <lb/>
            Athenians and their allies both by land and sea, the victory <lb/>
            would appear a glorious one for them in the eyes of the Greeks. <lb/>
            For of the rest of the Greeks some in that case were straight­ <lb/>
            way liberated, and others released from fear, (as the remaining <lb/>
            power of the Athenians would no longer be able to bear the <lb/>
            war that would afterwards be waged against them;) while <lb/>
            they themselves also, being regarded as the authors of this, <lb/>
            would be greatly admired, both by the rest of the world, and <lb/>
            by posterity. And the contest was indeed worth encountering, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεισσους</foreign>.] I have taken this as a nominative case, with Arnold and <lb/>
            others, rather than as an accusative, as Poppo is inclined to do in his larger <lb/>
            edition; because the superiority of the Athenian forces at the beginning of <lb/>
            their operations is quite evident from many other passages, even besides those <lb/>
            referred to in Arnold's note; and the use of the participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπελθόντες</foreign> at the <lb/>
            beginning of the section is more suitable to the commencement of the siege, <lb/>
            than to the later period of it, when the Syracusans could with truth be said <lb/>
            to be superior to their assailants. Besides, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂντες</foreign> is found after <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρείσσους</foreign> in <lb/>

            </note>both on these grounds, and because they were winning the <lb/>
            victory, not only over the Athenians, but over the other <lb/>
            numerous allies also ; and, again, not winning it by themselves, <lb/>
            but also in company with those who had joined in assisting <lb/>
            them; having taken the lead, too, with the Corinthians and <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, and given their own city to stand the first <lb/>
            brunt of the danger, and paved the way, in great measure, for <lb/>
            their naval success. For the greatest number of nations met <lb/>
            together at this single city, excepting the whole sum of the <lb/>
            confederates assembled, during the war, at the city of Athens <lb/>
            or of Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>57. For the following were the states on each side that re­ <lb/>
            paired to Syracuse for the war, coming against Sicily, or in its <lb/>
            behalf, to assist the one side in winning, and the other in <lb/>
            keeping possession of the country; taking their stand with <lb/>
            one another, not so much on the ground of right, or of kindred, <lb/>
            but as they were each circumstanced with respect either to <lb/>
            expediency or to necessity. The Athenians themselves went <lb/>
            willingly, as Ionians against the Dorians of Syracuse; and <lb/>
            with them went, as their colonists, having the same language <lb/>
            and institutions as themselves, the Lemnians, Imbrians, and <lb/>
            JEginetans, who I then occupied Ægina ; as also the Hestiæans, <lb/>
            who inhabited Hestiæa, in Bœotia. Of the rest, some were <lb/>
            serving with them as subjects ; others in consequence of their <lb/>
            alliance, although independent; and others as mercenaries. <lb/>
            Amongst their subjects and tributaries were the Eretrians, <lb/>
            Chalcidians, Styrians, and Carystians, of Euboea. From the <lb/>
            islands were the Ceans, Andrians, and Tenians: from Ionia, <lb/>
            the Milesians, Samnians, and Chians. Of these, the Chians <lb/>
            joined as independent allies, not being subject to tribute, but <lb/>
            supplying ships. All these were chiefly Ionians, and de­ <lb/>
            scended from the Athenians, except the Carystians, who were <lb/>
            Dryopes ; and though subject, and going from necessity, 2 still <lb/>
            they followed at any rate as Ionians against Dorians. Besides <lb/>
            these, there were of Æolic race, the Methymnæans, subject to <lb/>
            supplying ships but not tribute ; and the Tenedians and Æni­ <lb/>
            ans, who were tributaries. These, although Æolians, were by <note type="footnote"> I Implying that the present were not the original inhabitants of it. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΙωνέςἑπίΔωριέας</foreign> "That is, it was not unnatural or irksome to <lb/>

            compulsion fighting against JEolians, namely, tLa Bœotians, <lb/>
            their founders, who were on the Syracusan side. But the <lb/>
            Platæans alone fought as Bœotians 1 right in the face of Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians, as might have been expected, for the hatred they bore <lb/>
            them. Of Rhodians and Cytherians, again, both of Doric race, <lb/>
            the Cytherians, though colonists of the Lacedaemonians, were <lb/>
            fighting in concert with the Athenians against the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians with Gylippus; while the Rhodians, who were Ar­ <lb/>
            gives by race, were compelled to wage war against the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, who were Dorians, and the Geloans, who were even <lb/>
            their own colonists, serving with the Syracusans. Of the <lb/>
            islanders around the Peloponnese, the Cephallenians and Za­ <lb/>
            cynthians followed, indeed, as independent allies, but still, on <lb/>
            account of their insular position, rather by constraint, because <lb/>
            the Athenians commanded the sea. The Corcyræans, though <lb/>
            not only Dorians but even Corinthians, followed openly against <lb/>
            the Corinthians and Syracusans, though colonists of the one <lb/>
            and kinsmen of the other; by compulsion, according to their <lb/>
            specious profession, but rather with good will, for the hatred <lb/>
            they bore the Corinthians. The Messenians, too, as they are <lb/>
            now called, at Naupactus, and also from Pylus, which was then <lb/>
            held by the Athenians, were taken to the war. Moreover, <lb/>
            some few Megarean exiles, owing to their misfortune, were <lb/>
            fighting against the Selinuntines, who were Megareans. Of <lb/>
            the rest the service was now more of a voluntary nature. <lb/>
            For it was not so much on account of their alliance, as out of <lb/>
            hatred for the Lacedæmonians, and for their own individual <lb/>
            advantage at the moment, that the Argives followed in com­ <lb/>
            pany of the Ionian Athenians to fight as Dorians against Do­ <lb/>
            rians. While the Mantineans, and other mercenaries from <lb/>
            Arcadia, went as being accustomed to go against the enemies <lb/>
            who at any time were pointed out to them ; and thought, for <lb/>
            the sake of gain, that the Arcadians, who at that time came <lb/>
            with the Corinthians, were no less than others their foes. <lb/>
            The Cretans and JEtolians also came for consideration of pay; <lb/>
            and it happened in the case of the Cretans, that although they <lb/>
            had joined the Rhodians in founding Gela, they now came, not <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταντικρύ</foreign>] Such is perhaps the force of the word, in the absence of <lb/>
            any instance in which Thucydides uses it for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃντικρυς</foreign> Otherwise the <lb/>
            meaning of " absolute " or " downright Bœotians," would suit the passage <lb/>
            much better, as distinguishing between the Platæans who actually lived m <lb/>
            the country, and those before mentioned who were only colonies from it. </note> <pb n="489"/>
            <note type="margin"> 68 </note> <lb/>
            with their colonists, but against them-not by choice, but for <lb/>
            pay. There were also some Acarnanians who served as aux­ <lb/>
            iliaries, partly from motives of interest, but mainly as being <lb/>
            allies, through their friendship with Demosthenes, and their <lb/>
            good-will towards the Athenians. These, then, 1 were within <lb/>
            the boundary of the Ionian gulf. Of the Italiots, on the other <lb/>
            hand, the Thurians and Metapontines, as they had been over­ <lb/>
            taken by such necessities at that time, owing to those seasons <lb/>
            of faction, joined in the expedition; and of the Siceliots, the <lb/>
            Naxians and Catanians. Of barbarians, there were the Seges­ <lb/>
            tans, who indeed invited them to their aid, with the greater <lb/>
            part of the Sicels; and of those out of Sicily, some of the <lb/>
            Tyrrhenians, on account of a quarrel with the Syracusans, <lb/>
            and some Iapygian mercenaries. Such and so many were the <lb/>
            nations that were serving with the Athenians.</p>
          <p>58. To the aid of the Syracusans, on the other hand, came <lb/>
            the Camarinaeans, who lived on their borders ; the Geloans, <lb/>
            who lived next to them ; and then (for the Acragantines were <lb/>
            neutral) the Selinuntines, who were situated on the farther <lb/>
            side of the island. These occupied the part of Sicily opposite <lb/>
            to Libya, but the Himeræans the side towards the Tyrrhenian <lb/>
            sea, in which they are the only Greek inhabitants, and from <lb/>
            which they were the only auxiliaries of the Syracusans. Such <lb/>
            then were the Grecian communities in Sicily that joined in the <lb/>
            war, being all Dorians and independent. Of the barbarians, <lb/>
            there were the Sicels alone, such of them as had not gone over <lb/>
            to the Athenians. Of the Greeks beyond the limits of Sicily, <lb/>
            there were the Lacedæmonians, who supplied a Spartan leader, <lb/>
            while the rest of the troops were Neodamodes and Helots ; (the <lb/>
            term Neodamode being now equivalent to free;) the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians, who alone of all the allies joined with both sea and land <lb/>
            forces; the Leucadians, also, and Ambraciots, for the sake of <lb/>
            their connexion with them ; while mercenaries were sent from <lb/>
            Arcadia by the Corinthians, and some Sicyonians, who were <lb/>
            pressed into the service. From beyond the Peloponnese, <lb/>
            some Bœotians joined them. Compared, however, with these <lb/>
            who came as auxiliaries, the Siceliots themselves supplied <lb/>
            larger numbers in every branch of the service, inasmuch as <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῳ̃'Ιονίωκόλπῳὀριζόμενοιι</foreign>. e. who were separated by that sea from <lb/>

              they were powerful states; for numerous heavy-armed, <lb/>
              ships, and horses, and an abundant 1 crowd besides, were <lb/>
              collected by them. And compared, again, with all the rest <lb/>
              put together, as one may say, the Syracusans by themselves <lb/>
              furnished morsnumerous levies, both from the greatness of <lb/>
              their city, and because they were in the greatest peril.</p>
          <p>59., Such were the auxiliaries collected on either side, <lb/>
            which, by this time, had all joined both parties, and there <lb/>
            were no subsequent additions to either.</p>
          <p>The Syracusans and their allies, then, reasonably conceived <lb/>
            that it would be a glorious prize for them, after their recent <lb/>
            victory in the sea-fight, to capture the whole armament of the <lb/>
            Athenians, great as it was, and not to let them escape either <lb/>
            way, neither by sea nor land. They began therefore imme­ <lb/>
            diately to close up the great harbour, the mouth of which was <lb/>
            about eight stades across, with triremes ranged broadside, and <lb/>
            merchant-vessels, and boats, mooring them with anchors ; while <lb/>
            they prepared every thing else, in case the Athenians should <lb/>
            still have courage for a sea-fight, and entertained no small de­ <lb/>
            signs with regard to any thing.</p>
          <p>60. The Athenians, seeing them closing up the harbour, and <lb/>
            having received intelligence of their other plans, thought it <lb/>
            necessary to hold a council. Accordingly the generals and the <lb/>
            Taxiarchs assembled to deliberate on their difficulties, arising <lb/>
            both from other causes, and especially because they had nei­ <lb/>
            ther any more provisions for their immediate use, (for, thinking <lb/>
            that they were going to sail away, they had sent before to <lb/>
            Catana, and commanded them to bring them no longer,) nor <lb/>
            were likely to have them in future, unless they should gain <lb/>
            the command of the sea. They determined therefore to <lb/>
            evacuate the upper part of their lines, and having enclosed <lb/>
            with a cross wall just by the ships the least space that could <lb/>
            be sufficient to hold their stores and their sick, to garrison <lb/>
            that, while with the rest of their troops, making every one go <lb/>
            on board, they manned all their ships, both such as were <lb/>
            sound and such as were less fit for service; and after a naval <lb/>
            engagement, if they were victorious, to proceed to Catana; <lb/>
            but if not, to burn their ships; throw themselves into line. and <lb/>
            retreat by land, in whatever direction they would soonest <lb/>
            reach some friendly town, whether barbarian or Grecian. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅμιλος</foreign>,]i. e. of light-armed irregulars. </note> <pb n="491"/>

            They, then, having resolved on these things, acted accordingly; <lb/>
            for they gradually descended from their upper lines, and <lb/>
            manned all their ships, having compelled to go on board who­ <lb/>
            ever, even in any degree, seemed of age for rendering service. <lb/>
            Thus there were manned in all about a hundred and ten ships ; <lb/>
            on board which they embarked a large number of bow-men and <lb/>
            dart-men, taken from the Acarnanian and other mercenaries, <lb/>
            and provided every thing else, as far as it was possible for them, <lb/>
            when acting upon a plan which necessity alone dictated, such <lb/>
            as the present. When most things were in readiness, Nicias, <lb/>
            seeing the soldiers disheartened by their decided defeat at sea, <lb/>
            and wishing, in consequence of the scarcity of provisions, to <lb/>
            hazard a final battle as speedily as possible, assembled them, <lb/>
            and on that I occasion addressed them all together first, and <lb/>
            spoke as follows:</p>
          <p>61. " Soldiers of the Athenians, and of the other allies, the <lb/>
            coming struggle will be common alike to all-for the safety <lb/>
            and country of each of us, no less than of the enemy ; since if <lb/>
            we now gain a victory with our fleet, each one may see his <lb/>
            native city again, wherever it may be. Nor should you be <lb/>
            disheartened, or feel like the most inexperienced of men, who, <lb/>
            after failing in their first attempts, ever after have the antici­ <lb/>
            pation of their fear taking the colour of their disasters. But <lb/>
            as many of you here as are Athenians, having already had ex­ <lb/>
            perience in many wars, and all the allies who have ever <lb/>
            joined us in our expeditions, remember the unexpected results <lb/>
            that occur in warfare ; and make your preparations with a hope <lb/>
            that fortune may at length side with us, and with a deter­ <lb/>
            mination to renew the conflict in a manner worthy of your <lb/>
            numbers, which you see yourselves to be so great.</p>
          <p>62. " Now whatever we saw likely to be serviceable against <lb/>
            the confined space of the harbour, with reference to the crowd <lb/>
            of ships that there will be, and the enemy's troops upon their <lb/>
            decks, from which we suffered before, every thing has now <lb/>
            been looked to and prepared by us also, as far as present cir- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱεκελεύσατοτότεπϱω̃τον</foreign>.]I have retained the old reading tots, <lb/>

            in my opinion, to make a marked distinction between the speech addressed <lb/>
            by Nicias " on that first occasion," to all the troops together, and that which <lb/>
            he afterwards addressed to the trierarchs by themselves. See ch. 69. 2,<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign><unclear>θι</unclear> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              cumstances would allow, with the co-operation of the masters <lb/>
              of our vessels. For great numbers of bow-men and dart-men <lb/>
              will go on board, and a multitude such as we should not have <lb/>
              used, had we been fighting in the open sea, as it would have <lb/>
              interfered with the display of our skill through the weight of our <lb/>
              ships ; but in the present land-fight which we are compelled <lb/>
              to make on board our ships, these things will be of service. <lb/>
              We have also ascertained the different ways in which we must <lb/>
              adapt the structure of our vessels for opposing theirs, and espe­ <lb/>
              cially, against the stoutness of their cheeks, from which we <lb/>
              received most damage, we have provided grappling irons, <lb/>
              which will prevent the ship's retiring 1 again after it has once <lb/>
              charged, if the soldiers on board then do their duty. For to <lb/>
              this necessity are we reduced, that we must maintain a land- <lb/>
              fight on board our fleet; and it seems to be our interest nei­ <lb/>
              ther to retire ourselves, nor to suffer them to do it; especially <lb/>
              as the shore, except so far as our troops occupy it, is in pos­ <lb/>
              session of the enemy.</p>
          <p>63. " Remembering this, then, you must fight on as long as <lb/>
            you can, and not be driven to land, but determine, when one <lb/>
            ship has closed with another, not to separate before you have <lb/>
            swept off the soldiers from your enemy's deck. And this ex­ <lb/>
            hortation I offer to the soldiers not less than to the sailors, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as this work belongs more to those upon deck. And <lb/>
            we have still even now a general superiority with our troops. <lb/>
            On the other hand, I advise the seamen, and entreat them too <lb/>
            at the same time, not to be too much dismayed by their mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes, as we have now superior resources on our decks, and <lb/>
            a larger number of ships. Consider, too, how well worth pre­ <lb/>
            serving is that pleasure enjoyed by those of you, who, being <lb/>
            hitherto considered as Athenians, even though you are not, <lb/>
            from your knowledge of our language and your imitation of <lb/>
            our customs, were respected through Greece, and enjoyed no <lb/>
            less a share of our empire as regarded the benefits you de­ <lb/>
            rived from it, and a far greater share as regards being feared <lb/>
            by our subjects, and being secured from injuries. Since then <lb/>
            you alone, as free men, share our empire with us, abstain, as <lb/>
            just men, from now utterly betraying it. And with contempt <lb/>

            celiots, none of whom presumed, while our fleet was in fine <lb/>
            condition, so much as to stand up against us, repel them, and <lb/>
            show that, even when attended by weakness and misfortunes, <lb/>
            your skill is superior to the fortunate strength of any others.</p>
          <p>64. " Those of you, again, who are Athenians, I must re­ <lb/>
            mind of this also, that you left behind you no more such ships <lb/>
            in your docks, nor so fine a body of heavy-armed troops; and <lb/>
            that if any thing else befall you but victory, your enemies <lb/>
            here will immediately sail thither, and those of our country­ <lb/>
            men who are left behind there will be unable to defend them­ <lb/>
            selves against both their opponents on the spot and those who <lb/>
            will join them; and thus at the same time you who are here <lb/>
            will be at the mercy of the Syracusans, (and you know with what <lb/>
            feelings you came against them,) and those who are there at <lb/>
            home at that of the Lacedæmonians. Being brought then to <lb/>
            this one struggle for both parties, fight bravely now, if you ever <lb/>
            did ; and reflect, both individually and collectively, that those <lb/>
            of you who will now be on board your ships represent both the <lb/>
            army and the navy of the Athenians, all that is left of your <lb/>
            country, and the great name of Athens: in behalf of which, <lb/>
            whatever be the point in which one man excels another, either <lb/>
            in science or courage, on no other occasion could he better <lb/>
            display it, so as both to benefit himself and to contribute to <lb/>
            the preservation of all."</p>
          <p>65. Nicias delivered this exhortation to them, and immedi­ <lb/>
            ately commanded them to man the ships. Gylippus and the <lb/>
            Syracusans, on the other hand, were able to perceive, from the <lb/>
            sight of their very preparations, that the Athenians were <lb/>
            about to engage them at sea, and the device of throwing the <lb/>
            grappling irons had also been previously reported to them. <lb/>
            They prepared themselves therefore on all other points severally, <lb/>
            and on this also; for they covered over with hides their prows <lb/>
            and a considerable space of the upper part of the vessel, so <lb/>
            that the grapple, when thrown, might slip off, and not obtain <lb/>
            any hold on them. And now, when every thing was ready, <lb/>
            their generals, together with Gylippus, exhorted them by <lb/>
            speaking as follows:</p>
          <p>66. "That our former achievements have been glorious ones, <lb/>
            Syracusans and allies, and that this struggle will be for glo­ <lb/>
            rious results in future, most of you seem to us to be aware, <lb/>
            (for you would not else have devoted yourselves so eagerly to <pb n="494"/>
            <note type="margin"> .67 <lb/>
            </note>it,) and if any one is not as sensible of it as lie ought to be, <lb/>
            we will prove it to him. For when the Athenians had come <lb/>
            to this country, for the subjugation of Sicily in the first place, <lb/>
            and then, if they succeeded, for that of the Peloponnese also, <lb/>
            and the rest of Greece; and when they possessed the largest <lb/>
            empire enjoyed hitherto, either by Greeks of former times or <lb/>
            of the present, you were the first men in the world who with­ <lb/>
            stood their navy, with which they had borne down every <lb/>
            thing, and have already conquered them in some sea-fights, <lb/>
            and will now, in all probability, conquer them in this. For <lb/>
            when men have been put down in that in which they claim to <lb/>
            excel, their opinion of themselves in future is far lower than <lb/>
            if they had never entertained such an idea at first; and failing <lb/>
            through the disappointment of their boasting, they give way <lb/>
            even beyond the degree of their power. And such, probably, <lb/>
            is now the feeling of the Athenians.</p>
          <p>67. "But in our case, both the opinion we entertained be­ <lb/>
            fore, and with which, even while we were yet unskilful, we <lb/>
            were full of daring, has now been confirmed; and from the <lb/>
            addition to it of the thought that we must be the best seamen <lb/>
            in the world, since we have conquered the best, each man's <lb/>
            hope is doubled. And, generally speaking, it is the greatest <lb/>
            hope that supplies also the greatest spirit for undertakings. <lb/>
            Again, those points in which they are imitating our equip­ <lb/>
            ments are familiar to our habits, and we shall not be <lb/>
            1 awkward at each of them: whereas, on their side, when <lb/>
            many soldiers are on their decks contrary to their custom, and <lb/>
            many dart-men, mere 2 land-lubbers, (so to speak,) Acar­ <lb/>
            nanians and others, have gone on board their ships, who will <lb/>
            not so much as know how to discharge their weapons while <lb/>
            stationary, how can they avoid swaying the ships, and falling <lb/>
            all into confusion amongst themselves, by not moving accord­ <lb/>
            ing to their own fashion ? For neither will they derive any <lb/>
            benefit from the superior number of their ships, (if any of you <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάρμοστοι</foreign>,] or, as others take it, " unprepared against each of them." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">χερσαι̃οι</foreign>.]I have ventured to use a rather slang term, because the <lb/>
            qualifying expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡςεἰπει̃ν</foreign>,which is added in the original, seems to im­ <lb/>
            ply that <foreign xml:lang="grc">χεϱσαι̃οι</foreign>was employed by him with a similar meaning of reproach. <lb/>
            The meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφάλλω</foreign>,as used just below, seems borrowed from the un­ <lb/>
            steady reeling motion of an intoxicated person; the simile used by the <lb/>
            Psalmist with reference to mariners tossed in the storm, "they reel to and <lb/>
            fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end." Or it may <lb/>
            mean to " embarrasa.” </note> <pb n="495"/>

            be afraid of this, I mean the idea of his not going to fight them <lb/>
            with an equal number;) for many ships in a small space will <lb/>
            be less effective for executing any of the movements they may <lb/>
            wish, while they are most liable to be injured by our pre­ <lb/>
            parations. On the contrary, be assured of this, which is most <lb/>
            true, according to the certain information which we believe <lb/>
            we have received. It is through the excess of their miseries, <lb/>
            and from being forced to it by their present distress, that they <lb/>
            are induced to make a desperate effort; not so much from <lb/>
            confidence in their resources, as from hazarding a chance, in <lb/>
            whatever way they can, that they may either force their pas­ <lb/>
            sage and sail out, or afterwards retreat by land; since, at any <lb/>
            rate, they could not fare worse than at present.</p>
          <p>68. " To avail yourselves then of such confusion, and of the <lb/>
            very fortune of our bitterest enemies, which has betrayed itself, <lb/>
            let us close with them in wrath, and consider that the feeling <lb/>
            of those men is most lawful, with regard to their enemies, who <lb/>
            determine, when taking vengeance on their aggressor, to glut <lb/>
            the animosity of their heart: and that we too shall have an <lb/>
            opportunity of avenging ourselves on our foes-the very thing <lb/>
            which is every where said to be most sweet. For that they are <lb/>
            our foes, and our bitterest foes, you all know; inasmuch as <lb/>
            they came against our country to enslave it, and if they had <lb/>
            succeeded, would have imposed on our men all that was most <lb/>
            painful; on our children and wives, all that is most dishonour­ <lb/>
            able ; and on our whole country, the title which is most de­ <lb/>
            grading. Wherefore no one ought to relent, or deem it gain <lb/>
            that they should merely go away without danger to us. For <lb/>
            that they will do just the same, even if they gain the victory. <lb/>
            But that, through our succeeding (as we probably shall do) in <lb/>
            our wishes, these men should be punished, and should leave a <lb/>
            more secure liberty for the whole of Sicily, which even before <lb/>
            enjoyed that blessing ; this is a glorious object to contend for. <lb/>
            And of all hazards those are most rare, which, while they cause <lb/>
            least harm by failure, confer most advantage by success."</p>
          <p>69. The Syracusan commanders and Gylippus having in <lb/>
            their turn thus exhorted their men, immediately manned the <lb/>
            ships on their side also, since they saw that the Athenians <lb/>
            were doing it. Nicias, on the other hand, being dismayed at <lb/>
            the present circumstances of himself and his colleagues: and <lb/>
            seeing how gr at and how close at hand now their peril was, <pb n="496"/>
             <note type="margin">[69. </note> <lb/>
            since they were all but on the point of putting out, consider­ <lb/>
            in,,, too, (as men usually feel in great emergencies,) that in deed <lb/>
            every thing fell short of what they would have it, while in <lb/>
            word enough had not yet been said by them ; again called to <lb/>
            him each one of the Trierarchs, addressing them severally by <lb/>
            their father's name, their own, and that of their tribe; beg­ <lb/>
            ging each one who enjoyed any previous distinction, from <lb/>
            personal considerations not to sacrifice it, nor to obscure those <lb/>
            hereditary virtues for which his forefathers were illustrious; <lb/>
            reminding them too of their country-the most free one in <lb/>
            the world-and the power, subject to no man's dictation, which <lb/>
            all enjoyed in it with regard to their mode of life ; mentioning <lb/>
            other things also, such as men would say at a time now so <lb/>
            critical, not guarding against being thought by any one to <lb/>
            bring forward old and hackneyed topics, and such as are ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in all cases alike, about men's wives and children and <lb/>
            country's gods, but loudly appealing to them, because they <lb/>
            think they may be of service in the present consternation. <lb/>
            Thus he, thinking that he had addressed to them an exhorta­ <lb/>
            tion which was not so much a satisfactory one, as one that he <lb/>
            was compelled to be content with, went away from them, and <lb/>
            led the troops down to the beach, and ranged them over as <lb/>
            large a space as he could, that the greatest possible assistance <lb/>
            might be given to those on board towards keeping up their <lb/>
            spirits. Demosthenes, Menander, and Euthydemus, who went <lb/>
            on board the Athenian fleet to take the command, put out <lb/>
            from their own station, and immediately sailed to the bar at <lb/>
            the mouth of the harbour, and the passage through it which <lb/>
            had been 1closed up, wishing to force their way to the <lb/>
            outside. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν</foreign>†<foreign xml:lang="grc">παραλειφθέντα</foreign>†<foreign xml:lang="grc">διέκπλουν</foreign>.] As some correction of this reading <lb/>
            seems necessary, I have preferred that which is adopted by Arnold, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατα­ <lb/>
            ληφθέντα</foreign>,to that which Bekker proposes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιλειφέντα</foreign>:because it seems <lb/>
            far more probable from the next chapter that no passage at all was left by <lb/>
            the Syracusans. If there had been, why should the Athenians, when they <lb/>
            had defeated the squadron at the harbour's mouth, have attempted to break <lb/>
            the fastenings of the vessels which formed the bar, (sec. 2,) instead of sailing <lb/>
            out at once, as some of them probably would have done, under their present <lb/>
            circumstances, if the passage had beenopen for them. Bloomfield indeed <lb/>
            thinks that the mere fact of a Syracusan squadron having been posted neat <lb/>
            the mouth of the harbour proves that there must have been an opening left. <lb/>
            But surely this is a very weak proof: for knowing as they did that the <lb/>
            Athenians would break down the bar if they possibly could, it was a very <lb/>
            natural precaution to defend it with a division of their fleet. </note> <pb n="497"/>
            </p>
          <p>70. The Syracusans and their allies, having previously put <lb/>
            out with pretty nearly the same number of ships as before, <lb/>
            proceeded to keep guard with part of them at the passage out, <lb/>
            and also round the circumference of the whole harbour, that <lb/>
            they might fall upon the Athenians on all sides at once, while <lb/>
            their troops also at the same time came to their aid at what­ <lb/>
            ever part their vessels might put in to shore. The commanders <lb/>
            of the Syracusan fleet were Sicanus and Agatharchus, each <lb/>
            occupying a wing of the whole force, with Pythen and the <lb/>
            Corinthians in the centre. When the Athenians came up to <lb/>
            the bar, in the first rush with which they charged they got the <lb/>
            better of the ships posted at it, and endeavoured to break the <lb/>
            fastenings. Afterwards, when the Syracusans and their allies <lb/>
            bore down upon them from all quarters, the engagement was <lb/>
            going on no longer at the bar alone, but over the harbour <lb/>
            also ; and an obstinate one it was, such as none of the <lb/>
            previous ones had been. For great eagerness for the attack <lb/>
            was exhibited by the seamen on both sides, when the com­ <lb/>
            mand was given; and there was much counter-manoeuvring <lb/>
            on the part of the masters, and rivalry with each other ; while <lb/>
            the soldiers on board exerted themselves, when vessel came in <lb/>
            collision with vessel, that the operations on deck might not <lb/>
            fall short of the skill shown by others. Indeed every one, <lb/>
            whatever the duty assigned him, made every effort that he <lb/>
            might himself in each case appear the best man. And as a <lb/>
            great number of ships were engaged in a small compass, (for <lb/>
            indeed they were the largest fleets fighting in the narrowest <lb/>
            space that had ever been known, since both of them together <lb/>
            fell little short of two hundred,) the attacks made with the <lb/>
            beaks were few, as there were no means of backing water, or <lb/>
            cutting through the enemy's line; but chance collisions were <lb/>
            more frequent, just as one ship might happen to run into <lb/>
            another, either in flying from or attacking a second. So long <lb/>
            as a vessel was coming up to the charge, those on her decks <lb/>
            plied their javelins, arrows, and stones in abundance against <lb/>
            her; but when they came to close quarters, the heavy- <lb/>
            armed marines, fighting hand to hand, endeavoured to board <lb/>
            each others ships. In many cases too it happened, through <lb/>
            want of room, that on one side they were charging an enemy. <lb/>
            and on the other were being charged themselves, and that <lb/>
            two ships, and sometimes even more, were by compulsion en- <note type="footnote">2 x </note><pb n="498"/>

            tangled round one. And thus the masters had to. guard <lb/>
            against some, and to concert measures against others-not one <lb/>
            thing at a time, but many things on every side-while the <lb/>
            great din from such a number of ships coming into collision <lb/>
            both spread dismay and prevented their hearing what the <lb/>
            boatswains said. For many were the orders given and the shouts <lb/>
            raised by those officers on each side, both in the discharge of <lb/>
            their duty, and from their present eagerness for the battle: <lb/>
            while they cried out to the Athenians, “to force the passage, <lb/>
            and now, if ever they meant to do it hereafter, to exert them­ <lb/>
            selves heartily for a safe return to their country;" and to the <lb/>
            Syracusans and their allies, " that it would be a glorious <lb/>
            achievement for them to prevent the enemy's escape, and by <lb/>
            gaining the victory to confer honour on their respective <lb/>
            countries." The commanders, moreover, on each side, if they <lb/>
            saw any captain in any part unnecessarily rowing astern, <lb/>
            called out on him by name and asked him, on the side of the <lb/>
            Athenians, " whether they were retreating because they con­ <lb/>
            sidered the land, which was in the possession of their bitterest <lb/>
            enemies, as more their own than the sea, which had been won <lb/>
            with no small trouble?" on that of the Syracusans, "whether <lb/>
            they were themselves flying from the flying Athenians, whom <lb/>
            they knew for certain to be anxious to escape from them in <lb/>
            any way whatever ? "</p>
          <p>71. The troops on shore too, on both sides, when the sea- <lb/>
            fight was so equally balanced, suffered a great agony and con­ <lb/>
            flict of feelings ; those of the country being ambitious now of <lb/>
            still greater honour, while their invaders were afraid of faring <lb/>
            even worse than at present. For, since the Athenians' all was <lb/>
            staked on their fleet, their fear for the future was like none <lb/>
            they had ever felt before ; and from the unequal nature of the <lb/>
            engagement they were also compelled to have an unequal view <lb/>
            of it from the beach. For as the spectacle was near at hand, <lb/>
            and as they did not all look at the same part at once, if any <lb/>
            saw their own men victorious in any quarter, they would be <lb/>
            encouraged, and turn to calling on the gods not to deprive <lb/>
            them of safety ; while those who looked on the part that was <lb/>
            being beaten, uttered lamentations at the same time as cries. <lb/>
            and from the sight they had of what was going on, expressed <lb/>
            their feelings more than those engaged in the action. Others. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> <unclear/>.] <lb/>
            </note>sequence of the indecisive continuance of the conflict, in their <lb/>
            excessive fear made gestures with their very bodies, corre­ <lb/>
            spending with their thoughts, and continued in the most dis. <lb/>
            tressing state, for they were constantly within a little of <lb/>
            escaping, or of being destroyed. And thus amongst the troops <lb/>
            of the Athenians, as long as they were fighting at sea on <lb/>
            equal terms, every sound might be heard at once, wailing, <lb/>
            shouting, " they conquer," " they are conquered," and all the <lb/>
            other various exclamations which a great armament in great <lb/>
            peril would be constrained to utter-very much in the same <lb/>
            way as their men on board their ships were affected-until at <lb/>
            length, after the battle had continued for a long time, the <lb/>
            Syracusans and their allies routed the Athenians, and pressing <lb/>
            on them in a decisive manner, with much shouting and cheer­ <lb/>
            ing of each other on, pursued them to the shore. Then the <lb/>
            sea forces, as many as were not taken afloat, put in to the land <lb/>
            at different parts, and rushed from on board to the camp . <lb/>
            while the army, no longer with any different feelings, but all <lb/>
            on one impulse, lamenting and groaning, deplored the event, <lb/>
            and proceeded, some to succour the ships, others to guard what <lb/>
            remained of their wall; while others, and those the greatest <lb/>
            part, began now to think of themselves, and how they should <lb/>
            best provide for their own preservation. Indeed their dismay at <lb/>
            the moment had been exceeded by none of all they had ever felt. <lb/>
            And they now experienced pretty nearly what they had them­ <lb/>
            selves inflicted at Pylus: for by the Lacedæmonians’losing <lb/>
            their ships, their men who had crossed over into the island <lb/>
            were lost to them besides: and at this time for the Athenians <lb/>
            to escape by land was hopeless, unless something beyond all <lb/>
            expectation should occur.</p>
          <p>72. After the battle had been thus obstinately disputed, and <lb/>
            many ships and men destroyed on both sides, the Syracusans <lb/>
            and allies, having gained the victory, took up their wrecks <lb/>
            and dead, and then sailed away to the city, and erected a <lb/>
            trophy. The Athenians, from the extent of their present <lb/>
            misery, did not so much as think about their dead or their <lb/>
            wrecks, or of asking permission to take them up, but wished <lb/>
            to retreat immediately during the night. Demosthenes, how­ <lb/>
            ever, went to Nicias, and expressed it as his opinion, that they <lb/>
            should still man their remaining ships, and force their passage <lb/>
            out, if they could, in the morning; alleging that they still had <note type="footnote"> 2 K 2 </note> <pb n="500"/>
            <note type="margin"> 73 </note> <lb/>
            left more ships fit for service than the enemy; for the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians had about sixty remaining, while their adversaries had <lb/>
            less than fifty. But when Nicias agreed with this opinion, <lb/>
            and they wished to man them, the seamen would not embark, <lb/>
            through being dismayed at their defeat, and thinking that they <lb/>
            could not now gain a victory. And so they all now made up <lb/>
            their minds to retreat by land.</p>
          <p>73. But Hermocrates the Syracusan, suspecting their pur­ <lb/>
            pose, and thinking that it would be a dreadful thing, if so large a <lb/>
            force, after retreating by land and settling any where in Sicily, <lb/>
            should choose again to carry on the war with them, went to <lb/>
            the authorities, and explained to them that they ought not to <lb/>
            suffer them to retreat during the night, (stating what he 1him­ <lb/>
            self thought,) but that all the Syracusans and allies should at <lb/>
            once go out, and block up the roads, and keep guard before­ <lb/>
            hand at the narrow passes. But though the magistrates also <lb/>
            agreed with him in thinking this, no less than himself, and <lb/>
            were of opinion that it ought to be done, yet they thought that <lb/>
            the people, in their recent joy and relaxation after the labours <lb/>
            of a great sea-fight, especially, too, as it was a time of feasting, <lb/>
            (for they happened to celebrate on this day a sacrifice to Her­ <lb/>
            cules,) would not easily be induced to listen to them; as the <lb/>
            majority, from excessive gladness at their victory, had fallen <lb/>
            to drinking during the festival, and would, they expected, <lb/>
            rather obey them in any thing than in taking arms, just at <lb/>
            present, and marching out. When, on consideration of this, <lb/>
            it appeared a difficulty to the magistrates, and Hermocrates <lb/>
            could not then prevail upon them to attempt it, he afterwards <lb/>
            devised the following scheme. Being afraid that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians might get the start of them by quietly passing during <lb/>
            the night the most difficult points of the country, he sent cer­ <lb/>
            tain of his own friends with some cavalry to the Athenian <lb/>
            camp, as soon as it grew dark. These, riding up to within <lb/>
            hearing, and calling to them certain individuals, as though <lb/>
            they were friends of the Athenians, (for there were some who <lb/>
            sent tidings to Nicias of what passed within the city,) desired <lb/>
            them to tell that general not to lead off his army by night, as <note type="footnote"> 1 a Kal <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτω̖̃ἐδόκει</foreign>.] I see no'reason whatever for any such alteration of <lb/>

            mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, that Hermocrates had himself <lb/>
            suspected (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐπονοήσαςαὐτω̃ντὴνδιάνοιαν</foreign>) what he stated to the magistrates <lb/>

            the Syracusans were guarding the roads; but to retire leisurely <lb/>
            by day after making his preparations. They then, after de­ <lb/>
            livering this message, returned; while those who heard it, re­ <lb/>
            ported the same to the Athenian generals.</p>
          <p>74. They, in accordance with the information, stopped for the <lb/>
            night, considering it to be no false statement. And since they <lb/>
            had not, as it was, set out immediately, they determined to re­ <lb/>
            main over the next day also, that the soldiers might pack up, as <lb/>
            well as they could, the most useful articles; and though they <lb/>
            left every thing else behind, to take with them, when they <lb/>
            started, just what was necessary for their personal support. <lb/>
            But the Syracusans and Gylippus had marched out before <lb/>
            with their troops, and were blocking up the roads through the <lb/>
            country where it was likely the Athenians would advance, as <lb/>
            well as guarding the passages of the streams and rivers, and <lb/>
            posting themselves for the reception of the army, in order to <lb/>
            stop it where they thought best; while with their ships they <lb/>
            sailed to those of the Athenians, and towed them off from the <lb/>
            beach. Some few indeed the Athenians themselves had burnt, <lb/>
            as they had intended ; but the rest they lashed to their own at <lb/>
            their leisure, as each had been thrown up on any part of the <lb/>
            beach, and, without any one trying to stop them, conveyed <lb/>
            them to the city.</p>
          <p>75. After this, when Nicias and Demosthenes thought they <lb/>
            were sufficiently prepared, the removal of the army took <lb/>
            place, on the third day after the sea-fight. It was a wretched <lb/>
            scene then, not on account of the single circumstance alone, that <lb/>
            they were retreating after having lost all their ships, and while <lb/>
            both themselves and their country were in danger, instead of be­ <lb/>
            ing in high hope ; but also because, on leaving their camp, every <lb/>
            one had grievous things both to behold with his eyes and to feel <lb/>
            in his heart. For as the dead lay unburied, and any one saw <lb/>
            a friend on the ground, he was struck at once with grief and <lb/>
            fear. And the living who were being left behind, wounded <lb/>
            or sick, were to the living a much more sorrowful spectacle <lb/>
            than the dead, and more piteous than those who had perished. <lb/>
            For having recourse to entreaties and wailings, they reduced <lb/>
            them to utter perplexity, begging to be taken away, and ap­ <lb/>
            pealing to each individual friend or relative that any of them <lb/>
            might any where see; o r hanging on their comrades, as they <lb/>
            were now going away; cr following as far as they could, and <pb n="502"/>
             <note type="margin">[76. </note> <lb/>
            when in any case the strength of their body failed, not being <lb/>
            left behind without 1many appeals to heaven and many lament­ <lb/>
            ations. So that the whole army, being filled with tears and <lb/>
            distress of this kind, did not easily get away, although from <lb/>
            an enemy's country, and although they had both suffered al­ <lb/>
            ready miseries too great for tears to express, and were still <lb/>
            afraid for the future, lest they might suffer more. There was <lb/>
            also amongst them much dejection and depreciation of their <lb/>
            own strength. For they resembled nothing but a city starved <lb/>
            out and attempting to escape; and no small one too, for of <lb/>
            their whole multitude there were not less than forty thou­ <lb/>
            sand on the march. Of these, all the rest took whatever each <lb/>
            one could that was useful, and the heavy-armed and cavalry <lb/>
            themselves, contrary to custom, carried their own food under <lb/>
            their arms, some for want of servants, others through distrust­ <lb/>
            ing them; for they had for a long time been deserting, and <lb/>
            did so in greatest numbers at that moment. And even what <lb/>
            they carried was not sufficient; for there was no longer any <lb/>
            food in the camp. Nor, again, was their other misery, and <lb/>
            their equal participation in sufferings, (though it affords some <lb/>
            alleviation to endure with others,) considered even on that <lb/>
            account easy to bear at the present time; especially, when <lb/>
            they reflected from what splendour and boasting at first they <lb/>
            had been reduced to such an abject termination. For this was <lb/>
            the greatest reverse that ever befell a Grecian army; since, <lb/>
            in contrast to their having come to enslave others, they had <lb/>
            to depart in fear of undergoing that themselves; and instead <lb/>
            of prayers and hymns, with which they sailed from home, they <lb/>
            had to start on their return with omens the very contrary of <lb/>
            these ; going by land, instead of by sea, and relying on a <lb/>
            military rather than a naval force. But nevertheless, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the greatness of the danger still impending, all <lb/>
            these things seemed endurable to them.</p>
          <p>76. Nicias, seeing the army dejected, and greatly changed, <lb/>
            passed along the ranks, and encouraged and cheered them, as <lb/>
            well as existing circumstances allowed; speaking still louder <lb/>

          <p>77. " Still, even in our present circumstances, Athenians <lb/>
            and allies, must we cherish hope ; for some men have, ere now, <lb/>
            been preserved even from more dreadful circumstances than <lb/>
            these. Nor should you think too meanly of yourselves, or <lb/>
            yield too much to your misfortunes and present sufferings, <lb/>
            which are beyond your desert. For my own part, though I <lb/>
            am not superior to any of you in strength, (for you see what <lb/>
            a state I am in through disease,) and though I consider <lb/>
            myself to be second to none, whether in my private life or <lb/>
            in other respects, yet now I am exposed to every danger, <lb/>
            like the very meanest. And yet I have lived with much <lb/>
            1devotion, as regards the gods, and much justice and freedom <lb/>
            from reproach, as regards men. And therefore my hope is <lb/>
            still strong for the future; and my calamities do not terrify <lb/>
            me, so much as they might. Nay, they may perhaps be alle­ <lb/>
            viated ; for our enemies have enjoyed enough good fortune; <lb/>
            and if we displeased any of the gods by making this expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, we have already been sufficiently punished for it. Others <lb/>
            also, we know, have ere now marched against their neighbours; <lb/>
            and after acting as men do, have suffered what they could en­ <lb/>
            dure. And so in our case it is reasonable now to hope that <lb/>
            we shall find the wrath of the gods mitigated; for we are now <lb/>
            deserving of pity at their hands, rather than of envy. Look­ <lb/>
            ing, too, on your own ranks, what experienced and numerous <lb/>
            men of arms there are with you, advancing in battle-array to­ <lb/>
            gether, do not be too much dismayed, but consider that you <lb/>
            are yourselves at once a city, wherever you may settle; and <lb/>
            that there is no other in Sicily that would either easily resist <lb/>
            your attack, or expel you when settled any where. With <lb/>
            regard to the march, that it may be safe and orderly, <lb/>
            look to that yourselves; with no other consideration, each <lb/>
            of you, than that whatever the spot on which he may be <lb/>
            compelled to fight, on that he will have, if victorious, both a <lb/>
            country and a fortress. And we shall hurry on our way both <lb/>
            by day and night alike, as we have but scanty provisions ; and <lb/>
            if we can only reach some friendly town of the Sicels, (for <lb/>

              at the same time, that if you escape from your enemies now, <lb/>

              at present, the great power of their country. For it is men <lb/>
              that make a city, and not walls, or ships, without any to man <lb/>
              them."</p>
          <p>78. Nicias, then, delivered this exhortation, and at the same <lb/>
            time went up to the troops, and if he saw them any where <lb/>
            straggling, and not marching in order, he collected and <lb/>
            brought them to their post; while Demosthenes also did no <lb/>
            less to those who were near him, addressing them in a similar <lb/>
            manner. They marched in the form of a hollow square, the <lb/>
            division under Nicias taking the lead, and that of Demosthenes <lb/>
            following ; while the baggage bearers and the main crowd of <lb/>
            camp followers were enclosed within the heavy-armed. When <lb/>
            they had come to the ford of the river Anapus, they found <lb/>
            drawn up at it a body of the Syracusans and allies; but having <lb/>
            routed these, and secured the passage, they proceeded onwards; <lb/>
            while the Syracusans pressed them with charges of horse, as <lb/>
            their light-armed did with their missiles. On that day the <lb/>
            Athenians advanced about forty stades, and then halted for <lb/>
            the night on a hill. The day following, they commenced <lb/>
            their march at an early hour, and having advanced about <lb/>
            twenty stades, descended into a level district, and there en­ <lb/>
            camped, wishing to procure some eatables from the houses, <lb/>
            (for the place was inhabited,) and to carry on with them water <lb/>
            from it, since for many stades before them, in the direction <lb/>
            they were to go, it was not plentiful. The Syracusans, in the <lb/>
            mean time, had gone on before, and were blocking up the pass <lb/>
            in advance of them. For there was there a steep hill, with a <lb/>
            precipitous ravine on either side of it, called the Acræum <lb/>
            Lepas. The next day the Athenians advanced, and the horse <lb/>
            and dart-men of the Syracusans and allies, each in great <lb/>
            numbers, impeded their progress, hurling their missiles upon <lb/>
            them, and annoying them with cavalry charges. The Athen.- <pb n="505"/>
             <note type="margin">79, 80.] <lb/>
            </note>ans fought for a long time, and then returned again to the <lb/>
            same camp, no longer having provisions as they had before; <lb/>
            for it was no more possible to leave their position, because of <lb/>
            the cavalry.</p>
          <p>79. Having started early, they began their march again, <lb/>
            and forced their way to the hill which had been fortified; <lb/>
            where they found before them the enemy's infantry drawn up <lb/>
            for the defence of the wall many spears deep ; for the pass was <lb/>
            but narrow. The Athenians charged and assaulted the wall, <lb/>
            but being annoyed with missiles by a large body from the hill, <lb/>
            which was steep, (for those on the heights more easily reached <lb/>
            their aim,) and not being able to force a passage, they re­ <lb/>
            treated again, and rested. There happened also to be at the <lb/>
            same time some claps of thunder and rain, as is generally the <lb/>
            case when the year is now verging on autumn; in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of which the Athenians were still more dispirited, and <lb/>
            thought that all these things also were conspiring together for <lb/>
            their ruin. While they were resting, Gylippus and the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans sent a part of their troops to intercept them again with <lb/>
            a wall on their rear, where they had already passed : but they, <lb/>
            on their side also, sent some of their men against them, and <lb/>
            prevented their doing it. After this, the Athenians returned <lb/>
            again with all their army into the more level country, <lb/>
            and there halted for the night. The next day they marched <lb/>
            forward, while the Syracusans discharged their weapons on <lb/>
            them, surrounding them on all sides, and disabled many with <lb/>
            wounds ; retreating if the Athenians advanced against them, <lb/>
            and pressing on them if they gave way; most especially at­ <lb/>
            tacking their extreme rear, in the hope that by routing them <lb/>
            little by little, they might strike terror into the whole army. <lb/>
            The Athenians resisted this mode of attack for a long time, <lb/>
            but then, after advancing five or six stades, halted for rest on <lb/>
            the plain; while the Syracusans also went away from them to <lb/>
            their own camp.</p>
          <p>80. During the night, their troops being in a wretched <lb/>
            condition, both from the want of all provisions which was now <lb/>
            felt, and from so many men being disabled by wounds in the <lb/>
            numerous attacks that had been made upon them by the <lb/>
            enemy, Nicias and Demosthenes determined to light as many <lb/>
            fires as possible, and then lead off the army, no longer by the <lb/>
            same route as they had intended, but in the opposite direction <pb n="506"/>
             <note type="margin">:si. </note> <lb/>
            to where the Syracusans were watching for them, namely, to <lb/>
            the sea. Now the whole of this road would lead the arma­ <lb/>
            ment, not towards Catana, but to the other side of Sicily, to <lb/>
            Camarina, and Gela, and the cities in that direction, whether <lb/>
            Grecian or barbarian. They kindled therefore many fires, <lb/>
            and began t'heir march in the night. And as all armies, and <lb/>
            especially the largest, are liable to have terrors and panics <lb/>
            produced amongst them, particularly when marching at night, <lb/>
            and through an enemy's country, and with the enemy not far <lb/>
            off; so they also were thrown into alarm; and the division of <lb/>
            Nicias, taking the lead as it did, kept together and got a long <lb/>
            way in advance ; while that of Demosthenes, containing about <lb/>
            half or more, was separated from the others, and proceeded in <lb/>
            greater disorder. By the morning, nevertheless, they arrived <lb/>
            at the sea-coast, and entering on what is called the Helorine <lb/>
            road, continued their march, in order that when they had <lb/>
            reached the river Cacyparis, they might march up along its <lb/>
            banks though the interior; for they hoped also that in this di­ <lb/>
            rection the Sicels, to whom they had sent, would come to meet <lb/>
            them. But when they had reached the river, they found a <lb/>
            guard of the Syracusans there too, intercepting the pass with <lb/>
            a wall and a palisade, having carried which, they crossed the <lb/>
            river, and marched on again to another called the Erineus; for <lb/>
            this was the route which their guides directed them to take.</p>
          <p>81. In the mean time the Syracusans and allies, as soon as <lb/>
            it was day, and they found that the Athenians had departed, <lb/>
            most of them charged Gylippus with havingpurposely let <lb/>
            them escape; and pursuing with all haste by the route which <lb/>
            they had no difficulty in finding they had taken, they overtook <lb/>
            them about dinner-time. When they came up with the troops <lb/>
            under Demosthenes, which were behind the rest, and marching <lb/>
            more slowly and disorderly, ever since they had been thrown <lb/>
            into confusion during the night, at the time we have mentioned, <lb/>
            they immediately fell upon and engaged them; and the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan horse surrounded them with greater ease from their <lb/>
            being divided, and confined them in a narrow space. The <lb/>
            division of Nicias was as much as fifty stades off in advance; <lb/>
            for he led them on more rapidly, thinking that their preserv­ <lb/>
            ation depended, under such circumstances, not on staying be­ <lb/>
            hind, if they could help it, and on fighting, but on retreating <unclear/> <lb/>
            quickly as possible, and only fighting as often as they were <pb n="507"/>
            <note type="margin"> 82, 83.] </note> <lb/>
            compelled. Demosthenes, on the other hand, was, generally <lb/>
            speaking, involved in more incessant labour, (because, as lie <lb/>
            was retreating in the rear, he was the first that the enemy at­ <lb/>
            tacked,) and on that occasion, finding that the Syracusans <lb/>
            were in pursuit, he was not so much inclined to push on, as to <lb/>
            form his men for battle; until, through thus loitering, he was <lb/>
            surrounded by them, and both himself and the Athenians with <lb/>
            him were thrown into great confusion. For being driven <lb/>
            back into a certain spot which had a wall all round it, with a <lb/>
            road on each side, and many olive trees growing about, they <lb/>
            were annoyed with missiles in every direction. This kind of <lb/>
            attack the Syracusans naturally adopted, instead of close com­ <lb/>
            bat ; for to risk their lives against men reduced to despair was <lb/>
            no longer for their advantage, so much as for that of the <lb/>
            Athenians. Besides, after success which was now so signal, <lb/>
            each man spared himself in some degree, that he might not be <lb/>
            cut off before the end of the business. They thought too that, <lb/>
            even as it was, they should by this kind of fighting subdue <lb/>
            and capture them.</p>
          <p>82. At any rate, when, after plying the Athenians and their <lb/>
            allies with missiles all day from every quarter, they saw them <lb/>
            now distressed by wounds and other sufferings, Gylippus <lb/>
            with the Syracusans and allies made a proclamation, in the <lb/>
            first place, that any of the islanders who chose should come <lb/>
            over to them, on condition of retaining his liberty: and some <lb/>
            few states went over. Afterwards, terms were made with all <lb/>
            the troops under Demosthenes, that they should surrender <lb/>
            their arms, and that no one should be put to death, either by <lb/>
            violence, or imprisonment, or want of such nourishment as <lb/>
            was most absolutely requisite. Thus there surrendered, in <lb/>
            all, to the number of six thousand; and the whole of the <lb/>
            money in their possession they laid down, throwing it into <lb/>
            the hollow of shields, four of which they filled with it. These <lb/>
            they immediately led back to the city, while Nicias and his <lb/>
            division arrived that day on the banks of the river Erineus ; <lb/>
            having crossed which, he posted his army on some high <lb/>
            ground.</p>
          <p>83. The Syracusans, having overtaken him the next day, <lb/>
            told him that Demosthenes and his division had surrendered <lb/>
            themselves, and called on him also to do the same. Being in­ <lb/>
            credulousof the fact, he obtained a truce to enable him to <pb n="508"/>
             <note type="margin">[84. </note> <lb/>
            send a horseman to sec. When he had gone, and brought <lb/>
            word back again that they had surrendered, Nicias sent a <lb/>
            herald to Gylippus and the Syracusans, saying that he was <lb/>
            ready to agree with the Syracusans, on behalf of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, to repay whatever money the Syracusans had spent on <lb/>
            the war, on condition of their letting his army go; and that <lb/>
            until the money was paid, he would give Athenians as host­ <lb/>
            ages, one for every talent. The Syracusans and Gylippus did <lb/>
            not accede to these proposals, but fell upon this division also, <lb/>
            and surrounded them on all sides, and annoyed them with their <lb/>
            missiles until late in the day. And they too, like the others, <lb/>
            were in a wretched plight for want of food and necessaries. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, they watched for the quiet of the night, and <lb/>
            then intended to pursue their march. And they were now <lb/>
            just taking up their arms, when the Syracusans perceived it <lb/>
            and raised their paean. The Athenians therefore, finding that <lb/>
            they had not eluded their observation, laid their arms down <lb/>
            again; excepting about three hundred men, who forced their <lb/>
            way through the sentinels, and proceeded, during the night, <lb/>
            how and where they could.</p>
          <p>84. As soon as it was day, Nicias led his troops forward; <lb/>
            while the Syracusans and allies pressed on them in the same <lb/>
            manner, discharging their missiles at them, and striking them <lb/>
            down with their javelins on every side. The Athenians were <lb/>
            hurrying on to reach the river Assinarus, being urged to this at <lb/>
            once by the attack made on every side of them by the numer­ <lb/>
            ous cavalry and the rest of the light-armed multitude, (for <lb/>
            they thought they should be more at ease if they were once <lb/>
            across the river,) and also by their weariness and craving for <lb/>
            drink. When they reached its banks, they rushed into it <lb/>
            without any more regard for order, every man anxious to be <lb/>
            himself the first to cross it; while the attack'of the enemy <lb/>
            rendered the passage more difficult. For being compelled to <lb/>
            advance in a dense body, they fell upon and trode down one <lb/>
            another; and some of them died immediately Ion the javelins <lb/>
            and articles of baggage, while others were entangled together, <lb/>
            and floated down the stream. On the other side of the river, <lb/>
            too, the Syracusans lined the bank, which was precipitous, and <note type="footnote"> I i. e. some died immediately on the javelins, while others fell over the <lb/>
            loose articles of baggage, and being toe weak to regain their footing, were <lb/>
            floated down the stream. </note> <pb n="509"/>
            <note type="margin"> 85, 86 I </note> <lb/>
            from the higher ground discharged their missiles on the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, while most of them were eagerly drinking, and in con­ <lb/>
            fusion amongst themselves in the hollow bed of the stream. The <lb/>
            Peloponnesians, moreover, came down to them and butchered <lb/>
            them, especially those in the river. And thus the water was <lb/>
            immediately spoiled; but nevertheless it was drunk by them, <lb/>
            mud and all, bloody as it was, and was even fought for by <lb/>
            most of them.</p>
          <p>85. At length, when many dead were now heaped one upon <lb/>
            another in the river, and the army was destroyed, either at <lb/>
            the river, or, even if any part had escaped, by the cavalry, <lb/>
            Nicias surrendered himself to Gylippus, placing more con­ <lb/>
            fidence in him than in the Syracusans; and desired him and <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians to do what they pleased with himself, but <lb/>
            to stop butchering the rest of the soldiers. After this, Gylip­ <lb/>
            pus commanded to make prisoners; and they collected all that <lb/>
            were alive, excepting such as they concealed for their own <lb/>
            benefit (of whom there was a large number). They also sent <lb/>
            a party in pursuit of the three hundred, who had forced their <lb/>
            way through the sentinels during the night, and took them. <lb/>
            The part of the army, then, that was collected as general <lb/>
            property, was not large, but that which was secreted was <lb/>
            considerable; and the whole of Sicily was filled with them, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they had not been taken on definite terms of sur­ <lb/>
            render, like those with Demosthenes. Indeed no small part <lb/>
            was actually put to death; for this was the most extensive <lb/>
            slaughter, and surpassed by none of all that occurred in this <lb/>
            Sicilian war. In the other encounters also, which were fre­ <lb/>
            quent on their march, no few had fallen. But many also <lb/>
            escaped, nevertheless; some at the moment, others after serv­ <lb/>
            ing as slaves, and running away subsequently. These found <lb/>
            a place of refuge at Catana.</p>
          <p>86. When the Syracusans and allies were assembled toge­ <lb/>
            ther, they took with them as many prisoners as they could, <lb/>
            with the spoils, and returned to the city. All the rest of the <lb/>
            Athenians and the allies that they had taken, they sent down <lb/>
            into the quarries, thinking this the safest way of keeping <lb/>
            them: but Nicias and Demosthenes they executed, against <lb/>
            the wish of Gylippus. For he thought it would be a glorious <lb/>
            distinction for him, in addition to all his other achievements, <lb/>
            to take to the Lacedæmonians even the generals who had comi' <pb n="510"/>
             <note type="margin">[87. </note> <lb/>
            manded Against them. And it so happened, that one of these, <lb/>
            namely Demosthenes, was regarded by them as their most in­ <lb/>
            veterate enemy, in consequence of what had occurred on the <lb/>
            island and at Pylus; the other, for the same reasons, as most <lb/>
            in their interest; for Nicias had exerted himself for the release <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians taken from the island, by persuading <lb/>
            the Athenians to make a treaty. On this account the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians had friendly feelings towards him; and indeed it <lb/>
            was mainly for the same reasons that he reposed confidence in <lb/>
            Gylippus, and surrendered himself to him. But certain of the <lb/>
            Syracusans (as it was said) were afraid, some of them, since <lb/>
            they bad held communication with him, that if put to the tor­ <lb/>
            ture, he might cause them trouble on that account in the midst <lb/>
            of their success; others, and especially the Corinthians, lest <lb/>
            he might bribe some, as he was rich, and effect his escape, and <lb/>
            so they should again incur mischief through his agency; and <lb/>
            therefore they persuaded the allies, and put him to death. For <lb/>
            this cause then, or something very like this, he was executed; <lb/>
            having least of all the Greeks in my time deserved to meet <lb/>
            with such a misfortune, on account of his devoted attention to <lb/>
            the practice of every virtue.</p>
          <p>87. As for those in the quarries, the Syracusans treated <lb/>
            them with cruelty during the first period of their captivity. <lb/>
            For as they were in a hollow place, and many in a small <lb/>
            compass, the sun, as well as the suffocating closeness, distressed <lb/>
            them at first, in consequence of their not being under cover; <lb/>
            and then, on the contrary, the nights coming on autumnal and <lb/>
            cold, soon worked in them an alteration from health to dis­ <lb/>
            ease, by means of the change. Since, too, in consequence of <lb/>
            their want of room, they did every thing in the same place; <lb/>
            and the dead, moreover, were piled up one on another-such <lb/>
            as died from their wounds, and from the change they had <lb/>
            experienced, and such like-there were, besides, intolerable <lb/>
            stenches: while at the same time they were tormented with <lb/>
            hunger and thirst; for during eight months they gave each of <lb/>
            them daily only a 1cotyle of water, and two of corn. And of <lb/>
            all the other miseries which it was likely that men thrown <lb/>
            into such a place would suffer, there was none that did not <note type="footnote"> 1 The cotyle was a little more than half an English pint; and the allow­ <lb/>

            together; but then they sold the rest of them, except the <lb/>
            Athenians, and whatever Siceliots or Italiots had joined <lb/>
            them in the expedition. The total number of those who were <lb/>
            taken, though it were difficult to speak with exactness, was <lb/>
            still not less than seven thousand. And this was the greatest <lb/>
            Grecian exploit of all that were performed in this war; nay, <lb/>
            in my opinion, of all Grecian achievements that we have <lb/>
            heard of also; and was at once most splendid for the con­ <lb/>
            querors, and most disastrous for the conquered. For being <lb/>
            altogether vanquished at all points, and having suffered in no <lb/>
            slight degree in any respect, they were destroyed (as the say­ <lb/>
            ing is) with utter destruction, both army, and navy, and every <lb/>
            thing; and only a few out of many returned home. Such <lb/>
            were the events which occurred in Sicily.</p><pb n="512"/>

          <p>1. WHEN the news was brought to Athens, for a long time <lb/>
            they disbelieved even the most respectable of the soldiers, <lb/>
            who had escaped from the very scene of action, and gave them <lb/>
            a correct account of it; not crediting that their forces could <lb/>
            have been so utterly destroyed. When, however, they were <lb/>
            convinced of it, they were angry with those of the orators who <lb/>
            had joined in promoting the expedition; (as though they had <lb/>
            not voted for it themselves;) and were enraged with the sooth­ <lb/>
            sayers and reciters of oracles, and whoever at that time by <lb/>
            any practice of divination had put them on hoping that they <lb/>
            should subdue Sicily. Every thing, indeed, on every side dis­ <lb/>
            tressed them; and after what had happened, fear and the <lb/>
            greatest consternation overwhelmed them. For they were at <lb/>
            once weighed down by the loss which every man individually, <lb/>
            as well as the whole state at large, had experienced, by the <lb/>
            destruction of so many heavy-armed, and horsemen, and <lb/>
            troops in the flower of their youth, like which they saw <lb/>
            they had none left; and at the same time being aware that <lb/>
            they had no competent number of ships in the docks, nor <lb/>
            money in the treasury, nor crews for their vessels, they were <lb/>
            at present without hope of saving themselves. They thought, <lb/>
            too, that they should have their enemies in Sicily directly sail­ <lb/>
            ing with their fleet against the Piræus, especially after they <lb/>
            had gained such a victory; and that their foes at home, then <lb/>
            doubly equipped on all points, would surely now press them <lb/>
            with all their might, both by land and by sea, and their own <lb/>
            allies with them in revolt. But nevertheless it was determined, <lb/>
            that, as far as their present resources allowed, they ought not <lb/>
            to submit, but to equip a fleet, by whatever means they could, <lb/>
            providing by contribution both timber and money; and to put <lb/>
            matters on a secure footing amongst the allies, especially in <lb/>
            Eubœa: and, moreover, to reform every thing in the city, with <pb n="513"/>
            <note type="margin"> 2, 3.] </note> <lb/>
            a view to greater economy, and elect a council of elders, who <lb/>
            should deliberate beforehand on their present measures, as <lb/>
            there might be occasion. And through their excessive fear at <lb/>
            the moment they were ready, (as is the people's fashion,) to be <lb/>
            orderly in every thing. Having thus determined, they acted <lb/>
            accordingly, and so the summer ended.</p>
          <p>2. The following winter, all the Greeks were immediately ex­ <lb/>
            cited by the great misfortune of the Athenians in Sicily. Those <lb/>
            who were not in alliance with either side thought, that even <lb/>
            f no one called on them for aid, they ought not any longer to <lb/>
            keep aloof from the war, but should volunteer to march against <lb/>
            the Athenians, when they reflected, severally, that they might <lb/>
            have attacked them also, if they had succeeded in their measures <lb/>
            at Syracuse; and, moreover, that the remainder of the war <lb/>
            would be but brief, and that it was creditable for them to take <lb/>
            their share in it. The allies of the Lacedæmonians, on the <lb/>
            other hand, felt to a greater degree than before a common <lb/>
            anxiety to have done speedily with their heavy labours. But, <lb/>
            above all, the subjects of the Athenians were ready, even be­ <lb/>
            yond their power, to revolt from them; because they judged <lb/>
            of affairs under the influence of strong feeling, and did not so <lb/>
            much as leave them a chance of being able to hold out the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing summer. The Lacedæmonian state was encouraged <lb/>
            by all these things, and most of all, because their allies in <lb/>
            Sicily, since their navy had now of necessity been added to <lb/>
            their resources, would in all probability be with them in great <lb/>
            force with the spring. And thus being on every account full <lb/>
            of hope, they determined to devote themselves unflinchingly to <lb/>
            the war, reckoning that by its successful termination they <lb/>
            would both be released in future from all dangers, like that <lb/>
            which would have encompassed them from the Athenians, if <lb/>
            they had won Sicily in addition to their other dominion; and <lb/>
            that, after subduing them, they would themselves then enjoy <lb/>
            n safety the supremacy over the whole of Greece.</p>
          <p>3. Agis, their king, set out therefore immediately, during <lb/>
            his winter, with some troops from Decelea, and levied from <lb/>
            the allies contributions for their fleet; and having turned in <lb/>
            the direction of the Malian gulf, and carried off, on the ground <lb/>
            of their long-standing enmity, the greater part of the exposed <lb/>
            property of the Œtæans, he exacted money for the ransom of <lb/>
            it; and also compelled the Achaeans of Pthiotis, and the other <note type="footnote">a I. </note> <pb n="514"/>
            <note type="margin"> [4,5 </note> <lb/>
            subjects of the Thessalians thereabouts, (though the Thessa­ <lb/>
            lians remonstrated with him, and objected to it,) to give both <lb/>
            hostages and money; the former of which he deposited at <lb/>
            Corinth, and endeavoured to bring their countrymen over to <lb/>
            the confederacy. The Lacedæmonians also issued to the states <lb/>
            a requisition for building a hundred ships, fixing their own <lb/>
            quota and that of the Bœotians at five and twenty each ; that <lb/>
            of the Phocians and Locrians together at fifteen ; that of the <lb/>
            Corinthians at fifteen; that of the Arcadians, Pellenians, and <lb/>
            Sicyonians, at ten; and that of the Megareans, Trœzenians, <lb/>
            Epidaurians, and Hermionians at ten. They were also <lb/>
            making all other preparations, with the intention of proceeding <lb/>
            immediately to war at the very commencement of spring.</p>
          <p>4. The Athenians too, as they had determined, were pre­ <lb/>
            paring during this same winter for building ships ; having con­ <lb/>
            tributed towards the supply of timbers, and fortified Sunium, <lb/>
            that their corn-ships might have a safe passage round; while <lb/>
            they also evacuated the fort in Laconia, which they had built <lb/>
            in that country when they were sailing by it for Sicily; and <lb/>
            with a view to economy retrenched all their other expenses, <lb/>
            whatever any where appeared to be useless expenditure; and, <lb/>
            above all, kept their eye on the allies, to prevent their revolt­ <lb/>
            ing from them.</p>
          <p>5. While both parties were carrying out these measures, <lb/>
            and engaged in preparation for the war, just as when they <lb/>
            were commencing it, the Eubœans, first of all, sent during this <lb/>
            winter an embassy to Agis, to treat of their revolting from the <lb/>
            Athenians. He acceded to their proposals, and sent for Alca­ <lb/>
            menes son of Sthenelaidas, and for Melanthus, to come from <lb/>
            Sparta and take the command in Eubcea. Accordingly they <lb/>
            came with about three hundred of the Neodamodes, and he <lb/>
            began to prepare for their crossing over. But in the mean <lb/>
            time some Lesbians also came to him; for they, too, wished <lb/>
            to revolt. And as the Boeotians supported their application, <lb/>
            A,,-is was persuaded to defer acting in the cause of Euboea, <lb/>
            and made preparations for the revolt of the Lesbians, giving <lb/>
            them Alcamenes as a commander, who was to sail to Eubœa; <lb/>
            while the Bœotians promised them ten ships, and Agis the <lb/>
            same number. These measures were undertaken without the <lb/>
            authority of the Lacedæmonian state; for as long as Agis was <lb/>
            at Decelea, and his forces with him, he had power both to send <pb n="515"/>
            <note type="margin"> 8.] <lb/>
            </note>troops to whatever quarter he pleased, and to levy soldiers and <lb/>
            money. And at this time the allies obeyed him, one might <lb/>
            say, much more than the Lacedæmonians in the city: for he <lb/>
            was feared, because he went every where in person with a <lb/>
            force at his command. He, then, furthered the views of the <lb/>
            Lesbians. The Chians and Erythræans, on the other hand, <lb/>
            who were also ready to revolt, made their application, not to <lb/>
            Agis, but at Sparta. There went with them also an ambassador <lb/>
            from Tissaphernes, who was governor of the sea-coast under <lb/>
            king Darius, son of Artaxerxes. For Tissaphernes also was <lb/>
            inviting the Lacedæmonians to co-operate with him, and <lb/>
            promised to furnish them with supplies. For he had lately <lb/>
            been called on by the king for the tribute due from his govern­ <lb/>
            ment, for which he was in arrears, as he could not raise it <lb/>
            from the Greek cities because of the Athenians. He thought, <lb/>
            therefore, that he should both get in his tribute more effectu­ <lb/>
            ally, if he reduced the power of the Athenians; and at the <lb/>
            same time should gain for the king the alliance of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians ; and either take alive, or put to death, as the king <lb/>
            had commanded him to do, Amorges, the natural son of <lb/>
            Pisuthnes, who was in rebellion on the coast of Caria. The <lb/>
            Chians and Tissaphernes, then, were negotiating this business <lb/>
            in concert.</p>
          <p>6. About the same time Calligitus son of Laophon, a Me­ <lb/>
            garean, and Timagoras son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both <lb/>
            of them exiles from their country, and living at the court of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus son of Pharnaces, arrived at Lacedæmon, being <lb/>
            sent by Pharnabazus to bring a fleet despatched to the Hel­ <lb/>
            lespont ; and that he himself, if possible, might, for the sake <lb/>
            of the tribute, cause the cities in his government to revolt <lb/>
            from the Athenians — the same object as Tissaphernes had <lb/>
            in view — and gain for the king, by his own agency, the <lb/>
            alliance of the Lacedæmonians, While these negotiations were <lb/>
            severally carried on by each party, by the emissaries both of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus and of Tissaphernes, there was great competition <lb/>
            between them at Lacedæmon, the one striving to prevail on <lb/>
            them to send a navy and army to Ionia and Chios first, the <lb/>
            other, to the Hellespont. The Lacedæmonians, however, ac­ <lb/>
            ceded with a very decided preference to the application of the <lb/>
            Chians and Tissaphernes. For Alcibiades was also co-oper­ <lb/>
            atiug with them, being the hereditary and very intimate friend <note type="footnote"> 2 L 2 </note> <pb n="516"/>
            <note type="margin"> [7,8. </note> <lb/>
            of Endius, one of the ephors; for which reason also his family <lb/>
            had a Lacedæmonian name, in consequence of this friendship; <lb/>
            1for Endius was called " the son of Alcibiades." However, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians first sent to Chios Phrynis, one of the <lb/>
            Periceci, to ascertain whether they had as many ships as they <lb/>
            said, and whether their city corresponded with the represent­ <lb/>
            ations of its high character: and when he brought them word <lb/>
            back that what they heard was true, they straightway took <lb/>
            the Chians and Erythræans into alliance, and resolved to send <lb/>
            them forty ships, as there were already there (according to the <lb/>
            statement of the Chians) not less than sixty. Of these they <lb/>
            themselves at first intended to send ten, with Melancridas, who <lb/>
            was their high admiral; but afterwards, an earthquake hav­ <lb/>
            ing occurred, instead of Melancridas they determined to send <lb/>
            Chalcideus, and instead of the ten ships to equip but five in <lb/>
            Laconia. And thus the winter ended, and the nineteenth <lb/>
            year of this war of which Thucydides wrote the history.</p>
          <p>7. The following summer, when the Chians straightway <lb/>
            urged them to despatch the fleet, and were afraid that the <lb/>
            Athenians might get intelligence of their measures, (for all <lb/>
            parties sent their embassies without their knowledge,) the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians sent three Spartans to Corinth, to haul the ships <lb/>
            as quickly as possible across the isthmus, from the opposite sea <lb/>
            to that on the side of Athens, and to give orders for them all <lb/>
            to sail to Chios, both those which Agis was preparing for <lb/>
            Lesbos, and the rest. Now the total number of the ships <lb/>
            belonging to the allied states that were there was thirty-nine.</p>
          <p>8. Calligitus, then, and Timagoras, acting in behalf of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, did not join the rest in the expedition to Chios, <lb/>
            or give, to forward the despatch of the fleet, the money which <lb/>
            they had brought with them, namely, five and twenty talents ; <lb/>
            but they intended to sail afterwards by themselves with a <lb/>
            fresh armament. Agis, on the contrary, seeing that the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians were determined to send to Chios first, did not <lb/>
            himself maintain any different view; but the allies assembled <lb/>
            at Corinth, and held a council, when they resolved to sail first <lb/>
            to Chios, with Chalcideus as commander, who was equipping <note type="footnote">1 " That is, Alcibiades was the distinguishing family name of this Endi­ <lb/>

            the five vessels in Laconia; then to Lesbos, with Alcamenes <lb/>
            in. command, (the same person as Agis intended to appoint;) <lb/>
            and, lastly, to go to the Hellespont, where Clearchus, son of <lb/>
            Ramphias, was appointed to the command. But they deter­ <lb/>
            mined to take only half the ships across the isthmus first, and <lb/>
            let these sail off immediately; that the Athenians might not <lb/>
            attend to those which were setting out, so much as to those <lb/>
            which were being conveyed across after them. For in this <lb/>
            case they were making their expedition openly, as they im­ <lb/>
            puted to the Athenians a want of power to oppose them, be­ <lb/>
            cause no numerous fleet belonging to them was yet visible. <lb/>
            And so, according to their resolution, they immediately took <lb/>
            across one and twenty ships.</p>
          <p>9. But when they were urgent for setting sail, the Corinth­ <lb/>
            ians were not disposed to accompany them before they had <lb/>
            kept the Isthmian festival, for which that was the time. Agis <lb/>
            expressed to them his willingness that they (according to what <lb/>
            they urged) should not break the Isthmian truce, but that he <lb/>
            should make the expedition on his own responsibility. When, <lb/>
            however, the Corinthians did not agree to this, but a delay <lb/>
            was caused in the matter, the Athenians the more easily <lb/>
            gained intelligence of the designs of the Chians ; and sending <lb/>
            Aristocrates, one of their generals, charged them with the <lb/>
            fact, and on their denying it, commanded them to send with <lb/>
            them some ships, as a pledge of good faith in their alliance. <lb/>
            Accordingly they sent seven. The reason of the ships being <lb/>
            sent was, that the majority of the Chians were ignorant of the <lb/>
            negotiations; while the few who were privy to them were <lb/>
            both unwilling at present to incur the hostility of their com­ <lb/>
            mons, before they had gained some strength, and no longer <lb/>
            expected the Peloponnesians to come, since they had so long <lb/>
            delayed.</p>
          <p>10. In the mean time the Isthmian games were being cele­ <lb/>
            brated, and the Athenians (the sacred truce having been pro­ <lb/>
            claimed) went to attend them ; and thus the designs of the Chians <lb/>
            became more evident to them. When they returned, they im­ <lb/>
            mediately took measures that the fleet might not put out from <lb/>
            Cenchrea unobserved by them. After the festival the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians set sail for Chios with one and twenty ships under <lb/>
            the command of Alcamenes ; and the Athenians, having at <lb/>
            first advanced against them with an equal number, then be- <pb n="518"/>
             <note type="margin">[11 <lb/>
            </note>gan to retreat towards the open sea. When the enemy <lb/>
            did not follow them far, but drew back, the Athenians like­ <lb/>
            wise returned; for they had the seven Chian vessels in the <lb/>
            number of those with them, and did not consider them trust­ <lb/>
            worthy. Afterwards, having manned others, so as to make in <lb/>
            all thirty-seven, while the enemy were coasting along, they <lb/>
            chased them into Piraeus, in the Corinthian territory. This <lb/>
            is a desert port, on the extreme borders of Epidaurus. The <lb/>
            Peloponnesians lost one ship out at sea, but collected the rest, <lb/>
            and brought them to anchor. And now, when the Athenians <lb/>
            both attacked them by sea with their ships, and had landed <lb/>
            on the shore, there was a great disorder and confusion; and <lb/>
            the Athenians severely damaged most of their ships on the <lb/>
            beach, and killed Alcamenes their commander; whilst some <lb/>
            also fell on their own side.</p>
          <p>11. After parting, they posted a sufficient number of ships <lb/>
            to keep watch over those of the enemy, and with the rest came <lb/>
            to anchor at the small island I [opposite the mouth of the har­ <lb/>
            bour] ; on which, as it was not far off, they proceeded to en­ <lb/>
            camp, and sent to Athens for a reinforcement. For the <lb/>
            Corinthians, too, had joined the Peloponnesians on the day <lb/>
            after the battle, coming to the succour of the ships ; and not <lb/>
            long after, the rest of the people in the neighbourhood also. <lb/>
            But when they saw that to keep guard over them in so desert <lb/>
            a spot was a difficult service, they were at a loss what to do, <lb/>
            and thought of burning the ships; but afterwards they deter­ <lb/>
            mined to draw them up on shore, and station themselves by <lb/>
            them with their land forces, and keep guard until some favour­ <lb/>
            able opportunity of escape presented itself. Agis also, on <lb/>
            receiving intelligence of this, sent to them a Spartan, namely <lb/>
            Thermon. Now news had first been taken to the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians that their ships had put to sea from the isthmus, (for <lb/>
            Alcamenes had been told by the ephors to send a horseman <lb/>
            when that took place,) and they immediately wished to despatch <lb/>
            their five ships, with Chalcideus in command, and Alcibiades <lb/>
            with him. Afterwards, when they had resolved on this, the <lb/>
            news of their fleet taking refuge in Piræus reached them ; and <lb/>
            being disheartened, because they had failed in their first opera­ <lb/>
            tions in the Ionian war, they no longer thought of sending the <note type="footnote"> 1 It TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">νησίδιον</foreign>.] This explanation of the article is taken from CoL Leiko. <lb/>

            ships from their own country, but even of recalling some that <lb/>
            had previously put out to sea.</p>
          <p>12. When Alcibiades knew this, he again persuaded Endius <lb/>
            and the rest of the ephors not to shrink from the expedition ; <lb/>
            telling them that they would have made their voyage before <lb/>
            the Chians heard of the disaster which had befallen their <lb/>
            fleet; and that he himself, when he had once reached Ionia, <lb/>
            would easily persuade the cities to revolt, by acquainting them <lb/>
            both with the weakness of the Athenians and the forwardness <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians ; for he should be thought more credi­ <lb/>
            ble than others. To Endius himself he also represented in <lb/>
            private, that it would be a glorious thing to have caused by <lb/>
            his own agency the revolt of Ionia, and to have brought the <lb/>
            king into alliance with the Lacedæmonians, instead of that <lb/>
            honour being earned by Agis; (for with him he happened to <lb/>
            be at variance.) He, then, having prevailed on the rest of <lb/>
            the ephors, as well as Endius, put out to sea with the five <lb/>
            ships, in company with Chalcideus the Lacedæmonian, and <lb/>
            they proceeded on their voyage with all speed.</p>
          <p>13. About this same time also, the sixteen Peloponnesian <lb/>
            vessels in Sicily which with Gylippus had assisted in bringing <lb/>
            the war to a conclusion, were on their return ; and after being <lb/>
            intercepted near Leucadia, and roughly handled by the seven <lb/>
            and twenty Athenian ships which Hippocles son of Menippus <lb/>
            commanded, on the look-out for the ships from Sicily, the rest <lb/>
            of them, with the exception of one, escaped from the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, and sailed into harbour at Corinth.</p>
          <p>14. With regard to Chalcideus and Alcibiades, while they <lb/>
            were on their voyage, they seized all they met with, to prevent <lb/>
            any tidings of their approach being carried; and after first <lb/>
            touching at Corycus, and leaving them there, they themselves <lb/>
            having previously had an interview with some of the Chians <lb/>
            who were in co-operation with them, and being urged by them <lb/>
            to sail up to the city without sending any notice beforehand, <lb/>
            they thus came upon the Chians unexpectedly. Accordingly <lb/>
            the greater part of them were astonished and dismayed ; while <lb/>
            it had been arranged by the few, that the council should be <lb/>
            assembled just at the time. And when speeches were made <lb/>
            by Chalcideus and Alcibiades, telling them that many more <lb/>
            vessels were sailing up, and not acquainting them with the fact <lb/>
            respecting theirfleet being blockaded in Piræus, the Chians <pb n="520"/>
             <note type="margin">[15,16. </note> <lb/>
            revolted from the Athenians, and immediately after them the <lb/>
            Erythræans. After this they sailed with three vessels and <lb/>
            induced Clazomense to revolt also. The Clazomenians imme­ <lb/>
            diately crossed over to the continent, and began to fortify <lb/>
            1 Polichna, in case they might want it as a place to retreat to <lb/>
            from the island on which they lived. They, then, having re­ <lb/>
            volted, were all engaged in raising fortifications and preparing <lb/>
            for the war.</p>
          <p>15. News of the revolt of Chios quickly reached Athens, <lb/>
            and considering that the danger which had now encompassed <lb/>
            them was great and evident, and that the rest of the allies <lb/>
            would not remain quiet when the most important state had <lb/>
            changed sides; with regard to the thousand talents which <lb/>
            throughout the whole war they had earnestly desired not to <lb/>
            meddle with, they immediately rescinded, in consequence of <lb/>
            their dismay, the penalties attaching to any one who proposed <lb/>
            to use them, or put such a proposal to the vote; and passed a <lb/>
            decree for taking them, and manning a large number of ships ; <lb/>
            while of those that were keeping watch at Piræus they at once <lb/>
            sent off the eight which had left the blockade, and after pur­ <lb/>
            suing those with Chalcideus and not overtaking them, had <lb/>
            returned, (their commander was Strombichides son of Dioti­ <lb/>
            mus,) and resolved that twelve more, under Thrasycles, should <lb/>
            also leave the post of observation, and reinforce them shortly <lb/>
            afterwards. They also removed the seven Chian vessels, which <lb/>
            joined them in the blockade of Piræus; and liberated the <lb/>
            slaves who were on board of them, while the freemen they put <lb/>
            in bonds. In the place of all the ships that had departed they <lb/>
            speedily manned others, and sent them to observe the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians, resolving at the same time to man thirty more. <lb/>
            So great was their ardour ? and no trivial measure was under­ <lb/>
            taken with regard to the forces they sent to Chios.</p>
          <p>16. In the mean time Strombichides with his eight ships ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Samos, and having added one Samian vessel to his <lb/>
            squadron, he sailed to Teos, and begged them to remain quiet. <lb/>
            Chalcideus also was advancing with three and twenty ships <lb/>
            from Chios to Teos ; while at the same time the land forces of <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴνΠολίχναν</foreign>..] " This is a general name which has become a proper <lb/>
            one by usage, like Ham, Kirby, &amp;c. in English; or more like ‘Borgo’in <lb/>

            the Clazomenians and Erythraeans moved along the shore. <lb/>
            Strombichides, on receiving prior intelligence of this, weighed <lb/>
            anchor beforehand ; but when out in the open sea, on observing <lb/>
            that the ships coming from Chios were so numerous, he fled <lb/>
            towards Samos, while they pursued him. With regard to the <lb/>
            land forces, although the Teians were not at first disposed to <lb/>
            admit them, yet when the Athenians had fled, they received <lb/>
            them into the city. The troops then waited for some time, <lb/>
            expecting Chalcideus also to return from the pursuit: but <lb/>
            when he was long in coming, they began themselves to de­ <lb/>
            molish the fort which the Athenians had built on the land side <lb/>
            of the city of the Teians ; while a small body of the barbari­ <lb/>
            ans also, who had joined them under the command of Stages, <lb/>
            lieutenant of Tissaphernes, assisted them in the demolition <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>17. Chalcideus and Alcibiades, after chasing Strombichides <lb/>
            into Samos, armed the seamen on board the vessels from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, and left them at Chios; and having manned, <lb/>
            these with substitutes from Chios, and twenty besides, they <lb/>
            sailed to Miletus to effect its revolt. For Alcibiades, being on <lb/>
            intimate terms with the leading men of the Milesians, wished <lb/>
            to anticipate the ships from the Peloponnese by winning them <lb/>
            over, and so to secure that honour, as he had promised, to the <lb/>
            Chians, himself, Chalcideus, and Endius who had sent them <lb/>
            out, by causing the revolt of as many cities as possible in con­ <lb/>
            cert with the Chian forces and Chalcideus. Having made <lb/>
            therefore the chief part of their passage unobserved, and hav­ <lb/>
            ing arrived a little before Strombichides and Thrasycles, who <lb/>
            had just come from Athens with twelve ships, and joined in <lb/>
            the pursuit of them, they prevailed on Miletus to revolt. The <lb/>
            Athenians sailed up close after them with nineteen ships, and <lb/>
            on the Milesians not admitting them, came to anchor at the <lb/>
            adjacent island of Lade. And now the first alliance made be­ <lb/>
            tween the king and the Lacedæmonians was concluded by <lb/>
            Tissaphernes and Chalcideus, immediately after the revolt of <lb/>
            the Milesians, to the following effect:</p>
          <p>18. " The following are the terms on which the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and their confederates concluded an alliance with the <lb/>
            king and Tissaphernes. All the country and cities which the <lb/>
            king holds, or the forefathers of the king held, shall belong to <lb/>
            the king: and from these cities whatever money, or any thing <pb n="522"/>
             <note type="margin">[19, 20 <lb/>
            </note>else, came in to the Athenians, shall be stopped by the king, <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians and their confederates, in common ; so that <lb/>
            the Athenians may receive neither money nor any thing else. <lb/>
            -Moreover, the war with the Athenians shall be carried on <lb/>
            in common by the king, the Lacedæmonians, and their con­ <lb/>
            federates ; and it shall not be lawful to bring the war with the <lb/>
            Athenians to a conclusion, except both parties shall agree to <lb/>
            it, the king, and the Lacedæmonians with their confederates. <lb/>
            -Should any revolt from the king, they shall be considered <lb/>
            as enemies to the Lacedæmonians and their confederates; and <lb/>
            if any revolt from the Lacedæmonians and their confederates, <lb/>
            they shall be considered as enemies to the king, in like <lb/>
            manner."</p>
          <p>19. This, then, was the alliance that was concluded; imme­ <lb/>
            diately after which the Chians manned ten more ships, and <lb/>
            sailed to Anæa, wishing both to get intelligence of those in <lb/>
            Miletus, and at the same time to urge the cities to revolt But <lb/>
            a message having reached them from Chalcideus, that they <lb/>
            were to sail back again, and that Amorges would be upon <lb/>
            them with an army on shore, they sailed to the temple of <lb/>
            Jupiter, and then descried sixteen ships, with which Diome­ <lb/>
            don again, subsequently to the arrival of Thrasicles, was sail­ <lb/>
            ing up from Athens. On seeing them they fled with one ship <lb/>
            to Ephesus, while the rest proceeded towards Teos. The <lb/>
            Athenians, then, took four of their ships empty, the men hav­ <lb/>
            ing escaped to shore beforehand; but the rest took refuge in <lb/>
            the city of the Teians. And now the Athenians sailed away <lb/>
            from Samos ; while the Chians put out with their remaining <lb/>
            vessels, and their land forces with them, and procured the re <lb/>
            volt of Lebedos, and then again of Eræ. After this they re­ <lb/>
            turned to their respective homes, both the land and the sea <lb/>
            forces.</p>
          <p>20. About the same time, the twenty ships of the Pclopon­ <lb/>
            nesians that were in Piræus, which had been chased to land <lb/>
            at the time we last mentioned them, and were blockaded by the <lb/>
            Athenians with an equal number, having made a sudden sally <lb/>
            against the Athenian squadron, and defeated it in an engage­ <lb/>
            ment, took four of the ships, and after sailing back to Cenchrea, <lb/>
            proceeded to prepare again for their voyage to Chios and Ionia. <lb/>
            Astyochus also joined them from Lacedæmon, as high admiral, to <lb/>
            whom now belonged the command of all the naval forces. Mean- <pb n="523"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="21—23."/> <lb/>
            while, after the troops bad returned from Teos, Tissaphernes <lb/>
            himself also repaired thither with an army, and further de­ <lb/>
            molished the fort at Teos, whatever had been left of it, and <lb/>
            then returned. Not long after his departure, Diomedon, hav­ <lb/>
            ing arrived with ten Athenian ships, concluded a treaty with <lb/>
            the Teians for admitting his force, as they did the enemy's. <lb/>
            And after coasting along to Eras, and assaulting the city <lb/>
            without taking it, he sailed away.</p>
          <p>21. About the same time, too, occurred at Samos the insur­ <lb/>
            rection of the commons against the nobles, in conjunction with <lb/>
            some Athenians who happened to be there on board three <lb/>
            vessels. The popular party of the Samians, then, put to <lb/>
            death some two hundred of the nobles, in all, and condemned <lb/>
            four hundred to banishment; and having themselves taken <lb/>
            possession of their land and houses, (the Athenians, moreover, <lb/>
            having after this passed a decree for their independence, con­ <lb/>
            sidering them now as trusty allies,) they governed the city <lb/>
            henceforth, and neither admitted the landowners to any other <lb/>
            privilege, nor allowed any of the commons in future to give <lb/>
            his daughter in marriage to them, nor to take a wife from <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>22. After these things, in the course of the same summer, <lb/>
            the Chians went on as they had begun, without any falling <lb/>
            off in their zeal; and as they found themselves, even inde­ <lb/>
            pendently of the Lacedæmonians, with a large force for bring­ <lb/>
            ing over the states, and at the same time were desirous that <lb/>
            as many as possible should share the danger with them, they <lb/>
            made an expedition by themselves with thirteen ships to Les­ <lb/>
            bos, according to the arrangement of the Lacedaemonians to <lb/>
            go to that island in the second place, and thence to the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, while at the same time the land forces of the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians who were there, and of the allies from the country <lb/>
            .itself, moved along shore towards Clazomenæ and Cuma; the <lb/>
            commander of the troops being Evalas, a Spartan, and of the <lb/>
            ships, Diniadas, one of the Periœci. The fleet having sailed <lb/>
            first to Methymna, effected the revolt of the place, and four <lb/>
            vessels were left there; while the remainder, again, effected <lb/>
            that of Mytilene also.</p>
          <p>23. Now Astyochus, the Lacedæmonian admiral, set sail, as <lb/>
            he had intended, with four ships from Cenchrea, and arrived <lb/>
            at Chios. On the third day after his coming there, the Athe- <pb n="524"/>
             <note type="margin">[24. </note> <lb/>
            nian ships, five and twenty in number, sailed to Lesbos under <lb/>
            the command of Leon and Diomedon; for Leon had subse­ <lb/>
            quently brought a reinforcement of ten ships from Athens. <lb/>
            The same day, at a late hour, Astyochus also put out, and <lb/>
            taking one Chian vessel in addition to his own, sailed to Les­ <lb/>
            bos, to render it whatever assistance he could. Accordingly <lb/>
            he came to Pyrrha, and thence the next day to Eresus, where <lb/>
            he heard that Mitylene had been taken by the Athenians on <lb/>
            the first assault. For the Athenians, immediately on sailing <lb/>
            to the place, unexpectedly put into the harbour, and defeated <lb/>
            the Chian ships; and having landed, and conquered in a battle <lb/>
            those who opposed them, they took possession of the city. <lb/>
            Receiving this intelligence, both from the Eresians and from <lb/>
            the Chian ships coming from Methymna with Eubulus, three <lb/>
            of which fell in with him, (for one had been taken by the <lb/>
            Athenians,) after being left behind at the time, and so escap­ <lb/>
            ing when Mitylene was taken, Astyochus no longer advanced <lb/>
            to Mitylene, but having persuaded Eresus to revolt, and sup­ <lb/>
            plied it with arms, he both sent the heavy-armed from on <lb/>
            board his own ships to Antissa and Methymna, having ap­ <lb/>
            pointed Eteonicus to the command, and himself coasted along <lb/>
            thither with his own ships and the three Chians ; hoping that <lb/>
            the Methymnæans would be encouraged by the sight of them, <lb/>
            and persevere in their revolt. But when every thing at Lesbos <lb/>
            went against him, he took his own force on board, and sailed <lb/>
            back to Chios; while the land forces also that had been dis­ <lb/>
            embarked from the vessels, and were to have proceeded to the <lb/>
            Hellespont, returned again to their several cities. After this, <lb/>
            six of the allied ships from the Peloponnese that were at <lb/>
            Cenchrea came to them at Chios. The Athenians, on the <lb/>
            other hand, arranged matters again at Lesbos, and sailing <lb/>
            thence, took Polichna, belonging to the Clazomenians, which <lb/>
            was being fortified on the mainland, and carried them over <lb/>
            again to their city on the island, excepting the authors of the <lb/>
            revolt, who had departed to Daphnus. And thus Clazomenæ <lb/>
            came over again to the Athenians.</p>
          <p>24. The same summer the Athenians, who were with their <lb/>
            twenty ships at Lade fot the observation of Miletus, having <lb/>
            made a descent at Panormus in the Milesian territory, slew <lb/>
            Chalcideus, the Lacedæmonian commander, who had come <lb/>
            against them with a few men, and sailing across three days <pb n="525"/>
             <note type="margin">24.1 </note> <lb/>
            after, erected a trophy; which, as it had been raised without <lb/>
            their having command of the country, the Milesians threw <lb/>
            down. And now Leon and Diomedon, with the Athenian <lb/>
            ships from Lesbos, advancing from the Œnussæ, the islands <lb/>
            off Chios, and from Sidussa and Pteleum, fortresses which <lb/>
            they held in the Erythræan country, as well as from Lesbos, <lb/>
            carried on the war against the Chians from their ships, having <lb/>
            as epibatœ,some of the 1 heavy-armed from the muster-roll, <lb/>
            who had been pressed into the service. Having landed at <lb/>
            Cardamyle and Bolissus, after defeating in battle those of the <lb/>
            Chians who had come out against them, and killing many of <lb/>
            them, they desolated the places in that neighbourhood. They <lb/>
            defeated them again in another battle at Phanæ, and in a third <lb/>
            at Leuconium, after which the Chians no longer went out to <lb/>
            meet them; while they ravaged their country, which was <lb/>
            finely stocked, and had continued unhurt from the Median <lb/>
            wars down to that time. For the Chians are the only people <lb/>
            that I am acquainted with, after the Lacedæmonians, who were <lb/>
            at once prosperous and prudent; and the more their city in­ <lb/>
            creased in greatness, the more secure were their arrangements. <lb/>
            And even their present revolt, if any think that they executed <lb/>
            this without regard for the safer course, they did not venture <lb/>
            to make, before they were likely to run the risk in concert with <lb/>
            many brave allies, and perceived that even the Athenians them­ <lb/>
            selves no longer denied, after their disaster in Sicily, that with­ <lb/>
            out doubt their circumstances were utterly bad. But if they <lb/>
            were somewhat disappointed by the unexpected results that <lb/>
            occur in the life of man, they found out their mistake in com­ <lb/>
            pany with many others, who had in the same way imagined <lb/>
            that the power of the Athenians would be quickly destroyed. <lb/>
            When therefore they were excluded from the sea, and were <lb/>
            being ravaged by land, a party of them endeavoured to bring <lb/>
            over the city to the Athenians. Though the magistrates de­ <lb/>
            tected them, they remained quiet themselves, and having <lb/>
            brought Astyochus the admiral from Erythrae with four ships, <lb/>
            which he had with him, considered how they might stop the <lb/>
            conspiracy by the mildest measures, whether by taking host- <note type="footnote"> 1 " The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιάται</foreign> were usually drawn from the fourth class, or Thetes; <lb/>

            ages, or in any other way. They, then, were engaged with <lb/>
            this business.</p>
          <p>25. At the close of the same summer, there sailed from <lb/>
            Athens a thousand Athenian heavy-armed, fifteen hundred of <lb/>
            the Argives, (for five hundred of the Argives who were light- <lb/>
            armed, were provided with full armour by the Athenians,) and <lb/>
            a thousand of the allies, in forty-eight ships, some of which <lb/>
            were transports, under the command of Phrynichus, Onomacles, <lb/>
            and Scironides: these sailed into port at Samos, and after <lb/>
            crossing over to Miletus, formed their camp there. The Mi­ <lb/>
            lesians marched out, themselves to the number of eight hun­ <lb/>
            dred heavy-armed, the Peloponnesians who had come with <lb/>
            Chalcideus, and a body of foreign 1 mercenaries with Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes himself, who was present with his cavalry, and gave <lb/>
            battle to the Athenians and their allies. The Argives, ad­ <lb/>
            vancing from the line with their own wing, and despising the <lb/>
            enemy, while they pushed forward in some disorder, as against <lb/>
            Ionians and men who would not receive their charge, were <lb/>
            defeated by the Milesians, and not less than three hundred of <lb/>
            them slain. But the Athenians defeated the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            first, then beat back the barbarians and the rest of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude, and without engaging the Milesians, (for they retreated <lb/>
            into their city after their rout of the Argives, on seeing the <lb/>
            rest of their army worsted,) they pitched their camp, as being <lb/>
            now victorious, close to the very city of Miletus. And it so <lb/>
            happened, that in this battle the Ionians on both sides were <lb/>
            superior to the Dorians; for the Athenians conquered the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians opposed to them, and the Milesians the Ar­ <lb/>
            gives. After erecting a trophy, the Athenians prepared to in­ <lb/>
            vest the place, (which stood on an isthmus,) thinking that if <lb/>
            they could win Miletus, the other towns would easily come <lb/>
            over to them.</p>
          <p>26. In the mean time, when it was now about dusk in the <lb/>
            evening, intelligence reached them that the five and fifty <lb/>
            ships from the Peloponnese and from Sicily were all but there. <lb/>
            For from the Siceliots, who were chiefly urged by Hermo <lb/>
            crates the Syracusan to take part in what remained for the <lb/>
            destruction of the Athenians, there came twenty ships of the <lb/>
            Syracusans, and two of the Selinuntines ; and those from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, which they were preparing, [when we last men- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενικόν</foreign>,]i. e. foreigners to Tissaphernes, not Asiatics. </note> <pb n="527"/>

            tioned them,] were now ready: and both squadrons being <lb/>
            committed to Theramenes the Lacedæmonian to take to Asty­ <lb/>
            ochus the admiral, put in to Lerus first, the island before Mi­ <lb/>
            letus. Then, on finding that the Athenians were at Miletus, <lb/>
            they sailed thence into the Iasic gulf in the first place, <lb/>
            wishing to know the state of affairs with regard to Miletus, <lb/>
            When Alcibiades therefore had gone on horseback to Tichiussa, <lb/>
            in the Milesian territory, to which part of the gulf they had <lb/>
            sailed and brought to for the night, they heard the particulars <lb/>
            of the battle. For Alcibiades was present at it, taking part <lb/>
            with the Milesians and Tissaphernes ; and he now advised <lb/>
            them, if they did not wish to sacrifice Ionia and the whole <lb/>
            cause, to go as quickly as possible to the relief of Miletus, and <lb/>
            not permit it to be invested.</p>
          <p>27. They, then, intended to relieve it in the morning. <lb/>
            Phrynichus, the commander of the Athenians, on the other <lb/>
            hand, when he had heard from Lerus a correct account of their <lb/>
            fleet, and when his colleagues wished to await its arrival and <lb/>
            give it battle, said that he would neither do so himself, nor, <lb/>
            to the best of his power, allow them or any one else to do it. <lb/>
            For when they might meet them hereafter with an accurate <lb/>
            knowledge of the number of ships on the enemy's side, and <lb/>
            with how many of their own opposed to them they would, after <lb/>
            adequate and calm preparations, be able to give them battle, <lb/>
            he would never run an unreasonable hazard through yielding <lb/>
            to the disgrace of reproach. For it was no disgrace for the <lb/>
            Athenians to retreat with a navy at a proper time; but in any <lb/>
            way whatever, the result would be more disgraceful should <lb/>
            they be defeated, and for the state to incur not only disgrace, <lb/>
            but also the greatest danger. For after its late misfortunes, <lb/>
            it was hardly expedient voluntarily for it to act on the offen­ <lb/>
            sive in any quarter, even with a force that could be relied up­ <lb/>
            on, or even in a case of absolute necessity : how then could it <lb/>
            without any such compulsion rush into self-chosen dangers ? <lb/>
            He ordered them therefore as quickly as possible to take up <lb/>
            Theirwounded, and their land forces, with such stores as they <lb/>
            had brought with them ; but to leave behind what they had <lb/>
            taken from the enemy's country, that their ships might be the <lb/>
            lighter, and to sail away to Samos, and thence, when they had <lb/>
            collected all their ships, to make their attacks upon them, <lb/>
            whenever they had an opportunity. Having given this ad <pb n="528"/>
            <note type="margin"> [28,29 </note> <lb/>
            vice, he acted accordingly; and so Phrynichus, not on that <lb/>
            immediate occasion more than on subsequent ones, nor in that <lb/>
            business only, but in all that he had any thing to do with. <lb/>
            proved himself to be a man of sound judgment. In this way, <lb/>
            with an incomplete victory, the Athenians immediately broke <lb/>
            up their camp, and retired from Miletus; and the Argives, <lb/>
            in mortification at their defeat, sailed off home from Samos as <lb/>
            quickly as they could.</p>
          <p>28. As soon as it was morning, the Peloponnesians weighed <lb/>
            anchor from Tichiussa, and put into Miletus after the enemy's <lb/>
            departure ; and after remaining one day, they took with them <lb/>
            on the next the Chian vessels which had, in the 1 first instance <lb/>
            been chased in company with Chalcideus, and were disposed <lb/>
            to sail back again for the stores which they had taken out of <lb/>
            their vessels at Tichiussa. On their arrival, Tissaphernes <lb/>
            came to them with his land forces, and persuaded them to sail <lb/>
            against Iasus, in which Amorges their enemy maintained <lb/>
            himself. Accordingly, having assaulted Iasus on a sudden, <lb/>
            and while the inhabitants thought nothing but that the ships <lb/>
            belonged to the Athenians, they took it; and the Syracusans <lb/>
            were most distinguished in the action. Amorges, who was a <lb/>
            natural son of Pissuthnes, and had revolted from the king, the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians took prisoner, and delivered him up to Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes to lead away to the king, if he pleased, according to <lb/>
            his orders. They then sacked Iasus ; and the army got <lb/>
            very large treasures, for the place was one of ancient <lb/>
            wealth. The mercenaries serving with Amorges they took to <lb/>
            themselves, and added to their ranks, without doing them any <lb/>
            harm, as most of them were from the Peloponnese: while <lb/>
            they delivered to Tissaphernes the town and all the captives, <lb/>
            both bond and free, for each one of whom they stipulated to <lb/>
            receive from him a Daric stater ; after which they returned to <lb/>
            Miletus. Pedaritus the son of Leon, who had been sent by <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians to take the command at Chios, they <lb/>
            despatched by land to Erythræ, with the mercenary force <lb/>
            taken from Amorges, and appointed Philippus to remain on <lb/>
            the spot, as governor of Miletus. And so the summer ended.</p>
          <p>29. The following winter, when Tissaphernes had put Iasus <lb/>
            into a state of defence, he passed on to Miletus, and distributed <lb/>
            amongst all the ships a month's pay, as he had undertaken at <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνκαταδιωχθείσας</foreign>.]See ch. 17. 3. </note> <pb n="529"/>

            Lscedæmon, at the rate of an Attic drachma a man per day, <lb/>
            but wished in future to give but three oboli, until he had con­ <lb/>
            sulted the king; should he, however, command it, he said he <lb/>
            would give them the full drachma. When Hermocrates, the <lb/>
            Syracusan commander, objected to this, (for Theramenes, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as he was not admiral, but only sailing with them to <lb/>
            deliver up the fleet to Astyochus, was easy on the subject of <lb/>
            pay,) there was fixed, notwithstanding, a sum [for the whole <lb/>
            fleet] larger 1by five ships than three oboli a man per day. For <lb/>
            he gave three talents a month for five ships, and to the rest, <lb/>
            according as they had vessels beyond this number, was given <lb/>
            in the same proportion.</p>
          <p>30. The same winter, more ships, to the number of thirty-five, <lb/>
            having come from home to join the Athenians at Samos, with <lb/>
            Charminus, Strombichides, and Euctemon in command, after <lb/>
            collecting those from Chios and all the rest, they determined, <lb/>
            having drawn lots for their respective services, to blockade <lb/>
            Miletus with their naval force, and to send against Chios both <lb/>
            a fleet and army. And they did so. For Strombichides, <lb/>
            Onomacles, and Euctemon, having with them thirty ships, and <lb/>
            taking in transports a part of the thousand heavy-armed that <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰπέντεναυ̃ς</foreign>.] If these words could really be interpreted " for <lb/>
            every five ships," as Goller and Arnold think, I should then agree with the <lb/>
            latter, that the whole passage might be allowed to remain as it stands at <lb/>
            present. But neither of them brings forward a single instance of Trapa being <lb/>
            thus used with the distributive force commonly expressed by Kara ; and in <lb/>
            the absence of all such proof, it seems safer to take the preposition, as Bloom­ <lb/>
            field has done, in a sense which is recognised by the grammarians. This <lb/>
            method renders necessary one of the two corrections which have been made <lb/>
            by the editors in the following sentence--either the omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶπεντή­ <lb/>
            κοντα</foreign>,or the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριάκονται</foreign>nstead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρία</foreign>—and though it is per­ <lb/>
            haps of little importance which is preferred, I have adopted the former, as <lb/>
            the mistake of the copyists in that case seems more easily accounted for than <lb/>
            in the other. See Göller's or Arnold note. With regard to the question, <lb/>
            why the ships should be taken in divisions of five, that number might per­ <lb/>
            haps have been fixed on for mere convenience, as the lowest which gave a <lb/>
            round sum in talents, without any fraction. Or may we conjecture that the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian government had sent out five ships on the expedition, and <lb/>
            that their quota was first considered by Tissaphernes, as a compliment to the <lb/>
            leading state ? Arnold's supposition that " it was intended to exclude any <lb/>
            state from the higher rate of pay, whose contingent fell short of five ships, <lb/>
            in order to encourage the allies to greater exertions," does not seem very <lb/>
            probable ; and the idea of <foreign xml:lang="grc">το</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ςἄλλοις</foreign>referring " to those other states who <lb/>
            had noships at the present moment afloat, but who might at any instant <lb/>
            be supposed ready to send some," is surely inconsistent with the indicative <lb/>
            mood of the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦσαν</foreign>,which can only refer to such as were actually afoot <lb/>
            at the time of the arrangement. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2X </note> <pb n="530"/>

            had come to Miletus, sailed, according to their lot, against Chios, <lb/>
            while the rest, remaining at Samos with seventy-four ships, <lb/>
            secured the command of the sea, and advanced upon Miletus.</p>
          <p>31. Astyochus, happening at that time to be collecting at <lb/>
            Chios the hostages taken in consequence of the conspiracy, <lb/>
            ceased from that, when he found that the ships with Thera­ <lb/>
            menes were come, and that the affairs of the confederacy were <lb/>
            more prosperous. And taking a squadron consisting of ten <lb/>
            Peloponnesian and as many Chian ships, he put out to sea, <lb/>
            and after attacking Pteleum without taking it, coasted along <lb/>
            to Clazomenæ, and commanded those of them who favoured <lb/>
            the Athenian cause to remove inland to Daphnus, and to join <lb/>
            their party. Tamos also, who was lieutenant-governor of <lb/>
            Ionia, united in this command. When they did not listen to <lb/>
            it, he made an attack on the town, which was unwalled, and <lb/>
            not being able to take it, sailed away before a strong gale <lb/>
            himself to Phocæa and Cuma, while the rest of the ships put <lb/>
            into the islands adjacent to Clazomenæ, namely, Marathussa <lb/>
            Pole, and Drymussa. Having staid there on account of the <lb/>
            winds eight days, all the property of the Clazomenians that <lb/>
            had been 1 secretly stowed away there, they partly ravaged <lb/>
            and consumed, and partly put on board their ships; and then <lb/>
            sailed off to Phocæa and Cuma, to join Astyochus.</p>
          <p>32. While he was there, ambassadors from the Lesbians <lb/>
            came to him, wishing to revolt again. And as far as he was <lb/>
            concerned, they gained his assent; but when the Corinthians <lb/>
            and other allies were not zealous for it, in consequence of their <lb/>
            former failure, he weighed anchor and sailed for Chios; at <lb/>
            which place, after his ships had been dispersed in a storm, <lb/>
            they arrived from different directions. After this, Pedaritus, <lb/>
            who when we last mentioned him was moving along the coast <lb/>
            by land from Miletus, arrived at Erythræ, and then passed <lb/>
            over, himself and his forces, to Chios; where he had also <lb/>
            about five hundred soldiers who had been 2left by Chalcideus <lb/>

              bians made offers of revolt, Astyochus urged to Pt daritus and <lb/>
              the Chians, that they ought to go with their ships, and effect <lb/>
              the revolt of Lesbos ; for so they would either themselves gain <lb/>
              an addition to the number of their allies, or, in case of failure, <lb/>
              would still do the Athenians mischief. They, however, did <lb/>
              not listen to them, and Pedaritus refused to give up to him <lb/>
              the ships of the Chians.</p>
          <p>33. He, therefore, taking the five of the Corinthians, a <lb/>
            sixth from Megara, one from Hermione, and those of the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians which he had come with, sailed for Miletus, to <lb/>
            take the command as admiral, after many threats to the <lb/>
            Chians that assuredly he would not come to their aid, should <lb/>
            they be in any need of it. Having touched at Corycus, in <lb/>
            the Erythræan country, he staid there the night. The <lb/>
            Athenians also, on their passage from Samos to Chios with <lb/>
            their troops, were only parted from them by being on the <lb/>
            other side of a hill; and so they brought to for the night, and <lb/>
            escaped each other's notice. On the arrival of a letter from <lb/>
            Pedaritus in the night, to say that some Erythraean prisoners, <lb/>
            after being set at liberty, had come from Samos to Erythræa <lb/>
            for the purpose of betraying it, Astyochus immediately <lb/>
            weighed anchor again for Erythræa: within so little was he of <lb/>
            falling in with the Athenians. Pedaritus also sailed across to <lb/>
            join him; and having investigated the case of the men who <lb/>
            were thought to be traitors, when they found that the whole <lb/>
            story had been made up in order to effect the escape of the <lb/>
            men from Samos, they acquitted them of the charge, and <lb/>
            sailed away, one to Chios, the other to Miletus, as he had <lb/>
            intended.</p>
          <p>34. In the mean time also the army of the Athenians, <lb/>
            while sailing round with the ships from Corycus, met with <lb/>
            three Chian vessels of war off Arginus, and on seeing them <lb/>
            gave them chase ; when a violent storm came on, and the Chian <lb/>
            ships with difficulty took refuge in the harbour. Of the <lb/>
            Athenians, the three which had pursued most vigorously were <lb/>
            wrecked, and thrown up near the city of Chios, the men boing <lb/>
            either taken prisoners or slain; while the remainder took <lb/>
            refuge in the harbour under Mount Mimas, called Phœnicus, <lb/>
            from whence they afterwards came to anchor in the port of <lb/>
            Lesbos, and made preparations for the work 1 of fortification. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὸν τειχισμόν</foreign>,] i. e. for the fortification of Delphinium. See ch. 38. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 M 2 </note> <pb n="532"/>

          <p>35. The same winter, Hippocrates the Lacedæmonian, <lb/>
            having sailed from the Peloponnese with ten Thurian ships, <lb/>
            under the command of Dorieus son of Diagoras, and two col­ <lb/>
            leagues, one Laconian and one Syracusan, sailed into port at <lb/>
            Cnidus, which had now revolted at the instigation of Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes. When those at Miletus received intelligence of them, <lb/>
            they gave orders for half of the vessels to keep guard at <lb/>
            Cnidus, and the other half to cruise around Triopium, and <lb/>
            seize the merchantmen that were approaching from Egypt. <lb/>
            This Triopium is a promontory running out from the Cnidian <lb/>
            territory, and is consecrated to Apollo. But the Atlienians, <lb/>
            having had notice of it, and having sailed out from Samos, <lb/>
            seized the six ships that were keeping guard at Triopium, <lb/>
            though the crews escaped from them. After this they put in <lb/>
            at Cnidus, and having assaulted the city, which was unforti­ <lb/>
            fled, were within a little of taking it. The next day they made <lb/>
            a second assault on it; but as they did not now do it so much <lb/>
            damage, since the inhabitants had provided better defences <lb/>
            during the night, and the crews which had escaped from the <lb/>
            ships at Triopium had gone in to join them, they withdrew, <lb/>
            and after ravaging the territory of the Cnidians, sailed back <lb/>
            to Samoa.</p>
          <p>36. Astyochus having come about the same time to the fleet <lb/>
            at Miletus, the Peloponnesians were still abundantly supplied <lb/>
            with every thing in their camp. For pay was given them to <lb/>
            a sufficiently large amount, and the great sum of money which <lb/>
            had been raised from the plunder of Iasus was still at the <lb/>
            command of the soldiers, and the Milesians carried on the war <lb/>
            with spirit. Nevertheless the Peloponnesians considered that <lb/>
            the first convention with Tissaphernes, which had been con­ <lb/>
            cluded by Chalcideus, was defective, and not so much for their <lb/>
            advantage [as for his] ; and, consequently, while Theramenes <lb/>
            was yet there, they concluded another, which was to the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing effect:</p>
          <p>37. " The convention of the Lacedæmonians and the allies <lb/>
            with King Darius, the sons of the king, and Tissaphernes, that <lb/>
            there should be a treaty and friendship between them on these <lb/>
            terms: Whatever territory and cities belong to King Darius, or <lb/>
            did belong to his father, or his ancestors, against these neither <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians nor the allies of the Lacedæmonians shall be <lb/>
            permitted to proceed for the purpose of war, or for any harm: <pb n="533"/>
            <note type="margin"> 88] </note> <lb/>
            neither shall the Lacedæmonians, nor their confederates, ex­ <lb/>
            act tribute from these cities. Neither shall King Darius or <lb/>
            any states in the king's dominions, be allowed to proceed <lb/>
            against the Lacedæmonians, or their allies, for the purpose of <lb/>
            war or other injury.Should the Lacedæmonians, or their <lb/>
            allies, require any assistance from the king, or the king stand <lb/>
            in need of any from the Lacedæmonians, or their allies ; to <lb/>
            whatever they may gain each other's assent, that shall be right <lb/>
            for them to do.Both parties shall carry on in common <lb/>
            the war against the Athenians and their allies; and should <lb/>
            they come to terms of peace, they shall both do so in common. <lb/>
            -Whatever troops shall be in the king's country in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the king's having sent for them, the king shall pay <lb/>
            their expenses.Should any of the states which have <lb/>
            concluded this convention with the king proceed against the <lb/>
            king's country, the rest shall prevent it, and assist the king to <lb/>
            the utmost of their power. And should any of those in the <lb/>
            king's country, or in all his dominions, proceed against the <lb/>
            country of the Lacedæmonians, or of their allies, the king shall <lb/>
            prevent it, and assist them to the utmost of his power."</p>
          <p>38. After this convention Theramenes gave up the fleet to <lb/>
            Astyochus, and sailing away in a small boat was 1 lost at sea. <lb/>
            The Athenians, having now crossed over from Lesbos to Chios <lb/>
            with their army, and commanding both land and sea, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to fortify Delphinium, a place that was both naturally <lb/>
            strong on the land side, contained several harbours, and was <lb/>
            not far from the city of Chios. Now the Chians having been <lb/>
            beaten in several previous engagements, and not being on very <lb/>
            good terms amongst themselves, but regarding each other with <lb/>
            suspicion, because Tydeus, son of Ion, and his party had al­ <lb/>
            ready been executed by Pedaritus on the charge of Atticism, <lb/>
            and the rest of the city was by compulsion reduced to an <lb/>
            oligarchy; in consequence of these things they kept quiet, and <lb/>
            thought neither themselves nor the mercenaries under Pedari­ <lb/>
            tus to be a match for the enemy. They sent, however, to <lb/>
            Miletus, urging Astyochus to come to their aid: and when he <lb/>
            did not listen to them, Pedaritus sent a letter to Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            representing him as being guilty of a misdemeanor. On this <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφανίζεται</foreign>.] Or, as others render it, " disappeared from the scene of <lb/>
            faction : " but Bishop Thirlwall's interpretation of the word seems undoubt­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [39, 40 </note> <lb/>
            footing stood the affairs of the Athenians at Chios: while from <lb/>
            Samoa their ships kept sailing out against those at Miletus, <lb/>
            and when they did not advance to meet them, they returned <lb/>
            again to Samoa, and remained quiet.</p>
          <p>39. The same winter, the seven and thirty ships which <lb/>
            had been equipped by the Lacedaemonians for Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            through the instrumentality of Calligitus the Megarean and <lb/>
            Timagoras the Cyzicene, put out from the Peloponnese, and <lb/>
            sailed for Ionia, about the period of the solstice, Antisthenes a <lb/>
            Spartan being on board in command of them. The Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians also sent eleven Spartans as assistant counsellors <lb/>
            for Astyochus, one of whom was Lichas, the son of Arcesilaus. <lb/>
            They were instructed on their arrival at Miletus to co-operate <lb/>
            in the arrangement of all other affairs, as should be best, and <lb/>
            to despatch these vessels-either just the number, more, or <lb/>
            fewer-to the Hellespont to join Pharnabazus, should they <lb/>
            think proper, appointing to the command of them Clearchus <lb/>
            the son of Ramphias, who sailed out with them; and also, if <lb/>
            the eleven commissioners deemed fit, to depose Astyochus <lb/>
            from the office of admiral, and appoint Antisthenes; for they <lb/>
            were suspicious of him in consequence of the letters from <lb/>
            Pedaritus. Sailing therefore from Malea across the open sea <lb/>
            the squadron touched at Melos, and there falling in with ten <lb/>
            Athenian ships took three of them empty, and burnt them. <lb/>
            After this, being afraid that those of the Athenian vessels <lb/>
            which had escaped from Melos might (as was the case) give <lb/>
            information of their approach to those at Samos, they sailed <lb/>
            to Crete, and having made their voyage longer by taking this <lb/>
            precaution, they made the land at Caunus, in Asia; from <lb/>
            which place, considering themselves to be now in safety, they <lb/>
            sent a message to the ships at Miletus, in order to be convoyed <lb/>
            by them along the coast.</p>
          <p>40. At this same time the Chians and Pedaritus sent <lb/>
            messengers to Astyochus, notwithstanding his holding back, <lb/>
            and begged him to succour them in their siege with all his <lb/>
            fleet, and not to permit the largest of the allied cities in Ionia <lb/>
            to be both excluded from the use of the sea, and wasted by <lb/>
            forays on the land. For the slaves of the Chians being <lb/>
            numerous, and indeed forming the largest body there was in <lb/>
            any one city, except that of the Lacedæmonians, and at the <lb/>
            same time being, in consequence of their great numbers, pun- <pb n="535"/>
            <note type="margin"> 41.] <lb/>
            </note>ished more severely than usual in cases of offence, when the <lb/>
            Athenian army appeared to be firmly established, with the <lb/>
            advantage of a fortified position, the greater part deserted to <lb/>
            them ; and these did the most mischief to the country, through <lb/>
            their acquaintance with it. The Chians therefore represented, <lb/>
            that while there was still a hope and possibility of stopping <lb/>
            them, while Delphinium was still being fortified, and not yet <lb/>
            completed, and a higher wall was being erected round their <lb/>
            camp and the ships, it was incumbent on him to assist them. <lb/>
            And although Astyochus, because of his threat on the occa­ <lb/>
            sion already mentioned, had not intended to do it, when he saw <lb/>
            that the allies also were anxious for their relief, he set out to <lb/>
            succour them.</p>
          <p>41. In the mean time tidings came from Caunus that the <lb/>
            seven and twenty ships, with the Lacedæmonian counsellors, <lb/>
            were come. And thinking every thing else of secondary im­ <lb/>
            portance, compared with his convoying so large a number of <lb/>
            ships, in order that they might more entirely command the <lb/>
            sea, and with the safe passage of the Lacedæmonians who had <lb/>
            come to observe his conduct, he immediately gave up going to <lb/>
            the relief of Chios, and sailed to Caunus. Having landed, <lb/>
            as he coasted along, at 1 Cos Meropis, which was unfortified, <lb/>
            and in ruins in consequence of an earthquake which they <lb/>
            had experienced-the most violent one which I ever re­ <lb/>
            member- he sacked the town, the men having fled to <lb/>
            the mountains, and by incursions made spoil of the country, <lb/>
            excepting the free population, whom he released. Having <lb/>
            come from Cos to Cnidus by night, he was constrained by the <lb/>
            advice of the Cnidians not to land his seamen, but to sail, just <lb/>
            as he was, straightway against the twenty Athenian ships with <lb/>
            which Charminus, one of the generals at Samos, was on the <lb/>
            look-out for those seven and twenty ships that were approach­ <lb/>
            ing from the Peloponnese, and to join which Astyochus also <lb/>
            was coasting along. For those at Samos had heard from Melos <lb/>
            of their approach, and Charminus was watching for them about <lb/>
            Syme, Chalce, Rhodes, and Lycia; as by this time he was <lb/>
            aware of their being at Caunus. <note type="footnote"> 1 Kwv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν Μεροπίδα</foreign>.] " According to the old mythical language, ' Cos <lb/>
            first settled by the hero Merops.' See Stephan., Byzant., Hesychius, &amp;c. <lb/>
            According to the interpretation now given to this language, ' Cos first set <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [42, 43. </note> </p>
          <p>42. Astyochus therefore sailed immediately to Syme, before <lb/>
            he was heard of, on the chance of finding the ships some where <lb/>
            out at sea. But the rain and the cloudy state of the atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere which he encountered caused the dispersion of his ships <lb/>
            during the dark, and threw them into confusion. In the morn­ <lb/>
            ing, when his fleet had been separated, and the left wing was <lb/>
            now in sight of the Athenians, while the rest of it was <lb/>
            still dispersed around the island, Charminus and the Athenians <lb/>
            put out against it with all speed, with fewer than their twenty <lb/>
            ships, thinking that these were the vessels they were watching <lb/>
            for, namely, those from Caunus. Having attacked them there­ <lb/>
            fore immediately, they sank three, and severely damaged some <lb/>
            others, and had the advantage in the action, until the larger <lb/>
            division of the fleet unexpectedly came in sight, and they were <lb/>
            surrounded on every side. Then they took to flight, and having <lb/>
            lost six ships, fled for refuge with the rest to the island of <lb/>
            Teutlussa, and thence to Halicarnassus. After this the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians put into Cnidus, and the seven and twenty ships <lb/>
            from Caunus having effected a junction with them, they sailed <lb/>
            with the whole number, and erected a trophy on Syme, and <lb/>
            then came to anchor again at Cnidus.</p>
          <p>43. The Athenians, on hearing the particulars of the en­ <lb/>
            gagement, having sailed with all their ships from Samos to <lb/>
            Syme, made no attack on the fleet at Cnidus, or that on them, <lb/>
            but took their 1 naval stores, which were at Syme, and after <lb/>
            touching at Lorymi on the continent, sailed back to Samos. <lb/>
            And now all the Peloponnesian ships at Cnidus were refitted, <lb/>
            so far as they required it; and the eleven Lacedæmonian com­ <lb/>
            missioners held a conference with Tissaphernes, (for he had <lb/>
            come to meet them,) both respecting what had already been <lb/>
            done, if there was aught that did not please them, and with <lb/>
            reference to future hostilities, in what way they might be <lb/>
            conducted most to the benefit and advantage of both parties. <lb/>
            Lichas, more especially, kept an eye on the transactions, and <lb/>
            said, " that neither of the two treaties was properly drawn up, <lb/>
            either that of Chalcideus, nor that of Theramenes, but it <lb/>

            be master of all the country over which he and his ancestors <lb/>
            had formerly had dominion. For in that was involved the <lb/>
            re-subjugation of all the islands, with Thessaly, Locris, and <lb/>
            as far as Boeotia; and so, instead of freedom, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians would be putting the Median yoke on the Greeks. <lb/>
            He told them therefore to conclude another and a better treaty, <lb/>
            or at any rate they would not act according to this; nor did <lb/>
            they want any of his supplies on these terms. But Tissa­ <lb/>

          <p>44. They, in consequence of communications from some of <lb/>
            the most powerful men there, were disposed to sail to Rhodes ; <lb/>
            hoping to bring over to their side an island which was strong <lb/>
            both in its number of seamen and its land forces ; and moreover <lb/>
            thinking that they should themselves be able to maintain their <lb/>
            fleet from their own confederacy, without asking Tissaphernes <lb/>
            for money. Having sailed therefore immediately, that same <lb/>
            winter, from Cnidus, and having first put in with ninety-four <lb/>
            ships to Camirus in the Rhodian territory, they frightened <lb/>
            away most of the inhabitants, who were not aware of their in­ <lb/>
            tentions, and therefore fled, especially as the town was un­ <lb/>
            fortified. Then, having assembled both these and the people <lb/>
            from the two other towns, Lindus and Ialysus, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians prevailed on the Rhodians to revolt from the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans. And so Rhodes joined the Peloponnesian confederacy. <lb/>
            The Athenians, having got notice of it, sailed at this time with <lb/>
            their ships from Samos, wishing to anticipate them, and came <lb/>
            within sight of the island as they lay out at sea ; but being a <lb/>
            little too late, they sailed back in the first instance to Chalce, <lb/>
            thence to Samos, and afterwards carried on the war against <lb/>
            Rhodes by attacks from Chalce, Cos, and Samos. The Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians levied money from the Rhodians to the amount of <lb/>
            two and thirty talents; but in other respects lay still for <lb/>
            eighty days, having drawn up the ships on shore.</p>
          <p>45. In the mean time, and at even a still earlier period, be­ <lb/>
            fore they removed to Rhodes, the following negotiations were <lb/>
            being carried on. Alcibiades being suspected by the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians after the death of Chalcideus and the battle of Miletus, <lb/>
            and instructions having been sent by them from Lacedæmon <lb/>
            to Astyochus to put him to death, (for he was a personal <lb/>
            enemy of Agis, and in other ways appeared to be unworthy of <pb n="538"/>
             <note type="margin">[46. </note> <lb/>
            trust,) he first retired in alarm to the. court of Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            and then did the greatest harm he could to the cause of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians with him. Being his adviser on all points, he <lb/>
            cut down the pay, so that instead of an Attic drachma three <lb/>
            oboli were given, and that not regularly; telling Tissaphernes <lb/>
            to represent to them, that the Athenians, who for a longer <lb/>
            time had had experience in naval matters, gave their men but <lb/>
            three oboli; not so much from poverty, as that their seamen <lb/>
            might not grow insolent from abundance, and either be less <lb/>
            able-bodied, through spending money on such things as pro­ <lb/>
            duce weakness, or desert their ships by means of leaving their <lb/>
            arrears of pay as a 1 security for them. He also gave him such <lb/>
            instructions, that by giving money he persuaded the trierarchs <lb/>
            and generals of the different states to concede these points to <lb/>
            him; excepting the Syracusans; but of these Hermocrates <lb/>
            alone opposed him on behalf of the whole confederacy. The <lb/>
            states, too, which applied for money he dismissed with an <lb/>
            answer from himself, on the part of Tissaphernes, alleging by <lb/>
            way of refusal, that “the Chians were shameless, who, <lb/>
            though the wealthiest of the Greeks, and being protected as <lb/>
            they were by the aid they were receiving, expected others to <lb/>
            risk both their persons and their purses for their liberty." <lb/>
            With regard to the rest of the states, which used before their <lb/>
            revolt to lavish their money on the Athenians, he said that <lb/>
            they were wrong if they would not now also contribute as <lb/>
            much, or even more, for their own interests. He also repre­ <lb/>
            sented that Tissaphernes was naturally sparing at present, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as he was carrying on the war with his own resources ; <lb/>
            but that if supplies should ever come down from the king, he <lb/>
            would give them their full pay, and afford the states all proper <lb/>
            relief.</p>
          <p>46. He likewise advised Tissaphernes " not to be in too great <lb/>
            a hurry to bring the war to a conclusion; nor to be anxious, <lb/>
            by either bringing the Phœnician fleet which he was equip­ <lb/>
            ping, or giving pay to a larger body of Greeks, to confer on <lb/>
            the same party the command both of land and sea; but to let <lb/>
            them each hold a divided sway, and so leave the king the <note type="footnote"> ' is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμηρείαν</foreign>.] That is, that the larger pay was considered as a security <lb/>
            for the men's returning to their post, when summoned, and therefore as a <lb/>
            reason for greater indulgence in granting leave of absence than was proved <lb/>
            by the result to be consistent with the inteiests of the service. </note> <pb n="539"/>

            </note>power at all times to lead the one party or the other against <lb/>
            those who were annoying him. If, on the contrary, the <lb/>
            command both by land and sea were united, he would be at a <lb/>
            loss for any party to assist in overthrowing the stronger ; un­ <lb/>
            less he should himself ever choose to arise and carry out the <lb/>
            contest with them at a great expense and hazard. It was a <lb/>
            cheaper risk to wear down the Greeks against each other, at <lb/>
            a trifling share of the expense, and at the same time with <lb/>
            security to himself. And the Athenians, he said, were a more <lb/>
            desirable people to share the empire with him ; for they were <lb/>
            less desirous of possessions on shore, and carried on the war <lb/>
            with both a profession and a practice most advantageous to <lb/>
            him ; as they would unite with him in subjugating, as far as <lb/>
            the sea was concerned, to themselves and to him all the <lb/>
            Greeks who lived in the king's country ; while the other party, <lb/>
            on the contrary, had come to liberate them. Nor was it likely <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians should at the present time be liber­ <lb/>
            ating the Greeks from men of their own Grecian race, and <lb/>
            should omit to liberate them from those who were barbarians; <lb/>
            1 unless they should ever fail in reducing the Athenians. He <lb/>
            urged them therefore to wear them both out at first, and after <lb/>
            cutting off as much as possible from the power of the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, then to get rid of the Peloponnesians from his coun­ <lb/>
            try." Tissaphernes adopted these views in the main, so far at <lb/>
            least as might be conjectured from his actions. For having <lb/>
            on this account placed himself in the confidence of Alcibiades, <lb/>
            as of one who had given him good advice on the subject, he <lb/>
            both scantily supplied the Peloponnesians with money, and <lb/>
            would not allow them to fight by sea; but by telling them <lb/>
            that the Phoenician fleet should come to them, and that so <lb/>
            they should contend with superabundant strength, he greatly <lb/>
            injured their cause, and took off the vigour of their navy, <lb/>
            which had been very great; and in all other respects, too evi­ <lb/>
            dently to escape observation, he wanted hearty zeal in co­ <lb/>
            operating with them.</p>
          <p>47. Alcibiades gave this advice to Tissaphernes and the <lb/>
            king, whilst he was with them, both because he thought it <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢν</foreign> An <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτε αὐτούς</foreign>, K. T. X.] I have followed Haack's and Poppo's in­ <lb/>

            best for them, and, at the same time, because he was further <lb/>
            providing for his own restoration to his country; knowing <lb/>
            that if he did not bring it to ruin, he would some time or other <lb/>
            have means of persuading his countrymen, and returning to it. <lb/>
            But the way in which he thought he should persuade them most <lb/>
            easily was this, namely, by Tissaphernes' appearing to be in <lb/>
            his interest. And so it turned out; for when the Athenian <lb/>
            soldiers at Samos found that he had great influence with him, <lb/>
            [the plan was adopted,] to a certain extent, in consequence of <lb/>
            Alcibiades having sent word to the most powerful individuals <lb/>
            amongst them, to let it be mentioned to the most respectable <lb/>
            people, that he wished to return home on condition of there <lb/>
            being an oligarchy, and not that unprincipled democracy which <lb/>
            had banished him ; and after making Tissaphernes their friend, <lb/>
            to enjoy his privileges as a citizen with them : but, at the same <lb/>
            time, the trierarchs and the most influential Athenians at <lb/>
            Samos were of themselves still more eager for abolishing the <lb/>
            democracy.</p>
          <p>48. This design therefore was first mooted in the camp, and <lb/>
            thence spread to the city. Accordingly, certain individuals <lb/>
            went over from Samos, and had an interview with Alcibi­ <lb/>
            ades ; and when he held out that he would first make Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes their friend, and then the king, in case they were not <lb/>
            under a democratical government, (for so the king would place <lb/>
            greater reliance on them,) the aristocratical party amongst the <lb/>
            citizens, who also suffered most at present, entertained many <lb/>
            hopes of getting the government into their own hands, as well <lb/>
            as of gaining the victory over the enemy. Accordingly they <lb/>
            went to Samos, and united in a club such men as favoured <lb/>
            their views, openly representing to the people at large that the <lb/>
            king would be their friend, and supply them with money, if <lb/>
            Alcibiades were restored, and they were not governed by a <lb/>
            democracy. The multitude, though annoyed to a certain <lb/>
            extent by these negotiations, remained quiet because of <lb/>
            their abundant hopes of pay from the king ; while those <lb/>
            who were for establishing the oligarchy, after they had com­ <lb/>
            municated their designs to the mass of the people, again con­ <lb/>
            sidered the proposals of Alcibiades 1 amongst themselves and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ σφίσιν αὐτοι̃ς</foreign>, K. T. X.] Dobree, Göller, Poppo, and Arnold, agree <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> 48.] <lb/>
            </note>the greater part of their associates. To the rest, then, they <lb/>
            appeared advantageous and worthy of their confidence ; but <lb/>
            Phrynichus, who was still general, was not at all pleased with <lb/>
            them, but thought that Alcibiades (as was really the case) had <lb/>
            no more desire for an oligarchy than for a democracy, or con­ <lb/>
            sidered any thing else but how, by bringing the state to change <lb/>
            its present constitution, he might obtain his recall by the in­ <lb/>
            vitation of his associates. " What they themselves, however, <lb/>
            should most especially look to, was," he said, " to avoid being <lb/>
            rent by factions. That it was not for the king's advantage, <lb/>
            when the Peloponnesians were now on an equality at sea, and <lb/>
            held none of the least cities in his dominion, to incur trouble <lb/>
            by siding with the Athenians, whom he did not trust, when <lb/>
            he might have made the Peloponnesians his friends, by whom <lb/>
            he had never yet been injured. As for the allied states, again, <lb/>
            to whom, forsooth, they had promised an oligarchy, because <lb/>
            they themselves also would cease to be under a democracy, he <lb/>
            well knew that neither those which had revolted would any <lb/>
            the more on that account come over to them, nor those that <lb/>
            were left be more staunch to them; for they would not wish <lb/>
            to be slaves with either an oligarchy or a democracy, rather <lb/>
            than to be free, under whichever of those two forms of govern <lb/>
            ment they might obtain their liberty. And with regard to the <lb/>
            respectable classes, as they were called, they considered that <lb/>
            the oligarchs would not cause them less trouble than the <lb/>
            popular government, being as they were the authors and in­ <note type="footnote">a " dativus instrumenti " ? which is certainly used sometimes with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to persons, though less commonly than to things. One instance of it is <lb/>
            given by Jelf, Gr. Gr. § 608, Obs. 3, from Soph. El. 226, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίνι</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂν, <lb/>

            another undoubted instance from Eur. Heracl. 392, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂνδρα γὰρ χρεὼν -οὐκ <lb/>

            Cyrop. One instance may also, I think, be quoted from Thucydides <lb/>
            himself, though I am not aware that it ever has, viz. VIII. 82. 3, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνέαινε</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              same construction should not have been used here. If this be admitted, I <lb/>
              would apply the same principle to two other passages of our author, of which <lb/>
              I have before taken a different view, viz. I. 25, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτε ἦ Κοϱινθίῳ ἀνδϱι</foreign> irpotcaT­ <lb/>

              παϱαινου̃σιν</foreign>. With regard to the former, when I wrote the note on it, I <lb/>
              had not seen the quotation with which Poppo corroborates Bloomfield's in­ <lb/>
              terpretation, and which puts it beyond a doubt, I think, that Arrian, at any <lb/>
              rate, took the same view of it. </note> <pb n="542"/>

              troducers of projects which were evil for the people, and from <lb/>
              which they themselves derived most benefit. Indeed as far as <lb/>
              depended on them, they would be put to death without trial, <lb/>
              and even by measures of violence; whereas the commons were <lb/>
              their refuge, and the moderators of the other party. And <lb/>
              as the states had learnt these things from positive facts, he <lb/>
              well knew that such was their opinion on the subject. For <lb/>
              himself, then, he was pleased with none of the schemes carried <lb/>
              on by Alcibiades at present, as before."</p>
          <p>49. But those members of the association who had as­ <lb/>
            sembled acceded to the present proposals, as they had at first <lb/>
            determined, and prepared to send Pisander and some others on <lb/>
            an embassy to Athens, to treat for the return of Alcibiades <lb/>
            and the abolition of the democracy in that city, and so to gain <lb/>
            the friendship of Tissaphernes for the Athenians.</p>
          <p>50. But when Phrynichus saw that there would be a pro­ <lb/>
            posal for the recall of Alcibiades, and that the Athenians <lb/>
            would accede to it, being afraid, on considering the opposite <lb/>
            tendency of what had been maintained by himself, that if he <lb/>
            were restored he would do him some mischief, as one who had <lb/>
            impeded his plans, he had recourse to the following device. He <lb/>
            sent to Astvochus the Lacedæmonian admiral, who was still in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Miletus, with secret instructions that <lb/>
            Alcibiades was ruining their cause by bringing Tissaphernes <lb/>
            into friendship with the Athenians; expressly mentioning all <lb/>
            the other matters also, and pleading that it was pardonable <lb/>
            in him to devise evil against a man who was an enemy, even <lb/>
            though it were to the detriment of the state. Now Astyochus <lb/>
            did not so much as think of punishing Alcibiades—especially <lb/>
            as he no longer put himself in his power as he used to do-but <lb/>
            having gone up to him and Tissaphernes at Magnesia, at once <lb/>
            told them the contents of the letter from Samos, acting as an <lb/>
            informer to them, and for his own private gain devoting him­ <lb/>
            self, as was said, to the interest of Tissaphernes both on these <lb/>
            and on all other matters: for which reason also he was the more <lb/>
            gentle in remonstrating with him respecting the pay not being <lb/>
            given in full. Alcibiades immediately sent a letter to Samoa <lb/>
            giving information against Phrynichus to the authorities there, <lb/>
            telling them what he had done, and requiring that he should <lb/>
            be put to death. Phrynichus, being confounded and in the <lb/>
            most extreme danger, sent again to Astyochus, reproaching <pb n="543"/>
            <note type="margin"> 51,52.] </note> <lb/>
            him because his former information had not been duly kept <lb/>
            secret, and telling him now that he was prepared to give them <lb/>
            an opportunity of destroying the whole Athenian armament at <lb/>
            Samos; describing the particulars of the way in which he <lb/>
            could do it, as Samos was unfortified ; and pleading that it was <lb/>
            not now culpable in him, being, as he was, in danger of his life <lb/>
            through them, to do this, or any thing else, rather than <lb/>
            be destroyed by his bitterest enemies. Astyochus gave in­ <lb/>
            formation of this also to Alcibiades.</p>
          <p>51. Now when Phrynichus had discovered beforehand that <lb/>
            he was doing him injury, and that a letter from Alcibiades on <lb/>
            the subject was on the point of arriving, he himself anticipated <lb/>
            it by announcing to the army, that as Samos was unfortified, <lb/>
            and all the ships were not stationed within the harbour, the <lb/>
            enemy intended to attack the camp: that he had certain in­ <lb/>
            telligence of this, and that they ought as quickly as possible to <lb/>
            fortify Samos and put every thing else in a state of defence. <lb/>
            Now he was himself general, and so had full authority to carry <lb/>
            out these measures. Accordingly they prepared for the work <lb/>
            of fortification; and owing to this Samos was the more <lb/>
            quickly walled, though it would have been so under any cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. Not long after came the letters from Alcibiades, <lb/>
            saying that the army was going to be betrayed by Phryni­ <lb/>
            chus, and that the enemy were on the point of attacking them. <lb/>
            As, however, Alcibiades was not thought to be worthy of <lb/>
            credit, but to have had a previous acquaintance with the plans <lb/>
            of the enemy, and through personal dislike to have attributed <lb/>
            them to Phrynichus, as though he were privy to them, he did <lb/>
            him no harm, but rather bore witness to his statement by <lb/>
            sending this intelligence.</p>
          <p>52. After this, Alcibiades tried to bring over and persuade <lb/>
            Tissaphernes to the friendship of the Athenians ; and he, <lb/>
            though afraid of the Peloponnesians, because they were there <lb/>
            with more ships than the Athenians, was still disposed to be <lb/>
            convinced by him, if by any means he could; especially since <lb/>
            he had observed the dissatisfaction of the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            which had been expressed at Cnidus about the treaty of <lb/>
            Theramenes, (for as at this time they 1were at Rhodes, it had <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤδη γὰρ-ἐγεγένητο</foreign>.] " That is to say, the quarrel had taken place at <lb/>
            Cnidus, (ch, 43. 2—4,) and from Cnidus the Peloponnesians had moved to <lb/>
            Rhodes, (ch. 44.1,) therefore as the Peloponnesians were arrived at Rhode* </note><pb n="544"/>
            <note type="margin"> [53. </note> <lb/>
            already occurred,) in the course of which Lichas had verified <lb/>
            the observation which had before been made by Alcibiades <lb/>
            about the Lacedæmonians liberating all the states, when he <lb/>
            said that it was an intolerable agreement that the king should <lb/>
            be master of the cities over which, at any earlier period, either <lb/>
            himself or his fathers had had dominion. Alcibiades then, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as he was struggling for a great object, was earnestly <lb/>
            courting and soliciting Tissaphernes.</p>
          <p>53. The Athenian ambassadors, on the other hand, who had <lb/>
            been sent from Samos with Pisander, on their arrival at Athens, <lb/>
            delivered an address before the people, giving a summary of <lb/>
            many arguments, but most especially urging, that by recalling <lb/>
            Alcibiades, and not being under a democratical government in <lb/>
            the same manner as hitherto, they might both have the king <lb/>
            for an ally, and gain the victory over the Peloponnesians. <lb/>
            When many others opposed them on the subject of the de­ <lb/>
            mocracy, and the enemies of. Alcibiades at the same time <lb/>
            exclaimed, that it was a shameful thing if he were to return <lb/>
            by doing violence to the laws ; and the Eumolpidæ and Ceryces <lb/>
            adjured them with regard to the mysteries, for which he had <lb/>
            been banished, and appealed to the gods against their restoring <lb/>
            him ; Pisander came forward in the face of much opposition <lb/>
            and indignant protesting, and taking aside each one of his <lb/>
            opponents, asked him whether lie had any hope of preserva­ <lb/>
            tion for the state, since the Peloponnesians had no fewer ships <lb/>
            than themselves opposed to them on the sea, and more cities <lb/>
            in alliance with them, while the king and Tissaphernes sup­ <lb/>
            plied them with money ; whereas they themselves had no <lb/>
            longer any, unless some one should persuade the king to come <lb/>
            over to their side. When, on being thus questioned, they al­ <lb/>
            lowed that they had not, he then said to them plainly, " This <lb/>
            advantage, then, cannot be attained by us, if we do not adopt <lb/>
            a more temperate policy, and put the offices into the hands of <lb/>
            a smaller number, that the king may place confidence in us- <lb/>
            (and that we may not consult so much at present about a form <lb/>
            of government as about the preservation of the state; for we <lb/>
            shall have power to alter hereafter whatever may not please <note type="footnote"> when Alcibiades made his application to Tissaphernes, it was perfectly <lb/>
            possible for Tissaphernes to be influenced in his reception of the proposals <lb/>
            by his feeling of resentment towards the Peloponnesians, as that, having <lb/>
            occurred while they were at Cnidus, must have been prior to his interview <lb/>
            with Alcibiades ”—Arnold. </note> <pb n="545"/>
            <note type="margin"> 54, 55.] </note> <lb/>
            us)—and, moreover, if we do not restore Alcibiades, who is <lb/>
            the only man at present that can effect this."</p>
          <p>54. The people were at first very indignant on hearing mention <lb/>
            made of the oligarchy ; but when plainly informed by Pisander <lb/>
            that there were no other means of preservation, being afraid, <lb/>
            and at the same time having 1 hopes of changing it again, they <lb/>
            gave way. Accordingly they resolved that Pisander and ten <lb/>
            commissioners with him should sail and conclude, as they might <lb/>
            think would be best, the negotiations both with Tissaphernes <lb/>
            and Alcibiades. At the same time, on Pisander's falsely ac­ <lb/>
            cusing Phrynichus, the people deposed him from his command <lb/>
            with his colleague Scironides, and sent Diomedon and Leon to <lb/>
            the fleet as generals in their stead. For Pisander calumniated <lb/>
            Phrynichus by saying that he had betrayed Iasus and Amor­ <lb/>
            ges, only because he did not think him favourable to the ne­ <lb/>
            gotiations carried on with Alcibiades. Pisander likewise visited <lb/>
            all the clubs, which had previously existed in the city for mu­ <lb/>
            tual support in law-suits and elections to offices, and exhorted <lb/>
            them to unite together and by common counsels abolish the <lb/>
            democracy; and after making all his other preparations to <lb/>
            suit the present state of affairs, so that there might be no more <lb/>
            delay, he himself with the ten commissioners proceeded on his <lb/>
            voyage to Tissaphernes.</p>
          <p>55. In the course of this winter Leon and Diomedon, having <lb/>
            by this time reached the Athenian fleet, made an attack upon <lb/>
            Rhodes. The ships of the Peloponnesians they found hauled <lb/>
            up, and having made a descent on the territory, and defeated <lb/>
            in an engagement those of the Rhodians who went out against <lb/>
            them, they withdrew to Chalce, and carried on the war from <lb/>
            that place, rather than from Cos; for it was more convenient <lb/>
            for their observing whether the fleet of the Peloponnesians put <lb/>
            out in any direction. Xenophantidas the Lacedæmonian also <lb/>
            came to Rhodes from Pedaritus at Chios, telling them that the <lb/>
            wall of the Athenians was now completed, and unless they <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλπίζων</foreign>.] ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επελπίζων</foreign> is the reading which Bekker adopts from nine <lb/>
            of the MSS. in the sense of " building their hope on this." But as this use <lb/>
            f the word appears to belong to later writers only, it would perhaps be better <lb/>
            (supposing the compound verb to be the genuine reading) to give the preposi­ <lb/>
            tion its very common force of addition, " having, besides their conviction of <lb/>
            present helplessness, the hope of changing hereafter what they did not like.' <lb/>
            Compare the use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιθεραπεύων</foreign>, ch. 47. 1. Or, again, it might imply the <lb/>
            idea of a hope in reserve-an after-hope, as in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίνοια</foreign> ind some; other words: <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [56 </note> <lb/>
            succoured them with all their ships, their cause would be <lb/>
            ruined at Chios. Accordingly they determined to relieve <lb/>
            them. In the mean time Pedaritus, with his mercenaries and <lb/>
            the Chians, made a general assault on the fortification round <lb/>
            the Athenian ships, and took a part of it, and got possession <lb/>
            of some vessels that had been drawn up on shore: but when <lb/>
            the Athenians had come out to the rescue, and had routed the <lb/>
            Chians first, the rest of the force, more immediately around <lb/>
            Pedaritus, was defeated, he himself killed, with many of the <lb/>
            Chians, and a great number of arms taken.</p>
          <p>56. After these things the Chians were besieged still more <lb/>
            closely than before, both by land and sea, and the famine in <lb/>
            the place was great. In the mean time, the Athenian ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors with Pisander arrived at the court of Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            and conferred with him respecting the convention. But as <lb/>
            Alcibiades could not depend on the views of Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            who was more afraid of the Peloponnesians, and wished still <lb/>
            (as he had been instructed by him) to wear both parties out, <lb/>
            he had recourse to the following plan, in order that Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes, by demanding the greatest possible concessions from <lb/>
            the Athenians, might avoid coming to terms with them. Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes also, in my opinion, wished the same result, being <lb/>
            himself led to do so by fear: but Alcibiades, when he saw <lb/>
            that the satrap was not, under any circumstances, desirous of <lb/>
            making an agreement, wished the Athenians to think that he <lb/>
            was not incapable of persuading him, but that when Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes had been persuaded, and was willing to join them, the <lb/>
            Athenians did not concede enough to him. For Alcibiades, <lb/>
            speaking in person in behalf of Tissaphernes, who was also <lb/>
            present, made such excessive demands, that the refusal of the <lb/>
            Athenians, although for a long time they conceded whatever <lb/>
            he asked, was still the apparent cause of their failure. For <lb/>
            they required the whole of Ionia to be given up, and then <lb/>
            again the adjacent islands, with other things ; and when the <lb/>
            Athenians did not object to these demands, at last, in their <lb/>
            third interview, being afraid that he would certainly be con­ <lb/>
            victed of inability to keep his word, he demanded that they <lb/>
            should permit the king to build ships, and sail along his own <lb/>
            coast, wherever and with how many soever he might please. <lb/>
            Upon that the Athenians complied no longer, but considering <lb/>
            that the business was impracticable, and that they had been <pb n="547"/>
            <note type="margin"> 57, 58.] </note> <lb/>
            deceived by Alcibiades, they departed in a rag 2, and went to <lb/>
            Samoa.</p>
          <p>57. Immediately after these things, in the very same winter, <lb/>
            Tissaphernes proceeded to Caunus, wishing to bring the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians back to Miletus, and after making still another <lb/>
            convention with them, to give them pay, and not have them <lb/>
            driven to absolute hostilities with him ; being afraid that if <lb/>
            they were without supplies for many of their ships, they might <lb/>
            either be compelled to engage the Athenians and be defeated, <lb/>
            or through their vessels being unmanned the Athenians might <lb/>
            without his assistance attain the object of their wishes. And <lb/>
            again, he was most of all afraid that they might ravage the <lb/>
            continent in search of supplies. From calculating and fore­ <lb/>
            casting all these things, in accordance with his wish to reduce <lb/>
            the Greeks to a footing of equality with one another, he con­ <lb/>
            sequently sent for the Lacedæmonians, and gave them sup­ <lb/>
            plies, and concluded a third treaty with them, to the following <lb/>
            effect :</p>
          <p>58. “In the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, while <lb/>
            Alexippidas was ephor at Lacedæmon, a convention was con­ <lb/>
            cluded on the plain of the Maeander by the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and their allies, with Tissaphernes, Hieramenes, and the sons <lb/>
            of Pharnaces, respecting the interests of the king, the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians, and their allies.-That the king's country, so far <lb/>
            as it lies in Asia, shall belong to the king still; and that <lb/>
            respecting his own territory, the king shall adopt such mea­ <lb/>
            sures as he pleases.- That the Lacedaemonians and their al­ <lb/>
            lies shall not invade the king's territory, nor the king that <lb/>
            of the Lacedæmonians or their allies, to do it any harm.- <lb/>
            That if any of the Lacedæmonians invade the king's terri­ <lb/>
            tory to do it harm, the Lacedæmonians and their allies shall <lb/>
            prevent it ; and that if any one from the king's country <lb/>
            proceed against the Lacedæmonians or their allies to do them <lb/>
            harm, the king shall prevent it.That Tissaphernes shall <lb/>
            provide the pay for the ships now present, according to the <lb/>
            contract, until the king's fleet has come ; but that when the <lb/>
            king's fleet has come, the Lacedæmonians and their allies <lb/>
            shall be at liberty to maintain their own ships, if they wish it. <lb/>
            That if, however, they consent to receive supplies from Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes, he shall furnish them, and the Lacedæmonians and <lb/>
            their allies shall refund to him, at the conclusion of the war, <note type="footnote">2 N 2 </note> <pb n="548"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[59—61."/> <lb/>
            whatever sums of money they may have received.—That <lb/>
            after the king's ships have arrived, those of the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            and their allies and those of the king shall jointly carry on the <lb/>
            war, according as Tissaphernes and the Lacedæmonians and <lb/>
            their allies may think fit. And if they wish to terminate hos­ <lb/>
            tilities with the Athenians, they shall be terminated on the <lb/>
            same footing."</p>
          <p>59. This was the treaty that was made. And after this, <lb/>
            Tissaphernes prepared to bring up the Phœnician fleet, as had <lb/>
            been agreed, and all other things which he had promised; or, <lb/>
            at any rate, he wished to appear to be thus preparing.</p>
          <p>60. When the winter was now closing, the Bœotians took <lb/>
            Oropus by treachery, while an Athenian garrison was holding <lb/>
            it There co-operated with them, also, some of the Eretrians <lb/>
            and of the Oropians themselves, who were plotting the revolt <lb/>
            of Eubœa. For as the place was just opposite to Eretria, so <lb/>
            long as the Athenians held it, it could not fail to do much dam­ <lb/>
            age both to Eretria and the rest of Eubœa. Being now there­ <lb/>
            fore in possession of Oropus, the Eretrians came to Rhodes, <lb/>
            inviting the Peloponnesians into Eubœa. They, however, <lb/>
            were more disposed to relieve Chios in its distress, and so put <lb/>
            out and sailed from Rhodes with all their fleet. When they <lb/>
            were off Triopium, they descried that of the Athenians out at <lb/>
            st'a, sailing from Chalce: and as neither side advanced against <lb/>
            the other, they arrived, the Athenians at Samos, the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians at Miletus, finding that it was no longer possible to go <lb/>
            to the relief of Chios without a sea-fight. And so the winter <lb/>
            ended, and the twentieth year of this war of which Thucydides <lb/>
            wrote the history.</p>
          <p>61. Immediately at the commencement of the spring of the <lb/>
            following summer, Dercyllidas, a Spartan, was sent with a <lb/>
            small force by land to the Hellespont, to effect the revolt of <lb/>
            Abydus, which is a colony of the Milesians; and the Chians, <lb/>
            while Astyochus was at a loss how to succour them, were <lb/>
            compelled by the pressure of the siege to a naval engagement. <lb/>
            They happened, while Astyochus was still at Rhodes, to have <lb/>
            received from Miletus, as their commander after the death of <lb/>
            Pedaritus, a Spartan named Leon, who had come out as a <lb/>
            passenger with Antisthenes, and twelve ships which had been <lb/>
            on guard at Miletus, five of which were Thurian, four Syra­ <lb/>
            cusan, one Anæan, one Milesian, and one Leon's own ship, <pb n="549"/>
             <note type="margin">62, 63.] </note> <lb/>
            When therefore the Chians had gone out against them in full <lb/>
            force, and had occupied a strong position, while their ships at <lb/>
            the same time to the number of six and thirty put out to meet <lb/>
            the two and thirty of the Athenians, they engaged them by <lb/>
            sea; and an obstinate battle having been fought, the Chians <lb/>
            and their allies, who had not the worst in the action, re­ <lb/>
            turned (for it was now late) into their city.</p>
          <p>62. After this, immediately that Dercyllidas had proceeded <lb/>
            thither by land from Miletus, Abydus on the Hellespont re­ <lb/>
            volted to him and Pharnabazus, as also did Lampsacus two <lb/>
            days later. When Strombichides heard of this, he went to <lb/>
            the rescue from Chios, as quickly as possible, with four and <lb/>
            twenty Athenian ships, some of which also were transports <lb/>
            carrying heavy-armed troops; and when the Lampsacenes <lb/>
            came out against him, having defeated them in battle, taken <lb/>
            at the first assault their city, which was unfortified, and made <lb/>
            spoil of implements and slaves, (though he restored the free­ <lb/>
            men to their dwellings,) he proceeded against Abydus <lb/>
            When they did not capitulate, and he was unable to take <lb/>
            the place by assault, he sailed away to the coast opposite <lb/>
            Abydus, and appointed Sestus, a town of the Chersonese <lb/>
            which the Medes had held at the time 1so well known, as a <lb/>
            post for a garrison, and for the defence of the whole of the <lb/>
            Hellespont.</p>
          <p>63. In the mean time the Chians were masters of the sea <lb/>
            more than they had been ; and Astyochus with those at Mile­ <lb/>
            tus, on hearing the particulars of the naval engagement, and <lb/>
            the departure of Strombichides with his squadron, took fresh <lb/>
            courage. And so having coasted along with two ships to Chios, <lb/>
            he took the fleet from that place, and with all his force now <lb/>
            united advanced against Samos. When the Athenians, in <lb/>
            consequence of their being suspicious of one another, did not <lb/>
            put out to meet him, he sailed back again to Miletus. For <lb/>
            about this time, or still earlier, democracy had been abolished <lb/>
            at Athens. For when Pisander and the ambassadors came <lb/>
            from Tissaphernes to Samoa, they both secured still more <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τότε</foreign>.] " The allusion is to the circumstance that Sestus was almost the <lb/>

            strongly their interest in the army itself, and instigated the <lb/>
            most powerful of the Samians also to try v ith them to set up <lb/>
            an oligarchy among themselves, although they had been rising <lb/>
            up against one another to avoid an oligarchical government. <lb/>
            At the same time those of the Athenians at Samos determined, <lb/>
            after communicating with each other, to give up Alcibiades, <lb/>
            since he would not join them, (for indeed he was not a proper <lb/>
            person, they said, to become a member of an oligarchy,) but to <lb/>
            consider amongst themselves, since they were now actually <lb/>
            imperilled, by what means their cause might escape abandon­ <lb/>
            ment ; and at the same time to persevere in their measures for <lb/>
            the war, and themselves to contribute with alacrity from their <lb/>
            own private resources, both money and whatever else might <lb/>
            be required, since they were no longer bearing the burden for <lb/>
            any but themselves.</p>
          <p>64. Having thus exhorted one another, they then imme­ <lb/>
            diately sent back home Pisander and half the ambassadors, to <lb/>
            manage matters there; with instructions also to establish oli­ <lb/>
            garchy in such of the subject cities as they touched at: the <lb/>
            other half they sent to the rest of the places subject to them, <lb/>
            some in one direction and some in another. They also dis­ <lb/>
            missed to his government Diotrephes, who was in the neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood of Chios, but had been elected to take the command <lb/>
            of the countries Thraceward. He, on his arrival at Thasos, <lb/>
            abolished the democratical government; but about two months <lb/>
            after his departure the Thasians began to fortify their city, <lb/>
            as wanting no more aristocracy in conjunction with the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, but daily looking for liberty to be given them by the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians. For indeed there was a party of them with <lb/>
            the Peloponnesians which had been expelled by the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans, and which, in concert with their friends in the city, was <lb/>
            exerting itself with all its might to bring a squadron, and effect <lb/>
            the revolt of Thasos. They had the fortune, then, to find <lb/>
            what they most wished, namely, the city brought to the right <lb/>
            side without any danger, and the democratical party deposed, <lb/>
            which had been likely to prove an obstacle. Thus then in the <lb/>
            case of Thasos, and, I imagine, in that of many other of the <lb/>
            subjects, the result was the'contrary of what was expected by <lb/>
            those of the Athenians who were establishing oligarchy ; for <lb/>
            when the states had got a moderate government, and security <pb n="551"/>
            <note type="margin"> 65, 66.] </note> <lb/>
            of action, they went on to absolute liberty, and did not value <lb/>
            the specious Advantage of good laws which they received <lb/>
            from the Athenians.</p>
          <p>65. Pisander, then, and his companions, as they coasted <lb/>
            along, abolished the popular governments in the cities, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to arrangement, and, moreover, took from some places <lb/>
            heavy-armed troops as their allies, and so came to Athens. <lb/>
            There they found most of the business already accomplished <lb/>
            by their associates. For some of the younger men, having <lb/>
            conspired together, secretly assassinated one Androcles, the <lb/>
            most prominent leader of the commons, and who also had <lb/>
            mainly procured the banishment of Alcibiades; and for both <lb/>
            these reasons, on account of his being a popular leader, and <lb/>
            because they thought they should gratify Alcibiades, who, <lb/>
            they concluded, would be recalled, and would make Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes their friend, they were the more ready to kill him. <lb/>
            There were some other obnoxious individuals also whom they <lb/>
            secretly took off in the same manner. A proposal too had <lb/>
            already been openly set on foot by them, that no others should <lb/>
            receive pay but such as served in the war ; and that not more <lb/>
            than five thousand should have a share in the government, and <lb/>
            those such as were most competent to do the state service both <lb/>
            with their property and their persons.</p>
          <p>66. Now this was but a specious profession for the people <lb/>
            at large, since the same men would really hold the govern­ <lb/>
            ment as would bring about the revolution. The people, how­ <lb/>
            ever, and the council of five 2 hundred still met notwithstanding, <lb/>
            though they discussed nothing that was not approved of by <lb/>
            the conspirators, but both the speakers belonged to that party, <lb/>
            and the points to be brought forward were previously discussed <lb/>
            by them. Indeed no one else any longer opposed them, through <lb/>
            fear, and from seeing that the conspiracy was extensively <lb/>
            spread; and if any one did speak against them, he immedi­ <lb/>
            ately came to his end in some convenient way, and there was <lb/>
            neither any search made for those who had perpetrated the <lb/>
            deed, nor were they brought to justice if they were suspected; <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐνομίαν</foreign>.] Or " independence," according to the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτονομίαν</foreign>, <lb/>

            but the commons remained still, and in such consternation <lb/>
            that every one thought himself fortunate who did not meet <lb/>
            with some violent treatment, even though he held his tongue. <lb/>
            From supposing, too, that the conspiracy was much more general <lb/>
            than it really was, they were the more faint-hearted, and were <lb/>
            unable to ascertain its extent, being powerless in consequence of <lb/>
            the size of the city, and their not knowing one another's views. <lb/>
            And on this same ground also it was impossible for a man to <lb/>
            bemoan himself to another in his indignation, so as 1 to repel <lb/>
            one who was plotting against him ; since he would either have <lb/>
            found a person he did not know, to whom to speak his mind, <lb/>
            or one whom he knew but could not trust. For all the members <lb/>
            of the popular party approached each other with suspicion, <lb/>
            supposing every one to have a hand in what was going on. For <lb/>
            there were amongst them some whom one would never have <lb/>
            supposed likely to join an oligarchy ; and it was these that pro­ <lb/>
            duced the greatest distrust in the many, and that contributed <lb/>
            most to the safety of the few, by confirming the people's want <lb/>
            of confidence in each other.</p>
          <p>67. Pisander and his colleagues therefore having come at <lb/>
            this critical time, immediately addressed themselves to the re­ <lb/>
            mainder of the work. In the first place, having assembled <lb/>
            the people, they moved a resolution for electing ten commis­ <lb/>
            sioners with absolute powers for compiling laws, and that after <lb/>
            compiling them they should lay before the people, on an ap­ <lb/>
            pointed day, their opinion as to the manner in which the state <lb/>
            would be best governed. Afterwards, when the day had ar­ <lb/>
            rived, they enclosed the assembly in the Colonus, (a temple of <lb/>
            Neptune outside the city, at the distance of about ten stades,) <lb/>
            and the compilers brought forward no other motion, but simply <lb/>
            this, that any of the Athenians should be at liberty to express <lb/>
            any opinion he might please ; and if any one either prosecuted <lb/>
            the speaker for illegality, or otherwise injured him, they im­ <lb/>
            posed upon him severe penalties. Upon that it was at length <lb/>
            plainly declared, that no one should any longer either hold <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύνασθαι ἐπιουλεύσαντα</foreign>.] Or, as others have taken it, "to defend <lb/>
            himself by plotting against his enemy." But Arnold truly, I think, ob­ <lb/>
            serves, that if that had been the meaning, Thueydides would probably have <lb/>
            written <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντεπιουλεύσαντα</foreign>. In addition to the passage to which he refers, <lb/>

              that they should elect five men as presidents, who, again, <lb/>
              should elect a hundred, and each of the hundred three for <lb/>
              himself, and that these, amounting to four hundred, should <lb/>
              enter the council-chamber, and govern as they might think <lb/>
              best, with full powers, and should elect the five thousand also, <lb/>
              whenever they might please.</p>
          <p>68. Now it was Pisander who moved this resolution, and <lb/>
            in other respects was openly the most forward in assisting to <lb/>
            put down the democracy. But the person who devised the <lb/>
            whole business, and the means by which it was brought to <lb/>
            this issue, and who for the longest time had given the subject <lb/>
            great attention, was Antiphon, a man second to none of the <lb/>
            Athenians of his day in point of virtue, and who had proved <lb/>
            himself most able to devise measures, and to express his views ; <lb/>
            who also, though he did not come forward in the assembly of <lb/>
            the people, nor by choice in any other scene of public debate, <lb/>
            but was viewed with suspicion by the people through his re­ <lb/>
            putation for cleverness, yet was most able for any one man <lb/>
            to help those who were engaged in contest, whether in a court <lb/>
            of justice, or before a popular assembly, whoever of them <lb/>
            might consult him on any point. And he himself, too, when <lb/>
            the party of the Four Hundred had subsequently fallen, and <lb/>
            was severely treated by the commons, appears to me to have <lb/>
            made the best defence of all men up to my time, when tried <lb/>
            for his life on the subject of this very government, on a charge <lb/>
            of having assisted in setting it up. Phrynichus, too, showed <lb/>
            himself, beyond all others, most zealous for the oligarchy, <lb/>
            through fear of Alcibiades, and the certainty that he was <lb/>
            acquainted with the intrigues he had carried on at Samoa <lb/>
            with Astyochus ; for he thought that, in all probability, he <lb/>
            would never be restored by an oligarchical government. And <lb/>
            he showed himself, when once he had undertaken their busi­ <lb/>
            ness, by far the most capable of facing dangers. Theramenes <lb/>
            the son of Hagnon was also a leader amongst those who joined <lb/>
            in abolishing the democracy, a man of no small power, either <lb/>
            of language or intellect. So that, conducted as it was by so <lb/>
            many clever men, it was not unnatural that the business should <lb/>
            succeed, though an arduous one. For it was a difficult mat­ <lb/>
            ter to deprive the Athenian people of its liberty, about a hun <lb/>
            dred years after the deposition of the tyrants, and when it had <pb n="554"/>
            <note type="margin"> [69, 70 </note> <lb/>
            not only been subject to none, but accustomed also, for more <lb/>
            than half of that period, to rule over others.</p>
          <p>69. When the assembly had been dissolved, without con­ <lb/>
            tradiction from any one, and by its own ratification of the <lb/>
            measure, then they afterwards introduced the Four Hundred <lb/>
            into the council-chamber, in the following manner. All the <lb/>
            Athenians, in consequence of the enemy established at Decelea, <lb/>
            were constantly under arms, either on the walls or in the <lb/>
            ranks. On that day, then, they permitted those who were not <lb/>
            privy to their design to 1 go home, as usual; while to those <lb/>
            who were in the conspiracy directions were given to wait <lb/>
            about quietly, not just by the arms, but at some little distance ; <lb/>
            and if any one should oppose what was doing, to seize the <lb/>
            arms and not suffer it. Moreover, some Andrians and Teni­ <lb/>
            ans, and three hundred Carystians, with some of the Æginetan <lb/>
            colonists, whom the Athenians had sent to occupy that island, <lb/>
            had come for this very purpose with their own arms ; to whom <lb/>
            directions had already been given on this subject. When <lb/>
            these things had been thus arranged, the Four Hundred, each <lb/>
            with a dagger concealed on his person, and the hundred and <lb/>
            twenty Grecian youths, of whose services they availed them­ <lb/>
            selves wherever any business required to be despatched, came <lb/>
            and presented themselves to the council of Five Hundred, whc <lb/>
            were in their chamber, and told them to take their pay and <lb/>
            go out; themselves bringing it for the whole of their remain­ <lb/>
            ing term of office, and giving it to them when they went out.</p>
          <p>70. When in this way the council had withdrawn without <lb/>
            speaking a word against it, and the rest of the citizens made <lb/>
            no disturbance, but kept quiet, the Four Hundred then en­ <lb/>
            tered the council-chamber, and elected their prytanes by lot; <lb/>
            and for what concerned the gods, offered prayers and sacri­ <lb/>
            fices on installing themselves in their government. After­ <lb/>
            wards, however, they departed widely from the popular ad­ <lb/>
            ministration, (except that they did not recall the exiles, because <lb/>
            of Alcibiades,) and in other respects ruled the city by force. <lb/>
            Some men, who appeared desirable to be taken out of their <lb/>
            way, they put to death, though not many; others they put in <lb/>
            prison, and others they banished. They also entered into <note type="footnote"> I i e “after a sort of morning parade," as Arnold expresses, <lb/>

            communication with Agis, the Lacedæmonian king, who was <lb/>
            at Decelea; telling him that they were desirous of making <lb/>
            peace, and that it was but reasonable that, as he would treat <lb/>
            with them, and no longer with the faithless multitude, he <lb/>
            should more readily come to terms.</p>
          <p>71. He, however, thought that the city was not in a settled <lb/>
            state, and that the people would not so immediately give up <lb/>
            their ancient liberty, nor remain quiet, if they should see a <lb/>
            large force of Lacedæmonians; and not being quite sure at <lb/>
            present that they were no longer in a disturbed condition, he <lb/>
            made no conciliatory answer to those who had come from the <lb/>
            Four Hundred, but sent for a large additional force from the <lb/>
            Peloponnese, and not long after went down himself with the <lb/>
            garrison from Decelea, in conjunction with the troops which <lb/>
            had joined him, to the very walls of Athens; hoping that <lb/>
            either the people there, being thrown into disorder, would <lb/>
            submit on his own terms, or that in consequence of the con­ <lb/>
            fusion which would probably be created both within and with­ <lb/>
            out, he could not fail to carry the long walls on the first as­ <lb/>
            sault, owing to the absence of troops along them for their <lb/>
            defence. But when he approached near to the city, and the <lb/>
            Athenians made not the slightest stir within, while they sent <lb/>
            out their cavalry, with a division of their heavy-armed, light- <lb/>
            aimed, and archers, and shot down some of the enemy in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of their near advance, and got possession of some arms <lb/>
            and dead bodies, then indeed, finding this to be the case, he <lb/>
            led his army back again. He and his own troops still remain­ <lb/>
            ed in their former position at Decelea, but the newly arrived <lb/>
            forces he sent home, after they had staid in the country some <lb/>
            few days. After this, the Four Hundred sent an embassy to <lb/>
            Agis nevertheless ; and when he now received them more fa­ <lb/>
            vourably, and advised them to that effect, they sent envoys to <lb/>
            Lacedaemon also to negotiate a treaty, being desirous of peace.</p>
          <p>72. They likewise sent ten men to Samos, to reassure the <lb/>
            troops, and to tell them that the oligarchy had not been estab­ <lb/>
            lished for the injury of the city and the citizens, but for the <lb/>
            preservation of the whole state ; moreover, that there were <lb/>
            five thousand, and not four hundred only, who had a share in <lb/>
            the government; though never yet, in consequence of their <lb/>
            expeditions and their foreign occupations, had the Athenians <lb/>
            come to consult on a business of such importance that five <pb n="556"/>
             <note type="margin">[73 <lb/>
            </note>thousand of them assembled for the purpose. They gave them, <lb/>
            too, all other instructions as to what was suitable for them to <lb/>
            say, and despatched them immediately after their own estab­ <lb/>
            ment in power, being afraid that a mob of sailors might (as <lb/>
            was really the case) both themselves refuse to continue under <lb/>
            the government of an oligarchy, and through the evil spread­ <lb/>
            ing from that quarter be the means of deposing them.</p>
          <p>73. For at Samos the oligarchy was already made the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of new measures, and the following events happened at <lb/>
            the very time that the Four Hundred were conspiring. Those <lb/>
            of the Samians who had risen up against the aristocratical <lb/>
            party, and constituted the commons, turning round again, and <lb/>
            being prevailed upon by Pisander on his arrival, and by the <lb/>
            Athenians who were in the conspiracy at Samos, both bound <lb/>
            themselves by oaths to the number of three hundred, and were <lb/>
            prepared to attack the rest, as forming the democratical party. <lb/>
            They also put to death one Hyperbolus, an Athenian, a base <lb/>
            fellow, who had been ostracised, not from fear of his influence <lb/>
            or rank, but for his villany, and for being a disgrace to the city ; <lb/>
            acting in the matter in concert with Charminus, one of the <lb/>
            generals, and a party of Athenians who were with them, and <lb/>
            to whom they had given pledges of faith. They likewise per­ <lb/>
            petrated other such deeds in conjunction with that party, and <lb/>
            had determined to make an attack on the populace. They, <lb/>
            however, having notice of their design, revealed what was going <lb/>
            to be done to Leon and Diomedon, two of the generals, (for <lb/>
            these submitted to the oligarchy against their will, from being <lb/>
            honoured by the people,) and to Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus, <lb/>
            the former serving as a trierarch, the latter in the heavy in­ <lb/>
            fantry, as well as some others who had always been thought <lb/>
            to be most opposed to the conspirators; begging them not to <lb/>
            stand still and permit them to be ruined, and Samos to be lost <lb/>
            to the Athenians, through whose help alone their empire had <lb/>
            held together up to this time. On hearing this, they went to <lb/>
            every one of the soldiers, and exhorted them not to put up <lb/>
            with it, and especially the crew of the Paralus, as all on board <lb/>
            of that vessel were Athenians and freemen, and had always <lb/>
            been most bitter against an oligarchical government, even be­ <lb/>
            fore there was one established. Leon and Diomedon also <lb/>
            left them some ships for their protection, whenever they might <lb/>
            themselves sail any where So that when the three hundred <pb n="557"/>
            <note type="margin"> 74, 7&amp; </note> <lb/>
            made an attack on them, by the aid of all these, and especially <lb/>
            of the crew of the Paralus, the popular party of the Samians <lb/>
            gained the upper hand. Of the three hundred they put to death <lb/>
            some thirty, and banished three who were the most guilty; <lb/>
            while with the rest they entered into an amnesty, and lived to­ <lb/>
            gether for the future under a democratical government.</p>
          <p>74. The ship Paralus, and Chæreas son of Archestratus on <lb/>
            board of it-an Athenian who had been forward in the revolu­ <lb/>
            tion—were sent by the Samians and the soldiers with all speed <lb/>
            to Athens, to carry the news of what had taken place ; for <lb/>
            they were not yet aware of the Four Hundred being in power. <lb/>
            On their sailing into harbour, the Four Hundred immediately <lb/>
            threw some two or three of the crew into prison, and having <lb/>
            taken their vessel from them, and removed them into another <lb/>
            employed as a troop-ship, they set them to keep guard round <lb/>
            Eubœa. Chæreas, by some means or other, immediately se­ <lb/>
            creted himself; and when he saw the present state of things, <lb/>
            he went back to Samos, and took the soldiers an exaggerated <lb/>
            report of affairs at Athens, aggravating every thing, and <lb/>
            telling them that " they were punishing all with stripes, and <lb/>
            it was impossible to speak a word against those who held the <lb/>
            government; moreover, that their wives and children were <lb/>
            outraged, and that they intended to seize and confine all the <lb/>
            relatives of such as were in the army at Samos and not on <lb/>
            their own side, in order that, if they would not submit to <lb/>
            them, the prisoners might be put to death :” with many other <lb/>
            false statements which he made beside.</p>
          <p>75. On hearing this, they were at first strongly inclined to <lb/>
            make an attack on those who had been the chief authors of <lb/>
            the oligarchy, and such of the rest as had taken part in it. <lb/>
            Afterwards, however, being prevented by the men of moder­ <lb/>
            ate views, and warned not to ruin their cause, while the enemy <lb/>
            were lying so near them with their ships ready for action, <lb/>
            they desisted from it. After this, wishing openly now to <lb/>
            change the government at Samos to a democracy, Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus the son of Lycus, and Thrasylus, (for these were the <lb/>
            chief leaders in the revolution,) bound all the soldiers,and, most <lb/>
            of all, the oligarchical party themselves, by the most solemn <lb/>
            oaths, that they would assuredly be governed by a democracy, <lb/>
            and live in concord ; and also that they would zealously prose­ <lb/>
            cute the war with the Peloponnesians. and would be foes to <pb n="558"/>
            <note type="margin"> [76 </note> <lb/>
            the Four Hundred, and hold no intercourse with them. All <lb/>
            the Simians too, who were of full age, took the same oath <lb/>
            with them ; and the soldiers communicated to the Samians all <lb/>
            the circumstances, and the probable results of their dangers, <lb/>
            thinking that neither for them nor for themselves was there <lb/>
            any resource that could save them, but that if either the Four <lb/>
            Hundred or the enemy at Miletus should defeat them, they <lb/>
            would be destroyed.</p>
          <p>76. Thus they were engaged in contention at this time, the <lb/>
            one party wishing to force the city to a democracy, the other <lb/>
            to an oligarchy. And the soldiers immediately held an as­ <lb/>
            sembly, in which they deposed their former generals, and any <lb/>
            of the trierarchs whom they suspected, and chose others in <lb/>
            their place, both trierarchs and generals; of whom Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus and Thrasylus were two. They also stood up and <lb/>
            exhorted one another, both on other topics and on this; " that <lb/>
            they ought not to be disheartened because the city had re­ <lb/>
            volted from them ; for it was but the smaller party which had <lb/>
            separated from them who were the larger, and better provided <lb/>
            in all respects. For since they held the whole fleet at their <lb/>
            command, they would compel the other cities under their do­ <lb/>
            minion to give them money, just the same as though they <lb/>
            were coming from Athens. For they had a city in Samos, <lb/>
            and no weak one either, but such as, when at war with <lb/>
            them, had been within a very little of taking away the com­ <lb/>
            mand of the sea which the Athenians enjoyed. And as for <lb/>
            the enemy, they were defending themselves against them from <lb/>
            the same position as before. They, then, inasmuch as they <lb/>
            had command of the ships, were more able to provide them­ <lb/>
            selves with necessaries than those at home. Nay, it was <lb/>
            through their being stationed in advance at Samos, that those <lb/>
            at home had before commanded the entrance to the Piræus ; <lb/>
            and now also they would be brought to such a strait, should <lb/>
            they not consent to give them back the government, that they <lb/>
            themselves would be better able to exclude them from the <lb/>
            sea than to be excluded from it by them. Indeed it was but <lb/>
            a trifling and inconsiderable degree in which the city was of <lb/>
            use to them towards gaining the victory over the enemy; and <lb/>
            they had lost nothing in losing those who had neither any <lb/>
            more money to send them, (but the soldiers provided it them­ <lb/>
            selves.) nor yet good counsel to give them, for the sake of <pb n="559"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="77-79.]"/> <lb/>
            which a state has authority over armaments. On the con <lb/>
            trary, even on these points the other party had done wrong by <lb/>
            abolishing the laws of their fathers; while they themselves <lb/>
            maintained those laws, and would endeavour to make them do <lb/>
            it also. So that neither had they the inferiority as regarded <lb/>
            those who should give good counsel. Alcibiades, too, would <lb/>
            gladly secure them the alliance of the king, should they grant <lb/>
            to him security of person and a restoration to his country. And <lb/>
            what was most important, should they fail on all points, yet, <lb/>
            having so large a fleet as they had, there were many places <lb/>
            for them to retire to, in which they would find both cities and <lb/>
            territory."</p>
          <p>77. Having thus debated the matter together, and encou­ <lb/>
            raged one another; they proceeded to make preparations for <lb/>
            the war no less than before ; and the ten ambassadors who had <lb/>
            been sent to Samos by the Four Hundred, hearing of this <lb/>
            when they were now at Delos, remained quiet there.</p>
          <p>78. About this time also the soldiers in the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            fleet at Miletus were raising a clamour amongst themselves, <lb/>
            about their cause being ruined by Astyochus and Tissaphernes. <lb/>
            For Astyochus, they said, would neither fight before, while <lb/>
            they themselves were still the stronger, and the Athenian fleet <lb/>
            was small, nor would he now, when the enemy were said to <lb/>
            be in a state of sedition, and their ships were not yet brought <lb/>
            together; but they would run the risk of being worn out by <lb/>
            delay, while waiting for the Phœnician fleet-an idle pretence, <lb/>
            and not a reality. And Tissaphernes, on the other hand, did <lb/>
            not bring up this fleet, and at the same time injured their own <lb/>
            navy by not giving them supplies regularly, or to the full <lb/>
            amount. They ought therefore to wait no longer, but to <lb/>
            come to a decisive engagement at sea. It was the Syracusans <lb/>
            that most especially urged this.</p>
          <p>79. The confederates, and particularly Astyochus, hearing <lb/>
            these murmurs, and having resolved in council to fight a de­ <lb/>
            cisive battle, since the disturbances at Samos were also re­ <lb/>
            ported to them, they weighed anchor with all their ships, <lb/>
            amounting to a hundred and twelve, and having given orders <lb/>
            for the Milesians to march by land towards Mycale, they sailed <lb/>
            to the same place. But the Athenians with their eighty-two <lb/>
            ships which were lying at Glauce in the territory of Mycale, <lb/>
            (Samos being but a short distance from the mainland at this <pb n="560"/>
            <note type="margin"> [SO </note> <lb/>
            point, opposite Mycale,) when they saw the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            fleet sailing against them, retired to Samos, not thinking them­ <lb/>
            selves sufficiently strong in numbers to risk a battle for their <lb/>
            all. Besides, as they had had notice from Miletus of the <lb/>
            enemy's wish for an engagement, they were expecting Strom­ <lb/>
            bichides from the Hellespont, to reinforce them with the ships <lb/>
            which had gone from Chios to Abydus; for a messenger had <lb/>
            previously been sent to him. Thus they retired to Samos; <lb/>
            while the Peloponnesians put in at Mycale, and formed their <lb/>
            encampment, with the land forces of the Milesians and the <lb/>
            people in the neighbourhood. The next day, when they were <lb/>
            going to advance against Samos, tidings reached them of the <lb/>
            arrival of Strombichides with the squadron from the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, and tiiey immediately sailed back again to Miletus. The <lb/>
            Athenians, when their squadron had joined them, advanced <lb/>
            themselves against Miletus with a hundred and eight ships, <lb/>
            wishing to come to a decisive battle; but when no one came <lb/>
            out to meet them, they sailed back again to Samos.</p>
          <p>80. The same summer, and immediately after this, since <lb/>
            the Peloponnesians had not with their whole united fleet offer­ <lb/>
            ed battle to the enemy, not thinking themselves a match for <lb/>
            them, they were at a loss from what quarter to get money for <lb/>
            such a number of vessels, especially as Tissaphernes supplied it <lb/>
            ill; and therefore they sent Clearchus the son of Ramphias with <lb/>
            forty ships to Pharnabazus, in accordance with the original <lb/>
            orders from the Peloponnese. For Pharnabazus invited them <lb/>
            to his aid, and was prepared to furnish them with supplies; <lb/>
            and at the same time intelligence reached them that Byzantium <lb/>
            had revolted. Accordingly, these ships of the Peloponnesians <lb/>
            put out into the open sea, in order to escape the observation <lb/>
            of the Athenians during their voyage ; but were overtaken by <lb/>
            a storm, and the greater part of them put into Delos with <lb/>
            Clearchus, and subsequently returned to Miletus, (Clearchus. <lb/>
            however, afterwards went to the Hellespont by land, and en <lb/>
            tered on his command,) while the rest, to the number of ten. <lb/>
            arrived safe at the Hellespont with Helixus the Megarean, <lb/>
            and effected the revolt of Byzantium. After this, when the <lb/>
            commanders at Samos were aware of it, they sent some ships <lb/>
            to the Hellespont to oppose them and keep guard against them ; <lb/>
            and a trifling battle was fought at sea before Byzantium. be­ <lb/>
            tweet eight vessels against eight. <pb n="561"/>
            <note type="margin"> ,82 I </note> </p>
          <p>81. Now the leading men at Samos, and especially Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus, had all along retained the same purpose, ever since <lb/>
            he had effected a change in the government, namely, to re­ <lb/>
            store Alcibiades ; and at length, in an assembly, he persuaded <lb/>
            the greater part of the soldiers to the same; and when they <lb/>
            had passed a decree for the return and security of Alcibiades, <lb/>
            he sailed to Tissaphernes, and brought Alcibiades to Samos, <lb/>
            thinking that their only chance of preservation was his bring­ <lb/>
            ing Tissaphernes over from the Peloponnesians to them. An <lb/>
            assembly therefore having been convened, Alcibiades both <lb/>
            complained of and deplored his own calamity in having been <lb/>
            banished, and by speaking at great length on public matters <lb/>
            raised them to no slight hopes forthe future ; and extravagantly <lb/>
            magnified his own influence with Tissaphernes, in order that <lb/>
            both the members of the oligarchy at home might be afraid of <lb/>
            him, and the clubs be the more quickly broken up; and also <lb/>
            that those at Samos might hold him in the greater honour, <lb/>
            and be more encouraged themselves ; and that the enemy, <lb/>
            moreover, might be as much as possible set against Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes, and cast down from their present hopes. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly Alcibiades, in the most boastful strain, held out these <lb/>
            promises to them ; “ that Tissaphernes had pledged himself to <lb/>
            him, that if he could but trust the Athenians, assuredly they <lb/>
            should not want for supplies, so long as any of his own pro­ <lb/>
            perty remained, even though he should have at last to sell his <lb/>
            own bed ; and that he would bring the Phœnician ships which <lb/>
            were now at Aspendus to join the Athenians, instead of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesians; but he could only place confidence in the <lb/>
            Athenians, if Alcibiades himself were recalled to be his se­ <lb/>
            curity for them."</p>
          <p>82. On hearing these and many other representations, they <lb/>
            immediately elected him general in company with the former <lb/>
            ones, and committed to him the whole management of their <lb/>
            affairs. And now for nothing would they have exchanged <lb/>
            their several hopes at the moment, both of preservation and <lb/>
            of vengeance on the Four Hundred. Nay, they were at once <lb/>
            ready immediately to despise their enemies on the spot, on the <lb/>
            strength of what had been said, and to sail to the Piræus. <lb/>
            He, however, most positively forbad their sailing to the Piræus, <lb/>
            and leaving behind them their enemies who were so much <lb/>
            closer at hand, though many were urgent for it, and told them <note type="footnote"> 2 o </note> <pb n="562"/>
             <note type="margin">[83,84. </note> <lb/>
            that since he had been chosen their general, he would first of <lb/>
            all sail to Tissaphernes, and arrange with him measures for <lb/>
            the war. And so, on leaving this assembly, he took his do.. <lb/>
            parture immediately, that he might be thought to communicate <lb/>
            every thing to him; at the same time that he wished to be <lb/>
            more honoured by him, and to show him that he was now <lb/>
            elected general, and was able to do him either good or harm. <lb/>
            And thus it was the good fortune of Alcibiades to awe the <lb/>
            Athenians by means of Tissaphernes, and Tissaphernes by <lb/>
            means of them.</p>
          <p>83. When the Peloponnesians at Miletus heard of the re­ <lb/>
            call of Alcibiades, though they were before distrustful of Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes, they were now far more disgusted with him than <lb/>
            ever.. For 1the truth was, that in the case of the Athenians <lb/>
            advancing against Miletus, when the Peloponnesians would <lb/>
            not put out to meet them and give them battle, Tissaphernes <lb/>
            became far more sick of giving them pay; and indeed that he <lb/>
            had even before this made some progress in their dislike, on <lb/>
            account of Alcibiades. And so the soldiers, and some of the <lb/>
            other men of consideration also, as well as the soldiery, club­ <lb/>
            bing together as before, began to reckon up their grievances ; <lb/>
            namely, that they had never yet received their full pay; that <lb/>
            what was now given them was deficient in amount, and not <lb/>
            even that paid regularly; that unless they either fought a de­ <lb/>
            cisive battle, or removed to some station 2where they might <lb/>
            have supplies, the men would desert their ships; and that for <lb/>
            all this Astyochus was to blame, through his humouring Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes for his own profit.</p>
          <p>84. While they were thus reckoning up their grievances, <lb/>
            the following disturbance also occurred about Astyochus. <lb/>
            The Syracusan and Thurian seamen, inasmuch as they were, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παι τὸν ἐπίπλουν</foreign>.] If <foreign xml:lang="grc">καί</foreign> must be changed, as most of the editors <lb/>

            generally speaking, most free, applied to him also with the <lb/>
            greatest boldness, and demanded their pay. He answered them <lb/>
            somewhat haughtily, and threatened them ; and indeed against <lb/>
            Dorieus, who was supporting the plea of his own seamen, he <lb/>
            even lifted up his baton. When the mass of the armament <lb/>
            saw this, sailor-like, they rushed 1in a rage upon Astyochus <lb/>
            to strike him; but he saw them in time, and fled for refuge to <lb/>
            an altar. Notwithstanding their rage, therefore, he was not <lb/>
            struck, but they were parted again. The Milesians also took <lb/>
            the fort belonging to Tissaphernes which had been built in <lb/>
            Miletus, having attacked it when unobserved, and drawn out <lb/>
            of it the garrison that was in it. And the rest of the con­ <lb/>
            federates also approved of these things, and especially the <lb/>
            Syracusans. Lichas, however, was displeased with them, <lb/>
            and said that the Milesians and the rest of the states in the <lb/>
            king's country ought to submit to Tissaphernes, in such things <lb/>
            as were reasonable, and to pay him court, until they had <lb/>
            brought the war to a happy conclusion. But the Milesians <lb/>
            were offended with him for this, and other things of the same <lb/>
            kind ; and afterwards, when he had died of sickness, they <lb/>
            would not allow them to bury him where those of the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians who were present wished to do.</p>
          <p>85. When their affairs, then, were involved in these dis­ <lb/>
            sensions both with Astyochus and Tissaphernes, Mindarus <lb/>
            arrived from Lacedæmon to succeed Astyochus as admiral, <lb/>
            and assumed the command, while Astyochus sailed away. <lb/>
            With him Tissaphernes also sent, as an ambassador, one of his <lb/>
            courtiers named Gaulites, a Carian who spoke2 two languages ; <lb/>
            both to lay an accusation against the Milesians on the subject <lb/>
            of the fort, and at the same time to make an apology for him­ <lb/>
            self; for he knew that the Milesians were going thither chiefly <lb/>
            to raise a clamour against him, and Hermocrates along with <lb/>
            them, who intended to represent Tissaphernes as ruining the <lb/>
            cause of the Peloponnesians in concert with Alcibiades, and <lb/>
            pursuing a double policy. For he had always been at enmity <note type="footnote"> ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκραγόντες</foreign>.] Literally “ breaking out upon him;” an excellent instance <lb/>

              with him about the payment of the money to the forces; and <lb/>
              at last, when Hermocrates was banished from Syracuse, and <lb/>
              some others of the Syracusans, namely, Potamis, Myscon, and <lb/>
              Demarchus, had come to Miletus to take command of the <lb/>
              Syracusan ships, Tissaphernes pressed far more severely than <lb/>
              ever on Hermocrates, when he was now an exile ; both laying <lb/>
              other things to his charge, and especially, that having once <lb/>
              asked him for money and not obtained it, he displayed his <lb/>
              enmity to him in consequence. Astyochus, then, with the <lb/>
              Milesians and Hermocrates, sailed away to Lacedaemon ; while <lb/>
              Alcibiades had by this time crossed over again from Tissa­ <lb/>
              phernes to Samos.</p>
          <p>86. And now the ambassadors from the Four Hundred, <lb/>
            whom they sent at the time we mentioned to appease and in­ <lb/>
            form those at Samos, arrived from Delos, after Alcibiades had <lb/>
            come ; and when an assembly had been called, they attempted <lb/>
            to make a speech. But the soldiers at first would not hear <lb/>
            them, but cried out, that they should put to death those who <lb/>
            were abolishing the democracy; afterwards, however, they <lb/>
            were with difficulty calmed down, and gave them a hearing. <lb/>
            They, then, delivered to them this message; " that it was <lb/>
            neither for the destruction of the state that the recent change <lb/>
            had been made, but for its preservation ; nor in order that it <lb/>
            might be delivered up to the enemy, (for they might have <lb/>
            done that when they invaded the country during their go­ <lb/>
            vernment :) that all in their turn should share the privileges <lb/>
            of the Five Thousand; and that their relatives were neither <lb/>
            being outraged, as Chæreas had slanderously reported to <lb/>
            them, nor suffering any harm, but remained as they were, <lb/>
            each in the enjoyment of his property." Though they made <lb/>
            this and many other statements besides, they listened none <lb/>
            the more favourably, but were angry, and expressed different <lb/>
            opinions, though most generally, that they should sail to the <lb/>
            Piraeus. And on that occasion Alcibiades appeared to have <lb/>
            benefited the state for the first time, and in a degree inferior to <lb/>
            no one else. For when the Athenians at Samos were bent on <lb/>
            sailing against their countrymen, in which case most certainly <lb/>
            the enemy would have taken possession of Ionia and the Hel­ <lb/>
            respont, he was the man who prevented them. Indeed on that <lb/>
            emergency no one else would have been able to restrain the <lb/>
            multitude. He. however, both made them desist from the <pb n="565"/>
            <note type="margin"> 87.] </note> <lb/>
            attack, and silenced with rebukes those individuals who were <lb/>
            on their own account most angry with the ambassadors. He <lb/>
            then dismissed them with an answer from himself, " that he <lb/>
            did not object to the Five Thousand being in power, but <lb/>
            ordered them to depose the Four Hundred, and to establish <lb/>
            the council of Five Hundred as before. That if any retrench­ <lb/>
            ment had been made with a view to economy, in order that <lb/>
            those who were on service might be better provided with sup­ <lb/>
            plies, he entirely approved of it. In other respects also he <lb/>
            urged them to stand out, and not at all to submit to the enemy. <lb/>
            For if only the state were preserved, there was great hope of <lb/>
            their being reconciled to one another; but if either of the two <lb/>
            parties were once destroyed, either that at Samos, or that at <lb/>
            home, there would no longer be any one for them to be reconciled <lb/>
            to." There came also ambassadors from the Argives, with <lb/>
            offers of assistance to the popular party of the Athenians at <lb/>
            Samos ; but Alcibiades thanked them, and desiring them to <lb/>
            come when they should be called upon, thus dismissed them. <lb/>
            Now the Argives came in company with the crew of the Pa­ <lb/>
            raIns, who, when last mentioned, had been commanded by the <lb/>
            Four Hundred to cruise in the troop-ship round Euboea; and <lb/>
            who, while taking to Lacedæmon some Athenians that had <lb/>
            been sent as ambassadors by the Four Hundred, namely, Læs­ <lb/>
            podias, Aristophon, and Melesias, when off Argos in their <lb/>
            passage, seized the ambassadors, and delivered them up to the <lb/>
            Argives, as being some of those who had been most instru­ <lb/>
            mental in abolishing the democracy; while they themselves <lb/>
            did not go to Athens again, but taking the ambassadors from <lb/>
            Argos to Samos arrived there with the trireme they were in.</p>
          <p>87. The same summer, and at the very time when the Pe­ <lb/>
            loponnesians were most offended with Tissaphernes, both on <lb/>
            other accounts, and especially because of the return of Alci­ <lb/>
            biades, thinking that he was now evidently Atticizing, he, <lb/>
            wishing, as it seemed, to clear himself to them of these charges, <lb/>
            prepared to go to Aspendus for the Phoenician ships, and de­ <lb/>
            sired Lichas to accompany him; saying, that with regard to <lb/>
            the armament, he would appoint Tamos as his lieutenant, to <lb/>
            furnish the supplies while he was himself absent. The same <lb/>
            account, however, is not given by all; nor is it easy to decide <lb/>
            with what motive be went to Aspendus, and yet, after going, <lb/>
            did not bring the fleet. For it is certain that the Phœnician <pb n="566"/>
            <note type="margin"> [88. </note> <lb/>
            ships, a hundred and forty seven in number, came as far as <lb/>
            Aspendus ; but why they did not come on, is a subject of <lb/>
            many conjectures. For some think it was, that by going away <lb/>
            he might, in accordance with his plan, wear down the power <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesians ; (at any rate Tamos, who was in­ <lb/>
            trusted with the charge, provided them with supplies no bet­ <lb/>
            ter, but even worse, than himself.) Others, that after bring­ <lb/>
            ing the Phœnicians to Aspendus, he might exact money from <lb/>
            them for their discharge; (for under no circumstances did he <lb/>
            intend to employ them on any service.) Others, that it was <lb/>
            on account of the clamour against him, which had spread to <lb/>
            Lacedagmon—to have it said that he was not wronging them, <lb/>
            but was certainly gone. for the ships, which were undoubtedly <lb/>
            manned for service. To me, however, it appears most evident <lb/>
            that it was with a view to wear out the Greeks, and to keep <lb/>
            them in suspense, that he did not bring the fleet; to weaken <lb/>
            them, during all the time that he was going there and delay­ <lb/>
            in-; and to keep them balanced, in order that he might make <lb/>
            neither party too strong by joining them. For had he wished <lb/>
            to bring the war to a conclusion, it is surely evident that he <lb/>
            might have done it without any doubt. For by bringing the <lb/>
            fleet he would in all probability have given the victory to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians; since even at present they maintained their <lb/>
            opposition with their navy, on terms of equality rather than <lb/>
            of inferiority. But what most clearly convicts him is the <lb/>
            excuse which he alleged for not bringing the ships. For he <lb/>
            said that they were fewer in number than the king had com­ <lb/>
            manded to be collected. But surely he would have gained <lb/>
            still greater thanks by that, through not spending so much of <lb/>
            the king's money, and yet effecting the same object at a less <lb/>
            cost. 'At any rate, with whatever intention it might have <lb/>
            been, Tissaphernes went to Aspendus, and had an interview <lb/>
            with the Phoenicians; and the Peloponnesians, by his desire, <lb/>
            sent Philippus, a man of Lacedæmon, with two triremes to <lb/>
            fetch the fleet.</p>
          <p>88. Alcibiades, on finding that Tissaphernes had gone to <lb/>
            Aspendus, sailed thither himself also with thirteen ships, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾗ τινὶ δὴ γνώμῃ</foreign>.] This passage affords a very good instance of the force <lb/>
            which the conjunctions <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>’ ouv most commonly have, though not always; the <lb/>

            promising the forces at Samos a sure and great benefit; for <lb/>
            that he would either himself bring the Phœnician fleet to the <lb/>
            Athenians, or at any rate prevent its going to the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians. For in all probability he had long known the purpose <lb/>
            of Tissaphernes, that he did not intend fetching them, and <lb/>
            wished to prejudice him as much as possible with the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians, on the ground of his friendship for himself and <lb/>
            the Athenians, that so he might be the more compelled to <lb/>
            join the side of Athens. Accordingly he set sail and pur­ <lb/>
            sued his voyage I upwards, straight for Phaselis and Caunus.</p>
          <p>89. When the ambassadors sent from the Four Hundred <lb/>
            arrived at Athens from Samos, and delivered the message <lb/>
            from Alcibiades, namely, that he begged them to hold out, <lb/>
            and not submit at all to the enemy; and that he had great <lb/>
            hopes of reconciling the army to those at home, and of getting <lb/>
            the better of the Peloponnesians; they gave much more <lb/>
            courage to the greater part of those implicated in the oligarchy, <lb/>
            who had even before been discontented with it, and would <lb/>
            gladly have been quit of the business by any safe means. <lb/>
            Accordingly they now united, and found fault with the present <lb/>
            state of things, having as their leaders some of the most in­ <lb/>
            fluential generals and men in office, such as Theramenes the <lb/>
            son of Hagnon, Aristocrates the son of Scellias, and others; <lb/>
            who, though amongst the first members of the government, <lb/>
            were yet afraid, as they alleged, of the army at Samos, and <lb/>
            of Alcibiades most especially, as also of those whom they were <lb/>
            sending as ambassadors to Lacedæmon, lest without the au­ <lb/>
            thority of the greater part of them they might do the state <lb/>
            some harm; 2and so they declared, not that they wished to <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνω</foreign>,] "i. e. towards the countries on the way to the East, and the <lb/>

            escape from the administration falling into too few hands, but <lb/>
            that they ought to establish the Five Thousand in reality, not <lb/>
            in mere name, and to settle the government on a more equal <lb/>
            basis. This, however, was but a public profession made by <lb/>
            them in word ; but it was from private ambition that most <lb/>
            or them pursued that very method by which an oligarchy <lb/>
            formed out of a democracy is most sure to be overturned. <lb/>
            For all at once not only claim to be equal, but every one <lb/>
            decidedly the first man. [And in such a case failure is in­ <lb/>
            tolerable :] whereas, when an election is made under a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy, 1 a man more easily submits to the result, as he does <lb/>
            not think himself beaten on equal terms. But what most <lb/>
            evidently encouraged them was the interest of Alcibiades <lb/>
            being so strong in the army, and their not thinking that the <lb/>
            power of the oligarchy would be permanent. Each one <lb/>
            therefore strove to be himself the first to take the lead of the <lb/>
            commons.</p>
          <p>90. But those of the Four Hundred who were most opposed <lb/>
            to such a form of government, and who now took the lead, <lb/>
            namely, Phrynichus, (who when general at Samos had quar­ <lb/>
            relled, as already mentioned, with Alcibiades;) and Aris­ <lb/>
            tarchus, a man in the highest degree and for the longest <lb/>
            opposed to democracy; and Pisander, and Antiphon, and <lb/>
            others who were most influential, had before-as soon as they <lb/>
            were established in power, and afterwards, when the forces at <lb/>
            Samos revolted from them for a democracy-sent members of <lb/>
            their body as ambassadors to Lacedæmon, and been very <lb/>
            anxious for peace with them, and been engaged in building <lb/>
            the fort in what is called 2Eetionia. And far more than ever <lb/>
            was this the case, after their ambassadors from Samoa had <lb/>
            arrived ; seeing, as they did, that both the majority of the <lb/>
            people, and those of their own members, who before appeared <note type="footnote"> that this construction is common after verbs of ‘ saying and in the present <lb/>

            </note>trustworthy, were now changing their views. And so they <lb/>
            despatched Antiphon, Phrynichus, and ten others with all <lb/>
            speed, (for they were afraid of what was going on both at <lb/>
            home and at Samos,) with instructions to make terms with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians in any way whatever that was at all <lb/>
            tolerable. And they worked with still greater earnestness at <lb/>
            the fort in Eetionia. Now the object of the fort, as Thera­ <lb/>
            menes and his party maintained, was this; not that they <lb/>
            might avoid admitting the army at Samos into the Piræus, <lb/>
            should they attempt to sail in by force ; but rather that they <lb/>
            might admit the enemy, whenever they pleased, both with <lb/>
            ships and troops. For Eetionia is a mole of the Piræus, <lb/>
            and the entrance into the harbour is straight by it. It was <lb/>
            being fortified therefore in such a manner, in connexion with <lb/>
            the wall previously existing on the land side, that, with only a <lb/>
            few men posted in it, it would command the entrance. For <lb/>
            in the very tower standing on one of the two sides, at the <lb/>
            mouth of the harbour, which was narrow, was the termination <lb/>
            both of the original wall on the land side, and of the new and <lb/>
            inner one which was being built on the side of the sea. They <lb/>
            also built a portico, which was very large and in immediate <lb/>
            connexion with this wall in the Piraeus ; of which they them­ <lb/>
            selves had the command, and in which they compelled all to <lb/>
            deposit both what corn they had before and what was now <lb/>
            brought in, and to take it out thence when they sold it.</p>
          <p>91. On these subjects, then, Theramenes had long been <lb/>
            murmuring; and ever since the ambassadors had returned <lb/>
            from Lacedæmon without effecting any general arrangement <lb/>
            for them, he did so still more, saying that there would be <lb/>
            danger of this fort's proving the ruin of the city. For some <lb/>
            ships from the Peloponnese, whose aid the Eubœans had in­ <lb/>
            vited, to the number of two and forty, including some Italian <lb/>
            and Sicilian vessels from Tarentum and Locri, also happened <lb/>
            to be now lying off Las, in Laconia, and preparing for their <lb/>
            passage to Eubœa, under the command of Agesandridas son <lb/>
            of Agesander, a Spartan. These Theramenes declared to be <lb/>
            sailing, not so much to the aid of Eubœa, as of those who <lb/>
            were fortifying Eetionia ; and that if they were not on their <lb/>
            guard now, they would be lost before they were aware of it. <lb/>
            And there really was some plan of this kind entertained by <lb/>
            those who were charged with it, and it was not merely a ver­ <pb n="570"/>
             <note type="margin">r92. </note> <lb/>
            bal misrepresentation. For it was the wish of that party, if <lb/>
            possible, to retain their dominion over the allies with an <lb/>
            oligarchical government; if not, to retain their independence, <lb/>
            with the possession of their ships and walls ; but if excluded <lb/>
            from that also, at any rate not to perish themselves under the <lb/>
            restored democracy before and above all others, but even to <lb/>
            can in the enemy, and without walls and ships to make peace <lb/>
            with them, and retain the government of the city on any terms <lb/>
            whatever, if they had only security for their persons.</p>
          <p>92. For this reason they were also diligently raising this <lb/>
            fortification, with both posterns and entrances, and facilities <lb/>
            for introducing the enemy, and were desirous to have it com­ <lb/>
            pleted in time. Now what was said of them was previously <lb/>
            advanced in small parties only, and with greater secrecy; but <lb/>
            when Phrynichus, on his return from the embassy to Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon, had been designedly stabbed in the full market by a <lb/>
            man who served in the 1 peripoli, and after proceeding but a <lb/>
            short distance from the council-chamber expired immediately, <lb/>
            and the assassin escaped; while his accomplice, who was an <lb/>
            Argive, though seized and tortured by the Four Hundred, <lb/>
            mentioned no one's name as having instigated him to it, nor <lb/>
            any thing else, but that he knew many men assembled in dif­ <lb/>
            ferent houses, both that of the commander of the peripoli and <lb/>
            others; then indeed, when no disturbance arose from this, <lb/>
            Theramenes and Aristocrates and all the rest of the Four <lb/>
            Hundred, as well as of those out of doors who held the same <lb/>
            views, proceeded with greater confidence to the execution of <lb/>
            their measures. For at this same time the ships had now <lb/>
            sailed round from Las, and after coming to anchor at Epidau­ <lb/>
            rus, had overrun Ægina ; and Theramenes remarked, that it <lb/>
            was not probable that, while on their passage to Eubœa, they <lb/>
            . should have run into the bay, and be lying again at Epidaurus, <lb/>
            unless they had been invited, and come for the purposes with <lb/>
            which he had all along been charging them ; and therefore it <lb/>
            was not possible any longer to remain quiet. At length, after <lb/>
            many more seditious speeches and suspicions had been uttered, <lb/>
            they now proceeded to business in real earnest. For the <lb/>
            heavy-armed who were in the Piræus, building the wall in <lb/>
            Eetionia, amongst whom also was Aristocrates a taxiarch, <lb/>
            with his company, arrested Alexicles, who was a general on <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν περιτόλων</foreign>.] See note, p. 266. </note> <pb n="571"/>
            <note type="margin"> 92 J </note> <lb/>
            the side of the oligarchy, and very favourably inclined to the <lb/>
            associates, and taking him into a house confined him there. <lb/>
            There were others who assisted them in this, and particularly <lb/>
            one Hermon, commander of the peripoli stationed in Munychia; <lb/>
            and, what was of most importance, the mass of the heavy-armed <lb/>
            were in favour of these measures. When this news reached <lb/>
            the Four Hundred, (who happened to be sitting together in <lb/>
            their council-chamber,) immediately, with the exception of <lb/>
            such as did not approve of the present government, they were <lb/>
            prepared forthwith I to arm themselves, and threatened Thera­ <lb/>
            menes and those with him. He, however, said in his defence <lb/>
            that he was ready to go at once and assist in rescuing Alexi­ <lb/>
            cles; and taking with him one of the generals who held the <lb/>
            same views with himself, he proceeded to the Piræus; while <lb/>
            Aristarchus and some young men of the cavalry went to the <lb/>
            rescue. The tumult, then, was great and alarming : for those <lb/>
            in the city thought that the Piræus was already taken, and the <lb/>
            general under arrest put to death; while those in the Piræus <lb/>
            believed that the men in the city were all but attacking them. <lb/>
            But when the elder men stopped those in the city who were <lb/>
            running about, and rushing to the stands of arms ; while Thu­ <lb/>
            cydides the Pharsalian, the Proxenus of the state, was also <lb/>
            present, and earnestly opposed the several parties, calling <lb/>
            upon them not to destroy their country while the enemy were <lb/>
            still waiting to attack them ; they were with difficulty quieted <lb/>
            and forbore from attacking one another. Now when Theramenes <lb/>
            came into the Piræus, (for he too was one of the generals,) as <lb/>
            far as shouting went, he was angry with the soldiers ; but <lb/>
            Aristarchus and those who were opposed to the popular party <lb/>
            were in a violent rage. Most of the soldiers however joined in <lb/>
            the work, without changing their purpose, and asked Thera­ <lb/>
            menes, whether he thought that the wall was being built for <lb/>
            any good, or would be better demolished. He said, that if <lb/>
            they thought right to demolish it, he also agreed with them. <lb/>
            Upon that both the soldiers and many of the men in the Pi­ <lb/>
            ræus immediately mounted, and began to pull down the forti­ <lb/>
            fication. And the cry for the encouragement of the multitude <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς τὰ ὅπλα ίέναι</foreign>.] " To run to the spears and shields," (which in the <lb/>
            present circumstances of the city were always kept piled in the open spaces <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [93 </note> <lb/>
            was this; " that whoever wished the Five Thousand to rule <lb/>
            instead of the Four Hundred, must go to help in the work." <lb/>
            For they continued, notwithstanding, to conceal their real <lb/>
            views under the name of the Five Thousand, so that whoever <lb/>
            wished the commons to hold the government did not expressly <lb/>
            mention that word; fearing that the Five Thousand might <lb/>
            really have been elected, and that so by saying something to <lb/>
            one [who belonged to that body,] he might, through his ig­ <lb/>
            norance of the fact, commit himself. And, indeed, for this <lb/>
            reason the Four Hundred neither wished the Five Thousand <lb/>
            to be elected, nor to have it known that they were not; <lb/>
            thinking, on the one hand, that to instal so many partners <lb/>
            with them would amount to a downright democracy; and, on <lb/>
            the other hand, that uncertainty on the subject would strike <lb/>
            them with fear of one another.</p>
          <p>93. The next day the Four Hundred, although alarmed, <lb/>
            assembled nevertheless in their council-chamber; while the <lb/>
            soldiers in the Piræus, after releasing Alexicles, whom they had <lb/>
            arrested, and demolishing the fortification, came to the temple <lb/>
            of Bacchus close to Munychia, and having piled their arms. <lb/>
            1 held an assembly there out of the usual place; and in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with a resolution made by them, proceeded straightway to <lb/>
            the city, and piled their arms in the 2 Anaceum. But when cer­ <lb/>
            tain chosen deputies from the Four Hundred came to them, they <lb/>
            conversed man with man, and such as they saw to be men of <lb/>
            moderate views they persuaded both to remain quiet themselves, <lb/>
            and to restrain the rest; telling them that they would publish <lb/>
            the names of the Five Thousand, and that from these the <lb/>
            Four Hundred should be elected in rotation, in such a manner <lb/>
            as the Five Thousand might think fit: but, in the mean time, <lb/>
            they begged them by no means to destroy the city, or drive it­ <lb/>
            into the hands of the enemy. So the whole body of the sol­ <lb/>
            diers, when such addresses were made by many and to many, <lb/>
            were more pacified than before, and most alarmed for the <lb/>
            whole state; and they agreed to hold, on an appointed day, <lb/>
            an assembly in the temple of Bacchus, with a view to restoring <lb/>
            concord. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξεκκλησίασαν</foreign>.] Or simply, " held an assembly," according to Bekker’s <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> 94, 95.] </note> </p>
          <p>94. When the day for holding the assembly was come, and <lb/>
            they had all but met, news were brought that the two and <lb/>
            forty ships with Agesander were advancing from Megara <lb/>
            along the coast of Salamis ; and every one of the soldiers in <lb/>
            general considered this to be the very thing which had so long <lb/>
            been asserted by Theramenes and his party, namely, that it was <lb/>
            to the fort that the ships were sailing; and it appeared to have <lb/>
            been thrown down to good purpose. And it might, perhaps, <lb/>
            in some measure have been by appointment that Agesandridas <lb/>
            lingered about Epidaurus and that neighbourhood; though it <lb/>
            is also probable that he stayed there in consequence of the <lb/>
            present sedition amongst the Athenians, in hope of coming up <lb/>
            at the moment favourable for action. But the Athenians, on <lb/>
            the other hand, on receiving this intelligence, immediately ran <lb/>
            down in full force to the Piræus, considering that a war with <lb/>
            the enemy, of greater importance than that amongst them­ <lb/>
            selves, was threatening them at no great distance, but close to <lb/>
            their harbour. Some of them therefore went on board the <lb/>
            ships that were already afloat; others launched additional <lb/>
            ones; and some others ran to the defence of the walls and the <lb/>
            mouth of the harbour.</p>
          <p>95. But the Peloponnesian ships, after sailing by and <lb/>
            doubling Sunium, came to anchor between Thoricus and <lb/>
            Prasiæ, and subsequently went to Oropus. So the Athenians <lb/>
            were compelled to go to sea in a hurry and with 1untrained <lb/>
            crews, inasmuch as the city was in a state of sedition, and <lb/>
            they were anxious with all speed to go to the rescue of what <lb/>
            was their most important possession; (for since Attica had <lb/>
            been closed against them, Eubœa was every thing to them;) <lb/>
            and accordingly they sent Thymochares in command of some <lb/>
            ships to Eretria. When they arrived there, they amounted, <lb/>
            with those that were in Eubœa before, to six and thirty; and <lb/>
            they were immediately forced to an engagement. For Age­ <lb/>
            sandridas, after his men had dined, put out from Oropus, <lb/>
            which is distant from Eretria about sixty stades by sea. <lb/>
            When, then, he was advancing against them, the Athenians <lb/>
            straightway prepared to man their ships, supposing that their <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξυγκροτήτοις</foreign>.] Literally, not hammered together;" i. e. not <lb/>
            blended into one body, like two pieces of metal welded together by the ham­ <lb/>
            mer. To the examples of this metaphorical use of the verbs quoted by <lb/>
            Arnold may be added Demosth. 23. 3, (Reiske,) <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαυμαστοὶ καὶ συγκεκρο</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              men were near their vessels. They, however, were purchasing <lb/>
              provisions for their dinner, not from the market-place, (for by <lb/>
              an arrangement of the Eretrians there was nothing on sale <lb/>
              there,) but from the houses in the outskirts of the town, in <lb/>
              order that the enemy, while the Athenians were long in man­ <lb/>
              ning their ships, might attack them by surprise, and compel <lb/>
              them to put out just as they might happen. Moreover, a <lb/>
              signal had been raised at Eretria to give them notice at Oro­ <lb/>
              pus of the time when they should put to sea. The Athenians <lb/>
              then, having put out with such scanty preparations, and fought <lb/>
              a battle off the harbour of Eretria, held out against them, not­ <lb/>
              withstanding, for some little time, and were then put to flight <lb/>
              and pursued to the shore. And now such of them as took <lb/>
              refuge in the city of the Eretrians, as being friendly to them, <lb/>
              fared worst of all, for they were butchered by them; but <lb/>
              those who fled to the fort in the Eretrian territory, which <lb/>
              the Athenians themselves occupied, were saved ; as also were <lb/>
              all the ships that reached Chalcis. The Peloponnesians, having <lb/>
              taken two and twenty of the Athenian vessels, and either killed <lb/>
              or made prisoners of the men, erected a trophy. And not <lb/>
              long after they effected the revolt of the whole of Eubœa, ex­ <lb/>
              cepting Oreus, (which was held by the Athenians themselves,) <lb/>
              and arranged all other matters thereabout.</p>
          <p>96. When the news of what had happened at Eubœa <lb/>
            reached the Athenians, a greater consternation was felt by <lb/>
            them than had ever been before. For neither had the disaster <lb/>
            in Sicily, though it appeared a great one at the time, nor any <lb/>
            other event, ever yet alarmed them so much. For when, after <lb/>
            their army at Samos had revolted from them, and they had <lb/>
            no more ships nor men to go on board them, while they were <lb/>
            in a state of sedition, and did not know when they might <lb/>
            break out into conflict with one another; [when, I say, under <lb/>
            such circumstances] so great a calamity had befallen them­ <lb/>
            one in which they had lost their fleet, and, what was most of <lb/>
            all, Eubœa, from which they derived more advantages than <lb/>
            from Attica—how could their dejection be unnatural ? But <lb/>
            what especially and most immediately alarmed them, was the <lb/>
            thought that the enemy would venture, on the strength of <lb/>
            their victory, to sail straightway to the attack of their port <lb/>
            Piræus, while it had no ships for its protection; and they <lb/>
            supposed that they were already all but there. And indeed, <pb n="575"/>
            <note type="margin"> 97.] <lb/>
            </note>if they had been more bold, they might easily have done that, <lb/>
            and so have either divided the city still more than ever, by <lb/>
            lying near it, or if they had remained and blockaded it, have <lb/>
            compelled the fleet in Ionia, though opposed to the oligarchy, <lb/>
            to come to the rescue of their own relatives and the whole <lb/>
            city; and in the mean time the Hellespont would have been <lb/>
            theirs, with Ionia, the islands, every thing as far as Eubœa, <lb/>
            in a word, the whole empire of Athens. But it was not on <lb/>
            this occasion, but on many others also, that the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans proved themselves most convenient people for the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians to be at war with. For by being very widely different <lb/>
            in character-the one people being quick, and the other slow; <lb/>
            the one enterprising, and the other unadventurous-they pre­ <lb/>
            sented very many advantages, especially in the case of a naval <lb/>
            empire. A proof of this was given by the Syracusans ; for <lb/>
            they, through being of a congenial disposition, were also most <lb/>
            successful in carrying on war with them.</p>
          <p>97. On receiving therefore this news, the Athenians, not­ <lb/>
            withstanding, manned twenty ships, and called an assembly; <lb/>
            one immediately, which was summoned to meet on that oc­ <lb/>
            casion for the first time in what was called the Pnyx, (where <lb/>
            they had been accustomed to meet in other days,) and in <lb/>
            which they deposed the Four Hundred, and resolved that the <lb/>
            government should be put into the hands of the Five Thou­ <lb/>
            sand ; that 1in that body should be included all who furnished <lb/>
            themselves with heavy armour; and that no one should re­ <lb/>
            ceive pay for the discharge of any office; or if any one did, <lb/>
            they declared him to be accursed. Many other assemblies <lb/>
            were also held subsequently, in which they appointed persons <lb/>
            to frame a code of laws, and every thing else requisite for the <lb/>
            government. And during the first period of this constitution <lb/>
            the Athenians appear to have enjoyed the best polity they <lb/>
            ever did, at least in my time; for the blending together of <lb/>
            the few and the many was effected with moderation ; and this <lb/>
            was what first raised the state up again after the disastrous oc­ <lb/>
            currences which had taken place. They also passed a decree <lb/>
            for the recall of Alcibiades, and some others with him; and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵυαι δὲ αὐτω̃ν</foreign>, K. T. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>." We must suppose that all who could furnish <lb/>
            heavy arms were eligible into the number of the Five Thousand ; whether <lb/>
            the members were fixed on by lot, by election, or by rotation; as it had been <lb/>
            proposed to appoint the Four Hundred by rotation out of the whole number <lb/>
            of the Five Thousand. See ch. 93. 2.”—Arnold </note> <pb n="576"/>
            <note type="margin"> [98, 99. </note> <lb/>
            sending to him and to the army at Samos, they urged them to <lb/>
            attend diligently to their interests.</p>
          <p>98. On this change being made, the party of Pisander and <lb/>
            Alexicles, and all who were most devoted to the oligarchy, <lb/>
            withdrew privily to Decelea; while Aristarchus alone of them, <lb/>
            happening to be in office as general, took with all haste some <lb/>
            of the most barbarous amongst the archers, and proceeded to <lb/>
            CEnoe. This was a fortress belonging to the Athenians on <lb/>
            the borders of Bœotia, and in consequence of a blow that bad <lb/>
            been inflicted on them by the garrison, by cutting off a party <lb/>
            of men on their return from Decelea, it was being besieged by <lb/>
            the Corinthians, who had volunteered for the service, and had <lb/>
            called the Bœotians also to their aid. After communicating <lb/>
            therefore with these, Aristarchus deceived those in Œnoe, by <lb/>
            telling them that their countrymen in the city had made a <lb/>
            general surrender to the Lacedæmonians, and they must give <lb/>
            up the place to the Bœotians; for that such were the terms of <lb/>
            the capitulation. They therefore, believing him, inasmuch as <lb/>
            he was one of the generals, and knowing nothing that had <lb/>
            happened, in consequence of their being blockaded, evacuated <lb/>
            the fort under truce. It was in this manner that the Bœo­ <lb/>
            tians took and occupied CEnoe, and that the oligarchy and se­ <lb/>
            dition at Athens came to an end.</p>
          <p>99. About the same period of this summer the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians at Miletus also executed the following measures. <lb/>
            When none of those who were intrusted with the business by <lb/>
            Tissaphernes, at the time that he went to Aspendus, afforded <lb/>
            them supplies, and neither the Phœnician ships nor Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes made their appearance hitherto, but Philippus who <lb/>
            had been sent with him, as well as another Spartan named <lb/>
            Hippocrates, who was at Phaselis, wrote word to Mindarus <lb/>
            the admiral, that the ships would not join them, and that they <lb/>
            were being wronged by Tissaphernes in every respect; and <lb/>
            when again Pharnabazus was calling them to his aid, and was <lb/>
            desirous to get the ships in his turn, like Tissaphernes, and <lb/>
            cause the remaining cities in his government to revolt from <lb/>
            the Athenians, hoping to gain some advantage thereby; under <lb/>
            these circumstances, I say, Mindarus, with great regularity, and <lb/>
            with orders suddenly given, to escape the observation of those <lb/>
            at Samoa, weighed anchor from Miletus with three and seventy <lb/>
            ships, and sailed for the Hellespont. (Sixteen ships had at an <pb n="577"/>
            <note type="margin"> 100,101.] </note> <lb/>
            earlier period of this same summer entered that sea, and over­ <lb/>
            run some parts of the Chersonese.) But being caught in a <lb/>
            storm, and compelled to do so, he put in at Icarus, and after <lb/>
            remaining there through stress of weather five or six days, ar­ <lb/>
            rived subsequently at Chios.</p>
          <p>100. When Thrasylus heard of his having put out from <lb/>
            Miletus, he himself also set sail straightway from Samos with <lb/>
            five and fifty ships, hurrying on to prevent his sailing into <lb/>
            the Hellespont before him. But on finding that he was at <lb/>
            Chios, and expecting that he would stay there, he posted <lb/>
            scouts both in Lesbos and on the mainland opposite, that in <lb/>
            case of the ships stirring in any direction they might not do <lb/>
            so unobserved; while he himself coasted along to Methymna, <lb/>
            and gave orders for preparing meal and other necessaries, <lb/>
            with a view of advancing from Lesbos to attack them at <lb/>
            Chios, if any length of time should be spent there. At the <lb/>
            same time, since Eresus in Lesbos had revolted, he wished to <lb/>
            sail against and take it, if he could. For some exiles of the <lb/>
            Methymnæans, and those the most influential, having carried <lb/>
            over from Cuma about fifty heavy-armed men who had been <lb/>
            associated with them, and hired others from the continent, <lb/>
            with three hundred in all, of whom Alexander, a Theban, <lb/>
            took the command on the strength of his connexion with <lb/>
            them, made an attack on Methymna first; and when beaten <lb/>
            off from the attempt by means of the Athenian garrison <lb/>
            troops which had advanced from Mytilene, and again re­ <lb/>
            pulsed in an engagement outside of the town, made their way <lb/>
            over the mountain, and procured the revolt of Eresus. Thra­ <lb/>
            sylus therefore sailed against it with all his ships, intending <lb/>
            to assault it. Thrasybulus, too, had arrived there before him <lb/>
            with five ships from Samos, on receiving tidings of the exiles <lb/>
            thus crossing over; but being too late, he went to Eresus, <lb/>
            and lay at anchor before it. They were also joined by two <lb/>
            vessels on their return home from the Hellespont, and by <lb/>
            those of the Methymnæans ; and so there were present, in all, <lb/>
            seven and sixty ships, with the troops of which they made <lb/>
            their preparations for taking Eresus by storm, if they could, <lb/>
            with the aid of engines, or in any way whatever.</p>
          <p>101. In the mean time Mindarus and the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            ships at Chios, after being victualled for two days, and receiv­ <lb/>
            ing from the Chians three Chian tessaracostes a man. on the <note type="footnote"> a p </note> <pb n="578"/>
            <note type="margin"> [102,103 </note> <lb/>
            third day put out with all speed from the island, not into the <lb/>
            open sea, to avoid falling in with the fleet at Eresus, but sail­ <lb/>
            ing to the continent with Lesbos on their left hand. After <lb/>
            touching at the port of Carteria, in the Phocæan territory, and <lb/>
            dining, they proceeded along the coast of Cuma, and supped <lb/>
            at Argennusa on the mainland, over against Mytilene. Thence <lb/>
            they still coasted on, though it was late in the night, and ar­ <lb/>
            rived at Harmatus on the continent, just opposite Methymna, <lb/>
            and after dinner passing quickly by Lectum, Larisa, Hamaxitus, <lb/>
            and the towns in those parts, came somewhat before midnight <lb/>
            to Rhœteum, and so were now in the Hellespont. Some of <lb/>
            the ships also put in at Sigeum, and other places in that <lb/>
            neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>102. Now the Athenians were at Sestos with eighteen <lb/>
            ships; and when their friends gave them notice by fire sig­ <lb/>
            nals, while they also observed the fires on the hostile shore <lb/>
            suddenly appear numerous, they were aware that the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesians were entering the Hellespont. Accordingly that <lb/>
            same night, sailing as quickly as they could, and keeping <lb/>
            close under the shore of the Chersonese, they coasted along <lb/>
            towards Elæus, wishing to escape from the enemy's fleet into <lb/>
            the open sea. And they eluded the observation of the sixteen <lb/>
            ships at Abydus, although orders for keeping guard had been <lb/>
            before given by their friends who went to them, that they <lb/>
            might be on the alert against the Athenians in case they should <lb/>
            sail out. But descrying those with Mindarus in the morn­ <lb/>
            ing, and being immediately chased by them, they had not all <lb/>
            time to escape, but the greater part of them did, to Imbros and <lb/>
            Lemnus; while four of the ships, which were sailing last, <lb/>
            were overtaken off Elæus. One of these, which was stranded <lb/>
            opposite the temple of Protesilaus, they took together with <lb/>
            its crew, and two others without their crews; while the re­ <lb/>
            maining one they burnt, after it had been deserted, close to <lb/>
            Imbros.</p>
          <p>103. After this, with the vessels which had joined them <lb/>
            from Abydus and the rest, amounting in all to eighty-six, <lb/>
            they besieged Elæus that day, and when it did not surrender <lb/>
            sailed back to Abydus. As for the Athenians, they had been <lb/>
            deceived by their scouts, and did not imagine that the pas­ <lb/>
            sage of the enemy's fleet could ever escape their vigilance, but <lb/>
            were leisurely assaulting the walls of Eresus. When, how <pb n="579"/>
            <note type="margin"> 104. 105.] </note> <lb/>
            ever, they were aware of it, they immediately left Eresus, and <lb/>
            proceeded with all haste to the defence of the Hellespont. <lb/>
            And they took two of the Peloponnesian ships, which having <lb/>
            on that occasion put out into the open sea more boldly than <lb/>
            the rest, fell in with them. The next day they arrived and <lb/>
            cast anchor at Elæus, and bringing in from Imbros such ships <lb/>
            as had taken refuge there, they were five days making pre­ <lb/>
            parations for the battle.</p>
          <p>104. After this they fought in the following manner. The <lb/>
            Athenians, drawn up in column, were sailing close along shore <lb/>
            towards Sestos; while the Peloponnesians, observing this from <lb/>
            Abydus, put out on their side also to meet them. When they <lb/>
            found that they were on the eve of an engagement, they ex­ <lb/>
            tended their flank, the Athenians along the Chersonese, from <lb/>
            Idacus to Arrhiana, with seventy-six ships; the Peloponnesians, <lb/>
            on the other hand, from Abydus to Dardanus, with eighty-six. <lb/>
            On the side of the Peloponnesians, the right wing was held <lb/>
            by the Syracusans, the other by Mindarus himself and the <lb/>
            fastest sailing vessels; on that of the Athenians, the left was <lb/>
            held by Thrasylus, the right by Thrasybulus ; while the other <lb/>
            commanders took their position as might severally happen. It <lb/>
            being the object of the Peloponnesians to strike the first blow, <lb/>
            and by outflanking the Athenians' right with their own left <lb/>
            to exclude them, if they could, from sailing out of the straits, <lb/>
            as well as to drive their centre on to the shore, which was at <lb/>
            no great distance ;the Athenians, aware of this, extended their <lb/>
            own wing also where the enemy wished to hem them in, and <lb/>
            had the advantage over them in sailing; while their left had <lb/>
            by this time passed the headland called Cynossema. But in <lb/>
            consequence of this, they had to form their centre with weak <lb/>
            and scattered ships, especially as they had the smaller number <lb/>
            at their command, and the coast about Cynossema formed a <lb/>
            sharp and angular projection, so that what was doing on the <lb/>
            other side of it was not visible.</p>
          <p>105. The Peloponnesians therefore, falling on their centre, <lb/>
            drove the Athenian ships ashore, and landed to follow up their <lb/>
            attack, having had a decided advantage in the action. To <lb/>
            assist their centre was neither in the power of Thrasybulut <lb/>
            on the right, owing to the superior number of ships-that were <lb/>
            pressing on him, nor of Thrasylus on the left; for it was con <lb/>
            cealed from him by the headland of Cynossema, and, moreover, <note type="footnote"> 2 p-2 </note> <pb n="580"/>
            <note type="margin"> 106, 107. </note> <lb/>
            the Syracusans and the rest who were opposed to him with no <lb/>
            inferior numbers prevented his doing it: until the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians, from pursuing, in the security of victory, different <lb/>
            vessels in different directions, began to fall into greater dis­ <lb/>
            order in one part of their force. Thrasybulus therefore, ob­ <lb/>
            serving this, ceased now from extending the flank, and facing <lb/>
            about immediately attacked and routed the ships opposed to <lb/>
            him; and then proceeding to those on the victorious part of <lb/>
            the enemy's line, handled them roughly in their scattered con­ <lb/>
            dition, and threw most of them into a panic without striking <lb/>
            a blow. The Syracusans also had by this time yielded the <lb/>
            victory to Thrasylus, and taken to flight more decidedly, when <lb/>
            they saw the rest doing so likewise.</p>
          <p>106. The rout having thus been effected, and the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesians having most of them taken refuge at the mouth of <lb/>
            the river Midius in the first instance, and then at Abydus, <lb/>
            though the Athenians took but few ships, (for the narrow <lb/>
            breadth of the Hellespont gave their opponents places of re­ <lb/>
            fuge at a little distance,) yet the victory which they gained in <lb/>
            this sea-fight was most opportune for them. For whereas they <lb/>
            had before been afraid of the Peloponnesian fleet, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of losses in detail, as well as of the disaster in Sicily, <lb/>
            they now ceased to think disparagingly of themselves, and to <lb/>
            consider their enemies as good for any thing at sea. However, <lb/>
            they took from their opponents eight Chian vessels, five Cor­ <lb/>
            inthian, two Ambracian, two Bceotian, and one Leucadian, <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian, Syracusan, and Pellenian, respectively; while <lb/>
            they themselves lost fifteen. After erecting a trophy on the <lb/>
            headland of Cynossema, securing the wrecks, and restoring <lb/>
            the enemy their slain under a truce, they then despatched a <lb/>
            trireme to Athens with the news of their victory. On the <lb/>
            arrival of the vessel, and on hearing of their unexpected good <lb/>
            fortune, after the disasters which had recently befallen them <lb/>
            in Eubœa, and through their own sedition, they were much <lb/>
            encouraged, and thought that their cause might still possibly <lb/>
            prevail, if they supported it with vigour.</p>
          <p>107. On the fourth day after the engagement, the Athenians <lb/>
            at Sestos having hastily refitted their ships, sailed against <lb/>
            Cyzicus, which had revolted. And descrying 1 the eight ships <lb/>
            from Byzantium lying at anchor off Harpagium and Priapus, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀκτὼ ναυ̃ς</foreign>.] See ch. 80. 4. </note> <pb n="581"/>
            <note type="margin"> 108, 109.] </note> <lb/>
            they attacked them, and took the vessels, after defeating in a <lb/>
            battle those who came to help them on shore. On their ar­ <lb/>
            rival also at Cyzicus, which was unfortified, they got posses­ <lb/>
            sion of it again, and levied a contribution from it. In the <lb/>
            mean time the Peloponnesians also sailed from Abydus to <lb/>
            Elæus, and recovered such of their ships as were in sound <lb/>
            condition, (the rest having been burnt by the inhabitants,) and <lb/>
            then sent Hippocrates and Epicles to Euboea, to fetch the <lb/>
            squadron that was there.</p>
          <p>108. About this same time, too, Alcibiades returned to <lb/>
            Samos with his thirteen ships from Caunus and Phaselis, <lb/>
            bringing word that he had prevented the Phœnician ships <lb/>
            from joining the Peloponnesians, and had made Tissaphernes a <lb/>
            more decided friend to the Athenians than before. Having <lb/>
            then manned nine ships in addition to those he had already, <lb/>
            lie levied large sums of money from the Halicarnassians, and <lb/>
            fortified Cos. After executing these measures, and placing a <lb/>
            governor in Cos, it being now towards autumn, he sailed back <lb/>
            to Samos. As for Tissaphernes, when he heard that the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian squadron had sailed from Miletus to the Helles­ <lb/>
            pont, he set out again from Aspendus, and proceeded to Ionia. <lb/>
            Now while the Peloponnesians were in the Hellespont, the <lb/>
            Antandrians, (of Æolian extraction,) conveyed by land over <lb/>
            Mount Ida some heavy-armed troops from Abydus, and intro­ <lb/>
            duced them into their city, in consequence of being ill­ <lb/>
            treated by Arsaces the Persian, Tissaphernes' lieutenant. <lb/>
            This same man, pretending to have a quarrel which he had not <lb/>
            yet avowed, and offering service to the chief men amongst <lb/>
            them, had induced the Delians, who had settled at Atramyt­ <lb/>
            tium, when driven from their homes by the Athenians for the <lb/>
            purpose of purifying Delos, to go out as though on terms of <lb/>
            friendship and alliance with him ; and then, having watched <lb/>
            when they were at dinner, had surrounded them with his own <lb/>
            troops, and shot them down. Since therefore they were <lb/>
            afraid, on account of this deed, that he might some time or <lb/>
            other commit some outrage on themselves too, and since he <lb/>
            also imposed upon them burdens which they could not bear, <lb/>
            they expelled his garrison from their citadel.</p>
          <p>109. When Tissaphernes heard of this act also on the part <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesians, as well as that at Miletus and that at <lb/>
            Cnidus, (for there too his garrisons had been driven out,) con- <pb n="582"/>

            sidering that he must have incurred their violent displeasure, <lb/>
            and fearing that they might do him still further mischief, and, <lb/>
            moreover, being vexed to think that Pharnabazus, by receiv­ <lb/>
            ing them, might in less time and at less expense be more <lb/>
            successful in his measures against the Athenians, he de­ <lb/>
            termined to go to them at the Hellespont, that he might both <lb/>
            complain of what had been done at Antandrus, and defend <lb/>
            himself as plausibly as he could against their charges respect­ <lb/>
            ing the Phœnician fleet, and all other matters. Accordingly <lb/>
            he went first to Ephesus, and offered sacrifice to Diana.</p>
