          <p>IN this volume, which completes the Works of Plato, generally <lb/>
            admitted to be genuine, will be found the only English translation <lb/>
            of the Laws, hitherto made directly from the Greek. For although <lb/>
            they form part of Taylor's publication, it is not too much to say <lb/>
            that he can scarcely have looked at the original, but must have <lb/>
            depended on the Latin version of Ficinus; and this too not the <lb/>
            genuine one, but the refiction of it which was made by Symon <lb/>
            Grynæus to suit the printed text.</p>
          <p>Of the grounds on which this suspicion rests, numerous proofs <lb/>
            will be found in the notes. Not only has Taylor tacitly followed <lb/>
            Ficinus in his omissions and insertions, but in numerous instances, <lb/>
            where the genuine version had preserved the sense of the original, <lb/>
            he has neglected it, in accordance with the revised version by <lb/>
            Grynæus.</p>
          <p>For this dereliction of the first duty of a translator, Taylor would <lb/>
            perhaps have pleaded, that, as he never presumed to rival Ficinus <lb/>
            in his knowledge of Plato, whose writings the Italian scholar had <lb/>
            studied from his earliest years, he conceived it far more advisable <lb/>
            to follow the Latin version than to attempt to unravel the original <lb/>
            Greek; where so numerous are the difficulties and so unaccount­ <lb/>
            able the corruptions, as to render it frequently impossible to give <lb/>
            even a readable, much less an elegant, rendering. And so too, it <lb/>
            would seem, thought the French translator Grou ; who, as remarked <lb/>
            by Cousin, has frequently followed Ficinus; and even the German <lb/>
            translator Schulthess seems to have found it easier to translate <lb/>
            from the French than the Greek. Cousin has himself been content <lb/>
             <pb n="IV"/>
            to adopt Grou's translation, as a basis, rather than make a new <lb/>
            one from the original; which he says is full of novelties of syntax, <lb/>
            or rather of the want of all syntax, differing in this respect from <lb/>
            the other dialogues of Plato—a discrepancy, he thinks, owing to <lb/>
            the fact, that the Laws had not received the last touches of the <lb/>
            author's hand.</p>
          <p>That the Laws have come down to us in a very unsatisfactory <lb/>
            state, is well known, and was long since ably shown by Boeckh ; <lb/>
            and it was doubtless owing in part to this conviction that, after <lb/>
            penning some first-rate remarks on the three opening books, he <lb/>
            gave up the task in despair; he saw that the nine remaining pre­ <lb/>
            sented a series of obstacles, which it was useless to encounter and <lb/>
            hopeless to overcome.</p>
          <p>The labour, however, that Boeckh was unwilling to undergo <lb/>
            was subsequently undertaken by Ast; to whose exertions the <lb/>
            reader will find I have been not a little indebted. Since his day, <lb/>
            although the Greek text has been edited and improved partially <lb/>
            with the aid of MSS. by Bekker,—for those, which were collated <lb/>
            for Stalbaum's edition, have afforded nothing new or valuable,­ <lb/>
            yet little has been done in the way of conjectural criticism, either <lb/>
            by those scholars, or by the united efforts of Orelli, Baiter, and <lb/>
            Winckelmann, in their two Zurich editions. Now though Per­ <lb/>
            son said, as we learn from Kidd, in the Pref. p. xlv. to " Porson's <lb/>
            Miscellaneous Criticisms," that in depth of thought Plato was <lb/>
            without a rival; still the stream of his ideas generally flows <lb/>
            as clear as if it were the shallowest of rills; and hence Person <lb/>
            was led to remark, that if the text had not been obscured by nu­ <lb/>
            merous interpolations, it had lost a portion of its original trans­ <lb/>
            parency.</p>
          <p>Equally barren of results has been the search amongst the few <lb/>
            Academic Dissertations, written by the scholars of Germany, nearly <lb/>
            all of which have passed through my hands. I consider it a for­ <lb/>
            tunate circumstance that my attention has been recently directed <lb/>
            to the Notes of Sydenham, published by Matthias, at the end of <lb/>
            his edition of the works of Thomas Gray, the poet; where are an­ <lb/>
            ticipated some of the better emendations of subsequent critics. And <lb/>
            in the Remarks of Gray himself, it will be seen that, although they <lb/>
            are less critical than those of Sydenham, he has forestalled some of <lb/>
             <pb n="V"/>
            the objections brought forward by the more recent impugners of <lb/>
            the genuineness of the Letters.</p>
          <p>On arriving at the 11th Book, I learnt, for the first time, that <lb/>
            there existed in MS. (Harl. 3261) a hitherto unedited version of <lb/>
            the Laws and Epinomis, by Gregorius, or, as it should be written, <lb/>
            Georgius Trapezuntius. It is not however so much a version as a <lb/>
            full abridgment of those two treatises. But it exhibits this remark­ <lb/>
            able phenomenon, that not only does it agree almost verbatim with <lb/>
            the translation of Ficinus, where the latter is at variance with the <lb/>
            Greek; but it differs likewise in other passages to such an extent <lb/>
            as to show that the MS. he used was the same as, or the counterpart <lb/>
            of, the one that fell into the hands of Ficinus. Now as the two <lb/>
            translators were contemporary, and the version of Ficinus was not <lb/>
            put to press till 1483, and did not appear till 1484, two years before <lb/>
            the death of Georgius Trapezuntius at a very advanced age, accord­ <lb/>
            in- to the authority, quoted by Leo Allatius de Georgiis, p. 375, it <lb/>
            was scarcely possible for Trapezuntius to have made use of the ver­ <lb/>
            sion of Ficinus. Nor, on the other hand, was it likely that Ficinus <lb/>
            would have inserted in his own translation, passages taken from the <lb/>
            version of Trapezuntius, not found in the Greek MS. before him ; <lb/>
            even if we admit that he, who considered Plato to be almost an in­ <lb/>
            spired writer, would have condescended to look into a translation <lb/>
            made by the very individual, who had done all in his power to <lb/>
            throw down Plato from his former pedestal of honour, and to place <lb/>
            Aristotle, Plato's great opponent, in his stead.</p>
          <p>As the MS. used by the two translators was either one and the <lb/>
            same, or of the same character, it is fair to infer that the variations <lb/>
            from the usual text are derived from a MS. far superior to any since <lb/>
            discovered; and hence in the case of the other dialogues, where <lb/>
            there is no opportunity of testing the version of Ficinus with that <lb/>
            of a contemporary translator, there can be no sufficient reason for <lb/>
            doubting his good faith in neither adding nor omitting any thing <lb/>
            but upon MS. authority.</p>
          <p>Had the Epinomis not been confessedly a spurious treatise, it <lb/>
            would have been added to the present volume. As it is, it will find <lb/>
            a more fitting place in the next, which will contain six other dia­ <lb/>
            logues, all presumed to be spurious; but which are usually given <lb/>
            in the more complete editions of the Greek text. To these will be <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            added the Definitions, attributed to Speusippus, and also what has <lb/>
            hitherto passed under the name of Timæus Locrus; none of which, <lb/>
            with the exception of the Epinomis, has hitherto appeared in an <lb/>
            English dress. And that nothing may be wanting in this transla­ <lb/>
            tion, relating to the Platonic writings, there will be subjoined the <lb/>
            three existing Greek Lives of the philosopher, and the Introduction <lb/>
            of Alcinous, all for the first time translated into English.</p><pb n="VII"/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>PLATO, having in his imaginary Republic delineated what he con­ <lb/>
            ceived to be the best form of government, and prescribed the course <lb/>
            of instruction, by which the people living under such a polity, might <lb/>
            be brought up and fitted for it, has in the Laws detailed some of the <lb/>
            leading enactments, which such a constitution would require.</p>
          <p>To carry out this idea, he supposes that three elderly statesmen <lb/>
            come together, belonging respectively to Athens, Crete, and Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon; and that the first is requested by the second to lay down a <lb/>
            code of laws, which the Cretan is desirous of submitting to his coun­ <lb/>
            trymen, previous to their re-establishment of a city which had been <lb/>
            depopulated. For Clinias bad been appointed as one of the ten <lb/>
            Commissioners of Cnossus, authorized to draw up a code, such as <lb/>
            they might think of themselves, or obtain from any other quarter.</p>
          <p>For the preference thus shown to the statesmen of Crete and <lb/>
            Lacedæmon, as being the parties who could best appreciate the best <lb/>
            code of laws, Plato has furnished the clue in Protagoras, § 80. For <lb/>
            he there states distinctly, that in those very cities a most beautiful <lb/>
            philosophy was to be found, which had been banded down from an­ <lb/>
            cient times; although it was designedly concealed, with the view of <lb/>
            preventing other nations from profiting by the knowledge of it. <lb/>
            So too in Hipp. Maj. § 8, Lacedæmon is represented as a city well <lb/>
            regulated by laws; doubtless because the masses, who were the mas­ <lb/>
            ters at Athens, possessed only a little power at Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>So plainly indeed had Plato, according to Aristotle in Polit. ii. 2, <lb/>
            3, exhibited his feelings in favour of a mixed form of government, <lb/>
            as recommended in the Republic, that the Stageirite insinuates that <lb/>
            the philosopher of Athens bad imagined merely, what was actually <lb/>
            realized at Lacedæmon. But if that were the case, Plato would <lb/>
            surely never have wasted his time in writing two elaborate treatises <lb/>
            on matters already well known, when it would have been sufficient <lb/>
            to point out, in the Statesman especially, the institutions of Lycurgus, <lb/>
            as the pattern, if not of a faultless government, at least of one, that <lb/>
            approached the nearest to perfection. Hence we may fairly suspect <lb/>
            that Aristotle merely meant to infer that Plato's notions were not <lb/>
            original; a charge to which the philosopher might have replied by <lb/>
            saying, that they were all the better on that very account; for it <lb/>
            was thus shown that, as some of them were practicable-since they <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            had been really put in practice-the rest, which were a reform rather <lb/>
            of existing institutions, than the construction of a code perfectly <lb/>
            novel, would be equally practicable, if they were submitted to the <lb/>
            same test.</p>
          <p>Of the persons of the dialogue, Clinias the Cretan, and Megillus <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian, are supposed by Boeckh to be fictitious characters <lb/>
            merely. But as in all the other dialogues of Plato, whenever a <lb/>
            speaker is mentioned by a specific name, there is no reason for be­ <lb/>
            lieving that he is a mere coinage of the author's brain, but every <lb/>
            reason for a contrary supposition, it is surely fair to infer that two <lb/>
            persons of those names were really living in the time of Plato, al­ <lb/>
            though not the least mention of them is to be found, it would seem, <lb/>
            elsewhere. Far better founded is the suspicion of the Scholiast, <lb/>
            that by the anonymous Athenian Plato himself was intended; and <lb/>
            so too thought Cicero, as may be inferred from the language adopted <lb/>
            De Legg. i. 5, and Plutarch after him, De Isid. et Osirid. ii. p. 370, <lb/>
            E., as Boeckh was the first to remark.</p>
          <p>With regard to the time when the Laws were written, Bentley <lb/>
            and Boeckh refer it to 01. cvi. 1, when Plato had passed his seventy- <lb/>
            fourth year; while according to a tradition, mentioned by Diogenes <lb/>
            Laert. iii. 37, it was not published by Plato himself, but by a friend <lb/>
            and disciple, Philip the Opuntian. Hence Wolf in Prolegomen. <lb/>
            Homer, p. cliii., and Cousin after him, were led to believe that the <lb/>
            treatise never received the author's last touches. Similar too are the <lb/>
            sentiments of Schneider in Prefat. Xenophont. Cyrop. p. xiv.; who <lb/>
            conceives however, that although the greater part exhibits only a <lb/>
            sketch of what the Philosopher intended to say, yet to some passages <lb/>
            he had given the last polish. Now if this were the fact, it would <lb/>
            be a work of supererogation to attempt even to correct the numer­ <lb/>
            ous passages, where errors of every kind are to be met with. But <lb/>
            on this point I confess myself to be rather sceptical. For I cannot <lb/>
            understand what could induce an author like Plato, who said that <lb/>
            writing was the grave of thought, to scribble down his first and <lb/>
            crude ideas upon parchment, when a little time and reflection would <lb/>
            have furnished him with matter far more fit to be read. How much <lb/>
            more reasonable is it to suppose, that all the faults are to be referred <lb/>
            to some other source than the author himself. For as he lived to <lb/>
            the advanced age of eighty-one years, and died, as we learn from <lb/>
            Cicero, De Senect. § 5, in the very act of writing, he had plenty of <lb/>
            time during a period of seven years to re-touch, what he had writ­ <lb/>
            ten at first only imperfectly. And hence I have every where been <lb/>
            led to adopt in the text or notes, whatever has been furnished <lb/>
            by the collations of MSS. and the conjectures of critics, in har­ <lb/>
            mony with the genius of the language and the flow of thought. <lb/>
            And hence too the argument against the genuineness of the Laws, <lb/>
            which Ast has drawn from the imperfection of the style, will only <lb/>
            then be considered of the least value, when it shall be shown that <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            the imperfection is to be referred to the author alone, and not to the <lb/>
            bad faith of interpolators and the carelessness of transcribers.</p>
          <p>So far, however, does Ast appear to have been aware of this rea­ <lb/>
            sonable solution of the difficulties of the construction, that be has <lb/>
            thought proper to startle the learned world with a paradox; and to <lb/>
            assert that it is sufficient to read only a page of the Laws to be <lb/>
            convinced that the treatise was never written by Plato. But as <lb/>
            Aristotle distinctly acknowledges the Republic and Laws to be the <lb/>
            production of the same writer, it seems quite futile to fancy that the <lb/>
            Stageirite was the dupe of a personated Plato; and still more to <lb/>
            draw any inference, but the reverse of what has been drawn by Ast, <lb/>
            from the anecdote recorded by Stobæus, in xiii. p. 147 ; for it proves <lb/>
            that Plato did really employ himself in writing Laws, after the <lb/>
            publication of the Republic. The story is that—" Diogenes once <lb/>
            inquired of Plato, whether he was writing Laws ? He was, said the <lb/>
            other. But what, have you not written the Republic ? Certainly. <lb/>
            What then, had not the Republic laws ? It had. Why then was it <lb/>
            requisite to write laws again ? "-To this, says Cousin, Plato might <lb/>
            have given a ready reply, by stating that in the Republic the enact­ <lb/>
            ments were purely of a moral kind ; but in the Laws, of a penal <lb/>
            character likewise. For in the former treatise, the whole super­ <lb/>
            structure of a state is supposed to rest on the basis of moral habits, <lb/>
            resulting from a correct education; in the latter, the arm of the law <lb/>
            is called upon to restrain by punishment the deviations from a cor­ <lb/>
            rect moral conduct.</p>
          <p>And a similar answer may be given to the arguments deduced <lb/>
            from the discrepancies to be found in the Republic and Laws ; on <lb/>
            which Ast appears to have laid no little stress, as affording a con­ <lb/>
            vincing proof that the two treatises could not have emanated from <lb/>
            the same head and hand. For Apuleius, quoted by Dilthey, in his <lb/>
            dissertation published at Gottingen, in 1820, under the title of <lb/>
            " Platonicorum Librorum de Legibus Examen," and written in re­ <lb/>
            futation of the theory of Ast, observed long ago, that " in a polity, <lb/>
            such as Plato has feigned, there would be no need of any laws what­ <lb/>
            ever;" for their place would be supplied by a virtuous education. <lb/>
            Now as the Laws are supposed to be laid down for a state not merely <lb/>
            ideal, but one to be put into practice, we need not be surprised at <lb/>
            finding that specific enactments are suggested, relating to covenants <lb/>
            and dealings in trade, which are rejected in the Republic, as being <lb/>
            useless in a well-regulated state ; for there persons would be unin­ <lb/>
            fluenced by that pursuit of gain, which leads mankind to evade the <lb/>
            spirit, and sometimes to defy the letter, of the law, and to run the <lb/>
            risk of a punishment uncertain and remote.</p>
          <p>To meet, on the other hand, the arguments drawn in favour of <lb/>
            the genuineness of the Laws, from the similarity in sentiment with <lb/>
            the ideas promulgated in the Dialogues, which Ast himself acknow­ <lb/>
            ledges to be genuine, he is compelled to have recourse to a theory, <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            for which there is not even the shadow of proof. For he supposes <lb/>
            that the author of the Laws was some moral philosopher of the <lb/>
            school of Socrates; who, not understanding the spirit of the Repub­ <lb/>
            lic, amused himself with drawing up a treatise, which was to be ren­ <lb/>
            dered of a more practical character, by the rejection of what he <lb/>
            considered to be objectionable in the Republic; and that it is to this <lb/>
            cause we must attribute the absence of all reference to the doctrines, <lb/>
            promulgated in the Republic, relating to a community of goods, <lb/>
            women, and children. But surely it is far more reasonable to sup­ <lb/>
            pose that such doctrines were not touched upon by Plato, from his <lb/>
            perceiving that they could not be carried out, unless the whole frame <lb/>
            of society was remodelled; and that he was therefore content to <lb/>
            select, what he considered to be the wisest enactments in the exist­ <lb/>
            ing codes of different states, and to add to them others, against <lb/>
            which there would be no prejudice in favour of any prescriptive <lb/>
            ideas of right or wrong. Now that Plato did in all probability <lb/>
            make such a selection, may be inferred from the facts brought for­ <lb/>
            ward by C. F. Hermann, in his two Academic Dissertations, pub­ <lb/>
            lished at Marburg, in 1836, under the titles respectively of " De <lb/>
            Vestigiis Institutorum Veterum, imprimis Atticorum, per Platonis <lb/>
            de Legibus libros indagandis "-and " Juris domestici et familiaris <lb/>
            apud Platonem in Legibus cum veteris Grseciæ inque primis Athena­ <lb/>
            rum institutis comparatio."</p>
          <p>With regard to the matter of the treatise, it is to be regretted that <lb/>
            Plato did not, what he might have done very easily, treat it in a <lb/>
            more formal manner, by detailing the duties which men owe to the <lb/>
            gods, to themselves, and their fellow-creatures; and by mentioning <lb/>
            what rewards and punishments ought to be assigned for deeds of a <lb/>
            virtuous and contrary character. Instead, however, of adopting so <lb/>
            obvious and almost necessary a plan, he has thought proper to imi­ <lb/>
            tate the desultory conversation of a garrulous old age, and to make <lb/>
            one third of the treatise little more than an Introduction to the re­ <lb/>
            mainder ; where, while some laws are introduced with an elaborate <lb/>
            preface, others are dismissed without any; and instead of the rights <lb/>
            of persons and things being defined within strongly marked limits, <lb/>
            they seem to be discussed just as his fancy led the writer to touch <lb/>
            upon each question, no matter how important, or the reverse.</p>
          <p>Of this inattention to the natural order, in which the subjects <lb/>
            should have been taken, no better proof can be furnished than by <lb/>
            referring to the passage in ix. § 13, where it is stated that—" It is <lb/>
            necessary to lay down laws for men, and for them to live according <lb/>
            to law, or else to differ in no respect from animals in the wildest <lb/>
            state of nature;"—a sentiment, which ought to have been promi­ <lb/>
            nently brought forward at the very commencement of the treatise, <lb/>
            and made the basis of all legislation; and an additional support <lb/>
            would have been thus given to the doctrine, broached in the <lb/>
            Protagoras, that laws are required to check the weakness and <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            the depravity of human nature. Instead, however, of assuming a <lb/>
            broad basis like this, on which to build the superstructure of his <lb/>
            code, Plato commences with an inquiry of a very limited kind­ <lb/>
            although well suited to the institutions of Crete and Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            which appear to have had a great affinity with each other-whether <lb/>
            the fortitude exhibited in war is any and what part of virtue; an <lb/>
            inquiry that ought rather to have found a place, where laws are <lb/>
            laid down relating to the duties of soldiers, who should have been <lb/>
            urged to take as their rule of conduct, the sentiment expressed by <lb/>
            Bias, and subsequently by Horace, <lb/>
            Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore. <lb/>
            The good, through love of virtue, hate to sin.</p>
          <p>In defence, however, of this want of method, Cousin has boldly <lb/>
            stept forward, and asserted that, despite an appearance to the con­ <lb/>
            trary, there is to be found in the Laws a perfect regularity, which <lb/>
            reveals itself to those, who study that treatise attentively; while <lb/>
            they, who are not sufficiently versed in the philosophy of Plato, <lb/>
            will doubtless be unable to follow the thread of the discourse, when <lb/>
            it seems to be broken by numerous digressions; for the art, which <lb/>
            reigns through the whole treatise, is a kind of snare for a reader of <lb/>
            modern times, or a labyrinth with its thousand intricacies, totally <lb/>
            unlike the regular and easy road laid down by modern writers on <lb/>
            jurisprudence.</p>
          <p>What credence this assertion of Cousin may gain with others, I <lb/>
            know not; but to myself it is far less satisfactory than his defence <lb/>
            of the prefaces to the different Laws, with which Seneca found such <lb/>
            fault. For, as Cousin remarks correctly, Plato adopted them, to <lb/>
            show that the law-giver ought to treat men, as creatures of reason, <lb/>
            and possessing free-will; and that he should employ persuasion as <lb/>
            well as force ; and explain the moral intention of the laws he intro­ <lb/>
            duces ; and found the obedience to them rather on the light of rea­ <lb/>
            son than the dread of punishment. This very doctrine had indeed, <lb/>
            according to Cicero, De Legg. ii. 6, been inculcated by Charondas <lb/>
            and Zaleucus; but it was left for Plato to enforce it with greater <lb/>
            power, and to put it in a clearer light.</p>
          <p>Although there are not a few subjects, dispersed through the <lb/>
            whole treatise, that can scarcely fail to excite the surprise of a <lb/>
            modern reader, the one most conspicuous perhaps is that relating to <lb/>
            the importance attached to the cultivation of music and dancing, <lb/>
            as something beyond a mere amusement and accomplishment, as <lb/>
            they are deemed at present. For though it may be true, that cer­ <lb/>
            tain kinds of music, even without words, have a tendency to elevate <lb/>
            and purify the soul, and to prevent it from seeking a gratification <lb/>
            in grovelling and gross pursuits, yet it may be fairly doubted whe­ <lb/>
            ther any one was ever corrupted by music alone ; although he might <lb/>
            be by witnessing the dancing, which travellers tell us is to be seen <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            even at this day in Spain and other countries on the shores of the <lb/>
            Mediterranean, and which is evidently only the still surviving rem­ <lb/>
            nant of the Satyric dance of the olden time.</p>
          <p>The last point to which it is requisite to draw the reader's atten­ <lb/>
            tion, is the diminutive size of the state, for which Plato has framed <lb/>
            his elaborate code of laws. For though it is true, as remarked by <lb/>
            Cousin, that it faithfully represents the spirit of the times, when <lb/>
            persons legislated for small republics, yet Plato must have known, <lb/>
            from what he had seen or heard of, that it would be impossible to <lb/>
            preserve his chosen number of 5040 families and the lands assigned <lb/>
            to them, even should the increase of births be remedied by emigra­ <lb/>
            tion, or the population suddenly diminished by pestilence or famine; <lb/>
            and it was therefore not without reason, that at the close of the <lb/>
            treatise he looks forward to some power to preserve, what he felt, <lb/>
            no doubt, carried within itself the germs of future decay, which <lb/>
            the largest empires in the East and the smallest republics elsewhere <lb/>
            have been destined to feel alike.</p>
          <p>As the work of Cousin is not likely to be readily accessible to <lb/>
            the readers of this translation, I have transcribed from his note on <lb/>
            v. § 8, p. 171, the list of the 59 divisors of 5040, which is more <lb/>
            correct and full than the one given by Cornarius.</p>
          <p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, <lb/>

          <p>Clin. I conceive, 0 guest, that it is easy 2 even for every <lb/>
            one2 to apprehend these customs of ours. For you see that <lb/>
            the nature of the whole country of Crete is not a plain, like <lb/>
            that of Thessaly. On this account, they make use of horses <lb/>
            more; but we of running. 3 Now as this irregular [ground]3 <lb/>
            is more adapted to the exercise of foot-races, it is necessary <lb/>
            for a person in such a case to have light arms, and not to run <lb/>
            4holding what has a weight.4 Now the lightness of bows and <lb/>
            arrows seems to be fitted (for this). All these therefore have <lb/>
            been adopted by us in war; and all this has the legislator, as <lb/>

            sary to feast in common for the sake of defence, and for <lb/>
            certain persons, both rulers and ruled, to be drawn up as <lb/>
            their defenders, this should be done in the time of peace likewise. <lb/>
            For that, which most men call peace, is only a name; but <lb/>
            in reality there is a war, not proclaimed by a herald, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to nature, to all2 against all states. For by thus con­ <lb/>
            sidering, you will almost discover, that the Cretan legislator <lb/>
            has, looking to war, ordained for us all institutions both public <lb/>
            and private, and ordered us to guard the laws in such a man­ <lb/>
            ner, as if nothing else were useful, either of possessions or <lb/>
            pursuits, unless one became victorious in war, and all the <lb/>
            goods of the vanquished became the property of the victors.</p>
          <p>[3.] Athen. You appear to me, 0 guest, to have been well <lb/>
            practised in seeing through the laws of Crete. But tell me still <lb/>
            more clearly this. For 3 by the definition you have laid down 3 <lb/>
            of a well-regulated state, you seem to me to say that one ought <lb/>
            to administer it, so arranged in order, as to be victorious over <lb/>
            the rest of states in war. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Just so; and I think it will seem so to this person <lb/>
            here.</p>
          <p>Megil. For how can any Lacedæmonian whatever, 0 thou <lb/>
            divine man, answer otherwise ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Whether, then, is this right in the case of states <lb/>
            towards states, but otherwise in the case of one village towards <lb/>
            another ?</p>
          <p>Clin. By no means otherwise.</p>

            after the name of the goddess Minerva,1—you have, by cor­ <lb/>
            rectly carrying back the reasoning to its principle, made it <lb/>
            clearer; so that you will more easily discover that it has just <lb/>
            now been rightly said, that all persons are enemies to all, both <lb/>
            publicly and privately, and2 each individual to himself.</p>
          <p>Athen. How bast thou, 0 wonderful man, said this ?</p>

            a thing of this kind occurs very and much, not the least in <lb/>
            states.7 For, in the case of those, in which the better conquer <lb/>
            the multitude and the worse, such a city would be correctly <lb/>
            said to be better than itself, and be most justly praised for <lb/>
            such a victory. But the contrary where the contrary (occurs).</p>
          <p>Athen. Now the question, whether the worse is at any time <lb/>
            more excellent than the better, let us lay aside ; for it would <lb/>
            be a long discussion ; but for the present I understand what <lb/>
            is asserted by you; that sometimes citizens of the same family <lb/>
            and of the same city, being unjust and numerous, will, by <lb/>
            coming together, forcibly attack the just, fewer in number, <lb/>
            and enslave them; and that, when they conquer, the city may <lb/>
            be justly said to be inferior to itself, and at the same time de­ <lb/>
            praved ; but, when they are conquered, better than itself, and <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>Clin. What is now said, guest, is very strange ; but yet it <lb/>
            is most necessary to confess it.</p>
          <p>[4.] A then. Hold then, and let us again consider this. <lb/>
            Many brothers may surely be born from one man and from <lb/>
            one (woman). 1 Nor is it at all wonderful that the greater 2 <lb/>
            part of them should be unjust, and the lesser just.</p>
          <p>Clin. It is not.</p>
          <p>Athen. Nor will it be proper for me and you to investigate <lb/>
            this, that, when the base vanquish, both the family and every <lb/>
            kind of relationship may be called inferior to themselves, but <lb/>
            better than themselves, when the base are vanquished. For <lb/>
            we do not investigate these things at present for the sake of <lb/>
            some elegance or inelegance in words, according to the dis­ <lb/>
            course of many, but for the sake of discovering what is a <lb/>
            natural rectitude and error in the case of laws.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak most truly, 0 guest.</p>
          <p>Megil. To me too so much appears to be well said.</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us look into this likewise. Can any one become <lb/>
            a judge of the brothers just spoken of?</p>
          <p>Clin. Doubtless.</p>
          <p>Athen. Which then will be the better judge? He, who <lb/>
            cuts off such of them as are bad, and orders the good to <note type="footnote"> maxime in eis perspicuum," which is far more intelligible than the Greek, </note> <figure type="illustration">

              but suffers the bad to live, being willing to be governed ? <lb/>
              But let us mention a third judge, if such there be, with re­ <lb/>
              spect to virtue; who, receiving a single clan at difference <lb/>
              with itself, will not destroy any person ; but, after having <lb/>
              reconciled the parties, will lay down for them laws relating <lb/>
              to each other, and be able so to guard them, that they may be <lb/>
              on friendly terms.</p>
          <p>Clin. Such a judge and legislator would be the better by far.</p>
          <p>Athen. And he would frame laws for them, looking to a <lb/>
            purpose contrary to war.</p>
          <p>CUn. This indeed is true.</p>
          <p>Athen. But what is he, who brings a state together? <lb/>
            Would he, by looking to external war, better put in order its <lb/>
            life than (by looking) to the wars produced constantly within <lb/>
            itself, which is called sedition ? which every one would par­ <lb/>
            ticularly wish not to occur in his own state; and when it has <lb/>
            occurred, to be released from it as quickly as possible ?</p>
          <p>CUn. (By looking), it is evident, to this (the latter).</p>
          <p>Athen. Whether would any one choose that peace should <lb/>
            result from sedition, through one party being destroyed, and <lb/>
            the other1 victorious, or that, by peace and friendship result­ <lb/>
            ing from a reconciliation, they should necessarily2 direct their <lb/>
            attention to external wars ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Every one would rather wish it to happen to his own <lb/>
            state in this way than in that.</p>
          <p>Athen. Would not a legislator too in a similar manner?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Would not every one lay down all laws for the sake <lb/>
            of that which is best ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But neither war nor sedition is the best of things, <lb/>
            3—for to be in want of these is a thing to be prayed for—3 but <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus has " cum altera pars victoria potita sit," which led Stephens <lb/>

            peace with, and kindly feelings towards, each other. More­ <lb/>
            over, for a state to vanquish itself, is not, it seems, one of the <lb/>
            best, but of necessary things ; just as if1 any one should <lb/>
            think a body in sickness would, when meeting with medicinal <lb/>
            cleansing, be then doing the best, but should pay no attention <lb/>
            to the body, which needed (the cleansing) not at all. Should <lb/>
            any one in like manner have his thoughts directed to the <lb/>
            happiness of a state or an individual, he will never become <lb/>
            correctly2 a statesman, while looking only and primarily to <lb/>
            external war; nor will he be an accurate legislator, unless he <lb/>
            lays down laws respecting war for the sake of peace, rather <lb/>
            than laws respecting peace, for the sake of war.</p>
          <p>[5.] Clin. This reasoning, 0 guest, appears somehow to have <lb/>
            been stated correctly. But still, I wonder whether the institu­ <lb/>
            tions existing with us, and still more those relating to Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            mon, have not given rise to all care for the sake of those things.</p>
          <p>Athen. This may perhaps be the case. We ought not, <lb/>
            however, to contest the matter at present in a harsh manner; <lb/>
            but quietly to ask questions, as both we and they have espe­ <lb/>
            cially an interest in things of this kind. Do ye then keep <lb/>
            pace with my discourse. In the first place, we will place <lb/>
            before you Tyrtæus3—who was by birth an Athenian, but <lb/>
            afterwards a fellow-citizen with these persons here; and who <lb/>
            has the most of all men been engaged on these points-where <lb/>
            he says, " I would not bear in recollection the man, nor hold <lb/>
            him in any account, not though he were the most wealthy of <lb/>
            men, and possessed many good things,"—and he enumerates <lb/>
            nearly all,—" who is not always the best in the affairs of war." <lb/>
            For you have surely heard of his poetry. For this person here <lb/>
            is, I think, saturated with them. <note type="footnote"> 1 Before just as if," in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃμοιον ώς εί</foreign>, Ficinus inserts " putare <lb/>
            autem optimum civitatis statum in pugnando et vincendo consistere," <lb/>
            adopted tacitly, as usual, by Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθω̃ς</foreign>, Boeckh suggested, and Ast approved of, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθὸς</foreign>, so <lb/>

            is, however, content with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθω̃ς</foreign>, which he would perhaps translate, with <lb/>

            brought from Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>Athen. Come then, let us interrogate in common this poet <lb/>
            somehow in this fashion. Thou, most divine poet, Tyrtæus,— <lb/>
            for you appear to us to be wise and good, because you have <lb/>
            celebrated excellently well those, who excel in war,—and as <lb/>
            myself, and this person here, and Clinias the Cnossian, hap­ <lb/>
            pen, as we seem, to agree very much with you in this par­ <lb/>
            ticular,—we wish to know clearly, whether we are speaking <lb/>
            about the same men or not,-do tell us, whether you too think, <lb/>
            as we do, that there are two kinds of war ? Or how (say <lb/>
            you) ? To this I think that a man, much inferior to Tyrtæus, <lb/>
            would say the truth, that there are two kinds; one, which we <lb/>
            now call sedition, which is the most grievous of all wars, <lb/>
            as we just now asserted; but the other kind of war, which <lb/>
            we employ in our differences with those out of the state, and <lb/>
            of a different tribe, we will lay down, as being milder than <lb/>
            the other.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Come now, (inform us) what men, and for what <lb/>
            kind of war, have you so transcendently praised (some) 1 and <lb/>
            blamed others. For you appear to have praised 2 those (en­ <lb/>
            gaged) in a foreign (war).2 For you have said in your poems <lb/>
            thus-that you by no means endure those, <lb/>
            Who dare not upon gory slaughter look, <lb/>
            Nor with the hand, close standing, clutch the foe.</p>
          <p>Hence, as an inference, we should say that you, Tyrtæus, are <lb/>
            praising, it seems, those, who have been eminently conspicuous <lb/>
            in a foreign and external war. Surely he would say this and <lb/>
            confess it.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But we, although these are good, assert that those <lb/>
            are far better, who are conspicuously the best in the greatest <lb/>
            war. We have too the poet Theognis as a witness, a citizen of <lb/>
            Megara in Sicily, who says, <note type="footnote"> 1 On the omission of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούς μὲν</foreign> in the first clause, to be supplied from <lb/>

            The man, who, when the strife of party's high, <lb/>
            Is faithful, is in gold and silver worth <lb/>
            His weight.</p>
          <p>Now, such a one we say is in a more difficult war altogether <lb/>
            superior to the other, by nearly as much as justice, temper­ <lb/>
            ance, and prudence, when coming to the same point, are supe­ <lb/>
            rior 1 to fortitude (by itself alone ).1 For no one can be found <lb/>
            faithful and sound in seditions, without the whole of virtue. <lb/>
            But, as Tyrtæus says, there are a great number of mercenaries <lb/>
            who fight 2 standing firmly with their legs apart,2 and die will­ <lb/>
            ingly in battle-among whom are the most 3 bold, and unjust, <lb/>
            and insulting,3 and nearly4 the most thoughtless of all (men) <lb/>

            even a little advantage, will lay down his laws, while always <lb/>

            virtue. But it is, as Theognis says, a faithfulness in things <lb/>
            of dread, which a person may denominate perfect justice; but <lb/>
            that, which Tyrtæus has praised so highly, is indeed beautiful, <lb/>

            whole of virtue, 2he laid down, and according to their species <lb/>

            kind. But we assert that the inquiry about laws is the busi­ <lb/>

            (to do). And I am in every way delighted with your attempt <lb/>
            to give an explanation on the subject of laws. For it is right <lb/>
            to begin from virtue, by asserting that for its sake a person <lb/>
            has laid down laws. But when you said that the legislator <lb/>
            had laid down all (laws) with reference to a part of virtue, <lb/>

          <p>Athen. It is proper to assert that the laws of the Cretans <lb/>
            are not vainly held in very great esteem by all the Greeks. <lb/>
            For they are in a correct state by their making those, who <lb/>
            use them, happy; for they impart every good. Now there <lb/>
            are two kinds of good; one human, and the other divine; <lb/>
            and the former hangs upon the divine; and if any state re­ <lb/>
            ceives the greater, it possesses likewise the lesser; but if not, <lb/>
            it is deprived of both. But the lesser are those, of which <lb/>
            2 health is the leader, beauty the second in order, and strength <lb/>
            for running, and all other movements of the body, the third; <lb/>
            but the fourth is, Plutus, (wealth,)2 not blind indeed,3 but see­ <lb/>
            in-, acutely, if it follows prudence. Now that which is the <lb/>
            first 4good (and)4 the leader of the divine, is prudence; but <lb/>
            the second, after intellect,5 is a temperate habit of the soul; <lb/>
            from these (two) mixed up with fortitude,6 the third in order <lb/>
            will be justice; and the fourth, fortitude. Now all these are <lb/>
            naturally arranged before those, and so must they be ar­ <lb/>
            ranged by the lawgiver; 7and after these he must enjoin <lb/>
            upon the citizens the other ordinances that look to these.7 <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The version of Ficinus—" te nobis distinguere voluissem," is fol­ <lb/>

            come, whether shall we put down fortitude as a contest merely <lb/>
            with fears and pains ? or with desires likewise and pleasures, <lb/>
            and certain vehement fawnings of flattery, which soften 3 the <lb/>
            minds of those, who deem themselves objects of worship, and <lb/>
            mould them like wax?4</p>
          <p>Megil. 5 I think thus,5 (that it is) a contest with all these.</p>
          <p>Athen. If then we call to mind the previous discourse, this <lb/>
            person here said, that both a state is inferior in some things <lb/>
            to itself, and 6 a man (to himself).6 Was it not so, Cnossian <lb/>
            guest ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now then, whether shall we call him the inferior,7 <lb/>
            who is subdued by pain, or him rather, who is subdued by <lb/>
            pleasure ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Him, it appears to me, who is subdued by pleasure. <lb/>
            And surely we all much rather say that he, who is vanquished <lb/>
            by pleasures, is disgracefully inferior to himself, than he, who <lb/>
            (is vanquished) by pains.</p>
          <p>Athen. Surely the legislator through Zeus and he through <lb/>
            Apollo did not lay down by law that fortitude is lame, and <lb/>
            able to march against things only on its left hand, but unable <lb/>
            (to do so) against elegancies and Batteries on its right hand ? <lb/>
            or (is it able to march against) both ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Against both, I think.</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us, then, mention again what those pursuits <lb/>
            are, in both of your states, which give a taste of pleasures, and <lb/>
            do not avoid them in the same manner, as they do not avoid <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Ficinus has " multa hujusmodi," as if his MS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτερα τοιαυ̃τα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 Ficinus, conceiving perhaps that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχεδὸν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκάστοτε</foreign> could not <lb/>

            possess the means of speaking about pleasures according to <lb/>
            their great and conspicuous parts; but according to their <lb/>
            small I might perhaps have the means.</p>

            But should any one of us, who is desirous of seeing what is <lb/>
            true, and at the same time the best, find fault with any thing <lb/>
            in the laws of our respective countries, let us receive (the <lb/>

            although you were absent from the then thoughts of the party <lb/>
            who laid them down, yet you appear to me to have made a <lb/>
            conjecture reasonably correct, and to have spoken what is <lb/>
            very true.</p>
          <p>Athen. There is then a freedom now from the presence <lb/>
            of young men; but we, on account of our old age, are per­ <lb/>
            mitted by the lawgiver to speak about the laws among our­ <lb/>
            selves, without doing any wrong.</p>
          <p>Clin. Such is the case. Do not then be remiss at all in <lb/>
            reproving our laws. For it is not dishonourable to know <lb/>
            aught of what is not beautiful; but by this means it happens <lb/>
            that a remedy exists to a party receiving what is said with <lb/>
            not an envious feeling, but with a good will.</p>
          <p>[8.] Athen. (You speak) correctly. I shall not however speak <lb/>
            in reprehension of the laws before diligently considering them <lb/>
            to the utmost of my power; or rather, (I shall speak) doubt­ <lb/>
            ingly. For upon you alone of all the Greeks and Barbarians, <lb/>
            of whom we hear, the legislator has enjoined to abstain from <lb/>
            the greatest pleasures and sports, and not to taste them; but <lb/>
            on the question of pains and fears, which we have lately dis­ <lb/>
            cussed, he was of opinion, that if any one should avoid them <lb/>
            thoroughly from his infancy, he would, when he came to endure <lb/>
            necessary labours, and fears, and pains, avoid those, who are <lb/>
            exercised in them, and would become their slave. The same <lb/>
            lawgiver ought, I think, to have thought the same respecting <lb/>
            pleasures, and to have said to himself that, if the citizens shall <lb/>
            from childhood be inexperienced in the greatest pleasures, and <lb/>
            be unpractised in bearing up against pleasures, so as1 not to be <lb/>
            compelled to do any thing base for the sake of the sweetness <lb/>
            arising from pleasure, they would suffer the same as those, who <lb/>
            are vanquished by fear, and become the slaves in a different <lb/>
            and still baser manner to those, who are able to bear up <lb/>
            against pleasures, and are the masters of what relate to plea­ <lb/>
            sures, although they are sometimes the worst of men; and <lb/>
            they would have their soul partly a slave, and partly free, and <note type="footnote"> I Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">και</foreign> the sense requires <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥστε καὶ</foreign>—as I have translated. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="18"/>

          <p>Clin. It appears so 1to us somehow, on the speech being <lb/>
            spoken.1 But immediately (and) readily to be confident about <lb/>
            questions of such moment would be the act rather of young <lb/>

            but in seditions are hurtful. This do the children of the <lb/>
            3 Milesians and Bœotians and Thurians3 make evident. And in <lb/>
            truth this very institution, 4legalized of old, appears to have <lb/>
            perverted the natural4 pleasures of Venus, not only in the case <lb/>
            of men, but of beasts.5 And of such things a person may ac­ <lb/>
            cuse your cities the first, and such others, as have chiefly <lb/>
            adopted gymnastic exercises. And whether one ought to con­ <lb/>
            sider things of this kind in a jocose or serious manner, still <lb/>
            we must consider that, to the male and female sex, proceeding <lb/>

            the act seems to have been imparted according to nature ; but, <lb/>
            that the copulation of males with males, or of females with <lb/>
            females, is contrary to nature ; and that the daring attempt of <lb/>
            those who first did so, arose from the non-mastery over pleasure. <lb/>
            We all of us indeed bring an accusation against the Cretans, <lb/>
            as having invented the story respecting the fable of Gany­ <lb/>
            mede. (For), since their laws are believed by them to have <lb/>
            been from Zeus, they have put together this fable against <lb/>
            Zeus, in order that they may enjoy this pleasure, by following <lb/>

          <p>Athen. 0 Lacedæmonian guest, all such things are to be <lb/>

            with us, and with you, one answer appears to free them, so that <lb/>
            they are not in a bad state, but in a correct one. For every one <lb/>
            may answer and say to a stranger, expressing wonder on his <lb/>

            guest. This law exists amongst us ; but with you perhaps there <lb/>
            is upon the same points a different one. At present however <lb/>
            our discourse is not, 0 friends, about different men, but about <lb/>
            the vice and virtue of the lawgivers themselves. But let us <lb/>
            speak more fully about all kind of intoxication. For it is not <lb/>
            a thing of a trifling nature; nor to know it thoroughly is it <lb/>
            the province of an inferior lawgiver. I am not speaking about <lb/>
            drinking wine or not, in general, but about intoxication itself, <lb/>
            whether it is to be adopted, as the Scythians and Persians use it, <lb/>
            and still more the Carthaginians, and Celts, and Iberians, and <lb/>
            Thracians, all of whom are warlike nations ; or, as you use it; <lb/>
            for you, as you say, abstain from it entirely. But the Scythi­ <lb/>
            ans and Thracians use it entirely unmixed with water, both <lb/>
            women and men, and pour it on their garments, and imagine <lb/>
            they are engaged in a beautiful and blessed occupation. But <lb/>
            the Persians make much use of other luxuries, which you re­ <lb/>

            into our hands.</p>
          <p>Athen. Do not, thou best of men, say this. For many <lb/>
            flights and pursuings have been, and will be, without a proof; <lb/>
            on which account, we cannot at any time give a clear defini­ <lb/>
            tion, but (rather) a doubtful one, about occupations honourable <lb/>
            or not, when we speak of victory and defeat in battle; espe­ <lb/>
            cially since the greater states, when fighting, overcome and <lb/>
            enslave the lesser; as the Syracusans did the Locrians,2 who <lb/>
            were thought to be regulated by the best laws of all those <lb/>
            around that district; and as the Athenians did the Ceans ;3 <lb/>
            and we could find numberless other instances of a similar <lb/>
            kind. But let us endeavour by speaking to persuade ourselves <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus has " fundimus atque fugamus," as if his MS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">διώκομεν <lb/>

            how a pursuit of this kind is honourable, but of that kind not <lb/>
            honourable. But first hear from me, how we ought to con­ <lb/>
            sider what is useful or not as regards those very things.</p>
          <p>Megil. How then say you ?</p>
          <p>[10.] Athen. All those, who in talking lay hold upon any <lb/>
            pursuit and propose to praise or blame it immediately it is enun­ <lb/>
            ciated, appear to me to act by no means according to reason ; <lb/>
            but to do just the same, as if, while one person is praising <lb/>
            wheat1 as good, another should immediately blame it, with­ <lb/>
            out having heard either its operation or utility, (and) in what <lb/>
            manner, and for what, and with what 2 and how it has itself, <lb/>
            and to persons how having themselves, it is useful.2 The very <lb/>
            same thing do we seem to do now in the case of our discourses. <lb/>
            For after merely hearing about drunkenness, some of us <lb/>
            immediately blame, 3 and others praise3 it, and very absurdly <lb/>
            too; for making use of witnesses and those who praise, we <lb/>
            each of us praise,4 and some of us think we say something <lb/>
            decisive, because we adduce many (witnesses); but others, <lb/>
            because we see that those, who do not make use of it (wine), <lb/>
            are victorious when fighting. But this too has been consi­ <lb/>
            dered doubtful by us. If then we go through in this manner <lb/>

            animal itself, as a beautiful possession, but some other person <lb/>
            blame it, from having seen goats feeding apart from the goat­ <lb/>
            herd, in cultivated grounds, 1 and doing mischief and from see­ <lb/>
            ing that every kind of cattle is either without a ruler, or under <lb/>
            bad rulers, 2should thus find faulty should we hold that the <lb/>
            blame of such a person has blamed any thing whatever soundly ?</p>
          <p>Megil. How should we ?</p>
          <p>A then. But is a commander in ships,3 who possesses merely <lb/>
            nautical skill, useful, should he be troubled with sickness or <lb/>
            not ? or how shall we say ?</p>

            competent to command, if he possesses the science of war, al­ <lb/>
            though he may be timid in danger, and be sick with 5 the <lb/>

          <p>Athen. But what if he does not possess the art, and is timid ?</p>
          <p>Megil. You are speaking of a person, who is in every respect <lb/>

          <p>Athen. But we are now speaking not of a person about to <lb/>

            foes during a war, but of friends, sharing during a peace in <lb/>

            friendship, and has the care of it still becoming greater, through <lb/>
            the previous association.</p>
          <p>Clin. Most true.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is proper, therefore, to place over the drunken a <lb/>
            sober and wise ruler, and not the contrary. For, if the ruler <lb/>
            of the drunken is himself drunk, young, and not wise, he <lb/>
            must have great good luck indeed, if he does not perpetrate <lb/>
            some mighty mischief.</p>
          <p>Clin. Very great indeed.</p>
          <p>Atken. Should then any one blame such associations, when <lb/>
            existing as correctly as possible in states, while he is finding <lb/>
            fault with the thing itself, he will perhaps properly blame it. <lb/>

            ignorant that this existed not correctly; and, in the next <lb/>
            place, that every thing will in this manner appear improper, <lb/>

            you not understand, that when a pilot, and each ruler of <lb/>
            each thing, is drunk, he will overturn every thing, whether <lb/>

            him?</p>
          <p>[11.] Clin. You have said, 0 guest, this at least what is al­ <lb/>
            together true. But tell me moreover 2what good would it do us, <lb/>
            should this regulation respecting drinking be correct?2 just <lb/>
            as what we lately stated, that should an army meet with a <lb/>
            correct leading, there would be victory in war, a no small good <lb/>
            to those who followed; and so as regards the rest. But what <lb/>
            great advantage will accrue either to individuals or states <lb/>
            from a drinking association being placed properly under an <lb/>
            instructor ?</p>
          <p>Athen. What great advantage can we say would arise to a <lb/>
            state from one boy, or one chorus,3 being properly instructed ? <lb/>
            Or shall we not say, when asked this question, that the state <lb/>
            derives very little advantage from the education of one person ? <lb/>
            But if you inquire universally about the education of youth, how <lb/>
            does it profit greatly the state, it is not difficult to say, that <lb/>
            persons well educated will become good men ; and becoming <lb/>
            such will act in other respects in an honourable manner ; and still <lb/>
            further, that they will conquer their enemies in battle. Discipline <lb/>
            therefore brings with it even victory ; but victory sometimes <lb/>
            produces a want of instruction. For many become more in­ <lb/>
            solent through victory in war, and through their insolence are <lb/>

            be no grudging; since we have rushed onwards to make for <lb/>
            ourselves a discourse about laws and a polity.</p>
          <p>Clin. Let us then endeavour to learn what is your opinion <lb/>
            upon these doubtful points.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is proper to do so ; and that you for the purpose <lb/>
            of learning, and myself for that of teaching, should endeavour <lb/>
            by some means to lengthen out our discourse. But first of <lb/>
            all, hear from me some such thing as this.</p>
          <p>All the Greeks consider this city of ours as fond of talk­ <lb/>
            ing and of many words; but that Lacedæmon and Crete <lb/>
            practise, the former a brevity in speech, 1 but the latter, an <lb/>
            abundance in thought rather than in words. But I am con­ <lb/>
            sidering lest I shall give you an idea of my speaking much <lb/>
            about a trifling matter, 2while cleansing a very long speech2 <lb/>
            about drunkenness. 3 But the rectification of it according to <lb/>
            nature would not be able, without musical rectitude, to take off <lb/>
            in discourses either clear or sufficient; and on the other hand, <lb/>
            music would not be able without the whole of education.3 Now <note type="footnote"> Polynices, the sons of CEdipus, gained a victory over each other, as de­ <lb/>
            structive as a defeat. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 To the Spartan brevity of speech the earliest allusion is in Æsch. <lb/>

            your voice is grateful1 to me; and that too which is said <lb/>
            by many, that such of the Athenians, as are good, are so <lb/>
            pre-eminently, appears to be most truly asserted. For they <lb/>
            alone, without necessity, by their very nature, and from a <lb/>
            divine allotment, are truly and not feignedly good. There­ <lb/>

            word from myself, do you with confidence speak what you <lb/>
            please. For you have perhaps heard, that Epimenides was held <lb/>
            here a divine man, who was of our family, and ten years prior to <lb/>
            the Persian war came to your city, according to the oracle of <lb/>
            the god,2 and performed certain sacrifices, which the god had <lb/>
            enjoined; and he told, moreover, the Athenians, who were <lb/>
            terrified at the expedition of the Persians, that they would not <lb/>
            come for ten years ; and that, when they did come, they would <lb/>
            depart without having done a single thing they expected, and <lb/>
            suffer greater evils than they inflicted. At that time our an­ <lb/>

            myself and my parents have a kind feeling towards you.</p>

            I too am prepared as regards my will, but not very easy as re­ <lb/>
            gards my power. I must however make the attempt. In the first <lb/>
            place then, as (preparatory) to our discourse, let us define what <lb/>
            education is, and what power it possesses. For we say that <lb/>
            through this must proceed the discourse taken for the present <lb/>
            in hand by us, until it arrives at the deity.3</p>

            from childhood to practise, when engaged in playful and serious <lb/>
            pursuits, the very thing suited to each particular of the object in <lb/>
            view. Thus he, who is about to be a good farmer or house­ <lb/>
            builder, ought, the latter I to play at building children's houses ; <lb/>
            the former, on the other hand, at tilling the ground; and he, <lb/>
            who brings up each of them should provide for each small <lb/>
            instruments, the imitations of the true ones; and moreover, <lb/>
            they should learn previously what is necessary to learn previ­ <lb/>
            ously. For instance, a workman, to measure or use a rule; <lb/>
            and he, who (is to be) a warrior, should in sport ride on horse­ <lb/>
            back, or do something else of a similar kind ; and 3(the mas­ <lb/>
            ter of the children should)3 endeavour by sports to turn the <lb/>
            pleasures and desires of the children thither, where, when they <lb/>
            arrive, it is proper for them to have an end. We say then, <lb/>
            that the very head of instruction is a right bringing up, <lb/>
            which will lead as much as possible the soul of him, who <lb/>
            sports, to the love of that which it will be requisite for him, <lb/>
            when he has become a complete man, to 4lay down as a part <lb/>
            of the virtue of the thing. See then whether, up to this <lb/>

            another uneducated; although the men have sometimes been <lb/>
            very well educated for 5 retail trades, and those of ship-own­ <lb/>
            ers,5 and for 6 the profits from some other things of this kind.6 <note type="footnote"> 1Taylor has followed to the letter the version of Ficinus, " oportet <lb/>

            For of those, who, it seems, consider such things to be edu­ <lb/>
            cation, there would be now no account; but that (we say) is <lb/>
            the education from childhood towards virtue, which causes a <lb/>
            person to feel a desire of, and a love for, becoming a perfect <lb/>
            citizen, and to know how to govern and to be governed with <lb/>
            justice. Such a bringing up this discourse would, as it seems <lb/>
            to me, define, and be willing to call it the only education; <lb/>
            but that, which tends to the acquisition of wealth, or to any <lb/>
            bodily strength, or any other cleverness, apart from intellect <lb/>
            and justice, is a handicraft trade and illiberal, and not worthy <lb/>
            to be called education at all. Let us not then contend with <lb/>
            them1 about a name; but let the assertion, which has been <lb/>
            assented to just now, remain, that those, who are properly <lb/>
            educated, become nearly (all of them)2 good. And it is by <lb/>
            no means meet to hold education in dishonour; since when it <lb/>
            is present to the best men, it is the first of things the most <lb/>
            beautiful. And if at any time a person goes astray, and it is <lb/>
            possible for him to set himself right, this must ever be done <lb/>
            by every one according to his ability, through (the whole <lb/>

          <p>Clin. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>Athen. And in addition to both these, there is the opinion <lb/>
            about things to be, to which is given the common name of ex­ <lb/>
            pectation ; but individually the expectation, prior to pain, is <lb/>
            fear ; but that, which is prior to its contrary, is confidence. But <lb/>
            in the case of all these there is a reasoning process, as to <lb/>
            which of them is better or worse; which, when it becomes <lb/>

            the gods,2 and put together, either as their plaything, or through <lb/>
            some serious act; for on this point we are ignorant; but this <lb/>
            we do know, that these passions are inherent in our nature, <lb/>
            and that they pull us, like nerves or ropes, and being themselves <lb/>
            contrary, draw us to contrary actions, where virtue and vice <lb/>
            are situated apart from each other. For reason says, that <lb/>
            each ought always to follow one of the pullings, and, never <lb/>
            abandoning it, draw in a contrary direction by the other <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτω̃ν</foreign>, Ast has adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν</foreign> from one MS. and Eusebius, <lb/>

            matters; and not a single thing, taken by itself, works out so <lb/>

          <p>Athen. It is necessary therefore for each of us to be fear­ <lb/>
            less and fearful. But on what account, either the one or the <lb/>

          <p>Clin. You are speaking, guest, of a great difference of edu­ <lb/>

          <p>Athen. If, then, we three know what is beautiful in singing <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Well (said), my friend. But in music there are <lb/>

            making use of a resemblance, as the chorus-teachers do, to <lb/>
            speak correctly of a melody or form as being in good rhythm <lb/>
            or in good harmony, but not as being of a good colour. Now <lb/>
            of a timid, and of a brave man, there is a certain form or <lb/>
            melody; and (one) has the power to call those properties of <lb/>

            let all the beautiful forms and melodies connected with the <lb/>

            omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύχαις</foreign>, found in Plato, it was only natural for him to substitute its <lb/>
            synonyme, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάθη</foreign>. Schulthes, in the notes to his German translation, sug­ <lb/>
            gests <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμασι</foreign>. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμασι</foreign> could not thus follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">πράξεσι καὶ τύχαις <lb/>

            thus giving the general sense in elegant language, but cleverly omitting <lb/>
            the words in which all the difficulty lies. By following the clue furnished <lb/>

            by the MSS. that read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιμήσεσι</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιμήσεσι</foreign>, one may suggest that Plato <lb/>
            wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">και γὰρ μιμήσεσι δει̃ξαι τούτων ἔκαστ'ἦν</foreign>, " for it is possible to <lb/>

          <p>Clin. You speak most correctly.</p>
          <p>Athen. Does something then bring any injury to him, who <lb/>
            is delighted with the forms or melodies of depravity ? or an <lb/>
            advantage on the other hand to those, who are pleased with <lb/>
            the contraries to these ?</p>
          <p>Clin. It is probable.</p>
          <p>Athen. Is it probable, or is it necessary also, for the same <lb/>
            thing to take place, as when any one, associating with the de­ <lb/>
            praved habits of depraved men, does not hate, but rejoices in <lb/>
            and admits them; and yet blames his own depravity in the <lb/>
            way of fun, as if he were in a dream. Surely at that time <lb/>
            it is necessary for the party rejoicing to be assimilated to the <lb/>
            things in which he rejoices, even though he is ashamed to <lb/>
            praise them. And yet what greater good, or evil, can we say, <lb/>
            would of every necessity happen to us than a thing of this <lb/>
            kind ?</p>
          <p>Clin. I think, none.</p>
          <p>Athen. But where laws are beautifully established, or will <lb/>
            be at some future period of time, can we think that the in­ <lb/>
            struction touching the Muses and amusement, will be in the <lb/>
            power of poets, so that, whatever delights a poet in compo­ <lb/>
            sition, or what is connected with rhythm, or melody, or verse, <lb/>
            he can, by teaching it to the children of the well-regulated, <lb/>

          <p>Atlien. It is, however, a matter relating pre-eminently to <lb/>
            law and politics. But you would find other things there of <lb/>
            a trifling kind. But this respecting music is true, and worthy <lb/>
            of consideration, that it was possible for 2 a law-giver upon <lb/>
            these points to lay down2 firmly and with confidence melo­ <lb/>
            dies, possessing correctness naturally. But this would be the <lb/>
            work of a deity, or of some divine person; as they say there, <lb/>
            that the melodies, which have been preserved for such a length <lb/>
            of time, are the production of Isis. So that, as I said, if any <lb/>

            perly in looking upon them, while we take a delight in their <lb/>

            the most; and, as I just now said, 3to bear off the prize of <lb/>

            possible, and should be adjudged to be the most agreeable of <lb/>

            proclamation ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Athen. It is surely likely that one would exhibit, like Ho­ <lb/>
            mer, a rhapsody, another guitar-playing ;2 one a tragedy, and <lb/>
            some again a comedy. Nor would it be wonderful, if some <lb/>
            one, by exhibiting things of wonder, should think that he is <lb/>
            especially the victor. Now when these and other competi­ <lb/>
            tors without number come together, can we say which of them <lb/>
            would justly be the victor?</p>
          <p>Clin. You ask an absurd question. For who can answer you <lb/>
            on this point, 3 as if he were cognizant of it,3 before 4 hearing <lb/>

            absurd question ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Now if very little children were to decide, they <lb/>
            would decide that he who had exhibited the things of wonder, <lb/>

            music ought to be judged of by pleasure, yet not by that of any <lb/>

            that the spectators instruct themselves ;6 and it has corrupted <lb/>

            taking place with respect to music, perhaps I have spoken of <lb/>

            abuse things which are incurable, and far advanced in error, <lb/>
            is by no means agreeable, although it is necessary sometimes. <lb/>

          <p>[6.] Athen. 3 Come then, (say,) should we agree3 for the <lb/>
            present, are the things mentioned by you in every kind of edu­ <lb/>
            cation and music these ? Do you compel poets to assert that a <lb/>
            good man, if he is temperate and just, is fortunate and happy, <lb/>
            and if he is a big man and strong, and if little and weak, and if <lb/>
            rich or not ? and that, although he is richer than 4 both Cinyras <lb/>
            and Midas,4 but unjust, he is miserable, and lives in sorrow, and, <lb/>
            as the poet says,5 if he says rightly, “ I would not mention nor <lb/>

              being such a one1 he will stand near and grapple with the foe ; 2 <lb/>

              nor will there ever be to him any other of the things called good. <lb/>
              For what are called good by the many, are not rightly called so. <lb/>
              For it is said that health is the best thing ; beauty the next; <lb/>
              strength the third; and riches the fourth; and numberless <lb/>
              other things are called good. Thus, to see and hear acutely, <lb/>
              and to possess with a clear perception all that is connected <lb/>
              with the senses; and further, to do like a tyrant whatever <lb/>
              you wish ; and, what is said to be the completion of all happi­ <lb/>
              ness, to become, after possessing all these, as quickly as pos­ <lb/>
              sible, immortal. But you and I surely say that all these are <lb/>
              the best possessions for just and holy men; but for the unjust, <lb/>
              all the worst, beginning from health. (For to be well),4 to <lb/>
              see, hear, and possess the (other) senses, and, in short, to live, <lb/>
              is the greatest evil, when a man is immortal 5 [through the <lb/>
              whole of time],5 and possesses all that is called good, except <lb/>
              justice and all virtue ; but it is a less evil, should such a per­ <lb/>
              son survive for the shortest time. In this manner, I think, <lb/>
              you will persuade, and, as I said,6 compel the poets with you <lb/>
              to speak ; and moreover, that persons who follow them should, <lb/>
              by giving out rhythms and harmonies, thus educate your young <lb/>
              men? 7Is it not so? Look, then.7 For I clearly assert, that the <lb/>
              things that are called evil, are good to the unjust, but to the <lb/>
              j ust, are evil; but that things good are to the good truly good, <lb/>
              but evil to the wicked. In what then, I asked, do you and I <lb/>

            persons in the state to speak in this manner ; and I would impose <lb/>

            those, who lead the most just life, or those, who lead the most <lb/>
            pleasant one ? Now, should they say those, who lead the most <lb/>
            pleasant life, their answer would be absurd. But I am desirous <lb/>

            but of fathers and lawgivers rather. Let then the ques­ <lb/>

            let him say that he, who lives the most pleasant life, is the <lb/>
            most happy. After this, I would say thus-Have you not, <lb/>
            father, wished me to live most happily ? And yet you have <lb/>
            never ceased exhorting me to live most justly. He, then, <lb/>
            who lays down1 in this manner, whether he is a legislator or <lb/>
            a father, would, I think, appear absurd, and unable to speak <lb/>
            consistently with himself. But if he should, on the other <lb/>
            hand, proclaim that the most just life is the most happy, every <lb/>
            one, perchance, who hears him, would, I think, inquire- <lb/>
            What is it, which the law praises in that life as good and <lb/>
            beautiful, and better than pleasure ? For what good, separate <lb/>
            from pleasure, can there be to a just man? Come, (tell me,) <lb/>
            -Is renown and praise from both men and gods a thing <lb/>
            good and beautiful, but at the same time unpleasant ? and in­ <lb/>
            famy the contrary ? 2 We shall say-By no means, 0 thou dear <lb/>

          <p>Athen. In the first place then, the boy-choir of the Muses <lb/>
            would most correctly enter the first, about to sing in public <lb/>
            subjects of this kind, with all earnestness, and for the whole <lb/>
            city. And let the second be the choir (of men) up to thirty <lb/>
            years old calling upon the god Paean, as a witness in behalf of <lb/>
            the truth of what is said, and praying him to be, together with <lb/>
            Persuasion, propitious to the youth. And it is necessary for <lb/>
            the third to sing, consisting of those who are above thirty, <lb/>
            and up to sixty years old; but those after that period-for <lb/>
            they are no longer able to endure singing—1 are left as the <lb/>
            tellers of stories relating to the same habits through a divine <lb/>
            oracle.1</p>

            very absurd, if persons, who have been born above thirty and <lb/>
            fifty and up to sixty years old, were to join in the dance for <lb/>
            that god.</p>
          <p>Athen. You speak most truly. But I think there is need <lb/>
            of a reason on these points, to show how this, taking place <lb/>
            thus, may take place rationally.</p>

            carry us, by that, if you are willing, we will go. For if we <lb/>

            the public theatres, let us endeavour to impart it to such as <lb/>
            we said were ashamed of that music, and to seek that, which <lb/>
            is the most beautiful, to share with them.2</p>

            third place, utility. For instance, I say, that agreeableness <lb/>
            follows food and drink, and every kind of aliment, and this <lb/>
            agreeableness we should call pleasure ; 4 but if it contributes to <lb/>

            (namely,) the pleasure, but that it is the truth which perfects <lb/>
            the rectitude and utility, and the well and the beautifully.1</p>
          <p>Clin. It is so.</p>
          <p>Athen. 2But what, in the working out of things similar, <lb/>
            should such arts as are productive of resemblances effect this, <lb/>
            namely, for pleasure to result from them, would it not be most <lb/>

          <p>Clin. Certainly.</p>
          <p>A then. But the equality rather 3of the so great, and of the <lb/>
            such kind,3 would, to speak universally, effect the rectitude of <lb/>
            such things.</p>
          <p>Clin. Right.</p>
          <p>Athen. Hence that alone can be rightly judged of by plea­ <lb/>
            sure, which works out and affords neither a certain utility, or <lb/>
            truth, or similitude; nor, on the other hand, a hurt; but which <lb/>
            subsists for the sake of that very thing alone, (namely,) agree­ <lb/>

            may most beautifully denominate pleasure, when none of those <lb/>
            follow it.</p>
          <p>Clin. Are you speaking of innoxious pleasure alone ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Yes; and I say that this very same (agreeableness) <lb/>
            is sport, when it does neither an injury or a benefit worthy of <lb/>
            serious consideration or mention.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak most truly.</p>
          <p>Athen. Shall we not then assert, from what has been now <lb/>

            be judged of the least by pleasure and false opinion ? For <lb/>

            porro in artibus, quibus similia effinguntur, nonne id ipsum inspicimus ? <lb/>

            of all things, 3 but from any thing else the least.3</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Do we not therefore say, that all music is productive <lb/>
            of resemblances and is imitative ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. When therefore any one asserts that music is to be <lb/>
            judged of by pleasure, we must receive such an assertion the <lb/>
            least of all, and seek in the least degree such music, as a <lb/>
            serious thing, if, perchance, it exists any where ; but that <lb/>
            music (rather) which possesses a resemblance to the imitation <lb/>
            of the beautiful.</p>
          <p>Clin. Most true.</p>
          <p>Athen. By those then, who are inquiring after the most <lb/>
            beautiful singing and music, there ought, as it seems, to be <lb/>
            sought not that which is pleasant, but that which is right. <lb/>
            For the rectitude of imitation, as we said, was then, when the <lb/>
            thing imitated is exhibited, as great and such as it is.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. And surely every one will allow this with respect <lb/>
            to music, that all its poetry is an imitation and resemblance. <lb/>
            And this will not all poets and auditors and players allow ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is meet then, as it seems, for a person to know in <lb/>
            the case of each poem, what it is, if he is about not to err in <lb/>
            that point. For he who does not know its being, what it <lb/>
            means, and of what it is the resemblance, will scarcely 4 under­ <lb/>
            stand the rectitude or erroneousness of its intention.</p>
          <p>Clin. Scarcely indeed ; how not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But would he, who does not know, ever be able to <lb/>
            decide upon what is well or ill (done) ? But I am not speak­ <lb/>

            what each of the imitated bodies is, would he ever know <lb/>

            thing as this, for instance, whether it has the joints1 of the <lb/>

            how many are (the joints), and of what kind, when placed near <lb/>
            to what kind, have (the parts) received their fitting arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, and moreover their colours and shapes; or whether all <lb/>
            these are worked out in a confused manner. Do you think <lb/>
            that any one can at all know these particulars, who does not <lb/>
            know what is the animal imitated ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How should he ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But what, if any one knows that the thing painted, <lb/>
            or modelled is a man, and that it has received all its parts, <lb/>
            colours, and shapes from art, is it not necessary for a person <lb/>
            knowing these facts, to know readily that too, whether it is <lb/>
            beautiful, or whether it is in any respect wanting in beauty ?</p>
          <p>Clin. We should all of us, so to say, 0 guest, have known <lb/>
            the beautiful points in animals.2</p>
          <p>Athen. You speak with perfect propriety. Is it not then <lb/>

            to possess these three things, as regards every representation <lb/>
            both in painting and music and every where ?3 In the first <lb/>
            place, to know what the thing is ; then that it is 4 rightly; and <lb/>
            then thirdly, that whatever it be of representations, it is worked <lb/>

            in what point it is difficult. For since it has been bruited <lb/>

            ations the greatest caution. For a person erring in this, will <lb/>
            be injured in the greatest degree by receiving kindly1 de­ <lb/>
            praved manners; and it is most difficult to perceive them, <lb/>
            through poets being inferior to the Muses themselves. For <lb/>
            these would never err so much as, in composing 2 the words of <lb/>
            men, to give the figure and melody of women; and on the <lb/>
            other hand in putting together the melody and gestures of <lb/>
            freemen, to fit them for the rhythms3 of slaves and the not <lb/>
            free; or, in taking as a subject the rhythms and gestures of a <lb/>
            freeman, to assign a melody or words contrary to the rhythms. <lb/>
            Moreover, they would never place together the voices of beasts <lb/>
            and men, and instruments, and every kind of noise, as imitating <lb/>
            one certain thing. But human poets, 4 interweaving things of <lb/>
            this kind very much, and mixing them together irrationally,4 <lb/>
            would produce a laugh amongst men, such, as Orpheus says, <lb/>

            ficult to know what rhythm and harmony mean without words, <lb/>
            and to which of the imitations,2 worthy of mention, they are <lb/>
            similar. But it is necessary to understand that every thing <lb/>
            of this kind is full of rusticity, 3as much as it loves swiftness <lb/>
            and not stumbling,3 and the voice of wild beasts, so as to <lb/>
            make use of playing on the hautboy and the harp, except for <lb/>
            dancing and singing. But to use either of those instruments <lb/>
            unaccompanied with words, would be wholly a non-musical <lb/>
            education, and a wonder-exciting act. In this way such <lb/>
            assertions have a reason. And we are considering not only <lb/>
            that persons of thirty years old, and those even beyond fifty, <lb/>
            ought to make use of the Muses, but in what they ought. <lb/>
            This then, for such reasons, does the discourse seem to me to <lb/>
            point out to us respecting the music of choirs, that those who <lb/>
            are fifty years old, and for whom it is suited to sing, ought to <lb/>
            be better instructed (than the others). 4 For they must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily possess a proper sensation and knowledge of rhythms <lb/>
            and harmonies. Or how shall any one know the rectitude of <lb/>
            melodies, and for what the Doric5 harmony is proper or im­ <lb/>
            proper, and of rhythm, which the poet has united to it, <lb/>
            whether it is right, or not ?</p>
          <p>Clin. It is evident he cannot by any means.</p>
          <p>Athen. But the numerous common people are ridiculous in <lb/>
            thinking that they sufficiently know what is well harmonized, <lb/>
            and in proper rhythm, and what is not so; such (at least) as <lb/>
            have been compelled to sing and walk in rhythm. But as they <lb/>
            do each of these things ignorantly, they do not reason upon them. <lb/>
            Now every melody, when it has what is fitting, is in a proper <lb/>
            state; but (when it has) what is not fitting, it is in an erring one. <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e.

            discovered, that those singers, whom we are now calling upon, <lb/>
            and, after a fashion, compel to sing voluntarily, ought from <lb/>
            necessity to be disciplined thus far, as to be able each of them <lb/>
            to follow the progressions of the rhythms, and the chords of <lb/>
            the melodies, in order that, by perceiving the harmonies and <lb/>
            the rhythms, they may be able to choose such as are fit to be <lb/>
            sung by persons of such an age, and of such a kind, and who may <lb/>
            sing thus, and by singing may themselves be immediately in­ <lb/>
            nocently delighted, and become the leaders to an adoption <lb/>
            of good manners, suited to younger persons; and being edu­ <lb/>
            cated to this point, they would take into their hands a share of <lb/>
            that more accurate discipline, which has reference to the <lb/>
            multitude, and is conversant about poets themselves. For, it <lb/>
            is by no means necessary for a composer to know the third <lb/>
            point, whether the imitation is beautiful or not. But it is nearly <lb/>
            necessary (to know) that which relates to harmony and rhythm ; <lb/>
            but for those (the elders) to know all the three, for the sake <lb/>
            of choosing the most beautiful, and the second, or else never <lb/>
            to become a sufficient enchanter of young persons towards the <lb/>
            acquisition of virtue. And thus, what our discourse intended <lb/>
            at the beginning, namely to exhibit a well-spoken support in <lb/>
            favour of the choir of Bacchus, it has spoken to the best of our <lb/>
            power. But let us consider whether this has taken place in <lb/>
            this manner. For such an assembly does of necessity ever <lb/>
            happen to become tumultuous through the drinking going for­ <lb/>

            been formed into polities ?1</p>

          <p>Athen. It would however be something endless, and im­ <lb/>
            possible (to be told).</p>
          <p>Clin. Yes, this very much so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Have not myriads upon myriads of states ex­ <lb/>
            isted during this period ? and, 3through the same ratio of the <lb/>
            length (of time)3 have there not been destroyed no fewer in <lb/>

          <p>Athen. That those, who then escaped the destruction, were <lb/>
            nearly some1 hill-shepherds, preserved on the tops (of moun­ <lb/>
            tains),2 like some slight fire-preserving (embers) of the human <lb/>
            race.</p>
          <p>Clin. It is evidently so.</p>
          <p>A then. Now such as these must surely of necessity have <lb/>
            been ignorant of the rest of the arts and contrivance of those <lb/>
            in cities towards each other, with respect to cupidity and a <lb/>
            love of quarrel, 3 and whatever other deeds of ill they had in <lb/>
            their thoughts against each other.3</p>
          <p>Clin. It is likely.</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us suppose then that the inhabited cities, which <lb/>
            were in the plains and on the sea-coast, were at that time <lb/>
            entirely destroyed.</p>
          <p>Clin. Let us suppose it.</p>
          <p>Athen. Shall we not say then, that all instruments were <lb/>
            destroyed, and that, if any thing connected with art, either in <lb/>
            politics or any other wisdom, had been carefully discovered, <lb/>
            all such were lost at that period ?</p>

            their food was not an object of contention; for of pastures <lb/>

            both amongst the Greeks and Barbarians. And even Homer <lb/>

          <p>Clin. This poet of yours appears to have been a graceful <lb/>
            one ; for we have gone through some other pieces of his, very <lb/>
            clever, but not many of them ; for we Cretans do not make a <lb/>
            very great use of foreign poems.</p>
          <p>Megil. But we do on the other hand make use of them. And <lb/>
            he seems to excel poets of this kind ; although he does not de­ <lb/>

            present indeed he appears to testify fairly to your language, <lb/>

            the gods and themselves, the more modest in the case of the more <lb/>

            according to reason, each one, after stamping his own edicts 2 <lb/>

            those of the others.</p>
          <p>Clin. It is so.</p>

            as it were, through some god ; and our discourse gives us, as it <lb/>
            were, a handle. For it has come to the colonization of Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmon, which you said was properly governed by laws fra­ <lb/>
            ternal to those in Crete. For the present then we obtain <lb/>
            something additional to this extent from the wandering of our <lb/>
            discourse, while passing through certain polities and coloni­ <lb/>
            zations. For we behold a first, a second, and a third city <lb/>
            connected with each other, as we think, by their colonizations <lb/>
            during a boundless length of time. But now this fourth city, <lb/>
            or, if you please, nation, presents itself to us, 1 which was <lb/>
            formerly colonized, and is so now.1 From all which, if we <lb/>
            are able to understand what has been colonized well or not, <lb/>
            and what laws of theirs preserve, what is preserved, and what <lb/>
            corrupt, what is corrupted, and what being changed for what <lb/>
            will render, Megillus and Clinias, a state happy, 2 (we shall think <lb/>
            that enough has been done).2 But all these matters must be <lb/>
            discussed by us, as if from the beginning, unless we have any <lb/>
            fault to find with what has been said.</p>
          <p>Megil. If, 0 guest, a god had promised us that. if we put our <lb/>
            hands a second time to the inquiry respecting legislation, we <lb/>
            should hear discourses neither worse nor fewer than those <lb/>
            already spoken, I would go a long road, and the present day <lb/>
            would appear to me to be short, although it is nearly that of <lb/>
            the god, when he is turning from the summer to the winter <lb/>
            (solstice).</p>
          <p>Athen. It is meet then, as it seems, to consider these mat­ <lb/>
            ters.</p>
          <p>Megil. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us then be present in thought at that time, <lb/>
            when Lacedæmon, and Argos, and Messéné, and the places <lb/>
            which with them were, Megillus, under the power of your <lb/>
            ancestors. 3 For then, it is said, (according to) the story,3 <lb/>
            that after having divided their army into three parts, they <lb/>
            colonized three cities, Argos, Messéné, and Lacedæmon. <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατοικιζόμενόν τέ ποτεκαὶ νυ̃ν κατῳκισμένον</foreign>. <lb/>

            now forgotten it ?</p>
          <p>Megil. How so ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Now then, we will more confirm this kind (of as­ <lb/>
            sertion). For meeting with deeds, as it seems, which have <lb/>
            occurred, we have arrived at the same discourse; so that we <lb/>
            shall not seek the same discourse respecting a vain thing, but <lb/>
            one that has occurred and possesses truth. Now this has oc­ <lb/>
            curred. Three kingdoms have made an oath with three cities <lb/>
            under a kingly government, each with each other, according <lb/>
            to the laws which they had laid down, about governing and <lb/>
            being governed in common, that one party (the rulers) should <lb/>
            not make for itself a government of violence, as time and race <lb/>
            progressed, and the other, (the ruled,) that, while the rulers <lb/>
            observed these (oonditions), they would not at any time them­ <lb/>
            selves destroy the kingly rule, nor permit others to destroy it, <lb/>
            but that the kings would defend both kings and the people <lb/>
            when injured, and the people, both kings and the people. Was <lb/>
            it not so ?</p>
          <p>Megil. It was so.</p>

          <p>Athen. That two cities should always assist1 against the <lb/>
            one, which happened to be disobedient to the laws laid down.</p>
          <p>Megil. It is evident.</p>
          <p>Athen. And yet this do the many order the lawgivers, that <lb/>
            they are to lay down such laws as the wards and the masses <lb/>
            will willingly receive ; just as if any one should order the ex­ <lb/>
            ercise-masters, or physicians, to take care of, and cure, the <lb/>
            bodies under their direction in an agreeable manner.</p>
          <p>Megil. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is however often a desirable thing, should any <lb/>
            one with no great pain be able to render bodies of a good habit <lb/>
            and in health.</p>
          <p>Megil. How not ?</p>
          <p>A then. This too, which is not a small matter towards making <lb/>
            easy the laying down of laws, was present to those of that period.</p>
          <p>Megil. What was that ?</p>
          <p>[6.] Athen. There was not to the lawgivers, while prepar­ <lb/>
            ing an equality of property, the greatest blame, and which <lb/>
            exists in many other cities regulated by laws, when any one <lb/>
            endeavours to disturb the possession of land, or to wipe out2 <lb/>
            debts, through perceiving that equality can never sufficiently <lb/>
            exist without such measures. For to the lawgiver, who en­ <lb/>
            deavours to disturb any thing of this kind, every one on meet­ <lb/>
            ing cries out, Do not move things to be not moved;3 and <lb/>
            utters curses upon him, who introduces the distributions <lb/>
            of land, and the cutting off debts, so that every man is <lb/>
            thrown into a difficulty. 4 But to the Dorians even this hap­ <lb/>
            pened successfully and without any finding fault, that both the <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus has "insurgerent," translated by Taylor rise up against." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is the English phrase equivalent to the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλύειν</foreign>, " to dis­ <lb/>

            not large and of long standing.4</p>
          <p>Megil. True.</p>
          <p>Athen. How then, ye best of men, did the colonization and <lb/>
            legislation turn out so badly to them ?</p>
          <p>Megil. How do you mean ? and for what do you blame <lb/>
            them ?</p>
          <p>Athen. That when three administrations had been estab­ <lb/>
            lished, two parts of them quickly corrupted their polity and <lb/>
            laws, and one alone, belonging to your city, remained.</p>
          <p>Megil. You ask a question not very easy (to answer).</p>
          <p>Athen. And yet it is requisite for us, while considering now <lb/>
            and examining into laws, and playing a game suited to old <lb/>
            men temperately,1 to go through the journey without annoy­ <lb/>
            ance, as we stated, when we began to enter upon it.</p>
          <p>Megil. How not ? and we must do as you say.</p>
          <p>Athen. What inquiry can we make to ourselves relating to <lb/>
            laws (in general), more beautiful than respecting those (indi­ <lb/>
            vidually) which have adorned cities of this kind ?2 or shall <lb/>
            we make an inquiry about any cities and colonizations more <lb/>
            illustrious and larger than these ?</p>
          <p>Megil. It is not easy to speak of others in preference to these.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is then nearly evident, that the persons of that <lb/>
            period conceived this arrangement would be an assistance suf­ <lb/>
            ficient not only for the Peloponnesus, but for all the Greeks, <lb/>
            if any of the Barbarians should do it any injury; 3just as <lb/>
            those, who dwelt then about Ilion, were, when trusting to the <lb/>
            power of the Assyrians, as it existed in the time of Ninus, <lb/>
            emboldened to excite war against Troy.3 For the showy <note type="footnote"> were omitted, is to be referred to the similarity of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διανέμεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια­ <lb/>

            by Diodorus, ii. 22, adds, that nothing can be stated for certain about <lb/>

            appearance1 of its government, still preserved, was by no <lb/>
            means small. (And) as we at present fear the great king, so <lb/>
            the people then feared the combination (of power) standing <lb/>
            together. For the taking of Troy a second time became a <lb/>
            great accusation against them ; because the Trojan power was <lb/>
            a portion of that (the Assyrian) government. On all these <lb/>
            accounts then, the unity of the arrangement of the army at <lb/>
            that time, divided into three states, under the brother kings, <lb/>
            the offspring of Hercules, appeared surely2 to be beautifully <lb/>
            planned and put into order, and superior to that which went <lb/>
            against Troy. For, first, they conceived that the descend­ <lb/>
            ants of Hercules were better commanders than those sprung <lb/>
            from Pelops ; and, next, that this army far surpassed in <lb/>
            valour that which came against Troy; for that these were <lb/>
            the victors, but those vanquished3 by these, the Achæans by <lb/>
            the Doriens. Do we not then conceive, that the persons of <lb/>
            that period made their arrangements with this very view ?</p>
          <p>Megil. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Is it not probable then, that they thought their <lb/>
            affairs would be in a firm state, and endure for some length­ <lb/>
            ened period, through their having shared in many dangers <lb/>
            and labours, and in being orderly governed by one race of <lb/>
            brother kings ; and in addition to this, through having made <lb/>
            use of many other prophets, and the Delphic Apollo likewise ?</p>
          <p>Megil. How is it not probable ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But all these expectations so great flew away, as <lb/>
            it seems, at that time quickly, except, as we just now said, a <lb/>
            small part around your region; and this has never ceased <lb/>

            your recollection, what, if we remember,1 was said, at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement, that it was your advice, that a good lawgiver ought <lb/>
            to lay down all laws for the sake of war; but it was mine, that <lb/>
            this would enjoin him to make laws for one virtue out of four <lb/>
            existing; that he ought to look to every virtue, but especially <lb/>
            the first, which is the leader of the whole of virtue, and that <lb/>
            is prudence, and intellect and opinion together, with love and <lb/>
            desire attendant on them. But our discourse has now re­ <lb/>
            turned again to the same point; and I now say again, what I <lb/>
            then said in jest, if you please, or in earnest, 2 that I assert then,2 <lb/>
            that it is dangerous for a person not possessing intellect to <lb/>
            pray; but that (it is better3) for the contrary to his wishes <lb/>
            to happen to him. If you are willing to suppose that I am <lb/>
            in earnest,4 suppose it. For I now fully expect to find you <lb/>
            following the reasoning we produced a little before, that <lb/>
            timidity was not the cause of the destruction of kings, and of <lb/>
            the whole of their policy; nor was it because the rulers and <lb/>
            they, whom it was meet to be ruled, did not know what re­ <lb/>
            lates to war; 5 but they were destroyed by all the remaining de­ <lb/>
            pravity,5 and especially by their ignorance respecting the great­ <lb/>
            est of human affairs. That these things thus happened at <lb/>

          <p>[9.] Athen. We say then, proceeding along the still remain­ <lb/>
            ing road of our discourse, that the greatest ignorance destroyed <lb/>
            that power at that time, and that it is naturally able to do the <lb/>
            same thing now. So that, if this be the case, the lawgiver <lb/>
            must endeavour, as far as he can, to infuse prudence into states, <lb/>
            and destroy to the utmost thoughtlessness.1</p>
          <p>Clin. It is evident.</p>
          <p>Athen. What then may be justly called the greatest ignor­ <lb/>
            ance? Consider whether you agree with me 2 in what I am <lb/>
            going to say.2 For I lay it down to be such as this.</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what kind?</p>
          <p>A then. When any one does not love, but hates that, which <lb/>
            seems to him to be beautiful, or good; but loves and embraces <lb/>
            that, which appears to him to be base and unjust, I assert that <lb/>
            this discordance, respecting pain and pleasure, with opinion <lb/>
            founded on reason, is the extreme of ignorance; and it is the <lb/>
            greatest, because it belongs to the mass of the soul. For that <lb/>
            part of the soul, which feels pain and pleasure, is what the <lb/>
            common people and the mass are in a city. When, therefore, <lb/>
            it is opposed to science, or opinions, or reason, the natural <lb/>
            rulers, I call this ignorance; and it is the same as that of a <lb/>
            city, when the multitude will not obey the rulers and the <lb/>
            laws; and likewise in the case of one man, when although <lb/>

            any good effect, but every thing, the contrary. All these kinds <note type="footnote"> 1 Although <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνοια</foreign> would be properly opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>, yet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγνοια</foreign> <lb/>

            thing connected with government is to be committed, but they <lb/>
            are to be reproached as ignorant, even though they are very <lb/>
            skil ul in argument, and have laboured at all that is elegant <lb/>
            (in language), and whatever relates to a quickness of intellect; <lb/>
            but that those, who possess qualities contrary to these, are to be <lb/>
            called wise, although they should, according to the saying, <lb/>
            2know neither their letters, nor how to swim,2 and that power <lb/>
            is tobe given to them as being prudent persons. For how, <lb/>
            friends, can the smallest form of prudence subsist without <lb/>
            symphony ? It is not possible.4 But the most beautiful and <lb/>
            greatest of symphonies may be most justly called the greatest <lb/>
            wisdom; of which he participates, who lives according to <lb/>
            reason; but he, who is deficient, is a family-destroyer, and in <lb/>
            no respect a saviour as regards the city, but, quite the contrary, <lb/>
            he will appear to be always ignorant on these points. Let this <lb/>

            is " according to nature,”1 as the Theban [Pindar] says. But <lb/>
            the greatest axiom, as it seems, would be the sixth, which <lb/>
            commands the ignorant to follow, but the prudent to lead <lb/>
            and rule. And yet, 0 thou most wise Pindar, I should almost <lb/>
            say, that this at least is not contrary to nature, but according <lb/>
            to it, for the rule of law to be over willing (subjects), and not <lb/>
            by an act of violence.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak most correctly.</p>
          <p>A then. Let us then in speaking of the seventh rule, as being <lb/>
            god-loved and fortunate, bring2 it to a lot-drawing, and say, <lb/>
            that he, on whom the lot falls, is most justly the ruler, but he <lb/>
            the ruled, who goes away, after being unsuccessful in the lot.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak most truly.</p>
          <p>Athen. We will say then, playing with some one of those <lb/>
            who go on with facility to the laying down of laws—Dost <lb/>
            thou, 0 lawgiver, see how many axioms there are relating to <lb/>
            rulers, and how they are naturally contrary to each other ? <lb/>
            For now we have discovered a certain fountain of seditions, to <lb/>
            which it is necessary for you to attend. First, consider with <lb/>
            us, by erring how and in what point, contrary to these axioms, <lb/>
            did the kings of Argos and Messéné destroy themselves, and <lb/>
            the power of the Greeks, which at that time was wonderful. <note type="footnote"> 1 On this saying of Pindar, frequently quoted by Plato, see Boeckh; <lb/>

            exists amongst the people ?</p>
          <p>Clin. It is probable that this is mostly the disease of kings, <lb/>
            who live proudly in luxury.</p>
          <p>Athen. Is not this evident then, in the first place, that the <lb/>
            kings of that time had a power above the established laws ? <lb/>
            3 and (as) to what they had praised both by word and an oath, <lb/>
            they did not accord with themselves.3 But discordance, as <lb/>

            in-; to be wisdom, has destroyed all those things through5 <lb/>
            error and a sad want of education.</p>
          <p>Clin. It appears so.</p>
          <p>A then. Be it so. But why was it meet for the lawgiver <lb/>
            then laying down laws to be cautious about the generation of <lb/>
            this disease?6 Is it, by the gods, at the present time, no <lb/>

            time, 5 if indeed they were lawgivers,5 not even the portion <lb/>

            fully. Now by shamefully I mean, not that the persons of <lb/>
            that time did not conquer by sea and land, and gain honour­ <lb/>
            able victories; but what I call shameful at that time, I say is <lb/>
            this. In the first place, that, out of those three states, (only) <lb/>
            one fought in defence of Greece, but the other two were so <lb/>
            miserably corrupted, that one of them (Messéné) prevented <lb/>
            Lacedæmon from assisting her, (Greece,) by warring against <lb/>
            it with all its strength ; but the other, which had the first <lb/>
            share at that period in the distribution, 1that about Argosy <lb/>
            did, when called upon to repel the Barbarian, neither give <lb/>
            ear nor assistance. But by detailing many things that oc­ <lb/>

            charge against Greece by no means of a pleasant kind; nor <lb/>
            would he, who should say that Greece defended herself, speak <lb/>
            correctly; since, unless the policy in common of the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans and Lacedæmonians had warded off the slavery coming <lb/>

            all the races of Greeks with each other, and Barbarians <lb/>

            itself, and that a legislator ought looking to these points, to <lb/>
            lay down laws. And let us not wonder if, after proposing <lb/>
            (other)2 things, we have frequently said that the legislator <lb/>
            ought to look to these, while laying down laws, and that what <lb/>
            have been proposed do not appear to us to be the same. But <lb/>
            it is proper to infer that, when we say the legislator ought to <lb/>
            look to temperance, or prudence, or friendship, our design is <lb/>
            not different, but the same; 3 and let not many other expres­ <lb/>

            saying with respect to friendship, and liberty, and prudence, <lb/>
            that a legislator ought to aim at those objects.5</p>
          <p>[12.] Athen. Hear then now. There are, as it were, two <lb/>
            mothers of polities, from which he, who says that all the rest <lb/>

            right to call a monarchy, but the other a democracy; and to <lb/>
            say that the race of the Persians possess the extreme of the <lb/>

            and necessary for (a state)6 to participate in both these, if <lb/>

          <p>Clin. By all means, if we wish to bring to an end what we <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Let us hear then. The Persians under Cyrus pos­ <lb/>
            sessed2 more of moderation in slavery and freedom. At first <lb/>
            they were free, but afterwards the masters of many others. <lb/>
            For by sharing as rulers their freedom with the ruled, and <lb/>
            leading them to an equality, the soldiers became greater friends <lb/>
            with their commanders, and conducted themselves with ala­ <lb/>
            crity in dangers. And if any one among them was intelligent <lb/>
            and competent to give advice, as the king was not envious, <lb/>
            and granted a liberty of speech, and honoured those, who were <lb/>
            able to advise any thing, he brought into the midst of all the <lb/>
            common power of intellect; and at that time every thing ex­ <lb/>
            hibited an improvement,3 through liberty, and friendship, and <lb/>
            a communion of intellect.</p>
          <p>Clin. It appears somehow that what has been stated did so <lb/>

            had left. After Darius (came) Xerxes, who was again brought <lb/>
            up with a royal and luxurious education. But it may be most <lb/>
            just to 2 say perhaps, " 0 Darius, thou hast not learned the evil <lb/>
            conduct of Cyrus, but hast brought up2 Xerxes in the same <lb/>
            manners, as Cyrus did Cambyses. He therefore, as being a <lb/>
            child of the same education, has brought to pass what is very <lb/>
            near to the sufferings of Cambyses; and from that time3 <lb/>
            scarcely a single Persian king has become truly great except <lb/>
            in name. Now the cause of this was not fortune, but, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to my reasoning, the vicious life, which the sons of those, <lb/>
            who were remarkably rich and tyrannical, for the most part <lb/>
            lived. For neither boy, nor man, nor old person, will ever <lb/>
            become superior in virtue from such an education." And these <lb/>
            are the matters which we say should be considered by a legis­ <lb/>
            lator, and by us likewise at present. But it is just, 0 Lace­ <lb/>

            necessarily to distribute honours and dishonours in a proper <lb/>

          <p>Athen. The inquiry into the Persian polity has caused us to <lb/>
            speak to a greater length on these points. And we find that they <lb/>
            became much worse still ; 1 and we say the reason was, that <lb/>
            through their taking away too much of liberty from the people, <lb/>
            and introducing a despotic power more than was proper, <lb/>
            they destroyed the feeling of friendship and of a common in­ <lb/>
            terest in the city ; and that, when this is destroyed, the deliber­ <lb/>
            ations of the rulers are not engaged in behalf of the governed <lb/>
            and the people, but for their own power; (and) 2 should they <lb/>
            think that something more, even if it were little, would accrue <lb/>
            to themselves, they would, by destroying with fire3 cities <lb/>
            overturned, and by (treating) friendly4 nations in an hostile <lb/>
            and unpitying manner, at once hate and be hated.5 But when <lb/>
            they come to the people during a time of need to fight for <lb/>
            them, they find in them no such communion of interest, 6that <lb/>
            any one is willing with alacrity 6 to run a risk and to fight; and <lb/>
            though they possess myriads, not to be defined in a calculation, <lb/>
            yet they are all useless for war; and, as if in want of men, <lb/>
            they hire some, and think they will be saved by mercenary <lb/>
            and foreign troops; and added to this, they are compelled to <lb/>
            act the part of simpletons, proclaiming by their acts,7 that the <lb/>
            things constantly called honourable or beautiful in a state are <lb/>

          <p>Athen. But after this it is proper for us to go through in a <lb/>
            similar manner the polity of Attica, 1 (that it may appear)1 how <lb/>
            perfect liberty even, exempt from all rule, is not a little worse <lb/>
            than that, which has a moderation 2in rule under others.2 <lb/>
            For at the time, when the Persian invasion took place against <lb/>
            the Greeks, and perhaps against almost all the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Europe, our polity had been of long standing; and we had some <lb/>
            four institutions framed with reference to a property-census ;3 <lb/>
            and a certain modesty too at that time was a despot, through <lb/>
            which we were then willing to live in subjection to the laws. In <lb/>
            addition to this, the magnitude of the expedition, extending over <lb/>
            land and sea, brought on a fear not to be overcome, and caused <lb/>
            us to endure a still greater submission to the rulers and the laws. <lb/>
            And on all these accounts a violent friendship came upon us <lb/>
            towards ourselves. For nearly ten years before the naval <lb/>
            battle at Salamis, Datis had arrived, leading the Persian ex­ <lb/>
            pedition of Darius, who had sent him distinctly against the <lb/>
            Athenians and Eretrians, to reduce them to slavery, and to <lb/>
            carry them off; and proclaiming 4 death to him, if he did not <lb/>
            do so. And Datis did in a very short time with his many <lb/>
            myriads and by main force subdue them entirely; 5 and he <lb/>
            sent a certain dreadful report to our city,5 that not one of the <lb/>
            Eretrians had escaped him; for that the soldiers of Datis <lb/>
            had by joining hands to hands 6got, as into a net, the whole <lb/>
            of Eretria.6 This report, whether arriving true or in any way <lb/>
            whatever, struck with terror the other Greeks, and the <lb/>
            Athenians likewise; and on their sending ambassadors every <note type="footnote"> 1—1 So Taylor, from " ut pateat " in Ficinus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 The Greek is in one MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχη̃ς ὑφ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρων</foreign>.

            where,1 no one was willing to assist them, except the Lacedæ­ <lb/>

            Messéné, or whether something else, as alleged,2 prevented <lb/>
            them,-for we know not,-arrived one day later than the battle <lb/>
            that took place at Marathon. After this, mighty preparations <lb/>
            and innumerable threats are said to have come from the king. <lb/>
            But as time went on, Darius was reported to have died, and his <lb/>
            son, young and violent, to have received from him the govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and by no means to have desisted from his (father's)3 un­ <lb/>
            dertaking. Now the Athenians were of opinion, that the whole <lb/>
            of this preparation was against themselves, on account of what <lb/>
            had occurred at Marathon; and hearing of Athos being dug <lb/>
            through, and of (the shores) of the Hellespont being united, and <lb/>
            of the great number of the vessels, they thought there was no <lb/>
            safety for themselves by land or sea; 4 for that none would assist <lb/>
            them ; as they recollected that, even when (the Persians) had <lb/>
            come before, and had done thoroughly for the Eretrians, not one <lb/>
            had given them assistance then,4 or had run a risk by fighting <lb/>
            with them ; and they expected the same thing would then take <lb/>
            place, at least by land ; and on the other hand, by sea they saw <lb/>
            a want of all means of safety, since more than a thousand ships <lb/>
            were being brought against them. They thought, however, <lb/>
            upon a single source of safety, slender indeed and dubious, <lb/>
            yet the only one, through their looking to what had previously <lb/>
            occurred, how even then victory had appeared to spring out <lb/>
            of difficulties, as they were fighting.5 Carried along upon <lb/>
            this hope, they found their refuge rested in themselves <lb/>
            alone and in the gods. All these things then 6 engendered in <lb/>
            them a friendship 6 with each other, both the fear which was <lb/>
            then present, and that which had been produced by the laws <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus alone adds, what Taylor adopts, "universam Græciam—” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plato alludes to the reason assigned by Herodotus vi. 106. See other <lb/>

            great progress made in a life of freedom. For music was then <lb/>
            divided by us according to certain kinds and figures of itself; 1 <lb/>
            and prayers to the gods was a kind of ode, and they were called <lb/>
            by the name of hymns; and the contrary to this was another <lb/>
            kind of ode, and a person would have called it lamentations <lb/>
            for the most part ;2 and another was Pæans,3 and another the <lb/>
            birth of Dionysus, called, I think,4 a Dithyramb: and they <lb/>
            have called laws5 by this very name, as being another ode; <lb/>
            and they have given the additional name of "harp music. <lb/>
            After these and some others had been ordained, it was not <lb/>
            lawful to use one kind for another. But the authority to <lb/>

            the admonition by a rod putting them in order. These things <lb/>
            having been thus ordained,1 the multitude of citizens were <lb/>
            willing to be ruled, and not to dare to judge in a tumultuous <lb/>
            manner. After this, as time went on, the poets (themselves) <lb/>
            became the leaders of this uneducated lawlessness ; being na­ <lb/>
            turally indeed poetical, but ignorant with respect to what is just <lb/>
            and lawful in music, they were acting like Bacchants, and <lb/>
            possessed with joy more than was becoming, and were ming­ <lb/>
            ling lamentations with hymns, and pæans with dithyrambs, <lb/>
            and imitated with harp music the music of the hautboy, and by <lb/>
            bringing together all things to all they involuntarily, through <lb/>
            their ignorance, asserted falsely that music did not possess any <lb/>
            correctness whatever; but that it might be judged of most <lb/>
            correctly by the pleasure of the party gratified, whether he <lb/>
            were a better person or a worse. Composing, therefore, works <lb/>
            of this kind, and adding to them words of this kind, they in­ <lb/>
            fused into the multitude a lawlessness with respect to music, <lb/>
            and a daring of their being competent to judge. Hence the­ <lb/>
            atres, from being silent, came to be noisy, as if capable of un­ <lb/>
            derstanding what is beautiful or not in music; and instead of <lb/>
            an aristocracy in it, a certain depraved theatrocracy was pro­ <lb/>
            duced. For if only a democracy of free men had existed, <lb/>
            nothing very dreadful would have taken place; but now from <lb/>
            music there began an opinion with us respecting the wisdom of <lb/>
            all men in all things, and a lawlessness, and after these did a li­ <lb/>
            centiousness follow. For men became fearless, as if endued with <lb/>
            knowledge; and this absence of fear generated shamelesness. <lb/>
            For through boldness to feel no fear of the opinion of a better <lb/>
            person, is almost a depraved shamelessness, (resulting) from a <lb/>

              we were considering which of these is rightly administered. <lb/>
              But on laying hold of each of them, as regards1 a certain mo­ <lb/>
              deration, on the part of some to be despots, and of others to be <lb/>
              free, we saw that then (in moderation) prosperity resulted to <lb/>
              them in an eminent degree, but that when each party was <lb/>
              proceeding to the extreme, the one, of slavery, and the other, <lb/>
              of the contrary, no benefit had accrued to either these or those.</p>
          <p>Megil. You speak most true.</p>
          <p>A then. And moreover, for the sake of these things, we <lb/>
            looked into both the Doric army, and the country under the <lb/>
            Dardan mountains, and the settlement by the sea, and first <lb/>
            those persons who remained after the deluge; and moreover <lb/>
            we had a previous conversation about music and drunkenness, <lb/>
            and on subjects still prior to these. For all this has been men­ <lb/>

            proof of error can be brought, Megillus and Clinias, against us ?</p>
          <p>Clin. I seem to myself, 0 guest, to have something in my <lb/>
            mind. For it appears that the subjects of all the discourse, we <lb/>
            have gone through, have arisen through some good fortune. For <lb/>
            I have come almost in want of them at the present moment; <lb/>
            and both you and Megillus here are by some opportune acci­ <lb/>
            dent present. For I will not conceal from you what has just <lb/>
            now occurred to me, but I will make it a kind of omen. For <lb/>
            the greatest part of Crete is attempting at present to establish <lb/>
            a certain colony, and orders the Cnossians to take the care of <lb/>
            the matter; but the city of the Cnossians (imposes it) upon me <lb/>
            and nine others; and at the same time orders us to lay down <lb/>
            laws (taken) from this place, if any are pleasing to us, and, if <lb/>
            there are any, from elsewhere, making no account of their fo­ <lb/>
            reign character, should they appear to be better. Let us then <lb/>
            grant this favour2 to myself and you. 3 After making a <lb/>
            selection out of what has been said,3 let us in our discourse <lb/>
            form a state, and colonize it, as if from its commencement; <note type="footnote"> 1 By simply inserting <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς</foreign> between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκατέρας</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετριότητα</foreign> I have re­ <lb/>

            we are in search of, and at the same time I may perhaps make <lb/>
            use of this formation for the city that is to be.</p>
          <p>Athen. You are not, 0 guest, proclaiming a war. And, <lb/>
            unless there is some opposition on the part of Megillus, con­ <lb/>
            ceive that every thing on my side will be to the best of my <lb/>
            power according to your mind.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak well.</p>
          <p>Megil. And on my side likewise.</p>

          <p>[1.] Athen. COME then, what kind of state must we imagine <lb/>
            it is to be ? 1 I mean that I am not asking what is its name now, <lb/>
            nor what it will be necessary to call it in after-time ;1 for this <lb/>
            perhaps its colonization, or some spot, or the surname of some <lb/>
            river or fountain, or of the gods of the place, may give their <lb/>
            own appellation to the new state; but this is rather what I <lb/>
            wish to ask concerning it, whether it is near the sea, or inland ?</p>
          <p>Clin. The state, of which we are now speaking, is, 0 guest, <lb/>
            distant from the sea nearly eighty stadia.2</p>
          <p>Athen. Are there any harbours along it, or is it entirely <lb/>
            harbourless ?</p>
          <p>CUn. It has, as far as is possible, very good harbours, 0 guest.</p>
          <p>Athen. Ho! ho! What say you ? But is the country <lb/>
            about it likewise all-prolific, or is it wanting in some things ?</p>
          <p>Clin. It is nearly in want of nothing.</p>
          <p>Athen. Will there be any neighbouring state near to it ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Not very; on which account it is colonized. For an <lb/>
            expulsion of the inhabitants having taken place of old in that <lb/>
            spot, caused the country to be desolate for an immense space <lb/>
            of time.</p>
          <p>Athen. But with respect to plains, and mountains, and <lb/>
            woods, how has it obtained by lot a portion of each ? <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Ficinus, translated literally by Taylor, has merely " neque vero <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Would you say it is more rough than plain ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is not therefore incurably unfit for the acquisition <lb/>
            of virtue. For, if it were near the sea, and had good harbours, <lb/>
            but not all-productive, but wanting in many things, it would <lb/>
            require for itself some powerful preserver, and certain divine <lb/>
            lawgivers,2 unless being such naturally, it had been about to <lb/>
            acquire2 many various and depraved manners.3 But now it has <lb/>
            some consolation from its distance of eighty stadia. It is situ­ <lb/>
            ated indeed nearer the sea than is becoming, by nearly as much <lb/>
            that it has, as you state, good harbours. There is however this <lb/>
            desirable circumstance. For a sea, being near to a country, <lb/>
            4 brings something4 pleasant each day, although it is in reality <lb/>
            a very brackish and bitter neighbour.5 For filling it through <lb/>
            6retail-trading with foreign commerce6 and money-making, <lb/>
            it begets in the disposition a moral conduct tost backwards and <lb/>
            forwards,7 and not to be trusted, and (renders) the state faith­ <lb/>
            less and unfriendly to itself and to other nations likewise. It <lb/>
            possesses however against these evils a consolation in being <lb/>
            all-productive ; since if it were rugged, it is evident that it <lb/>
            would not be 8 very productive and all-productive at the same <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus has " totius Cretæ,” as if his MS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄλης</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅλη</foreign> <lb/>

            not much cypress; and a person would find little of larch, <lb/>
            or plane-trees, which it is necessary for shipwrights to make <lb/>

            easily its enemies in mischievous imitations.</p>

            virtue, it was well; but when1 only to a part, but not to the <lb/>
            whole almost of virtue, I did not entirely agree. Do you then <lb/>
            still again watch 2 my present3 legislation, while following me, <lb/>
            if perchance I lay down any law not tending to virtue, or <lb/>
            to a part of virtue. For I make it a fundamental position, <lb/>
            that he alone lays down a law correctly, who, like an <lb/>
            archer, ever aims at that, on which alone some of those things <lb/>
            that are ever beautiful4 follow close, but who leaves all the <lb/>
            rest, whether it be wealth or any thing else of that kind, <lb/>
            which happens to exist without those before mentioned. And I <lb/>
            said on one side, that the imitation of enemies would be then5 <lb/>
            mischievous, when any one residing near the sea is annoyed by <lb/>
            enemies, as for instance—for I will relate (it) to you, although <lb/>
            not wishing to remind you of a past annoyance-when Minos <lb/>
            imposed the payment of a tribute upon the inhabitants of At­ <lb/>
            tica, through his having acquired a great power by sea.6 But <lb/>
            the Athenians did not at that period possess, as they do now, <lb/>
            ships of war, nor a country abounding in wood, suited for <lb/>
            ship-building, so as to exhibit with facility a naval power. <lb/>
            Hence they could not, through nautical imitation, become im­ <lb/>
            mediately sailors themselves at that time, and defend them­ <lb/>
            selves against their enemies. And it would have been for <lb/>

            it is surely possible to understand this from Homer, that such <lb/>

            says, (II. xiv. 96,) <lb/>

            saved us at that time ; for to the naval battle at Salamis I will <lb/>
            add the one at Artemisium. But now, looking to the virtue of <lb/>
            a polity, let us consider the nature of the region, and the order <lb/>
            of the laws ; not thinking, as the many do, that to be preserved <lb/>
            and to exist is alone to mankind the most honourable of all <lb/>
            things, but to become the best, and to continue to be so, for <lb/>
            as long a period as they may live. But this, I think, has been <lb/>
            stated by us in the former part of our discourse.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us then consider this alone, whether we are <lb/>

          <p>[3.] Athen. Tell me, then, what is next in order to this, what <lb/>
            are the people, who are to be the colonists; whether any one <lb/>
            ( may go), who is willing from the whole of Crete, since the <lb/>
            masses have become in the cities more numerous than according <lb/>
            to the quantity of food to be got from the land ? For you surely <lb/>
            do not bring together whoever of the Greeks is willing (to go). <lb/>
            And yet I see that some persons from Argos, and Ægina, and <lb/>
            other parts of Greece, have settled themselves in the country <lb/>
            amongst you. But for the present, tell me, from whence do <lb/>
            you say there will be an army of citizens ?</p>
          <p>Clin. It seems it will be from the whole of Crete; and <lb/>
            of the rest of the Greeks it appears that (the colonizers) will <lb/>
            receive persons from Peloponnesus, as fellow-settlers for the <lb/>
            most part. For, what you were saying just now, you said <lb/>
            truly, that there are some from Argos, and the race, which has <lb/>
            the highest character here at present, is that of Gortyna, be­ <lb/>
            cause it happens to have settled there I from Gortyna in the <lb/>
            Peloponnesus.</p>

            in states with equal facility, when one family, like a swarm of <lb/>
            bees, going from one country settles down, friends from friends, <lb/>
            after having been, as it were, besieged by a certain want of <lb/>
            space, or compelled by some other sufferings of a similar kind. <lb/>
            For it sometimes happens that a part of a city is forcibly <lb/>
            driven out by seditions and compelled to migrate as strangers to <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτης</foreign> Ficinus found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτη̩</foreign>—At least his ver­ <lb/>

            some other spot; and sometimes a whole city has exiled itself, <lb/>
            after being thoroughly vanquished in war. In all these cases <lb/>
            then it is easy for one to be colonized and governed by laws, <lb/>
            but difficult for another. For when a colony is of one race, <lb/>
            and has the same language, and the same laws, it possesses a <lb/>
            kind of friendship, as being a partaker in the same holy rites, <lb/>
            and every thing else of a similar kind, nor does it easily en­ <lb/>
            dure other laws, and a polity foreign to what it had at home. <lb/>
            And sometimes a colony, having revolted through the badness <lb/>
            of its laws, and through custom still seeking to adopt the very <lb/>
            same habits as those, by which it was previously corrupted, be­ <lb/>
            comes refractory and disobedient to its colonizer and legislator. <lb/>
            But on the other hand a colony, composed of all kinds of <lb/>
            people flowing together to the same point, will perhaps be <lb/>
            more willingly obedient to certain new laws; but to conspire <lb/>
            together, and, like a pair of horses to froth together,1 as the <lb/>
            saying is, individually to the same point, is the work of a long <lb/>
            time and very difficult. Nevertheless legislation and the <lb/>

              " returning," could hardly be said here; for the subject of the laws had <lb/>

              unimportant. But if we shall say aught opportunely, it would <lb/>
              be no matter. And yet why do I feel a difficulty ? for nearly <lb/>
              all human affairs appear to exist in this manner.</p>
          <p>CUn. Of what are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Athen. I was about to say, that no man is ever a legislator ; <lb/>
            but that fortune and all kinds of accidents, happening in all <lb/>
            kinds of ways, are our legislators. For either a war by vio­ <lb/>
            lence has overturned polities and changed laws, or the want of <lb/>
            means arising from severe poverty. Many innovations too <lb/>
            diseases compel men to make, through pestilences falling <lb/>
            upon them, and unfavourable seasons during many years. <lb/>
            He then, who foresees all this, will be eager1 to exclaim, as I <lb/>
            just now did, that no mortal was ever a legislator, but that <lb/>
            nearly all human affairs are accidents ; and that it is possible <lb/>
            for him, who asserts all this respecting navigation, and the <lb/>
            arts of the pilot, and physician, and general, to appear to speak <lb/>
            correctly. But on the other hand, it is equally possible for <lb/>
            the person (to appear) to speak correctly on these points, who <lb/>
            says this.</p>
          <p>Clin. What?</p>
          <p>Athen. That a god, and, together with a god, fortune and <lb/>
            opportunity govern all human affairs ; but that it is necessary <lb/>
            to admit that art, a somewhat milder power, follows them. <lb/>
            For on the occasion of a storm I should consider it a thing of <lb/>
            great moment for the pilot's art to take a part, or not. Or <lb/>
            how (say you) ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Thus.</p>
          <p>Athen. Will not the same reasoning apply similarly in the <lb/>
            case of other things ? And we must attribute the very same <lb/>
            principle to legislation ; that, other things concurring which <lb/>
            ought to happen to a country, if it is about to live happily, <lb/>
            it is requisite for a legislator, who adheres to truth, to fall <lb/>
            on each occasion upon a state of such a kind.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak most true.</p>
          <p>Athen. Would not he then, who possesses an art for each of <lb/>
            the above-mentioned occasions, be justly able3 to pray for <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀι̐ξειεν</foreign> Ficinus seems to have found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξιώσειεν</foreign>, <lb/>

            he be wanting 2 only in art ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. And all the rest just now mentioned would, if com­ <lb/>
            manded to tell their prayers, say so. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. And a legislator likewise would, I think, do the same.</p>
          <p>Clin. So I think.</p>
          <p>A then. Come then, Legislator, (and say)—for let us address <lb/>
            him—a city possessing what, and being in what state, shall <lb/>
            we give you, 3 and you take and hold,3 so that you may admin­ <lb/>
            ister sufficiently, from the things remaining,4 the city ? What <lb/>
            is it possible to assert rightly after this ? 5 Shall we not <lb/>
            say surely something belonging to the legislator ? For it is <lb/>
            meet.5</p>
          <p>Clin. It is.</p>
          <p>Athen. This. Give me a city governed by a tyrant, he <lb/>
            will say; and let the tyrant be a young man, of a good me­ <lb/>
            mory, and docile, and brave, and naturally of a magnificent <lb/>
            disposition ; and let that, which, we said before, ought to fol­ <lb/>
            low all the parts of virtue, now accompany the soul of the <lb/>
            tyrant, if there is about to be any benefit from the presence of <lb/>
            the other qualities.</p>
          <p>Clin. Our guest, Megillus, appears to me to say that tem­ <lb/>
            perance should follow the other virtues. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Yes, temperance, Clinias, in its popular sense, and <lb/>
            not that, which any one in solemn phrase would call pru­ <lb/>
            dence, and compel it to be temperance; but that feeling <lb/>

              on the instant, so that some are incontinent1 with respect to <lb/>
              pleasures, but others continent; and which we said,2 when it <lb/>
              exists apart from the many things called good, is not worth <lb/>
              mention. For you understand what I am saying ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Perfectly.</p>
          <p>Athen. This nature, then, let our tyrant possess in addition <lb/>
            to those (mentioned above), if the city is about to have a <lb/>
            polity in the quickest and best manner possible, and on the re­ <lb/>
            ceiving of which it may live the most happily. For there nei­ <lb/>
            ther is, nor will there ever be, the establishment of a polity <lb/>
            more rapid or better than this.</p>
          <p>Clin. But how, 0 guest, and by what argument would anyone, <lb/>
            who asserts this, persuade himself that he is speaking correctly ?</p>
          <p>Athen. It is easy, Clinias, to understand how this is so <lb/>
            naturally.</p>
          <p>Clin. How say you ? Do you assert,3 if the tyrant is a young <lb/>
            man, temperate, docile, of a good memory, brave, (and) mag­ <lb/>
            nificent ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Add too fortunate in nothing else, except in that <lb/>
            during his time a legislator is existing worthy of praise, and <lb/>
            that a certain fortune leads the two to the same point. For, on <lb/>
            this taking place, there is brought to pass by a god nearly every <lb/>
            thing which (is done), when he wishes any state to be emi­ <lb/>

            from a tyranny, in conjunction with a superior legislator and <lb/>
            a well-regulated tyrant; and that it would most easily and <lb/>
            rapidly change 1 into that from such a kind as this; 1 and that <lb/>
            the second in degree is from an oligarchy ; and 2 the third in <lb/>
            degree, from a democracy. Is it not so ? 2</p>
          <p>Athen. By no means. But the first is produced from a <lb/>
            tyranny; the second, from a regal polity; the third, from a <lb/>
            certain democracy ; but with respect to the fourth, an oligar­ <lb/>
            chy would be able to receive a generation of this kind with <lb/>
            the utmost difficulty. For in it there are the greatest num­ <lb/>
            ber of the powerful. Now we say, that these things then take <lb/>
            place, when a legislator is naturally true, and when there ex­ <lb/>
            ists in him a strength in common with those, who possess the <lb/>
            greatest influence in the state. But where this exists the <lb/>
            fewest in number, but at the same time the most strong, as in <lb/>
            the case of a tyranny, in this way and then there is wont to <lb/>
            take place a rapidity and easiness in the change.</p>
          <p>Clin. How ? For we do not understand.</p>
          <p>A then. And yet I think this has been said by us, not once, <lb/>
            but often. But perhaps you never saw a state under a tyrant.</p>
          <p>Clin. Nor am I desirous of such a spectacle.</p>
          <p>Athen. And yet you may see it in the one just now spoken of.</p>
          <p>Clin. What?</p>
          <p>Athen. That the tyrant, who wishes to change the habits of <lb/>
            a state, has no need either of (great) 3 labour, or any very long <lb/>
            time for the accomplishment of his purpose. For4 it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that he should proceed the first in whatever road he <lb/>
            wishes, either to turn the citizens to the pursuit of virtue, or <lb/>
            the contrary, and mark out the course by acting himself the <lb/>
            first, and praising and honouring some things, but bringing a <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς του̃το ἐκ του̃ τοιούτου</foreign>, which I hardly under­ <lb/>

            blame upon others, and disgracing the party that is disobedi­ <lb/>
            ent in each of these doings.</p>
          <p>Clin. And how can we imagine that the other citizens <lb/>
            will quickly follow him, who has obtained such persuasion, <lb/>
            and at the same time force ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Let no one persuade us, friends, that a state has <lb/>
            ever changed 2 its laws more quickly and easily by any other <lb/>
            way than the leading of its rulers, or that this happens now <lb/>
            by any other means, or will happen ever again. For that <lb/>
            indeed is neither impossible for us, nor would it be done with <lb/>
            difficulty. But this is the thing difficult to be done, and has <lb/>
            rarely taken place in a long time; although, when it does <lb/>
            happen, it produces in the state, in which it is found, ten <lb/>
            thousand, or rather every good thing.</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Athen. When a divine love of temperate and just pursuits <lb/>
            is inherent in certain mighty powers, whether they rule ac­ <lb/>
            cording to a monarchy, or a marked superiority in wealth or <lb/>
            family, or should any one bring back the nature of Nestor, <lb/>
            who they say excelled all men in the power of speaking, and <lb/>
            still more in temperance. But this, as they say, took place in <lb/>
            the times of Troy, but in ours not at all. If then such a man <lb/>
            existed formerly, or shall exist, or is at present amongst us, he <lb/>
            lives in a blessed state, and blessed too are those, who hear <lb/>
            the words proceeding from his temperate mouth. Of a similar <lb/>
            kind is the reasoning respecting all power, that, when the <lb/>
            greatest power of a man falls to the same point with the acting <lb/>
            prudently and temperately, then the production of the best <lb/>
            polity and of such kind of laws takes place, but otherwise it <lb/>
            will never be. Let this then be held to be spoken oracularly, <lb/>
            as if it were a story detailed,3 and to have been shown, that <lb/>
            in one way it is difficult for a state to have good laws, and in <lb/>
            another, that, if what we have said should take place, it would <lb/>
            have them in a manner the quickest and the easiest by far. <note type="footnote"> 1 One MS. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανταχου̃ μέγα οἰόμεθα</foreign>, similar to " ubiquc magnum <lb/>

            the Ephori in it is wonderfully tyrannical. And yet it some­ <lb/>
            times appears to me to be the most similar of all states to a <lb/>
            democracy. But, on the other hand, not to say that it is an <lb/>
            aristocracy, is perfectly absurd. There is in it likewise the <lb/>

              Plato had an eye to Alcibiades, who used to pride himself upon his <lb/>

              for his insolent bearing, than for the high opinion he entertained of <lb/>
              his talents as a statesman. With regard to the language, it is quite evi­ <lb/>

              he, who is lifted up by high-boasting, exalting himself through <lb/>
              his riches, or honours, or the fine form of his body, and having <lb/>
              from his youthfulness and thoughtlessness his soul inflamed <lb/>
              with insolence, as one who is in no need of either a ruler or a <lb/>
              leader, but competent to lead even others, is left, deserted by <lb/>
              the deity; and being thus left, and falling in with others of a <lb/>
              similar kind, he leaps about, when he throws all things into <lb/>
              confusion together; and to many indeed he appears to be some­ <lb/>
              body ; but in no long time afterwards suffers a punishment, <lb/>
              which justice would not blame, and causes himself and family <lb/>
              and city to be utterly destroyed.3 With regard then to these <lb/>
              matters thus disposed in order, what must a prudent man do, <lb/>
              or think, and what must he not ?</p>
          <p>Clin. This at least is plain, that every man ought to think <lb/>
            how he may be one of those, who are to follow the deity.</p>
          <p>[8.] Athen. What manner of acting then is dear to and <lb/>
            attendant upon the deity ? There is one, which possesses one <lb/>
            reason of old, that the similar will be friendly to the similar, <lb/>
            when it is moderate; but that the immoderate are neither <lb/>
            friendly to each other nor to the moderate. Now the deity <lb/>
            will be especially the measure to us of all things, and much <lb/>
            more than, as persons say, a man.2 He then, who is to be­ <lb/>
            come friendly to a nature of this kind, must necessarily become <lb/>
            such to the utmost of his power. And, according to this <lb/>
            reasoning, our temperate man is dear to the deity, for he is <lb/>
            similar to him. But the intemperate man is dissimilar, and <lb/>
            at variance (with the deity), and unjust; and the rest of in­ <lb/>
            stances are by the same reasoning affected in this way. Let <lb/>
            us then consider that language of this kind is to follow these <lb/>
            premises, (language) I think the most beautiful, and the most <lb/>
            true of all, namely, that for a good man to sacrifice to, and be <lb/>
            conversant ever3 with, the gods, 4by means of prayers, and <figure type="illustration">

              life, and moreover pre-eminently becoming ; but to the wicked <lb/>
              man the contraries of these naturally happen. For the wicked <lb/>
              man is unpurified in his soul, but the contrary one is pure ; <lb/>
              and to receive gifts from a defiled person is not at all correct <lb/>
              for either a good man or a god.1 To the unholy then there is <lb/>
              much labour in vain respecting the gods; but it is the most <lb/>
              seasonable to all holy men. Such then is the mark at which <lb/>

              what are called the arrows of a person, and what is the shoot­ <lb/>
              in- out by thought, as it were by arrows ?2 We assert, in the <lb/>
              first place, that he, who gives after the Olympian gods, and those <lb/>
              who preside over the city, as honours to the terrestrial gods, <lb/>
              the things of an even number, 3 and secondary, and on the left <lb/>
              hand,3 will in the most proper manner reach the mark of <lb/>
              piety ; but to the gods above these, things of an odd number, <lb/>
              and those that signify the opposite to what have been just <lb/>
              now mentioned. And after these gods a prudent person will <lb/>
              celebrate the holy rites of Daemons, and after them of Heroes. <lb/>
              And after them follow the statues of the household gods, <lb/>

          <p>[9.] Athen. What then has been now said appears to me to <lb/>
            effect something of moment towards a person listening with a <lb/>
            greater mildness and a kinder feeling to what the words re­ <lb/>
            commend, provided they do not come in contact with a dispo­ <lb/>
            sition altogether savage; so that should what the words say <lb/>
            render the person, who has become if not very much, yet a <lb/>
            little more kindly disposed, more docile, we must be quite <lb/>
            content. For there is no great facility1 nor an abundance of <lb/>
            those, who feel a desire to become the best to the greatest de­ <lb/>
            gree and in the shortest time; and the many point out Hesiod <lb/>
            as a wise person for asserting that the road to wickedness is <lb/>
            smooth, and offers itself to be passed through without sweat, <lb/>
            as being very short; but (says he)</p>
          <p>" Th' immortal gods have before virtue placed <lb/>
            The sweat of labour, and the road is long <lb/>
            And steep, that to it leads. At first 'tis rough ; <lb/>
            But when you reach the top, 'tis easy all,2 <lb/>

            For they would not know, that by saying what is contrary to <lb/>
            the laws, they would injure the state.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak truly.</p>
          <p>Athen. If then we should speak in this manner to him in <lb/>
            behalf of the poets, would what has been said be in modera­ <lb/>
            tion ?</p>
          <p>Clin. In what manner ?</p>
          <p>A then. In this. There is an old story, 0 legislator, which is <lb/>
            constantly told by ourselves, and seems correct to all the rest, <lb/>
            that a poet, when he sits on the tripod of the Muse, is then not <lb/>
            in his right senses, but, like a fountain, readily permits what <lb/>
            comes to it to flow out:1 and as his art is an imitation, he is <lb/>
            (often) compelled, when representing persons placed in situa­ <lb/>
            tions contrary to each other, to contradict himself frequently, <lb/>
            and does not know whether of what is told these or the others are <lb/>
            true. But it is not possible for a legislator to act in this man­ <lb/>
            ner in the case of a law, namely 2 (to say) two (different) things <lb/>
            about one thing ;2 but he must always make one assertion about <lb/>
            one thing. And do you so consider it from what has been <lb/>
            said just now. For in the case of a funeral, one being exces­ <lb/>
            sive, and another deficient, and a third moderate, you, having <lb/>
            chosen one of these, the moderate, order it, and simply praise <lb/>
            it. But if my wife were pre-eminently rich, and should order <lb/>
            me to bury her, 31 would celebrate in a poem her magnificent <lb/>
            sepulchre;3 but on the other hand, a parsimonious and poor <lb/>
            man (would praise) a deficient one; but he who possesses <lb/>
            moderate means, and is moderate himself (in mind), would <lb/>
            praise a moderate one. But you must not talk, as you did just <lb/>
            now, when speaking of the moderate; but you must tell us <lb/>
            what the moderate is, and of what quantity it is; or do not <lb/>
            imagine that a discourse of this kind is a law. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated, as if the Greek were not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκϱε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, similar to <lb/>

            for whom the laws are laid down?1 2But as in the case of <lb/>

            correctly, seem to be laid down for correct conduct in every <lb/>
            state.</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us then first speak of the simple law, which <lb/>
            would perhaps exist somehow in this way ; that a man is to <lb/>
            marry when he is from thirty to thirty-five years old; but if <lb/>
            he does not, that he should be fined both in money and with <lb/>
            the loss of political privileges;1 in money to this or that <lb/>
            amount, and in disfranchisement of this or that kind. Let <lb/>
            this then be the simple law respecting marriages; but this <lb/>
            the twofold; that a man is to marry from thirty to thirty-five <lb/>
            years old, considering that the human race has in some mea­ <lb/>
            sure partaken naturally of immortality, of which every one <lb/>
            has naturally every desire.2 For to become famous, and not <lb/>
            to lie when dead without a name, is the desire of a person of <lb/>
            this kind. The human race then is a thing connected with all <lb/>
            time, and follows and will follow it to the end, becoming in <lb/>
            this manner immortal through that, which is ever the same <lb/>
            and one, partaking by generation of immortality, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of its leaving3 children's children. Now for a man to <lb/>
            deprive himself willingly of this, is by no means holy; and <lb/>
            he intentionally deprives himself of this, who has no care for <lb/>
            children and a wife. He, therefore, who obeys this Jaw <lb/>
            would depart without a fine. But let him, on the other hand, <lb/>
            who does not obey it, and does not marry when he is thirty- <lb/>
            five years of age, be fined yearly so and so, in order that his <lb/>
            solitary life may not seem to bring him gain and an easy <lb/>
            state ; nor let him share in those honours, which the younger <lb/>
            in the state pay on every occasion to the elder. It is then in <lb/>
            the power of a person, who hears this law compared with <lb/>
            that, to form an idea of each particular law, whether it ought <lb/>

            a judge of such enactments, which of the two I would wish to <lb/>
            be written and laid down for a state, I would prefer the longer; <lb/>
            and as regards every law according to this model, if two such <lb/>
            were proposed, I should make the same choice. It is, how­ <lb/>
            ever, requisite that the present legislation should be agreeable <lb/>
            to Clinias; for his is the state, which is now thinking of <lb/>
            making use of laws of this kind.</p>
          <p>Clin. Well have you spoken, Megillus.</p>
          <p>[12.] Athen. To take any account of enactments either <lb/>
            prolix or brief is very silly. 1 For we must honour, I con­ <lb/>
            ceive, the best, but not the shortest, nor (look to) their length.1 <lb/>
            But, in the laws which we have just now spoken of, one dif­ <lb/>
            fers from the other not by the double alone as regards the <lb/>
            value of their use; but that, which was said just now, re­ <lb/>
            specting the twofold kind of physicians, was most properly <lb/>
            adduced. To this point however no legislator seems at any <lb/>
            time to have given a thought, that, when it is possible to make <lb/>
            use of two things in legislation, persuasion and force, they <lb/>
            employ the other alone,2 as far as is possible, against the <lb/>
            masses unexperienced in education. For they legislate, not <lb/>
            mingling a fight3 with force, but (employing) unmingled vio­ <lb/>
            lence alone. But I, 0 blessed men, perceive that a third thing <lb/>
            likewise ought to exist with regard to laws, but which does <lb/>
            not exist at present.</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what kind are you speaking ?</p>

            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. c. 12. </note> <lb/>
            from the time when we began to speak about laws in the <lb/>
            morning, mid-day has now arrived ; and we have been in this <lb/>
            very beautiful retreat discoursing upon no other topic than <lb/>
            laws. But we seem to me to be just now beginning to speak <lb/>
            about laws ; and that all before has been a prelude to laws.1 <lb/>
            Now why have I mentioned this ? It is because I wished to <lb/>
            say, that in all discourses, and whatever else partake of a vocal <lb/>
            sound, there are both preludes and, as it were, movements <lb/>
            backwards and forwards,2 that possess some artificial hand­ <lb/>
            ling, useful to that which is about to be gone through. And, <lb/>
            indeed, of the laws, as they are called, of guitar-songs and of <lb/>
            every kind of music, preludes are laid down composed with <lb/>
            wondrous care. But of laws really so, which we say are po­ <lb/>
            litical, no one has ever at any time made any mention of their <lb/>
            preludes, nor, as being a composer, has he brought it to light, <lb/>
            as if it did not naturally exist. But our present discussion, <lb/>
            as it seems to me, indicates that it does exist; and the laws, <lb/>
            which were just now mentioned as twofold, have seemed to <lb/>
            be3 not surely thus twofold simply, but there (have seemed) <lb/>
            to be some two things, law and a prelude to a law; but the <lb/>
            tyrannical injunction, which was spoken of as being similar to <lb/>
            the orders of slave-physicians, (has appeared) to be an un­ <lb/>
            mingled law ; but that, which was spoken of prior to this, and <lb/>
            called persuasive by this person here, (seemed) to be in reality <lb/>
            persuasive, but to have the power of a prelude, relating to dis­ <lb/>
            courses. For in order that the person, to whom the legislator <lb/>
            addresses his law, may receive kindly, and, through his kind­ <lb/>
            ness, with more docility, the injunction, which is the law, on <lb/>
            this account the whole of this discourse has appeared to me <lb/>
            to have been spoken; 4 which the speaker has spoken persuad­ <lb/>
            ing.4 Hence, according to my reasoning, this very thing <note type="footnote"> 1 Cicero de Legg. ii. 7, 16, " Habes legis proœmium; sic enim appellat <lb/>

            would be properly called a prelude to a law, but not a dis­ <lb/>
            cussion of it. What then, after saying this, should I wish <lb/>
            to be stated subsequently? It is this; 1 that the legislator <lb/>
            ought ever prior to all laws to make them not without a share <lb/>
            of preludes; and as regards each law, in so far as they differ <lb/>
            from themselves, as much as the two just now mentioned have <lb/>
            differed.1</p>
          <p>Clin. For my part, 2 I would never exhort 2 a man, skilled <lb/>
            in these things, to lay down laws in any other manner.</p>
          <p>Athen. You appear therefore to me, 0 Clinias, to speak <lb/>
            correctly, so far that there is a prelude to all laws; and that <lb/>
            it is requisite for a person commencing the business of legis­ <lb/>
            lation, to prefer to every discourse a preface, that is natural <lb/>
            to each. For that, which is to be said after this, is not a thing <lb/>
            of little moment, nor is it a trifling difference, whether they <lb/>
            are stated clearly or not clearly. However, if we should enjoin <lb/>
            upon legislators to make a prelude equally about what are <lb/>
            called great and small laws, we should not speak 3 correctly. <lb/>
            For this is not to be done either in every song or in every <lb/>
            discourse; since, though it naturally belongs to all, yet it <lb/>
            is not to be used for all; and a thing of this kind is to be <lb/>
            allowed to the orator, the lyric singer, and the legislator.</p>
          <p>Clin. You appear to me to speak most true. But let us <lb/>
            make a no further exercise of delay, but return to the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, and begin, if it is agreeable to you, from those points, <lb/>
            which you did, as a person not preluding, speak of at that <lb/>
            time. Again then, as persons say, when playing,4 since se­ <lb/>

          <p>[1.] Athen. LET every one then hear, who has already <lb/>
            heard what we have said respecting the gods, and our dear <lb/>
            progenitors. For a man's soul is, after the gods, the most <lb/>
            divine of all his possessions, as being most his own. Now <lb/>
            the whole of a man's possessions are altogether twofold. The <lb/>
            more powerful and the better are the lords, but the weaker <lb/>
            and worse, the slaves. Of those then that are his the lord <lb/>
            must always be held in honour before the slaves. Hence <lb/>
            after the gods, who are lords, and those that follow next <lb/>
            to them, I properly exhort a person 1 to honour his own soul <lb/>
            by speaking of it as the second in rank. But not one, so to <lb/>
            say, honours his soul properly, although he appears (to do so). <lb/>
            For honour is somehow a divine good; but of things that are <lb/>
            evil not one is honourable. He then, who fancies that he shall <lb/>
            enlarge his soul by certain discourses or gifts or certain yield­ <lb/>
            ings, and yet does not make it better from being worse, ap­ <lb/>
            pears indeed to honour it, but by no means does so. For in­ <lb/>
            stance, 2 every boy on becoming a man thinks himself competent <lb/>
            to know all things,2 and that he honours his soul by praising <lb/>
            it, and he freely permits it to do whatever it pleases. But <lb/>
            3we now say3 that he, who acts so, injures and does not <lb/>
            honour (his soul). And yet it is necessary, as we have said, <lb/>
            (to honour) it in the second rank after the gods. Nor, when <lb/>
            a man does not consider himself, but others, as the cause of <lb/>
            his own errors and of ills the most in number and mag­ <lb/>
            nitude, and ever exempts himself as free from blame, is he <lb/>
            honouring his own soul, as he forsooth fancies; for he is <lb/>
            far from doing so; since he injures it; nor when 4contrary to <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῐν</foreign>, which I cannot understand, I have translated as if <lb/>

            reason, and the praise of the legislator he indulges in plea­ <lb/>
            sures, does he honour it all; but he dishonours it, by filling <lb/>
            it with vice and repentance. Nor yet when, on the contrary, <lb/>
            he does not thoroughly labour by bearing up against exertions <lb/>
            that receive praise, and against fears and pains, but sinks under <lb/>
            them; for 1 by sinking he then dishonours it; for he causes it to <lb/>
            be in dishonour by doing all these acts.. Nor does he honour <lb/>
            it, when he thinks that to live is altogether a good: for then <lb/>
            too he dishonours it. For while his soul imagines that every <lb/>
            thing in Hades is evil, he yields, nor does he strive against it <lb/>
            by teaching and convincing it that it does not know whether, <lb/>
            on the contrary, that, what relates to the gods there is not <lb/>
            the greatest of all good to us. Nor yet, when any one honours <lb/>
            beauty before virtue, is this any other thing than truly and <lb/>
            wholly a dishonour to the soul. For such an assertion falsely <lb/>
            proclaims that the body is more honourable than the soul. For <lb/>
            nothing born of earth is more honourable than what is in <lb/>
            Olympus; and he, who thinks otherwise of the soul, is ignor­ <lb/>
            ant that he is careless of this wonderful possession. Nor <lb/>
            when a person, who desires to possess wealth not honourably, <lb/>
            or when possessing (unjustly), 2 does not bear it ill, does he <lb/>
            then honour his soul with gifts ? He fails3 of it entirely. For <lb/>
            he sells what is honourable and at the same time beautiful in his <lb/>
            soul for a little gold; for all the gold both on the earth and <lb/>
            under the earth is of no value against virtue. And, to speak <lb/>
            comprehensively, he, who is neither willing by every contrivance <lb/>
            to abstain from such things, as the legislator numbers up and <lb/>
            ranks amongst the disgraceful and bad, nor, on the other hand, <lb/>
            to pursue to the utmost of his power the good and the honour­ <lb/>
            able, does not perceive that, in all these cases, he treats his <lb/>
            soul, which is a thing the most divine, with the greatest dis­ <lb/>
            honour, and in the most unseemly manner. For not one, so to <note type="footnote"> 1_1 Ficinus, whom Taylor follows, has merely " hæc enim agens omnia <lb/>

            capable of becoming better, the best possible.</p>
          <p>[2.] There is not then a possession belonging to a man <lb/>
            more naturally fitted, than the soul, to flying from evil, and 7 to <lb/>

            when it has taken it, to associate with it for the rest of life. <lb/>
            Hence it has been ranked second in honour; but the third- <lb/>
            every one will understand this at least-is the honour, accord­ <lb/>

            far the most moderate and safe.2 For the former cause the <lb/>

            less than his friends and associates do themselves. As regards, <lb/>
            however, the state and fellow-citizens, he is by far the best, <lb/>
            who prefers before the contests at Olympia and all in war and <lb/>

            manner the most beautiful of all men through (the whole of)2 <lb/>
            life. We must consider too the laws of intercourse3 with <lb/>
            strangers to be matters of the most holy kind. For nearly all <lb/>
            the delinquencies of strangers towards strangers depend more <lb/>
            upon an avenging deity 4 than do those in the case of fellow- <lb/>
            citizens.4 For a stranger being destitute of companions and <lb/>
            kindred, is an object of greater pity both to men and gods. <lb/>
            He therefore, who is more able to take vengeance, is more <lb/>
            ready to assist. Now the 5 Dæmon of each person, and the god of <lb/>
            hospitality, are as the attendants upon Zeus, who presides over <lb/>
            strangers, powerful in the greatest degree. It is then a mat­ <lb/>
            ter of much caution for a person, to whom there is even a little <lb/>
            portion of forethought, to proceed on to the end of life, without <lb/>
            having committed any error with regard to strangers. But, <note type="footnote"> 1_1 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς ὑπηρετηκὠς</foreign> are evidently an explanation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπηρε­ <lb/>

            parts, one of which was retained by a person who had formed an ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance with a stranger, and the other by the stranger himself. The <lb/>
            bearer of the symbol, whether one of the original parties, or a friend of <lb/>
            theirs, was entitled, on presenting it, to the rights of hospitality, which <lb/>
            were considered to be of the most sacred kind, and not to acknowledge <lb/>

            is that which takes place in the case of each towards sup­ <lb/>
            pliants. For the god, with whom the suppliant happens to have <lb/>
            met, as a witness to agreements made with a suppliant, be­ <lb/>
            comes himself pre-eminently the guardian of the sufferer.1 <lb/>
            2 So that no one, who injures suppliants, will go unpunished.2</p>
          <p>[3.] Thus then have we nearly gone through the modes of <lb/>
            intercourse3 relating to parents, and to a person himself, and <lb/>
            the things belonging to him, and those relating to the state, and <lb/>
            friends, and kinsmen, and strangers, and natives. But as to <lb/>
            what follows how a person by being what can best pass through <lb/>
            life, (it is meet)4 to detail, not what a law, but what praise <lb/>
            and blame may, by teaching individuals, render them more <lb/>
            obedient to the rein, and more kindly disposed to the laws <lb/>
            about to be established. These then are the matters we must <lb/>
            subsequently speak of. Now truth is the leader of every good <lb/>
            both to gods and men ; of which he, who is about to be blessed <lb/>
            and fortunate, should participate immediately from the begin­ <lb/>
            ning, in order that for the greatest length of time he may live <lb/>
            a person of truth. For he is trust-worthy; but he is not trust­ <lb/>
            worthy, by whom a voluntary falsehood is loved ; while he, by <lb/>
            whom an involuntary one is so, is a senseless person ; of which <lb/>
            states neither is an object of envy. For he, who is not trust­ <lb/>
            worthy and untaught, is unloved; and as time progresses to­ <lb/>
            wards morose old age, he becomes known, and at the end of <lb/>
            life has prepared for himself a solitude complete; so that, <lb/>
            whether his associates and children are alive or not, his life <lb/>
            becomes nearly equally an orphanhood. He however who <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus has “dens enim, per quern supplex fœdus est consecutus, dili­ <lb/>

            does no injury is held in honour; but he, who does not suffer <lb/>
            the unjust to act unjustly, deserves more than double the <lb/>
            honour of the former person. For the former has a value <lb/>
            equal to one man; but the latter to many others,1 by pointing <lb/>
            out to the rulers the injustice of the rest. But let him, who <lb/>
            unites with the rulers in inflicting punishments to the utmost <lb/>
            of his power, be proclaimed the great man in a state, and the <lb/>
            complete victor, if ever one was,2 in virtue. The very same <lb/>
            praise it is meet to proclaim of temperance and prudence; <lb/>
            and the person, who possesses other goods, that have a power <lb/>
            not only for him to possess them himself, but to share them with <lb/>
            others, it is meet to honour, as being at the tip-top (of excel­ <lb/>
            lence) ; but him, who is unable, although willing, to put aside <lb/>
            in the second rank; and to blame indeed the man who is envious <lb/>
            and unwilling through friendship3 to be a sharer of any of his <lb/>
            good things with any one; but not to hold a jot the more in <lb/>
            dishonour his possession on account of the possessor, but to <lb/>
            acquire it with all one's might. Let then every one contend with <lb/>
            us for virtue unstintingly. For such a person advances a state <lb/>
            by striving himself, and not cutting down others through <lb/>
            calumny. But the envious man, while he thinks to become the <lb/>
            superior by detracting from others, tends less himself to true <lb/>
            virtue, and makes his competitors disheartened through their <lb/>
            being blamed unjustly; and by these means causing the whole <lb/>
            state to be untrained for the contests of virtue, he renders it, <lb/>
            as far as he can, of less account as regards its renown. It <lb/>
            is proper, moreover, for every man to possess a spirit, and yet <lb/>
            to be as mild as possible. For it is not possible to avoid the <lb/>
            unjust acts of others, which are harsh and difficult to be cured, <lb/>
            or entirely incurable, otherwise than by fighting and con­ <lb/>
            quering, after defending oneself, and by remitting nothing, <lb/>
            when in the act of punishing. Now to do this every soul is <lb/>
            unable, without possessing a noble spirit.</p>
          <p>With respect to the acts of those, who do an injury that <lb/>

            'that no unjust man is voluntarily unjust.' For no one would <lb/>
            at any time willingly possess any of the greatest evils, and <lb/>
            least of all in the case of the most honoured belonging to him­ <lb/>
            self. Now the soul, as we have said, is in truth a thing the most <lb/>
            honoured by. all. No one, therefore, would at any time volun­ <lb/>
            tarily receive the greatest evil in the thing most honoured, and <lb/>
            live through the whole of life possessing it. But the unjust man <lb/>
            and he who has what are evils, is in every respect an object of <lb/>
            pity. It is proper, however, to pity him, who has an evil that <lb/>
            is curable, and to restrain and soften down one's anger, and <lb/>
            not, like a woman with an excess of passion, to continue em­ <lb/>
            bittered against him. But it is meet to let loose one's anger <lb/>
            against a person incontinently 2 sinful, and past all exhortation <lb/>
            depraved. On which account we have said that the good man <lb/>
            ought to be conspicuous3 for possessing a spirit, and yet to be <lb/>
            on each occasion mild.</p>
          <p>[4.] But of all evils the greatest is implanted in the <lb/>
            souls of the major part of mankind; for which, while each one <lb/>
            is giving himself a pardon, he devises no plan for avoiding it. <lb/>
            And this is what people4 say; that every man is naturally <lb/>
            a friend to himself, and that it is well for a thing of this kind <lb/>
            to be necessarily so. But, in truth, the cause of all his mis­ <lb/>
            takes arises to each man, upon each occasion, through the violent <lb/>
            love of self. For the lover is blinded with respect to the ob­ <lb/>

            good, and beautiful, through thinking that he ought always to <lb/>
            honour what belongs to himself in preference to truth. For <lb/>
            it is necessary that he, who is to be a great man, should love <lb/>

            as divine things are concerned, respecting the pursuits, to which <lb/>
            every one ought to attend, and respecting each individual <lb/>
            himself, of what kind he ought to be; but matters relating to <lb/>
            man have not been at present spoken of. But it is necessary <lb/>
            (to speak of them): for we are conversing with men, and not <lb/>
            with gods. Now pleasures, and pains, and desires, are naturally <lb/>
            in the highest degree human ; on which it is necessary for <lb/>
            the whole mortal animal to bang, as it were, 6 [and to be sus­ <lb/>
            pended] 6 with the greatest earnestness. It is requisite then to <lb/>
            praise the most beautiful life, not only because by its form it is <lb/>
            superior, as regards fair renown ; but because, if any one is will­ <lb/>
            ing to taste of it, and not, as being young, to become a deserter <lb/>
            from it, it excels in that too, of which we all are in search, (I <lb/>
            mean) the possessing more of joy and less of sorrow through the <lb/>
            whole of life. That this will be clearly the case, if any one tastes <lb/>
            of it correctly, will readily and vehemently appear. Now what <lb/>
            is this correctness? This it is requisite to ascertain from <lb/>
            the reasoning, and to consider whether it is produced accord­ <lb/>

            ful. We wish for pleasure to be present with us ; but we <lb/>
            neither choose nor wish for pain. But what is neither the <lb/>
            one or the other we do not wish for in the place of pleasure ; <lb/>
            but we do wish for it to be exchanged in the place of pain. <lb/>
            We wish too for less pain with more pleasure ; but we do not <lb/>
            wish for less pleasure with greater pain. But we can show <lb/>
            clearly that we do not wish to possess each of these, equal in <lb/>
            the place of equals. All these differ in multitude and magni­ <lb/>
            tude and intensity and equality, and in whatever things are <lb/>
            the contrary to all these, with respect to wishing ; but I with <lb/>
            respect to the choice of each, 1 they do not differ. Since then <lb/>
            these things have been thus arranged by necessity, we wish for <lb/>
            that life, in which the many and great and intense of each kind <lb/>
            exist, but in which pleasures exceed; but we do not wish for that <lb/>
            life, in which the contraries to these exist. And on the other <lb/>
            hand, the life in which things few and little and quiet exist, <lb/>
            but in which pains exceed, we do not wish for; but we wish <lb/>
            for that life in which the contraries to these exist. 2 And <lb/>
            again, the life, in which the balance is equal, as we said before, <lb/>
            it is meet to consider as an equal-balanced life ;2 since we wish <lb/>
            for the life, which exceeds 3 in what is agreeable to us; but <lb/>
            we do not wish for that (which exceeds) in what is disagree­ <lb/>

            ally bound up in these; and 5 [it is necessary to consider] 5 <lb/>
            what kind (of lives) we naturally wish for. And if we say, <note type="footnote"> 1—1 As the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς βούλησιν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς αἳρεσιν</foreign> have the same <lb/>

            pleasant and the best and the most beautiful, and to lead a life <lb/>
            as far as possible, the most happy for man ? Let us then call <lb/>
            one life temperate, another prudent, another brave, and rank <lb/>
            one as healthy ; 4 and four others, the contraries to these four, <lb/>
            by the name of the imprudent, the cowardly, the intemperate, <lb/>
            and the diseased. He, then, who knows the temperate, will <lb/>
            lay it down as mild in all things, and exhibiting quiet pains, <lb/>

            intemperate one the pains (exceed) the pleasures in magnitude <lb/>

            may exceed, but, where it is exceeded, that life we have de­ <lb/>
            cided to be the more pleasant. Now the [temperate man],' we <lb/>

            imprudent, and the man of bravery than the one of timidity, <lb/>
            each exceeding each on the score of pleasures; but on that of <lb/>
            pains, 2 the former exceeding the latter,2 the brave man has <lb/>
            the victory over the timid, and in that of the prudent the im­ <lb/>
            prudent; so that 3 of the lives, the more pleasant are the tem­ <lb/>

            the timid, and imprudent, and intemperate, and the diseased ;3 <lb/>
            and in short, the life which is connected with virtue, pertaining <lb/>
            either to the body or the soul, is more pleasant than the life <lb/>
            which is connected with depravity, and is superior even to <lb/>
            superfluity in the other points, such as beauty and rectitude <lb/>

            it is necessary somehow for the strain to follow ; or rather, in <lb/>
            good truth, to write down the laws of a polity. As then it <lb/>
            is not possible, in the case of a web, or any other tissue what­ <lb/>
            ever, to work up the weft and the warp from the same mate­ <lb/>
            rials, but there must needs be a difference as regard their <lb/>
            quality in the production of the warp, by being some of it <lb/>
            strong and assuming a firmness through the spindle,2 and <lb/>
            another part of it softer and 3making use of a just easiness ;3 <lb/>
            from whence 4 it is meet that those, who are about to hold great <lb/>
            offices in the state, should be judged of separately in this way, <lb/>
            and those too, who have been tested in a trifling education, on <lb/>
            each occasion according to reason. For there are two kinds <lb/>
            of polities, one relating to the appointment of offices to each <lb/>
            individual, and the other relating to the laws assigned to the <lb/>
            offices. But before all it is requisite to consider things of this <lb/>
            kind. A shepherd, and a herdsman, and a breeder of horses, <lb/>
            and whatever else there are of this kind of occupations, will, <lb/>
            after receiving the whole herd, never attempt to attend to them <lb/>
            otherwise than by first applying a purification suited to their <lb/>
            individual living together; and having by a selection separated <lb/>
            the healthy and diseased, and the well-bred and ill-bred, he <lb/>
            will send away one part to some other herds, but attend upon <lb/>
            the other part, thoroughly perceiving that his labour would be <lb/>

              bodies in each of the flocks, unless a person purifies what is <lb/>
              present in them.6 The attention, however, which is paid to <lb/>
              other animals is indeed less, and is alone worthy to be brought <lb/>
              forward for the sake of an example. But the affairs of men <lb/>
              (need) the greatest attention on the part of the legislator, to <lb/>
              investigate and detail what is suited to each individual, as re­ <lb/>
              gards purification and all other actions. For instance, that <lb/>
              which relates to the purification of a state should be in this <lb/>
              way. Of many existing purifications, some are rather easy, <lb/>
              but others more difficult; and he who is both a tyrant and a <lb/>
              legislator may be able to use such purifications as are difficult <lb/>
              and the best. But the legislator, who without being a tyrant <lb/>
              lays down a new polity and laws, would, if he were able to <lb/>
              purify with the mildest of purifications, do a thing of this <lb/>
              kind contentedly. 1 The best purification is however painful; <lb/>
              just as are the remedies of some such kind, which leading <lb/>
              for justice to punishment with avenging,1 put death or <lb/>
              exile as the finish to punishment. For it is wont to free the <lb/>
              city from those, who have erred the greatest, and who, as be­ <lb/>
              ing incurable, are the greatest hurt to the state. But with us <lb/>
              there is a milder purification of this kind. For upon these, who, <lb/>
              having nothing themselves, do, through the want of food, ex­ <lb/>
              hibit themselves as prepared to follow their leaders in an attack <lb/>
              upon the property of persons, who possess something, upon <lb/>
              such, as being naturally a disease in the state, it imposes a <lb/>
              removal, under the name, by way of good omen, of a colony, <lb/>
              and sends them away in the kindest possible manner. This then <lb/>
              should somehow be done at the very commencement by every <lb/>
              one legislating. To us however what is still more strange than <lb/>
              this has now happened relating to these. For there is no need <lb/>
              to devise either a colony or any selection for a purification; but <lb/>
              as if the waters, partly from fountains and partly from moun­ <lb/>

              most clear. But labour and danger, as it appears, are to be <lb/>
              found in every political establishment. However, since what is <lb/>
              now done exists in discourse, and not in action, let our selection <lb/>
              be held to be completed, and the purification to have taken <lb/>
              place according to our notions. For having by every kind <lb/>

            the sake of a sketch and outline,1 that the thing itself may be <lb/>
            accomplished, let the discourse proceed to our laying down the <lb/>
            laws.</p>
          <p>Let the land-owners and those that defend the distribution <lb/>
            of the land, be, for the sake of a fitting number, five thousand <lb/>
            and forty; and let, in like manner, the land and the dwellings <lb/>
            be distributed into the same portions, 2 so that the man and <lb/>
            his portion may accord in distribution.2 And in the first <lb/>
            place, let there be of the whole number two parts distributed, <lb/>
            and afterwards three of the same ;3 for it is by nature (divi­ <lb/>
            sible) into four and five, and so in succession as far as ten. <lb/>
            Thus much ought every person, who is legislating, to under­ <lb/>
            stand respecting number, what it is, and what kind will be the <lb/>
            most useful to all states. Let us then say it is that, which <lb/>
            possesses in itself the greatest quantity of divisions and most in <lb/>
            orderly succession. For the whole number does (not)4 obtain <lb/>
            by lot all kinds of divisions for all things. But the number five <lb/>
            thousand and forty, in matters relating to war and whatever <lb/>
            in peace have to do with conventions and communions, and <lb/>
            relating to revenue and distributions, cannot be cut into more <lb/>
            than sixty parts wanting one; but there are continuous divi­ <lb/>
            sions of it from one up to ten.</p>
          <p>[9.] These things however it is meet for those to take <lb/>

              secrated statues, and altars, and temples, and made for each <lb/>
              of the deities a sacred grove. Of all these not even the least <lb/>
              must the legislator disturb; but he must assign to each of the <lb/>
              portions a god, a dæmon, or some hero. And in the division <lb/>
              of the land, he must give up, selected for the first in rank, the <lb/>
              groves and all that is fitting, so that the assemblies of each of <lb/>

              against their wants, and during the sacrifices kindly entertain, <lb/>
              and become familiar with, and recognise, each other. 1 For there <lb/>
              is no greater good to a state than for persons to be the ac­ <lb/>
              quaintances of each other. Since where there is no light2 to <lb/>

              the first rank, it will be at least one in the second.. After this <lb/>
              we will, god willing, go through the polity, which is the third <lb/>
              in order. But now let us speak of this polity, what it is, and <lb/>
              how it may be produced.</p>
          <p>In the first place, let them distribute the land and houses. But <lb/>
            let them not cultivate the ground in common ; since a thing of <lb/>
            this kind is spoken of as greater than is suited to their present <lb/>
            birth, nurture, and education. Let them however distribute <lb/>
            land and houses with somehow such an intention as this, that <lb/>
            each on obtaining his allotment ought to consider it as being <lb/>
            common to the whole state; and, as this country is their pa­ <lb/>
            ternal land, they ought to attend to it in a greater degree than <lb/>
            children do their mother, in that, being a goddess, she is the <lb/>
            sovereign mistress of mortals. The same conceptions they <lb/>
            ought to have of the gods of the place, and likewise of dæmons. <lb/>
            But that these things may exist in this manner through all <lb/>
            time, on this too they must thoroughly reflect. As many <lb/>
            hearths as are distributed by us at present, so many must there <lb/>
            be always, and neither more nor less. Now a thing of this <lb/>
            kind will be firmly established through every state in this <lb/>
            way. Let the person, who has obtained his allotment, leave <lb/>
            ever the child, who is most dear to him, the only heir of his <lb/>
            household, and his successor, and the attendant upon the gods and <lb/>
            family and state, and of those still living, and of such as their end <lb/>
            has already reached up to the then period. But with respect <lb/>
            to the other children, they, to whom there are more than one, <lb/>
            must give their daughters in marriage according to a law to be <lb/>
            laid down ; but distribute their male children as sons to those, <lb/>
            who have no family, as an act of kindness conferred ; but if <lb/>
            there be a lack of kindness, or if more females are born than <lb/>
            some2 males, or the contrary, when they are fewer, through <lb/>
            barrenness taking place, let the magistrate,3 whom we shall <lb/>
            lay down as the greatest and most honourable, consider what <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal version of the Latin of Ficinus, " ac si non <lb/>

            is proper to be done with the superabundance and deficiency <lb/>
            of children, and devise a method by which five thousand and <lb/>
            forty households alone may exist always. Now there are many <lb/>
            methods. For there are checks to procreation when it is over­ <lb/>
            flowing ;1 and, on the contrary, care and an attention to the <lb/>
            number of births do, by means of honours, and disqualifica­ <lb/>
            tions, and 2the advice of elders to young persons, meet (the <lb/>
            difficulty), and are able to effect what we are speaking of [by <lb/>
            admonitory discourses].2 3 Moreover, should at last every <lb/>
            difficulty arise about the inequality of the five thousand and <lb/>
            forty households,3 and an excessive influx of citizens take place <lb/>
            through the kind feelings of those, who dwell together, and <lb/>
            we come to want, there remains the old contrivance, which <lb/>
            we have often mentioned, of friendly colonies being sent out <lb/>
            from friends, whithersoever it may appear to be suitable. <lb/>
            But if, on the contrary, there should at any time come4 a wave <lb/>
            bringing an inundation,5 or 6 a destruction arising from plagues <lb/>
            or wars, and the people become, through a state of orphan­ <lb/>

            may not lie hid from them, but that they may punish the per­ <lb/>
            son disobedient at the same time to the law and to the god.2 <lb/>
            For how great a good will what is now enjoined be to all <lb/>
            states that are persuaded, when they adopt the following ar­ <lb/>
            rangement, according to the old proverb,3 no person being <lb/>
            wicked will know, but being experienced and reasonable in his <lb/>
            habits (he will). For in such an arrangement there exists not <lb/>
            much of money-making; and there is attendant upon it the being <lb/>
            neither necessary nor lawful for any one to make money by <lb/>
            any illiberal kind of money-making—inasmuch as the so-called <lb/>
            operative art is reproached as subverting liberal habits-nor to <lb/>
            think it right to scrape money together at all by such means.</p>
          <p>[12.] In addition to this a law still follows all these, that <lb/>
            no private person be permitted to possess any gold or silver; 4 <lb/>
            but that (there be)5 a coin 6 for the sake of daily exchange, <lb/>
            which it is almost necessary for handicrafts to change, and for <lb/>
            all, who have a need of such things,7 to pay the wages due to <lb/>
            hired persons, be they slaves or domestic servants. On which <lb/>
            account we say that they must possess coin, which is of value <lb/>
            amongst themselves, but of no worth amongst the rest of man­ <lb/>
            kind. For the sake of war indeed and of going abroad to other <lb/>

            money) his own,3 such money shall become public property; <lb/>
            and let him, who 4 knows the fact, but does not divulge it, be <lb/>
            subject to a curse 4 and reproach together with the party <lb/>
            bringing it in, and to a fine in addition, not less than the <lb/>
            amount of the foreign money so brought in.</p>
          <p>And (be it enacted), that a person who is going to marry, or is <lb/>

            may be the greatest and the wealthiest possible, and possess <lb/>
            gold and silver money, and rule over as many as possible by <lb/>
            sea and land; and they would add, that the person legislating <lb/>
            correctly ought to wish the state to be the best and the hap­ <lb/>
            piest possible. Now of these things some can take place, but <lb/>
            others cannot. The possible then the arranging party would <lb/>
            wish; but the impossible he would not; 1 nor would he make <lb/>
            even an attempt at wishes that are vain.' For it is almost neces­ <lb/>
            sary for them to be at the same time happy and good. This then <lb/>
            he would wish. But it is impossible for persons to be very rich <lb/>
            and good, such at least as the many reckon rich. For they <lb/>
            reckon rich those, who amongst a few persons have possessions <lb/>
            valued at the greatest quantity of coin, which even a bad man <lb/>
            may possess. Now if such be the case, I will never agree <lb/>
            with them that the rich man, if not a good one, can be truly <lb/>
            happy; but that it is impossible for the person pre-eminently <lb/>
            good, to be pre-eminently rich. What then ?2 some one would <lb/>
            perhaps say. Because, we would say, the possession of what <lb/>
            is obtained both justly and unjustly, is more than double of <lb/>
            that which is obtained justly alone ; and that the expenditure, <lb/>
            which is wont to be made neither honourably nor disgracefully, <lb/>
            is doubly less than that which is honourable, and is wont to <lb/>
            be made for honourable objects. He, therefore, who acts in a <lb/>
            contrary manner, will never be richer than him, who has <lb/>
            double the means and half the expenditure. Now of these, the <lb/>
            one is a good person, but the other not a bad one, since he is <lb/>
            (merely)3 parsimonious; sometimes, indeed, he is altogether <lb/>
            bad; but, as we have just now said, is never good. For he, who <lb/>
            receives both justly and unjustly, and spends neither justly <lb/>
            nor unjustly, is indeed rich, because he is parsimonious; but <lb/>
            he who is altogether bad, as being for the most part luxurious, <lb/>
            is very poor. And he, who spends upon honourable objects <lb/>
            and acquires only justly, will never at any time become pre- <lb/>
            eminently rich, nor yet very poor; so that our assertion is <note type="footnote"> interpolation. Perhaps however they ought to follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν βούλησιν</foreign>, just <lb/>

            right, that the very rich are not good men ; and, if they are <lb/>
            not good, they are not happy.</p>
          <p>[13.] With us, however, the laying down of laws looks to that <lb/>
            point, that the citizens may become the most happy and in the <lb/>
            highest degree friends to each other. But the citizens will <lb/>
            never be friends, where there are many lawsuits with each <lb/>
            other and much injustice; but (most so) where the least and <lb/>
            fewest are found. We have said too, that there ought to be <lb/>
            neither gold nor silver in the state; nor, again, much money- <lb/>
            making through handicraft trades and usury,1 or ugly cattle,2 <lb/>
            but what agriculture gives and bears,3 and of these too such as <lb/>
            will not compel a person by making money to neglect those <lb/>
            things, for the sake of which riches are produced.4 Now these <lb/>
            are the soul and body ; which, without gymnastics and the rest <lb/>
            of discipline, would never be worth mentioning. Hence we have <lb/>
            said more than once, that we must put the attention to money <lb/>
            in the last place of honour. For, since all, about which every <lb/>
            man is seriously engaged, are three, the last and third is cor­ <lb/>
            rectly the attention paid to riches, but the middle is that re­ <lb/>
            lating to the mind; but that relating to the soul the first. <lb/>
            And, indeed, the polity, which we have just now been going <lb/>
            through, has been correctly laid down by laws, if it ordains <lb/>
            honours in this manner. But if any one of the laws which <lb/>
            are ordained in it shall seem to put health in the place of <lb/>
            honour in the state before temperance, or wealth before health <lb/>
            and temperance, it will appear to be not properly laid down. A <lb/>
            legislator, therefore, ought often to point out to himself this. <lb/>

            out of legislation, and liberate likewise the rest, but never a <lb/>
            single person by any other means. Let then the person, who <lb/>
            has obtained by lot his portion, keep it on the conditions we <lb/>
            have detailed.</p>
          <p>1 It were a beautiful thing 1 for each person to come to the <lb/>
            colony possessing the rest of things also equally. But as this <lb/>
            is not possible, and one will come possessing more means, and <lb/>
            another less, it is requisite, for the sake 2 of many things, and <lb/>
            of the opportunities in the state, for the sake of equality,2 that <lb/>
            the value of property should be unequal, in order that magistra­ <lb/>
            cies, and contributions, and distributions, 3(may exist) to each <lb/>
            (according) to the value of his worth ;3 4 (and) that, not accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his own virtue alone, and that of his ancestors, nor yet <lb/>
            according to the strength or beauty of his body, but according <lb/>
            to the using of wealth and poverty they may receive as equally <lb/>
            as possible, by what is unequal, but commensurable, and not <lb/>
            differ.4 For the sake of these things it is requisite that there <lb/>
            should be four valuations in the size5 of property; and that <lb/>
            these should be called first, second, third, and fourth, or by <lb/>
            some other appellation; and that, when they remain in the same <lb/>
            valuation, and when becoming richer from being poor, and <lb/>
            poor from being rich, each may pass to the valuation suited <lb/>

            these produce both. It is therefore requisite for a legislator to <lb/>
            say at present what is the bound of each. Let then the limit of <lb/>
            poverty be the valuation of the lot, which ought to remain, and <lb/>
            which no magistrate will ever overlook its becoming less to any <lb/>
            one, nor any one of the rest of those who in the same way love <lb/>
            honour on the score of virtue. Now the legislator, having laid <lb/>
            down that limit as a measure, will permit a person to possess <lb/>
            the double, triple, and even to the quadruple of it. But, if <lb/>
            any one possesses more than these, whether by finding them, <lb/>
            or their being given, or by money-making, or by acquiring <lb/>
            through any other such like fortune, by giving up what is above <lb/>
            the measure to the state and to the gods, who guard the city, <lb/>
            he will be in good repute and without damage. But if any <lb/>
            disobeys this law, any one may inform against him on condi­ <lb/>
            tion of receiving half the property, and the delinquent shall <lb/>
            pay another portion to the same amount, and the half shall go <lb/>
            to the gods. And let the whole property of all, except the <lb/>
            allotment,' be written down openly before the magistrates, <lb/>
            who are the guardians, in order that such of the suits upon all <lb/>

            from it to cut the city and all the country into twelve parts. <lb/>
            But the twelve parts ought to be equalized by the portions of <lb/>
            the prolific land being small, but those of the unprolific large, <lb/>
            and the allotments to be five thousand and forty. And again <lb/>
            (it is meet) to cut each of these into two; and to unite two <lb/>
            sections into one allotment, each having a share of what is <lb/>

            being added to that one farthest off, making one allotment; and <lb/>
            that, which is the second from the city, (to be added) to that, <lb/>
            which is the second from the extremity; and so on with all <lb/>
            the rest.' And (it is meet) to contrive in the twofold divisions, <lb/>
            that what has just now been said (respecting)2 the badness and <lb/>
            goodness of the land, be equalized 3 by the greater and less <lb/>

            of the rest of property into twelve parts equal, as much as is <lb/>
            possible, a description being made of all particulars. After <lb/>
            this, to assign the twelve allotments to the twelve gods, and to <lb/>
            call them after their names, and to consecrate to each the por­ <lb/>

            himself things of this kind.3 4 For the legislator would say <lb/>
            again to us this—" Do not think, my friends, that what has <lb/>

            and that (a person)5 has gone through in some manner the <lb/>

            things about to be, that he, who exhibits a pattern, according <lb/>
            to which the thing attempted ought to be done, should omit <lb/>
            nothing of what is most beautiful and true; but that he, to <lb/>
            whom it is impossible for any thing of this kind to happen, <lb/>
            should decline executing that very thing; but that of those <lb/>
            which remain, and is nearest to it, and most closely connected <lb/>
            naturally with what it is fitting to do, 6 he should devise a plan <lb/>
            how this very thing may take place ;6 but permit the legislator <lb/>

            things within them,3 and what are consequent upon these, and <lb/>

            from whence (they have) 4 clans,5 and wards, and villages, and, <lb/>

            all, that, since the work of legislation is a matter of moment, <lb/>
            1 by placing a state well furnished with laws well laid down <lb/>
            under not Suitable magistrates,1 not only would there be a <lb/>
            very great laugh at the (laws) well laid down to no purpose, <lb/>
            but there would arise nearly the greatest mischief and bane <lb/>
            to states from them.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us then consider this, as happening to you, my <lb/>
            friend, touching the present polity and state. For you see <lb/>
            that it is necessary in the first place for those, who are pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding in a straight road to the powers of magistrates, to have <lb/>
            given, both themselves and their respective families from <lb/>
            childhood to the period of their election, a sufficient test. <lb/>
            Next for those, who are about to make the choice, to have <lb/>
            been brought up and well taught in legal habits, so as to be <lb/>
            able to judge correctly of those worthy of either (fate), and to <lb/>
            receive, or to reject them with disgust.2 But how can those, <lb/>
            who have recently met together for this purpose, and are un­ <lb/>
            acquainted with each other, and moreover uninstructed, be <lb/>
            ever able to choose magistrates in a blameless manner ?</p>
          <p>Clin. They nearly never can.</p>
          <p>Athen. But a contest, as they say,3 does not readily admit of <note type="footnote"> 1-1 By merely changing TOr into <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπιστη̄σαι</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποστη̃σαι</foreign>, <lb/>
            the passage which Stephens, Heindorf, Ast and all others consider to be <lb/>
            defective, and endeavour to supply, becomes perfectly intelligible. For <lb/>
            Plato meant it to be inferred that even good laws, when improperly ad­ <lb/>

            from neither the Greek nor the genuine version of Ficinus, but the relic­ <lb/>

            ought to choose in common with those who are going to this <lb/>

            men in all; nineteen from the settlers, but the rest from <lb/>

            on which he has written the name of his father,2 and parish, <lb/>

            then, as I have just now said,3–for what is well said it does <lb/>
            no harm (to say) twice-that the Cnossians ought to have a <lb/>

            possible,4 not less than one hundred, and let there be another <lb/>
            hundred from the Cnossians themselves. I say too, that these <lb/>
            should, on coming to the new city, be careful how the magistrates <lb/>
            are appointed according to the laws, and after being appointed <lb/>

            throws us into great trouble. For, as there are two equalities,1 <lb/>
            of the same name, but in reality- nearly contrary to each other <lb/>
            on many points, every state and every legislator is competent <lb/>
            to introduce one of these in the case of honours by regulating, <lb/>
            as regards the distribution by means of the ballot, the equality <lb/>
            consisting in measure, weight, and number ; but it is not easy <lb/>
            for every one to perceive the most true and the best equa­ <lb/>
            lity.2 For it is the decision of Zeus ;3 and it furnishes4 but <lb/>
            little at all times to men ; although as much as it does furnish <lb/>
            to states or private persons, it works out every good. For it <lb/>
            distributes more to the greater, and less to the smaller,5 im­ <lb/>
            parting to each what is moderate according to its nature. <lb/>
            Moreover it distributes greater honours to those who are even <lb/>
            greater in virtue, 6 but to those who have (less) of virtue and <lb/>
            education (it distributes) less (honours), as being suited 6 to each <lb/>
            according to reason. For this surely is justice itself even in <lb/>
            politics, at which we ought at present to grasp, and, looking <lb/>
            to this equality, Clinias, to settle our now rising state. And <lb/>
            should any one settle any other (state), he ought to give laws, <lb/>
            with his mind turned to this point, and not to a few tyrants, or <lb/>
            one, or to any power of the people, but always to justice it­ <lb/>
            self. And this is what has just now been stated, namely, the <lb/>
            distributing what is according to nature, equal to unequals. <note type="footnote"> I The two equalities alluded to are the arithmetic and geometric, as <lb/>

              it is fitting for one state to give an answer to other states, <lb/>
              or by putting questions to others to receive replies ; and <lb/>
              moreover for the sake of those innovations of all kinds which <lb/>
              are wont to happen perpetually, in order especially that they <lb/>
              may not occur; or, if they have occurred, that the conse­ <lb/>
              quences may be cured as quickly as possible, after the state <lb/>
              shall have become acquainted with them. Hence that por­ <lb/>
              tion, which presides over the state, ought to be the mas­ <lb/>
              ter of public meetings and their dissolutions, which take <lb/>
              place both according to law and on a sudden. All these <lb/>
              matters it should be for the twelfth part of the council to ar­ <lb/>

            But let us not disturb those, with whom, as priests or <lb/>
            priestesses, the sacred office is hereditary. But if, as is <lb/>
            likely to happen to those first settled, nothing has been laid <lb/>
            down respecting holy 3 things of this kind in favour of any <lb/>
            body or only a few, one must appoint priests and priestesses <lb/>
            to be the cleansers of the temples of the gods. But of all <lb/>
            these things some are to be in their appointment by election, <lb/>
            and some by lot, through those that are and are not Wards­ <lb/>
            men mingling in a friendly manner with each other in every <lb/>
            district and town, in order that they may be as much as pos­ <lb/>
            sible of one mind. To commit then what relates to sacred <lb/>
            rites to the god himself, let it be an act of gratification to him, <lb/>
            and to allow divine fortune to settle by lot. But the party <lb/>
            who has happened to obtain the lot, (it is meet) to subject to <lb/>
            a scrutiny first, whether he is of a sound body and lawfully <lb/>
            begotten ; next of a family as pure as possible, and unpolluted <lb/>
            himself by blood and all crimes of such a kind against the gods, <lb/>
            and whether his father and mother have lived in a similar <lb/>
            manner. And it is meet to bring from Delphi the laws relating <lb/>
            to all divine things, and, after appointing interpreters for them, <note type="footnote"> 1 To avoid the strange notion of thus uniting human beings with the <lb/>

            manner as for the City-Stewards. 3(For it is meet) that ten <lb/>
            out of all the rest, having had hands held up for them, should <lb/>
            ballot for the five,3 and declare them, after undergoing a scru­ <lb/>

            his hand 4 for ten in all.4 But let him, who is unwilling to vote, <lb/>
            if informed against before the rulers, be fined fifty drachms, in <lb/>
            addition to his being held to be a bad man. And let any one <lb/>
            who wishes go to the public assembly and common meeting ; <lb/>
            and let it be compulsory on him, who belongs to the se­ <lb/>
            cond and first class of property, to be fined ten drachms, if he <lb/>
            is not present and mustered at the conventions; but it shall <lb/>
            not be compulsory on the third and fourth class of property; <lb/>
            but let such a person be dismissed without a fine, unless the <lb/>
            rulers give an order for all to be present in consequence of <lb/>
            some (urgent) necessity. <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Here again Ficinus, whom Taylor follows, has been content <lb/>

          <p>[11.] After this it will be proper for the leaders in Music <lb/>
            and Gymnastics to be established, two kinds of each ; some of <lb/>
            them for the sake of instruction, and others for the sake of <lb/>
            contesting. Now in the case of instruction, the law relating to <lb/>
            Gymnasia and schools means to speak of those, who have the <lb/>
            care of orderly arrangement and instruction to boot, and of <lb/>
            the attention paid to such matters, and of the frequenting and <lb/>
            staying at schools on the part of young persons, both male <lb/>
            and female: but in the case of contesting, (it means to speak <lb/>
            of) those who assign the prizes to competitors in Gymnastics <lb/>
            and Music; and these two are two-fold; one employed on <lb/>
            Music, and the other on Gymnastics.1 Now in the contests <lb/>
            of men and horses,2 it would be proper for the same per­ <lb/>
            sons to assign the prizes ; but in those of Music, for some to <lb/>
            do so in the case of solo-singing and the imitative art,3 such <lb/>
            as the rhapsodists, and all of this kind ; but others over chorus- <lb/>
            singing and players on the harp and hautboy. First then with <lb/>
            regard to the amusement of the choirs of boys and men, and <lb/>
            girls (exercised) in dancing, and in the whole order of music, it <lb/>
            is surely requisite to elect their leaders.

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. c. 12. </note> <lb/>
            less than forty years old, will surely suffice for these. One too <lb/>
            not less than thirty years old will suffice for solo-singing, and <lb/>
            to be the introducer of, and to give a j udgment sufficiently upon, <lb/>
            the competitors. Now the leader and regulator of the choir <lb/>
            it is requisite to choose in some such manner as this. Let <lb/>
            those, who have a friendly feeling towards such matters, go to <lb/>
            the meeting, subject to a fine if they do not go, and of this let <lb/>
            the guardians of the law be the judges ; but upon the rest, if they <lb/>
            are not willing, let there be nothing compulsory. And let <lb/>
            the person, who makes the nomination, select one out of those <lb/>
            who are skilful; and in the scrutiny let there be only this <lb/>
            one charge and denial, on the part of some, that the person, <lb/>
            who has obtained the lot, is unskilled, but on the part of others, <lb/>
            that he is skilled; and let the person who, out of ten pre­ <lb/>
            viously voted for, has obtained singly the lot, be, after under­ <lb/>
            going a scrutiny, the leader of the choirs according to the law <lb/>
            for one year. In the same manner as these, let him who, out <lb/>
            of those that come to a trial, in this way obtains the lot, be <lb/>
            the leader for that year of the 3 solo-singing, and concert­ <lb/>
            singing,3 after giving, as the party so obtaining the lot,2 to <lb/>
            the judges the power to decide. After this it is necessary to <lb/>
            choose from the persons belonging to the third and even second <lb/>
            class of property, the assignors of prizes in the contest relat­ <lb/>
            ing to the exercises of horses and men. Now to the elec­ <lb/>
            tion let it be compulsory upon the three classes to go, but <lb/>
            let the smallest class be dismissed without a fine; and let <lb/>
            there be three who obtain the lot, twenty having previously <lb/>
            had hands held up for them, but three of the twenty obtaining <lb/>
            the lot, whom the vote of the examiners shall approve of. But <lb/>
            if any one is rejected through any balloting or decision what­ <lb/>
            ever of a magistrate, let another be chosen in his stead, and <lb/>
            the scrutiny take place in the same manner respecting him.</p>

            of the whole instruction of females and males. Let the person <lb/>
            who is to rule over these be, according to the laws, not less <lb/>
            than fifty years old, and the father of children lawfully be­ <lb/>
            gotten, males and females especially, but if not, of either sex. <lb/>
            And let both him, who selects, and him, who is selected, consider <lb/>
            that this office is by far the greatest of the chief offices in the <lb/>
            state. For the first budding of every plant, when it runs in <lb/>
            a beautiful manner to the excellence of its nature, is the most <lb/>
            powerful to put a suitable finish 1 of other plants, 1 and of <lb/>
            animals tame and wild and men. Now man we say is a tame <lb/>
            animal; and when he meets with proper instruction and a <lb/>
            fortunate nature, is wont to become an animal the most divine <lb/>
            and tame; but when he is not sufficiently or not properly <lb/>
            brought up, he is the most savage of all the animals, which the <lb/>
            earth produces. On which account the legislator ought not to <lb/>
            suffer the bringing up of children to be a secondary thing, or as <lb/>
            a by-work. 2 But it is necessary to begin from the first step, <lb/>
            by the person,2 who is about to have the care of them, being <lb/>
            selected, who is the best in all respects of those in the state; <lb/>
            3 and by the legislator ordering that person to be by all possible <lb/>
            means set over3 and to take care of them. Let all the magistrates, <lb/>
            therefore, except the Counsellors and Prytanes, go to the tem­ <lb/>
            ple of Apollo and give, unknown to the guardians of the laws, <lb/>
            their votes for him, whom each conceives would rule the best <note type="footnote"> 1—1 That Plato would thus repeat <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν τε ἄλλων φυτω̃ν</foreign> after the pre­ <lb/>

            more than thirty days, let those, to whom this duty belongs, <lb/>
            appoint another in the same manner to the office. And if <lb/>
            any one, who is a guardian to orphans, dies, let the relations <lb/>
            on both the father's and motber's side, as far as the cousins, <lb/>

          <p>Now every state will surely become no state, in which courts <lb/>
            of justice are not properly established ; and on the other hand <lb/>
            a voiceless judge, and who, in the preliminary proceedings,3 <lb/>
            does not speak more than the litigants, as in the case of arbitrat­ <lb/>
            ors,4 will never be sufficient for the purpose of deciding justly. <lb/>
            On this account, it is not easy, when there are either many or <lb/>
            few indifferent characters, to have a fair trial. But it is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary for the matter in dispute to be clearly stated by each <lb/>
            party; and time too and the sifting slowly and frequently a <lb/>

            a certain respect, indeed, the establishment of courts of jus­ <lb/>
            tice depends on the choice of magistrates; for every magis­ <lb/>
            trate is necessarily a judge of certain things ; but every judge1 <lb/>
            is not a magistrate, although, in a certain respect, during the <lb/>
            day in which he is deciding a suit, he is no mean a magistrate. <lb/>
            Considering, then, the judges likewise as magistrates, let us <lb/>
            state which of them would be proper, and of what matters <lb/>
            they are to be the judges, and how many for each suit. Let <lb/>
            then that tribunal be of the highest authority, 2 which each <lb/>
            show forth, themselves to themselves, after having chosen cer­ <lb/>
            tain persons in common.2 But as regards the rest, let there <lb/>
            be two tribunals; one, when a private person accusing another <lb/>
            private person of doing him a wrong, shall bring him to trial, <lb/>
            and be willing for the suit to be decided; the other, when <lb/>
            any one conceives that the public has been injured by some <lb/>
            of the citizens, and is willing to aid the community at large. <lb/>
            Let us state then 3 of what kind are the judges, and who.3</p>
          <p>In the first place then, let a tribunal common to all, who are <lb/>
            contending for the third time, as private persons with each other, <lb/>
            exist in this manner. All the magistrates that are in office <lb/>

              one is rejected, let them choose another in the same manner; <lb/>

              give their vote openly. The Counsellors, however, and the <lb/>
              other officials, who chose them, must of necessity be the hearers <lb/>
              and spectators of these decisions ; and other persons too, who­ <lb/>
              ever wish it. But if any one accuses any person of having <lb/>

              accusation before the guardians of the law; and let the party <lb/>
              found guilty undergo a punishment of this kind, namely, to <lb/>
              pay half of the damage done to the injured party; but if he <lb/>
              shall appear to deserve a greater fine, let those, who tried the <lb/>

              who has suffered the injury.3 But with respect to public ac­ <lb/>
              cusations, it is necessary in the first place for the multitude to <lb/>
              participate in the decision. For all are injured, when anyone <lb/>

              of each of them. It is meet moreover for all to have a share <lb/>
              as far as they can in private suits. For he, who has no share <lb/>
              in the power of acting as a judge with others, conceives that <lb/>
              he has in no respect a share in the state. On this account <lb/>
              then it is necessary for the courts of justice to be according to <lb/>

          <p>[14.] Now in truth, respecting courts of justice, of which we <lb/>
            said that a person speaking could not easily assert indubitably <lb/>
            that they are offices of rule or not, this description, painted, <lb/>
            as it were, in outline,2 has asserted some things, and nearly <lb/>
            left out others. For the exact laying down and at the same <lb/>
            time the division of laws relating to suits3 will take place by <lb/>
            far the most correctly at the end of legislation. Let it then be <lb/>
            told to those subjects to wait for US.4 For the appointments <lb/>
            relating to other magistrates have taken up nearly the greatest <lb/>
            part of legislation. But the totality and exactness relating to <lb/>
            one and all of the subjects connected with a state, and the <lb/>
            whole of a state administration,5 cannot become clear, until the <lb/>

          <p>Clin. Having spoken, 0 guest, what has gone before en­ <lb/>

            both what has been, and is to be, said.</p>

            have been played by us in a becoming manner.</p>
          <p>Clin. Beautiful is the serious pursuit of men, which you <lb/>

          <p>Athen. It is probable. But let us reflect whether this ap­ <lb/>
            pears to you as it does to me.</p>
          <p>CUn. What kind of thing ? and about what ?</p>
          <p>Athen. You know that, as in painting to the life, the business <lb/>
            appears never to have an end as regards each animal, but that <lb/>
            by colouring, and decolouring, or by whatever name the sons of <lb/>
            painters call a thing of this kind, it seems that it never would <lb/>
            cease giving a fresh touch, so that what has been painted receives <lb/>
            an increase towards becoming more beautiful and more clear.</p>
          <p>Clin. I almost understand, by hearing, what you mean, al­ <lb/>
            though I am by no means conversant with this kind of art.</p>
          <p>Athen. This will be no detriment to you. But let us em­ <lb/>
            ploy the expression, which has occurred to us respecting the <lb/>
            art, to this purpose, so that, if any one had an idea of painting a <lb/>
            most beautiful animal, and to keep it for not a worse state, but <lb/>
            a better one, as time was continually progressing, do you not <lb/>
            perceive that, through his being a mortal, unless he left be­ <lb/>

          <p>Athen. What then, does not this appear to you to be the <lb/>
            intention of the legislator ? First, to write down his laws as <lb/>

            upon this point, how it is requisite to preserve laws and to <lb/>
            set them to rights, he would never be tired of telling a thing <lb/>
            of this kind, until he reached the end.</p>
          <p>Clin. How should he ?</p>
          <p>A then. Ought not this then to be done both by you and <lb/>
            me at present ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what kind of thing are you speaking?</p>
          <p>Athen. Since we are about to establish laws, and guardians <lb/>
            of the laws have been chosen by us, but we are ourselves 2 at <lb/>
            the sunset of life,2 and the guardians are young men as com­ <lb/>
            pared with us, it is, as we have said, necessary for us at the <lb/>
            same time to lay down laws, and to endeavour likewise to <lb/>
            make these very (young) men, as much as possible, both <lb/>
            legislators and guardians of the laws.</p>

            the laws of which we have laid down ; for it must needs be so ; <lb/>
            nevertheless we will not omit matters of not small moment, nor <lb/>
            the whole as far as we can, undescribed, as it were, by some <note type="footnote"> what is done as accurately as possible is done more than sufficiently so- <lb/>

            among ourselves that a guardian of the laws and a legislator <lb/>
            ought to look. Now this agreement has one head,3 namely, <lb/>
            how a man may become good by possessing that virtue of the <lb/>
            soul, which is suited to his nature, either from a certain study, <lb/>

            opinion, or from some kind of learning, whether the nature of <lb/>

            in order that there may be, through the whole of life, every <lb/>

            we are now speaking; but of all the rest, that are an impe­ <lb/>

            On these points we have previously agreed; and do you now, <lb/>
            looking to both of these, praise and blame the laws ; blaming1 <lb/>
            such as are not able to effect these objects ;2 but, embracing and <lb/>
            receiving with a kind feeling such as are able, do live3 ye in <lb/>
            them ; but to other pursuits, and many 4 of those called good, <lb/>
            it is meet for you to bid a farewell.</p>
          <p>Let this then be to us the beginning of the subsequent laws, <lb/>
            commencing from things holy. For we ought in the first <lb/>
            place to resume the number five thousand and forty, because <lb/>
            it had and has now convenient distributions, both the whole <lb/>
            number, and that which was assigned to the wards; which <lb/>
            we laid down as the twelfth part of the whole, being exactly <lb/>
            four hundred and twenty. And as the whole number has twelve <lb/>
            divisions, so also has that of the wards. Now it is meet to <lb/>
            consider each division as a sacred gift of a deity, through its <lb/>
            following both (the order of) the months and the revolutions <lb/>
            of the universe.5 Hence that which is inherent6 leads every <lb/>
            state, making them7 holy. Some persons indeed have per­ <lb/>
            haps made a more correct distribution than others, and with <lb/>
            better fortune have dedicated the distribution to the gods. <lb/>
            But we now assert, that the number five thousand and forty <lb/>
            has been chosen most correctly, as it has all divisions as far <lb/>
            as twelve, beginning from one, except that by eleven; and <lb/>
            this has the slightest correction.8 For it becomes whole, <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus alone has " eas, inquam, vituperate," from whence Stephens <lb/>

            with each other, and for the sake of every kind, as we should <lb/>
            say, of intercourse. For as regards the communion in, and <lb/>

            as to the parties from whom a person leads home (a wife), and <lb/>

            than is fitting towards all kinds of actions, ought to be eager to <lb/>

            who is naturally of a contrary disposition, ought to proceed to <lb/>
            an alliance of a contrary kind. And in every case, let there be <lb/>
            one story1 respecting marriage. For it is meet that each person <lb/>
            should be a suitor in a marriage that is beneficial to the state, <lb/>
            and not what is the most pleasant to himself. For all are natur­ <lb/>
            ally carried to that, which is the most like to themselves; from <lb/>
            whence the whole state becomes in an anomalous position as <lb/>
            regards wealth and manners; through which those things, that <lb/>
            we do not wish to happen to ourselves, happen especially to <lb/>
            the majority of states. Now in our system to order by law <lb/>
            that the rich are not to marry with the rich, or the party, who <lb/>
            has much power, not to do so with another such, but to compel <lb/>
            the quicker in their habits to go by a community of marriage <lb/>
            to the more slow, and the slower to the quicker, would, in ad­ <lb/>
            dition to its being ridiculous, excite a feeling of anger with <lb/>
            the many. For it is easy to understand that a city ought not <lb/>
            to be mixed like a cup,2 in which the maddened wine, when <lb/>
            poured forth, effervesces ; but one that, being corrected by an­ <lb/>

            then, and still more, a person may say respecting marriages, how <lb/>
            they ought to take place, and may make use of a prelude cor­ <lb/>

            himself in the city estranged and without connexion, and re­ <lb/>
            mains unmarried for five and thirty years, let him be fined every <lb/>
            year, if he possesses property of the largest class, one hundred <lb/>
            drachms; if of the second, seventy; if of the third, sixty; <lb/>
            but if of the fourth, thirty ; and let the fine be sacred to Juno.3 <lb/>
            And let him, who does not pay every year, be made a debtor <lb/>
            tenfold ; and let the Steward of the goddess exact the fine ; and <lb/>
            if he does not exact it, let him be the debtor. 4 And let every <lb/>
            (Steward) in the passing of his accounts give a statement re­ <lb/>
            lating to (debts) of this kind.4 Let him then, who is unwilling <lb/>
            to marry, be thus punished as regards money ; and of all hon­ <lb/>
            our from juniors let him be deprived: nor let any young man <lb/>

          <p>Athen. And is not the contrary likewise (said), that, as there <lb/>
            is nothing healthy in the soul of a slave, it behoves a person, <lb/>
            who possesses any intellect, never to trust at all to that race. <lb/>
            The wisest too of poets has given this opinion, when speaking <lb/>
            of Zeus, he says, (Od. xvii. 332,) <lb/>
            " Half of their minds wide-seeing Jove has ta'en <lb/>
            From men, whose doom has slavery's day brought on. "</p>
          <p>Since then each person has got such notions in his mind, some <lb/>
            place no confidence at all in the race of slaves, but with goads <lb/>
            and whips, not thrice alone, but often, cause the souls of their <lb/>
            domestics, as if they had the nature of wild beasts, to become <lb/>
            slavish; but others on the other hand do what is quite the <lb/>
            contrary.</p>

              education of such persons is in not behaving insolently towards <lb/>
              domestics, but in acting less unjustly towards them, if possible, <lb/>
              than towards one's equals. For he is quite clearly a person <lb/>

              what is unjust as regards those human beings, amongst whom <lb/>

            made of earth." But our plan, in addition to this, of sending <lb/>
            young men every year into the country to dig out the earth <lb/>
            and make trenches, and by means of buildings to keep off the <lb/>
            enemy, 4 as if forsooth not suffering them to put their foot on <lb/>
            the boundaries of the land, would justly pay the forfeit of <lb/>
            very great ridicule. For we throw round a wall, which in the <lb/>
            first place by no means contributes to the health of the citizens ; <lb/>
            and moreover it is wont to produce a cowardly habit in the <lb/>
            souls of the inhabitants, by inviting them to fly to it, and not <lb/>
            to repel the enemy, nor to find their safety in some persons in <lb/>
            the city ever guarding it both night and day, but to fancy that, <lb/>
            while they are hedged in with walls and gates and asleep, they <lb/>
            will in reality possess the means of safety, as if they were born <lb/>
            not to labour, nor knew that an easy life is the result of la­ <lb/>
            bour ; but that, as I conceive,5 from a disgraceful inactivity <lb/>
            and easy temper 6 labours naturally result again. But if there <lb/>
            is any need to men of walls, it must needs be that the build­ <lb/>
            ings of private dwellings be so laid down from the commence­ <lb/>

            and similarity of all the dwellings, possessing, as regards the <lb/>

            which has' just now happened touching the matter under discus­ <lb/>
            .sion. For in the case of your countrymen, Clinias and Megillus, <lb/>
            the common tables relating to the men have been instituted in <lb/>
            both a beautiful, and, as I have said, wonderful manner, from a <lb/>
            certain divine necessity; but those relating to the women <lb/>
            have been by no means correctly left unregulated by law; <lb/>
            nor has the arrangement of their common tables been brought <lb/>
            to light. But though3 the female sex is really. rather more <lb/>
            given to secrecy and stealth, on account of its weakness, than <lb/>
            we men are, yet it is not properly dismissed, as being difficult <lb/>
            to regulate in consequence of the legislator conceding this <lb/>
            point. For, through this being neglected, many things have <lb/>
            in your state glided by, which would have been far better than <lb/>
            they at present are, had they met with laws. For the want of <lb/>
            regulations 5 relating to women, is not, as it would seem, when <lb/>
            disregarded, merely the half (of human concerns);6 but, by <lb/>
            how much the nature of women is worse than that of men, as <lb/>
            regards virtue, by so much does it differ in being more than <lb/>
            the double (as regards vice).7 This therefore to take up <lb/>
            again and to correct, and to arrange all pursuits in common <lb/>
            for women and men, is better for the happiness of the state. <lb/>
            But at present mankind is so led on in a manner by no means <lb/>

          <p>CHILDREN then, both male and female, having been begotten, <lb/>
            it will be most correct to speak next about their nurture and <lb/>
            education; which it is perfectly impossible to be1 not men­ <lb/>
            tioned ; and being mentioned it will appear to us to be rather <lb/>
            like a kind of teaching and admonition than laws. For the <lb/>
            numerous and trifling and not conspicuous matters, which <lb/>
            happen to all privately, and in each family, since they easily take <lb/>
            place through the pain, and pleasure, and desire of the respective <lb/>
            individuals, will render, contrary to the advice of the legislator, <lb/>
            the habits of the citizens all-various, and not similar to each <lb/>
            other. Now this is an evil to states. For on account of their <lb/>
            insignificance and frequency, to make them subject to a fine <lb/>
            would be at the same time unbecoming and unseemly. But it <lb/>
            destroys2 even the laws already laid down in writing, if <lb/>
            persons are accustomed to act contrary to law in things insig­ <lb/>
            nificant and numerous; so that it is difficult to lay down laws <lb/>
            concerning them, and yet impossible to be silent. But what <lb/>
            I mean to say, I must endeavour to show clearly by bringing, <lb/>

            kinds of wild animals1 in fighting with each other, and they <lb/>
            are far from thinking that the labours are moderate, in which <lb/>

            2 each taking under their arms the smaller in their hands, and <lb/>
            the larger under their arms within,2 they walk about, going <lb/>
            many stadia, and this, not for the sake of the good state of their <lb/>
            own bodies, but for that of the birds. And thus much they <lb/>
            signify to the person capable of learning, that all bodies are <lb/>

            young, that the nursing and motion, taking place as much as <lb/>
            possible all the night and day, are profitable to all, and not <lb/>
            the least 2 to the youngest; so that,2 if it were possible, they <lb/>
            may live as if always sailing on the sea. But now, 3 (since <lb/>
            this is impossible,)3 it is requisite to act as near as possible <lb/>
            to this with respect to 4 the newly born nurslings of children.4 <lb/>
            And 5 (what ought to be done) one may conjecture5 from this, <lb/>
            that both the nurses of infants, and those who are initiated in <lb/>
            the remedies 6 relating to the Corybantes,6 have adopted this from <lb/>
            experience, and know it to be useful. For, when mothers are <lb/>
            desirous to put to sleep their children, who sleep with dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty, they do not bring to them a state of quietness, but, on <lb/>
            the contrary, of motion, by shaking them ever in their arms ; <lb/>
            nor yet that of silence, but that of singing to them ; and they <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Both these passions result from fear; and there are <lb/>
            certain terrors through a depraved habit of the soul. When <lb/>
            therefore any one brings from without an agitation to passions <lb/>
            of this kind, that which is from without overcomes the dreadful <lb/>
            and insane motion within ; and after overcoming, it seems to <lb/>
            have produced a calm in the soul, and a quietness in the leap­ <lb/>
            ing, which had been troublesome as regards the heart of each ; <lb/>
            '(and) thus, (what is) altogether agreeable,1 it causes some to <lb/>
            obtain by lot2 sleep; but others, who are awake, and dancing <lb/>
            and soothed by the pipe under the influence of the divinities, <lb/>
            to whom each may be supplicating and sacrificing, it causes <lb/>
            to possess habits of sound sense in the place of a maddened <lb/>
            state. Now this, to speak in brief, has in this way a certain <lb/>
            probable reason.</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now if these things possess thus any such power, it <lb/>
            is requisite to consider this point as connected with them, that <lb/>
            every soul, which has been familiar with fear from youth, <lb/>
            would be more accustomed to be conversant with fears.3 But <lb/>
            this every one will surely say is an exercise of timidity, and <lb/>
            not of fortitude.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But the contrary pursuit we should say is that of <lb/>
            fortitude, in the overcoming, even from youth, what falls <lb/>
            upon us in the shape of fears and terrors.</p>

            that luxury renders the manners of youth morose and irascible, <lb/>
            and vehemently agitated by things of a trifling nature; but <lb/>
            that an excessive and rustic servitude causes them to be con­ <lb/>

            associates.</p>

            those, who have as yet no perception of language, and are un­ <lb/>
            able to have any taste for the rest of instruction ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Somehow in this way. Every animal, as soon as it <lb/>
            is born, is wont to utter some sound with a loud cry, and not <lb/>
            the least the human species ; and more than the rest of animals <lb/>
            it is affected in addition to its crying with the shedding of <lb/>
            tears.</p>
          <p>CUn. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now nurses, looking to what infants are desirous of, <lb/>
            make a conjecture by their presenting to them something. <lb/>
            For they think they correctly offer that, on which being pre­ <lb/>
            sented the children are silent; but incorrectly that, at which <lb/>
            it sheds tears and cries out. For in the case of children tears <lb/>
            and cries are the indications of what they love and hate, (and <lb/>
            are) signs by no means lucky. Now this period is not less than <lb/>

            medium between them, which I have just now denominated <lb/>

            that those, which they call the laws of the country, are no <lb/>
            other than of such a kind ; and further still, that the discourse, <lb/>
            which has just now flowed upon us, how that we ought not <lb/>
            either to call them laws, or to permit them to be unmen­ <lb/>
            tioned, has been spoken correctly. For these are the bonds <lb/>
            of all polity, existing in a middle state between all laws that <lb/>
            have been, and are, and will be hereafter, laid down in writing ; <lb/>
            and being, as it were, altogether the laws of a country, and <lb/>
            ancient in every respect, and which, when laid down correctly <lb/>
            and have become a custom, have invested the written laws <lb/>
            with every kind of security ; but should they advance impro­ <lb/>
            perly beyond what is right, they cause, like supports placed by <lb/>
            carpenters in the buildings of houses, and gliding away from <lb/>
            the centre, every thing to fall together to the same point, and <lb/>
            to lie, some under others, both themselves and what has been <lb/>
            subsequently built upon them, after the old portions have se­ <lb/>
            cretly given way. Reflecting upon which, it is necessary for <lb/>

            pearing to us to be enactments, or even customs, should, when <lb/>

            reflect in this manner.</p>

            old, any one should bring these matters accurately to an end, <lb/>
            and make use of what has been said in not a careless man­ <lb/>
            ner, they will be of no small advantage to those recently <lb/>
            brought up. But there will be a need of sports1 for the <lb/>
            habits of the soul at three, and four, and five, and even six <lb/>
            years of age. But we must already remove them from luxury, <lb/>
            by chastising them, not in an ignominious manner, but, as we <lb/>
            said on the subject of slaves, by chastising not with insults so as <lb/>
            to encourage an angry feeling in them, when so chastised, nor a <lb/>
            feeling for licentiousness by suffering them to go unpunished, <lb/>
            we must do the same in the case of the free-born. Now the <lb/>
            sports of persons of that age are self-produced; and which, <lb/>
            when they come together, they almost invent themselves.2 All <lb/>
            children then of this kind ought to come together at the tem­ <lb/>

              become, as it were, lame, through the (folly and) 1 ignorance <lb/>
              of our nurses and mothers. For while the nature of our limbs <lb/>
              on each side 2 is nearly balanced, we have ourselves, by not <lb/>
              using them correctly, made them, through habit,3 different. <lb/>
              In such employments as where there is no great difference, it <lb/>
              is of no consequence, whether a person makes use of a lyre <lb/>
              with his left hand and of the plectrum4 with his right, and <lb/>
              whatever else is of a similar kind. But to make use of these <lb/>
              examples in other cases, 5where there is no need of using it,5 is <lb/>
              nearly a folly. This fact has the law of the Scythians pointed <lb/>
              out, where a person does not push from him the bow with his <lb/>
              left hand (merely), and draw to himself the arrow with his <lb/>
              right merely, but he makes use of either similarly for both <lb/>
              purposes. And there are very many other examples of this <lb/>
              kind in charioteering and other things. From which one may <lb/>
              learn, that those, who make the left hand weaker than the <lb/>
              right, act contrary to nature. This, as I have said, is of no <lb/>
              great moment in the case of plectra made of horn, and such <lb/>
              like instruments; but in war, when it is necessary to use <lb/>
              weapons of iron, and bows, and spears, 6and each of these,6 it <lb/>
              matters much ; but it is of the greatest moment by far, when <lb/>

            same thing, it is meet to think, takes place as regards the ideas <lb/>
            of men, and the nature of their souls. For every soul has a <lb/>

            otherwise than they are at present, and it fears to disturb any <lb/>
            of those then existing. The legislator then ought to devise <lb/>
            from some quarter a plan as to the manner in which this may <lb/>
            take place in a state. In this way then do I discover it. All men, <lb/>
            as I have said before, consider the sports of youth, when they <lb/>
            are disturbed, to be in reality sports, and not that the greatest <lb/>

            not avert (the change,)5 but comply with and yield to it; nor <lb/>
            do they consider this, 6 that the children, who engage in these <lb/>
            new sports, must necessarily become men different from those <lb/>
            who were children in the former period ;s and that, becoming <lb/>
            different, they will seek a different life; and so seeking will be <lb/>
            desirous of other pursuits and laws ; and no one fears that, after <lb/>
            this, there will come upon states what has been just now called <lb/>
            the greatest evil. But other changes would effect lesser evils <lb/>

            well the road, whether he happened to be travelling alone, or <lb/>
            in company with others, he would inquire of himself and the <lb/>
            others, and not proceed before he had settled the question in <lb/>
            his mind, as to whither the road would lead him. And we <lb/>

          <p>Clin. Of what kind.</p>
          <p>A then. As a good omen ; and moreover, let the genus of the <lb/>
            ode be every where, and in every respect, a good omen to us. <lb/>
            Or shall I not ask you at all, but lay it down thus ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Lay it down by all means; for by all votes this law <lb/>
            is the victor.</p>
          <p>Athen. What then, after this good omen, shall be the second <lb/>
            law of music ? Will it not be for prayers to be (offered) to the <lb/>
            gods, to whom we on each occasion sacrifice ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But the third law, I think, will be, that it behoves <lb/>
            poets, when they know that 3 prayers are requests from men to <lb/>
            the gods,3 ever4 to direct their mind very carefully to this <lb/>

            all these be common to men and women, who have been con­ <lb/>
            spicuously virtuous. But it is necessary for odes and dancings <lb/>
            to be established in this manner. There are many ancient and <lb/>
            beautiful poems of old writers relating to music, and simi­ <lb/>
            larly to dancing for bodies.2 Against choosing out of these <lb/>
            what is becoming and suited to an established polity, there is <lb/>
            no objection. Of these let the persons selected3 as ex­ <lb/>
            aminers, being not less than fifty years old, make a selection. <lb/>
            And let them select whatever of the ancient poems appears to <lb/>
            be all-sufficient; but whatever is defective, or altogether unsuit­ <lb/>
            able, let it be rejected entirely; or let them take poets and <lb/>
            musicians, and employing their powers of poetry, adapt it to a <lb/>
            new rhythm after it is corrected ;4 but let them not give way to <lb/>
            pleasure or desire, except in some few cases ; but, interpreting <lb/>
            the intention of the legislator, establish dancing and singing, <lb/>
            and every dancing5 according to their own good sense. For <lb/>
            every occupation relating to music, which adopts order, is in­ <lb/>
            finitely better than that without order,6 even when the pleasant <lb/>
            in music is not added. Now the pleasant is common to all music. <lb/>

            to a staid and intelligent age, 7 (he considers to be pleasant,) 7 <lb/>

              been brought up in that, which is pleasant and common, he says <lb/>
              that the contrary to this is frigid and unpleasant. So that, <lb/>
              as I just now said, what relates to the pleasant or the unplea­ <lb/>

          <p>Clin. You have spoken well.</p>
          <p>Athen. Further still, it will be meet to separate the songs <lb/>
            suited to females and males, by defining them under a certain <lb/>
            type, and necessary moreover to adapt them to harmonies and <lb/>
            rhythms. For it is a shocking thing for the whole of harmony <lb/>
            to be a discord, or rhythm to be out of tune, and thus to attribute <lb/>
            to melodies nothing adapted to each of them. 2 It is necessary <lb/>
            then to lay down by a law the figures of these. And it is <lb/>
            necessary to attribute both constrained to both, but those of <lb/>
            the females, by the difference of the nature of each, by this it <lb/>
            is meet to mark out clearly.2 Now that which is gorgeous <lb/>
            and verges to fortitude, must be called manly ; but that which <lb/>
            more inclines to the ornamental and the moderate, must <lb/>
            be handed down, both in law and in discourse, as more femi­ <lb/>
            nine. This, then, is the order. After this, let the teaching <lb/>
            and handing down of them be detailed, as to the manner how, <lb/>
            and the persons by whom, and the time when it is requisite to <lb/>
            perform them. (And) as a shipwright, 3 when he lays down the <lb/>
            keel timbers, as the commencement of the ship-building, draws <lb/>
            the form of vessels,3 I appear to myself to do the same thing, <note type="footnote"> 1_1 Such is the literal translation of the Greek, which I confess I cannot <lb/>

            and after what manner, we may live together and be carried <lb/>
            the best during this voyage1 of life. Human affairs, indeed, are <lb/>
            not worthy of great attention; yet it is necessary to attend to <lb/>
            them. This indeed is not a fortunate circumstance. But since <lb/>
            we are here, if we can somehow accomplish this in a fitting <lb/>
            manner, it will perhaps be within our measure. 2 But what <lb/>
            am I saying ? This very point perhaps some one would take <lb/>
            up, and rightly so.2</p>
          <p>Clin. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Athen. I say then, that to a serious thing we ought to pay <lb/>
            a serious attention, but to a not serious one none at all; and <lb/>
            that the deity is naturally worthy of every blessed 3 attention, <lb/>
            but that man, as I said before,4 has been devised as the play­ <lb/>
            thing of a deity, and this is truly his best attribute. It is <lb/>
            necessary then for every man and woman to pursue this <lb/>
            mode, and, by engaging in the most beautiful sports, to pass <lb/>
            thus through life with thoughts the reverse of what they think <lb/>
            at present.</p>
          <p>Clin. How ?</p>
          <p>A then. At present indeed they think that serious pursuits <lb/>
            ought to exist for the sake of sports. For they consider thai <lb/>
            they ought to well dispose the serious pursuits relating to war <lb/>
            for the sake of peace. But in war there never has been naturally <lb/>
            either sport or instruction worthy of mention, nor is there, nor <lb/>
            will there be. But this we say is a thing to us the most seri­ <lb/>
            ous, (that) every one ought to pass through life for the most <lb/>
            part and the best in peace. What then is the proper man­ <lb/>

            because his father wishes it, but him too who, because (his <lb/>

            ing is, 1 every man and boy must by compulsion be instructed <lb/>
            as well as they can, since they belong rather to the state <lb/>
            than their parents. The very same things my law would <lb/>
            mention relating to females, as it does to males. 2 (For) it <lb/>
            it is meet2 to exercise equally the females likewise. And <lb/>
            I should fear to say respecting this subject of horsemanship <lb/>
            and gymnastics, that they are becoming indeed to men, but <lb/>
            not to women. For by hearing stories of the olden time have <lb/>
            I been persuaded. And even at present, I know that there <lb/>
            are, so to say,3 countless myriads of women about Pontus, <lb/>
            whom they call Sauromatides,4 on whom there has been en­ <lb/>
            joined an exercise in common with, and perhaps equal to, that <lb/>
            of men not only upon horses, but in bows likewise, and in the <lb/>
            rest of arms. But I have, moreover, a reason for this, of some <lb/>
            such kind as this. I say then, that if it is possible for these <lb/>
            things to happen in this manner, of all things is that, which <lb/>
            now takes place in our countries, the most silly, in the men <lb/>
            not pursuing all together, and with all their might, and with <lb/>
            one mind, the same pursuits as the women. For thus the <lb/>
            whole state is and becomes but the half, instead of being the <lb/>
            double, from the same expense and labour. And wonderful <lb/>
            would this very error be to (any) legislator. <note type="footnote"> I With this saying Ast compares the one found at the end of the Eu­ <lb/>

              and children, and dwellings 2 remain private property, and <lb/>
              every thing else is made such by each of us.2 But those things, <lb/>
              which have just now been mentioned as secondary to these, if <lb/>
              they take place at all, would take place in a very moderate <lb/>
              manner. We say then that to those, who live thus, there is left <lb/>
              a work, neither the least nor vilest, but the greatest of all or­ <lb/>
              dained by a just law. 3 For while the life of him, who is eager <lb/>
              for victory in the Pythian or Olympian games, supplies a <lb/>
              want of leisure for all other business,3 that life is filled with <lb/>

              selves, and, if it were possible, the whole household together, <lb/>
              as a disgraceful thing. It is meet then for all to get up by <lb/>

              state and household; the rulers, as regards the city, and the <lb/>
              mistresses and masters in their own families. For much sleep <lb/>
              is not naturally suited to our bodies or souls, or to the actions <lb/>
              relating to them. For he, who is asleep, is not of any more <lb/>
              worth at all than he, who is not alive. But whoever amongst us <lb/>
              is careful to live (well), 1 and to be the most wise, keeps awake <lb/>
              for the greatest part of his time, reserving only what is neces­ <lb/>
              sary for his health. But 2 it is not much going well to a <lb/>
              habit.2 Now magistrates, who are awake by night in states, <lb/>
              are a terror to evil-doers, whether enemies or citizens, but are <lb/>
              admired and honoured by the just and the wise, and a benefit <lb/>
              both to themselves and to the whole state.</p>
          <p>[14.] The night, when passed through in this manner, sup­ <lb/>
            plies, in addition to all the above-mentioned (advantages), a <lb/>
            certain fortitude to the souls of each of those who are in the <lb/>
            state. But on the return of day and the early dawn, it is re­ <lb/>
            quisite for the boys to turn their steps to their teachers. For <lb/>
            neither sheep nor any thing else ought to live without a shep­ <lb/>
            herd, nor boys without some boy-leaders, nor slaves without <lb/>
            masters. Now a boy is of all wild beasts the most difficult <lb/>
            to manage. For by how much the more he has the fountain <lb/>
            of prudence not yet fitted up,3 he becomes crafty and keen, <lb/>
            and the most insolent of wild beasts. On this account it is <lb/>

            instruct that very person ? For this it has not at present stated <lb/>
            at all in a clear and sufficient manner, but only in some things, <lb/>
            and some not. It is however necessary, to the utmost of our <lb/>

            reason, in order that he may be to others both an interpreter <lb/>

          <p>[15.] Athen. I am not then remiss. I assert indeed, that there <lb/>
            are very many writers of poetry amongst us, in hexameters <lb/>
            and trimeters, 1 and all the so-called measures, 1 some having <lb/>
            aimed at seriousness, others at fun ; in whose writings very <lb/>
            many myriads assert that we ought to bring up such of the <lb/>
            youths as are properly instructed, and to render them full even <lb/>
            to satiety, by making them to be frequent hearers at the read­ <lb/>
            ing of them, and very learned in them, through having got <lb/>
            whole poets by heart. But others say that, selecting the heads <lb/>
            from all, and bringing to the same point entire sentences, they <lb/>
            ought to learn them well2 by committing them to memory, <lb/>
            if any one among us is about to be a good man and wise <lb/>
            through much experience and much learning. Do you, then, <lb/>

            they say correctly or not ?</p>

          <p>A then. By saying what then upon all these points shall I <lb/>

            thing of this kind, in which every one would agree with me, <lb/>
            that each of those3 (the poets) have said many things beau­ <lb/>

            assert, that much learning is bringing danger to youth.4</p>

          <p>Clin. About what?</p>
          <p>Athen. In not being entirely in want of a pattern. For now, <lb/>
            after looking to the discourse, which we have gone through, <lb/>
            from the morning up to the present moment, not without the <lb/>
            inspiration of some god, as we appear to myself, 1 I fancy, by <lb/>
            Zeus, that something has been said by a person in his senses1 <lb/>
            altogether similar to a kind of poetry. Nor has perhaps any <lb/>
            lerful event fallen upon me, in being delighted with looking <lb/>
            In our own discourse, as being collected together.2 For of <lb/>
            the very many discourses in poems, or spoken thus in prose, <lb/>
            which I have learnt and heard, they have appeared to me to <lb/>
            be the most moderate of all, and the most fit for youths to hear. <lb/>
            Hence I conceive I could not have to mention to a guardian of <lb/>
            the laws and an instructor a pattern better than this, or to ex­ <lb/>
            hort the masters to teach boys these subjects, and what are <lb/>
            next and similar to these, whether a person happens to be go­ <lb/>
            ing through the compositions of poets, or what has been writ­ <lb/>
            ten in prose, or spoken thus nakedly, without being written, as <lb/>
            being the brothers of these discourses, so as not to neglect them <lb/>
            in any way, but to write them down ; and in the first place to <lb/>
            compel the teachers themselves to learn and praise them ; 3 and <lb/>
            not to employ as co-workers the teachers, to whom they are <lb/>
            not acceptable; but that such as a person may find giving <lb/>
            their votes for praise, let him make use of these, and hand over <lb/>
            to them the youths to teach and to instruct. Here then and <lb/>

          <p>Athen. With respect to wrestling, then, we have said some­ <lb/>
            thing ; but that which is, as I should say, the greatest thing, <lb/>
            we have not spoken of; nor is it easy to speak of it, without <lb/>
            pointing it out with the body, as well as by word of mouth. <lb/>
            This then we will determine, when our language, following <lb/>
            out acts, shall indicate something clear about the other <lb/>
            points of which we have spoken ; and that such a wrestling is <lb/>
            in reality of all motions allied the nearest to a personal encoun­ <lb/>

          <p>[18.] Athen. Let then thus much be held to have been said <lb/>
            up to the present moment on the subject of wrestling. But <lb/>
            with respect to the other motions of the whole body, the greatest <lb/>
            part of which a person would, by calling it a certain dancing, <lb/>
            call it correctly, it is proper to consider as of two kinds; one <lb/>
            imitating the solemn in the more beautiful bodies, but the <lb/>
            other the depraved in baser bodies. And again, of the de­ <lb/>
            praved there are two species, and two of the serious. Of the <lb/>
            serious motion one kind exists, when bodies of beauty and a <lb/>
            soul of bravery become implicated in war and violent exer­ <lb/>
            tions : but the other, when a temperate soul (being mixed up) <lb/>
            with a prosperous state and moderate pleasures. Now he who <lb/>
            calls a dancing of this kind pacific, calls it according to <lb/>
            its nature. I But the warlike, on the other hand,1 which is <lb/>
            entirely different from the pacific, a person would correctly <lb/>
            call Pyrrhic; which imitates the careful guarding against all <lb/>
            blows and hurlings by leanings away,2 and by every kind of <lb/>
            yielding and leapings on high, together with a lowering of the <lb/>
            body; and the contrary to these, which are borne along to <lb/>
            active gestures in the shooting of arrows, and the hurling of <lb/>
            javelins, and which attempt to imitate the infliction 3 of all kinds <lb/>
            of blows. 4 But that which is erect and braced up in these, <lb/>
            when an imitation takes place of good bodies and souls, becom­ <lb/>
            ing straightforward for the most part of the limbs of the body, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. c. 18. </note> <lb/>
            right.4 In this way, on the other hand, we must look upon <lb/>
            the pacific dancing of each,1 whether a person lays hold or <lb/>
            not of the beautiful dancing, and conducts himself in a be­ <lb/>
            coming manner in the dances of men, acting according to law. <lb/>
            It is necessary, then, to separate first the dancing about which <lb/>
            there is a doubt from that about which there is not a doubt. <lb/>
            Now what is this ? And how must we separate them ? Such then <lb/>
            as is Bacchic, and belongs to those that follow the Bacchants, <lb/>
            whom some persons, 2calling by the name of Nymphs, Pans, <lb/>
            Silenuses, and Satyrs, say that they imitate, and,2 drunk with <lb/>
            wine, perform3 purifications and certain mystic rites, the whole <lb/>
            of this kind of dancing it is not easy to define, as being neither <lb/>
            pacific, nor adapted to war, or (to say) what it means. But it <lb/>
            seems to me that it is nearly the most correct to define it in <lb/>
            this way, by placing the warlike dancing apart, and apart too <lb/>
            the pacific, and to assert that this kind of dancing is not <lb/>
            adapted to a civil4 life. Leaving it, therefore, to lie down <lb/>
            lying there,5 let us return to the warlike and pacific dancing, <lb/>
            as being indubitably ours. Now the kind of the unwarlike <lb/>
            Muse, and that which honours6 the gods and the sons of the <lb/>
            gods by dancing, 7 will become altogether one kind,7 when it <lb/>

            pleasures, after we have escaped from certain labours there1 <lb/>
            and dangers to what is good; but the other, when there is a <lb/>
            preservation and increase of former good things, possessing <lb/>
            pleasures milder than them;2 since in matters of this kind, <lb/>
            every one is affected with greater movements in the body, when <lb/>
            the pleasures are greater, but with less, when they are less; <lb/>
            and he, who is more orderly, and more exercised in fortitude, <lb/>
            exhibits less changes of movement; but he, who is timid, and <lb/>
            unexercised in temperance, the more vehement; and generally <lb/>
            every one, who emits a sound, whether in singing or in speak­ <lb/>
            ing, is not entirely able to exhibit tranquillity in his body. <lb/>
            Hence an imitation of what has been said, taking place by <lb/>
            gestures has produced the whole of the art of dancing. In <lb/>
            all these occasions, one, person amongst us moves elegantly, <lb/>
            but another inelegantly. Now it is fitting for him, who re­ <lb/>

            relating to the dancings 3 of those who are doing well, and are <lb/>
            moderate in their pleasures,3 how correctly and at the same <lb/>

              of imitations about them to always appear.2 Thus then let <lb/>
              whatever are the sports pertaining to laughter, which we all call <lb/>

              utmost of our power, poets of a tragedy the most beautiful and <lb/>
              best. For the whole of our polity consists in an imitation of <lb/>
              a life the most beautiful and best, which we say is in reality <lb/>
              the truest tragedy. You, therefore, are poets, and we too <lb/>
              are poets of the same kind, being your opponents in art, and <lb/>
              antagonists in the most beautiful drama, which true law alone <lb/>
              has naturally completed,4 as is the hope in us. But do not <lb/>

            which a person ought to learn the first; and, with this instruc­ <lb/>
            tion as the guide, to go on to the rest. For thus a necessity <lb/>
            has overtaken him naturally, with which we say no divinity <lb/>
            contests at present, or ever will contest.</p>
          <p>Clin. What has been asserted at present, 0 guest, seems <lb/>
            to have been somehow truly asserted, and you speak according <lb/>
            to nature.</p>
          <p>Athen. Such is the case, Clinias. But it is difficult for <lb/>
            a person, who has previously arranged thus for himself, to lay <lb/>
            down laws in this manner. But if it seems good to you, we <lb/>
            will lay down laws for ourselves in a more accurate manner at <lb/>
            some other time.</p>
          <p>Clin. You seem to is, guest, to fear our habit of ignorance <lb/>
            on matters of this kind. You do not, however, justly fear. <lb/>
            Endeavour then to speak, concealing nothing on this account.</p>
          <p>Athen. I fear the very things you are now speaking of; but <lb/>
            I fear much more those, who have indeed laid hold of these <lb/>
            points of education, but have laid hold of them improperly. <lb/>
            For an ignorance of all things is by no means a dreadful thing <lb/>
            nor slippery,1 nor yet the greatest evil; but much skill and <lb/>
            great learning united to an improper education, is a calamity <lb/>
            much greater than these.2</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>[21.] Athen. It is necessary then to say that the free-born <lb/>
            ought to learn of each of these subjects so much as the great <lb/>
            mass of boys in Ægypt learn together with their letters. For, <lb/>
            in the first place, the rules relating to reckoning have been so <lb/>
            artlessly devised for children, that they learn it in sport, and <lb/>
            with pleasure ; (for there are)3 distributions of certain apples <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated as if the Greek were not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΣΦΟΔΡΟΝ</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΣΦΑΑΕ</foreign>- <lb/>

            Ægypt were taught numeration, there is a sad want of perspicuity; so <lb/>
            much so that Athenæus, in xv. p. 671, F., has taken upon himself to solve <lb/>
            what he calls a Platonic problem, by saying, that in the allusion to the <lb/>
            apples and chaplets, the philosopher meant something of this kind : " He <lb/>
            wanted to discover a number, by which all might have an equal share, <lb/>
            until the last guest had entered, either of apples or chaplets. I assert <lb/>
            then, that the number 60 divided into 6 fellow-drinkers, is able to com­ <lb/>
            plete the equality. For I know that towards the beginning (of our dis­ <lb/>
            course), [i. p. 4, E.] we stated that not more than five persons supped </note> <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. VII C. 21.] </note> <lb/>
            and chaplets, the 1 the same numbers being adapted to <lb/>
            more and at the same time to fewer :1 and in the case <lb/>
            of pugilists and wrestlers, 2the assessorships and co-allot­ <lb/>
            ments 2 3in turn and in successive order,3 and 4 how they <lb/>
            exist naturally; 4 and, moreover, when playing, 5 they mix <lb/>
            phials of gold, and copper, and silver, and other things of <lb/>
            this kind, and some distribute them whole,5 adapting, as I said <lb/>
            before, to their sports the use of necessary numbers; and thus <lb/>
            they benefit those, who are learning to draw up and lead out <lb/>
            armies, and to arrange encampments,6 and to regulate a <lb/>
            household, and cause in short the men to be more useful <note type="footnote"> together; but that we are as many as the grains of sand, is evident. Now <lb/>
            the number 60 will commence in this way, when the drinking party is <lb/>
            filled up to six. The first comer to the meeting receives 60 chaplets, <lb/>
            half of which he gives to the second, and each has therefore 30; and di­ <lb/>
            viding them all again with the third comer, each has just 20; and, sharing <lb/>
            again in like manner with the fourth, just 15; with the fifth, just 12; and <lb/>
            with the sixth, just 10. And thus is completed the equality of the chaplets." <lb/>
            In which passage I have every where changed EK into EIC, and omitted <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίγνονται</foreign>after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκαπέντε</foreign>. But as there is not a word in Plato about the <lb/>
            number 60, the whole of this explanation is evidently the fanciful interpret­ <lb/>
            ation of some over-clever commentator. But for the express quotation in <lb/>
            Athcnæus of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήλων τέ τινων διανομαὶ</foreign>, I should have said that Plato <lb/>
            wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήλων τετμημένων διανομαὶ καὶ στεφάνων ὅλων</foreign>. For thus the <lb/>
            apples cut up and the whole chaplets would answer to numbers fractional <lb/>

            (since they say)' that there is naturally inherent in all men <lb/>
            a certain ridiculous and disgraceful ignorance on all these <lb/>

          <p>Clin. What and what kind of ignorance do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Athen. My dear Clinias, I too, having altogether late in <lb/>
            life heard how we are affected on these points, have felt a <lb/>
            wonder; and it seems to me, that it is the situation not of <lb/>
            human beings, but rather of certain swine-like animals; and <lb/>
            I have been ashamed not only of myself, but of all the Greeks.</p>
          <p>Clin. About what ? Tell us, guest, what you mean.</p>
          <p>Athen. I will tell you; or, rather, I will point it out to you <lb/>
            by asking a question. And do you give me a short answer. <lb/>
            You surely know what length is ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. And what breadth is ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. And that there are these two things, and that a <lb/>
            third of these 2 is depth ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Does it not, then, seem to you, that all these may <lb/>
            be measured by each other ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Yes.</p>
          <p>A then. I mean length by length, and breadth by breadth ; <lb/>
            and that depth is naturally capable of being measured simi­ <lb/>

          <p>Clin. Very much so.</p>
          <p>A then. But, if some of these can do this neither 3 violently <lb/>
            nor quietly,3 but some can, and others not,4 and yet you ima­ <lb/>

            depth, or length and breadth against each other, do not all of <lb/>
            us the Greeks think, touching these questions, thus, that they <lb/>
            can be measured against each other in some way ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. But if this be at no time and by no means possible, <lb/>
            and yet all the Greeks, as I have said, think it is possible, is <lb/>
            it not fit, that, being ashamed of them all, we should thus <lb/>
            address them, — O ye best of Greeks, this is one of the <lb/>
            things, which we said it was base not to know. But is it not <lb/>
            altogether beautiful to know things necessary (to be known) ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. And in addition to these, there are other things <lb/>
            allied to them, in which many errors, the sisters of those <lb/>
            [errors],1 are produced in us.</p>
          <p>Clin. What are these ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Those relating to quantities that are commensurable <lb/>
            and not commensurable, by what nature they exist. For it is <lb/>
            necessary that he, who reflects upon them, should distinguish <lb/>
            them, or be altogether a person of no mark ; and it is meet 2 by <lb/>
            throwing out problems to each other, and, being engaged in an <lb/>
            amusement more agreeable than the pebble-game 3 of old men, to <lb/>
            have a love for contention in a pursuit worthy of all attention.4</p>
          <p>Clin. Perhaps so. At least it seems that the pebble-game <lb/>
            and this education are very5 different from each other.</p>
          <p>Athen. These subjects then I assert, Clinias,, the youths <lb/>
            ought to learn. For they are neither hurtful nor difficult; and <note type="footnote"> 1 Ast has properly rejected <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁμαρτημάτων</foreign> as an interpolation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In lieu of AEI the sense requires <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΔΕΙ</foreign>, as I have translated. </note><note type="footnote"> * So I should have translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεττεία</foreign> at Charm. § 47, Alcib. i. § 15, <lb/>

          <p>Clin. What is this ?</p>
          <p>Athen. We say that we ought not to search after the great­ <lb/>

          <p>Clin. You say what is reasonable. But shall we find an <lb/>
            instruction of this kind in the case of the stars ?</p>
          <p>Athen. All we Greeks, so to say, tell, 0 ye good men, a false­ <lb/>
            hood respecting those mighty divinities the Sun and Moon.</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what kind is the falsehood ?</p>
          <p>A then. We say that they never proceed in the same path, <lb/>
            and that there are some other stars with them, to which we <lb/>
            give the name of planets.</p>
          <p>Clin. By Zeus, you are saying, guest, the truth. For in <lb/>
            the course of my life, I have often seen myself the morning <lb/>
            and the evening star, and certain other stars, never proceeding <lb/>
            along in the same track, but wandering entirely. And we all <lb/>
            know that the Sun and Moon 'are perpetually doing so.'</p>
          <p>Athen. These then are the things, Megillus and Clinias, <lb/>
            which I assert our citizens and youths ought to learn respect­ <lb/>
            ing the gods in heaven, so far as this 2about all these matters, <lb/>
            so far2 for the sake of not blaspheming them, but of offering <lb/>
            sacrifices ever with good-omened words, and piously in prayers <lb/>
            approaching3 them.</p>
          <p>Clin. This indeed is right, if, first, it is possible to learn <lb/>
            that, of which you are speaking ; and next, if we are not at <lb/>
            present speaking properly about them, yet after learning, we <lb/>
            shall speak so of them. Thus much do I go along with you; <lb/>

            have heard these things, neither recently 1 nor formerly, I am <lb/>
            able to render them manifest in a little time. And yet had <lb/>
            they been difficult, I, who am in years, would not have been <lb/>
            able to explain them to you, who are in years.</p>

            which you call marvellous; but which you say it is fitting for <lb/>
            the youths to learn, and yet we are ignorant of? Endeavour to <lb/>
            speak about it, at least to this extent, with the utmost perspicuity.</p>
          <p>Athen. I must endeavour. The notion then, thou best of <lb/>
            men, respecting the Sun and Moon and the other stars, that <lb/>
            they are planets, is not correct; but the very contrary is the <lb/>
            case. For each of them perpetually traverses the same path, <lb/>
            being not many, but one, in a circle; but they appear to tra­ <lb/>
            verse many. And that, which is the most swift of them, is <lb/>
            not rightly thought to be2 the slowest, and contrariwise the <lb/>
            contrary. Now if such is the case naturally, but we do not <lb/>
            think so, if we had such notions respecting the horses, that <lb/>
            run at Olympia, or of men contesting in the long course, and <lb/>
            we called the swiftest the slowest, and the slowest the swiftest, <lb/>
            and, passing our encomiums, celebrated the vanquished as the <lb/>
            victor, I think we should not attach our praises properly, nor <lb/>
            in a manner agreeable to the racers, 3being men.3 But now, <lb/>
            when we err in the very same manner respecting the gods, do <lb/>
            we not think that, what,4 when it took place there, would be <lb/>
            then ridiculous and incorrect, takes place here at present (not <lb/>

            their end. And it is requisite to reflect in a similar manner <lb/>
            upon hunting and every thing else of this kind. 1 For it ap­ <lb/>
            pears that the office of a lawgiver is not merely that of laying <lb/>
            down laws ; but that he ought to make use of what is a mean <lb/>
            between admonition and laws;1 an idea that has often oc­ <lb/>
            curred to us during our discussion ; for instance, (when we <lb/>
            were speaking) about the bringing up of the very young. For <lb/>
            we said there were things not to be mentioned; and that, <lb/>
            speaking of them as laws laid down, we thought the notion2 <lb/>
            to be full3 of folly; but laws having been written in this <lb/>
            way, and the whole of a polity (laid down),4 the praise of <lb/>
            a citizen pre-eminent in virtue is not then perfect, when any <lb/>
            one says that he, who ministers the best to the laws, and <lb/>
            obeys them the most, is the good man; but this would be <lb/>
            said more perfectly, that he is so, who leads a life with­ <lb/>
            out stain,5 through being obedient to the writings of the <lb/>
            party, who lays down the laws and distributes praise and <lb/>
            blame. This is the most correct language for the praise of a <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal translation of Ficinus. That of the Greek is less <lb/>

            and that there is something else in addition to the laws, which is naturally <lb/>

            citizen ; and the legislator in reality ought not only to write <lb/>
            down his laws, but in addition to the laws to write down, <lb/>
            interwoven with them,1 what seems to him to be beautiful and <lb/>
            not beautiful; and the tip-top citizen should establish firmly <lb/>
            these no less than what are bound down by fines imposed by <lb/>
            the law. And we adduce as a witness the subject of our <lb/>
            present discussion ; for it will show more clearly what we <lb/>
            mean. For hunting is a thing of wide extent, comprehended <lb/>
            at present under nearly one name. For there is much hunting <lb/>
            of aquatic animals ; much of those that fly ; and still more of <lb/>
            those on land, not only of wild beasts, but that which 2 it is fit <lb/>
            to consider as the hunting of men, I mean3 in war, and much <lb/>
            too is the hunting in the way of friendship, of which one part <lb/>
            brings praise, the other blame. The thefts too of robbers and <lb/>
            armies are huntings. The legislator, therefore, who establishes <lb/>
            laws about hunting, can neither leave these unnoticed, nor, by <lb/>
            imposing regulations and fines on all, lay down laws of a men­ <lb/>
            acing kind. What then is to be done in cases of this kind ? <lb/>
            4 On the one hand, the legislator ought to praise and blame the <lb/>
            business of hunting,4 relating to the labours and pursuits of <lb/>
            youth ; and on the other hand, the young man ought to hear and <lb/>
            obey, and neither pleasure nor labour ought to prevent him <lb/>
            (from doing so) ; but let him honour what is mentioned with <lb/>
            praise, rather than what has been laid down by law, and are <lb/>
            accompanied with threats, united to fines relating to each, -land <lb/>
            perform what is enjoined.5 This being premised, the praise <lb/>
            and blame of hunting will follow in a becoming manner. For <lb/>
            that, which makes the souls of young men better, belongs to <lb/>
            the person praising, but to the party blaming that, which <lb/>
            (effects) the contrary. Let us then speak of what follows in <lb/>
            order, addressing the young men by a prayer—O friends, <lb/>
            never may any desire or love of fishing by sea, or of fishing <lb/>
            with a hook, seize you; nor, generally, of labouring to catch <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμοις ἐμπεπλεγμένα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have translated as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣν</foreign>, what the syntax requires, <lb/>

            any aquatic animals with an osier net,1 either when you are <lb/>
            awake or asleep !2 May no desire ever come upon you to catch <lb/>
            men at sea, nor to rob them, which would make you cruel and <lb/>
            lawless hunters! And never may it come into your farthest <lb/>
            thoughts3 to commit thefts in the country and city ; nor let a <lb/>
            desire, full of cleverness, but not a very liberal one,4 come upon <lb/>
            any young person to catch birds. The hunting then and catch­ <lb/>
            ing of land animals alone remains for our athletes; of which, one <lb/>
            kind, performed by those sleeping 5 ever 6 in turn, and called noc­ <lb/>
            turnal, belongs to sluggish men, and is not worthy of praise ; nor <lb/>
            yet the other(of thoseawake),7 which, enjoying a remission from <lb/>
            labour, does by nets and snares, and not by the victory of a soul <lb/>
            fond of labour, get the savage strength of wild beasts into its <lb/>
            power. That hunting then of quadrupeds alone remains as the <lb/>
            best of all, performed with horses and dogs, and by the bodies <lb/>
            of the parties themselves ; over all of which animals they get <lb/>
            the mastery by running them down, and inflicting blows, and <lb/>
            hurling darts, the parties themselves, to whom there is any care <lb/>
            of possessing a godlike bravery, being engaged with their own <lb/>
            hands in the hunt. Of all these matters then in the shape <lb/>
            of praise or blame, let this discourse have been spoken; and <lb/>
            and let this be the law. Let no one hinder these truly sacred <lb/>
            hunters from hunting, wherever they please. But no one <lb/>
            shall ever suffer any person at any place to engage in noc­ <lb/>
            turnal hunting with dogs8 and ropes. And let him not prevent <note type="footnote"> 1 The nets, to which Plato alludes, are still in use in England for <lb/>

            persons are to make to each of these monthly sacrifices, and <lb/>

            and the several seasons ; and to distribute the female festi­ <lb/>
            vals likewise, such as ought to be separated from the men, <lb/>
            and such as ought not. Moreover, the festivals of the gods <lb/>
            below, and such as are to be called celestial, and what is <lb/>
            attendant on these, must not be mixed together, but must be <lb/>
            separated in the twelfth month, sacred to Pluto,3 by persons <lb/>
            paying rites according to law : nor must persons feel, like <lb/>
            enemies, an ill will towards that god, but they must honour <lb/>
            him, as being even the best to the race of men. 4 For the <lb/>
            communion between soul and body is not better than the <lb/>

          <p>[3.] Athen. Do we then all of us know the reason, why in <lb/>
            cities at present no such dancing and contest exist, scarcely at <lb/>
            any time or in any manner, except to a very small extent ? <lb/>
            Shall we say that this happens through the ignorance of the <lb/>
            masses, and of those who have laid down laws for them ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Athen. By no means, 0 blessed Clinias. But it is proper to <lb/>
            say that there are two causes of this, and very sufficient too.</p>
          <p>Clin. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Athen. One is, that, through the love of wealth making the <lb/>
            whole of time to be without any leisure2 for the care of other <lb/>
            things except private property, on which the soul of every <lb/>
            citizen is hanging, it can have no care for other things but <lb/>
            of daily pecuniary gain ; and whatever learning or pursuit <lb/>
            leads to this, every one individually is most ready to learn and <lb/>
            to practise, but he laughs down all the rest. It is proper there­ <lb/>
            fore to mention this as one reason, why a state is unwilling to <lb/>
            engage seriously in this or any other honourable and excellent <lb/>
            pursuit; but through an insatiable desire of silver and gold <lb/>
            is willing for every man to undergo every art and artifice, <lb/>
            both the more beautiful and the more base,3 if he is about to <lb/>
            become wealthy, and to engage in a line of conduct holy and <lb/>
            unholy, and thoroughly disgraceful, and to feel no annoyance, <lb/>
            if only he possesses the power, like a wild beast,4 to eat all <note type="footnote"> 1 Namely, " the involuntary destruction of a few individuals." T. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 From hence it is evident that the favourite doctrine of the Political <lb/>

            that is honourable or what relates to war sufficiently; but by <lb/>
            causing the naturally well-ordered to become merchants, and <lb/>

          <p>Athen. I say, then, that the not-polities, of which we have <lb/>
            often spoken in our previous conversation, namely, a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, an oligarchy, and a tyranny, are the causes of this. <lb/>
            For in these there is not a single polity; but all may most <lb/>
            justly be called states of sedition. For not one willingly rules <lb/>
            over the willing, but willingly over the unwilling, and this <lb/>
            always with some compulsion. And as the governor fears the <lb/>
            governed, he never at any time willingly permits a person to <lb/>
            be handsome, or wealthy, or strong, or brave, or altogether <lb/>
            warlike. 1 These two then are nearly pre-eminently the causes <lb/>
            of all things, but of these they are really the pre-eminent.1 <lb/>
            But the polity for which we are now giving laws, avoids both <lb/>
            these. For it leads a life of the greatest leisure; and (the <lb/>
            people) are free from each other, and will, I think, become from <lb/>
            these laws the lovers of money the least. So that such an <lb/>
            establishment of a polity would alone of all existing at present, <lb/>
            probably and according to reason receive at the same time the <lb/>
            instruction that has been gone through, and the warlike sport, <lb/>
            which has been perfected correctly at least by description.</p>

            have a recollection of all gymnastic contests, so that we may <lb/>
            attend to such of them as appertain to war, and lay down the <lb/>
            rewards of victory, but to bid farewell to such, as do not apper­ <lb/>

            from the beginning, and to establish by law. And, first, must <lb/>

            second was called AiavXog, because the distance being a .straight line, <lb/>
            like a pipe, was the double of the stadium, and persons run from the <lb/>

            now considered heavy contests, namely, the fighting in heavy <lb/>
            armour, by one contending with one, and two with two, and <lb/>
            up to ten with ten. But what and to what extent it is re­ <lb/>
            quisite for a person not to suffer, or to do, to gain the victory, <lb/>
            just as recently in the case of wrestling, the parties conN <lb/>
            versant with that exercise have laid down laws, relating to <lb/>
            what is the work of a person wrestling well, or not; so it is <lb/>
            requisite to invite parties skilled in fighting with arms, and <lb/>
            to request them to lay down laws, as to who is justly the <lb/>
            victor in contests of this kind, and what regulation shall <lb/>
            determine likewise the defeated party. And let the same laws <lb/>
            be laid down respecting the females up to the time of marriage. <lb/>
            And it is requisite for us to oppose to the contest in boxing and <lb/>
            wrestling united the whole of the art of the light-shield soldier, <lb/>
            where parties contend with bows, and light shields, and short <lb/>
            spears, and in the hurling of stones from the hand and from <lb/>
            slings ; and to lay down laws on these matters, (and)1 to distribute <lb/>
            legal honours 2 and victories2 to the party conducting himself <lb/>
            the best on these points. After this it would be in the order of <lb/>
            events for laws to be laid down respecting equestrian contests. <lb/>
            There is not, indeed, much need of horses, nor many of them, <lb/>
            at least in Crete; so that of necessity there is less attention <lb/>
            given to the rearing of horses, and the contests with them. <lb/>
            For not one of you4 is in any respect 5the rearer of a chariot,5 <lb/>
            and there would be no ambition founded on reason to any one <lb/>
            on this point: 6so that for us to establish competitors in a <lb/>

            the liberty of speech, and to state what seems to be the best <lb/>
            for a city and citizens, by enjoining upon souls, that have <lb/>

            each other in a friendly manner. And it came, as was natural, <lb/>

            sacrifices, and festivals, and choirs are a care to all through <lb/>
            the whole of life. By what means then in such a state will <lb/>
            they abstain from those desires, which hurl many men and many <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγχἀνειν</foreign> one would prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυγχάειν</foreign>, " meet with." For <lb/>

            towards being temperate; and the whole of education has <lb/>

            this, the eye of the rulers is compelled not to look elsewhere, but <lb/>

            in that point,3 which we have said the legislator ought always <lb/>
            to observe. For we ever seek4 in the laws laid down what <lb/>
            contributes to virtue or not. Come then (say), should we agree <lb/>
            that this may be at present laid down legally as something <lb/>
            beautiful, or at least as not base, what part of it would aid us <lb/>
            in the road to virtue ? Whether, when it takes place, will the <lb/>
            habit of fortitude be produced in the soul of him, who is per­ <lb/>
            suaded ? or a kind of a temperate form in the soul of him <lb/>
            who persuades? Or would no one be persuaded on these <lb/>
            points ? but rather in every way the contrary of this. Will <lb/>
            every one blame the soft disposition of him, who yields to plea­ <lb/>
            sures, and is incapable of self-control ? But will not every one <lb/>
            blame on the other hand the likeness of the image in him, who <lb/>
            proceeds to an imitation of the female sex ? What man then <lb/>
            will lay down as a law such a thing as this ? Scarcely not <lb/>
            one, who has true law in his mind. How then do we say <lb/>
            that this is true? It is necessary for a person to see the <lb/>
            nature of friendship and desire at the same time, and of the <lb/>
            so-called loves, if he would reflect upon these matters cor­ <lb/>

            virtue, and which is desirous of a young person becoming the <lb/>
            best possible, to exist in the state ? and, if it were possi­ <lb/>
            ble, that we would prevent the other two ? Or how shall we <lb/>
            say, friend Megillus ?</p>
          <p>Megil. You have spoken, guest, on these very matters in a <lb/>
            manner perfectly beautiful.</p>
          <p>Athen. I was likely, as I conjectured, friend, to meet with <lb/>
            your accordance in sentiment. And there is no need for me <lb/>
            to examine what your law intends on points of this kind, but <lb/>
            for me to receive your agreement with my reasoning. But <lb/>
            after this, I will again endeavour to persuade Clinias by a <lb/>
            kind of enchantment tobe of our opinion. Let then, what <lb/>
            has been conceded by you to me, be dismissed, and let us <lb/>
            now go through entirely the laws.</p>
          <p>Megil. You speak most correctly.</p>
          <p>Athen. For laying down law itself 3 I possess a certain art, <lb/>
            which at present is partly easy, and partly in every respect <lb/>
            the most difficult possible.</p>
          <p>Megil. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Athen. We know even at present very many men, who, <lb/>
            although they act contrary to law, yet are restrained properly <lb/>
            and carefully from an intercourse with beautiful persons, not <lb/>
            unwillingly, but as much as possible willingly.</p>
          <p>.egil. When, say you ?</p>
          <p>Athen. When any one has a beautiful brother or sister ; <lb/>
            and in the case of a son or daughter, the same law, although <lb/>
            unwritten, defends as sufficiently as possible (a person)4 from <lb/>
            sleeping with (them) either openly or in secret, 5 or in any <lb/>
            other way from embracing and touching them.5 Nor does even <lb/>
            the desire of this intercourse come at all upon the masses. <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus has " cum ergo tres sint amores," adopted by Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ficinus omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπᾲδων</foreign>, and so after him does Taylor. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτου̃</foreign>, found in one MS., in lieu of TOVTOV. </note><note type="footnote"> * Ast says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκαθεύδοντα</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσπαζόμενον</foreign> are used indefinitely. <lb/>

            both in fun and oftentimes in all the so-called seriousness of <lb/>

          <p>Megil. You have spoken most truly so far as this, that <lb/>

          <p>[7.] Athen. That, therefore, which we just now said was <lb/>
            right, that for a legislator, desirous of bringing under sub­ <lb/>
            jection some one of those passions, which pre-eminently get <lb/>
            the mastery of men, it is easy to know in what manner he <lb/>
            should take this in hand. For by making this (evil) report a <note type="footnote"> doubtless knew that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πως ἂλλως</foreign> could not be written in the place of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂλλως <lb/>

          <p>Athen. You have taken me up correctly. For this is what <lb/>
            was stated by myself, that I possess an art, relating to this <lb/>
            law, of making use of an intercourse according to nature for <lb/>
            the procreation of children, by persons abstaining from a con­ <lb/>
            nexion with males, and not designedly destroying the race of <lb/>
            man, nor sowing upon rocks and stones that, which,4 even if it <lb/>
            takes root, will never obtain its naturally productive power; <lb/>
            and by abstaining from every female field, 5 in which what is <lb/>
            sown is unwilling to germinate. This law then, by becoming <lb/>
            perpetual and in power at the same time, as it is now in power <lb/>
            in the case of the intercourse amongst parents, would, 6 if it <lb/>
            prevailed in other connexions justly,6 produce benefits innu­ <lb/>
            merable. For, in the first place, it is laid down according to <lb/>
            nature. And, next, it causes persons to restrain from the fury <lb/>
            and madness of love, from all adulteries, and all the immo­ <lb/>
            derate use of meats and drinks, and to be familiar with and <lb/>
            friendly to their wives ; and many other benefits would arise <lb/>

            all, and in part the most difficult, for perpetuating this very <lb/>
            law, when laid down. For it is very easy to understand that <lb/>
            this is possible, and in what way it is so. For we have said <lb/>
            that, when this legal institution shall have been sufficiently <lb/>
            made holy, it will bring under subjection every soul, and <lb/>
            cause them through fear to be entirely obedient to the laws <lb/>
            laid down. But matters at present have come to such a pass, <lb/>
            that it appears it never can take place ; just as the practice of <lb/>
            common meals is believed to be a thing impossible for a whole <lb/>
            state to practise through its whole life and to exist ;2 and though <lb/>
            it has been proved by the fact, that it does take place amongst <lb/>
            you, yet as regards the female sex, it does not seem even in your <lb/>
            states 3to have the nature of being able to exist (for ever).3 <lb/>
            Hence through the strength of this unbelief, I said it was <lb/>

            presides over a kindred-clan, is the witness of the one, and he <lb/>
            who presides over hospitality, of the other; which deities 1 are <lb/>

            from it: but let him, who despises it, be exposed to a double <lb/>
            punishment, one, and the first, from the gods, but the second, <lb/>
            under the law. For let no one voluntarily remove the land­ <lb/>

            them, let any one, who is willing, inform the landowners ; and let <lb/>

            on the charge of his having made privately and by force the land <lb/>
            to be without a division, 2 (respecting) the party so having to <lb/>
            pay,2 let the court fix the penalty, as to what he is to suffer <lb/>
            (in person) or in purse after being defeated. After this, many <lb/>
            and small injuries from neighbours do, through their fre­ <lb/>
            quency, beget a great weight of enmity, and cause a neigh­ <lb/>
            bourhood to be disagreeable and excessively bitter. Hence it <lb/>
            is requisite for a neighbour to take every care not to cause <lb/>
            any differences with his neighbour; and to be particularly <lb/>

            For to do an injury is by no means difficult, but is in the <lb/>
            power of every man ; but to do a benefit is not in the power <lb/>
            of every one. Let him then, who, stepping over his own <lb/>

          <p>With respect to the other handicraft trades, it is requisite <lb/>
            to act in this manner. In the first place, let no person of the <lb/>

            mon to all, is engaged in an art requiring much practice, and, <lb/>
            at the same time, much learning, nor is he able 3 to attend to the <lb/>
            pursuit as a by-work. Now to labour accurately in two pur­ <lb/>
            suits, or two arts, scarcely not a single nature of man is suffi­ <lb/>

            art, and to superintend another person, exercising another. <lb/>
            This therefore ought first of all to take place in a state. Let <lb/>

            many servants, who are working for him, he very reasonably <lb/>
            attends more to them, for the sake of greater gain accruing <lb/>

          <p>[12.] With respect to food and the distribution of the pro­ <lb/>
            duce of the country, the correctness of the method near to <lb/>
            that laid down by the law in Crete, would seem, if adopted, to be <lb/>
            adopted with reason. For it is meet that all should distribute <lb/>
            into twelve parts the whole produce of the land, in which <lb/>
            way also it is to be consumed. Let every twelfth part, for <lb/>
            example, of wheat and barley, of which let all the rest of fruits <lb/>
            be the followers, that are to be divided, and all the animals in <lb/>
            each,2 that are to be sold, be divided into three parts, according <lb/>
            to a certain proportion ; one being for free-men, another for <lb/>
            their domestics, and the third for handicraftsmen and strangers <lb/>
            generally, and such as are residing with the foreign settlers, <lb/>
            in want of necessary sustenance, or are constantly arriving <lb/>
            during the exigencies of the state, or any individual. Of all <lb/>
            the necessaries (of life), let this third part so distributed be <lb/>
            alone vendible from necessity; but of the two others let <lb/>
            nothing be necessarily sold. How then would these be dis­ <lb/>
            tributed most correctly ? In the first place, it is evident that <lb/>
            we should distribute3 them partly equally, and partly un­ <lb/>
            equally.</p>
          <p>Clin. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Athen. It must needs be, that the land produces and brings <lb/>
            up each of these things worse or better.</p>

          <p>Athen. 4 In such a way then as this, 4 as there are three parts, <lb/>
            let no part have more, when distributed, either (that)5 for masters <note type="footnote"> 1_1 Here again I am in the dark, as to the person or thing meant by <lb/>

            let the distribution give 1 the equality of similitude, 1 the same <lb/>
            to all. And let each citizen, on receiving his two parts, have <lb/>
            the power to distribute both to slaves and free-men, as much <lb/>
            of his share, and of what kind, as be pleases. 2 But the greater <lb/>
            quantity of tbese2 it is meet to be distributed by measure <lb/>

            all the animals to which there ought to be food from the earth <lb/>
            and distributing it. After this it is meet for habitations to be <lb/>
            separately assigned them in an orderly regulated manner. Now <lb/>
            the following regulation is suited to matters of this kind. <lb/>
            There ought to be twelve hamlets, one in the middle of each <lb/>
            twelfth part; and in each hamlet, to be selected first a market- <lb/>
            place, and temples for the gods and the daemons, who follow <lb/>
            the gods; and whether these are some local (heroes) amongst <lb/>
            the Magnetes,3 or the holy seat of other ancients, whose memory <lb/>
            has been preserved, to these let persons pay the honours due <lb/>
            to ancient men, and found every where temples to Vesta, and <lb/>
            Zeus, and Athéné, and to him who may be the leader of the <lb/>
            others, that belong to each twelfth part. And first (it is meet) <lb/>
            for the buildings to be about these temples, where the ground <lb/>
            is the highest, as receptacles the best protected possible for the <lb/>
            garrison ; but to prepare all the rest of the country, by dis­ <lb/>
            tributing it into thirteen parts for the handicraftsmen ; and to <lb/>
            cause one portion of these to settle in the city, by distributing <lb/>
            this portion amongst the twelve parts of the whole city ; 4 (but <lb/>
            to have the other) 4 persons distributed out of the city, and in a <lb/>
            circle about it; and every hamlet to cause the race of handi­ <lb/>

            let the law be this. On the new 3 day of each 4 month, let the <lb/>

            a kind of state as we assert will be well regulated, and meet <lb/>

            For2 ever to think that in such a state a man can be born, <lb/>
            who will participate in the depravity 3of the others, the <lb/>

              become naturally so hard, as not to be liquefied, 1 (and,) as those <lb/>
              kinds of pulse are in the case of fire, so these persons should in <lb/>
              the case of laws, although ever so strong, become not wasted.2 <lb/>
              3 In favour of whom I will state what is no favour,3 first a law <lb/>
              relating to sacrilege, should any one dare to commit it. Now we <lb/>
              would neither wish, nor is it to be very much feared, that any <lb/>
              citizen amongst those, who have been properly brought up, will <lb/>
              ever labour very greatly under this disease; but their domestics <lb/>
              and strangers, and the slaves of strangers, would attempt many <lb/>
              things of this kind. For the sake of whom especially, and at the <lb/>
              same time being cautious of all the weakness of human nature, I <lb/>
              shall mention the law relating to sacrilege,4 and all the other mat­ <lb/>
              ters of that kind, as are to be cured, or 5 not to be cured at all. <lb/>
              The prelude, however, to these matters ought, according to what <lb/>
              has been formerly agreed upon, to be as short as possible. Some <lb/>
              one then would, conversing and at the same time admonishing, <lb/>
              address him, whom an evil desire calls aside by day and excites <lb/>
              by night, and leads him to plunder temples, in these words :—O <lb/>
              wonderful man, no ill, either human or divine, stirs up that­ <lb/>
              which is now urging you to proceed to an act of sacrilege, but a <lb/>
              certain madness, begotten in men from crimes of old date, and <lb/>
              not yet cleansed, and which is carried round in the form of <lb/>
              something to be expiated ; and against which you ought, with <lb/>
              all your might, to be on your guard. Learn, then, what this <note type="footnote"> by Theophrastus, quoted by Ruhnken on Timæus, p. 155, who has shown <lb/>
              that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτεϱάμων</foreign>, which was originally said of pulse that, like some kind of <lb/>
              peas, does not become soft by boiling, was afterwards applied by Aristo­ <lb/>
              phanes and Plato to a person; and, he might have added, by Æschylus like­ <lb/>
              wise in Prom. 198, and 1098. </note><note type="footnote"> 1,2 Ast would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέγγεσθαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂτεγκτοι</foreign> in lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τήκεσθαι</foreign> and <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂτηκτοι</foreign>. For the idea of wasting away is not applicable to pulse, but of <lb/>
              becoming soft rather, as in Ælian, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥστε καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀτέγκτούς τε <lb/>
              καὶ ἀτεϱάμονας τέγξαι</foreign>. Ficinus, not understanding, it would seem, the <lb/>

              <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 2. </note> <lb/>
              caution is. When any such idea comes upon you, betake your­ <lb/>
              self to expiatory rites ; betake yourself, as a suppliant, to the <lb/>
              temples of the gods who avert evils ; (and) betake yourself to <lb/>
              the society of men, who are called good, and partly hear, and <lb/>
              partly endeavour yourself to say, that every man ought to <lb/>
              honour what is beautiful and just. But fly, without turning <lb/>
              back, from the society of the wicked. And if, while you are <lb/>
              so doing, the disease becomes somewhat lighter, (it is well) ; 1 <lb/>
              but if not, consider that death is more honourable than life, <lb/>
              and free yourself from it.</p>
          <p>[2.] Since, then, we have sung these preludes to those, <lb/>
            who turn their thoughts to all such things as are unholy and <lb/>
            destructive to the state, 2 it is meet for the law to be silent in <lb/>
            the case of him who obeys :2 but to him, who does not obey, <lb/>
            to sing, after the prelude, loudly-He, who is detected in the <lb/>
            act of sacrilege, if he is either a slave or a stranger, shall have <lb/>
            the circumstance marked in his face and hands ;3 and after be­ <lb/>
            ing scourged with as many stripes as the judges shall think <lb/>
            proper, he shall be cast out naked beyond the boundaries of the <lb/>
            country. For, perhaps, after suffering this punishment, he <lb/>
            will, by being brought to his senses, become a better man. For <lb/>
            punishment, taking place according to law, is not inflicted as <lb/>
            an evil, but it nearly effects one of two things; for it makes <lb/>
            him who suffers the punishment, either better or less depraved. <lb/>
            If however any citizen shall appear to have done any thing <lb/>
            of this kind, in the shape of a crime, considered one of the <lb/>
            heinous and not to be mentioned, 4 relating to the gods, or pa­ <lb/>

            should become really similar to those legislators, who are <lb/>
            compelled by some great necessity to give laws immediately, <lb/>
            as being not permitted (to defer it) till the morrow. But it <lb/>
            is lawful for us to speak with god's will, just as it is for masons, <lb/>
            or those, who commence any other putting together of ma­ <lb/>
            terials, to bring together for ourselves dispersedly, things out <lb/>
            of which we may select what is suited to the combination <lb/>
            which is to be, and to collect them at leisure. Let us then <lb/>
            suppose ourselves to be for the present house-builders, not <lb/>
            from necessity, but those, who at leisure put aside for their <lb/>
            use some things, and put together others, so that we may <lb/>
            have to say correctly, that some portions of the laws have <lb/>
            been laid down, but others laid aside.</p>
          <p>Athen. For thus, Clinias, our survey of the laws will be <lb/>
            more natural. But, by the gods, let us consider some such <lb/>
            thing as this, relating to legislators.</p>
          <p>Clin. What?</p>
          <p>Athen. There are writings and written discourses in cities <lb/>
            by many other persons, and writings likewise and discourses <lb/>
            by the legislator.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Whether then shall we direct our attention to the <lb/>
            compositions of the rest of poets, and of such as in prose 1 and <lb/>
            in verse,l 2 have put together their advice relating to life, to <lb/>
            be remembered by their having written them down,2 and by no <lb/>
            means apply ourselves to the writings of legislators ? Or (to <lb/>
            the latter) most of all ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Athen. But surely it is not necessary for the legislator <lb/>
            alone of those who write to give counsel about things beauti­ <lb/>
            ful, and good, and just, while teaching what they are, and how <lb/>
            they ought to be studied by those, who are about to be happy.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But is it more disgraceful for Homer, and Tyrtæus, <lb/>
            and the rest of poets, to have laid down in their writings what <lb/>
            is incorrect, relating to life and its pursuits, and less so for <lb/>
            Lycurgus, Solon, and such as, being legislators, have composed <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ μετὰ μέτρων</foreign> are properly omitted in the two best <lb/>

            writings ? Or is this correct, that of all writings in cities <lb/>
            those relating to laws ought to appear, when unfolded,' the <lb/>
            most beautiful and best; 2but that those of the rest, either <lb/>
            following after them, or at discordance with them, are to be <lb/>
            laughed down ? 2</p>
          <p>3 Clin. Let us think in this way.</p>
          <p>Athen. And3 that with regard to the writing down of laws, <lb/>
            it ought to take place in states, that the writings seem to be <lb/>
            of persons, who, in the garb of a father or mother, have feel­ <lb/>
            ings of love, and possess a mind, 4 and not, like a tyrant 4 and <lb/>
            despot, commanding and threatening, 5 and after writing (de­ <lb/>
            crees) on walls, to depart.5 Let us consider then, even now, <lb/>
            whether we should, after thinking upon laws, endeavour to <lb/>
            speak in this manner, whether we are able or not. Let <lb/>
            us (gird up ourselves6 for it), exhibiting at least an alacrity, <lb/>
            and proceeding along this road, let us, if we must suffer aught, <lb/>
            endure it. And may the attempt be fortunate; and (fortunate), <lb/>
            if god pleases, it will be in this way.</p>
          <p>Clin. You have spoken well. And let us do as you say. <note type="footnote"> 1 So I have translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαπτυττόμενα</foreign>, adopted from MSS. by Bekker <lb/>

            sider, as we have attempted to do, respecting those who com­ <lb/>
            mit sacrilege, and about every kind of theft, and injuries of <lb/>
            all kinds. And let us not take it ill, if we lay down some, <lb/>
            during our legislating, and deliberate about others. For we <lb/>
            are becoming to be legislators, but are not yet so, although <lb/>
            perhaps we soon shall be. But if it seems good to you, to <lb/>
            consider about what I have said, let us, 1as I have said,' <lb/>
            consider.</p>
          <p>Clin. By all means.</p>
          <p>Athen. With regard to all things that are beautiful and <lb/>
            just, let us endeavour to look in some such way as this, how <lb/>
            we may for the present agree with, and how differ from our­ <lb/>
            selves; 2who would say that we desire, if nothing else, to <lb/>
            differ from the majority, and the majority too on the other <lb/>
            hand with themselves.2</p>
          <p>Clin. Of what kind of disagreement among ourselves are <lb/>
            you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Athen. I will endeavour to state. On the question of jus­ <lb/>
            tice generally, and of just men, and of things, and of actions, we <lb/>
            all of us in a manner agree, that all these are beautiful; 3 so <lb/>
            that if any one should strenuously affirm that just men are, <lb/>
            through their most just habit, all-beautiful, although they <lb/>
            should happen to be ugly in body, scarcely a single person <lb/>
            would, by speaking thus, be thought to speak improperly. 4 Is <lb/>
            not this true ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Athen. But let us see4 that, if all things that border upon <note type="footnote"> 1_1 According to two MSS., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς εἴρηκα</foreign> have been noted as spurious. </note><note type="footnote"> 2_2 Such is the literal version of the Greek; in lieu of which Taylor <lb/>
            has, " for we acknowledge, that we desire, though we may not be able, to <lb/>

            is to be supplied raSTa <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ σοὶ λέγεσθαι</foreign> SOKeI. But as such an ellipse <lb/>

            if <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξειε λέγων</foreign> were to be understood. But to such a question the Athen­ <lb/>
            ian could not answer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσως</foreign>, " perhaps," after he had stated distinctly what </note> <pb n="364"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IX. c. 5. </note> <lb/>
            justice are beautiful, 1the sufferings of all of us are nearly <lb/>
            equal to our doings.1</p>
          <p>Clin. What then ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Whatever action is just, so far as it partakes of <lb/>
            what is just, it nearly partakes of the beautiful likewise.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Whatever suffering then partakes of what is just, <lb/>
            it would so far, by being confessed to be beautiful, exhibit a <lb/>
            reasoning not discordant.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But if we should agree that a suffering is just, but <lb/>
            not beautiful, the just and the beautiful would be discord­ <lb/>
            ant through things that are just being said to be the least <lb/>
            beautiful.</p>
          <p>Clin. How have you said this ?</p>
          <p>Athen. It is not difficult to understand. For the laws <lb/>
            which have been laid down a little before, would seem to pro­ <lb/>
            claim what is perfectly the contrary to our present assertions.</p>
          <p>Clin. To what assertions ?</p>
          <p>Athen. We surely laid it down, that he, who committed <lb/>
            sacrilege, would justly die, and he too, who is hostile to well­ <lb/>
            established laws; and, as we were about to lay down many <lb/>
            other laws of this kind, we stopped short, on perceiving that <lb/>
            these sufferings were infinite in multitude and magnitude; <lb/>
            and that they were of all sufferings the most just, and of all <lb/>
            the least beautiful. Will not then things just and beautiful <lb/>
            appear in this manner at one time to be the same, and at <lb/>
            another to be the most opposite ?</p>
          <p>Clin. There is a danger of it.</p>
          <p>Athen. By the multitude, then, things beautiful and just, <note type="footnote"> his opinion was. To meet this difficulty, Ast would render <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσως</foreign>—“ truly <lb/>
            so." But such is not the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσως</foreign>. Plato wrote, I suspect, KA. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσως. Αθ. οὐκ οὑν όρθω̃ς ἴδοιμεν ἂν</foreign>—instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴδωμεν δὲ</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 1_1 The meaning, says Ast, is—“ Every thing that is just, is honour­ <lb/>
            able and beautiful. Hence not only what we do justly, but what we <lb/>
            suffer justly, must be beautiful; and hence no suffering that is just can <lb/>
            be disgraceful." But this is rather the explanation of the next speech of <lb/>
            the Athenian, than of the present one, where Plato asserts that what men <lb/>
            suffer is nearly on a par with what they do, as regards the numbers of each <lb/>
            set of events. But why this assertion thus follows the supposition, that <lb/>
            all things, which border upon justice, are beautiful, I must confess my in­ <lb/>
            ability to explain. </note> <pb n="365"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. IX. c. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            which are so discordant 1 on these kind of points,1 are ad­ <lb/>
            dressed as things separate.</p>
          <p>Clin. It appears so, guest.</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us then, Clinias, view again our notions, as to <lb/>
            how the accordance 2 exists on these very points.</p>
          <p>CUn. Of what accordance, and with what,2 are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Athen. I think I have clearly stated in the previous dis­ <lb/>
            course; 3but if not before, suppose me saying it now.</p>
          <p>CUn. What?3</p>
          <p>Athen. That all wicked persons are in all things wicked <lb/>
            involuntarily ;4 and that as this is the case, it is necessary for <lb/>
            this inference to follow in order.</p>
          <p>Clin. What (inference) do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Athen. That the unjust man is wicked; and that the wicked <lb/>
            man is such involuntarily. Now there is no reason for a volun­ <lb/>
            tary act to be ever done in an involuntary manner. He therefore, <lb/>
            whoever acts unjustly, will appear to act so in an involuntary <lb/>
            manner to him, who considers injustice to be an involuntary act. <lb/>
            And this too must now be acknowledged by me. For I have <lb/>
            agreed, that all men act unjustly involuntarily; and though <lb/>
            some one, for the sake of contention or ambition, may say, that <lb/>
            unjust men are involuntarily unjust, but yet many act unjustly <lb/>
            voluntarily, the other is my assertion, and not this. In what <lb/>
            way then should I agree with my own assertions, should ye, <lb/>
            Clinias and Megillus, thus interrogate me—If these things <lb/>
            are so, what would you, 0 guest, advise us respecting the <lb/>
            legislation for the city of the Magnesians ? To legislate for <lb/>
            them, or not ? 5 How not ? I shall say.5 Will you then separ- <note type="footnote"> 1_1 The words between the numerals are omitted by Ficinus. Taylor <lb/>

          <p>Clin. For what?</p>
          <p>[6.] Athen. Let us call to mind that we stated correctly, <lb/>
            that there is a great confusion and dissonance amongst our­ <lb/>
            selves respecting things just. Laying hold then of this, let us <lb/>
            ask ourselves again 2 (what shall we say).2 Since we have nei­ <lb/>
            ther found a way clearly out of the doubt relating to these mat­ <lb/>
            ters, nor defined how those things differ from each other, which <lb/>
            in all states, and by all legislators, that have ever existed, are laid <lb/>
            down as forming two kinds of injuries, one voluntary, and <lb/>
            the other involuntary, 3are they to be legally established3 in <lb/>
            this way likewise ?4 and shall the language, which has been <lb/>
            expressed by us, as if it had been spoken by some god, be dis­ <lb/>
            missed, after having said only thus much, and without assign­ <lb/>
            ing any reason, that it has spoken correctly ; shall it in some <lb/>
            manner lay down a counter-law ? This may not be.5 But it is <lb/>
            somehow necessary, before we lay down laws, to show these <lb/>
            two things as existing, and (having) another6 difference be­ <lb/>
            tween them, in order that when any one assigns a punishment <lb/>
            for either, every one 7 may follow what is said,7 and be able <lb/>
            to judge, whether it is established in a becoming manner, or <lb/>
            not.</p>

            dure that it takes place,2 (I mean) 3the denying that the per­ <lb/>
            son, who thinks so, has the truth on his side ;3 for this would <lb/>
            be neither according to law4 nor holy. But in what manner <lb/>
            these are two, if they do not differ by the involuntary and vo­ <lb/>
            luntary, but by something else perchance, I must endeavour <lb/>
            by some means to show.</p>
          <p>Clin. By all means, 0 guest: for it is not possible for us to <lb/>
            understand this at least otherwise.</p>
          <p>Athen. Be it so. Come then, (say,) does not, as it seems, <lb/>
            much damage take place amongst citizens in their communi­ <lb/>
            cations and intercourse with each other, and yet the voluntary <lb/>
            and the involuntary abound in these transactions ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Let not however any one imagine, after laying down <lb/>
            that all damage is an injury, that in this way the injuries exist <lb/>
            in them of a double kind, partly voluntary, and partly involun­ <lb/>
            tary. For the involuntary damage done by all men is nei­ <lb/>
            ther in number, nor in magnitude, less than the voluntary. <lb/>
            But consider 5whether I am saying any thing, when I say <lb/>
            what I am about to say,5 or nothing at all. For I do not say, <lb/>
            Clinias and Megillus, that if some one hurts another, 6 not <lb/>
            willingly, but unwillingly,6 he does an injury to a person un­ <lb/>
            willing (to be injured). And in this way I will lay down the <lb/>
            law, by making legally this an involuntary injury; nor will I <lb/>
            consider a damage of this kind as an injury at all, whether <lb/>
            it be of a greater or less magnitude. And we shall frequently <note type="footnote"> 1_1 Ficinus has " antequam ad alia pergamus—” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίγνεσθαι</foreign>, found in all the MSS., in preference to <lb/>

            great or little, the law may instruct, and altogether compel <lb/>
            him, either not to dare again at any time to do such an act <lb/>
            voluntarily, or far less frequently, in consequence 1 of the punish­ <lb/>
            ment for the injury. This should any one accomplish, either <lb/>
            by works or words, or by pleasure or pains, or by honours <lb/>
            or dishonours, and by fines of money or gifts, or altogether by <lb/>
            any means whatever, (so that)2 a person may hate injustice, <lb/>
            and love, or at least not hate, the nature of justice, this is the <lb/>
            very business of laws the most beautiful. But, upon the <lb/>
            persons, whom the legislator perceives to be incurable on these <lb/>
            points, he shall impose a punishment and law,3 knowing that <lb/>
            to all such as these it is better even for themselves not to live <lb/>
            any longer, and that they will doubly benefit the rest, when <lb/>
            freed from life, by being an example to others to do no wrong, <lb/>
            and by causing the state to be devoid of bad men. In this way <lb/>
            there is a necessity for the legislator to assign death, as the pun­ <lb/>
            isher of delinquencies of this kind,4 but by no means otherwise.</p>

            property of nature resides in it, whether as an accident or <lb/>
            part, namely, anger,1 a thing naturally hard to contest with <lb/>
            and to overcome, and which overturns many things by its <lb/>
            irrational violence.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. And we speak moreover of pleasure as not being <lb/>
            the same as anger; and we say that it possesses, from a con­ <lb/>
            trary influence, a power through persuasion, united to a vio­ <lb/>
            lent deception, to do whatever the will pleases.</p>
          <p>CUn. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Athen. He too who says that ignorance is a third cause of <lb/>
            crimes, will not state a falsehood. Now the legislator, who <lb/>
            makes a twofold division, would act the better by considering <lb/>
            one kind as simple, and the cause of light offences; but the <lb/>
            other twofold, when any one is in a state of non-instruction, <lb/>
            not only by being afflicted with ignorance, but by an opinion <lb/>
            of wisdom, as if he knew perfectly what he does not know at <lb/>
            all; and laying down things of this kind, when followed by <lb/>
            power and strength, as the causes of crimes mighty and un­ <lb/>
            musical ;2 but when followed by imbecility, as are the crimes of <lb/>
            children and old men, he will consider them (all) as crimes, and <lb/>
            will ordain laws against those who commit them; (laws), how­ <lb/>
            ever, the mildest of all, and near to the greatest pardon.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak what is reasonable.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now nearly all of us say, that one of us is superior <lb/>
            to pleasure and anger, and another inferior. And such is <lb/>
            the case.</p>
          <p>Clin. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. But we have never heard even, that one of us is <lb/>
            superior to ignorance, and another Inferior,</p>
          <p>Clin. Most true.</p>

            unjust, of which I was speaking, with no variety of colouring. <lb/>
            For I denominate injustice to be wholly the tyranny over the <lb/>
            soul through anger, and fear, and pleasure, and pain, and envy, <lb/>
            and desires, whether it does, or does not, harm any one. But <lb/>
            the opinion of what is the best, by whatever way a state or any <lb/>
            individuals may think it will exist, 2should it (the opinion,) by <lb/>
            having a power in the soul, arrange in order the whole man, <lb/>
            even though it stumbles in some matter, we must say that, <lb/>
            what is done in this way, is just entirely, and (that too) which <lb/>
            is under a rule of this kind of each, and of men through the <lb/>
            whole of life best; 2 but that a damage of this kind is thought <lb/>
            by the multitude to be an involuntary injustice. However, <lb/>
            our discourse at present is not a harsh contest about names. <lb/>
            But since there have been pointed out three kinds of delin­ <lb/>
            quencies,3 let us, in the first place, still more diligently recall <lb/>
            them to our memory. Of pain then, which we denominate <lb/>
            anger and fear, there is one kind.</p>
          <p>CUn. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. But of pleasure and desires there is a second kind; <lb/>
            another the third, of hopes, and 4 a desire of true opinion <lb/>
            about that which is the best.4 Now by this third being di­ <lb/>
            vided into two parts, five kinds will be produced, 5 as we have <lb/>
            just now stated,5 for which we must lay down five laws, dif­ <lb/>
            fering from each other in two genera.</p>

          <p>[8.] Athen. But let us after this proceed to the point, from <lb/>
            which we have digressed, and finish the laying down of laws. <lb/>
            Now the subjects laid down by us were respecting those, who <lb/>
            rob the gods, and are traitors to their country, and who corrupt <lb/>
            the laws for the purpose of dissolving the existing polity. Of <lb/>
            these some one may perhaps commit an act, when mad, or affect­ <lb/>
            ed with a disease, or a very great age, or childishness, 2 differ­ <lb/>
            ing not at all from things of this kind.2 Of which acts should <lb/>
            any become manifest to the judges selected on each occasion, <lb/>
            either by the party himself informing, or a person making an <lb/>
            excuse in behalf of the perpetrator, and he be decreed, when <lb/>
            in this state, to have acted contrary to the law, let him pay <lb/>
            simply for the damage, whatever he may have done; and let him <lb/>
            be exempt from other punishments, unless by having killed any <lb/>
            one his hands are not clean from murder; for in this case let <lb/>
            him depart to another country, and dwell there in exile during a <lb/>
            year ; but if he returns before the time prescribed by the law, <lb/>
            or puts his foot on the whole3 of his native land, let him be <lb/>
            imprisoned by the guardians of the laws for two years in the <lb/>
            public gaol, and then released from bonds.</p>
          <p>Since then we have begun with murder, let us endeavour <lb/>
            to lay down laws completely for every kind of it. And, in <lb/>

            And let him not dishonour 2 some of so-called2 old stories of <lb/>

            to death, was, when recently dead, angry with his mur­ <lb/>

            slew him, passing the time in his own seats, [familiar <lb/>

            ed with all his might the murderer and his doings, by having <lb/>
            Memory 5 as an ally. On this account, it is requisite for the <lb/>
            doer to withdraw himself from the sufferer through all the <lb/>

              city first meets him,1 release him 2 and send him safe from <lb/>
              harm to the country over the borders.2 But if any one with <lb/>
              his own hand kills a free-man, and what is done is done <lb/>
              through passion, it is meet, in the first place, to make a two­ <lb/>
              fold distinction in a thing of this kind. For a thing is done <lb/>
              in a passion by those who, on a sudden, and without intend­ <lb/>
              ing to kill, destroy by blows, or such other means, a person, <lb/>
              3on the instant that an impulse arises, and when repentance is <lb/>
              close upon the deed ;3 and (a deed is done) in a passion by <lb/>
              those too, who, having been befouled by words or deeds of dis­ <lb/>
              honour, pursue with revenge and subsequently kill a person, <lb/>
              intending to murder, and for the deed there is no repentance. <lb/>
              We must therefore, as it seems, put down two kinds of murder, <lb/>
              and both of them as arising nearly from passion, and they may <lb/>
              be said most justly to be between the voluntary and the in­ <lb/>
              voluntary. 4 Each, however, is only a likeness.4 For, he who <lb/>
              stores up his anger, and does not immediately (and) 5 suddenly, <lb/>
              but with malice prepense 6 after a time revenge himself, is like <lb/>
              to the voluntary ; but he, who, without storing up8 his anger, <lb/>
              does on the instant [immediately]9 gratify his passion, <lb/>
              without premeditation, is like to the involuntary. He is not, <lb/>
              however, altogether involuntary, but the likeness of the in­ <lb/>
              voluntary. On this account, the murders committed in anger <lb/>
              are difficult to define, whether one ought to lay down laws for <lb/>
              them, as being voluntary, or some of them involuntary. The <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal version of the Greek. Ficinus has, what is less <lb/>

          <p>[9.] Athen. Let us then return again to the subject and <lb/>
            say, that if any one with his own hand kills a free-man, but <lb/>
            if the deed, when done, took place without premeditation, in a <lb/>
            moment of anger, let him in other respects suffer, as it is <lb/>
            proper for the party to suffer, who has killed a person, not in <lb/>
            a passion; but let him of necessity be an exile for two years, <lb/>
            and thus punish his passion. But he, who in a passion, but <lb/>
            with malice prepense, commits a murder, let him (suffer) in <lb/>
            other respects as the former does ; but let him be an exile for <lb/>
            three years, as the other is for two, and be punished for the <lb/>
            greatness of his passion by a longer time. And let this be held <lb/>
            1 universally respecting these matters.1 It is difficult however <lb/>
            to give laws on such matters with accuracy. For sometimes of <lb/>
            these two murders, the one, which is held by the law to be the <lb/>
            more atrocious, is the milder; and that, which is the milder, <lb/>
            would be the more atrocious, 2 according as the murder is <lb/>
            committed in a more savage or a more gentle manner.2 But <lb/>
            for the most part the deeds take place according to what has <lb/>
            been mentioned already. Of all these matters, therefore, it is <lb/>
            meet for the guardians of the laws to have the cognizance ; <lb/>
            and, when the period of the exile shall have expired3 to each <note type="footnote"> 1—1 As four MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθόδου</foreign>, and six <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτοις</foreign>, Bekker and Stalb. <lb/>

            in the madness of anger to dare to murder one of his parents, <lb/>
            if the deceased shall, before he expired, have voluntarily ab­ <lb/>
            solved the perpetrator of the murder, let him be purified as <lb/>
            they are, who commit murder involuntarily, 1 and performing <lb/>
            the other things that they do, let him be considered as pure; <lb/>
            but if (the deceased shall) not have absolved him, let the party <lb/>
            who has done a deed of this kind be amenable to many laws. <lb/>
            For he will be amenable to the extreme punishments for an <lb/>
            assault, and, in like manner, for impiety and for the robbery <lb/>
            of what is holy, because he has robbed his parent of his life ; <lb/>
            so that, if it were possible for the same man to die oftentimes,2 <lb/>
            it would be most just for a person, who had in a passion com­ <lb/>
            mitted an act of parricide or matricide, to meet with many <lb/>
            deaths. For in the case of him, whom no law will permit, even <lb/>
            when defending himself and about to be made an end of by <lb/>
            his parents, to destroy his father or mother, who have brought <lb/>
            his nature to the light, and whom (the legislator) shall order3 <lb/>
            to endure all things rather than do a deed of this kind, how <lb/>
            would it be fitting for such a person to meet with punishment <lb/>
            legally in any other way? Let death then be laid down <lb/>
            as the punishment for him, who in a passion kills either his <lb/>
            father or mother. But if a brother shall in his own defence, <lb/>
            during a fight occurring in a sedition or in any other similar <lb/>
            manner, kill a brother, while warding off the party, who first <lb/>
            had recourse to his hands,4 let him be held clear in the <lb/>
            same manner, as he who kills an enemy; and similarly, if <lb/>

          <p>[11.] Whosoever shall designedly and unjustly kill with his <lb/>
            own hand any one soever of his tribes-men, let him, in the <lb/>
            first place, be debarred from legal rights, nor let him pollute <lb/>

            first of all take upon himself the pollution, and the hatred of <lb/>
            the gods, 3 as the imprecation by the law provokes the report; ;3 <lb/>

              ment. To such a person a god knows what ought to take <lb/>
              place on other points, and relating to purification and burial; <lb/>
              about which it is necessary for the nearest relatives to inquire <lb/>
              of the (holy) interpreters, and at the same time the laws re­ <lb/>
              lating to them, and to do according to the orders given by <lb/>
              them; but let the tombs of those, who have perished thus, be <lb/>
              in the first place by themselves, and with no one buried in them ; <lb/>
              next, let them be in the twelve boundaries of the divisions, which <lb/>
              are uncultivated and without a name ; and bury them1 without <lb/>
              honour, nor mark their tombs with any pillars or names. But <lb/>
              if a beast of burden or any other animal shall kill any person, <lb/>
              except such as may do so in some public contest, let the rela­ <lb/>
              tions prosecute the causer of the death: and let the Land- <lb/>
              Stewards, upon whom and how many the relative shall im­ <lb/>
              pose the task, decide upon the matter; and let them destroy <lb/>
              the condemned animal, and cast it2 beyond the borders. If <lb/>
              any lifeless thing deprives a man of life, except lightning, or <lb/>
              any other such-like bolt sent from a god, but of all the rest <lb/>
              that kill a person, by either the person falling upon it, or it <lb/>
              falling upon the person, let the nearest of kin appoint the <lb/>
              nearest neighbour to be a judge for him, and let him make an <lb/>
              expiation both for himself and the whole of his kindred; but <lb/>
              drive the thing condemned beyond the borders of the country, <lb/>
              as has been stated in the case of the living kind. If any one <lb/>
              is found dead, and the murderer is not known, and is not to <lb/>
              be discovered by parties searching not carelessly, let there be <lb/>
              proclamations, as in other cases; and let the heir-at-law3 <lb/>
              make a proclamation against the perpetrator of the murder, and <lb/>
              state in the Market-place that the person, who has murdered so <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλίᾳ</foreign>— I should prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνανδρίας δουλείᾳ</foreign>, " the slavery to unmanli­ <lb/>

              known, and shall be cast out unburied, beyond 2the country <lb/>
              of the sufferer.2 Let this one law then be laid down by us <lb/>
              as decisive on the subject of murder. And thus (be it said) up <lb/>
              to this point about matters of this kind.</p>
          <p>But for killing whom,3 and on what conditions, a person <lb/>
            would be properly pure, let this be laid down. If any one <lb/>
            catches a thief, entering his house by night, for the purpose <lb/>
            of stealing his property, and kills him, let him be pure. In <lb/>
            like manner, let him be pure, who kills a cloak-stripper4 in his <lb/>
            own defence. And if any one commits a rape upon a free-born <lb/>
            woman or a boy, let him be put to death with impunity, either <lb/>
            by the party treated with insult and violence, or by the father, <lb/>
            or brothers, or sons of the party. And if a man comes upon <lb/>
            his wedded wife, while being ravished, and kills the party using <lb/>
            violence, let him be pure by the law. And if any one, while <lb/>
            assisting his father, when doing nothing 5unlawful and un­ <lb/>
            holy,5 or his mother, or children, or brothers, or joint-parent <lb/>

            spect pure.</p>
          <p>[13.] Let these then be the laws laid down relating to the <lb/>
            nurture and education of a living soul, with which if it meets <lb/>
            it may live; but not meeting, the reverse; and relating also to <lb/>
            violent deaths, what punishments there ought to be for them. <lb/>
            Mention too has been made of the nurture and education of <lb/>
            bodies ; and what is close upon those subjects, namely, actions <lb/>
            done with violence by persons to each other, both voluntary <lb/>
            and involuntary, we must define according to our power, what <lb/>

            1 they would each of them possess what is suited to them.1 For <lb/>
            these, it appears, would be properly laid down as laws after <lb/>
            those. Now the person of the least mark amongst those, who <lb/>
            have turned themselves to law, would rank wounds, and mu­ <lb/>
            tilations from wounds, as secondary to murders. Wounds <lb/>
            then are to be divided in the same manner as murders have been <lb/>
            divided. For some are involuntary, others done in a passion, <lb/>
            some through fear; but such as take place from design are called 3 <lb/>
            voluntary. Now about all such something of this kind must be <lb/>
            premised ; that it is necessary to lay down laws for mankind, <lb/>
            and for them to live according to law, or for them to differ not <lb/>
            at all from animals the most savage in every respect. And the <lb/>
            cause of this is, that the disposition of not a single man is natur­ <lb/>
            ally sufficient to know what is conducive to a polity amongst <lb/>
            men ; and, when it does know, to be always able to do and wish <lb/>
            what is the best. For first it is difficult to know that not private <lb/>
            but public interests must necessarily be the object of the true <lb/>
            science of polities-for a common interest binds states, but a <lb/>
            private one tears them asunder-and that it conduces to both <lb/>
            public and private interests, when the public are well estab­ <lb/>
            lished rather than when the private are so. Secondly, that, <lb/>
            although a person should obtain sufficiently from art the know­ <lb/>
            ledge that such things are so naturally, yet should he after this <lb/>
            possess power in the state, without being brought to book,4 and <lb/>
            hold it in his own hands entirely, he would never be able to re­ <lb/>
            main in this opinion, and continue to live, while nourishing the <lb/>
            public interest in a state as the leading one, and the private as <lb/>
            following the public ; but his mortal nature will ever urge him <lb/>
            on to the wish to possess more, and to his own individual well­ <lb/>
            doing. (For) through irrationally avoiding pain, and pursu­ <lb/>
            ing pleasure, it will set both of these before what is more <lb/>
            just and excellent; and, by producing a darkness in itself, it <lb/>
            will at length fill both itself and the whole state with every <lb/>
            ill. Since should any man, born with a divine destiny, be <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal version of the Greek. Ficinus has " commode <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. IX. c. 13.] </note> <lb/>
            1 naturally competent to comprehend1 this,2 he would require <lb/>
            no laws for the government of himself. For there is no law <lb/>
            or order superior to science; nor is it lawful for intellect to be <lb/>
            the minister, and the slave of any thing, but the ruler of all, if it <lb/>
            is thus3 true and really free by nature. But now (it is not <lb/>
            so); 4 for it does not exist any where and in any manner, ex­ <lb/>
            cept to a small extent. On this account then we must choose <lb/>
            the second in rank, namely, order and law ; 5 which the one for <lb/>
            the most part sees and beholds, but the other is entirely unable.5 <lb/>
            Thus much then has been stated for the sake of these matters ; <lb/>
            and let us now ordain what he ought to suffer (in person), <lb/>
            or pay (in purse), who wounds or otherwise6 injures another. <lb/>
            7 For it is easy for every one upon every point to take up cor­ <lb/>
            rectly of a party having wounded what thing, or what per­ <lb/>
            son, or in what manner, or whether are you speaking;7 for <lb/>
            there are numberless things of this kind and very different <lb/>
            from each other. It is therefore impossible to commit to <lb/>
            courts of justice, to decide upon all these matters, or not <lb/>
            one. For it is necessary to commit in the case of all to decide <lb/>
            upon this one point, whether each of these acts have taken place <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσει ἱκανὸς</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">παραλαβει̃ν δυνατὸς</foreign>— But <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνατὸς</foreign> is <lb/>
            evidently an interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱκανὸς</foreign>—which was probably wanting in the <lb/>

            with TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">πότερον</foreign>, and which last he refers to the question touching the <lb/>

            or not; but on the other hand not at all to commit to them, (to <lb/>
            decide) upon this point, what the party, who has done any of <lb/>
            these injuries, ought to be fined (in purse), and suffer (in <lb/>
            person) ; and yet (for the law-giver 1) himself to lay down laws <lb/>
            upon all questions, small and great, is nearly impossible.</p>
          <p>CUn. What then is the inference consequent upon this ?</p>
          <p>Athen. It is this ; that some matters should be committed <lb/>
            to courts of justice, and others not, but be 2left to (the legis­ <lb/>
            lator) himself.</p>
          <p>CUn. What then are the matters, which are to be laid down <lb/>
            by law, and what those to be committed to courts of justice ?</p>
          <p>[14.] Athen. After the preceding, it would be the most <lb/>
            correct to say this ; that, in a state, where the courts of <lb/>
            justice are depraved and dumb, and concealing 3 their opinions <lb/>
            pass sentence in private ; and, what is still more dreadful than <lb/>
            this, when, not in silence, but full of noise, as in a theatre, <lb/>
            they praise and blame with an uproar each of the orators in <lb/>
            turn ; then is a grievous calamity wont indeed to occur to the <lb/>
            whole state. It is not then a fortunate circumstance for a <lb/>
            person to be laid hold of by some necessity to legislate for <lb/>
            courts of justice of this kind; nevertheless, when he is laid <lb/>
            hold of by a necessity, 4 he must commit to them to order fines <lb/>
            only relating to matters of the slightest kind, but he must him­ <lb/>
            self distinctly lay down those relating to the most numerous,4 <lb/>
            5 if he would ever legislate correctly 6 for such a kind of polity.5 <lb/>
            But in a state, where courts of justice are established as correctly <lb/>
            as possible, and those, who are about to judge, are brought up <lb/>
            well and undergo a scrutiny with all accuracy, there it is right <lb/>
            and it will be well to commit to such judges to decide upon most <lb/>
            points relating to those who are found guilty, as to what they <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν τὸν νομοθέτην</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν</foreign> <lb/>

            are to suffer (in person), or to pay (in purse). Against us then <lb/>
            there will be no cause of complaint for our not laying down laws <lb/>
            relating to matters the greatest and most numerous, into which <lb/>
            judges, who have been educated in the meanest manner, would <lb/>
            be able to look, and to adapt to each offence a punishment <lb/>
            suited to the suffering and act. But since we are of opinion, <lb/>
            that those, for whom we are laying down laws, will be not the <lb/>
            least clever of judges in such matters, we must commit to their <lb/>
            decision the greatest number of cases. However, as we have <lb/>
            often said and done during the previous laying down of the laws, <lb/>
            that by giving an outline and types of punishments, we have <lb/>
            presented to judges patterns for their never going beyond <lb/>
            the line of justice ; and, as this was then correctly done, so <lb/>
            must we now do likewise the very same thing, while return­ <lb/>
            ing again to the laws. Let then the outline1 (of the laws) re­ <lb/>
            lating to wounds be thus laid down. If any one, having both <lb/>
            the intention and wish to kill a friend, except it be those <lb/>
            whom the law ordains, shall wound, but is unable to kill him, <lb/>
            towards the party with such intentions, so inflicting a wound, it <lb/>
            is not meet to feel a pity nor to pay a regard to him, otherwise <lb/>
            than by compelling him to undergo the punishment of murder, as <lb/>
            if he had actually killed his friend ;2 and, by doing reverence to <lb/>

            come together, and decide to deliver the offender to his pa­ <lb/>

            the fine be a matter of doubt, let the kindred on the male side <lb/>
            fix the fine definitely. And if they are unable (to decide), let <lb/>

            owner give up the slave to the wounded person, to use him as <lb/>
            he pleases; but if (the owner) does not give him up, he him­ <lb/>
            self shall remedy the wrong. And if any one brings an ac­ <lb/>
            cusation touching what has happened, as being a plan arising <lb/>
            from an arrangement between the slave and the wounded <lb/>
            party, let him contest the matter; and if he does not get a ver­ <lb/>
            dict, let him pay the damage threefold ; but if he does, let him <lb/>
            hold the party planning as amenable together with the slave <lb/>
            under the statute of slavery. But let him, who involuntarily <lb/>
            wounds another, pay a simple fine; for no legislator is com­ <lb/>
            petent to be the ruler over accident; and let the judges be. <lb/>

          <p>[16.] All the aforesaid sufferings come under the class of <lb/>
            violent; and violent too is every kind of assault and disfigure­ <lb/>

            happens to be present, if he is neither of an equal age, nor <lb/>
            younger than the combatants, prevent them ; or 4 (if he does <lb/>
            not prevent them,) 4 let him be considered a bad man according <lb/>
            to law. But if he is of the same age with, or younger than,, the <lb/>
            person struck, let him defend the injured party, as if he were <lb/>
            his brother or father, or a person still more remote ;5 and fur­ <lb/>

            the punishment for an assault and disfigurement, as stated ; <lb/>
            and if he is found guilty, let him be put into prison for not <lb/>
            less than a year ; 6 and if the judges fix the fine for a longer <lb/>
            period,6 let the time so fixed be considered as positive. If a <lb/>
            stranger or a settler strikes his senior by twenty years or more, <lb/>
            let the same law have the same power, with respect to the <lb/>
            assistance of those who are present. And let him, who is de­ <lb/>

            The third, when, apart from the acts previously detailed, a <lb/>

            longing to them, without having persuaded them (to suffer <lb/>
            it). 5 The fifth consists in unjustly calling to account the <lb/>
            political conduct of any citizen.5 6 For each of these there <lb/>
            must be assigned a law in common.6 For in the case of <lb/>

            No one, who believes that there are gods, conformably to laws, <lb/>
            has ever at any time voluntarily done an impious act, or <lb/>
            spoken a word contrary to the laws ; but he, 2 who does or says <lb/>
            an impious deed or word against the gods,2 suffers one of these <lb/>
            three things ; either he does not think, what I have stated;3 <lb/>
            or, secondly, that, although they exist, they take no care of <lb/>
            mankind ;4 or, thirdly, that they are easily appeased by sacri­ <lb/>
            fices,5 and drawn aside by prayers.6</p>
          <p>Clin. What then shall we do, and what shall we say to <lb/>
            them ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us, my good man, first hear, what I prophesy <lb/>
            they will jocosely say in contempt of us.</p>
          <p>Clin. What?</p>
          <p>Athen. Perhaps they will say with a banter—O guests from <lb/>
            Athens, and Lacedasmon, and Cnossus, you speak the truth. <lb/>
            For some of us think 7the gods are no gods7 at all; others, <lb/>
            8that they take no care of us; and others, that they are drawn <lb/>

            then proper, as you have deemed it with respect to the laws, <lb/>
            that, before you threaten us severely, you should endeavour <lb/>

          <p>[2.] Athen. There are certain stories put into writing <lb/>
            amongst us, which, as I understand, are, through the virtue of <lb/>
            your polity, not amongst you, some in a kind of verse, and <lb/>
            others out of it, which speak of the gods. The most ancient <lb/>
            (assert), that the first nature was that of Uranus1 and the other <lb/>
            (gods); and proceeding they detail, not far from the beginning, <lb/>
            the birth of the gods, and how after being born they had in­ <lb/>
            tercourse with each other. Upon those, who hear the accounts, <lb/>
            whether they are well or not upon any other ground, it is not <lb/>
            easy to cast a censure, as they are of the olden time; but as <lb/>
            regards the attention and honour to be paid to parents, I <lb/>
            would never praise them, nor say that they are beneficial, nor <lb/>
            that they have been correctly2 told at all. Let then, what re­ <lb/>
            lates to the writings of the ancients, be dismissed and bidden <lb/>
            farewell, and let them be spoken of, as may be pleasing to the <lb/>
            gods. But let the poetry3 of the young and wise4 be blamed <lb/>
            as the cause of evil; for the language of such persons effects <lb/>
            this. For when you and I, detailing the proofs, that there are <lb/>
            gods, bring forward those very things, the Sun and Moon, <lb/>
            and Stars, and the Earth, as being gods and of a god-like nature, <lb/>
            they, who have been persuaded by these wise men, would say <lb/>
            that they are 5 earth and stones,5 and incapable of paying any <lb/>
            regard to human affairs; and that such ideas are cleverly <lb/>
            wrapped round in a paste of words6 to render them plausible. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have thus translated <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐρανου̃</foreign>: for it alludes to a person, not a <lb/>

            perhaps have compared the Sun to a large diamond, or a mass of pure <lb/>
            carbon reduced to a solid state, and by the aid of the Earl of Rosse's tele­ <lb/>

              has continued to old age remaining in it. Two circumstances <lb/>
              have however remained as regards the gods, not indeed to <lb/>
              many, but to some ; one is, that the gods exist indeed, but take <lb/>
              no care of human affairs ; and the other after this, that they do <lb/>
              indeed take care, but are easily appeased by sacrifices and <lb/>
              prayers. If then you will be persuaded by me, you will, turning <lb/>
              over! with all your might this doctrine, 2 which has ever been <lb/>
              clear 2 to you, wait and consider whether it be thus or otherwise, <lb/>
              by inquiring of other persons, and the legislator in particular. <lb/>
              But during that period do not dare to act impiously towards <lb/>
              the gods. For he, who lays down laws for you, must endea­ <lb/>

            that fire and water and earth and air exist from nature and <lb/>
            chance, and not one of them from art ; and that the bodies, <lb/>
            next after these, of the Earth, and the Sun, and the Moon, <lb/>
            and the Stars,1 are generated through them, being entirely with­ <lb/>

            which is a portion of the power of each,2 to the spot where <lb/>
            they fall together, 3 fit together in some congenial manner,3 <lb/>
            the hot with the cold, the dry with the moist, and the soft with <lb/>
            the hard ; and that all things, which by the mixture of con­ <lb/>

            necessity, have in this way and under such circumstances <lb/>
            really4 generated the whole of heaven and all that are in <lb/>
            heaven, and animals and plants together, 5 all the seasons having <lb/>
            been produced from them ;5 and not, say they, through intel­ <lb/>
            lect, nor any god, or art, but, as we have stated, by nature and <lb/>
            chance; and that art, mortal itself, being subsequently produced <lb/>
            from these, themselves mortal, generated afterwards some kind <lb/>

            and that these are different amongst different people, according <lb/>
            as each have agreed to have laws laid down for each.2 And, <lb/>
            moreover, that things beautiful by nature are of one kind, <lb/>
            those by law of another ; and that 3 things just do not exist <lb/>

            themselves about them, and are perpetually changing them ; <lb/>
            and that, what they change and when, possess then a fixed <lb/>
            authority, emanating from art and laws, but not from any <lb/>

            mentions these things, namely, fire and water and earth and <lb/>

            touched upon inquiries relating to nature? Look into and <lb/>
            examine the whole subject. For it is a matter of no small <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Almost all men, my friend, appear to have been <lb/>
            nearly ignorant what the soul happens to be, and what power <lb/>
            it possesses, with respect to other things belonging to it, and <lb/>
            its generation besides-how that it is amongst the first of sub­ <lb/>
            stances and before all, and that more than any thing else it <lb/>
            rules over the change and altered arrangement of bodies. <lb/>
            And if this be the case, is it not necessary for things allied to <lb/>
            soul to have been produced prior to those pertaining to body, <lb/>
            through soul itself being more ancient than body ?</p>
          <p>Clin. It is necessary.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now opinion, and care, and intellect, and art, and <lb/>
            law, would be prior to things hard and soft, and heavy and <lb/>
            light. And moreover the great and first works and doings <lb/>
            of art would be amongst the first things ; but those produced <lb/>
            by nature, and nature herself, which they do not correctly <lb/>

            reason, lest perchance, being of a youthful look, it persuades <lb/>
            us old men improperly, and after escaping, makes us a laugh­ <lb/>
            ing-stock ; and lest we appear, 1 after throwing ourselves upon <lb/>
            greater things, to miss even the little.1 Consider then, if it <lb/>
            were requisite for us three to pass a river, running with a <lb/>
            strong current, and I, happening to be the youngest of us, and <lb/>
            acquainted with many rivers, should say,-It is proper for my­ <lb/>
            self to make an experiment the first, and, leaving you in safety, <lb/>
            to ascertain whether it is fordable by you, older than my­ <lb/>
            self, or how it is; and, on its appearing to be in that state, I <lb/>
            were then to call upon you, and by my experience cause you <lb/>
            to pass it together with myself; but if not fordable by you, for <lb/>
            the danger to fall upon myself—I should appear to speak with <lb/>
            moderation. So now, the future reasoning is of rather a violent <lb/>
            kind, and perhaps nearly impassable, at least by your strength. <lb/>
            2 Lest then it should cause in you a dizziness and giddiness, by <lb/>
            being carried round, and put questions to you unaccustomed <lb/>
            to give answers, and afterwards beget in you an unseemly and <lb/>
            unbecoming conduct,2 it appears to me that I ought, in the <lb/>
            present case, to do thus to myself, (namely) to interrogate my­ <lb/>
            self, first, while you are hearing in safety, and after this to give <lb/>
            the answer myself, and thus to go through the whole of the <lb/>

            examined upon these points, I shall answer most securely <lb/>
            after this fashion,3 to questions of this kind. When a person <lb/>

            or does quite the contrary5 to this take place? Or, are some <lb/>
            things moved, but others remain (fixed) ? To this I shall <lb/>
            reply-Some things are moved, but others remain (fixed). <lb/>
            Do not then the things, which stand still, stand in a certain <lb/>
            place; and are not the things, which are moved, moved (in a <lb/>
            certain place) ? How not ? And some things would surely do <lb/>
            so in one spot, but others in more (than one). Are you speak­ <lb/>
            ing, we shall say, of the things, which, obtaining the power of <lb/>
            such as stand in the middle, are moved in one (spot), just as <lb/>
            the circumference of tops,6 which are said to stand still, re­ <lb/>
            volves ? I do. And we understand that, in this circumference, <lb/>
            the motion, which carries round 7 the largest and the smallest <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Let us speak 2 still further in this way, and give an <lb/>
            answer to ourselves. If all things that are produced should <lb/>
            somehow stand still together, as the majority of such persons3 <lb/>

            isted previously a change by a fall in themselves.4</p>
          <p>Athen. We will say then that the commencement of all <lb/>
            motions, and which first exists in things standing still and <lb/>
            moved, is that, which moves itself; (and) that this is neces­ <lb/>

          <p>Athen. There is surely a twofold distinction in other things, <lb/>
            and in numeration. Thus, for instance, in numeration, " even " <lb/>

            most ancient of all things, and the commencement of motion.</p>
          <p>Athen. Will not then the motion, which exists in another <lb/>

          <p>Clin. To what?</p>
          <p>[9. J Athen. If a soul leads round the Sun, and Moon, and <lb/>
            the other Stars, does it not do so to each singly.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Let us then direct our arguments to one (luminary), <lb/>
            that they may appear to suit all the stars.</p>
          <p>Clin. Which one ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Every one sees the body of the Sun, but not one <lb/>
            its soul; nor (the soul) even of the body of any other animal, <lb/>
            either living or dead ; 1 but there is a great hope that this ge­ <lb/>
            nus (of things), which is naturally altogether not perceptible <lb/>
            by all the senses of the body, would be thoroughly perceptible <lb/>
            by the Mind alone. Let us then take something of this kind <lb/>
            in our thoughts respecting it.1</p>
          <p>Clin. What?</p>
          <p>Athen. If soul leads the Sun, we shall perhaps not miss the <lb/>

            no consequence to the whole, when the small are neglected ; <lb/>
            or, if it is of consequence, he does through indolence and luxu­ <lb/>

            ranged, each part of which, as far as possible, suffers and acts <lb/>

            be happy in its life, and not for the sake of you ; but that you <lb/>
            exist for the sake of the universe. For every physician, and <lb/>

            all things would seem to have a reason. For if any one, al­ <lb/>

            their forms-for instance, water 2with a soul2 from fire,. <lb/>

            think, find it difficult to confirm by a parallel passage. Ficinus has <lb/>
            “ quæ minus peccarunt, minus profundæ,” which is evidently a guess, <lb/>
            and not a very successful one, at the meaning. Cornarius has " quæ qui­ <lb/>

            tainly more intelligible, but not to be obtained from the Greek ; and if it <lb/>
            could be, it is at variance with the train of thought, which relates to the <lb/>

              Certain souls residing on the earth, and possessing an unjust <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Let us say, then, that the three subjects proposed, <lb/>

            and that they are not to be drawn aside (by entreaties) con­ <lb/>

          <p>Clin. How not ? and we give our votes together in favour <lb/>
            of these reasonings.</p>

            with greater vehemence through the love of contention in bad <lb/>
            men. But, friend Clinias, this love of contention has been in­ <lb/>
            dulged in on this account, that wicked persons may not imagine <lb/>
            that, by being the masters in words, they have a licence to do <lb/>
            what they please, (according to) 2 3 what and of what magnitude <lb/>
            and of what kind 3 they conceive of the gods. There has then <lb/>
            arisen a readiness on this account, to speak in rather a novel 4 <lb/>
            manner. But if we have done even a little of moment to­ <lb/>

            would be <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμωρία</foreign>, although it might be <foreign xml:lang="grc">μωρία</foreign>, as the opposite to <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφον­ <lb/>
            ιστήϱιον</foreign>. Hence we must read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μωρίας</foreign>—For thus the philosopher would <lb/>
            lead us to consider wickedness to be only a kind of folly. Ficinus has <lb/>
            " supplicii nomine notatus." </note><note type="footnote"> 5—5 Such is the literal version of the Greek, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱὶ ἀσέβειαν δὲ ὂντων <lb/>
            αἰτίαις μὲν τϱισὶν, αἶσπεϱ καὶ διήλθομεν</foreign>, where Ast, despairing doubtless <lb/>
            of being able to make out the syntax, is content to give the sense in his <lb/>

            so too is Ficinus, " tres quoque impietatis, ut supra narravimus, causæ <lb/>

            gone through ; and since from each of such-like causes two are <lb/>
            produced, there will be six kinds of crimes against the gods ; <lb/>
            which, 1 as being worthy of a distinction,1 require neither an <lb/>
            equal nor a similar punishment. For to him, who may think that <lb/>
            gods do not exist at all, there may be a naturally just habit (of' <lb/>
            mind); and such become the haters of the wicked ; and through <lb/>
            their bearing ill with injustice, they do not give themselves up <lb/>
            to committing actions of that kind, and they avoid the unjust, <lb/>
            and love the just. 2 But upon whom, in addition to their <lb/>
            opinion that all things are destitute of the gods, there falls <lb/>
            a want of self-control in pleasures and pains, and to whom <lb/>
            there is present a strong memory and a quickness in learning, <lb/>
            the notion that gods do not exist, would be one circumstance com­ <lb/>
            mon to both ; but in the mischief done to the rest of mankind, <lb/>
            one effects less of evil, the other more ;2 for the one would in <lb/>
            word be full of a freedom of speech on the subject of the gods, <lb/>
            and about sacrifices and oaths, and, laughing at the others, he <lb/>
            would perhaps render the rest like himself, should he not meet <lb/>
            with punishment. But the other, who thinks as the former does, <lb/>
            is called by the vulgar clever,3 but is full of fraud and strata­ <lb/>
            gem;4 from whom many diviners are produced, and such as <lb/>
            are excited5 with respect to every kind of witchcraft; and <lb/>
            sometimes, too, from them are produced tyrants, and mob­ <lb/>
            orators, and army-leaders; and those, who plot against6 <lb/>
            private mysteries,7 and with the plans of men called so­ <lb/>

            errs in a way to deserve not one or two deaths, (but <lb/>
            more) ; 1 but the other requires admonition and bonds. In like <lb/>
            manner the notion that the gods are careless, produces two <lb/>
            errors; and that they are easily turned aside, another two. <lb/>
            Of these persons, so placed apart, such as have become so <lb/>

            one of the citizens converse with them, except those, who <lb/>
            participating in the assembly by night,3 associate for the pur­ <lb/>

            period of their imprisonment expires, if any one amongst them <lb/>

            the modest; but if not, and he is again convicted on such a <lb/>
            suit, let him pay the penalty of death. But such as, in addition <lb/>
            to their believing that gods do not exist, or that they are <lb/>
            careless, or easily turned aside, become brute-like, and de­ <lb/>
            spising mankind, allure the souls of many while living, and <lb/>
            pretend they can allure too the souls of the dead, and pro­ <lb/>

            father was convicted.</p>
          <p>But it is meet for a common law to be established in all <lb/>
            these cases, such as shall cause the masses to behave less im­ <lb/>
            properly towards the gods, both in word and deed, and may <lb/>
            render them moreover less devoid of intellect, through not per­ <lb/>
            mitting them to attend to sacred matters in a manner contrary <lb/>
            to law. Now let this law be laid down simply for all together. <lb/>
            Let no one practise sacred rites in a private d welling.3 But when <lb/>
            it enters into the mind of any one to sacrifice, let him go to <lb/>
            the public buildings, and there sacrifice ; and let him place his <lb/>
            offerings in the hands of the priests and priestesses, to whom <lb/>
            the holy ritual is a care ; and let him pray, both himself and <lb/>
            whoever else may wish to join with him in prayer. And let <lb/>
            this take place on this account. It is not easy to build <lb/>
            temples and place statues of the gods ; but to do such things <lb/>
            correctly, is the work of some mighty intellect. But it is a <lb/>
            custom with all women especially, and all4 men in sickness, or <lb/>
            in danger, or in want, and, on the contrary, when they receive <lb/>
            an abundance of any thing, ever to consecrate that which is <lb/>
            at hand, and to vow sacrifices, and to promise statues to the <lb/>
            gods, and to dæmons, and to the sons of the gods; when they <lb/>
            are awakened by frightful5 apparitions, and in dreams bring <lb/>
            up the recollection of many visions likewise; against all of <lb/>
            which things they endeavour to make for each of themselves6 <lb/>
            remedies, by filling all the streets 7 and all the villages with altars <lb/>
            and chapels, and fixing them in purified places, and 8wherever <lb/>
            a person has met with such events.8 On account of all which <note type="footnote"> 1 On the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγχάνειν δίκην</foreign>, see Ast on vi. § 9. <lb/>

            injustice unlimitedly, and give rise to accusations on the part of <lb/>
            the gods against them and those, who permitted them (to do so), <lb/>

            the whole city meet2 justly, after a certain manner, with mis­ <lb/>
            chief through the impious. The god, however, shall not blame <lb/>
            the lawgiver. For let the law be laid down that no one is to have <lb/>
            holy places in private houses; and the party, who is discovered <lb/>
            as having other places and performing orgies, except such as are <lb/>
            public, let the person, who is cognizant of it, denounce to the <lb/>
            guardians of the laws ; and let them, 3 if a man or a woman <lb/>
            has it, not having committed any great or impious crime,3 or­ <lb/>
            der the parties to carry their private sacred affairs to the pub­ <lb/>
            lic places ; and not persuading,4 let them punish with a fine, <lb/>
            until they are carried. But, if any one shall be conspicuously <lb/>

            men,5 whether by sacrificing6 to the gods in private or in <lb/>

          <p>[1.] AFTER these, the compacts with each other would re­ <lb/>
            quire from us a suitable regulation. Now a thing of this <lb/>
            kind at least is surely simple. 1 Let no one touchy as far as <lb/>
            possible, my property, nor disturb the least thing (of mine), <lb/>
            without previously persuading me; and may I, possessing a <lb/>
            well-disposed mind, act in the same manner with respect to <lb/>
            the property of others. Let us then, in the first place, speak <lb/>
            about such a treasure,2 as a person 3not descended from my <lb/>
            parents,3 has placed as a thing to be kept both for himself and <lb/>
            those belonging to him, and which may I never pray to the gods <lb/>
            to find, nor, on finding, to disturb; 4 nor on the other hand to <lb/>
            communicate with those called diviners, who in some sort ad­ <lb/>
            vise me to take up the deposit put into the ground.4 For I <lb/>
            should never be so much benefited by the possession of pro­ <lb/>

            of the soul and in justice by not taking it to myself, 5 (and) <note type="footnote"> tice. To avoid therefore this difficulty, Ast renders <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσαγαγόντες</foreign> by <lb/>

            law, which has been laid down by a man,2 ignoble by no means, <lb/>
            which says, " Thou shalt not take away that, which thou hast <lb/>
            not deposited." What then he ought to suffer at the hands of <lb/>

            trifling thing, which he did not deposit himself, but is some­ <lb/>
            times a mighty treasure, the god3 knows; 4(but let us de­ <lb/>
            clare what he ought to suffer from men.)4 Let him, who <lb/>
            first sees (the offender) give information, if such an event <lb/>
            happens in the city, to the City-Stewards ; if in the market- <lb/>

            and let the party defeated pay simply the value. If any one <lb/>

            person purify the residence of the buyer according to the law <lb/>

            for every man to consider adulteration, and lying, and fraud, <lb/>
            as forming one genus ; to which it is usual for the multitude <lb/>
            to apply the saying, although speaking improperly, that when <lb/>
            such a conduct is adopted opportunely, on each occasion, it <lb/>
            often turns out well. But as they leave the occasion, and the <lb/>
            where, and the when, in an unregulated and undefined state, <lb/>
            they do by this assertion much injury to themselves and to <lb/>
            others. But it is not fitting for the legislator to leave this <lb/>
            undefined; but he ought always to state clearly the greater <lb/>
            and lesser limits. Let them be determined now. Let no one <lb/>
            who is not about to be the most odious to the gods, perpetrate, <lb/>
            either by word or deed, a falsehood, or fraud, or adulteration <lb/>
            in any thing, when calling (to witness) the race of the gods. <lb/>
            Now such is (in the first place) 1 he, who while swearing false <lb/>
            oaths, thinks nothing of the gods ; and secondly he, who speaks <lb/>
            falsely before those who are better than himself. Now the <lb/>
            better are superior to the bad, both the elder, to speak in ge­ <lb/>
            neral terms, than the younger, and parents [better] 2 than <lb/>
            their offspring, and men than women and children, and go­ <lb/>
            vernors than the governed ; 3 all of whom it is becoming for all <lb/>
            to reverence in every other government,3 and especially in <lb/>
            political offices, 4 for the sake of which 4 the present convers­ <lb/>
            ation has come upon us. For every one of those in the <lb/>
            market-place, who by adulterating any thing perpetrates a <lb/>
            falsehood and a fraud, and calling upon the gods takes an <lb/>
            oath,5 according to the regulations and precautions of the <lb/>
            Market-Stewards, is a person who has no regard for men nor <lb/>
            reverence for the gods. 6 It is indeed a beautiful institution <lb/>
            not to defile the names of the gods, while a person is taking it <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus, whom Taylor follows, alone has “ primum—” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρείττους</foreign> is properly omitted in one good MS. </note><note type="footnote">3—3 Ficinus has " quos revereri par est, cum in omni principatu—” </note><note type="footnote">4—4 Ficinus, followed by Taylor, has " cujus gratia," as if his MS. read <lb/>

              gods.6 If then a person is not persuaded 1 (by these reason­ <lb/>
              ings),1 let this be the law. Let the seller of any thing in the <lb/>

              but after mentioning a simple one, if he does not meet with <lb/>

              it for that day at a greater or less sum. Let puffing 2 and <lb/>
              oaths be absent in the case of every thing sold. And if a <lb/>
              person is disobedient to these enactments, let any citizen, not <lb/>
              less than thirty years of age, who happens to be present, pun­ <lb/>

              he neglects to do so, and is himself disobedient (to the law), <lb/>
              let him be amenable to blame for his betrayal of the laws. <lb/>
              And let him, 3 who falls in with those who know 3 the seller <lb/>
              of an adulterated article, and unable 4 to obey the present <lb/>
              reasonings, if he is able himself to detect the party, expose <lb/>
              (the fraud) before the magistrates, and if he is a slave or <lb/>
              a settler, let him carry off5 the adulterated article. But <lb/>
              let the citizen, who does not expose (the fraud), be proclaimed <lb/>

            their morals may not happen to become freely partakers in <lb/>

            have made no will. I have said it is necessary, Clinias, from <lb/>
            looking at the harsh and difficult temper of such persons; nor <lb/>
            is it possible to leave the point unarranged. For each party <lb/>
            would, 2previous to his being about to make his Will,2 intro­ <lb/>
            duce many clauses at variance with each other, and contrary <lb/>
            to the laws, and the manners of the living, and their pro­ <lb/>
            genitors, if one gave a power for a will to be effective, simply <lb/>
            in the manner, that a person may have made it in whatever <lb/>
            state he might be towards the end of life. For most of us, <lb/>
            when we think we are about to die, are in a certain manner <lb/>
            silly in mind, and broken down in spirit.3</p>

          <p>Clin. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Terrified at this language (of the dying man),3 they <lb/>
            laid down this 4 law, that it should be lawful for any one, to <lb/>
            dispose of his property without exception entirely as he pleased. <lb/>

            yourselves to boot, as the writing of the Pythian (priestess) 7 <lb/>
            says at present. I, therefore, as being a legislator, lay down <lb/>
            that neither yourselves are your own property, nor this sub­ <lb/>
            stance of yours, but that they belong to the whole of your <lb/>
            family, both past and to come ; and further still, that both the <lb/>
            whole of your family and substance belong to the state ; and <lb/>
            this being the case, should any one by flattery insinuate him­ <lb/>

            there is an expectation that he will be sent to a colony accord­ <lb/>

            of the sons possesses a house, let him not leave to such a one <lb/>

            has been affianced, 5 [that he may be about to be her husband,] 5 <lb/>
            let him not give a share; but to her, who is not betrothed, let <lb/>

            the husband for any of his daughters, and as the son-in-law <lb/>

            without blame to his adopted son, and make for himself, ac­ <lb/>

            first the males, and afterwards the females, in one family. <lb/>
            And let the judge on reflection determine the fitness or unfit­ <lb/>
            ness of the time of marriage, by looking at the males naked, <lb/>
            and at the females naked, as far as the navel. And if there <lb/>
            is a want of kindred to families, as far as the sons of brothers, <lb/>
            and as far too as the children of grandfathers, whomsoever <lb/>

              times it harshly ordains the relation of a deceased person to <lb/>
              marry a relation. 2(For he who introduces a law of this <lb/>

              ments arise, so as to render a person unwilling to comply with <lb/>
              mandates of this kind ; and that there are those, who would <lb/>

            disobey the law, which forces6 him to accept an alliance with <lb/>

            orphans. After the first the nurture and education for each <lb/>

            the misfortune of their orphanhood may excite the least pos­ <lb/>
            sible pity for their misfortune in the case of those who have <lb/>
            become orphans.4 First then, we assert that we assign by law <lb/>
            to them the guardians of the laws to be not worse parents, <lb/>
            in the place of those who begat them; and we ordain moreover, <lb/>
            that for each year they take a care of them, as if they were <lb/>
            their own. 5 And such is the prelude we have given with care5 <lb/>
            to them and the guardians, relating to the bringing up of or­ <lb/>
            phans. For we appear to have detailed at some fitting time in <lb/>
            the previous discourse, how that the souls of the dead pos­ <lb/>

              On this point indeed the reasons are true, but long, through the <lb/>
              going round about. It is necessary likewise to believe in the <lb/>
              other traditions relating to matters of this kind, which are so nu­ <lb/>
              merous and very old; and to believe too in those who legislate, <lb/>
              unless they seem to be altogether insane, that such is the case. <lb/>
              If then such is naturally the case, let persons fear in the first <lb/>
              place the gods above, who have a perception of the desolate <lb/>

              still, the souls of those who are living, but in old age, and <lb/>
              in the greatest honours;1 for to whom there is a state under <lb/>
              good laws and prosperous, their 2 children's children live a plea­ <lb/>

              behave insolently towards orphans and the destitute; since <lb/>
              they deem (such a stated to be a deposit the greatest and the <lb/>

              a contribution for the benefit of himself and children, and to <lb/>

          <p>With regard to the remaining portion of legislation ap­ <lb/>
            plicable to guardians, in the case of orphans, and to magis­ <lb/>
            trates touching their supervision of guardians, if they had <lb/>
            not1 themselves a pattern for bringing up free children, in <lb/>
            bringing up their own, and taking care of their own property, <lb/>
            and laws relating to these very matters stated2 in moderation, <lb/>
            there would have been some reason to lay down certain laws for <lb/>
            guardians, as differing very much individually from others, and <lb/>
            causing to vary by individual pursuits the life of orphans from <lb/>
            that of those who are not so. But now, with respect to every <lb/>
            thing of this kind, the care of orphans does not with us differ <lb/>
            much from paternal care; but it is unwilling to be equalized <lb/>
            in honour, and dishonour, and in attentiveness. Hence as <lb/>
            regards this very point the law has, by consoling and threat­ <lb/>
            ening, attended to the legislation relating to orphans; and fur­ <lb/>
            ther still, a threat of this kind would be very seasonable. <lb/>
            Let him, who is the guardian of a female or a male, and him, <lb/>
            who is appointed by the guardians of the law to watch over <lb/>
            the guardian, love, not less than his own children, the party <lb/>
            who has a share in the misfortune of an orphan; nor let <lb/>
            him pay less attention to the property of the party brought <lb/>
            up than to his own, but better than according to the fore­ <lb/>
            thought 3 shown to his own. Let then every one act as a <lb/>
            guardian while having this one law relating to orphans. <lb/>
            But if any one acts otherwise (and) contrary to this law <lb/>
            in affairs of this kind, let the magistrate fine the guardian. <lb/>
            4 And let the guardian bring the magistrate, (who has acted <lb/>
            contrary to the law,) before the tribunal of select (jurymen), <note type="footnote"> 1 I have with Baiter adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ μὲν μὴ</foreign>, suggested by Grou, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ μὲν δὴ</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διῃϱημένος</foreign>, Ast would read, what Stalbaum has edited <lb/>

            dian, let him be allowed to obtain by lot a trial relating to <lb/>
            guardianship up to 2 five years from the close of the guardian­ <lb/>
            ship;2 and if any guardian is found guilty, let the court of <lb/>
            justice fix what he is to suffer (in person), or pay (in purse) ; <lb/>
            and if any magistrate shall appear to have injured an orphan <lb/>
            through negligence, let the court of justice fix what he is to <lb/>
            pay the child ; and if through injustice, in addition to the fine, <lb/>
            let him be removed from the office of a guardian of the law ; <lb/>
            and let the common power of the state appoint another in his <lb/>

          <p>[9.] Greater differences take place between fathers and sons <lb/>
            and between sons and fathers, than is proper ; in which fathers <lb/>
            will think that the legislator ought to permit them to renounce, <lb/>
            if one wishes it, a son by the public crier, (and to say) he is no <lb/>
            longer his own according to law ; and sons, on the other hand, <lb/>
            that they ought to be allowed to indict their fathers on the charge <lb/>
            of silliness, when they are disgracefully in that state through <lb/>
            disease or old age. Now these things are wont to take place, <lb/>
            when the morals of men are perfectly corrupt. For on the half <lb/>

              no one else is to other persons, 3when imprecating a curse, <lb/>
              most justly pernicious.3 Nor let any one imagine, that for a <lb/>

              when dishonoured pre-eminently by their children, is according <lb/>

              is calling upon the gods for good things to his children, shall we <lb/>

              For otherwise they would not be just distributors of what is <lb/>

          <p>Athen. Let us think then, as we observed a little before, that <lb/>
            we could not possess a statue more honoured by the gods, than <lb/>
            that of our father and grandfather, worn down by old age, and <lb/>
            of mothers and grandmothers, possessing the same want of <lb/>
            power ; which when any one honours, the god is glad; for <lb/>
            otherwise he would not hear them.5 For the statues of our <lb/>
            progenitors (still living) are wonderfully superior to those with­ <lb/>
            out life. For those, which are animated, do, when ministered <lb/>
            to by us, pray for us on each occasion ; but the very contrary <lb/>
            when they are held by us in dishonour. But (the inanimate <lb/>
            do) neither of these. So that he, who behaves properly to <lb/>
            his father and grandfather, and all persons of this kind, would <lb/>
            possess the most powerful of all statues, as regards his portion <lb/>

          <p>[12.] With respect to the cases, where one person does a <lb/>
            mischief to another by means of poisons, such as are deadly <lb/>
            have been already spoken of; but as regards other mischiefs, <lb/>

            drink, or meat, or ointments, of these nothing has been stated <lb/>
            as yet. For two kinds of poisonings 1according to the race <lb/>
            of man1 2stop the statement.2 For (the poisoning), of which <lb/>
            we were just now clearly speaking, is doing an injury to <lb/>
            bodies by bodies according to nature; but the other is that, <lb/>
            which,by sorceries and incantations and the so-called bindings,3 <lb/>
            persuades those, who dare to injure them,4 that they are able <lb/>
            to do something of this kind; and others, that they are injured <lb/>
            more than any thing by those, who are able to act the sorcerer. <lb/>
            Now these matters, and all relating to things of this kind, it is <lb/>
            neither easy to know how they exist in nature, nor, if any one <lb/>
            did know, to persuade others. But upon the minds of men, <lb/>

            that they ought not to attempt to do a thing of this kind, nor <lb/>
            to terrify the masses of mankind, frightened like children ; nor, <lb/>
            on the other hand, to compel the legislator and judge to cure <lb/>
            mankind of such fears;3 since, in the first place, he who at­ <lb/>
            tempts to make use of poison, if he does not know what he is <lb/>

            in medical science, and as regards on the other hand sorceries, <lb/>
            unless he happens to be a diviner, or an interpreter of miracles.3 <lb/>
            Let this law then be stated in words4 respecting poisons. He, <lb/>
            who employs poison, not for deadly injury 5 to a person him­ <lb/>

            common meeting. But let the magistrate, who is the president <lb/>

            victory 2 by litigating, and taking a part in causes,2 whether <lb/>
            what may have been done respecting each suit is just or not; <lb/>
            and that of this art, and of the speeches resulting from it, there <lb/>
            is a gift, if a person will give money in return. This therefore, <lb/>
            whether it is an art, or an artless skill 3 and practice, it is par­ <lb/>

            persuaded, silence (is sufficient) ; 6 but for the unpersuaded let <lb/>

            account of the greatness of the theft, but through one of them <lb/>
            being perhaps curable, but the other incurable. If any one <lb/>
            convicts before a tribunal a slave or a stranger of stealing any <lb/>
            public property, let sentence be passed on him as to what he <lb/>
            ought to suffer (in person), 5 or what fine he ought to pay,5 as <lb/>

            any time without a ruler, nor the soul of any one, either seri­ <lb/>
            ously engaged or in sport, to be ever accustomed to do any thing <lb/>
            alone itself by itself; but that in all time of war and in all of <lb/>
            peace, to look perpetually to a ruler, and, following him, to live <lb/>
            and be governed by him in the smallest things; as for instance, <lb/>
            to stand, when he commands, and to march and to engage in <lb/>
            gymnastics, and to wash himself, and to take food, and to get <lb/>
            up at night, to mount guard and to convey orders ; and in the <lb/>
            midst even of dangers, neither to pursue nor to give way to any <lb/>
            one, without the orders of the rulers ; and in one word, to teach <lb/>
            the soul by habit to do nothing apart from the rest, nor to <lb/>
            think of, or know it at all; but that the life of all men should, as <lb/>
            much as possible, be in all things collected (into one), and in <lb/>
            common. For nothing is, or will ever be, superior to, and <lb/>
            better, and more full of art than this, for the purposes of safety <lb/>
            and victory in war. And in peace, too, men must from their <lb/>
            childhood be practised in ruling over others, and being ruled <lb/>
            by others; but anarchy must be expelled from the whole <lb/>
            life of all men, and 1 of wild beasts under man. All dancings <lb/>
            moreover (it is meet) to celebrate with a view to the best <lb/>
            modes of warfare, and to practise a complete facility in using <lb/>
            the body and arms for the sake of the same objects, and an <lb/>
            endurance in food and drink, and of cold weather and the con­ <lb/>

            other (the head) has the greatest power, through possessing <lb/>
            naturally all its dominant senses. And this praise of a war­ <lb/>

            desertion lie before the war-officers, when they return from <lb/>
            camp; and let those, who have served, try each of the parties, <lb/>

            arms of the service each of the parties in a similar manner ; <lb/>

            heavy-armed, and the cavalry before the cavalry, and each of <lb/>
            the other arms in like manner to those of their comrades. If <lb/>
            any one is convicted, let it be not in his power to be a candidate <lb/>

            matters ; and besides this, let a court of justice decide what he <lb/>
            is to suffer (in person) or pay (in purse). After this, when <lb/>
            the trials for desertions have been decided, let the commanders <lb/>
            of each arm of the service form an assembly; and let the <lb/>
            party, who wishes it, have amongst his own clans a trial re­ <lb/>
            lating to the prizes for good conduct; but let him not produce <lb/>
            any testimony touching a former war, nor the confirmation of <lb/>
            his assertions by witnesses, but only of the campaign, which <lb/>
            had taken place at that time ; and 2let the crown of victory <lb/>
            to each be that of a bough ; 2 and let this person, after writing <lb/>
            out an inscription, hang it up in the temple of whatever <lb/>
            war-god he likes, as a witness through the whole of life, of the <lb/>
            decision relating to the prize of good conduct; and so of the <lb/>
            second and third prizes likewise. But if any one goes out <lb/>
            during a campaign, but returns home before his time, without <lb/>
            the commanding officers having sent him away, let there be <lb/>

            be a modest 1 virgin, and 2 is said to be so really.2 Now False­ <lb/>
            hood is naturally an object of blame to Modesty and Justice. <lb/>
            Respecting other matters then it is requisite to take care not <lb/>
            to err against Justice; but pre-eminently so, in the case <lb/>
            of throwing away arms in war; lest perchance a person by <lb/>
            making a mistake about the throwing away of arms from <lb/>
            a necessity, places such acts on the score of a reproach, and <lb/>
            brings lawsuits unjustly against a person not deserving <lb/>
            them. Indeed it is by no means easy to define one or the <lb/>
            other of these points. It is necessary however for the law to <lb/>
            endeavour to define somehow in part. Employing then a <lb/>

            his marriage with Thetis, had Hector possessed, would it have <lb/>
            been lawful for such bad men, as were at that time, to re­ <lb/>

            possess nearly a certain division. For a person would not be <lb/>
            justly called in all cases a thrower away of a shield, but the <lb/>
            loser of them. For he, who is deprived (of his arms) by a <lb/>
            reasonable display of force, and he, who throws them will­ <lb/>
            ingly away, would not be equally a thrower away of a shield ; <lb/>
            but there is a difference wholly and entirely. Let then this <lb/>
            be held as spoken by a law. If any one, being overtaken by <lb/>
            the enemy, and having arms, does not turn round and defend <lb/>

            catching at a base life, united to 2 a soulless cowardice,2 rather <lb/>
            than at an honourable death, united to manliness, against such <lb/>
            a loss of arms thrown away, let there be justice done; but let <lb/>
            the judge neglect to consider the loss mentioned above. For <lb/>
            it is requisite always to punish the coward, in order that he <lb/>

            there is no advantage. 3But what punishment will be suited <lb/>

          <p>[4.] Respecting the so-called decision of Rhadamanthus, <lb/>
            in judicial matters, it is indeed worthy of admiration. For <lb/>
            he saw that the men of that time distinctly believed that there <lb/>
            were gods, and reasonably so; because at that time the ma­ <lb/>
            jority were the descendants of gods, of whom he was himself <lb/>
            one, at least as the story goes. He appears, therefore, to have <lb/>
            thought that he ought to commit (nothing) 1 to any man as a <lb/>
            judge, but to gods; from whence causes were decided by him <lb/>
            simply and quickly. For by tendering an oath to the dispu­ <lb/>
            tants upon each matter in dispute, he was freed from them <lb/>
            with rapidity and safety. But since at present, as we have <lb/>
            stated, some portion of mankind think that the gods do not ex­ <lb/>
            ist at all; and others conceive that they take no care of us; <lb/>
            while the opinion of the greatest and worst part is, that, by <lb/>
            receiving trifling sacrifices and abundance2 of flattery, they <lb/>
            will conjointly deprive persons of considerable property, and <lb/>
            free them from harm on many occasions,3 the art of Rha­ <lb/>
            damanthus in lawsuits would no longer be suited to men of the <lb/>
            present time. For since the opinions of men respecting the <lb/>
            gods have undergone a change, it is necessary for laws to be <lb/>
            changed likewise. In the allotment of causes therefore, it is meet <lb/>
            for those who, possessing a mind, lay down laws, to take away <lb/>
            the oaths of either of the opposing parties, and for the party, <lb/>
            who has obtained by lot a trial against any one, to write down <note type="footnote"> 1I have translated, as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν</foreign> had dropt out between <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδενὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια­ <lb/>

            to know well that, while many lawsuits are occurring in the <lb/>
            state, almost one half of the parties have perjured themselves, 1 <lb/>
            by having been easily mixed up with each other at joint-feasts <lb/>
            2 and through other intercourse and private joint-producings of <lb/>
            each one.2 Let it therefore be laid down as a law that he, who <lb/>
            is about to act the juryman, shall take an oath as a juryman; <lb/>
            and that he, who appoints for the commonweal the magistrates <lb/>
            by oaths, or by the bringing of votes, 3 must bring them from <lb/>
            sacred places and do something of this kind ;3 and on the other <lb/>
            hand, that the judge of choirs and all kinds of music, and the <lb/>
            presidents over, and the umpires at, the gymnastic and eques­ <lb/>

            of men, do not bring a gain to the party forswearing himself, <lb/>
            (shall take an oath;) 4but in those, that seem to be plainly a <lb/>
            great profit to the party, who makes a denial or takes an oath, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνουσίαις</foreign>, thus introducing a needless tautology. Moreover <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένησις</foreign> <lb/>
            always means elsewhere " a producing," or " production." Opportunely <lb/>

            before a court of justice, until they are willing to do what <lb/>
            they are ordered.</p>
          <p>[5.] It is necessary moreover to consult about what it is meet <lb/>
            to do for a state, which does not make money, except by what1 <lb/>
            arises from the land, and does not import any thing,2 3touching <lb/>
            the going abroad of its own people out of the country, and the <lb/>
            reception of foreigners from other parts.3 On these points the <lb/>
            legislator ought to give advice by first persuading to the utmost <lb/>
            of his power. The intermixture indeed of states with states <lb/>
            naturally causes a mixture of all kinds of manners, through <lb/>
            strangers making with strangers innovations 4 with each other;4 <lb/>
            which thing would bring an injury the greatest of all to those, <lb/>
            who have a good polity through good laws. But, to the <lb/>
            greater number of states, as being by no means under good <lb/>
            laws, it makes no difference for the citizens 5 to be contaminated <lb/>
            by receiving foreigners, and for the citizens6 to revel in other <lb/>
            states, when a person is desirous of going abroad in any way <lb/>
            or at any time, whether he is young, or rather advanced in <lb/>
            years. But, on the other hand, for these never to receive <lb/>
            others, and never themselves to travel elsewhere, is not at all <lb/>
            suitable; and it would appear to be a behaviour rustic and <lb/>
            rude to the rest of mankind, who would make use of harsh <lb/>
            names, such as the so-called stranger-expellings,7 and manners <lb/>

            not, as far as they happen to fail in the substance of virtue, <lb/>
            fail so far in their judgment of others, who are vicious and <lb/>
            useless, 1 but there is even in the bad a something divine and fe­ <lb/>
            licitous in hitting the mark, so that very many even of the very <lb/>
            bad distinguish very well, both by their words and thoughts, <lb/>
            the better sort of men and the worse. And hence the ex­ <lb/>
            hortation to many states is correct, to set some value on the <lb/>
            good opinion of the multitude. For it is a thing the most <lb/>
            correct and of the greatest consequence for a man truly good <lb/>
            to hunt in this way after a life of fair repute; for without it, <lb/>
            he will by no means become the perfect man. And truly be­ <lb/>

            the other gods will see it amongst the states and countries, that <lb/>

            to travelling into other countries and places, and the reception <lb/>
            of foreigners. In the first place, let it not be lawful for a person <lb/>
            less than forty years of age to go abroad at any time, or in any <lb/>

            be called a going abroad, nor to be a part of such political <lb/>
            doings. It is likewise requisite to send persons to the Py­ <lb/>

            ous, and such as are the most beautiful and the best in their <lb/>
            power, who may cause the state to appear of fair repute in <lb/>
            holy and peaceful meetings, by exhibiting its apparatus for <lb/>
            renown as the counter-part of what is requisite for war. And <lb/>
            when they return home, they will teach the young, that the <lb/>
            legal institutions of the rest of mankind relating to political <lb/>
            affairs, are second to their own. 1 But on other grounds it is <lb/>
            (not) meet to send out holy inspectors; but some such as <lb/>
            these, after obtaining permission of the guardians of the laws, 1 <lb/>
            should any of the citizens be desirous to look at the affairs of <lb/>
            the rest of mankind, let no law restrain. For a state, while <lb/>
            unacquainted with good and wicked men, cannot by being un­ <lb/>
            sociable be sufficiently mild and perfect. 2Nor again, can it <lb/>
            preserve its laws without taking them into consideration, but <lb/>
            not only by morals.2 For amongst the multitude there are <lb/>
            always some, not many, godlike men, every way worthy of <lb/>
            being associated with, and who are produced in no respect the <lb/>
            more in well-governed states than in those that are not so; in <lb/>
            whose footsteps it is ever meet for him, who dwells in well- <lb/>
            regulated states, to proceed, when on going out by sea or by <lb/>
            land, he is seeking the party, who may be uncorrupted, so as to <lb/>
            make some of the legal institutions, that have been laid down <lb/>
            correctly, more firm, and to correct others, where there is any <lb/>
            deficiency. For without such an inspection and search, a state <lb/>
            will never continue perfect; 3 not even if they inspect it badly.3 <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The words between the numerals are omitted by Ficinus, and <lb/>

            when he is more than sixty years of age, let him no longer be <lb/>
            an inspector. And having made an inspection for as many years <lb/>
            of the ten as he likes, let him return home and go to the as­ <lb/>
            sembly of those who inspect the laws. And let this (assembly) <lb/>
            be composed of old persons and young; and let it be held of <lb/>
            necessity every day, from day-break until the sun rises; and <lb/>
            let it be composed first of those priests, who have received the <lb/>
            prizes for good conduct; next, ten of the guardians of the <lb/>

            who have been released from the office. And let each of <lb/>
            these go not alone, but with a young man from thirty to forty <lb/>
            years of age, having taken as an ally the person agreeable to <lb/>
            himself; and let there be a conference amongst them, and a <lb/>
            conversation upon the laws of their own state, and on such <lb/>

            of mankind, go immediately on his arrival; and if he has dis­ <lb/>

            and when dead, let all the power of the parties in the assem­ <lb/>

            have returned corrupted, although he pretends to be wise, let <lb/>
            him associate with no one, either young or old. And if he is <lb/>
            obedient to the magistrates, let him live in private; but if not, <lb/>
            let him be put to death, 1 at least if he be convicted in a court <lb/>
            of justice of being a busy-body on the subject of education and <lb/>
            the laws.' But if none of the rulers bring him before a court <lb/>
            of justice, when he deserves it, let a reproach be laid up against <lb/>
            the rulers at the time of their undergoing a trial for the rewards <lb/>
            for good conduct. Let him then, who goes abroad, go abroad <lb/>
            in this manner, and being such a person. But after him it is <lb/>
            meet to receive kindly the person, who comes from abroad. <lb/>
            Now there are four kinds of foreigners of whom we ought to <lb/>
            make mention. The first is he, who comes ever in the sum­ <lb/>
            mer, and continues for the most part in his visits like birds <lb/>
            of passage; and of these the majority flying, as it were, cle­ <lb/>
            verly2 over the sea in the spring of the year,3 wend their way <lb/>
            to other cities, for the sake of making money as merchants; <lb/>
            which persons it is meet for the magistrates, appointed for <lb/>
            such purposes, to receive in the market-places, and ports, and <lb/>
            public buildings outside the city, at the city;4 taking care that <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The words between the numerals are omitted by Taylor, although <lb/>

            none of such foreigners make any innovation; and distributing <lb/>
            correctly to them the claims of justice, and having an inter­ <lb/>
            course with them for what is necessary, but as little as possible. <lb/>
            The second kind is he, who is in reality an inspector with his <lb/>
            eyes, and receives1 with his ears such sights, as are presented <lb/>
            by the Muses. For every such person it is meet that lodgings <lb/>
            should be fitted up near the temples by the kindness of people <lb/>
            towards strangers ; and it is meet for the priests and the sweep­ <lb/>
            ers of the temples to take care that, after they have staid a mo­ <lb/>
            derate time, and have seen and heard (all), for the sake of which <lb/>
            they came, they take their departure, uninjured by doing or suf­ <lb/>
            fering any thing; and let the priests be their judges, should any <lb/>
            one of them do an injury to any one, or any one else3 do an in­ <lb/>
            jury to any one of them, to within fifty drachms. But if there <lb/>
            be a greater charge laid against them, it is requisite that the <lb/>
            trial in such cases be before the Market-Stewards. The third <lb/>
            kind of foreigner it is meet to receive in a public manner, <lb/>
            when he arrives from another country on some public busi­ <lb/>
            ness. Him let the Generals, and the Hipparchs, and the <lb/>
            Taxiarchs alone receive ; and let the care of such person <lb/>
            rest with that one of the Prytanes, with whom alone any <lb/>
            person, received as a stranger, takes up his abode. The <lb/>
            fourth, should he come at any time, is a rarity; but if he <lb/>
            should come, the counterpart of the Inspectors from US,4 <lb/>
            let him, first, be not less than fifty years of age; besides this, <lb/>
            let him think it right to see something beautiful, and superior <lb/>
            in its beauty to the things in other cities, 5or to show something <lb/>
            of the same kind to another city.5 Let then every such person <lb/>
            come unbidden to the doors of the wealthy and wise, as being <lb/>
            himself another of such a kind.6 And let him go to the house <lb/>
            of the party, who is the guardian of the whole of education, trust­ <note type="footnote"> emus renders, "in ipsis suburbiis." But such could scarcely be the <lb/>
            meaning here. Plato wrote, I suspect, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τη̃ ἐμπολῃ̃</foreign>, " for the purpose <lb/>

            gained a victory for virtue, will be sufficient for a stranger1 <lb/>
            of such a kind; and after being with some of these, and teach­ <lb/>
            ing in part, and learning in part,2 let him go away honoured, <lb/>
            as a friend should be by friends, with gifts and becoming <lb/>
            honours. According to these laws it is meet to receive all <lb/>
            strangers, both male and female, from another country, and to <lb/>
            send out our own people, doing honour to Zeus, who presides <lb/>

            guarantee is for a sum under a thousand drachms ; but, if <lb/>

            of a person, who sells any thing not justly, or is not trust­ <lb/>
            worthy, be a guarantee;4 and let the broker, like the seller, <lb/>
            be amenable to a lawsuit.</p>
          <p>If a person wishes to search for his property in the pos­ <lb/>

            property), search for it, either naked, or wearing a small cloak <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξἐνος τῳ̃ τοιούτῳ ξενω̃νι τὴν</foreign>—where Ast, unable to <lb/>

            drama, the argument of which was similar to the Helena and Iphigenia <lb/>

            that " to expel foreigners from banquets and sacrifices is to prohibit them <lb/>
            the use of such things." But the dative <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρώμασι</foreign> could not be thus taken <lb/>

            house, and the portions sealed up or unsealed. But if any <lb/>
            one does not allow the search to the party desiring it, let the <lb/>
            party, who is prevented, bring an action, after setting a value <lb/>
            upon the property sought; 2 and, if the person is convicted, <lb/>
            let him pay for twice the loss of the property valued. If <lb/>
            the master of the house happens to be abroad, let those that <lb/>
            inhabit it permit the search of such portions as are unsealed, <lb/>
            and let the searcher place his own seal by those already sealed, <lb/>
            and appoint any person he pleases as a guard for five days. <lb/>
            But if the master is absent for a longer time, let the other <lb/>

            this preservation be, and after what fashion for our polity and <lb/>
            laws ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Have we not said that an assembly ought to be <lb/>
            held in our city of this kind-That ten of the oldest guar­ <lb/>
            dians of the laws and those, who have received the prizes for <lb/>
            good conduct, ought ever to be gathered together at the <lb/>
            same spot [with them] ?1 and further, that those, who had <lb/>
            gone abroad2 to make a search, if perchance it has happened <lb/>
            to them to hear of any thing opportune for guarding the laws, <lb/>
            (ought),3 on arriving safe at home, to be voted, 4 after having <lb/>
            been tested by these very doings, worthy to become par­ <lb/>
            takers of the assembly?4 and in addition to this, that each <lb/>
            ought to take as an ally one of the young men, not less than <lb/>
            thirty years of age, 5 and that he himself, after deciding that <lb/>
            the young man was a worthy character both by nature and <lb/>
            nurture, should introduce him to the others ; and, if it should <lb/>
            seem good to the others, that he should take him as an ally; <lb/>
            but if not, that the judgment, which may have taken place, <lb/>
            should be kept secret from the rest, and especially the party <lb/>
            rejected;5 and that the assembly ought to be at day-break, <lb/>
            when there is leisure for the most part to every one from all <lb/>
            other business, both public and private ? Something of this <lb/>
            kind was stated by us in the preceding discourse.</p>
          <p>CUn. It was.</p>
          <p>Athen. Resuming then the subject relating to this very as- <note type="footnote"> 1 This <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτοις</foreign> at the end of the paragraph seems perfectly useless. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ficinus adds here " multas urbes—” Taylor, " many regions—” </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Although Ast saw that <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> had no meaning here, yet he did not see <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. XII. c. 10. </note> <lb/>
            sembly, I would say something of this kind. I assert then that <lb/>
            if any one throws out this, as an anchor1 for the whole city, <lb/>
            that it has in itself every thing requisite to preserve all we <lb/>
            wish.</p>
          <p>Clin. How so ?</p>
          <p>Athen. 2 On what comes after this an opportunity will occur <lb/>
            for our speaking correctly, and to omit nothing of our readi­ <lb/>
            ness (to act).2</p>
          <p>CUn. You speak exceedingly well; and do as you intend.</p>
          <p>Athen. It is meet therefore, Clinias, to understand that <lb/>
            with respect to every thing there is a saviour suited to each <lb/>
            kind of work; as in an animal, the soul and the head are na­ <lb/>
            turally the greatest.</p>
          <p>Clin. How again say you ?</p>
          <p>Athen. The power of these two, doubtless, affords safety to <lb/>
            the whole animal.</p>
          <p>Clin. How?</p>
          <p>Athen. In soul there is, besides other things, intellect im­ <lb/>
            planted ; and in the head, besides other things, sight and <lb/>
            hearing. And, in short, intellect being mingled with the most <lb/>
            beautiful senses, and becoming one, it would justly be called <lb/>
            the preservation of each.</p>
          <p>Clin. It appears so at least.</p>
          <p>A then. So indeed it appears. But would not intellect, when <lb/>
            conversant about something, and mingled with the senses, be­ <lb/>
            come the safety of vessels, both in storms and fair weather ? Do <lb/>
            not, in the case of a ship, the pilot and the sailors, by ming­ <lb/>
            ling their senses with the intellect of the pilot, preserve both <lb/>
            themselves and what relates to the ship ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But there is no need of many examples relating to <lb/>
            things of this kind ; but let us consider, as in the case of armies, <lb/>
            and (diseases),3 after laying down what mark would both <lb/>
            generals and all the ministering of physicians direct their <lb/>
            aim (for the sake) of preservation. <note type="footnote"> 1 On this metaphor Ast refers to Wyttenbach Plutarch, S. N. V. p. <lb/>

          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. But if the physician is ignorant of that relating to <lb/>
            the body, which we now call health, or the general of that re­ <lb/>
            lating to victory, or of the other things we have mentioned, <lb/>
            would either appear to possess intellect relating to any of <lb/>
            these matters ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How could they ?</p>
          <p>A then. But what with respect to a city ? If any one is ig­ <lb/>
            norant of the mark, at which a statesman ought to look, could <lb/>
            he in the first place be justly denominated a ruler? And in <lb/>
            the next, would he be able to preserve that, of the scope of <lb/>
            which he knows nothing at all ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How could he ?</p>
          <p>[11.] Athen. It is necessary therefore now, as it seems, if <lb/>
            the settlement of this our country is to have an end, that there <lb/>
            should be something in it, that knows, in the first place, what <lb/>
            we call the mark, 3 whatever that may happen to be in a states­ <lb/>
            man's view ;3 next, after what manner it is requisite to partake <lb/>
            of it; and which of the laws first, and, afterwards, who among <lb/>
            men, will properly or improperly consult with a view to it. But <lb/>
            if there shall be any state devoid of a thing of this kind, it <lb/>
            will not be wonderful, if, by being mindless and senseless, it <lb/>
            should on each occasion perform in each of its doings what­ <lb/>
            ever presents itself by chance.</p>
          <p>Clin. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now then, in what part of our state, or pursuits, is <lb/>
            there any sufficient guard whatever prepared of such a kind ? <lb/>
            Have it we in our power to tell ?</p>
          <p>Clin. Not I indeed, guest, clearly. But, if I must make a <lb/>
            guess, this discourse seems to me to tend to that assembly, <lb/>
            which you said ought to come together at night.</p>
          <p>Athen. You have rightly understood me, Clinias; and, as <note type="footnote"> 1__1 This answer of Clinias seems very strange. Unless I am mistaken, <lb/>

            the present reasoning indicates, this (assembly) ought to pos­ <lb/>
            sess every virtue; the beginning of which is not to be wander­ <lb/>
            ing, by guessing at many things, but by looking to one thing, <lb/>
            always to direct every thought, like arrows, to this.</p>
          <p>CUn. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. Now then we shall learn that it is not a wonderful <lb/>
            thing for the legal institutions of cities to wander; because the <lb/>
            system of laws in each city looks, one to one thing, and another <lb/>
            to another. And for 1 the most part it is no wonder that1 to <lb/>
            some the limit is that of what is just, in order that certain <lb/>
            persons, whether they happen to be better or worse, may have <lb/>
            dominion over the state ; to others, that they may be wealthy, <lb/>

            but others are regulated by laws, 2 like two united,2 looking to <lb/>
            both, that they may be free (themselves),3 and the lords of <lb/>
            other states. But the wisest, as they think themselves, (look) <lb/>
            to these, and to all such points as these together, and not to <lb/>
            any one (singly),4 as they are unable to mention any one thing <lb/>
            held in pre-eminent honour, to which it is needful for them <lb/>
            to direct5 the rest.</p>
          <p>Clin. Would not then, 0 guest, our assertion formerly <lb/>
            laid down be right; for we said that the whole of our laws <lb/>
            ought always to look to one point; and we conceded that <lb/>
            this might be called very correctly virtue.</p>
          <p>Athen. Yes.</p>
          <p>Clin: And we laid down surely that virtue is fourfold.</p>
          <p>Athen. Entirely so.</p>

            examining the intellect of the statesman, we are at that point <lb/>
            now; and interrogating it, as if it were a person, we will say- <lb/>
            0 wonderful creature, to what point are you looking ? What is <lb/>
            that one thing, of which the intellect of the physician can speak <lb/>
            in a clear manner? but of which you, who are forsooth 2 superior, <lb/>
            as you would say, to all clever persons, will not have it in your <lb/>
            power to speak ? Or can you, Megillus and Clinias, define <lb/>
            and speak for him, and tell me what it is, as I have defined to <lb/>
            you in behalf of many other matters ?</p>

          <p>Clin. 4 In what, for example, do you mean ? 4</p>
          <p>Athen. For example, when we said that there are four spe­ <lb/>
            cies of virtue, it is evidently necessary to say that each is one, <lb/>
            since they are four.</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. And yet we call all these one. For we say that <lb/>
            fortitude is a virtue, and that prudence is a virtue, and the <lb/>
            two others (likewise), as if this virtue was not in reality many <lb/>
            things, but only one.</p>
          <p>CUn. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Athen. So far, then, as these two differ from each other, and <lb/>
            have received two names, and the other two (likewise), there <lb/>
            is no difficulty in speaking of them; but so far as we apply <lb/>

            the habits of children very young. For the soul may be brave <lb/>

          <p>Athen. But what, with respect to all serious pursuits, is there <lb/>
            the same reasoning, that it behoves those, who are to be really <lb/>
            guardians of the laws, to know really the matters relating to <lb/>
            the truth, and to be competent to interpret them in a dis­ <lb/>
            course, and follow them out in deeds, deciding upon the things <lb/>
            that exist beautifully according to nature, or do not exist ?</p>
          <p>Clin. How not ?</p>
          <p>Athen. Is not then one of the most beautiful things that <lb/>
            relating to the gods, which we went through with seriousness, <lb/>
            how that they exist, and of how great a power they seem to be <lb/>
            the lords; and that man, as far as he can, ought to know this ; <lb/>
            and, that we ought to pardon the greatest number of those in <lb/>
            the state, if they will only follow the voice of the laws; but that <lb/>
            we ought not to commit to persons a share in the guardianship, <lb/>
            who have not laboured to acquire every faith in the existence 3 <lb/>
            of the gods ; and that there should be 4 this one object of <lb/>
            care,4 namely, never to choose any one for a guardian of the <lb/>
            laws, who is not a divine man, and has not laboured for <lb/>
            them,5 nor (permit him)6 to become one of those selected for <lb/>

            of the soul, (by not knowing)4 that it is older than body; but con­ <lb/>

          <p>CUn. How could this be ?</p>
          <p>[14.] Athen. It is not possible for any mortal man ever to <lb/>
            become firmly pious, who does not receive these two things, that <lb/>
            the soul is the oldest of all things, which share in generation <lb/>
            and is immortal; and that it rules over all bodies. And in <lb/>
            addition to this, what has been said very often, who shall re­ <lb/>
            ceive 2 the mind said of beings in the stars,2 and the necessary <lb/>
            learning before 3 these subjects, 4and after beholding the coin­ <lb/>

            admit of a reason, 5 and do not.5 Now he, who is not able to <lb/>
            acquire these in addition to public virtues, will scarcely ever <lb/>

            thing of this kind at least. For I will readily be your helper <lb/>
            in this ; and in addition to myself perhaps, through my skill in <lb/>
            things of this kind, and my thinking upon them very fre­ <lb/>

          <p>Clin. Let us, 0 guest, proceed in this path, rather than any <lb/>
            other, in which even a god is almost leading us. But what <lb/>
            is the method, which, if it took place, would take place cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, this let us now speak of and seek out.</p>
          <p>Athen. Laws about things of this kind, Megillus and Cli­ <lb/>
            nias, it is not possible to lay down, until (the whole state)3 is <lb/>
            orderly arranged ; 4 for then (one can) lay down, over what it is <lb/>
            meet for them to have an authority.4 5But the furnishing <lb/>
            such things at present would be, if it were done correctly, an <lb/>
            act of instruction combined with much intercourse.5</p>
          <p>Clin. How so ? Why do we say that this is mentioned <lb/>
            again ?</p>
          <p>Athen. In the first place, a list should be drawn out <lb/>
            of those, who would be fitted for the nature of a guard by the <lb/>
            power of their time of life, and instruction, and by their <lb/>
            morals and manners. But after this, it is neither easy to find <lb/>
            (oneself),6 what one ought to learn, nor to become the disciple <note type="footnote"> 1—1 In lieu of this unmeaning verbiage Ficinus has merely " prædictis <lb/>

            of another, who has found it out. In addition to this, it is a vain <lb/>
            thing to state in writing the times 1 which and1 in which it <lb/>
            is requisite to obtain each particular. For not even to the <lb/>
            learners themselves would it be manifest, what is learnt oppor­ <lb/>
            tunely, before the science of the instruction is generated in the <lb/>
            soul of each. Hence, all, that relates to these matters, being <lb/>
            spoken of, would not be said to be properly secrets ; 2 but they <lb/>
            (might be said to be) not previously spoken, through nothing <lb/>
            of what has been spoken indicating what has been previously <lb/>
            spoken.2</p>
          <p>Clin. Since then this is the case, what, 0 guest, must we do ?</p>
          <p>Athen. According to the proverb, friends, it appears 3 we are <lb/>
            lying in a common and middle ground.3 And if we are willing <lb/>
            to run a risk respecting the whole polity, we must do all <lb/>
            things, by throwing, as they say, either thrice six, or thrice <lb/>
            ace.4 I will, however, undergo the danger with you in <lb/>
