OF all the works published in our collection,1 that of Ordericus Vitalis is the most extensive, a sure proof of the claims it pos­ sesses to more than ordinary attention.
The annals of that age are generally characterised by the brevity of their details, and the dryness of their style.
It would seem that the genius of the author was so dull and barren that it satisfied itself with simply accepting the facts presented to his notice, without being alive to any necessity of accounting for them, of connecting them with other circumstances, or of adding the reflections required to give them further consistency than the mere order of dates.
In those times of darkness and isolation, the life of man was so confined, and his views so circumscribed, that even curiosity seemed to have lost its influence, and an elevated position, or a stirring career, supplied the only situations in which the intellectual horizon was extended, and an earnest desire for information excited ;
but those who found themselves by birth or accident in such unusual circumstances devoted all their time and efforts to action, and were too much occupied in playing their part in the history of the times to give themselves any trouble about writing it.
Among the men of rank who flourished in the age of which we are collecting memorials, two bishops, Gregory of Tours, and William of Tyre, are the only persons who found leisure to bequeath to posterity any lengthened account of events, the character of which their situation led them to penetrate;
their histories there­ fore, the most extensive we have yet published, are also, regard being had to the difference of the times, the most interesting, the most useful, and the most rich in valuable details.
Ordericus Vitalis exhibits, if not in the same degree, at least the same kind of superiority over the writers of his own age;
which is the more remarkable in his case, because no external circumstances, no advantages of position, contributed to rouse or sustain the activity of his mind.
A simple monk, buried in the depths of the most secluded forests of Normandy, his own genius, his instinctive ardour for acquiring information, the patience with which he pursued his researches, supplied the incentives and the opportu­ nities for collecting materials for his vast undertaking.
Ordericus was born in England on the fifteenth of February, 1075, at Attingham,1 on the banks of the Severn, the residence of his father Odelirius, a native of Orleans, who, at the time of the Norman conquest, was a follower of Roger de Montgomery, after­ wards created Earl of Shrewsbury, to whose household he continued to be attached in the character of one of his council.
Ordericus received the name of his godfather, a Saxon priest and curate of the parish, who both baptized him and undertook the office of sponsor.
At the age of five years, Ordericus was sent to school at Shrewsbury, where he learnt reading, grammar, and the chants used in the church, under a master whose name was Siegward.
2
It would appear that his own father was a man of some learning, a clerk, and a priest, for at that time, particularly in England, priests were not absolutely forbidden to marry.
But a more perfect state of life was known, and Odelirius, who was now become a widower, thought it his duty not only to renounce himself all worldly attachments, but to withdraw from them his eldest son Ordericus, then ten years old.
He therefore devoted him as well as himself to the religious life, and retired to a monastery in Great Britain.
3
Shortly afterwards, however, his mind became disturbed by the obstacles which family ties were calculated to offer to his salvation, and he thought that neither his own nor his son's would be secure if they remained in the same monastery.
In order, therefore, to render their separation more entire and more irrevocable,1 he made him cross the sea, sending him to Normandy under the care of a monk named Ragnold, where Ordericus, making an endowment of thirty silver marks, entered the abbey of Ouche, belonging to the rule of St. Benedict, and founded by St. Evroult, an Orleanais saint, for whom Odelirius, as his countryman, felt especial veneration.
This abbey, which at a later period took its founder's name, stood in that part of the diocese of Lisieux which is now included in the department of the Orne.
Buried in the bosom of forests, enriched since the eleventh century with a considerable library, and in­ habited by monks who were the friends of learning, the abbey of Ouche was a retreat well calculated to foster the studious turn of mind which, it is said, was already remarked in the young novice.
John, the sub-prior of the abbey, had the charge of his education, and formed a strong attachment for him ;
he also gained the good­ will of the rest of the monks, and among others that of Mainier, then abbot of St. Evroult.
Ordericus entered the monastery in the year 1085.
The year following, on the 22nd of September, the feast of St. Maurice, he received the tonsure, changing at the same time his English name of Ordericus for that of Vitalis, one of the companions of the saint whose memory was that day observed.
On the 15th of March, 1091, Gilbert Maminot, bishop of Lisieux, admitted him to the order of sub-deacon at the request of Serlo d'Orgères, the then abbot of St. Evroult;
and two years afterwards, on the 26th of March, 1093, Serlo himself, having then become bishop of Lisieux, ordained him deacon.
Ordericus was then eighteen years of age.
All the records of those ancient times concur in informing us with what holy fear truly pious men then regarded the duties of the priesthood, how they shrunk from undertaking them, and often only consented to accept the office upon the express command of their superiors.
It was not till fifteen years afterwards, the 21st of December, 1107, that William Bonne-Ame, archbishop of Rouen laid on Ordericus, as he tells us himself, "the burden of the priesthood.”
1Such are the simple facts which the writings of this excellent monk supply concerning his own life.
Taking no part in worldly affairs, and equally a stranger to the high places of his own pro­ fession, we find him never quitting his retirement but, on one occasion, to attend a general chapter of the order of St. Benedict convoked by the abbot of Cluni, and for two journeys, one to Worcester,2 the other to Cambray, both, as it would appear, under­ taken for the purpose of procuring information necessary in the prosecution of his literary works.
These formed the sole employ­ ment of his life, and he does not appear to have pushed his labours to extreme old age, for he tells us, at the close of his history, that he had reached his sixty-seventh year, and the thirty-fourth of his ministry in the priesthood, when he felt himself compelled by age and infirmities to bring his work to a close;
and it is scarcely probable that, after a career so occupied, release from labour very long preceded that from life.
We ought then, if I am not mis­ taken, to place the death of Ordericus Vitalis in the year 1141, or at the latest in 1142.
The authors of the Histoire Litteraire de la France have fixed the year 1143 as the period at which his work concluded;
but they are evidently under a mistake, for at the end of his last book Ordericus speaks of Stephen king of England as being at that time in confinement, but that prince, who was made prisoner at the battle of Lincoln on the 20th of February, 1141, was exchanged in the month of November of the same year.
Again, he mentions the death of John, bishop of Lisieux, as having occurred so recently that his successor was not yet appointed;
and the bishop died on the 21st of May, 1141.
Besides which, he reckons eleven years from the election of Pope Innocent II., which took place in the month of February, 1130.
Everything therefore concurs in pointing out the year 1141 as the period at which Ordericus found himself under the necessity of terminating the labours to which his life was consecrated.
His work, devoted in an especial manner to the glory of Nor­ mandy, comprised originally but the seven last books, in which Norman history, in point of fact, holds the first place.
At a later period he added four books, the present third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, to enable himself to give fuller particulars of some events, as well as to connect the glory of Normandy with that of the abbey of Ouche,on the foundation and progress of which the new books enter into minute details.
Furthermore, having a due regard to his own character, and ambitious of the honour of bequeathing to posterity a complete universal history, from the birth of Jesus Christ to his own day, he composed the first and second books, containing long extracts from the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, and legends which give an account of the establishment of Christianity in Asia and Africa, as well as in Europe, concluding the whole with short chronicles, or rather tables of the emperors and popes.
Then, at last, Ordericus con­ sidered his work complete, and gave it the title of an Ecclesiastical History, a title which singularly exhibits, as we have elsewhere observed, how far the church had then become the centre of society.
It is plain enough that the way in which his work was put together has contributed in no small degree to the confusion which reigns throughout the writings of the monk of St. Evroult:
his whole object having been to make collections from all quarters of facts, traditions, adventures, acts, and letters, his work repeatedly changed its form and its object while under his hands, and he gave himself but little trouble, except to find a place in it, no matter in what order, for all the stores of information he had gathered.
Accordingly, on more than one occasion his materials seem thrown together pell-mell, as chance or opportunity brought them into the author's power ;
sometimes he interrupts the course of his narrative by dividing the account of a particular event into distinct portions, separated by long intervals;
and, at others, he repeats the same story in different parts of his work ;
so that the reader is continually surprised by the strange manner in which times, and places, and subjects, the most distant and the most incongruous, are brought together.
No sort of art or method appears to have been used in combining this prodigious mass of facts, and when the work is considered as a whole, from a single point of view, one cannot fail, on a first impression, of being most sensible of this striking confusion.
But this irregular surface covers a mine of real wealth.
No book contains so much and such valu­ able information on the history of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, on the political state, both civil and religious, of society in the west of Europe, and on the manners of the times, whether feudal, monastic, or popular.
In his genuine honesty and native frankness, Ordericus makes no attempt to argue anything, to conceal anything:
he tells his story, and gives his opinion;
he blames or approves, without any other idea but that of publishing what he knows and what he thinks.
Simple, credulous, and having no pretensions to be considered a sagacious observer, or a critic, still he was independent and sincere-rare merits among the monkish chroniclers of his own age, who, besides, are quite as deficient as himself in those qualities wherein he failed.
The History of Ordericus has not hitherto been translated;
the version which we now present to the public is the work of M. Louis du Bois, of Lisieux, a man of letters, whose modesty is equal to his diligence, and who, having devoted himself to all that is interesting in connection with Normandy, his native country, is already well known by some useful works on the antiquities and statistics of that fine province.
The principal difficulties which lie in the way of the readers of Ordericus Vitalis arise from the vast variety of minute circumstances, of distant allusions, and of geographical references, connected with Normandy.
It was, therefore, of importance that the translation should be made on the very spot, among the recollections to which it would give rise, and by a person capable of explaining the local obscurities, so to speak, of the text, in short but frequent notes.
M. Du Bois, having kindly undertaken this minute task, will best be able to give an account of his pro­ ceedings, and we therefore propose to close this notice by sub­ joining an exact copy of the report with which he has favoured us, respecting the manuscripts of the historians of St. Evroult, the labours of which they were the object, and the researches to which he has devoted himself.'"
In the earliest manuscripts of Ordericus Vitalis.
his work takes the title of Orderici Vitalis Angli Monachi Uticensis Historia Ecclesiastica.
It is thus entitled in a manuscript which came from the abbey of St. Evroult itself, and, as we are inclined to believe, in the authors own hand-writing, of which we shall pre­ sently speak more in detail.
Duchesne was unaware of the exis­ ence of this autograph, and printed his edition from more recent manuscripts, under the title of Orderici Vitalis Angligence Coenobii Uticensis Monachi, libri xiii.
"The autograph manuscript of the abbey of St. Evroult served in former times for the original of the different copies which were dispersed of this important history."
In the beginning of the sixteenth centuary, a monk of St. Evroult (probably Vallin), made a copy of this manuscript, which was then composed of four volumes, and in a perfect state.
The copy formed also four volumes, in a handwriting which, though not very close, was almost illegible.
According to Charles du Jardin, prior of the abbey of St. Evroult in 1717, the two first volumes of this copy were then at the abbey of St. Ouen, at Rouen, and the two others at that of Glanfeuil-sur-Loire.
I have reason to think that the prior Du Jardin was mistaken ;
the two volumes now in the library at Rouen, which were brought from St. Ouen, are the two last of the work, containing the seven last books."
The royal library possesses the following MSS. of Ordericus:
No. 5122, MS. de Bigot;
the one which Duchesne used.
No. 5123, MS. de Colbert, two volumes.
No. 5124, MS. de Baluz, two volumes, containing only the five first books.[These MSS.
are in folio, written on paper, and all of the six­ teenth century.]
No. 5506, MS. de Colbert, as No. 5123. 2 volumes on vellum, containing only the six first books."
There is also in the same library, No. 4861, a MS.
on vellum in folio, mixed with others which came from Bigot, and containing a fragment entitled:
Fragmentum ex Orderici Vitalis histori libro tertio de novis monachorum Cistercentium, et aliorum illius sœculi institutis.
This copy is the more curious because it is of the thirteenth century.
“Independently of these different copies, which are more or less faulty, and even incomplete, there is in the library of St. Germain-des-Pres, a copy of the three first books, bequeathed to it by Coaslin de Cambout, and made in the sixteenth century, at the time when the autograph was still perfect, by Vallin, a monk- of St Evroult, who dedicated it to his abbot Felix de Brie.
The most valuable manuscript of Ordericus Vitalis was pre­ served in the abbey in which he wrote his history.
We have now indeed only the fragments of this autograph, but even the frag­ ments are precious.
I had the pleasure of saving them from imminent danger of destruction at L'Aigle in 1799.
just after I was nominated by the assembly librarian of the central school of the Orme, and I hastened to deposit them in the establishment com­ mitted to my care.
The manuscript forms a quarto volume, written on parchment, which the monks of St. Evroult, in their negligence, during the seventeenth century, took no care to have fresh bound until they had suffered great part to decay and be lost.
We know that it was perfect at the commencement of the preceding century, because a copy of it was then made, which, though unfortunately marked by blanks and omissions, is still of great value.
What remains of this autograph is as follows :
book vii., four leaves ;
books ix., x., xi., xii., and xiii., are complete, except the four or five last leaves.
"I feel certain that this valuable manuscript is really an autogragh, as the monks of St. Evoult believed it to be from the cir­ cumstance of its having been inserted in a catalogue taken shortly after the death of Ordericus Vitalis.
Among many reasons that might be offered in justification of this opinion, I shall confine myself to these :
the manuscript is not illustrated ;
it is written on common parchment, in small sheets;
it is in general very clear, but there are places in which it has been corrected;
and since the twelfth century, that is a few years only after the death of the author, it passed for having been written with his own hand a short time before.
I insist the more on these points, because at the period when this manuscript saw the light the abbey possessed very skilful copyists who have left magnificent copies of some of the Fathers of the church, and several other works, all tran­ scribed with great beauty on the finest vellum, and in a folio shape.
Assuredly therefore, if they had made a transcript of Ordericus, it would have had all the embellishments which the historian of their own community of St. Evroult, and the achievements of the Normans, so justly merited."
M. La Croix du Maine is the first of our bibliographers who called attention to Ordericus Vitalis.
He remarks, with justice, that good manuscripts of this historian have been always scarce ;
that even John Bale does not mention him in his list of English authors, nor do other compilers of biography and literary history.
It appears from what La Croix du Maine says further, that he had in his possession a fine manuscript of Ordericus, which he intended to publish ;
but this intention was never carried into effect."
It was not till the year 1619 that the learned Andrew Du­ chesne published his Ordericus Vitalis in the collection to which he gave the title of, Histories Normannorum scriptores antiqui.
The thirteen books of the Ecclesiastical History are the most impor­ tant work contained in this valuable collection, now become scarce and dear :
they fill 606 pages of the volume.
Duchesne printed his edition from the manuscript of J. Bigot:
unfortunately he omitted to collate it with the other manuscripts to which he might have had access, and more especially with the autograph in the library of St. Evroult.
He even increased the confusion by taking no pains with the marginal dates he affixed, so that events quite different in point of time and character are often marked with the same date."
These deficiencies, which were generally acknowledged, in­ duced Bessin, the Benedictine, to whom we are indebted for the Concilia Rotomagensis Provincial, fol.
1717, to undertake a new and better edition of Duchesne's Ordericus.
With this view, he had made a great number of corrections on a copy of the edition of 1619 by collating it with a manuscript then the property of M. Mareste, advocate-general to the chamber of accounts of Nor­ mandy.
He had besides, in 1722, the valuable assistance of Charles du Jardin, prior of the abbey of St. Evroult, who had made great proficiency in calligraphical studies.
All was ready for the press, and the bookseller, Behourt, was on the point of undertaking the work, when the death of Bessin, which happened in 1726, put an end to this useful publication, and the project was no further thought of.
I have had the advantage of the labours of Bessin and Du Jardin, and the volume they prepared for publication has been of essential service;
but still I found that even after the care it had received from these learned and indefatigable Benedictins, there was much to reap, and I trust I have been able to do so with some profit.“
The learned and judicious authors of that great work, the Col­ lection of the Historians of France, did not omit including in it so important a writer as Ordericus;
they have accomplished this successfully by dividing their extracts in the following manner:
- Extracts from books i., iii., v., vi., and vii., in tome ix., pp. 10 to 18;
from books i., iii. vii., in tome x., in pp. 234 to 236 ;
from books i., iii., iv., v., vi., and vii., in tome xi., pp. 221 to 248 ;
and from books i. and iv. to xiii., in tome xii, pp. 285 to 770.
“Dom Bouquet made the first of these extracts;
those contained in tome xii., which are the longest and the most interesting, are the work of M. Briae, who has not incurred the censures justly applied to his predecessor."
After these learned labours, there still remained some useful objects to be obtained."
As I have before remarked, I did not fail to take advantage of what had been accomplished by Bessin and Du Jardin ;
but besides this, I have made use of some new observations procured from St. Evroult, have made a collation of the different manu­ scripts with extreme care, which I have since repeated at Rouen, with the assistance of two accomplished Normans, whose learning is only equalled by their obliging disposition, M. Auguste Le Prevost,who is in possession of very valuable collections, relating to the history of Normandy, and M. Theodore Liquet, who has been kind enough to communicate to me the manuscript of the library at Rouen, of which he is the keeper.“
Some important corrections and numerous additions have been the fruits of these labours.
Besides, a long study of the antiquities, the history, and the geography of Normandy has placed at my disposal a vast mass of information, which I trust will throw some light on our author's statements.
The number of explanatory notes appended at the bottom of the pages form the best proof of the pains I have for twenty years bestowed on this undertaking.
Still, however, I dare not flatter myself that I have cleared up all the obscurities, filled up all the gaps, and ascertained exactly all the names of places and proper names.
The difficulties have been enormous;
but I have used all the means in my power to overcome them."
However this may be, it may be asserted with truth that, of all our ancient provinces, there is none in comparison with Nor­ mandy, which has been the scene of such celebrated events, and given birth to such distinguished men, none which can boast so many and such excellent historians;
and that of all these his­ torians, Ordericus Vitalis is the most important, while, though continually quoted, his work has never been translated, nor even correctly published."
FORMER writers, from early times, carefully remarking the occurrences of the passing age, have noted the good or evil which befell mankind for a warning to others ;
and while thus continually aiming to benefit posterity, they" heaped volume upon volume.
We see, for instance, that this was done by Moses, Daniel, and the other sacred writers;
and we discover the same object in the works of Dares of Phrygia,1 Pompeius Trogus,2 and other gentile historians;
of Eusebius,3 Orosius, who wrote the History of the World ;
1 of Bedo the Englishman, Paul of Monte Cassino,2 and the rest of the ecclesiastical writers.
I peruse their accounts with delight, I praise and admire the elegance and usefulness of their works, and recommend the learned of our age to imitate their invaluable remains.
But, without presuming to dictate to others, at least I contend against self-indulgence in enervating sloth, and, rousing myself to exertion, desire to undertake some work which may be acceptable to my immediate superiors.
3
In my account of the restoration of the monastery of St. Evroult,4 written by the command of Abbot Roger, I adhered faith­ fully to the simple truth, choosing to speak frankly of the great men of this perverse age, whether good or bad, and relying solely on lily honesty of purpose, without making any pretensions to a polished style or the gifts of eloquence.
My present object is to treat of what passes under our own observation, or we are called upon to endure.
For it is fitting that as new events continually occur they should be carefully committed to writing, to the praise of God;
and thus, as the history of the past has been handed down to us by preceding writers, so also a relation of what is going on around us should be transmitted to future gene­ rations by the pen of contemporaries.
I propose to treat of ecclesiastical affairs with the modesty becoming a humble son of the church;
and to the best of my ability, diligently treading in the steps of the ancient fathers, I shall search out and give to the world the modern history of Christendom, venturing to call my unpretending work " An Ecclesiastical History.
"Confined to my cloister by the vows which have volun­ tarily bound me to the strict observance of the monastic rule, I am unable to make researches into the affairs of Alexandria, Greece, or Rome, and others worthy to be related;
but I labour, by God's help, to unfold with truth contemporary events for the instruction of posterity,-both such as have passed under my own observation, and those which, occurring in neighbouring countries, have come to my knowledge.
I firmly believe, however, from observation of the past, that some one will arise with far more penetra­ tion than myself, and more capable of examining the course of worldly affairs, who will perhaps extract from my pages, and from those of others of the same class, what he thinks worthy of being inserted in his chronicle or history for the information of posterity.
I derive confidence from having begun my work by the express command of the venerable Abbot Roger,1 when he was advanced in years, and from now submitting it to you, father Guérin,1 his lawful successor according to the order of the church, that its redundancies may be expunged, and its errors rectified, and, being thus corrected, it may be stamped with your judicious authority.
I shall treat first of the Source of all things, itself having no beginning, by whose aid I trust to persevere to the end, which, in truth, is endless, and to sing for ever, with the blessed above, devout praises to Him who is the Alpha and Omega.
THE Almighty Word, by whom God the Father created all things, is the true vine:
and the Lord of the household who planted this vine cultivates the vineyard-that is, holy church-by .
means of the labourers sent into it, from dawn of day to the eleventh hour, that he may gather from it abundant fruit.
He never ceases tending this vine, and propagating its magnificent branches, throughout every region of the world.
He, indeed, the true King of ages, the true High Priest of good things to come, the true Prophet, and the Lord of men and angels, ineffably "anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows," the Angel of the covenant of the Father's unfathomable counsels,-He (according to the oracles of the prophets, who, taught by the Holy Spirit, shone as stars in the darkness of this world, and, like the cock which by his crowing awakes slumbering man before day-break, foretold the mysteries of the Lord's advent) chose for his mother, among many thousand women, Mary, the royal virgin, descended from the house of king David, and wonderfully endowed with the fulness of grace.
This blessed Virgin, thus adorned with distinguished virtues, having been miraculously espoused to that just man, Joseph, saluted by the archangel Gabriel, and overshadowed by the Holy Ghost, conceived without sin, and brought forth without pain, on the eighth of the calends of January (25th of December), the Saviour, who was the desire of all nations.
Thus our Lord Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem, a city of Juda, at the time of the first census, when Cirinus1 was governor of Syria, according to the order of all the pro­ phecies which had announced his coming.
Glorious signs, as the sacred oracles relate, appeared in heaven at the birth of Christ, and the angels with pious thanksgivings for the salvation of man, sang:
" Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!"
2
Thus, in the forty-second year of the reign of Cæsar Augustus, twenty-eight years after the deaths of Cleo­ patra and Anthony, when Egypt became a Roman pro­ vince, in the third year of the 193rd olympiad, and 752 years after the foundation of Rome, that is to say, at the time when Octavianus Cæsar, having restored order among all the nations of the earth, and, by God's providence, established a most firm and secure peace, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, consecrated by his advent the sixth age of the world.
From the creation to the birth of Christ, we reckon 3952 years, according to the correct Hebrew chronology;
after the computation of Isidore, bishop of Seville, and some other doctors, there are 5154 years ;
again, according to the calculation of Eusebius of Cæsarea and Saint Jerome, we find 5231 years between the birth of Adam and the eighteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar, when Christ suffered on the cross.
Let the whole multitude of believers rejoice in the Holy Spirit, unceasingly adoring the eternal Creator, and offering with their whole hearts a sacrifice of praise to Him, who appointed his only Son, co-eternal and consubstantial with himself and the Holy Spirit, to take upon him our flesh and redeem the servant of sin from a well-merited death by the undeserved death of his own Son!
For our merciful Maker, who had fashioned man after his own image and similitude, was grieved at his fall, and decreed, in his secret and unfathomable counsels, that his Son, co-equal with himself, should visit the condemned servant in prison, and lovingly bring back man on his own shoulders from capti­ vity to the flock, and heartily rejoice the nine orders of angels by the re-establishment of their number.
THUS, the Son of God, made man, remained what he was, and took upon him what he was not, without confusion or division of substance;
but ruling all things, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, by his divinity, and enduring all the infirmities of our flesh by the assumption of huma­ nity.
The law which he had given by Moses, he kept inviolate;
and, himself a lawgiver, fulfilled all righteousness.
Thus, on the eighth day, he was circumcised, and on the fortieth, was presented to his Father in the temple, with the legal offering.
1Although the Virgin Mother wrapped her divine Son in swaddling clothes, although tight bandages swathed his feet and hands, although the tender infant, concealed within a narrow manger, uttered the cries of that human misery which it was the will of the Father that he should take upon himself;
yet the High God was manifested by a new star appearing in the heavens, and the eastern Magi, thus guided, sought for him at Bethlehem, found him cradled in a manger, and worshipped him as God.
The wise men then opened their treasures, and presented to Christ three costly presents, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, thus proclaiming him King of kings, true God, and mortal man.
The first fruits of the election of the Gentiles were consecrated in those who hastened to Christ in Bethlehem from Saba, and from other nations scattered through the world.
Being warned by an angel in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed, rejoicing, into their own country another way.
1When the days of her purification were accomplished, the holy Virgin Mother presented herself in the temple, and, offering the child to God his Father, Simeon, that just and devout man, took him up in his arms.
Although bowed with age, he rejoiced in God, because he had now before his eyes the long-expected Saviour of the nations, revealed to him by the Holy Ghost;
he took him in his hands, announced to the people that he was the Master of life and death, and blessed him before the admiring multitude who leaped for joy.
Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, came into the temple at that moment rejoicing;
this widow, endowed with every virtue, knew that Christ was there, and an­ nounced to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusa­ lem, that the Saviour was come.
His parents offered for him the sacrifice of a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons,-a figure of the spotless purity and the gentle simplicity of the church.
2Behold, then, how not only the angels in heaven, but also mortals of every age and of both sexes, gave their testimony to the Lord born,in the flesh.
The Virgin Mary, conceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, brought forth her child, suckled him, and, by his aid, effectually ministered to all his wants.
John, leaping for joy in his mother's womb, saluted the Lord, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Ghost, spoke three times in prophetic language of the Messiah and his mother.
The angels glorified God who had become incarnate for the redemption of man, rejoicing to see us redeemed and added to their number.
The shepherds, instructed by the angelic visitation, hasten to Bethlehem and search in a stable for the living bread which comes down from heaven;
they find Him who rules the heavens, an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes.
The hearts of the shepherds, when they heard from the heralds the tidings of Christ, were filled with joy and wonder.
Zacharias and Simeon, both righteous men, at the end of their earthly career, confess their belief in Christ, and predict his future history;
and the blessed Anna, bending with years, partakes of their love of Christ.
1But, while the righteous were rejoicing with exceeding great joy, the impious Herod, hearing strange rumours, was troubled, and commanded that all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, should be slain.
When, therefore, Joseph had taken Jesus and his immaculate mother into Egypt, the fury of Herod vented itself in the massacre of the infants, and the fields of Bethlehem were watered with the blood of the innocents.
2
But Christ received into his own mansions those who were slain in his stead, where they enjoy everlasting felicity.
OUR Saviour dwelt on the earth thirty-two years and three months, but he was without sin, and spake no guile;
and he alone among the dead was found free from guilt.
At the beginning of his thirtieth year, he went down to the river Jordan, received the sacrament of baptism at the hands of John, and by so doing, sanctified the waters, and set his disciples an example of the most perfect humility.
While Jesus was praying after his baptism, the heavens were opened unto him, and the Holy Ghost was seen to descend upon him in a bodily shape like a dove, and the voice of his Father was heard from heaven:
" This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
3
John indeed deserves the first place among them that are born of women, for Christ placed himself in his hands to be bap- tized, the invisible Spirit showed itself to him in a visible shape, and God the Father proclaimed from heaven his Son to him.
Thus the mystery of the Trinity was manifested to the blessed forerunner in our Saviour's baptism.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the twelfth year of his age, was found in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, not teaching them, but asking them questions.
He was baptized at the age of thirty, and thenceforth proved his divine mission by miracles.
During the space of three years
He performed miracles and taught his disciples.

This triennial period shadows forth the sacrament of our baptism, by means of faith in the Holy Trinity, and the operation of the legal decalogue.
Our divine Lawgiver also teaches men, by his example, that they should not venture to speak in public or preach at too early an age, or eagerly covet preferment;
but be content to wait humbly for the proper and ap­ pointed time for their admission to the priesthood, or the office of teaching.
CHAPTER IV.IT is now my purpose to examine the series of our Lord's miracles recorded in the four gospels, giving a faith­ ful compendium which may serve easily to recall them to the mind.
I shall trace the succession of events as the four evangelists have related them, and, by His help who makes eloquent the tongues of infants, I hope to sum them up in a short account.
As I have determined to give a correct chronography, it is right that I should begin with endeavour­ ing diligently to fix exact dates, as the holy evangelists, and other historians, long ago supplied them in their writings.
Octavianus Cæsar Augustus, nephew of Caius Julius Cæsar by his sister Octavia, succeeded his uncle as the second emperor of Rome, and reigned fifty-six years and six months ;
1 in the forty-second year of whose reign Christ was born.
Tiberius Caesar, the step-son of Augustus, being the son of his wife Livia by a former husband, reigned twenty- three years;
in his eighteenth year Christ redeemed the world by suffering on the cross.
2
After the death of Herod, the son of Antipater of Ascalon, who for twenty-four years usurped the throne of Judea, his son Archelaus exercised his tyrannical authority over the Jews for the space of ten years;
St. Matthew tells us that Joseph, after his return from Egypt in obedience to the commands of the angel, being afraid of Archelaus, turned aside into Galilee with the child and his mother, and dwelt at Nazareth.
But Ar­ chelaus, on account of his intolerable cruelty, being accused by the Jews before Augustus, was deprived of power and banished for life to Vienne, a town of Gaul, where he died.
4
In order to weaken the kingdom of Judea, Augustus divided it into tetrarchates for the brothers of Archelaus.
Moreover, Pilate, in the twelfth year of the reign of Tibe­ rius, was sent into Judea, to undertake the government of that country;
he remained there for ten consecutive years until about the time of the death of the emperor.
Herod, Philip, and Lysanias, as St. Luke relates, shared the govern­ ment of Judea with Pilate;
they were the sons of the elder Herod, during whose reign the Lord came into the world.
5
The whole period of our Lord's teaching on earth was confined within the space of four years.
During that time, as Josephus tells us, after Annas was deposed, the following Jewish high priests succeeded each other:
Ismaël, son of Baffus ;
Eleazar, son of the high priest Ananias;
Simon, son of Canufus;
and Joseph Caiaphas, who prophesied that .
Jesus should die for the people."
1 Eusebius of Cæsarea, reckoning from the sixth year of the reign of Darius, who succeeded Cyrus and Cambyses, when the works of the temple were finished, until the period of Herod and Au­ gustus, finds in Daniel seven and forty-two weeks, which make 483 years to the time when Christus, that is to say, Hircanus, the last high priest of the family of the Maccabees, was killed by Herod, and the succession of the high priests, according to the law, ceased.
But St. Hippo­ lytus reckons 230 years as the time that the kingdom of the Persians lasted, and 300 years as the duration of that of the Macedonians, and then thirty years until Christ;
that is to say, he computes 560 years from the commencement of the reign of Cyrus, king of the Persians, until the advent of our Lord.
Enlightened by these researches on the succession of ages, the studious reader will understand that the Sun of Righteousness rose in the sixth age, at the first hour of the century.
I shall, therefore, begin my in­ tended work with the history of our Lord, in whose almighty goodness I put my whole confidence, invoking his assistance in faith, that what I have begun I may finish worthily to his praise.
JESUS, being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jor­ dan into Galilee, and there, on the third day, he and his disciples were called to the marriage in Cana.
When they wanted wine, at the request of his mother, he ordered six water-pots to be filled with water, and when he had turned this water into wine, he commanded the servants to bear it to the governor of the feast.
By this beginning of miracles Jesus manifested forth his glory to his disciples, and pointed out the alteration in the carnal meaning of the old law, which by the grace of the Holy Spirit he transformed into newness of life.
1Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, who was astonished at seeing in him the man of incomparable righteousness.
He fasted forty days and forty nights, and thus taught us by his example how the just may overcome the whole race of demons by fasting and prayer.
The old serpent had overcome the first Adam by his appetite, vain glory, and unlawful desires ;
he made use of other stratagems to tempt the second Adam, by whom he was repulsed three times;
he fled, and, behold, angels came and ministered to the Son of God, who will reward in paradise with eternal felicity the conquerors of Satan.
2Our Lord, with his mother and his brethren, went down to Capernaum, and continued there not many days.
From thence, when the time of the Jews' passover was at hand, he went up to Jerusalem, and entered into the temple, where he found those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting;
all these he drove out, in a wonderful manner.
3
At the passover, on the feast-day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
Then a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to Jesus by night, desiring to confer with him secretly.
He was therefore worthy of being instructed in the efficacy of baptism, regeneration by water and the Spirit, how Christ was to descend into hell and ascend into heaven, the typical lifting up of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, and the unmerited passion of the Son of man.
4
After these things, the Lord came into Judea, and there tarried with his disciples, and performed many wonderful miracles of healing.
But John was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, because there was much water there;
and gave a true testimony in answer to the inquiries of his dis­ ciples and the Jews concerning Christ.
Then Jesus left Judea, and departed again into Galilee, passing through Samaria.
1
In a city of SaUl aria, which is called Sichar, near to the parcel of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph, there was a well called Jacob's well.
Jesus, there­ fore, being wearied with his journey, sat on the well, about the sixth hour, and held a mystical conversation with a Samaritan woman.
The Samaritans receiving the Saviour with joy, besought him that he would tarry with them, and he abode there two days;
and many devout persons believed on him.
2
From thence Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee;
and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
He taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
3At Nazareth he went into the synagogue on the sabbath- day, to read;
and, standing up, he unrolled the book of the prophet Isaiah,4 and found the place where this prophecy is written:
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor."
When he had closed the book, he gave it again to the minister, and sat down, saying :
"
This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears;
" and all wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.
Jesus himself testified that a prophet bath no honour in his own country.
That this assertion was true he proved by many examples, drawn from the Old Testament, saying:
" Many widows were in Israel, when great famine was throughout all the land;
but unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto a woman of Sarepta;
many lepers were left in want and affliction, and none of them was cleansed in Jordan by Eliseus the prophet, saving Naaman the Syrian."
All they in the synagogue, when they heard the words of the Lord, were filled with wrath.
Confirming the truth he had spoken by a sacrilegious act, they rose up against him, and in their fury thrust out of the city the chief Physician of souls, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down.
headlong.
But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way, and came down to Capernaum.
1Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee, and a ruler, whose son was sick at Capernaum, besought him as he was coming out of Judæa into Galilee, that he would come down and heal his son.
Then said Jesus unto him:
"Go thy way;
thy son liveth."
The sick man immediately recovered;
the father believed the word that Jesus had spoken, returned to his home the next day, and there found his son in perfect health, to the great joy of his family;
and learning what had happened, himself believed and his whole house.
This, as St. John says, is "the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee."
2WHEN Jesus had heard that John was cast into pri­ son, he left Nazareth, which signifies a flower, and dwelt in Capernaum, a name that means a beautiful city, and signifies the Church.
Now Nazareth, which gave the surname of Nazarene to Christ, is a small town in Galilee, near Mount Thabor.
But Capernaum is a strong city in " Galilee of the Gentiles," situate near the lake Gennesa­ reth, "in the borders of Zabulon. and Nephthali," where the Hebrews were first made captives by the Assyrians.
3
From that time, that is to say, after that John was put in prison, Jesus began to preach, because the voice being uttered, the word follows, and the law ceasing the gospel follows, as the sun succeeds the dawn of day.
"Repent," said he, " for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
"Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw Simon Peter, and Andrew his brother, and the sons of Zebedee, James and John, and calling them, they straightway left their nets and followed him.
Simon means obedient—Peter, grateful —Andrew, strong or manly—James, supplanter—John, grace of God.
These interpretations are very well suited to the characters of these holy preachers.
For without obedience no one comes to God;
without fortitude no one can perse- vere;
and be who supplants vices ascribes all the good he possesses to the grace of God.
1Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their syna­ gogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease, among the people.
And his fame went throughout all Syria, a country extending from the Euphrates to the great sea, from Cappadocia to Egypt.
They brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases, both of the mind and body, and torments, that is to say, acute sufferings, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy;
and he healed them.
2Great multitudes therefore followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond Jordan.
In doing this they were actuated by different motives;
some went to Jesus as disciples, on account of his heavenly mission;
others, to be cured of their infirmities ;
others, hearing the favourable reports that were spread abroad, and which excited their curiosity, wished to know by experience if all that was said of him were true;
some followed him from envy, wishing " to catch him in his words," and accuse him;
others, again, for the sake of obtaining food for the body.
3
Jesus, seeing the multitudes, went up into a mountain;
and when he was set, his disciples came unto him.
He, who in ancient times had given utterance to the prophets, now opened his own lips to preach to them a long discourse, full of all perfection, in which he beautifully and profitably instructed and enlightened the apostles.
Thus he who bad given the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, now taught his disciples in Galilee, on Mount Tbabor, and implanted in their hearts the principles of perfect righteousness.
He discoursed fully on the eight beatitudes, and the other com­ mandments of the law, which he came not to " destroy, but to fulfil;
" telling them that the precepts of the new law were more strict than those of the Old Testament, as they required men to love even their enemies ;
that alms were to be given in secret;
and he laid down many other rules of a perfect life.
This true Teacher of teachers con­ cluded his incomparable discourse, by remarking on the treasure to be laid up in heaven;
that no man can serve two masters;
on the fowls of the air, and the lilies of the field;
the mote and the beam in the eye;
on casting your pearls before swine;
on our entry into life through the strait gate ;
that we must beware of false prophets;
and that we must build our house upon a rock.
1When Jesus had ended these words of perfection, the multitudes were astonished at his doctrine;
for he taught them like God, who has authority over all things, and not as the Scribes and Pharisees, who were the blind slaves of the law of Moses, and could only teach the little they were capable of understanding.
2When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
And a leper worshipping him, and beseeching him to cure him of his leprosy, the Saviour touched him with his hand, and immediately made him clean, commanding him to go and shew himself to the priests, and to " offer the gifts required by the law."
In which command the necessity of confession and penance for sin is implied.
3At Capernaum he approved the faith of the centurion and, at his entreaty, healed, by a word only, his servant who lay at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
On a sabbath day, while he was teaching in the synagogue, a man possessed with a devil cried out:
" What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth ?
Art thou come to destroy us ?
I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God."
And Jesus rebuked him, saying:
" Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
And when the unclean spirit had torn him, he came out of him;
" and the man was healed, to the great amazement of all those who were present.
5
And forthwith, when he was come out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, where he saw Simon's wife's mother lying sick of a fever.
At the request of her friends, he " took her by the hand, and immediately the fever left her;
" and she arose in perfect health, and thank­ fully ministered to her divine Physician.
1At even, when the Still was setting, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils, and sick of divers diseases, and the true Physician " laid his hands on every one of them, cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick."
By the setting of the sun the death of our Lord was foreshadowed;
which happened when the Gentiles were delivered from the power of Satan, through faith, and when those who were sick with the dis­ ease of sin were healed by the remedy of a reformed life.
2WHEN
Jesus saw great multitudes about him, late in the evening, he commanded his disciples to go over unto the other side of the lake;
and when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
It was but right that, as he had performed miracles upon the land, he should exhibit the same power upon the water, in order to prove himself master both of the earth and the sea.
As soon, therefore, as he had got on board, he caused the sea to be greatly agitated, the winds to blow, and the waves to rise.
His body was indeed asleep, but his mind remained awake;
and when this tempest arose, his disciples awoke him, saying:
" Lord, save us;
we perish."
Then he arose, com­ manded the winds and the sea to be still, and there was a great calm.
3
Thus does the same Emmanuel exert his power every day on the troubled sea of the world, while the vessel of his church is tossed about by the storms of so many different tribulations, and its safety is almost endangered by the extremity of the peril to which it is exposed.
But when he is invoked with faith and tears by his true followers, he soon listens to their prayers for succour, and helps them in a marvellous manner, by virtue of his divine nature, presently removing the trials which beset them, and strengthening them with his arm.
When he had crossed the lake to come into the country of the Gergesenes, two men possessed with devils, exceed­ ingly fierce, came out of the tombs, and running up to him, cried out:
" What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God ?
art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine."
And he said unto them, " Go."
Then the devils immediately entered into the swine, and cast the whole herd into the lake.
In this manner a herd of about two thousand swine, driven into the sea by a legion of devils, was drowned;
and they that kept them fled, and coming into the city, told everything.
The Gergesenes, seeing how the two men had been healed, and their swine cast into the sea, were beyond measure affrighted;
and foolishly came forth from their city to beseech the Lord that be would depart out of their coasts.
1Gerasa is a town in Arabia,2 beyond Jordan, close to Mount Gilead;
it belonged to the tribe of Manasses, and is at no great distance from the sea of Tiberias, in which the swine were drowned.
The name signifies ejecting the inhabitants, or, the stranger approaching ;
in allusion to the Gentiles, whom the Son of God came into the world to save, when he had clothed himself with human flesh.
The two men whom the legion of devils had possessed, represent two nations, the Jews and the Gentiles, who were governed by the whole body of sins."
They lived in tombs, because they were the servants of dead works, that is to say, of sin.
The impotence of Satan is plainly manifested in this circumstance, that he was not even able to injure the swine without the permission of God.
It is worthy of notice, that, while those who are predestinated to eternal life turn to the Lord, and, by the use of a sound understanding, save themselves;
filthy and proud idol- aters, and all reprobate men who cleave to their wicked­ ness, here designated by the word swine, are condemned to live polluted in the stagnant pond of their foul deeds.
Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into Capernaum.
While be was there, so great a multi­ tude came to him to hear his word that they filled the house where he was.
Then four men brought to him one afflicted with the palsy;
and having uncovered the roof of the house, they let down before Jesus the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.
Our merciful Lord, perceiving the faith of the bearers, forgave the sins of the paralytic man, and said to him, although the Scribes were murmuring against him:
" Arise, take up thy bed, and go thy way unto thine house."
And immediately he arose, took up his bed before them all, and returned to his own home.
1As Jesus passed forth from thence, he called to him a man, named Matthei, sitting at the receipt of custom ;
the man followed him, and from the mean station of a publican was raised to the high office of an apostle and an evangelist.
As Jesus sat at meat in the house of Levi, the Pharisees murmured, and spoke to him in reproachful terms, because .
be ate with publicans and sinners;
but the benign Teacher, perceiving their evil thoughts, uttered this useful maxim:
" They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
2 Our Lord frequented the society of sinners, in order that, by teaching his hosts, he might invite and lead them to the heavenly feast.
When Jesus was talking with the disciples of John, and was rebuked by the Pharisees, because his own dis­ ciples did not fast like the followers of John, he drew a suitable comparison from the example of the children of the bridechamber, who could not mourn as long as the bridegroom was with them;
from the story of the piece of new cloth, which must not be joined to an old garment;
and of the new wine, which must not be put into old bottles.
1
He thus proves that the severe observances of the new law are not to be required of carnal men who have not yet been regenerated, until it be plainly manifest that this spiritual renovation has taken place in them, through the mystery of the passion and resurrection of our Lord.
While Jesus was speaking to the multitudes, Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came near him, threw himself at his feet, and worshipped him, saying:
" Lord, my daughter is even now dead;
but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."
The good Physician arose, and immediately followed him.
But a great multitude surrounded and pressed upon him, and a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all her living upon physi­ cians (by which term are meant the false theologians or philosophers, and the doctors of the secular laws), neither could be healed of any, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment;
for she said within herself:
" If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole."
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said:
" Daughter, be of good comfort;
thy faith hath made thee whole."
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she was made whole.
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, he said:
" Give place;
for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth."
And they laughed him to scorn.
But when the people were put forth, he went into the chamber, but suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden;
and he took the damsel by the hand, and commanded her to arise, and that some­ thing should be given her to eat.
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
Jairus, whose name signifies illuminating, or illuminated, represents Moses and the other doctors of the law;
the damsel, about twelve years of age, is the symbol of the synagogue;
the woman with the issue of blood is the emblem of the church of the Gentiles, which had before received the faith through Christ, and was graciously saved from the corruptions of idolatry and carnal pleasures.
Lastly :
as the young maiden is said to have come to life again by the command of the Lord, in the same way will Israel at last be saved, when the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
Jesus departing thence, two blind men followed him, crying:
" Thou Son of David, have mercy on us."
And when he was come into the house, he touched their eyes, and theyagain saw the light of heaven.
1
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man, possessed with a devil.
And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake;
and the multitudes marvelled, saying, " It was never so seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, " He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils."
2The multitudes sought Jesus in the desert place, and when they had found him they wished to stay him, that -he should not depart from them.
3
As the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, Jesus entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land, into the lake of Genesareth.
And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.
Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, who had toiled all the night in vain:
" Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake with the weight.
4In those days he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples;
and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named Apostles, that is to say, "sent."
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these;
Simon Peter, and Andrew his brother;
James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Philip and Bartholomew;
Thomas and Matthew ;
James, the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus ;
Simon, the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
5
The sacred number of the apostles is not free from mystery;
for the number twelve designates those who were to preach faith in the Holy Trinity throughout the four quarters of the world.
The quartenary number tripled makes the number twelve, which figure was often used before for many purposes.
The apostles are represented by the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve princes of the people of Israel, the twelve springs found in Elim, the twelve jewels of the priest's vestment, the twelve loaves of shew-bread, the twelve spies sent by Moses, the twelve stones of the altar, the twelve stones taken out of the river Jordan, the twelve oxen that supported the brazen sea, the twelve stars in the crown of the bride, and the twelve foundations and twelve gates of the heavenly Jerusalem, described in the book of Revelation.
They were prefigured by many other signs excellently adapted to make known to the nations the mysteries of God.THE glorious Emmanuel went about all Galilee, preach­ ing the gospel in all the villages, towns, and cities, that is to say, both to small and great, without re­ spect of persons.
He did not regard the power of the nobles, but the salvation of believers;
and, after his teaching, sweet as honey, he healed every sickness and every disease, that those whom his discourses could not persuade, might be convinced by the greatness of his works.
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted and lay down, as sheep having no shepherd.
He therefore called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them power to cast out unclean spirits, and to heal all manner of sickness ;
and he said to them, "As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils;
freely ye have re­ ceived, freely give.
Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
nor scrip for your journey;
neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves."
1
Their heavenly Master gave them many more profitable admonitions, which his faithful historians, Matthew and Luke, have handed down to us in their writings.
Jesus went into a city of Galilee, called Nain, which is situate not far from Endor, about two miles south of Mount Thabor.
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, surrounded by a great multitude, they were carrying out the corpse of a young man, who was the only son of a widow;
and when the Lord saw her weeping, he had com­ passion on her, and said unto her, " Weep not."
And he came and touched the bier, and they that bare him stood still, and he said to the dead man, " Young man, I say unto thee, Arise!
”And he immediately revived, and sitting up began to speak;
and the Giver of life delivered him to his mother in perfect health.
And there came a fear on all who witnessed this miracle,1 it being the will of God that a great multitude should follow the Lord;
and much people accompany the widow, in order that, there being many.
witnesses of this great miracle, many might be found to give praise to God.
Now when John bad heard, in Herod's prison, the works of Christ, he sent from thence two of his disciples, that they might diligently inquire of the wisdom of God, what were the secrets of the divine will.
And when the messengers of John were departed, Jesus began to say many things con­ cerning the greatness of John, and likened the generation of the Jews to children sitting in the market-place.
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not on hearing him preach.
Hitherto he had reproved the whole Jewish race in common, but now he reprimanded each of their cities by name, especially Chorazin, that is to say, my mystery;
Beth­ saida, that is to say, the house of fruits ;
and Capharnaum, because they would not be converted when they saw these signs and mighty works.
2After this Jesus returned thanks to God his Father, because he had hid his secrets from the wise men of this world, but had revealed them unto babes.
3When the Pharisees reproved his disciples, because, as they went on the sabbath day through the corn-fields, they plucked the ears of corn and did eat, rubbing them in their hands;
our Saviour excused them, inasmuch as they had followed the example set by David and Abiathar the high priest, saying:
" The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.
Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
1On another sabbath he entered into the synagogue, and healed a man whose right hand was withered.
But the Pharisees, moved with envy at the glory Jesus had gained by his many miracles, went out straightway and took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
Wherefore Jesus withdrew himself thence, and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb, and he healed him, insomuch that he both spake and saw.
But when the Scribes and Pharisees wished to depre­ ciate the works of Christ, by a false interpretation, de­ siring him to show them a sign from heaven, he spoke to them words of profound wisdom and spiritual comfort, by which he reproved the wicked and taught the good.
He told them that to an evil generation no sign should be given, but the sign of the prophet Jonas, and he set before them, in comparison with themselves, the queen of the south, who came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and the Ninevites who re­ pented.
2When his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him, he stretched forth his band toward his disciples, and said:
" Whoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
3
The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea-side, and great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat, and spake many things in parables unto the multitude that stood on the shore.
From the husbandman, who went forth to sow, he took occasion to show the similarity of his own labours ;
and of the seed itself, part perished, because some fell by the way side, and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it;
some fell upon stony places, and some among thorns, and was choked by divers accidents ;
but other fell on good ground, and yielded much fruit.
What these things mean, I shall explain in a few sentences :
The seed is the word of God;
the sower is Christ;
the birds are the demons;
the way is a depraved mind, worn and dried up by the continual circulation of evil thoughts;
the rock represents the hardness of a reprobate soul;
the good ground represents the gentleness of an obedient spirit, but the sun the heat of a cruel persecution;
the thorns are the hearts of those who are tormented by the desire to become rich;
the good ground is a devout and faithful soul which brings forth fruit, some an hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, some thirty-fold.
1
He who, in all his actions, has eternity constantly in view, bears fruit an hundred-fold;
he that bears fruit sixty-fold performs works perfected by sound doctrine, signified by the numbers six and ten;
the fruit increased thirty-fold typifies faith with sound doctrine, by the numbers three and ten.
Or in other words:
the fruit multiplied a hundred-fold, recalls to our mind the virgins and martyrs, either in their sanctity of life or contempt of death ;
2 the fruit multiplied sixty times is that of widows, on account of the internal calm which they enjoy, because they have not to struggle against the desires of the flesh.
It is the custom to allow persons of sixty years of age to repose after their warfare.
But the fruit multiplied thirty- fold is that of married people;
because this is the age fit for contending with the world.
After this, the true Prophet, seeing the multitudes that were gathered together unto him, spake other parables unto them, of the good seed that was sown and the tares, of the grain of mustard seed, and of the leaven which the woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
Our Saviour, sitting in the boat, is like a rich master of a house, who refreshes his guests with different kinds of food, that each of them may take those which his stomach requires.
So our Lord makes use of different para­ bles, that he may suit the diverse tastes of his bearers.
1Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house;
and when his disciples questioned him on the subject, he expounded to them the parable of the tares.
He also, at the same time, added and explained to them the figurative meaning of the parables of the treasure hid in a field;
of the merchantman and the pearl;
and of the nets cast into the sea.
From thence he came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogues, insomuch that all were astonished.
2WHEN our Saviour, invited by a Pharisee, was eating in his house, a woman, which was a sinner, began to wash his feet with her tears, as he sat at the table, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and anointed them with ointment.
All the things that she had unlawfully made use of when leading a life of sin, she now in her repentant state sacrificed entirely to God;
all the seductions she possessed in herself, she now converted into offerings to heaven.
The Pharisee, swelling with false righteousness, rebuked the sick woman for her infirmity, and the Physician for affording her relief.
Hence arose the parable of the two debtors;
and the man was convicted by his own admission, like the madman who carries the cord with which he is to be bound.
The Judge, to whose eyes the most secret things are naked and open, noted the deserts of the penitent sinner, and rebuked the wickedness of the unjust Pharisee.
He then forgave the sins of Mary, because, as he himselr testified, she loved much ;
saying to her:
" Thy faith bath saved thee;
go in peace.”
3While the Lord and his disciples were thus preaching, certain women, that is to say, Mary, called Magdalene, Joanna, the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, with many others, inspired by God, followed him and minis- tered unto him of their substance.
It was a custom among the Jews, and was not considered wrong, for women, according to this national institution, to furnish their teachers with food and raiment.
This custom, St. Paul tells us, he rejected, because he feared it might be an occasion of scandal to the Gentiles.
Susanna signifies, a lily;
Joanna, the gracious, or merciful, Lord;
Mary, the bitter sea;
Magdalene, a tower.
From the signification of these names, it may be clearly perceived what privileges are conferred upon the hand-maids of the Lord .for their meritorious services.
1After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
He there healed, at the sheep­ pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, a certain man, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
In the water of this pool the priests washed the flesh of the victims which they offered in sacrifice to God, accord­ ing to the law.
This pool had five porches, in which lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
For an angel of the Lord went down (at a certain season) into the pool, and troubled the water;
whosoever then first, after the troubling of the water, stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
At Christ's command, the man was imme­ diately made whole, and took up his bed;
and on the same day was the sabbath.
The Jews, therefore, beginning to murmur and blaspheme, Jesus, the wisdom of the Father, answering them, as St. John, the divine, relates, manifested the mysteries of his divinity in various ways, and bore a re­ markable testimony to his shining light John, and to Moses.
2At that time Herod, the tetrarch, heard of the fame of Jesus, and said unto his servants:
" This is John the Bap­ tist ;
he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him!"
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, whom he had taken from his brother Philip, and had married, in spite of the remonstrances of John.
This cunning and adulterous king would have put to death the herald of truth, but he feared the multitude, because they treated the prophet of God with great venera­ tion.
Herod was also afraid of John, because he knew him to be a just and holy man;
but he was overcome by his passion for the woman, and God's righteous judgment so ordered it that the desire of the adulteress made him shed the blood of the holy prophet.
Herod on his birth-day made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee ;
and when the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king promised with an oath to give her what­ soever she would ask of him.
She, being before instructed by her perfidious mother, requested that he would give her in a charger the head of John the Baptist.
The cruel king sent an executioner, and commanded him to cut off the head of the messenger of Christ, which was brought in a charger to the young woman, who was to be thus rewarded for her talent in dancing, and the viands were thus polluted with blood at this impure festival.
But the disciples of John buried his body in Samaria, and coming to Jesus, told him all that had happened.
Our Saviour, when he heard of the execution of John the Baptist, his servant, departed, and crossing the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias, retired into a desert place apart;
not because he dreaded death, but because he wished to spare his enemies the crime of adding another murder to the one already committed, should the sight of his many miracles rouse their deadly zeal.
1
He, therefore, chose to put off the day of his death until the time of the passover, and thus afford us an example of evading the sudden attacks of traitors.
When the people heard of his departure, they followed him on foot;
and Jesus, seeing a great multitude, was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
And when it was evening, he took five barley-loaves and two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave them to his disciples to set before the multitude, whom he had previously commanded to sit down on the green grass.
The apostles ministered to the wants of five thousand men, beside women and children, who did all eat and were filled;
and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
2
All these things are full of mysteries.
Jesus leaves Judea, and comes into the desert of the Gentiles ;
the people follow him;
moved with com­ passion, he heals their sick;
he feeds them with the five barley-loaves of the Mosaic law, and with the two fishes, which are the figure of the prophets and of the psalms.
He performed this miracle in the evening, signifying the close of time, when the Sun of righteousness set for us.
Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said :
“
This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world."
When Jesus, therefore, per­ ceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side of the sea;
and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray.
When the evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves, and they toiled nearly the whole night in rowing, for the wind was contrary.
In the fourth watch of the night, when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty fur­ longs, he cometh unto them walking upon the sea;
and when they saw him, they were troubled, because they supposed it had been a spirit, and they cried out for fear;
but straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying:
" It is I;
be not afraid." " Lord, said Peter, " if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
And he said, " Come."
And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind bois­ terous, he was afraid;
and, beginning to sink, he cried, saying, " Lord, save me.”
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, because he called to him in the hour of danger, and said unto him:
" 0 thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased;
and those, who saw this worshipped him, and confessed that he was the Son of God.
'It is necessary to remark that St. John describes the miracle of the loaves as having taken place near the time of the passover;
but St. Matthew and St. Mark relate that it happened immediately after the beheading of St. John the Baptist;
from which we may conclude that St. John was beheaded shortly before Easter, and that, in the year follow- ing, when the time of the passover was again at hand the mystery of the passion of our Lord was accomplished.
Jesus with his disciples came into the land of Genne­ sareth, where he was received with joy by the men of that place, and he healed their sick.
For the merciful kindness of their Saviour drew them to him;
and they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased, and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment;
and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
1In the same place he had many disputes with the scribes and Pharisees, which came from Jerusalem, and refuted the superstitious traditions of the elders.
2
The multitudes took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus ;
and he said to them :
“Verily, verily, I say unto you:
Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Soil of man shall give unto you;
for him bath God the Father sealed."
These, and many other like things about the bread from heaven and eternal life, said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum;
but the Jews, whose heart was of stone, did not understand them.
They therefore said:
This is an hard saying."
Many of his disciples, blinded by malice, began to murmur against him, and were so offended at his words that they went back, and walked no more with him.
Then said Jesus unto the twelve:
" Will ye also go away ?”
Simon Peter answered him:
" Lord, to whom shall we go ?
thou hast the words of eternal life.
And we believe, and are sure that thou art Christ, the Son of God."
3After these things Jesus walked in Galilee;
for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
Then, as the historian St. John relates, his relations, who, in compliance with the Jewish custom, were called "his brethren," invited him to go with them to the feast of tabernacles, that he might show himself openly to the world.
And when they, who sought for worldly glory, set out on their journey, he abode still in Galilee.
Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up, and taught in the temple, and all the Jews marvelled at his doctrine.
The Pharisees heard that the people differed in opinion respecting him, and sent officers to take him;
but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
1
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying:
" If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
He that believeth on me, as the Scripture bath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive ;
for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.
Many of the people, when they heard this saying, said:
" Of a truth this is the Prophet."
Others said:
" This is the Christ."
But some said;
" Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
Hath not the Scripture said that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was ?"
So there was a division among the people because of him.
But the officers, who had been sent by the chief priests and Pharisees to take Jesus, when they heard his sayings, forgot the purpose for which they were sent, and returned without any accusation against him, but full of admiration.
When, therefore, the cruel magistrates harshly demanded of their officers why they had not brought the Teacher of life bound before them, they, taught by divine inspiration, bore true testimony concerning the doctrine of Christ;
for their answer to those who sent them was:
" Never man spake like this man."
And we must not be astonished at this, when we consider that he who spoke to them was both God and than.
But as these proud rulers of the people endea­ voured wickedly to suppress the truth, Nicodemus put a stop to their criminal efforts by the authority of the law;
so that, their designs being frustrated, they returned home, void of faith, and without deriving any benefit from this conference.
2From thence Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives;
and early in the morning he came again into the temple, where he sat down, and taught all the people that came unto him.
And they brought unto him a woman taken in adultery, who, though condemned by strict justice, was absolved by the sweetness of his mercy.
Pharisaic craft had reckoned on ensnaring Christ, and lowering him in the eyes of the people, by exhibiting him as either harsh, or disregarding the law.
For if he had condemned the accused woman, in obedience to the law of Moses, they would have charged him with cruelty, and taunted him with forgetting to show that mercy which he was continually preaching;
and would thus have rendered him odious to the people by whom he was beloved.
If, on the contrary, he had forbid­ dell them to stone the adulteress, from a love of clemency, they would have accused him of being an enemy to the law and of encouraging crime.
But he, the true Wisdom, broke the snares of these wicked men like the threads of a spider's web, in virtue of his supreme authority.
He said unto them:
" He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
In the first part of the sentence, we discover the feeling of a compassionate observer;
in the second, the sentence of a just judge.
Stooping down, he wrote on the ground with his finger, and his word, as a two­ edged sword, pierced the conscience of these insidious men:
thus he completely satisfied the severity of justice and the gentleness of mercy.
At last these crafty questioners, struck with shame at the equity of the sentence pro­ nounced, left the adulterous woman, and, beginning at the eldest, went out one by one.
Then the Supreme Judge kindly lifted up the accused woman, thus left alone with him:
"Go,” he said unto her, "and sin no more."
See how his mercy pardons past sins, while his justice forbids the presumption of sinning any more.
1In the treasury, Jesus spake unto them of his being the true light of the world, expatiated on the nature of liberty, on his own exaltation, on the servitude of sin, and on false­ hood and truth.
The enraged Jews, in answer to the blessed words of Christ, replied:
“ Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil."
Notwithstanding, however, their inju­ rious language, he replied with patience, instructed them with humility, and taught the knowledge of divine things to those who were to be saved.
But they, becoming infuriated, collected stones to cast at him;
but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the templet
As he passed by, seeing a man which was blind from his birth, he spat on the ground, and making clay of the spittle, anointed the eyes of the blind man, and said unto him:
" Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.”
He went his way, therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
This was done on a sabbath-day;
and in consequence, a great division arose among the Jews.
The man whose eyes were opened was cast out of the synagogue, because he bare witness to him from whom he had received his sight;
but was after­ wards recognized and received by him whom he loved with so much reason.
Then Jesus related to them the parable of the door of the sheepfold, of the shepherd and his flock, and of the good pastor and the hireling.
Many of the Jews received his words;
but a great number, on the con­ trary, lightly rejected them.
2Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon;
where a woman of Canaan earnestly entreated him that he would heal her daughter, who was grievously vexed with a devil.
His disciples besought him [to send her away] ;
but, after some hesitation, he granted her prayer, and having commended the faith and humi­ lity of the mother, freed the daughter from the power of the demon.
3
And departing from the coasts of Tyre, the chief city of the Canaanites, he came by Sidon, a town of Phœnicia, unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Deca­ polis.
He there took aside from the multitude one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech, and, putting his fingers into his ears, he spat, and touched his tongue, and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said unto him:
" Ephphatha,” that is, Be opened.
And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
And those who were witnesses of this miracle were astonished, saying:
" He bath done all things well;
he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
”
1Jesus came nigh unto the sea of Galilee, and went up into a mountain, and taught the great multitudes that came unto him.
And they cast at Jesus' feet those that were dumb, lame, blind, maimed, and many others, and he healed them;
insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see.
2
In the same manner the Lord works spiritually in his holy church, and by his grace a multitude of sinners are saved every day.
The dumb are those who refuse to sing praises to the Lord, and who do not confess a belief in him.
The blind are those who do not understand, although they obey.
The deaf are those who will not obey, even though they understand.
The lame are those who neglect to fulfil the divine precepts, and walk through the devious paths of wickedness.
Such are the men who are healed every day by the grace of God, and are guided into the way that leads to life eternal.
Those who feared the Lord, and were eye- witnesses of these corporeal signs, magnified the King of sabaoth with joy.
Now also the faithful rejoice in the con­ version of sinners, and devoutly glorify the Lord God of Israel, who doeth all good things.
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said:
"I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat;
and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way."
He then commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and taking seven loaves and a few little fishes, gave thanks, brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
And they did all eat, and were filled;
and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala or Dalmanutha,in the neighbourhood of Gennesa­ reth.
Here the Sadducees and the Pharisees, tempting him, desired that he would shew them a sign from heaven, for they made light of the great miracle he had performed in feeding four thousand men with seven loaves, and filling seven baskets with the fragments that remained.
But he reproved their insolence;
and refusing to give them any other sign than that of the prophet Jonas, left them, and entering into the ship again, departed to the other side.
1At Bethsaida, they besought him to touch a blind man.
And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town;
and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught.
And he said:
" I see men as trees walking."
Jesus put his hands again upon his eyes, and he was restored, and began to see every thing clearly.
Our Lord then said to him:
" Go unto thine house;
and if thou enter the town, thou shalt not tell it to any one."
2And Jesus went out, and came into the towns of Cæsarea Philippi;
and by the way he asked his disciples what men thought concerning him ?
And they answered:
“Some say that thou art John the Baptist;
some, Elias;
and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets."
He saith unto them :
"
But whom say ye that I am ?’
And Simon Peter answered and said:
" Thou art the Christ, the SOIl of the living God."
And Jesus answered and said unto him:
“ Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood bath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church;
and the gates of hell shall not pre­ vail against it.
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven ;
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
He then charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusa­ lem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
Then Peter, taking him aside, from excessive love began to rebuke him, saying:
" Be it far from thee, Lord;
this shall not be unto thee."
But he turned, and said unto Peter:
" Get thee behind me, Satan;
thou art an offence unto me, for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.”
After the Lord had shown to his disciples the mystery of his passion and resurrection, he exhorted them, as well as the people, to follow the example of his passion, and promised them the reward provided for those who suffer.
1After six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves ;
and he was transfigured before them.
And his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment became as white as snow.
And there appeared unto them Moses and Elias, talking with him ;
and, behold, a bright cloud over­ shadowed them;
and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said:
" This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased;
hear ye him.”
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
And Jesus came and touched them, and said:
"Arise, and be not afraid."
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.
And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying:
. " Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead."
Then, in answer to their inquiry, he told them that Elias was come already;
and they understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
2
On the next day, when he was come to the multitude, straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and, running to him, saluted him.
Then a certain man of the company came to him, and threw him­ self down on his knees, saying:
" Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic from his infancy, and sore vexed;
for ofttimes the devil bath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him;
and I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him."
And when Jesus had com­ manded the sick child to be brought, while he was yet com­ ing, the evil spirit threw him down and tare him ;
and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and charged him to come out of him, and to enter no more into him.
And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him, and he fell on the ground as one dead, insomuch that many said that he was dead.
But Jesus, took him by the hand, lifted him up, and delivered him whole to his father.
Afterwards, when the disciples asked him privately why they could not heal him, he said unto them:
"Because of your unbelief;
for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence, and it shall remove ;
and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
How­ beit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.”
1And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them:
" The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men, and they shall kill him ;
and the third day he shall rise again."
And they were exceeding sorry.
2AND when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said:
"Doth not your Master pay tribute ? " He saith, "Yes."
And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying:
" Of whom do the kings of the earth take tribute ? of their own children, or of strangers ?"
Peter saith unto him:
" Of strangers."
Christ was the Son of a King, both according to the flesh and the Spirit, whether we consider him as born of the seed of David, or as the Word of the Almighty Father.
Therefore, as the son of a king, he was not obliged to pay tribute money;
but he who had taken upon him the humility of the flesh wished to fulfil all righteousness.
In every kingdom, it is clear, children are free from taxation :
Jesus saith unto Peter:
" Then are the children free.
Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take the fish that first cometh up ;
and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money;
that take, and give unto them for me and thee."3
This fish is the figure of Christ;
the sea represents mortal life;
the tribute money, or the two drachms, means confession, which is given for Peter as for a sinner, but for Christ as for a Lamb without spot and guiltless.
gThen there arose a reasoning among the apostles, which of them should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said:
" Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven;
" adding other precepts, concern­ ing humility and gentleness, avoiding to offend little children, and correcting a brother mildly.
He then spoke to them of paternal kindness, and set before them the parable of the king who forgave his servant the debt of ten thousand talents, when he besought him, and of that same servant who refused to acquit a fellow servant who owed him an hundred pence.
The discourse, after payment of the tribute, in commendation of humility and innocence, and teaching us how to correct and pardon, being ended, the righteous Teacher departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan;
and great multitudes followed him;
and he healed them there.
1When the Pharisees asked him if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife, he referred to the fixed Jaw of marriage, saying:
" What God bath joined together, let not man put asunder."
2Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray:
and his disci­ ples rebuked those that brought them.
But Jesus was much displeased, and said unto them:
" Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not:
for of such is the kingdom of heaven."3A young man asked him, kneeling, the way to eternal salvation;
when, after instructing him in the command­ ments of the law, he added:
"If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven;
and come and follow me."
But when he heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Then said Jesus:
" Verily I say unto you,
That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
Peter, hearing what was said in praise of voluntary poverty, self-complacently said to the Lord:
" Be­ hold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee;
what shall we have therefore ?"
And Jesus said unto them:
" Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the SOIl of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, shall also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And every one that hath forsaken houses, or bre­ thren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
But many that are first shall be last;
and the last shall be first.”
1He then set before them the parable of the householder, who took labourers into his vineyard at different hours of the day, but gave to all of them the same hire, one penny, begin­ ning from the last unto the first.
2
These different hours of the day are understood to represent typically the past ages.
Abel laboured at day-break, Noe at the third hour, Abraham at the sixth, and the lawgiver Moses at the ninth.
At the “ eleventh hour "
Christ came, rebuked the Gentiles, because they stood idle in the great market-place of this world, and commanded them to work by faith in the vineyard of his church.
Or, these different hours may also be likened to the several stages of a man’s life.
The morning represents childhood;
the third hour of the day, youth;
the sixth hour is emblematical of manhood;
the ninth, of old age ;
the eleventh, of decrepitude, or superannuation.
At all these ages conversions take place;
and the converts are rewarded with the penny of everlasting life.
A modern poet thus speaks of this similitude :
—
When the sun sinks in the west, And the vineyard-labourers claim Wages due and grateful rest, Their reward is all the same;
Whether through the noontide heat Bending o'er the thirsty soil;
Whether theirs, with lingering feet, Cooler hours and lighter toil.
Tasks unequal-equal hire--
Such the master's righteous will;
All that justice can require, Thus both first and last fulfil.
In the vineyard of the Lord, Young and old, and weak and wise, Taught by His most holy word, Surely gain the glorious prize.
THUS far I have attentively examined, for a salutary exercise, as I have been able to gather from the writings of the evangelists, and endeavoured to relate briefly, the works which our Lord performed during the first two years of his mission.
It is now my duty to search out the acts of his third year, and briefly to recount the important and memorable deeds of our Lord after his departure from Galilee into Judea, that he might accomplish in Jerusalem the mystery of his Fathers dispensation, and reveal to us by his own ineffable operation the hidden things of the law and the prophets.
He, indeed, at first taught in the eastern parts of Judea, beyond Jordan;
but afterwards on this side of it, when he went to Jericho and Jerusalem.
For although the whole kingdom of the Jews was generally called Judea, to distinguish it from other countries, yet the southern part was more especially named Judea, as distinct from Samaria, Galilee, Decapolis, and the other districts of the same province.
Jesus, on his way to Jerusalem, privately foretold his passion to his disciples.
Then the mother of Zebedee's children desired him to grant that her two sons might sit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, in his kingdom.
But he taught them to be patient and lowly, and he himself set an example of perfect righteous­ ness for them to follow.
In answer to John's inquiry, he commanded him not to forbid any one to perform miracles in his name.
1
As he was drawing nigh unto Jerusalem, he sent messengers before his face into a village of the Samari­ tans;
but they did not receive them.
However, when James and John wished him to command fire to come down from heaven upon the heads of the men who had treated him with scorn, he rebuked his disciples, saying:
“ Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.
”
1After these things the Lord appointed seventy-two disciples, and sent them, two and two, into every city and place whither he himself would come, and gave them directions to whom and how they were to preach.
He then upbraided the cities that would not believe in his name.
And when the seventy-two disciples returned again with joy to him, the Lord charged them not to rejoice in this, that the spirits were subject unto them, but because their names were written in heaven;
he referred all praise to his Father, and called the eyes of the disciples blessed, because they saw those things which many just men and kings before them had desired to see, but had not seen.
2
When a lawyer asked him a question, tempting him, lie showed him what to do in order to inherit eternal life, and mentioned the case of the man who " went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves," proving to them all that the Samaritan, who, when the priest and the Levite passed by on the other side, went to the assistance of the man who had been wounded by the thieves, was his neighbour, because he had compassion on him.
3
In a certain village, a woman named Martha received Jesus into her house, and when she complained to him that her sister had left her to serve alone, and would not help her, he put a stop to her murmurs by asserting that Mary had " chosen the good part."
4St. Matthew, in the Lord's prayer, gives the seven petitions in the following words:
—Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive its our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And lead its not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
In the first three petitions we pray for things eternal, but in the last four for things temporal, which are, however, necessary in order to acquire those that are eternal.
Now St. Luke has but five requests, thus:
—Our Father, Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Give us day by day our daily bread;
and forgive its our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to its.
And lead us not into temptation.
Thus we see seven petitions, according to St. Matthew, reduced to five in St. Luke's gospel:
for in­ stance, the name of God is sanctified in the Spirit;
but the kingdom of God is to come in the resurrection of the flesh.
He then adds three others, for the daily bread, for the remission of sins, and for avoiding temptation.
All that man requires in this life and the next may be understood to be embraced by these petitions.
1
For this reason, when the disciples said to Jesus, " Lord, teach us to pray," he not only gave them a form of prayer, but taught them to pray frequently and with importunity.
He admonished them to persevere constantly in their petitions to Heaven, and related to them the parable of the friend who requested the loan of three loaves at midnight.
He advised them to " ask, seek, and knock;
” he, therefore, exhorted them to ask for the bread of the word of God, by which the friend, that is to say, the soul, is nourished;
to seek for the friend who gives abundantly, that is to say, the Lord;
to knock at the door of divine mercy, through which they enter the treasury of wisdom, where the celestial joys are kept.
The word bread is understood to signify charity, with which the stone, that is to say, the hardness of avarice, is contrasted.
The fish repre­ sents the faith of invisible baptism, on account of the water used, or because it is caught in invisible places, and is im­ perishable by the waves of this world that roar around it;
with this the venomous serpent is contrasted;
this last is the figure of perfidy or incredulity.
The egg is the em- blem of hope ;
because the egg is not yet a perfect foetus, but we hope to see it become one by being hatched.
Now despair is the reverse of hope;
it has for its image the scorpion, which strikes the unwary with its envenomed sting from behind, and the secret puncture causes sudden death.
Our Saviour accused the Pharisees of blasphemy and ingratitude for the acts of mercy which they witnessed.
He took the illustration of the armed man who was overcome by a man stronger than himself, and spoke of the unclean spirit that returned into the man, with seven other spirits more wicked than himself.
1
When a certain woman lifted up her voice, and said, that the womb that bare him was blessed, he answered that he who kept the word of God was blessed.
2
When he had healed the man on whom three miracles were performed at the same time (being blind he saw, dumb he spoke, possessed with a devil was freed), he, who was the truth itself, gave them many precepts conducive to salvation, repelled with the.
weapons of reason the Pharisees who tempted him, told them that a lighted candle was not to be put under a bushel, but on a candlestick;
and taught them that the eye ought to be singled
When the Pharisee, who had besought him to dine with him, marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner, after the manner of the Jews, Jesus observed that external ablutions did not purify their inward parts, which were foul with sins, and repeating, “Woe to the Pharisees," six times, added a long list of their evil deeds
He also charged his disciples to take heed of the leaven of hypocrisy, not to be afraid of them that can only kill the body;
and, in the hour of persecution, to take no thought what they should say.
5
When one of the company requested him to divide the inheritance between him and his brother, he related the parable of the rich miser.
He then warned his disciples to avoid, like the fowls of the air, being careful for meat and raiment.
1
Having promised the kingdom to the little flock, he, commanded them to sell all that they possessed, and all they acquired, and to give alms;
telling them that their loins ought to be girded about, and their lamps burn­ ing.
He also commanded them to watch, mentioning the case of the two servants, the one good, the other bad;
and declared that the servant, which knew his lord's will, but did it not, should be beaten with many stripes, while he that knew not should be beaten with few stripes.
2
He told them that he was come to send fire- on the earth, by reason of their divisions ;
that, as they could discern the face of the sky, they ought to discern the signs of the times;
and recommended them to consent to the demands of their adversary, while they were in the way.
3
When he was told that Pilate had put to death some of the Galileans, Jesus, answering, said, that all should likewise perish, unless they repented;
or be like the eighteen who were crushed by the fall of the tower in Siloam.
In the parable of the barren fig-tree, he warns those who defer the hour of repentance.
4
He made straight on the sabbath-day a woman who had been bowed together eighteen years;
and when some of them murmured, because Jesus had healed on that day, he silenced them by saying that an ox must be led away to watering on the sabbath ;
and all the people rejoiced for the glorious things that were done by him.
5
Comparing the kingdom of God to a grain of mustard seed and to leaven, he spoke of the few that enter in at the strait gate, and said:
" There are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."
6 The Lord then called Herod a " fox," a name by which heretics are designated, on account of the deceitful and insidious character of their conduct;
and reproved Jerusalem because it refused to seek the protection of his wings.
7
He healed, on the sabbath-day, a certain man which had the dropsy, ridding him as it were of a fountain of humours;
and when the Pharisees objected, he confounded them by asking if they did not [on the sabbath-day] pull an ass or an ox out of a pit into which it had fallen.
He taught them to practise humility, not seeking the first places at a feast;
and to bid to their table, not the rich, but the poor, who could not return their hospitality.
1THE Lord Jesus Christ, employing various means to further the salvation of man, gives us the parable of those that were bidden to a supper;
but, as they all sought to be excused, they were not considered worthy of such an honour.
The first refused the invitation, because he had bought a piece of ground;
representing those who through love of worldly things, make no account of heavenly things.
Another, who was prevented by his five yoke of oxen, is the type of those curious persons, who, influenced by the bodily senses, scrutinize external things only, and, while they remark the life of others, and neglect the care ot their own souls, refuse to take their place at the banquet of eternal salvation.
The third, who refused to be present on account of his recent marriage, is the image of all persons who allow themselves to be caught in the meshes of carnal pleasure.
Thus, while one man is occupied with the cares of this world, another is tormented by incessantly thinking of the actions of his neighbours, a third allows his mind to be defiled by the pleasures of the flesh;
but all equally disdain to hasten to the banquet of eternal life.
2
Our Saviour told the great multitudes that went with him, that they must not only give up all their connections, but their own life, and take up the cross and follow him.
That they might not fail, be suggested that they ought to act like the man who, “ intending to build a tower, sitteth down first and counteth the cost, and proposed the example of the two kings who were going to make war against each other.
3
When they murmured because be kept company with sinners, he spake unto them the parable of the lost sheep, and of the piece of silver;
the owners of which were as joyful at finding them as they were sorrowful at having lost them.
He told them that there would be likewise joy in the presence of the angels of God over the salvation of one sinner that repenteth.
But true penitence consists in contrition for sins committed, and a resolution not to repeat what is now lamented.
He who has done what is forbidden, ought also, in order to satisfy the will of God, to deny himself what is permitted.
1
The Lord then gave them the parable of the frugal and prodigal sons, shewing them how the prodigal son returned to his father, who received him with the greatest kindness, and kissed him;
how he put the best robe upon him, that is to say, the garb of innocence;
gave him the ring of sincere faith, and put shoes on his feet, that is to say, ordained him to preach the gospel.
In thus adorning the hands and feet of the convert, the Lord typified good works and missions.
The father, having killed the fatted calf, made a great supper.
Now his elder son, that is to say, the Jewish people, as he drew nigh to the house from the field, which represents external observances, heard music and dancing, that is to say, remarked that the sons of the church, full of the Holy Ghost, preached the gospel with harmonious voice.
Having obtained information respecting the cause of these signs of joy, he was angry with his father, complaining that he had killed the fatted calf for the son who had devoured his living with harlots, and had a greater regard for him than for himself.
2After this our Lord introduced the case of the unjust steward, who, by a crafty device, reduced what was due to his lord.
3
He declared that we cannot serve God and mammon;
rebuked the avaricious Pharisees, telling them that the law and the prophets were until John the Baptist;
and then related the parable of the unmerciful rich man who was clothed in purple, and the poor beggar, showing, from the fate of the merely selfish, what will be that of such as live by robbery.
4
After saying, "Woe to the man by whom the offence cometh," he commanded [Peter] to forgive a repentant brother " until seventy times seven."
1The apostles, beseeching him to increase their faith, are taught how they might remove a sycamine-tree;
and drawing a comparison between them and the servant plough­ ing or feeding cattle, the Lord informs them that they must confess themselves " unprofitable servants," even when they shall have done all those things which were commanded.
3
As Jesus went to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
And as he entered into a certain village, he cleansed ten men that were lepers, but only one of them, and he a stranger, returned to give glory to God.
'
It being enquired when the kingdom of God should come, Jesus answered that it would not come with observation, and he compared the advent of the Son of man to a flash of lightning.
He told them that the day of judgment ought to be continually the object of the thoughts of men, as it would come suddenly upon them ;
and he likened that day to the days of Noe and Lot, when death unexpectedly came upon mankind, He also spake of the two persons, either in bed, or at the mill, or in the field, one of whom would be chosen and the other left.
The bed is the figure of the church in a state of rest;
our Saviour speaks of two as of two persons ;
but we must understand the expression to mean two states of the affections;
for he who, for God's sake, practices con­ tinence, so that, living without any worldly cares, he may keep his thoughts bent upon the things that be of God, will be admitted by him to happiness eternal.
He, on the con­ trary, who, from love of the praise of men, although free from the corruption of other vices, tarnishes the purity of the monastic life to which he is devoted, will be left to eternal misery;
as Jeremiah intimates in his Lamenta­ ti.ons, when he describes the fall of an idle and sinful soul, under the figure of Judea, in these words:
" The adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths."
4
The two women grinding at the mill (in allusion to the revolutions of tem- poral affairs), represent the vulgar who ought to be governed by their teachers, as women are by their husbands, and, by their labours in various arts, minister to the service of the church.
One of them will be taken because she enters the wedded state only from a desire to have children, and makes use of her worldly substance to obtain heavenly :
riches;
while she who marries for the sake of carnal enjoy­ ment will be rejected.
But whosoever shall offer their earthly goods to the church or to the poor, in the name of our Lord's redemption, shall have them multiplied.
The two men in the field represent the labourers in the ministry of the church, performing their duties as in the field of God.
The one that shall have published the word of God sincerely will be chosen;
but he that shall have preached Christ im­ perfectly and carelessly will be left.
1These three classes of persons constitute the church, which is divided into two distinct portions-the adopted and the rejected.
For this reason the prophet Ezekiel saw three men delivered-Noah, Daniel, and Job,2 in whom are shadowed the preachers of the gospel, the conti­ nent, and married people.
For Noah guided the ark on the waters, and therefore represents those who govern;
Daniel, retaining the gift of abstinence even at the court of a king, showed how continent men live;
but Job, although united to a wife by the bonds of marriage, and obliged to take care of his own house, pleased God, and thus worthily represents the class of good married people.
To teach that men ought always to pray and not to faint, the Lord spake the parable of the widow who importuned the unjust judge to avenge her of her adversary, and obtained, by incessant supplication and weariness of the judge, what she solicited with such pertinacity.
3
By showing us how the Pharisee and the publican prayed in the temple, he teaches us not to extol our merits, but to confess our sins.
The righteous pray without ceasing that they may be avenged of their enemies, so that all the wicked should perish.
Now the wicked perish in two different ways;
by being converted to righteousness, or in losing by punish­ ment the power to do wrong.
4
The Lord then foretold that be was to be delivered to the Gentiles at Jerusalem, and suffer on the cross ;
and when they were come nigh unto Jericho, he beard the cries of a blind man who sat by the wayside, begging.
Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought unto him;
and as soon as he had learned the request of the blind man, he mercifully restored his sight.
1And as Jesus passed through Jericho, he saw Zac­ cheus, the chief among the publicans, who had climbed up into a tree, and received hospitality at the house of this man, who wished very much to see him.
And when the Jews murmured, saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner, Zaccheus, in the sincerity of his faith, said unto the Lord:
" Behold, Lord, the half my goods I give to the poor;
and if I have taken any­ thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him four­ fold."
And Jesus said unto him:
" This day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abra­ ham.
For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.”
2He then spake the parable of a certain nobleman who went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return, after he bad delivered ten pounds to his servants to trade with.
When he was returned, the first came, saying:
“ Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
This first servant is the order of teachers sent to the circum­ cised ;
he received one pound for the purpose of trade, because he is commanded to preach " one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God."3
Now this same pound bath gained ten pounds, for this reason — that he has, by preaching the word, drawn to him the people living under the law.
When he had been rewarded to his great satisfaction, the second came, saying:
" Lord, thy pound bath gained five pounds."
This servant represents the company of those who were sent to announce the gospel to the uncir­ cumcised, and are deservedly, by a divine decree, placed at the head of those who, through their ministry, are con­ verted to the worship of one God, having mortified the deeds of the flesh.
On the other hand, the servant who, when he was commanded to trade with the money entrusted to him by his master, kept the pound laid up in a napkin, is the figure of those who, although they may be fit persons for preaching the gospel, in obedience to the Lord's commands, through the church, either decline to undertake that duty, or perform it unworthily.
To tie up the money in a napkin, is to conceal the gifts we have received in sloth and uselessness.
By this parable, then we understand that the two faithful servants are th( teachers of both peoples;
that the ten pounds and the five pounds mean believers in God;
that by the wicked servant are represented bad Catholics;
by the enemies, who would not allow the real heir to reign over them, the impiety of those who prefer never to hear the word on truth, or corrupt it by false interpretations.
By reaping where seed had not been sown,1 he means the separation of those who never heard the word of God.
The whole human race that is to appear at the day of judgment, is certainly represented by these five persons.
And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
2St.
John alone mentions that, at the feast of the dedi­ cation, in the winter, the Jews said to Jesus, who was walking in Solomon's porch:
" How long dost thou make us to doubt?
If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly."
Taking advantage of this opportunity of teaching them, he answered:
" I and my Father are one;
" and uttered many other sublime words.
For this reason the Jews, blinded by malice, took up stones to stone him [but he escaped out of their hand].
After this, he went away again be­ yond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized;
and there he abode.
And many resorted unto him, and believed on him there.
3A CERTAIN man, named Lazarus, was sick at Bethany;
and his sisters, Mary and Martha, sent unto Jesus, saying:
“ Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.”
When Jesus heard that, he said:
" This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby."
Then he abode two days in the same place, and after that went into Judea again, and found that Lazarus had lain in the grave four days already.
Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, being strong in faith, went and met him, and said:
" Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
She who loudly lamented the loss of her brother, spoke to our Lord with composure, and after a short conference with Christ, during which she made a true confession of faith, that is to say, acknowledged him to be the Son of God, the life and the resurrection, she called Mary her sister, saying to her in a low voice :
"
The Master is come, and calleth for thee."
Mary arose quickly, and went out of the town to the place where Jesus had stopped;
and when she saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying:
" Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
lIe-an inexhaustible fountain of pity-wept, in the midst of her friends weeping, the death of the friend they had lost;
but his tears caused them ineffable joy.
Jesus, groaning in himself, came to the grave, and commanded them to take away the stone from the mouth, and then, with a loud voice, called him who, in four days, had become putrid:
"Lazarus, come forth."
And straightway he came forth, bound hand and foot with grave- clothes ;
and the Lord immediately ordered his disciples to loose him and let him go.
After the performance of this glorious miracle, which ought to be celebrated to the end of time, they did not all believe in Jesus, but many of the Jews who came to Mary and Martha to comfort them, and saw the unhoped-for resurrection of Lazarus, confessed their belief in Christ.
1
There is no doubt but that the Lord raised several per­ sons from the dead;
however, in the holy Gospel, by reason of a certain mystery, we read of three resurrections only.
By the daughter of the chief of the synagogue, who was re­ stored to life in her fathers house before a small number of witnesses, those sinners are signified, who shut up their sinful propensities within their conscience, and do not suffer them to break out.
These are often raised to spiritual life by a divine influence, which recalls them by secret checks from a de­ raved will.
The son of the widow, who was carried beyond the gates of the city, and restored to life by Christ before a multitude of witnesses, represents those guilty persons, who, after consenting to perpetrate a crime, go forth, and, as it were, draw death from the darkest recesses of their soul;
so that what was hidden in a secret corner, at last appears before the whole world.
Such men are often admo­ nished to their salvation, and restored to life in a divine manner by the remedy of a true conversion, as many know to their great joy.
In Lazarus, already buried, already in a state of putrefaction, we have a figure of those sinners who are fettered with the bonds of depraved habits, to such a degree that wickedness has become so familiar to them, that it does not allow them to become sensible of the heinousness of the sin that they are committing;
for which reason they often excuse the evil they do;
and are already crushed, as it were, under the immense weight of their guilt.
They presume to be angry when they are reproved, and are continually depraved by false praise, while their neighbours, observing them, are also injured.
Lastly, those who, in the opinion of the world, are considered worthy of condemnation, are nevertheless internally vivified by the grace of God, and are afterwards absolved through the agency of the priest.
Or in other words, every man is born in a state of death brought on us by original sin.
The first day of death is that which witnesses his birth;
the second day, when, as he in­ creases in stature, the boy becomes a man;
arriving at years of discretion, he begins to find innately in his own heart the law which naturally teaches men not to do unto others what they would not have others do unto them:
but, unfortu­ nately, they often venture to transgress this law.
The third day of death takes place when the written law is given to man, but this also he despises.
After all Christ came;
brought with him the Gospel, preached the kingdom of heaven, threatened all sinners with the torments of Ge­ henna, but promised eternal life to the righteous.
The Gospel itself is despised, and this is the fourth day of death, as Lazarus lay in the tomb.
Or again, we might say, that the four steps that lead a sinner to destruction, and bring him to the grave in which he decays, are:
firstly, in­ clination of the heart;
secondly, consent;
thirdly, action ;
fourthly, habit.
But the grace of God recalls those who have been removed far from him by sin, and restores to life those who were sinking under the weight of their sins.
When the wonderful miracle of the divine power was published abroad by the reports of many witnesses, who, to satisfy their curiosity, had examined on the spot by what unknown law Lazarus issued from the grave, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council to conspire against Christ;
and when they heard what Caiaphas pro­ phesied, they took counsel together to put him to death.
Jesus, therefore, went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephrem, and there conti­ nued with his disciples.
Now, both the chief priests and their accomplices had given a commandment that if any man knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might take him:
for they were afraid that all men would follow him, and that the Romans would come and take away the kingdom from them.
1Then Jesus, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, and there they made him a supper;
and Martha served, but Lazarus sat at the table.
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard [unguentum nardi pistici], very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair.
Spikenard is a kind of aromatic.
Pistis [πίστις] in Greek, fides in Latin, means faith;
for that reason the ointment is called pisticum, that is to say, faith­ ful, because a corpse, when anointed with it, is preserved from putrefaction.
The house was filled with the odour of the ointment, as the church is perfumed by the good report of a religious life.
When the traitor Judas, who was a thief, and had the bag, smelt the sweet odour with which the house was filled, he was offended, and re­ buked this faithful and devoted woman for what she had done.
But the Lord mildly answered his harsh upbraid­ ings:
" Let her alone, for she bath wrought a good work upon me.
Verily I say unto you, in the whole world shall this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.”
2Many Jews who went to Bethany, drawn thither by their curiosity, saw Lazarus eating at the same table as Christ, and joyfully bore witness to the miracle.
The jealous Pharisees consulted that they might, therefore, put the resuscitated man to death;
but in vain did they endeavour to oppose the almighty power of Christ.
1ON the next day much people who were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jeru­ salem, took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him.
As the hour of his immolation drew nigh, the Lamb of God proceeded towards the spot that was to witness his passion.
When he was come to Bethphage, unto the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent forth two of his disciples, say­ ing :
" Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
loose them, and bring them unto me."
And the disciples went and brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet long before:
“ Behold, thy king cometh unto thee,”—not sitting in a golden chariot arrayed in splendid purple, nor does he mount a fiery steed, to take the lead in discord and strife,—but is sitting upon an ass, that loves tranquillity and peace.
He is not surrounded with glittering swords, but he cometh unto thee, meek;
not to be dreaded for his power, but to be loved for his gentle­ ness.
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ;
others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying:
"Hosanna to the Son of David!
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David!
Hosanna in the highest!"
Some of the Pharisees said unto him, " Master, rebuke thy disciples -" but be answered and said unto them, " I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
2
And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, and, as he foreknew every thing that was to happen, foretold all the ills that threatened it, because it knew not the time of its visitation.
And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying :
“ Who is this ?"
And the multitude said, " This is Jesus, the pro­ phet of Nazareth of Galilee."
Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, saying:
" It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer;
but ye have made it a den of thieyes.”
1
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying, with signs of grateful joy:
"Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were sore displeased, and, filled with bitter envy, they said unto him:
"Hearest thou what these say?"
Jesus answered, "Yea, have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and suck­ lings thou hast perfected praise ?”2And when Jesus had looked round about upon all things, he left these evil-disposed inhabitants of the city, and went out unto Bethany with the twelve, and lodged there.
Now in the morning, as he returned into the city, he hungered, and coming to a fig-tree that stood by the wayside, and finding nothing thereon but leaves only, he cursed it, say­ ing:
"Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever."
And presently the fig-tree withered away!
This tree was the true figure of the synagogue, which had the letter of the law, but bore no fruit.
3
In the temple, they asked him by what authority he did such wonderful things;
but instead of answering their question, he inquired of them whether the baptism of John was from heaven or of men.
Christ by this short question baffled their crafty designs, and stopped their mouths ;
for malice prevented their confessing the truth, that it came from heaven, and they were not bold enough to deny it openly, because they feared the people.
He then laid before them the parable of the two sons, whom their father sent to work in his vineyard;
and who began and ended their day so differently;
for one obeyed the will of his father, not in word, but in deed;
while the other disobeyed him, and showed his contempt of his father's authority not by word of mouth, but by his actions.
1
The Lord also added the parable of the householder which planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
Now these men took the servants whom he had sent to receive the fruits of the vineyard, and beat one, as Jeremiah;
killed another, as Isaiah;
stoned another, as Naboth and Zacharias;
and, lastly, crucified the Son of God.
The servants suc­ cessively sent typify the law, the psalms, and the pro­ phecies ;
by whose teaching men might learn to do right.
But the messengers are beaten and driven away, when the word is despised, or, what is worse, blasphemed.
He who tramples under foot the SOIl of God, and does despite unto the Spirit of grace, kills, as far as he is able, the heir to the vineyard.
When the wicked hus­ bandman is destroyed, the vineyard is given to another;
while the proud lose the gift of grace, the humble receive it.
2
Jesus spake a third parable unto them, of a certain king which made a marriage for his son;
and when they that were bidden to the wedding made light of it, he sent forth his armies, and punished them.
3.
The Pharisees with the Herodians tempted him, by asking if it were lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not.
When they had brought unto him a penny, Jesus answered:
" Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cræsar's, and unto God the things that are God's.”
4The Sadducees also attempted to make him fall into a snare, by describing the case of the woman who had seven husbands, and asking him:
" In the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of them ?
”Jesus answered:
" Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven."
In this manner the good Master inspires the children of the church with confidence, that, at the resurrection, they will enjoy the vision of God, unspotted by corruption.
1
When he was questioned by the doctor of the law as to which was the great commandment in it, he said:
" Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it:
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
On these two com­ mandments bang all the law and the prophets."
He now asked the Pharisees whose son Christ was;
and confounded them, showing them that he was the Lord of David, and thus put them to silence so effectually, that no man " durst, from that day forth, ask him any more questions;
" but now they began openly to take steps to deliver him into the hands of the Romans.
2
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples:
" The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat;
all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;
but do not ye after their works:
for they say and do not.
For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders;
but they them­ selves will not move them with one of their fingers.
But all their works they do to be seen of men;
they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their gar­ ments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi.
But be not ye called Rabbi;
for one is your Master, and all ye are brethren.
And call no man your father upon the earth;
for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Neither be ye called masters;
for one is your Master, even Christ.
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ;
and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, who shut up the kingdom of heaven against men;
for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in."
In this manner Jesus uttered many things for the benefit of mankind, teaching the simple, but confounding the hypocrites.
He spoke of those who swear by the temple, and by the gold that is in the temple;
of the altar, and the gifts that are thereon;
of the divine mercy, which had sent unto them prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and of the cruelty of the Jews, which was exhibited in the various kinds of death which they inflicted upon those who were sent from God.
He mourned over Jerusalem, lamenting, not the buildings, but the inhabitants.
Twice he repeated, in a sorrowful tone:
" 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem!
which slew the prophets, and would not repent of her wickedness.”
1On Jesus departing from the temple, and his disciples pointing to the magnificent buildings, he answered:
" There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, his disciples privately questioned him, as Matthew and Mark affirm, about the time and the signs of this predicted destruction.
To their inquiry as to when the end of the world should be, he answered that many great calamities would come to pass before that day, wars between nation and nation, earthquakes in divers places, pestilences, and famines;
fearful sights from heaven, and great signs.
He foretold many things relating to the per­ secutions they would have to suffer, and to his own coming on the earth;
warning the faithful, when they were delivered up, to take no thought beforehand what they should speak, but in their patience to possess their souls.
He predicted that Jerusalem would be compassed with an army, and then woe unto them that are with child;
that they would fall by the edge of the sword, or be led away captive into all nations;
that there would be signs in heaven;
and that they would see him coming in a cloud with power and great glory. "
Then look up," said he, " for your redemption draweth nigh."
Forbidding drunkenness and the cares of this life, he exhorted them to watch and to pray always.
He rebuked the scribes for their pride, and declared that the widow who threw two mites into the treasury had cast in more than they all.
2
In the parable of the fig-tree, he teaches us how the end of the world will come.
He relates the parables of the ten virgins, and of the householder who left his servants in charge of his goods, and went into a far country;
describes the advent of the Son of man in his glory, and all the holy angels with him;
speaks of the sheep that are to be set on his right hand, separated from the goats that are to be placed on his left;
of the retribution of the wicked, who are to go away into everlasting punishment;
and of the reward of the righteous, who are to go away into life eternal.
1Now, the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him:
"Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Pass­ over?"
And he said unto Peter and John:
" Go ye into the city, to a certain man, whom one bearing a pitcher of water shall point out to you;
follow him into the house where he entereth in, and say ye to the good man of the house:
Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples ?
And he will shew you a large upper room furnished;
there make ready."
And they went forth, and found as he had said unto them;
and they made ready the Passover.
And in the evening, he came with the twelve, and as they sat he said unto them :
"
With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until-it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ”2 According to St. John,3 the supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God and went to God, rose from supper, and laid aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself.
After that, he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
After lie had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them:
" Know ye what I have done to you ?
Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well;
for so I am.
If I, then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet."
And so on, until he says:
"He that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
"Saint Matthew relates that, as his disciples did eat, Jesus said:
" Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say:
" Lord, is it I?"
And be answered and said:
“ He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.”
And, as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said:
" Take, eat;
this is my body."
And taking the cup, he gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying:
" Drink ye all of it;
for this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remis­ sion of sins.
But I say unto you:
I will not drink hence­ forth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
1The Lord, on the night when he was delivered up, prayed three times;
to show us that we should pray to be par­ doned for our past sins, to be protected from present evils, and to be warned against future perils;
addressing all our prayers to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
It is also to be remarked that as the temptation of desire is triple, so is also the temptation of fear:
lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, worldly ambition;
fear of death, fear of shame, fear of pain.
Against all which he teaches us that we ought to fortify ourselves by prayer.
For which reason we understand why the Lord prayed three times on account of the triple temptation of his passion.
That great divine, St. John, relates that Jesus, after he had washed the feet of Peter, who reluctantly submitted, and the other apostles, obscurely pointed out his betrayer by referring to the mysterious prophecies contained in Scrip­ ture, saying:
" He that eateth bread with me will lift up his heel against me."
Afterwards, when he had determined to make him better known, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said:
“Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.”
Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
And Simon Peter beckoned to John, who was leaning on Jesus' bosom, and John asked him:
" Lord, who is it?”
Jesus answered:
"He it is to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it."
And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
And after the sop, Satan entered into him.
Then said Jesus unto him. " That thou doest, do quickly."
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
He then went immediately out;
and it was night.
Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said:
" Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
And many other words of deep meaning spake Jesus, concerning the true love of God and of one's neighbour, the unity of the Tri­ nity, Peter's denying him thrice, and the coming of the Holy Ghost to comfort them;
on the observance of God's com­ mandments, and the rewards prepared for the righteous;
of the persecutions of the faithful, and the inevitable condem­ nation of the wicked;
the dispersion of his disciples;
and his own passion, now nigh at hand.
When Jesus had finished this incomparable discourse, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and audibly addressed a com­ passionate prayer to his Father on behalf of his disciples and all those that should believe in God through their word.
In this prayer the merciful speaker implored his Father to grant us much more than our human frailty would ever presume to ask.
1Then, according to St. Luke, there was a strife among his disciples, which of them should be accounted the greatest;
but their heavenly Teacher recalled them to a sense of humility by his example and sayings.
He thus kindly put a stop to the contention among his weak-minded disciples, declaring that his love for them led him to be their servant.
lie also promised a kingdom to those who had continued with him in his temptations;
and, after further discourse he said to Peter, when rashly boasting:
" Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat;
but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not;
and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
And he said unto him:
" Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death."
Jesus answered:
"I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."
And he said unto them:
" When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything?"
And they said:
" No­ thing."
Then said he unto them:
"But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip;
and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one."
And they said:
" Behold, here are two swords."
And he said:
" It is enough.”1AND when they had sung an hymn, as Matthew and Mark relate, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Then saith Jesus unto them:
" All ye shall be offended because of me this night."
And they came to a place called Gethsemane, which signifies the valley of fat things, or of fatness;
and he saith unto the disciples:
"Sit ye here, and pray, lest ye enter into temptation."
And he taketh with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sore amazed and sorrowful, and very heavy.
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down and prayed, saying:
"Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me;
nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done."
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him;
and being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly;
and his sweat was, as it were, drops of blood, falling down to the ground.
We under­ stand that on the other side of the brook Cedron, there was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
Judas also knew the place;
so, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, he came thither with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said:
“ Hail, master;
and , kissed him."
Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
Then Jesus, as St. John informs us, said unto them:
"Whom seek ye?"
They answered him:
" Jesus of Nazareth."
As soon as be had said:
"I am he," they went backward, and fell to the ground, and so on.
1St. Luke tells us that, when they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him:
" Lord, shall we smite with the sword ?”
Then Peter smote the high priest's servant (Malchus), and cut off his right ear.
Jesus answered their question by saying:
" Suffer ye thus far."
And he immediately added, addressing Peter, who had made use of the sword, as St. Matthew records:
" Put up again thy sword into his place;
for all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve (thousand) legions of angels ?
But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?”
We may add to these words what St. John tells us he said also in this place:
" The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it ? "
Then, as St. Luke says, he touched the ear of Malchus, and healed him.
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes:
"Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves for to take me ?
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
But this is your hour and the power of darkness."
Then all the disciples forsook him and fied.
One young man followed him having a linen cloth cast about his naked body;
and when they laid hold on him, he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
The captain, with his band, and the officers of the Jews, came among the crowd, and they bound our Saviour, and led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, and high priest that same year.
2
But Peter followed him afar off, unto the high priest's palace, and went into the hall, to see the end, and there he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire, for it was cold.
Now this fire was kindled in the midst of the hall, and when the servants had seated themselves round it, Peter placed himself among them.
St. Peter is to be regarded with great veneration for following the Lord in spite of his fear.
It was natural for him to fear;
his follow­ ing his Master was a token of devotion;
his denial, of deceit;
his repentance, of faith.
1
Now the chief priests and all the council sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
but found none, though many false witnesses came.
When Jesus held his peace, the high priest said unto him:
“I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus said unto him:
" Thou hast said."
Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying:
" He hath spoken blasphemy ;
what further need have we of witnesses?
Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
What think ye ? "
They answered:
" He is guilty of death."
Then did they spit in his face, and strike him with the palms of their hands ;
some began to cover his face, others buffeted him, saying:
" Prophesy unto us, thou Christ;
who is he that smote thee ? ”
We understand that the Lord suffered all these things during the night he passed in the house of the chief priest, into which he was first led;
there, also.
Peter was tempted, while all these insults were offered to the Lord.
According to St. Mark, the triple denial of St. Peter was begun before the first crowing of the cock, and finished before the cock crew again.
The three other evan­ gelists relate that, before the first crowing, St. Peter had showed all these signs of grief and fear.
Then Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him:
" Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
And be went out, and wept bitterly.
2
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples and his doctrine.
Jesus answered him:
" I spake openly to the world, I plainly taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort;
and in secret have I said nothing.
Why askest thou me ?
Ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them;
behold, they know what I said."
And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his band, saying:
“Answerest thou the high priest so?"
Jesus answered him :
“
If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil;
but if well, why smitest thou me ? " Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
1When the morning was come, as Matthew relates,2 all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death;
and when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
St. Luke3 has given an account of what happened to our Lord about dawn, when the men that held him mocked him and smote him;
and when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face;
and many things blasphemously spake they against him.
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief priests, and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying:
" If thou art the Christ, tell us."
And be said unto them :
"
If I tell you, ye will not believe ;
and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God."
Then said they all:
" Art thou, then, the Son of God?"
And he said unto them:
“Ye say that I am."
And they said:
"What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth."
And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
Luke has recounted these circumstances;
but Matthew and Mark have related all that befell our Lord until morning;
afterwards they return to their account of Peter's denial;
and when this is finished, they go back to what took place early in the morning, and continue their narrative of all that happened to our Saviour from that time.
St. John4 says:
then led they Jesus to Caiaphas,5 unto the hall of judgment [praetorium] :
and it was early;
and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the passover.
But the base crowds assembled there, bringing the Lord with them, as if he were already convicted, and, with the con­ sent of Caiaphas, to whom it had before appeared expedient that Jesus should die, no delay was allowed to intervene before he was delivered to Pilate to be condemned.
St. Matthew1 is the only evangelist who mentions the death of the traitor Judas, which he does in these words:
" Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying:
‘I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.'
And they said, ‘What is that to us ? see thou to that.'
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver pieces, and said:
‘ It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.'
And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
Wherefore that field is called, ' Acel­ dama,’ that is, the field of blood, unto this day.
Then was fulfilled all that had been foretold long before."
2And now the holy evangelists take pains to describe, in regular order, all that happened to our Lord before Pilate;
.
facts which the studious reader ought himself to investigate with diligence, and put each in its proper place.
During the passion of Christ, many things were said, and many questions answered, as Augustine, bishop of Hippo, judi­ ciously remarks, in the third book of his work, called:
“The Harmony of the Evangelists," from which each of the holy writers selected what seemed to him expedient, and inserted in his history what, in his judgment, sufficed.
Matthew relates that Jesus stood before the governor, who, asking him if he were the king of the Jews, he answered:
". Thou sayest."
Pilate then went out, as we read in the gospel according to St. John, to those who would not enter the judgment-hall, and said:
" What accusation bring you against this man?"
They answered:
" If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee."
Then said Pilate unto them:
" Take ye him, and judge him according to your law."
The Jews said unto him:
“It is not lawful for us to put any man to death."
Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him :
"Art thou the king of the Jews ? " Jesus answered:
" Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me ? ”
Pilate answered:
“Am I a Jew ?
Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me.
What hast thou done ? "
Jesus answered:
" My kingdom is not of this world;
if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews;
but now is my kingdom not from hence."
Pilate therefore said unto him :
"
Art thou a king, then ? "
Jesus answered:
" Thou sayest that I am a king.
To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.
Every one that is of the truth heareth my voiced Pilate saith unto him :
"
What is truth ? "
And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them:
" I find in him no fault at all."
Then, as Luke relates, the Jews, becoming furious, began to accuse him, saying:
" We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a king."
And when, as Matthew says, he was accused of the chief priests and elders of the people, he answered nothing;
so great was his meekness!
Then said Pilate unto him:
“Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?”
And he answered him never a word;
insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
When Pilate was sat down on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying:
" Have thou nothing to do with that just man;
for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
St. Luke writes that, when Pilate said:
“ I find no fault in this man," the Jews were the more fierce, saying:
“ He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place."
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean;
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's juris­ diction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad;
for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
Then he questioned with him in many words;
but he answered him nothing.
And the chief priests and scribes stood, and vehemently accused him.
And Herod, with his men of war, set him at naught, and arrayed him in a white robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together, for before they were at enmity between themselves.
And Pilate, when he had called together the rulers and the people, said unto them:
“Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people;
and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in him, touching those things whereof ye accuse him.
No, nor yet Herod;
for I sent you to him, and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
I will therefore chastise him and release him."
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
Therefore, when they were gathered together, he said unto them:
" Whom will ye that I release unto you ?
Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ ? "
But the chief priests persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Now Barabbas was a notable prisoner, who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
The governor said unto them:
" Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? "
They said:
"Barabbas."
Pilate saith unto them:
“What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ ? ” They all said unto him :
"
Let him be crucified.”
And the governor said:
“ Why ?
what evil bath he done ? "
But they cried out the more, saying:
" Let him be crucified."
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the mul­ titude, saying:
" I am innocent of the blood of this just person;
see ye to it."
Then answered all the people:
" His blood be on us, and on our children."
Then released he Barabbas unto them, and took Jesus, and scourged him."
St. John informs us, that the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, and coming up to him, said:
" Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they smote him with their hands.
Pilate went forth again, and saith unto them:
" Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.”
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe.
And Pilate saith unto them:
" Behold the man !”
When the chief priests, there­ fore, and officers saw him, they cried out, saying:
" Crucify him, crucify him."
Pilate saith unto them:
" Take ye him, and crucify him;
for I find no fault in him.”
The Jews answered him:
" We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
When, therefore, Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
and went again into the judgment-hall, and saith unto Jesus:
"Whence art thou?"
But Jesus gave him no answer.
Pilate therefore said unto him:
“Speakest thou not unto me ?
Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee ? "
Jesus answered:
" Thou couldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above;
therefore, he that bath delivered me unto thee bath the greater sin."
From thence­ forth Pilate sought to release him;
but the Jews cried out, saying:
“If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's friend:
whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cæsar.”WHEN Pilate, therefore, heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, •" Gabbatha."
And it was the preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour;
and he saith unto the Jews:
" Behold your king! "
But they cried out:
" Away with him, away with him, crucify him."
Pilate saith unto them:
“ Shall I crucify your king ? ”
The chief priests answered:
“ We have no king but Cresar.”
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified.
1Such is the account John gives us of what Pilate said and did;
things that Matthew and Mark, omitting at first, afterwards recollected.
Thus Matthew says:
“Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band;
and they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand;
and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying:
" Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe (or the purple, accord­ ing to St. Mark) off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.
John relates that Jesus, " bearing his cross, went forth into a place called Golgotha," or Mount Calvary. "
And they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus," a fact mentioned by three evangelists;
" and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it" to the place just named.
They crucified Jesus in Golgotha, between two malefac­ tors, and gave him wine mingled with myrrh;
and set up over his head his accusation written:
" This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”
And this title was written in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew.
2
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part;
and also his coat:
now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
They said therefore among them­ selves :
"
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be;
" that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith:
" They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots."
3The rulers and the scribes railed on him as he hanged on the cross, wagging their heads, and saying:
“Ah!
thou that destroyest the temple of God, and buildest it in three days, save thyself.
4
If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
"We learn from Luke that one of the malefactors which were hanged, railed on him, saying:
" If thou be Christ, save thyself and us."
But the other rebuked him, saying :
"Dost thou not fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds;
but this man bath done nothing amiss."
And he said unto Jesus:
"Lord, remember me, when thou comest into thy kingdom."
And Jesus said unto him:
“Verily I say unto thee:
To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”
1Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Mag­ dalene.
When Jesus, therefore, saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother:
" Woman, behold thy son."
Then saith he to the disciple:
"Behold thy mother.”
And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own horned
From the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying:
" Eli, Eli, lama-zababdani ?" that is to say:
" My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me ? ”
After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith:
“I thirst."
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar;
and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, according to Luke, he said:
" Father, into the hands I commend my spirit."
3At last, according to John, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said:
"It is finished;
” and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ;
and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
and the graves were opened;
and many bodies of the saints which slept, arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Now when the centurion and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying:
" Truly this was the Son of God."
And many women which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him, stood afar off;
among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
1
When the even was come, Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, a good man and a just, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews), went boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus ;
and the governor, when he knew of the centurion that he was already dead, gave Joseph leave to take it.
Joseph came, therefore, and took the body of Jesus, and having bought fine linen, he wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre.
And there came also Nicodemus, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, hewn out of a rock, wherein was never man yet laid.
There laid they Jesus, therefore, because of the Jews' preparation day;
for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.
The women, whose names we have already mentioned, and whose affection for him was the most ardent, sat over against the sepulchre, and beheld where he was laid.
2Now the next day, the priests and Pharisees falsely reported to Pilate some of the words of the Lord, and having obtained his consent, they sealed the stone, and placed soldiers all round to keep watch over the sepulchre.
3WE read in the evangelical narrative an account of several circumstances which took place at the resurrection of our Lord, which would appear to be irreconcileable, unless the order in which they happened is carefully con­ sidered.
It may, therefore, be well to consult what Augus­ tine, an enlightened commentator on the holy Scriptures, says upon this subject, in the third book of his " Harmony of the Evangelists," which I shall quote in his own words.
Thus, after discussing several questions, be makes this de­ claration :
"
I will endeavour, by God's help, to collect in one continuous narration all the facts immediately con­ nected with our Lord's resurrection, according to the testimonies of the several evangelists, so far as they can be arranged."
1They all agree in the coming [of the women] to the sepulchre, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week;
before which, however, the facts which Matthew alone relates bad occurred, viz., the great earthquake, the rolling back of the stone, the consternation of the keepers, some of whom lay near the spot like dead men.
According to John, Mary Magdalene came, no doubt with the other women who ministered to our Lord, but her affection for him was more ardent;
and therefore, with good reason, John makes particular mention of her, passing over in silence the names of those who, according to the statements of the other evangelists, were with her.
She came, therefore, and when she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre, before she had examined anything attentively, not doubting that the body of Jesus was removed, as John tells us, she ran to announce to himself, as well as to Simon Peter, what she had seen.
This John was the disciple whom Jesus loved.
And they both began to run towards the sepulchre, and John, coming first to the place, stooped down, and saw the linen clothes lying, yet went he not in.
Then cometh Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, and the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrap­ ped together in a place by itself.
Then John went in also, and saw and believed what Mary had said, that they had taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre ;
for as yet they knew not the scripture, that be must rise again from the dead.
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping, that is to say, before the spot where the tomb had been hewn out of the rock, although within the space where the women bad already entered.
Now in that place there was a garden, as John informs us.
They then saw on their right hand the angel who had rolled back the stone from the door of the sepulchre ;
and was sitting upon it.
Of this angel Matthew and Mark speak in the following terms:
“ Then said be unto the women:
‘ Fear not ye:
for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here;
for be is risen, as he said.
Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead;
and, behold he goeth before you into Galilee;
there shall ye see him:
lo, I have told you.’”
What Mark relates does not differ from Matthew's narra­ tive.
As Mary wept on hearing these words, she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre, and, as John informs us, “ saw two angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
They say unto her:
‘ Woman, why weepest thou?'
She saith unto them:
‘ Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.'"
We must understand that the angels had risen, and that they were seen standing, as Luke mentions, when they said to the women who were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth:
" Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
he is not here, but is risen.
Remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be cru­ cified, and the third day rise again."
And they remembered his words.
1After this, Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, as John tells us, and knew not that it was Jesus.
Jesus saith unto her :
"
Woman, why weepest thou?
Whom seekest thou?"
She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him:
" Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."
Jesus saith unto her:
" Mary.”
She turned herself, and saith unto him :
"Rabboni," which is to say, " Master.”
Jesus saith unto her:
“ Touch me not;
for I am not yet ascended to my Father;
but go to my brethren, and say unto them :
‘ I ascend unto my Father, and your Father;
and to my God, and your God.' ”
She then departed from the sepulchre, that is to say, the place where the garden lay before the cave in the rock, ac­ companied by the other women, who, as Mark informs us, “ trembled, and were amazed, neither said they anything to any man."
And as they went, behold, Jesus met them, saying :
" All hail."
And they came, and clung to his feet, and worshipped him.
From these statements we gather, that, during their visit to the tomb, they were twice addressed by the angels, as well as by the fjord himself;
that is to say, the first time when Mary supposed him to be the gardener, and afterwards when Jesus came to meet them in the way.
By appearing twice before these women, lie confirmed their faith, and allayed their fears.
He then said unto them:
" Be not afraid;
go, tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me."
Mary Magdalene, therefore, came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her;
and not only unto her, but also to the other women who are mentioned in the gospel of Luke.
They told these things unto the eleven disciples, and to all the rest;
and their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
Mark attests these facts.
Indeed, after he has described the state of these women, who went out of the sepulchre trembling and amazed to such a degree that they did not say anything to any man;
he adds that, when the Lord was risen he appeared first-early the first day of the week-to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils;
and that she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept, who, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
Matthew inserts this additional circumstance in his narrative, that, after the departure of the women who had seen and heard all these things, some of the watch, who had fallen to the ground as dead men, came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done, that is to say, all that they had seen and known.
When the priests were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large bribes unto the soldiers to induce them to say that his disciples had stolen him away while they slept;
promising at the same time to secure them from the anger of the governor, who had placed them there to guard the tomb.
The soldiers took the money, and did as they were taught;
and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
Luke is the only evangelist who does not say that our Saviour appeared to the women, but only the angels.
Now Matthew asserts that Jesus met them on their return from the sepulchre.
Mark also assures us, as well as John, that he appeared first to Mary Magda­ lene, but does not tell us how he appeared to her, while John explains this.
1
As the four evangelists agree, in their faithful narratives, on all that the Almighty Emmanuel did before his passion;
so they relate, in harmony with each other, his resurrection and ascension, and inform us that the Lord was seen by mortal eyes on ten occasions after he had risen from the dead :
once by the women at the sepulchre ;
again, by these same women in the way as they returned from the tomb;
the third time he appeared to Simon Peter;
and if the evan­ gelist has not informed us when or where the meeting took place, he plainly declares that it did occur.
The fourth time, he appeared to the two disciples who were going to a village called Emmaus, but in another form, that they might not know him ;
he accompanied them in the way as a traveller, and inquired of them the cause of their sadness and of their complaints.
When he heard the lamentation of Cleopas concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how they delivered him to be condemned to death, he gently reproved them for being slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken;
and beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them the Scrip­ tures.
And they constrained him to accept of their hospitality;
and, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
And while he was breaking the bread, he opened their eyes, that they might know him;
and as soon as they had recognized him, he vanished out of their sight.
His fifth appearance was at Jerusalem when several of the disciples were assem­ bled in the evening, as Luke and John inform us, but Thomas was not among them.
Jesus entered the place, although they had shut the doors ["for fear of the Jews"], shewed unto them his hands and his side, took a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb, and did eat before them.
He then breathed on them, and said unto them:
"Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
The sixth time that he appeared was after eight days, when Thomas saw him, and said:
“ My Lord and my God."
The seventh time he shewed himself at the Sea of Tiberias, when seven of his disciples, who were fishing, saw him in the morning, after a night's toil, and ate bread and fish with him on the shore, after the miraculous draught of 153 fishes.
The eighth time he appeared on a mountain in Galilee, according to Matthew ;
and when they saw him they worshipped him, but some doubted.
He then said unto them:
" All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you;
and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."
His ninth visit, Mark tells us, was when he appeared for the last time unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart.
It is called the last time, because they were not to be with him any longer on the earth.
His tenth appear­ ance, as we read in the narrative of Mark and Luke, took place on the same day:
the disciples saw him not here below, but as he was ascending into heaven, taken up in a cloud.
Such was the number of times, that our Saviour is said in the writings of the evangelists, to have been seen of man before he ascended into heaven;
that is to say, nine times on earth, and once as he rose through the air;
but, as John says, all his acts are not recorded.
And, indeed, they had many opportunities of being in company with him during the forty days that preceded his ascension, although he did not remain with them throughout the whole time.
John informs us that, between the first day of his resurrection and his next appearance, there was an interval of eight days.
In this manner, appearing during those forty days, as often as he would, to whom he would, and as he would, he confirmed his disciples in the belief of his resurrection.
1MARK and Luke mention our Lord's two last appear­ ances, and relate all that was said and done.
We read in Mark that he upbraided the doubtful, for their hardness of heart, but said unto those who were strong in the faith:
" Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
but he that believeth not shall be damned.
And these signs shall follow them that believe;
in my name shall they cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them;
they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
So then after the Lord Jesus had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
Moreover Luke at the end of his Gospel says :
"
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven."
2 Again in the opening chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, he speaks of the ascension in these words :
"
And being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusa­ lem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, 'ye have heard of file;
for John truly baptized with water,.
but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.'
When they, therefore, were come together, they asked of him, saying:
' Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel
And he said unto them :
‘
It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father bath put in his own power, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you;
and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.'
And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, which also said:
'Te men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven ?
this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.’
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath-day's journey."
There, as Luke testi­ fies, these faithful disciples rejoiced greatly in the triumph of their heavenly Master, continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, both in the temple and in an upper room, and waited with confidence for the promise of the Father, as Jesus had commanded them.
1
All that they had heard him say was fully proved to them by the miracles which they saw performed before their own eyes.
And, indeed, as they had often heard from his own lips that he should have to endure the most cruel sufferings during his passion, and that he should rise again in triumph on the third day;
now they rejoiced to see the immortal Giver of life overcome the sharpness of death, and triumph because he is exalted above the heavens, and sits at the right hand of the Father.
Angels also appeared in white apparel, and, addressing the men of Galilee, while filled with admiration they looked steadfastly toward heaven, pointed out to them the great joy both of angels and of men, and announced that Jesus would re-appear at the end of the world to judge all nations.
2Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James, who remained with the Lord Jesus unto the end, were called by him the salt of the earth and the light of the world ;
and justly so, for they despised this world, in order to follow his steps, and were rewarded by being appointed by God rulers and judges of the earth.
When this venerable company was returned to Jerusalem, Peter, who was the first called and the greatest in dignity among the apostles, stood up in the midst of the disciples, who were about an hundred and twenty in number.
He began his address to them by speaking of the fate of the traitor Judas, who, having hung himself between heaven and earth, burst asunder in the midst, and his bowels gushed out because he was unworthy of a place in either;
this happened after he had purchased with the reward for betraying Christ, a field called “Aceldalna,” that is to say, The field of blood.
He then reminded them that they were, as David had foretold, to ordain another apostle in his room, that he might take part in this heavenly ministry and apostleship.
All, there­ fore, adopted the proposal of their president, and in order to complete the sacred number of the apostles they appointed two, Joseph, surnamed Justus, and Matthias;
and they gave forth their lots,, after Peter had offered up a prayer, which the rest confirmed, and the lot falling upon Matthias, he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
1
These twelve apostles represent the hours of the day, and the twelve months of the entire year, and bad been often signified long before in dark sayings of the prophets and patriarchs.
They are held in reverence by all the nations of the faithful, and justly regarded as the senators of heaven, and the glorious princes of the church;
because they are grafted as fruitful branches into Christ, the true vine.
In the Lord's field, they faithfully followed his steps among men, more especially by voluntary poverty;
and having, as companions and partakers of the same mysteries, shone with the effulgence of miraculous powers, they now sit together on celestial thrones, the righteous judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.
And as, while they were on earth, they had without ceasing contended for the prize set before them, and indefatigably laboured in the church, as Christ's faithful vicars and witnesses, so now they shine as his blessed co-heirs in heaven.
XXI.
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, and the faithful disciples were all with one accord in one place, at the third hour of the day, suddenly there came a sound from heaven, and the Holy Ghost descended in the form of tongues, like as of fire, and sat upon each of them, filling them with all wisdom and heavenly gifts.
0 how quick and skilful is the heavenly Artificer, the sweet and vivifying helper of those souls which desire his unction!
This celestial fire, which did not consume, but illumine, came down to inflame fully the hearts of the disciples, and free them from the attractions of carnal pleasures, and from the dread of punishment.
It suddenly taught them to speak with other tongues, strengthened their minds by authority, and raised them to the summit of virtue, against all the wiles of the enemy.
The apostles spake of the wonderful works of God in divers tongues, so that strangers out of every nation under heaven were amazed that these Galileans, who had never quitted their native land, should speak so fluently in every language.
The Jews, full of envy, and confounded by this miracle, and accustomed as they were to put a wrong construction upon the words and works of Christ, asserted that these men, who were showing forth the mighty works of God, were full of new wine, which made them talk like madmen.
But Peter, who was indeed intoxicated with spiritual drink, rose up against these perfidious men, spoke to them the words of saving wisdom, treated eloquently of the in­ carnation, the passion, and the resurrection of Christ, and, with the help of the Holy Spirit, confounded the multitude of the malicious.
As he had once smitten with the sword Malchus, and had cut off the ear of this servant of the high priest, so with the spiritual word of God he pierced the hearts of those who were carnally slaves to the letter of the Mosaic law, and commanded the neophytes to banish from their minds the recollection of the ancient ceremonies and observances.
These same Jews who, shortly before, had so cruelly persecuted the Messiah to death, were exhorted by St. Peter, in a fervent address, to repent and to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ;
and as he had been hitherto accustomed to take fish from the sea by means of his net, so now, by performing the sacred duties of a preacher, he drew the wandering sinner from the depths of ignorance, to set his feet on the solid ground of faith.
In one day he baptized three thousand of those who were converted, and, putting on the new man, had cast off the old things of a carnal life.
1AND now, by God's help, I have compiled a plain narrative of all that passed from the birth of Christ to the coming of the Holy Ghost the Comforter;
and have collected and briefly arranged our Lord's miracles from the writings of the evan­ gelists, as well as my feeble powers enabled me, or I have gained from the accounts given by the fluent Augustine and other doctors of the church.
I have endeavoured in this work to be useful to my fellow creatures and to myself;
wishing especially to be of some service to those who dis­ like the perusal of those learned and extensive works;
for which purpose I have collected the accounts of our Lord's miracles, which are spread over four books, and comprised them within the limits of a small volume.
Moreover, I have generally been anxious to adopt the very words 1 found in the authentic books;
and although, for brevity's sake, I have been frequently compelled to alter their language, yet I have made every effort to arrive at the precise truth, and have never voluntarily deviated from received opinions.
And now, purposing to continue this history, in order that the reader may clearly understand the chronology, I shall insert some information, which the ancient fathers have given upon the subject in their works.
For Eusebius of Cesarea, St. Jerome, who understood three languages, the Spanish philosophers Orosius and Isidore of Seville, and several others, have written at large on the course of former events, and especially Beda, the priest, in his book entitled, "De Temporibus.”
1
He is the latest2 of the English writers, and carefully studied to imitate the style of the ancients.
TIBERIUS, the step-son of Octavianus Augustus, being the SOIl of Livia his wife by a former husband, reigned twenty-three years.
In the twelfth year of his reign, he sent Pilate into Judea, as procurator of that province.
Herod the tetrarch, when he had been in possession of this prin­ cipality twenty-four years, founded the cities of Tiberias and Libias, in honour of the emperor Tiberius and his mother Livia.
3
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cresar, our Lord Jesus, after his baptism, as was foretold by St. John, preached the kingdom of heaven to the world, four thousand years after the creation, according to the Hebrews, as is proved by Eusebius, in his Chronicles;
we must here notice that the fifteenth year of Tiberius corresponds with the com­ mencement of the eighty-first Jubilee among the Jews, if we consult these same Chronicles, which Eusebius himself compiled, as he thought best, from the two editions extant,4 we find five thousand, two hundred, and twenty-eight years.
In the eighteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, our Lord redeemed the world by his passion, and rising again victoriously from the dead on the third day, showed himself openly to his faithful disciples, and on the fortieth day ascended into heaven before their eyes.
Agrippa, surnamed Herod, whose father was Aristobulus, son of King Herod, went to Rome, to impeach Herod the tetrarch, but was thrown into prison by order of Tiberius,1 where he made himself many friends, especially Caius (Caligula), son of Germanicus.
Caius, surnamed Caligula, reigned three years, ten months, and eight days.
He gave the kingdom of Judea to his friend Herod Agrippa, whom he had liberated from confinement.
This prince held the sceptre for the space of seven years, that is to say, until the fourth year of the reign of Claudius, when "the angel of the Lord smote him,” and his son Agrippa [II.] succeeded in the government, and reigned twenty-six years, until the extermination of the Jews.
He, as well as Herod the tetrarch, was persuaded by Herodias to go to Rome, to conciliate the friendship of Caligula, but being there accused by Agrippa, he lost even his tetrarchate, and escaping by flight into Spain, with Herodias, died there of grief.
Pilate, who had pronounced sentence of death on Christ, received so many affronts from Caligula, that he killed himself with his own hand.
This emperor, to honour his gods, polluted the holy places of the Jews, by placing in them these impure idols.
2Claudius governed the empire thirteen years, eight months, and nineteen days.
He himself, in the fourth year of his reign, during a dreadful famine, of which St. Luke makes mention in the Acts of the Apostles, passed over into Britain, where no army had dared to land either before or after Julius Cæsar, and, without fighting any battles or shedding blood, within the space of a few days, received the proffered submission of the greater part of the island.
He also added the Orkney Islands to the Roman empire, and returned to his capital, whence he had been absent alto­ gether somewhat less than six months.
In the ninth year of his government, he drove the rebellious Jews out of Rome, as we read in the Acts of St. Luke.
In the following year a dire famine afflicted the Romans.
1Nero filled the imperial throne for the space of thirteen years, seven months, and twenty-eight days.
In his second year, Festus succeeded Felix as procurator of Judea, and sent Paul in chains to Rome.
Albinus succeeded Festus in the government of Judea, and was followed by Gessius Florus.
The Jews were not long able to bear the dissolute manners, the avarice, and the other vices of Florus;
for which reason they rebelled against the Romans.
Vespasian was sent against them at the head of an army, and took several of their towns.
Nero's greatest crime, and he committed many, was his having given the order for the first persecu­ tion of the Christians, the most distinguished leaders of whom he commanded to be put to death at Rome;
St. Peter was crucified, and St. Paul fell by the sword.
This emperor did not venture to undertake any wars, and was very near losing Britain ;
for during his government, two towns of great importance were captured and destroyed.
2
Vespasian held the reins of government for the space of nine years, eleven months, and twenty-two days.
He was in Juden when lie was proclaimed emperor by the army, and, leaving the direction of the war to his son Titus, he returned to Rome by the way of Alexandria, and, after the murder of Vitellius, took possession of the throne.
Titus, within the space of two years, overthrew the kingdom of Judea, and razed the temple to the ground one thousand and eighty-four years after its first erection.
This war was terminated in four years;
it was carried on for two years during the life of Nero, and was continued for two years after his death.
Vespasian, among other great actions while he was yet a subject, signalized himself in Germany, and afterwards in Great Britain, whither he had been sent by Claudius, and where he fought thirty-two pitched battles with the enemy ;
he added to the Roman empire two powerful nations, twenty towns and the Isle of Wight on the coast of Britain.
It was during his reign that the colossus [of Rhodes] was erected;
its height was a hundred and seven feet.
'The emperor Titus reigned two years and two months;
a man whose character was so admirable on account of his being endowed with every virtue, that be was called the love and delight of mankind.
He completed the amphitheatre at Rome, when five thousand animals were killed at the dedication.
2Domitian, the younger brother of Titus, governed the empire fifteen years and five months.
He commenced the second persecution of the Christians, Nero's being the first, and shortly afterwards received his reward for thus fighting against God, being slain in the senate-housedNerva held the imperial sceptre one year, four months, and eight days.
His first edict recalled all those who were banished.
The apostle St. John regained his liberty by this general amnesty, and took advantage of it to return to Ephesus.
2Trajan filled the throne nineteen years, six months, and fifteen days.
He began the third persecution of the Chris­ tians, and ordered the most eminent servants of God to be tortured to death.
Pliny the younger, born at Como, lived during this reign ;
he is regarded as a great orator and his­ torian :
many of his works, proofs of his remarkable talent, are still extant.
The Pantheon at Rome, built by Domitian, was destroyed by lightning;
it was so named, because it was consecrated as the temple of all the gods.
The Jews, who excited seditions in every part of the world, were slaughtered in great numbers, a punishment they deserved.
This emperor extended far and wide the bounds of the Roman empire, which, since the time of Augustus, had been rather defended than added to by any remarkable conquest.
3Hadrian, cousin of Trajan, reigned twenty-one years.
Being enlightened by the books written on the Christian religion by Quadratus, a disciple of the apostles and bishop of Athens, Aristides, an Athenian full of faith and wisdom, and Serenus Granianus, proconsul [of Asia], he wrote a letter commanding that the Christians should not be condemned unless accusations were preferred against them.
This emperor subdued a second time and finally, with great slaughter, the Jews who had again rebelled;
he even deprived them of the permission to enter Jerusalem, which he care­ fully rebuilt, and surrounded with walls;
commanding that it should be called Ælia, after his own name.
Being perfect master both of Greek and Latin, he founded at Athens a library of admirable architecture.
Mark was the first gentile bishop of Jerusalem;
those who preceded him having been all Jews.
Their names were:
James the brother of our Lord, Simeon the son of Cleophas, Justus, Zaccheus, Tobias, Sixtus (Benjamin), John, Matthias, Philip, Seneca, another Justus, Levi, Effrem, Joseph, and Judas.
These bishops, fifteen in number, who were of the circumcision, governed the Christian church at Jerusalem, from the time of our Lord's passion until the reign of Ælius Hadrian, a space of nearly one hundred and seven years;
rendering themselves illustrious by their sanctity, their faith, and their learning.
Their successors of gentile origin, were Mark, Cassianus, Publius, Maximus, Julian, Caius, another Julian, Capiton, Valens, Dolician, Narcissus, Alexander, Maza­ banes, Hymenæas, Zabdas, Hermon, Macharius, another Maximus, Cyrill, and John.
1Antoninus, surnamed Plus, with his two sons, by adoption, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius (Verus), reigned twenty-two years and three months.
Justin the philosopher presented to Antoninus a book he wrote in favour of the Christian religion, which induced the emperor to treat the Christians with kindness.
Not long after, however, he lost his life for Christ's sake, during the persecution excited by Crescens the Cynic, in the time of Pope Pius I. Hermes wrote a book entitled, " The Pastor, which contains the precept of an angel, that Easter should be kept on the Lord's day.
Polycarp, on his arrival at Rome, reclaimed from their heresy many who had been recently corrupted by the doctrines of Valentine and Cerdo.
1Marcus Antoninus Verus, and his brother [by adoption] Lucius Aurelius Commodus, reigned nineteen years and two months.
The government was now for the first time administered by them jointly, hitherto there having been ,sole emperors.
They afterwards made war against the Parthians with distinguished courage and success.
During the persecution of the Christians in Asia, Polycarp and Pionius suffered martyrdom.
In Gaul, also, Pothinus, bishop of Lyons, and several other Christians gloriously shed their blood for Christ.
Not long after, the plague, that avenger of crime, depopulated many provinces of the Roman empire, above all Italy, and Rome itself.
On the demise of his brother Commodus, Antoninus took his own son Commodus as his colleague in the government.
Melito, bishop of Sardis, in Asia, wrote an apology for the Christians, ad­ dressed to the emperor Antoninus.
Lucius, king of Britain, sent a letter to Eleutherius, bishop of Rome, soliciting admission into the Christian church.
Apollinaris of Hiera­ polis in Asia, and Dionysius of Corinth, are ranked amongst the most illustrious bishops of this age.
1After the death of his father, Lucius Antoninus Com­ modus reigned thirteen years.
He was successful in his war with the Germans.
In all other respects he did not inherit his father's virtues, being addicted to every species of debauchery.
Irenæus, bishop of Lyons at this time, had gained great celebrity.
The emperor Commodus having ordered the head of the Colossus to be taken off, replaced it by one taken from his own statue.
2Helvius Pertinax reigned only six months;
he was assas­ sinated by Didius Julian, who, after a reign of only seven months, was vanquished and killed, during the civil war, by Severus, near the Milvian bridge.
Victor, bishop of Rome, by a decree which was widely dispersed, ordered the feast of Easter to be celebrated, as his predecessor Eleu­ therius had done, on the Sunday between the 14th and the 21st day of March, which was then reckoned the first month of the year.
Theophilus, bishop of Cæsarea, in Palestine, adopted this decree, and in conjunction with other bishops, present at a council, wrote a synodical and valuable epistle, against those who .
persisted in cele- brating this festival like the Jews, on the fourteenth day of the March moon.
1Severus Pertinax held the reins of government for seven­ teen years, firmly, but not without difficulty.
He ordered a cruel persecution of the Christians.
Clemens, a priest of the church of Alexandria, and Pantænus, a stoic philo­ sopher, distinguished themselves by their theological dis­ cussions.
Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, Theophilus of Cæsarea, Polycarp and Bacchiolus, Asiatic bishops, were also illustrious.
In different parts of the empire, a great number of Christians received the crown of martyrdom.
Clodius Albinus, who bad assumed the title of Cæsar in Gaul, having been slain near Lyons, Severus transferred the war into Britain.
In order to secure the conquered provinces from the incursions of the barbarians, he ordered a wide ditch to be dug, and a very strong wall to be raised;
which was.
additionally fortified, at unequal distances, by a number of towers:
these works very nearly extended from sea to sea, being about one hundred and thirty-two thousand paces long.
This emperor died at York.
2Antoninus, surnamed Caracalla, the son of Severus, reigned about seven years.
Alexander, bishop of Cappa­ docia, having gone to Jerusalem, drawn thither by his desire of visiting the holy places, during the lifetime of Narcissus, bishop of that city, who had attained a very great age, he was 'ordained to succeed him, the Lord having, by re­ velation, suggested this choice.
Tertullian, an African, soil of a proconsular centurion, is celebrated in all the churches.
1Macrinus reigned one year, and was massacred near Archelais, during a mutiny of the soldiers, as well as his SOil Diadumenianus, who had assisted him in usurping the throne.
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus reigned four years.
The town of Nicopolis, in Palestine, before called Emmaüs, was founded during this recess ;
Julius Africanus, a writer of that day, having successfully promoted the building.
Emmaüs is the place which our Lord vouchsafed to sanctify with his presence, after his resurrection, as we read in the gospel of St. Luke.
Bishop Hippolytus, the author of many works, has brought down to this period the chronological canon which he composed.
He tells us that, by finding the return of Easter to the same day, after the lapse of a certain number of years, he furnished Eusebius with the idea of his paschal cycle.
2Aurelius Alexander reigned thirteen years.
His singular love for his mother Mammæa gained him the affection of .
every one.
Urban, bishop of Rome, brought over to the Christian faith, and led to martyrdom, a great number of persons belonging to noble families.
Origen of Alexandria gained so great a reputation throughout the world, that Mammæa, the mother of Alexander, wished to hear him, and having invited him to Antioch, loaded him with honours.
1Maximinus reigned three years.
He directed a violent persecution against the priests of the churches, the clergy, and doctors, the principal motive for which was the hatred he bore to the Christian family of Alexander, his predecessor, and his mother Mammæa;
and more especially on account of Origen the priest.
2 Pontianus and Anterus, bishops of Rome, received the crown of martyrdom, and were interred in the cemetery of Callistus.
3Gordian reigned six years.
Julius Africanus holds a con­ spicuous place among ecclesiastical writers.
He relates in the Chronicles he wrote, that he hastened to Alexandria, attracted by the widely-spread reputation of Heraclea, of whom fame spoke as very learned in divinity, philosophy, and all the knowledge of the Greek school.
1Philip, with his son of the same name, governed the empire for the space of seven years.
He was the first emperor who embraced Christianity, after having lent an attentive ear to the exhortations of that faithful soldier of Christ, Pontius.
The third year of his reign witnessed the completion of the year one thousand from the foundation of Rome.
The doors of the pagan temples having been closed, the holy church freely opened hers with joy for the celebration of God's praise;
and this year, more august than any that had preceded it, was kept with magnificent games by a Christian emperor.
Origen, son of the martyr Leo­ nidas, instructed in the divine philosophy of Christianity, at Cæsarea of Palestine, two young brothers, Theodore surnamed Gregory, and Athenodore, who afterwards became illustrious bishops of Pontus.
His reply to a certain Celsus, an epicurean philosopher, who had written against us, filled eight volumes.
In short, such was his diligence in writing, that St. Jerome says somewhere that he had read five thousand books of which Origen was the author.
2
Decius reigned one year and three months.
Having put to death the two Philips, father and son, he carried the hatred he bore them so far as to order the Christians to be persecuted;
pope Fabian then received the crown of mar­ tyrdom, and left the episcopal see to Cornelius.
Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, also received the martyrs crown at Cæsarea in Palestine, and Babylas at Antioch.
1Gallus, with his son Volusian, reigned two years and four months.
Dionysius, a priest of Alexandria, relates that the commencement of the reign of this prince was most prospe­ rous, and that everything succeeded according to his mind, but that, having persecuted the holy men who offered up prayers to the supreme God for the tranquillity of the empire, his own peace and prosperity vanished.
Origen died before he had quite completed his seventieth year, and was buried in the city of Tyre.
At the request of Lucina, a Roman matron, the pope, Cornelius, raised from the catacombs, during the night, the bodies of the two apostles, which had been deposited there, and interred that of St. Paul on the road to Ostia, where he had been beheaded, and that of St. Peter near the spot which had witnessed his crucifixion;
among the bodies of the holy bishops, where formerly stood the temple of Apollo, on the Vatican Mount, and Nero built a palace.
The bodies were translated on the third of the calends of July,2 (the 29th of June).
Valerian and his son Gallienus reigned fifteen years.
Having raised a persecution against the Christians, Valerian was soon afterwards taken prisoner by Sapor, king of the Persians, and being deprived of his sight, wore out his days to old age a wretched captive.
Gallienus, terrified at such a manifest judgment of God, gave orders that the Christians should not be molested.
Nevertheless, either as a punishment for his own licentiousness, or for his father's hostility to God, the incursions of the barbarians caused the greatest calamities throughout the Roman empire.
During this persecution, Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, whose very learned works are still extant, suffered martyr­ dom.
Pontius, one of his deacons, has left us an admirable volume, describing his life and death, having suffered exile with him up to his last moments.
Theodore Gregory, bishop of Neocæsarea, in Pontus, was eminently distinguished by the performance of miracles;
he gave a -proof of this power, when, by his prayers, he removed a mountain in order to have sufficient room for the foundations of a church which he intended to raise.
Stephen and Sixtus, bishops of Rome, suffered martyrdom.
1Claudius (II.) reigned one year and nine months.
He vanquished the Goths, who, for fifteen years, had been ravaging Illyricum and Macedonia;
for this service rendered to the state, the senate heaped honours on his memory;
a golden shield was hung up in the senate-house, and a statue of the same metal erected in the Capitol.
Marcion, a very eloquent priest of the church of Antioch, who taught rhetoric in that city, disputed with Paul of Samosata, bishop of Antioch, who held that Christ was of the nature common to man;
his discourse, which was taken down in writing by the notaries, is still extant.
2.
Aurelian governed the Roman empire for five years and six months.
Having excited a persecution against us, a thunderbolt fell before him to the great consternation of all present;
and not long after this he was massacred by the soldiers half way on the road leading from Constantinople to Heraclea.
Eutychian, the pope, was martyred at Rome, and interred in the cemetery of Callistus, where he had buried three hundred and thirteen martyrs with his own hands.
1Tacitus reigned six months.
Having lost his life in Pontus, Florian seized the empire which he held eighty- eight days, and was killed at Tarsus.
Anatolius, a native of Alexandria, and bishop of Laodicea, in Syria, well versed in all the learning of the philosophers, is highly spoken of;
we may judge of his genius by his work on Easter, and his ten books on arithmetic.
About this time the insane heresy of the Manicheans and Sabellians commenced.
2Probus, during his reign of six years and four months, com­ pletely delivered Gaul from the barbarians, who for a long time had occupied that country, but whom he routed in many bloody battles.
Archelaus, bishop of Mesopotamia, composed, in the Syrian language, a book on his con- troversy with Manes of Persia;
this work, translated into Greek, is in the hands of a great many readers.
1
Car us reigned, jointly with his sons Carinus and Nu­ merianus, two years.
Gaius, bishop of Rome, shone illus­ triously as the head of that church, but suffered martyrdom under Diocletian.
Pierius, a priest of Alexandria, during the patriarchate of Theonas, instructed the people with.
the greatest success;
his sermons and divers treatises, still extant, are written in so elegant a style, that he was called Origen the younger;
a man surprisingly frugal, and affecting voluntary poverty;
he spent the remainder of his days after the persecution at Rome.
2Diocletian reigned jointly with Heracleus Maximian twenty years.
Carausius having assumed the purple, took possession of Britain.
3 Narses, king of the Persians, invaded the east.
The Quinquegentians infested Africa.
Achilleus made himself master of Egypt.
To face so many enemies, Diocletian admitted into the government the Cæsars Constantius and Galerius Maximian.
The first married Theodora, the step-daughter of Heracleus, by whom he had six children, who were the brothers [and sisters] of Constantine.
Galerius obtained the hand of Valeria, daughter of Diocletian.
Ten years afterwards, Asclepiodotus, the prætorian prefect, recovered Britain.
In the nineteenth year of this reign, Diocletian in the east, and Heracleus, Maximian in the west, ordered the churches to be plundered, and the Christians to be tor­ mented and put to death.
In the second year of this persecution, Diocletian laid down the purple in Nicomedia, and compelled his colleague Maximian, at the same time, to abdicate the government at Milan.
However, this per­ secution, having once commenced, continued to rage until the seventh year of the reign of Constantine.
Constantius (Chlorus), a prince of a mild disposition, and of great affability, died at York, in Britain, in the sixteenth year of his reign.
The persecution of the Christians was urged forward with such cruelty and fury, that in the course of a month they reckon eighteen thousand martyrs, who had suffered death for Christ.
Having passed the limits of the ocean, it shed the precious blood of Alban, Aaron, Julius, and many other persons of both sexes, in Britain.
Then also Pamphilus suffered martydom;
he was the particular friend of Eusebius, bishop of Cesarea, who him­ self has given, in three books, the history of the life of this holy priest.
In the third year of the persecution, Constantius quitted this world, and Maximinus and Severus received the title of Cæsar from Galerius Maximian;
1 this Maximian added to his many misdeeds and adulteries, the crime of persecuting the Christians.
2
At that time, Peter, bishop of Alex­ andria, and several other bishops in Egypt, were put to death, as well as Lucian, a priest of Antioch, remarkable for his good morals, continence, and erudition;
with many other servants of Christ.
3
Constantine, the son of Constantius, by Helena his con­ sort, was proclaimed emperor in Britain;
he reigned thirty years and ten months.
In the fourth year of the persecution, Maxentius,1 son of Heraclius Maximian, was proclaimed Augustus at Rome, and Licinius, who bad married Constantia, the sister of Constantine, was created emperor at Carnuntum.
Constantine, after having been a persecutor, became aeon vert to Christianity, and endeavoured, to the utmost of his power, to exalt the church of God. 2
The catholic faith was defined at the council of Nice.
The emperor ordered a number of churches to be built for divine worship:
he had one constructed at Rome, in honour of St. John the Baptist, in which he was baptized, which was called the church of Constantine, after the founders name;
another on the site of the temple of Apollo, dedicated to St. Peter;
and a third on the road to Ostia, to St. Paul;
he raised a chapel in the Sessorian palace, to which he gave the name of Jerusalem, and placed in it a fragment of our Saviours cross.
At the request of his daughter, he dedicated a church to St. Agnes the Martyr, and another to St. Lawrence the Martyr, on the road to Tibur, on the land of Veranus.
He also built a church on the Lavican way, between two laurels, in honour of the holy martyrs Marcel­ linus and Peter, and a mausoleum, where he laid the remains of his mother in a- sarcophagus of porphyry.
He, besides, ordered the construction of a church, to be dedicated to the memory of the holy apostles, Peter and Paul, and St. John the Baptist, near Ostia, the port of Rome.
Churches were also built to the memory of St. John in the towns of Albano and Naples.
This same emperor rebuilt Drepana, a town in Bithynia, in honour of the martyr Lucian, who was buried there, and called it Helenopolis, after the name of his mother.
But he founded in Thrace a town which was to bear his own name, and wished it to become the seat of the Hornan government, and the capital of all the east.
He also commanded that the pagan temples should be closed without further effusion of human blood.
Constantius [II.] with his brothers Constantine and Constans, reigned twenty-four years, five months, and thirteen days.
James was acknowledged bishop of Nisibis, a town which was often delivered by his prayers from the perils that threatened it.
The Arian heresy, upheld and protected by the emperor, at first caused the persecution of Athanasius, and afterwards of all the bishops who were not of that sect;
who had to suffer banishment, imprison­ ment, and all kinds of punishment.
Maximin, bishop of Treves, was one of the most illustrious prelates of that period;
he sheltered with honour Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, when Constantine sought to punish him.
Anthony, the monk, died in his hermitage, at the age of a hundred and five.
Constantius, having returned to Rome, the Christians at Constantinople received the bones of Andrew the apostle, and of Luke the evangelist, with great exultation.
Hilary, bishop of Poictiers, who had been sent an exile into Phrygia by the Arians, after having repaired to Constantinople to present his petition to Constantius, was allowed to return to Gaul.
1Julian reigned two years and eight months.
He had been baptized, had taken holy orders, as far as the rank of deacon;
1 but having left the church, he adopted the profession of arms, made himself master of the empire, and returning to the worship of idols, became a persecutor of the Christians.
Then the pagans took possession of the tomb of John the Baptist, at Sebaste, a town of Palestine, and scattered his bones about the country;
they then col­ lected them together again, and burned and dispersed them over a wider tract.
But, by the providence of God, a few monks came from Jerusalem, and mixing with the crowd, who were collecting these remains, gathered up what they could, and carried them to their superior, Philip.
Convinced that it would be beyond his power, with the means at his disposal, to preserve a treasure of such importance, he immediately sent them to Athanasius, the most illustrious bishop of that age, confiding them to the care of his deacon, Julian.
The bishop, as soon as he had received them, enclosed these relics in a cavity which he caused to be made in the wall of the sanctuary, in the presence of only a few witnesses, and with a prophetical spirit dedicated them to future generations.
What he foresaw was fulfilled under the emperor Theodosius by Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria, who, having destroyed the tomb of Serapis, consecrated on that same spot a church to St. John.
2Jovian reigned eight months.
Meletius and his adherents called together a council at Antioch, which condemned the doctrine of Macedonius, who blasphemed the Holy Ghost.
3
The emperor, having concluded with the Persians a truce for twenty-nine years, re-entered the territory of the Roman empire.
Warned by the fall of his predecessor Constantius, he wrote to Athanasius the most respectful and kind letters, and received from him the orthodox creed, and rules for the better government of the churches.
Unfortunately, a premature death, which carried him off in Cilicia, did not allow his pious and happy principles to bear fruit.
Valentinian reigned jointly with his brother Valens eleven years.
Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea, wrote several works favourable to our doctrines, but having afterwards swerved from the faith, he founded the heresy which bears his name.
Damasus, bishop of Rome, built a church near the theatre, in honour of St. Lawrence, and another over the catacombs, where lay the bodies of the holy apostles, Peter and Paul;
and decorated the pavement which covered them with in­ scriptions in verse.
Valens, after being baptized by Eu­ doxius, an Arian bishop, persecuted the orthodox.
Gratian, son of Valentinian, was raised to the imperial dignity at Amiens, in the third year of his father's reign.
At Con­ stantinople a church was dedicated to the apostles who had suffered martyrdom.
A.uxentius at length dying, Ambrose was raised to the bishopric of Milan, and by his preaching, converted to the faith of Christ the whole of Cisalpine Gaul.
'Valens reigned four years with Gratian and Valentinian, the sons of his brother Valentinian.
Valens, having made a decree that monks should be subject to military service, ordered all those who refused to be beaten to death.
The Huns, who up to that time [A.D. 375] had been confined to their inaccessible mountains, driven by a sudden fit of rage, fell with fury upon the Goths, who, being attacked in different quarters, were expelled from their ancient seats [A.D. 376].
Having passed the Danube, the Goths were received in their flight by Valens, who did not require them to lay down their arms ;
but soon afterwards, experiencing all the horrors of a famine, through the avarice of Maximus.
the Roman general, they were compelled to take up arms aginst the Romans, and having defeated the emperors troops, they overran Thrace, plundering and destroying everything with fire and sword.
After the death of Valens, Gratian and his brother Valentinian [II.] reigned six years.
1 Theodosius, created by Gratian emperor [of the east], vanquished in many great battles those powerful nations which had emigrated from Scythia, that is to say, the Alans, Huns, and Goths.
The Arians, displeased at seeing the harmony that existed between these two princes, at last gave up the churches which they had retained possession of by violence during forty years.
A council of one hundred and fifty fathers assembled at Constantinople under Damasus, bishop of Rome, against Macedonius.
2
Theodosius took his son Arcadius as his colleague in the empire.
In the second year of the reign of Gratian, when he, as well as Theodosius, was consul for the sixth time,3 Theophilus compiled his Easter tables.
Maximus, a valiant and good man, and worthy of the title of Augustus, if, contrary to his oath, he had not aspired to the empire, was, almost against his will, proclaimed em­ peror by the army in'Britain [A.D. 383] ;
he passed over into Gaul, where, near Lyons, he treasonably killed the emperor Gratian, whom he had drawn into a snare, and drove his brother Valentinian out of Italy.
He nevertheless justly suffered the punishment of being banished with his mother Justina, for both were infected with the impure heresy of Arius, and he had shamefully persecuted Ambrose, the glorious bulwark of the catholic faith, and did not desist from his impious projects until the relics of the blessed martyrs, Gervase and Protase, were discovered by a divine revelation.
Theodosius, who during the lifetime of Gratian had already governed the east for the space of six years, reigned eleven years after the death of the latter.
He and Valentinian, whom he had kindly received at his court after his expulsion from Italy, caused the tyrant Maxim us to be put to death, near the third milestone from Aquileia.
1
As this usurper had withdrawn from Britain nearly all the troops and all the youth capable of bearing arms, who followed his standard to Gaul but never again returned home, those barbarous nations beyond the straits, the Scots from the north-west, and the Picts from the north, seeing the island defenceless and deprived of its soldiers, crossed over and harassed it many years with ruin and plunder.
2 Jerome, the interpreter of sacred history, brought down the book lie wrote on the illustrious men of the church to the fourteenth year of the reign of Theodosius.
Arcadius, son of Theodosius, with his brother Honorius, reigned thirteen years.
The bodies of the holy prophets Habakkuk and Micah were discovered in consequence of a divine revelation.

Innocent, bishop of Rome, dedicated a church to the blessed martyrs, Gervase and Protase, built with the funds left in her will by an illustrious woman named Vestina.
Then Alexis, a servant of Christ, quitted this world.
Pelagius, a Briton, impugned divine grace.
4Honorius with Theodosius the younger, his brothers son, reigned sixteen years.
Alaric, king of the Goths, took possession of Borne, and set fire to it, on the 9th of the calends of September [24th of August], A.U.C. 116-1, quit­ ting it and carrying off an immense booty, six-days after he entered it.
1Lucian, the priest, to whom God, in the seventh year of the reign of Honorius, revealed the spot where lay the tombs that enclosed the remains of St. Stephen, the first martyr, and of Gamaliel and Nicodemus, of whom we read in the Gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles, wrote this revelation in Greek, and addressed it to the heads of all the churches.
Avitus, a priest of Spanish extraction, translated this work into Latin, and adding an epistle to it, gave it to the western world through the instrumentality of the priest Orosius.
This same Orosius, who, on his arrival at the holy places, where Augustine had sent him to learn what was good for his soul, received the relics of St. Stephen, and returning to his own country, was the first to carry them into the west.
2The Britons, no longer able to bear the exterminating inroads of the Scots and Picts, sent envoys to Rome im­ ploring aid against these enemies, and offering to submit to the Roman government.
A legion was immediately sent to their relief, which put to the sword an immense number of the barbarians, drove the rest beyond the frontiers of Britain, and, on the eye of returning home, advised their allies to raise a wall across the island, from sea to sea, to check the incursions of their enemies.
This rampart, constructed without regard to the rules of art, and in which more turf than stone was used, was of no service to those who built it;
for as soon as the Romans had turned their backs, their old enemies re-appeared in their boats, and cut down, trampled under foot, and devoured, everything they could find, like a ripe field of corn.
The Britons again applied to theRomans for succour, who hastened to their assistance, defeated the barbarians, and drove them across the sea;
they then, with the assistance of the natives, raised between the towns which they had built in their alarm a wall, from sea to sea, not as before of loose earth, but of solid stones.
On the southern shore of the straits also, as incursions were apprehended in that quarter, they erected at intervals watch-towers, commanding extensive views.
The Romans then took leave of their allies, never to return again.
Boniface, bishop of Rome, erected a chapel in the cemetery of St. Felicitas, and ornamented her tomb and that of St. Sylvanus.
Jerome, the priest, died at the age of ninety-one, in the twelfth year of the reign of Honorius, the 2nd of the calends of October [30th of September].
1After the death of Honorius, Theodosius the younger, son of Arcadius, reigned twenty-six years.
Valentinian the younger, the son of Constantius, was created emperor at Ravenna;
while his mother Placidia had received the title of Augusta some time before.
Those fierce nations, the Vandals, Alans, and Goths, crossing over into Africa from Spain, ravaged the country with fire and sword, and polluted it by the impiety of the Arian heresy.
2 St. Augustine, bishop of Hippo, an eminent doctor of the church, was saved from seeing the ruin of his city by being translated to the Lord during the third month of the siege it was then undergoing, on the fifth of the calends of September [28th of August], having lived seventy-six years, of which he had spent near forty as clerk or bishop.
About the same time, the Vandals, after taking Carthage, passed over into Sicily,.
and com­ pletely devastated it.
Paschasinus, bishop of Lilybea, men­ tions the captivity of its inhabitants in a letter which he wrote to Pope Leo concerning the period for the celebration of Easter.
3Palladius, ordained by Pope Celestine the first bishop of the Scots who had been converted to the faith of Christ, was sent over in the eighth year of Theodosius.
When the Roman army was withdrawn from Britain, the Scots and Picts, knowing that they would not return, re-appeared, and wrested from the natives the whole island from the north, as far as the wall.
The guards of the rampart were quickly killed, taken prisoners, or put to flight, the wall it­ self was broken through, and the country on the other side of it savagely plundered.
A letter full of grief and trouble was sent to Aëtius, who had the command of the Roman troops in the twenty-third year of the reign of Theodosius, and was now consul for the third time, imploring succour in vain.
Meanwhile a dreadful and memorable famine afflicted the fugitives, and caused some of them to go over to the enemy, while the remainder, retiring to the mountains, caverns, and forests, made a desperate resist­ ance, and inflicted great loss on the invaders.
The Scots returned to their homes, intending shortly to renew their incursions ;
but the Picts retained possession of the ex­ treme part of the island, which they now for the first time determined to inhabit.
The famine, just spoken of, was followed by a great abundance of the fruits of the earth, with its natural consequences, extravagance and careless­ ness ;
a pestilence ensued, to which was shortly added a plague still worse, the arrival of the English, who were new enemies, in the country.
The Britons in a general assem­ bly under their king Vortigern, unanimously agreed to in­ vite them over to assist in the defence of the country;
but they soon discovered that the English were their oppres­ sors instead of their defenders.
Sixtus, bishop of Rome, dedicated to St. Mary, the mother of our Lord, the building which the ancients called the church ofLiberius.
Eudosia, the wife of Theodosius, returned from Jerusalem, bringing with her the relics of the blessed St. Stephen, the first martyr, which were exposed to the veneration of the faithful in the church of St. Lawrence.
Bleda and Attila, his brother, who governed several powerful nations, devastated Illyricum and Thrace.
1Marcian and Valentinian reigned as joint emperors seven years.
The Angles, or Saxons, who crossed over the sea in three long ships, now landed in Britain.
1
Their countrymen at home, hearing reports that their voyage had been prosperous, sent over a stronger force, which, combining with the former band, soon overcame the resistance of the enemy.
They then turned their arms against their allies, and ravaged nearly the whole island from the east to the west with fire and sword, under pretence that the Britons had not sufficiently remunerated those who had fought for them.
John the Baptist revealed to two eastern monks, who had travelled as pilgrims to Jerusalem, the place where his head was concealed, near the palace which once belonged to King Herod;
this head was afterwards carried to Emesa, in Phœnicia, where it received due honour.
2
Aben the heresy of Pelagius disturbed the faith of the Britons, they implored assistance from the bishops of Gaul, and found defenders of the truth in Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus, bishop of Troyes, both con­ fessors of the apostolic grace.
These illustrious champions of our Lord strengthened the faith by the word of truth, as well as by signs and miracles;
and the attack made on the Britons at this time by the combined forces of the Saxons and Picts, was by divine help defeated.
For Ger­ manus taking the command himself, put the hosts of the enemy to flight, not by the sound of the trumpet, but with shouts of “ Hallelujah,” the whole army raising their voices to heaven.
3
After this, he went to Ravenna, where he was received with the greatest respect by Valentinian and Placidia, and then departed in the Lord.
His body was carried to Auxerre, with honourable attendance and working of miracles.
The patrician Aëtius, the saviour of the western part of the empire, and once the terror of Attila himself, was put to death by Valentinian.
With him fell the western empire, which was never restored.
1About this time the kingdom of the Franks was founded.
For Perramund [Pharamond], the son of Francus, duke of Sens, during the reign of Theodosius the younger, son of Arcadius, and when Celestine was pope, was the first king of the Franks.
He reigned five years;
and on his demise, was succeeded by Clodion, whose reign lasted seven years.
2
Then the devil appeared to the Jews in the island of Crete, in the form of Moses, and promised that he would conduct them dry-shod across the sea to the land of promise ;
but several lost their lives, and the remainder were converted to the Christian faith.
In the second year of Marcian and Valentinian, Merove, king of the Franks, died after a reign of thirteen years, and was succeeded by Childeric his son, who governed the Franks twenty-three years.
3
Leo [I.] was emperor seventeen years.
After the council of Chalcedon he addressed a circular letter to all the ortho­ dox bishops throughout the world, requesting them to let him know their individual opinions respecting the decisions of that assembly.
The answers he received from them all.
on the true nature of the incarnation of Christ, agreed as if they were written at the same moment and dictated by the same person.
1Theodoret, bishop of Cyra, which took its name from its founder Cyrus, king of the Persians, wrote a treatise on the true nature of the incarnation of our Saviour against Eutiches, and Disocorus, bishop of Alexandria, who denied the human nature of Christ.
Besides this, he composed an Ecclesiastical History, from the end of the Chronicle of Eusebius, to his own time, that is to say, the reign of the Emperor Leo, during which he departed this life.
Victorius, in obedience to the orders of Pope Hilary, composed his Paschal Canon, of five hundred and thirty-two years.
2
Zeno reigned seventeen years.
The body of the apostle Barnabas, and the Gospel of St. Matthew, copied by him, were discovered, by a revelation made by himself.
3
Odoacer, king of the Goths, made himself master of Rome, which the kings of that nation held for some time.
On the death of Theodoric, son of Triarius, another Theodoric, surnamed Walamir, became king of the Goths.
This prince ravaged both Macedonia and Thessaly, set on fire several quarters of the imperial city, and invaded and occupied Italy.
Huneric, king of the Vandals, an Arian, banished or drove out more than three hundred and thirty­ four Catholic bishops in Africa, closed their churches, and tortured the people in various ways, chopping off their hands and cutting out their tongues, but he could not pre­ vent the Catholic faith from being openly confessed.
4Aurelius Ambrosius, a man of great moderation, the only one of Roman extraction who had the good fortune to escape the swords of the Saxons, when they had massacred his parents, who were next robed in the imperial purple, now led the Britons to battle against their conquerors who were defeated in turn.
From that day victory declared itself, sometimes in favour of one party, sometimes of the other, until the moment came when a more powerful foreigner possessed the whole island, for a long period.
1In the first year of the reign of Zeno, on the death of Childeric, his son Clovis began to reign in Gaul, and held the sceptre with a powerful hand for nineteen years.
2Anastasius governed the empire for the space of eighteen years.
Thrasamond, king of the Vandals, ordered the Catholic churches to be closed, and banished two hundred and twenty bishops to Sardinia.
Pope Symmachus, who either founded or repaired a great number of churches, ordered dwellings to be erected for the poor near the churches of St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Lawrence, and sent every year money and clothes to Sardinia and Africa, for the bishops who were banished.
Anastasius, who, favouring the heresy of Eutyches, persecuted the Catholics, was killed by lightning from heaven.
3Clovis, king of the Franks, was baptized by St. Remi, archbishop of Rheims, in the fifteenth year of his reign, with three thousand of his nobles.
He died four years afterwards, and was succeeded by his son Theodoric.
On his death, Clotaire, his brother, reigned fifty-one years in France.
At that time, Guildard and Flavius flourished in the see of Rouen;
and Mamertus, archbishop of Vienne, appointed litanies, that is to say, rogations, before Ascension-day, on account of the destructive plague which afflicted the peopledJustin the elder reigned eight years.
1 Pope John, when visiting Constantinople, was met at the Golden Gate, by a great concourse of people, in whose presence he restored to sight a blind man, who implored relief.
On his return, Theodoric ordered him to be arrested at Ravenna, and thrown into prison with his attendants, where he died.
Theodoric was led to commit this crime from jealousy, because Justin, the defender of the Catholic faith, had re­ ceived this prelate honourably.
In the same year, be put to death Symmachus, patrician of Ravenna;
but the next year lie himself died suddenly in the same city, and was succeeded by his nephew Athalaric.
Hilderic, king of the Vandals, ordered the bishops to be recalled from exile, and the churches to be repaired, after seventy-four years of heretical profanations.
Benedict, the abbot, was illustrious for his virtues, which Pope St. Gregory has recorded in his book of Dialogues.
2Justinian, nephew of Justin by a sister of that prince, reigned twenty-eight years.
The patrician Belisarius, sent into Africa by Justinian, subdued the Vandals.
He re­ took Carthage after it had been ninety-six years in their hands, whom he defeated and expelled, taking their king Gelimer, whom he sent prisoner to Constantinople.
The body of St. Anthony the monk, found by a divine revelation, was conveyed to Alexandria, and buried in the church of St. John the Baptist.
Dionysius the Little wrote on the paschal cycles, beginning with the year of the incarnation of our Lord.
At the same time the code of Justinian was promulgated throughout the world.
Victor, bishop of Capua, also composed a book concerning Easter, in which he refuted the errors of Victorius.
1King Clotaire died at a great age, and the kingdom of the Franks was parted into four divisions;
Paris fell to the lot of Charibert, Orleans to Guntran, Soissons to Chil­ peric, and Metz to Sigebert.
But in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Justinian, King Sigebert was slain by the treachery of his brother Chilperic, with whom.
he was at war.
His son Childebert, who was yet in his infancy, suc­ ceeded, under the guardianship of his mother Brunehaut, and reigned twenty-five years.
2Justin the Younger's reign lasted eleven years.
3
The patrician Narses vanquished and killed Totila, the king of the Goths, in Italy.
The Romans, for whom he had struggled bravely against the Goths, enviously accusing him before Justin and his wife Sophia of oppressing Italy, he retired to Naples in Campania, whence he wrote letters to the Lombards, to induce them to invade and take posses­ sion of Italy.
Pope John finished and consecrated the church of SS.
Philip and James, which his predecessor Pelagias had begun.
Then the warlike Alboin, son of Audoin, king of the Lombards, passed from Pannonia into Italy, at the head of the Guinili, and, with the consent of the patrician Narses, subjected it to his dominion.
4Tiberius Constantine reigned seven years.
1 Gregory, then apostolic nuncio at Constantinople, and afterwards bishop of Rome, composed his commentary on the book of Job, and, in the presence of Tiberius, convicted Eutychius, the bishop, of error in his belief in the resurrection.
He proved this so clearly that the emperor was of opinion that the book Eutychius had written on the resurrection ought to be committed to the flames, having also refuted it himself by allegations derived from Catholic authorities.
Eutychius taught that in the glory of the resurrection, our bodies will be impalpable, and more subtile than the winds and the air ;
an assertion which was contrary to these words of our Saviour:
"Handle me and see;
for a spirit bath not flesh and bones as ye see me have."
2The nation of the Longobards, or Lombards, having in their train famine and mortality, overran the whole of Italy, and laid siege to the city of Rome.
Alboin was then their king.
Maurice reigned twenty-one years.
Hermenegild, son of Leuvigild, king of the Goths, having resolutely confessed the Catholic faith, was deprived by his father, who was an Arian, of all his honours, thrown into prison and chains, and at last beheaded, on the second night after Easter;
and thus the king and martyr exchanged an earthly throne for the celestial kingdom.
His brother Recared, who soon after succeeded his father, converted to the Catholic faith the whole nation of the Goths under his dominion, at the instance of Leander, bishop of Seville, who had also in­ structed Hermenegild.
3
Maurice married the daughter of Tiberius Constantine, and was the first of the Greek emperors who ordered the Roman fasces to be carried before him.
In the thirteenth year of the reign of Maurice, the thirteenth indiction, Gregory, bishop of the Roman church, and a very learned doctor, assembled a council of twenty-three bishops at the tomb of St. Peter the apostle, to make such decrees as the state of the church required.
The same pope, having sent into Britain, Augustine, Mellitus, John, and several other monks who feared God, converted the English to Chris­ tianity.
Ethelbert soon received the faith of Christ with the whole Kentish nation, his subjects, and the neighbouring provinces under his rule, conferring bishoprics, not only on Augustine, his own teacher, but also on other holy priests.
The English nations to the north of the river Number, under their kings Ella and Ethelfrid, had not yet heard the word of life.
Gregory, writing to Augustine and the bishops of London and York, in the eighteenth year of the reign of Maurice, in the fourth indiction, sent them the pall, and gave them the title of metropolitans, and died four years afterwards.
1Phocas reigned eight years.
2
This prince, at the request of Pope Boniface, decided that the Roman and apostolical see was the head of all the churches in Christendom, in order to put a stop to the pretensions of the church of Con­ stantinople, which styled itself the first of all the Christian churches.
The same emperor, at the instance of another pope Boniface, gave orders that the ancient temple called the Pantheon, after being cleansed from the pollutions of idolatry, should be converted into a church, dedicated to the blessed Mary, ever-virgin, and all the martyrs, so that the very place where of old they celebrated the worship, not of all the gods, but of all the demons, was from that day ren­ dered sacred to the memory of all the saints.
The Persians, still continuing a ruinous war against the republic, wrested from it many of the Roman provinces, and even Jerusalem, destroying the churches, profaning everything sacred, and among the ornaments belonging to the holy places, or to individuals, they carried off the standard of our Saviours cross.
1Heraclius reigned thirty-one years.
2 Anastasius, a Persian monk, suffered a glorious martyrdom for Christ's sake.
Although born in Persia, and instructed by his father, when a child, in the science of the Magi, yet as soon as he heard the name of Christ from the captive Christians, he presently turned to him with all his heart;
and having quitted Persia, he went to Chalcedon and Hierapolis, seeking Christ every­ where, and lastly to Jerusalem.
Here lie received the grace of baptism, and entered the monastery of abbot Anastasius, situated at the distance of four miles from the city.
Having there spent seven years, under the monastic rule, while on a pilgrimage to Cæsarea, in Palestine, he fell into the hands of the Persians, and after much suffering from Marzabanes, the judge, who caused him to be scourged, imprisoned, and bound in chains, be was at length sent into Persia to King Chosroes.
This prince ordered him to be scourged three times at intervals, then suspended by one hand for three hours, and at last to be beheaded, with seventy other martyrs.
Soon afterwards a certain demoniac, being clothed in the tunic of this saint, was healed.
Meanwhile, the emperor Heraclius, coming suddenly at the head of an army, and .defeating Chosroes and the Persians, recovered with triumph -the captive Christians, and brought back to Jerusalem the wood of the holy cross.
The relics of the blessed martyr Anastasius were conveyed at first to his monastery, but afterwards to Rome, where they are exposed to veneration in the convent of St. Paul the apostle (ad aquas SalviasIn the sixteenth year of the reign of Heraclius, in the fifteenth induction, Edwin, the excellent king of the English in Britain living to the north of the Humber, received, as well as his subjects, the word of salvation preached to them by bishop Paulinus, whom the venerable Justus, archbishop of Canterbury, had sent into those parts.
In the eleventh year of his reign, and about 180 years after the arrival of the English in Britain, Paulinus was raised to the episcopal see of York.
As an auspicious omen of the faith that was to come, and of the celestial kingdom, the king Edwin's temporal power had so increased, that (what no English king before him had ever achieved) he extended his dominion through every quarter of the island, whether possessed by the Saxons or the Britons.
At that time Pope Honorius refuted an error which had arisen among the Scots, with regard to the observance of Easter, in a letter ad­ dressed to that nation ;
and John, the successor of Severinus, who followed Honorius, also wrote to the same people while he was pope elect, concerning Easter and the Pelagian heresy, which had again revived in their country.
1After the deaths of Theodebert and Theoderic, Clotaire the Great, the son of Chilperic, flourished in France, of which he obtained the sole monarchy.
On his death Dagobert, his son, succeeded him, and for twelve years held the reigns of government with a powerful hand.
His son Clovis ascended the throne after him, and at his death bequeathed his dominions to his three sons, Clotaire, Theoderic, and Cbilderic.
In the time of these kings, several holy men distinguished themselves in France by their virtues and miracles:
Romanus and Ouen, Ansbert and Eloi, Evroult and Laumer, Maur and Columban, Philibert and Wandrille, with many others, powerful by their faith and preaching, and illustrious for their sanctity and miracles.
2Heracleonas reigned two years with his mother Martina.
Cyrus, bishop of Alexandria, Sergius and Pyrrhus, bishops of Constantinople, renewed the heresy of the Acephali, by teaching the doctrine of one operation and one will in the divinity and humanity of Christ.
Pyrrhus came from Africa to Rome, on a visit to Pope Theodore, and feigning a peni­ tence which afterwards appeared to have been assumed, pre­ sented the pope, in the presence of the clergy and people, a writing under his hand, condemning all that he or his predecessors had written or done against the Catholic faith.
Deceived by this step, the pope kindly received him as bishop of the imperial city.
But, on his return to Constan­ tinople, he re-asserted his former errors, upon which Pope Theodore convoked the priests and clergy in the church of St. Peter, prince of the apostles, and sentenced him to ex­ communication.
1Constantine, the brother of Heraclius, reigned six months.
2 Paul, the successor of Pyrrhus, not only troubled the Catholics by his strange doctrine, as his predecessors had done, but by open persecution.
The apostolic nuncios, sent by the holy Roman church to correct him, were imprisoned, banished, or scourged;
and he went so far as to strip and pull down the altar they had dedicated in the oratory of Placidia's palace, forbidding them to celebrate mass there.
Like his predecessors, therefore, the sentence of deposition was justly pronounced against him by the apostolic see.
1Consigns [II.], the son of Constantine, reigned twenty- eight years.
Deceived by Paul, as Heraclius his grand­ father had been by Sergius, also bishop of the imperial city, he published an edict against the Catholic faith, defining that there were neither one nor two wills, or operations, in Christ, as if we were to believe that he had neither willed nor acted.
Wherefore Pope Martin, having assembled at Rome a synod of one hundred and five bishops, excommu­ nicated Cyrus, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paul, the heretics just mentioned.
The exarch Theodore, who was soon afterwards sent by the emperor, carried off Pope Martin from theLateran, and conducted him to Constantinople.
He was then banished to the Chersonesus, where he ended his days, and the lustre of his miracles still continues.
The synod above-mentioned was held in the ninth year of the reign of Constans, in the month of October, in the eighth indiction.
This emperor sent to Vitalian, recently elected pope, a book of the gospels, written in letters of gold, and ornamented all round the cover with diamonds of an extraordinary size, to be deposited in the church of St. Peter the apostle.
A few yearsafterwards, that is, during the sixth indiction, the same emperor, on his visit to Rome, offered on the altar of St. Peter a pall of cloth of gold, and made his whole army enter the church, each soldier carrying a wax-candle.
The following year, the sun was eclipsed on the 5th of the nones [3rd] of May, about ten o'clock in the day.
Archbishop Theodore and Adrian, the abbot, a man equally learned, were sent by Vitalian into Britain, where they caused most of the English churches to bear the fruits of sound doctrine.
Constans, after frequently subjecting the provinces to incredible ravages, was assassinated in a bath in the twelfth indiction;
and not long after Yitalian, the pope, departed to the realms of bliss.
2Constantine, the brother of Constans, the last emperor, reigned seventeen years.
1
The Saracens invaded Sicily, but soon afterwards returned to Alexandria, carrying off an immense booty.
Pope Agatho, yielding to the prayer of the Emperor Constantine and his two brothers, Heraclius and Tiberius, princes remarkable for their piety, sent legates to Constantinople, to restore union among the holy churches of God.
Amongst these were John, then deacon of the Roman church, who became a bishop a short time afterwards.
These legates were received with the greatest tokens of regard by Constantine, the august defender of the Catholic faith, and received orders to examine the true doctrine in an amicable conference, setting aside all philosophical dis­ putations.
They were supplied from the library of Constan­ tinople with all the books of the ancient fathers of the church which they required.
One hundred and fifty bishops assembled under the presidency of George, patriarch of the imperial city, and Macharius, patriarch of Antioch.
Those who pretended that there was but one will and one operation in Christ, were convicted of running counter to numerous passages of the Catholic fathers.
This debate ended, George was reclaimed;
but Macharius with his followers, as well as his predecessors, Cyrus, Sergius, Honorius, Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter, were anathematized;
and Theophanius, a Sicilian abbot, was made bishop of Antioch instead of Macharius.
So much favour was shown to these messengers of catholic unity that John, bishop of Oporto, one of them, was allowed to celebrate high mass before the emperor and the patriarch, in the church of St. Sophia, on the Sunday after Easter, in Latin.
This was the sixth œcumenical council, and it was held at Constantinople, and its acts written in the Greek language.
It assembled in the time of Pope Agatho, in, compliance with the request of the emperor then reigning, the most pious Constantine, in whose palace it met, and was attended by the legates of the holy see and one hun­ dred and fifty bishops.
1
The first general council was held at Nice against Anus, in the time of Pope Julius, under the Emperor Constantine [I.] :
when three hundred and eighteen bishops were present.
The second, consisting of one hundred and fifty fathers, assembled at Constantinople to condemn the doctrines of Macedonius and Eudoxius, in the time of Pope Damasus, and the Emperor Gratian, when Nectarius was ordained.
bishop of Constantinople.
The third council, of two hundred fathers, held its sit­ tings at Ephesus, during the reign of Theodosius the Great, and in the popedom of Celestine, to oppose Nestorius, bishop of the imperial city.
The fourth council, that of Chalcedon, consisted of six hundred and thirty bishops under Pope Leo, in the days of the Emperor Marcian.
Its censures were levelled against Eutyches, who was at the head of some most unprincipled monks.
2The fifth council, which also assembled at Constantinople, when Vigilius was pope and Justinian emperor, was directed against Theodore and all heretics.
The sixth oecumenical council has been just mentioned.
St. Etheldrida, who devoted herself to Christ in perpetual virginity, was daughter of Anna, king of the East Angles, and first married to Tonbert, a very great man, chief of the Southern Girvii, and afterwards to Egfrid, king of the North­ umbrians, with whom she lived twelve years undefiled by intercourse with her husband.
She afterwards descended from the throne, and, taking the veil, became a mother of virgins and the pious nurse of holy women, choosing a site for the erection of a convent in a place called the Isle of Ely.
Even her dead body recalled to mind her living merits, for it was found entire, as well as the shroud in which it was buried, sixteen years afterwards.
1Justinian the younger, soil of Constantine, reigned, ten years.
He concluded a truce with the Saracens forten years, by sea and land.
The province of Africa was re- united to the Roman empire, from which it had been wrested by the Saracens after they had captured and destroyed Carthage.
The emperor, finding that Sergius, of happy memory, bishop of the Roman church, would not ratify and subscribe the acts of the heretical council, which he had convoked at Constantinople, sent Zacharias, the captain of his guards, with orders to convey him there;
but the troops of Ravenna and the neighbourhood, opposed the cruel orders of the prince, and Zacharias was driven out of Rome, insulted and ill-used.
In the fourth year of the reign of Justinian, Pepin became mayor of the palace in France.
Pope Sergius ordained that venerable man Wilbrord, surnamed Clement, bishop of the Frisians.
An Englishman by birth, he quitted Britain to live amongst the barbarians, every day increasing the influence of the Christian faith and destroying the power of Satan.
Justinian, deprived for his perfidy of the imperial dignity, retired, an exile, into Pontus, where he was hospitably entertained by the abbot Cyrus.
2Leo reigned three years.
1 Pope Sergius, by a divine revelation, discovered in the sanctuary of the church of the blessed apostle Peter, a silver casket which had remained for a long while forgotten in a dark corner, and which enclosed a crucifix ornamented with precious stones.
Having unfolded four coverings studded with gems of remarkable size, he perceived that there was inserted in the crucifix a portion of the wood of the life-giving cross of Christ.
From that time it is yearly kissed and adored by the people on the anniversary of the exaltation of the cross, in the church of Constantine,2 dedicated to our Saviour.
In Britain, the venerable Cuthbert, who from being a hermit, was raised to the bishopric of Lindisfarne,3 wrought a succession of miracles from infancy to old age, which have rendered his name illustrious.
Eleven years after his inter­ ment, his body and the robes in which he was buried were found as perfect as at the hour of his death.
Cædwalla, king of the West Saxons, abdicated in favour of Ina, and repaired to Rome, where he was baptized by Pope Sergius on Easter eve;
and, while yet wearing his white garments, was seized with a disorder that caused his death, on the 12th of the calends of May [20th of April].
By order of the pope, who had given him at the baptismal font the name of Peter, he was buried in the church, of the holy apostle whose name he had adopted, and the following epitaph was engraved on his tomb :
—
“High state and place, kindred, a royal crown, The spoils of way, great triumphs and renown ;
Nobles, and cities walled to guard his state, His palaces and his familiar seat;
Whatever skill and valour made his own, And what his great forefathers handed down :
Cedwall armipotent, by Heaven inspired, For love of heaven, left all, and here retired.
Peter to see, and Peter's holy seat, The royal stranger turned his pilgrim feet;
Drew from the fount its purifying streams, And shared the radiance of celestial beams.
"After more to the same purpose, the epitaph thus con­ eludes :
— " From Britain's distant isle his vent'rous way, O'er lands, o'er seas, by toilsome journeyings lay, Rome to behold, her glorious temple see, And mystic offerings make on bended knee.
White robed among the flock of Christ he shone, His flesh to earth, his soul to heaven is gone.
Sure, wise was he to lay his sceptre down, And change an earthly for a heavenly crown."
1Tiberius reigned seven years.
The synod of Aquileia, from its lack of knowledge in the faith, was reluctant to admit the fifth general council, until it had listened to the sound instructions of the holy pope, when it consented to receive it, as the other Christian churches had done.
Grisulf, duke of the Lombards of Beneventum, ravaged Campania with fire and sword, and reduced a number of the inhabitants to captivity.
As no human power could resist these violent attacks, Pope John [VI.], who had succeeded Sergius, sent priests, loaded with presents, who redeemed the captives and induced the enemy to retire.
Another pope of the same name filled the apostolical chair imme­ diately after him, and, among other remarkable works, erected a chapel dedicated to the holy mother of Grod—a building of great beauty, within the church of the blessed Peter, prince of the apostles.
2Aribert [II.], king of the Lombards, restored to the holy see a number of farms in the Cottian Alps, which justly belonged to the apostolic see, but had been long before seized by the Lombards, ordering this donation to be inscribed in letters of gold on a tablet, which was sent to Rome.
1Justinian [IT.] reigned six years with his son Tiberius.
Having re-ascended the throne by the assistance of Terbellis, king of the Bulgarians, he condemned to death the patricians who had driven him out of his kingdom, as well as Leontius, who had usurped his sceptre, and Tiberius, his successor, who bad detained the banished emperor in custody within the walls of the city, during the whole period of his reign.
He ordered the patriarch Callinichus to be sent to Rome, after having his eyes put out, and bestowed his bishopric upon Cyrus, who was abbot in the Chersonesus, and who had entertained him during his exile.
Having sent for Pope Constantine, he received and dismissed him with great honour, so much so that, on the Sunday before his departure, the emperor requested him to say mass in his presence, and received the sacrament at his hands.
Pros­ trate on the ground, he besought the pope to intercede for the pardon of his sins;
and he also renewed the privileges of the whole church.
The troops which, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the pope, Justinian had sent into the Chersonesus to seize the person of Philippicus, banished there by his orders, suddenly took the part of Philippicus, and the whole army proclaimed him emperor.
On his return to Constantinople, when near the twelfth milestone from the city, he joined battle with Justinian, who was defeated and killed, and Philippicus mounted the throne.
2Philippicus reigned eighteen months.
This emperor ejected Cyrus from his bishopric, and ordered him to return to Pontus to resume, as abbot, the government of his monastery.
He addressed to Pope Constantine a mis­ sive so full of unsound doctrine, that, by the advice of the apostolic council, Constantine rejected it.
In consequence, he ordered tables, inscribed with the acts of the six œcume­ nical councils, to be set up in the portico of the church of St. Peter, as Philippicus had commanded those which were in the imperial city to be removed.
The Roman people, also decreed that the name of the heretical emperor should no longer be used in public documents or on coins;
and his effigy was not placed in the church, nor his name pro­ nounced in the office of the mass.
1Anastasius reigned three years.
He ordered his prisoner Philippicus to be deprived of sight, but his life to be spared.
This emperor wrote letters to Pope Constantine, and commissioned Scolasticus, patrician and exarch of Italy, to carry them to Rome.
In these letters he showed himself a defender of the Catholic faith, and recognized the validity of the acts of the sixth holy council.
Liutprand, king of the LOIn bards, admonished by the venerable pope, Gregory [II.], confirmed the donation of the land situate in the Cottian Alps, which Aribert had made and Liutprand had annulled.
Wulfran, archbishop of Sens and a monk of Fontenelle, signalized himself by the many miracles he per­ formed while preaching the word of God to the Frisians.
Egbert, a holy man of the English nation, and an honour to the priesthood by his monastic life, while a pilgrim to his heavenly country, converted several provinces inhabited by the Scots to the canonical observance of the time for cele­ brating Easter, from which they had departed for many years.
He preached among them in the year 717 of the incarnation of our Lord.
2Theodosius reigned one year.
3
Elected emperor,he defeated Anastasius in a severe engagement near the town of Nice, and having received his oath of allegiance compelled him to become a clerk, and be ordained priest.
As soon as he was seated upon the throne, being a Catholic, he replaced in its former situation the honoured tables containing the acts of the six holy synods, which Philippicus had ordered to be removed.
The river Tiber overflowed its banks, and caused much damage in the city of Rome;
its waters rose to a height of about eight feet in the Broad street (viâ latâ), and formed a wide torrent, extending from St. Peter's gate to the Milvian bridge.
This inundation lasted seven days, until, the citizens having frequently made processions with litanies, the river returned at last to its channel on the eighth day.
In those times, it was the custom of great numbers of the English, high and low, men and women, persons of rank and private individuals, inspired by the love of God, to leave Britain and repair to Rome.
1Leo reigned nine years.
2
In the third year of his reign Charles Martel, son of Pépin, became mayor of the palace, and, the year following, defeated the tyrant Ragenfred at Vinci, and after this victory besieged him in Angers.
The Saracens, investing Constantinople with an innumerable army, besieged the city for the space of three years, until the inhabitants, having raised their voices to heaven, their fervent prayers were heard, and the greatest part of the barbarians perished from hunger, cold, and pestilence ;
and the survivors, disheartened at the length of the siege, retired.
On their return to their own country, the Saracens attacked the Bulgarians, a nation on the Danube, but sustaining another defeat, were forced to seek refuge on board their ships.
They had scarcely gained the offing, when a violent storm suddenly arose, and immense numbers either perished in the waves, or, their vessels being dashed to pieces on the shore, were massacred by the natives.
King Liutprand, hearing that the Saracens had not contented themselves with ravaging Sardinia, but had even dared to defile the spot to which the remains of St. Augustine, profane bishop, had been formerly translated in order to protect them from the fury of the barbarians, and where they were reverently interred, sent to claim them;
and having obtained them for a large sum of money, ordered them to be transferred to Pavia, where they were again buried with all the honours due to so great a father of the church.
1UP to this point I have followed the chronography of the Englishman Bede, who has brought down his work to the year 734 of the incarnation of our Lord.
2
This Bede, a priest, and Paul, of Mount Cassino, both monks, and men of deep learning, among other useful works, have published in five books the history of their respective nations;
they have clearly made known to us whence the Lombards and English came, and how the former subdued Italy, while the latter occupied Britain.3
Henceforth I shall be forced to make laborious researches through the writings of other fathers of the church, while I endeavour to bring my history of past events down to the present day, embittered by so many and such varied calamities, while two prelates have ambitiously contended during the last six years for the pontifical chair, and, since the demise of Henry I. king of England, Stephen of Blois, his nephew, and Geoffry of Anjou, his son-in-law, are contending for the crown and venting their fury, to the common loss, by having recourse to arms, as well as by threats.
1Constantine, the son of Leo, reigned fifty-eight years.
2
Then Hugh, archbishop of Rouen, gloriously filled the sees of Paris and Bayeux, and governed the abbeys of Jumièges and Fontenelle.
Carloman and Pepin become mayors of the palace, and Remi, their brother, having ejected Ragen­ froi, obtains the archbishopric of Rouen.
Constantine and Abdallah, the emir of the Saracens, are rivals in cruelty towards the orthodox followers of Christ.
Constantine assembled at Constantinople a council of three hundred and thirty bishops.
3In the year 754 of our Lord's incarnation, Stephen, the pope, no longer able to bear the persecutions of Astolph, king of the Lombards, escaped to France and was honourably received by the inhabitants, but fell sick at Paris.
As soon as he was convalescent, he consecrated an altar in the church of St. Denys, crowned Pepin and his two sons, Charles and Carloman;
and committed the holy church to their protection against her enemies.
4Pepin, king of the French, after having held the reins of government -with a strong hand for sixteen years, died on the eighth of the calends of October [24th September].
He left his crown to his son Charlemagne, who reigned forty- seven years, and whose conduct, both of secular and eccle­ siastical affairs, was memorable.
His virtues were great in the sight of God and man;
so that numbers relate his acts with admiration, and celebrate them before attentive hearers.
He marched to Rome at the head of an army of Franks, and, on his return, seized Desiderius, king of the LOIn bards, and made himself master of Pavia and other towns in Italy.
He dismantled Pampeluna, took Saragossa sword in hand, annihilated, in the numerous battles he ion, not only the Saxons but the Spaniards and Saracens, and humbled the infidel power by Christian valour, raising, in the name of Christ, the standard of the cross.
1Leo, the son of Constantine, reigned five years.
2 Charle­ magne went a second time to Rome, and, then overran with his army Capua and Apulia.
3Constantine reigned seventeen years jointly with his mother Irene.
During his reign, an inhabitant of Con­ stantinople discovered a stone chest, enclosing the body of a man, and bearing this inscription:
" Christ will be born of the Virgin Mary, and I believe in him.
When Constantine and Irene are emperors, the sun shall see me again."
Char­ lemagne crossed Germany to the frontiers of Bavaria, which he conquered in three years.
He then marched against a tribe of the slaves called the Wiltzes, and in the following year ravaged Hungary.
1In these times, Adrian [I.] and Leo [III.]
governed the holy see forty-eight years, signalizing their pontificates by their great virtues and services to the church.
Constantine and Leo, and another Constantine, were then emperors, as we have already stated.
2
From the time of Constantine the Great, the son of Helena, who founded Constantinople, until the reign of Constantine, the son of Irene, the emperor of Constantinople governed the Roman empire, and gave laws to Italy and many other nations speaking different languages.
Several of these emperors were heretics, and were not raised to the throne by the lawful exercise of the rights of the people, nor legiti­ mately elected by the people, but unjustly usurped it by cruel murders of their masters or their relations ;
nor were they able to defend one half of so vast an empire against the attacks of the barbarians, who were everywhere in arms against it.
In consequence, Pope Leo, and an assembly of the senators and people of Rome, concerted measures for the safety of the state, and by unanimous resolve threw off the yoke of the emperors of Constantinople, and elected Char­ lemagne, the powerful king of the Franks, who had long protected them with great valour, to be emperor of Rome.
Thus, in the fifth year of Pope Leo, which corresponds with the year 808 of the incarnation of our Lord, king Charle­ magne became the eighty-third emperor from Augustus, and the Romans proclaimed him by that august name.
He condemned to death the assailants of Pope Leo, by whom he had been consecrated;
but at the pope's request he spared their lives, and only banished them to France.
About the same time, a great earthquake shook nearly the whole continent of Italy, and threw down the greater part of the roof and timber-work of the church of St. Paul the apostle.
1Nicephorus I., brother of Irene, reigned six years.
He made peace with Charlemagne, to whom Aaron also, the king of the Persians, sent ambassadors with presents to induce him to join in friendship with him.
2Michael, the son-in-law of Nicepborus, reigned three years.
He sent ambassadors to the emperor Charlemagne to renew their alliance.
Leo, son of Bardas, reigned six years.
Charlemagne died at Aix-la-Chapelle;
and Louis the Pious, his SOIl by Hilde­ garde, daughter of Witikind, king of the Saxons, succeeded to the empire which he governed for twenty-seven years with spirit.
During his reign a storm of troubles swept the world.
Pascal, the hundredth pope from Peter, crowned Louis at Rome on Easter day.
3
Theophilus reigned eleven years.
Lothaire rebelled against his father Lewis, and disturbed the world by his repeated perfidies.
The Normans now ravaged Britain and other countries, and the bodies of Samson, Philibert, and many other saints, were translated for fear of the pagans.
4Michael, son of Theophilus, reigned twenty-seven years.
In the second year of his reign, the Emperor Lewis died on the 12th of the calends of July [20th June].
He was buried by his brother Drogo, archbishop of Metz.
Three years afterwards, that is to say, in the year of our Lord 842, the battle of Fontenay, near Auxerre, was fought, on the sixth of the calends of July [26th June], between his three sons, Lewis, Lothaire, and Charles the Bald, in which Christian nations destroyed each other with great slaughter on both sides.
At last victory declared in favour of Charles
In the same year the Normans pillaged Rouen, and burned the abbey of St. Ouen, the bishop, on the ides [15th] of May.
1Basil, after having put to death Michael, his sovereign and master, reigned twenty years.
A dreadful famine and consequent mortality, with a murrain among cattle, caused great calamities throughout the world.
On the death of King Lewis, Rollo penetrated into Neustria, and on the 15th of the calends of December [17th November], in the year of our Lord 876 entered Normandy, and carried on a war with the Franks, which lasted thirty-seven years, until he was baptized by Franco, archbishop of Rouen.
2Leo and Alexander, the sons of Basil, reigned twenty- two years.
Charles the Fat was crowned emperor on the death of Arnold, king of Germany, and reigned ten years.
In the year of our Lord 900, King Zwintibold killed the son of Arnold.
At this time Rollo laid siege to Chartres;
but Gualtelm, the bishop, a holy man, issued forth carrying the tunic of St. Mary, mother of God, and with the assist­ ance of Heaven, put the enemies to flight, and delivered the city.
He had appealed for succour to Richard, duke of Burgundy, and Ebles, earl of Poictiers.
The enemy being routed, the Christians rejoiced at the victory God had wroughtAlexander [after the death of his brother] reigned one year.
The Huns devastated Saxony and Thuringia [A.D. 908].
Constantine [Porphyrogenitus], son of Leo, reigned with Zoe, his mother, ten years.
In the third year of his reign, Lewis [III.], son of Arnold, departed this life, and Conrad, the son of Conrad, became emperor, and reigned seven years.
2Romanus, the Armenian, reigned, jointly with Constantine before mentioned, twenty-seven years.
In their time Rollo embraced Christianity, and concluded a peace with Charles, king of the Franks, receiving in marriage Gisela, his daugh­ ter.
3
When Henry was emperor, king Charles died at Peronne, where he was imprisoned by Herbert, count of Vermandois, and France was disturbed by great dissensions.
Five years afterwards, Louis, the son of Charles, married Grerberga, the daughter of Henry, emperor of Germany.
1Constantine [VII.] associated with himself Romanus, his son, while yet a boy, and reigned fifteen years.
At the same period Otho, son of Henry, began his reign, which lasted thirty-six years;
his wife was the sister of Athelstan, king of England.
2
In those days, William Long-sword defeated Ralph, count of Evreux, on the spot which was called Battle-mead, and was himself assassinated eight years afterwards, on the sixteenth of the calends of Janu­ ary (17th December), by Arnold, earl of Flanders.
Richard I., the son of William Long-sword, succeeded his father, and governed his states with vigour fifty-four years, per­ forming many great actions.
3Stephen and Constantine [VIII.], the sons of Romanus, expelled their father from the throne.
But Constantine in turn deposed them both, and reigned sixteen years with his son Romanus.
Edgar, son of Edmund, now governed the English, and was a bountiful patron to the servants of God, faithfully obeying his teachers in all that appertained to the edification of the church.
In.
his reign Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury, Oswald, archbishop of York, and Ethelwold, bishop of Winchester, were illustrious for their sanctity and learning, governing the people committed to their charge with diligence and happy effects.
They used such efforts to encourage the growth of religious insitutions that by their means twenty-six monasteries and nunneries were founded in England.
The ravages of the Danes, who some years before had martyred St. Edmund, king of the East- Angles, had spread desolation among Christ's flock through­ out nearly the whole island of Britain, churches and monas­ teries being ruined, and the Lord's flock torn to pieces or dispersed as if they had been the prey of wolves.
1Nicephorus was emperor ten years.
It was a period of general disorder;
ambitious nobles putting themselves at the head of their vassals in arms for mutual hostilities.
2After the death of Nicephorus, who was assassinated at the instigation of his own wife, John [Zimisces] ascended the throne, and his niece, Theophania, married the emperor Otho.
He died in the fifth year of his reign, leaving the crown to his son Otho III., who reigned eighteen years.
3
At this period, Hugh the Great and other French lords rebelled against Lewis, their king;
the duke following the example of his father Robert, who revolted against Charles the Simple, and caused himself to be anointed king.
Charles, the rightful sovereign, perceiving with what contempt lie was treated by the perjured duke, did not allow a year to elapse before he attacked the rebel with troops assembled from all quarters, with which he fell upon and defeated and killed him at the battle of Soissons.
4
In the month of May, on a Friday, a shower of blood fell upon the workmen in the fields.
The same year [954], in the month of September, Lewis [d'Outremer] died, after having suffered much adversity, and was buried at Rheims, in the church of St. Remi.
1 Lothaire, his son, was crowned at Rheims, and ably governed the kingdom for the space of seven years.
At this time Hugh the Great, of Orleans, duke of France, raised himself above all the nobles of France by his riches and power.
He married the daughter of the emperor Otho, by whom he had three sons, Hugh, Otho, and Henry, and a daughter of the name of Emma, who married Richard the elder, duke of Normandy, but died without children.
2
In the second year of the reign of Lothaire, in the month of August, Hugh the Great besieged the town of Poictiers ;
but through the merits of St. Hilary, bishop and patron of the town, the Lord caused an awful thunder, while a violent whirlwind rent the duke's tent, who, struck with a panic, as well as his army, immediately raised the siege and re­ treated.
3
The same year, Gislebert, duke of Burgundy de­ parted this life, and Otho, his son-in-law, the son of Hugh the Great, obtained possession of the duchy, but dying without children not long afterwards, he was succeeded by his brother Henry.
Then Ansegise, bishop of Troyes, was driven from his see by Earl Robert, and repaired to the court of the emperor Otho in Saxony.
Returning thence at the head of an army of Saxons, he laid siege to Troyes which held out for a considerable time, although he was ably assisted by the forces of the chiefs, Helpo and Bruno.
One day as they were on an expedition to plunder the town of Sens, archbishop Archambauld, with the aged count Raynard, and their troops, encountered them, fighting a battle in which duke Helpo and a number of the Saxons, were slain.
His colleague, Bruno, who was an eye-witness of their defeat, raised the siege, and returned to his own country in great sorrow.
1King Lothaire recovered the kingdom of Lorraine;
he repaired, attended by a numerous army, to the palace at Aix-la-Chapelle, where the emperor Otho resided with his queen:
he entered at the hour of dinner, no one trying to prevent him;
for Otho, his wife and attend­ ants, saved themselves by flight, and quietly left him in possession of the palace.
Lothaire after this success re­ turned to France, and the emperor, assembling an army, appeared before Paris, and set fire to one of the suburbs, but his nephew with many of his followers fell by the swords of the French.
2
Lothaire, therefore, calling to his assist­ ance Hugh, duke of France, and Henry, duke of Burgundy, attacked their enemies, whom he defeated and pursued as far as Soissons.
The terrified fugitives in their haste threw themselves headlong into the river Airne, and as they were not acquainted with the fords, numbers perished;
indeed those who were drowned in the river were more numerous than those who fell by the sword.
Its waters were swollen, and such multitudes perished in the current that its course was almost choked by their corpses.
1 King Lothaire continued the pursuit of the enemy three days and three nights.
In the end of the same year, contrary to the wishes of his officers and his army, Lothaire concluded a peace with the emperor at Rheims, and ceded to him Lor­ raine, to the great grief of the French.
2King Lothaire died in the year of our Lord 976, and was interred at Rheims in the church of St. Remi.
His son Lewis filled the throne eleven years, and at his death was buried in the church of St. Cornelius, the martyr, at Compiegne.
3 Charles, his brother, claimed the throne ;
but Hugh the Great [Hugh Capet], son of Hugh the Great, opposed him, and, having raised a numerous army, sat down before Laon, where Charles resided with his queen.
The king, full of indignation, made a sally at the head of the garrison, attacked and put to flight the army of Hugh, and burnt their huts.
The duke, perceiving that Charles was not to be subdued by open warfare, concerted measures with Ascelin, bishop of Laon, who was the king's adviser.
The bishop, forgetting his age and profession, and not considering that death was approaching, followed the ex­ ample of Achitophel and Judas, and did not blush to become a traitor.
During the night, when all the inhabitants were asleep, he admitted Hugh into the town, who made Charles and his wife, the daughter of Herbert, earl of Troyes, prisoners, and condemned them to perpetual captivity in the tower of Orleans.
There, Charles became the father of two children, Lewis and Charles;
but from that time the posterity of Charlemagne ceased to reign in France.
1In the year of our Lord 983, Hugh, the duke, was anointed king at Rheims.
In the same year, Robert his son was crowned king, and reigned thirty-eight years.
2
Hugh was induced by a vision to commit this great crime.
St. Valery appeared to him when he was duke at Lutetia, the city of the Parisii.
He revealed to him in a dream who he was, and what he wanted, commanding him to undertake an expedition against Arnold, earl of Flanders, and take his body out of the monastery of Sithieu, where that of St. Berlin also lies, and restore it to the convent of Leuconaüs in the Vimeux.
He then promised him that, if he faithfully obeyed his orders, he and his posterity to the seventh generation should wear the crown of France.
Hugh readily obeyed the orders of the saint, and, by the will of God, terrified Arnold with his impetuous courage, recovered and reverently restored to their tombs the bodies of the vene­ rable saints Valery and Riquier, which had been carried away by 'a certain clerk named Erchambald, bribed by the offer of a large sum of money.
The duke himself repaired to Leuconaüs with the great men of his court, and deposited the remains of St. Valery in a monastery situate on the banks of the Somme, and having driven out the secular canons, filled their places with regular monks.
Not long afterwards, as already stated, he usurped the throne, which his descendants have filled to the present day;
for four kings of his race have reigned up to this moment, namely, Robert, Henry, Philip, and Lewis.
1 Hugh, at the com­ mencement of his reign, convoked a synod at Rheims, to which he invited Sewin, archbishop of Sens, with his suffra­ gans, and ordered Arnold, archbishop of Rheims, to be degraded;
declaring that according to the canons of the church the son of a concubine could not be a bishop.
But in truth he was jealous of Arnold, because he had the royal blood of Charlemagne in his veins, being the brother of king Lothaire, although the son of a concubine.
He was not however for this reason the less worthy and unassuming, but was renowned for his great virtues.
But the venerable Sewin feared God more than the king;
he therefore refused to be a party to the unjust degradation of Arnold;
what was more, as far as lay in his power, he opposed the king's design.
His opposition only incensed the king against himself and induced him to persist in his unjust project.
However, some other bishops were worked on by their fears, though with great reluctance, to pronounce the sentence of degradation on Arnold, and consecrated in his place Ger­ bert, a monk and philosopher, who had been tutor to king Robert.
In this manner, by the imperious command of the king, Arnold was deposed, expelled ignominiously from the church of the blessed Mary, mother of God, and imprisoned at Orleans for three years.
These outrages were soon brought to the knowledge of the pope, who, being highly indignant, suspended the bishops who had deposed Arnold and put Gerbert in his place.
He also sent Leo, an abbot, into France, as the legate of the apostolical see, to remedy these irregular proceedings.
The legate began his labours by first paying a visit to Sewin at Sens, and communicated to him the orders of the holy see, knowing him to be a more strict observer of what was right than the rest.
In obedience to the apostolic commands, another council was assembled at Rheims, and archbishop Arnold was released from custody, and restored to his see with great honour.
The pleadings between the prelate Gerbert, and abbot Leo are considered of great importance, and are carefully filed among the records of the archbishops of Rheims.
1 Gerbert was very well read in sacred and profane literature, and had many illustrious and noble pupils in his school, amongst whom were, King Robert, Leotheric, archbishop of Sens;
Remi, bishop [monk] of Auxerre;
Haimond, and Hubold, and several others who rank high on the list of learned men.
Bishop Bern!
composed a good commentary on the mass, and published a useful edition of the work of the grammarian Donatus.
Haimond wrote a valuable expo­ sition on St. Paul's epistles, and commented on the gospels and other parts of the holy scriptures.
Hubold, who was skilled in music, made the churches echo with the praises of the Creator, composing a sweet office in praise of the Holy Trinity, besides a number of hymns in honour of God and his saints.
2
These, and many others received instruc- tions from Gerbert, and, by their varied knowledge in after days rendered the greatest services to the church of God.
Degraded from the archiepiscopal throne of Rheims, which he had unjustly usurped, he quitted France with shame and indignation, and repaired to the court of the emperor Otho, by whom, and the people of Ravenna, he was pro­ moted to the archiepiscopal see of that town.
A few years afterwards, he was translated to the apostolic see, being raised to the papal dignity under the name of Silvester [II.] in the year 909.
It is related that when Gerbert was master of a school, he had a conference with the devil, and inquired of him what his future career was to be.
He immediately received the following ambiguous answrer:
— Transit ab R. Gerbertus ad R. post papa vigens R.1 Translated from R, you still will be R, and as pope shall be R.
This oracle was too obscure to be then understood ;
but we clearly see that after a while it was fulfilled, for Gerbert passed from the see of Rheims to that of Ravenna, and afterwards was elected pope at Rome.
In the year of our Lord 1002, the emperor Otho died, and was succeeded by Henry [II.]
Afterwards, that is to say in 1024, Cono [Conrad II.] became emperor.
In the third year of his reign, Richard II.
put off mortality.
His zeal for religion justly gained him the title of father of the monks.
2During the reign of Ethelred the son of Edgar, many disastrous events happened in England.
Sweyn, king of the Danes, having assembled a numerous fleet, invaded the country, upon which king Ethelred, being deserted by his own subjects, who went over to the Danes, escaped into Normandy with his wife and sons.
Emma, his queen, was the sister of Richard I. [II.], SOIl of Gunnor and duke of Normandy, and of Robert, archbishop of Rouen.
Not long afterwards, the heathen king, Sweyn, was killed by St. Edmund, king and martyr, and his body was embalmed, and carried to Denmark.
The Danes were still pagans, and were terrified at the death of their fierce chief, whose corpse could not be buried in English ground.
However, king Ethelred, having heard the report of Sweyn's death, immediately returned to his own country, and, by fair words and promises, drew to him those who had de­ serted his standard, and encouraged them to defend them­ selves better than they had hitherto done.
But Canute, the son of Sweyn, was highly incensed at the flight of his troops, who had abandoned in such a cowardly manner the noble kingdom of England, which they had already subdued;
he therefore equipped a powerful fleet, and Olave, king of Norway, with Lacman, king of Sweden, crossing over to England, laid siege to London.
At that time king Ethelred was lying sick, and soon afterwards died there ;
and Edmund, his son, surnamed Ironside, was raised to the throne.
Many battles were fought between the English and the Danes with uncertain results, and much blood was shed on both sides.
At last, through the well-directed efforts of some prudent men, the two princes agreed on the terms of peace so necessary to the welfare of their subjects.
Canute em­ braced Christianity, and received for his wife Emma, the widow of King Ethelred, with one-half of the kingdom.
By her he had Hardicanutc, who became king of England, and Gunnilda, who married Henry III., emperor of the Romans.
1At the instigation of Satan, who never rests from stirring deadly feuds among men, King Edmund, after a reign of seven years, was murdered in a privy by the treachery of the cruel Edric Streon;
and Canute obtained the sove­ reignty of the whole of England, which he enjoyed until his death.
He sent to Denmark Edward and Edmund, the sons of Edmund II., two amiable young princes,1 and re­ quested Sweyn his brother, king of the Danes, to put them to death.
However, he refused to be a party to the murder of these innocent children;
and took an opportunity of de­ livering them as hostages to the king of the Huns, passing them off as his nephews.
There Child Edmund prematurely died, but Edward, by God's permission, obtained the crown of Hungary, with the hand of the king's daughter, and became the father of three children, Edgar Atheling,2 Margaret, queen of the Scots, and Christina, who became a nun.
Edward, the son of king Ethelred, having recovered his father's throne, invited them over to England, and brought them up with as much care as if they had been his own children.
1
In the year of our Lord 1031, Robert, king of the French, died, and Henry his son, supported by Robert, duke of Normandy, secured the throne notwithstanding the oppo­ sition of Queen Constance and his younger brother Robert, and others of the French.
His reign lasted twenty-nine years.
2Robert, duke of Normandy, died on the calends [1st] of July, in the fifth year of his reign, at Nice, a town of Bithynia, on his return from Jerusalem, and William the bastard, his son, a boy only eight years old, succeeded to his dukedom, which he ably governed for fifty years.
3
However, during his childhood, the Normans, being natu­ rally in an unsettled state, there was a long civil war, in which many of the nobility as well as the commons perished.
Gislebert, count of Brionne, Osbern, high-steward of Nor­ mandy ;
Vauquelin de Ferrieres, Hugh de Montfort, Roger of Spain, Robert de Grantemesnil, Turketil, guardian of the young duke, and many others, fell in these mutual quarrels.
1
Guy, son of Reynold, duke of Burgundy, by a daughter of Richard II., although William had conferred an earldom upon him, took up arms against him, and by dint of promises, drew over to his party a great number of the Normans, who were ripe for revolt.
Supported by these, he menaced the young prince with the loss of his duchy, and he was forced to fly to Poissy, where he threw himself at the feet of Henry, king of France, and implored his aid against his traitorous nobles and relations.
Henry, a generous prince, had compassion on one so young and friendless, and having assembled the flower of the French army, marched into Normandy to lend him his aid.
1
In the year of our Lord 1039, Conrad the emperor died, and Henry, his son, succeeded him, who reigned seventeen years.
In the fourth year of his reign, there was a general mortality.
2
In the year 10-17 was fought the bloody battle of Vales­ dunes, in which Guy, who could not withstand the impetuous attack of King Henry and Duke William, was defeated and obliged to quit the field and fly with his troops, covered with shame and having suffered considerable loss.
1
In those days Bruno, bishop of Toul, repaired to Rome as ambassador from Lorraine.
While on the road, one night as he was praying, he heard angels singing:
—“ I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil.”
2 Bruno having attained the end of his journey, was honourably received by Pope Damasus, and ordained cardinal-bishop in a conclave.
He was noble in person as well as descent, wise and eloquent, and adorned with many virtues.
The same year Pope Damasus died, and Bruno, who took the name of Leo, was elected pope.
He made great efforts to revise the decisions of the holy canons which had fallen into disuse in times past, through the negligence of the kings and pontiffs already mentioned, and were almost forgotten.
He therefore held a very important council at Rheims in the year 1050, in which chastity and righteousness were enforced in the ministers of God, and several decrees necessary to the welfare of the church renewed, though the bishops and priests were ignorant of their existence.
He also, at the request of Hérimart, the abbot, consecrated the church of St. Remigius, archbishop of Rheims, on the calends [1st] of October, assisted and translated the body of the same bishop, whose feast is celebrated every year in France with great pomp on the first of October.
3
The following year, the monastery of St. Evroult at Ouche was repaired by William, the son of Geroie, and his nephews, Hugh do Grantemesnil, and Robert his brother;
the venerable monk of Jumieges, Theoderic, was the first abbot.
1
In those days, a violent animosity, which became the origin of a long war, broke out between the king of the French and the duke of the Normans.
William D'Arques, uncle of the duke, had rebelled against him, and by the advice of Mauger, his brother, archbishop of Rouen, had requested the aid of King Henry.
The brave duke immediately in­ vested the town of Arques, and, marching against Engelran, count of Ponthieu, who attempted to throw relief into the place, killed the earl, and, after taking Arques, disinherited his uncle, and ordered Mauger, the author of these dissen­ sions, to be degraded.
The king of France chafed with indignation upon hearing this news, and, in 1054, entered the territory of Evreux, at the head of a numerous army, while he made his brother Eudes cross the Seine with a strong force and march into Beauvais.
In those circum­ stances, Duke William hung upon the king's flank with a powerful army, having before detached against Eudes the troops of the Cauchois, under the orders of Robert, count d'Eu, and Roger de Mortemer.
They came up with the French, and gave them battle at Mortemer, defeating them with dreadful slaughter on both sides, and Guy, count of Ponthieu, who had come to revenge the death of his brother, was made prisoner.
The Normans, hastened to announce the victory to their duke in great triumph.
The king of France was covered with shame on hearing that his troops were beaten by the Normans, and retired suddenly in great sorrow to his own dominions.
Some time afterwards, the faithful ministers of peace interposed between the contend­ ing princes, and Guy and the other prisoners having been released, the king and the duke concluded a peace to the extreme satisfaction of their subjects.
2
In the year of our Lord 1060, Henry, king of the French, departed this life, and his son Philip who succeeded him, held the sceptre of France forty-seven years.
1
In the sixth year of his reign, Edward, son of Ethelred, and king of England, being dead Harold, the son of Godwin, usurped the throne of England.
The following year a comet was seen.
3 William, Duke of Normandy, crossed the sea in the autumn, and on the second of the ides [14th] of October fought with Harold, who, being slain in the battle, William became king.
He was crowned on Christmas-day, and filled the throne twenty years and eight months.
The holy church in his time increased and was exalted, under the direction of religious men and good rulers ;
for Mau­ rillius, John and William filled the metropolitan see of Rouen, Lanfranc was archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of York ;
the monasteries and bishoprics were entrusted to the care of godly fathers and superiors.
In the year of our Lord 1087, King William died, after whom William Rufus, his son, reigned twelve years and ten months.
4About this period, in 1095, pope Urban held a nume­ rously attended council at Clermont, at which he exhorted all Christians to join the crusade and deliver Jerusalem from the pagans.
Drought, famine, and pestilence, at that time desolated the world.
1In the year of our Lord 1099, Jerusalem was captured by the holy pilgrims from the infidel tribes who had long held possession of it.
Then died Pope Urban [II.], and Pascal [II.] succeeded him.
2
The following year Wil­ liam Rufus, king of England, was struck by an arrow which killed him as he was hunting in the New Forest.
His brother Henry [I.] succeeded him, and reigned thirty-five years and four months.
In the seventh year of his reign be fought the battle of Tinchebrai, in which he took prisoner Robert, his brother, duke of Normandy, and became master of the whole duchy.
Then the emperor Henry died on the seventh of the ides [7th] of August, and Charles Henry his son succeeded him.
Three years afterwards, Philip, king of the French, departed this life, and Louis Thibaut obtained the crown, and has now reigned twenty-nine years.
The next year Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, and Hugh, abbot of Cluni, departed this life, and were soon followed by William, archbishop of Rouen.
During these three years, a horrible famine in France, and a great number of persons were debilitated by attacks of erysipelas.
2
In the year of our Lord 1118, on the eve of Christmas, a violent gale of wind passed over the west of Europe, and many houses and forest-trees were blown down.
The next year, war broke out between Henry, king of England, and Lewis, the French king;
the battle of Bremulle, was fought on the thirteenth of the calends of September [20th Au­ gust], in which the English and Normans gained the victory over the French army who were routed.
The same year Pope Calixtus [II.] held a synod of many bishops, and used all his endeavours to put an end to the contest.
Peace having been at last made between the two kings, as the king of England was returning to his own country, his two sons William and Richard, with a great number of the nobility from several countries, perished by shipwreck.
1
In the year of our Lord 1123, the first indiction, Amauri, count of Evreux, and Valeran, count of Meulan, and some others associated with them, having rebelled against their sovereign, King Henry, beseiged, took, and burnt to the ground their towns of Montfort, Brionne, and Pont-Aude­ mer.
After many serious losses, count Waleran was taken prisoner in battle, with eighty of his soldiers, and kept five years in captivity by King Henry, who had brought him up, and against whom he had now the presumption to take arms.
1In the year of our Lord 1125, a great change occurred among the reigning princes.
The emperor Charles Henry V. died, and Lothaire, duke of Saxony, succeeded to the empire.
At the same time, William, duke of Poictiers, and William, duke of Apulia, two illustrious princes, also departed this life;
and before three years had elapsed, Charles duke [count] of Flanders, was assassinated in a church while hearing mass, on the calends [1st] of March.
He was succeeded by William, the son of Robert, duke of Nor­ mandy, who was killed the following year at Alost.
Then also died Gormond, patriarch of Jerusalem, and Geoffry, archbishop of Rouen.
1
In the year 1130 from the incar­ nation of our Saviour, Baldwin II.
king of Jerusalem died on the 18th of the calends of September [15th August], and was succeeded by Fulk count of Anjou, his son-in law.
Two years afterwards, Pope Honorius died at Rome;
and soon after this event, a deplorable schism troubled the church ;
for the deacon Gregory, a native of Pavia, was chosen pope during the night by a few of his partisans, assuming the name of Innocent;
and the church established in the western parts of Europe received and submitted to him;
but three days afterwards Peter, the son of Leo, was en­ throned, and called Anaclete.
Being supported by brothers, relations, and friends, who were extremely powerful, he has now retained undisturbed possession of the city of Rome, and the revenues and domains of the papacy for seven years;
Apulia, Sicily, and a great part of Christendom acknowledging his rule.
2
In the year of our Lord 1136, in the 14th indiction, Henry, king of England and duke of Normandy, a firm friend of peace and justice, a faithful worshipper of God, the protector of the weak, and zealous defender of the holy church, died on the calends [1st] of December, at the castle of Lions.
His body, after being embalmed, was carried to England, and buried in the church of the Holy Trinity in the abbey of Reading, which he had founded and given to the monks.
1 Stephen of Blois, his nephew, a son of his sister Adela, succeeded him on the throne, and has now completed the sixth year of his reign,2 which has been marked by important events, pregnant with serious losses and disasters;
for Stephen, having fought a battle at Lin­ coln' with the barons who were in arms against him, was defeated and taken prisoner, and is now detained a wretched captive in the prison of Robert at Bristol.
4
In the year of our Lord 1138, Peter Anaclete died sud­ denly.
The emperor Lothaire1 also breathed his last while on his way back from Apulia, which he had conquered;
his successor, Conrad, was nephew to the emperor Charles Henry.
Nevertheless Roger, king of Sicily, having followed the steps of Conrad, entered Apulia, and, on the decease of Ralph, the brave duke, to whom the pope and emperor had entrusted the defence of the country, recaptured all the towns which had been taken from him.
However, he compelled the pope, though very reluctantly and with great regret, to grant him the investiture of the kingdom of Sicily and duchy of Apulia, and, having received his absolu­ tioni appointed his son Roger duke of Apulia.
2
Following in the steps of my predecessors, and endea­ vouring to write annals, I have now, in this first book of my Ecclesiastical History, begun the thread of my narrative with the incarnation of our Saviour, and have brought it down, through the succession of emperors and kings to the present day, when the emperor John, son of Alexis, reigns at Constantinople, Lothaire governs the Germans, Louis the French, Stephen the English, and the ex-monk Remi­ gins the Spaniards.
3
In my second book, I propose by God's help to inquire what the old doctors have written and scribes1 have copied, respecting the holy apostles and apo­ stolic men, meaning to make a short abridgment of their acts, as the Holy Spirit shall vouchsafe to inspire me.
At the request of my superiors, I shall diligently, with a faithful pen, trace the series of the popes of Rome and their fellow labourers in the Lord's vineyard.
From Peter, to whom first the Lord Jesus Christ said:
“I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,”2 to Pope Innocent, who now governs the apostolic see, we reckon one hundred and forty-one bishops of Rome.
I hope to be able to give to the world, in my next book, some account of all these popes who are mentioned in the work called "
The Acts of the Popes."WHEN the fulness of time was come, the divine grace, mercifully announced to mankind the saving visitation which was provided before the creation of the world, and towards its last age illuminated the dark recesses of the hearts of men with the rays of a new light.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, as the sublime voice of the holy gospel truly informs us, in the fifteenth year of the emperor Tiberius Cæsar, was baptized by John in the river Jordan;
and the true sun shone forth by visible signs and wonders for three years and a half, and manifested to the world his divine nature, by which be is co-equal, consubstantial, and co- eternal, with the Father and the Holy Ghost.
Afterwards, in his mercy, he suffered on the cross in the thirty-third year of his age,1 for the salvation of man;
and, having destroyed death, which for five thousand years had kept mankind fast bound in the chains of a just damnation, be despoiled hell, and, having vanquished Satan, the old serpent, on the third day rose triumphantly from the dead.
Lastly, on the fortieth day, after he had confirmed the belief of the faithful witnesses in his resurrection, by often showing him­ self to them openly, and commanded them to preach the gospel to all nations, giving them power to perform miracles, he led the disciples forth as far as Bethany, and, standing on mount Olivet, blessed them, and while they beheld with joy, ascended into heaven.
Ten days afterwards, while his friends were fasting and continuing in prayer with one accord, he sent to them the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and according to his promise instantly, by an internal unction, he taught them all things, gloriously filled them with all spiritual powers, strengthened them against all the assaults of their enemies, and made them invincible champions of the faith and teachers of all nations.
Luke, a Syrian by birth, a physician by profession, and a faithful disciple of Christ, full of the grace of the Holy Spirit, after having written his gospel for the instruction of the faithful in Greece, added the noble volume of the Acts of the Apostles, which he addressed to Theophilus.
The word means a lover of God, and may be applied to all who are studious and intelligent, and unceasingly devoted to meditation on the divine law.
To such the word of God is justly addressed, and they eagerly receive it and hold it fast with sincere affection.
The gospel, that is to say, the good tidings, penetrate their hearts, the triumphs of the invincible army of apostles and martyrs are recounted to them because they are accounted worthy to be made par­ takers of the heavenly mysteries.
1The eloquent Arator also, sub-deacon of the see of Rome, diligently copied the narrative of St. Luke, making it the substance of a metrical composition, in a poem be presented to Pope Vigilius, remarkable for the beauty of its melodious versification;
leaving to future generations, a noble monu­ ment of his genius.
2
I aim at tracing the course of such illustrious precursors as these, although, like a lame mail halting by the way, I can only follow them with slow and distant steps;
but desiring to treat of the apostles and their blessed fellow combatants for the faith, with the materials which they have furnished.
Luke tells us, in his lucid narrative, that, on the holy day of pentecost, the apostles were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and spoke, in the different gentile languages, of the wonderful works of God, to the great amazement of the Jews, who were then assembled from various parts of the world.
But while their enemies showed their hatred, and muttered, “ These men are full of new wine," Peter, in­ flamed with zeal for the faith, stood up with the eleven, and, lifting up his voice, explained that the coming of the Holy Ghost the Comforter had been foretold long before by the prophet Joel.
He supported the truth of his declaration, that Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God by miracles, and wonders and signs, was raised from the dead three days after his passion on the cross, by reference to predictions in the Psalms.
The Jews were pricked in their heart, and, receiv­ ing the word to the salvation of their souls, were baptized;
and the same day there were added about three thousand souls to the number of the believers.
1
Such was the origin of the primitive church, on which the heavenly grace was abundantly bestowed.
Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles at Jerusalem, and all those who saw these extraordinary things trembled with fear.
And they that believed lived together, and had all things common.
They sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
Every day the faithful increased in virtue, while the Lord added continually to the number of those who were to be saved.
Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the ninth hour, and there saw a beggar who bad been lame from his mother's womb.
Peter told the indigent man that he possessed no earthly riches, but offered him some­ thing more valuable;
and, taking him by the hand, presently healed him in the name of Jesus Christ.
Immediately his feet and ankle-bones received strength, so that he leaped up and ran, and entered with them into the temple, rejoicing and praising God before all the people, who were filled with wonder and amazement when they saw this special miracle performed in the name of Jesus Christ on the lame man, who was laid daily at the Beautiful Gate of the temple.
While the apostles were thus employed, the people ran together to Solomon's porch, to see him who had just been healed by the virtue of the name of Christ.
Seeing the multitude assembled, Peter opened his mouth and humbly disclaimed the merit of the cure, which he wholly ascribed to the divine nature of Jesus Christ.
Mildly rebuking the Jews who bad persecuted him, and trusting in the inex­ haustible mercy of his Master, he mildly excused them, because they did it through ignorance.
At the end of his discourse, he exhorted them to repent of their sins, and proved to them in the clearest manner that the Saviour and true Prophet had already come, as Moses, and Samuel, and all the prophets had predicted long beforeAs they spake unto the people, the priests, and the cap­ tain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, and, laying hands upon them, put them in hold;
for, being filled with the bitterness of iniquity, they were grieved that the apostles taught the people, and preached, through Jesus, the resurrection from the dead.
Many of them which beard the word believed;
and the number of the men was about five thousand.
On the morrow, Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, and the rulers, and elders, and scribes, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
And when they bad set them in the midst, they asked:
" By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?"
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, testified clearly that the impotent man was made whole by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and that there was none other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved.
Now when their adversaries saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and were grieved;
and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against the miracle, as it was manifest to all who were in Jerusalem, they were consumed with rage.
Afterwards, having taken counsel, they called the apostles, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John refused to obey their injunction, saying with great boldness :
“Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God;
judge ye.
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."
The assembly then sent them away with threats, but not daring to punish them, as they perceived that the great miracle which they had just performed had gained them the favour of the people.
On regaining their liberty, the apostles went to their own company, and reported all that had befallen them.
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and, inspired with holy zeal, offered a signal prayer of thanks to God.
And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost;
and the nets spread by their holy preaching drew many from the abyss of error to the light of faith and righteousness.
1
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul:
neither said any that aught of the things which he possessed was his own, neither was there any among them that lacked;
but they had all things in common.
The possessors of houses and lands sold them, and laid the price of them down at the apostles' feet;
and distri­ bution was made unto every man according as he had need.
The primitive church at Jerusalem shone thus brightly, all its aspirations being fervently directed heaven-ward.
The blessing of God sanctified this happy society, whence originated the excellent institutions which have come down to us.
Joseph [Joses], who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, that is to say, the son of consolation, a Levite, of the country of Cyprus, ever ready in good works, having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
Ananias also sold a field, but kept back part of the price, his wife Sapphira being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
When this fraud was revealed to Peter by the Holy Ghost, the apostle rebuked the man who endeavoured to deceive him by a lie.
Ananias had scarcely heard the apostle's repri­ mand, when he fell down and gave up the ghost.
And about the space of three hours after, his wife, not knowing what was done, came in, and, when Peter questioned her as to the price of the land, she also told a lie, and being rebuked by the apostle, fell down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost.
And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
2
By the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.
However, of the rest durst no man join himself to them, but the people magnified them.
The number of men and women who believed in the Lord increased more and more.
In the streets the sick were laid on couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them, and free them from their infirmities.
Great numbers of the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns hastened together to Jerusalem, bring­ ing to the apostles the sick and those who were possessed with the devil, and they all recovered the health they desired.
1The high priest and all they that were with him were filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
But the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night, and bringing them forth, said, “ Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple all the words of this life."
They accordingly entered into the temple early in the morning, and there preached the word of God with boldness.
But the high priest and they that were with him called the council together, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
The officers truly found the prison shut with all safety, but no man within.
At length, they beard that the men of whom they were in search were teaching in the temple.
Then the captain and the officers brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
When they had set them before the council, the high priest accused them of having filled Jerusalem with a doctrine which was contrary to their tenets, and opposed to the universal decisions of the elders.
The apostles therefore answered, "We ought to obey God rather than man.
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, and to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
We are witnesses of those things, and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."
When they heard'that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.
1
Then there stood up one of the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, who was held in repu­ tation among all the people, who, causing the apostles to be removed from the assembly, as he wished to be of service to them, then plainly recounted how, only a few days before, Theudas with four hundred followers was brought to nought, and how Judas the Galilean, who drew away much people after him, perished in the days of the taxing, with all his faction.
After having adduced examples of this kind, he con­ tinued :
"
And now I say unto you, refrain from these men, and let them alone;
for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought;
but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God."
Having heard this, they concurred in Gamaliel's opinion, and having recalled the apostles and beaten them, commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.
And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
In those days, as the number of the disciples was continually on the increase, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said:
" It is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
This advice was unanimously adopted, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, Philip and Prochorus, Nicanor and Timotheus, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch;
and set them before the apostles, who, when they had prayed, laid their hands on them.
The number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
1Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
The Jews, therefore, moved with envy, rose up against him, and disputed with him, but were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.
Then they suborned false witnesses, who asserted that they had heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and arresting him, brought him before the council, and began to accuse him.
And all that sat in the council saw his face, as it had been the face of an angel.
Being examined by the high priest, Stephen made an eloquent reply, and boldly unfolded the history of the fathers with great wisdom, expatiating fitly on the merits of Abraham, Moses, and the other patriarchs, and concluding with an account of many great events in a few words.
He then rebuked the unbelievers, and those who despised the law, calling them plainly stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, who always resisted the Holy Ghost, and persecuted the prophets.
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and gnashed on him with their teeth.
But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God, and said:
" Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him:
and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul.
And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying:
" Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice:
" Lord, lay not this sin to their charge."
And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord.
2
This happened in the second year of our Lord's ascension, on the seventh of the calends of January [December 26].
Devout men then carried the corpse of the first martyr to Gamaliel's country house, which is called Caphargamala, where they buried him with respect, and made great lamentation over him.
Nico­ demus, Gamaliel, and Abibas, were afterwards interred in the same spot.
This great treasure remained concealed there for three centuries, until the priest Lucian discovered it by a revelation from God;
and John, bishop of Jerusalem, ordered it to be carried to that city, in the seventh year of the reign of the emperor Honorius [A.D. 415].
1
After Stephen was stoned, a great persecution arose against the church at Jerusalem, and they were all scat­ tered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
But during this dispersion, the dis­ ciples, strengthened by the Holy Ghost, passed into several countries, and there preached the word of God.
Then Philip preached Christ in Samaria, and wrought before his hearers many wonderful works in the name of Christ, healing the paralytic, the lame, and those possessed with a devil.
The Samaritans gave heed with one accord unto the things which Philip spake, and received the true faith with great alacrity.
Then Simon Magus (who had long bewitched the people of Samaria, and blinded them with his sorceries to such a degree that these deluded men looked upon him as some great one, and called him the great power of God) believed also when he heard Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Being baptized in com­ pany with other men and women in the name of Jesus Christ, Simon continued with Philip, and beholding the signs and great miracles which were wrought, marvelled much at things so extraordinary.
2Now when the apostles, which were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John, who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost..
Then laid they their hands on those who were baptized, and they received the Holy Ghost.
3
Hence proceeds the institution of the church, that, after the catechumens have received the sacrament of baptism from the priest, the bishop shall lay hands on them, offering up prayers in their behalf, and anointing them with the chrism;
and thus the confirmation of those who are baptized is completed by the gift of the sevenfold graces of the Holy Spirit.
When Simon saw that, through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, say­ ing, " Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."
But Peter said unto him :
"
Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of ini­ quity."
But Simon, making light of the apostle's words, left him, and became an apostate, and for a long time pro­ voked the anger of God by his innumerable crimes.
The apostles, when they had spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many parts of Samaria.
1
At the command of an angel of the Lord, Philip went to meet Candace, the eunuch who had the charge of all the treasure of the queen of the Ethiopians, as he was returning from Jerusalem;
and having mounted the chariot, sat by him, and expounded to him the book of the prophet Isaiah which he was reading;
and commencing with the prediction of the slaughter of the unresisting Lamb, preached unto him Jesus.
The eunuch, listening to him with pleasure, readily comprehended and believed him, and, as soon as they found water, was baptized;
and then returned to his own country, rejoicing in his renewal by holy regeneration.
But the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, who preached the gospel in all the cities from Azotus to Cæsarea.
2Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, desired of the high priest letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that he might be able to make havoc of the church of God, and bring the men and women of the sect of the Nazarenes bound to Jerusalem.
As he came near Damascus, a light from heaven shone about him.
Falling to the ground, he heard the Lord rebuke him ;
he forthwith repented, and his con­ version was profitable both to himself and many others.
Being led into Damascus by his companions, who heard indeed the voice of the Lord talking with Saul, but saw no one, he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
Ananias, whom the Lord sent to him, put his hands upon him, comforted him, restored his sight, and baptized him.
Thus Saul, who before had ravened as a wolf, and was a cruel persecutor of the church, became not only a lamb, but fearless as a ram, a chosen vessel, and the teacher of the Gentiles.
He immediately entered the synagogues, and preached Jesus, that he is the Son of God, to the great amazement of all present, who remembered the bigotry with which in times past he had zealously followed the traditions of the fathers.
1Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus.
But his faithful testi­ mony roused their implacable hatred against him;
so much so, that a short time after they narrowly searched for him, intending to kill him, and placed sentries day and night at the gates of the city, to prevent his escape.
But the disciples, discovering the schemes of his enemies, defeated their projects by letting him down by the wall, in a basket, during the night.
When Saul was come to Jerusalem, lie endeavoured to join himself to the disciples;
but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
But Barnabas took him, brought him to the disciples, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and told them all the other things that bad happened, and Saul faithfully attached himself to the disci­ ples.
He, therefore, returned thanks to God, and continued with them coming in and going out, doing every thing boldly.
in the name of the Lord Jesus.
He disputed against the Grecians, confounded the Jews, and by God's help refuted them all.
The leaders among them, thus baffled in argu­ ment, were so enraged at Saul, that they tried to kill him.
Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Cesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified;
and walking in the fear of the Lord, were filled with the comfort of the Holy Ghost;
and the multi­ tude of believers increased.
1
The apostle Peter healed at Lydda a man sick of the palsy, named Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years.
And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sal'on, when they wit­ nessed this miracle, turned to the Lord.
At Joppa, Tabitha, full of good works and alms-deeds, died, and was laid by the brethren in an upper chamber.
The disci­ ples, hearing that Peter was at Joppa, which was not far from Lydda, sent unto him two men, desiring him to come to them.
As soon as he received the message of the breth­ ren, he humbly obeyed the summons.
When Peter was come, all the widows stood round him weeping, and showing .
the coats and garments which Dorcas made for them.
But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
and turning to the body said, " Tabitha, arise."
And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up, and be, giving her his hand, lifted her up, and presented her alive to the saints and widows.
This miracle was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord !2Cornelius, a centurion of the cohort, called the Italian band, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, was constantly employed in acts of charity and prayers for his eternal welfare.
This man saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God, and as he regarded him with deep awe, heard him say, " Cor­ nelius, thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memo­ rial before God."
The angel then commanded him to send for Simon Peter, who would give him saving advice.
He therefore immediately obeyed the order, and sent three men to Peter.
On the morrow, as they drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour.
While he was fasting, and his thoughts were dwelling on heavenly things, he saw in a trance heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, knit at the four corners, and let down from heaven to the earth, wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air.
And there came a voice to him, saying, " Rise, Peter, kill and eat."
But Peter said, " Not so, Lord;
for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."
And the voice spake unto him again the second time, “What the Lord bath cleansed, that call not thou common.
”This was done thrice, and the vessel was immediately received up again into heaven.
By this revelation the conversion of the Gentiles through the four climates of the world, in every language and nation, was divinely intimated to Peter;
and he was plainly taught by God himself not to reject any one who wished to be converted.
Re-assured and joyful, he hospitably received in the house of Simon the tanner the messengers of Cornelius, and on the following day accom­ panied them to Cæsarea of Palestine.
On his arrival there, , he found Cornelius, with his kinsmen and intimate friends expecting him, and as they were ready to hear him preach and obey his words, he kindly complied with their wishes.
1Peter, therefore, opening his mouth, said:
“Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons ;
but in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
He sent his word unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all."
When Peter had proclaimed these and many other things, respecting the advent of our Saviour and eternal life, and had supplied the thirsty souls with copious draughts of the water of life from the fountain of heavenly doctrine, the Holy Ghost fell on all who heard the word, and suddenly conferred upon them the gift of languages.
Then Peter, to the great surprise of those of the circumcison who had accompanied him, baptized Cornelius and all those who believed with him.
2In compliance with the invitation of his distinguished converts, Peter remained some days at Cæsarea, and having confirmed them in the faith, went up to Jerusalem, where he related to his fellow apostles the conversion of the Gentiles.
Then certain men that were of the circumcision, contended with him, saying, " Why wentest thou in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them ?"
But Peter began to explain to them, in regular order, how, while fasting and praying in the city of Joppa, he had seen a vision in a trance, wherein God showed him the calling and conversion of the Gentiles, and promised his aid;
giving them, further, a simple account of all that had happened.
When they heard these things, they held their peace;
and being full of brotherly love, praised and glorified God, who saves even Gentiles through repentance.
The faithful of Cyprus and Cyrene, and others, who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but Jews.
But when they were come to Antioch, they made known the Lord Jesus to the Greeks, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
The church which was in Jerusalem hearing this, rejoiced in the Lord, and sent forth Barnabas, a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith, who, when he came to Antioch, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and having comforted the disciples, departed to Tarsus, to seek Saul.
From thence they both went together to Antioch, where they frequented the church a whole year, and taught much people.
And the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
Then one of the prophets who came from Jerusalem, of the name of Agabus, predicted by inspiration that there would be a great dearth, upon which Saul and Barnabas, having received from their brethren the contributions intended for the relief of the saints, were despatched to Jerusalem.
2Tiberius Cæsar reigned about twenty-two years.
In the eighteenth year of his reign, as history correctly states, our Lord Jesus Christ suffered on the cross, rose again from the dead, performed, in an ineffable manner, many miracles, which becoming known far and wide throughout the world, were the subject of a report from Pilate to Tiberius;
adding, that on account of the innumerable wonders effected in his name, Christ was already looked upon as a God.
Tiberius informed the senate of all that had come to his knowledge.
But this body, we are told, as Tertullian writes in his Apology, showed nothing but contempt for Christ, because the judgment of this affair had not been referred at first to it, but the decision of the mob had anticipated its authority.
For, according to an ancient law, no one could be considered a god amongst the Romans, if the title was not confirmed by a decree of the senate.
Moreover, as Eusebius of Cæsarea assures us, in the second book of his "Ecclesiastical History,”what had taken place was neces­ sary to prevent our thinking that the divine power has any need of the support of human laws.
As we have just stated, the senate refusing to acknowledge Christ, Tiberius maintained his own opinion, and forbade any one from offering molestation to the Christians.
1 Divine Providence, no doubt, inspired the emperor with this determination, in order that, at first, the preaching of the gospel might be universally extended without opposition.
The consequence was that suddenly, like light flashing from heaven, or the rays of the rising sun, the word of God illuminated the whole world with the brightness of its divine light, that the pro­ phecy might be accomplished, which said, " Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends o. the world.”
2 From that time, in every town, and village, an immense number of people congregated in the churches, as the sheaves in harvest-time are crowded into the barns.
All those who were held by the bonds of a deadly supersti­ tion, handed down to them by their fathers, now freed from their tyrannical masters by receiving the knowledge of the word of God, through the teaching of Christ, and by wit- nessing the miracles performed in his name, turned to the one true God and Lord, their Creator, repenting of their old errors which they faithfully confessed.
On the death of Tiberius, Caius Caligula ascended the throne, but did not fill it quite four years.
He gave the government of Judea to Herod Agrippa, son of Aristobulus, . and, at the same time, conferred upon him the tetrarchatcs of Philip and Lysanias, to which he also shortly afterwards added that of Herod.
This same Herod was the author of the death of John the Baptist, and had treated the Lord with derision a short time before his passion.
The emperor, after having tormented him in many ways, banished him for life to Spain, as Josephus, the famous historian of the Hebrews, relates in his writings.
1
At this time Philo the Jew, a most celebrated writer, who stands in the first ranks among those who have studied the philosophy of the Greeks, bequeathed to posterity glorious monuments of his learning.
Among other things, he de­ scribes the cruelty and folly of Caligula, who carried his pride to such a pitch that he aspired to be worshipped as a god, and profaned the sanctuary at Jerusalem by setting up idols in the temples.
In addition to this, the Jews, in punishment for their daring and heinous cruelties to Christ, suffered fearful massacres and tribulations, as the learned men above named, Philo and Josephus, relate in their works.
Indeed, from the time they committed the impious crime, they were constantly exposed to the fury of seditions, and continually the victims of war and murder, until at last their ruin was complete at the siege of Jerusalem by Ves­ pasian.
Pilate, who, in the twelfth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, had been named procurator of Judea, and had pronounced sentence of death on Christ, suffered such persecution by the orders of Caius, that be killed himself with his own hand.
During this reign, Matthew, who preached in Judea, wrote his gospel in the Hebrew tongue.
2Cams Cæsar having been put to death, Claudius reigned thirteen years and eight months.
During his reign a fright­ ful famine desolated the whole world, as Luke tells us the prophet Agabus predicted.
About that time, during the famine which happened under Claudius, Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
Then James, the son of Zebedee, an apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ, visited all Judea and Samaria, and performed many miracles by the power of Christ.
He disputed in the synagogues with the unbelievers, and expounded the Holy Scriptures, proving that every thing which had been pre­ dicted by the prophets, was fulfilled in our Lord Jesus Christ.
Hermogenes, the magician, when he heard how highly James was spoken of on account of his virtues, was filled with envy, and sent his disciple Philetus to watch the motions of the apostle.
Attended by a few pharisees, Philetus tried to oppose James, and to shake the truth of his preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But the apostle persisted with confidence in the Holy Spirit, and proving the falsehood of his adversary's assertions shewed from the sacred scriptures that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Son of God.
Returning to Hermogenes, Philetus bestowed the highest praises on James, honestly admitted the truth of his statement respecting the true faith, extolled him as invincible in argument, and published abroad the numerous miracles he had seen or heard of.
He ended his narrative by advising his master to go with him immediately to the apostle to entreat his favour and number themselves among his disciples.
But Hermogenes was so much incensed, that he put Philetus in bonds, and he was unable to move.
As soon as the apostle was apprized by the son of Philetus of this treatment, he sent his handkerchief to him, and com­ manded him to touch it in the name of the Lord.
This done, Philetus was delivered from the bonds of the magician, and hastening to James in great joy, laughed at these dia- bolical sorceries.
However, the magician, seriously grieved, called up the demons by his nefarious art, and commanded them to bring to him James and Philetus in chains.
But the devils, as soon as they made their appearance in the air, began to howl, complaining, with horrible groans, that the angel of God had bound them with chains of fire which caused them excruciating pain.
At last, being set free by order of the apostle, they went back to Hermogenes, and, in turn binding his hands behind with cords, led him thus bound before James.
The blessed apostle rebuked the magician, telling him that the society of demons was a detestable thing, and ruinous to man:
he then ordered Philetus to untie the cords with which the magician, who stood before him humi­ liated and confounded, was bound.
Thus liberated, he seized the apostle's staff to defend himself against the fury of the demons, and ordered his disciples to bring from his house, on their shoulders, several coffers full of books.
He then began to throw the books into the fire, but in compliance with the commands of the apostle, he filled the coffers with stones and lead, and cast them into the sea, lest the smell arising from the combustion of polluted things should do injury to those who were unaware of their witchcraft.
Hermogenes, thus delivered from the burthen of magic, returned to the apostle, and humbly embracing his feet, manifested sincere repentance to God;
and, attaching him­ self to the blessed James, obeyed him in all things.
He thus began to attain such a state of perfection in the fear of God, that the Lord through him wrought several mira­ cles, by witnessing which many persons turned to the Lord, renouncing their errors and forsaking their evil deeds.
The Jews, persevering in their malice, when they saw that the magician, whom they considered invincible, and his friends, had become believers in Christ, offered money to Lysias and Theocritus, the centurions of Jerusalem, who arrested James, and committed him to prison.
The apostle was brought with great tumult into the judgment-hall, where all admired his confidence in the Lord.
Being questioned by the Pharisees, he returned excellent answers, and commented on the holy scriptures with wisdom and eloquence.
He proved from them irrefragably Christ's birth from a pure virgin, his passion and resurrection, and all the rest as confessed by the Catholic church.
The apostle concluded his discourse with such power, that all who were present believed, confessed their sins, and became faithful adherents to the church of God.
A few days afterwards, Abiathar, the chief priest, per­ ceiving that so great a multitude believed in the Lord, was grieved to the heart, and by giving money to the people, stirred up a violent tumult;
the result of which was, that the scribe Josias put a cord round the neck of the apostle, and dragged him to the palace of king Herod, son of Aristobulus.
The king, wishing to please the Jews, ordered that he should be beheaded.
While James was on the way to the place of execution, he saw a man, afflicted with the palsy, lying on the ground, who begged him with faith to heal his infirmity ;
the apostle said to him, " In the name of my crucified Lord Jesus Christ, for whose sake I am led away to be beheaded, rise up sound in every limb, and bless your Saviour."
The palsied man immediately got up, and re­ joicing at being able to run, began to bless the Lord.
At this sight, Josias threw himself at the apostle's feet, and humbly implored his pardon.
James, perceiving that the heart of the scribe was visited by the grace of God, rejoiced, and Josias confessed the Lord Jesus Christ, the true SOIl of the living God.
Then Abia­ thar ordered him to be detained while the bystanders beat him in the face with their hands, and having sent to Herod a report of what had happened, requested permission to behead the new convert also.
When James had embraced the neophyte, he laid his hand on his head, and blessed him, making the sign of the cross upon his forehead.
Josias, thus perfected in the faith, was beheaded with the apostle, and the Almighty Emmanuel granted them both an eternal reward.
The martyrdom of the blessed apostle James, the brother of John the great Evangelist, having been consummated on the 8th of the calends of August [the 25th of July], the day on which the devotion of the church celebrates his festival, seven disciples who had been instructed in the true faith by him, and were present at his passion, by divine inspiration, placed his body on board an old ship, and com­ mitted themselves to the sea, without a pilot, without rigging, but full of confidence in God's providence.
They arrived in a miraculous manner on the coast of Spain, and being well received by the king of Gallicia, were the first to preach the faith and religion to the Spanish nation, and gave their master an honourable burial.
Many miracles were there effected through the merits of St. James the apostle, and the inhabitants of the whole province soon embraced the faith of Christ.
The canons of the cathedral church watch with veneration the precious body of the apostle;
and devout Christians, from every quarter of the globe, flock thither, where they meet to implore the mercy of God through the intercession of the apostle.
1King Herod, called Agrippa by Josephus, finding that the execution of James was acceptable to the Jews, put Peter also in prison, and delivered him to the custody of four quaternions of soldiers.
Peter, therefore, was kept in prison, as they intended after Easter to bring him forth to the people, to put him to death.
The prayers of the church ascended incessantly to the Divine Majesty, beseeching him that the young flock might not be deprived of the guardian­ ship of its pious shepherd.
The Lord, in his clemency, listened to the prayer of his spouse and loving handmaid on behalf of her protector.
Heavenly aid was not wanting to the church, and Herod's cruel designs were provided against and frustrated.
Peter was sleeping at night between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers before the door kept the prison;
when the angel of the Lord came upon him, surrounded with light, and smote him on the side, and raised him up, saying, " Rise up quickly."
Immediately the chains fell from off his hands, and, taking his girdle, binding on his sandals, and casting his garment about him, he followed the angel, passing through the guards, unto the iron gate which opened to them of its own accord.
At first he thought that all this had happened in a dream;
but when the angel had departed from him, Peter came to himself, and, perceiving the truth, returned thanks to his deliverer for his escaped
He then went to the brethren who were assembled in the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, and as he knocked at the door, a damsel, named Rhoda, went to see who was there.
When she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
At length, having obtained admission, be cheered the drooping spirits of the astonished disciples, and declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, and, immediately departing, retired to another place.
His escape caused great commotion among the soldiers, and, as they could not discover where he was, King Herod was greatly incensed with the guards.
However, his cruel treat­ ment of the apostle was not suffered to remain long un­ punished ;
but the avenging hand of God was quickly upon him, as Luke tells us in the " Acts of the Apostles," and Josephus in the nineteenth book of his "Antiquities."
For on his going to Cæsarea, anciently called the Tower of Strabo, on a set day, he entertained the citizens with public shows, in honour of the emperor.
Splendidly arrayed in apparel admirably embroidered with gold and silver, he proceeded to the theatre, and sitting upon his throne, made an oration to the people, who shouted that it was not the voice of a man but of a god.
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because, he gave not God the glory ;
and five days afterwards he expired, eaten of worms.
2Agrippa, the son of Herod, reigned twenty-six years,3 that is to say, until the extermination of the Jews.
He lived in peace with the Romans and Christians, and the word of God grew and multiplied.
There were in the church at Antioch, certain prophets and teachers, viz.
Barnabas, and Simeon Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said:
" Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
At Salamine they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and travelled over the island as far as Paphos.
1
There the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, called for Barnabas and Saul, and having thankfully heard the word of God, believed.
The apostle then struck Ely­ mas the sorcerer blind for a season, because he withstood the doctrine of the faith.
Saul now justly gained the name of Paul, from the first among the gentiles whom he brought into subjection to the faith, as Scipio was surnamed Africanus after he conquered Africa.
They then repaired to Perga in Pamphilia, and afterwards to Antioch in Pisidia, where they went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sat down.
After reading the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue having granted permission, Paul stood up, and, beckoning with his hand for silence, admirably reviewed the history of the patriarchs, and proved clearly that the pro­ mises of God, made long before by the prophets, were now fulfilled in Christ.
2
The next sabbath-day almost the whole city came to bear the word of God, but the most bigoted of the Jews used their earnest endeavours to oppose the preaching of the apostles by their blasphemous outcries.
Then Paul and Barnabas boldly exclaimed :
"
It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you;
but seeing that ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the gentiles.
For so bath the Lord commanded us, saying:
̓̒ I have set thee to be a light of the gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.’ "
When the gentiles heard this, they were glad, and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
But the Jews raised persecution against Paul and Barna­ bas, and expelled them out of their coast.
Then, filled with joy, they came to Iconium, and preached in the synagogue both to the Jews and Greeks.
Remaining in that city for some time, they laboured boldly for the glory of God, who worked signs and wonders by their hands.
But the unbe­ lievers, both gentiles and Jews, insulted them in their rage, and attempted to stone them.
But they fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the whole region that lieth round about, and there they preached the gospel;
and their doctrine caused a great commotion among the whole population.
1At Lystra, a lame man, who had never been able to walk, having heard Paul speak, called upon the name of the Lord Jesus, was immediately healed, and, leaping up full of faith, glorified the Lord.
When the people saw what Paul had done, they were struck with wonder, and exclaimed, in the speech of Lycaonia:
" The gods are come down to us, in the likeness of men.”
And they called Barnabas, Jupiter;
and Paul, Mercurius.
Then the priest of Jupiter and the people would have offered sacrifice to them, but the apostles immediately ran in among the people, rending their clothes, and humbly gave the glory of the miracle to the Lord.
But although they thus humbled themselves, they could scarcely restrain the people from doing sacrifice unto them.
And there came suddenly thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people to stone Paul;
so that they drew him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
But while the disciples stood round him, he rose up and came into the city, and the next day he departed to Derbe.
Some time after, the two apostles returned again to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, and passed through Pisidia, preaching every where the word of life, and strengthening the souls of the disciples by their exhortations;
and when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord.
From Pamphilia they went down into Attalia, and thence sailed to Antioch.
1There they abode a long time with the disciples.
Then certain men, which came down from Judea, persuaded the believing gentiles to be circumcised and observe the law of Moses.
Paid and Barnabas opposed this teaching, and were sent, by unanimous consent, to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, to have the question determined.
Passing through Phenice and Samaria, they published the conversion of the gentiles, and caused great joy unto all the brethren.
At Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and de­ clared all things that God had done with them.
However, as certain of the sect of the Pharisees, which believed, were strongly inclined to Judaize, Simon Peter, James, and the other elders handled with great zeal the question proposed to them, and at last decided, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that chosen and experienced brethren should be sent to the gentiles, entrusted with a letter requiring them to cast off all other burdens, except abstaining from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.
2Paul, therefore, and Barnabas, with Judas, surnamed Bar­ sabas, and Silas, were sent to Antioch, and delivered the epistle of the apostles and elders to the multitude of believers among the gentiles, who, when they had read it, rejoiced for the consolation.
Judas and Silas, being also prophets, comforted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them, and after a while returned in peace to Jerusalem.
Notwithstanding, Paul and Barnabas preached the word of the Lord for some time at Antioch.
On their departure from thence, they separated;
Barnabas, with Mark and John, embarked for Cyprus, while Paul, having chosen Silas for his companion, went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, and commanding them to observe the commands which the apostles and elders had given.
He then came to Derbe and Lystra, and there, to obviate the subtle scruples of the Jews, circumcised Timothy, who was the son of a gentile.
Passing through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia, he came down to Troas, and, warned by a vision in the night, crossed over into Macedonia.
He preached at Philippic which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, where Lydia, a seller of purple, who worshipped God, listened to the things which were spoken of Paul, and believing, and being baptized with her household, she con­ strained the apostles, by her repeated entreaties, to lodge with her.
1As Paul, with his companions, was going forth to prayer, be was met by a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination, who brought her masters much gain by sooth­ saying.
This girl followed them exclaiming, " These men are tho servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation."
Having done this for many days, Paul being grieved, said to the spirit:
" I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her."
And he came out the same hour.
But when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they were in a great rage, and caught Paul, and Silas, and drew them into the market- place unto the rulers, and accused them of causing dis­ turbances in the city by introducing customs foreign to the manners of the Romans.
The excited populace also joining in the attack upon these innocent men, they were scourged, and, by order of the magistrates, thrust into the inner prison, with their feet made fast in the stocks.
At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God;
and soon received his special assistance.
For suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken;
and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bonds were loosed.
At this sight, the gaoler was terrified beyond measure, and having heard from the lips of Paul the grounds of his faith, believed and was baptized with all his household.
The magistrates of the city feared, when they beard that the apostles were Romans, and, releasing them from prison, desired them to depart out of the city.
Being set free, they went to the house of Lydia, and then departed for Thessalonica by way of Amphipolis and Apollonia.
At Thessalonica, on three sab­ bath-days, Paul entered the Jews' synagogue, and publicly reasoned with them out of the scriptures, alleging that "
Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead;
and this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
Many, both Jews and gentiles, believed and joined the com­ pany of Paul and Silas.
But the bigoted Jews, moved with envy, stirred up the multitude against them, and accused Jason and the other brethren, whom they drew before the rulers of the city.
But the rulers, when they had taken, security of Jason, and of the other, let them go.
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea;
and thence, as the Jews had raised tumults there also, the brethren conducted Paul to Athens.
Here he waited for Silas and Timothy, whom he had left at Berea.
Meanwhile, he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and preached in the market-place every day to those who came to hear him.
Then certain philoso­ phers of the Epicureans and Stoics disputed with him.
For the Athenians, and strangers which were there, spent, their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
Then Paul, standing in the middle of the Areopagus, rebuked the Athenians for their idolatry and superstition, and began to speak of the altar on which he had found an inscription:
" To the unknown God."
These.
words he took for the text of his expected discourse, and announced to them the true God, who, in former times, was unknown to the world;
then, saying much in a few words, he preached earnestly the faith, and the hope of the resurrection.
1
Then Dionysius the Areopagite, with his wife Damaris, and a few others, clave unto the apostle and believed his words.
Paul afterwards departed from Athens and came to Corinth, where he testified to the Jews and the Greeks that Jesus was the Christ, and earnestly devoted himself to the ministry of preaching;
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath.
Meanwhile Silas and Timotheus arrived from Macedonia.
Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, convinced by the arguments of Paul, believed and was bap­ tized, with all his house, and many of the Corinthians.
And Paul entered into a certain man's house named Titus the Just, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
Obedient to the commands of God made known to him by a vision in the night, Paul continued there a year and six months, teaching constantly the word of God.
There lived at Athens a Jew, of the name of Aquila, born in Pontus, and his wife Priscilla;
Paul, being a tent-maker as well as Aquila, assisted them in their labours, and thus gained a living by the work of his own hands.
Paul then took leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and came to Ephesus.
He then went to Cesarea, and thence came to Antioch ;
and after he had spent some time there, he de­ parted, and went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening the disciples.
1THUS far I have made brief extracts from the history of the primitive church as related by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, as far as the account of Paul's baptizing at Ephesus, in the name of the Lord Jesus, those disciples who had before received the baptism of John.
He after­ wards remained there for three months with those who, filled with the Holy Ghost, spake with tongues and prophesied;
he himself continually setting forth the kingdom of God, to the profit of many:
and then departing thence, for the next two years he preached the gospel boldly in every part of Asia, and performed in the name of Jesus Christ a number of miracles on the sick and demoniacs.
2
I must now have recourse to other works, and collect some short notices of the apostles generally, from authorities which are considered authentic, and are used by the church.
The Creator of all things only knows the degrees of rank and the respective merits of the apostles;
and He, who searches the secrets of the human heart, has apportioned to each the rewards of his labour.
The word apostle signifies sent;
for Christ sent them to preach the gospel throughout the world, in order that, as fishermen's nets haul shoals of fishes from the depths of the sea, the apostle's preaching might draw from the pit of perdition to the light of life, those who were lost in the depths of sin.
Their names are these:
Simon Peter, and Andrew his brother;
James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
James, the son of Alpheus, and Philip;
Thomas and Bartholomew;
Levi, Matthew, and Simon the Canaanite;
Judas Thaddeus and Matthias.
1Peter, called the first, the greatest in dignity, the key­ bearer, he who zealously obeyed Christ, and followed him with his whole heart-he it was who filled the highest seat in the company of the apostles.
He was the son of Jonas or John, and born at Bethsaida, a village near the lake of Gennesaret, in the province of Galilee.
To announce his future dignity and illustrious power, he received three names.
The significations of the three words indicated the many virtues vouchsafed to him by Heaven;
for Simon means obedient, Peter acknowledging, and Cephas a head?
Thus Simon, by the obedience with which, as soon as he heard the Lord's commandment, he attached himself to him, leaving all things, and ready to follow him to death, rose to the knowledge of the ineffable divinity.
Inspired by Heaven, he ardently desired to be acquainted with divine things, above the powers of human intellect, and in the sincerity of his faith loudly proclaimed a glorious confession, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
He therefore, was honoured above measure by Christ himself, made the head and foundation of the church.
The generous Benefactor, who had inspired him divinely with the know­ ledge of himself, rewarded with the highest rank and authority the faith of a pure heart to which his mouth had given utterance by that confession. "
Blessed art thon,” said he, " Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood bath not re­ vealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.”
3Truly blessed, indeed, is Simon, that is to say, the obe­ dient, who is also called Barjona, that is to say, the son of a dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. " An obedient man," saith Solomon, " boasts his victories.
"He who unremittingly observes the divine commandments is attacked by divers temptations in his daily conflicts with Satan, whom he overcomes by perseverance in the law of God.
What, indeed, does the divine law command or teach, but that every man must engage in spiritual warfare, combat the old serpent, who is always lying in ambush for us, and labour diligently to obtain the reward of his heavenly call­ ing ?
Thus, the brave soldier of the Lord doubtless speaks of his victories, when be returns thanks to God his pro­ tector, after triumphing over the enemy, saying with the prophet :
-"
Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;
thou shalt throw down my enemies under me and others in the same strain.
No one can please God the Father by his holy works, if he have not obtained the virtue of obedience through the grace of the Holy Spirit.
Then the Saviour, nobly consummating the reward of Simon's pious confession, said to him:
—“ Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
Petrus, in Latin, Cephas, in Syriac, are names derived in both languages from the word petra, a stone, that is, from Christ, who is the chief corner-stone upon which the church is founded.
Thus Simon, by his obedience, was prepared to acknowledge the Son of God, a knowledge which not flesh and blood, but the heavenly Father, revealed to him;
and therefore Peter was considered, by our Saviour himself, to be worthy of the sur­ name of acknowledging.
Having afterwards given to him the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the King of Sabaoth appointed him to be Cephas, that is to say, head of the church, the prince and sovereign pontiff of the apostles, gifted with the power of binding and loosing, pre-eminent in doctrine and sanctity, exalted by signs and miracles, the first pastor of the flock of Christ in his church, and his special vicar.
Peter preached the word to those of the circumcision for the space of seven years, and performed, during that time, the wonderful works which Luke records in the Acts of the Apostles, as I have mentioned above.
He healed, at the Beautiful gate of the Temple, the lame man, aged forty years, and baptized the five thousand Jews who were con- verted;
he punished, with his censorial power, Ananias and his wife Sapphira, who were guilty of deceit and falsehood, and thus gave a terrible warning, to the men of that day and to posterity, of the chastisement to be given for their souls' health.
As he passed along the streets, his shadow alone, falling upon the multitude of sick people as they lay in their beds, was sufficient to heal them, so great were the merits and power which Heaven bestowed upon him.
At Lydda he restored to health, in the name of the Lord, the paralytic Eneas, who had kept his bed eight years;
and brought to the faith those who saw and wondered at so unheard-of a miracle.
At Joppa he raised to life the vener­ able widow Tabitha, and presented her alive to the saints and widows.
The rest of his acts, from Judea to An­ tioch, and how he repeatedly overcame Simon Magus in his frequent disputes with him, Clemens Romanus, the son of Faustinian, has related in his book of the Recognitions, a work which he has also entitled the Itinerary of Peter.
This author, having abandoned all he possessed at Rome, embarked for Palestine, and met the apostle Peter at Cæsarea Stratonis, his residence being pointed out to him by Barnabas, whom he bad hospitably entertained at Rome, and who treated him as a friend and guest worthy of the greatest respect.
Clemens was kindly received by Peter, as a son by his father, on account of his regard for both him and Barnabas, and being fully instructed in the faith of the true Prophet, and renewed at the sacred font, he inseparably attached himself to Peter.
1
Peter disputed with Simon Magus at Cæsarea, and after Simon had retired in the evening with a thousand of his followers, he strengthened in the faith those who remained, and, invoking the name of God, healed the demoniacs and the sick.
The next day, the discussion was renewed, and with God's help, Simon was put to silence on many points.
At last, as night was approaching, Simon, confounded, left the place with a few adherents, and the people rejoicing, threw themselves at Peter's feet.
The demoniacs and the sick were cured by his prayers, and having heard the doctrine and experienced the mercy of the true God, they retired full of joy.
On the third day, Peter established the immortality of the soul, by the truth of his arguments, against Simon, who denied it, and laid bare his wicked principles, by giving proofs of them.
The people, indignant, drove the blas­ phemer from the hall, and even thrust him out of the door of the house;
and of the numbers who had been his follow­ ers for a long time, scarcely one now ventured to keep com­ pany with him.
However, Simon loaded the shoulders of his companion with the polluted and execrable instruments of his art, and fearing that, if he were taken, he should come within the grasp of justice, he threw them at night into the sea, and ran away, his attendant refusing to accompany him, because he had by this time found him to be a detestable impostor..
Peter dwelt three months at Cæsarea, ordaining Zaccheus bishop of that city ;
and baptized on a day of festival an immense number of believers, amounting to ten thousand.
From thence he sent twelve brethren after Simon, to follow his track.
Sophonias and Joseph, Micheas and Eleazar, Phineas and Lazarus, Elisæus and Benjamin, son of Saba;
Ananias, son of Saphra;
Rubelus, the brother of Zacchæus;
Nicodemus and Zacharias the architect, were selected by the apostle, that he might be assisted in the worship of God by twelve faithful brethren, though relying principally on divine grace, and that by their aid he might follow up Simon Magus and the other enemies of righteousness.
Having completed the three months he spent at Cæsarea, Peter went, by way of Dora, to Ptolemais, and there remained ten days teaching the people the law of God.
After this he was also employed in sowing the seed of the divine word at Tyre, Sydon, and Berytus;
and then entered Tripoli with a considerable number of the elect, who followed him from each of these cities.
At Tripoli he was entertained in the house of Maro with every token of regard from the citizens, who also granted to all the companions of Peter a gratui­ tous hospitality, marked with the greatest kindness.
The following morning an immense multitude crowded into Maro's garden to hear the apostle, who, in the first place, put to flight the foul spirits which cried out from the bodies they possessed, and after his sermon healed the sick in that place.
There, for the space of three months, he sowed abundantly the words of salvation, and baptized Clemens, and several others, at fountains which were in the neigh­ bourhood of the sea;
appointing Maro, his host, who was already perfectly prepared in all things, bishop.
Thence he repaired to Antarados, and divided the multi­ tude of believers who followed him into two bodies, ordering Nicetas and Aquilas to conduct them, and go before him, to Laodicea, from fear that such a concourse of persons accompanying him might excite the jealousy of the enemies to the faith.
During the journey, Clemens informed Peter, in a familiar conversation, whence he came, described his family, and related the history of his parents.
The next day, he visited a neighbouring island, in order to see some pillars of glass1 of an immense size;
and here, thanks to Peter, he recognized his mother Matidia, after a separation of twenty years.
Peter healed by his prayers a paralytic woman, who was the hostess of Matidia, and Clemens gave her a thousand drachms as a remuneration for her services.
After this, Peter went to Balancas, and then to Palthos and Gabala, and thus reached Laodicea, where he stayed ten days ;
during which time the recognition of the mother and her three sons, Clemens, Faustinus, and Faustus, took place.
Two of the brothers, who were twins, related, that after being shipwrecked, as they were tossed to and fro by the waves, holding on to a piece of plank, some pirates found them, and taking them on board their boat, sailed with them to Cæsarea, and there sold them under feigned names to a certain woman, who had acted most justly towards them, having educated them as her own children, instructed them in liberal and Greek literature, and, when they had arrived at the proper age, put them to the study of philosophy.
While Peter remained at Laodicea, incessantly occupied as was his custom, in pious works, an old man, named Faustinian, who appeared to be in a state of poverty, went to turn, and began to deny the existence of God, of a pro­ vidence in this world, and the necessity of divine worship;
asserting that every thing was done by mere chance and by generation.
1
His three sons, whom he had not yet recog­ nized, opposed him in the hearing of all the people for three days, and, by their answers, instructed their hearers in many abstruse doctrines.
The first day, Nicetas ably argued that there exists a God who is master of all things, who made the world, and governs it by his providence, a just God, who will reward every man according to his works.
On the second day, Aquilas discoursed with eloquence on the just disposal of all things by a God of justice.
On the third day, Clemens disputed on the origin of things, inquiring whether all depended upon generation, or whether there was aught in us effected not by the hazard of birth, but by the will of God.
It was then that, by a divine motion, without which nothing happens, the obstinate old man and his wife recog­ nized their children, although twenty years bad elapsed.
The chief magistrate of the town used his utmost en­ deavours to detain at his house Peter and the brethren who were with him;
and his daughter, who for twenty years had been the prey of a cruel demon, was set free and healed.
At this time, as Faustinian, while on a visit to his friends, Anubis and Appio, who lodged at the house of Simon, was taking his supper with them, his face was transformed by magic art into that of Simon:
a circumstance which caused the greatest fear to all his friends, as they dreaded that, by an order of the emperor, he would be taken for the magician, and punished in his room.
After this Peter went to Antioch, where he was received with great demonstrations of joy by the inhabitants:
he there preached the word of God, restored to health the sick who were brought to him, and healed the people afflicted with the palsy, possessed with a devil, as well as all those who suffered from any kind of accident.
The number of the sick was immense.
Peter was offering up a prayer to the Lord for them all, in the presence of the people, when suddenly, by the grace of God, an extraordinary light ap­ peared in the midst of the audience, and all who were afflicted in any way immediately recovered their health.
In consequence, all the inhabitants of Antioch, with one voice, confessed the Lord, and within seven days more than ten thousand souls believing in God were baptized.
Theophilus, who held the highest rank among the great men of the city, was inflamed with so ardent a love for God, that he freely offered the great hall of his own house to be converted into a spacious church.
1
It was consecrated under the name of a church, and an episcopal throne was erected in it for the apostle Peter by the entire population.
Mean­ while Faustinian, laying open his mind to the heavenly mysteries, at the sight of so many miracles threw himself publicly at the feet of the apostle, and, abjuring his ancient errors, requested to be baptized.
Peter enjoined him a preparatory fast, baptized him on the following Sunday, and, standing in the midst of the people, made the con­ version of Faustinian the subject of a discourse, in which he recounted the events of the convert's life.
This account was generally pleasing and useful, and gained for the old man and his family the favour and esteem of the inhabitants of Antioch.
The entire city made a happy progress in divine things, and the number of the faithful increasing daily, holy mother church rejoiced in Christ Jesus.

The blessed apostle Peter filled the see of Antioch for the first seven years, and preached the word in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
Afterwards, Simon Magus having gone to Rome, Peter set in order the church of Antioch, and consecrated Evodius bishop in his place.
He then proceeded to Rome,1 attended by several chosen disciples, and, entering the city in the time of the emperor Claudius, found the juggler, so often mentioned, deceiving the people with a variety of phantoms raised by virtue of the diabolical power called a familiar spirit.
This impostor was so puffed up with pride, that he set himself up for a god, and even obtained from the Roman citizens the honour of having a statue erected to him, as a god, on the banks of the Tiber, between the two bridges.
In fact, Satan had taken entire possession of this insane contriver of all wicked­ ness, who was the first he armed with the weapons of impious heresy to war against the true faith of the church.
The Almighty Emmanuel prepared the illustrious leader of his army to contend with him in close combat;
I mean Simon Peter, to whom Christ entrusted the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and appointed him to be the prince of the apostles and the firm ruler of his church.
He, there­ fore, on his arrival in Rome, dispelled the darkness of falsehood by the brilliant light of truth and justice;
and there, as a worthy censor, judging with equity, he filled the see twenty-five years, two months, and three days.
1
When the bright light of the word of God had shone forth in the Roman capital, and the word of truth, which Peter preached, had enlightened the minds of all his hearers, and had caused them so much satisfaction that hearing only did not satisfy those who daily attended, Mark, a disciple of the apostle, was induced by repeated solicitations to compose his gospel, that what the one taught by word of mouth might be committed to writing by the other, and thus transmitted to posterity for the perpetual instruction of the readers.
Peter was delighted to find that through the influence of the Holy Spirit, his teaching was ap­ propriated by a kind of pious fraud ;
2 and perceiving in this their faith and piety, he confirmed himself the work of the evangelist, and delivered this Scripture3 to the churches to be read for ever;
besides which, he composed two epistles which are called canonical.
1
Peter worked manfully in Christ's vineyard, during the reigns of Tiberius Cæsar, Caius Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, nurturing many excellent disciples, and, when they were well imbued with virtue and learning, sending them into different countries.
He placed his disciple Mark, whom he loved as a son, first at Aquileia, and then at Alexandria;
Martial at Limoges;
Apollinaris at Ravenna;
Valerius at Treves;
and many more in different places, where, in Christ's name, they brought vast crowds of the Gentiles to the light of faith, and having regenerated them placed them in the bosom of our holy mother the church, by the water of holy baptism.
One day when Peter was at Rome, while several of the brethren were at table, Titus said to the apostle, “ As thou hast cured all the sick, why dost thou let Petronilla lie suffering from palsy?"
The apostle answered, "It is ex­ pedient for her that it should be so;
but in order that no one may think that I wish, by words, to cloak my inability to heal her, I say to this woman, 'Rise up, Petro­ nilla, and come and serve us.’”
She rose up able to minister to them;
but, as soon as her attendance was no longer required, he ordered her to return to her pallet.
However, when she began to be proficient in the fear of God, not only was she perfectly healed of her own infirmity, but her prayers were the means of restoring health to others.
2PAUL, the illustrious champion of the Almighty, a chosen vessel, the teacher of the Gentiles, and preacher of the. truth, who was worthy to fill the twelfth throne among the apostles,1 and was caught up into heaven to hear the mys­ teries which man must not repeat,-ought to be worthily extolled and continually honoured by the sons of the church as their learned schoolmaster.
He was first called Saul, which means in Hebrew temptation;
because he began his career by tempting the holy mother church.
Having after­ wards changed his name, instead of Saul he was called Paul, that is to say, wonderful, having been converted in a marvellous manner, from a ravenous wolf into a mild lamb.
In Latin Paul may be taken for little ;
wherefore he said publicly, when speaking of himself, " I am the least of the apostles.
"Paul was of the tribe of Benjamin, a pharisee of the phari­ sees, born at Tarsus, a city -of Cilicia, but brought up at Jerusalem from his childhood, and instructed in the law of God by Gamaliel.
In the second year after our Lord's ascension, while he displayed excessive zeal for the tradi­ tions of the elders, and became, therefore, a violent persecutor of the Christians, he went to Damascus, bear­ ing letters from the high priest, commissioning him to persecute even to death all the worshippers of Christ who dwelt there.
When, however, he came nigh the city, he was suddenly surrounded by an extraordinary light, and, hearing with amazement the heavenly voice of the Lord Jesus, he fell to the ground;
but his salvation was secured, for he arose divested of his former ferocity, and was led by his companions of the journey into Damascus, where, for three days, he was unable to move.
At the end of that time, by God's command, he was visited by Ananias, and embraced the faith which he had combated, and, having been baptized, boldly preached it to Jews and Gentiles.
Beginning at Jerusalem, he proceeded as far as Illyria, Italy, and Spain;
1 and made known the name of Christ to the inhabitants of many countries who had not yet heard it.
Luke, the evangelist, Paul's companion and fellow la­ bourer, speaks of him to the end of his work with exactness and dignity, pursuing the thread of his history to the omis­ sion of others.
Arator, also, a sub-deacon of the holy Roman church, has written a second book on this subject, in which he piously made a metrical version of the Acts of the Apostles, in which he related the labours of Paul, his patience in adversity, and the shipwreck be suffered.
I have already collected from these works some brief notices respecting him in the preceding pages, but it is by no means an irksome task to recapitulate them to the glory of God.
Saul, who is likewise called Paul, having parted from his companions, in obedience to.
an admonition of the Holy Ghost, preached at Paphos, where he struck blind Elymas the sorcerer, who resisted the words of the faith, and con­ verted to Christianity the proconsul Paulus.
Having entered the synagogue at Antioch, he commanded silence by waving his hand, and related how the people of Israel went out of Egypt by passing through the sea, and spoke of the different miracles which were wrought in the desert.
On another sabbath day he rehearsed Christ's passion and resurrection, which he illustrated by passages from the prophets, and increased the flock of the church by a great number of believers.
At Lystra, Paul healed a man impotent in his feet from his mother's womb, who listened with attention to the word of God;
but when he saw the ancient superstition of the Lycao- nians, who wished to offer sacrifice to him, he rent his clothes, and used eloquence and reason to restrain their zeal.
After much opposition to his preaching, he handled the question raised by the baptized Jews, whether believing Gentiles ought to be baptized before they were circumcised.
Paul, therefore, went to Jerusalem with others chosen from among the faithful, and consulted Peter and James, and the other elders, and transmitted an epistle containing their decision that Christians need only abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.
At Philippi he cast an unclean spirit out of a young woman who was a Pythoness, and who gave responses to those who consulted her;
the demon being expelled, her covetous masters were deprived of the gains obtained by her divination.
They therefore accused Paul before the magistrates, by whose orders he was imprisoned.
In the night, the apostle prayed to the Lord of light, and the merciful guardian of his faithful people quickly heard him.
For there was a sudden earthquake, and the chains of the prisoners fell from them;
and the keeper of the prison having been baptized, with his whole family, Paul and Silas, the servants of the God of Sabaoth, were allowed to go free.
Paul, preaching at Athens, was surnamed by the people there, the sower of the word,1 and thus received a suitable name from the unbelievers ;
for his words were a fountain of eternal life to thirsty souls, and be scattered freely the seed of salvation for all who desired to gather it.
He disputed with the philosophers, both Epicurean and Stoic, and eloquently proclaimed the true God who was called by the Athenians " The Unknown God."
Dionysius the Are­ opagite, and his wife Damaris,2 believed and were baptized;
and Paul admitted him among his most intimate friends, on account of his wisdom and love of righteousness.
Soon afterwards, as Aristides the Athenian tells us, Dionysius was ordained bishop of Athens by the apostle, and after an illustrious life received the glorious crown of martyrdom.
Paul went from thence to Corinth, where he found Aquila preaching, with his wife Priscilla;
he went to reside at their house, and there practised the art of tent-making, in which they were expert.
There also, being admonished by Christ not to cease from preaching, he faithfully obeyed, and many were converted.
At Ephesus, twelve men lately baptized by Paul in the name of the Lord, were filled with the Holy Ghost, and had the gift of divers kinds of tongues.
Also, while Paul was healing, in the name of the Lord Jesus, those who were afflicted with various sorts of diseases, seven Jews, the sons of one Sceva, chief of the priests, took upon them to lay their hands on a man who had an evil spirit, calling over him the name of the Lord Jesus, whom Paul preached.
But the demon, acting through the man who was possessed, made a public acknowledgment of Jesus and his disciple Paul.
He also suddenly rushed upon the unbelieving exor­ cists, whom he wounded and put to flight.
A great number of the Ephesians, having heard the truth preached to them, believed and were baptized.
Some of those who used curious arts, burnt their books of magic, the value of which they estimated at fifty thousand pence.
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed;
and his grace thus strength­ ening the faithful, the party of the ungodly dwindled and was confounded.
But Paul sent Timotheus and Erastus into Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
1Demetrius, a silversmith, perceiving that the teaching of Paul induced the inhabitants of Ephesus to forsake the temple of Diana, and grieved that the profits of his trade were reduced to almost nothing, by the idols being con­ demned to destruction, called together his fellow workmen, and, setting forth their common grievances, stirred up a clamorous tumult of the people.
The riotous mob rushed furiously into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aris­ tarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions;
but their uproar, while they quarrelled among each other, was to no purposedPaul, having called the disciples to him, bid them fare­ well, after exhorting them to persevere in their new career ;
and then departed to go into Macedonia.
He remained three months in Greece.
His companions were Sosipater, son of Birrus of Berea;
and of the Thessalonians, Aris­ tarchus and Secundns ;
Gains of Derbe, and Timotheus;
and of Asia, Titicus and Trophimus.
After the days of unleavened bread, Paul and Luke sailed from Philippic and came to Troas in five days;
where they abode seven days.
And upon the first day of the week, when several of the disciples came together to break bread, as they were listen­ ing to a long discourse which Paul, who was ready to depart on the morrow, continued until midnight, a young man, named Eutychus, who sat in a window, fell down from the third loft, overcome by sleep, but was restored to life by the prayers of Paul, to the joy of all beholders.
1
From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, and calling the elders of the church, addressed them at length on matters pertaining to the salvation of souls.
And when he had finished his discourse he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
And they all wept sore, and when they had embraced each other, the brethren accompanied Paul unto the ship.
Then embarking, he came with a straight course unto Coos, and to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara, and, passing through Syria, arrived at Tyre, where he stayed seven days with his faithful friends in Christ.
From Ptole­ mais he went to Cæsarea, and entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who had four daughters, virgins, which did propbesy.
2
Then came down from Judea a prophet, named Agabus, who bound his own hands and feet with Paul's girdle, and by the grace of the Holy Ghost clearly predicted that the- Jews at Jerusalem would bind Paul in the same manner, and would deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
All who heard him began to weep, but Paul said to those who besought him not to go up to Jerusalem, " I am ready, not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
1Thus supported by the firmness of his faith, Paul went up to Jerusalem, and related to James and the other elders what things God had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry;
and when they heard of the conversion of the gentiles, they magnified God the Creator of all things.
The next day Paul entered into the temple to purify himself, and began to perform the ceremonies of the Mosaic law, in order to remove every occasion of scandal to those who were zealous for the laws of their fathers;
that thus making himself a Jew among the Jews, he might gain all men.
But the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up the people by their malevolent clamours, and laid hands on him.
And all the city was moved, and the people ran together;
and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple, and forthwith the doors were shut.
They then began to beat him, and sought to kill him.
Claudius Lysias, the tribune of a cohort, when he heard that all Jerusalem was suddenly in an uproar, imme­ diately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them, and, to prevent the populace from taking the apostle's life, he forcibly rescued him out of their hands, and having bound him with two chains, drew him out of the crowd, and com­ manded him to be carried into the castle, that he might inquire of him who he was, and what he had done.
With the tribune's consent, Paul ascended the stairs, and, speaking to the people in the Hebrew tongue, gave a full account of his conversion, and of his former conversation as a Jew, and offered afterwards the best arguments for his change to the faith of Christ.
While he was thus judiciously speak­ ing, the Jews, impatient at the force of his words, began to raise violent clamours, and furiously exclaimed:
" Away with such a fellow from the earth:
for it is not fit that he should live."
The chief captain, therefore, commanded him to be brought into the castle, and scourged and tortured.
Then Paul said unto the centurion that stood by:
" Is it lawful to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned ?”
The chief captain, after he knew that he was a Roman citizen, was afraid because he had bound him.
1
On the morrow Paul was brought before the council, and standing in the midst defended himself with great ability.
But the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by to smite him on the mouth.
Then said Paul unto him:
" God shall smite thee, thou whited wall;
for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?”
And they that stood by said, “ Revilest thou God's high priest?"
Then said Paul:
“ I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest.
For it is written :
Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."3
But when Paul perceived that the one part were sadducees, and the other pharisees, he cried out in the council, " Men and brethren, I am a pharisee, the son of a pharisee;
of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
At these words, there arose a dissension between the two parties, and the multitude was divided.
For the sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit;
but the phari­ sees confess both.
Some of the pharisees took his part, saying, " We find no evil in this man;
but if a spirit or an angel bath spoken to hiln.”3 ...
And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune, fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castledAnd the night following, the Lord stood by him, and said:
" Be of good cheer ;
for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."
And when it was day, more than forty Jews came to the chief priests and elders, and bound themselves by an oath that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul when on his way to the council.
The tribune, hearing of this conspiracy from Paul's sisters son, dextrously defeated the plot of these wicked men.
For at the third hour of the night, he sent the apostle in chains to Cæsarea under an escort of two hundred soldiers, and threescore and ten horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, and remitted the case to the governor Felix in a letter which he wrote to him.
Thus conducted to Cæsarea, Paul was confined in the guard- house of Herod's palace, and after five days was called before the assembly.
Ananias, the high priest, was present with the elders of the Jews, and the orator Tertullus framed an insidious accusation against Paul.
The accused, with the governor's permission, briefly replied, and by his prudent answer completely refuted all that was laid to his charge.
Felix the governor then adjourned the assembly until the arrival of the tribune, and ordered the centu­ rion to treat Paul kindly.
And after certain days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla who was a Jewess, and sending for Paul, heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled;
but he often sent for him, hoping to obtain money from him.
At the end of two years, Portius Festus succeeded Felix, who, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul boundNot long afterwards Festus went down to Cæsarea, and there commanded the Jews to bring forward their accusation against Paul.
In consequence they laid many and grievous complaints against him.
which they could not prove, while Paul justified himself in these words :
"
Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Cæsar, have I offended anything at all."
At last, through the under-hand arts of the Jews, and the double dealing of the judge, whose policy it was to conciliate them, Paul found it necessary to appeal to Cæsar.
He was also brought before an assembly over which King Agrippa and the governor Festus presided, when, raising his hand, he gave an account of his calling and his faith in Christ, in a very eloquent speech.
When it was ended, all present admired his wisdom;
and the great men going aside, talked between themselves, saying:
"This man bath done nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
He might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Cæsar.”
He was, therefore, delivered to Julius, a centurion of the Augustan cohort, one Aristarchus, a Macedonian, and Luke, being his fellow tra­ vellers.
There were in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls;
the voyage, which violent tempests rendered very dangerous, lasted fourteen days, during which they saw neither sun nor stars;
and took no food as they despaired of being saved.
Paul had tried to persuade them to winter in Crete, but the earnest advice of the pilot and the master of the ship prevailed with the centurion and soldiers to prose­ cute the voyage.
Their heedless haste induced them to brave the storms of the winter season, and almost the whole of them would have been lost, but for the aid afforded them by the merits of Paul.
But they suffered much from terror and fatigue when they were wrecked on the quicksands ;
and all the tackle of the shipwas carried away, and theywere forced to throw overboard the wheat and all that burdened the vessel.
Meanwhile, the angel of God stood before Paul, and said to him, “ Fear not, Paul;
thou must be brought before Cæsar;
and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
1After the ship had gone to pieces, it was with the greatest difficulty that they reached the island of Mitylene.
3
And the barbarous people showed them great kindness, and kindled a fire for their comfort, because of the rain and cold.
And when Paul was heaping faggots on the fire, a viper came out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
The bar­ barians, seeing this, cried out that the man was a murderer, and would doubtless soon die.
But Paul shook the viper into the fire, and, to the surprise of all, felt no harm.
3Publius, the governor of the island, hospitably entertained the shipwrecked people three days.
While there, Paul went to see the father of Publius who lay sick of fever and dysen­ tery, and having prayed over him, laid his hands on him, and healed him.
Others also of the islanders who bad diseases came to him, and were healed.
They therefore treated the shipwrecked crew and passengers with great respect, on ac­ count of Paul's merits, and when they departed, supplied them with all that was necessary for their voyage.
At the end of three months, they embarked in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, and, by God's guidance, arrived not long afterwards at Rome;
when some of the brethren, hearing of Paul's arrival, went out to meet and congratulate him.
At Rome Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, in the custody of a soldier;
and after three days, he called the chief of the Jews together, and complained to them of his arrest and the ill-treatment he had suffered from their brethren at Jerusalem.
He then gave them a faithful account of the true faith which is in Jesus Christ.
He dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, preaching to all men the kingdom of God, and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
1I have hitherto followed the narrative of St. Luke the evangelist, in the Acts of the Apostles, who, omitting fur­ ther notice of the other apostles, relates that Paul went to Rome, where, for the space of two years, he' preached the word of God without hindrance.
He came to Rome in the second year of the reign of Nero, and defended himself before the emperor, who at the commencement of his reign was as yet disposed to be merciful.
By God's help, he was set at liberty at the command of Nero, whom, by a figure, he calls The Lion;
" and quitting Rome, he journeyed through the nations of the west, as far as Narbonué, a city of Gaul.
It is reported that he there built a church, which he dedicated in honour of the Maccabean martyrs, where is still seen the sign of the cross, marked in oil, which the apostle traced with his thumb on the wall;
he then ordained his disciple Paul bishop of that city, who there, after performing many good works, terminated his career by a happy end.
2
In the same manner, several others, who had been instructed in the doctrine of the Catholic faith by the holy doctor of the gentiles, shed a wonderful lustre on the church of God, being placed in the chair of authority to govern the people of God in various countries.
Luke in Bithynia, Titus in Crete, Carpus at Troas, Timothy and Archippus in Asia, Trophimus at Arles, Onesimus at Ephesus, Sos­ thenes at Corinth, Tychicus at Paphos, Dionysius the Areo­ pagite at Athens, Epaphras at Colosse, and Erastus at Philippi, spread the nets of faith, and drew the heathen nations from the darkness of ignorance to the light of truth, as fishes are caught from the depths of the sea.
Pointing out to others the path of righteousness, they retained them in it by their words and actions.
Their names are, therefore, written in the book of life, and all nations will proclaim their wisdom and celebrate their praised
It now becomes necessary for me to speak of the trium­ phant deaths of the saints, and I shall faithfully continue the thread of my narrative from the materials furnished by the writings of the fathers.
I shall have to tell how these glorious princes of the earth, nobly bearing the standard of the true Joshua, re-conquered the land of promise;
how they loved each other during their lives, and were not sepa­ rated in death ;
how, animated with the same spirit, they fought at Rome against the emperor Nero and Simon the magician;
and how, having vanquished the enemy, they received on the same day their heavenly crowns.
2
Marcellus, a Roman, son of the prefect Marcus, baptized by the apostle Peter, has described the frowardness of Simon Magus and the simplicity of Peter, in a letter addressed to the holy martyrs Nereus and Achilleus, while they were banished to the island of Palmaria for the faith of Christ, and daily combated the magicians Furius and Priscus, dis­ ciples of Simon Magus with irrefragable arguments for the truth.
Marcellus relates that on a certain day, while Simon was disputing with Peter, calling him a magician, and en­ deavouring to excite the hatred of the Roman people against him, a widow happened to pass with a great crowd, following to the grave her only son over whom she mourned with loud cries.
Then Peter said to the followers of Simon, " Ap­ proach the bier, and remove the corpse.
Whoever restores it to life may be well believed to possess the true faith."
When the people had done as he desired, Simon said:
"If I should bring him to life again, will you put Peter to death The multitude answered:
“We will burn him alive !
Then Simon having conjured up his demons, began with their aid to operate on the body, which made a slight motion, and the people, observing it, raised shouts in praise of Simon, and threatened Peter with death.
However Peter, having with some difficulty obtained silence, addressed the crowd in these words:
“ If this body lives, let it speak, walk, take food, and return home.
If not, be assured that you are deceived by Simon."
Then the people exclaimed with one voice:
" If Simon be not able to do this, he shall suffer the punishment which he destined for Peter."
Simon now, feigning to be angry, tried to run away;
but the crowd caught hold of him, and loaded him with reproaches.
Peter, then extending his hands towards heaven, said:
" Lord Jesus Christ, who saidst unto us thy dis­ ciples :
’
Go, in my name, cast out devils, heal the sick, raise the dead;
' restore now this child to life, that all the people here may acknowledge that thou art God, and that there is none other than thou, who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, through all ages, Amen."
The child im­ mediately arose, and worshipped Peter, saying:
" I saw the Lord Jesus Christ commanding his angels thus:
' At the request of Peter, my faithful friend, let that orphan, and only child, be restored to his widowed mother.'"
The people now began to exclaim unanimously:
" There is but one God, the one that Peter preaches."
Simon meanwhile trans­ formed himself into the shape of a dog, and tried to escape;
but the populace held him fast, and, as they strove to throw him into the fire, Peter rushed into the midst of the crowd and set him free.
“ Our Mastery he said, "taught us to render good for evil."
Simon, therefore, escaped, and went to see Marcellus, whom he had already seduced, and tied up at the entrance of the house an enormous dog, which could scarcely be held fast by the iron chain with which it was bound.
"
We shall now see," said he, "if Paul, who is accustomed to come to see you, will be able to enter."
An hour had scarcely elapsed when Paul appeared at the door, and, making the sign of the cross, unchained the dog, saying:
“ Go and say to Simon :
Cease from employing the services of demons to deceive the people for whom Christ shed his blood."
Marcellus, witnessing such wonders, ran to meet Peter, and throwing himself at his feet, received him into his house, from which he expelled Simon with utter con­ tempt.
The dog now became gentle towards every one except Simon, whom he continually worried;
but, one day, when he had got him under him, Peter ran up to him, exclaiming:
" I command thee, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to inflict a bite on any part of that man's body."
The animal from that moment could not touch one of Simon's limbs, but it so tore his clothes that no part of his body remained covered.
Then all the people, and especially the children, ran after him with the dog, and drove him beyond the walls of the town, howling as if they bad been in pursuit of a wolf.
Unable to bear the scandal of this ignominious treatment, Simon did not venture to make his appearance for a whole twelvemonth;
but after that, he made himself known to the emperor Nero, and the rogue thus attaching himself to one of the worst of men, became all the worse for the connexion.
As the end of the apostle's warfare drew nigh, the Lord appeared to his servant Peter in a vision, saying:
" Simon and Nero, fully possessed by demons, are plotting against thee.
Fear not, for I am with thee, and will grant thee the consolation of seeing Paul my apostle, who to-morrow will enter Rome.
In concert with him, thou shalt make war upon Simon for the space of seven months, and when thou bast conquered, driven away, and cast him into hell, ye shall both come to me crowned as victors.
All this took place.
Indeed Paul arrived the very next day.
Pope St. Linus has related when and how the apostles met, and how they had a conflict with Simon seven months afterwards;
with full particulars of their martyrdom in a work written in the Greek language for the use of the eastern churches.
1
From this narrative I propose to make some extracts in the way I have already done, and to compile, in as few words as I can, an abridged account of all the circumstances.
Having learnt that Paul was arrived at Rome, Peter was overjoyed, and immediately rose and went out to meet him.
When they saw each other, they wept with delight, remained for a long time locked in a close embrace, and bathed themselves mutually with tears.
These two great apostles beginning to preach the word of God, the greater part of the mixed population believed, nor could the in­ furiated assemblies of Jews or Gentiles make any open resistance to those whom the Holy Spirit had largely endowed with the fulness of all wisdom.
While an innumerable multitude of persons were con­ verted to the Lord by Peter's preaching, it happened that Livia, the consort of Nero, and Agrippina, the wife of the prefect Agrippa, also embraced Christianity;
and, in conse­ quence, they separated from their husbands, and vowed to lead a life of chastity for love of the eternal King.
Paul also displayed the lustre of manifold graces, and roused the wonder of the Roman world by signs and won­ ders, by his great learning, and admirable sanctity.
2
Having purchased a public garden outside the walls, there, assisted by Luke, Titus, and other faithful members of the church, he discoursed on the word of life.
Meanwhile he began to collect a very great multitude of hearers, and, by God's help, many souls were added to the faith through him ;
so that the fame of his preaching and holiness was noised through­ out the city, and his reputation spread over the whole neighbouring country.
Many officers of the emperor's household hastened to hear him preach, and became be­ lievers in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Some also of the guards of the imperial bed-chamber resorted to him, and, becoming Christians, left the service.
Inflamed with inward fervour, they attached themselves to Christ, and refused to return to their ranks in the palace, preferring the glory conferred by the true faith and its virtues, to the profession of arms, riches, and honours.
Thus every day the cause of Satan suf­ fered loss, while the triumphs of the faithful increased.
Even Seneca, the emperor's tutor, formed so close an intimacy with Paul, finding in him divine knowledge, that he could scarcely live for a moment without conversing with the apostle;
and when he was prevented from listening to his words, he sought by an interchange of letters to enjoy the charms of friendly communication, and to profit by his good advice.
It was thus that, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, his doctrine spread itself and made itself beloved;
so that he taught freely, and was listened to with enthusiasm by his numerous bearers.
He disputed with the pagan philosophers and confounded the Jews;
and almost all the world submitted to his teaching.
Even some of his writings were read to the emperor by his own tutor ;
a circumstance which made him generally esteemed:
the senate also were not indifferent to his merits.
But while these two illustrious apostles thus shed a divine lustre, not only amongst the Romans, but also amongst all who from different countries thronged to Rome, the capital of the world, the elders of the synagogues and some chief men of the gentiles, inflamed with bitter zeal, stirred up the hatred of the turbulent mob against the apostles by their impious accusations.
They, therefore, sent Simon Magus to Nero as he was leaving the palace, and commissioned him to prefer false charges against the blessed apostles.
Simon began to speak much evil of Peter, declar­ ing him to be a magician and a corrupter of the people.
The wicked believed this man, who deluded them with magical tricks, at which they gaped with ignorant wonder;
for at his command a brazen serpent moved, dogs cut in stone barked, bronze statues laughed and walked;
while he himself would run and suddenly rise into the air.
As a contrast to these impositions, Peter cured the sick with a word;
restored sight to the blind by his prayers;
drove away demons by a simple command.
Meanwhile he even raised the dead, and drew away all those he could from the pernicious company of the magician.
The result was that every religious man detested Simon, while all the wicked men, on the contrary, became his accomplices, and by false testimony accused Peter of crimes which he had not committed.
At last these accusations came to the ear of Nero, who ordered the magician to appear before him.
When conducted into the emperors presence, he began to deceive the spectators by illusive tricks, transforming him­ self into different shapes, so as at one time to appear a boy, the next moment an old Burn, and at another time a youth.
Thus, by the help of Satan, he played his antics in different forms;
a sight which so astonished the emperor, that he took him for the son of God.
Then the magician, with his accomplices, accused the apostles, and Nero gave orders that Peter and Paul should be brought in great haste before him.
As early as the day after, the apostles and the magician disputed before Cæsar;
and, as our faith­ ful narrative informs us, they performed many wonders.
For the disciples of the truth declared the truth, asserting that the magician was throughout a thief and a rogue;
and to prevent the weak-minded from listening to him, protested solemnly that he was an infamous apostate.
When Simon threatened to send his angels to punish Paul, the latter secretly requested Nero to order that a barley-loaf should be brought and given to him privately.
This having been done, Peter took the loaf, which he blessed, broke, and hid in his sleeve:
he then inquired of the magician, who boasted of being the son of God, what he had just done.
Provoked at not being able to discover the apostle's secret, Simon called loudly to several enormous dogs, and ordered them to come and devour Peter before the eyes of Cæsar.
Behold, suddenly there appeared dogs of a wonderful size, which leaped upon Peter.
The apostle, however, kneeling on the ground, extended his two hands, and exhibited the loaf he had blessed.
As soon as the dogs perceived it, they suddenly disappeared.
Thus the magician was publicly exposed, and became the laughing-stock of all the world, as he could only exhibit the ferocity of his dogs, instead of the power of the angels he had promised to send against the apostle ;
and in this manner showed that the angels who obeyed his orders came from the kennel, and not from heaven.
At last, Simon Magus having been frequently confounded by the power of the apostles' words, Nero commanded that a lofty wooden tower should be built in the Field of Mars.
The next day, the emperor, the senate, the Roman knights, and all the people assembled there to witness the show;
and, by the command of Nero, the apostles were also brought to the place.
Then Simon, having ascended to the top of the tower, before all the people, crowned with laurel, he extended his hands towards heaven, and began to take his flight in the air.
Meanwhile, Paul, on his knees in the presence of the whole crowd, was praying to the Lord ;
while Peter was attentively watching Simon's tricks, and waited patiently for the moment favourable for the infliction of divine vengeance.
At last he said to his faithful com­ panion, "Paul, raise your head a little, and look."
Paul lifted up his eyes, full of tears, and saw Simon already flying through the air ;
then he said:
" Peter, why do you delay ?
Finish what you have begun, for the Lord Jesus Christ already calls us to him."
Then Peter, looking towards Simon, exclaimed:
" Angels of Satan, who bear this impostor through the air to lead into error the hearts of the unbe­ lievers, I adjure you, by God, the Creator of all things, and by our Lord Jesus, his Son, who on the third day was raised from the dead, that from this moment you cease to carry him, and let him fall.
"
Immediately, obeying the voice of Peter, the demons al­ lowed their burden to drop from the clouds, and the magician fell on the spot which is called the Sacred Street [Via Sacra], where his body, broken into four quarters, spread over four stones, which bear testimony to the triumph of the apostles to the present day.
Hearing the crash, Paul raised his head, and returned thanks to God, the just judge.
Nero, inflamed with rage, ordered Peter and Paul to be thrown into prison;
while, by his orders, Simon's corpse was carefully guarded for three days and as many nights, because he was convinced that the magician would rise again on the third day.
Paul, on the contrary, asserted that he was damned to all eternity.
While the apostles were re­ joicing in the Holy Ghost, and openly confessed that the Lord Jesus was their master, Nero, transported with anger, said to his prefect Agrippa :
"
It is absolutely necessary that those impious men should perish by a condign punish­ ment ;
procure, therefore, some iron chains, and let them be burnt in the Naumachia."
Agrippa replied:
"It is not right that you should order them to be executed in that way, as Paul appears to be innocent of the murder of Simon;
it is, however but just that he should lose his head, on account of his impiety.
As for Peter, who com­ mitted the homicide, order him to be crucified.”
1
The emperor assenting, the teachers of eternal salvation were immediately removed from his presence and delivered over to Paulinus.
Paulinus, one of the most illustrious of the Roman magis­ tracy, received the charge of the apostles of Christ, and cola­ fined them in the Mamertine prison, where they were guarded by Processus, Martinian, and other soldiers.
They remained in this prison for nine months, and cured by their prayers many sick people and demoniacs who came to them.
More­ over, as their fellow prisoners cried without ceasing, and united in begging for water to quench the thirst that tor­ mented them, the blessed apostles prayed to God, and their prayer was quickly answered by him whom they trusted.
For the blessed apostle Peter, having made the sign of the cross on the Tarpeian rock, at the same moment a spring burst from the side of the hill.
Then Processus, Martinian, and all the prisoners, threw themselves at the feet of the apostle Peter, and forty-seven persons, believing in the Lord, were baptized.
The apostle offered up for them the eucha­ ristic sacrifice and made them partake of the holy com­ mUllIon.
At the sight of so many wonders, the officers,1 Processus and Martinian, said to the apostles:
“ Depart wherever you like, for Nero has forgotten you, and will not miss you."
Peter and Paul, being entreated by the brethren to leave the prison, quitted it at the end of nine months, and, passing along the Via Appia, arrived safe at the city gate.
Then Paul went to visit his acquaintance and friends in the city, and strengthened in the faith the Romans and the rest of the believers, who rejoiced greatly at his escape;
and, as his custom was, sowed the seed abundantly of the word of God, and, with his help, added for some days to the number of the faithful.
The blessed Peter, who had the flesh of his leg eaten into by the fetters (the bandage falling off by the side of the fence in the Via Nova), had almost reached the Appian Gate, when the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him.
As soon as Peter had perceived him, he worshipped him, saying:
" Lord whither goest thou?"
The Lord said to him:
" Follow me, Peter;
for I am going to Rome to be crucified a second time.”
The apostle, immediately following him, turned back towards Rome, and our Saviour then said to him:
" Fear not, for I am with you until I introduce you into my Father's house.”
2When Paul returned to the city in the morning, the officers arrested him, and dragged him before the emperor's tribunal.
Then Nero, remembering what had before occurred, gave orders that Peter should be nailed to a cross, and Paul be beheaded.
But when Peter was led to the foot of the cross, his thoughts wholly occupied with heavenly things.
he acutely felt that the Lord Jesus Christ, who descended from heaven upon the earth, had been raised upon a cross planted upright, and he entreated the executioners to reverse his, and crucify him with his head downwards.
This they did.
fixing his feet above and his hands underneath.
Then an innumerable multitude of people assembled so full of in­ dignation that they would have committed the emperor Nero himself to the flames.
But Peter forbade them, saying:
" Nay, nay, my children, put no obstacle in my way;
my feet already walk on the road to heaven.
Grieve not, but rather rejoice with me, for to-day I receive the fruit of my labours.
"Then after a long exhortation, in which he clearly explained the type of the cross of Christ, whose steps he followed, he prayed, and returned thanks to God, saying:
"I give thanks to thee, 0 good Shepherd, because the flock that thou hast entrusted to my care share with me this trial;
and I beseech thee, Lord, to let them partake with me of thy mercy in thy kingdom."
He added:
" Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, I commend to thee the sheep that thou didst coin­ mit to my care, that they may not perceive that they have lost me, having thee for their protector, by whose aid I have been able to govern this flock.”
With these words he yielded up his spirit.
Immediately, there appeared men, who had never been seen in that place, and whom no one had been able to see there, either before or afterwards, and they said that they were come from Jerusalem for Peter's sake.
These men, in concert with the illustrious Marcellus, secretly carried off the body of the apostle, and deposited it under a turpentine tree, near the Naumachia, in the place which is called the Vatican;
testifying that the friends of our Lord Jesus Christ were ordained to be the mighty patrons of the Romans.
1I shall now make some brief extracts from the history of the martyrdom of St. Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, showing how he fought a good fight, and finished his course, and obtained the reward of his heavenly calling, inserting the account in this place to the praise of the ineffable Saviour.
2After Paul had left the prison, as before related, he returned to the garden, where lie lodged before;
and there great numbers of his friends resorted to him with much joy.
At last one day, towards evening, as be was inculcating his saving doctrine, and teaching the crowds in an upper chamber, Patroclus, the em­ peror's cup-bearer, having been invited by some of his own intimate friends, withdrew from his master's presence, and repaired at nightfall to Paul that he might hear the lessons of everlasting life.
But on account of the crowd he could not get near the master, to hear con­ veniently the word of God which he fervently loved:
he therefore got up into a very high window, and there sat.
Now as Paul prolonged his discourse until a late hour, the young man became drowsy, and through the snares and malice of Satan, fell asleep, and falling from the window of the room, which was on a very high floor, expired.
The news of this accident was speedily carried to Nero as he was returning from the bath, and being extremely attached to the young man, he was much concerned, and appointed another to be cup-bearer in his place.
Meanwhile Paul, who still continued his instructions within, immediately knew, through the Holy Spirit, what bad hap­ pened, and informed those present of the accident, ordering them to bring forthwith the lifeless body to him.
As soon as the corpse was brought into the room, Paul addressed the people, and exhorted them to pray with a full faith to the Lord Jesus for the resurrection of the dead man.
All present fell on their knees to join in prayer, which being concluded, Paul said:
" Young Patroclus, rise up and relate what the Lord has done for you."
Whereupon Patroclus suddenly arose as if from sleep, and began to glorify Al­ mighty God.
Then Paul sent him away rejoicing with the other officers of Cæsar's household.
1While Nero was lamenting the death of Patroclus, and abandoning himself to extreme grief, he heard those about him say that Patroclus was alive and standing at the gate of the palace.
On hearing this, the emperor was seized with fear, and forbade him to enter the palace and appear in his presence.
At last, listening to the persuasions of his friends, he gave Patroclus permission to come in, and when he saw him safe and sound, and showing no signs of death, he was overwhelmed with amazement;
and having conversed with him for awhile, perceived that he was become a Chris­ tian ;
and, unable to restrain his rage, gave him a blow on the cheek, which caused Patroclus to rejoice the more in the Lord Jesus.
Then Barnabas and Justus, Paul, the soldier Arion of Cappadocia, and Festus the Galatian, all attendants and friends of Cæsar, said to their master:
" Why did you buffet this young man who is well taught, and gave true answers?
We also are soldiers of the invincible king, Jesus Christ our Lord."
When Cæsar heard them all, with one mind and one voice, call Jesus the invincible king, he ordered them to be thrown into prison, resolving to torture cruelly those he had fondly loved.
He also commanded a strict search to be made for all the setters forth of this great King, and published a cruel edict that as many as were discovered should be tortured and punished without trial.
In conse­ quence, a strict search was made for the faithful by the officers, and a great number of them were found and brought into the presence of Cæsar.
Amongst these, Paul, always in bonds for Christ's sake, was led before the emperor in chains.
All the other Chris­ tians looked upon him as their master, and justly honoured him whom the Lord had pronounced to be a chosen vessel, each of them preferring him to himself in all things.
Nero, therefore, without any witness could easily understand that Paul commanded the soldiers of the great King.
Having asked him why he had furtively intruded himself into the jurisdiction of the Roman state and enticed his soldiers to desert the imperial service, and enlist under the banner of his own King,1 Paul, full of the Holy Spirit, boldly pro- claimed before all present, the power of Almighty God, and invited them all to partake of the bounties of his hand which can dispense the richest gifts to every one according to his deserts.
He also admonished the emperor himself to pay dutiful allegiance to the supreme King.
Lastly, he asserted that his King would come to judge the quick and the dead, and destroy the world by fire.
At these words, Nero Cæsar was inflamed with anger, and commanded that all the sol­ diers of Christ should be burnt at the stake.
But Paul was treated as one guilty of high treason, and a decree of the Senate was passed, condemning him according to the Roman laws to lose his head.
Having been delivered to the prefects Longinus and Megistus, and the centurion Acestus, to be executed without the walls.
Paul preached to them by the way, without intermission, the word of salva­ tion.
The apparitors and officers also who were hastily despatched by Nero to seek for them, used their utmost .
endeavours to hunt out the Christians who concealed them­ selves, in order to put them to death.
In consequence, such immense numbers of the faithful were massacred, that the Ro­ man people, becoming exasperated, made a forcible entrance into the palace, with the intention of laying violent hands on Cæsar himself.
Then Nero, frightened at the clamours of the people, issued another edict commanding that the Chris­ tians should be allowed to live in peace.
This rendered it necessary that Paul should be brought before him a second time;
but as soon as Nero saw him, he vehemently ex­ claimed :
"
Take away the magician, take away the sorcerer;
cut off the impostor's head, and sweep from the face of the earth this perverter of the people's minds.”
But Paul firmly declared that after death he should live eternally, and be with his invincible King, and that, to prove the truth of his words, he would show himself visibly alive to the emperor himself after they had beheaded him.
Paul was now led rejoicing to the place of execution, unceasingly publishing the words of life to his executioners, and to all who accompanied him.
With the aid of the Holy Spirit, he showed the emptiness of idolatry, proved its nothingness, and admirably set before them the true faith and the know­ ledge of the true God;
concluding his discourse with a magnificent description of the damnation of the repro­ bate, and the glorious rewards of the righteous.
He did not speak in vain, for his divine teaching suddenly pro­ duced its fruits;
touching and inflaming the hearts of the crowds who listened to him, and converting the shouts of the new converts into wailings for their sins.
In the meantime, as these holy occupations caused some delay, while the dense crowd rent the air with their cries, Nero sent Parthenius and Phereta to see if his orders had been carried into effect, and hasten the apostle's execution, if he were still alive.
In these men also Paul endeavoured to plant the seeds of salvation, but, evil prevailing, and their hearts being hardened, his labour was in vain.
As he went towards his place of martyrdom, followed by innumerable multitudes, he met at the gate of the city of Rome, Plautilla, a noble matron, to whom he said:
" Adieu, Plautilla, daughter of eternal salvation."
He then requested her to give him the kerchief she wore on her head, to bind his eyes at the time of his suffering.
The lady, in tears, immediately presented him the kerchief, and commending herself to his prayers, retired a little out of the crowd, as the apostle had commanded her.
Paul, observing that she was subjected to insults by the pagans, who reproached her with believing in a magician and an impostor, spake words of comfort to her, ordered her to wait for his return in some unfrequented place, and told her that she would receive, by means of her kerchief, an unmistakeable token of his death.
He then in few words instructed Long-inns and those of his companions who believed, how and by whom they could be baptized after his death.
Arriving at the place of execution, he turned towards the east, lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed in Hebrew for a long time with the tears trick­ ling down his cheeks, and concluded with returning thanks to God.
After this, taking leave of the brethren, he blessed them, and having bound his eyes with Plautilla's hood, he knelt down on both knees, and stretched out his neck.
The executioner struck him with all his might, and cut off his head, which, after it was separated from the body, pronounced with a clear voice the name of Jesus Christ in Hebrew.
A stream of milk immediately gushed from the body upon the soldier's clothes, and blood flowed after­ wards.
The hood, which he had bound over his eyes, disappeared.
Such an intense light burst from heaven at the moment of his decollation, attended by delicious per­ fume, that the mortal eyes could not bear the brightness, and no human tongue could give a description of the fra­ grance.
All who witnessed these wonders were filled with admiration, and, for a long time, gave praises to the invin­ cible King of Sabaoth.
But Parthenius and Phereta returned to the city, and when they reached the gate, found there Plautilla giving glory to the Lord;
but they presently asked her in derision, why she did not cover her head with the hood she had given to Paul.
She, inspired with the ardour of faith, answered nobly :
" 0 vain and wretched men, who know not how to believe even the things that you see with your own eyes and touch with your own hands !
I have indeed the kerchief I gave, now gloriously tinged with that precious blood."
She then told them with tri­ umph that Paul had come from heaven, attended by an in­ numerable company of angels clothed in white, and restored her hood, thanking her for her kindness towards him, and adding the promise of an eternal reward.
Then Plautilla drew the hood1 from her bosom, and showed it to them dyed red with blood.
On seeing this the men were struck with terror, and quickened their pace to reach the palace, and inform Cæsar of what they had seen and heard.
Upon receiving the intelligence, the emperor was greatly aston­ ished, and, horribly alarmed, began to consult the philoso­ ophers, his own friends, and the officers of state as to the meaning of all that had been reported to him.
About the ninth hour, while they were all wondering at these events, and inquiring and conversing about them, Paul entered the palace although the doors were closed, and standing before the emperor, said to him :
“ 0 Cresar Nero, behold Paul, the soldier of the eternal and invincible King, stands before you !
You will now, perhaps, believe that I am not dead, but live by the power of my God.
As for you, wretched man, unutterable woes await you shortly, the bitterest punish­ ment and eternal death ;
because, among your other crimes, you have shed like water the blood of the faithful.”
Having said these words, he suddenly disappeared;
while Nero, on hearing them, was struck with unspeakable horror;
and having almost lost his senses, was at a loss how to act.
At last, by the advice of his friends, he ordered Patroclus and Barnabas to be set at liberty, with all those who bad been thrown into chains with them.
Longinus, also, and his companions came to Paul's sepulchre early in the morning, as he had appointed, and there saw two men praying, and Paul standing between them.
Terrified at this wonder­ ful sight, they dared not approach nearer;
but then Titus and Luke, awaking from the trance into which they had fallen in the fervour of their prayer, saw the prefects and the centurion, who had been the instruments of Faults death, hastening towards them, with natural alarm they im­ mediately took to flight.
But the officers, calling to them in gentle accents, they immediately stopped, and having heard their profession of faith, baptized them with religious joy.
At this time, the first thunder-cloud of a terrible perse­ cution burst over the Christians, who furnished admirable examples of resolution and constancy for those that fol­ lowed.
In Tuscany, Torpes, one of the great officers of Nero, was beheaded, after suffering various tortures ;
at Rome, Processus, Martinian, and forty-six of their com­ panions were baptized by the blessed apostle Peter.
Lon­ ginus and two others were converted by Paul, and received the washing of salvation at the hands of Titus and Luke.
All these, followed their spiritual teachers step by step, for their faith and martyrdom.
At Milan, Nazarius, Gervasius, Protasius, and Celsus, a boy, suffered for Christ.
1
Thus Nero added war against God to his innumerable crimes, and incurred the hatred of the army and Roman people, who decreed that he should be publicly scourged to death.
On hearing this sentence, he trembled with fear, and, struck with intolerable alarm, the wretched prince absconded, and was never seen again.
Some relate that, while wandering about after his flight, his limbs became stiff from hunger and cold, and he was devoured by wolves.
1Such are the notices respecting the two most eminent senators of the church, which I have collected faithfully, extracting from the accounts of their remarkable acts, contained in a great number of volumes, a short abridgment for the information of posterity.
Peter preached for seven years to the circumcision, and held the see of Antioch for another seven years.
He went to Rome in the time of Claudius Cæsar, to oppose Simon Magus, and there preached the gospel for twenty-five years, being the first bishop of Rome.
He was crucified in the thirty-sixth year after Christ's passion, on the third of the calends of July [June 29], and his body was interred by the Aurelian Way, near the palace of Nero on the Vatican.
2
On the same day, Paul, after nobly suffering innumerable pains and labours, was beheaded at the second milestone on the road to Ostia, in the gardens situated ad aquas Sal­ vias, [at the Salvian waters.3]
Both the apostles suffered at Rome during the reign of the emperor Nero, when Bassus and Tuscus were consuls;
the first is honoured with the devotion of all the inhabitants of that city near the Trium­ phal Way, the second enjoys similar honours on the road to Ostia.
5
Rome, the capital of the world, glories in having for her patrons such exalted saints, to whose temples the faithful resort from all parts of the globe, in order that, by assistance of these powerful advocates, they may be protected from all their adversaries and all hostile influences.
All who with becoming devotion implore their intercessions, quickly experience their aid, through the mercy of God, the supreme King, who, in the unity of Trinity, reigns through­ out all ages.
Amen.
ANDREW, the brother of Simon Peter, according to the Hebrew etymology, signifies handsome or responding;
but in Greek is derived ἀπὸ του̃ ἀνδὸς, that is, a viro, and means virile.
To this apostle Scythia and Achaia were allotted, for the field of his ministerial labours;
in which last, in the town of Patras, he died suspended on a cross, upon the second of the calends of December [November 30].
We possess a short but excellent work, containing particulars of many wonderful acts of St. Andrew.
Al­ though the name of the author is unknown to me, yet some account of these will, I think, be very acceptable to the reader.
I propose, therefore, to make brief extracts from the narrative, to the glory of the Almighty Messiah, and insert them in my own work.
When Matthew, apostle and evangelist, published the word of salvation to the Myrmidons, lie was seized by some cruel men who put out his eyes, and threw him into prison and chains.
Meanwhile, the apostle Andrew, by command of the angel of God, went down to the sea-shore;
and having found a ship, immediately embarked, and the winds being favourable, made a quick passage to the town where St. Matthew was confined in a loathsome prison.
Here, seeing his fellow apostle and the other prisoners, in great affliction, he wept bitterly;
but when they had prayed together, the whole place suddenly shook under them, and a light shone in the prison.
The eyes of the blessed evan­ gelist were also restored to him, and their fetters being unloosed, Matthew and the rest of the prisoners were set free, and quitted the dungeon.
While, however, Andrew was preaching the word of God to the inhabitants of the country, they seized him, tied his legs together, and dragged him through the street of the town, so that his hair was torn out by the roots, and blood flowed from his head.
At last, the prayers of the apostle being heard, great fear fell on the inhabitants of Myrmidonia,1 who presently set him at liberty.
Then prostrating themselves at his feet, they eagerly listened to his preaching, and, divinely influenced, believed in the Lord and were baptized.
After this, Andrew departed, and, returning to his own country, there touched the eyes of a blind man who immediately recovered his sight.
Demetrius, the governor of the city of Amasia, having heard of the miracles which Andrew performed in the name of Christ, came in tears to throw himself at the feet of the apostle, beseeching him to restore to life a young Egyptian who had died of fever.
The kind apostle consoled him in his affliction, repaired with him to the house of mourning, and after he had prayed, the child arose in perfect health.
All who saw this miracle rejoiced, believed, and were bap­ tized.
Sostratus, a Christian youth, having been tempted by his mother to commit incest, ran off to the apostle;
but the woman, full of spite, accused her son of the crime before the proconsul.
The young man remained silent through modesty, but St. Andrew defended him, and publicly rebuked the lewd woman for her iniquity.
The proconsul, in anger, ordered the young man to be tied up in the leathern sack used for parricides, and to be thrown into the river, and Andrew to be taken to prison.
But while he was praying, a violent earthquake, attended with frightful claps of thunder, threw the proconsul from his seat, and the rest all fell on the ground.
The mother of the lad was struck by lightning, and burnt to death.
Then the proconsul threw himself at the feet of the apostle, saying:
" Have compassion on us, thou servant of God, for we are perishing, and the earth will swallow us up."
By the prayers of Andrew, the earth­ quake ceased;
the air became serene, and, going round, he restored all those who were agitated with fear.
The pro­ consul received the word of God, and, believing in the Lord with his whole family, was baptized by the apostle.
Gratinus of Sinope,1 having an attack of fever, fell seriously ill, and at the same time his wife became swollen with the dropsy.
His son also, while washing in the women's bath, was grievously tormented by a demon, which deprived him of his reason.
At the request of the proconsul, Andrew ascended a chariot and came into the town, and as soon as he entered the house of Gratinus, drove out the demon, and cleansed and healed the young man.
He rebuked a man and his wife who were foul with adultery, and cured them, after having received a promise that they would amend their lives;
afterwards, when both were re­ covered, they received the faith of Jesus Christ, and were baptized with great joy, and their whole house.
At Nice, seven demons lurked among the tombs by the wayside, and stoned those who passed by at mid-day, having already killed a great number.
At last, hearing that the apostle was approaching the gates, the whole city was in a tumult of joy, and the inhabitants, going out to meet him with branches of palm-trees, exclaimed:
" Thou man of God, our salvation depends on you."
They then explained to him the state of affairs, and heard in return from the apostle's lips all the rules of faith and religion.
They were immediately filled with joy, believed in the Lord, and con­ fessed that Jesus Christ was the Son of God.
Andrew then returned thanks to God for their instant conversion;
and, commanding the demons to appear before the people in the shape of dogs, banished them to arid and barren wastes, where they could hurt no one.
Thus armed with the power of God.
he delivered the city of Nice, baptized the citizens who believed, and appointed Celestine,1 a good and wise man, to be their bishop.
At the gate of Nicomedia Andrew met a young man lying dead on a pallet, whose aged parents were following to the grave the corpse of their son, weeping bitterly.
Grieved at seeing their -tears, he inquired what was the cause of the youth's death.
But they were afraid and returned no answer;
their servants answered his question, saying:
“ While he was alone in his room, seven dogs suddenly appeared and leaping upon him, miserably tore him, so that he fell down dead."
Then Andrew knew that this was the work of the seven demons he had driven out of Nice, and sighing towards heaven he begged of God the life of the deceased.
Having concluded his prayer, he turned himself towards the bier, and said:
" In the name of Jesus Christ, rise up."
To the great astonishment of the people, the young man arose, and attached himself to him to whom he owed his restoration to life.
The apostle took the young convert with him as far as Macedonia, and instructed him in the words of salvation.
Having quitted the town, he went on board a ship, and entered the strait called Hellespont, intending to sail to Byzantium, when suddenly the sea became rough, and a violent gale sprung up which nearly sank the ship, so that the sailors expected to perish every moment.
At length the blessed Andrew prayed to the Lord, at whose command the wind was still and the sea tranquil, so that a favourable voyage soon brought them, delivered from their peril, to Byzantium.
As they approached the shores of Thrace, a great multitude of men appeared with drawn swords, and brandish­ ing lances in their hands, ready to fall upon those who came within their reach.
But the blessed Andrew made the sign of the cross towards them, and prayed to God for the preservation of his followers.
Then the angel of the Lord, passing through the band with great radiance, touched their swords and, falling on the ground, they allowed the man of God and those who accompanied him to go through unhurt.
The apostle Andrew arrived at Perinthus, a maritime city of Thrace, where he found a vessel which was to sail with all speed for Macedonia.
The angel of God commanding him to embark in it, when on board he preached the word of God, and the pilot and all the sailors believed in the Lord.
There was at Thessalonica a young nobleman extremely rich named Exous.
He went to the apostle without his family knowing it, and having heard him preach the word of God believed in the Lord, and, leaving his parents and property, attached himself to him.
His relations searching for him, found him at Philippi, and used their utmost endeavours to detach him from the apostle by employing presents and threats, but were not able to do so.
Andrew whom they treated with contempt, preached to them the word of salvation, and, having got together a numerous band, they threw fire upon the house, and being furnished with bundles of rushes and sedges and with torches, they began to succeed in their efforts to reduce it to ashes.
Then the young man, having called upon the name of Christ, poured upon the flames a bottle of water, and the divine power extinguished the fire in an instant, as if it had not been lighted.
Enraged at the failure of their attempts, they brought ladders to scale the walls, and put to the sword all who were in the house;
but they were struck blind by the power of God, so that they were unable to see how to ascend the ladders.
Then Lysimachus, one of the citizens, acknowledged the hand of God, and strongly rebuked his neighbours for their folly, saying:
" Why, 0 simple mortals, do you consume your strength in fruitless attempts ?
God himself fights for these men, and you do not perceive it!
Cease this folly, lest the anger of Heaven should destroy you."
At these words they were pricked to the heart, and while the darkness of night was thickening around them, they were illuminated by light from heaven.
Going up they found the apostle praying;
and, prostrating themselves on the floor, entreated his forgiveness, which they received.
He then kindly raised them up, and, being strengthened in the faith, they praised the Lord.
However the parents of the young man were not among the number of those who believed;
and cursing their child, they returned to their own country, where, at the end of fifty days, they both expired in the same hour.
Then the young man received his whole patrimony from his fellow-citizens, by whom he was much beloved, and attaching himself to the apostle, he distributed amongst the poor the revenue of his estates.
Some time after they both departed together for Tbessalonica, where the citizens thronged about them in the theatre with great rejoicings.
While Exous was preaching to them the word of God, the blessed Andrew, admiring his wisdom, listened in silence.
After this, at the request of the multitude, he ordered them to bring to him Adimathus, the sick son of Carpianus.
This young man, having received from his father an assurance that he would be healed, be­ lieved his words, and putting on his clothes, rose from the bed on which he had lain twenty-three years, and, run­ ning swiftly, so that he left his parents behind him, repaired to the theatre, fell down at the apostle's feet, and, to the amazement of the people, returned thanks for the recovery of his health.
A certain Thessalonian, having implored the apostle to heal his son who was possessed with a devil, Satan, the master of a thousand artifices,1 suffocated him in a secret chamber.
The father, having found his son dead, and being in great affliction at his bereavement, yet strong in faith, did not give up all hope, but had the corpse carried to the theatre by his friends, and told his case to the apostle.
The latter, turning to the people, ex­ claimed :
" 0 men of Thessalonica, what can it profit you to witness the performance of miracles, if you do not believe However, as they promised to believe if they saw the miracle, the apostle Andrew said to the dead man:
“ In the name of Jesus Christ, rise up, young man !
”And he immediately arose, and the people astonished, faithfully kept the promise they bad made to receive the faith.
Medias of Philippi, begged St. Andrew with tears, to have compassion upon his son, who was very ill;
and the bene­ volent apostle kindly listened to his request, and, taking him by the hand, went with him to Philippi.
As they were entering the gate of the city, an old roan came up to them, and implored his interference in favour of his sons, who were thrown into prison by Medias for some offence they had committed.
The apostle exhorting him to be merciful, Medias threw himself at his feet, and, in the hope of obtain­ ing the recovery of his son, pardoned not only the two sons of the old man, but also seven other prisoners for whom no one had said a word.
When they were set at liberty, the apostle healed Philomede, who had been twenty-two years infirm.
The people then calling upon the apostle to cure their sick also, Andrew, trusting in the Lord, said to the young man whom he had just healed:
" Visit all the sick at their own homes, and command them to rise up in the name of Jesus Christ, who has restored you to health."
He imme­ diately obeyed the apostle's word, and the people believed when they saw the miracles, and offered many presents to the man of God;
but as he preached the word of life to all without reward, he refused to accept of anything, but in­ vited all men to come and receive the faith.
He also healed gratuitously the daughter of Nicholas, who was in a languishing state;
although her father offered him a very valuable present, that is to say, a gilded chariot with four white mules, and the same number of horses.
The fame of the apostle's miracles on the sick spreading throughout Macedonia, Quirinus, the proconsul, was in­ censed against him, and he sent soldiers to Thessalonica to lay hands upon Andrew;
but when they saw the brightness of his countenance, they dared not touch him.
The people of the place who believed in God receiving information that a band of soldiers was coming there to do harm to the apostle, they became so exasperated that they were ready to fall on them with swords and staves;
and although the apostle forbade, they could scarcely refrain from murdering them.
Again the proconsul sent a band of soldiers, who, when they saw the apostle, became so agitated that they were not able to utter a single word.
The third time, the proconsul despatched a large body of troops, one of whom was possessed with a devil, and made use of the most violent language against the proconsul in his absence.
The demon afterwards came out of the soldier, who fell down on the ground and expired.
At last, the proconsul came himself transported with fury, but, although he stood near the apostle Andrew, was not able to see him until he heard him speak.
This wretched man, seeing the holy servant of God, loaded him with abuse and threats.
But the benign saint endeavoured to calm the fury of the judge with gentle words;
and, pouring forth prayers to the Lord, restored the dead soldier to life.
The proconsul, however, still per­ sisted in his insane fury, and the next morning ordered that wild beasts should be let into the arena, and the blessed apostle led to the spot, and thrown to the wild beasts.
The savage guards then dragged Andrew by the hair towards the arena, threw him in, and let loose upon him a ferocious and horrible boar.
The animal walked three times round the holy man of God, but did him no harm.
By order of the proconsul, another boar1 was brought by thirty soldiers, and driven into the place by two hunters;
but it would not touch Andrew, while it tore the huntsmen in pieces.
At last, giving a horrible grunt, it fell down and expired.
While the people, for this deliverance, were celebrating the praises of the Lord, an angel was seen to descend from heaven to comfort the holy man of God, who was still in the stadium.
At last the cruel proconsul, boiling with rage, commanded that a most ferocious leopard should be let loose;
but as soon as it was at liberty, disregarding the apostle, the animal ascended the steps to the proconsul's seat, and, leaping on his son, instantly strangled him.
Utter madness must have possessed the proconsul, for he was not at all grieved at what had happened, nor did he speak a word.
Then the blessed man comforted the people with the love of God, and, to strengthen their faith, promised to restore to life the proconsul's dead son.
Prostrating himself upon the ground, he prayed for a con­ siderable time, and then, taking the hand of the deceased in his own, raised him up in the name of the Lord.
The people witnessing this miracle magnified God, and would have killed the proconsul Quirinus, who in his unbelief had dared resist God's saint;
but the apostle would not permit them.
The proconsul retired to the pretorium in confusion.
Moved by the entreaties of a certain woman, the blessed Andrew followed her to a farm where there was a serpent fifty cubits long which devastated the whole country.
At the approach of the apostle, the serpent made a loud hissing, and, erecting its crest, glided towards the persons present to their great consternation.
Then the holy man of God said to it:
"Hide thy head, cruel monster!
thou hast raised it since the creation of the world for the destruction of the human race.
Submit thyself to the servants of God, and die."
The serpent immediately uttered a tremendous groan, and, coiling round the trunk of a large oak-tree that was near, vomited a stream of poison and blood, and expired.
The apostle afterwards went to the farm-house belonging to the woman, where he found her little child lying dead, having been struck by the serpent.
He then sent the parents to see that the reptile which had killed the .
infant was itself dead.
After they had left the place, the apostle said to the proconsul's wife:
" Go, and restore the child to life."
She, nothing doubting, approached the corpse, and said:
" In the name of my God, Jesus Christ, rise up whole;
" and the child instantly arose, to the great joy of all present, who returned thanks to God.
On the following night, the blessed Andrew saw Peter and John in a vision, when it was revealed to him that in a short time he would be hung on a cross, and thus be a partaker of the same suffering as the Lord Jesus at his crucifixion.
Whereupon he called together the brethren, and related the vision to them, explaining its meaning, and endeavour­ ing to console them in the affliction which the announcement of his sudden departure from this world had caused them.
During five days he instructed them in saving truths, and having, by devout prayers, commended the flock of his church to God, he departed for Thessalonica.
The proconsul, Lisbius, endeavouring to resist the designs of God, sent soldiers on several occasions to take Andrew, but his abominable attempts were foiled;
and, on the arrival of the apostle, Lisbius was cruelly scourged by two demons.
Upon this he sent for the man of God, and confessed his iniquity to him in the presence of all the people.
He then willingly heard the word of God from the apostle's lips, and being healed of his wounds, believed in God, in whose laws he thenceforth diligently walked.
Calista, the proconsul's wife was extremely jealous of Trophima, who formerly bad been his concubine, but who, being now united to another man, adhered to the apostolic doctrine.
She therefore, unknown to Lisbius, sent for her steward, and ordered him to condemn the woman as a prostitute, and to send her to the stews.
Trophima being therefore conducted there, and given up to the bawd, made incessant prayers to God.
When the lewd presented them­ selves, she held out the gospel which she carried in her bosom, and suddenly their libidinous desires were ex­ tinguished.
One day a gay young man of very licentious habits drew near her, and would have violated her, but she resisted him, and, during the struggle, the gospel fell to the ground.
Then Tropbima, in the extremity of her distress, lifted up her hands to heaven, and, bursting into tears, said:
" Do thou, Lord, save me from pollution, for whose name I am devoted to chastity."
The angel of the Lord immediately appeared to her, and the debauched youth fell down at her feet, and expired;
she, however, comforted by divine grace, blessed God, and raised the young man to life in the name of Christ, and the whole city ran to witness the spectacle.
Calista repaired to the bath with her steward, and while they were in the water together, a horrible demon appeared before them, and struck them both dead.
This sudden catastrophe was followed by great lamentations, and was announced to the apostle and the proconsul.
Calista's nurse, who, on account of her great age, was obliged to be carried, implored the apostle to restore her mistress to life.
Although the husband was justly irritated when he heard of the foul offence she bad committed, the gentle apostle ordered the corpse to be laid where it could be generally seen, and, approaching the body, and having prayed, touched the head of the woman, saying:
" Arise, in the name of Jesus Christ, my God."
The woman im­ mediately rose up, and begged to be reconciled to Trophima.
At the sight of these divine miracles the proconsul Lisbius, under the guidance of the apostle, made progress in the faith, and faithfully obeyed his counsels in all things.
One day when they were both sitting on the sea-shore, and many persons were there listening with the greatest attention to the word of God from the apostle's lips, a dead body was thrown by the waves at the feet of Andrew, who soon brought it to life again after he had offered up a prayer to God.
The body was that of a young man named Philopater, son of Sostratus, a Macedonian citizen.
He bewailed the loss of his companions who were drowned, and supplicated Andrew to restore them to him;
upon which the apostle addressed his prayers to heaven, and the waves, obeying his commands, brought to the shores thirty- nine corpses, which he restored to life, commanding each of the brethren who were there to lay his band upon a corpse, and to say to it:
“May Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, raise you from the dead."
In this manner thirty-nine men came to life again, and glorified the Lord Almighty.
After performing many miracles and good works, of which it would be impossible for me to give a particular account, the blessed apostle Andrew went to Patras,1 where Maximilla the wife of the proconsul Egeas,2 who had suc­ ceeded Lisbius lay seriously ill.
Then Effidima,2 who had been converted by the preaching of Sosias, besought the apostle to visit Maximilla, lying sick under an attack of fever.
He repaired to the bed-chamber of the sick woman, preceded by Effidima;
and, having prayed, the fever dis­ appeared, and the woman was cured.
The proconsul now offered to the holy man of God a hundred silver pieces, which he would not even look at.
While the blessed apostle was at Patras performing a great number of miracles, and many were led to embrace the faith of Christ by these displays of corporal succour, Stratocles, the brother of the proconsul Egeas, arrived from Italy.
He bad with him a slave named Algmana,3 of whom he was extremely fond, and who, having been attacked by a demon, lay in the court, foaming at the mouth.
This caused much disturbance, and Stratocles, whose grief was unbounded, at the instance of Maximilla and Effidima, sent for the blessed Andrew, who, by his prayers, healed the demoniac boy.
In consequence Stratocles believed in the Lord;
and, strengthened in the faith, attached himself to the apostle, in order to hear him preach the word of God.
Egeas had left for Macedonia;
and Maximilla, in the fervour of her spiritual love, sought continual opportunities of receiving from the apostle the heavenly doctrine, and piously devoted herself to him.
The proconsul therefore became highly incensed against the apostle, and indignant, because his wife, after she had re­ ceived the doctrine of salvation, would no longer share his bed.
I shall now endeavour to relate briefly the martyrdom1 of the most blessed Andrew, inserting carefully in my work the account which the pious devotion of our holy mother the church has preserved in her libraries, and faithfully recites.
The priests and deacons of the churches of Achaia were, doubtless, eye-witnesses of it clearly, and they described it well for the instruction of all the churches founded in the four climates of the globe.
2
The proconsul Egeas, on his return from Macedonia, went to Patras, a city of Achaia, and began to compel the believers in Christ to offer sacrifices to idols.
St. Andrew went to see him, and reasoned with him to bring him over to the true faith;
but wisdom could not penetrate his per­ verse mind.
Then the liberal steward of divine knowledge, although his attempts to profit the impious Egeas were not crowned with success, abundantly supplied the food of his heavenly doctrine to others who were predestinated to life.
He discoursed with wisdom on the mystery of the cross, showing plainly why God was made man and suffered for us, and fully explained the history of our Lord's passion, and the common advantages which mankind had derived from it.
Irritated at this discourse, Egeas ordered the apostle to be seized and thrown into prison, where multitudes visited him from almost every part of the province, intending to kill the proconsul and liberate the apostle by forcing the prison doors.
But Andrew restrained them by his salutary counsels, spending the whole night in teaching them, and, recalling to their memory the patience of the Lord Jesus, earnestly entreated the people not to offer any obstacle to his passion.
The next day the proconsul Egeas sent to have the apostle brought before him, and, sitting on the tribunal, employed every means to gain him over;
but the saint, whose faith was built on God, firmly resisted both his threats and his fair words.
Egeas at last ordered him to be stretched out and lashed with seven scourges of three thongs;
1 but, after re­ ceiving these stripes, the brave champion of Christ set forth the merits of the cross, and, notwithstanding the fury of the tyrant, firmly maintained the truth of his averments.
Then the enraged proconsul, exasperated to the last degree, ordered the apostle to be attached to the cross, com­ manding the ministers of torture to bind his feet and hands, and stretch his limbs as if be was placed on the wooden horse, that his sufferings might be protracted, because, if he were fastened with nails, he would die too soon.
As the holy man was led along by the executioners, he was followed by a great concourse of people who clamoured loudly, say­ ing:
"What has this just man, the friend of God, done, that you are leading him to be crucified?"
But Andrew walked with composure and cheerfulness, begging the crowd not to hinder his passion, and continuing to teach his saving doctrine.
When he had arrived at the spot which was to witness his last struggle, and saw the cross at a distance, he exclaimed in a loud voice:
" Hail, 0 cross, consecrated by having borne the body of Christ, and adorned by having his limbs attached to thee as if they were precious jewels!
0, good cross, that hast received from these thy lustre and beauty;
long desired, dearly loved, sought for unceasingly, and now, at last, prepared for my longing soul!"
Having given utterance to this and much more full of love and devo­ tion, the apostle stripped himself, and gave his clothes to the executioners, who drew near the cross, on which they stretched his limbs, and suspended him with cords.
In this cruel manner they executed the orders of the impious pro­ consul.
A crowd of more than twenty thousand men stood round, exclaiming that the holy man was suffering unjustly;
among whom was Stratocles, the brother of Egeas.
St. Andrew comforted the minds of the faithful, exhorting them to patience under worldly afflictions, because martyrdom was the best road to an eternal reward.
Meantime, the multitude thronged to the palace of Egeas, shouting with one accord, “ What sentence is this you have pronounced, proconsul ?
You have given an unrighteous judgment.
Grant us the life of this just man;
restore to us this holy man;
do not put to death a man who is dear to God.”
Egeas, hearing these and other such cries of the people, was seized with fear, and promising to take the apostle down, immediately went with them towards the place of execution.
As soon as St. Andrew saw him, he exhorted him to believe in Christ, and to have recourse to the faith for his salvation while it was still in his power.
All this time, suspended from the cross, he serenely triumphed;
and, enjoying the vision of Christ, whom he had loved with all his soul and long desired to see, in his excessive joy he ex­ claimed :
"I now see my King;
I now adore him;
I am come into his presence."
Then the executioners, handling the cross,were unable to touch him;
and, though they all made suc­ cessively repeated efforts to loose him, the arms of those who attempted to take him down became benumbed.
Then St. Andrew cried with a loud voice, and poured forth a devout prayer to God.
After having prayed for a long time to Jesus, his good Master, he was suddenly surrounded in the sight of all the people, by an extraordinary light flashing like lightning from heaven, too bright for human eyes to bear.
This luminous appearance continued about half an hour, and, at the moment when it vanished, Andrew, the illustrious champion of Christ, gave up the ghost, and went with it to meet the Lord.
Maximilla, a woman of senatorial rank, respectfully removed his body ;
and, having caused it to be embalmed, interred it in a well-chosen spot.
But Egeas was seized by a demon as be was returning to his palace, and died tormented by the evil spirit, on the public road, in the presence of all the people.
As for Strato­ cles, the brother of Egeas, he would not touch the smallest portion of his fortune, but withdrew, carrying with him the body of the holy apostle Andrew.
All the inhabitants of the province were seized with such a consternation that not a person remained who did not believe in the Saviour, our God.
It is reported that, from the sepulchre of St. Andrew, manna like flour, and oil of an exquisite odour flow, which indicate to the inhabitants of that country what will be the fertility of the year.
If the produce be small, the earth gives her fruit sparingly;
if, on the contrary, the yield be abundant, the harvest is also great.
1Glorious apostle of Jesus Christ!
inspired by a singular affection for thee, I have briefly described the course of thy life so happily adorned with divine grace, to the praise of thy omnipotent Master to whom thou didst remain faithfully devoted until death.
Gentle Andrew, kindly take under thy patronage me, thy devoted servant, and recom­ mend me, sinner that I am, by thy pious prayers, to the Creators mercy, in whose worship I desire, with his aid, to remain constant through good and evil.
As thou didst, when hanging on the cross, exhort the cruel Egeas, thy persecutor, to embrace the true faith, succour unceasingly the faithful sons of the church, who, with the utmost devo­ tion of their hearts and the modulations of their voices, address to thee this pious canticle:
“ Blessed Andrew, the gentlest of the saints, obtain for us the pardon of our offences;
and by thy intercession, raise up us who are weighed down by the burden of our sins.
We are tossed among the turmoils of a reeling world, and groan in our weakness.
Beseech the majesty of the Lord that he will grant us the enjoyment of the true light.
Amen!
"JAMES and John, the sons of Zebedee, were named by Christ Boanerges, or, what would read much better, Boane­ reem,1 that is to say, the sons of thunder ;
on account of the strength and greatness of the faith with which they kept inviolably, and taught in all its purity, the law of the Lord.
James [Jacobus] signifies he that supplants, but John the grace of God, or in whom is grace.
These elect brethren well merited such distinguished names, as, by supplanting of vice, they obtained a brilliant victory over the crooked serpent on the stage of this frail life, and became the especial friends of God, and, full of his manifold grace, enlightened our holy mother the church with the doctrine of truth.
I have inserted in the preceding Book of this work,2 a plain and short account of the blessed James, carefully abridged from the writings of ancient authors;
relating how he carried the gospel into Judea and Samaria, and how he suffered martyrdom by the command of Herod, the son of Aristobulus, on the accusation of the chief priests and pharisees.
I now enter on the inquiry what has been written respecting
John the diviner the beloved disciple of Jesus Christ;
desiring to make a brief summary of all that relates to him, to the glory of the God of Sabaoth.
I shall consult what Mellitus4 wrote to the Laodiceans and the other faithful brethren scattered over the face of the earth, and what other celebrated antiquarians have published relating to St. John, especially Jerome, the commentator on the holy scriptures, in his preface to the Apocalypse.
John, the apostle and evangelist, was chosen to perpetual celibacy by the Lord Jesus Christ, who loved him more than all the other disciples, insomuch that he allowed him to recline on his bosom at the paschal supper, and after­ wards committed to him the care of his own mother, when he was the only disciple standing by the cross;
thus appointing to the guardianship of a virgin, one whom he had called to perpetual chastity at the time when he thought of marrying.
While John was publicly preaching the word of God in Asia, and incessantly bearing testimony to Jesus Christ both to Jews and Gentiles, an accusation against him was forwarded to Rome by the malicious enemies of the truth.
By order of Domitian, who, after the example of Nero, raised the second persecution of the Christians, he was carried off from Ephesus, and brought before Cæsar and the senate, near the Latin gate.
Standing firm in the true faith, as immovable as a strong and lofty mountain, he was thrown into a caldron of boiling oil, by Domitian's command, on the second of the nones [6th] of May;
but, protected by the divine grace, he came out of it unhurt.
On that day, in every year the faithful devoutly celebrate a festival to his memory.
He was then banished to the isle of Patmos, where he wrote the Apocalypse, in which the condition and order of the church are described, as foreshown to him, in seven stages, together with the depths of tribulation and the rewards of good deeds.
At length, by the providence of God, who disposes all things aright, the same year that John was banished, the Roman senate condemned Domitian to death for his cruel­ ties 2 and declared also, by a general decree, that all the orders issued by the emperor should be considered null and void.
In consequence of this decree, St. John the apostle, who, by command of Domitian, had been banished, with ignominy, returned to Ephesus with honour, amid general rejoicings.
For the whole population of Ephesus went out to meet him on his return, and both men and women, in the faithful expression of their joy, exclaimed as if with one voice, “ Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
"As John was entering the city, behold they were carrying to the grave the corpse of Drusiana, who, loving him fer­ vently,.
had desired to see him before her death.
The widows, and the poor, parents and orphans, all wept together, and exclaimed:
“St.
John, the apostle of God, you see us bearing to the grave Drusiana, who, following your holy counsels, fed us all, served God in chastity and humility, and, sighing for your return, said daily:
‘ 0 that I could see with my own eyes the apostle of God before I die !’ ”
Then the blessed John having commanded them to put down the bier, and to uncover the corpse, said with a loud voice:
" Drusiana, may my Lord Jesus Christ restore thee to life!
Rise up on thy feet, and return to thy house, and there pre­ pare refreshment for me.”
Immediately she arose, and obeyed the apostle's command with great joy, as well she might, for it seemed to her that she had been awakened not from death, but from sleep.
And then the people ceased not shouting, for the space of three hours:
" There is but one God, he whom St. John preaches;
there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ.
"At that time, two brothers, who were extremely rich, sold their inheritance by the advice of Crato the philosopher, and bought diamonds of singular value, which they crushed in the forum before all the people;
thus making an osten­ tatious exhibition of their contempt for the world.
St. John happening to be passing through the forum, witnessed this display, and pitying the folly of these misguided men, kindly gave them sounder advice.
Sending for Crato their master, who had led them into error, he blamed the wasteful de­ struction of valuable property, and instructed him in the true meaning of contempt for the world according to Christ's doctrine ;
quoting the precept of that teacher, his own master, when, in reply to the young man who inquired of him how he might obtain eternal life, he said:
“ If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven;
and come and follow me.”
1 Crato the philosopher, acknowledging the soundness of the apostle's teaching, entreated him to restore the jewels which had been foolishly crushed to their former condition.
St. John then gathered up the precious frag­ ments, and while he held them in his hand, prayed for some time, with his eyes raised to heaven.
His prayer being concluded, and all the faithful present having said Amen, the broken pieces of the jewels became so closely united that there remained not the slightest appearance of any fracture.
Then Crato the philosopher, with all his disciples, threw himself at the apostle's feet, believed, and were bap­ tized;
and Crato, preaching openly the faith of the Lord Jesus, became a true philosopher.
2
Moreover, the two brothers, who before destroyed their property to no purpose, now, in obedience to the evangelical precept, sold their jewels and distributed the price in alms to the poor of Christ.
And a multitude of believers began to attach themselves to St. John and to follow his steps.
Atticus and Eugenius, two brothers,3 and noble Ephesians, imitated the conduct of the youths already mentioned;
selling all that they had and distributing to the poor, and becoming followers of the apostle as he went about the cities preaching the word of God.
It happened that as they were entering Pergamus they beheld their own slaves parading in garments of silk, and making a display of worldly vanities.
The devil's malice shot the arrow, when the pride of the two brothers was wounded at seeing their slaves swaggering and gay, while they were poor and reduced to a single cloak.
The blessed apostle, comprehending the wiles of Satan, directed that bundles of straight twigs and small pebbles from the sea-shore should be brought to him.
When this was done, he called on the name of the Lord, and the twigs were turned into gold.
and the pebbles into precious stones.
Then the holy apostle said to the brothers:
“ Go, for seven days, among the goldsmiths and jewellers, and let me know when you have tested your gold and dia­ monds.
’’"The brothers accordingly went round the work­ men's shops, and returning at the end of the seven days informed the apostle that the goldsmiths declared the gold to be pure, and the jewellers pronounced the stones precious.
Then St. John said:
" Go, now, and re-purchase the lands which you sold, for you have lost the heavenly inheritance.
Clothe yourselves in robes of silk, that you may be as gay as the rose for a season.
The flower is delightful both for its scent and colour, but soon fades.
You envied the ap­ pearance of your slaves, and regretted that you had reduced yourselves to poverty;
flourish then for a while that you may decay and perish;
be rich in this world, that you may be stripped of all in the next.
Is not the band of the Lord powerful to make his servants abound in wealth and above measure glorious ?
But he has appointed a trial of the soul, that men may believe that these will obtain eternal riches, who for his sake have relinquished their worldly ad­ vantages.
”While the blessed John was delivering these edifying precepts and others like them, and descanting nobly on the misery and contempt of the world, on apostacy, and perse­ verance in well-doing, it happened that a young man named Stacteus was followed to his grave by his mother who was a widow.
In her deep affliction the mother, with the crowd of people attending the funeral, threw themselves at the apostle's feet, and besought him with many tears, that in the name of God he would restore this young man to life, as he had done in the case of Drusiana, and kindly relieve the distress of his mother and his newly married wife.
Then the apostle knelt down and prayed for some time weeping, thrice rising from his supplications, lifting his hands to heaven and praying in secret.
Then he directed the body to be loosed from the grave-clothes, and calling on the youth by name, commanded him to arise and give a true account of what he had seen while he was dead.
Then Stacteus arose, and worshipping the apostle began to rebuke his disciples:
"I saw," he said, "your angels weeping, while Satan's angels were rejoicing at your humiliation.
I saw the kingdom prepared for you, and chambers garnished with bright jewels, full of delights, feasts, riches;
endless life, eternal light, and all the joys which you have lost.
I saw also the chambers of darkness, for which, alas !
you have made the exchange,-full of dragons and pit-falls, full of hissing flames and torments, full of corruption and sorrow."
While Stacteus was describing these and similar scenes, the crowd of people who listened to him were struck with amazement.
But Atticus and Eugenius, with the young man raised from the dead, threw themselves at the apostle's feet together, and entreated him to intercede with the Lord on their behalf.
At length, St. John gave this answer to their entreaties, that they should do penance for thirty days, during which time their chief prayer to God should be that the golden twigs should be restored to their primitive state, and the stones become as worthless as they were at first.
It turned out, however, that the thirty days elapsed without the gold being changed into twigs, or the jewels into peb­ bles.
The brothers then came to the apostle in great distress, and besought his clemency with many tears and prayers.
Compassionating their grief and penitence, and moved by the intercessions of the multitude on their behalf, the apostle then ordered the twigs to be carried back to the wood, and the pebbles to the beach, restored to their own nature.
Upon which, the two brothers recovered the grace they had forfeited, so that, as they had done before, they cast out devils, healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, and performed many miracles in the name of the Lord.
While the name of John was in every one's mouth, and his character reverenced, not only at Ephesus, but through the whole province of Asia Minor, that city became the scene of tumults raised by the idol-worshippers.
The heathen, roused to frenzy, dragged John to the temple of Diana, and used all their efforts to induce him to join in their impure sacrifices.
But he, inspired by the Holy Spirit, proposed to them that they should accompany him to the church dedicated to Christ, and, invoking the aid of Diana, lay it in ruins by her power ;
while, if they failed of success, he would, in the name of the God he served, over­ throw the temple of Diana and destroy her image.
Reason would convince them that, if he did this, they ought to abandon their vain superstition, and follow the path of the true and right faith.
A proposal of this sort was suited to the popular impulse, although some few objected to affairs being put on such an issue.
And now John gently ex­ horted the crowd to stand aloof while he with a devout mind prayed audibly to Almighty God.
Immediately the temple and all its shrines fell to pieces and were ground to powder, like dust scattered by the wind from the face of the earth.
The same day twelve thousand heathens, not counting women and children, were converted and received baptism in the name of the holy Trinity.
Then Aristo­ demus, who was chief pontiff of all the idol temples, at the instigation of the evil spirit, stirred up the commonalty to a new insurrection, in which citizen was ready to fight against citizen.
Upon which John, whose loving mind was bent on preserving peace, addressed himself to Aristodemus, saying:
" Tell me, 0 Aristodemus, what I can do to abate your indignation."
The pontiff replied:
" If you desire that I should believe in your God, drink the poison which I will give you, and should you escape death it will be manifest that yours is, indeed, the true God."
The apostle assent­ ing to this proposal, Aristodemus, to strike terror into him, went to the proconsul and begged of him two culprits who lay under sentence of decapitation for their crimes.
Having obtained his consent, they were brought into the forum, and there, having drunk poison in the presence of the apostle and all the people, forthwith expired.
Then the blessed John, standing over their dead bodies, fear­ lessly took into his hands the poisoned cup, and making the sign of the cross over it, with devout prayers, be re­ counted to all who were within hearing the marvellous works of God.
Having ended his discourse, he armed him­ self with the sign of the cross, and, draining the cup to the dregs, remained uninjured, offering thanksgiving to God.
Upon which the spectators shouted:
" There is one only true God, and John is his prophet.
"Meanwhile, Aristodemus, after narrowly watching the apostle for the space of three hours, and perceiving that he neither looked pale nor exhibited any signs of fear, was so far from yielding to the truth that he hardened his heart against it, though the by-standers complained loudly of his withholding his belief.
At last, he required that the prisoners who had died by the poison should be restored to life, upon which all doubt would be removed from his mind.
The crowd, however, were incensed with rage, and threatened that they would set fire to his house and throw him into the flames if he ventured further to persecute the Lord's apostle.
Whereupon, John, perceiving that a desperate conflict was impending between the faithful and the unbelievers, interposed and thus addressed the sur­ rounding throng:
" Patience is an exemplary virtue, one of the divine graces which it is our duty to imitate.
If then Aristodemus.
is still held in the bonds of unbelief, let it be ours to set him free;
and I will never desist from my undertaking until I have found a remedy for his disordered mind, like a skilful physician who perseveringly adapts his cure to the various forms of his patient's disease.
In the case of this distempered man, if what has been done already fails of restoring him to a sound mind, we must do some­ thing which hitherto has not been tried."
He then called Aristodemus to him and invested him with his own tunic, while he himself stood covered with his mantle, and gave these directions to the pontiff:
" Go, and, stretching yourself upon the corpses of the deceased malefactors, say:
“John, the apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ, bath sent me unto you, that in his name you may be restored to life, and that all may know that life and death obey Jesus Christ, my Lord and master.”
Aristodemus obeyed the apostle's com­ mand, and, struck with astonishment at the restoration of the dead men, worshipped John, and, hastening to the proconsul, eagerly related to him all that had occurred, and then with a wise determination, he said to the proconsul:
"Let us go to the apostle, and implore his pardon on bended knees."
This they accordingly did, and John, lovingly receiving them, offered up on their behalf prayer and thanks­ giving to God, and enjoined on them a week's fasting.
At the expiration of this, the apostle baptized them, with their parents, their kindred and their whole households;
and they destroyed their idol images, and dedicated a church to the honour of St. John, in which he was afterwards buried.
When, at last, the blessed John was ninety-nine1 years of age, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him with his disciples saying:
" Come unto me, for it is time that thou shouldest sit down to feast, with thy brethren, in my kingdom," Then John, arising, prepared to depart;
but the Lord said to him:
" On the Sunday, which is the anniversary of my resurrection, three days hence, thou shalt come unto me :
" and having thus spoken ascended to heaven.
On the Lord's day following, therefore, the whole multitude of the faithful assembled with John in the church erected in his name, where he celebrated the divine mysteries from cock-crowing to the third hour, when he addressed the congregation, saying:
"Brethren and fellow servants, co-heirs and par­ takers of the kingdom of God, ye know what gifts and graces, and signs and miracles, together with doctrine, our Lord Jesus Christ hath vouchsafed to you through my ministry.
Henceforth continue without csasing to walk in his commandments, for the Lord is pleased now to call me out of this world.
"Thereupon he caused a grave to be dug near the stately1 altar, and the earth thrown up to be carried out of the church.
He then descended into the grave, and, lifting up his hands to the Lord, said:
" 0 Lord Jesu Christ, at thy summons I come, with thanksgiving, to the heavenly ban­ quet to which thou hast graciously vouchsafed to invite me, knowing that I have desired thee with my whole heart.
Beholding thy face, I am restored to life even from the tomb.
The odour of thy presence sheds in my heart desires of everlasting life.
Thy voice is sweeter than honey, and thy words far beyond angelic eloquence.
I have committed to writing thy works which my own eyes have seen, and thy words which I heard with my own ears.
And now, Lord, I commend to thee thy children which their virgin mother the church bath regenerated in thy name by water and the Holy Ghost.
Receive me now, that I may join the com­ pany of my brethren, with whom thou appearedst to call me o thy presence.
Open unto me the gate of life and lead me to the heavenly banquet, in which all thy faithful dis­ ciples feast with thee.
For thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, who, according to the will of the Father, didst become the Saviour of the world.
To thee, therefore, we give thanks for ever and ever."
And when all the people had answered " Amen !" the apostle was surrounded, for the space of an hour, with a light so effulgent that no eye could bear to look on it.
It was then discovered that the grave had been filled up, and contained manna only, which the place produces to the present day;
being distin­ guished by the multitude of miracles in honour of him who was in an especial manner our Lord's beloved disciple.
Crowds resort to the spot, pouring out prayers and supple cations to God, receiving through the merits of St. John, the apostle and evangelist, answers to their petitions, and obtaining by his intercession the relief they implore from their diseases and sufferings.
Among whom let me, sinner that I am, present myself, humbly paying my devotions, and pouring forth my heart in prayer, with faith and hope, to the beloved disciple of our Lord:
­" 0 blessed John, our Lord's familiar friend, who wert chosen by the same Lord Jesus Christ to be a virgin, and, being loved more than others, and, specially taught in the heavenly mysteries, became his most distinguished apostle and evangelist, I humbly implore thy aid;
beseeching thee, that unworthy as I aID, yet being thy devoted follower, thou wouldest vouchsafe to listen to my petitions.
Pity, I be­ seech thee, the pains and sorrows which I continually suffer, and, regarding my manifold infirmities of body and troubles of mind, cause them to be effectually removed by virtue of thy living merits and devout prayers to the Lord on my behalf, that being cleansed from my sins I may be worthy to join, without ceasing, in the heavenly worship, and with the white-robed company of the faithful, offer eternal praises to the Lord God of Sabaoth.
Amen!"JAMES the less, the son of Alpheus, is called in the Gospel our Lord's brother, because Mary, the wife of Alpheus, who is named by John the Baptist Mary the wife of Cleophas, was the aunt of our Lord's mother.
Im­ mediately after the ascension, James was ordained by the apostles bishop of Jerusalem, which see he filled during thirty years.
He was held in deep reverence by all the other apostles, both on account of his great sanctity and his kindred to our Lord;
so that, however they were dispersed in their mission of preaching the gospel through distant regions, they, from time to time, resorted to him as their common father, and humbly implored his counsels, as their master, when occasion required.
At length, in the seventh year of Nero's reign, while James was preaching Christ the Son of God, at Jerusalem, he was thrown headlong from that temple by the Jews and stoned to death, and buried there near the temple on the first of May.
1Jlegesippus,2 a holy and learned man, who lived near the apostles' times, mentions James the Just in the fifth book of his Commentaries;
relating that after the death of Festus, who succeeded Felix as proconsul of Judæa, while the pro­ vince was without a governor and chief before the appoint­ ment of Albinus, James, the brother of the Lord, was cruelly martyred by the Jews.
He was sanctified from his mothers womb;
wine or strong drink he never tasted, nor ate flesh;
steel never approached his head, nor were his limbs anointed with oil, and he never used the bath.
He wore no garments made of wool, but contented himself with a wrapping of coarse cloth.
He spent his time in solitary prayer for the pardon of his people, until, by continual kneeling, his knees became callous, like those of a camel.
His marvellous self-denial and rigid virtue obtained for him the surname of the Just, and of Oblias, which signifies the defence of the people.
A person belonging to one of the seven Jewish sects having asked him what was meant by Jesus being the door,1 he replied:
" It means the Saviour."
The Jews, indeed, are divided among themselves into seven sects, all of which have departed from the way of truth.
Thus the Pharisees and Sadducees, the Essenes and Galileans, the Hemero-baptists, the Masbuthæans, and the Samaritans,2 glory in distinct names, and hold and defend with obstinacy the various doctrines which they severally adopt.
Some of these, through the ministry of James, were converted to the faith of Christ.
But when many of the principal Jews believed in Jesus, the scribes and pharisees were in great consternation, and said:
"What remains, but that all the people should speedily believe that Jesus is the Christ ?"
They then, acting in concert, presented themselves to James, and courteously besought him to ascend a pinnacle of the temple at the feast of the passover, and bear a true testi­ mony concerning Christ to the multitudes of Jews and Gentiles assembled at the feast, both from the neigh­ bourhood and from distant countries.
The apostle was filled with joy at the opportunity thus afforded him ot declaring the truth, and gave his consent to what they entreated, though not according to what those wicked men designed;
for the just man knew that this was directed by divine inspiration, and therefore it was that he acceded to their request.
Standing, accordingly, on a pinnacle of the temple, he addressed the people with a loud voice, showing clearly and without doubt that Jesus, the Son of God, had fulfilled all that the prophets had foretold concerning him.
The apostle James, having now concluded his faithful dis­ course, the multitudes shouted with joy, " Hosanna to the Son of David! "
But the pharisees and other enemies of the truth were greatly troubled, and, taking counsel together, ex­ claimed, " Oh !
Oh !
The Just one also is deceived."
Then was fulfilled what is written in the book of Wisdom, " We will take away the just, for he is unprofitable to US."
3
The pharisees now ascending to the place where he stood, said to him:
"We entreated thee to disabuse the people of their error concerning Jesus, but thou hast given it strength ;
" to which James replied, "I have opened their eyes to their error, and given them to see the truth."
The pharisees therefore finding that the multitude received with joy the preaching of the apostle, and believed in Christ, threw him from the summit of the temple and began to stone him.
But he fell on his knees praying, " 0 Lord, my God and Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
While he was thus praying, and stones were being showered upon him, one of the priests, a son of Rechab, cried out, " Spare him, I beseech ye, spare him, what do ye ?
The Just one whom you are stoning prays for you."
Then one of the pharisees, in a frenzy of rage, seized a fuller's beam and struck the apostle violently on the head and beat out his brains.
Thus was the martyrdom of the confessor of Jesus Christ accomplished, and he was interred near the temple on the calends [1st] of May.
1Shortly afterwards, Vespasian waged war against the Jews, which the wisest of them believed was ordained by divine Providence as a retribution for their cruelty to James the Just, as is clearly seen in the works of Josephus, the celebrated Hebrew historian.
While the unbelieving Jews were exposed to double peril, the church of God, triumphing in a true faith and saving grace, invokes the help of her intrepid warrior in her daily conflicts with pure devotion and in these exalted words:
"
Have compassion, 0 Jacob the Just, brother of our Lord, on us who are puffed up with pride and vainglory and polluted with the lusts of the world;
mercifully hear our prayers, and procure for us the joys of the divine light.
Thou who didst pray for thy enemies, vouchsafe thy aid to us who are devoted to thee, that we may obtain the everlasting reward.
Amen."PHILIP is interpreted the lamp's mouth;
by which name it is signified that he was entirely open to the infusion of a twofold charity, obeying the divine commands and imbued with sacred graces;
so that, like a shining lamp, he enlightened barbarous races by his bright example and true doctrine.
Born at Bethsaida, a town of Galilee, lie was among the first who followed the steps of Christ.
After our Lord's ascension he preached the gospel during twenty years to the Gauls or Galatians, and Scythians, thus bringing different nations to the knowledge of the true light.
It happened while he was in Scythia that, being seized by the heathen and dragged before an image of Mars to compel him to sacrifice to the idol, an enormous serpent issued from the base of the statue and struck dead the son of the pontiff, who was serving the fire for the sacrifice, as well as the two tribunes who govern­ ed the province, and wrhose officers held the apostle Philip in bonds.
The venom exhaled by the serpent also infected all who were present, so that they began to faint and to ex­ hibit symptoms of severe disorder.
Then Philip exhorted them all to believe in God, and to throw down and break in pieces the statue of Mars, fixing in its place the cross of our Lord, as the object of their adoration ;
adding that, if they did this, the languishing would recover, the dead be restored to life, and the deadly serpent be put to flight in the name of Christ.
Those who were suffering immediately exclaimed in the bitterness of their pains:
" Restore our strength and we will cast down the statue."
The apostle thereupon called for silence and exorcised the serpent in the name of the Lord, commanding it to depart forthwith, and without injuring any one, betake itself to the wilderness and dwell in solitary places far from the paths of men.
Upon this, the fierce serpent went forth and, gliding quickly away, was no more seen.
The apostle also in the name of the Lord raised to life the son of the pontiff and the tribunes who had been struck dead, and also restored to health the crowd who were infected by the serpent's venom.
All those who had persecuted Philip repented, and were ready to worship him, supposing him a god.
But he, diligently instructing them for a whole year, imbued their minds with the knowledge of the supreme God, and zealously sowed in the hearts of the believers all that belonged to the true faith.
Many thousands were thus con­ verted and baptized by the apostle.
By the abundant aid of divine grace, Philip also built many churches, and ordained in them bishops and priests, with the other ecclesiastical orders.
Being recalled to Asia by a revelation, he took up his abode at Hierapolis, where he eradicated the malignant heresy of the Ebionites, who deny that Jesus was the Son of G-od, and do not believe that he took a true human body- in the virgin's womb.
Two of Philip's daughters accompanied him, consecrated virgins, by whose ministry the Lord increased the numbers of such holy women.
The apostle himself, seven days before his death, assembled the priests and deacons, with the bishops of the neighbouring cities, and predicted in their presence that he should live only seven days longer, and he enjoined them all to stand firmly in the faith, and to be always mindful of the doctrine of the Lord.
Then the blessed apostle, having exhorted the people at great length, departed in the Lord in the eightieth year of his age and on the 8th of May, his sacred remains being interred at Hierapolis.
Some years afterwards his two daughters were buried there, one on his right the other on his left;
and many miracles are performed by the merits of the apostle in answer to faithful prayers;
and there resort affianced spouses, and joyfully chant with loud voices:
" Prostrate before thy tomb, 0 Philip, mouth of the lamp, we beseech thee to cause our petitions to reach the ears of the Almighty Judge, that we may be saved from the punishment we have deserved and obtain the heavenly joys for which we pray.
Amen.1"THOMAS signifies an abyss, and Didymus a twin, because this apostle, like our Saviour, was full of grace and heavenly gifts.
He preached the gospel to the Parthians and Medes, the Hircanians and Persians, the Bactrians and Indians, and suffered martyrdom in the city of Calamine the 12th of the calends of January [21st of December] not long afterwards he became illustrious by numerous miracles in the city of Edessa.
We find many variations in the accounts given of the apostles, arising both from their remote antiquity, and from the vast distance of the regions in which the labourers in Christ's field preached- to the barbarians, who so widely differed from the Romans both in their customs and in their languages.
We may therefore have our doubts of some things which have been handed down to us respecting the holy apostles, because they have come to us from authors but little known;
and more especially because pope Gelasius and other learned doctors have pronounced them to be apocryphal.
The illustrious prelate, St. Augustine,1 also hesitated respecting some works of this description, and has furnished an example against Faustus the Manichean, in his scrupulous researches in regard to the life of St. Thomas.
What I have remarked on these contradictions, which are discovered in ancient records through all parts of the world, is not intended to disparage the accounts of the miracles of holy men, but that whatever is recorded of the apostles or other saints by the diligence of early writers should be examined with extreme caution,2 for the confirmation of the faith and the edification of manners.
I will now, in the name of God, pursue briefly my narrative of St. Thomas's journeyings, which were abundantly fruitful, his preaching Christ with glorious success, and his painful passage, by martyrdom to eternal life.
Thomas Didymus being at Cæsarea, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him and commended him to Abbanes the minis­ ter of Gondafor, king of the Indians, who invited him to return with him to India, and build a royal palace after the Roman manner.
During the voyage Thomas conversed mysteriously with Abbanes on the knowledge of his art, and engaged to execute wonderful works of all kinds in marble and wood.
On the seventh day they reached Andronopolis, after a prosperous voyage, and as they were landing were struck with the sounds of voices singing to the music of flutes and pipes and harps.
They learnt that the king of that city was celebrating the nuptials of his daughter Pelagia with Dionysius.
Heralds proceeded through the streets, proclaim­ ing that all should come to the royal banquet, whether rich or poor, nobles, citizens or strangers ;
and that whoever refused would offend the prince.
Abbanes and Thomas, therefore, presented themselves among the guests;
but Thomas, as was his habit, took no part in the merriment and the feast, but was wholly occupied in heavenly contemplation.
Meanwhile, a Hebrew female singer, with a flute in her hand, went round the tables singing such melodies as any of the guests required;
but when she came near St. Thomas, she stood lingering be­ fore him, for observing that he neither ate nor drank, but that his eyes were raised to heaven, she comprehended that he was a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the Lord of heaven.
Rejoic­ ing therefore at finding one of her own race, she began sing­ ing in her mother tongue :
"
The God of the Hebrews is one only God ;
the Creator of all things;
who made the heavens and the earth, and laid the foundations of the seas."
On hearing this, the apostle prayed more fervently, desiring the Hebrew girl to repeat the sacred words she had sung, with greater care.
The steward of the feast, however, rebuked St. Thomas because he neither ate nor drank, buffeting him on the face.
The apostle then predicted in Hebrew what would presently befall him before the end of the banquet.
And thus it happened;
the steward going forth to draw water from a fountain, a lion attacked him, and, after sucking his blood, departed.
Dogs came and devoured his limbs, and one of these animals, which was black, came into the guest- chamber carrying in his mouth the right hand which had buffeted the apostle.
The guests were struck with astonish­ ment at this spectacle, but the Hebrew singer, who alone understood the apostle's prediction, threw down her flute, and running to him began to kiss his feet, exclaiming:
"This is either a prophet or an apostle of God:
for when the steward struck him he foretold this catastrophe in the Hebrew tongue, saying, 'I shall not rise from this banquet until I see that hand brought hither by a black dog.'
"The king, inquiring the cause of the disturbance and hearing what had happened, called the apostle aside, and entreated him to give his blessing to his daughter and her husband.
St. Thomas therefore accompanied the king to the bride-chamber, and placing his hands with prayer on the heads of both the espoused, gave them his blessing in the name of God, repeating also the names of the patriarchs.
The apostle was then leaving the chamber, conducted by the bridegroom, when a branch of a palm-tree loaded with fruit, suddenly appeared in the hand of the young prince.
It filled him with delight, and he ran quickly to the bride and plucked the fruit for her to taste;
and when they bad both partaken of it, they suddenly fell asleep, and both dreamed the same dream.
They saw, as it were, a mighty king with a jewelled crown and ornaments, who stood between them, and embracing both, thus addressed them:
"My apostle hath given you his blessing, to the end that ye may be partakers of everlasting life."
On their waking, each told the other the vision they had seen, when, behold St. Thomas stood in their presence, saying:
" My Lord and King, who just now spoke to you in the vision, brought me in hither, although the doors are shut, in order that the blessing I gave you may be brought to good effect.
Tours is the innocence which is the queen of all virtues, and the fruit of everlasting salvation.
Virginity is the sister of angels, and the earnest of all felicity;
virginity is the victory gained over the passions, the trophy of faith, a triumph over the enemy, and an assurance of eternal rest.
For from corrup­ tion springs uncleanness, from uncleanness guilt, from guilt dismay.
St.
Thomas having discoursed thus, and more at large, in praise of virginity, and on the foulness of lust, with the many inconveniences which frequently arise from carnal intercourse, Dionysius and Pelagia thankfully listened to the teaching of the apostle, and thereupon two angels appeared to them:
" We are angels," they said, " sent by God, in consequence of the apostle's blessing, that as long as you observe his precepts, we may offer to the Lord all your petitions.
"Instructed by these and other pious monitions, the husband and bride threw themselves at the apostle's feet, saying, " Confirm us in all truth, that nothing relating to the knowledge of God be wanting to us."
The apostle answered, " I will come to you the following night, and fully instruct you before I depart."
He came accordingly, and having initiated them both into the mysteries of eternal life, he sanctified them by the water of baptism.
After these events he resumed his voyage;
but in the course of time he sent them one of his disciples, whom he ordained priest, in order that he might be stationed and establish a church in that city, in which a multitude of people were converted to God.
It became the seat of St. Thomas the apostle, and the Catholic faith is held there to the present day.
Dionysius became bishop, his wife received from his hands the consecrated veil, and after his death completed her twofold martyrdom;
having renounced her marriage rights, she refused also to sacrifice to idols.
She was consequently beheaded for'her confession of Christ;
and the following inscription was placed over her tomb in the Greek tongue:
" IN THIS PLACE LIES THE WIFE OF DIONYSIUS THE BISHOP, AND DAUGHTER OF THOMAS THE APOSTLE.
"On their arrival at Hierapolis, a city of India,1 Abbanes presented himself before his king Gondafor, and informed him that he had brought with him a skilful architect whose name was Thomas.
The king consulted with him on the plans of the palace he proposed building, and pointed out to him the site on which he intended to erect it.
Thomas then took a rod, and measuring the ground said ;
"
Here I shall place the gates;
the entrance will be towards the east;
this first space will be the vestibule;
next will come an ante-chamber ;
then the hall of audience;
the fourth .
space will be the banqueting room;
the fifth, the winter chamber;
the sixth the summer chamber;
the seventh, the room for burning perfumes;
the eighth, the warm baths;
the ninth, the gymnasium;
the tenth, the kitchens;
the eleventh, the cisterns and tanks;
in the twelfth will be the hippodrome and circular portico for the promenade."
1
The king having considered this arrangement, said to Thomas;
"You are, in­ deed, an architect, and deserve to build palaces for kings and the king departed, leaving with him a large sum of money.
The apostle, however, began to journey through the provinces and cities, preaching the word of God, baptizing those who believed, and distributing alms abundantly among the poor.
He thus converted immense multitudes to the Lord, ordained priests, and built churches, and for two years, during the absence of Gondafor, established the faithful.
However, when the king returned and learnt how the apostle bad been employed, he ordered both him and Abbanes to be thrust into the lowest dungeon, bound in chains.
But while he was thinking of having them flayed alive and then burnt, his brother Gad died, and as he was much beloved there was great lamentation.
The barbarians, according to their usages, wrapped the corpse in purple and fine linen, adding jewelled ornaments, and the king com­ manded a monument to be erected to his brother of purple stone, aDd his body to be deposited in a sarcophagus of porphyry.
While the workmen were preparing these mag­ nificent works which delayed the performance of the funeral rites, Gad himself, the dead man, rose again the fourth day at the first hour, to the great astonishment and terror of all:
and the wailings, which according to Indian custom accompany a royal funeral, were hushed into silence.
Meanwhile Gad blamed the king his brother for designing to flay and to burn the favorite of Heaven, whom the angels obeyed.
He related that he had seen in heaven a wonder­ ful palace, planned in the manner Thomas had proposed, and reported besides much more on the merits of that holy man, and the secrets of heaven.
He then hastened to the prison, freed the apostle from his fetters, and throwing himself at his feet entreated his pardon for Gondafor.
As the apostle was taking his departure, the king himself now rendered more humane, came to meet him, and prostrat­ ing himself before him entreated his forgiveness.
And now the apostle, finding the opportunity favourable, applied himself to preaching amongst the barbarians and proclam­ ing the truth.
Among other things he said :
"
Jesus Christ, my Lord, hath shown you great favour in that he bath revealed his secrets to you.
Lo, your provinces arc full of churches ;
prepare yourselves, therefore, that you may be sanctified."
Such words and many more he addressed to the princes,­ instructing them in the faith and the true religion.
All India speedly heard the report of the wonders which the Lord wrought by the hands of his apostle, and great multitudes of people were gathered to him from the cities both far and near.
They proposed to pay him divine honours, offering him sacrifices of calves and rams, as they did to their gods.
Meanwhile king Gondafor, by the apostle's advice, commanded them to wait a month until the whole province was assembled, and that they should then do what he directed.
Accordingly, at the expiration of thirty days, multitudes of people assembled on the plain at the foot of mount Gazus, among whom there were a great number afflicted with divers disorders.
The apostle then desired them to gather all the sick into one body, and placing himself in the midst, he spread forth his hands to heaven and prayed on their behalf.
When his prayer was finished, a ray of light darted upon them with such force that they all thought themselves on the point of being destroyed by lightning.
They fell pros­ trate on the ground with the apostle, and remained in that position for nearly half an hour, being sensible that the gracious presence of God was among them ;
for many who had fevers, and the dumb, and the blind, and the lame, and those who had other disorders, were healed by the power of the Creator.
All now rose from the ground, at the apostle's command, and each one, full of joy for his recovery, glorified the Lord.
Then the blessed Thomas mounted on a rock where he could see all the people, and be seen of them, and calling for silence explained to them fully his true doctrine.
The Sunday following, nine thousand men were baptized, besides women and children.
The apostle afterwards, in conse­ quence of a revelation, undertook a journey to Upper India;
and there all the people hastened to hear him, and, being witness of the signs and wonders which he wrought, were so astonished that they did not dare to despise his preaching.
He cast out devils, gave sight to the blind, cleansed the lepers, healed all diseases, both rheums and fevers, and raised the dead.
A certain woman named Sintice, who had been blind for six years, was so cured that no sign was left of her former infirmity.
Hearing of this, the curiosity of Mygdonia, wife of Carisius, a cousin of the King Mesdeus, was excited, and disguising herself she mingled among her handmaids while the holy St. Thomas was preaching a saving discourse on the true God.
The whole multitude believed at the apostle's teaching, and after a fast of seven days received baptism.
Mygdonia, however, after hearing the apostle's discourse, would not again enter her husband's bed.
Upon this, Carisius went to the king in great anger, and obtained per­ mission to have the apostle arrested and thrown into prison.
But Sintice conducted Mygdonia to the prison, and by bribing the gaoler obtained access to the apostle's dungeon.
When he was informed of the faith of Mygdonia, he com­ manded her to return immediately to her own house, care­ fully close her chamber, and expect him.
Accordingly at midnight the apostle appeared in the chamber as he had promised, and comforting Mygdonia instructed her in the faith and appointed her a seven days' fast.
On the eighth, he returned in a similar manner, and baptized the believing woman, and all others who received the faith.
Meanwhile Carisius, whose sister King Mesdeus had married, begged that the queen Treptia might be sent to his own wife to endeavour to recall her to her conjugal duties.
King Mesdeus consenting, the queen went to Mygdonia, and lavish­ ing caresses on her, used every effort to induce her to return to her former habits.
But she, now confirmed in the faith of Christ, earnestly refused, and becoming a champion in the cause of truth, in her turn contended with Treptia, and ended by persuading her to yield to Christ.
For she replied to that queen with endearing words, adroitly in­ stilled into her mind a regard for the apostle, and gained her heart by a discourse of this kind :
"
My sister Treptia, if you knew all I have learnt, you would consider him not as a man but a god, for be gives hearing to the deaf, he has restored health in all manner of disorders, and sometimes he has even raised the dead.
He teaches that there is another and immortal life, free from pain and all sorrow.
This very night he restored life to a dead man;
for Sim­ forus, the captain of the soldiers, went to the prison and, taking upon himself the safe custody of the apostle, received him from the gaoler and conducted him to his own house.
The apostle having prayed, restored to life the only son of the captain, who lay dead.
Even now he remains in that house, teaching all who come to him, and healing all dis­ orders."
Treptia answered:
" If it be as you say, let us go and see this man ;
and if I find these things to be true, I also will immediately accept the faith.
It is unwise not to seek eternal life, and not to believe such extraordinary gifts."
They went therefore to the captain's house, but having entered were unable to obtain access to the apostle, who was engaged in laying his hands on people labouring under various infirmities.
The queen, at the sight of so many miracles, exclaimed in astonishment, " Cursed of God be those who do not believe the works of salvation."
Then a man was brought in by the apostle's command suffering from elephantiasis, of horrible appearance, with a hoarse voice, and his face rough with scabs.
The apostle wept over him, and praying a long time on bended knees, laid his hand on him, supplicating God.
Next, a boy appeared with a cheerful aspect, and, leading a leper from a retired corner, stripped him of his clothes, his skin also peeling off from his body like a tunic, or as when one flays a calf.
Being brought to the apostle, he signed him with the sign of the cross, and having baptized him, caused him to be clothed in new white garments.
At this spectacle the people magni­ fied God, and the queen kissing the apostle's feet entreated to be baptized ;
and he, perceiving that the time of his de­ parture from the body was at hand, baptized her with the rest who were present.
On the queen's return, she announced her conversion to the king, and expressed her determination to continue in the faith.
Then the king's heart was troubled, and his anger being raised against Carisius, he exclaimed, " While I was endeavouring to recover your wife, I have lost my own;
for Treptia is become worse to me than Mygdonia to thee."
Whereupon be sent for St. Thomas, commanding him to be brought into his presence with his hands bound behind his back.
The king on seeing him, commanded him to use his influence with the women he bad deceived to induce them to return to their conjugal duties.
Upon his refusing this, and endeavouring to bring his persecutors to a saving faith, the king ordered iron plates to be heated, and the apostle to be placed upon them, standing with bare feet, until he fainted from pain.
Immediately, however, a, spring burst forth, and cooled the iron plates.
Next, by the advice of Carisius, he was thrown into the furnace at the baths:
but they were unable to heat the baths, and the apostle again departed unhurt.
At last they attempted to compel him to offer sacrifice to the image of the sun.
The statue was of gold, standing in a golden car drawn by four horses, and appeared to bold the reins loosely, while the car was whirled rapidly through the sky.
In the temple heathen priests led the dance with barbaric rites, and, virgins sung hymns to the melody of their lyres, with flutes and timbrels, and fillets and censers.
The king and his courtiers having brought the apostle to the temple and exhorted him to sacrifice to this image of the sun, address­ ing the demon in the Hebrew tongue, he commanded him to come forth and obey his orders.
The demon, having made his appearance, stood before the apostle, so that he was visible to him only;
and the apostle talked with the devil in the Hebrew tongue, while no one knew what he said, or with whom he was conversing.
When, at length, St. Thomas had worshipped the Lord in the idol-temple on his bended knees, and in presence of the king had enjoined the demon, in Christ's name, to do injury to no one, but immediately to destroy the molten image, the idol instantly dissolved and melted like wax at the fire.
Then all the priests raised shrieks, and the pontiff pierced the apostle through the body with a sword.
The king and Carisius took to flight, and there was a great tumult among the people, as the greater part shouted for the apostle, and sought for his murderer that they might burn him alive.
The apostle's body was honourably borne with hymns of praise to the church, and being embalmed with precious aromatics, great signs and miracles were wrought there, for demoniacs were freed, and all diseases were healed.
A long time afterwards the Syrians obtained a promise from Alexander, emperor of Rome, on his return from the Parthian war after defeating Xerxes, that he would send to the petty kings of India to demand that the remains of St. Thomas should be restored to them.
1
The body of the apostle was therefore transported from India, and deposited in the city of Edessa in a silver coffer, suspended by chains of the same metal.
There no idolaters, no heretics, no Jews can live.
Abgarus2 was chief, or king of Edessa, when he had the honour to receive the letter written by our Saviours hand, which is read by a newly baptized child, standing over the gate of the city, when any barbarous tribe advances to attack the place.
The very same day the letter is read, the invaders either make peace, or retreat, in terror both of our Lord's letter, and of the prayers of St. Thomas the apostle, surnamed Didymus, who having touched the Lord's side cried out, " Lord, thou art my God.
"George Florence Gregory, the venerable archbishop of Tours, writes that he had heard some particulars respecting St. Thomas from one Theodore who bad lately travelled in India, and on his return related what follows, as well as other circumstances."
In India, at the place where the body of the blessed apostle St. Thomas was first deposited, there is a monastery and church of vast size, and built and ornamented with great care.
In this church the Lord works a great miracle.
A lamp burning before the tomb of the apostle gives, day and night perpetually, a splendid light, by God's special provision, though it is neither fed with oil nor supplied with wicks.
It is neither extinguished by the wind, nor is it injured by any accident, nor does the flame diminish, re­ ceiving its increase by virtue of the apostle in a manner unknown to man, who can only attribute it to divine power.
At the city of Edessa where, as we have already said, the blessed remains of the apostle are deposited, at the feast of the anniversary of his translation, a great concourse or people assembled from foreign countries both in performance of vows and for the purposes of commerce, and during a fair held for thirty days there is free liberty to buy and sell without payment of any tolls.
In these days, which happen in the fifth month, great and unusual favours are conferred on the people.
No quarrels take place in the throng, and neither flies infest tainted meat, nor is there scarcity of water for the thirsty crowd ;
for although during the rest of the year water is drawn from the wells at a depth of a hundred feet;
during the fair, if you only pierce the surface, springs burst forth abundantly.
There can be no doubt that these wonders must be, attributed to the apostle's power.
When the days of the feast are expired, tolls are again levied, the flies return, the springs dry up ;
but rain sent by God's providence so washes the whole court of the church from the filth and rubbish accumulated during the fair, that that you would suppose the pavement had not been even trod upon.
Almighty God, our just and compasionate judge and patient rewarder, glorifies his saints, crowning them with ineffable honour, chastises mankind by his terrors, and in punishing, saves them by penitence.
Let us supplicate him while we groan in this valley of tears, let us give him thanks for his unspeakable benefits, and let us hasten to him by keeping his commandments.
Let us also pray to St. Thomas the apostle, surnamed Didymus, and confiding in his intercession, say in our chaunts:
" 0 Thomas, who didst touch the side of our Lord, we beseech thee by those sacred wounds which have taken away all the sins of the world, cleanse us from our guilt by thy prayers.
We feel the cruel wounds of our sins;
we groan in our trouble, and pray with tears :
in pity offer for us thy powerful intercession to God the thunderer.
Amen. "BARTHOLOMEW is a Syriac word, signifying the son of him who suspends the watery
It fell to this apostle's lot to preach in Lycaonia;
afterwards he carried the gospel into Assyria and the third India.
At length, when dwelling at Albano, of the greater Armenia, he was flayed alive by the barbarians, and beheaded by order of King Astyages, being interred on the 9th of the calends of September [24th August.]
His sacred body was at first translated to the island of Lipari, and thence to Beneventum in the year of our Lord 809, where it is held by the faithful in pious veneration.
Our careful researches will now be directed to the examination of the whole history of his passion, and the following brief account is inserted from ancient manu­ scripts.
According to historians, India is divided into three regions, which are reported to have contained five thousand towns, and nine thousand peopled
The first India extends as far as Ethiopia;
the second to the Medes;
the third to the extremity, where it is bounded on one side by the region of darkness, on the other by the ocean.
It was to this part of India Bartholomew came, and entering a temple in which stood the idol Astaroth,3 he made it his resting place ac­ cording to the custom of pilgrims.
On the apostle's arrival Astaroth became dumb, giving no answers to those who consulted the idol, nor being able to succour those who were injured.
The temple now became full of diseased people, Astaroth making no reply to those who daily offered sacri­ fice ;
the infirm therefore, who where attracted there from, distant parts, miserably bewailed their sufferings, and the idol-worshippers, neither profiting by their sacrifices, nor by cutting themselves according to their custom, went to another city where a demon named Berith 1 was worshipped, and offering him sacrifice, inquired respecting the silence of their own god, and other recent occurrences.
The reply was this;
"
Your god is held captive, bound in chains of flame, that he cannot utter a word, nor scarcely breathe, since Bartholomew the apostle of God arrived in this country."
They then asked him who this Bartholomew was ;
to which the demon answered:
" He is the friend of the supreme God, and is come into this country for the purpose of expelling the gods worshipped by the Indians."
The votaries of Astaroth said:
" Tell us by what tokens we may distinguish him among the millions we see."
The idol replied :
"His hair is black and curling, his skin fair, his eyes full, his nose regular and straight, his ears covered by his long hair, his beard is long and but slightly grey, and his stature is of the middle height, neither long nor short.
He wears a white tunic, without sleeves, fastened with purple clasps, over which is a white mantle having ruby coloured gems in the corners.
For twenty-six years he has worn the same clothes, which are neither soiled nor have they grown old.
So also the sandals worn on his feet during the same period exhibit no signs of decay.
A hundred times in the day he bends his knees before God, a hundred times in the night he rises to pray.
His voice is clear as the sound of a trumpet.
The angels of God are his companions, and per- mit him neither to suffer fatigue nor hunger.
His aspect is always the same, the same spirit animates him, he is always serene and happy.
He foresees all things, knows all things, and speaks and understands the languages of all the nations of the earth.
Even now he is aquainted with your inquiries, and my replies respecting him.
The angels of God obey him, and are his precursors."
Having said thus much and more, the demon was silent.
On their return, these people searched all the places fre­ quented by strangers, narrowly observing their persons and dress;
but for two days they were unable to discover the apostle.
At length a demoniac named Seusticus cried out:
" Apostle Bartholomew, thy prayers send fire through me."
Upon which the apostle said:
" Hold thy peace, and come out of him."
And the man, who for many years had been tormented by an evil spirit, was freed from his power.
Polemius,i the king of that country, having heard of these occurrences sent to Bartholomew, entreating him to heal his daughter who was a lunatic, and bit with her teeth, or tore or beat, all who came within her reach.
The apostle imme­ diately arose, and accompanying the king's messenger, commanded the girl to be released from the fetters with which she was bound:
and when the attendants were afraid to come near her, the apostle said:
" I hold in chains the enemy who had taken possession of her;
go then and loose her, let her wash and eat, and bring her to me to-morrow early;
" they did, therefore, as the apostle commanded, and the demon was no longer able to torment her.
Then the king loaded two camels with gold and silver, and precious stones and garments, and sent them to the apostle, but as he was not to be found, they were brought back to the palace.
At the first dawn of day on the morrow, when the king was yet in his chamber, and the door securely closed, the apostle appeared to him, all alone, and instructed him in the true belief, and the doctrines of salvation.
He treated, in order, of the incarnation of the Son of God by the immacu­ late virgin, and of the thrice-repeated temptation, and the threefold victory.
The king Polemius, yielding to the apostolical teaching, particularly ordered the idol priests to sacrifice on the morrow.
When therefore they were sacrificing at day break, the demon broke silence, complaining of the torments to which he was subjected by the angels.
At the apostle's command he also openly confessed the frauds by which he had injured the people.
Then the apostle said to the multi­ tude ;
"
See what a god is this, that you thought could heal you.
Hear now the true God, your Creator, who dwells in the heavens;
and if you desire that I should pray for you, and that all the sick now present be restored to health, overturn this idol, and break it to pieces.
When this is done, I will consecrate the temple in Christ's name, and will here sanctify all by his baptism."
Upon this the king commanded ropes and pulleys to be brought, but with all their efforts, the crowd was unable to throw down the image.
Then the apostle said to them "
Loose the fasten­ ings."
And when all were loosened, he commanded the demon to go forth and demolish the image ;
and he immedi­ ately obeyed, and broke in pieces the idols of every descrip­ tion.
All therefore who were eye-witnesses shouted with one voice:
" There is but one God who is almighty, and him his apostle Bartholomew preaches."
Then the blessed apostle spread out his hands to the Lord, and prayed long for the salvation of all present.
And when the multitude answered "Amen," an angel of the Lord, having wings and shining like the sun, appeared, and taking his flight round the four sides of the temple, engraved with his finger the sign of the cross on the corner stones.
The apostle commanded the people also to make with their fingers the sign of the cross on their foreheads.
He then showed them a gigantic Egyptian, blacker than soot, his features keen, his beard long, and his hair hanging down to his feet, his eyes flashing fire, and emitting sparks like red hot iron.-
Sulphureous flames issued from his mouth and his nostrils, he had bristly feathers, and wings like the sphinx, 1 his hands were bound behind him, and he was secured by chains of fire.
This malignant devil, having been seen by all the people, was set free by the angel, and receiving a command that he should depart into desert places, where none of human kind dwelt and there await the day of judgment, uttering a fearful shriek with his terrible voice, he flew away and was seen no more.
At the same time the angel of the Lord ascended to heaven in the sight of all.
Hereupon King Polemius, with his wife, his two sons, and his whole army, and all the people who were healed, and the inhabitants of his own city and of the neighbouring towns belonging to his kingdom, believing, was baptized;
and laying aside his diadem and his purple, devoted himself to the apostle.
Meanwhile, the priests and idolaters assembled from all the temples, and thus complained to king Astyages, the elder brother of their prince:
" Your brother has become the disciple of a magician who takes possession of our temples, and breaks in pieces the images of our gods."
While they were making these sorrowful complaints, the priests of other cities came with lamentations to repeat the same tale.
Astyages, incensed, sent a thousand armed men in company with the priests to take the apostle wherever they could find him, and bring him in chains before him.
Being brought to the king, and questioned by him concerning the true God, he replied with firmness.
Meanwhile, it was told the king that his god Waldack had fallen down, and was reduced to atoms.
Then he rent his purple robe, and commanded the blessed apostle to be scourged with rods, and afterwards beheaded.
And an innumerable multitude of people from twelve cities, who were believers, came with pomp and hymns, and transported his body to a spot where a noble church was dedicated to the apostle, and there they deposited his sacred remains.
On the thirtieth day after the deposit, the king Astyages and all the priests were taken possession of by the devil, and coming to the church acknowledged the apostle, and by the just judgment of God fell dead.
And great fear fell upon the unbelievers;
and those who witnessed the manifest vengeance of God were converted to the faith, and baptized by the priests whom the apostle Bartholomew had ordained.
The king Polemius had, in consequence of a revelation, been ordained bishop by the apostle, with the acclamations of the clergy and people.
He worked miracles, and lived twenty years in his episcopate, when, having well ordered and established the infant church, he departed to the Lord.
Many years passed away;
and again a persecution was raised against the Christians.
And when the heathen saw the concourse of people which flocked to the tomb of the blessed Bartholomew, offering him incessantly the incense of their prayers, they were roused by envy to carry off his body, and enclosing it in a leaden chest, they cast it into the sea.
But by God's providence, the leaden coffin, float­ ing on the waves, was carried to the island of Lipari, where it was revealed to the Christians that they should receive it with honour.
It was therefore interred with suitable attendance, and a magnificent church built over the tomb, with a choir of monks to perform divine worship.
1MATTHEW, or Levi, as he relates in his own gospel, was a tax-gatherer, but being called from among the publicans be was added by our Lord to the number of his apostles, and endowed with much grace.
He first preached the gospel in Judea;
afterwards in Macedonia.
At length he suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia while he was celebrating mass, under Hyrtacus Adelphus, after he had converted and baptized in the faith, of Christ the king Eglippus with many thousands of his people.
He thus happily departed in the Lord on the eleventh of the calends of October [21st of September].
The following account of the preaching and passion of the blessed evangelist is copied from ancient histories.
The apostle Matthew, after writing his gospel in Judea in the Hebrew tongue, by the divine command went among the Ethiopians, where he worked many miracles, and brought multitudes to salvation.
Having come to the great city Nadaber, be detected the artifices of the magicians Zaroes and Arphaxath, who said that they were gods, and thus imposed upon the king Eglippus and his people.
They rendered men motionless as long as they pleased:
they had the art to blind them, and cause them to become deaf;
serpents inflicted wounds at their command, which they healed by their incantations.
Their fame spread through all Ethiopia, so that crowds flocked to these magicians from the furthest parts of the country, and the dupes worshipped their deceivers.
Indeed, as the proverb says, fear causes more reverence to the workers of evil than love to the kindly disposed.
The merciful Lord, therefore, in his providential care for mankind, sent Matthew the apostle to the relief of the Ethiopians thus doubly black, both naturally and morally.
The Ethiopian Eunuch Candace,1who had been baptized by Philip the apostolic deacon, upon seeing Matthew, threw himself at his feet rejoicing, and brought him with great reverence into his house.
The friends of Candace resorted to him, and hearing the word of life, believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, many being baptized, when they perceived that the apostle nullified all the mischief which the magicians caused to men.
In fact, these impostors wounded all whom they got in their power that they might have the credit of healing them ;
and those passed for being cured whose wounds no longer appeared.
But Matthew, the apostle of Christ, not only healed those who had been hurt by the magicians, but all others who were brought to him, under whatever diseases they were labouring.
He also taught divine truth to the people, so that all were astonished at his eloquence, he being able to discourse with ease in the Greek, Egyptian, and Ethiopic tongues.
Candace, having asked him questions in confidence, and in a kindly way, the apostle clearly explained to him that the confusion of tongues occurred at Babel from man's presumption;
and again how the Diety incarnate redeemed mankind, and over­ threw the old enemy by Christ's humiliation;
and how the Holy Spirit kindled the flame of inspiration in his elect servants, imparting to them the gift of tongues, and making them fully to understand the hidden wisdom of the holy scriptures.
While the blessed apostle was engaged in freely opening to his hearers many life-giving truths from the treasures of wisdom, some one came and reported that the magicians, with their serpents, were near at hand.
These serpents were crested, their breath was as a flame of fire, and their nostrils gave forth a sulphureous odour, sufficient to destroy those who inhaled it.
Then St. Matthew crossed himself, and in spite of .
the remonstrances of Candace the eunuch, went forth to meet them;
and as soon as he stood before the magicians, both the serpents lay down sleeping at his feet.
Upon this the apostle said to the magicians, " Where is your art ?
Rouse the serpents from their sleep, if you are able."
They accordingly endeavoured by their magical charms to rouse up the serpents, but entirely failed.
A crowd had now assembled, and were astonished at what they saw.
At length the blessed apostle commanded the fierce snakes, in the name of the Lord, to retire peaceably to their own place, departing without doing harm to any one.
The serpents forthwith, raising their heads, began to depart, and passing through the open gates of the city, were never more seen.
The holy evangelist then addressed the people, who were full of joy, in an affectionate discourse, recounting to them in order the original state of man, the delights of paradise, the envy and craft of the apostate angel, the fall of Adam the first man, in consequence of his prevarication, and his recovery by the passion of the Son of God.
While the apostle was thus largely discoursing on these abundant themes, his audience were suddenly startled by a tumult of grief in which lamentations were made for the death of Euphranon, the son of the king Eglippus.
The magicians conducted his obsequies, and not being able to restore him to life, assured the king that his son was caught up by the gods into their assembly above, persuading him that he should be numbered among the divinities, and a temple erected to his honour.
But the queen Euphenisia received a wiser counsel from the faithful Candace, and holding the magicians in utter contempt, sent nobles of rank to bring Matthew to the king.
Upon his entering the palace, she threw herself at his feet, and fervently and devoutly on­ treated him to restore her son to life.
The blessed apostle commended her sincere faith, and prayed to Almighty God to give life to the dead.
Then taking the young man's hand, he commanded him to arise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and immediately the young man rose up.
At the sight of such a miracle the king was struck with fear, and causing a crown and purple robe to be offered him, sent heralds through all the towns and provinces of Ethiopia, proclaiming:
“Come to the city, and see the Lord manifested in the guise of man.
”Great multitudes, therefore, assembled with tapers and lamps, with incense and offerings of various kinds for sacrifice :
but St. Mat­ thew thus addressed them:
“I am no god, but the servant of Almighty God, who has sent me to free you from your errors, and bring you to the knowledge of the true God, that you may worship him.
Take away this splendid crown, and the silver and gold;
go and erect a temple to the Lord, in which you may assemble and hear the word of God together.
"On hearing this, the crowd departed rejoicing, and sixty thousand men set about building a temple to God, so that the church was completed within thirty days.
Matthew called it the Church of the Resurrection, in memory of the restoration of the king's son.
It became his apostolic seat for twenty-three years, and he attached to it priests and deacons, ordained bishops in' the cities and towns, and founded many churches.
The king and queen, and the different tribes of Ethiopia received the baptism of Christ, and the magicians in terror made their escape into Persia.
Innumerable miracles were worked by St. Matthew, which it is impossible to recount in detail.
The blind received sight, paralytics were cured, demoniacs liberated, and even the dead were raised to life.
The most Christian king Eglippus departed to the Lord in extreme old age, and Hyrtacus Adelphus succeeded to the government.
He desired to marry Iphigenia.
the daughter of the late king, a consecrated virgin who had received the veil from the apostle's hands, and now presided over a company of more than two hundred virgins.
Hyrta­ cus, hoping for success in his suit through the apostle's influence, negociated with him for that purpose:
"Take," said he, " the half of my kingdom, so that I may be united in marriage with Iphigenia.
”Then the blessed Matthew commanded the king, and Iphigenia, and all the people, to assemble in the church on Sunday to hear the word of Almighty God ;
which was done accordingly.
While strict silence was observed in the congregation, the apostle dis­ coursed concerning celibacy, and a fitting matrimony with its proper results, expatiating on these subjects with wisdom and eloquence.
He showed clearly that indulgence in food and the conjugal connexion were not sinful, though they may involve some degree of pollution.
"
Bodily unclean­ ness,’ ’he said, " might be purged by alms and good deeds, while sins could not be washed away but by the tears of penitence.
If any one, after eating carnal food, presumes on the same day to partake of the spiritual food of'the body of Christ, he is guilty of a double crime, indecency and presumption;
not because he satisfied his appetite, but because he aspired to the privileges of the eucharist against order, and justice, and the laws of God.
Thus, homicide and falsehood, though in themselves sins, may yet appear justified by their motives.
For instance, if any one tells an untruth to protect an innocent person, and thus shields him against his enemy;
or, if a judge condemns to death one malefactor, to save the lives of many innocent persons;
in such cases the results are good and profitable.
This plainly appears in the homicides of Goliath and Sisera, of Haman and Holophernes.
Thus also when marriages are contracted, they are founded on a right principle, if they are engaged in with justice and sanctity.
But if a king's servant should presume to lift his eyes to his master's betrothed bride, he would clearly commit not only an offence, but so grievous a crime, that he would deserve to be cast alive into the flames.
His crime would be, not that he married a wife, but that he committed injustice against his superior."
By this discourse and others of the like nature, the apostle -St. Matthew dis­ suaded King Hyrtacus from marrying the consecrated virgin Iphigenia, showing that he would incur the divine wrath if he presumptuously contracted matrimony with her.
This only roused the king's wrath, and he departed in anger, while the apostle, full of determination and cheerfulness, continued his exhortations and prayers.
Then he bestowed his blessing, before all the people, on Iphigenia, who had thrown herself at his feet, and gave the veil to all the vir­ gins who were present.
The whole congregation having now received the sacred mysteries, the mass being celebrated, returned to their homes, but the apostle remained near the altar where he had just consecrated the Lord's body, and was praying with uplifted hands when he received his death-blow.
For then a soldier sent by Hyrtacus stabbed the apostle in the back and thus made him a martyr to Christ.
On this being reported, the populace rushed to the palace with torches, and it was not without difficulty that the priests and deacons and other religious persons, by their pious remonstrances, prevented them from burning the king with all his court;
Meanwhile, Iphigenia gave to the priests and clergy all the gold, and silver, and jewels she possessed, to enable them to build a church worthy to be dedicated in honour of the apostle, and the rest she ordered to be distributed among the poor.
Hyrtacus, on his part, first employed the wives of his nobles, and afterwards the magicians, to persuade her to agree to his wishes.
At last, when his suit entirely failed, he caused the building where she dwelt with the other vir­ gins, serving God day and night, to be surrounded with flames.
But when the fire was raging on all sides, an angel of the Lord appeared in company with Matthew the apostle, and comforting the sacred virgins, promised them speedy deliverance.
Accordingly, before long, the Almighty sent a powerful wind, which swept the conflagration entirely away from the abode of his servant the virgin, and wrapt in flames the king's palace, until it was entirely consumed, with all his wealth.
He made his escape, indeed, with great diffi­ culty, saving his only son;
but from that time he never enjoyed a moments happiness.
A powerful demon took possession of his son, and dragging him rapidly to the tomb of Matthew the apostle, the devil himself bound his hands behind him, and forced him to confess his father's crimes.
As for the king, he was attacked by elephantiasis, and fell by his own hand, having plunged his sword through his bowels, and thus expiated the apostle's martyrdom.
All the people insulted his remains, and taking Behor, the brother of Iphi­ genia, who had been baptized by the apostle, raised him to the throne.
He was twenty-five years old when he began his reign, which lasted sixty-two years, during which he maintained a firm peace with the Romans and Persians.
All the provinces of Ethiopia were supplied with churches, and many wonderful miracles were wrought at the place of the martyrdom of St. Matthew the apostle.
He was the first who published a gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he wrote in the Hebrew tongue, and which was discovered on his own revelation, in the reign of the emperor Zeno.1
Our holy mother the church observes the festival of his memory on the eleventh of the calends of October [September 21], and lifts voice and heart to his honour with a sweet melody:
"
Holy Matthew, powerful with thy twofold gifts, without ceasing pray to Christ our Lord for us, that we hereafter may escape the eternal gulf!
”SIMONthe Canaanite, or Zelotes,—so called to distinguish him from Simon Peter, as well as from the traitor Judas, who was called also Simon Iscariot,—was of Cana, a village of Galilee, where the Lord turned water into wine.
Egypt was the station in which he was allotted to preside.
Jude, the son of James, had three names;
for he was called Thaddeus and Lebbeus as well as Jude.
He preached in Mesopotamia and the interior of Pontus.
Both Simon and Jude having travelled into Persia in company, after converting vast multitudes of the people of that country to the faith of Christ, suffered martyrdom on the fifth of the calends of November [October 28].
Crato, the disciple of these apostles, has given a long account of their acts during thirteen years, and their sufferings in Persia, comprising them in ten volumes, which Africanus the historian translated into Latin.
Abdias also, who was ordained by those apostles bishop of Babylonia, wrote their memoirs in the Hebrew tongue, which were translated into Greek by his disciple Eutropius, from which a Latin version was also made by Africanus.
1
From these works I propose to make a short extract for the use of those who may wish to know the history of their preaching from the beginning, and by what end they left this world and departed to the realms above.
Now the holy apostles Simon and Jude, having gone into Persia by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, met there the two magicians, Zaroes and Arphaxath, who had fled from the presence of St. Matthew the apostle in Ethiopia.
2
The doc­ trine of these men was depraved, and full of deadly blasphemy against the Lord and his prophets.
The apostles having arrived in Persia, fell in with Warardach, the general and commander of the king of the Babylonians, whose name was Xerxes, and who had engaged in war against the Indians, in consequence of their having invaded his frontier.
On the apostles' arrival, the demons, who delivered false oracles to those who sacrificed to them, became dumb in all their temples, whereupon their worshippers resorted to the temple of a neighbouring city for advice.
There the demons uttered groans, and intimated to those who came to consult them that their own gods could not speak in the pre­ sence of Simon and Jude, the apostles of God.
Then Warardach, the general, caused the apostles to be searched for, and on their being found, inquired who they were, and whence they came;
to which they replied that they were Hebrews, and were come there on the errand of the salva­ tion of men.
Upon his entreating them to restore the power of speech to their gods, they poured forth a prayer, and gave permission.
But the fanatics were immediately led away by the demons, who predicted that a great battle would ensue, and vast numbers be slain on both sides.
The apostles ridiculed this prediction, while the general was .
greatly alarmed;
but at their instance he deferred till the morrow despatching ambassadors to demand peace.
The heathen priests being incensed against the apostles, and exclaiming that low persons, in tattered garments, ought not to be allowed to speak, or be listened to in a city so magnifi­ cent as Babylon, the general ordered both the apostles and these outrageous priests to be kept in custody till the morrow, and by the advice of the former, waited till then the issue of the affair.
The day following the word of the apostles was accom­ plished.
The envoys of the general returned, mounted on swift dromedaries, with the ambassadors of the Indians, and brought intelligence that all had happened as the apostles had predicted.
In short, the Indians restored the territories they bad invaded, paved tribute, and concluded a treaty of lasting peace.
The general, finding that the apostles had told the truth, as the event manifested, was enraged with the priests, and causing a great fire to be kindled, ordered them, with their accomplices, to be cast into the flames.
The apostles, mindful of our Lord's commands, threw themselves at the general's feet, scattering dust on their heads, and implored the pardon of their enemies, proclaiming loudly, to the admiration of all present, that such was the teaching of the God of the Christians.
In the end, Warardach ordered the priests to be numbered, and an account taken of all their possessions, in order that they might be made over to the apostles.
The number of the priests attached to the temples was found to be a hundred and twenty, each of whom received from the taxes a pound in gold:
but the chief priest received four times as much as the others.
Their wealth in gold, and silver, and vestments, and cattle was so immense that it could not be reckoned.
All this the general offered to the apostles, but they utterly rejected the gift, and commanded it to be dis­ tributed to the poor.
At length, however, the general, having reported these proceedings to the king, enlarging on the apostles' merits, Zaroes and Arphaxad, who were then at court, took occasion to depreciate them, endeavouring to instigate a persecution of them, unless they consented to worship their gods.
The general, on his part, defended the apostles;
and at length a disputation was appointed to take place in the king's pre­ sence.
The magicians, having here spoken freely before all the people, the advocates on the other side were dumb, and for the space of nearly an hour no one of those who before were so eloquent and loquacious could utter a word.
At length the magicians permitted them to speak, but they found themselves unable to walk, and stepping backwards, could see nothing, though their eyes were open.
The spec­ tators were much astonished at this prodigy, and reverenced the magicians, more however from fear than love.
This spectacle was exhibited from dawn of day till the sixth hour, when the advocates returned home in confusion.
The general related all this to the apostles, who were much beloved by him, and he assembled in his house the advocates who bad been thus foiled, presenting them to the apostles of God, that they might learn how, in obedience to their instructions, they could triumph over the magicians.
The advocates, seeing before them men in mean attire, were disposed to hold them in contempt;
but Simon checked their insolence by his shrewd remarks.
He reminded them distinctly that articles of little worth were often inclosed in coffers of gold, enriched with diamonds;
while precious jewels were deposited in common boxes of wood;
and that splendid vases were filled with vinegar, while rich wines were stored in vessels presenting externally a foul aspect.
Thus a mean exterior not unfrequently conceals the eminent virtues of persons, who by their merits are especially pleasing to the supreme Creator.
Then the holy apostles gave salutary counsel to the advo­ cates, and commended him to God by prayers, signing them on their foreheads with the sign of the cross.
Upon this, Zebedee and the other advocates, coming before the king, began to deride the magicians, who found no means of harming them.
At length, in their rage, they brought in a number of serpents, to the great alarm of all the spectators.
The king immediately summoned the apostles, who on their arrival filled their mantles with the serpents, and hurled them boldly against the magicians.
The serpents instantly began to gnaw their flesh, till they howled like wolves, to the great joy of all who witnessed the tortures of those impious men.
The king and all the people said to the apostles, " Let them die."
But they answered:
“ We are sent to bring back from death to life, not to cast down from life to death."
Then they prayed, and commanded the ser­ pents to withdraw their venom from the magicians, and depart to their own place.
But the magicians suffered still greater tortures when the serpents again gnawed their flesh and sucked their blood to eradicate the venom.
When the serpents were departed, and the afflicted magicians, by the apostles' advice, had neither eat, nor drunk, nor slept, for three days, the apostles came to visit them, and instead of returning evil for evil, healed their wounds.
But the magi­ cians still persisted in their malice, and as they had fled from the presence of St. Matthew the apostle, in Ethiopia, so they now retreated, covered with confusion, before the two apostles, and raised against them the fury of the idola­ ters through the whole of Persia.
They went about offering sacrifices in all the temples, and by their incanta­ tions caused men to be suddenly motionless, and then free to move;
suddenly blind, and again restored to sight;
now deaf, and then able to hear.
Thus they imposed on those who sacrificed to idols, and were like themselves.
At the entreaty of the king and his general, the apostles continued in Babylonia, working great wonders in the name of the Lord, making the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the blind to see, and cleansing the lepers, and driving the demons out of the bodies they had taken possession of.
In consequence they made many disciples, out of whom they ordained priests, and deacons, and clergy, in the churches.
The daughter of a very opulent satrap, who had been seduced, was in great danger during childbirth, and the deacon Eustosinus was consequently accused of having debauched her.
The apostles, hearing of this, required the parents of the girl and the deacon to appear before them, and had the infant also brought, which was born the same day, at the first hour.
Having commanded the infant to speak, it said in a very clear voice:
"This deacon is a chaste and holy man;
he has never polluted his flesh."
The parents insisted on learning who was the father of the child, but the apostles replied:
"It is our duty to absolve the innocent, but not to make known the guilty.
"
Nicharon, the king's friend, while engaging in warlike exercises, was shot by an arrow in the knee, which could not by any means be drawn out of the bone.
Then the blessed Simon invoked the Lord Jesus, and applying his band, immediately drew out the arrow, and the man was instantly healed, so that not even a sign of the wound appeared.
Two most ferocious tigresses, having escaped from their dens, devoured all that came in their way.
Then the people fled to the apostles of God, who invoked the name of the Lord Jesus, upon which the savage animals, which never could be tamed, became gentle as lambs.
During the day they remained like sheep among the people, and returning in the evening to the apostles' cell, became its guardians when the apostles visited other cities.
From hence they took occasion mildly to instruct the people, pointing out what men gifted with reason ought to do, and how they ought to obey God, by the example of the brute animals thus exhibited to their observation.
At the entreaty of the king and the people the apostles abode at Babylon one year and three months, during which period more than sixty thousand men, besides women and children, were baptized, the king and all his courtiers being the first to receive the faith.
For they saw that by a word the sick were cured, the blind received sight, and the dead were raised.
Abdias, who had accompanied the apostles from Judea, and had himself seen the Lord Jesus with his own eyes, was ordained bishop, and the city [of Babylon] was full of churches.
All which being duly regulated, the apostles departed, followed by crowds of disciples, to the number of two hundred and upwards, and they went through the twelve provinces of Persia and the cities thereof.
It is now time that the passion of the holy apostles should be related.
The magicians Zaroes and Arphaxad, of whom mention has been already made, committed abomi­ nations throughout the country, pretending to be of the race of the gods, but always fleeing from the face of the apostles.
They only remained in any city until such time as they understood the apostles were at hand.
There were seventy priests of the idol temples in Sanir, who received from the king a pound in gold each, four times a year, when they celebrated the feast of the sun, that is to say, at the beginning of spring and summer, autumn and winter.
The before-named magicians raised all the opposition in their power against the apostles, and by preceding them had it in their power effectually to do so.
The holy apostles, having passed through all the provinces, took up their abode at Sanir in the house of Sennes their disciple.
But on a sudden, about the first hour of the morning, the priests rushed in a body to the house of Sennes, shouting terribly that the enemies of their gods should be given up.
In short, they seized the holy apostles, and dragged them to the temple of the sun.
On their entering the temple, the demons cried out through some who were possessed:
" What have we to do with you, O apostles of the living God!
since your entrance here the flames consume us."
In a chapel of the temple towards the east there was a chariot of gold drawn by four horses, in which was the statue of the sun encircled by rays also wrought in gold.
In another chapel the image of the moon was wrought in silver, having a car drawn by a yoke of oxen, all in the same metal.
While the priests and ma­ gicians, with the people, were urging the apostles to worship the idols, they were conversing together in the Hebrew tongue on a vision of the Lord, whom they beheld calling them into the midst of the host of angels.
The angel of the Lord also appeared to them, and comforted them.
Then, procuring silence, they addressed the people, pointing out to them in a reasonable manner their error of idly wasting on the creature the worship which is due to God only;
and that it was injurious to him to enclose in buildings made with hands the sun and the moon which he had created from the beginning, and set in the heavens to give light through all generations.
While all were in amazement, Simon commanded the demon to break in pieces the image of the sun and his chariot;
Jude also, in like manner, com­ manded the image of the moon to be broken.
Then two Ethiopians, with their black skins and naked bodies, and horrible features, were seen by all the people to come forth, and while crushing the images uttered hoarse and lamentable cries.
Meanwhile the infuriated priests rushed on the apostles, and slew them while they were rejoicing and giving thanks to God.
Sennes, their host, also suffered with them, because he refused to sacrifice to the idols.
At that very time, when the heavens were perfectly serene, they shot forth bright flashes of lightning, which rent the temple into three parts from the highest pinnacle of the roof to the lowest foundation.
Zaroes and Arphaxad were struck by the lightning and burnt to ashes.
Three months afterwards King Xerxes confiscated the property of the priests, and translated the bodies of the apostles with great pomp to his own city, in which he erected an octangular church, each of the angles containing eighty feet, so that its circuit embraced eight times eighty feet, the height being one hundred and twenty.
It was built entirely of hewn blocks of marble, squared and faced, and the chapels were panneled with gilt plates.
In the centre of the octagon was placed a sarcophagus of pure silver.
Four years of incessant labour were employed in the erection, and it was completed on the birth-day of the two apostles ;
that is to say, the fifth of the calends of November [28th October], and worthy to be dedicated to the honour of the saints.
1
The faithful who venerate their martyrdom, which they suffered even unto death for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, obtain heavenly gifts on that spot.
We also, who, hoping in the Lord, are engaged in writing these memorials, set forth the praises of the blessed apostles who belong to the company of those who feast triumphantly with the great King, while we devoutly sing to their honour in the courts of Jerusalem, with the children who cried Hosanna to the Redeemer:
—" Blessed Simon and illustrious Thaddeus,1 behold our grief and tears, that we, who through our fall deserve eternal punishment, may, by your intercession, obtain admission to heaven.
Amen."MATTHIAS, one of the seventy disciples, having been elected by lot among the apostles in the place of Judas, preached in Judæa, where he suffered martyrdom for Christ.
His feast is celebrated on the sixth of the calends of March [24th February], when the reverend choir in devout pro­ cession thus chants their prayer to him:
" 0 Matthias the just!
raised by lot to the throne of the twelve, free us from all the bonds of guilt that, through thy holy interces­ sion, we may come to the joys of the true light.
Amen.”2JUDAS, Simon Iscariot, was of the tribe of Issachar, and counted in the number of the twelve apostles.
But in­ flamed with a fatal covetousness, having sold his master and Lord to the Jews for thirty pieces of silver, be lost the rank of an apostle, and, after a late repentance, miserably banged himself.
Even now there are many successors of Judas in the church, men who assume a sacred title without acting worthily of it.
Unworthy as he was, Judas had worthy and mystical names by which false Christians are typified in the church.
For instance, Judas means confessing;
by which name those are signified, who, as the apostle says, " profess that they know God, but deny him by their works.”
More­ over, Simon means obedient, by which word are signified hypocrites and deceivers, and those who obey falsely, not doing the will of God from love of him and desire of heaven, but speciously following the traditions of their elders, for vainglory and the applause of men.
Many among them are blinded by their covetousness, like Judas Iscariot, and quit­ ting the pursuits and the companionship of good men, fall readily into detestable crimes and become indissolubly entangled in the snares of sin, enjoying a transitory reward in the present life, and receiving some recompense for a certain propriety and exterior decency of conduct, they are elated with vanity;
but in the future life they will wail, inextricably chained, in the loathsome dungeons of hell, and tormented for the sins they have committed with indescriba­ ble forms of punishment, without any hope of forgiveness.
The traitor Judas having withdrawn from the company of the apostles, what did those merit who remained faithful to the Lord Jesus ?
Unspeakable honour and eternal blessedness.
Holy mother church holds, and every true Catholic faithfully believes, that the twelve apostles are truly blessed and exalted and partakers of everlasting felicity.
The salt of the earth and the light of the world, the twelve hours of the eternal day, the fruitful branches of the true vine, the fellow labourers with Christ, and fellow heirs of his heavenly kingdom, their memories are every where cherished in the hearts of the faithful, and who are honoured by all nations who profess the true faith, and de­ voutly reckoned the teachers of the people and rulers of the churches, as being appointed by Christ judges of the world, strict censors of the reprobate, but kind helpers of the devout, and their constant intercessors.
For, holding all worldly things in contempt, they indissolubly attached themselves to Christ who is the true vine and life eternal.
And now they reign in heaven with the King of kings, joining with the angels in praising him for ever, and sitting on twelve thrones, judge, with the Lord, the twelve tribes of Israel.
I have searched out their acts as they are read in the church, and employed myself in abbreviating their histories, as I find them recorded in ancient books.
I PURPOSE now to treat of the companions and successors of the apostles, and by God's help will give a faithful ac­ count of some of them in my present work.
I enter upon this undertaking from no vain fancy that they need my commendation, of whom God himself is the praise, who reigns Triune through all eternity, and blesses his saints with everlasting rewards in his own presence;
but my work is intended to exhibit my devotion to these blessed saints, and to obtain their favour, in order that I may piously obtain my own salvation through their intercession.
Joseph, surnamed Barnabas, that is to say, the son of consolation, and a native of the city of Cyprus, founded by Cyrus king of Persia, was joined with Paul in his mission to the gentiles the third year after our Lord's passion.
1
He was one of the seventy-two disciples of our Lord, and taking part with the apostles both in their joys and tribulations, ministered, as his name implies, the utmost consolation to the faithful.
In the first place, he sold the land he possessed and laid the price of it at the apostles' feet.
He gave the hand of fellowship to Paul after his conversion, introducing him to the apostles by whom he was as yet unknown and suspected, and relating the account of his call to those who were igno­ rant of it.
He was sent by the apostles to Antioch, where he rejoiced at seeing the grace of God manifested in the disciples, and by his preaching a great multitude was con­ verted to the Lord.
Thence he went to Tarsus to find Saul, and having found him brought him to Antioch, where both sojourned a whole year and taught much people :
there the disciples were first called Christians.
2Barnabus and Saul, being compassionate and benevolent, brought the alms of the gentile believers to the brethren in Judea.
On their return from Jerusalem, after accomplish­ ing this mission, they joined John whose surname was Mark, and continued at Antioch among the prophets and doctors.
And as these were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Ghost said unto them:
" Separate me Saul and Barnabas for the work whereunto I have called them."
And being sent forth by the Holy Ghost they came to Seleucia, and then sailed to Cyprus.
Afterwards they struck Barjesus, the magician, who was also called Ely­ mas, with blindness for a time, converted Sergius Paulus the proconsul to the true faith, and brought great multi­ tudes to the light of truth.
1While, therefore, the elect walked in the way of faith and righteousness, the reprobates, inflamed with rage, made a tumult and drove the apostles out of their neighbourhood.
But they, rejoicing and filled with the Holy Ghost, preached the word of God, and converted to the Lord great multi­ tudes of Jews and Greeks.
2
Coming to Lystra they healed one who was lame from his mother's womb ;
on seeing which miracle the people took them for gods, saying:
" The gods are come down unto us in the likeness of men."
And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury.
And the priest of Jupiter who was near the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates and would have sacrificed with the people.
But the apostles, in horror of such an abomination, drove them away, and rending their clothes ran among the people exclaiming against it with much reasonable discourse, which with diffi­ culty persuaded the crowd from sacrificing to them.
3
After this they came to Derbe, preaching the gospel there, teaching many, and giving them instruction in virtue.
And passing through several provinces in which they made known the word of God, at length they arrived at Jerusalem, and being received by the holy apostles told what wonderful things God had wrought by their means.
At that time some evil disposed persons raised questions respecting the necessity of circumcision.
Upon this the apostles took counsel and sent Paul and Barnabas to Antioch to allay the dissensions, who, coming there armed with an apostolic epistle, succeeded by their preaching in exterminating the impious heresy.
4
Like true pastors, they published the word of God, taught the ignorant, healed the sick, and anxiously devoted them­ selves to promote religion in every way.
They therefore frequently visited the churches in which they set forth the true faith, using every precaution lest the neophytes should fall into heresy.
For they knew how crafty were the wiles of Satan, and watched against the hearts of the regenerate be­ coming foul with the deadly seed of the tares.
Afterwards, as Luke the evangelist relates, it seemed expedient that Paul should return to Jerusalem, and Barnabas to Cyprus his native city, having John, surnamed Mark, as his co­ adjutor in the ministry.
He had been a gentile, and, with his companion Orduon, was in the service of Cyril, the high priest of the execrable Jupiter, but was baptized by Paul and Barnabas at a place called Iconium, and afterwards faithfully accompanied them in their journeyings.
At length, while the apostles just named were preaching in Pamphilia, and many, both Jews and gentiles, believed in the Lord, it was revealed to Paul by the vision of an angel in the night that he should quickly go to Jerusalem, and permit Barnabas to return to Cyprus.
Having made known the vision, they prayed on bended knees, and kissing each other, bade farewell with many tears, and separated in the body, never again saw each other in this life.
1Barnabas and John now visited Laodicea and came to a city called Anemoria,2 where certain prudent and well­ disposed gentiles, having heard Christ preached, believed, and being baptized, received the grace of the Holy Ghost.
They then sailed to Cyprus, where they found Timon and Aristion, servants of the Lord.
Timon was suffering from a burning fever, but Barnabas having laid his hands on him, with the holy gospel, invoking the name of our Lord Jesus, the fever immediately left him, and his strength was so re­ stored that he followed with joy the Lord's saints.
By the instructions of the apostles, St. Barnabas always carried with him the gospel of St. Matthew the apostle, and, wherever he found sick persons, laid it upon them, and they were immediately healed of whatever disease they laboured under.
Barnabas also ordained Heraclius, who had been baptized by the apostle Paul, bishop, for the teaching of the faithful.
Afterwards when Barnabas wished to gain admis­ sion to Paphos, Barjesus, the Jewish sorcerer, whom Paul had struck blind for a time, recognized the apostle, and opposing him to the utmost of his power, forbade his entering Paphos.
The holy man, however, came.
to a certain place where he saw the heathens, both men and women, running naked in public games.
His indignation being roused he cursed the temple;
and immediately part of it fell down, from the foundation upwards, and many of the heathens were crushed and perished in the ruins, but those who escaped took refuge in the temple of Apollo.
The illustrious champion of Christ now entered the city of Salamis, and finding there a synagogue of Jews, he constantly preached the gospel to them and converted many of the Jews to the faith of Christ.
Upon finding this, Barjesus displayed all the malice of which he was capable, and raised a tumult against the holy apostles of God.
The Jews were willing to arrest Barnabas and deliver him to the consul of Salamis, having first subjected him to much suffering and various kinds of tortures.
At length, as they were dragging him to judgment, bruised and shaken with their ill-usage, they found that Eusebius, an illustrious and powerful man, and a relation of the emperor's, had landed in the island, and fearing that he would snatch their victim out of their hands, they fastened a rope round his neck and dragged him lace­ rated from the synagogue to the Hippodrome, and from thence outside the gate.
There they made a fire round him and cruelly burnt him.
Thus the blessed apostle, after many sufferings and long conflicts, was burnt for the love of Christ, and departed to everlasting joys.
The impious Jews, not content with his death, collected his remains, and enclosing them in a leaden coffer, intended to throw it into the sea;
but John Mark, with Timon and Radon, carried off the holy body by night and deposited it in the crypt which had been formerly the habitation of the Jebuseans on the third of the ides [11th] of June.
In consequence of this secret interment the venerable remains lay concealed for a number of years, the Christians not being able to discover where they were buried.
At length they were found, by the revelation of the apostle himself, in the time of the emperor Zeno and pope Gelasius, when they were gloriously en­ shrined with hymns and thanksgivings to the honour of God.
Blessings are bestowed on those who piously implore them through the merits of St. Barnabas the apostle, of which may the abundant grace of God, which works with­ out ceasing, make us partakers, who is the protector through all ages of those whom he has predetermined to life.
Amen.1MARK, the evangelist, was both the disciple and the scribe of St. Peter the apostle, whose son he was in baptism, and from whose dictation he wrote his gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
It is reported of him that he caused his thumb to be cut off that he might be disqualified for the priesthood, but was so far from being rejected by the apostles on that account that they elected him bishop of Alexandria.
When St. Peter was at Rome, he called upon him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles in Italy. “
Why,” he said, " do you remain inactive with us ?
you are fully informed of all that Jesus of Nazareth did;
arise and go to Aquileia, and there propagate among the people the doctrines of the true religion."
Mark, having his province for preaching thus allotted, and receiving the episcopal staff, took the road assigned to him and arrived at Aquileia, which is the first of the cities of Italy.
He found there a young man afflicted with leprosy, whose name was Ataulfus, son of Ulfinus, the first and most illustrious of the citizens;
and having spoken with him, took him by the hand and arm, and im­ mediately the hand and arm were cleansed of the leprosy.
Perceiving this, the youth ran to his father, and told him with joy what Mark had done to him.
Upon this, Ulfinus hastening to the apostle, with a great crowd, found him sitting at the eastern gate, and implored him with eager­ ness to heal his son.
Upon its being promised, if he be­ lieved, he declared his belief in the Lord Jesus;
whereupon Mark baptized the young man, and he was entirely freed from the leprosy.
After this cure Ulfinus also, with all his household, was baptized, and a multitude of the people besides, on the same day.
After some years, Mark, desiring to see Peter, proposed to withdraw privately and go to Rome;
but the people, discovering his design, assembled round him in great numbers at the dawn of day, and en­ treated him with shouts to appoint them a pastor.
Then Hermagoras, being elected by the people, was taken by St. Mark with him to Rome.
There he was ordained by St. Peter the apostle, first bishop of the Italian province, and after many miracles which God wrought by him among the people, be was martyred, with Fortunatus his arch-deacon, in the reign of the emperor Nero, under Sebastus the prefect, on the third of the ides [13th] of July.
1As for the blessed St. Mark, he undertook the govern­ ment of the church of Alexandria by the command of St. Peter the apostle, being the first who preached the gospel of Christ in the land of Egypt.
He also proclaimed the true religion in Marmorica and Ammonian Libya, or the Pentapolis;
the inhabitants of this country being uncir­ cumcised idolaters, in the practice of all uncleanness.
When therefore Mark arrived at Cyrene in the Pentapolis, and found the natives immersed in execrable wickedness, begin­ ning with a discourse on divine things, he healed the sick in the name of the Lord, cleansing lepers, and expelling many evil spirits by his word alone.
Numbers who wit­ nessed these miracles believed, and destroying their idols, and cutting down their sacred groves, were baptized in the name of the Triune God.
After this, it was commanded him by a revelation of the Holy Spirit that he should go to Alexandria.
2
Mark there- fore took leave of the brethren, making known to them what had been revealed;
and they accompanied him to the ship, and having broken bread together they parted from him, saying:
" Jesus Christ prosper you in your journey."
He reached Alexandria on the seventh day, and disembarking from the ship hastened to the city, when, as he was en­ tering it, his sandal burst.
"Truly," he said, “my journey is now at an end.
"The holy man gave his sandal to a certain cobbler named Aniarius, to be mended;
who, while at work upon it, sharply punctured his hand, exclaiming at the same time:
" There is but one God."
The blessed Mark hearing this said, inwardly rejoicing:
“ The Lord has prospered my journey;
" and spitting on his right hand he anointed the man's hand, saying, " May this hand be healed in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of the living God," and it was instantly healed.
The cobbler, struck by the presence of such a man and the efficacy of his words, as well as by the modesty of his appearance, requested him to honour his house by eating bread with him.
Mark entering with joy, pronounced a blessing, with prayer, and made known the tidings of the gospel to all who heard him, declaring that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
He subsequently added to his instructions signs and wonders in the name of the Lord, and Aniarius, being baptized with his whole household and many of his neighbours, became the assistant of his teacher in preaching the truth.
Meanwhile the idolaters of Alexandria, perceiving that the Galilæan preacher was destroying their worship and ceremonies, sought to put him to death and laid many snares for him.
But the blessed Mark, who knew their designs, ordained Aniarius bishop, and three priests, Me­ lirius, Paberius, and Cerdon, with seven deacons, and eleven others with functions in the service of the church.
After that he went into the Pentapolis, and dwelt there two years, comforting the brethren who were already believers, and ordaining bishops and clergy in those parts.
Returning to Alexandria he found the brethren increased in faith and grace.
Seeing also a church built by them at a place called the Bucolic that is, the cattle market, which is under the cliffs by the sea-shore, be was greatly delighted, and kneel­ ing down glorified God, and kindly lent his aid to the good work by his exhortations and prayers.
In the fulness of time, when the Christians were multi­ plied, and the images of the idols overthrown, the heathen learned the return of the holy apostle, and were filled with rage at the miracles which they found him perform.
For he healed the sick, preached to the unbelievers, and made the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.
But though they determined to arrest him, they were not able to find him;
so that they gnashed their teeth in their idolatrous cere­ monies, and exclaimed in their orgies:
" Great is the power of this magician.”
At length on Easter Sunday, that is the eighth of the calends of May [24th April], at the time when the feast of Serapis was celebrated, their spies dis­ covered the apostle consecrating the most holy offering to the Divine Majesty.
These impious men immediately seized the servant of God, and putting a rope round his neck, dragged him cruelly over the stones, so that they were sprinkled with his blood, and the soil stained with his torn flesh.
But while they were shouting with fury:
" Let us drag this buffalo to the bull-ring," St. Mark offered praises to God, saying:
" 0 Lord Jesus Christ, I give thee thanks that thou hast thought me worthy thus to suffer for thy name.
”Night approaching, the idolaters threw him into prison, while they consulted by what death he should be de­ spatched.
But at midnight, when the doors were close shut and the keepers were slumbering before the gates, behold there was a great earthquake, and an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and touching him, said:
" Mark, the servant of God, the first and chief publisher of his holy laws throughout Egypt, lo, thy name is written in the book of life, and thy memorial shall be preserved through all ages.
Thou art admitted into the fellowship of the hosts above;
in the heavens they shall receive thy spirit, and thy rest shall know no end."
On hearing this the blessed Mark, stretching out his hands to heaven said:
" I give thee thanks, 0 Lord Jesus Christ, that thou hast not de­ serted me, but hast remembered me among thy saints.
Receive, I beseech thee, 0 Lord Jesus Christ, my soul in peace, and suffer me not to be longer separated from thee."
When he had said this, the Lord Jesus came to him in the form, and clothed, as he bad dwelt with his disciples before his passion, saying to him :
" Peace be with thee, Mark, my evangelist."
Mark replied:
Thanks be unto thee, O Lord."
And in the morning the whole populace of the city assembled, and again putting the rope round his neck dragged him away, saying:
" Take this buffalo to the bull- ring."
And as he went along, he gave thanks to God, say­ ing :
" Into thy hands, 0 Lord, I commend my spirit;
" and so saying, be gave up the ghost.
An immense crowd of the heathen now lighted a fire in the place which is called, “ Of the Angels;
” resolving to burn the sacred remains.
But, by God's providence, a violent tempest arose, with a strong wind, and the sun's face was hidden, and there was loud thunder.
Heavy rain also fell from morning to night, so that many houses were washed away and numbers perished.
The guards, in terror, abandoned the body of the saint and fled;
and some said, mocking, that Serapis raised the storm on his feast-day in hatred of his enemy.
Devout men then came and took the body and buried it with honour in a tomb of hewn stone on the seventh of the calends of May [25th April].
Thus St. Mark the evangelist, the first bishop of Alexandria, suffered martyrdom for Christ, and his body was buried on the eastern side of the city.
After a long course of years, when Alexandria was threatened with the incursions of the infidels, who overran all the east like locusts, and subdued the greatest part of the world both to the north and the south, the faithful Christians translated the apostle's remains to Aquileia where St. Mark first propa­ gated the faith of Christ.
1
The bishop of Aquileia therefore has now succeeded to the patriarchate formerly held by the bishop of Alexandria, and holds the fourth primacy in the world from reverence for St. Mark, to whom Peter, who bears the keys of heaven, committed Egypt, appointing him chief pastor in the southern regions for the salvation of many souls.
The Venetians1 and people of the west now glory in possessing the remains of the blessed evangelist, and continually pay them reverence to the praise of Almighty God, beseeching him that they may be reckoned in the number of the blessed for ever and ever.
Amen.
ST. LUKE the evangelist, a native of Syria, who practised the art of medicine at Antioch with great skill, became a disciple of the apostles of Christ, and following St. Paul even to his martyrdom, remained constant in unblemished celibacy, serving the Lord.
By divine inspiration, he wrote his gospel in the parts of Achaia, setting forth to the believing Greeks our Lord's incarnation in a faithful narrative, and showing how be was descended from the stock of David.
He afterwards published a special book for the purpose of clearly recording the acts of the Apostles, and the first beginning of the infant church.
These two books Luke dedicated to Theophilus, that, is one who loves God, and published them for all who, under the inspiration of the holy Ghost, are inflamed by a double charity.
In his first book he has described the true priesthood of Christ, in which the Lamb of God has expiated the sin of the world by shed­ ding his own precious blood.
In the second, he has unfolded the majesty of the ineffable Deity, to which the Son of God has ascended at the right hand of the Father in human flesh, and related the descent of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, on the apostles in tongues of fire, through which the primitive church shone with so glorious a light.
In these two books of Luke the spiritual physician, is found the true medicine by which the deadly diseases of sin are expelled, and the remedy of justification unto life is provided for all who religiously seek it.
The blessed Luke proclaimed the Lord by his writings as well as his discourses, and exhibited the light of I truth to those who were in darkness.
Among other mira­ cles, he is said to have restored life to a dead man, in the name of the Lord.
At length, he died in Bithynia at the age of eighty-three years, full of the Holy Ghost, on the fifteenth of the calends of November [18th October].
His bones, with those of St. Andrew the apostle, and Timothy, St. Paul's disciple, were translated to Constantinople on the seventh of the ides [9th] of May, in the twentieth year of the reign of the emperor Constantine.

I HAVE now gladly enumerated all the apostles and evangelists who were contemporary with and companions of .
our Saviour, the same our Lord lending me his help;
and have briefly and faithfully collected their sacred histories, as well as I could, digesting them from various works into one continued narrative.
It yet remains that I should give some account of the blessed Martial of Limoges, whose extraordinary virtues have raised him to the highest rank of saints after the apostles.
Aurelian, whom he restored from death in the name of the Lord, has written the details of his life with order, truth, and diligence.
From this narrative I propose to make some extracts, invoking the Holy Spirit to vouchsafe his aid to my undertaking.
While our Lord Jesus Christ was preaching in Judea, and great crowds of the Jews flocked around him, furnishing him with things necessary for his human wants, and learning the way of salvation by attentively listening to his instructions, one of the noblest of the Jews of the tribe of Benjamin, whose name was Marcellus, came to him, bringing with him his wife Elizabeth, and his only son Martial, who was then fifteen years of age.
Beholding his marvellous works, and the saving doctrines he preached, they believed in Christ with contrite hearts, and at his command were baptized by the blessed apostle St. Peter.
When all the others returned to their own homes, Martial devoted himself entirely to the Lord Jesus, and became one of his constant disciples.
In so doing, he closely attached himself to the apostle Peter. to whom he was nearly related.
He was a spectator of the raising of Lazarus after being four days in the grave, as well as of many other miracles.
He ministered with Cleophas at the last supper, and other mystical rites, and was present with other disciples, at sundry appearances of our Lord after his resurrection, and at his glorious ascension.
He partook of the blessings connected with the descent of the Holy Spirit, and was abundantly endowed with his superna­ tural gifts, so that be was well prepared by grace and faitli for prosecuting vigorously the work of evangelizing.
When the apostles were dispersed, Martial went to Antioch with his kinsman St. Peter the apostle, and thence, seven years afterwards, to Rome.
There Peter and his companions were hospitably entertained by Marcellus, the consul, living for some time in his palace, and preaching publicly to the Romans the saving precepts of eternal life.
At that time the Lord Jesus appeared to St. Peter, and commanded him to send Martial to preach in the provinces of Gaul.
The apostle then called Martial to him, and duly informed him of the divine command;
upon hearing which he wept bitterly, from fear of such distant countries and barbarous tribes.
But the blessed Peter gently consoled him, and, reminding him of the divine monitions, sent him on his errand of preaching the gospel.
Without delay, therefore, Martial, with two priests, Alpinian and Austriclinian, set for­ ward on the journey enjoined him.
Austriclinian, however, dying on the road, Martial returned sorrowful to Rome, and informed Peter of the death of his companion.
But at the apostle's command, he returned to his deceased brother, and, touching his body with the apostle's staff, he was immediately restored to life, by the merits and intercessions of the saints.
Martial then, prosecuting his journey with his disciples, arrived at the castle of Tulle, where he was hospitably entertained by a wealthy man named Arnulf, with whom be remained two months, diligently employed in publishing the word of God.
Crowds of people flocked to him daily, hearing thankfully from his lips the words of salvation, and witnessing miracles before unknown.
During this time the daughter of Arnulf, who was daily vexed by a devil, was delivered from the unclean spirit at the command of Martial, and became as one dead;
but the man of God took her by the hand, and, raising her up, restored her to her father, perfectly healed.
He was holy, benevolent, humble, and constant in prayer.
The governor of the castle of Tulle whose name was Nerva, and who was related to the emperor Nero, had a son who was strangled by the devil.
Upon this, the father and mother of the deceased, with all the crowd who were present, threw themselves at the feet of Martial and placed the youth's corpse before him with loud cries and lamentations, exclaiming in their grief:
“Man of God, help us."
The holy pontiff had compassion on the sorrow of these people;
indeed he himself and his disciples wept with them, and they joined in prayer to Almighty God for the restoration of life to the dead.
The prayer being ended, and the holy prelate having commanded the dead man to arise whole in the name of the crucified Saviour, he forthwith arose, and, throwing himself at the feet of the holy man, began to cry out:
“ Baptize me, thou man of God, and sign me with the sign of the faith;
" adding:
"Two angels came to TIle with great swiftness, saying that I should be restored to life by the prayers of the blessed Martial.
Hell has no bounds;
there is nothing but weeping and bitterness, darkness, wailings and groanings, and deep sorrow;
the heat and cold are intense and terrible, and never fail;
there are the gnawings of serpents, and insupportable smells, corruption and misery, and the worm that never dies;
there are infernal gaolers who torment the souls they seize with various sufferings."
When he had made this and similar declarations, all the people began to confess the Lord, and three thousand six hundred souls of both sexes were baptized on the spot.
Many gifts were offered to the blessed man, all which he commanded to be given to the poor.
After this he went to the idol images, and broke and reduced to atoms all their sculptured statues.
The blessed prelate with his disciples came next to the village of Ahun,1 and preached the true faith to the idolaters, who were deceived by the snares of the devil.
Upon this the heathen priests assembled, and severely beat the holy preachers.
But they, blessing the Lord and patiently bearing their ill-treatment for his sake, and faith­ fully supplicating his aid in this imminent peril, their persecutors were suddenly struck blind, and, holding each other by the hand, groped their way to the statue of Mercury.
On their consulting the oracle as usual, it made no reply, the demon being bound by the angels of God.
Having recourse to another idol they learned that their god could give them no answer, because he was chained by the angels of God in fetters of flame.
The priests who had been struck blind, came therefore to St. Martial, and throwing themselves at his feet implored his pardon;
and the holy bishop restored their sight, and, presenting himself with all the people before the image of Jupiter, he adjured the demon in the Lord's name to come out, and break in pieces the statue in presence of the multi­ tude;
which command was immediately obeyed and the statue reduced to atoms.
Two thousand six hundred souls were baptized there.
A man who was paralytic, hearing of this miracle, caused himself to be carried to the man of God.
He was of high family, and rich in gold and silver, and great possessions.
When now the man of God heard his entreaties and perceived his faith, he took him by the hand, and, praying for him, healed him.
Thus restored to health, the paralytic glorified God, and offered rewards to the man of God, which he refused to accept,, and ordered all to be distributed among the people.
While St. Martial dwelt there, the Lord appeared to him in a vision, saying:
"Fear not to go down to Limoges, for I will glorify thee in that place, and will be ever with thee."
Thereupon the blessed bishop, having encouraged those he had baptized, commended them to the Lord, and went to the city with his disciples.
They were hospitably received in the house of a noble widow named Susanna, and on the morrow began to preach the Lord in public.
There was a man afflicted with frenzy and bound in fetters in the house where the man of God was entertained, whom no one dared to unloose.
Susanna having supplicated the bishop to heal him as he had done others who were sick, he yielded to her entreaties, and, making the sign of the cross over the diseased man, his chains fell off, and he was made whole.
The noble mother, and her daughter Valeria, upon witnessing this miracle, believed, and were baptized by the holy bishop, with six hundred of their household.
The priests of the idols, being incensed that the holy men preached in the theatre, severely scourged them, and threw them into prison;
but St. Martial and his companions bore patiently the injuries they received, giving thanks to God.
St. Martial was praying about the third hour of the day following, when suddenly a light like that of the bright sun shone in the dungeon, and the fetters of those who were confined fell to pieces, and the doors were opened;
so that all who witnessed it entreated to be baptized.
The city was shaken with an earthquake, there were lightnings and thunder, the heathen seeking in vain the protection of their idols, for the priests who had scourged the holy men of God were killed by a thunderbolt.
The citizens, therefore, were struck with universal terror, and, rushing to the prison, threw.
themselves at the bishop's feet, entreating pardon and help.
The bishop and his colleagues offering their prayers, Aurelian and Andrew1 were restored to life, and, throwing themselves on their knees, sought forgiveness, confessing the true God, with all the people who saw with amazement such unheard-of prodigies.
The day following St. Martial assembled the whole population, from the least to the eldest, and, having addressed to them a suitable exhortation, baptized them all.
Thus twenty-two thousand believed in the Lord, and submitted with joy to his saving worship.
The holy bishop then hastened with all the people to the temple, in which stood the statues of Jupiter, Mercury, Diana, and Venus, and, destroying the images, converted the temple into a church dedicated to the honour of St. Stephen, the first martyr.
The blessed Susanna died happily in the Lord, and was buried by St. Martial with great honour.
She had conferred .
innumerable gifts and possessions on the holy bishop, and had granted to him the service of a number of her slaves.
Moreover, her daughter Valeria devoted her virginity to the Lord, and, full of the Holy Ghost, showed herself a model of all good works.
Hearing that Duke Stephen, to whom she was betrothed, was on his road to Limoges, and feeling sure that he would be grievously offended by her vow of chastity, she distributed to the poor all her wealth in gold, and silver, and vestments of various kinds, and precious stones.
She had already joined her mother in making over to the holy bishop all their domains, with their slaves and serfs, that after his death his holy remains might be there interred.
Duke Stephen's principality extended from the river Rhone to the ocean, and he possessed all the country on this side the Loire, with Aquitaine, inhabited by the Gascons and Goths.
1
He was not called king, because no prince assumed that title except Nero, who possessed the Roman empire.
On Stephen's reaching Limoges, he ordered Valeria, his affianced bride, to be conducted to him, and, finding from the conference that he was rejected by her, and that it was certain he would never prevail on her to become his wife, he became so enraged that he broke off the conversation, and ordered her to be immediately led out of the city and beheaded.
Arrived at the place of execution she foretold the sudden death of the executioner, and, spreading out her hands in prayer, commended herself with confidence to the Lord her God.
During her prayer a voice was heard from above, saying:
" Fear not, Valeria, thou art expected in the celestial brightness which never ends."
The virgin rejoiced at hearing these words, and, lifting up her eyes to heaven, said:
“ Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit."
Having thus spoken, she voluntarily offered her neck to the executioner, who cut off her head with a single blow.
Many persons saw her spirit depart from the body, bright as the sun, and rising to heaven in a globe of fire, with a choir of angels, singing:
Blessed art thou, Valeria, martyr of Christ, for thou hast kept the commandments of God.
Henceforth thou shalt be for ever in his sight, in the brightness of the light that knows no end.
"The squire of Duke Stephen, who had beheaded Valeria, hearing these words hastened to his master, and told him all he had seen and heard.
Mentioning last the virgin's pre­ diction of his own impending death, he was struck by an angel, and fell at the duke's feet, and presently expired.
Fear and trembling seized the duke and all the people, and the duke, covering himself with sackcloth, requested the blessed Martial to come to him.
On his arrival, the duke prostrated himself at his feet, and said, with many tears :
"
I have sinned, most holy man, in that I have shed the blood of the righteous;
but I pray thee to restore this my squire to life, and cause me to believe in your God."
Then the holy bishop convoked the whole Christian population, and exhorted them all to supplicate for the recovery of the dead man.
Silence being then made, he himself prayed with a loud voice, and, his prayer ended, he approached the body of the dead, and taking his hand commanded him to rise in the name of the Lord.
And he immediately arose, and, throwing himself at the bishop's feet entreated to be baptized.
Duke Stephen, also, on seeing this miracle, knelt before the holy bishop, imploring his forgiveness for the sin he had committed.
The blessed prelate, therefore, enjoined him a penance for putting to death the virgin and martyr, and baptized him with all his counts, and officers, and the whole army, and all the people of both sexes, to the number of fifteen thousand.
The duke of whom we are speaking, gave to Martial, his master in Christ, large sums of gold and silver, that he might build churches to the honour of the Lord.
He also granted him large domains, with many beneficiary estates, and vineyards, and serfs, in the province of Limoges, to enable him to embellish the churches he built, and to supply the wants of the clergy, who were to serve God in them.
lie afterwards erected a hospital for the poor, to the charitable memory of Valeria, in which he directed three hundred poor persons to be fed daily.
He also founded another, in which he made provision for refresh­ ment being given daily to a crowd of the indigent, to the number of six hundred;
and he also built a church over the tomb of St. Valeria, virgin and martyr.
Meanwhile Stephen, prince of the Gauls, was summoned to Italy by order of the emperor Nero, and there served in the army for six months with four legions of soldiers.
During his military service Stephen did not forget the divine laws, but so ordered his troops that every one was satisfied with his own, and if any committed robbery he suffered death.
After the term of his service was expired Stephen obtained his leave of absence, but he was unwilling to return to his own states until he had seen the blessed Peter the apostle.
He hastened therefore, with all his troops, to Rome, and entering the city they found the apostle teaching great crowds of people in a place called the Vatican.
Approaching the apostle with bare feet and sackcloth on their loins, they knelt before him and humbly besought his blessing.
St. Peter, seeing the flower of the youth of Gaul, and learning that they had all been instructed in the gospel of Christ and baptized by the blessed Martial, was filled with joy and gave blessings to the Lord.
He made many anxious inquiries of the pious duke concerning the manners and grace and way of life of the holy bishop, and the duke took pleasure in recounting many particulars of his goodness and miracles, and the conversion of the people who hastened from all parts to the font of holy baptism.
When the duke had received absolution from the apostle for having shed the blood of the innocent Valeria, he offered him the two hundred gold livres which he had just received as a donation from the emperor Nero, but the apostle directed him to take the gold to the holy bishop, that he might employ it in erecting churches or relieving the poor.
Having therefore received the apostolic benediction, Stephen and his soldiers returned to Gaul, and at the duke's sugges­ tion they visited their common father before they returned to their own homes.
Arriving at a certain royal palace called St. Junien, they pitched their tents and pavilions on the bank of the river Vienne.
1
The heat of the weather drove them to the river for refreshment both from the dust?
and from the sun's rays, when Hildebert, son of Arcadius count of Poitou, was drowned by the devil at a place called Gram, and died on the spot, nor could his body be found although the whole army searched for it.
Arcadius and all the soldiers were overwhelmed with grief, and hastening with lamentations to Limoges, he humbly implored the aid of Martial on his son's behalf.
Great crowds of Goths and Saxons, and people of other provinces, had now flocked to Limoges, desiring to hear the word of salvation from the holy man.
Arcadius therefore and all the people threw themselves at Martial's feet, beseeching him with much lamentation on behalf of the young man drowned in the river.
The holy man wept with them, and came to the place clothed in sackcloth, and with naked feet.
All present joining in prayer, the mali of God adjured the demons, who lurked in a hollow of the channel, that they should render themselves visible to the people and bring the corpse of the young man to the river-bank.
Immediately the body was cast ashore at the distance of about six furlongs, the demons appearing in the shape of swine.
At length, the people making deprecatory prayers and the bishop adjuring, they rushed violently from the river, and came and lay down at the feet of St. Martial.
They were like the Ethiopians, black as soot, their feet enormous, their eyes terrible and bloody, their whole body was covered with bristly hair, and from their mouths and nostrils they breathed sulphureous flames.
Their speech resembled the croakings of the raven;
and when the bishop demanded their names one of them answered;
" I am called thousand-craft, because I have a thousand arts of deceiving the human race."
Another said;
“ I am called Neptune, because I have dragged numbers of men into this hole and plunged them into the torments of hell.”
The holy bishop inquired, " Why do you wear rings of fire on your snouts ?"
The demons replied:
" When we have seduced the souls of men, it is by chains attached to these we drag them to our master."
The bishop asking their master's name, they replied:
" Strife, for lie never ceases to stir up quarrels, and his rage and passion are without end."
The demons then entreating the bishop that he would talk no more with them in Latin, and would not send them into the abyss or the boundless ocean, he commanded them, in the Hebrew tongue, to depart into a desert place, and to hurt no living creature to the day of judgment.
The demons then flying through the air appeared no more.
And now the duke with the whole crowd of people, and all the army collected from different provinces, and present at this extraordinary spectacle, threw themselves at the feet of the holy bishop pitifully imploring him to restore life to the young man who then lay dead.
The bishop, moved at their distress, commanded all with one heart to make intercession to the Lord, and taking the hand of the deceased said, " In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Hildebert arise;
" and he immediately arose and lived piously twenty-six years after­ wards.
While all who witnessed so glorious a miracle were praising God, St. Martial called Hildebert and made inquiry of him, for the edification of the hearers, what he saw while he was dead.
With some hesitation, he related as follows :
—
"Bathed in sweat from the intense beat of the sun, I was washing myself in the river, when suddenly the demons plunged me into a deep hole and drowned me.
But when they attempted to bind me in chains of fire, an angel of the Lord stood by me and delivered me out of their hands.
We had begun to take the road to the east, when two bands of demons opposed our progress, throwing at us fiery darts.
One of these bands attacked us in front, while the other assaulted us in the rear.
For my part I was terribly frightened, but the angel my companion encouraged me;
beginning to sing with a melodious voice and sweet expres­ sion :
‘
Bless the Lord, 0 my soul;
and all that is within me, praise his holy name.
Who forgiveth all thy iniquities and redeemeth thy life from the pit.’
'At length we reached the purgatorial fire, where Christians are punished for such of their daily transgressions as are not aggravated to mortal sins.
Purgatory is a river of fire, with a bridge across, over which the angel of the Lord conducting me stood still, and taking my hand said :
‘
Here you will remain until, being cleansed from all your sins, you are fit to be a partaker of the heavenly kingdom.’
This being passed we arrived at the gate of Paradise, near which we found a crowd of demons assembled, whose rage and whose slanders I horribly feared.
But at that moment a voice was heard from heaven, saying:
' Let the soul of the young man return to his body, and let him live twenty-six years.'
The angel who conducted me was of incredible beauty, his whole aspect surpassing the human race.
To my inquiries concerning our doctor, St. Martial, he replied :
‘ His merit in heaven is great because he has continued in celibacy, and is and means to be free from the love of women.
From his youth he began to serve the Lord and attach himself to the blessed Peter, never returning to his father's house.
As he is known to be free from the concupiscence of the flesh, so he will be delivered from the pains of death.
Twelve angels are commissioned by the Lord to attend him constantly, who do not suffer him to be weary, nor to hunger or thirst, but preserve him from all evil and shield him from every touch of sorrow.’
”While Hildebert was relating these things and others similar to them, the hearts of the bishop and the duke and all the assembled people were gladdened, and they offered thanksgivings to the Lord for all the benefits conferred upon them.
Hildebert, observing the angel's admonitions, shaved his bead, and attaching himself to the blessed prelate devoted himself to the service of the Lord, neither drinking wine nor eating flesh.
He went bare-foot, and was satis- Red with bread and water for food, and sackcloth for raiment.
He gave himself up to constant prayers, and frequent fastings, and.
the continual performance of good works.
All that he inherited from his parents he distributed to the poor;
and reserved nothing for himself on the mor­ row.
Multitudes followed his example, and renouncing their own wills hastened to Christ by the narrow way.
Duke Stephen published an ordinance directing that through all the nations which were subject to his dominion, the temples and idols should be broken down and burnt with fire, and that they should worship the one only God, whom they should strive to obey.
He himself, as he had learnt from his master, observed a life of religion towards God.
He was liberal in alms, just in his judgments, care­ ful for the poor, docile, and devoted to the priests and all the ministers of God;
lie was the wise father of the Chris­ tians, but a fierce persecutor of the pagans.
From the day of his baptism he was never defiled by connection with any woman, but lived in chastity to the day of his death.
There was in the city of Bordeaux a count named Sige­ bert, who for six years was grievously afflicted with para­ lysis.
Hearing the miracles which were wrought by the blessed Martial, he directed his wife Benedicta to go with all haste to the man of God, and, taking with her twenty- six livres in gold and a sufficient sum in silver, implore the favour of God through the intercession of his friend.
She used the utmost despatch in preparing what was com­ manded, and hastened to the man of God with an escort of two thousand eight hundred horsemen.
On her arrival she earnestly petitioned the man of God for her husbands health, which he, rejoicing in her faith, promised to restore.
He therefore delivered his staff to the matron, commanding her to lay it on her husband and he would be healed.
He refused to accept the gold and silver, but according to the Lord's commandment conferred the spiritual benefits gratuitously.
He baptized the noble Benedicta and all the companions of her journey, and dismissed them to their homes confirmed in the faith.
Meanwhile, when the populace of Bordeaux flocked to the idol temples and the priests burnt incense, the demon said that be would come out at the command of a certain Hebrew named Martial, and published with sorrow the great virtues of the holy bishop and his honour with God.
As the matron was entering the city on her return, the elders of the people proceeded to meet her, and told her all that they had heard from Jupiter.
Then the countess sent for the chief pontiff of the idols, and commanded him that he should go to all the temples, except those of the unknown God, and utterly destroy them.
She then with her Chris­ tian companions implored God's mercy, and coming in his name to her husband's bed, placed on him the blessed apostle's staff.
Immediately his limbs, which had been injured by the contraction of the nerves, and dried up by fever, became instantly as though they bad never lost their power.
After the just-named Count Sigebert was healed be went with a great retinue to the holy bishop and was regenerated by him, with all his followers, in the water of holy baptism.
He returned abundant offerings of prayers and thanks for the heavenly benefits conferred upon him, and lived many years afterwards happily in the service of . the Lord.
It happened on a certain occasion, that when the city of Bordeaux was, for the presumption of the inhabitants, in danger of being consumed by fire, the flames threatening its entire destruction, the pious Benedicta, in full faith, op­ posed the staff of the man of God to the progress of the fire, invoking the aid of the Creator, whose omnipotence she confessed.
And the conflagration was immediately extinguished, so that no traces of fire remained.
At that time Martial, the bishop of Christ, moved by divine inspiration, went to the bank of the river Garonne, and preached the gospel to multitudes who flocked to him at a place called Mortagne ;
remaining there three months in the saving work of his divine mission.
Nine demoniacs brought by their parents in chains from the city of Bordeaux were healed by St. Martin, the demons being expelled.
The demons also, who by virtue of Christian faith were expelled from the city of Bordeaux, incensed with those whom they had subjugated, took possession of some mise­ rable idolaters, and entering their bodies grievously vexed them.
Their parents therefore brought them to the man of God, at whose prayers and commands their malignant enemies issued forth from their mouths with torrents of blood, and were no more seen.
On one occasion when the blessed St. Martial preached in Mortagne, and crowds of people flocked to hear the true doctrine, Count Sigebert resolved to join him with a con­ siderable body of soldiers, and to show his friendship by supplying him with all that was necessary for meat and drink.
Among other things he desired a quantity of fish, and despatched his servants to the sea for the purpose of fishing.
When at last the fishermen, bringing with them many kinds of fish, were looking forward with anxiety to reach the shore, a sudden storm arose and threatened them with shipwreck and destruction.
The countess Bene­ dicta, who with a crowd of people was on the shore waiting, saw the danger in great alarm.
And now men began to sink with the boats, when the devout woman, extending her hands towards heaven, called upon God with a loud voice, and the storm immediately ceased.
The fishermen, with their boats, and fish, and nets, came safe to the harbour, and all who saw it glorified God.
On his return from Mortagne the amiable prelate again visited Limoges, and thence went to a village called Ansae.
It boasted an idol of Jupiter held in great veneration by the heathen, which drew together numbers of sick folk labouring under various infirmities.
On the bishop's arrival the demon was dumb, but at the request of the inhabitants the man of God commanded him to come out of the image, and breaking the statue show himself to the people in a visible form.
There forthwith issued from the statue what had the appearance of a negro boy, .black as soot, covered with dark and rough hair from head to foot, and fire flashing from his mouth, nostrils, and eyes, with a sulphu­ reous smell.
Thus the saint showed the people what sort of god they had worshipped, and repeated his order to the demon that he should destroy the image ;
which he accord­ ingly reduced to powder, and never again appeared.
Then the venerable bishop assembled round him all the sick, and making the sign of the cross over them healed them in the name of the Lord, baptizing all those who appeared to dwell in that place.
Returning afterwards to his own see, he caused oratories to be built, and decorated them care­ fully with rich ornaments.
One he dedicated to the honour of St. Stephen the first martyr, his own kinsman, and another to St. Peter the apostle, his own master.
1
The altar was overlaid all round with plates of gold.
When the churches were built, the blessed bishop fixed a day for the consecration, and Duke Stephen caused preparations to be made for entertaining all who came to the holy solemnity.
When however the holy bishop was celebrating the mass, Herve, count of Tours, was carried off by the devil, as well as his Christian wife.
But the holy man did not suffer them to be long tormented, but calling them to him, he rebuked the devils for taking possession of them.
But they replied, that it was permitted them on account of the transgression of the count and his wife, who, contrary to the bishop's precept, had polluted themselves with carnal knowledge the whole night.
Upon the count and the people entreating favour for the possessed, the holy bishop restored them to sound health and vigour, expelling the demon in the name of the Lord.
The church of St. Peter was consecrated on the sixth of the nones [2nd] of May, in the reign of the emperor Nero, when so dazzling was the light shed in it on the day of dedication, that it was scarcely possible to distinguish one person from another.
These ceremonies being duly performed, the blessed Mar­ tial ordained Aurelian to succeed him in the see of Limoges after his own decease.
He also caused Andrew the priest to preside over the church of St. Peter the apostle, settling in it Hildebert, son of Count Archadius, and thirty-six clerks besides, for whom Duke Stephen provided out of his own domains an abundant revenue, to supply food and clothing.
Much has been written on the life of the blessed Martial, which cannot be fully recounted in detail.
To sum up his character shortly, he was deeply imbued with divine wis­ dom, illustrious for his piety, exemplary in his morals, and regarded with awe for the miracles he wrought.
Holding the world cheap, and loving God and his neighbour, for him " to live was Christ, to die was gain."
He restored, as we have often noticed, sight to the blind, and caused the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the dumb to speak, and the dead to return to life.
There are many other particulars worthy to be recorded, as Aurelian remarks, of works done by St. Martial by the grace of Christ, which would be considered as apocryphal by unbelievers, if they were committed to writing.
In the year 40, after our Lord's resurrection, when the blessed Martial was praying, as he was wont, the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him in glory with his disciples, and having graciously saluted him by name, predicted that the fifteenth day from thence would be the period of his departure out of this world.
The holy man, full of joy, gave thanks to God, and during two weeks, prepared for his end with fasting, and watching, and prayer.
After a short ces­ sation, to rest his wearied limbs, he rose in the night for prayer at the hour appointed, and continued his prayers and divine lauds to the second hour of day.
Then he offered the holy sacrifice to the Lord, for himself and the whole church, at the second hour, and afterwards preached diligently until the evening.
Towards the close of day, as night approached, he took the nourishment to which he rigorously confined himself, viz. bread and water.
The period of his vocation being near, the holy man con­ voked his brethren and announced to them, that the day of his departure was at hand;
making known the same also by messengers he despatched through all the provinces and districts which he had gained for the Lord.
Great numbers assembled in deep sorrow, viz., the people of Poitou, Berry, Auvergne, Gascony, and Gothia.
The day of his death drawing near, at the request of all he went out of the gate of the city called the Lime-gate, and there delivered a discourse on the true faith and the divine operations, and profitably recounted the blessed virtues which adorn the Christian life.
At the end of his discourse he gave the benediction to the people, commending them to God in devout prayer, and then causing himself to be carried into the oratory of St. Stephen, and lying there in sackcloth and ashes waited his end, while, with bended knees and hands outstretched to heaven, he caused prayers to be offered to aid him in his last struggle.
At the close he thus addressed the Lord:
" Into thy hands, 0 Lord, I commend my spirit and whilst those who stood around were weeping and pray­ ing, he made a sign with his hand for silence, and said to them:
"
Be still, hear ye not the songs of praise proceeding from heaven ?
surely the Lord cometh, as he promised and immediately a great light shone around, and the voice of the Lord was heard calling him, and saying:
" Blessed spirit, depart," and instantly he rose to heaven, surrounded by the glorious light, while a concert of angels was heard.
On the morrow, at the third hour, a paralytic who touched his bier immediately became sound.
When his body was carried forth for burial, at the moment of the departure towards the church of St. Stephen, the heavens were opened and continued open while the bearers of the holy remains carried them to the place of interment.
Moreover, as a multitude of infirm persons was collected at the funeral, the blessed Alpinian taking the sudarium of the holy bishop applied it to the bodies of the sick, and invoking the name of Christ all were healed.
Among the rest a dropsical man was brought from Toulouse, with six blind persons and four demoniacs, who, on the day following the obit of the holy bishop, were presented before his tomb, and healed by the touch of the sacred napkin.
Innumerable other miracles were wrought by the most holy prelate after his interment, the great number of which forbids their being reduced to writing in detail.
Probably larger volumes, if they were written, would not content those who are dissatisfied with the present account.
1May the holy bishop Martial, the cotemporary of Christ and the companion of the apostles, who was the pious pastor.
of Limoges, and the first who preached to the people of the west, intercede for us who speak of him, that, protected by his prayers, we may be found worthy to be partakers of the.
eternal inheritance.
Amen.HAVING determined to compose a history from the works of former writers, I commenced with ecclesiastical history, in the beginning of which I collected some short accounts of the holy apostles.
Now, by God's help I shall endeavour to give a regular series of the Roman bishops, beginning with St. Peter the apostle, to whom Christ gave the keys of the kingdom of heaven;
an undertaking I consider neces­ sary, and useful to studious persons and others who desire instruction.
My careful researches extend through eleven centuries, from the time that the Almighty Emanuel came to us, veiled in the flesh which he borrowed from the im- iaculate virgin.
The city of Rome, which from its very foundation carried its fasces in triumph over all its neigh­ bours, and which, by God's providence, extended its fron­ tiers to the Euphrates and the Ocean, saw also many illustrious champions, who, by God's aid, held the reins of ecclesiastical discipline.
It is delightful to trace their tri­ umphant course over the waves of this world, that those who walk in the steps of the Christian heroes may strive to imitate their noble acts which lead to salvation.
The blessed SIMON PETER, the prince of the apostles, son of John, and born at Bethsaida., in the province of Galilee, first filled the see of Antioch during seven years.
He then went to Rome in the reign of Claudius, to oppose Simon Magus, and there preaching governed the church twenty- five years.
He often disputed before Nero and the people against Simon, whom he defeated;
and his martyrdom by Nero at the same time as that of St. Paul, took place in the year 36 from the passion of our Lord, on the third of the calends of July [29th June].
1LINUS, son of Herculanus, and born in Tuscany, occupied the see of Rome eleven years, three months, and twelve days, suffering martyrdom on the sixth of the calends of December [25th November].
Following the precept of the apostle Peter, he decreed that no woman should enter a church without having her head covered.
2CLETUS, born at Rome, sat twelve years, one month, eleven days, and suffered under Domitian on the sixth of the calends of May [26th April].
The see remained void twenty days.
Rufinus, priest of Aquileia, says in the pre­ face of his history of Clemens, that Linus and Cletus performed the functions of bishops during the life of Peter the apostle, and afterwards succeeded him.
1 am much surprised that so sensible a critic and historian, and one so well read, both in Greek and Latin authors, should not have recollected, that both these bishops finished their blessed course by martyrdom, and that no one suffered persecution at Rome for the cause of Christ until the thirteenth year of Nero, after the fall of Simon Magus.
Linus suffered in the time of Vespasian, and Cletus in the persecution under Domitian.
1CLEMENS, born at Rome on the Celian Mount, whose father was Faustinus, filled the see ten years, two months, ten days, and was thrown into the sea under the emperor Trajan on the ninth of the calends of December [23rd No­ vember].
The see was vacant twenty-one days.
Following the discipline of the blessed Peter the apostle, he was so eminent for the ornaments of a good conversation, that he was esteemed by the Jews and Gentiles, as well as by the Christians, whose poor he caused to be all registered, not suffering those who had been purified by holy baptism to become public mendicants.
He gave the consecrated veil to Flavia Domitia, a virgin who was niece of Domitian and espoused to Aurelius, and confirmed Theodora the wife of count Sisinnius in her resolution of chastity.
Her husband, having been led by his passions to follow her as she secretly entered the church, was immediately by St. Clemens' prayers struck blind and deaf.
His servants seeking to remove him could not find the door, although they searched for it all round for some time, until Theodora obtained by her prayers on her husband's behalf, that he and his attend­ ants might depart.
Conducted home, his blindness still continued, and when mass was ended Theodora stated all the circumstances to Pope Clemens, who exhorted the people to offer their prayers.
He himself, with the woman, visited the diseased man, and by his supplications caused his sight and hearing to be immediately restored.
But though he recovered his bodily senses, he lost his reason, and ordered Clemens, whom he accused of following his wife, to be siezed and brought to him.
His servants also attached ropes to stone pillars, and dragged them within and without the house.
Sisinnius and his servants being thus Iliad, Clemens departed, and Theodora spent the whole day in weeping and praying for her husband.
At length in the evening Peter the apostle appeared to her and com­ forted her, saying:
" Sisinnius shall be saved by thee, in order that the word spoken by my brother Paul the apostle be fulfilled:
' the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife.'
"1 Sisinnius, recovering his reason, caused Theodora to invite Clemens to come to him, and confessing his former folly, declared his belief in Almighty God, and being confirmed in the faith was baptized the following Easter, with three hundred and twenty-three persons of both sexes.
2
Many noble and illustrious persons believed through him, and professing the true faith received baptism.
Publius Torqueanus, count of the sacred offices, becoming jealous of the increase of the Christians, gave money to his officers in various provinces, to stir up opposition to the name of Christ.
A tumult of the people took place at Rome, while Mamertine was prefect, and by command of Publius Torqueanus, Clemens was privately brought before him ;
but the bishop, by his sensible replies, endeavoured to bring him over to the true faith.
The tumult still raging, a report concerning Clemens was forwarded to Nerva, and also to Trajan.
The rescript of Trajan ordered that if Clemens refused to sacrifice to the idols, he should be banished to the city of Chersona, beyond the Euxine Sea.
But the Lord gave such grace to the blessed Clemens that even the heathen judges grieved for him.
Julian, the president, sorrowfully commended him by prayer to God, and supplied him with a ship, freighted with all that his comfort required, and he was accompanied in his exile by many devout persons, both of the clergy and laity.
The holy pope found at his place of banishment more than two thousand Christians, condemned to hew blocks of marble;
and rejoiced that they were suffering for the name of Christ, instructing them fully in the doctrine of patience and keeping the faith.
Hearing that they had to fetch water on their shoulders six miles, he prayed the Lord to give them water.
When his prayer was ended, he saw a lamb standing on a hill, and gently struck with a short rod the spot which the lamb had pointed out, by lifting its foot;
whereupon a fountain burst forth supplied by copious springs, and speedily forming a river.
This being known, the whole province flocked together, and great numbers listened to the teaching of St. Clemens, so that in one day five hundred souls, or more, were baptized;
and in less than a year seventy-five churches were erected, the idols being demolished by the believers.
After three years, a malicious accusation was forwarded to Trajan at the instance of the pagans;
and he sent the tribune, Aufidius, who put to death many Christians by various kinds of suffering.
After this general massacre he ordered Clemens to be embarked alone on the sea, and thrown into the waves with an anchor attached to his neck.
While this was doing, Phæbus and Cornelius, with a crowd of Christians, stood on the shore praying, with floods of tears, when the sea receded for almost three miles from the shore, and people walking on the dry land saw a strange spectacle.
For they found a small building, having the appearance of a marble chapel, built by angelic hands, and the body of St. Clemens deposited therein in a stone coffin by the ministry of angels, with the anchor by which the body had been sunk laid near.
It was revealed to the disciples that they should not remove the body, as, on the recurrence of the anniversary of St. Clemens' martyrdom, the sea would again recede, and for seven days permit approach to the tomb.
Many miracles were wrought there, and all the heathen in the neighbourhood believed in Christ, and became servants of Him who liveth and reigneth for ever and ever.
Amen.1By a constitution of Clemens's, the altar-cloth, the chair, and the candelabrum, were to be burnt when they became worn out.

Heaven and earth are full of thy glory:
hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
hosanna in the highest."
Sixtus ordained that the character, truthfulness, life, and conversation of any one who brought forward charges against the clergy, should be narrowly scrutinized, and that no attention should be paid to such as were ignorant of the true faith, whose lives were irregular, or who came from the houses of Christ's enemies.

4SILVESTER, a Roman, whose fathers name was Rufinus, and his mother's Justa, was bishop of Rome twenty-three years, ten months, eleven days.
5
He was educated at Rome by Cyrinus the priest, and imitating his life and conversa­ tion, reached the highest point of Christian perfection.
From his youth he was given to hospitality and other good works.
At that time he entertained Timotheus on his coming from Antioch to Rome, and seconded his efforts in publicly preaching Christ.
Fifteen months afterwards, when Timotheus was put to death for the truth by Tar­ quin, prefect of the city, Silvester conveyed the body of the martyr by night to his own house, where he assembled Melchiades the bishop, with the holy priests and deacons, to perform the obsequies of the martyr for Christ.
Timotheus was thus honourably interred in the garden of Theona, a Christian matron, near the tomb of St. Paul.
But Silvester was arrested by order of Perpenna Tarquin, and thrown into prison to be tortured on the morrow as a confessor of Christ.
Meanwhile, however, the prefect, while at dinner, was choked by a fish-bone in his throat, and Silvester was joyously released from prison, while his persecutor was car­ ried with mourning to the grave.
Silvester was thirty years old when he was ordained deacon, and soon afterwards, at the entreaty of all the people, he was ordained priest by Melchiades the holy bishop.
On his death, Silvester was unanimously elected pope.
He was illustrious for his virtues, and the merit of his sanctity procured for him the esteem of all men.
An enormous dragon appeared on the Tarpeian mount, on which the Capitol stands, and the magicians with the sacri­ legious virgins resorted to it once a month, with sacrifices and offerings, descending three hundred and forty-five steps, as if they were going to the infernal regions.
The dragon rose suddenly, and though he did not go forth, his breath so poisoned the air of the neighbourhood, that it caused a great mortality, and especially there was much lamentation for the death of children.
At length, the heathen, having entreated Silvester's help, he enjoined a three-days' fast on the Christians, after which, as he had been instructed in a vision by St. Peter the apostle, he descended with three priests and two deacons, and in the might of God chained up the dragon, so that the whole city, from that day and ever afterwards, delivered from its pestiferous breath, gave thanks to God.
Many of the Romans who witnessed this, having thus escaped the plague of the dragon, and believing in Christ, were baptized.
The emperor Constantine, compelling the Christians to sacrifice to idols, and making great slaughter among those who refused to worship images, Silvester retired from the city, with his clergy, and concealed himself for some time on Mount Soracte, devoted to fasting and prayer.
The avenging hand of God, however, struck Constantine with elephantine leprosy, and thus checked the effusion of the blood of his servants.
The emperor, in despair at such a calamity, inquired anxiously for some cure for his disorder, and by the abominable counsel of the priests of the Capitol, ordered a crowd of infants, to the number of three thousand, to be massacred, that a bath might be prepared of their blood, in which, plunging while it was yet reeking, he was told his leprosy would be cured.
But when Constantine went forth from his palace to the baths, and perceived crowds of women bitterly bewailing the [threatened] slaughter of their child­ ren ;
he inquired the cause of such great lamentation, and learning the fact, was dreadfully shocked.
He condemned such savage cruelty, and extolling the humanity of the Ro­ man government in a long and eloquent speech, ordered the children to be restored to their mothers unharmed, adding liberal gifts, with provisions and carriages, and thus sent them away to their homes rejoicing.
The night following, the blessed apostles Peter and Paul appeared to him in a vision, and admonished by them, he recalled Silvester and his clergy, and heard from his mouth instruction in the true way of salvation, and truly submitted to him in all things.
Then the pope imposed on himself and the whole Christian population a week's fast, at the end of which, on Saturday evening, he ordered the laver of sal­ vation to be prepared in the Lateran palace, and consecrated it according to the ritual.
Constantine was then baptized, and while a bright light shone round for nearly half an hour, he was cleansed of his leprosy, and confessed that he had seen Christ.
By command of the emperor Constantine, a council of forty-four bishops was assembled at Rome.
In it Pope Silvester disputed with twelve of the most learned Jews, overwhelming them by God's help, with a mass of powerful authorities.
He contended against the rabbins Abiathar and Joases, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one God.
Against the scribes Godoliah and Anna, he showed clearly, from the books of the prophets, that Christ was born of a virgin, tempted by the devil, betrayed by a disciple, arrested by his enemies, mocked and scourged;
that he drank vinegar, and was sold;
that his garments were divided by lot;
that he was nailed to the cross, dead, and buried.
Against Dohet and Chusi, masters, and Bonoin and Arohel, interpreters of the law, he showed the vast benefits arising from the incarnation, the temptation, and the passion of Christ.
Against the pharisees Jobal and Thara, it was authoritatively maintained that Jesus Christ is perfect God and perfect man, who, in his human nature, was tempted, suffered, and died, that he might procure the salvation of all men;
but the divine nature was exempt from suffering, as the light which shines upon a tree, when an incision is made by the stroke of an axe, receives no impression.
A copious argument was sustained by Seleon the priest, that the Son of God is rightly called the Lamb without spot, because he was slain for the offences of the whole people.
He was born of the virgin, that we may be horn of our virgin mother the church.
He was thrice tempted, that he might deliver us from the like temptation;
taken, that we may be set free;
bound, that we may be liberated from the bonds of the curse;
mocked, that he might deliver us from the illusions of the demons;
sold, that he might redeem us;
humbled, that we might be exalted;
a captive, that he might deliver us out of captivity to the demons;
stripped, that the nakedness of the first man, by which death entered into the world, might be covered ;
crowned with thorns, that he might eradicate from us the thorns and thistles of the original curse;
having gall for meat, and vinegar for drink, that he might bring us into a land flowing with milk and honey;
and finally, sacrificed on the altar of the cross, that he might take away the sins of the whole world.
Here the cause of the devil failed, who, having set calf against calf, and goat against goat, could not find a lamb to set against the Lamb without spot.
Our King died, that he might subdue the power of death;
he was buried, that he might consecrate the tombs of the saints;
he rose again, that be might give life to the dead;
he ascended into heaven, that be might not only restore to man the paradise he has lost, but might also open to him the gates of heaven.
He now sits at the right hand of the leather, that he may grant the prayers of believers;
and he will come to judge the living and the dead, that he may render unto every one according to his works.
This is the true faith of Christians.
When Silvester bad argued these and many other matters with great force, and Seleon, in the silence of the other Jews, had commended the statements of the pope, Zambri the twelfth, who was a very skilful magician, put himself forward in opposition.
This man chose to contend, not with the authentic words of scripture, but with magic arts, de­ manding that a mad bull should be brought to him in the presence of them all.
The pope and the emperor assenting, presently the bull of Terence, who was so fierce that a hun­ dred stout soldiers could hardly hold him, was brought in;
And upon Zambri's whispering something secretly into its ear, the wretched animal groaned, and its eyes leaping from their sockets, instantly expired.
Upon this, the crowd of Jews began to insult Silvester, and for nearly two hours there was a violent tumult.
The emperor, having at length enforced silence, Silvester, advancing to the magician, demanded whether he could restore to life, in the name of the Lord, the bull which he bad just put to death.
This Zambri was unable to do, but he declared loudly and swore, by the life of the emperor, that if Silvester would recover the bull from death, all the Jews would renounce the law of Moses, and embrace the religion of Christ.
Hearing this, the holy pontiff spread out his hands, and prayed for some time in tears, and on bended knees.
His prayers being ended, he drew near to the bull, and cried with a loud voice :
"
In the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified by the Jews under Pontius Pilate, rise up, and stand quickly."
The animal immediately arose, and the holy bishop, having set free its horns from the bonds, " Go peaceably," he said, "to the herd to which you belong."
And the bull immediately returned to the herd with all gentleness.
Then all the Jews threw themselves at the feet of Silvester, and entreated that they might be regenerated by the water of baptism.
Helena, herself, the emperor's mother, appeared in public without reserve, kissing the feet of the pope in the sight of all, and begging him to assign her a place of penance.
At the same moment, many demons came out of the bodies they had taken possession of, confessing that they were compelled to depart by the commands of St. Silvester.
In the disputation between the Jews and Christians, which has been already mentioned, the empower and senate appointed Zenophilus and Crato censors and umpires, the one being a Greek and the other a Latin.
Both were skil­ ful orators, men of ,,-it, and lovers of truth, and had been for a long time held in the highest esteem in the Roman court, as men of probity and contemners of avarice.
Both were heathens, so that they might favour neither party on account of religions, but study only to promote justice, neither Christians nor Jews suspecting them of inclining to their side.
On the triumph of the Christian cause through Silvester, many gentiles as well as Jews believed, and as the controversy was held in the beginning of the first month, they changed their names, and were baptized at Easter.
From that time the Lord's name began to be magnified by the Roman people, and the company of the faithful throughout the world to be strengthened, and greatly exalted everywhere by the power of God.
At the command of Constantine, Silvester assembled a council of 318 bishops at Nice, in Bithynia, and of 227 at Rome.
It was decreed that no layman should prosecute a charge against a clerk, and that the oppressed should choose their own judges.
Deacons were to wear dalmatics, and to cover their right arm with a linen napkin.
No clerk was to proceed in the civil courts for any cause whatever, nor to plead before any judge except in the ecclesiastical court.
The sacrifice of the mass was not to be celebrated with a silk or coloured altar-cloth, but with one of linen only, as it is read our Lord's body was so wrapped by Joseph at his burial.
Whoever wishes to become a soldier of the church, and to rise in the ranks, he must be a reader for twenty years, an exorcist for thirty days, an acolyte five years, a sub-deacon five years, a deacon seven years, a priest three years;
and afterwards, if he be worthy, he may be made a bishop.

and his days count in the episcopate of Liberius;
for the statutes which Liberius made before his banishment have force, but those enacted after his return are void, because he had joined the heretics.

This pope excommunicated Peter, bishop of Alexandria, and Acacius, bishop of Constantinople, who had departed from the right faith, sending two bishops, Misenus and Vitalis, from the apostolic see to depose them.
But when they reached the city of Heraclea, they were induced by bribes not to execute the pope's commission.
Felix, having heard this, examined the affair and excommunicated both.
He consecrated thirty-one bishops, and was buried in the church of St. Paul, the Apostle, in the time of the king Theodoric, and Zeno, the emperor.

This pope published constitutions for the entire church.
He composed tracts and hymns like St. Ambrose, and published works against Eutyches and Nestorius, which are preserved to the present day in the.
archives of the libraries.
He ordered the Manicheans, whom he discovered at Rome, to be carried into banishment, and caused their books to be burnt before the doors of the Church of Santa Maria.

The see was void seven days.
ANASTASIUS [II.], a Roman, whose father's name was Peter, of the fifth region called the Bull's Head, filled the see one year, eleven months, and twenty-four days.
3
Many of the clergy withdrew from his communion, on his wishing to recall Acacius privately, which he could not accomplish because he was struck by God.
He consecrated twenty bishops.
He was buried in the church of St. Peter the Apostle, on the thirteenth of the calends of December [19th November], and the bishopric was vacant four days.
SYMMACHUS, born in Sardinia, whose father's name was Fortunatus, filled the see fifteen years, seven months, twenty-seven days, in the time of Theodoric the king and Anastasius the emperor.
1
He was consecrated in opposition to Lawrence, bishop of Nocera;
and by the decision of Theodoric, as he was the first consecrated and had the majority, he was confirmed in the apostolic see.
But, three years afterwards, he was falsely accused through the ill-will of the Romans, and Peter, bishop of Altinum, usurped the apostolic see contrary to the canons.
2
A great schism was therefore made in the church, and the clergy again divided.
But Pope Symmachus justified himself in a synod, in which one hundred and fifteen bishops were assembled, and Peter of Altinum, the usurper of the apostolical see, and Lawrence of Nocera, were condemned.
Then Symmachus was replaced on the apostolical throne at St. Peter's by all the bishops, the clergy, and people, in great triumph.
However, Festus, chief of the senate, and Probinus, ex-consuls, and other senators, commenced disturbances in the city, and attacked all who were in communion with Symmachus with such violence that they even dragged nuns from their convents and retreats, and, regardless of their sex, scourged them until their naked bodies were wounded with the stripes.
They fought daily against a church in the middle of the city, where many priests and others of the faithful were slain.
Among others, Dignissiulus and Gordian, priests, were taken and slain with staves and swords, as well as many other Christians.
None of the clergy were safe in the city, by night or by day;
and Faustus, the ex-consul, was the only one who fought for the church.
Notwithstanding, Sym­ machus maintained himself from the consulship of Paulinus to that of Senator.
He drove into banishment the Manicheans, whom he discovered at Rome, and burnt their images and books before the gates of the basilica of Constantine.
He enriched the churches of the saints with a variety of ornaments, and ordained one hundred and seventeen bishops.
He ordered the angelic hymn1 to be sung every Sunday.
Every year he supplied money and clothes to the bishops who were banished to Africa and Sardinia.
He ransomed captives in Liguria and other provinces, and distributed largely to the poor.
After many good works he was interred in the church of St. Peter, on the nineteenth day of the month of July;
and the bishopric was vacant seven days.
HORMISDAS, born in Campania, son of Justus, of the city of Frusinone, filled the see eight years, and seventeen days.
By the advice of King Theodoric he sent to Constantinople Eunodius, bishop of Pavia;
and Fortunatus, bishop of Catania;
to absolve the Greeks who had been excom­ municated on account of the heresies of Peter, bishop of Alexandria;
and Acacius of Constantinople.
But the emperor Anastasius, favouring the Eutychian heresy, sent back the envoys in great haste, and in his rescript to the pope, among other things, said haughtily:
"It is ours to command, not to be commanded.
”Not long afterwards, by God's permission, he was struck with thunder.
He was succeeded by Justin, a Catholic, who willingly submitted to the directions of the pope in all things, and received with honour Germanus, bishop of Capua, and the other envoys from the apostolic see, who were conducted by the consul Vitalian, and a great company of monks and men of rank, from the Round Tower to the city of Constantinople.
Some of the clergy who were accomplices with Acacius, envious of such a triumph, shut themselves up in the great church of St. Sophia, and taking counsel together, sent a message to the emperor, that unless Acacius, their bishop, was unconditionally restored, they would refuse submission to the apostolic see.
At this time, Clovis, king of the Franks, becoming a Christian, sent an offering to the tomb of St- Peter the Apostle, with precious jewels.
The aforenamed pope flourished from the consulship of Senator to the time of Symmachus and Boëtius, and ordained fifty-five bishops in different places.
He was interred in the church of St. Peter, the Apostle, on the eighth of the ides [6th] of August.
The bishopric was vacant seven days.
1JOHN, a native of Tuscany, son of Constantius, sat two years, nine months, and sixteen days, from the consulship of Maximus to that of Olibrius.
At that time Justin, the orthodox emperor, wished to extinguish all heresies, and have the churches in which they were taught consecrated to the true faith.
At this Theodoric Walamir, being a heretic, was much incensed, and determined on ravaging the whole of Italy with the sword.
Pope John was re­ quested by the king at Ravenna to undertake a mission to Constantinople, which, though he was sick, he accomplished, and while there gave sight to a blind man.
He was received with great honour by the emperor Justin whom he crowned, and obtained from him indulgence for the heretics to save Italy from devastation.
Meanwhile, the heretic king put to death the illustrious senators and ex-consuls Symmachus and Boethius.
Pope John also, and the senators who had been honourably entertained by the emperor, were treache­ rously arrested by Theodoric on their return;
and the pope was imprisoned at Ravenna and suffered martyrdom on the fifteenth of the calends of June [18th May].
Theodoric himself, by the will of God, died suddenly ninety-eight days afterwards.
Pope John consecrated fifteen bishops.
His body was translated from Ravenna to the church of St. Peter at Rome;
and the bishopric was vacant fifty-eight days.
1FELIX, a Samnite, son of Castorius, filled the see four years, two months, and thirteen days, in the time of The­ odoric, and Alaric his nephew, and of the emperor Justinian, from the consulship of Tiburtius to that of Lampadius and Orestes.
He was inaugured without tumult, and ordained twenty-nine bishops.
lie was interred in the church of St. Paul the Apostle on the fourth of the ides [12th] of Oc­ tober.
The bishopric was vacant three days.
2BONIFACE, born at Rome, whose father's name was Sigi­ buld, sat two years, twenty-five days, in the time of Alaric, the heretic, and the emperor Justinian.
At his election there was great dissension, both among the clergy and in the senate, for twenty-eight days.
Dioscorus was consecrated at the same time in the basilica of Constantine;
but, by God's will, he died shortly afterwards on the second of the ides [14th] of October.
He had numerous partisans.
As for Boniface, he gave dishes of meat to the priests and deacons, and notaries, supplied from his own patrimony, and made abundant provision of food for the clergy when famine threatened.
He assembled a synod in the church of St. Peter, and chose the deacon Vigilius for his successor, but afterwards, repenting his having subscribed the act, erased his signature in the presence of the clergy and senate.
He was interred at St. Peter's on the seventeenth day of the month of October, and the see was void two months fifteen days.
3JOHN MERCURY, a Roman, son of Projectus, of the Cœlian Mount, filled the see two years, four months, six days, in the time of Alaric and Justinian.
That pious emperor, actuated by warm devotion to the Christian religion drew up a statement of his belief, which he sent to the apostolical see, with his own signature and many valuable gifts, by 'the hands of Eparchius and Demetrius.
John consecrated twenty-one bishops.
He was interred at St. Peter's on the sixth of the calends of June [27th May], and the see was void six days.
1AGAPITUS, a Roman, son of Gordian, a priest, filled the see eleven months, eighteen days.
Theodotus, king of the Goths, who had put to death Amalasonta, daughter of king Theodoric, sent him to Justinian the emperor, by whom he was honourably received at Constantinople.
While there he procured the banishment of Anthemius, bishop of that city, because he denied the two natures of Christ.
Having consecrated Mennas, a Catholic, bishop of Constantinople, he died there on the tenth of the calends of May [22nd April.]
His body was conveyed to Rome in a leaden coffin, and interred at St. Peter's on the twelfth of October, and the bishopric was vacant one month twenty-eight days.
2SILVERIUS, a native of Campania, son of Hormisdas, bishop of Rome, sat one year, five months, six days.
He owed his elevation to the tyrant Theodotus, who was in­ duced by bribery to effect it by violence and terror.
Two months afterwards, by God's will, Theodotus died, and Witigis having carried off and married the daughter of Amalasonta, ascended the throne.
The emperor Justinian commissioned Belisarius the patrician to deliver Italy from the Goths.
The patrician consequently laid siege to Naples, which he took by storm, putting all the Goths and citizens to the sword, so that not even the priests and nuns in the monasteries escaped.
Soon after this Witigis, collecting an army of Goths, besieged Rome for a whole year, vast num­ bers perishing by the sword as well as by the famine which now prevailed throughout the world.
No one was allowed to enter or depart from the city.
All property, private and public, not excepting the churches, was destroyed by fire, and the inhabitants were either butchered, or fell victims to famine and pestilence.
At length, God in his mercy sent Belisarius to defeat the Goths and save Rome.
The em­ press requested Silverius to recall the heretic Anthemius, but the pope putting his trust in God refused compliance, and defended the sentence of his predecessors by his own authority.
Upon this, the empress commanded Belisarius the patrician to send Silverius into exile, and to substitute Anthemius as his vicar-general in the church of Rome.
Belisarius very reluctantly complied with the orders of the empress, and the pope being charged by false witnesses with plotting to deliver up Rome to the Gothic king, by introducing him at the Asinarian gate near the Lateran, he was arrested in the Pincian palace.
Antonine, the patrician, then sharply rebuked the pope, and John the sub-deacon, removing the pallium from his shoulders, divested him of his pontifical robes in his chambers and dressed him as a monk.
Silverius was banished to the island of Pontia, where, after great suffering, and being reduced to bread and water for sustenance, he was buried on the twelfth of the calends of July [20th June].
He consecrated eighteen bishops, and after his death performed many miracles in healing the sick.
The see was void fourteen days.
1VIGILIUS, a Roman, son of the consul John, filled the see fifteen years, six months, twenty-six days.
At this time Belisarius defeated Witigis, and John, the bloody master- general of the army, pursued him all night and made him prisoner.
The captive king being conducted to Constan­ tinople, Justinian received him into favour, and creating him patrician and count, sent him to reside on the Persian frontier, where he remained until his death.
The emperor also conferred on Belisarius the highest military dignity, and employed him in Africa.
Deceiving Guittarith, king of the Vandals, with friendly professions, Belisarius put him to death, and restored Africa to the dominion of Rome, from which it had been detached ninety-nine years.
He then visited Rome, and made many offerings to God and St. Peter, distributing also alms to the poor, from the spoils of the Vandals.
The Empress Theodora urged Pope Vigilius, also, to recall the heresiarch Anthemius, but he positively refused, adhering strictly to the opinions of his predecessors.
At the suggestion therefore of some ill-disposed Romans, who imputed the death of Silverius to the pope, Anthemius sent an imperial commissioner, arrested Pope Vigilius in the church of St. Cecilia, and carried him to Constantinople by way of Sicily.
For two years the Greeks used the whole influence of the imperial authority to induce him to recall the heretic, as he had promised when he filled the office of deacon.
But the pope persisted in his refusal, preferring an honourable death to a dishonourable life.
At length, when upon his strongly declaring his resolution in the pre­ sence of Justinian and Theodora, some one struck him in the face, the pope fled to the church of St. Euphemia, and clung to the pillar of the altar.
But he was forced out of the church and dragged round the city by a rope about his neck till the evening.
He was then committed to close custody, and the Roman clergy who had attended him were sent to different mines.
Meanwhile, the Goths elected Totila king, and soon after­ wards laid siege to Rome.
During the continuance of the siege the famine in the city was so severe that mothers were ready to feed on their own children.
Totila at length gained entrance into the city, of which he held possession for some time, the people sheltering themselves in the churches.
But afterwards the emperor sent Narses his eunuch and chamberlain into Italy, who defeated the army of Totila who fell in the battle.
The emperor Justinian was full of joy at this intelligence, and on the petition of Narses and the Romans set at liberty Pope Vigilius and his clergy;
but he died of stone at Syracuse.
His body was brought to Rome and interred in the church of St. Mar­ cellus, on the Salarian road, when the see was void three months and five days.
This pope consecrated eighty-one bishops, and appointed Ampliatus the priest his vicar to govern the church during his exile, and sent from Sicily Valentine the bishop to the Lateran.
1PELAGIUS, a Roman, son of John the vicar-general, filled the see eleven years, ten months, and twenty-seven days.
He was consecrated by two bishops, John of Perugium and Bonus of Ferentino, with Andrew priest of Ostia.
Numbers of the religious, and well-informed, and noble persons separated from his communion in the persuasion that Pelagius was a party to the death of Pope Vigilius, in consequence of the sufferings he had undergone.
Pope Pelagius, therefore, and Narses consulted, and a procession having been formed from the church of St. Pancras, when litanies were sung, and hymns and anthems chanted, on their arrival at St. Peter's, the pope ascended a pulpit, holding the gospels in his hand with the crucifix raised on high, and satisfied the people that he had done no injury to Vigilius.
He consecrated forty-nine bishops.
Pelagius was buried at St. Peter's on the 6th of the nones [2nd] of March.
The bishopric was vacant three months, and twenty-five days.
'JOHN, a Roman, son of the illustrious Anastasius, filled the see twelve years, eleven months, and twenty-six days.
At that time the Heruli having elected Sindbal their king, were bent on subjugating the whole of Italy, but Narses slew their king and entirely defeated them.
He also, by God's aid, put to death Amingus [Lothaire], and Buceline, chiefs of the Franks, who invaded Italy, to which he restored peace and prosperity.
The Romans, however, from envy, accused him to Justinian, and raised disturbances against his government.
Nurses therefore, upon finding himself deprived of his dignities by the emperor, called in the Guinilian Lombards, who inhabited Pannonia, to invade Italy.
Narses died not long afterwards, and his body being enclosed in a leaden coffin was conveyed, with all his wealth, to Constantinople.
Pope John consecrated sixty­ one bishops, and was buried in the church of St. Peter the apostle on the 3rd of the ides [13th] of July.
The. bishopric was vacant ten months and eleven days.
1BENEDICT, a, Roman, SOIl of Boniface, sat four years, one month, and twenty-eight days.
2 King Alboin led the Lombards into Italy in the year of our Lord 568.
A great famine then afflicted Italy and compelled it to submit to Alboin.
Upon learning this, the emperor Justinian sent to Egypt, and causing ships loaded with corn to be despatched to Rome, thus saved the city from the famine which threatened it.
This emperor, for his numerous victories over foreign enemies, received the surnames of Alamannicus, Gothicus, Vandalicus, and Africanus.
He founded a church, within the walls of Constantinople to the honour of Christ, which is called in Greek "Hagia," meaning Santa Sophia.
This building so surpasses all others that it stands unrivalled among all the edifices in the world.
Justinian was a prince devoted to the Catholic faith, pure in his conduct and just in his judgments, so that he succeeded in all his enterprises.
In his time Cassidorus, a senator who afterwards became a monk, distinguished himself at Rome both in sacred and profane learning.
Among his other excellent works, one of the principal is a commentary on the Psalms.
At that time also Dionysius, who was made an abbot at Rome, composed an admirable work on calculating Easter.
Priscian, also, a native of Cæsarea, but established at Constantinople, penetrated, if I may so speak, all the depths of grammatical science.
Arator, likewise, sub-deacon of the church of Rome, an admirable poet, gave the Acts of the Apostles in hexameter verse.
Then also the most reverend father Benedict, who first settled at a place called Subiaco, forty miles from Rome, and afterwards at Monte Cassino, shed around him the light of his great virtues and apostolical life.
His life, as is well known, has been the subject of an eloquent discourse in Pope Gregory's Dialogues.
Pope Benedict died, worn out with -labours and troubles, and was buried in the church of St. Peter, the 2nd of the calends of August [31st July].
He consecrated twenty- one bishops ;
the see was void three months and ten days.
1PELAGIUS, a Roman, son of Winigild,2 filled the see ten years, eleven months, and ten days.
He was consecrated without the emperor's confirmation, because Rome was besieged by the Lombards who were fearfully devastating Italy.
In his time there was much bloodshed and excessive rain.
The pope was suddenly carried off by a contagious pestilence, and died on the 7th of the ides [7th] of February;
and was buried at St. Peter's.
He consecrated forty-eight bishops for different places, and the see was vacant six months and twenty-five days.
3
GREGORY, a Roman and philosopher, son of Gordian the prætor, a man of the highest rank, and of the most excellent Sylvia, presided over the Roman see thirteen years, six months, ten days, in the reigns of the emperors Tiberius, Constantine, Maurice, and Phocas.
1 Gregory composed forty homilies on the gospels;
he wrote commentaries on the Psalms and Ezekiel, and published a pastoral and a dia­ logue, with many other works which we cannot stay to enumerate.
This incomparable doctor was highly distin­ guished for deep wisdom and great learning, both in the writings and discourses of his useful labours, by which he rendered the greatest service to the sons of the church of God.
He added to the canon of the mass the words, "And grant thy peace in our days," &c.2
The Roman patrician and exarch came to Rome while Gregory was pope, and occasioned great troubles.
3
On his return to Ravenna, he seized the cities of Sutri, Bomarzo, Amelia, re'rouse, and some others held by the Lombards.
Upon this, the king Agilulf, being greatly incensed, attacked Perouse with a powerful army, besieging in it Maurision, general of the Lombards, who had submitted to the Romans, whom he made prisoner in a few days, and immediately put to death.
Not long afterwards, Agilulf, having returned to Pavia, made a lasting peace with the Romans, through the media­ tion of the blessed pope Gregory.
At the same time, St. Gregory commissioned the servants of God, Mellitus, Augustine, and John, with several others who feared the Lord, to preach to the English nation, and convert them to the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.
After many great and memorable works, Pope Gregory was buried in the church of St. Peter the Apostle, before the sacristy, on the fourth of the ides [4th] of March.
He consecrated seventy-two bishops in different places, and the bishopric was vacant five months and eighteen days.
1SABINIAN, a native of Blesa,2 in Tuscany, whose father's name was Bonus, sat one year, five months, and nine days.
At this time Rome was afflicted with a grievous famine;
and the pope, having concluded a peace with the Lombards, caused the granaries of the church to be opened, and corn to be sold at the rate of thirty bushels of wheat for a shilling.

This:
produced a great disturbance, and Zachary, the protospa­ thaire, was despatched to Rome by the emperor with orders to arrest the pope, and bring him to Constantinople.
But the Almighty stirred up the troops at Ravenna and the Pentapolis, who marched to Rome and blockaded the city gates, that they might have an opportunity of killing Zachary, while he, much alarmed, fled to the pope's own chain­ ber, and pusillanimously concealed himself under the bed in terror of his life.
The soldiery from Ravenna, entering Rome by St. Peter's gate, beset the Lateran palace with their armed bands, and when the gates were shut against them, threatened to demolish them unless they were immediately opened.
Upon this, the holy pope went out and gave an honourable reception to the soldiers and the people who had hastily assembled for his protection, addressing them in courteous terms, so that their fury was assuaged.
But, full of zeal for God and love for the prelate, they would not relinquish the guard of the palace until they had driven the before named spathaire from the city with disgrace.

Duke Basil and Paul the exarch,2 with other mal­ contents, received instructions from the emperor Leo to put to death Pope Gregory;
but the Romans and Lombards, by God's providence, resisted their attempts, and protected the holy bishop.

He had decreed that no image of our Saviour or of his holy mother, or of any saint, martyr, or angel, should be allowed in the churches, pretending that they were all forbidden.

The see was void eight days.
ZACHAUT, a Greek, son of Polychronius, filled the see ten years, three months, and fourteen days.
3
Adorned with every virtue he conferred great benefits on the church.
In his time Italy was in a very disturbed state:
the pope, however, had an interview with King Liutprand, and suc­ ceeded in negotiating a treaty of peace for twenty years, and, recovering the prisoner Liutprand, died in the thirty- second year of his reign, and was succeeded by Ratchis, son of Pemmon duke of Forli.
Then while the emperor Constan­ tine marched against the Arabs, one Artabasdus contrived to usurp the government, but Constantine assembling the army of the cast took the imperial city by storm, and de­ prived the rebel and his accomplices of sight.

1
The people had elected another Stephen, a priest;
but, three days afterwards, rising from sleep in good health, and sitting down for the despatch of business, he was suddenly deprived of sense and the power of speech, and died the next day.
Upon this, Stephen, the deacon, a man adorned by every virtue, was elected pope.
At that time Astulph, king of the Lombards, cruelly persecuted the church, and used every effort to reduce Rome itself to subjection.
In consequence, the pope, finding that neither money nor prayers were of any avail, was under the necessity of undertaking a journey to France, to implore protection for the church.
He was received with high honour by King Pepin and the Frank nobles, and was entertained the whole winter at the Abbey of St. Deny's, near Parish Soon afterwards Pepin laid siege to Pavia with an army of Franks, and compelled Astulph to swear to a treaty of peace with the Romans, but, as soon as Pepin retired to his own states, Astulph broke his oath, besieging Rome for four months, and violating the cemeteries, in which he disinterred the bodies of many of the saints.
At the pope's entreaty Pepin again besieged Pavia, and, forcing the perjured king to surrender Ravenna, Narni, Rimini, and many other towns, added them to the patrimony of St. Peter.
Not long afterwards Astulph perished while he was hunting, by a stroke divinely directed, and Duke Desiderius took possession of the throne.

he ordained sixty bishops, and after his death the see remained void one year and one month, while the intruder Constantine took possession of the apostolical seat.
STEPHEN, a Sicilian, son of Olybus, filled the see three years, five months, and twenty-eight days.
2
He was a firm, wise, and excellent prelate, and rendered great services to the church.
Before his election an unprecedented outrage was committed at Rome;
for Toto, duke of Nepi, compelled George, bishop of Præneste, very reluctantly, to consecrate the duke's brother Constantine pope, he being a layman.
3
Soon after the ordination George fell sick, and became so infirm that he never afterwards sang mass.
For his right hand dried up and became so palsied that he could not raise it to his mouth.
A year after Rome was delivered up to Christopher the dean, and Sergius the sacristan, and Duke Toto was treacherously assassinated by Demetrius and Gratiosus.
Upon this, Stephen was lawfully elected pope with the general consent;
and not long afterwards the intruder Constantine, with his brother Passibius, and Theodore, bishop and apostolic-vicar, were seized by some ruffians, who deprived them of sight;
and Christopher, with his son Sergius and several others, perished by the craft and emissaries of King Desiderius.
4
Meanwhile'Stephen, soon after his consecration, sent Sergius the secondary to the court of Charlemagne, king of the Franks, entreating his aid and advice.
Upon this the king deputed to Rome twelve of the French bishops of the highest character, and best instructed in the holy scriptures, and in the rules of the sacred canons.
1
In the month of April a synod of bishops assembled in the church of St. Saviour, near the Lateran palace, and Con­ stantine, who from a layman had been so precipitately made a clergyman and pope, was unanimously condemned.
The synod further decreed, under penalty of excommunication, that no layman, or person of any order, should be raised to the popedom, except by passing through the regular degrees of orders;
and that all which this Constantine had sanc­ tioned in ecclesiastical affairs and divine worship should be performed anew, except baptism and holy unction.

2
Of noble rank and grace­ ful person, he was moreover firm, devout, and holy.
In his time Desiderius, king of the LOIn bards, inflicted great evils on Rome, on Ravenna, and on the places subject to them.
In consequence Charlemagne, at the pope's request, under­ took an expedition into Italy, and after besieging Pavia for five months, by God's help forced it to surrender;
and marching from thence to Rome, he and his army entered the city, amidst the highest honours, on the Saturday before Easter.
He sent Desiderius captive to France, with his queen, and restored the patrimony of St. Peter which he had seized.
3
Pope Adrian founded and ornamented churches and did many memorable things.
He prevailed on the emperor Constantine to assemble a council of three hundred and fifty bishops at Nice, the acts of which he caused to be translated from Greek into Latin.
1
In the twentieth year of this papacy the Tiber overflowed its banks as far as the door of St. Peter's church, doing great injury to the citizens ;
but the pope ordered processions, and the Lord in his mercy abated the flood.

LEO [III.], a Roman, son of Aizuppius, sat twenty years, five months, and sixteen days,3 following in all things the examples of his predecessors.
While he was engaged in the due performance of his office, and on a certain day was going in procession with the people to the church of St. Peter, Paschal the primicier, and Campol the sacristan,4 rushed from an ambush with their armed followers, and dispersing the terrified and unarmed populace, made an attempt to deprive the pope of his tongue and his eyes before the very altar of St. Peter.
But some days afterwards
Albinus the chamberlain released him from prison, and the Lord Almighty restored him to perfect health.
Winigis, also, duke of Spoleto, came to his aid, and seeing the pope, who had been wounded with clubs and dashed before the altar, half dead and weltering in his blood, now wonderfully restored to health, the duke and the rest of the faithful glorified God.
The pope afterwards paid a visit to Charlemagne, and complained to him of the treatment he had received.
He was received with the honours due to his high rank, and on his return was attended by two archbishops, Hildebald and Arno, with six bishops and three counts.
1
The king himself soon afterwards went to Rome and was crowned by the same pope on Christmas day at St. Peter's, being proclaimed by all, both Romans and Franks, emperor of Rome.
After this, on the second of the calends of May [30th April], the ninth indiction, a violent earthquake entirely destroyed the church of St. Paul, which Pope Leo rebuilt with great magnificence.
This pope also instituted the rogations for three days before our Lord's ascension.

but he died shortly afterwards in sanctity.
GREGORY [IV.], a Roman, son of John, distinguished for his noble person and birth, and a wise and holy bishop, filled the see sixteen years.
3
In his time the Saracens made irruptions from their own territories on the islands and states of the Christians, which they grievously ravaged, butchering the inhabitants, and destroying in their fury the churches and dwellings of the faithful.
Pope Gregory sur­ rounded Ostia with walls to protect it from their incursions, from which it was afterwards called Gregorianopolis.4
His other good deeds were numerous;
for he built many churches, and, translating numerous relics of the saints, deposited them in suitable receptacles.
He consecrated one hundred and eighty-five bishops, and was buried at St. Peter's.
The bishopric was vacant fifteen days.
SERGIUS [II.], a Roman, whose father's name was also Sergius, filled the see three years.
5
Although lie was ca­ nonically elected, John the deacon, with a band of armed peasants, burst the gates, and, trampling on all the tradi­ tions of law and order, forced their way into the papal palace.
But in the course of an hour the troops, being seized with a panic, took to flight, and John the intruder was made prisoner, and having been scourged was degraded from his office of deacon.
1
At that time the emperor Lothaire sent to Rome Drogo, archbishop of Metz, with his own son Lewis, attended by many bishops, abbots, and counts.
On their route they made great slaughter in the towns and country, so that the native inhabitants, terrified at their cruelty, were forced to take refuge in woods and dens.
Then, on a certain day, the sky grew black with clouds, and some of Drogo's chief attendants were struck with lightning and killed.
Lewis, however, proceeded to Rome, when Pope Sergius anointed him with holy oil, and consecrated him king of the Lombards.
2
This pope or­ dained twenty-three bishops and founded several abbies and churches.
He was buried at St Peter's, and the bishopric was vacant two months and fifteen days.
LEO [IV.], a Roman, son of Radvald, sat eight years, three months, and six days.
3
He shone brightly, like the sun, in the world, by his inestimable gifts, serving the church of God in various ways, both by building and embellishing churches, and by other useful undertakings.
Presently, after the death of Pope Sergius, the Saracens pillaged the .churches of St. Peter and St. Paul;
but as their fleet was returning to Africa it was destroyed by a tempest.
4
At that time there was such an earthquake at Rome that all the elements seemed in disorder.
Pope Leo prohibited laics from remaining in the sanctuary while mass was celebrated.
In the first year of his papacy, he drove away by his merits and prayers a basilisk which, lurk­ ing in the dark caverns of Rome, destroyed many persons with its pestiferous breath.
This holy pope also extinguished a fire which raged furiously in the street of the Saxons, by simply making the sign of the cross.
1
He founded and embellished many churches, rebuilt cities, and repaired the walls of Rome.
He also built a wall round the church of St. Peter, and was in some sort the founder of a city, since called from his name, the Leonine city, which he consecrated in the presence of the whole population of Rome with great rejoicings on the 4th of the calends of July [28th June].
2I HAVE now given, in a short chapter, such an account of a hundred popes who presided in the apostolical see after St. Peter, as I could collect from the writings of Pope St. Da­ inasus to Jerome, or in the Pontifical.
3
But further, respect­ ing the forty popes who filled the apostolical see from the time of Leo IV.
to the present time, I have not yet been able to discover any genuine accounts;
I shall, therefore, venture to say but little about them.
Their names only it will be my endeavour to supply in regular order, but I am under the necessity of observing silence on their origin and acts, until, by God's help, I shall have been able, as I wish, to meet with fuller records concerning them.
Pope BENEDICT filled the see one year, six months, and ten days.
1Pope NICHOLAS, four years and ten months.
2Pope ADRIAN, five years.
3Pope JOHN, ten years.'Pope MARINUS, one year and four months.
5Pope ADRIAN, one year and four months.
6Pope AGAPITUS, one year.
7BASIL STEPHEN8 one year;
then FORMOSUS,9 JOHN,10 and STEPHEN,11 flourished in the time of Lewis d'Outremer,12 They were followed by MARINUS, AGAPITUS, OCTAVIANUS, LEO, BENEDICT, BENEDICT, GERBERT, SILVESTER, AGA­ PITUS, and BENEDICT.
Thus, for nearly a hundred and ten years, eleven popes filled the apostolical see of whom I have been hitherto unable to discover either the genealogies, or the time of their elevation, or the date of their deaths.
13CLEMENT SUITGER, who had been bishop of Bamberg, filled the see nine years, and crowned the emperor Henry and his empress Agnes.
1DAMASUS, formerly bishop of Aquileia, sat one year.
2 LEO, a Lorrainer, sat five years.
Under the name of Bruno he was bishop of Toul.
When pope he came into Gaul and held a great council at Rheims.
He restored to vigour many ancient decrees of the holy fathers which had fallen into disuse, and made many useful reforms both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs.
3GEBEHARD VICTOR filled the see three years.
4FREDERICK STEPHEN, son of Duke Gothelon, sat one year.
5GERARD NICHOLAS, the first pope of the French nation, sat two years.
6ALEXANDER of Lucca filled the see eleven years.
7GREGORY HILDEBRAND, a monk from his childhood, filled the see fourteen years.
In his time the emperor Henry expelled the pope, and, intruding G-uitberg, bishop of Ra­ venna, into the apostolical see, caused great disturbances in the church of Rome.
8DESIDERIUS VICTOR, who was abbot of Monte-Casino, filled the see eleven months.
9URBAN ODO, who had been a monk of Cluni, and bishop of Ostia, sat twelve years.
He it was who stirred up the armies of Christendom to march to Jerusalem against the infidels.
10PASCAL REINER, a native of the valley of the Brutians, a monk, sat twelve years.
1GELASIUS JOHN, born at Gaieta, sat two years.
2CALIXTUS GUY, son of William, duke of Burgundy, who was archbishop of Vienna, filled the see six years.
3HONORIUS LAMBERT, who was bishop of Ostia, sat five years.
4INNOCENT GEORGE, of the family of the Papii, has filled the see twelve years.
He held a great council at Rome in the ninth year of his papacy, at which many affairs were determined, although there are but scanty records of its proceedings.
5IT is our duty to devote ourselves unceasingly to the Cre­ ator's praise in all his works, although his majesty and might are beyond our powers of comprehension, and we are quite incapable of speaking in fitting terms of his ineffable loftiness and unwearied lovingkindness.
These are exhi­ bited in every page of the Old and New Testament;
these are the subjects of the study and meditations of every wise man.
But who can penetrate the mystery of the immensity of God ?
The knowledge of the love of Christ is above the skill of man, while to search it out and embrace it, and use our utmost efforts in pursuing it, is both our proper task and fraught with the fulness of everlasting salvation.
For this, holy men whose worth is recorded in authentic writings, now associated with the angels, triumph in the heavens;
having despised transitory things and courted eternal realities, and abhorred carnal delights, that they might enter upon the blessed fruition of those that are spiritual.
Following their Saviour's footsteps through the difficult path of a holy life, they have left us a salutary example, by imitating which we also may reach by the way of righteous­ ness the heavenly inheritance;
an enterprise rendered so difficult to our sloth and weakness by the burden of our sins.
Still it is our duty to struggle faithfully in their steps and follow the course they have pursued, that partici­ pating in their merits, we may, by God's mercy, be one day found worthy to share the joys of their blessed society.
In the former part of my work, I have had the satisfac- tion of giving an account of some of these friends of God, and masters and rulers of his people, to meditate on whose lives, or to speak of them faithfully is an agreeable exercise for the soul, and a salutary remedy for her inward disorders.
Now, however, my superiors have set me another task, and an ample field opens before me in the history of the Nor­ mans, who issuing from Denmark1 were addicted not to letters but to arms, and who, until the time of William the Bastard, were more given to fighting than to reading or writing.
Dudo, dean of St. Quentin, has related with eloquence the wars of the first three dukes, of whose actions his work is a copious and poetical panegyric.
2
It was dedicated to Richard, the son of Gonor, whose good graces the author wished to secure.
This work was neatly abridged by William, surnamed Calculus, a monk of Jumiege, who flourished somewhat later, and added a short but perspi­ cuous account of the four succeeding dukes.
1I COMMENCE my present undertaking with speaking of that vine of the Lord of hosts which he himself plants,1 and preserves throughout the world against the devices of Behemoth.
The shoots of this vine were freely propagated by the labours of the Lord's husbandmen in the country formerly called Neustria, but now Normandy,2 producing abundant fruit in men devoted to a holy life.
These faith­ ful labourers founded in that province many monasteries where the true branches of the vine, that is good Christians, planted themselves in common accord, in order to struggle more safely to the end against the wiles of their spiritual enemies.
The blessed bishop Ouen, who flourished in the time of Dagobert king of the Franks and his son Clovis, and was of distinguished worth both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs, founded a convent for nuns at Fecamp, and another for monks in the city of Rouen, where he was himself buried in the year of our Lord 678, and his remains lay undisturbed for one hundred and sixty-five years, until Rouen was ravaged by the Northmen.
3
In the time of this bishop, St. Wandrille collected a numerous society of monks at Fontenelles, and the blessed Philibert, the brave standard-bearer of this noble army, shed lustre on Jumièges.
1
In earlier times, also, when Hilperic, and Childebert his nephew, governed the Franks, and protected the innocent against evil-doers by their royal authority, Evroult, a native of Bayeux, guided by the instructions of an angel, founded a monastery in the forest of Ouche.2
He thus effected the reformation of the rude natives who before lived by plunder and robbery, attracting them to a better course of life by the doctrines he taught them and the miracles he exhibited.
In other places also the Lord propagated his vine by the labours of faithful husbandmen, abundantly filling the hearts of the Gauls with the sweetness of his salvation.
The kingdom of the Franks having been, by God's favour, highly exalted above the neighbouring nations, and widely extended by the frequent triumphs of the Frank kings, Pepin, Charlemagne, and Lewis the Pious,3 avarice, pride, and lust, began to prevail excessively among all ranks of men, from the highest to the lowest, plunging them into the depths of iniquity, and.
causing them to rebel against the Author of their salvation, whose commandments they no longer obeyed.
Both the clergy and laity of every degree, infected with these disorders, fell from their former virtue, and yielding to the seductions of the world, the discipline for which they were once remarkable, became enervated and extinct.
Still the divine compassion long spared the guilty, calling them to repentance in various ways.
The penitent mercifully snatched from the snares of iniquity obtained pardon, while those who perished in their evil courses incur­ red the infliction of the scourge of the divine anger.
In the time of Charles, king of the Franks, surnamed the Simple, Biorn, also called Iron-sides, son of Lodbroc, king of the Danes, accompanied by Hasting, his tutor, and a nume­ rous band of young warriors, issued from their homes like a sword from the scabbard, for the destruction of the nations.
Suddenly sweeping over the shores of France, like a whirlwind rising from the sea, and reducing to ashes towns, cities, and holy minsters, for thirty years the invaders and their confederates harassed the Christians with con­ tinual inroads.
1
Then Rouen and Noyon, Tours and Poictiers, and other principal cities, were burnt,2 the de­ fenceless inhabitants were butchered, the monks and clergy were scattered, and the relics of the saints were either left unhonoured in their tombs within the ruined churches, or were transported by their pious worshippers to desolate places.
But, in the dispensations of Providence, the same race which inflicted desolation on Neustria, became not long afterwards the means of her restoration.
About thirty years after the ravages of Hastings,3 Duke Rollo, at the head of a powerful band of Danish youths, invaded Neustria, and strove by ceaseless attacks to exterminate the Franks.
In a pitched battle he slew their standard-bearer Roland, and defeated Reginald duke of Orleans with the army of the Franks.
He besieged the city of Paris for four years, but, God defending it, was unable to reduce it.
Baieux he took by storm, putting to the sword its count Berenger, whose daughter Poppa be married, and had by her a son called William Longue-epée.4.
In this and innumerable other conflicts he crushed the Franks, and laid waste almost the whole kingdom, as far as Burgundy, with fire and sword.
The Franks being unable to resist these attacks, and uniting in their supplications for peace, King Charles gave his daughter Gisela in marriage to Rollo, and ceded to him in perpetuity the entire country from the river Epte to the ocean.
3
In consequence, Rollo was baptized by the lord Francon, Archbishop of Rouen, in the year of our Lord 912, and casting away the idols which he before worshipped, with all his army devoutly embraced Christianity.
He died five years after his baptism.
4 William, his son, who suc- ceeded him in the duchy of Normandy and held it twenty- five years, restored to its former condition the monastery of Jumièges, which Philibert had founded, but which bad been laid in ruins by Hasting.
In the year of our Lord 942, when Lewis was king of the Franks, Duke William was murdered by the treachery of Arnulph governor of Flanders;
and Richard his son, then a boy of twelve years of age, became duke of Normandy, and through various turns of fortune, soma prosperous and some adverse, held the dukedom fifty-four years.
Among his other good deeds, he founded three monasteries, one at Fécamp, dedicated to the Holy Trinity,1 another at Mont St. Michel in honour of St. Michael the archangel, and the third at Rouen in honour of St. Peter the apostle, and St. Ouen the archbishop.
In the year of our Lord 996, on the death of Richard the elder, he was succeeded by Richard Gonorrides his son,2 who piously governed the duchy of Normandy thirty years.
He rebuilt the abbey of Fontenelles which St. Wandrille had founded and Hasting had ruined ;
and Judith his wife, sister of Geoffrey earl of Brittany, founded a monastery at Bernai in honour of St. Mary, mother of God.
On the death of Richard Gonnorides, his young son Richard succeeded, but be held the dukedom not quite a year and a half.
3
Then it fell to his brother Robert, who held it with great honour seven years and a half, and follow­ ing the example of his ancestors, laid the foundations of the abbey of Cerisi.
Moved however with the fear of God, he relinquished his worldly honours and undertook a voluntary pilgrimage to the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem, and died as he was returning home at Nice, in Bithynia, in the year of Christ 1035.
William his son, who was then only eight years old, was invested in the duchy of Normandy, which he governed firmly fifty-three years, notwithstanding the machinations of his jealous enemies.
He devoted himself to follow the example of his ancestors in all that related to the worship of God, and by his favour surpassed them all in wealth and power.
He founded two monasteries at Caen ;
one for monks in honour of St. Stephen the first martyr, and the other for nuns in honour of the Holy Trinity.
The barons of Normandy, moved by the zeal for holy reli­ gion which they observed in their princes, were eager to imitate them, and animated themselves and their friends to similar undertakings for the good of their souls.
They vied with each other in taking the lead in such good works, and in the liberality with which they made ample endowments. !
The most powerful nobles held themselves cheap if they had not on their domains some establishment of monks or clergy provided by them with whatever was necessary for the service of God.
Thus Roger de Toni founded the abbey of Chatillon, otherwise called Conches,1 where Abbot Gislebert, a man of great worth and wisdom, rose to eminence.
Goscelin d'Arques was the founder of a monastery, outside the walls of Rouen on the mount of the Holy Trinity, commonly called St. Catherine's,2 which the venerable abbot Isambert governed with much prudence and piety.
William, count d'Eu, at the instance of Lesceline his pious wife, caused the abbey of St. Mary to be built on the river Dive,3 the disci- plue of which was long maintained by Ainart, a German of great holiness and extensive learning.
In the time of Duke Robert I., Gislebert, count of Brionne, made an inroad with three thousand armed fol­ lowers into the district of Vimeux, but it did not turn out as prosperously as he expected;
for Ingelran, count of Ponthieu opposed him with a strong body of troops, and, giving him bat­ tle, vanquished and put to flight all his force, taking some of the fugitives prisoners and killing or wounding others.
In this extremity a knight named Herluin, being in peril of his life, and using every effort to save himself by flight, made a vow that if be escaped safely from this imminent danger, be would never again devote himself to any other service than that of God.
Being delivered in honour, by God's help, from the fate which threatened him, the knight, mind­ ful of his vow, retired from the world and founded an abbey on his estate, at a place called Bee, which he dedicated to St. Mary, mother of God.
1
The clergy of God's holy church then elected this noble and pious man to be the first abbot of the new monastery he had built.
While it was under his rule Lanfranc, Anslem, and other profound philoso­ pliers, resorted there to the Christian schools ;
2 and there William Fitz-Giroie, and Hugh count of Mellent, and other illustrious knights, enlisted themselves in the army of Christ.
There, up to the present time, numbers both of clerks and layman live under the monastic rule, and fighting against the devil, laudably devote themselves to God's service.
Humphrey de Vieilles, son of Thurold, began to erect two monasteries, one for monks and the other for nuns, at Preaux, which his son Roger de Beaumont kindly fostered, endowing them liberally from his own revenues.
3 William Fitz-Osborne also founded two monasteries on his own domain, one at Lire, and the other at Cormeilles, where he himself lies buried.
1
Many other Norman nobles, also, according to their means, constructed houses for monks or nuns in various quarters.
Hugh de Grand-mesnil and Robert, having their zeal roused by such examples, made a vow to build a monastery on their hereditary estates, for the good of their own souls and the souls of their ancestors.
IT was determined by Hugh and Robert that the monastery should be erected at Norrei,2 a vill belonging to them near Grand-mesnil;
and the work was already in progress, when a report was carried to William Fitz-Giroie their uncle, that his nephews, Hugh and Robert, had commenced building a convent.
This knight had been a man of great eminence in that age, terrible to his enemies, faithful to his friends.
He was at the head of a powerful family, including sons, brothers, and numerous nephews, who were formidable to their foes, far and near.
This knight, being invited by William Talvas, son of William Belesme, to his nuptials, and unsuspectingly accepting the invitation, was, without any cause of accusation cruelly deprived of his eyes and his genitals, and the tips of his ears cut off.
So odious a crime rendered Talvas universally detested, and some time after­ wards he was stript of his honours by his own son Arnulf.
William Giroie was all his life devoted to holy church, and held the monks, and clergy, and other men of religion in high honour.
Twice he made pilgrimages to the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem ;
3 once when he was in the full enjoyment of health and prosperity, and a second time when he had suffered the outrage which we have just mentioned.
On his return from this second pilgrimage he determined on quitting the world, and going to Bee, there assumed the monastic habit, and piously granted the church of Ouche to that abbey.
Upon this, abbot Herluin sent Lanfranc, who was afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, with three other monks to Ouche, causing them to re-establish there the divine worship which had fallen into disuse.
Mantling ivy overspread the mouldering walls of the church, and the place was deserted, except by two aged monks, Restould and Ingran, who maintained the service of God in deep poverty, but to the best of their power, in the desolate wilderness.
Some time afterwards, when William Giroie was informed of his nephews' vow to build a monastery, he sought them out and thus addressed them :
"
It causes me great joy, my dear sons, to find that Almighty God has vouchsafed to inspire you with the design of building a house in his name.
But you must be sensible that the spot on which you have begun to build is not suited for a habitation of monks, because it wants water, and the forest is at too great a. distanced
It is quite certain that these two elements are absolutely necessary to the subsistence of a convent.
Now, if you will take my advice, I will point out to you a more convenient site.
The place is in the canton of Ouche, where there formerly dwelt a holy abbot, the friend of God, whose name was Evroult, who assembled there a large body of monks, and after performing many miracles died happily in the Lord.
Restore that monastery which was ruined by the pagans.
You will find there abundance of water, and I possess a forest close by which will enable me to supply the convent with whatever is necessary.
Come then and see this spot, and if it pleases you, let us join in building there a house of God, and place in it a company of faith­ ful men who shall offer continual prayers on our behalf;
and we will endow it from our domains with such secure revenues that they may devote themselves altogether to the worship of God.
"Upon hearing this, his nephews Hugh and Robert thanked him for his proposal, and they all proceeded together to survey the spot he had pointed out.
On their coming there, a book containing the life of the holy father Evroult was presented to Robert, which he carefully perused and explained with intelligence to Hugh and the rest of his companions.
Need I say more ?
The situation of Ouche pleased the two brothers;
but as it had been formerly granted to the abbey of Bee, and certain monks from that convent were already stationed there, as before mentioned, the brothers made over to the abbot and monks of Bee a vilI called La Roussière,1 securing in exchange the fee of the land at Ouche.
In the year of our Lord 1050, the plan of restoring the abbey of Ouche being thus determined on, William and Robert, the sons of Giroie, with Hugh and Robert, the sons of Robert Grand-Mesnil, applied to William duke of Normandy, and informing him of their intentions entreated the assistance of his paramount authority in the good work they had undertaken.
They likewise made over the place so often mentioned to his guardianship, on a tenure so free that neither they nor any other persons whosoever should claim from the monks or their people either rent or cus­ tomary dues, or anything else except the benefit of their prayers.
The duke, very willingly acceding to their wishes, ratified the charter of the possessions which his nobles granted to St. Evroult, and caused it to be confirmed by the signatures of Mauger, archbishop of Rouen, and his suffragan bishops.
Hugh and Robert, having the duke's licence to choose an abbot, then proceeded to Jumièges, and besought the lord Robert, who was then superior of that abbey, to allow the monk Theodoric to take the government of their new abbey;
and abbot Robert, readily complying with the request of his noble guests, yielded to them the monk whom he well knew to be well qualified for such a pastoral care.
Hugh and Robert now, with great satisfaction, presented him to the duke, who receiving him with due distinction, delivered to him the pastoral staff, as the custom was, thus giving him the preferment of the abbey of Ouche.
Afterwards Hugh, bishop of Lisieux,1 with Osbern his archdeacon, and others of his clergy, came to Ouche with the venerable monk Theodoric in their company, and there solemnly consecrated him on the 3rd of the nones [5th] of October, being the Lord's day.
Thus ordained, he betrayed no pride or arrogance, but both by his words and works pointed out the way of true religion to those over whom he was set.
Brought up from his childhood in the Lord's house he had learnt by long practice the regular course of a religious life.
He was constant in holy prayers, in vigils, in fasting.
He so exposed himself to the rigour of the cold, that he some­ times went without a cloak the whole winter.
However, one day when he was preparing, as he was wont, to offer the sacrifice of the mass, lie perceived a cloak of dazzling whiteness laid on the altar.
Not doubting that it was placed there by no human hands but by the ministry of angels, he returned thanks to God, and investing himself with it joyfully performed the divine service.
That this happened in the church of Jumieges, while he was yet a cloistered monk, I have heard from trustworthy monks who then belonged to that monastery.
He was baptized by the venerable Theodoric abbot of Jumièges,2 who caused him to be educated according to the monastic rule in the school of Christ and loved him much.
Arriving at man's estate and being proved fruitful in good works, the abbot appointed him his vicar, to the great gain of the brethren's souls ;
and he was afterwards made master of the novices, and charged with the care of the monastery as prior.
At length, as we have before related, he was translated from Jumieges in the time of abbot Robert, and placed at the head of the new abbey of Ouche, in the year of our Lord 1050, the fourth indiction, being the nineteenth year of the reign of Henry king of the Franks, and the fifteenth of the dukedom of William duke of Normandy.
In founding the new society, Theodoric had the assistance of his nephew Rodolph, with Hugh the chanter, and others of the brethren who suited his purpose.
It was with them and by them that the new abbot zealously established a regular system, and mild discipline, and becoming order, in divine worship.
He admitted as probationers for a change of life applicants of every age and rank, diligently instructing them in the rule of the holy father St. Benedict.
Among the first of those he humbly taught a stricter life in the school of Christ, were Humfrey, Reginald, and Fulk, son of the dean Fulk, with some other skilful grammarians.
He like wise treated with the greatest kindness Riculf, an old man, and Roger, both country priests, and Durand the gardener, with Geof­ frey, Olrie, and other simple disciples.
As these were unable to comprehend the depths of scripture doctrine, he fed them with the milk of pious exhortation, and imparted to them health and strength in their faith and devotion by the example of his holy life.
In that house of God, also, Her­ bert and Berenger, Joscelin and Rodolf, Gislebert and Bernard, Richard and William, with other youths of good natural disposition, were carefully instructed in reading, singing, and writing, and the diligent prosecution of other useful studies, suitable to the servants of God seeking to acquire the true knowledge.
Meanwhile, the rude natives, witnessing the growth of so much holiness on a barren soil, now long deserted, were struck with admiration.
This was the salvation of some, the ruin of others.
Those who remarked the good conversation of the monks imitated their example;
while others, becoming jealous of them, caused them all sorts of inconveniences:
both received their just reward from God, who doeth equal justice.
Nobles and men of the middle order flocked to the abbey under a divine impulse, commending themselves devoutly to the prayers of the servants of God, and, offering their alms, gave blessings to God, who provided sustenance for his ministers, though on a barren soil.
The abbey of Ouche, thus flourishing through the merits of the holy father St. Evroult, and continually increasing, to the glory of God, by the care and labours of the family of Geroie, Roger de Montgomery,1 Visco unt d'Exmes,began to be jealous of his neighbours, because they showed more zeal for the love of God than himself, and he bethought him what work he could undertake of a like nature for the good of his own soul.
He therefore resolved on attaching to himself Gislebert, abbot of Chatillon, with his monks, who had begun to establish themselves at Norrei;
but, on Hugh and Robert's altering their plans, as before mentioned, refused to follow them, nay, more, left them altogether, accusing them of fickle­ ness, for having changed the site of their intended monas­ tery.
Roger de Montgomery, therefore, invited these monks, and granted Troarn to them, that they might there erect an abbey, expelling the twelve canons who had been placed there by his father.
2
These secular clergy being thus ejected because they abandoned themselves to gluttony, debauchery, carnal delights, and worldly occupations, he settled in their place monks who were subject to regular discipline.
In short, under the government of father Gis­ lebert, the monks established a strict religious rule in the church of St. Martin at Troarn, the maintenance of which they committed to their successors to the time of their death, and which has been preserved to this day under the enlightened fathers Gerbert, Durand, and Arnulf succes­ sively.
I wish now to take some short notice of Circle, son of Arnold-le-Gros, of Courceraut,3 son of Abbo the Breton, whose family conferred many benefits on the monks of St. Evroult, in order that posterity may know who and what he was.
He derived his origin from nobles of the highest rank, both of France and Brittany, and distinguished himself by his virtues and courage in the reigns of Hugh the Great and Robert, kings of the Franks.
His sister Hildiarde had three sons and eleven daughters, who, being married to honourable men, gave birth to numerous sons, who, in the next generation, became formidable to their enemies in the wars in France, England, and Apulia.
Among the other gallant exploits of Giroie, was his battle, in concert with William of Belesme, against Herbert, count of Maine.
William and his followers were vanquished and put to flight;
but Circle stood firm, and bore the brunt of the conflict, until Herbert and his troops were forced to retreat, and Giroie gained a victory, which, to this day, commands the applause of all who are informed of it.
Heugon,1 a powerful Norman knight, offered him his only daughter in marriage, and gave him Montreuil and Echaufour, and all his lands adjoining these two places.
Heugon dying soon afterwards, Geroie succeeded to all his domains, although the lady to whom he was betrothed died prematurely before the mar­ riage.
In consequence, William de Belesme introduced Giroie to Richard the duke of Normandy at Rouen;
and the generous duke, in acknowledgment of his high deserts, granted all the lands of Heugon to him and his heirs for ever.
On his return, Giroie married Gisela, a daughter of Turstin de Bastembourg, by whom he had seven sons and four daugh­ ters, whose names are as follows:
Arnold, William, Fulk, Ralphmal-Corona, Robert, Hugh, and Giroie;
Herem­ burge, Hawise, Emma, and Adelaide.
Possessing richly all that this world can give, children, riches, and ample domains, the brave knight so often men­ tioned faithfully served the Giver of all good things, and reverenced his church, and servants, and worship.
From his own funds he erected six churches to God's honour, two of which were at Verneuces, one dedicated to St. Mary, mother of God, and the other to St. Paul, doctor of the gentiles.
The third, in a vill called Glos, in the canton of Lisieux, was dedicated to St. Peter, prince of the apostles;
the fourth at Echaufour, to St. Andrew the apostle;
the fifth, which he built at Montreuil, to St. George the martyr;
and the sixth at Hautrive, to St. Martin the confessor.
With such saints as his patrons, this brave knight lived long in honour in this world, and, dying, obtained, as we trust, by the merits of their intercessions, the pardon of his sins and everlasting rest in the society of the blessed.
At the death of Giroie, his sons were of tender years, except two, Arnold and William, who had received knight­ hood under these circumstances :
Gislebert, count of Brionne, relying on his valour, and coveting an extension of his boundaries, invaded the territories of the young heirs with a formidable band, endeavouring to wrest Montreuil from them by force of arms.
However, they collected a body of their kinsmen and retainers, and, boldly offering battle to Gislebert in the open fields, defeated him with much slaugh­ ter, and put him to flight, not long afterwards forcibly seizing, by way of revenge, the burgh called Sap.1 Mean­ while, Duke Robert interfered, and compassionating the orphans, while lie praised their bravery, he induced Gisle­ bert to cede Sap to them, that the peace might be lasting.
In the end, that same count, giving uneasiness to the seven sons of Giroie, and attempting to recover the burgh of Sap, which he bad given up to them at the instance of Duke Robert, met his death through their boldness and courage, although he was attended by a large body of men.
2
All these brothers were brave and generous, skilled and active in warlike exercises, formidable to their enemies, gentle and courteous to their associates.
They prospered in various ways;
but, notwithstanding, such is human life, they fell to decay at last.
It would be too long and impossible for me to relate distinctly the acts of all the brothers;
but I am desirous, at least to leave something on record for pos- terity as to the end of each.
Arnold, the eldest, a brave and honourable man, while one day amusing himself with sports at Montreuil, in wrestling with a powerful young man, fell against the sharp angle of a bank, and breaking three of his ribs, died on the third day afterwards.
William, the second in order of birth, lived for many years, and all his life governed his brothers;
for he was eloquent and gay, liberal and brave, beloved by his inferiors, and the terror of his enemies.
None of his neighbours ventured to make inroads on his territories in any shape, nor to subject his people to any kind of exactions.
He exercised episcopal jurisdiction in the lands of Montreuil and Echaufour, and no archdeacon was permitted to interfere with the priests of 'those two lordships;
for it happened that when his father Giroie suc­ ceeded to the domains of Heugon, as before related, he inquired of the inhabitants of the district in what bishopric it was situated.
They replied that they belonged to no bishop­ ric ;
upon which he exclaimed:
" This is quite wrong;
far be it from me to live without a pastor, and exempt from the yoke of ecclesiastical discipline."
Upon further inquiry, which of the neighbouring bishops was most devoted to his religious duties, being informed of the virtues of Roger, bishop of Lisieux, he placed all his territories under his jurisdiction, persuading Baldric de Bauquencei and his sons­ in-law Wascelin d'Echanfré and Roger de Merlerault, who enjoyed a similar exemption, to place their domains, in like manner, under the same bishop.
Roger, bishop of Lisieux, observing that these nobles made a voluntary surrender of their immunities, complimented them on their devotion, and granted them the privilege that the clergy on their estates should not be impleaded out of their lords' jurisdiction, and should be exempt from the oppressions of the archdeacon's visitations.
This privilege was strictly maintained by William de Giroie, who obtained the same exemption for the monks of St. Evroult from Bishop Hugh.
1William de Giroie married Hiltrude daughter of Fulbert de Beine, who had built the castle of L'aigle in the time of Duke Richard.
By her he had a son named Arnold d'Echaufour ;
and afterwards marrying Emma, daughter of Walchelin de Tannei, who bore him William, called afterwards in Apulia the ,Good Norman.
The knight of whom we have repeatedly spoken was much beloved by Richard and Robert dukes of Normandy, for the fidelity which he maintained towards his liege lords Robert de Belesme, Talvas and Geoffrey, and others, either his [feudal] superiors or allies.
In so doing he was sub­ jected to constant molestation and even danger.
He even voluntarily razed his own castle of Montacute1 to effect the redemption of his Lord Geoffrey de Mayenne, when he was taken prisoner by William Talvas, and his liberation was refused on any other terms than the demolition of that castle which overawed the territories of Talvas.
The release of Geoffrey from captivity having been thus obtained, he built the castle of St. Ceneri on the Sarthe, for the baron Giroie, in return for the devoted fidelity he had shown.
I could say much more of this William de Giroie, but with so much before me I must pass on to other affairs;
and I will now, as I promised, give a short account of his brothers.
Fulk, the third, had one moiety of the fief of Montreuil.
He had two sons by a concubine, Giroie and Fulk.
After the death of Duke Robert he was killed, along with his countryman Count Gislebert, with whom he served.
Robert [the fourth brother] held the castle of St. Ceneri with the adjacent territory for a long course of years.
Duke William gave him his cousin Adelaide in marriage, and he had by her a son also named Robert, who now serves in the army of Henry king of England.
After many brilliant achieve­ ments, when there were violent disputes between the Nor­ mans and Anjevins, this Robert, lord of St. Generic held the castle against Duke William, and while besieged in it, in the twenty-fifth year of William's dukedom, died five days after eating a poisoned apple which he bad snatched out of the bands of his wife.
Ralph, the fifth brother, was surnamed the Clerk, on account of his knowledge of letters and skill in other arts.
He was also called Mala-corona, because in his youth he gave himself up to military exercises and other frivolities.
He was versed in medicine, and in many deep secrets of nature, so that old men even now speak of him with wonder to their children and grand-children.
In the course of time, he retired from the seductions of the world to the convent of Marmoutier, where he became a monk under the abbot Albert, and devoutly prayed to God that his body might be overspread with the loathsome disease of leprosy, that so his soul might be cleansed from the foulness of his sins.
Ob­ taining his pious wish, he died happily six years after his conversion.
Hugh, the sixth brother, was unfortunately slain in the flower of his youth;
for while he was returning one day from the castle of St. Scholasse, accompanied by his brothers and a large retinue, lie stopped near the church of St. Ger­ manus, on the lands of Echaufour, to practise with the lance, and his own squire, hurling a spear carelessly, mortally wounded him.
Being of an amiable disposition, he pre­ sently called for the squire and said to him privately:
“ Flee with all haste, for you have severely wounded me.
God have mercy on you!
escape before my brothers are apprised of this accident, or they will certainly kill you."
The noble youth expired the same day.
Circle, the youngest of the seven brothers, while he was yet in the flower of his youth having plundered the lands of the church of Lisieux, while on his return to Montreuil was seized with a frenzy, of which he died.
Thus death, in various shapes, carried off all the sons of Giroie, without allowing one of them to live to old age.
Heremburge, the oldest of the daughters was given in marriage to Vascelin du Pont-Echanfre, and had by him two sons, William and Ralph, who afterwards were firm adherents to Robert Guiscard, duke of Calabria, in Apulia and Sicily.
Hawise, the next daughter, was married to Robert de Grand-mesnil, by whom she had three sons, Hugh, Robert, and Arnold, with the same number of daughters.
On his death she married William, son of Robert the archbishop, to whom she bore Judith, who became the wife of Roger, count of Sicily.
The third daughter of Giroie was Emma, who was given in marriage to Robert de Melerant, from which marriage sprung Ro­ dolph, and William, father of our neighbours Rodolph and Roger.
Adelaide, the fourth, married Solomon de Sable, and bore him Reginald, whose son Lisiard is now a great supporter of Henry, king of England, against the count of Anjou.
Having said enough of the family of Giroie, let us now return to the matter from which we have somewhat digressed.
In the first year of the foundation of the abbey of St. Evroult, William and Robert, sons of Giroie, and Hugh and Robert, their nephews, assembled at Ouche, with their sons, nephews, and barons.
Consulting together for the advantage of the unfinished monastery which they had begun to erect, they agreed in common that each of them should at his death bequeath his body to St.
Evroult with the whole o his substance, and that none of them should make a gift whether of tithes, or of a church or anything appertaining to a church, nor even offer it for sale, without first giving the option to the monks of St. Evroult.
This agreement was firmly ratified by the priest Fulcoin, and Osmond Basset, by Louvet and Fulk, sons of Fredenlend, Odo the Red and Richard son of Gulbert, Robert de Torp, and Giroie des Loges, with others their barons.
The founders of the monas­ terv then took account of their possessions, and granted a fair portion, according to their ability, to the church they were building.
These are the possessions which Robert and Hugh and Arnold, sons of Robert de Grand-mesnil, granted to the abbey of St. Evroult for the good of their souls.
In Norrei, the church, and all the tithes, with the priests glebe and three plough-lands, together with the vill called Soulange;
in Ouillie, all the benefice which Tezcelin the clerk held, and the tithes of the mills of that vill;
English-Ville with its monastery ;
1 the church of Villers with one yearly tenant;
in the vilI called Oth, the monastery, the priest's land, and the tithes of the mills of that vill;
and in the monastery of Guéprei, they gave that part which their father Robert held;
besides the tithe of La Bigne, and at Beaumais the third part of a mill with the tithe of the same;
and the be­ nefice of the priest Fulcuin, namely the church and tithe of Grand-mesnil, and the tithe of the mill of Olivet ;
one yearly tenant at Colleville with the tithe of the whole vill;
also the tithe of wax, and the tithe of St. Pierre d'Entremont;
moreover the church in the village called Fougi, and that portion of the tithes of Coulonces which was held by their father Robert.
Hugh gave the lands of Quilli to the afore­ said abbey, on the petition of the lords of that vill, whose tenure was allodial;
also the tithe of all his ploughs and beasts of burden, and the tithe of Mont-Chauvet, both of tolls and of corn, and the church of Louvigni with the priest's glebe.
He gave besides the land called Noyer-Mesnard;
at the place named Mesnil Bernard, one plough-land, and the fields of the vilI of La Tanaisie;
moreover the cell of Manselles with the priest's glebe;
and the tenth of the tolls of Sap;
and the farm called Mesnil Lode, and the church of Lim- beuf with the priests glebe;
together with the portion which belonged to their mother in Vieux-Mesnil.
At Neuf-March6
Hugh gave the fourth part of the monastery of St. Peter, and the tithe of one half of the tolls of the whole vill, as well as of the mills ;
and in Serifontaine the monastery and the third part of the tithe with all the firstfruits and five curtilages.
William, son of Giroie, with the consent of his sons Arnold and William, and his brothers Robert and Rodolph Mala-corona, who joined in the grant, gave to the aforesaid abbey the monastery of Echaufour and the tenth of the tolls of that vill, with the land of the priest Adelelm, and the tithe of the whole forest belonging to that vilI, both in swine and in money, and the wood for all necessary uses;
and moreover all the monasteries which were on his domain, one of which, dedicated to St. George, was built at Mont­ reuil;
two at Verneuces, one in honour of St. Mary, the other in honour of St. Paul;
two at Sap, one in honour of St. Peter, the other in honour of St. Martin.
All these he granted with the tithes and lands thereto belonging, and the tenths of all tolls, and all forest rights and other customary dues in Echaufour and Montreuil, and also in Sap.
When Theodoric had been, by the grace of God, conse­ crated abbot of the convent of St. Evroult, he bought of Arnold, son of William before-mentioned, with the consent of his uncle Robert and at the command of Count William,1 the farm of Bauquencei, as it had been held by Baldric the said count's archer, and that part of the domain of Echau­ four which is situated between le Noir-Eau and Charen­ toil, and Essart d'Henri, and the tithes of the mill of Echaufour.
Moreover, Arnold himself gave to the same abbey the lands of Haute-rive, with all that belonged thereto, with all his monasteries and glebe-lands, and the farm of Douet-Moussu.
Finally, William his brother, son of the William already mentioned, with the consent of his brother Giroie, and his cousins Circle and Fulk, granted all the monasteries he possessed, in consideration of no small sum of money paid him by the abbot of the said convent.
One of these, dedi­ cated to St. Sulpicius, was situated at Mesnil-Bernard, another at Roiville dedicated to St. Leger, another at Mon­ nai dedicated to St. Mary, with the moiety of the same Monnai in the tenure of Robert, he consenting ;
the monas­ tery also of Ternant, and one in Les Essarts dedicated to St. Peter, another at Augerons with the whole vill, and one in Bois-Herbert.
All these monasteries, with the tithes and glebe-lands, were given to the abbey of St. Evroult, as well by the said William as by the lords thereof;
viz., Roger Goulafre de-Mesnil Bernard, Herfred do Roiville, Robert de Monnai, Herfred do Ternant, William priest of Essarts, William provost of Augerons, and Roger Faitel of Bois-Hebert.
Moreover William gave to the said abbey for the redemp­ tion of the soul of his mother Emma a farm of one plough, situate at Verneuces.
He also, his brother Arnold con­ senting, gave one moiety of the mills of Verneuces, together with what he possessed there in his own right, viz., the farm of Warrin, and the wood of Landigou, and the farm of Bur­ nend in Verneuces, and two fishermen at Ternant, with two kilns and one burgess at Montreuil.
Moreover, William, son of Vauquelin de Pont-Erchanfre, gave the church of St. Mary to the said abbey, together with whatever Osbern the priest held, with the tenth of the tolls and the tithe of the mills and ploughs which he possessed or should possess there or elsewhere ;
as also all the monasteries which he pos­ sessed, or should thereafter possess, and that part of Roiville which belonged to him.
Moreover, Robert son of Heugon, with the concurrence and assent of his lords, viz., William and Robert, and their sons and nephews, sold the church of St. Martin on the rivulet called Bailleul to the monks of St. Evroult, and the glebe of the same place with another farm of eight ploughs, for which they paid no small price.
He also gave the moiety of the monastery of St. Andrew, with the priests' glebe, and the moiety of all his land in the rill.
Robert also, the son of Theodelin, gave the other moiety of the same monastery and of the whole vill.
Further, the abbot Theoderic purchased for eighteen pounds of William and Robert, sons of Robert surnamed Fresnel, the church of Our Lady of the Wood,1 as it was held by a certain monk of the name of Placidus.
Moreover, Hubert de Anceins sold to the abbot the church of that vilI, and some acres of land.
All these belonging to the lord­ ship of William Fitz-Osbern the steward, were granted by him.
Next,
Robert son of Giroie, ratifying and confirming all that his brothers and nephews with their allies had given to the abbey of St. Evroult, gave also to the same, of his own possessions, St. Ceneri, St. Peter de In, Pote-des-nids, with all the tithes belonging thereto, and one half of the wood of St. Ceneri, with fishings in the Sarthe for the use of the monks who lived there, and St. Mary of Mount Grande­ lain, and the whole tithes of Siral, and of all the lands which he should thereafter acquire.
Then also, Ralph, son of Godfrey, his man-at-arms, gave with his consent the church of Radon to the same abbey.
Hearing of these benefactions, a good knight named Wadon de Dreux made a gift of the church of St. Michael on the Arve, in the canton of Evreux, with the consent of the lords under whom he held it, and his sons, kindred, and friends.
These were the benefactions with which William and Robert and others their kinsmen, endowed the abbey of St. Evroult, and, making a charter of them, presented it to William duke of Nomandy for his confirmation.
The duke gave a favourable reception to their petition, and graciously ratified their donations to the before-mentioned abbey.
He also granted this special privilege to the abbey of St. Evroult, that it should be for ever exempt from all foreign jurisdiction.
With respect also to the election of the abbots, he vested it entirely in the chapter of the brethren, subject to the rules of regular discipline, but on condition that the votes were not corruptly obtained, either by favouritism, or relationship, or certainly not by bribery.
At the end of the charter the duke had this clause inserted, ratifying the whole in the following words :
"
I, William, count of Nor­ mandy, have caused this deed of gift to be put in writing, and have had it confirmed, under pain of excommunication by the signatures of the archbishop of Rouen, and the bishops, abbots, and nobles, whose names and marks are hereunto subscribed, in order that its provisions may remain firm and undisturbed henceforth and for ever;
so that if any one shall presume to infringe them or shall in any wise injure them, either by himself or any other, he shall, by the au­ thority of God and all the saints, be excommunicated from all Christian privileges, and, if he do not repent, be ac­ cursed for ever."
Duke William subscribed this charter with the sign of the cross ;
and it was afterwards signed by Manger archbishop of Rouen, son of Richard Gonnorides, duke of Normandy;
by Hugh, bishop of Lisieux, son of William, count d'Eu;
by Odo, bishop of Bayeux, uterine brother of Duke William;
by William, bishop of Evreux, son of Gerard Fleitel;
Gislebert, abbot of Chatillon;
William, Robert, and Ralph, sons of Circle;
by their nephews Hugh de Grand-mesnil, Robert and Arnold;
by William, son of Vascelin;
by Ralph de Toni;
by Ralph Taison;
by Roger de Montgomery;
by William Fitz- Osbern ;
by Richard de Beaufour, Richard de St. Scholasse;
and many others of the Norman nobles, who were as­ sembled in the forest of Lions at the duke's palace on the river Lieure,1 before the church of St. Denys, and confirmed the charter of the abbey of St. Evroult, in the year of our Lord 1050, the fourth indiction.
The same year Robert de Grand-mesnil put off the secular habit, and submitted to the monastic rule under abbot Theodoric at St. Evroult.
We have already mentioned that he was the SOIl of Robert de Grand-mesnil, a powerful baron by Hawise the daughter of Giroie.
In his childhood he applied himself diligently to letters, and was distinguished among those of his own age for his retentive memory.
But from his earliest youth he began to despise the inaction of learning, and sought with eagerness the toils of arms, becoming for five years an esquire of Duke William.
He was then raised by the same duke to the honours of chivalry;
and having been knighted, received at the duke's hands noble rewards.
Reflecting however on the chances of life, he chose rather to serve humbly in the Lord's house than to flourish like grass in the courts of the wicked.
For he recollected the perils of worldly warfare, which had been experienced by his father and a host of others, who attack­ ing their enemies fell into the snares which they had laid for others and perished.
Thus lis father Robert joined with Roger de Toni in battle against Roger de Beaumont, in which fight Roger de Toni, with his two sons Elbert and Elinance were slain outright, and Robert received a mortal wound in his bowels.
Being carried off the field he survived three weeks, and divided his lands between his sons Hugh and Robert.
Dying on the 14th of the calends of July [18th of June], he was interred without the church of St. Mary at Norrei.
1
This calamity roused his son Robert to strive in a better warfare.
His first intention was to found a convent at Norrei, as it has been already stated, for the good of his soul and those of his ancestors, and to endow it liberally with the whole of his patrimony, if his brother Hugh consented.
But his plans being changed, by the advice of his uncle William Giroie, he made the general deed of gift, jointly with his brother Hugh of the possessions already enumerated, and coming to St. Evroult there solemnly professed himself a monk according to the rule of St. Benedict.
He suffered much inconvenience in supplying the necessities of the church, and often laid hands on the substance of his kinsfolk, who were very wealthy, charitably distributing it in the support of the faithful, for the salvation of their souls.
Paying his mother Hawise forty livres of Rouen, he deprived her of her dowry, con­ sisting of lands in Noyer-Menard, Vieux-Mesnil, La Tanaisie, and Mesnil-Dode, which he transferred to the abbey of St. Evroult.
He also presented to the monks of St. Evroult as his mother's gift, the great psaltery illuminated with pictures, which the choir frequently uses to the present time in chanting the praises of God.
This volume was given by Emma, wife of Ethelred king of England, to Robert, archbishop of Rouen, her brother, and William who was son of that prelate had secretly abstracted it from his fathers chamber and given to his wife Hawise to whom he was so much attached, that he sought every means of pleasing her.
This Robert de Grand-mesnil conferred many other benefits on his church, and rendered himself very agreeable to his brethren both by the ecclesiastical orna­ ments he furnished, and by the necessary comforts he procured for them.
TIlE venerable abbot Theodoric zealously enforced the monastic rule, and studied, both in his words and actions the profit of the community entrusted to his charge.
He was a Norman by birth, of the district of Talon;
he was of middle stature, his face ruddy, and his voice agreeable ;
well versed in the sacred scriptures, and engaged in the duties of divine worship from childhood to old age.
But as tares spring up unexpectedly among the wheat and are roofed out by the careful husbandman at the time of harvest, and delivered to the destroying flames, so sons of Belial are mingled in the company of the faithful, until at the time predestined, they are detected by the righteous Judge, and strictly subjected to the punishment they deserve.
In the time of abbot Theodoric there was a monk in the society of Evroult named Romanus, who was instigated by the devil to to steal the linen, and breeches, and other articles of that nature;
and when he was repeatedly called to account by father Theodoric for such misdeeds, he stoutly denied being guilty of the theft, though he soon after confessed it.
One night, however, while he was in bed he was seized by the demon and grievously tormented.
The monks heard his hor­ rible shrieks, and, coming to him and shaking him, sprinkled him with holy water, and with difficulty released him from the evil spirit which tormented him.
Being come to himself, the monk understood that the devil bad obtained this power over him on account of the thefts he had committed, and made promises of keeping himself for the future from such offences.
But afterwards he returned like a dog to his vomit, so that father Theodoric ordered his cowl to be stripped off, and turned him out of the convent.
Thus expelled from the society of the brethren, it is reported that he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but what was his future lot we are wholly uninformed.
A certain priest whose name was Ansered, who lived in the commune of Sap led a very irregular life.
But while suffering from disease he entreated the monks of St. Evroult to give him the habit of St. Benedict.
Wrapped in this he was carried to the abbey and sent to the infirmary.
But as soon as he recovered from his sickness, he resumed as nearly as possible the same irregularity of conduct which he had exhibited under the secular dress, so true it is as a wise writer says;
­ " No change of clime can bring an altered mind.”
1This mail changed, indeed, his habit, but not his habitual conduct.
The abbot Theodoric observed his reprehensible life and conversation, and heard that he detested the religious rule;
for he had sent word to his father and mother that he was slandered, and entreated them to remove him from the monastery.
The abbot therefore, acting in this case on the apostolic precept, " Put away from among yourselves the wicked person;
" and that which saith:
"If an unbelieving brother depart, let him depart,”2 permitted him to retire from the abbey and enter again into the world.
The man, adding sin to sin, kept company with a woman of light chraacter:
and not satisfied with her, made love to another whose name was Pomula.
He made an appoint­ ment with her that they should go together to the shrine of St. Giles, hoping to keep the affair from coming to the knowledge of his parents and friends.
Having fixed with her a place of meeting from which they should proceed in company, he himself set forth with some pilgrims who were going to the church of St. Giles.
The woman, however, without informing Ansered, broke her engagement and formed a connection with another clerk.
Ansered, arriving at the appointed place of meeting, and not finding the woman there, said to his fellow pilgrims :
"I must return home, having forgotten something for which I have occasion ;
but you need not lose any time on the road, for I shall soon overtake you."
Retracing, then, his steps, and getting into the house in which the woman lived, by night, he found her in bed with the clerk.
She signified to her lover that Ansered was there, upon which the clerk snatched up an axe, and striking Ansered on the head killed him on the spot.
He then enclosed the body in a sack, and drag­ ging it to a distance concealed it from sight in a hole in the ground.
Sometime afterwards the body was found, for the wild beasts had disinterred it, devouring a leg and a thigh, and the discovery was made by the offensive smell.
Indeed it was so pestiferous that no one could go near the spot.
His father and mother, who were attached to him more than to any others, took up the remains and buried them outside the cemetery of the church.
Such was the end of one who preferred returning to the vanities of the world, to spend­ ing his days with the servants of God in the religious life which would lead him upwards to the heavenly kingdom.
Another priest, whose name was Adelard, having assumed the monastic habit in consequence of his infirmities, gave to God and St. Evroult and his monks the church of Sap, with the tithes, of which he was enfeoffed, to be held by them in perpetuity.
But having recovered his health, he repented of what he had done, and was bent on returning to the world.
Abbot Theodoric, upon hearing this, caused the rule of St. Benedict to be read to him, and then thus addressed him :
"You have heard the rule under which you have engaged to serve, if you can keep it, continue with us, but if you cannot, depart free ;
” for he would not detain any such against their will.
Whereupon, Adelard, obsti­ nately persisting in his evil design, withdrew himself from the monastery, and resumed the secular habit which he had relinquished ;
but when he sought to recover the church of Sap which he bad made over to the monks of St. Evroult, Hugh de Grantmesnil, to whom the lordship of Sap be­ longed, would not consent.
He therefore retired among his relations at Friardel, for he was of a good family, and lived there nearly fifteen years.
But lie was never restored to good health, being afflicted with incessant infirmities.
At last, perceiving that his end was approaching, and alarmed at the punishment which awaited his apostacy, he entreated abbot Mainer, who was the fourth in succes­ sion from the venerable Theodoric, that he might be allowed to resume the monastic habit which be had forfeited for his sins.
But he died three weeks after his request was granted, being in such a state of weakness that he could not dispense with female attendance, so that he never returned alive to the monastery from winch he had withdrawn.
In the time of William, duke of Normandy, Ivo, son of William de Belesme, held the bishopric of Séez,1 and, on the death of his brothers Warin, Robert, and William, inherited the town of Belesme as his father's heir.
The bishop was handsome in person, learned, wise, and eloquent;
witty, and of a most cheerful temper.
He treated his clergy and the monks with parental kindness, and held Abbot Theodoric in great reverence, as among the chief of his friends.
They had much private intercourse, for the city of Seez is only seven leagues from the abbey of St. Evroult.
2 Roger de Montgomery, Viscount d'Exmes, had married Mabel, the bishop's niece, with whom he acquired a large portion of the domains of William de Belesme.
This Roger, at the sug­ gestion and by the advice of the bishop, transferred the church of St. Martin at Séez to Theodoric, abbot of St. Evroult, and, in conjunction with his wife, earnestly begged that he would erect a monastery in that place.
The bishop without delay commenced the work assigned to him, in the Lord's name, and settled at Séez Roger, a monk of St. Evroult, in priests orders, together with Morin and Engel­ bert, and others of his disciples, while he often repaired thither himself, remaining sometimes four or five weeks at a time, urging the prosecution of the work for the love of God and the good of posterity.
3
Now, this Mabel was both powerful and politic, shrewd and fluent, but extremely cruel.
Still she had a high regard for the excellent Theodoric, and in some things submitted to his admonitions, although in general she was severe with men of religion.
In conse­ quence, her son Roger, whose cruelties to his wretched dependants has made him notorious in the times in which I live, was brought to Roger and the rest of the monks settled at Seez, to receive from them the holy sacrament of baptism.
True grace makes those in whose hearts it rules the delight of the good and the terror of evil-doers.
Thus Abbot Theodoric was deservedly beloved by all good men, while he was feared by the wicked.
As far as possible avoiding worldly cares, he devoted himself with earnest zeal to the worship of God.
But, though diligent in the offices of prayer, he did not neglect such manual labours as were fitting his station.
He was a skilful scribe, and he left to the young monks of St. Evroult some splendid specimens of his calligraphy.
The book of Collects, the Gradual, and Anti­ phonary, were all written in the convent with his own hand.
He procured also, by gentle solicitations, from his colleagues who accompanied him from Jumieges, several precious books of the divine law.
Thus, his nephew Rodolf transcribed the Heptateuch,1 and the missal from which the mass was sung daily in the choir;
Hugh, his companion, made a copy of the commentary on Ezekiel, and the Decalogue, and the first part of the moral books;
and Roger the priest, of the Paralipomena, the books of Solo­ mon, and the third part of the moral books.
The worthy abbot, so often named, by these scribes and other antiquaries whom he succeeded in engaging in this work, during the eight years he governed the convent of St. Evroult, was able to procure for the library of the abbey all the books of the Old and New Testament, with the entire works of the eloquent Pope Gregory.
From the same school proceeded some learned and excellent penmen, such as Berenger, who was afterwards made bishop of Venusa, Goscelin and Rodolph, Bernard, Turketil, and Richard, with many more, who filled the.
library at St. Evroult with the works of St. Jerome and St. Augustine, St. Ambrose and Isidore, Euscbius and Orosius, and other doctors of the church,1 while, by their useful labours and example they encouraged the youths who were to succeed them in similar pursuits.
These novices the man of God himself instructed, often admonishing them carefully to shun the idleness of an unstable disposition, which is apt to enervate both mind and body ;
and addressing them in such words as these:
"One of the brethren in a certain convent was guilty of repeated transgressions of the monastic rule, but he was a good scribe, and so applied himself to writing that he copied of his own accord a bulky volume of the holy scriptures.
2
After his death, his soul was brought before the tribunal of the righteous Judge.
There the evil spirits sharply accused him, laying to his charge his innumerable offences;
the holy angels, on the other hand, produced the volume which the brother bad transcribed in the sanctuary of the Lord, counting letter for letter of the enormous volume against the several sins which the monk bad committed.
At last the letters had a majority of only one, against which all the devices of the devils failed to discover an equivalent failing.
The mercy of the Judge was, therefore, extended to the sin­ ful brother, and his soul was permitted to return to the body, in order that he might enjoy an opportunity of amending his life.
Reflect frequently, my dearly beloved brethren, on this example, and cleanse your hearts from vain and sinful desires, offering continually the works of your hands as an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord your God.
Shun sloth, that deadly poison, with the utmost care, for what saith one holy father Benedict?—‘ Sloth is the mortal enemy of the soul.’
Ponder often, also, on what is said by a doctor of eminence in his Lives of the Fathers:
that only a single evil spirit vexes with his wiles the monk who is laboriously occupied, while a thousand devils infest the idler, and provoke him by the keen impulse of manifold temptations, on every side, to loath the restraints of the cloister, and to hanker after the soul-destroying vanities of the world, and indulgence in fatal delights.
You, indeed, have not the means of feeding the poor with your alms, being possessed of no worldly substance;
nor can you build noble churches, like the kings and great men of the world, confined, as you are to the cloister, and deprived of all power and influence;
at least, then, bear in mind the exhort­ ation of Solomon, and guard unceasingly the avenues to your hearts, striving earnestly to please God without ceasing.
Pray, read, chant, write;
and be instant in other occupations of the like kind, thus prudently arming your­ selves against the temptations of evil spirits.
"By such admonitions, Father Theodoric instructed his disciples, diligently stirring them up by argument, by entreaty, and by rebuke, to those good works of which he he himself set them the example, not only in the oflices of devotion, but by writing and other useful occupations.
For these he was hated by some of the monks, who preferred secular concerns to their religious duties.
Alas !
they cen­ sured him for that which merited the highest respect;
while they muttered:
“This man is not fit to be an abbot, for he undervalues and neglects all worldly thrift.
But how are the men of prayer to subsist, if the men of the plough are not forthcoming ?1
He must be a fool who is more anxious about reading and writing in his monastery than about the means of procuring subsistence for the brethren."
Some of the monks indulged insolent talk of this description, wronging the man of God with more of the same sort;
but William, the son of Giroie, constantly paid him deep reve­ rence for his sanctity, and checked the ebullitions of the malcontents, whom I forbear to name, with great severity, affording hint ready aid in all contentions which arose, both within and without the monastery.
However, after some time, this noble soldier resolved on a journey to Apulia, upon business in which the welfare of the abbey of St. Evroult was concerned;
and during his absence, which was much prolonged, the holy father Theodoric was left alone and forlorn in Normandy.
The conduct of wicked men is no less repugnant to the good, than theirs is to men of corrupt minds ;
so that as good men, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, use all the means in their power to bring the wicked into the way of righteous­ ness ;
so these, actuated by the malignant influence of the devil, often strive zealously to turn the righteous into the paths of wickedness.
They may not, perhaps, succeed in ruining them utterly, but they are sometimes able to per­ plex them in various ways, and cause them to be sluggish in their sacred calling.
In this manner, while the abbey of Evroult was rising, and, enriched by good works, was becoming glorious both in the sight of God and man, some flagitious persons fomented various grudges against the society, causing infinite trouble in what concerned the sub­ sistence, and the clothing, and the sacred entertainments1 of the monks.
But although tempestuous waves threatened to overwhelm the ship of the church, Christ, her true spouse, graciously manifested the brightness of his presence to succour his servants and confound the machinations of their enemies.
I propose in this place to give a true account of what happened to Mabel, daughter of William Talvas, though it is somewhat out of order.
This lady caused many troubles, iniquitously contrived, to the monks of St. Evroult, on account of the hatred she bore to the founders of the abbey, notwithstanding that the monastic rule was strictly observed from the beginning, and the offices of charity were duly performed to all comers, as the custom is to this day.
For she, as well as her father and all her kindred, fostered a never-ceasing animosity against the family of Giroie.
But as her husband Roger de Montgomery loved and honoured, the monks, she did not venture to exhibit any open signs of her malicious feeling.
She therefore made the abbey her frequent resort, attended by numerous bands of armed retainers, under pretence of claiming the hospitality of the monks,1 but to their great oppression in the indigence to which they were subjected by the barrenness of their lands.
At one time, when she had taken up her abode at the abbey with a hundred men-at-arms, and was questioned by abbot Theodoric why she came with such a splendid retinue to the abode of poor anchorites, and was warned to abstain from such absurdity, she exclaimed, in great wrath:
" When I come again, my followers shall be still more numerous.”
The abbot replied:
" Trust me ;
unless you repent of this iniquity you will suffer what will be very painful to you."
And so it happened:
for the very night following she was attacked by a disorder which caused her great suffering.
Upon this, she gave instant orders for being carried forth from the abbey, and, hastening in a state of alarm to By from the territory of St. Evroult, she passed by the dwelling of a certain farmer named Roger Suisnar, whose infant child she caused to suck her nipple, which occasioned her the severest pain.
The infant died soon afterwards, while Mabel reached her home restored to health.
She lived fifteen years after­ wards, but never ventured to return to St. Evroult, after having there suffered under the chastisement of God;
and from thenceforth she was very careful not to meddle, either for good or evil, with the occupants of the abbey, so long as she enjoyed the checquered delights of the present life.
Notwithstanding, she had a great regard for abbot Theodoric, and confided to him much more than to the convent of St. Evroult, the cell of St. Martin, as I have already remarked in anticipation.[A.D. 1016—1030.]

While Pope Benedict filled the apostolic see, the Saracens of Africa made an annual descent with their galleys on the coast of ApnEa, levying with impunity whatever contributions they pleased from the degenerate Lombards, of the Apulian cities, and the Greek colonies in Calabria.
In those days, Osmond surnamed Drengot, hearing William Repostel insolently boast, in the presence of the Norman nobles, of having dishonoured his daughter, slew him in the presence of Robert the duke, in a wood where they were hunting.
For this crime he was forced to make his escape with his sons and nephews, first into Brittany, afterwards into England, and at length, to Beneventum.
He was the first Norman who established himself in Apulia, having obtained from the prince of Beneventum the grant of a, town as a settlement for himself and his heirs.
Afterwards, a Norman knight who had gone on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with a hundred men-at-arms, was hospitably entertained with his followers, on their return, by the Duke Waimalch, who humanely kept them several days, in order that they might refresh themselves.
While they were there twenty thousand Saracens made a descent on the coast of Italy, and demanded, with great threats, tribute from the inhabitants of Salernum.
While the duke and his guards were gathering the tribute from the citizens, the pirates disembarked from their fleet, and began to prepare their meal in full security, and with great delight, on a grassy plain lying between the city and the sea-shore.
The Normans, witnessing this, and finding that the duke was collecting money to pacify the infidels, gently rebuked the Apulians for thus ransoming themselves like defenceless women, instead of defending themselves, sword in hand, like brave men.
They then flew to arms, and, making a sudden attack on the Africans who were waiting for the tribute in perfect security, many thousand of them were slain on the spot, and the rest were driven with disgrace to the refuge of their ships.
The Normans returning, laden with gold and silver plate and other valuable booty, were much pressed by the duke to remain in honour at Salernum ;
but as they were anxious to re-visit their own country, they declined to accept his proposal.
Some of them, however, promised to return, or speedily to send to the duke a chosen band of Norman youths.
When, therefore, they had reached their native land, they had much to tell their countrymen of all that they had seen, and heard, and done, and suffered.
In the end, some of them, fulfilling their engagement, retraced their steps to Italy, and by their example induced a number of their light-hearted countrymen to join in their enterprize.
In short, Turstin surnamed Citel, and Ranulph;
Richard, son of Ansquetil de Quarrel,1 the sons of Tancred de Hauteville, viz.
Drogo and Humphrey;
William and Herman;
Robert surnamed Guiscard, and Roger with their six brothers ;
William de Montreuil, Arnold de Grant-mesnil, and many others, left Normandy and reached Apulia, not all together, but at different times.
On their arrival, they in the first instance took service, as mercenaries against the infidels under the Duke Waimalch and other nobles.
After­ wards, however, disputes arising, they attacked those to whom they were previously subject, and by force of arms reduced Salernum, Bari, and Capua, with the whole of Campania and Calabria, under their own dominion.
They also gained possession, in Sicily, of Palermo, Catania, Castel- Giovanni, and other cities and fine towns which are held by their heirs to the present day.
Among the Normans who crossed the Tiber, no one distinguished himself more than William de Montreuil, son of William Giroie, and, being appointed to the chief command of the Roman troops, he carried the banner of St. Peter to the conquest of the fertile plains of Campania.
Being a friend and brother of the monks of St. Evroult, to whom he made large grants, as already mentioned, before he left Normandy, he sent to desire them to despatch a trusty messenger, by whom he might forward the presents be had prepared for them.
His father William being informed of this, voluntarily offered to undertake the mission for the good of holy church.
Abbot Theodoric heard the proposal with mingled joy and grief;
joy, at the devotion which inflamed the heart of his friend, and induced him, old as he was, to undertake so toilsome a journey;
grief, at losing the society of one who was ready at all good works.
At length, the holy father and Robert the prior, with the whole chapter, commended the Lord William to God's protection, selecting for his companions Humphrey, a most intelligent monk, and Roger of Jumièges, a skilful penman, with twelve other honourable attendants.
Crossing the Alps he travelled to Rome, and thence pursued his journey to ApnEa, where he found his son and other friends, kinsfolk, and relations.
His arrival caused them all the greatest joy, and, prevailing on him to remain with them a considerable time, during which he was entertained with the highest distinction, they committed to his charge many magnificent presents for the support of the abbey for which he was a suitor.
Wishing however to send relief to the poor brethren without delay, be sent back the monk Humphrey, with a considerable sum of money;
but, by the mysterious decrees of God's providence, this enterprize turned out otherwise than he had hoped;
for Humphrey, having got as far as Rome, determined to winter there, in the monastery of St. Paul the apostle.
But he was poisoned by the Romans for the sake of the gold he had in his possession, and so the venerable pilgrim died in the confession of the faith of Christ, on the ides [13th] of December.
Shortly afterwards William himself took his departure for Normandy, conveying a large sum of money, but when he reached Gaieta, so called from the nurse of Æneas the Trojan, he was seized with a mortal disease.
Thereupon he summoned to his side the two knights, Ansquetil du Noyer, son of Ascelin, and Theodelin de Tanie, and thus addressed them:
" You know that your twelve companions who came out of Normandy together in full health, all but you are dead;
I also am attacked by a severe disease which is fast hurrying me to the grave.
I therefore commend to your custody Ansquetil, in the pre­ sence of Theodelin as witness, the money of which I am the bearer, in order that you may honestly carry it to the lord abbot Theodoric, and my nephew Robert, and the other monks of St. Evroult, for whom I am now in a foreign land.
Ye are both liege-men of the abbey, and are bound to do it faithful service.
Let no love of lucre lead you astray.
Reflect well that all your comrades having perished, you only survive, through the merits of the blessed Evroult, in order perhaps that you may faithfully render him this service.
Bear my last farewell to the monks at St. Evroult, whom I love in Christ as my own life, and earnestly entreat them to supplicate Almighty God on my behalf with zealous fervour."
With this and such-like discourse he brought forth the gold, and rich palls, with a silver chalice, and other articles of great price, and, making an exact inventory of them delivered them to Ansquetil.
Not long afterwards, his sickness prevailing to extremity, the noble knight departed in the faith of Christ, on the nones [5th] of February, and received honourable interment in the church of St. Erasmus, bishop and martyr,1 which is an episcopal see.
Ansquetil and Theodoliu then pursued their journey into France, and arrived safely at home.
Some days afterwards Ansquetil went to St. Evroult and announced to the brethren the death of the lord William and his companions, but observed total silence as to the money with which he had been entrusted and had already dishonestly converted to his own use.
On hearing the death of the founder of their abbey the monks were in great tribulation, and zealously offered prayers, and masses, and other sacred offices on behalf of his soul to God, in whom all things live;
which are diligently continued by their successors to the present day.
When Ansquetil had returned home, his comrade Théodelin came to St. Evroult and inquired of the monks what had been brought to them from Apulia, and was astonished to find that they had received nothing but the sorrowful tidings of the death of their friends.
He therefore related to them the whole truth, describing all that bad occurred, both in prosperous and adverse circumstances during their peregri­ nations.
Upon this, Abbot Theodoric sent for Ansquetil, and demanded from him the money committed to his charge.
At first he denied having received it, but, being confronted with Theodelin, he admitted the truth :
"I did receive," he said, " the money you demand from my lord William ;
part of it I have applied to my own use, and the rest I deposited at Rheiims, by the advice of my lord Rodolph Mala-Corona, who met me there."
On hearing this the monks despatched him twice to Rheins to Gervase the archbishop,1 to recover the money deposited, once in company with Reginald of Sap, one of the monks, and again with Fulk.
The monk was received with great kindness by the metropolitan, who assisted him, as far as it was in his power, in the object of his journey.
For while he was bishop of Mans, often repairing to the court of William, duke of Normandy, with whom he was intimate, the monks of St. Evroult used to give him honourable entertainment with all his attendants.
On seeing therefore the monk Fulk, he was anxious to return kindness for kindness.
But as a long time had elapsed, and Ansquetil had carelessly deposited the things for which Fulk made inquiries, he was only able to recover a few of the least valuable of all the articles which were sent from Apulia;
with difficulty obtaining the silver chalice, two chasubles, an elephant's tooth, a griffin's claw, and some others.
The monks, taking into consideration the fraudulent conduct of Ansquetil, summoned him to trial in their court at St. Evroult, where Richard d'Ayranches, son of Turstin, and many other barons appeared to support him.
But, on the just complaints of the monks, judgment was fairlv pronounced against him of forfeiture of the whole of the fief he held of the abbey.
In the end, by the mediation of friends on both sides, this agreement was made:
Ansquetil openly confessing his guilt, gave pledges to abbot Theodoric for his future good conduct, and humbly supplicated pardon from the monks ;
and, as a compensation for the loss which he had caused them by his default, he surrendered to the abbey of St. Evroult, in the presence of many witnesses, the third part of the burgh of Ouche, which he possessed as heir to his father.
In token of this, he offered on the altar of St. Evroult one mantle of silk, of which a cope was made for the chanter.
The monks, thereupon, satisfied by his penitence, pardoned his offences, and kindly restored to him all the rest of his fief, except the part which he had surrendered by the advice of his friends.
Not long afterwards Ansquetil went into Apulia, where he was slain.
The old enemy never fails to disturb the peace of the church by the incentives of manifold temptations, bringing those with whom he is able to prevail into subjection to worldly vanities, and grievously afflicting those who by pru­ dent watchfulness in the simplicity of the Catholic faith stand manfully upright in the perfection of their Christian virtues.
When therefore he saw a regular monastery rising by God's help, in the forest of Ouche, and that abbot Theodoric was by word and deed profiting the souls both of young and old in the neighbouring town, he burnt with the same malice which wrought the expulsion of the protoplast Adam from Paradise through the desire of the forbidden fruit, and stirred up the prior Robert, after the death of William de Giroie, to a presumptuous opposition against his abbot;
and by the dissensions thence arising for a long time dis­ quieted the minds of the subject members of the fraternity.
This Robert, as 1 have fully noticed before, was of high rank, being the brother of Hugh de Grant-mesnil;
and all the levity of his youth, indomitable resolution, ;
and worldly ambition, still clung to him.
His continence and other monastic virtues were praiseworthy;
while, on the other hand, as Horace says :
­ " Man's happiness is ne'er complete, he was reprehensible for many failings.
For whether 'nat he coveted was right or wrong, he was hasty and headstrong in gaining his ends, and was quickly irritated when anything he heard or saw offended him ;
more prone to lead than to follow, to command than to obey.
His hand was always open both to receive and to disburse, and his month to give ready vent to his wrath in violent ebullitions.
Illustrious by the high lineage already mentioned, and being one of the founders of the abbey in which he had collected from all parts brothers whose duty was to perform divine worship, and having amply endowed them with all things necessary for their subsistence, he found himself' unable to submit to the strict rules of a monastic life in the new establishment.
He therefore frequently complained in private to his spiritual father, that the holy man was more occupied with his religious duties than with secular concerns.
He even sometimes opposed him openly, and found fault with some of his acts simply relating to exterior objects.
So that the man of God often took refuge in his quiet retreat at Seez, abiding there six or eight weeks, doing God's work in peace and zealously promoting the salvation of men by all the means in his power.
He thus waited for the improvement of his refractory brother, fulfilling the apostle's admonition :
" Give place unto wrath."
1 Finding, however, that the rancour and the scandals did not cease, but rather increased, to the great injury of the brethren, he tendered his pastoral staff to William the duke of Normandy, offering to resign his rank and office of abbot.
The duke thereupon, taking judicious counsel, committed the whole matter to the decision of Mauritius, archbishop of Rouen, enjoining him to inquire diligently into the causes of the dissension, and to make such order thereon as, by the advice of prudent counsellors, he should think right.
In the year of our Lord 1056, the eighth indiction, when Pope Victor filled the apostolic see, Henry, surnamed the Good, emperor of the Romans, and son of Conon [Conrad] departed this life, and was succeeded by his son Henry, who reigned fifty years.
2
The same year, Maurilius the arch­ bishop, and Fulbert the sophist, his chancellor, with Hugh, bishop of Lisieux, Ansfrid, abbot of Préaux and Lanfranc, prior of Bee, with several other dignitaries of sound judgment, assembled at the abbey of St. Evroult;
and celebrated the feast of the apostles St. Peter and St. Paul on the third of the calends of July [29th June].
Having inquired into and carefully considered the grounds of the dissension, it was ordered that the abbot Theodoric should continue the government of the abbey, as he had done before, and Robert the prior was admonished, in the fullest terms, to conform to his vows of poverty in Christ, and to obey his spiritual father, for the love of God, in all humility.
The commissioners having returned home, a short period of repose was enjoyed by the flock at St. Evroult;
but a year after­ wards, when the news arrived of the death of William de Circle, the smothered strife again broke out, and disputes adverse both to the spiritual and temporal welfare of the monks distracted the community.
And now Theodoric, to whom peace was dear, was in difficulties on every side.
For at Séez it was out of his power to promote the salvation of souls, and to finish the building of the cell which Roger and his wife had begun to erect, because they were then much occupied by worldly affairs, and exposed to serious attacks from their enemies in various quarters;
while at St. Evroult he could neither further his own good nor that of others, by reason of the vexations which he had to endure from some of the more influential monks.
At last, after long reflection upon the course he ought to pursue, according to the will of God, he determined to abandon all and undertake a pilgrimage to the tomb of our Lord at Jerusalem.
ON the fourth of the calends of September [August 24th], abbot Theodoric left Seez, where he had rested long, and, proceeding to St. Evroult, convoked a chapter of the monks to whom he made known his intentions, and admonishing, absolving, and blessing them all, he commended them to God.
Thence he went to Lisieux, and surrendered his cure of souls to the bishop, by whom he was much beloved;
then he commenced his holy pilgrimage for Christ amidst the tears of many of his friends.
Herbert de Montreuil, the first monk he admitted to the monastery of St. Evroult, accompanied him, as well as the clerk William, surnamed Bonne-Ame, son of Radbod bishop of Seez, who some time afterwards held the metropolitan see of Rouen for nearly twenty-six years.
In those days there existed a noble hospital on the con­ fines of the territories of the Bavarians and Huns,1 which the truly Christian and powerful barons of the neighbouring provinces had founded for the reception of the poor and pilgrims.
At that time Ansgot, a Norman, governed this hospital, having been elected by the natives.
He was a cousin of Robert de Toni, called the Spaniard, who had borne arms with distinction under Richard and Robert, dukes of Normandy ;
but inspired with the fear of God, he had relinquished all worldly advantages, and had chosen to undergo voluntary poverty during the remainder of his life for Christ's sake.
Recognizing Theodoric and his compa­ nions as countrymen, he gave them a cordial reception and entertained them for some days with great hospitality, paying them the kindest attentions.
Meanwhile, a certain religious, the chief bishop of the Bavarians, going on a pilgrimage arrived at the hospital, where he was honourably received, with all his retinue, as the custom was by the liberal Ansgot, and prevailed on to sojourn for a while.
He also earnestly recommended the venerable Theodoric and his attendants to the care of this bishop, pointing out his sanctity as a father in God, and his worldly rank in his own country.
The bishop, hearing the abbot's character, gave thanks to God, and, cordially paying the respect due to a man of his station, took him in his company as far as Antioch.
There a difference of opinion arose among the pilgrims.
Some of them wished to con­ tinue their journey by land, as they had hitherto, prosecuted it, the whole way to Jerusalem.
Others, alarmed for their safety among the fierce infidels, determined to take ship and pass into the Holy Land by sea.
In this proposal the bishop and abbot, with some others, concurred.
While, however, the bishop was engaging a ship and an able crew, and a certain religious, who was archimandrite of the con­ vent of St. Simeon in the port of Syria, 1 was hospitably entertaining Theodoric and his companions, Herbert the monk of St. Evroult was seized with the desire of hastening his journey, and preferred to continue his pilgrimage to the holy places by land rather than by sea.
His abbot accord­ ingly gave him permission to go as he pleased.
Taking, therefore, the road through the country, with a crowd of pilgrims on foot, and having reached Laodicea, he there fell sick, and was compelled to abide for some time, his com­ panions proceeding on their way.
As soon as he was able to rise from his bed, he did not take one step further in advance, but bidding farewell to the east, turned westward, and hastened back to Normandy.
The bishop, with Theodoric and William Bonne-Ame with their companions, embarked at the port of St. Simeon, and sailed to the island of Cyprus.
They found there on the sea-shore a convent founded by St. Nicholas the con­ fessor, arch bishop of Myria.
2
Entering the church, they per­ formed their devotions as each was inspired by divine grace ;
and Theodoric, on rising from his prayers, during which he had wept much, sat down exhausted in the church, for his frame was shattered by the weight of years, his sufferings at sea, and other fatigues.
The bishop, his faithful companion, inquiring of him what had happened, he replied:
" I had proposed, my father, to visit the earthly Jerusalem, but I believe that the Lord has otherwise disposed of his servant.
I am suffering great bodily anguish, and I am led to think that I must turn my face to the heavenly, instead of the earthly, Jerusalem."
The bishop made answer, " Rest here, dearest brother, while I go to procure a lodging for your reception."
The bishop leaving him for this purpose, Theodoric approached the altar, and was for some time engaged in prayer to God, whom he had faithfully served from his youth upward.
He then prostrated himself before the altar, with his face to the east, and decently gathering his robe round him, lay on his right side, as if he was composing himself for sleep, when laying his head on the marble step, and crossing his hands on his breast, he thus gave up his devout soul to God who created it, on the calends [the 1st] of August.
Meanwhile, the bishop having prepared a lodging, called the servant of the man of God, and sent him to the church to conduct his master to it.
But when he found the holy man lying dead in the church, he returned to the bishop in great alarm, and trembling, told him of the unexpected calamity.
The bishop, however, not believing that the man of God had so suddenly departed, said to him :
"
The good old man is much exhausted by his sufferings at sea, and the intense heat;
and therefore he is enjoying refreshing sleep in the coolness of the church on the cold marble.
Let us go and see him."
He then proceeded to the church, attended by his clergy.
But when he had carefully felt the body of his comrade, and found that it was really chilled in death, he was overpowered with grief.
Immediately col­ lecting all the pilgrims who, dispersed in their several lodgings, were procuring refreshments, he commanded them to assemble in the church, while he fully made known to the inhabitants of the place the character of the companion of their pilgrimage who there lay dead.
The inhabitants were filled with joy for his holy life, and freely offered their services to the other pilgrims.
The bishop, then, with his clergy, paid the last offices to the remains of the defunct, ordering the rest of the pilgrims to prepare a place for his interment before the church-door.
Having, therefore, dug a grave with their staves where the bishop directed, they returned to the pavement where the corpse lay, with the bishop standing by, to carry it forth for burial.
But it was so ordered by God that the body was so heavy, that they were utterly unable to raise it from the spot where the holy man fell asleep.
The bishop and all the spec­ tators were much astonished at this, and consulted together for some moments what was to be done.
At length the bishop, divinely inspired, said:
"This was a most holy In an, and his life, as it is now clearly manifest, was well pleasing to God.
I am, therefore, of opinion that he ought to be interred in a spot more worthy of him, and that his remains ought to be treated, with all the reve­ rential ceremony which it is in our power to bestow.
I propose, therefore, with the assistance of my clergy, to offer the holy sacrifice of the mass for the good of his soul, and you shall prepare a more fitting grave for him near the altar."
The pilgrims giving a willing consent, and the mass being performed with all reverence, and the grave carefully made, they raised the corpse without difficulty and decently interred it before the altar;
and there afterwards many persons suffering from fevers and other disorders were miraculously cured.
The monks of St. Evroult were filled with grief when they received intelligence of the death of their reverend father on the return of his fellow pilgrims to Normandy.
They did not fail of performing faithfully the due offices of religion for the repose of his soul, and his memory is yearly kept to the present day with a solemn service on the calends [1st] of August.
They also studiously adhered to the religious rules which he had learned from the venerable abbots Richard of Verdun, William of Dijon, and Theodoric of Jumièges, 1 and had faithfully transferred to the new establishment committed to his charge, which rules are still diligently taught to the novices preparing themselves for the monastic life.
IN the year of our Lord 1059, the twelfth indiction, the monks of St. Evroult elected for their abbot, Robert de Grant-mesnil, considering with reason the many advan­ tages of such a choice, arising both from his illustrious descent, his zeal for the interests of the community, and his aptitude and perseverance in business.
His election being ratified by the unanimous assent of the entire chapter, he was conducted to Evreux by a delegate of the brethren who presented him to Duke William, and, announcing the elec­ tion, petitioned the duke to confirm it.
The duke consent- ing, invested the abbot elect with the exterior jurisdiction of the convent by the crosier of Ives, bishop of Séez, and William, bishop of Evreux, committed to him the interior cure of souls in matters spiritual, by episcopal consecration on the eleventh of the calends of July [June 21st].
Robert, thus made abbot, entered diligently on the admi­ nistration of the conventual concerns, making abundant provision from the wealth of his family of all things neces­ sary for the service of God.
Far from diminishing the proper observances which his pious predecessor had insti­ tuted, be augmented them, having regard to what was timely and reasonable, and taking for his guide the authority of the ancients and the practices of neighbouring communities.
While yet a novice he had, by the permis­ sion of the venerable Theodoric, visited the abbey of Cluni, at the time that Abbot Hugo, the glory of the monastic order in our days, presided over that community.
Return­ ing some time afterwards from Cluni he brought with him, by the indulgence of the generous Hugh, an illustrious monk named Bernefrid, who was afterwards made a bishop, and obtained his assistance while he assimilated the prac­ tices of the monks of St. Evroult to the Clunian model.
During the abbacy of Robert, Mainer, SOIl of Gunscelin d'Echoufour, came to St. Evroult for his probation:
he afterwards rose to the government of the convent, which he ruled well twenty-one years and ten months.
At that time Ralph, surnamed Mala-Corona, came to St. Evroult, where he abode a long time with Abbot Robert, who was his nephew.
As I have before remarked, he was studious from his childhood, and learnt the secrets of science with signal success, in the schools of France and Italy, being deeply skilled in astronomy as well as in gram­ mar and dialectics, and also in music.
He was so complete a master of the art of medicine, that at Palermo, where the most ancient school of medicine bad long flourished, he was unrivalled except by one most skilful matron.
But although his learning was so extensive and profound, he did not abandon himself to a peaceful life, but served in the wars, and often distinguished himself among his comrades, both in council and in the field.
The natives of Montreuil still relate many things which appear to us wonderful con­ cerning his experiments in cases of disease and other accidents, such as they were witnesses of themselves, or heard from their fathers, to whom he was well known by his long residence among them.
At last, apprehending the destruction of a tottering world, and taking the precaution of a prudent retirement, he despised its luxury, and betook himself to Marmoutier, a cell dependent on the abbey of St. Martin at Tours, where for seven years he lived in sub­ mission to the monastic rule under Albert its venerable abbot.
After he bad been confirmed in that order, he came to St. Evroult, by permission of his abbot, to assist his nephew, who had lately undertaken the government of the new monastery.
This noble soldier having obtained from the Lord by earnest prayers the disease of leprosy to expiate the multitude of sins which burdened his conscience, his nephew gave him a chapel which he had built in honour of St. Evroult, where he lived for a considerable time, having the monk Goscelin for his own comfort and the service of God, and did much good by his counsels to numbers who flocked to him on account of his deep wisdom and high rank.
At his earnest request, Abbot Robert invited Hugh, bishop of Lisieux, a true father and director of the monks, who came and consecrated the chapel 1 in honour of the holy confessors St. Evroult, St. Benedict, and Leudfrid, on the second of the nones [6th] of May.
Report says that this church was founded as early as the time of St. Evroult, and that it was his custom to retire to it, to the exclusion of all worldly cares, in order that he might devote himself more earnestly to heavenly contemplations.
The site is pleasant and well suited to a hermit's life.
The little river Carenton flows through a wild valley, dividing the bishopric of Lisieux from that of Evreux.
The summit of the moun­ tain is clothed with a forest, the thick foliage of which forms a screen from the blasts of the wind;
the chapel stands on the declivity, between the wood and the rivulet, surrounded by an orchard.
A fountain bursts out before the door, which forms the source of the Ouche, from which the whole district round derives its name.
It need be no matter of wonder that the bishop of Lisieux should consecrate a chapel in the diocese of Evreux.
At that time, three prelates of distinguished liberality and great courtesy presided over adjoining dioceses.
Hugh, son of William count d'Eu, was bishop of Lisieux;
William, son of Gerard Fleitel, was spiritual ruler of the people of Evreux;
and Ives, son of William de Belesme, had the cure of souls at Seez.
These three bishops were then distin­ guished in Normandy for their zeal and unanimity, so that each of them, as time and circumstances required, adminis­ tered all divine offices on the confines of a neighbouring diocese the same as if it were his own, without any conten­ tion or jealousy.
At the instigation of the devil, who never ceases from mischief to mankind, violent hostilities broke out between the French and the Normans.
Henry, king of France, and Geoffrey Martel, the valiant count of Anjou, crossed the frontiers of Normandy with numerous forces and committed great ravages.
On the other hand, William, the brave duke of Normandy, was not slow in taking ample revenge for the injury done, taking many of the French and Angevins prisoners, putting some to death, and throwing numbers into prison, where they long suffered.
The reader who de­ sires to make himself acquainted with the particulars of the attacks and devastations, which ensued on one side or the other, will find them described in the works of William, a monk of Jumieges, surnamed Calculus, and William of Poitiers, archdeacon of Lisieux, who have written the his tory of Normandy with great care, and dedicated their works to William, then king of England, whose favour they wished to securedAt that time Robert, son of Circle, revolted against Duke William, and, uniting with the Angevins, strongly garrisoned his castles of St. Ceneri and La Roche d'Igé, holding them for some time against the attacks of the duke with Norman troops.
But all mortal strength is transitory and fades like the flower of grass, for this great soldier, after his gallant actions, while he was making merry as he sat by the hearth in winter, seeing his wife Adelaide (who was the duke's cousin) with four apples in her hand, snatched two of them in sport, unconscious of their being poisoned, and ate them in spite of all her efforts to prevent him.
The poison made rapid progress, and to the great grief of his friends, he expired five days afterwards, on the 8th of the ides [6th] of February.
On his death Arnold, SOil of William de Circle, succeeded to the command, in his nucleus place, encouraging the townsmen by his entreaties and admoni­ tions to defend to the last the inheritance of his father.
But the prudent duke disarmed his hostility with smooth words, and engaged him by his promises to consent to peace.
Arnold, by the advice of his friends, agreed to the duke's proposals, and paying his homage, was invested with the fiefs of Montreuil, Echoufour, St. Ceneri, and all the domains he inherited from his ancestors.
On the peace being settled, abbot Robert requested permission from the duke to transfer the body of his uncle, which had lain buried at St. Ceneri for three weeks, to the abbey of St. Evroult.
The duke at first refused, actuated by his recent animosity;
but being ashamed to keep alive his resentment against the dead, he presently gave his consent.
The abbot lost no time in translating the corpse of Robert de Circle to St. Evroult in a coffin of wood, and honourably buried it in the monks' cloister.
All who were present wondered that, though the body bad lain dead three weeks, no offensive smell was observed.
Some persons pretend that the virulence of the poison which killed him had dried up all the humours in the body of the deceased, so that there was nothing to offend the nostrils of the by-standers.
The monks of St. Evroult were well pleased that Arnold was restored to his lawful jurisdiction, and with his support resisted the oppressions of some troublesome persons who had taken advantage of their defenceless state.
In the time of Abbot Theodoric and Robert his successor, Baldric and Viger de Bauquencey and their people, had not only carried themselves insolently towards the monks, and were insubordinate to them as their lords, but often harassed them and their servants.
Robert, on his becoming abbot, thought it disgraceful to submit any longer to such conduct.
He therefore, having consulted the brethren, gave up the rebels to his cousin, that he might chastise with a soldiers strong hand the stubbornness of men who were too proud to submit to the gentle rule of the monks.
Arnold laid upon them the burden of many hard services, compel­ ling them and their people to guard his fortified castles of Echaufour and St. Ceneri.
Upon this they earnestly entreated abbot Robert and the monks that they would be pleased to take them again under their own rule, promising in future entire submission and better conduct.
The abbot and monks, listening to their prayers, besought Arnold to restore them to their service under the church, which to those who are humble and well disposed is truly liberal.
At this time Roger, the eldest son of Engenulf de Aquila, was slain.
Engenulf and his wife Richveride came to St. Evroult in deep grief, entreating the prayers and good offices of the monks for the good of the souls of themselves and their SOIl Roger, which were granted ;
and they there­ upon offered his best horse to God and the monks.
The horse being very valuable, Arnold begged to have it, yielding up Baldric and his people with the fief of Bauquencey to be subject to the monks as before.
This was done:
Arnold receiving the horse from his cousin Robert and restoring Baldric with the land of Bauquencey to his former tenure under the abbey.
Baldric, overjoyed at having thus escaped from the burdensome service of Arnold, granted to the monks a domain which he possessed in the vilI of St. Evroult, as also his land upon the rivulet of Douet Villars, and that of the Norman Mica and Benignus.
Then Baldric swore fealty to abbot Robert with joined hands, promising suit and service, and demanding that his fief should not again be severed from the estates of the monks.
They granted and ratified this, and both Baldric and Robert his son, from that time to the present day, have done service to none but the monks for the lands of Bauquencey.
1
The abbey of St. Evroult stands in the fief of Bauquencey, and this Baldric was a man of high birth.
For Gislebert, Count de Brionne, nephew of Richard duke of Normandy, gave his niece in marriage to Baldric the German, who came into Normandy, with Viger his brother, to take service under the duke.
From this marriage sprung six sons, besides several daughters, viz.:
Nicholas de Basqueville;
Fulk d'Aunoun;
Robert de Courcy;
Richard de Neuville, Baldric de Bauquencey;
and Viger of Apulia.
They all dis­ tinguished themselves by great valour under Duke William, from whom they received great riches and honours, and left to their heirs vast possessions in Normandy.
Baldric who, with his brother Viger, held the fief of Bauquencey, gave his sister Elizabeth in marriage to Fulk de Bonneval, a brave knight, and for her dowry the church of St. Nicholas, built by his father, with the lands adjoining.
Fulk, not forgetful of the life to come, presented to God, for the good of his soul and those of his kindred, his son Theodoric, to whom abbot Theodoric was baptismal sponsor, offering to St. Evroult the youth and the abbey of St. Nicholas of which we have just spoken.
Baldric, Viger, and William de Bonneval, readily confirmed these offerings;
they, and many others who were present, assisting as legal witnesses of the gift, for the greater security of the church.
Among them was Roger, son of Tancred de Hauteville, who afterwards went into Italy, and, by God's help, became master of a great part of Sicily, having attacked, defeated, and subdued the Africans, Sicilians, and other nations, unbelievers in Christ, who ravaged that island.
The boy Theodoric, thus separated from the world and devoted to God, lived fifty-seven years under the monastic rule, and, rising to the priesthood by regular degrees, waged his spiritual warfare with great fidelity.
At that time Guy, surnamed Bollein, great nephew of the elder Giroie, lived in high honour with his wife Hodierna in the Corbonnois, and, having gained much wealth by his military service, managed his affairs with entire credit.
He had several sons, of whom Norman and Walter served in the wars, while Godfrey and William, surnamed Gregory, being devoted to learning, obtained the office of priests.
The aforesaid Guy, by the inspiration of God, and his natural feeling for abbot Robert, who was his cousin, showed great regard for the monks of St. Evroult, and shut out from the world and from himself his son William, a boy about nine years old, whom he placed in the convent of St. Evroult, to serve God under the monastic rule, on the feast of All Saints.
Then William le Prevost, a noble knight the lad's uncle, gave to St. Evroult the church with the whole vili of Augeron, vowing himself and the whole of his substance to the same patron at the end of his life.
By the grace of God the boy William grew up in a virtuous course and was diligent in his studies, so that his superiors gave him the surname of Gregory.
Carefully nurtured in the bosom of our holy mother the church, and entirely shut out from the tumults of the world and carnal indulgences, lie made great advances in those pursuits which are so especially fitting the sons of the church, being an excellent reader and chanter, and exceedingly skilled in copying and illuminating books.
The works executed by his own hands are still very useful to us in reading and chanting, and serve for examples to deter us from idleness by the exercise of similar diligence.
Assiduous from his very childhood at the offices of devotion and vigils, and submitting with moderation even in his old age to fastings and other mace­ rations of the flesh, he was a strict observer of monastic discipline himself, and a zealous monitor of those who in­ fringed the holy rule.
He had committed to his tenacious memory the Epistles of St. Paul, the Proverbs of Solomon, and other portions of sacred scripture, which he quoted in his daily conversations for the benefit of those with whom he conferred.
Devoted to these pursuits, he has already spent fifty-four years in the order of monks, and still con­ tinues the practice of good works, in his usual manner, under abbot Roger, that by ending well he may attain to the assurance of eternal rest.
While the community at the abbey of St. Evroult was nobly augmented by the accession of forty monks, and the monastic rule was there regularly observed according to the order of the divine Lord, its fame spread far and wide, disposing numbers of persons to become attached to it.
Meanwhile, some being infected with a rancorous hatred were punished by the sharp edge of their own malice.
Abbot Robert, endowed with genuine liberality, received willingly all who came from every quarter to enter on their probation, and steadily supplied the brethren with all things necessary for their subsistance and clothing.
The revenues indeed of the abbey, which was situated in a barren district, were inadequate to supply the abbots liberality;
but, as it has been already remarked, he often went among his noble relations and obtained from them the means which he ap­ plied for the benefit of the monks with the willing consent of the donors.
The old chapel, built by St. Evroult, being a small and rude edifice, he laid the foundations, in the first year of his rule, of a new church in a noble style of architecture which he resolved to dedicate to St. Mary, mother of God, and to enrich with many altars of the saints.
On account also of the holy relics which were deposited in the old church in the time of St. Evroult (but on account of the lapse of time men now living are ignorant of their names, acts, and places of deposit), he determined to make the new building of such dimensions that it should include within its walls the whole of the ancient chapel, and thus for ever honourably contain the bones and tombs of the saints which lay hidden within.
But he was compelled to desist from his undertak­ ing by the stormy times which began to threaten, and no one among his successors ventured to carry out the work in the proportions and on the plan and site which he bad intended.
In the year of our Lord 1059, the thirteenth indiction, Henry, king of France, after a glorious and prosperous reign, demanded of John, a physician of Chartres, who from some accident was called the Deaf, a potion which should restore his health and prolong his life;
but, being very thirsty, under the influence of his inclination more than of his physician's advice, he made his chamberlain bring him water privately, while the medicine, passing through his intestines, gave him great pain, and before they were cleared by it.
Thus, drinking without the knowledge of his leech, he died, alas!
on the morrow, to the great grief of his peo­ ple.
1
He left the sceptre of France to his son Philip, who was still of tender years, appointing Baldwin, duke of Flanders, his guardian and regent of the kingdom.
The duke was a fitting person to undertake his trust, having married Adela, daughter of Robert, king of France, by whom he had Robert, the Frisian, the queen of England, and Eudes, archbishop of Treves, with other children of high rank.
1
The same year died Frederick, son of Duke Gothelon, who was also called Pope Stephen, he was succeeded by Gerard, called also Nicholas.
2
This was the third year of Henry IV., son of Henry Conrad the emperor, and Agnes, empress, who reigned fifty years, being the eighty-seventh emperor from Augustus.
Pope Nicholas died A.D. 1063, and was suceeded by Alex­ ander, bishop of Lucca, at which time Sigefred, bishop of Mayence, and Gunter, of Bamberg, and many other bishops and nobles, made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem with numerous attendants.
3
At that period, grave dissensions arose between William, duke of Normandy, and his barons.
For one ambitious man eagerly endeavoured to supplant another, so that bitter quarrels sprung up from various causes to the great injury of the wretched people.
At this men of a cruel turn of mind found reason to rejoice, while all who loved piety and tranquillity were deeply grieved.
Among those who regarded these disputes with satisfaction were Roger de Montgomery and Mabel his wife, who took the opportunity of gaining the duke's favour by fair professions, while they exasperated him against their neighbours by their crafty manoeuvres.
The duke, naturally passionate, gave the reins to his wrath, more than justice required, disinheriting the distinguished knights, Rodolph de Toni, Hugh de Grant-mesnil, and Arnold d'Echaufour, with their barons, and compelling them to undergo a long exile without any real cause of offence.
At the same time, Robert, abbot of St. Evroult, was cited before the duke's court, and a day appointed him to answer the charges which were falsely alleged against him.
For Rainer, a monk of Châtillon, whom he had raised to be prior of St. Evroult, and had admitted without reserve to his most privy councils, as a confidential friend, had accused him of certain words, spoken in jest and thoughtlessly, of the duke's per­ sonal character.
Abbot Robert, finding his sovereign to be violently enraged against himself and his whole kindred, and bent on their ruin, and having friendly intimation which satisfied him that the marquis's1 anger menaced him with bodily injury, he determined, by the advice of Hugh, bishop of Lisieux, to escape from the wrath which threatened him, before it inflicted any irreparable calamity.
Accordingly, on the sixth of the calends of February [January 27], in the third year of his rule as abbot [A.D. 1061], after chanting at vespers the antiphon, Peccata mea, Domine, he took his departure, and, mounting on horseback with two monks, Fulk and Urse, travelled through France, and thence proceeded to present himself to Pope Nicholas, and lay his case before him.
Meanwhile, the duke of Normandy, by the advice of the venerable Ansfrid, abbot of Preaux, Lanfranc, prior of Bee, and other ecclesiastics, required Rainer, abbot of the convent of the Holy Trinity at Rouen, to send to him Osbern, prior of Cormeille, who, little suspecting the duke's intentions, was by him invested with the dignity of abbot of St. Evroult in a synod at Rouen, the duke using the crozier of St. Mauritius, the archbishop, for the investiture.
Thereupon, Bishop Hugh, by the duke's order, conducted Osbern to Preaux, and there consecrated him abbot;
and then taking him to St. Evroult, at the command of the imperious duke, set him over the sorrowing monks.
This proceeding caused them the greatest trouble and perplexity;
for, while their abbot was still alive, a prelate who had laid the foundations of the new church, had admitted many of them into the order, and whose expulsion had been effected, not by the judgment of a synod on just accusations, but by the tyrannical will of the imperious marquis, they were reluctant to receive another ruler;
but, on the other hand, they did not dare openly to refuse, fearing the duke's anger.
At length, by the bishop's advice, they preferred to submit to the violent intrusion, and to tender their obedience to the master provided for them, rather than continue without any government, being in opposition to the power of God, and running the risk of ruining the new abbey, by drawing on themselves the still more violent displeasure of the duke by resisting his will.
Meanwhile, Arnold d'Echaufour took signal vengeance for the act which disinherited him, by desolating the district of Lisieux, plundering and burning, and either putting to the sword or making prisoners the inhabitants for three years together.
1
Coming one night to Echaufour, with only four men-at-arms, he secretly gained admission into the castle with his followers, and, raising great shouts, they so terrified the garrison which the duke had placed there, consisting of sixty men, that they deserted the fortifications which it was their duty to defend, and fled.
Arnold forthwith set it on fire, causing great loss to the enemy.
At another time, he committed the town of St. Evroult to the flames;
and his retainers, with drawn swords in their hands, made a diligent search in every corner of the monastery for Osbern, the new abbot, threatening him with instant death.
But Provi­ dence bad so ordered it, that he was then absent.
Some days afterwards, Herman the cellarer went privately to Arnold, and gently rebuked him for having threatened the ruin of an abbey which his father had founded for the repose of his soul.
Arnold listened with reverence to the remon­ strances of the servant of God, and, touched with the remembrance of his fathers piety, bewailed his own ill-con­ duct towards the abbey of St. Evroult, promising in his penitence a becoming amends.
Accordingly, he soon after­ wards came to St. Evroult, and, offering on the altar a token of his repentance for his evil deeds, sought absolution, putting Abbot Osbern in security for the future ;
for the cellerer bad adroitly insinuated the truth that it was no ambition of the new abbot which had led to his elevation, but that be was compelled by the power of the duke, and instigated by his own superiors, to undertake the govern- ment of the widowed abbey, much against his own wishes.
Meanwhile Abbot Robert had made his way to Rome, where he laid before Pope Nicholas precise details of the circumstances which had induced him to undertake the journey.
The pope, who was a native of France, received his countryman with great kindness, heard his complaints with interest, and promised to support him in his difficult position.
Robert also paid a visit to his relations in Apulia, where they had obtained possession of many cities and towns by force of arms.
After having a conference with them, he returned to Normandy, furnished with apostolical letters, and accompanied by two cardinal's clerks, and boldly presented himself at the court of Duke William, which he then held at Lillebonne.
1
Hearing that Abbot Robert with the papal legates were arrived for the purpose of claiming the abbey of St. Evroult, and to take proceedings against Osbern, who was made abbot in his place by the duke's command, as an intruder on the rights of another, he was violently enraged, saying that " he would willingly receive the envoys which the pope, as the common father of Chris­ tians, sent to him, touching the faith and the Christian religion, but that if any monk in his territories brought charges against him, he would hang him with contempt on the highest tree in the neighbouring forest."
Bishop Hugh, hearing this, communicated it to Robert, recommending him to avoid the presence of the angry prince.
He, therefore, departed in haste, retiring to the abbey of St. Denys, the apostle of the Gauls, in the neighbourhood of Paris, where he was received by his cousin Hugh, the venerable abbot, and was for some time honourably entertained by him, and others, his friends and relations, who were among the most powerful of the French nobility.
From thence he sent a message, to Abbot Osbern that both should appear at Chartres, before the Roman cardinals, when, the controversy being carefully inquired into, they should both submit them­ selves unhesitatingly to the final judgment of ecclesiastical authorities, according to the decrees of the sacred canons.
On receiving the summons, Osbern declared that he would willingly go to the court of Rome;
but, by the advice of others, he did not appear at the appointed time and place.
Whereupon Robert, by means of a servant of the abbey taken by Arnold, sent letters, by the pope's authority, excommunicating Osbern as an intruder, and positively requiring all the monks of the abbey of St. Evroult to sub­ mit to him.
It is impossible to describe the troubles with which the church of St. Evroult was now harassed, both within and without.
Here was Robert, one of their founders, and their chief ruler, unjustly expelled from his seat, and compelled to become a fugitive from house to house in foreign lands;
while a stranger was thrust into this place by the secular arm, who, though a man of ability, and both religious and zealous for the interests of their order, was naturally enough suspicious and apprehen­ sive and little disposed to put confidence in the native brethren.
When, therefore, they heard of the excommuni­ cation launched against the intruding abbot, and received the monition of father Robert commanding his sons to join him, with the pope's concurrence, some of them, turning their backs on Normandy, accompanied their abbot to the apostolic see.
Almost all, indeed, were desirous to depart, but the young and the infirm, being more closely confined, were obliged to remain against their will.
Those who were strong enough, and who assumed greater liberty, went into voluntary exile with their venerable father;
whose names are as follows:
Herbert and Hubert de Montreuil, and Berenger, son of Arnold, a skilful penman.
These three monks, carefully educated from their childhood in the Lord's house, and their minds stored with sound learning, were all their lives valuable members of a community devoted to God's service.
There were also Reginald the Great, a skilful grammarian;
Thomas of Angers, of noble birth ;
Robert Gamaliel, an excellent chanter;
Turstin, Reynold Chevreuil, and Walter the Little.
All these abandoning Neustria, their native soil, after suffering various accidents reached Sicily, from whence some of them afterwards returned, while others, devoting their services to their shepherd, even to the end, closed their days in Calabria.
The lord Mainer, who had been appointed prior by abbot Robert before he quitted the abbey, first betook himself to Bee a few days after his departure, and was the first to consult with Lanfranc prior of Bee, about substituting another abbot.
He therefore implacably offended the father who had received his first profession.
Alarmed at his denun­ ciations, and exposed with shame to the taunts of his parti­ sans, Mainer obtained leave from abbot Osmond to migrate to Cluni, where he submitted for a year to undergo with zeal the rigour of that ride under the venerable abbot Hugh.
Amongst all these changes, the abbey of St. Evroult suffered great devastations, being robbed of many of the domains it before possessed.
The neighbouring lords, who were kinsmen or tenants of the Circles, seeing the right heirs expelled, inflicted grievous troubles and losses on the monks of St. Evroult.
For each seized a farm, or a church, or tithes;
and the new abbot, being a stranger, was unac­ quainted with all the grants of possessions to the monks, and he hesitated to inquire of those in whom he placed no confidence respecting the domains which Robert son of Heu­ gon, and Giroie son of Fulk de Montreuil, Roger Gulafre,1 and other evil-disposed neighbours, had usurped.
So that at this period the abbey of St. Evroult lost many estates which to this hour it has never recovered.
On the death of Pope Nicholas, he was succeeded by Alexander, to whom abbot Robert presented himself with eleven monks of St. Evroult, and laid before him at length the wrongs of himself and his companions in exile.
The pope comforted them with paternal kindness, and assigned them the church of St. Paul at Rome, where they might dwell and observe their rule, until they were able to find a fitting abode for themselves.
Robert then called William de Montreuil to his assistance, a call which he found him ready to attend to.
This knight was standard- bearer to the pope, and had reduced Campania by force of arms and brought back the natives who were cut off by various schisms from catholic unity to submission to St. Peter the apostle.
He gave to his exiled cousin and his monks the half of an ancient city called Aquina.
1
Robert after­ wards went to Richard prince of Capua, son of Ansquetel de Quarel,2 from whom he received much civility, but he did not carry into effect the promises he made with so much courtesy.
Robert, finding himself deluded by empty hopes, reproached him in much anger for his degeneracy from his father, whom he knew well, and taking leave of him, betook himself to Robert Guiscard, duke of Calabria.
3
The duke paid him great honours as his natural lord, and begged him to take up his abode permanently with his monks in his territory.
Robert Guiscard's father, Tancred de Hauteville, who was born in the Cotentin, had twelve sons and several daughters by his two lawful wives.
He gave up his patri­ monial estate to one of the sons whose name was Geoffrey, apprising the rest that they must gain their livelihood by their courage and by their talents beyond the bounds of their native land.
All these young men migrated to Apulia, not together but at different times, in the guise of pilgrims with scrip and staff, that they might not fall into the hands of the Romans.
In the course of events they all became dukes and counts in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily.
Geoffrey the monk, surnamed Malaterra, at the instance of Robert count of Sicily, has lately published an excellent work on their noble acts, and bold enterprizes.
4
Of these brothers, Robert Guiscard obtained the highest rank, and was the most powerful, having, after the death of his brothers Drogo and Humfrey1 long possessed the principality of Apulia, and conquered the dukedom of Calabria from the Lombards and Greeks, who struggled hard to defend their ancient rights and independence, trusting in their great cities and towns, but were at last reduced to submission by the event of arms.
Crossing the Ionian sea with a small but brave band of Normans joined by Cisalpine troops, Robert Guiscard in­ vaded Macedonia, twice gave battle to Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, and put to flight his immense army, defeat­ ing him both by sea and land.
2
This lord, as I have mentioned before, received with honour abbot Robert and his monks, assigning to him the church of St. Euphemia, which stands on the shore of the Adriatic Sea, where the ruins of an ancient city called Brescia,3 and commanding him to build a monastery there in honour of St. Mary, mother of God.
The duke, as well as other Normans, made large grants to this abbey, commend­ ing themselves to the prayers of the faithful who were already collected or should be thereafter gathered there for the service of Christ.
In this abbey was buried Fredesend, wife of Tancred de Hauteville;
on whose behalf her son Guiscard endowed the church of St. Euphemia with a large farm.
The same prince committed to father Robert the abbey of the Holy Trinity in the city of Venosa.
1 Robert selected Berenger, a monk of St. Evroult, son of Arnold, who was soil of Heugon, whom be presented to Pope Alex­ ander to be admitted to the government of the abbey of Venosa..
Receiving the papal benediction, he administered it with distinction during the period that Alexander, Gregory, and Desiderius, filled the apostolical see, but in the time of Pope Urban he was advanced to the bishopric of that city, having been elected by the people.
Born of a noble family, Berenger obeyed the monastic rule from his childhood under abbot Theodoric at St. Evroult, and dis­ played superior talent in reading and chanting, as well as in the art of copying boobs.
Having in the end, as already related, followed his abbot into banishment, and been chosen by him to undertake the pastoral charge of the abbey at Venosa, he found there only a small company of twenty monks, very much occupied with worldly vanities, and very slothful in God's service;
but by God's grace he raised the number of the community to one hundred, and inspired them with so much zeal for religion, that several of them were made bishops and abbots, and filled these high dignities of our holy mother church to the honour of the true King and the salvation of souls.
Moreover, this great duke committed also a third monastery, built in the city of Melito2 in honour of St. Michael the archangel, to abbot Robert, which he presented to William of Ingran, who was born and became a clerk at St. Evroult, but whose profession of a monk was made at St. Euphemia.
These three Italian monasteries therefore follow the usage of the chant at St. Evroult, and observe the same monastic rule, so far as the habits of that country and the inclinations of the inmates allow.
Two uterine sisters of Abbot Robert, Judith and Anna, remained at Ouche in the chapel of St. Evroult, and having taken the veil apparently renounced the world, and were devoted to God only, in purity of body and soul.
These nuns, hearing that their brother Robert flourished under the protection of the temporal power in Italy, and finding themselves of small account and without support in Normandy, they went into Italy and relinquishing the veil gave themselves up with ardour to a worldly life, and both of them married husbands who were unconscious of their having taken the vows.
Roger, count of Sicily, married Judith, and another count, whose name I cannot recollect, married Emma.
Thus, from love of the world, both quitted the veil the emblem of a religious life, and thus rendering void their first faith, neither were blessed with children, and for a short interval of temporal felicity they incurred the displeasure of their heavenly Spouse.
After the departure of Abbot Robert, his uncle Robert Mala-Corona, perceiving the bitter persecution which was raging against his relations, and that strangers were ad­ vanced to power in the abbey of St. Evroult which he and his brothers had founded for the service of God, withdrew from the chapel of St. Evroult, where, as already mentioned, he had taken up his abode, and retired to Marmoutier in which convent he had first made his monastic profession, and where he soon afterwards made a glorious end on the fourteenth of the calends of February [19th January], having lived seven years under the conventual rule.
AT this time, Geoffrey Martel, count of Anjou, after a succession of brilliant exploits and much worldly prosperity, departed this life,1 leaving his honours to his nephew Geoffrey, son of Aubrey count of Gaston, as he had no children of his own.
Geoffrey however was after some time treacherously made prisoner by his brother Fulk, surnamed Richin, who usurped his earldom and kept him captive in the castle of Chinon for thirty years.
2
In these times William, duke of Normandy, vastly aug- mented his influence and power, surpassing all the neigh­ bouring sovereigns in liberality and magnificence.
He married the illustrious princess Matilda, daughter of Baldwin [V.] earl of Flanders, and niece of Henry, king of France, by his sister.
1
From this marriage, by God's favour, he had the following sons and daughters;
Robert and Richard, William and Henry, Adeliza and Constance, Cicely and Adele.
2
There is no lack of materials from which well-informed historians might compose copious narratives, if they would apply themselves diligently to hand down to pos­ terity the eventful lives of these illustrious personages.
For ourselves, living in monastic seclusion, intent on the rules of our order, and not being versed in the affairs of courts, we will return to the thread of our history, shortly noticing what falls within our own province.
When war broke out between the Normans and their neighbours in Brittany and Maine, Duke William, by the advice of his counsellors, determined on restoring concord among his own barons, and recalling the exiles.
3
Moved therefore by the entreaties of Simon do Montfort, and Waleran de Breteuil in the Beauvais, and other powerful friends and neighbours, be recalled Rodolph de Toni and Hugh de Grant-mesnil, great nobles who had been disinhe­ rited and forced into exile with their followers as before related, and who were now restored to their hereditary estates.
Arnold also, after levying war for three years, accepted a truce from the duke, and paid a visit to his friends and relations who had great possessions in Apulia, from whence be soon afterwards returned with a large sum of money and a rich mantle for the duke.
THE storm of troubles with which the abbey of St. Evroult was beset being somewhat abated, Osbern, the intrusive abbot who was tortured by great perplexities, and consience­ smitten by the apostolic excommunication launched against him, took the course, with the advice and consent of the brethren, of recalling from Cluni the lord Mainer who was appointed prior of St. Evroult by Abbot Robert, and restor­ ing him to that office, from which Fulcher was now deposed.
This Osbern, son of Herfast, a native of the district of Caux, was well instructed in literature from his very youth;
he was eloquent in speech, and had a lively genius for the arts, such as sculpture, architecture, copying manuscripts, and many things of that sort.
He was of middle stature, in the prime of years, his head covered with a profusion of black and grey hair.
Severe towards the silly and the super­ cilious, he was benevolent to the infirm and the indigent, and tolerably liberal to humble individuals and foreigners, being at the same time zealous for his order, and a diligent purveyor of all the brethren needed, both in their spiritual and temporal capacity.
To the novices he was a strict disciplinarian, urging them, both with chidings and stripes, to progress in reading, singing, and writing.
He made with his own hands writing implements for the youths and the uninstructed, preparing for them tablets overspread with wax, and required daily from each the portion of work assigned to them.
An enemy to idleness, he had the art of impressing on the youthful mind profitable pursuits, and thus prepared for implanting the riches of science in future years.
Osbern was at first a canon of Lisieux, at the time the lord Herbert was bishop ;
1 but being afterwards desirous of submitting himself to a stricter rule, he threw off the secular habit;
and, to amend his life according to God's will, secluded himself in the new monastery which Goscelin d'Arques had founded on the mount of the Holy Trinity at Rouen, where Abbot Isembert, a man of singular piety in our age, then flourished.
Abbot Rainier, Isembert's succes­ sor, sent Osbern, after passing his probation in the order, to establish the monastic rule at Cormeilles, where William Fitz-Osbern, steward of Normandy, was founding an abbey in honour of St. Mary, mother of God.
When, however, - Abbot Robert was deprived of his office, in the manner already described, Osbern was unwittingly and unwillingly preferred to the government of the abbey of St. Evreux, which he administered with diligence and success, so far as the troubles of those unhappy times permitted, for five years and three months.
By leave of his abbot Rainier, he had brought with him to St. Evroult a very learned and religious monk whose name was Witmund, and made use of his counsels and suggestions as long as he lived.
This monk was an accomplished musician as well as grammarian, of which he has left us evidence in the antiphons and responses which he composed, consisting of some charming melodies in the antiphonary and collection of versicles.
He completed the history of the life of St. Evroult by adding nine antiphons and three responses.
He composed four antiphons to the psalms at vespers, and added the three last for the second nocturn, with the fourth, eighth, and twelfth response, and an antiphon at the canticles, and produced a most beautiful antiphon for the canticle at the gospel in the second vespers.
The history of the life of St. Evroult had been already written by Arnulph, precentor of Chartres,1 a pupil of Fulbert, bishop of that see, at the request of Abbot Robert, for the use of his monks;
and it was first recited by two young monks, Hubert and Rodolph, sent for that purpose by the abbot of Chartres.
Afterwards, Reginald the Bald composed the response, “To the glory of God,” sung at vespers, with seven antiphons which still appear in the service books of the monks of St. Evroult.
Roger de Sap, also, and other studious brethren produced, with pious devotion, several hymns having the same holy father for their subject, and which they placed in the library of the abbey for the use of their successors.
Abbot Osbern, still tortured with anxiety in consequence of the apostolical anathema under which he was compelled to live, determined, on prudent advice, to send an envoy to Rome, by whom he would humbly implore the papal benediction.
He therefore instructed Witmund, a monk of great sagacity, to indite a suppliant epistle, which a young monk whose name was Bernard, with the addition of Mather, an excel­ lent penman, was carefully to commit to writing.
The following is the text of this epistle:
“To our apostolical lord, Alexander,1 vicar of St. Peter, the common and most excellent father of mankind-his humble servant at a far distance, Osbern, abbot of St. Evroult in Normandy, sends health, devoted submission, and his most earnest supplication.
“Since, holy father, it belongs to your office, in prefer­ ence to and above all other bishops of the church, to extend your care over the whole of Christendom, to seek zealously to gain souls, and by your authority to restore concord where dissensions have arisen, an obscure abbot as I aID, but still clinging to the shelter of your bosom, I lift my voice to you with intense earnestness of mind, imploring your indulgence, and beseeching you to deign to interpose your righteous authority to deliver me from what I suffer from certain distractions in the order to which I belong.
The case is this.
The abbey of St. Evroult, which I now possess, was formerly held by a cousin of your faithful servant, William of Normandy, the lord abbot Robert, who for some cause of offence, vacated his office and departed.
Upon this the sovereign prince of that country and the bishops of the church made me abbot in his place, and, as they then alleged and still allege, to remove my own doubts and fears, they duly and according to God's will conse­ crated me to the vacant dignity.
I know not whether they are right;
but this I assuredly know, from my own con­ science, that I obtained the style and office of abbot neither by importunity, nor by bribery, nor by favour, nor by obsequiousness, or any other crafty device, but that as far as I am concerned I took it upon me solely in obedience to the commands of my superiors, and that in so doing no charge was brought against me.
Abbot Robert has become the superior of a convent in Calabria, at a great distance from our country, and there his wrath and hatred are still inflamed against me;
and he continues to slander and threaten me, asserting that I have usurped his office con- trary to the laws of God.
This schism is both full of danger to the souls of those who are placed under my charge, and places me in great perplexity between the two parties.
For, on the one hand, I do not presume to dis­ obey the bishops of my own province, who assert that I am regularly appointed, and enjoin me to hold my place;
while, on the other hand, I dread the wrath and hatred of my accusing brother, especially as we are both priests and monks.
As indeed the voice of an apostle thunders in our ears :
'He that hateth his brother is a murderer ;
’1 who can sufficiently express the greatness of the crime of a priest and a monk who hates his brother?
And who does not know that if in this state of mind he presumes to offer the sacrifice of the altar, he perils his soul ?"
Therefore, most apostolical lord, the venerable father of all Christendom, prostrate on the earth at the feet of your merciful benignity, I earnestly supplicate with tears and groans that you who occupy the place of St. Peter in vigi­ lantly feeding the Lord's flock, and guarding them from the crafty devices of wolves, would be pleased in your zeal for God to abate by a righteous judgment this fierce contro­ versy between me and the brother of whom I speak, and altogether remove the present perplexity from my mind.
Accordingly, my prayer is, that by virtue of your authority you cause to appear both myself and those who took part in my consecration, together with Abbot Robert, my accuser, before fit and lawful judges, who shall impartially try the cause;
so that, if it be found that I was rightly instituted to the office of abbot, I may continue to hold it;
if improperly, I may surrender it.
Graciously yielding to this my prayer, you will fulfil your office in a praiseworthy manner, and will conduct brothers into the way of peace.
For whether it happens that I have to remain or to depart, my brother's anger will be set at rest by the decision of the judge, and I shall be freed from perplexity, and shall serve God in peace and security.
0 bishop of the bishops of the church, and father of fathers, the appointed refuge for all who are in tribulation, I beseech you by the holy power of binding and loosing which is vested in you over all mankind, listen to these my words of sincerity, and as far as I ask what is right, grant what I ask.
And that you may believe I speak the truth, I call the omniscient God as witness, who knows that in my conscience, the language of my mouth is that of my heart.
In conclusion, most pious lord, I especially request in all humility that you will be pleased, of your paternal kindness, to reply by letter under your seal by the envoy I send, so that I may learn the success of my peti­ tion, and what course you will take in the matter, and when and where;
and having obtained some certainty, my per­ plexities may be at an end, and I may rejoice that I have raised my voice to a most merciful comforter.
Farewell!
Glorious father, most excellent ruler, and supreme head of the church on earth ;
farewell !
watch over the Lord's fold;
which may you so do that you may meet the last judgment in security.
Amen.
”This letter was carried to Rome by William, priest of St. Andrew, at Echaufour, and presented to Pope Alexander.
The venerable pontiff read it in the presence of the Roman conclave, and having carefully examined the matter ab­ solved Osbern at the request of abbot Robert who was there present, sending back the bearer of the letter re­ joicing to his own country with the papal benediction.
As for Robert, he now despaired of ever returning to Nor­ mandy on account of the wrath of duke William, and being honourably detained in Calabria, as already mentioned by G-uiscard and the other Normans who had usurped foreign domains, his former indignation against Osbern was allayed, and he now kindly interceded with the pope for the man he had before cruelly attacked by his subtle accusations.
William the priest, having accomplished his mission, re­ turned in safety to those who had sent him, and rejoiced the hearts of the monks of St. Evroult by relating what he had seen and heard at Rome.
Osbern, now secure in his office, laudably occupied him­ self both in the interior and exterior duties which devolved upon him.
He only admitted four novices to profession, on account of the persecution to which he had been subject, but he diligently and profitably instructed in the sacred arts those whom he found admitted by his predecessors.
He instituted a yearly anniversary on the sixth of the calends of July [26th] June, for the fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, of all the monks of St. Evroult.
The names of all the brethren are registered on a long roll when, called by God, they first make their profession.
To these were added, underneath, those of their fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters.
This roll was kept near the altar throughout the year, and an especial commemora­ tion is made before God of the persons inscribed, when the priest says in celebrating the mass :
Animas famulorum, famularum tuarum, &c., "Vouchsafe to join to the society of thine elect the souls of thy servants, both men and women, whose names are written in the roll presented before thy holy altar."
The anniversary on the sixth of the calends of July, of which we are now speaking, is thus conducted.
All the bells are rung for some time, both night and morning, for the office of the dead.
The roll of the deceased is spread.
open on the altar, and prayers are faithfully offered to God, first for the dead, and afterwards for living relations and benefactors, and all the faithful in Christ.
The morning mass is solemnly sung by the abbot himself, assisted by all the clergy in their sacred vestments.
The almoner as­ sembles in the convent on that day as many indigent persons as there are monks, and the cellarer provides each with a sufficiency of meat and drink in the strangers' apart­ ment, and after the chapter the whole community devotes itself to the service of the poor as in the Lord's supper.
This institution of Abbot Osbern is still carefully main­ tained in the abbey of St. Evroult, and it is likewise zealously observed by the monks of Noyon' and Bocher­ ville,2 and others which follow its rules.
The man of God so often named had a particular regard, as I have said before, for the sick and the poor, supplying their wants liberally with all things necessary.
He there­ fore ordered that seven lepers should, for the love of God, have a yearly maintenance from the abbey, and that the portions of seven monks should be daily distributed among them by the cellarer in meat and drink.
This custom was observed by abbot Osbern and his successor Mainer, as long as they lived;
but when Serlo succeeded, as men's minds change, the institution was altered, and in the time of abbot Roger the number of the sick, in the name of the Lord, was reduced to three.
CH. VIII.
Duke William's invasion of Maine, under cover of protecting the interests of the young Count Herbert— Death of his aunt Bertha and her husband by poison, and of his sister Margaret, the young heiress.
IN the year of our Lord 1064, on the death of Herbert the younger, count of Maine, duke William crossed the Sarthe with a strong army, and received with clemency many of the people of Maine, who submitted to him, remaining under his dominion for the rest of his life, that is, for twenty-four years.
The young count, after the death of his father Herbert the elder1 (who was commonly called Herbert Watch-dog, on account of the destructive inroads which his neighbours of Anjou continually made on his territories), by his mother Bertha's advice, placed himself and his estates under the protection of the powerful duke of Nor­ mandy,2 affiancing his sister Margaret to the duke's son Robert, with the reversion of his earldom of Maine, if he himself should die without children.
But Walter, count of Pontoise, son of Count Drogo, who had undertaken the journey to Jerusalem in company with Robert the elder, duke of Normandy, and died during his pilgrimage, had mar­ ried Biota, daughter [sister] of Hugh, Count de Maine, who was the aunt of the young Count Herbert.
In right of her he laid claim to the whole earldom, and had possession of part of it;
for Geoffrey de-Mayenne and Hubert de Sainte- Susanne, and other powerful adherents of Walter, held the city, which is the capital of the province, fearing to submit to the yoke of the Normans, which is always grievous to those who are subjected to it.
While therefore the brave duke attacked the rebels with vigour, inflicting and suffer­ ing losses, according to the lot of war, Count Walter and Biota his wife perished together, as the report is, by poison, treacherously administered by the contrivance of their ene­ mies.
1
On their death, the duke, now assured of success, attacked the rebels in great force, and recovered the city of Mans in triumph by the voluntary surrender of the in­ habitants, the lord Arnold, the bishop, going out to meet him in great pomp, with a procession of clergy and monks carrying banners and crosses.
Meanwhile, Geoffrey de Mayenne, envying the duke's success, sought all the means in his power to injure him, by encouraging his enemies, and contriving various ways of inflicting evil.
The duke bore his insolence for a while, that be might have an opportunity of punishing him without injury to others.
But, as he persisted in his obstinacy, the duke put in motion a large force, and took his town of Ambrières, burning also Mayenne after a long siege.
By reducing these two fortresses, he humbled the pride of Geoffrey, and thus compelled the most formidable of the nobles of Maine to do him homage, although he had persuaded other malcontents to join him in his resistance.
On his submission, almost all his accomplices and the sup­ porters of his rebellion were struck with consternation, and compelled to fear and obey William, a prince who was evi­ dently protected by divine Providence.
The duke entrusted the beautiful Margaret to the care of Stigand, the powerful baron of Mesidon, to be brought up in his family, but before she became marriageable, she was snatched away from the vanities of the world, and, dying happily, rests in peace, being buried at Fécamp, in the noble and flourishing monas­ tery founded in honour of the holy and undivided Trinity.
At that time Robert de Gace, soil of Rodolph, son of Robert the archbishop, died childless, whereupon Duke Wil­ liam, his cousin, united his whole inheritance to his own domains.
He also gave the lands of Robert de Vitot, who was banished for assassinating Count Gislebert [de Brionne], to Geoffrey Mancel, brother of the viscount Hubert ;
from whom the lord Osbern, abbot of St. Evreux, bought the vill called Douet-Artus, with Tronquet and Mesnil-Joscelin.
Duke William granted and confirmed it by a charter in pre­ sence of the barons of Normandy, William Fitz-Osbern, Richard d'Avranches, son of Turstin, Roger de Montgomery, and many others mentioned in the charter.
However, Robert de Vitot, after some time reconciled himself with the duke, and, being restored to his lordship, laid claim to the land just mentioned against the abbey of St. Evroult, but not long afterwards the war with England, in which he was wounded in the cheek, being ended, he fell sick of a mortal disease.
Finding his end approaching, he freely gave all the land which lie claimed to the faithful servants of God for the repose of his soul.
This gift to St. Evroult was made at Dover, before Odo, bishop of Baieux, Hugh de Grant-mesnil, Hugh do Montfort, and Hugh, son of Fulcold, and many other persons of high and low condition.
This knight had forty nephews, all proud of their rank of knighthood, and engaged in such fierce contests with each other, that his inheritance has scarcely ever been suffered to rest undisturbed to the present day:
for Matthiel and Richard, his brother, Nigel, and Rualod the Breton, Nigel's son-in-law, succeeded at different times, and by their evil devices wrought much mischief.
Every one of these claimed the lands before named from the abbey of St. Evroult, but the judgment of God who is everywhere the mighty pro­ tector of his church, compelled them to desist from their unjust attacks.
It was Matthiel who, with great menaces, made the attempt to rob the church of her possessions during the reign of the great duke William ;
and Richard and other claimants during those of his brothers William Rufus and Henry;
but the King of kings, helping his servants, they were unable to accomplish their wicked designs.
ARNOLD D'ECHOUFOUR, son of William Giroie, returning successful from Apulia, presented himself at the court of Duke William, and, offering him a magnificent mantle, humbly entreated that his inheritance might be restored.
The duke, taking into consideration the high birth and dis­ tinguished valour of this nobleman, and his own great want of brave soldiers for his wars with the people of Maine, the Bretons, and his other enemies, took a more lenient view of his offences, and, making a truce with him, promised to restore his patrimony;
meanwhile giving him free liberty of passing and repassing through his territories for a limited time.
The duke's empty promises caused Arnold great satisfaction, but without just reason, as we shall presently see.
For Mabel, the daughter of Talvac, poisoned the refreshments which she ordered to be set before him as he was returning from the court of the duke to France;
but a friend of Arnold's gave him notice of the treachery intended.
While, therefore, he was conferring with some of his friends at Echoufour, and was earnestly invited by Mabel's attendants to partake of the entertainment, he would on no account consent, remembering the friendly warning, and utterly refusing all meat and drink which he suspected to be poisoned.
But Gislebert, the brother of Roger de Montgomery, who had conducted him there, and was quite unconscious of the treacherous design, took a cup, without dismounting from his horse, and, drinking the poisoned wine, died in consequence on the third day afterwards at Remalord :
so that this perfidious woman, attempting to destroy her husband's rival, caused the death of his only brother, who was in the flower of his youth, and much dis­ tinguished for his chivalrous gallantry.
Not long afterwards, lamenting the failure of her first attempt, she made another not less deadly effort to accomplish the object of her desires.
By means of prayers and promises she worked on Gulafre,l Arnold's chamberlain, till she had bent the false retainer to her nefarious wishes.
She then prepared the poisoned drink, which the chamberlain presented to his master, and to Gi­ role de Courville,2 and William, surnamed Gouet de Mont­ mirail.
Thus the three nobles imbibed the venom of the poison at Courville, at one and the same time;
but Giroie and William, who were carried to their own homes, where they could command all necessary care, by the mercy of God aiding the skill of the physician, recovered, while Arnold, who, as a banished man, had no means of securing proper attentions in the house of a stranger, languished for some days, and at length, the disorder increasing, breathed his last on the calends [Ist] of January.
The day before he died, being alone in his chamber in bed, he saw clearly, and not in a dream, an old man of a noble presence, whom he took for St. Nicholas, who addressed him to this effect:
" Brother, trouble yourself not about your bodily health, for it is' certain that you will die to-morrow, but direct your utmost efforts towards saving your soul, at the scrutiny of the just and eternal Judge."
With these words the old man suddenly vanished, whereupon the sufferer sent imme­ diately to St. Evroult to request that some of the brethren of the abbey would visit him.
Without delay they sent Fulk de Guernauville to Courville.
It was there that the knight of whom we are speaking spent three years during his exile, with Giroie, the lord of that town, who was his kinsman and friend, and from thence, with the aid of the people of Corbon, Dreux, and Mortagne, and all others he could summon to his assistance, he carried on a desperate warfare to revenge his banishment.
The sick man rejoiced greatly at Fulk's speedy arrival, and, making known to him the vision which he had seen the day before, he renounced the world, and professed himself a monk with a tender devotion of soul.
Then, lamenting his sins, he died the same day, and his body was carried to St. Evroult, and there honourably interred by the lord abbot Osbern and the whole community in the monks' cloister.
On the death of Arnold, the noble family of Giroie fell entirely to decay, and, to this day, no one of their posterity has been able to recover the rank of his ancestors.
Arnold had married Emma, daughter of Turstin, surnamed Halduc, by whom he had William and Reginald, Petronilla and Geva, and other sons and daughters.
Thus, losing their father in their tender years, when he was in the flower of his youth, and being settled in the houses of strangers, as we have already noticed, they were exposed from infancy to poverty, and all sorts of mortifications.
Their mother found a refuge with her brother Odo, steward of the duke of Normandy, who dwelt in the Cotentin, and was distinguished for his wealth and power among the Norman nobles.
She lived with him and her other friends almost thirty years in honoured widowhood, being greatly respected for her chastity, gentleness, and other good qualities;
and towards the close of her life, renounced the world, and took the veil with much devotion at the hands of the lord Robert, abbot of the Holy Trinity, at Lessai.1William d'Echaufour, the eldest of Arnold's sons, had scarcely arrived at the age of puberty when he repaired to the court of Philip, king of France, who appointed him his squire, and afterwards knighted him for his good service.
He afterwards went into Apulia, where he had kinsmen of high rank, and, being kindly entertained, advanced himself greatly by his gallant actions.
He took to wife a noble lady of a Lombard family, and obtained possession of thirty castles under Robert, count of Loritello, Guiscard's nephew.
3
The marriage was fruitful, and he had many children of both sexes, and, forgetting Normandy, lived almost forty years among the Lombards in great honour.
Reginald, the youngest son of Arnold, had been entrusted by his father, three months before his death, to Abbot Osbern, and was carefully educated at St. Evroult under the regular discipline of the abbey, receiving from the abbot the surname of Benedict, on account of his sweetness of disposition.
His father, on offering him to God as a monk, bad granted a plough-land at St. Germain's, in the parish of Echaufour, to the abbey of St. Evroult, which it long since lost, in the troubles to which Arnold and his heirs were exposed, as already related.
The youth was only five years old when he submitted to the monastic yoke, which he has steadfastly borne for fifty-two years,3 under four successive abbots, both in prosperity and adversity.
He fully learned the arts of reading and singing, which he taught to others without any mistakes, when he arrived himself at mature years.
His vigorous memory enabled him to relate with great fulness whatever he had seen or heard, and his.
companions were frequently charmed with his recitals from the sacred scriptures, and the statements of the learned.
It was his study to gain the affections of the gentle, and modest, and teachable among the neophytes, by his affability and condescension;
but he stoutly contradicted the conceited, and pretenders, and inventors of novelties.
Twice he undertook journeys, by permission of Abbot Roger, and for the behests of the abbey of St. Evroult, as far as Apulia, and in that foreign land found his brother William, and many other relations possessed of great wealth.
He remained nearly three years in Calabria, with William, abbot of St. Euphemia,1 son of Humfrey de Tilleul, and on his return brought back a cope of purple and white, the gift of Abbot Humfrey, who was his cousin, to the church of St. Evroult.
From his infancy, Reginald observed the monastic rules with praiseworthy regularity, and zealously assisted at the offices of divine worship, both in the day and the night.
I have often remarked him performing the chant with such indefatigable zeal that scarcely a single versicle was sung in the choir by others, in which he did not take a part.
But as it is written:
" Many are the sorrows of the righteous,”2 he suffered much tribulation, both from within and without.
For, being firm and severe to the froward, and disdaining to flatter the hypocritical, he was frequently subject to their attacks of various kinds.
The eye of God seeth all things, and condemns with discriminating judgment even those which to men appear laudable, and he has afflicted our brother Reginald with infirmity of body from his infancy, and that the just may be further justified, continues to this time, to increase the weakness of his limbs.
While he was yet a boy, as he never spared himself, and seemed stronger for every kind of labour than the rest of the brotherhood, be ruptured himself while carrying earth, and, not allowing himself any rest, the hernia became incurable.
In short, he has now for seven years suffered such extreme torture, that he is neither able to raise his hand to his mouth, nor to do any office for himself without assistance.
Almighty God, who healest those who are broken in heart, have mercy upon him!
Purge him from all stain of sin, deliver him from the irksome prison of the flesh, and admit him into the company of thy servants in rest eternal!
The two daughters of Arnold, on the death of their father, and their consequent destitution, chose rather to render themselves acceptable to God by their modest conversation, than to attain worldly prosperity by the perishing charms of their personal beauty.
Both, therefore, dedicated their virginity to the Lord, and gave up the world to become nuns.
Petronilla took the veil in the convent of St:
Mary, at Angers, for a long time diligently observing the rules submitted to by consecrated virgins ;
and afterwards for ten years within the enclosure, she became remarkable far and wide by her character for her sanctity and her exemplary virtues.
Her sister Geva, taking the veil under the abbess Beatrice, in the convent of the Holy Trinity at Caen, founded by Queen Matilda, long practised and taught the holy rule, to her own profit and that of others.
1WILLIAM, the illustrious marquis of Normandy, finding that the people of Beauvais were making efforts to ravage the borders of his territory, expelled Geoffrey, the lawful heir, from the castle of Neuf-Marché,2 for some trivial offence, and entrusted the defence of it to several of his barons ;
but, by reason of the continual inroads of the people of Milli, and Gerberoi,3 and other neighbours, hardly any one of them was able to hold it for a single year.
At length the great duke committed the castle to Hugh de Grant-mesnil, who was eminent for skill and courage, joining with him Gerold, his high steward, and granting to Hugh one moiety of the fief.
He did this by the advice of Roger de Montgomery, who was jealous of a bravery too nearly resembling his own, and sought to bring him into disgrace by some device or occurrence.
Hugh, however, thankfully accepted the custody of the fortress, and, by God's help, in the course of a year, took two of the chief leaders of the men of Beauvais prisoners, and, striking terror into the rest of the enemy, restored tranquillity through all the country in that quarter.
Four canons were in possession of the church of St. Peter the apostle at Neuf-Marché, but they were negligent in the performance of divine worship, and led a very worldly life.
The noble Hugh, therefore, gave the moiety of the church which belonged to him to the abbey of St. Evroult, upon the terms that, upon the death of the canons, or their avoidance from any other cause, they should be succeeded by monks:
which was carried into effect.
For two of the canons who had been instituted to the portion held by Hugh, taking their departure, monks were appointed in their place, and have continued in possession of a moiety of the preferment to the present day ;
Robert the Bald, Ralph de la Roussière, and John de Beaunai, and other excellent men, resided there.
On a certain occasion there was a violent quarrel between Count Hugh, so often named, and Ralph, count of Mantes, father-in-law of Philip, king of France,' and Hugh, boldly encountering the count of Mantes with inferior forces, was compelled to retreat.
In the flight Richard de Heudicourt, of the Vexin, was wounded;
for, urging his horse to full speed at the ford of the river Epte, he received in his back a sharp thrust, by the lance of a knight who pursued him.
Being carried by his comrades to Neuf-Marché, and fearing he should die, by the advice of Count Hugh, to whose family he was attached by military services, be vowed that in future he would serve under the monastic rule in the exercises of virtue.
He therefore sent for the monks of St. Evroult, and put himself under the government of Abbot Osbern.
Afterwards, by the mercy of God, who, in different ways snatches sinners from the pit of de­ struction, be somewhat recovered his health, though it was never entirely restored, living for seven years a zealous member of the order, and benefiting the church in various ways.
Having neither wife nor child, he, after his being wounded, voluntarily ceded his patrimony in the Vexin to the church of St. Evroult, and procured from his uncle Fulk, and Herbert the butler (who was lord of the fief), as well as from his other relations, the entire surrender of their interest in the property.
His wound was never entirely closed, and there issued from it daily, so those who were witnesses report, as much matter as would fill the egg of a goose;
he zealously observed the conventual rules, and cheerfully performed the duties of his order.
He went either on foot or on horseback wherever he was ordered, on the business of the convent, which he forwarded both by word and deed to the utmost of his ability.
In consequence, Abbot Osbern esteemed him more than the other monks, and placed entire confidence in him, so that when he planned the new church, which he commenced building, he made him the overseer of the works, with the charge of the expenditure, and the superintendence of the stone-cutters.
At the instance of this Richard, and by his advice, Abbot Osbern undertook a journey to France, and made the acquaintance, through his agreeable conversation, of the eloquent Robert, and of Herbert de Serranz, and Fulk de Chaudri, with other knights and persons of inferior rank in the Vexin, and took possession of the domain of Heudicourt for the abbey of St. Evroult, with the consent and approbation of the aforesaid nobles and their neighbours.
On his return he took to his bed, and, his sickness increasing, he caused himself to be carried into the chapter, and ordered the letter, which, as before mentioned he addressed to Pope Alexander, to be distinctly read.
This he did that all might clearly understand that he had not usurped the rights of Abbot Robert, but had undertaken the government of the abbey against his own wishes, but in compulsory obedience to the will of others.
He then strengthened the brethren by his exhortations, entreating them to regard his errors with indulgence, and to cherish his memory.
And so, having made his confession and partaken of the holy communion of the body of our Lord, he expired, surrounded by the monks devoutly chanting litanies for him, on the sixth of the calends of June [27th May],1 having governed the abbey of St. Evroult five years and.
three months.
On the morrow, Vitalis, abbot of Bernai, came to bury his friend, and interred him in the cloister of the monastery, near the church of St. Peter, prince of the apostles, from whence, seventeen years afterwards, his successor Mainer transferred his remains, with the bones of Witmund, his companion, into the new chapter-house.
IN the year of our Lord 1066 [the fourth indiction], in the month of April, there appeared in the zodiac, for fifteen days together, a star called a comet,1 which, as clever astrologers, who have keenly investigated the secrets of nature, assert, portended a revolution.
For Edward, king of England, the son of ICing Ethelred by Emma, daughter of Richard the elder, king of Normandy, had died just before,- and Harold, Earl Godwin's son, had usurped the English throne.
Guilty as be was of perjury, cruelty, and other iniquities, he had now held it three months, to the great injury of many persons, inasmuch as his unjust usurpation had occasioned violent animosities between different families, from which mothers had to bewail the loss of their sons, and wives of their husbands.
There is no doubt that Edward had bequeathed the realm of England to his kinsman William, duke of Normandy, announcing it, first by Robert, archbishop of Canterbury,3 and afterwards by Harold himself, and, with the consent of the English, making the duke heir to all his rights.
4
Moreover Harold had taken the oath of allegiance to duke William at Rouen, in the presence of the nobles of Normandy, and doing him homage had sworn on the holy relics to all that was required of him.
1
After that, the duke took Harold with him in an expedition against Conan, count of Brittany,2 presenting him and his retinue with noble war horses, splendid armour, and other gifts of value, in the presence of the army.
This Englishman was distinguished by his great size and strength of body, his polished manners, his firmness of mind and command of words, by a ready wit and a variety of excellent qualities.
But what availed so many valuable gifts, when good faith, the foundation of all virtues, was wanting?
Returning to his country, his am­ bition tempted him to aspire to the crown, and to forfeit the fealty he had sworn to his lord.
He imposed upon King Edward, who was in the last stage of decay, approaching his end, by the account he gave of his crossing the sea, his journey to Normandy, and the result of his mission, falsely adding that Duke William would give him his daughter in marriage,1 and concede to him, as his son-in-law, all his right to the throne of England.
The feeble prince was much surprised at this statement;
however, he believed it, and granted all the crafty tyrant asked.
Some time afterwards, King Edward, of pious memory, died at London on the nones [fifth] of January, in the twenty-fourth year of his reign, and was interred in the new monastery which he had just built on the western side of the city, and at the consecration of which he had been pre­ sent the week before.
His body was laid near the altar which St. Peter the apostle had blessed with the working of miracles in the time of Mellitus, bishop of London.
On the very day of the funeral, when the people were bathed in tears for the loss of their beloved king, Harold caused himself to be crowned by Archbishop Stigand alone,2 though the pope had suspended him from his functions for certain crimes, without the concurrence of any other bishops and the earls and barons of the realm.
When the English were apprized of the bold usurpation effected by Harold, they were very indignant and some of the most powerful lords, resolved on an obstinate resistance, refused to offer him any token of submission.
Others, not knowing how to free themselves from the yoke imposed upon them, which soon became firmly fixed, and, on the other hand, consider­ ing that they could neither depose him, nor while he held the reigns of government set up another king to the advantage of the realm, submitted to the usurpation, conso­ lidating the power which he had already established.
-
In a short time the throne which had been iniquitously seized was stained by horrible crimes.
The earls Edwin and Morcar, sons of Algar the first of the English earls, were attached by the strictest ties to Harold, and employed all their efforts to support his cause, he having married their sister Edith, who had been the queen of Griffith a powerful king of Wales, to whom she bore Blethyn, his successor, and a daughter named Nesta.
1 Tostig, however, Earl Godwin's son, finding that his brother's enterprise proved successful, and that the kingdom of England was subject to great oppression, was much dis­ tressed, and determined to oppose him and even to levy war against him.
Wherefore Harold violently deprived him of his father's earldom, which as eldest son he had held for sometime during the reign of Edward2 and drove him into exile.
Tostig, thus banished, took refuge in Flanders, where be committed his wife Judith to the care of his father-in-law Baldwin, earl of Flanders, and then hastening to Normandy strongly remonstrated with Duke William for suffering his perjured vassal to usurp the crown of England, which he pledged himself the duke would secure if he crossed the channel with a Norman army.
These princes had been long attached to each other, having married two sisters, through whom their regard was frequently revived.
William therefore received his companion with open arms, and thanking him for his friendly suggestions, and roused by his exhortations, assembled the barons of Normandy to consult with them publicly on what was to be done with regard to an enterprise of such vast importance.
At that time Normandy was favoured by possessing many accomplished prelates and illustrious nobles.
Maurilius, who from a monk became a metropolitan, was archbishop of Rouen;
Odo, the duke's uterine brother, was bishop of Baieux ;
Hugh, brother of Robert Count d'Eu, was bishop of Lisieux ;
William of Evreux;
Geoffrey of Coutances ;
John, son of Ralph, count of Bayeux, was bishop of Avranches ;
and Ivo, son of William de Belesme, of Seez.
1
All these prelates were distinguished by the splendour of their noble extraction, their zeal for religion, and their many excellencies.
Foremost in the ranks of the laity stood Richard, count of Evreux, son of Archbishop Robert;
Count Robert, son of William viscount d'Eu;
Robert, earl of Morton, uterine brother of Duke William;
Rodolph de Conches, son of Roger Toni, standard-bearer of Normandy;
William Fitz- Osbern, the duke's cousin and high steward;
William de Warrene, and Hugh Boteler;
Hugh de Grant-mesnil and Roger de Moubray;
Roger de Beaumont, and Roger de Montgomery;
Baldwin and Richard, sons of Count Gislebert,2 with many others whose valour had gained them military distinction, and whose native sagacity and decision in coun­ cil were not inferior to the matured virtues of the Roman senate, but aspired to imitate them both in their inde­ fatigable constancy, and the talent and courage they em­ ployed in conquering their enemies.
All these were summoned by the duke's command to a general consultation;
and upon an affair of so much import­ ance being submitted to their consideration, opinions were divided according to the differences in men's minds, The more daring spirits, willing to flatter the duke's ambition, encouraged their comrades to plunge into the contest, and were for engaging in so great an enterprise without hesi­ tation.
Others were opposed to an undertaking of so much difficulty, pointing out to those who were too venture­ some, and were running headlong to destruction, its great inconveniences and perils;
they magnified the obstacles presented by the want of a fleet and the dangers of the voyage, and alleged that a handful of Normans were une­ qual to the conquest of the numerous hosts of the English.
1
At length the duke sent Gislebert,2 archdeacon of Lisieux, to Rome, to ask for advice from Pope Alexander on the state of affairs.
On hearing all the circumstances, the pope favoured the legitimate rights of the duke, enjoined him to take up arms against the perjurer, and sent him the stand­ ard of St. Peter the apostle, by whose merits he would be defended against all dangers.
Meanwhile, Tostig received the duke's permission to return to England, having firmly engaged to assist him, both in his own person and with all his friends.
But as it is written :
“
Man proposes, but God disposes,” 3 things turned out very differently from what he expected.
For embarking from the Cotentin,1 he was unable to reach England.
Harold held possession of the channel with a, large fleet and the coasts with strong bodies of troops, in order to prevent the enemy from landing in the kingdom be had treacherously usurped without a severe conflict.
Tostig was therefore in great perplexity, it being out of his power to make a hostile descent on England with his small force in the face of innumerable enemies, nor could he direct his course back to Normandy, the winds being contrary.
Driven to and fro alternately by winds from the west, the south, and other quarters, he was exposed to great distress and encountered many perils while wandering over the sea, until at last, after severe sufferings, be landed in the domi­ nions of Harold, king of Norway, surnamed Harfager.
2
Being well received by this prince, and perceiving that he could not fulfil the promises he had made to Duke William, he altered his plans, and thus addressed him:
" Great king, I come a suppliant to your highness, offering myself and my faithful services to your majesty, in the hopes that, by your aid, I may be restored to my hereditary rights.
My brother Harold, who in truth ought to submit to me as his elder brother, has treacherously magnified himself against me, and even presumed, at the price of perjury, to usurp the English crown.
Knowing therefore, your pre-eminence in power, and in forces, and every excellence, I earnestly entreat you, as one prepared to do you homage, to render me your powerful assistance.
Humble the pride of my perfidious brother by a hostile invasion of England;
and reserving one half of it for yourself, confer the other on me, who will thenceforth preserve my fealty to you unbroken as long as I live."
The ambitious king was highly pleased at this proposal.
He immediately ordered an army to be assembled, warlike engines to be prepared, and the royal fleet was, during the six months following, completely equipped.
The exiled wanderer encouraged the Norwegian king to this great enterprise, and by this skilful change in his plans, while it flattered the king and saved himself from being treated as a spy, afforded him the opportunity of obtaining revenge for his banishment by his faithless bro­ ther.
Meanwhile, the marquis of Normandy was making pre­ parations for his own enterprise, uninformed of the disasters which had befallen his precursor, and had driven him north­ ward so far out of his intended course.
A fleet of ships was carefully fitted out in Normandy, supplied with all necessaries, in building which both the clergy and laity rivalled each other in contributing both funds and labour.
1
Large bodies of troops were raised by a general levy throughout Normandy.
Reports of the expedition drew many valiant men from the neighbouring countries, who prepared their arms for battle.
Thus the French and Bre­ tons, the Poitevins and Burgundians, and other people on this side the Alps, flocked together for the war over the sea, and scenting the booty which the conquest of Britain offered, were prepared to undergo the various perils and chances, both by sea and land, attending the enterprise.
WHILE these transactions were taking place, Osbern, abbot of St. Evroult, departed this life, as already related, and the chapter of the monks consulted the duke, before he crossed the sea, about appointing a successor.
He was then hold­ ing a council of his nobles at Bonneville.
1
In consequence, by the advice of Bishop Hugh and other prudent counsellors, he chose the prior Mainier, and invested him with the temporalities of the abbey by the delivery of the pastoral staff, commanding him to have the forms which should com-
Init to him the cure of souls duly complied with;
all which he willingly performed.
On the same day,2 the duke commanded the lord Lan­ franc, prior of Bee, to appear before him, and gave him the abbey which he himself had just nobly founded at Caen in honour of St. Stephen the proto-martyr.
Lanfranc was therefore the first abbot of Caen, but shortly afterwards he was promoted to the archbishopric of Canterbury.
He was a native of Lombardy, deeply versed in the knowledge of the liberal arts, gifted with benevolence, generosity, and all the sacred virtues, and ceaselessly intent on almsgiving and other good works.
Indeed, from the day already men­ tioned, when at Bonneville he was first raised to rule in the church, for twenty-two years and nine months he was nobly distinguished for the good to multitudes of the faith­ ful in the house of God.
By the duke's command, the venerable Bishop Hugh conducted Mainier, the Lord's servant, to St. Evroult, and there consecrated him according to the statutes of the canons before the altar of St. Peter the apostle, on the seventeenth of the calends of August [July 16th].
Mainier, having thus taken on him the name and office of abbot, lived worthily, administering the government twenty-two years and seven months with great usefulness, for, by God's help, he made great improvements in the monastery com­ mitted to him, both within and without.
He skilfully succeeded, by his kindness of manner and reasonable argu­ ments, in satisfying the brethren who were somewhat dis­ turbed at his election.
They had selected for their governors two monks, eminent for their piety and their erudition of both sorts, Reginald de la Roche and Fulk de Guernauville, and were, therefore, at no little variance with the abbot who was set over them, without their concur­ rence, by the bishop and their neighbours.
Often, on occa­ sions of this sort, disturbances are made by the worst of persons;
for while the perverse strive earnestly to give the preference to their own opinions, regular order and sounder counsels are hindered.
But Almighty Gael extends his powerful protection to his church in all difficulties, cor­ recting those who are in error, and mercifully lending the aid which is needed, in the manner and by the persons he seeth fit.
His good providence it was, as will hereafter plainly appear, which raised Mainier to the government of the abbey of St. Evroult, standing as it did in a barren territory and surrounded by most worthless neighbours.
Mainier was born in the adjoining town of Echalltour, he was an accomplished scholar in grammar, dialectics, and rhetoric;
skilful and severe in eradicating vices, he was zealous in inculcating virtue among the brethren.
A dill­ gent observer of the monastic rule, he pointed out the way of life both by word and deed to those who were committed to his charge, and encouraged many to work in the Lord's vineyard, both by being their leader and their anxious COIn­ panion.
Maimer began building the new church dedicated to St. Mary, mother of God, St. Peter the apostle, and St. Evroult the confessor, in which are seven altars consecrated to the divine majesty in honour of his saints.
For the old church which St. Evroult had founded in honour of the prince of the apostles, when Chilperic and his nephew Hildebert were kings of the Franks was much dilapidated by the great age, and was too small for the number of the monks, which was continually increasing.
A building of stone at Ouche is a very laborious undertaking, because the quarry of Merlerault from whence the hewn stones are brought, is six miles distant.
1
The overseer of the work had therefore the greatest difficulty to procure horses, oxen, and carts, for the transport of the masses of stone and other materials re­ quired for so large a work.
This abbot had not a moment's repose during the whole time of his rule ;
but by his great anxiety for numerous objects, rendered important services, both to the community then governed by him and their successors.
By God's help and the contributions and munificence of the brethren and his friends he completed the building of a spacious and beautiful church, conveniently adapted for celebrating divine service, a dormitory and re­ fectory, kitchen, and cellar, with other necessary offices for the use of the monks.
Among others, Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, when he assisted at the consecration of the church of Caen, in the twelfth year after the war with England,2 remitted to abbot Mainier twenty-four pounds of English money and two marks of gold, and he afterwards sent over from Canterbury forty pounds sterling by the hands of the lord Roger de Sap, who was known and esteemed by him for his learning.
With these donations the abbey tower was carried up, and the dormitory for the monks built.
Queen Matilda gave a rich mitre and cope for divine service, and one hundred pounds of Rouen currency to build the refectory.
William de Ros, clerk of Baieux, who held three dignities in that church, being precentor, dean, and archdeacon,3 gave forty pounds sterling to the monks of St. Evroult.
Not long afterwards he voluntarily relin­ quished the grandeur of the world, and became a monk at Caen, from whence he was preferred to the government of the abbey of Fécamp before he had completed the first year of his monastic profession.
His name is inscribed in the register of the monks of St. Evroult, for the many benefits he conferred on the abbey, and masses, prayers, and alms were appointed for him as if he had been a brother there professed.
It was by the help of these and other contributors that the fabric of the new church was raised, and the work begun both in that and the abbey buildings was nobly finished.
During the government of abbot Mainier, ninety monks of various ranks and conditions, whose names are inscribed in the general register, put off the secular habit in the school of St. Evroult, and inspired by the counsels and example of excellent men, undertook to walk in the difficult path which leads to salvation.
Some of these obtained the prize of their holy conversation during the lifetime of their venerable father ;
others remained longer in their religious course steadfastly maintaining a protracted contest, and striving to render themselves acceptable to God by their prayers, and useful to men by their good works.
Some who were of noble families contributed largely to the support of the monastery, and procured from their relations, acquaint­ ance, and friends, donations of tithes and churches and ecclesiastical ornaments for the use of the brethren.
It is quite out of my power to describe particularly the gifts made by each individual to their cherished abbey, but I wish with God's help, to record some of them faithfully, as far as my opportunities of reference permit, for the general good and the information of posterity.
Roger de Hautrive, the senior monk, by order of abbot Rainier, went into the Vexin to take possession of Heudi­ court, the domain which the wounded knight gave to St. Evroult, as I have before related, but he found the land uncultivated, and almost a desert.
In the first place he erected an oratory with boughs of trees in honour of St. Nicholas, bishop of Myrrha., from whence the village which now stands on the spot is called by the inhabitants to this day the chapel of St. Nicholas.
It often happened in the night that while Roger de Hautrive, as he himself used to relate, was singing matins in his chapel of boughs a wolf took his station without, and as it were, responded to the chant by his bowlings.
This venerable man, divinely sup­ ported, attached to himself by ties of regard Herbert the Butler, who after the death of his cousin Herbert, who was brother of Richard the wounded knight, gave one moiety of his fief to St. Evroult.
There Roger de Hautrive laboured, with the assistance of his generous friend, until he had brought under cultivation the land which for a long season had been deserted on account of the war and other calamities;
and there Roger de Sap, after some years suc­ ceeding the former senior monk, began the building of a church of stone.
The before mentioned knight (Herbert the Butler) had great power in the Vexin, and being pos­ sessed of great wealth and surrounded by sons and valiant relations and kinsman was exalted above almost all his neighbours.
His wife's name was Rolande, daughter of Odo de Chaumont, who bore him Godfrey and Peter, John and Walo, with several daughters, by whom he had a numerous posterity.
The father and brothers of whom we are speaking were all knights of distinguished courage, and, as far as outward appearances, of approved conduct both towards God and man.
The mother has been all her life of exemplary virtue, being still living, though her husband and children are numbered with the dead.
By the kindness and assistance of this family, the chapel of St. Nicholas, the bishop, was erected, with a convenient house for the monks, who live regularly and cultivate peace;
and so it remains to the present day.
At the same time Fulk, SOIl of Ralph de Chaudrei, had the greatest regard for the venerable Roger [de Hautrive] on account of his many virtues, so that be begged him kindly to be sponsor for his son at the holy font of baptism, which he willingly undertook.
Their acquaintance and regard gradually increasing, he granted to his gossip the church of St. Martin de Parnes, the parish church, at which a congregation was assembled from seven neighbouring vil­ lages on appointed days to offer prayers to God, and to hear his praises and precepts in a becoming manner.
The worthy father coming to Parnes, Fulk, with the consent of Wascelin his brother, gave to St. Evroult the church with all the dues belonging to it, and one plough-land in the same vill, and the tithes of his plough, with two houses and one mill called Barre-chemin.
He also gave to the monks the archdeaconry which he held in fee of the archbishop of Rouen by inheritance from his ancestors, and he also granted to the monks the lordship of all the householders in Parnes, on condition that if they made any defeasance to the lords, they should not forfeit their houses, but be mulct in some other way.
The inhabitants of Parnes1 were delighted at having the monks for their lords, hoping that under their protection they should be safe from the inroads of the Nor­ mans in the neighbourhood, from which they frequently suffered.
In the course of time, when Goisbert the phy­ sician was prior, Fulk gave the ground for the cemetery to promote the building of a new church.
The foundations were then laid, but the work proceeded slowly through many hindrances for twenty-four years, and is not yet completed.
2
Fulk, the knight I am now speaking of, was brave and high-spirited, ardent in all his enterprises, irascible and fierce when roused to arms.
He was very ready to lay violent hands on the property of others, and imprudently scatter his own in order to gain the empty honour of being accounted liberal.
He took to wife Ita, daughter of Heremar de Pon­ toise, by whom he bad Walter and Maimer, Hugh and Grervase, Hermar and Fulk, with a daughter named Luxovie.
Maimer and Fulk were devoted from their infancy to a mo­ nastic life, but the other four sons followed the career of arms.
Fulk's character being, as I have observed, so unstable, he sometimes honoured the monks, and stoutly defended them against all adversaries, while at other times he griev­ ously oppressed them.
There lived at Parnes, serving God under the monastic rule, the old Roger and Goisbert the physician, Robert the Bald, John and Isemberd, with several others, of whom Bernard, surnamed Michael, and Reginald, Theodoric, and Walter the Bald, with William of Caen, sur­ named Alexander, after spending their lives devoted to pious offices, ended them there, and were there interred with great veneration.
The grant of all that Fulk gave to the monks was confirmed by Robert the Eloquent, of Chaumont, who had the lordship in chief.
Not long afterwards, while this Robert was carrying off the booty which he had collected with violence on the lands of St. Ouen, he fell from his horse in full armour, and, his helmet fixing in the ground, broke his neck and he perished miserably.
His body was in­ terred by abbot Maimer near L'Aillerie in the chapter-house of the monks of Flavigni, residing there.
His sons Osmond do Chaumont, Guazon de Poix, and Robert de Beauvais, confirmed to St. Evroult all that their ancestors had given and granted to the abbey, as before related.
In this manner the monks of St. Evroult obtained the church of Fames, which was a very ancient structure dedi­ cated to St. Martin, metropolitan [archbishop] of Tours, and in which the remains of St. Judoc, confessor of Christ, are reverently preserved to the present day.
Who he was, and whence he came, I shall briefly write in a short passage of this history, faithfully making extracts from a book contain­ ing an account of his holy life.[ABOUT A. D. 650.]
The blessed Judoc,1 SOIl of Juthail [Howel], king of the Bretons and brother of King Judicail,2 being sought for to be elevated to the throne, relinquished the pursuit of learning to which he had devoted himself at Llanmelmon, and went in pilgrimage to Rome with four others.
However Haymon, duke of Ponthieu, recognising his noble origin, detained him on the road, and having had him ordained priest, made him his chaplain.
After seven years Judoc became a hermit at La Broie on the river Autio, where he served God eight years, and fed with the hand several sorts of birds and small fishes, like domestic animals.
At one time when he had only one loaf, and divided it among four poor persons, in spite of the remonstrances of his servant Vulmar, God sent him four small boats laden with provisions on the river Autio.
He afterwards built an oratory in honour of St. Martin at Runiac on the river Canche,1 where he lived fourteen years.
One day an eagle carried off eleven hens, and the cock last;
the man of God made the sign of the cross accompanied by a prayer, when the eagle, shortly returning, brought back the cock and presently expired.
Once when Judoc, in company with Duke Haimon, was searching for a suitable habitation in -a thick wood, the duke was very thirsty, and weary with hunting he fell asleep, during which the man of God planted his walking staff in the ground and offering a prayer, a spring burst forth on the spot.
Sick folk resort there and vene­ rating the saint, drink the water, and are quickly cured.
The servant of God constructed in the wood with his own hands two oratories of timber;
one he dedicated to St. Peter the bearer of the keys of heaven, the other to the eloquent St. Paul.
He afterwards went to Rome, from whence he brought back many relics of saints.
Juliula, a young girl who was blind from her infancy, was admonished by a vision to bathe her eyes in the water wherewith Judoc had washed his hands, and upon her so doing recovered her sight.
This happened while the man of God was returning from Home, and a cross of wood being raised on the spot the place was called La Croix.
Meanwhile, in the absence of Judoc at Rome, Duke Haimon caused a church of stone to be erected in the wil­ derness where the hermit had dwelt, and on his return caused it to be dedicated to the honour of St. Martin, and gave for its endowment a certain vill in his domains, with all its appurtenances.
Judoc, the.
faithful champion for God, there maintained a long warfare, and after happily ending the course of his holy life departed to Christ on the ides [13th] of December.
His two nephews, Winoch and Arnoch, succeeded him, and were accustomed frequently to wash the body and clip the hair of the holy man whose remains long continued to show no tokens of decay.
Drochtric, Duke Haimon's successor, had often heard this, but be did not believe it.
Rashly determined, therefore, to investigate the matter, he caused the sacred tomb to be burst open, and looking in, started back in terror, exclaiming, "Ah! holy Judoc!"
He became instantly deaf and dumb, and his whole body was paralyzed to the day of his death.
His wife, struck with alarm at her husband's calamity, poured forth lamenta­ tions to God, and for the salvation of his soul gave the two villages of Crespiniac and Netreville to St. Judoc.
These events took place in the time of Dagobert, son of Lothaire the Great, king of the Franks.
Isembard of Fleuri,1 at the command of Abbot Herbald, wrote to Adelelm the monk, that the body of St. Judoc was discovered in the year of our Lord 977, during the reign of Lothaire, son of Lewis, king of France, in the following manner.
A certain peasant, named Stephen, who gained his livelihood by being a miller, being admonished in a dream by one clothed in bright robes left his wife and children, and went to the place where St. Judoc was interred, and there became a clerk.
No man living then knew the spot where the body of the saint lay, but Stephen, inspired by the vision, began to search within the church, and at the suggestion of Pridian Sigeman, he found the coffin on the right side of the altar of St. Martin.
Thereupon, amidst general rejoicings, and while hymns of thanksgiving were sung to God, the coffin containing the body of the saint was disinterred, and lifted from the grave.
The news of the discovery was quickly spread, and multitudes of people hastened to witness the disinterment of the holy remains, and to make their prayers and offerings to the saint.
Many miracles were wrought on the spot, and diseases of various descriptions were there cured.
At last, on the eighth of the calends of August [ July 25th,] the body of St. Judoc, was deposited with great reverence over the altar of St. Martin.
The very same year, the foundations of a monastery were laid on that spot, means were taken for settling the order of monks, and the venerable Sigebrand was appointed abbot.
One night, while the body of St. Judoc was deposited in the church of St. Peter, there were seven tapers before the remains, one of which only was lighted by the sacristan, but while the guardians of the holy relics were asleep, the other six candles were lighted by fire from heaven.
So, on another occasion, when the body of St. Judoc was in his own church, a lamp which had been extinguished by the violence of the wind and showers of rain, bad its light mira­ culously restored in the presence of Sigeman.
One Sunday, while Pridian was celebrating a solemn mass, a certain vassal of Count Hilduin, whose name was Garembert, was full of evil designs, wanting to plunder the church at his will, and to substitute for Sigeman an abbot more conformable to his purposes.
When, however, it was read in the gospel for the day:
"
Why think ye evil in your hearts ?"1 the wretched man was smote by an invisible hand, and began to vociferate loudly, and being struck the third time by the power of God, he fell to the earth, vomiting clotted blood from his mouth.
After mass he was carried out by order of Sigeman the sacristan,2 and on the morrow, by the merits of St. Judoc, recovered his reason.
This happened in the time of Hugh the Great.
The same day, a woman named Ostrehilde was intending to leave the church after mass, but her feet were so firmly fixed at the threshold, that no one could release them;
she, however, felt no inconvenience except extreme cold from her knees to the soles of her feet.
The next day she vowed to become the handmaid of God and St. Judoc;
and being immediately relieved, she piously kept her vow.
It is related by the monks Adelelm and Richer, faithful reporters, that while Stephen translated the relics of St. Judoc to the monastery of St. Riquier during the erection of the church, the illustrious Bertsende, the marriageable daughter of Alsinde, suffered great pains from her hips to her feet for two years, so that she could not walk nor even move without the aid of a staff.
Having prayed with faith, as well as her mother, before the relics of the holy confessor, she was cured of her infirmity, and her mother was so rejoiced at her daughter's recovery that she made an offer­ ing of a rich mantle to the physician who so quickly answered her prayers.
While a man named Robert was travelling alone at mid- day, he saw the spirit of error in the shape of a man, and was immediately struck blind.
A long time afterwards, he sought the tomb of St. Judoc, and professed himself his servant before Abbot Guy.
The same day blood flowed freely from his eyes, and he recovered his sight, and at vespers publicly declared that he could see the monks sitting on their benches.
Gunzo, a priest of Lorraine, suffered for seven years extreme weakness in his hands and feet.
Some one who saw him recommended him to go and find the physician Judoc in Ponthicu.
He hastened to follow this advice.
On a Sunday, about the third hour, he entered the church, and prayed prostrate on the pavement, which he bedewed with his tears.
Having finished his prayers, he rose up sound.
Then he joined in the mass with great joy, and gave a faithful account of his recovery to the people, with thanks­ giving to God.
Waldemar of Lorraine, having lost his right eye through sickness, determined, by the advice of his friends, on a pilgrimage to St. Judoc.
But, missing his way, he happened to light in company with his friend on the fountain which Judoc in his lifetime had caused by his merits to burst forth.
Waldemar, seeing a fountain of very clear water, called to his companion to stop, and sat down to rest;
presently, he washed his hands and his face in the fountain, and suddenly recovered sight in the eye which was blind.
Thus cured, he came joyfully to the monastery, and gave thanks to God, surrounded by rejoicing friends.
Two demoniacs, named Maginard, were set free at the tomb of St. Judoc, and lived long afterwards in the world with sound minds.
Sieburg, wife of Bertrand, a man of distinction, having been subject for ten months to a flow of blood from her nostrils, was conducted by her friends to the shrine of St. Judoc to obtain a cure.
She offered her prayers, but no relief immediately followed, and she left the church sorrow­ ful and full of complaints.
But when in bitterness of spirit she had set forth to return home, as she passed a cross set up by the way-side, the blood ceased to flow from her nostrils.
Immediately turning back, she retraced her steps to the monastery of the holy man;
and her thanksgivings having been offered, she was entirely healed.
Robert de Terouenne, going alone at mid-day to oversee his work in the field, was suddenly seized by the devil, and tormented to such a degree that he was tempted by the adversary almost without intermission to destroy everything, and even to devour men.
His three brothers therefore, having kept the fast of the four seasons in June, brought , him bound to the tomb of St. Judoc, where they remained from the fourth day of the week to Saturday.
From that time the afflicted man began to be more tranquil, and being restored to a sound mind, devoted himself from thenceforth to the service of St. Judoc.
At his request abbot Guy ascended the pulpit on the feast of St. John the Baptist, and related the circumstances to the people, pointing out to them Robert, who was present, and publicly testified his own deliverance.
A certain man of ripe years, was for seven years so deaf that he could hear nothing.
His wife brought him to the tomb of the blessed saint, where he prayed for a while.
Then his wife, by Pridian's order, led him to the fountain of St. Judoc, and three times sprinkled his head with the waters of the fountain.
Presently, returning to the church he heard mass, which, for seven years previously he had been unable to hear.
Isembard de Fleuri at the request of Adelelm, wrote these accounts of what happened in the time of Hugh the Great, or King Robert;
but since that time the blessed Judoc has not ceased to work miracles in favour of those who offered him their prayers, though from negligence they are not recorded.
The rulers of the kingdom being changed, and the nobles engaged in mutual quarrels, the body of St. Judoc was again covered with earth from fear of the enemy, and lay so long in concealment that all those who were concerned in it forgot where it was deposited.
In the time of Henry, king of France, when the monks often complained of their not knowing where their patron saint, the blessed Judoc, rested, the holy remains were divinely revealed to a simple layman, who, pointing out the spot, they were solemnly raised under the superintendence of the abbot and brethren.
The monks then admitted the discoverer of the sacred relics into their order, and made him guardian of the holy body, committing to his charge the offerings of the faithful.
On the death of the abbot, his successor did not esteem the sacristan as he ought, nor treat him as courteously as his predecessor had done.
Whereupon the sacristan, being much aggrieved, got possession of the holy relics by night and carried them with him into France.
Geoffrey, lord of Gomerfontaine, honourably received him with the treasure be bore, and appointed him master of the castle church, in which there were four canons, for the term of his life.
Some time afterwards, wars breaking out, Henry, king of France, besieged Gomerfontaine with the strength of the French army, driving out Geoffrey, and setting the place on fire.
But while the devouring flames were consuming the church and buildings of the castle, and horrible cries were raised by the assailants and the besieged, as happens at such times, one of the canons took the bones of St. Judoc from the tomb, and fled in all haste from the burning edifices.
One of the king's soldiers met him on the bridge, and demanded of him what was the burden he carried.
Upon his answering that it contained sacred vestments, and his own books, the soldier violently stripped him of all he carried, and took his prize with him to the territory of Parnes.
The man's name was Robert, surnamed Meslebren, that is, Mix-bran;
he was one of the retainers of Ralph de Chaudri, who was at that time one of the best knights in the French army.
The soldier, greatly delighted with the prize he had made, caused it to be carefully deposited in the church of St. Martin, by the priest and parishioners, where, for more than seventy years, it was reverently preserved.
Innumerable miracles were there wrought on the sick, and to this day are frequently repeated, when the faith of the supplicants merit relief, as the whole neighbourhood bears witness.
William de Merlerault, a venerable monk and priest, has composed an excellent work on the translation of the holy body, of which we have only here given a brief account, and of the many cures of the sick performed at Parnes.
In this book he truly and clearly relates all the wonderful occurrences connected with the sacred relics.
Philip, king of France, was afflicted with fever two years, nor could all the skill of his physicians afford him any relief.
At the end of the two years he came to Parnes, and, drinking water made holy by touching the relics of St. Judoc, he spent two nights in prayer before the holy body, and his pains ceased, and he recovered his health on the spot.
In consequence, the king made an offering to St. Judoc of fifty sous of Pontoise, and granted a fair, to be held annually at Parnes in honour of St. Judoc, on the third day of the feast of Whitsuntide, confirming the grant by a royal charter.
1
Besides these, many other miracles have been wrought, and continue to be daily performed at Parnes through the merits of St. Judoc, of which some are recorded, but the greater part are buried in oblivion, from the negligence of those who were privy to them, or from the ignorance of those who saw or experienced them.
For my part, though I must hasten to other matters which claim our attention, I have most willingly collected some few details relating to you, 0 holy Judoc, inserting in this imperfect work notices of the heavenly gifts conferred on you, and devoutly extolling them so far as my limited powers permit.
I beseech you there­ fore, 0 glorious son of the king of the Bretons, and fellow of the angels, that you commend me to God by the efficacy of your merits, and obtain for me admission into the society of the saints, with whom, contemplating in his glory the Creator of all things, I may offer triumphant praises through all ages.
Amen.
IN the month of August,1 Harold, king of Norway, and Tostig, with a powerful fleet set sail over the wide sea, and, steering for England with a favourable aparctic, or north wind, landed in Yorkshire, which was the first object of their invasion.
Meanwhile, Harold of England, having intelli­ gence of the descent of the Norwegians, withdrew his ships and troops from Hastings and Pevensey, and the other sea­ ports on the coast lying opposite to Neustria, which he had carefully guarded with a powerful armament during the whole of the year, and threw himself unexpectedly, with a strong force by hasty marches on his enemies from the north.
A hard-fought battle ensued, in which there was great effusion of blood on both sides, vast numbers being slain with brutal rage.
At last the furious attacks of the English secured them the victory, and the king of Norway as well as Tostig, with their whole army, were slain.
2
The field of battle may be easily discovered by travellers, as great heaps of the bones of the slain lie there to this day, memorials of the prodigious numbers which fell on both sides.
While however the attention of the English was diverted by the invasion of Yorkshire, and by God's permission they neglected, as I have already mentioned, to guard the coast, the Norman,fleet, which for a whole month had been waiting for a south wind in the mouth of the river Dive and the neighbouring harbours, took advantage of a favourable breeze from the west to gain the roads of St. Valeri.
3
While it lay there innumerable vows and prayers were offered for the safety of themselves and their friends, and floods of tears were shed.
For the intimate friends and relations of those who were to remain at home, witnessing the embarkation of fifty thousand knights and men-at-arms, with a large body of infantry, who had to brave the dangers of the sea, and to attack an unknown people on their own soil, were moved to tears and sighs, and full of anxiety both for themselves and their countrymen, their minds fluctuating between fear and hope.
Duke William and the whole army committed themselves to God's protection, with prayers, and offerings, and vows, and accompanied a procession from the church, carrying the relics of St. Valeri, confessor of Christ, to obtain a favourable wind.
At last when by God's grace it suddenly came round to the quarter which was the object of so many prayers, the duke, full of ardour, lost no time in embarking the troops, and giving the signal for hastening the departure of the fleet.
The Norman expedition, there­ fore, crossed the sea on the night of the third of the calends of October [29th September], which the Catholic church observes as the feast of St. Michael the archangel, and, meeting with no resistance, and landing safely on the coast of England, took possession of Pevensey and Hastings, the defence of which was entrusted to a chosen body of soldiers, to cover a retreat and guard the fleet.
Meanwhile the English usurper, after having put to the sword his brother Tostig, and his royal enemy, and slaughtered their immense army, returned in triumph to London.
As however worldly prosperity soon vanishes like smoke before the wind, Harold's rejoicings for his bloody victory were soon darkened by the threatening clouds of a still heavier storm.
Nor was he suffered long to enjoy the security procured by his brother's death;
for a hasty messenger brought him the intelligence that the Normans had embarked.
1
Learning soon afterwards that they had actually landed, he made preparations for a fresh conflict.
For his intrepidity was dauntless, and his conduct of affairs admirable, while his personal strength was great, his presence commanding, and he had the arts of a persuasive eloquence, and of a courtesy which endeared him to his supporters.
Still his mother Githa, who was much afflicted by the death of her son Tostig, and his other faithful friends, dissuaded him from engaging in battle with the Normans;
his brother, Earl Gurth, thus addressing him:
"It is best, dearest brother and lord, that your courage should be tempered by discretion.
You are worn by the conflict with the Norwegians from which you are only just come, and you are in eager haste to give battle to the Normans.
Allow yourself, I pray you, some time for rest.
Reflect also, in your wisdom, on the oath you have taken to the duke of Normandy.
Beware of incurring the guilt of perjury, lest by so great a crime you draw ruin on yourself and the forces of this nation, and stain for ever the honour of our own race.
For myself, I am bound by no oaths, I am under no obligations to Count William.
I am therefore in a position to fight with him undauntedly in defence of our native soil.
But do you, my brother, rest awhile in peace, and wait the issue of the contest, that so the liberty which is the glory of England, may not be ruined by your fall.
”Harold was very indignant at this speech.
Holding in contempt the wholesome advice of his friends, he loaded his brother with reproaches for his faithful counsel, and even forgot himself so far as to kick his mother when she hung about him in her too great anxiety to detain him with her.
For six days Harold sent forth the summons to call the people to arms from all quarters, and, having assembled vast numbers of the English, he led them by forced marches against the enemy.
It was his design to take them unawares, and crush them at once by a night attack, or, at least, by a sudden onset, and, that they might not escape by sea, he caused a fleet of seventy ships, full of soldiers, to guard the coast.
Duke William, having intelligence of Harold's .
approach, ordered his troops to take to their arms on the morning of Saturday.
1
He then heard mass, strengthening both body and soul by partaking of the consecrated host;
he also reverently suspended from his neck the holy relics on which Harold had sworn.
Many of the clergy had followed the Norman army, among whom were two bishops, Odo, of Bayeux, and Geoffrey, of Coutances, with attendant clerks and monks, whose duty it was to aid the war with their prayers and counsels.
The battle commenced at the third' hour of the ides [14th] of October, and was fought despe­ rately the whole day, with the loss of many thousand men on both sides.
The Norman duke drew up his light troops, consisting of archers and men armed with cross-bows, in the first line;
the infantry in armour formed the second rank;
and in the third were placed the cavalry, in the centre of which the duke stationed himself with the flower of his troops, so as to be able to issue his commands, and give support to every part of the army.
On the other side, the English troops, assembled from all parts of the neighbourhood, took post at a place which was anciently called Senlac,2 many of them personally devoted to the cause of Harold, and all to that of their country, which they were resolved to defend against the foreigners.
Dismounting from their horses, on which it was determined not to rely, they formed a solid column of infantry, and thus stood firm in the position they had taken.
Turstin, son of Rollo, bore the standard of Normandy.3
The sound of the trumpets in both armies was the terrible signal for beginning the battle.
The Normans made the first attack with ardour and gallantry, their infantry rushing forward to provoke the English, and spreading wounds and death through their ranks by showers of arrows and bolts.
The English, on their side, made a stout resistance, each man straining his powers to the utmost.
The battle raged for some time with the utmost violence between both parties.
At length the indomitable bravery of the English threw the Bretons, both horse and foot, and the other auxiliary troops composing the left wing, into confusion, and, in their rout, they drew with them almost all the rest of the duke's army, who, in their panic, believed that he was slain.
The duke, perceiving that large bodies from the enemy had broken their ranks in pursuit of his flying troops, rode up to the fugitives and checked their retreat, loudly threatening them, and striking with his lance.
Taking off his helmet, and exposing his naked head, he shouted:
“ See, I am here;
I am still living, and, by God's help, shall yet have the victory."
Sud­ denly the courage of the fugitives was restored by these bold words of the duke;
and, intercepting some thousands of their pursuers, they cut them down in a moment.
In this manner, the Normans, twice again pretending to retreat, and when they were followed by the English, suddenly wheeling their horses, cut their pursuers off from the main body, surrounded and slew them.
The ranks of the English were much thinned by these dangerous feints, through which they fell separated from each other;
so that, when thousands were thus slaughtered, the Normans attacked the survivors with still greater vigour.
They were charged home by the troops of Maine, France, Brittany, and Aquitaine, and great numbers of them miserably perished.
Among others present at this battle, were Eustace, Count de Boulogne, William, son of Richard, Count d'Evreux, Geoffrey, son of Robert, Count de Mortagne, William Fitz- Osbern, Robert, son of Robert de Beaumont, a novice in arms, Aimer, Viscount de Thouars, Earl Hugh, the constable, Walter Giffard, and Ralph Toni,1 Hugh de Grant-mesnil, and William de Warenne, with many other knights illustrious for their military achievements, and whose names merit a record in the annals of history amongst the most famous warriors.
Duke William surpassed them all in courage and conduct;
for he nobly performed the duties of a general, staying the flight of his troops, re-animating their courage, their comrade in the greatest dangers, and more frequently calling on them to follow where he led, than commanding them to advance before him.
He had three horses killed under him in the battle;
thrice he re-mounted, and did not suffer his steeds to be long unavenged.
Shields, helmets, and coats of mail were shivered by the furious and impatient thrusts of his sword;
some he dashed to the earth with his shield, and was at all times as ready to cover and protect his friends, as to deal death among his foes.
Although the battle was fought with the greatest fury from nine o'clock in the morning, King Harold was slain in the first onset,1 and his brother Earl Leofwin fell some time afterwards, with many thousands of the royal army.
Towards evening, the English finding that their king and the chief nobles of the realm, with a great part of their army, had fallen, while the Normans still showed a, bold front, and made desperate attacks on all who made any resistance, they had recourse to flight as expeditiously as they could.
Various were the fortunes which attended their retreat;
some recovering their horses, some on foot, attempted to escape by the highways;
more sought to save themselves by striking across the country.
The Normans, finding the English completely routed, pursued them vigorously all Sunday night, but not without suffering a great loss;
for, galloping onward in hot pursuit, they fell unawares, horses and armour, into an ancient trench, overgrown and concealed by rank grassy and men in their armour and horses rolling over each other, were crushed and smothered.
This acci­ dent restored confidence to the routed English, for, perceiving the advantage given them by the mouldering rampart and a succession of ditches, they rallied in a body, and, making a sudden stand, caused the Normans severe loss.
At this place Eugenulf, lord of Laigle, and many others fell, the number of the Normans who perished being, as reported by some who were present, nearly fifteen thousand.
Thus did Almighty God, on the eye of the ides [14th] of October, punish in various ways the innumerable sinners in both armies.
For, on this Saturday, the Normans butchered with remorseless cruelty thousands of the English, who long before had murdered the innocent prince Alfred and his attendants ;
1 and, on the Saturday before the present battle,2 had massacred without pity King Harold and Earl Tostig, with multitudes of Norwegians.
The righteous Judge avenged the English on Sunday night, when the furious Normans were precipitated into the concealed trench ;
for they had broken the divine law by their boundless covetous­ ness;
and, as the Psalmist says:
" Their feet were swift to shed blood," whereupon, " sorrow and unhappiness was in their ways.”
3Duke William, perceiving the English troops suddenly rally, did not halt;
and when he found Count Eustace with fifty men-at-arms retreating, and the count wished him to have the signal sounded for recalling the pursuers, he com­ manded him with a loud voice to stand firm.
The count, however, familiarly approaching the duke, whispered in his ear that it would be safer to retreat, predicting his sudden death if he persisted in the pursuit.
While he was saying this, Eustace received a blow between the shoulders, so violent that the noise of the stroke was plainly heard, and it caused blood to flow from his mouth and nostrils, and he was borne off by his comrades in a dying state.
The victory being secured, the duke returned to the field of battle, where he viewed the dreadful carnage, which could not be seen without commiseration.
There the flower of the youth and nobility of England covered the ground far and near stained with blood.
Harold could not be dis­ covered by his features, but was recognized by other tokens, and his corpse, being borne to the duke's camp, was, by order of the conqueror, delivered to William Mallet for interment near the sea-shore, which had long been guarded by his arms.
1Inconstant fortune frequently causes adverse and unex­ pected changes in human affairs ;
some persons being lifted from the dust to the height of great power, while others, suddenly falling from their high estate, groan in extreme dis­ tress.
Thus Edith, Earl Godwin's relict, who once enjoyed wealth and influence, was now overwhelmed with grief and a prey to the deepest misfortunes.
She had borne seven sons to her husband:
Sweyn, Tostig, Harold, Gurth, Alfgar, and Wulnoth.
They were all earls, and distinguished for their handsome persons, as well as what the world calls excellence;
but each of them underwent a different and disastrous fate.
Alfgar and Wulnoth, indeed, feared God and lived according to his laws, and both died in the odour of sanctity confessing the true faith, the one a pilgrim and monk at Rheims, the other at Salisbury.
2
For the other five, following the career of arms, they met their death in a variety of ways, and on different occasions.
The sorrowing mother now offered to Duke William, for the body of Harold, its weight in gold;
but the great con­ queror refused such a barter, thinking it was not right that a mother should pay the last honours to one by whose insatiable ambition, vast numbers lay unburied.
He issued orders that the bodies of his own soldiers should be buried with the greatest care;
and also-gave all the English who applied for leave free liberty to bury those of their friends.
After providing for the decent interment of the dead the duke marched to Romney, and taking it by assault, re­ venged the slaughter of a party of his troops, who, having landed there by mistake, were fiercely attacked by the in­ habitants and cruelly butchered, after great loss on both sides.
The duke then continued his march to Dover, where there was a large body of people collected, because they thought the position impregnable, the castle standing on the summit of a steep rock, overhanging the sea.
The garrison, however, struck with panic at the duke's ap­ proach, were preparing to surrender, when some Norman squires, greedy for spoil, set the place on fire, and the devouring flames spreading around, many parts were ruined and burnt.
The duke, compassionating those who were willing to render him their submission, ordered them to be paid the cost of rebuilding their houses, and their other losses.
The castle being taken, eight days were spent in strengthening the fortifications.
While he lay there a great number of soldiers, who devoured flesh-meat half raw and drank too much water, died of dysentery, and many more felt the effects to the end of their days.
The duke, leaving a garrison in the castle, with those who were suffering from dysentery, marched onward to complete the subjugation of those he had vanquished.
The Kentish men, of their own accord, met him not far from Dover and swore fealty to him, delivering hostages for their allegiance.
1After that Harold was slain, Stigand, archbishop of Can­ terbury, and the great earls Edwin and Morcar, with the other English nobles, who were not engaged in the battle of Senlac, declared Edgar Etheling, son of Edward king of Hungary,1 SOIl of Edmund Ironside, king, and gave out that they were resolved to fight bravely under that prince, for their country and their nation against foreign enemies.
2
Meanwhile duke William, having intelligence that they were assembling in increasing numbers, marched with a strong force, and encamping near London, detached fifty knights and men-at-arms in advance, who compelled the troops which issued from the city to oppose them to retreat within the walls, after losing many of their number, to the great sorrow of the citizens, who lamented their sons and friends.
Fire also was added to the calamities inflicted on them, all the buildings on that side of the river being burnt.
Whereupon the duke crossed the Thames and marched to Wallillgford.
Stigand the archbishop, and other English nobles, met him there,3 and, abandoning the cause of Edgar, came to terms with William, to whom they did homage, and being received with favour were secured in all their honours and estates.
The Londoners, also, being better advised, now transferred their allegiance to the duke, and delivered to him such and so many hostages as he required.
Edgar Etheling, therefore, who bad been declared king by the English, having no means of resistance, humbly surrendered his person and his kingdom to William.
This young prince was of a mild and ingenuous disposition, and being a kins­ man of king Edward the Great, as his nephew's son,1 the duke affectionately embraced him, and treated him all his life with the regard due to a son.
2
In the course of three months, by God's providence, tran­ quillity was restored throughout England, and the bishops and barons of the realm having made their peace with William, entreated him to be crowned, according to the custom of the English kings.
This was the great aim of­ the Normans, who had encountered great perils by land and sea, to procure for their prince the ensigns of royalty;
and this, by divine influence, was the desire also of the native inhabitants, who, up to that time, had only given their allegiance to crowned kings.
At that time Aldred was metropolitan and archbishop of York.3
He was a great lover of justice, of mature age, wise, eloquent, and good, and distinguished by many vir­ tues, and following in the footsteps of the fathers, strove earnestly to be received with favour by the King of kings.
But Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury, was too much en­ gaged in secular affairs, and had been suspended by Pope Alexander for certain crimes.
At length, in the year of our Lord 1067,4 the fifth indic­ tion, on Christmas day, the English assembled at London for William's coronation, and a guard of Norman troops was posted round the abbey, mounted and fully armed, to prevent any treasonable and seditious attempt.
Then, in the presence of the bishops, abbots, and nobles, of the whole realm of Albion, Aldred the archbishop consecrated William, duke of Normandy, king of England, and placed the royal crown1 on his head in the church of St. Peter the apostle, called Westminster Abbey, where the venerable king Edward lies interred.
Meanwhile, at the instigation of the devil, the enemy of all good, an unforeseen occurrence, pregnant with mischief to both nations, and an omen of future calamities, suddenly happened.
For when Aldred the archbishop was demand­ ing of the English, and Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, of the Normans, whether they consented to have William for their king, and the whole assembly loudly gave their willing assent, with one voice though not in one language, the men- at-arms, who formed the guard outside the abbey, upon hearing the shouts of joyful acclamation raised by the people in the church in a language they did not under­ stand, suspected some treachery and imprudently set fire to the neighbouring houses.
The flames quickly spreading, the people in the church were seized with panic in the midst of their rejoicings, and crowds of men and women, of all ranks and conditions, eagerly struggled to make their escape from the church, as if they were threatened with immediate danger.
The bishops only, with some few of the clergy and monks, maintained their post before the altar, and trembling with fear completed the coronation office with some difficulty, the king himself being much alarmed.
Almost all the rest hastened to the scene of conflagration, some to make vigorous efforts to extinguish the flames, and more in the prospect of committing robberies in the con­ fusion that prevailed.
The English were greatly enraged when they understood the origin of this unfortunate affair, which leading them to suspect the Normans and consider them faithless, they waited for some future opportunity of revenge.
KING WILLIAM governed firmly and prudently, both in prosperity and adversity, the kingdom he gained, reigning over it with great honour twenty years, eight months, and sixteen days.
1 William of Poitiers, archdeacon of Lisieux, has given a full account of his merits, his excellent institu­ tioni, his great successes and brave and wonderful achieve­ ments, in a valuable work distinguished for the elegance of its style and its depth of thought.
Having for a long pe­ riod been chaplain to this king, he made it his business to retrace at length, with unquestionable truth and ample details all that he had himself witnessed or been party to;
but unfortunately he was prevented by adverse events from continuing his narrative to the king's death.
2Guy, bishop of Amiens,3 also wrote an epic poem, which, in imitation of Virgil and Papinius, describes the battle of Senlac, blaming and accusing Harold, and highly praising and exalting William.
John of Worcester,1 a native of England and a monk from his childhood, of venerable character and great learning, in his continuation of the chronicles of Marianus Scotus, gives a faithful account of King William and of the events which took place during his reign, and those of his sons William Rufus and King Henry to the present day.
Marianus was a monk of the abbey of St. Alban the martyr, near Mayence, where, following to the best of his means, Eusebius of Cæsarea, St. Jerome, and other historians, he kindly em­ ployed himself in the charitable office of presenting to such sons of the church as were unable themselves to develop such important results, the happy fruits of his long studies and of the vast labours he underwent in his foreign travels.
After carefully consulting both ancient and modern writers, he published his Chronography, in which, beginning with the creation, when God formed Adam out of the dust of the earth, and pursuing his inquiries through the books of the Old and New Testament, and the Greek and Roman histories, he collected all that was important;
and fixing the chronology through the series of kings and consuls, which he continued to the day of his death, his historical annals are deservedly esteemed.
John of Worcester who followed, re- corded the events of nearly a century, and by the order of the venerable Wulstan, bishop and monk, appended his continua­ tioni' to the Chronicle of Marianus ;
succinctly relating many things worthy of observation in the histories of the Romans, Franks, Germans, and other nations.
Accordingly these chronicles include the whole series of the Hebrew judges, kings, and high priests, from Moses to the destruction of Jerusalem in the reigns of Titus and Vespasian, when the kingdom of the Jews was justly overthrown on accouut of the death and passion of our Lord.
The Chronicles also give the names of all the Romail consuls and dictators, emperors and pontiffs, as well as of all the kings of England, who reigned from the time that Hengist and Horsa made war on Vortigern, king of Britain, to the great injury of the Britons.
To these the Chronicle adds the bishops who governed the English church from the time when Pope Gregory commissioned Augustine and Mellitus and other monks to preach the word of God in England, by whom Ethelbert, king of Kent, Edwin, king of the Northumbrians, and other princes of the English nation, were converted to the true faith.
Sigebert, a monk of Gemblours,2 has extract­ ed many important passages from these Chronicles, omitting however several relating to the insular nations, and adding much valuable information respecting the Goths, the Huns, the Persians, and other barbarous races.
I have been an­ xious to direct attention to these works, in order that inquiring readers may consult them for themselves, offering as they do a rich harvest of instruction, though they are difficult to meet with.
For being written by modern authors, they are not as yet got into general circulation.
One of these Chronicles I met with at Worcester in England, the other at Cambray in Lorraine.
It was kindly shown me by Fulbert, the learned abbot of the monastery of St. Sepulchre, built on the north side of Cambray by the exertions and at the expense of Liutbert, bishop of that city, where his re­ mains were honourably interred.
1
And now, exhausted by my long labours, I sigh for repose and am ready to close this First Book2 of the Ecclesiastical History which my faithful pen has compiled relative to con­ temporary and neighbouring princes and doctors of the church.
In the books which follow I shall speak more fully of King William, and describe the untoward changes in the state of affairs, both in England and Normandy, looking for honour or reward neither from the conquerors nor the conquered.
