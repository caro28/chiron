A SHARPER.
—A Street in Athens:
the house of CHARMIDES on one side, and that of PHILTO on the other.
CHARMIDES, a wealthy Athenian, his property having been much diminished by the reckless conduct of his son, goes abroad.
His dissolute son, Lesbonicus.
being left behind at Athens, consumes the little resources left him, and then puts up his father's house for sale.
At his departure, Charmides has entrusted his interests and the care of his son and daughter to his friend Collides, and has also informed him that in his house there is a treasure buried as a re­ serve against future contingencies.
In order that this may not be lost, Callicles buys the house of Lesbonicus for a small sum.
Ignorant of his reason for doing so, his fellow-citizens censure him for his conduct, and accuse him of a breach of good faith in ministering to the extravagance of Lesbonicus by supplying him with money.
For this reason Megaronides ex­ postulates with his friend Callicles, and greatly censures him;
on which, Callicles, in self-defence, entrusts him with the secret of the treasure.
Char­ mides having left behind him a grown-up daughter in the care of Callicles, Lysiteles, a young man of rank and character, falls in love with her, and through his father, Philto, asks her in marriage.
Her brother, Lesbonicus, is not averse to the match, but refuses to let her marry without giving her a portion;
and he offers her to Lysiteles, on condition that he will receive as her marriage-portion a piece of land near the city, the sole remnant of his for­ tune.
This, however, Lysiteles refuses to accept.
In the mean time, Callicles, at the suggestion of Megaronides, determines to give the young woman a dowry out of the treasure buried in the house which he has bought;
but that Les­ bonicus may not suspect whence the money really comes, a Sharper is hired, with instructions to pretend that he brings letters from Charmides with a thousand gold pieces as a portion for his daughter when she should marry.
It happens, that while the Sharper is on his way with his pretended errand to the abode of Callicles, Charmides, having unexpectedly returned to Athens, is going towards his house.
He meets the Sharper, who discloses his errand and attempts to impose upon Charmides, who thereupon discovers himself.
Charmides then meets his servant Stasimus, who tells him of the purchase of his house by Callicles, whereon he conceives himself to have been betrayed by his friend.
Afterwards, on discovering the truth, he praises the fidelity of Callicles, and bestows his daughter on Lysiteles, with a portion of a thousand gold pieces, and, at the intercession of Lysiteles, he forgives his son Lesbonicus, and informs him that lie is to be married to the daughter of Cal­ licles.
[Supposed to have been written by Priscian the Grammarian.
]CHARMIDES,going abroad, entrusts a treasure (Thesaurum) secretly hidden, and all his property (Rem), to his friend Callicles.
He (Istoc) being absent, his son wantonly squanders his estate.
For (Nam) he sells even the house:
and Callicles makes purchase of it.
His sister, a maiden ( Virgo) without a dowry, is asked in marriage.
That in a less degree (Minus), with censure, Callicles may bestow on her a dowry, he commissions one (Mandat) to say that lie has brought the gold from her father.
When (Ut) the Counterfeit has reached the house, the old man (Senex), Charmides, as he has just returned, disappoints him;
his children then are married.
Lux.
Follow me this way, daughter, that you may per­ form your office.
Pov.
I am following, but I know not what to say will be the end of our journey.
Lux.
'Tis here.
See, this is the house.
Now go you in.
(Exit POVERTY, who enters the house of CHARMIDES.Lux. (to the AUDIENCE).
Now, that no one of you may be mistaken, in a few words I will conduct you into the right path, if, indeed, you promise to listen to me.
First, then, I will now tell you who I am, and who she is who has gone in here (pointing to the house), if you give your attention.
In the first place, Plautus has given me the name of Luxury, and then he has willed that this Poverty should be my daughter.
But why, at my suggestion, she has just entered here, listen and give attentive ear while I inform you.
There is a certain young man who is living in this house;
by my assistance he has squandered away his paternal estate.
Since I see that there is nothing left for him to support me, I have given him ray daughter, together with whom to pass his life.
But ex­ pect nothing about the plot of this play:
the old men who will come hither will disclose the matter to you.
The name of this play in the Greek is " The Treasure" [Thesaurus] ;
Philemon wrote itl:
Plautus translated it into Latin2, and gave it the name of" The Three Pieces of Money" [Trinum­ mus].
Now, be begs this of you, that it may be allowed the play to keep that name.
Thus much have I to say.
Fare. well.
Attend in silence.
(Exit.MEG.
To reprove one's friend for a fault that de­ serves it, is a thankless task;
but sometimes 'tis useful and 'tis profitable.
Therefore, this day will I soundly reprove my friend for a fault that much deserves it.
Unwilling am I, did not my friendship bid me do it.
For this faultiness has encroached too much upon good morals, so drooping now are nearly all of them.
But while they are in this distempered state, bad morals, in the mean time, have sprung up most plenteously, like well-watered plants ;
nor is there now any­ thing abundant here but these same bad morals.
Of them you may now reap a most plenteous harvest:
and here a set of men are making the favour of a few of much more value than that in which they may benefit the many.
Thus private interests outdo that which is to the public advantage-interests which in many points are a hindrance, and a nuisance, and cause an obstruction both to private and to public welfare.
CALL. (as he enters).
I wish our household God1 to be graced with a chaplet.
Wife2 (addressing her within), pay him due respect, that this dwelling may turn out for us prosperous, lucky, happy, and fortunate;
and (in a lower voice) that, as soon as I possibly may, I may see you dead and gone.
MEG.
This is he who in his old age has become a child3 -who has been guilty of a fault that deserves correction.
I will accost the man.
CALL. (looking around).
Whose voice is it that sounds near me ?
lEG.
Of one who wishes you well, if you are as I desire you to be;
but, if you are otherwise, of one who is your enemy, and is angry with you.
CALL.
Health to you, 0 my friend and years'-mate!
How are you, Megaronides ?
MEG.
And, i' faith4, health to you, Callicles!
Are you well ?
Have you been well ?
CALL.
I am well, and I have been still better.
MEG.
And how does your wife do ?
How is she ?
CALL.
Better than I wish.
MEG.
'Tis well, i' faith, for you, that she is alive and well.
CALL.
Troth, I believe that you are glad if I have any misfortune.
MEG.
That which I have, I wish for all my friends as well.
CALL.
Harkye, how does your wife do ?
MEG.
She is immortal;
she lives, and is likely to live.
CALL.
I' faith, you tell me good news;
and I pray the Gods that, surviving you, she may last out your life.
MEG.
By my troth!
if indeed she were only married to yourself, I could wish it sincerely.
CALL.
Do you wish that we should exchange ?-that I should take yours, and you mine ?
I'd be making you not to get a bit the better of the bargain of me.
AEG.
Indeed, I fancy1 you would not be surprising me unawares.
CALL.
Aye, faith, I should cause you not to be knowing2 the thing yon were about.
MEG.
Keep what you've got;
the evil that we know is the best.
But if I were now to take one that I know not, I should not know what to do.
CALL.
In good sooth, just as one lives3 a long life, one lives a happy life.
MEG.
But give your attention to this, and have done with your joking, for I am come hither to you for a given purpose.
CALL.
Why have you come ?
MEG.
That I may rebuke you soundly with many harsh words.
CALL.
Me, do you say ?
MEG.
Is there any one else here besides you and me ?CALL. (looking about).
There is no one.
MEG.
Why, then, do you ask if 'tis you I mean to re­ buke ?
Unless, indeed, you think that I am about to reprove my own self.
For if your.
former principles now flag in you, or if the manners of the age are working a change in your disposition, and if you preserve not those of the olden time, but are catching up these new ones, you will strike all your friends'with a malady so direful, that they will turn sick at seeing and bearing you.
CALL.
How comes it into your mind to utter these ex­ pressions ?
MEG.
Because it becomes all good men and all good women to have a care to keep suspicion and guilt away from themselves.
CALL.
Both cannot be done.
MEG.
Why so ?
CALL.
Do you ask ?
I am the keeper of my own heart, so as not to admit guilt there ;
suspicion is centred in the heart of another.
For if now I should suspect that you had stolen the crown from the head of Jupiter in the Capitol1, the statue which stands on the highest summit of the temple;
if you had not done so, and still it should please me to sus­ pect you, how could you prevent me from suspecting you ?
But I am anxious to know what this matter is.
MEA
Have you any friend or intimate acquaintance whose juldgment is correct ?
CALL.
Troth, I'll tell you without reserve.
There are some whom I know to be friends;
there are some whom I suspect to be so, but whose dispositions and feelings I am unable to discover, whether they incline to the side of a friend or an enemy ;
but of my assured friends, you are the most assured.
If you know that I have done anything un­ wittingly or wrongfully, and if you do not accuse me of it, then you yourself will be to blame.
MEG.
I know it;
and if I had come hither to you for any other purpose, you request what is right.
CALL.
If you have anything to say, I am waiting for it.
MEG.
Then, first of all, you are badly spoken of in general conversation by the public.
Your fellow-citizens are call­ ing you greedy of grovelling gain1;
and then, again, there are others who nickname you a vulture2, and say that you care but little whether you devour enemies or fellow-citizens.
Since I have heard these things said against you, I have, to my misery, been sadly agitated.
CALL.
It is, and it is not, in my power, Megaronides :
as to their saying this, that is not in my power;
as to their saying this deservedly, that is in my power.
MEG.
Was this Charmides a friend of yours ?
(-He points to the house of CHARMIDES.)CALL.
He both is and he was.
That you may believe it to be so, I will tell you a circumstance as a proof.
For after this son of his had squandered away his fortune, and he saw himself being reduced to poverty, and that his daugh­ ter was grown up a young woman, and that she who was both her mother and his own wife was dead;
as he himself was about to go hence to Seleucia3, he committed to my charge the maiden his daughter, and all his property, and that profligate son.
These, I think, he would not have en­ trusted to me if he had been unfriendly to me.
MEG.
What say you as to the young man, who you see to be thus profligate, and who has been entrusted to your care and confidence ?
Why do you not reform him ?
Why do you not train him to frugal habits ?
It would have been somewhat more just for you to give attention to that matter, if you could have somehow made him a better man, and not for you yourself to be a party to the same disreputable con­ duct, and share your dishonour with his disgrace ?
CALL.
What have I done ?
MEG.
That which a bad man would do.
CALL.
That is no name of mine.
MEG.
Have you not bought this house from that young man ?
(A pause.)
Why are you silent ?
This, where you yourself are now living.
(He points to the house of CHAR­ MIDES.)CALL.
I did buy it, and I gave the money for it,-forty mime!, to the young man himself, into his own hand.
MEG.
You gave the money, do you say ?
MEG.
I' faith—a young man committed to untrusty keep­ ing.
Have you not by these means given him a sword with which to slay himself?
For, prithee, what else is it, your giving ready money to a young man who loves women, and weak in intellect, with which to complete his edifice of folly which he had already commenced ?
CALL.
Ought I not to have paid him the money ?
AEG.
You ought not to have paid him;
nor ought you either to have bought anything of or sold anything to him;
nor should you have provided him with the means of be­ coming worse.
Have you not taken in the person who was entrusted to you ?
Have you not driven out of his house the man who entrusted him to you ?
By my faith, a pretty trust, and a faithful guardianship!
Leave him to take care of himself;
he would manage his own affairs much better.
CALL.
You overpower me, Megaronides, with your accu­ sations, in a manner so strange, that what was privately en­ trusted to my secrecy, fidelity, and constancy, for me to tell it to no one, nor make it public, the same I am now corn polled to entrust to you.
MEG.
Whatever you shall entrust to me, you shall take up the same where you have laid it down.
CALL.
Look round you, then, that no overlooker may be near us (MEGARONIDES looks on every side) ;
and look around every now and then, I be,, of you.
lEG.
I am listening if you have aught to say.
CALL.
If you will be silent, I will speak.
At the time when Charmides set out hence for foreign parts, he showed me a treasure in this house, here in a certain closet(He starts as.
if he hears a noise.)
But do look' around.
MEG.
There is no one.
CALL.
Of Philippean piecesl to the number of three thou­ sand.
Alone with myself, in tears, he entreated me, by our friendship and by my honour, not to entrust this to his son, nor yet to any one, from whom that might come to his knowledge.
Now, if he comes back hither safe, I will restore to him his own.
But if anything should happen to him, at all events I have a stock from which to give a marriage- portion to his daughter, who has been entrusted to me, that I may settle her in a condition of life that befits her.
MEG. 0 ye immortal gods!
how soon, in a few words, you have made another man of me;
I came to you quite a different person.
But, as you have begun, proceed further to inform me.
CALL.
What shall I tell you ?
How that this worthless fellow had almost utterly ruined his caution and my own trustiness and all the secret.
CALL.
Because, while I was in the country for only six days, in my absence and without my knowledge, without consulting me, he advertised with bills:
this house for sale.
MEa.
The wolf hungered the more, and opened his mouth the wider;
he watched till2 the dog went to sleep;
and intended to carry off the whole entire flock.
CALL.
I' faith, he would have done it, if the dogs had not perceived this in time.
But now, in my turn, I wish to ask you this:
let me know what it was my duty for me to do.
Whether was it right for me to discover the treasure to him, against which very thing his father had cautioned me, or should I have permitted another person to become the owner of this house ?
Ought that money to have belonged to him who bought the house ?
In preference, I myself bought the house;
I gave the money for the sake of the treasure, that I might deliver it safe to my friend.
I have not, then, bought this house either for myself or for my own use ;
for Char­ mides have I bought it back again ;
from my own store have I paid the money.
This, whether it has been done right­ fully or wrongfully, I own, Megaronides, that I have done.
Here, then, are my misdeeds ;
here, then, is my avarice.
Is it for these things that they spread false reports against me ?
MEa.
Stay-you have overcome your corrector.
You have tied my tongue;
there is nothing for me to say in answer.
CALL.
Now I entreat you to aid me with your assistance and counsel, and to share this duty of mine in common with me.
MEG.
I promise you my assistance.
CALL.
Where, then, will you be a short time hence ?
MEG.
At home.
CALL.
Do you wish anything else ?
MEG.
Attend to the trust reposed in you.
CALL.
That is being carefully done.
MEG.
But how say you?
jCALL.
What do vou want ?
MEG.
Where is the young man living now ?
CALL.
This back part1 of the building he retained when he sold the house.
MEG.
That I wanted to know.
Now, then, go at once.
But what say you, where is the damsel now?
She is at your house, I suppose ?
CALL.
She is so;
I take care of her almost as much as of my own daughter.
MEG.
You act properly.
CALL.
Before I go away, are you going to ask me any­ thing else ?
MEG.
Farewell.
(Exit CALLICLES.)
Really, there is nothing more foolish or more stupid, nothing more lying or indeed more tattling, more self-conceited or more forsworn, than those men of this city everlastingly gossiping about, whom they call Busybodies2.
And thus have I enlisted myself in their ranks together with them;
who have been the swallower of the false tales of those who pretend that they know every­ thing, and yet know nothing.
They know,forsooth, what each person either has in his mind, or is likely to have ;
they know what the king whispered in the ear of the queen ;
they know what Juno talked about in conversation with Jupiter;
that which neither is nor is likely to be, do these fellows know.
Whether they praise or dispraise any one they please, falsely or truly, they care not a straw, so they know that which they choose to know.
All people were in the habit of saying that this Callicles was unworthy of this state, and, himself, to exist, who had despoiled this young man of his property.
From the reports of these tale-bearers, in my ignorance I rushed forward to rebuke my guiltless friend.
But if the authority was always required from the foundation, upon which they speak of anything they have heard, unless that clearly appeared, the matter ought to be to the peril and loss of the tale-bearer.
If this were so, it would be for the public benefit.
I would cause those to be but few, who know that which they do not know1, and I would make them have their silly chattering more restricted.
(Exit.LYS.
I am revolving many things in my mind at once, and much uneasiness do I find in thinking upon them.
I tease, and fret, and wear myself out;
a mind that enjoins a hard task2 is now my master.
But this thing is not clear to me, nor has it been enough studied by me, which pursuit of these two I should rather follow for myself;
which of the two I should think of the greater stability for passing my life therein :
whether it were preferable for me to devote myself to love or to aggrandisement;
in which alternative there is more enjoyment of life in passing one's days.
On this point I am not fully satisfied.
But this I think I'll do, that I may weigh both the points together, I must be both judge and culprit in this trial:
I'll do so—I like it much.
First of all, I will enlarge upon the pursuits of love, how they conduce to one's welfare.
Love never expects any but the willing man to throw himself in his toils;
these he seeks for, these he follows up, and craftily counsels against their interests.
HE is a fawning flatterer, a rapacious grappler3, a deceiver, a sweet-tooth, a spoiler, a corrupter of men who court retire­ ment, a pryer into secrets.
For he that is in love, soon as ever he has been smitten with the kisses of the object that he loves, forthwith his substance vanishes out of doors and melts away. "
Give me this thing1, my honey, if you love me, if you possibly can."
And then this gudgeon says:
" 0 apple of my eye, be it so:
both that shall be given you, and still more, if you wish it to be given."
Then does she strike while he is wavering2;
and now she begs for more.
Not enough is this evil, unless there is still something more-what to eat, what to drink.
A thing that creates3 afurther expense, the favour of a night is granted;
a whole family is then introduced for her—a wardrobe-woman4, a perfume-keeper5, a cofferer, fan-bearers6, sandal-bearers7, singing-girls, casket- keepersl, messengers, news-carriers, so many wasters of his bread and substance.
The lover himself, while to them he is complaisant, becomes a beggar.
When I revolve these things in my mind, and when I reflect how little one is valued when he is in need;
away with you, Love—I like you not -no converse do I hold with you.
Although 'tis sweet to feast and to carouse, Love still gives bitters enough to be distasteful.
He avoids the Courts2 of justice, he drives away your relations, and drives yourself away from your own contemplation.
Nor do men wish that he should be called their friend.
In a thousand ways is Love to be held a stranger, to be kept at a distance, and to be wholly abstained from.
For he who plunges into love, perishes more dreadfully than if he leapt from a rock.
Away with you, Love, if you please ;
keep your owns property to yourself.
Love, never be you a friend of mine ;
some there are, however, whom, in their misery, you may keep miserable and wretched-those whom you have easily rendered submissive to yourself.
My fixed determination is to apply my mind to my advancement in life, although, in that, great labour is undergone by the mind.
Good men wish these things for themselves, gain, credit, and honour, glory, and esteem;
these are the rewards of the up­ right.
It delights me, then, the more, to live together with the upright rather than with the deceitful promulgators of lies.
PHIL. (looking about).
Where has this man betaken himself out of doors from the house ?
Lys. (coming up to him).
I am here, father;
command me what you will, and I shall cause no delay to you, nor will I hide myself in any skulking-place out of your sight.
PHIL.
You will be doing what is consonant to the rest of your conduct if you reverence your father.
By your duty to me, my son, I wish you, for my sake, not to hold any con­ verse with profligate men, either in the street or in the Forum.
I know this age-what its manners are.
The bad man wishes the good man to be bad, that he may be like himself.
The wicked, the.
rapacious, the covetous, and the envious, disorder and confound the morals of the age:
a crew gaping for gain, they hold the sacred thing as profane-the public advantage as the private emolument.
At these things do I grieve, these are the matters that torment me.
These things am I constantly repeating both day and night, that you may use due precaution against them.
They only deem it right to keep their hands off that which they cannot touch with their hands ;
as to the rest, seize it, carry it off, keep it, be off and go hide, that is the word with them.
These things, when I behold them, draw tears from me, because I have survived to see such a race of men.
Why have I not rather descended to the dead1 ere this ?
For these men praise the manners of our ancestors, and defile those same persons whom they commend.
With regard, then, to these pursuits, I enjoin you not to taint your disposition with them.
Live after my fashion, and according to the ancient manners ;
what I am prescribing to you, the same do you remember and practise.
I have no patience with these fashionable iran­ ners, upsetting preconceived notions, with which good men are now disgracing themselves.
If you follow these my in­ junctions to you, many a good maxim will take root in your breast.
LYS.
From my earliest youth, even up to this present age, I have always, father, paid all submission to the injunc­ tions you have given.
So far as my nature was concerned, I considered that I was free ;
so far as your injunctions were concerned, I deemed it proper that my mind should pay all submission to you.
PHIL.
The man who is struggling with his inclination from his earliest age, whether he ought to prefer to be so, as his inclination thinks it proper that he should be, or whether, rather so as his parents and his relations wish him to be-if his inclination conquers that man, it is all over with him;
he is the slave of his inclination and not of himself.
But if he conquers his inclination, he truly lives and shall be famed as a conqueror of conquerors.
If you have conquered your in­ clination rather than your inclination you, you have reason to rejoice.
'Tis better by far that you should be such as you ought to be, than such as pleases your inclination.
Those who conquer the inclination will ever be esteemed better men than those whom the inclination subdues.
Lys.
I have ever esteemed these maxims as the shield of my youthful age;
never to betake myself to any place where vice was the order of the dayl, never to go to stroll about at night, nor to take from another that which is his.
I have taken all precautions, my father, that I might not cause you uneasiness;
I have ever kept your precepts in due pre­ servation2 by my own rule of conduct.
PHIL.
And do you reproach me, because you have acted aright ?
For yourself have you done so, not for me:
my life, indeed, is nearly past3;
this matter principally concerns your own.
Keep on overlaying4 good deeds with other good deeds, that the rain may not come through.
He is the up­ right man who is not content with it, however upright and however honest he may chance to be.
He who readily gives satisfaction to himself, is not the upright man, nor is he really honest:
he who thinks but meanly of himself, in him is there a tendency to well-doing.
Lys.
For this reason, father, I have thought that since there is a certain thing that I wish for, I would request it of you.
PHIL.
What is it ?
I am already longing to give assent.
LYS.
A young man here, of noble family, my friend and years' mate, who has managed his own affairs but heedlessly and unthinkingly—I wish, father, to do him a service, if you are not unwilling.
PHIL.
From your own means, I suppose ?
Lys.
From my own means—for what is yours is mine, and all mine is yours.
PHIL.
What is he doing ?
Is he in want ?
Lys.
He is in want.
PHIL.
Had he property ?
Lys.
He had.
PHIL.
How did he lose it ?
Was he connected with pub­ lie businessl, or with commercial matters ?
Had he merchan­ dise or wares to sell, when he lost his property ?
Lys.
None of these.
PHIL.
What then ?
LYS.
I' faith, my father, by his good-nature.
Besides, to indulge his tastes, he wasted some part of it in luxury.
PHIL.
By my troth now !
a fellow spoken of boldly, and as, on familiar terms ;
-one, indeed, who has never dissipated his fortune by any good means, and is now in want.
I cannot brook that, with qualities of that description, he should be your friend.
Lys.
'Tis because he is without any bad disposition that I wish to relieve his wants.
PHIL.
He deserves ill of a beggar who gives him what to eat or to drink;
for he both loses that which he gives and prolongs for the other a life of misery.
I do not say this because I am unwilling and would not readily do what you desire;
but when I apply these expressions to that same person, I am warning you beforehand, so to have com­ passion on others, that others may not have to pity you.
Lys.
I am ashamed to desert him, and to deny him aid in his adversity.
PHIL.
I' troth, shame is preferable to repentance by just as many letters1 as it consists of.
Lys.
In good sooth, father, by the care of the Gods, and of my forefathers, and your own, I may say that we possess much property, honestly obtained.
If you do a service to a friend, it ought not to make you repent that you have done so;
it ought rather to cause you shame if you do not do it.
PHIL.
If from great wealth you subtract something, does it become more or less ?
Lys.
Less, father.
But do you know what is wont to be repeated to the niggardly citizen2 ? "
That which thou hast mayst thou not have, and mayst thou have that misfortune which thou hast not;
since thou canst neither endure it to be enjoyed by thyself nor by another."
PHIL.
I know, indeed, that so it usually is :
but, my son, he is the truly niggardly man3 that has nought with which to pay his dues.
Lys.
By the care of the Gods, we have, father, both enough for us to enjoy ourselves, and with which to do kind offices to kind-hearted men.
PHIL.
Troth, I am not able to refuse you anything that you ask of me.
Whose poverty do you wish to relieve?
Speak out boldly to your father.
LYS.
That of this young man Lesbonicus, the son of Charmides, who lives there.
(He points to the house of CHARMIDES.)PHIL.
Why, hasn't he devoured both what he had, and what he had not!
?
Lys.
Censure him not, my father:
many things happen to a man which he likes, many, too, which he does not like.
PHIL.
Troth, you say falsely, son;
and you are doing so now not according to your usual wont.
For the prudent man, i' faith, really frames his own fortunes for himself:
many things, therefore, do not happen which he does not like, unless he is a bungling workman.
Lys.
Much labour is requisite for this workmanship in him who seeks to be a clever workman in fashioning his life­ but he is still very young.
PHIL.
Not by years but by disposition is wisdom acquired.
Age is the relish of wisdom-wisdom is the nutriment of old age.
However, come, say what you wish now to give him.
LYS.
Nothing at all, father.
Do you only not hinder me from accepting it if he should give anything to me.
PHIL.
And will you be relieving his poverty by that, if you shall accept anything of him ?
LYS.
By that very means, my father.
PHIL.
Faith, I wish that you would instruct me in that method.
Lys. Certainly.
Do you know of what family he is born ?
PHIL.
I know-of an extremely honourable one.
Lys.
He has a sister—A fine young woman now grown up:
I wish, father, to take her without a portion for my wife.
PHIL.
A wife without a portion ?
Lys.
Just so-your riches saved as well.
By these means you will be conferring an extreme favour on him, and in no way could you help him to greater advantage.
PHIL.
Am I to suffer you to take a wife without a portion ?
LYS.
You must suffer it, father;
and by these means you will be giving an estimable character to our family.
PHIL.
I could give utterance to many a learned saying, and very fluently too :
this old age of mine retains stories of old and ancient times..
But, since I see that you are courting friendship and esteem for our family, although I have been opposed to you, I thus give my decision—I will permit you;
ask for the girl, and marry her.
Lys.
May the Gods preserve you to me.
But, to this favour add one thing.
PHIL.
But what is this one thing ?
LYS.
I will tell you.
Do you go to him, do you solicit him, and do you ask for her yourself..
PHIL.
Think of that now.
Lys.
You will transact it much more speedily:
all will-be made sure of that you do.
One word of yours in this matter will be of more consequence than a hundred of mine.
PHIL.
See, now, how, in my kindness, I have undertaken this matter.
My assistance shall be given.
LYS.
You really are a kind father.
This is the house;
here he dwells.
(He points to the house of CHARMIDES.)
Lesbonicus is his name.
Mind and attend to the business;
I will await you at home.
(Exit.PHIL.
These things are not for the best, nor as I think they ought to be;
but still, they are better than that which is downright bad.
But this one circumstance consoles myself and my thoughts—namely, that he who counsels in respect to a son nothing else but that which pleases himself alone, only plays the fool;
he becomes wretched in mind, and yet he is no nearer bringing it about.
He is preparing a very incle­ ment winter for his own old age when he arouses that unsea­ sonable storm.
(The door of the house of CHARMIDES opens.)
But the house is opened to which I was going ;
most conve­ niently, Lesbonicus himself is coming out of doors with his servant.
(PHILTO retires to a distance.)LESB.
'Tis less than fifteen days since you received from Callicles forty minæ for this house ;
is it not as I say, Sta. simus ?
STAS.
When I consider, I think I remember that it was so.
LESB.
What has been done with it ?
STAS.
It has been eaten and drunk up—spent away in unguents, washed away in baths1.
The fishmonger and the baker have carried it off:
butchers, too, and cooks, green­ grocers, perfumers, and poulterers;
'twas quickly consumed.
I' faith!
that money was made away with not less speedily than if you were to throw a poppy among the ants.
LESB.
By my troth, less has been spent on those items than six minæ ?
STAS.
Besides, what have you given to your mistresses ?
LESB.
That I am including as well in it.
STAS.
Besides, what have I pilfered of it ?
LESB.
Aye, that item is a very heavy one.
STAS.
That cannot so appear to you, if you make all due deductions2, unless you think that your money is everlasting.
(Aside.)
Too late and unwisely,-a caution that should have been used before,-after he has devoured his substance, he reckons up the account too late.
LESB.
The account, however, of this money is by no means clear.
STAS.
I' faith, the account is very clear:
the money's gones.
Did you not receive forty minæ from Callicles, and did he not receive from you the house in possession PLESB.
Very good.
PHILTO (aside).
Troth, I think our neighbour has sold his housed
When his father shall come from abroad, his place is in the beggar's gate2, unless, perchance, he should creep into his son's stomach3.
STAS.
There were a thousand Olympic drachma paid to the banker5, which you were owing upon account.
LESB.
Those, I suppose, that I was security for1 ?
STAS.
Say, rather2, " Those that I paid down“—for that young man whom you used to say3 was so rich.
LESB.
It was so done.
STAS.
Yes, just to be squandered away.
LESB.
That was done as well.
But I saw him in a pitiable state, and I did have pity on him.
STAS.
You have pity on others, and you have neither pity nor shame for yourselfPHIL. (aside).
'Tis time to accost him.
LESB.
Is this Philto that is coming here ?
Troth, 'tis he himself.
STAS.
I' faith, I could wish he was my slave, together with his savings4.
PHIL.
Philto right heartily wishes health to both master and servant, Lesbonicus and Stasimus.
LESB.
May the Gods give you, Philto, whatever you may wish for.
How is your son ?
PHIL.
He wishes well to you.
LESB.
In good sooth, he does for me what I do for him in return!
STAS. (aside).
That phrase, "He wishes well," is worth­ less, unless a person does well too.
I, too, " wish" to be a free man;
I wish in vain.
He, perhaps, might wish to become frugal;
he would wish to no purpose.
PHIL.
My son has sent me to you to propose an alliance and bond of friendship between himself and your family.
He wishes to take your sister for his wife;
and I have the same feelings, and I desire it.
LESB.
I really don't understand your ways;
amid your prosperity you are laughing at my adversity.
PHIL.
I am a man1:
you are a man.
So may Jupiter love me, I have neither come to laugh at you, nor do I think you deserving of it!
But as to what I said, my son begged me to ask for your sister as his wife.
LESB.
It is right that I should know the state of my own circumstances.
My position is not on an equal footing with yours ;
seek some other alliance for yourselves.
STAS. (to LESBONICUS).
Are you really sound in mind or intellect to refuse this proposal ?
For I perceive that he has been found for you a very friend in need2.
LESB.
Get away hence, and go hang yourself3,STAS.
Faith, if I should commence to go, you would be forbidding me4.
LESB.
Unless you want me, Philto, for anything else, I have given you my answer.
PHIL.
I trust, Lesbonicus, that you will one day be more obliging to me than I now find you to be.
For both to act6 unwisely and to talk unwisely, Lesbonicus, are sometimes neither of them profitable.
STAS.
Troth, he says what's true.
LESB.
I will tear out your eye if you add one word.
STAS.
Troth, but I will talk;
for if I may not be allowed to do so as I am, then I will submit to be called the one-eyed man1,PHIL.
Do you now say this, that your position and means are not on an equal footing with ours ?
LESB.
I do say so.
PHIL.
Well, suppose, now, you were to come to a building to a public banquet, and a wealthy man by chance were to come there as your neighbour2.
The banquet is set on table, one that they style a public one3.
Suppose that dainties were heaped up before him by his dependents, and suppose any­ thing pleased you that was so heaped up before him, would you eat, or would you keep your place next to this wealthy man, going without your dinner ?
LESB.
I should eat, unless he were to forbid me doing so.
STAS.
But I, by my faith, even if he were to forbid me, would eat and cram with both cheeks stuffed out;
and what pleased him, that, in especial, would I lay hold of beforehand;
nor would I yield to him one jot of my very existence.
At table it befits no one to be bashful;
for there the decision.
is about things both divine and human.
PHIL.
You say what is the fact.
STAB.
I will tell you without any subterfuge:
I would make place for him on the highway, on the footpath, in the canvass for public honors;
but as to what concerns the stomach-by my troth, not this much (shows the breadth of hisfinger-nail), unless he should first have thrashed me with his fists.
With provisions at the present prices, a feast is a fortune without incumbrances 1.
PHIL.
Always, Lesbonicus, do you take care and think this, that that is the best, according as you yourself are the most deserving:
if that you cannot attain to, at least be as near as possible to the most deserving.
And now, Lesboni­ cus, I wish you to grant and accept these terms which I propose, and which I ask of you.
The Gods are rich;
wealth and station befit the Gods:
but we poor mortal beings are, as it were, the salt-cellar2 for the salt of life.
The moment that we have breathed forth this, the beggar is held of equal value at Acheron3 with the most wealthy man when dead.
STAS. (aside).
It will be a wonder if you don't carry your riches there with you.
When you are dead, you may, perhaps, be as good as your name imports4.
PHIL.
Now, that you may understand that position and means have no place here, and that we do not undervalue your alliance;
I ask for your sister without a marriage- portion.
May the matter turn out happily.
Do I under­ stand her to be promised ?
Why are you silent ?
PHIL.
Why don't you say, "May the Gods prosper it.
I agree1 ?"STAS. (aside).
Alas!
when there was no advantage in the expression, he used to say, " I agree;
" now, when there is ad­ vantage in it, he is not able to say so.
LESB.
Since you think me, Philto, worthy of an alliance with you, I return you many thanks.
But though this fortune of mine has sadly diminished through my folly, I have, Philto, a piece of land near the city here;
that I will give as a portion to my sister:
for, after all my follies, that alone, besides my existence, is left me.
PUlL.
Really I care nothing at all about a portion.
LESB.
I am determined to give her one.
STAS. (whispers to LESBONICUS).
And are you ready, master, to sever that nurse from us which is supporting us ?
Take care how you do it.
What are we ourselves to eat in future ?LESB. (to STASIMUS).
Once more, will you hold your tongue ?
Am I to be rendered accountable to you ?STAS. (aside).
We are evidently done for, unless I devise something or other.
Philto, I want you.
(-Be removes to a distance, and beckons to PHILTO.)PHIL.
If you wish aught, Stasimus.
STAS.
Step a little this way.
PHIL.
By all means.
STAS.
I tell you this in secrecy, that neither he nor any one else may learn it of you.
PHIL.
Trust me boldly with anything you please.
STAS.
By Gods and men I warn you, not to allow that piece of land ever to become yours or your son's.
I'll tell you my reasons 'for this matter.
PHIL.
Troth, I should like to hear them.
STAB.
First of all then, when at any time the ground is being ploughed, in every fifth furrow the oxen die.
PHIL.
Preserve me from it.
STAS.
The gate of Acheron is in that land of ours.
Then the grapes, before they are ripe, hang in a putrid state.
LESB. (in a low voice).
He is persuading the man to some­ thing, I think.
Although he is a rogue, still he is not un­ faithful to me.
STAS.
Hear the rest.
Besides that, when elsewhere the harvest of wheat is most abundant, there it comes up less by one-fourth than what you have sowed.
PHIL.
Ah!
bad habits ought to be sown on that spot, if in the sowing they can be killed.
STAS.
And never is there any person to whom that piece of land belongs, but that his affairs turn out most unfor­ tunate.
Of those to whom it has belonged, some have gone away in banishment;
some are dead outright;
some, again, have banged themselves.
See this man, now, to whom it belongs, how he has been brought to a regular backgammoned statedPHIL.
Preserve me from this piece of land.
STAS. "
Preserve me from it," you would say still more, if you were to hear everything from me.
For there every other tree has been blasted with lightning;
the hogs die2 there most shockingly of inflammation in the throat;
the sheep are scabby, as bare of all wool, see, as is this hand of mine.
And then, besides, there is not one of the Syrian natives3, a race which is the most hardy of men, who could exist there for six months;
so surely do all die there of the solstitial fever1.
PHIL.
I believe, Stasimus2, that it is so;
but the Campa­ nian3 race much outdoes that of the Syrians in hardiness.
But, really, that piece of land, as I have heard you describe it, is one to which it were proper for all wicked men to be sent for the public good.
Just as they tell of the Islands of the Blest, where all meet together who have passed their lives uprightly:
on the other hand, it seems proper that all evil­ doers should be packed off there, since it is a place of such a character.
STAS.
'Tis a very receptacle of calamity.
What need is there of many words ?
Look for any bad thing whatsoever, there you may find it.
PHIL.
But, i' faith, you may find it there and elsewhere too.
STAS.
Please, take care not to say that I told you of this.
PHIL.
You have told it me in perfect secrecy.
STAS.
For he, indeed (pointing at LESBONICUS), wishes it to be got rid of from himself, if he can find auy one to im­ pose upon4 about it.
PHIL.
I' faith, this land shall never become my property.
STAS.
Aye, if you keep in your senses.
(Aside.)
I' faith, I have cleverly frightened5 the old fellow away from this land;
for, if my master had parted with it, there is nothing for us to live upon.
PHIL.
Lesbonicus, I now return to you.
LESB.
Tell me, if you please, what has he been saying to you?
PHIL.
What do you suppose ?
He is a man1;
he wishes to become a free man, but he has not the money to give.
LESB.
And I wish to be rich, but all in vain.
STAS. (aside).
You might have been, if you had chosen;
now, since you have nothing, you cannot be.
LESB.
What are you talking about to yourself, Stasimus ?
STAS.
About that which you were saying just now:
if you had chosen formerly, you might have been rich;
now you are wishing too late.
PHIL.
No terms can be come to with me about the mar­ riage-portion ;
whatever pleases you, do you transact it your­ self with my son.
Now, I ask for your sister for my son;
and may the matter turn out well.
What now ?
are you still considering ?
LESB.
What-about that matter ?
Since you will have it so-may the Gods prosper it—I promise her.
PHIL.
Never, by my troth, was a son born so ardently longed for by any one, as was that expression " I promise her," when born for me.
STAS.
The Gods will prosper all your plans.
PHIL.
So I wish.
Come this way with me, Lesbonicus, that a day may be agreed on for the nuptials, in the presence of Lysiteles :
this agreement we will ratify on that same day.
LESB.
Now, Stasimus, go you there (points to the house which he has sold to CALLICLES) to the house of Callicles, to my sister;
tell her how this matter has been arranged.
STAS.
I will go.
LESB.
And congratulate my sister.
STAS.
Very well.
LESB.
Tell Callicles to meet meSTAS.
But rather do you go nowLESB.
That he may see what is necessary to be done about the portion.
STAS.
Do go now.
LESB.
For I have determined not to give her without a portion.
STAS.
But rather do you go now.
LESB.
And I will never allow it to be a detriment to her by reason of-STAS.
Do be off now.
LESB.
ALly recklessness-STAS.
Do go now1.
LESB.
It seems by no means just, but that, since I have done wrongSTAS.
Do go now.
LESB.
It should be chiefly a detriment to myself.
STAS.
Do go now.
LESB.
0 my father!
and shall I ever see you again ?
SUB.
Do go now.
Go—go now.
LESB.
I am going.
Do you take care of that which I have asked you.
I shall be here directly.
(Exit LESBONICUS.
STAS.
At length I have prevailed on him to go.
In the name of the immortal Gods, i' faith, 'tis a matter well ma­ naged by wrongful means of performance, inasmuch as our piece of land is safe;
although even now 'tis still a very doubtful matter what may be the result of this affair.
But, if the land is parted with, 'tis all over2 with my neck ;
I must carry a buckler in foreign lands, a helmet too, and my bag­ gage.
He will be running away from the city when the nuptials have been celebrated;
lie will be going hence to extreme and utter ruin, somewhere or other, to serve as a soldier, either to Asia or to Cilicia3.
I will go there (looking at the door of the house bought by CALLICLES), where he has ordered me to go, although I detest this house ever since he has driven us out of our abode.
(Exit into the house of CHARMIDES.
CALL.
To what effect were you speaking about this, Sta­ simus ?
STAS.
That Lesbonicus, the son of my master, has betrothed his sister ;
in those terms.
CALL.
To what person has he betrothed her ?
STAB.
To Lysiteles, the son of Philto ;
without a portion, too.
CALL.
Without a portion, will he marry her into a family so rich1 ?
You are telling me a thing not to be credited.
STAS.
Why, faith, you would be for never believing.
If you don't believe this, at all events I shall be believing-CALL.
What ?
STAS.
That I don't care a fig for your belief.
CALL.
How long since, or where, was this matter agreed to ?
STAS.
On this very spot—here, before his door (pointing to PHILTO'S house).
This moment-like2, as the man of Præ­ neste says.
CALL.
And has Lesbonicus, amid his ruined fortunes, be­ come so much more frugal than in his prosperous circum­ stances ?
STAS.
Why, in fact, Philto himself came of his own accord to make the offer for his son.
CALL. (aside.)
By my troth, it really will be a disgrace, if a portion is not given to the maiden.
In fine, I think, i' faith, that that matter concerns myself.
I will go to my corrector, and will ask advice of him.
(Exit.STAS.
I pretty nearly guess, and I have a strong suspicion, why he makes such speed on this :
namely, that he may turn Lesbonicus out of his bit of land, after he has turned him out of his house.
0 Charmides, my master!
since your pro­ perty here is being torn to pieces in your absence, I wish I could see you return safe, that you might both take vengeance on your enemies, and give the reward to me according as I have behaved, and do behave towards you.
'Tis an ex­ tremely difficult thing for a friend to be found really such as the name imports, to whom, when you have entrusted your interests, you may sleep without any care.
But lo!
I per­ ceive our son-in-law1 coming, together with his neighbour.
Something-what, I know not-is wrong between them.
They are walking, each with a hasty step;
the one is catch­ in,, the other that is before him by the cloak.
They have come to a stop in no very courteous fashion.
I'll step aside here a little distance.
I have a wish to hear the conversation of these two that are to be connected by marriage.
(He retires to a distance.)
Lys.
Stay, this moment;
don't turn away, and don't hide yourself from me.
(He catches hold of his cloak.)LESB. (shaking him off).
Can't you allow me to go whither I was proceeding ?
LYS.
If, Lesbonicus, it seems to be to your interest, either for your glory or for your honour, I will let you go.
LESB.
You are doing a thing that it is very easy to do.
Lys.
What is that ?
LESB.
An injury to a friend.
Lys.
It is no way of mine, and I have not learned so to do.
LESB.
Untaught as you are, how cleverly you do it.
What would you have done, if any one had taught you to be thus annoying to me ?
You, who, when you pretend to be acting kindly to me, use me ill, and are intending evil.
LYS.
What !—I ? LESB.
Yes—you.
LESB.
Inasmuch as you do that which I do not wish.
Lys.
I wish to consult your advantage.
LESB.
Are you kinder to me than I am to myself?
I have sense enough;
I see sufficiently well those things that are for my own advantage.
Lys.
And is it having sense enough to refuse a kindness from a well-wisher ?
LESB.
I reckon it to be no kindness, when it does not please him on whom you are conferring it.
I know, and I understand myself what I am doing, and my mind forsakes not its duty;
nor will I be driven by your speeches from paying due regard to my own character.
LYS.
What do you say ?
For now I cannot be restrained from saying to you the things which you deserve.
Have your forefathers, I pray, so handed down this reputation to you, that you, by your excesses, might lose what before was gained by their merit, and that you might become a bar to the honour of your own posterity ?
Your father and your grandfather made an easy and a level path for you to attain to honour;
whereas you have made it to become a difficult one, by your extreme recklessness and sloth, and your besotted ways.
You have made your election, to prefer your passions to virtue.
Now, do you suppose that you can cover over your faults by these means ?
Alas!
'tis impossible.
Wel­ come virtue to your mind, if you please, and expel slothful­ ness from your heart.
Give your attention to your he­ friends in the Courts of justicel, and not to the couch of your she-friend, as you are wont to do.
And earnestly do I now wish this piece of land to be left to you for this reason, that you may have wherewithal to reform yourself;
so that those citizens, whom you have for enemies, may not be able altogether to throw your poverty in your teeth.
LESB.
All these things which you have been saying, I know.-could even set my seal2 to them :
how I have spoiled my patrimonial estate and the fair fame of my forefathers.
I knew how it became me to live ;
to my misfortune I was not able to act accordingly.
Thus, overpowered by the force of passion, inclined to ease, I fell into the snare;
and now to you, quite as you deserve, I do return most hearty thanks.
LYS.
Still, I cannot suffer my labour to be thus lost, anc yourself to despise these words ;
at the same time, it grieves me that you have so little shame.
And, in fine, unless you listen to me, and do this that I mention, you yourself will easily lie concealed behind your own self, so that honour cannot find you;
when you will wish yourself to be especially distinguished, you will be lying in obscurity.
I know right well, for my part, Lesbonicus, your highly ingenuous dispo­ sition ;
I know that of your own accord you have not done wrong, but that it is Love that has blinded your heart;
and I myself comprehend all the ways of Love.
As the charge of the balistal is hurled, so is Love;
nothing is there so swift, or that so swiftly flies;
he, too, makes the manners of men both foolish and froward2.
That which is the most corn.
mended pleases him the least3;
that from which he is dissuaded pleases him.
When there is a scarcity, then you long for'a thing ;
when there is an abundance of it, then you don't care for it.
The person that warns him off from a thing, the same invites hiin ;
he that persuades him to it interdicts him.
'Tis a misfortune of insanity for you to fly to Cupid for refuge.
But I advise you again and again to think of this, how you should seek to act.
If you attempt to do ac­ cording as you are now showing signs4, you will cause the conflagration of your family;
and then, in consequence, you will have a desire for water with which to quench this con­ flagration of your family.
And if you should obtain it, just as lovers are subtle in their devices, you will not leave even one spark with which your family may brighten up.
LESB.
'Tis easy to be found:
fire is granted, even though you should ask it of a foe.
But you, by your reproof, are urging me from my faults to a viler course.
You are per­ suading me to give you my sister without a portion.
But it does not become me, who have misused so great a patrimony, to be still in affluent circumstances, and to be possessing land, but her to be in want, so as with good reason to detest me.
Never will he be respected by others who makes him­ self despised by his own relatives.
As I said, I will do;
I do not wish you to be in doubt any longer.
Lys.
And is it so much preferable that for your sister's sake you should incur poverty, and that I should possess that piece of land rather than yourself, who ought to be upholding your own walls ?
LESB.
I do not wish you so much to have regard to myself, in order that you may relieve my poverty, as that in my neediness I may not become disgraced:
that people may not spread about this report of me, that I gave my own sister without a portion to you, rather in concubinage1 than in marriage.
Who would be said to be more dishonorable than I ?
The spreading of this report might do credit to you, but it would defile me, if you were to marry her without a por­ tion.
For you it would be a gain of reputation, for me it would be something for people to throw in my teeth.
LYS.
Why so ?
Do you suppose2 that you will become Dictator if I accept the land of you ?
LESB.
I neither wish, nor require, nor do I think so;
but still, to be mindful of his duty, is true honour to an upright man.
Lys.
For my part, I know you, how you are disposed in mind;
I see it, I discover it, I apprehend.
You are doing this, that when you have formed an alliance between us, and when you have given up this piece of land, and have nothing here with which to support life, in beggary you may fly from the city, in exile you may desert your country, your kin­ dred, your connexions, your friends,-the nuptials once over.
People would suppose that you were frightened hence by my means, and through my cupidity.
Do not fancy in your mind that I will act so as to allow that to happen.
STAS. (advancing).
Well, I cannot but exclaim, " Well done, well done, Lysiteles, encorel."
Easily do you win the victory;
the other is conquered:
your performance is supe­ rior.
This one (pointing to LYSITELES) acts better in charac­ ter, and composes better lines2.
By reason of your folly do you still dispute it ?
Stand in awe of the fine.
LESB.
What means this interruption of yours, or your in­ trusion here upon our conversation ?
STAS.
The same way that I came here I'll get me gone.
LESB.
Step this way home with me, Lysiteles;
there we will talk at length about these matters.
LYS.
I am not in the habit of doing anything in secret.
Just as my feelings are I will speak out.
If your sister, as I think it right, is thus given to me in marriage, without a por­ tion, and if you are not about to go away hence, that which shall be mine, the same shall be yours.
But if you are minded otherwise, may that which you do turn out for you for the best.
I will never be your friend on any other terms;
such is my determination.
(Exit LESBONICUS, followed by LYSITELES.
STAB.
Faith, he's off.
D'ye hear—Lysiteles ?
I want you.
He's off as well.
Stasimus, you remain alone.
What am I now to do, but to buckle up my baggage and sling my buckler on my backl, and order soles to be fastened2 beneath my shoes ?
There is no staying now.
I see that no long time hence I shall be a soldier's drudge.
And when my master has thrown himself into the payS of some potentate, I guess that among the greatest warriors he will prove a brave4- hand at running away, and that there he will capture the spoil, who-shall come to attack my master.
I myself, the moment that I shall have assumed my bow and quiver and arrows, and the helmet on my head, shall-go to sleep very quietly in my tent.
I'll be off to the Forum;
I'll ask that talent5 back of the person to whom I lent it six days since, that I may have some provision for the journey to carry with me.
(-Exit.MEG.
According as you relate the matter to me, Callicles, it really can by no means be but that a portion must be given to the girl.
CALL.
Why, troth, it would hardly be honestly done on my part, if I were to allow her to contract a marriage without a portion, when I have her property in my pos.
session at home.
# * * * *MEG. * * * *
A portion is ready at your house ;
unless you like to wait until her brother has dis­ posed of her in marriage without a portion.
After that, you might go to Philto yourself, and might say that you present her with a portion,.
and that you do it on account of your intimacy with her father.
But I dread this, lest that offer might bring you into crimination and disgrace with the public.
They would say that you were so kind to the girl not with­ out some good reason;
that the dowry which you presented her was given you by her father ;
they would think that you were portioning her out of that, and that you had not kept it safe for her just as it was given, and that you had with­ held some part.
Now, if you wish to await the return of Charmides, the time is very long;
meanwhile, the inclination to marry her may leave this Lysiteles ;
this proposal, too, is quite a first-rate one for her.
CALL.
All these very same things suggest themselves to my mind.
MEG.
Consider if you think this more feasible and more to the purpose:
go to the young man himself, and tell him how the matter really stands.
CALL.
Should I now discover the treasure to a young man, ill-regulated, and brimful of passion and of wantonness ?
No, faith, most assuredly, by no means.
For I know, beyond a doubt, that he would devour even all that spot where it is buried.
I fear to dig for it, lest he should hear the noise;
lest, too, he might trace out the matter itself, if I should say I will give her a portion.
MEG.
By what method, then, can the portion be secretly taken out ?
CALL.
Until an opportunity can be found for that business, I would, in the meanwhile, ask for a loan of the money from some friend or other.
MEG.
Can it be obtained from some friend or other ?
CALL.
It can.
MEG.
Nonsense;
you'll certainly meet with this answer at once:
" 0, upon my faith, I really have not anything that I can lend you."CALL.
Troth, I would rather they would tell me the truth than lend me the money with a bad grace.
MEG.
But consider this plan, if it pleases you.
CALL.
What is the plan ?
MEG.
I have found out a clever plan, as I think.
CALL.
What is it ?
MEG.
Let some person, now, be hired, of an appearance as much unknown as possible, such as has not been often seen.
Let this person be dressed up to the life after a foreign fashion, just as though he were a foreigner.
CALL.
What is he to understand that he must do after that ?
MEG.
It is necessary for him to be some lying, de­ ceiving, impudent fellow—a lounger from the Forum.
CALL.
And what then, after that ?
MEG.
Let him come to the young man as though from Seleucia, from his father;
let him pronounce his salutation to him in the words of his father, say that he is prospering in business, and is alive and well, and that he will be shortly coming back again.
Let him bring two letters;
let us seal these, as though they are from his father.
Let him give the one to him, and let him say that he wishes to give the other to yourself.
CALL.
Go on, and tell me still further.
MEG.
Let him say that he is bringing some gold as a marriage-portion from her father for the girl, and that his father has requested him to deliver it to you.
Do you un­ derstand me now ?
CALL.
Pretty nearly;
and I listen with great satisfaction.
MEG.
Then, in consequence, you will finally give the gold to the young man when the girl shall be given in marriage.
CALL.
Troth, 'tis very cleverly contrived.
MEG.
By this means, when you have duct up the trea­ sure, you will have removed all cause for suspicion from the young man.
He will think that the gold has been brought .
to you from his father ;
whereas, you will be taking it from the treasure.
CALL.
Very cleverly and fairly contrived ;
although I am ashamed, at this time of life, for me to be playing a double part.
But when he shall bring the letters sealed, don't you suppose that the young man will then recollect the impres­ sion of his father's signetl ?
MEG.
Will you be silent now?
Reasons innumerable may be found for that circumstance.
That which he used to have he has lost, and he has since had another new one made.
Then, if he should bring them not sealed at all, this might be said,-that they had been unsealed for him by the custom-house officers2, and had been examined.
On matters of this kind, however, 'tis mere idleness to spend the day in talk ;
although a long discussion might be spun out.
Go now, at once, privately to the treasure ;
send to a distance the men-servants and the maids;
and-do you hear ?
CALL.
What is it ?
LEG.
Take care that you conceal this matter from that same wife of yours as well;
for, i' faith, there is never any subject which they can be silent upon.
Why are you standing now ?
Why don't you take yourself off hence, and bestir yourself?
Open the treasure, take thence as much gold as is requisite for this purpose;
at once close it up again, but secretly, as I have enjoined you ;
turn all out of the house.
CALL.
I will do so.
MEG.
But, really, we are continu- ing too long a discourse;
we are wasting the day, whereas there is need now of all expedition.
There is nothing for you to fear about the seal;
trust me for that.
This is a clever excuse to give, as I mentioned, that they have been looked at by the officers.
In fine, don't you see the time of day ?
What do you think of him being of such a nature and disposition ?
He is drunk already;
anything you like may be proved for him.
Besides, what is the greatest point of all, this person will say that he brings, and not that he applies for, money.
CALL.
Now, that's enough.
MEG.
I am now going to hire a sharper!
from the Forum, and then I will seal the two letters;
and I'll send him thither (pointing to the house of CHARMIDES), well tutored in his part, to this young fnan.
CALL.
I am going in-doors then to my duty in consequence.
Do you see about this matter.
MEG.
I'll take care it's done in the very cleverest style.
(Exeunt.
CHARM.
To Neptune, potent o'er the deep and most powerful, the brother of æthereal Jove, joyously and sin- cerely do I proffer praise, and return my grateful thanks;
to the salt waves, too, with whom lay supreme power over myself,—one, too, that existed over my property and my life, -inasmuch as from their realms they have returned me safe and sound even to my own native city.
And, Neptune, be­ fore the other Deities, do I both give and return to you ex­ treme thanks.
For all people talk of you as being cruel and severe, of voracious habits, filthy, unsightly, unendurable, and outrageous;
on the other hand, I have experienced your kindly aid.
For, in good sooth, I have found you mild and merciful upon the deep, even to that degree that I wished.
This commendation, too, I had already heard with these ears before of you among men,—that you were accustomed to spare the poor, and to depress and overawe the rich.
Adieu!
I commend you;
you know how to treat men properly, according as is just.
This is worthy of the Gods;
they should ever prove benignant to the needy;
to men of high station, quite otherwise.
Trusty have you proved, though they are in the habit of saying that you cannot be trusted.
For, without you, it would have happened, I am very sure, that on the deep your attendants would have shockingly torn in pieces and rent asunder wretched me, and, together with me, my property as well, in every direction throughout the azure surface of ocean.
But just now, like raging dogs, and no otherwise, did the winds in hurricane beset the ship;
storms and waves, and raging squalls were about to roar, to break the mast, to bear down the yards, to split the sails;
had not your favouring kindness been nigh at hand.
Have done with me, if you please;
henceforth have I now determined to give myself up to ease;
enough have I got.
With what pains have I struggled, while I was acquiring riches for my son.
But who is this1 that is coming up the street with his new-angled garb and appearance ?
I' faith, though I wish to be at home, I'll wait awhile;
at the same time, I will give my attention to see what business this fellow is about.
(He retires aside.)SHARP.
To this day I give the name of " The Festival of the Three Pieces " (Trinummus) ;
for, on this day, have I let out my services in a cheating scheme for three pieces of money.
I am just arrived from Seleucia, Macedonia, Asia, and Arabia,—places which I never visited either with my eye or with my foot.
See now, what business poverty brings upon the man that is wretchedly destitute;
inasmuch as I am now obliged, for the sake of three pieces of money, to say that I received these letters from a certain person, about whom I don't know, nor have I ever known, who the man is, nor do I know this for certain, whether he was ever born or not.
CHARM. (behind).
Faith, this fellow's surely of the mush­ room genus;
he covers himself entirely with his top1.
The countenance of the fellow appears to be Illyrian;
he comes, too, in that garb.
SHARP.
He who hired me, when he had hired me, took me to his house;
he told me what he wanted to be done;
he taught and showed me beforehand how I was to do every­ thing.
If, then, I should add anything more, my employer will on that account the better forward his plan through me.
As he dressed me out, -so am I now equipped;
his money did that.
He himself borrowed my costume, at his own risk, from the theatrical wardrobe2;
if I shall be able, now, to impose on this man through my garb, I will give him occasion clearly to find that I am a very trickster..
CHAR. (behind).
The more I look at hint, the less does the appearance of the fellow please me.
'Tis a wonder if that fellow there is not either a night-robber1 or a cutpurse.
He is viewing the locality;
he is looking around him and sur­ veying the houses;
troth, I think he is reconnoitring the spot for him to come and rob bye and bye.
I have a still greater desire to watch what he is about:
I'll give attention to this matter.
SHARP.
This employer of mine pointed out these localities to me;
at this house are my devices to be put in practice.
I'll knock at the door.
CHARM. (behind).
Surely this fellow is making in a straight line for my house;
i' faith, I think I shall have to keep watch this night of my arrival.
SHARP. (knocks at the door of the house of CHARMIDES).
Open this door !—open it!
Hallo, there!
who now has the care of this door2 ?
CHARM.. (coming up to him).
Young man, what do you want ?
What is it you wish ?
Why are you knocking at this door ?
SHARP.
Eh!
old gentleman;
I am inquiring here for a young man named Lesbonicus, where in this quarter he lives -and likewise for another person, with such white hairs on his head as yours;
he that gave me these letters said his name was Callicles.
CHARM. (aside).
In fact, this fellow is looking for my own son Lesbonicus and my friend Callicles, to whom I entrusted both my children and my property.
SHARP.
Let me know, respected sir8, if you are acquainted with it, where these persons live.
CHARM.
Why are you inquiring for them ?
Or who are you ?-Or whence are you ?-Or whence do you come ?
SHARP.
I gave the return correctly to the Censor1, when I was questioned by himCHARM.
* * * *SHARP.
You ask a number of things in the same breath;
I know not which in especial to inform you upon.
If you will ask each thing singly, and in a quiet manner, I'll both let you know my name, and my business, and my travels.
CHARM.
I'll do as you desire.
Come then;
in the first place, tell me your name.
SHARP.
You begin by demanding an arduous task.
CHARM.
How so ?
SHARP.
Because, respected sir, if you were to begin before daylight, i' faith, to commence at the first part of my name2, 'twould be the dead of the night before you could get to the end of it.
CHARM.
According to your story, a person should have a long journey's provision crammed tightly in for your name.
SHARP.
I have another name somewhat less,-about the size of a wine-cask3.
CHARM.
What is this name of yours, young man ?
SHARP.
"Hush," that's my name4;
that's my every-day one.
CHARM.
I' faith, 'tis a scampish name;
just as though5 you were to say, " Hush,” if I were confiding anything to you, and then it is at an end forthwith.
(Aside.)
This fellow is evidently a sharper.
What say you, young man?
SHARP.
What is it now ?
CHARM.
Speak out;
what do these persons owe you whom you are seeking ?
SHARP.
The father of this young man, Lesbonicus, de­ livered to me these two letters;
he is a friend of mine.
CHARM. (aside).
I have now caught him in the fact;
he says that I gave him the letters.
I will have some fine sport with the fellow.
SHARP.
As I have begun, if you will give attention, I will say on.
CHARM.
I'll give you my attention.
SHARP.
He bade me give this letter to his son, Lesbonicus, and this other one, as well, he bade me give to his friend Callicles.
CHARM. (aside).
Troth, but since he is acting the impostor, I, on the other hand, have an inclination to act the cheat as well.
Where was he himself?
SHARP.
He was carrying on his business prosperously.
CHARM.
But where ?
SHARP.
At Seleucia.
CHARM.
* * * * *
And did you receive these from himself ?
SHARP.
With his own hands he himself delivered them into my hands.
CHARM.
Of what appearance is this person PSHARP.
He is a person somewhere about half a foot taller than you.
CHARM. (aside).
This is an odd matter, if in fact I am taller when absent than when present.
Do you know this person ?
SHARP.
You are asking me a ridiculous question;
together with him I was in the habit of taking my meals.
CHARM.
What is his name ?
SHARP.
One, i' faith, that belongs to an honorable man.
CHARM.
I would like to hear it.
SHARP.
Troth, his name (hesitating)—his—his— (Aside.)
Woe to unfortunate me.
CHARM.
What's the matter ?
SHARP.
Unguardedly, I this moment swallowed the name.
CHARM.
I like not the man that has his friends shut up within his teeth.
SHARP.
And yet this moment 'twas dwelling on the very edge of my lips.
CHARM. (aside).
I've come to-day in good time before this fellow.
SHARP. (aside).
To my sorrow I'm caught in the fact.
CHARM.
Have you now recollected the name ?
SHARP.
'Fore Gods and men, i' faith, I'm ashamed of myself.
CHARM.
See, now, how well you know this man.
SHARP.
As well as my own self.
This is in the habit of hap­ pening :
the thing you are holding in your hand, and seeing with your eyes, that same you are looking for as lost.
I'll recollect it letter by letter.
C is the beginning of the name.
CHARM.
IS it Callias ?
SHARP.
No :
it isn't that.
CHARM.
Callippus ?
SHARP.
it isn't that.
CHARM.
Callidemides P SHARP.
It isn't that.
CHARM.
Callinicus ?
SHARP.
No :
it isn't that.
CHARM.
Or is it Callimachus ?
SHARP.
'Tis in vain you suggest;
and, i' faith, I really don't care one fillip about it, since I recollect enough myself for my own purpose.
CHARM.
But there are many people here of the name of Lesbonicus ;
unless you tell me the name of his father, I cannot show you these persons whom you are looking for.
What is it like ?
Perhaps we can find it out by guessing.
SHARP.
It is something like this :
CharCHARM.
Chares ?
Or Charicles ?
Or is it Charmides PSHARP.
Ah!
that's he;
may the Deities confound him.
CHARM.
I have said to you once before already * * * * that it is proper for you rather to speak well of a man that is your friend, than to curse him.
SHARP.
Isn't it the fact1 that this most worthless fellow has lain perdu between my lips and my teeth ?
CHARM.
Don't you be cursing an absent friend.
SHARP.
Why, then, did this most rascally fellow hide himself away from me ?
CHARM.
if you had only called him, he would have an­ swered to his name.
But where is he himself now ?
SHARP.
Troth, I left him at Rhadama2, in the isle of Apeland.
CHARM.
* * * * * (aside).
What person is there a greater simpleton than I, who myself am making inquiries where I am ?
But it is by no means unimportant to this present purpose.
What do you say as—?
SHARP.
What now ?
CHARM.
I ask you this.
What places have you visited ?
SHARP.
Places exceedingly wonderful in astonishing ways.
CHARM.
I should like to hear about them, unless it is in­ convenient.
SHARP.
Really I quite long to tell you.
First of all we were conveyed to Pontus, to the land of Arabia3.
CHARM.
How now;
is Arabia then in Pontus ?
SHARP.
It is.
Not that Arabia where frankincense IS pro­ duced, but where the wormwood grows1, and the wild mar­ joram which the poultry love.
CHARM. (aside).
An extremely ingenious knave this.
But the greater simpleton I, to be asking of this fellow from what place I have come back, a thing which I know, and he does not know;
except that I have a mind to try how he will get out of it at last.
But what say you further ?
Whither did you go next from thence ?
SHARP.
If you give me your attention, I will tell you.
To the source of the river which arises out of the heavens, from beneath the throne of Jupiter.
CHARM.
Beneath the throne of Jupiter?
SHARP.
Yes:
I say so.
CHARM.
Out of the heavens ?
SHARP.
Aye, out of the very middle.
CHARM.
How now;
and did you ascend even to the hea­ vens ?
SHARP.
Yes:
we were carried in a little skiff2 right on, up the river, against the tide.
CHARM.
And did you see Jupiter as well ?
SHARP.
The other Gods said that he had gone to his country-house, to dole out the victuals for his slaves.
Then.
after thatCHARM.
Then after that—I don't want you to relate any­ thing more.
SHARP.
Troth, I'm silent, if it's troublesome.
CHARM.
Why, no decent persons ought to tell it, who has gone from the earth to heaven.
SHARP.
I'll leave you, as I see you wish it.
But point me out these persons whom I am looking for, and to whom I must deliver these letters.
CHARM.
What say you ?
If now perchance you were to see Charm ides himself, him, I mean, who you say gave you these letters, would you know the man ?
SHARP.
By my troth now, do you take me to be a brute beast, who really am not able to recognise the person with whom I have been spending my life ?
And would he have been such a fool as to entrust to me a thousand Philippean pieces, which gold he bade me carry to his son, and to his friend Callicles, to whom he said that he had entrusted hi3 affairs ?
Would he have entrusted them to me if he had not known me, and I him, very intimately ?
CHARM. (aside).
I really have a longing now to swindle this swindler, if I can cozen him out of these thousand Philippean pieces which he has said that I have given to him.
A person, that I know not who he is, and have never beheld him with my eyes before this day, should I be entrusting gold to him ?
A man, to whom, if his life were at stake, I would not entrust a dump of lead.
This fellow must be adroitly dealt with by me.
Hallo!
Mister Hush, I want three words with you.
SHARP.
Even three hundred, if you like.
CHARM.
Have you that gold which you received from Charmides ?
SHARP.
Yes, and Philippeans, too, counted out on the table with his own hand, a thousand pieces.
CHARM.
You received it, you mean,' from Charmides himself?
SHARP.
'Twere a wonder if I had received it of his father, or of his grandfather, who are dead.
CHARM.
Then, young man, hand me over this gold.
SHARP. (staring at him).
What gold am I to give you ?
CHARM.
That which you have owned you received from me.
SHARP.
Received from you ?
CHARM.
Tes, I say so.
SHARP.
Who are you ?
CHARM.
I am Charmides, who gave you the thousand pieces of money.
SHARP.
I' faith, you are not he;
and this day, you never shall be he, for this gold, at any rate.
Away with you, if you please, you impostor ! (Aside.)
You are trying to cheat the cheater.
CHARM.
I am Charmides.
SHARP.
I' faith, you are so to no purpose, for I carry1 no gold.
Right cleverly were you down upon me, at the very nick of time.
After I said that I was bringing the gold, that instant you became Charmides.
Before I made mention of the gold, you were not he.
It won't do.
Just, therefore, in such manner as you Char midised yourself, do you again un-Charmidise yourself.
CHARM.
Who am I, then, if in fact I am not he who I really am ?
SHARP.
What matters that to me ?
So long as you are not he whom I do not choose you to be, you may be who you like, for what I care.
Just now, you were not he who you were, now you are become he who then you were not.
CHARM.
Come, despatch, if you are going to do it.
SHARP.
What am I to do ?
CHARM.
Give me back the gold.
SHARP.
You are dreaming, old gentleman.
CHARM.
Did you own that Charmides delivered the gold to you ?
SHARP.
Yes—in writing2.
CHARM.
Are you making haste or not, you night-robber, to be off with all speed this very instant from this neighbourhood, before I order you to be soundly cudgelled on the spot ?
SHARP.
For what reason ?
CHARM.
Because I am that self-same Charmides about whom you have been thus lying, and who you said gave the letters to you.
SHARP.
How now;
prithee, are you really he ?
CHARM.
I really am he.
SHARP.
Say you so, pray ?
Are you really he himself?
CHARM.
I do say so.
SHARP.
Are you his own self ?
CHARM.
His own self, I say.
I am Charmides.
SHARP.
And are you then his own self ?
CHARM.
His own very self.
Begone hence out of my sight.
SHARP.
Since you really have made your appearance here thus late, you shall be beaten both at my own award1 and that of the new Ædiles.
CHARM.
And are you abusing me as well ?
SHARP.
Yes;
seeing that you have arrived in safety2, may the Gods confound me, if I care a straw for you, had you perished first.
I have received the money for this job ;
you, I devote to bad luck.
But who you are, or who you are not, I care not one jot.
I'll go and carry words to him who gave me the three pieces, that he may know that he has thrown them away.
I'm off.
Live with a curse, and fare you ill;
may all the Gods confound you, Charmides, for coming from abroad4.
(Exit.CHAR.
Since this fellow has gone, at last a time and opportunity seem to have arrived for speaking out with­ out restraint.
Already does this sting pierce my breast­ what business he could have before my house ?
For these letters summon apprehensions into my heart;
those thou- sand pieces, too-what purpose they were to serve.
I' faith, a bell1 is never rung for no purpose;
unless some one handles it or moves it, 'tis mute, 'tis dumb.
But who is this, that is beginning to run this way along the street ?
I should like to observe what he is about.
I'll step aside this way.
(He retires aside.)STA.S. (to himself).
Stasimus, make you haste with all speed;
away with you to your master's house, lest on a sud­ den, through your folly, fears should arise for your shoulder- blades2.
Quicken your pace, make haste;
'tis now a long while since you left the house.
If you shall be absent when inquired after by your master, take you care, please, that the smacks of the bull's-hide3 don't clatter thick upon you.
Don't you cease running.
See now, Stasimus, what a worthless fellow you are ;
and isn't it the fact that you have forgotten your ring4 at the liquor-shop5, after you have been washing your throat with warm drink ?
Turn about, and run back now, to seek it, while the thing has but just happened.
CHARMIDES (behind).
Whoever he is, his throat is his taskmaster1;
that teaches this fellow the art of running.
STAS.
What, good-for-nothing fellow, are you not ashamed of yourself?
having lost your memory after only three cups ?
And really, because you were there drinking toge­ ther with such honest fellows, who could keep their hands off2 the property of another without difficulty ;
-is it among such men that you expect you may recover your ring ?
Chiruchus was there, Cerconicus, Crimnus, Cricolabus, Col­ labus3, whipped-necks4, whipped-legs, iron-rubbers, whipped­ knaves.
By my faith, any one of these could steal the sole of his shoe from a running footman5.
CHARM. (behind).
So may the Gods love me, a finished thief.
STAS.
Why should I go seek what is gone for ever?
Unless I would bestow my pains, too, by way of addition over and above to my loss.
Why, then, don't you consider that what is gone is gone?
Tack about, then1.
Betake yourself back to your master.
CHARM. (behind).
This fellow is no runaway;
he remem­ bers his home.
STAB.
I wish that the old-fashioned ways of old-fashioned days, and the old-fashioned thriftiness, were in greater esteem here, rather than these bad ways.
CHARM. (behind).
Immortal Gods!
this man really is be­ ginning to talk of noble doings!
He longs for the old- fashioned ways;
know that he loves the old-fashioned way?, after the fashion of our forefathers.
STAS.
For, now-a-days, men's manners reckon of no value what is proper, except what is agreable.
Ambition now is sanctioned by usage, and is free from the laws.
By usage, people have the license to throw away their shields, and to run away from the enemy.
To seek honor thereby in place of disgrace is the usage.
CHARM. (behind).
A shameless usage.
STAS.
Now-a-days, 'tis the usage to neglect the brave.
CHARM. (behind).
Ac, 'tis really shocking.
STAS.
The public manners have now got the laws in their power;
to them they are more submissive than are parents to their children2.
In their misery, these laws are even hung up3 against the wall with iron nails, where it had been much more becoming for bad ways to be fixed up.
CHARM. (behind).
I'd like to go up and accost this person;
but I listen to him with much pleasure, and I'm afraid, if I address him, that he may begin to talk on some other subiect.
STAB.
And, for these ways, there is nothing rendered sacred by the law.
The laws are subservient to usage;
but these habits are hastening to sweep away both what is sacred and what is public property.
CHARM. (behind).
By my troth, 'twere right for some great calamity to befal these bad customs.
STAS.
Ought not this state of things to be publicly cen­ sured?
For this kind of men are the enemies of all per­ sons, and do an injury to the entire people.
By a non-ob­ servance of their own honour, they likewise destroy all trust even in those who merit it not;
inasmuch as people form an estimate of the disposition of these from the disposition of thosefellows.
If you lend1 a person any money, it becomes lost for any purpose as one's own.
When you ask for it back again, you may find a friend made an enemy by your kindness.
If you begin to press still further, the option of two things ensues—either you must part with that which you have en­ trusted, or else you must lose that friend.
As to how this suggests itself to me, I have by actual experience been lately put in mind of it.
CHARM. (behind).
Surely this is my servant Stasimus ?
STAS.
For as to him to whom I lent the talent, I bought myself an enemy with my talent, and sold my friend.
But I am too great a simpleton to be attending to public matters rather than (what's my immediate interest) obtain safety for my back.
I'll go home.
(Moves as if going.)CHARM.
Hallo, you!
Stop, this instant!
Harkye;
hallo, you!
STAS.
I'll not stop.
CHARM.
I want you.
STAB.
What if I myself don't want you to want me.
CHARM.
Why, Stasimus, you are behaving very rudely.
STAB.
'Twere better for you to buy some one to give your commands to.
CHARM.
I' faith, I have bought one, and paid the money, too.
But if he is not obedient to my orders, what am I to do ?
STAB.
Give him a severe punishment.
CHARM.
You give good advice;
I am resolved to do so.
STAB.
Unless, indeed, you are under obligations to him.
CHARM.
If he is a deserving person, I am under obligations to him ;
but if he is otherwise, I'll do as you advise me.
STAS.
What matters it to me whether you have good or bad slaves ?
CHARM.
Because you have a share in this matter both of the good and of the bad.
STAB.
The one share I leave to yourself;
the other share, that in the good, do you set down!
to my account.
CHARM.
If you shall prove deserving, it shall be so.
Look back at me—I am Charmides.
STAS.
Ha!
what person is it that has made mention of that most worthy man ?
CHARM.
'Tis that most worthy man himself.
STAB.
0 seas, earth, heavens, by my trust in you—do I see quite clearly with my eyes ?
Is this he, or is it not ?
'Tis he!
'Tis certainly he ;
'tis he beyond a doubt!
0 my most earnestly wished-for master, health to you!
CHARM.
Health to you, too, Stasimus!
STAB.
That you are safe and sound, I—CHARM.
(interrupting him).
I know it, and I believe you.
But wave the rest;
answer me this;
how are my children, my son and daughter, whom I left here ?
STAS.
They are alive, and well.
CHARM.
Both of them, say you ?
STAS.
Both of them.
CHARM.
The Gods willed me to be safe and preserved from dangers.
The rest that I want to know I will inquire about in-doors at my leisure.
Let us go in-doors;
follow me.
STAS.
Where are you going now ?
CHARM.
Where else but to my house ?
STAS.
Do you suppose that we are living here ?
CHARM.
Why, where else should I suppose?
STAS.
NOW— CHARM.
What about " now ?"STAS.
This house is not our own.
CHARM.
What is it I hear from you ?
STAS.
Your son has sold this house.
CHARM.
I'm ruined.
STAS.
For silver minæ;
ready money counted out.
CHARM.
How many ?
STAS.
Forty.
CHARM.
I'm undone.
Who has purchased it ?
STAS.
Callicles, to whom you entrusted your affairs;
he has removed here to live, and has turned us out of doors.
CHARM.
Where is my son now living ?
STAS.
Here, in these back buildings.
(Points to the side of the house.)CHARM.
I'm utterly undone.
STAS.
I thought that this would be distressing to you when you heard of it.
CHARM.
To my sorrow, amid extreme dangers I have been borne over vast oceans, with the peril of my life I have pre­ served myself among robbers full many in number, and I have returned safe.
Now, to my misery, I am here undone by reason of those same persons for whose sake I have been struggling at this time of life Grief is depriving me of my senses.
Support me, Stasimus.
STAS.
Do you wish me to fetch you some water ?
CHARM.
When my fortunes were in their mortal struggle, then was it befitting that water should be sprinkled1 upon them.
CALL.
What noise is this that I hear before my house ?
CHARM. 0 Callicles! 0 Callicles! 0 Callicles!
to what sort of friend have I entrusted my property ?
CALL.
To one good, and faithful, and trusty, and of strict integrity.
Health to you, and I rejoice that you have ar­ rived safe and soundl.[CHARM.
How, health to me ?
Troth, I have no patience with such health.
This I wish to know;
how have you kept your trust, who, without my knowledge, have utterly de­ stroyed my property and my children that I entrusted to you and committed to your charge when going hence abroad ?
CALL.
I don't think that it is fair, when you don't under­ stand the matter, to censure your old friend with harsh words.
For you are both mistaken and you are doing me a very great injustice.
CHARM.
Have you not bought this house which you came out of just now, and driven thence my son Lesbonicus ?
Is this so as I say, or is it not ?
Answer me.
CALL.
I myself did buy the house;
I bought it that I might keep it for you.
And without that it would have hap­ pened that your son would have sold it to another person;
and then you would have lost both it and that treasure together, which, concealed there, you had entrusted to my charge.
See, I restore it safe to you;
for you did I buy it, not for myself.
CHARM.
Prithee, what do you say ?
By my trust in Gods and men, you make me suddenly to be quite ashamed of my error in speaking unkindly to my friend in return for his services.
CALL.
HOW, then;
do you now think that I am trusty and faithful ?]
CHARM.
I do think so, if all these matters are so as you relate them.
But what means- this garb of yours ?
CALL.
I'll tell you.
I was digging up the treasure in- doors, as a marriage-portion to be given to your daughter.
But I will relate to you both this and the rest in the house.
Follow me.
CHARM.
Run with all haste to the Piræus1, and make but one run of it.
There you will at once see the ship, on board of which I was carried hither.
Bid Sagario take care that the things are brought which I enjoined him, and do you go together with them.
The duty has been already paid2 to the custom-house officer.
STAS.
I make no delay.
CHARM.
Get you gone with all speed;
and be back directly.
STAS.
I am both there and here in an instant.
CALL. (to CHARMIDES.)
Do you follow me this way in- doors.
CHARM.
I follow.
(Exeunt CALLICLES and CHARMIDES into the house.
STAS.
This man alone has remained a firm friend to my master;
nor has he allowed his mind to swerve from unshaken fidelity, although I believe that he has undergone many troubles, by reason of the property and the children of my master.
Still, this person, as I suspect, alone has main­ tained his fidelity.
(Exit.
Lys.
This individuals is the very first of all men;
ex­ celling all in pleasures and delights.
So truly do the bless­ ings which I desire befal me, that whatever I undertake is brought about, and constantly succeeds :
so does one delight succeed other delights.
Just now, Stasimus, the servant of Lesbonicus, came to me at home.
He told me that his master, Charmides, had arrived here from abroad.
Now lie must be forthwith waited upon by me, that the father may prove a more sure foundation in that matter on which I have treated with his son.
I'll go.
But this door, with its creak­ ing, inopportunely causes me delay.
(He retires to a dis­ tance.)CHARM.
There never was, nor will there be, nor yet do 1 think that there is a person upon the earth, whose fidelity and constancy towards his friend equals yours.
For without you, it would have been that he would have ousted me out of this house.
CALL.
If I have in any way acted well towards my friend, or have faithfully consulted his advantage, I seem not to be deserving of praise, but I think I am free from fault.
For a benefit which is conferred on a mart for his own, at once is lost to the giver;
what is given only as a loan, the same them is a right to ask back, whenever you please.
CHARM:
.
'Tis so as you say.
But I cannot sufficiently wonder at this, that he has betrothed his sister into a family so influential.
Lys. (behind).
Why, he is mentioning my name.
CHARM.
He has got into a most worthy family.
Lys. (behind).
Why do I hesitate to address these per­ sons ?
But still, I think, I may wait awhile ;
for something is going to be said to the purpose about this matter.
CHARM.
O— CALL.
What's the matter ?
CHARM.
I forgot just now to tell you of it in-doors.
As I was coming hither, a while ago, a certain swindling fellow met me—a very finished sharper.
He told me that he was carrying a thousand gold pieces, of my giving, to you and my son Lesbonicus;
a fellow, that I know not who he was, nor have I ever seen him anywhere before.
But why do you laugh?
CALL.
He came by my directions, as though he was one bringing the gold from you to me, to give as a portion to your daughter;
that your son, when I should give it to her from my own hands, might suppose that it had been brought from you, and that he might not anyhow be enabled to discover the fact itself-that your treasure was in my possession, and de­ mand it of mel, as having belonged to his father, by the public laws.
CHARM.
Cleverly contrived, i' troth.
CALL.
Megaronides, a common well-wisher of yours and mine, planned this.
CHARM.
Well, I applaud his device, and approve of it.
LYS. (behind).
Why, in my foolishness, while I fear to interrupt their discourse, am I standing here alone, and am not forwarding the business that I was intending to trans­ act ?
I will accost these persons.
(He advances.)CHARM.
Who is this person that is coming this way to­ wards us ?
LYS.
(going up to CHARMIDES).
Lysiteles salutes his father-in-law Charmides.
CHARM.
May the Gods grant you, Lysiteles, whatever you may desire.
CALL.
Am I not worthy of a salutation ?
LYS.
Yes;
health to you, Callicles.
It is right that I should give him the preference:
the tunic is nearer2 the skin than the cloak.
CALL.
I trust that the Gods may direct your plans aright.
CHARM.
I hear that my daughter has been betrothed to you?
LYS.
Unless you are unwilling.
CHARM.
Nay, I am not unwilling.
LYS.
Do you, then, promise your daughter for my wife ?
CHARM.
I promise a thousand gold Philippean pieces, as well, for a portion.
Lys.
I care nothing about a portion.
CHARM.
If she pleases you, the portion which she presents to you must be pleased as well.
In fine, the object which you desire you shall not have, unless you shall take that which you do not desire.
CALL. (to LTSITELES).
He asks but justice.
LYS.
He shall obtain it, you the advocate and the judge.
On these conditions, do you engage that your daughter shall be given to me as ray wife ?
CHARM.
I do promise her.
CALL.
And I promise her likewise.
Lys. 0 save you, my connexions by marriage.
(He embraces them.)CHARM.
But, in good sooth, there are some matters on account of which I still am angry with you.
LYS.
What have I done ?
CHARM.
Because you have allowed my son to become dissolute.
Lys.
Had that been done by my consent, there would have been cause for you to blame me.
But allow me to obtain of you this one thing which I entreat ?
CHARM.
What is it ?
LYS.
You shall know.
If he has done anything imprudently, that you will dismiss it all from your mind.
Why do you shake your head ?
CHARM.
My heart is tortured, and I fear—LTS.
What is it now ?
CHARM.
Because he is such as I would that he was not,-by that am I tortured.
I fear that if I refuse you what you ask of me, you may suppose that I am indifferent towards you.
I won't make difficulties, how­ ever;
I will do as you wish.
LTS.
You are a worthy man.
I am going to call him out.
(He goes to the door of the house of CHARMIDES.)CHARM.
'Tis a shocking thing if one is not allowed to punish bad deserts just as they merit.
Lys. (knocking at the door).
Open the door, open quickly, and call Lesbonicus out of doors, if he is at home.
The occasion is very sudden, therefore I wish him to come to me with all haste.
LESB.
What person has been calling me out of doors with so loud a knocking ?
LYS.
'Tis your well-wisher and friend.
LESB.
Is all quite right ?-tell me.
Lys.
All's well.
I am glad to say that your father has returned from abroad.
LESB.
Who says so ?
LYS.
I.LESB.
Have you seen him ?
Lys. Aye, and you yourself may see him too.
(He points to CHARMIDES.)LESB.
0 my father, my father, blessings on you.
CHARM.
Many blessings on you, my son.
LESB.
If, father, any trouble1— CHARM.
Have no fear, nothing has happened.
My affairs prosperously managed, I have returned safe.
If you are only wishful to be steady, that daughter of Callicles has been promised you.
LESB.
I will marry both her, father, and any one else besides that you shall bid me.
CHARM.
Although I have been angry with you, one misery2, in fact, is more than enough for one man.
CALL.
Nay, rather, 'twere too little for him;
for if he.
were to marry a hundred wives for his sins, it were too little.
LESB.
But henceforth, in future, I will be steady.
CHARM.
So you say;
if you will only do it.
LESB.
Is there any reason why I should not bring my wife home to-morrow ?
CHARM.
'Tis very good.
And you, Lysiteles, be ready to be married the day after to-morrow.
Give your applause3.

Scene—Ephesus:
a Street before the houses of PERIPLEOC MENUS and POLINICES, which adjoin cach other.
E 2LEUSICLES, a young Athenian, is in love with Philocomasium, a Courtesan of Athens, who returns his affection.
Being sent on public business to Naupactus, a certain Captain of Ephesus, Pyrgopolinices by name, comes to Athens, and in­ sinuates himself into the good graces of her mother, in older that he may get Philocomasium into his power.
Having deceived the mother, he places the daughter on board ship and carries her off to Ephesus.
On this, Palæstrio, a faithful servant of Pleusicles, hastens to embark for Naupactus, with the view of telling his master what has happened.
The ship being taken by pirates, he is made captive, and by chance is presented as a gift to Pyrgopolinices.
He re­ cognises the mistress of Pleusicles in the Captain's house;
but he carefully conceals from the Captain who he himself is.
He then privately writes to Pleusicles, requesting him to come to Ephesus.
On arriving, Pleusicles is hospitably entertained by Periplecomenus, a friend of his father, an old gentle­ man who lives next door to the Captain.
As Philocomasium has a private room of her own in the Captain's house, a hole is made through the partition wall, and by this contrivance she meets Pleusicles in the house of his enter­ tainer, who gives his sanction to the plan.
At this juncture, the play begins.
A servant of the Captain, named Sceledrus, has been appointed to be the keeper of Philocomasium.
Pursuing a monkey along the roof of the house, he looks down the skylight of the house next door, and there sees Pleusicles and Philocomasium conversing and toying with each other.
When this has been discovered to be the case, a plan is arranged, by which Sceledrus shall not only not divulge to the Captain what he has seen, but shall even be made to believe that he has not actually seen it himself.
Palæstrio, therefore, persuades him that the twin-sister of Philoco­ masium has arrived at Ephesus, and with her lover is staying at their neigh­ bour's house.
To forward their designs, Palæstrio then invents another plan.
He persuades the Captain to believe that the wife of his neighbour, Peripleco­ menus, is in love with him.
Through his agency, a Courtesan, named Acrote­ leutium, pretends that she is the wife so desperately in love with the Captain.
He believes this story, and, that he may the more conveniently receive her in his house, by the advice of Palæstrio, he sends Philocomasium away, and gives her into the charge of Pleusicles, who is disguised in the dress of a master of a ship.
They go to the harbour and set sail, accompanied by Palæstrio, whem the Captain has given to Philocomasium at her request.
The Captain, then, at the invitation of the maid of Acroteleutium, goes to the house next door, to visit her mistress.
On this, Periplecomenus, with his servants, sallies forth upon him, and, having first threatened to cut him in pieces, and then having beaten and stripped him, they let him go, after they have exacted from him a confession that he has been rightly served, and a promise that he will molest no one in re­ turn for the treatment he has received.
[Supposed to have been written by Priscian, the Grammarian.]
A Captain carries off to Ephesus a Courtesan (Meretricem) from Athens.
While his servant is intending to tell this (Id) to his master, her lover, who is an Am­ bassador (Legato) abroad, he himself is captured at sea, and (Et) is given as a present to the same Captain.
The servant sends for his (Suum) master from Athens, and cleverly makes a hole in the party wall, common to the two (Ge­ minis) houses, that it may be possible (Liceret) for the two lovers secretly to meet.
Wandering about (Oberrans), her keeper sees them from the tiles, but he is played a trick (Ridiculis) upon, as though it were another person.
Palæstrio, too, as well (Item) persuades the Captain to have his mistress dis­ missed (Omissam), since the wife of the old man (Senis), his neighbour, wishes to marry him.
He begs that she will go away of her own accord (Ultro), and gives her many things.
He, himself, caught in the house of the old man (Senis), receives punishment as an adulterer.
PYRG.
Take ye care that the lustre of my shield is more bright than the rays of the sun are wont to be at the time when the sky is clear;
that when occasion comes, the battle being joined, 'mid the fierce ranks right opposite it may dazzle the eyesight of the enemy.
But, I wish to console this sabre of mine, that it may not lament nor be downcast in spirits, because I have thus long been wearing it keeping holiday, which so longs right dreadfully to make havoc of the enemy.
But where is Artotrogus ?
ARTO.
Here he is;
he stands close by the hero, valiant and successful, and of princely form.
Mars could not dare to style himself a warrior so great, nor compare his prowess with yours.
PYRG.
Him you mean whom I spared on the Gorgonido­ nian1 plains, where Bumbomachides Clytomestoridysarchides, the grandson of Neptune, was the chief commander ?
ARTO.
I remember him;
him, I suppose, you mean with the golden armour, whose legions you puffed away with your breath just as the wind blows away leaves or the reed-thatched roof.
PYRG.
That, on my troth, was really nothing at all.
ARTO.
Faith, that really was nothing at all in compari­ son with other things I could mention—(aside) which you never did.
If any person ever beheld a more perjured fellow than this, or one more full of vain boasting, faith let him have me for himself, I'll resign myself for his slave;
if 'tis not the fact that:
!
my one mess of olive pottage3 is eaten up by me right ravenously.
PYRG.
Where are you ?
ARTO.
Lo! here am I.
I' troth in.
what a fashion it was you broke the fore-legl of even an elephant, in India, with your fist.
PYRG.
How (-the fore-leg ?
ARTO.
I meant to say this -the thigh.
PYRG.
I struck the blow without an effort.
ARTO.
Troth, if, indeed, you had put forth your strength, your arm would have passed right through the hide, the entrails, and the frontispiece of the elephant.
PYRG.
I don't care for these things just now.
ARTO.
I' faith, 'tis really not worth the while for you to tell me of it, who know right well your prowls, (Aside) 'Tis my appetite creates2 all these plagues.
I must hear him right out with my ears, that my teeth mayn't have time3 to grow, and whatever lie he shall tell, to it I must agree.
PYRG.
What was it I was saying ?
ARTO.
0, I know what you were going to say just now.
I' faith 'twas bravely done ;
I remember its being done.
PYRG.
What was that ?
ARTO.
Whatever it was you were going to say.
PYRG.
Have you got your tablets4 ?
ARTO.
Are you in­ tending to enlist5 ?
I have them, and a pen as well.
PYRG.
How cleverly you do suit your mind to my own mind.
ARTO.
'Tis fit that I should know your inclinations stu­ diously, so that whatever you wish should first occur1 to me.
PYRG.
What do you remember ?
ARTO.
I do remember this.
In Cilicia there were a hundred and fifty men, a hundred in Cryphiolathronia2, thirty at Sardis, sixty men of Macedon, whom you slaughtered altogether in one day.
PYRG.
What is the sum total of those men ?
ARTO.
Seven thousand.
PYRa.
It must be as much :
you keep the reckoning well.
ARTO.
Yet I have none of them written down;
still, so I re­ member it was.
Prim.
By my troth, you have a right good memory.
ARTO. (aside).
'Tis the flesh-pots3 give it a fillip.
PYRG.
So long as you shall do such as you have done hitherto, you shall always have something to eat:
I will always make you a partaker at my table.
ARTO.
Besides, in Cappadocia, you would have killed five hundred men altogether at one blow, had not your sabre been blunt.
PYRG.
I let them live, because I was quite sick of fighting.
ARTO.
Why should I tell you what all mortals know, that you, Pyrgopolinices, live alone upon the earth, with valour, beauty, and achievements most unsurpassed ?
All the women are in love with you, and that not without reason, since you are so handsome.
Witness those girls that pulled me by my mantle yesterday.
PYRG.
What was it they said to you ?
ARTO.
They questioned me about you. " Is Achilles here ?" says one to me.
"No," says I, "his brother is."
Then says the other to me:
" By my troth, but he is a handsome and a noble man.
See how his long hair becomes him.
Certainly the women are lucky who share his favours."PYRG.
And pray, did they really say so ?
AUTO.
They both entreated me to bring you past to-day by way of a sight1 to them.
PYRG.
'Tis really a very great plague to be too handsome a man.
ARTO.
They are quite a nuisance to me ;
they are praying, entreating, beseeching me, to let them see you;
bidding me be fetched to them;
so that I can't give my attention to your business.
PYRG.
It seems that it is time for us to go to the Forum, that I may count out their pay to those soldiers whom I have enlisted of late.
For King Seleucus2 entreated me with most earnest suit that I would raise and enlist recruits for him.
To that business have I resolved to devote my attention this day.
ARTO.
Come, let's be going then.
PYRa.
Guards, follow me.
(Exeunt.
PAL.
To tell the subject of this our play, I have all willingness, if you will but have the kindness to listen to it.
But he who does not.
wish to listen, let him arise and go out, that there may be room where he may sit who does wish to listen.
Now I will disclose to you both the subject and the name of the play which we are just now about to act, and for the sake of which you are now seated in this mirthful placed " Alazon" is the name2, in Greek, of this Comedy;
the same we call in Latin, " the Braggart" (Gloriosus).
This city is Ephesus;
then, the Captain, my master, who has gone oft hence to the Forum, a bragging, impudent, stinking fellow, brimful of lying and lasciviousness, says that all the women are following him of their own accord.
Wherever he goes, he is the laughing-stock of all;
and so, the Courtesans here-since they make wry mouths at him, you may see the greater part of them with lips all awry.
I wish you now to know this, how I came to be his slave, from him to whom I was servant before;
for 'tis not long that I have been in slavery to him.
Give your attention, for now I will begin the argument.
A very worthy young man at Athens was my master.
He was in love with a Courtesan, brought up at Athens, in Attica, and she on the other hand loved him ;
such affection is most worthy to be cherished.
In the public service, he was sent to Kaupactus3 as Ambassador on behalf of that mighty republic.
In the mean time, by chance, this Captain came to Athens.
He introduced himself to this lady of my master, began to cajole her mother with presents of wine, trinkets, and costly treats;
and so the Captain made himself on intimate terms with the procuress.
As soon as ever an opportunity was presented for this Captain, he tricked this procuress, the mother of the damsel, whom my master loved.
For, unknown to her mother, he put the daughter on board ship, and carried this woman, against her will, hither' to Ephesus.
Soon as I knew that the lady of my master was carried off from Athens, as quickly as ever I was able, I procured for myself a ship:
I embarked, that I might carry tidings of this matter to my master at Naupactum.
When we had got out to sea, some pirates, as they had hoped to do, took that ship on board of which I was ;
thus I was undone before I reached my master, for whom I had commenced to proceed on my voyage.
He that took me, gave me as a pre- sent to this same Captain.
After he had taken me home to his own house, I saw there that favorite of my master who lived at Athens.
When, on the other hand, she perceived me, she gave me a sign with her eyes not to address her by name.
Afterwards, when there was an opportunity, the damsel com­ plained to me of her hard fate.
She said that she wished to escape to Athens from this house, that she was attached to him, that master of mine who lived at Athens, and that she had never hated any one more thoroughly than this same Captain.
As I discovered the feelings of the damsel, I took tablets, sealed them in private, and gave them to a certain merchant to carry to him (my master, I mean, who was at Athens, and who had so loved her), in order that he might come hither.
He did not slight the message, for he both is come, and is lodging here next door, with his host, a friend of his father's, a nice old man.
He, too, gives every assistance to his guest in his amour, and encourages and seconds us with his help and his advice.
Therefore, here (pointing to the CAPTAIN'S house), in-doors, I have found a grand contrivance, by which to cause these lovers, each, to meet the other.
For one room, which the Captain gave to his mistress for no one but herself to set foot in, in that same room I have dug a hole through the party- wall, in order that there may secretly be an ingress for the damsel from the one house to the other.
And this I have done with the knowledge of the old gentleman;
'twas he that gave the advice.
But my fellow-servant, whom the Captain has given as a keeper to his mistress, is a person of no great worth.
By clever contrivances and ingenious devices, we will throw dust1 in his eyes, and we will make him so as not to see what he really does see.
And that you may not hereafter make mistakes, this damsel to-day, in this house and in that, will perform in turn a double part, and will be the same, but will pretend to be another, person.
Thus will the keeper of the damsel be gulled.
But there is a noise2 at the door here of the old gentleman, our neighbour.
'Tis himself coming out;
'tis he, the nice old man that I was speaking of.
(He retires to a distance)PERIP.
(speaking to his servants within).
Faith, if you don't in future smash his ankle-bones for any stranger that you see on my tiles, I will cut you so with lashes as to make thongs of your sides.
My neighbours, i' faith, are over­ lookers of what is going on in my own house;
so often are they peeping down through the skylight1.
And now, there­ fore, I give you all notice, whatever person of this Captain's household you shall see upon our tiles, except Palæstrio only, push him headlong here into the street.
Suppose he says that he is following some hen, or pigeon, or monkey;
woe be to you, if you don't badly maul the fellow even to death.
And so, that they may commit no infringement against the laws of dice2, do you take good care that they keep holiday at home with­ out any ankle-bones at all.
PAL. (aside).
Something amiss,—what, I know not, has been done him by our family so far as I can hear, inasmuch as the old man has ordered the ankles of my fellow-servants to be broken.
But he has excepted me;
nothing care I what he does to the rest of them.
I'll accost the old man.
(Advances.)PERIP.
The person that is coming this way, is he coming towards me ?
He comes as if he was coming to me.
PAL.
How do you do, Periplecomenus?
PERIP.
There are not many men, if I were to wish, whom x would rather now see and meet with than yourself.
PAL.
What’s the matter?
What disturbance have you with our family?
PERIP.
We are done for.
PAL.
What's the matter?
PEEIP.
The thing's discovered.
PAL.
What thing's dis­ covered ?
PERIP.
Some one just now of your household was looking in from the tiles through our skylight at Philocomasium and my guest as they were toying together.
PAL.
What person saw it ?
PERIP.
Your fellow-servant.
PAL.
Which person was it?
PERIP.
I don't know;
he took himself off so suddenly-in an instant.
PAL.
I suspect I'm ruined.
PERIP.
When he went away, I cried:
"Hallo!
you sir!" said I, "what are you doing upon the tiles ?"
As he went away he replied to me in these terms, that he was following a stray'd monkey.
PAL.
Woe to wretched me that I must be ruined for a worth­ less beast.
But is Philocomasium there with you even still ?
PERIP.
When I came out, she was there.
PAL.
If she is, then bid her return to our house as soon as ever she can, that the servants may see that she is at home;
unless, indeed, she wishes that we, who are slaves, her fellow- slaves1, should all be given up together to tortures by the cross on account of her courting.
PERIP.
I bade her do so;
unless you would aught else.
PAL.
I would.
Tell her this:
that, by my troth, she must not hesitate at all to bring in play her skill and cleverness.
PERIP.
In what way ?
PAL.
That by her words she may persuade him who saw her here at your house, that he did not see her.
Should he accuse her, on the other hand let her convince him with her oath.
Even though she were seen a hundred times over, still let her deny it.
(Aside.)
For, if she is at all inclined to ill, a woman never goes begging1 to the gardener for material, she has a garden at home and a stock of her own for all mischievous contrivances;
at home she has impudence 2, a lying tongue, perfidiousness, malice, and boldness, self-conceit, assurance, and deceitfulness,-at home she has wiles,-at home captivating contrivances,­ stratagems at home.
PEBIP.
I'll tell her this, if she shall be in-doors here (point­ ing to his house).
But what is it, Palæstrio, that you are considering with yourself in your mind?
PAL.
Be silent a moment, while I am calling a council in my mind, and while I am considering what I am to do, what plan I must contrive, on the other hand, as a match for my crafty fellow-servant, who has seen her billing here in your house;
so that what was seen may not have been seen.
PERIP.
Do contrive one;
in the meantime, I'll retire hence to a distance from you, to this spot.
(He retires to a distance.)
Look at him, please (to the AUDIENCE), revolving his cares with brow severe, how he stands.
He strikes his breast withhis fingers;
I fancy he's about to call his heart outside.
See, he shifts his posture;
again he places his left hand upon his left thigh.
His right hand is reckoning down his plans upon his fingers;
in despair he strikes his thigh.
His right hand is moving rapidly1;
with difficulty does it suggest what he is to do.
He snaps his fingers now;
he's striving hard;
full oft he changes his position.
But see how he shakes his head;
it pleases him not what he has hit upon.
Whatever it is, nothing crude will he bring forth, something well-digested will he pro­ duce.
But see, he is building;
he has placed his hand as a pillar2 beneath his chin.
Have done with it!
in truth, this mode of building pleases me not;
for I have heard say that the head of a foreign Poets is wont to be supported thus, over whom two guards are ever at all hours keeping watch.
Bravo!
how becomingly he stands,—i’ faith, how like a very slavey and how faithful to his part.
Never, this day, will he rest, before he has completed that which he is in search of.
He has it, I suspect.
Come-to the business you're about:
keep wide awake, think not of sleep;
unless, indeed, you wish to be keeping your watch here all checquered o'er with stripes.
'Tis I, that am talking to you;
schemer, don't you know that I am speaking to you?
Palæstrio!
awake, I say;
arouse yourself, I say;
'tis daylight now, I say.
PAL.
I hear you.
PERIP.
Don't you see that the enemy is upon you, and that siege is being laid to your back ?
Take counsel, then ;
obtain aid and assistance in this matter;
the hastily, not the leisurely, is befitting here.
Get the start of them in some way, and in some direction this moment lead around your troops.
Close round the enemy in siege;
pre­ pare the convoy for our side.
Cut off the enemy's provision, secure yourself a passage, by which supplies and provision may be enabled in safety to reach yourself and your forces.
Look to this business;
the emergency is sudden.
Invent- contrive-this instant give us some clever plan;
so that that which has been seen here within, may not have been seen;
that which has been done, may not have been done.
There, my man, you undertake a great enterprise;
lofty the defences which you erect.
If you yourself alone but say you under­ take this, I have a certainty that we are able to rout our foes.
PAL.
I do say so, and I do undertake it.
PERIP.
And I do pronounce that yon shall obtain that which you desire.
PAL.
May Jupiter kindly bless you then !
PERIP.
But, friend, do you impart to me the plan which you have devised.
PAL.
Be silent, then, while I am inducting you in the direction of my devices;
that you may know as well as my own self my plans.
PERIP.
The same you shall receive safe from the same spot where you have deposited them.
PAL.
My master is surrounded with the hide of an elephant, not his own, and has no more wisdom than a stone.
PERIP.
I myself know the same thing.
PAL.
Now, thus I would begin upon my plan;
this con­ trivance I shall act upon.
I shall say that her other own twin-sister has come here from Athens, with a certain per­ son, her lover, to Philocomasium, as like to her as milk is to milk.
I shall say that they are lodged and entertained here in your house.
PERIP.
Bravo !
bravo !
cleverly thought of.
I approve of your device.
PAL.
SO that, if my fellow-servant should accuse her be­ fore the Captain, and say that he has seen her here at your house, toying with another man, I shall assert, on the other hand, that my fellow-servant has seen the other one, the sister, at your house, fondling and toying with her own lover.
PERIP.
Aye, most excellent.
I'll say the same, if the Captain shall inquire of me.
PAL.
But do you say that they are extremely alike;
and this must be imparted in time to Philocomasium, in order that she may know;
that she mayn't be tripping if the Captain should question her.
PERIP.
A very clever contrivance.
But if the Captain should wish to see them both in company together, what shall we do then ?
PAL.
That's easy enough.
Three hundred excuses may be picked up—she is not at home;
she has gone out walk­ ing;
she is asleep;
she is dressing;
she is bathing;
she is at breakfastl;
she is taking dessert-;
she is engaged;
she is enjoying her rest3;
in fact, site can't come.
There are as many of these put-offs as you like, if I can only persuade him at the very outset to believe that to.
be true which shall be contrived.
PERIP.
I like what you say.
PAL.
Go in-doors then;
and if the damsel's there, bid her return home directly, and instruct and tutor her thoroughly in this plan, that she may under­ stand our scheme, as we have begun it, about the twin-sister.
PERIP.
I'll have her right cleverly tutor'd for you.
Is there anything else ?
PAL.
Only, be off in-doors.
PERIP.
I'm off.
EXit.PAL.
And I'll go home, too;
and I'll conceal the fact that I am giving her my aid in seeking out the man, which fellow-servant of mine it was, that to-day was following the monkey.
For it cannot be but in his conversation he must have made some one of the household acquainted about the lady of his master, how that he himself has seen her next door here toying with some stranger spark.
I know the habit myself;
" I can't hold my tongue on that which I know alone."
If I find out the person who saw it, I'll plant against him all my manteletsl and covered works.
The material is prepared;
'tis a sure matter that I must take this person by force, and by thus besieging him.
If so I don't find the man, just like a'hound I'll go smelling about, even until I shall have traced out the fox by his track.
But our door makes a noise :
I'll lower my voice;
for here is the keeper of Philocomasium, my fellow-servant, coming out of doors.
(Stands aside)SCEL.
Unless, in fact, I have been walking this day in my sleep upon the tiles, i' faith, I know for sure that I have seen here, at our neighbour's next door, Philocoma­ sium, the lady of my master, on the high road2 to mischief to herself.
PAL. (aside).
'Twas he that saw her billing, so far as I have heard him say.
SCEL.
Who's that?
PAL.
Your fellow-servant.
How are you, Sceledrus ?
SCEL.
I am glad that I have met you, Palæstrio.
PAL.
What now ?
Or what's the matter ?
Let me know.
SCEL.
I'm afraid.
PAL.
What are you afraid of ?
SCEL.
By my troth, lest, this day, as many domestics at­ there are of us here, we shall jump into a most woful punish­ ment by way of torture.
PAL.
Jump you alone, please;
for I don't at all like this jumping in1 and jumping out.
SCEL.
Perhaps you don't know what new mischance has happened at home ?
PAL.
What mischance is this ?
SCEL.
A disgraceful one.
PAL.
Do you then keep it to yourself alone:
don't tell it me ;
I don't want to know it.
SCEL.
But I won't let you not know it.
To-day I was fol­ lowing our monkey upon the tiles, next door there.
(-Points to the house.)PAL.
By my troth, Sceledrus, a worthless fellow, you were following a worthless beast.
SCEL.
The Gods confound you!
PAL.
That befits your­ self, since you began the conversation.
SCEL.
By chance, as it happened, I looked down there through the skylight, into the next house;
and there I saw Philocomasium toying with some strange young man, I know not whom.
PAL.
What scandalous thing is this I hear of you, Sce­ ledrus ?
SCEL.
I' faith, I did see her, beyond a doubt.
PAL.
What, yourself?
SCEL.
Tes, I myself, with these eyes of mine.
PAL.
Get away, it isn't likely what you say, nor did you see her.
SCEL.
Do I, then, appear to you as if I were purblind ?
PAL.
'Twere better for.
you to ask the doctor about that.
But, indeed, if the Gods only love you, don't you rashly father this2 idle story.
Now are you breeding thence a fatal dilemma for your legs and head;
for, in two ways, the cause is contrived for you to be ruined, unless you put a check upon your foolish chattering.
SCEL.
But how, two ways?
PAL.
I'll tell you.
First then, if you falsely accuse Philocomasium, by that you are undone;
in the next place, if it is true, having been ap­ pointed her keeper, there you are undone.
SCEL.
What may happen to me, I know not;
I know for certain that I did see this.
PAL.
Do you persist in it, unfortunate wretch ?
SCEL.
What would you have me say to you, but that I did see her ?
Moreover, she is in there, next door, at this very moment.
PAL.
What!
Isn't she at home ?
SCEL.
Go and see.
Go in-doors yourself;
for I don't ask now for any confidence to be put in me.
PAL.
I'm determined to do so.
SCEL.
I'll wait here for you.
(PALÆSTRIO goes into the CAPTAIN'S house.)SCEL.
In this direction will I be on the watch for her, how soon the heifer may betake herself from the pasture this way towards her stall.
What now shall I do ?
The Captain gave me to her as her keeper.
Now, if I make a discovery, I'm undone;
if I am silent, still I am undone, if this should be discovered.
What is there more abandoned or more daring than a woman ?
While I was upon the tiles, this woman betook herself out of doors from her dwelling.
By my troth, 'twas a brazen act she did.
If, now, the Captain were to know of this, i' faith, I believe he would pull down the whole entire house next door, and me he would send to the gibbet1.
Whatever comes of it, i' faith, I'll hold my tongue rather than come to a bad end.
I cannot keep effectual guard on a woman that puts herself up for sale.
PAL.
Sceledrus, Sceledrus, what one man is there on earth more impudent than yourself?
Who more Chan your­ self has been born with the Deities hostile and enraged ?
SCEL.
What's the matter?
PAL.
Do you want those eyes of yours gouged out, with which you see what never existed ?
SCEL.
How, what never existed ?
PAL.
I would not buy your life at the price of a rotten nut.
SCEL.
Why, what's the matter?
PAL.
What’s the mat­ ter, do you ask ?
SCEL.
And why shouldn't I ask ?
PAL.
Why don't you beg for that tongue of yours to be cut out, that prates so at random ?
SCEL.
Why should I beg for that ?
PAL.
Why, Philocomasium is there at home, she whom you were saying that you had seen next door kissing and toying with another man.
SCEL.
'Tis a wonder that you are in the habit of feeding on darnel1, with wheat at so low a price.
PAL.
Why so ?
SCEL.
Because you are so dim of sight.
PAL.
You gallows-bird, 'tis you, indeed, that are blind, with a vengeance, and not dim of sight;
for, sure enough, there she is at home.
SCEL.
How ?
At home ?
PAL.
At home, i' faith, un­ doubtedly.
SCEL.
Be off with you;
you are playing with me, PalæstrioPAL.
My hands are dirty, then.
SCEL.
How so ?
PAL.
Because I am playing with dirt.
SCEL.
A mischief on your head.
PAL.
Nay rather, Sce­ ledrus, it shall be on yours, I promise you, unless you change for fresh your eyes and your talk.
But our door made a noise.
SCEL.
Well, I shall watch here out of doors;
for there is no way by which she can pass hence in-doors, except through the front door.
PAL.
But there she is, at home.
I don't know, Sceledrus, what mischief is possessing you ?
SCEL.
I see for my own self, I judge for my own self, I have especial faith in my own self:
no man shall frighten me out of it, but that she is in that house.
(Points to the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)
Here I'll take my stand, that she may not steal out home without my knowledge.
PAL. (aside).
This fellow is in my hands ;
now will I drive him from his strong hold.
(To SCELEDRUS.)
Do you wish me now to make you own that you don't see correctly ?
SCEL.
Come, do it then.
PAL.
And that you neither think aright in your mind, nor yet make use of your eyes ?
SCEL.
I'd have you do it.
PAL.
Do you say, then, that the lady of your master is there in that house ?
SCEL.
I assert, as well, that I saw her here in this house (points to the house of PERIPLECOMENUS), toying with a strange man.
PAL.
Don't you know that there is no communication between our house here and that one ?
SCEL.
I know it.
PAL.
Neither by the terracel, nor by the garden, only through the skylight ?
SCEL.
I know it.
PAL.
What then, if she is now at home ?
If I shall make her, so as you may see her, come out hence from our house, are you not deserving of many a lashing ?
SCEL.
I am so deserving.
PAL.
Watch that door, then, that she may not privily betake herself out thence without your knowledge and pass here into our house.
SCEL.
'Tis my intention to do so.
PAL.
Upon her feet2 will I place her this moment here before you in the street.
SCEL.
Come, then, and do so.
(PALÆSTRIO goes into the CAPTAIN'S house.)SCEL.
I wish to know, whether I did see that which I did see, or whether he can do that which he says he can do— make her to be at home.
For, really, I have eyes of my own, and I don't ask to borrow them out of doors.
But this fellow is for ever fawning about her;
he is always near her;
he is called first to meat, his mess is given1 to him first.
For this fellow has been, perhaps, about three years with us;
nor fares it better with any other servant in our family than with him.
But it is necessary for me to mind what I am about;
to keep my eye upon this door.
If I take my station here, this way, i' faith, I warrant they will never impose on me.
PAL. (.speaking to her in a low voice as he enters).
Be sure to remember my instructions.
PHIL. (aside).
It's strange you should so often remind me.
PAL. (aside).
But I fear you may not prove cunning enough.
PHIL. (aside).
Give me even ten scholars, though far from artful, I could instruct them so as to prove artful;
in me alone is there a superabundance of artfulness:
come, then, now put your plans in force;
I'll step aside here.
(Steps aside.)PAL.
What have you to say, Sceledrus ?SCEL.
(not lifting up his eyes).
I'm about this business of mine :
I have got ears, say what you please.
PAL.
I think that in that self-same position1 you will have to die outside the gates, when, with hands outstretched, you will be carrying your cross.
SCEL.
For what reason so ?
PAL.
Just look on your left hand;
who is that lady ?SCEL. (looking).
O ye immortal Gods, it really is the lady of my master!
PAL.
I' faith, so she seems to me as well.
Do then, now, since so you would have itSCEL.
Do what ?
PAL.
Die this very instant.
PHIL. (advancing).
Where is this faithful servant, who has falsely accused me in my innocence of this most heinous crime ?
PAL.
See, here he is;
'tis he that told it me,-assuredly 'twas he.
PHIL.
Villain, did you say that you had seen me next door here kissing ?
PAL.
Besides, he said it was with some strange young man.
SCEL.
I' faith, I did say so, undoubtedly.
PHIL.
You, saw me ?
SCEL.
Yes, with these self-same eyes.
PHIL.
I fancy you will lose those eyes, which see more than what they really do see.
SCEL.
By my faith, I shall never be intimidated from having seen what I really did see.
PHIL.
In my foolishness I am delaying too long in parley­ ing with this madman, whom, by the powers, I'll punish with death.
SCEL.
Forbear to threaten me:
I know that the cross will prove my tomb;
there are laid my forefathers, my father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather.
'Tis not in possibility, however, for these eyes of mine to be dug out2 by your threats.
But I want a few words with you;
prithee, Palsestrio, whence came she hither ?
PAL.
Whence but from our house ?
SCEL.
From our house ?
PAL.
Do you credit mel ?
SCEL.
I do credit you:
but 'tis a thing to be wondered at, how she has been able to re­ turn from that house to ours.
For, beyond a doubt, we have neither a terrace to our house, nor any garden, nor any window but what is latticed2.
(To PHILOCOMASIUM.)
But, undoubtedly, I did see you in the house next door.
PAL.
Do you persist, you rascal, in pretending to accuse her?
PHIL.
In good sooth, then, the dream has not turned out untrue, that I dreamed last night.
PAL.
What did you dream ?
PHIL.
I'll tell you;
but, I pray you, give attention.
Last night, in my sleep, my twin- sister seemed to have come from Athens to Ephesus with a certain person, her lover.
Both of them seemed to me to be having their lodgings here next door.
PAL. (to the AUDIENCE).
The dream that's being related is Palæstrio's-pray, go on.
PHIL.
I seemed to be delighted because my sister had come, and on her account I seemed to be incurring a most grievous suspicion.
For, in my sleep, my own servant seemed to accuse me, as you are now doing, of being caressed by a strange young man, whereas it was that own twin-sister of mine, who had been toying with her own friend.
Thus did I dream that I was wrongfully accused of a crime.
PAL.
And isn't just the same thing befalling you when awake, that you speak of as seen in your sleep?
Capital;
i' faith, the dream is verified:
go in-doors, and pray3.
I should recommend that this be told to the Captain.
PHIL.
I am resolved to do so;
nor, in fact, will I allow myself, with impunity, to be accused of disgraceful conduct, (Goes into the CAPTAIN'S house.)SCEL.
I fear for the thing I have done;
my back does so tingle all over.
PAL.
Are you not aware that you are done for PSCEL.
Now, indeed, I'm sure she is at home;
I am now resolved to watch our door, wheresoever she may be.
(Places himself at the door.)PAL.
But, prithee, Sceledrus, how very like the dream she dreamt to what has happened;
and how you really did believe that you had seen her kissing.
SCEL.
And do you suppose that I didn't see her ?
PAL.
I' faith, I verily believe you'll come to your senses when 'tis too late.
If this matter should only reach our master, you certainly are undone.
SCEL.
Now, at length, I find out that there was a mist placed before my eyes.
PAL.
I' faith, that really has been plain for some time now;
as she was here in-doors all the while.
SCEL.
Not a word of certainty have I to utter;
I did not see her, although I did see her.
PAL.
By my troth, through this folly of yours you certainly have nearly ruined us ;
while you have wished to prove yourself faithful to your master, you have been almost undone.
But the door of our next neighbour makes a noise;
I'll be silent.
PHIL. (to a servant SERVANT).
Put fire on the altar, that in my joy I may return praises and thanks to Diana at Ephesus, and that I may send up for her a grateful smoke with odours of Arabia:
she who has preserved me in the realms of Neptune and amid the boisterous temples1, where with raging billows I have been so recently dismayed.
PAL.
Sceledrus!
0 Sceledrus!
What is it you want ?
SCEL.
This lady that has come out of that house just now -is she Philocomasium, our master's lady, or is she not ?
PAL.
I' faith, I think, it seems to be she.
But 'tis a wondrous thing how she could pass from our house to next door;
if, indeed, it is she.
SCEL.
And have you any doubt that this is she ?
PAL.
It seems to be she.
SCEL.
Let us approach her, and accost her.
Hallo!
how's this, Philocomasium ?
What is there owing to you in that house ?
What is your business there ?
Why are yo.u silent now ?
I am speaking to you.
PAL.
No, faith, you are talking to yourself;
for nothing at all does she answer.
SCEL.
I am addressing you, woman, brimful of viciousness and disgrace, who are roaming about among your neighbours.
PHIL.
To whom are you talking ?
SCEL.
To whom but to yourself?
PUlL.
What person are you ?
Or what business have you with me ?
SCEL.
0, you ask me who I am, do you ?
PHIL.
Why shouldn't I ask that which I don't know ?
PAL.
Who am I, then, if you don't know him ?
PHIL.
You are an annoyance to me, whoever you are, both you and he.
SCEL.
What?
don't you know us ?
PHIL.
No, neither of you.
SCEL.
I very much fearPAL.
What do you fear ?
SCEL.
Why, that we have lost ourselves somewhere or other;
for she says that she knows neither you nor me.
PAL.
I wish, Sceledrus, to examine into this, whether we are ourselves, or else some other persons;
lest secretly some­ how some one of our neighbours may have transformed us without our knowing it.
SCEL.
For my part, beyond a doubt, I am my own self.
PAL.
I' faith, and so am I.
SCEL.
My lady, you are seeking your destruction.
To you I am speaking;
hark you, Philocomasium!
PHIL.
What craziness possesses you, to be calling me wrongly by a crackjaw name1 ?
SCEL.
How now!
What are you called, then ?
PHIL.
My name is Glycera.
SCEL.
For a bad purpose, Philocomasium, you wish to have a wrong name.
Away with you, shocking woman;
for most notably are you doing a wrong to my master.
PHIL.
I ?
SCEL.
Yes, you.
PHIL.
I, who arrived from Athens yesterday evening at Ephesus, with my lover, a young man of Athens PSCEL.
Tell me, what business have you here in Ephesus ?
PHIL.
I had heard that my own twin-sister is here in Ephesus ;
I came here to look for her.
SCEL.
You're a good-for-nothing woman.
PHIL.
Yes, i' faith, I am a very foolish one to be parleying with you fellows.
I am going.
SCEL.
I won't let you go.
(Catches hold of her.)PHIL.
Let me go.
SCEL, You are discovered in the fact.
I won't let you go.
PHIL.
But my hands shall just now sound again against your cheek, if you don't let me go.
SCEL. (to PALÆSTRIO ).
Why the plague are you standing idle ?
Why don't you hold her on the other side ?
PAL.
I don't choose to bring the business down upon my back.
How do I know but that this is not Philocomasium, but is some other female that resembles her ?
PHIL.
Will you let me go, or will you not let me go ?
SCEL.
No ;
by force and against your will, in spite of you, I'll drag you home, unless you'll go of your own accord.
PHIL. (pointing to the house Of PERIPLECOMENUS).
This is my lodging here abroad2, at Athens is my home.
SCEL.
But your master lives here (pointing to the CAP­ TAIN'S house).
PHIL.
I have nothing to do with that house, nor do I know or understand yourselves what persons you are.
SCEL.
Proceed against me1 at law.
I'll never let you go, until you give me your solemn word that you will go in- doors here (pointing to the CAPTAIN'S house) if I let go of you.
PHIL.
You are compelling me by force, whoever you are.
I gi ve you my word, that if you let go of me, I will go into that house where you bid me.
SCEL.
Then, now I let go of you.
PHIL.
And, as I'in let go, I'll go in here.
(Runs into the house of PERIPLECO­ MENUS.)SCEL.
She has acted with a woman's honour.
PAL.
Sceledrus, you've lost the prey through your hands;
as sure as possible she is the lady of our master.
Do you intend to act in this matter with spirit ?
SCEL.
How am I to act ?
PAL.
Bring me a sword out here from in-doors.
SCEL.
What will you do with it ?
PAL.
I'll break right into the house2;
and whatever man I see in-doors there caressing Philocomasium, I'll behead him on the spot.
SCEL.
And do you think that it was she ?PAL.
I' faith, it was she, sure enough.
SCEL.
But how she did dissemble.
PAL.
Go, bring me a sword out here.
SCEL.
I'll have it here thismoment.
(Goes into the CAP­ TAIN'S house.)PAL.
Beyond a doubt, neither any horse nor foot has so great a degree of boldness in carrying out anything with as much confidence as some women.
How cleverly and how skilfully she performed her part in both her characters!
-how her wary keeper, my fellow-servant, is being gulled!
'Tis most fortunate that the passage communicates through the party-wall.
SCEL.
Hallo!
Palæstrio, there's no occasion for the sword.
PAL.
How so ?-or what's the matter now ?
SCEL.
Our master's lady is there, at home.
PAL.
What ?
At home ?
SCEL.
She's lying on the sofa.
PAL.
Faith, but you've certainly brought on yourself a disagreable affair, according to what you report.
SCEL.
How so ?
PAL.
Inasmuch as you have dared to touch that lady next door here.
SCEL.
I' faith, I fear it much.
But no one shall ever make her to be any other than her own twin-sister.
PAL.
'Twas she, in troth, that you saw toying:
and, in fact, 'tis plain that it is she, as you remark.
SCEL.
What was there more likely than that I should have been undone, if I had spoken of it to my master.
PAL.
Then, if you're wise, you'll hold your tongue.
It befits a servant to know of more than he speaks.
I'm going to leave you, that I may not at all participate in your de­ signs.
And I shall go to our neighbour here ;
these turmoils of yours don't please me.
My master, if he comes, should he inquire for me, I shall be there;
send for me next door.
(Goes into the house of PERlPLECOMENUS.)SCEL.
Well, he's off;
nor cares he any more for his master's business than if he were not in his service.
For sure she really is now here in-doors in the house, for I myself found her just now lying down in our house.
I am resolved now to employ myself in watching.
(Places himself against the CAPTAIN'S door.)
PERIP.
Faith, but these men here, these servants of my neighbour the Captain, take me not to be a man, but a woman, so much do they trifle with me.
My lady guest, who came here yesterday from Athens with the gentleman, my guest, is she to be mauled about and made fun of here in the street-.
a lady, free-born and free ?SCEL. (aside).
By my troth, I'm undone.
He's coming in a straight line up towards me.
I fear that this matter may cause me great trouble, so far as I have heard this old gentleman speak.
PERIP.
I'll up to this fellow.
Was it you, Sceledrus, source of mischief, that were just now making fun of my lady guest before the house ?
SCEL.
Good neighbour, listen, I beg.
PERIP.
I, listen to you ?
SCEL.
I wish to clear myself.
PERIP.
You, clear yourself to me, who have done an action so gross and so unbecoming?
And because you are soldiers1, do you suppose, you gallows- bird, that you may do what you like with us ?
SCEL.
May IP PERIP.
But so may all the Gods and Goddesses prosper me, if a punishment with the rod2 is not given to you at my request, a long and lasting one, from morning to evening;
because you have been breaking my gutters and my tiles, while you were following there a monkey like your own self3;
because, too, you have been peeping down from there at my guest in my house, when he was caressing and fondling his mistress;
besides, you have dared to accuse the chaste lady of your master of criminality, and myself of a heinous offence;
and further, because you have dared to maul about my lady guest before my house.
If the punishment of the whip is not given to you, I will cause your master to be more laden with disgrace than the sea is full of waves in a heavy storm.
SCEL.
I am driven to such straits, Periplecomenus, that I don't know whether it is fitter for me rather to dispute this matter with you, or whether, if she is not our lady, and if our lady was not seen by me, it seems more proper for me to excuse myself to you;
as even now I don't know which I saw, so like is that guest of yours to our lady-if, indeed, she is not the same person.
PERIP.
Go into my house and look:
you'll soon see.
SCEL.
May I go ?
PERIP.
Why, I command you;
go and examine at your leisure.
SCEL.
I am determined to do so.
( Goes into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)PERIP.
(probably looking up to a window in the CAPTAIN'S house).
Ho!
Philocomasium1 !
pass instantly, with all speed, into my house;
'tis absolutely necessary.
Afterwards, when Sceledrus shall have come out from my house, pass quickly, with all haste, back again to your own house.
By my troth, now, I'm afraid she'll be making some blunder.
Should he not see the woman * * * * My door opens.
SCEL.
0 ye immortal Gods!
A woman more like, and more the same, who is not the same, I do not think the Gods could make.
PERIP.
What now ?
SCEL, I certainly merit chastisement.
PERIP.
What then ?
Is it she ?
SCEL.
Although 'tis she, 'tis not she.
PERIP.
Have you seen this lady ?
SCEL, I have seen both her and the gentleman, your guest, caressing and kissing.
PERlP.
Is it she ?
SCEL.
I know not.
PERIP.
Would you know for certain?
SCEL.
I should like to.
PERIP.
Go you this instant into your own house:
see whether your lady is within.
SCEL.
Very well:
you've advised me rightly.
I'll be out again to you this instant.
(Goes into the CAPTAIN'S house.)
PERIP.
I' faith, I never saw any man more cleverly fooled, and by more singular devices.
But here he is coming.
SCEL.
Periplecomenus, by Gods and men, and by my own folly, and by your knees!
I do beseech youPERIP.
What now ?
SCEL.
Pardon my ignorance and my folly;
now, at length, I know that I am half-witted, blind, and thoughtless;
for, behold!
Philocomasium is at home.
PERIP.
How, then, hang-dogl.
Have you seen them both ?
SCEL.
I have seen them.
PERIP.
I wish you to bring your master to me.
SCEL.
Indeed, I confess that I deserve a very great punishment;
and I own that I have done a wrong to your ladyguest.
But I thought that she was the lady of my master, to whom the Captain, my master, gave me as a keeper;
for it is not possible for water ever to be drawn more like to water from the same well, than is she to this lady guest of yours.
And I will confess, as well, that I did look through the skylight into your house.
PERIP.
Why shouldn't you confess what I saw myself ?
SCEL.
And there saw in your house this lady guest of yours, kissing.
PERIP.
You saw her ?
SCEL.
I saw her.
Why should I deny what I did see ?
But I fancied that I had seen Philoco­ masium.
PERIP.
And did you suppose me to be the very vilest of all men, in allowing1, with my own knowledge, such an injury so glaringly to be done to my neighbour ?
SCEL.
Now, at length, I am of opinion that it was done foolishly by me, when I come to understand the matter;
but still I did not do it with any ill intent.
PERIP.
Yes, but 'twas improperly done;
for it befits a person that is a servant to keep his eyes, and hands, and talk, asleep.
SCEL.
Now, if after this day I mutter anything, even what I know for certain, give me over to torture ;
I'll give myself up to you.
This time, prithee, do pardon me for this.
PERIP.
I shall subdue my feelings, so as to think that it was not done by you with malicious intent.
I will pardon you in this matter.
SCEL.
May the Gods bless you, then!
PERIP.
Troth now, as the Gods may prosper you, really do restrain your tongue henceforth;
even that which you do know, don't know, and don't you see what you do see.
SCEL.
You counsel me aright;
so I'm resolved to do.
Are you quite appeased ?
PERIP.
Away with you.
SCEL.
Is there aught else you now require of me ?
PERlP.
That you would know me not.
(Makes as if he is departing.)
SOEL. (aside).
He has been cajoling me.
How kindly he vouchsafed his favour not to be angry.
I know what plan he is upon:
that directly the Captain returns home from the Forum, I may be caught at home.
He and Palæstrio to­ gether have me in their power:
I have perceived that, and for some time I've known it.
I' faith, never will I be seek­ ing a bait this day from out of that wicker-net1.
For now somewhither will I betake myself, and for some days will I lie concealed until this turmoil is hushed and their resent­ ment is softened.
Enough punishment for my unlucky pra­ ting have I already merited.
But still, whatever befals me, I'll be off hence home.
(Goes into the CAPTAIN'S house.)
PERIP.
So he has departed hence.
I' faith, I know right well, that a dead pig full oft has more relish2 by far than a living one:
so bamboozled has he been, that he did not see what he really did see.
For his eyes, and ears, and thoughts have come over to us.
So far, 'tis right cleverly managed;
the lady has played her part most excellently.
I'll go back again to my Senate3;
for Palæstrio is now at home in my house, and now Sceledrus is gone from the door.
A full Senate can now be held.
I'll go in ;
lest while I am absent, there should be a distribution4 of their parts among them.
(Goes into his house.)PAL. (on entering he calls to PLEUSICLES and PERIPLE­ COMENUS, who are in the house of the latter).
Keep yourselves within1 doors, yet a moment, Pleusicles.
Let me first look out, that there may be no ambush anywhere, against that council which we intend to hold.
For now we have need of a safe place from which no enemy can win the spoils of our counsels.
For a well-devised plan is very often filched away, if the place for deliberating has not been chosen with care or with caution;
and what is well-advised is ill-advised if it proves of use to the enemy;
and if it proves of use to the enemy, it cannot otherwise than prove a detriment to yourself.
For if the enemy learn your plans, by your own self-same plans they tie your tongue and bind your hands;
and they do the very same to you that you intended to do to them.
But I'll spy about, lest any one, either in this direc­ tion on the left or on the right, should come like a huntsman on our counsels with his ears like toils1.
(Looks about.)
Quite vacant is the prospect hence right to the bottom of the street.
I'll call them out.
Hallo!
Periplecomenus and Pleusicles, come out!
PERIP.
Behold us here obedient to your call.
PAL.
The sway is easy over the good.
But I wish to know, if we are to carry out the matter on the same plan that we formed within ?
PERlP.
Why, in fact there's nothing can be more condu­ cive to our purpose.
Well, what say you, Pleusicles ?
PLEUS.
Can that displease me which pleases yourselves?
What person is there more my friend than your own self?
PERIP.
You speak kindly and obligingly.
PAL.
Faith, and so he ought to do.
PLEUS.
But this affair shockingly distresses me, and tor­ ments my very heart and body.
PERIP.
What is it that torments you ?
Tell me.
PLEUS.
That I should cause childish actions in a person of your years, and that I should require of you deeds that neither become yourself nor your virtues;
and that, with all your might, for my sake you are striving to aid me in my passion, and are doing actions of such a kind, as, when done, these years of yours are wont rather to avoid than follow.
I am ashamed that I cause you this trouble in your old age.
PERIP.
You are a person in love after a new fashion.
If, in fact, you are ashamed of anything you do, you are nothing of a lover.
You are rather the shadow of those who are in love, than a true lover, Pleusicles.
PLEUS.
Ought I to employ these years of yours in second­ ing my love ?
PERIP.
How say you ?
Do I seem to you so very much a subject for Acheron 1 ?
So much a bier's-man2 ?
Do I seem to you to have had so very long a life ?
Why, really, I am not more than four-and-fifty years old;
I see clearly with my eyes, I'in ready with my hands, I'm active with my feet.
PAL.
If he is seen by you to have white hair, he is by no means an old man in mind;
in him the natural strength of his mind is unimpaired.
PLEUS.
By my troth, for my part, I have found it to be Be as you say, Palæstrio ;
for, in fact, his kindness is quite that of a young man.
PERIP.
Yes, my guest, the more you make trial of it, the more you will know my courtesy towards you in your love.
PLEUS.
What need to know what's known already?
PERIP.
I'll show you more amiability on my part than I'L make mention of that you may have instances for proving it at home, and not have to seek it out of doors.
For unless one has loved him­ self, with difficulty he sees into the feelings of one in love.
But I have some little love and moisture in my body still, and not yet am I dried up for the pursuits of merriment and pleasure.
Either the merry banterer likewise, or the agreable boon-companion will I be;
no interrupter of another am I at a feast.
I bear in mind how properly to keep myself from proving disagreable to my fellow-guests;
and how to take a due share with my conversation, and to be silent as well in my turn, when the discourse belongs to another.
Far from being a spitter or hawker am I, far from being a dirty-nosed old fellow, too.
And never do I take liberties with any person's mistress when out in company ;
I don't snatch up the dainty bits before another, nor take the cup before my turn;
nor, through wine, do dissensions ever arise on my account at the convivial board.
If there is any one there that is disagreable, I go off home;
I cut the parley short.
Stretched at my ease, I devote myself to pleasure, love, and mirth.
In fine, at Ephesus was I born, not among the Apulians, not at Animula1.
PLEUS.
0 what a most delightful old man, if he possesses the qualities he mentions!
Why, troth, surely now, he was brought up in the very rearing of Venus.
PAL.
Why, in fact, you will not find another person who is of his years, more accomplished in every respect, or who is more a friend to his friend.
PLEUS.
By my troth, your whole manners really do show marks of first-rate breeding.
Find me three men of such manners against a like weight in double-distilled gold1.
PERIP.
I'll make you confess that I really am a youngster in my manners;
so abounding in kindnesses will I prove myself to you in every respect.
Should you have need of an advocate, severe or fierce ?
I am he.
Have you need of one that is gentle ?
You shall say that I am more gentle than the sea is when hush'd, and something more balmy will I prove than is the Zephyr breezed
In this same person will I display to you either the most jovial boon-companion, or the first-rate trencher-man3, and the best of caterers.
Then, as for dancing, there is no ballet-master that is so supple as I.PAL. (to PLEUSICLES).
What could you wish added to these accomplishments, if the option were given you ?
PLEUS.
That thanks could be returned by me to him in degree equal to his deserts, and to yourself, to both of whom I feel that I am now the cause of extreme anxiety.
But it is grievous to me to be the cause of so great expense to you.
PERIP.
You are a simpleton.
For, if you lay anything out on a bad wife and upon an enemy, that is an expense;
that which is laid out on a deserving guest and a friend is gain;
as that, which is expended upon sacred rites, is a profit to the wise man.
By the blessing of the Gods, I have enough, with which to receive you with hospitality in my house.
Eat, drink, indulge your tastes with me, and surfeit yourself with enjoyments ;
my house is at your service, myself likewise do I wish to be at your service.
For, through the blessing of the Gods, I may say that, by reason of my wealth, I could have married a dowered wife of the best family;
but I don't choose to introduce an everlasting female barker at me into my house.
PLEBS.
Why don't you choose ?
For 'tis a delightful thing to be the father of children [liberos].
PERIP.
Troth, 'tis very much sweeter by far to be free1 [liberum] yourself.
For a good wife, if it is possible for her to be married anywhere on earth, where can I find her ?
But am I to take one home who is never to say this to me, " Buy me some wool, my dear, with which a soft and warm cloak may be made, and good winter under-clothes2, that you mayn't catch cold this winter-weather;
" such an expression as this you can never hear from a wife, but, before the cocks crow, she awakes me from my sleep, and says, " Give me some money, my dear, with which to make my mother a present on the Calends3, give me some money to make pre­ serves ;
give me something to give on the Quinquatrus4 to the sorceress5, to the woman who interprets the dreams, to the prophetess, and to the female diviner;
besides, 'tis im­ possible for me, in civility, not to fee the expiating woman;
for long has1 the mattress-maker2 been grumbling, because she has received nothing;
besides, the midwife found fault with me, that too little had been sent for her.
What!
arn't you going to send something to the nurse that brings up the young slave 3?
It's a shame if nothing's sent her;
with what a brow4 she does look at me."
These and many other expenses of the women like to these frighten me from a wife, to be uttering speeches to me like to this.
PAL.
In good sooth, the Gods are propitious to you;
for so soon as you lose this liberty, you will not easily reinstate yourself in the same condition.
PLEUS.
You are a person who are able to counsel wisely both for another and for yourself.
But 'tis some merit for a man of noble family and of ample wealth to rear children-a memorial of his race and of himself.
PERIP.
Since
I have many relations, what need have I of children ?
Now I live well and happily, and as I like, and as contents my feelings.
For I shall bequeath my property to my relations, and divide it among them.
These, like chil­ dren, pay attentions to me;
they come to see how I do, or what I want;
before it is daybreak they are with me;
they make inquiry how I have enjoyed my sleep in the night.
Them will I have for children who are ever sending presents to me.
Are they sacrificing-they give a greater part of it to me than to themselves;
they take mehome with them to share the entrails1;
they invite me to their houses to breakfast and to dinner.
He thinks himself most unfortunate, who has sent but very little to me.
They vie with one another with their presents;
I say in a low voice to myself:
"
They are gaping after my pro­ perty ;
while, in their emulation, they are nourishing me and loading me with presents."
PAL.
Upon right good grounds and right well do you fully understand yourself and your own interests, and if you are happy, sons twofold and threefold have you.
PERIP.
Troth, if I had had them, enough anxiety should I have had from my children.
should have been everlastingly tormented in mind;
but if perchance one had had a fever, I think I should have died.
Or if one, in liquor, had tumbled anywhere from his horse, I should have been afraid that he had broken his legs or neck on that occasion.
PAL.
'Tis right that riches should come, and that long life should be granted to this man, who both husbands his pro­ perty and yet enjoys himself and has kind wishes for his friends.
PLEUS.
0 what a delightful person !
So may the Gods and Goddesses prosper me, 'twere right the Deities should so ordain that all should not live after one rule as to the duration of life.
Just as he who is a trusty market-officer2 sets their prices on the wares ;
as that which is good or valuable is sold according to its excellence, and that which is worthless, according to the faultiness of the commodity, deprives its owner of its price;
so were it right that the Gods should portion out the life of man, so as to give to him who is kindly disposed a long life, and speedily to deprive of exist­ ence those who are reprobate and wicked.
If they had pro­ vided this, bad men would both have been fewer, and with less hardihood would they do their wicked deeds ;
and then, those who were good men, of them there would have been a more plenteous harvest.
PERlP.
He who would blame the ordinances of the Gods must be foolish and ignorant.
* * *
At present we must at once have an end of these matters;
for now I want to go to market, that, my guest, according to your own deserts and mine, I may entertain you hospitably at my house, heartily and with right hearty cheer.
PLEUS.
I am content with1 the expense that I have been to you already.
For no guest can be thus hospitably entertained by a friend, but that when he has been there three days running, he must now become a bore;
but when he is pro­ longing his stay for ten successive days, he is a nuisance to the household.
Although the master willingly allows it, the servants grumble.
PERIP.
I have trained up the servants that are in my ser­ vice, my guest, not to rule over me, or for me to be obedient to them.
If that is disagreable to them which is agreable to me, I steer my own course2;
that which they don't like must still be done at their peril, and whether they like it or no.
Now, as I intended, I shall go to market.
PLEUS.
If you are resolved, do cater somewhat within bounds, at no great expense;
anything is enough for mesoPERIP.
Won't you now4 have done with that old-fashioned and antiquated talk?
Now surely, guest, you are using the cant of the vulgar5.
For they are in the habit of saying, when they have taken their places, when dinner is put on table:
"
What necessity was there for you to go to this great expense on our account P Surely you were mad, for this same dinner was enough for ten persons."
What has been pro­ vided on their account they find fault with;
they eat it up, however.
PAL.
Troth, in that self-same fashion 'tis generally done.
How clever and shrewd is his discernment.
PERIP.
But these same persons never say, although such an abundance has been provided, " Do order that to be taken off;
do take away this dish;
remove this gammon of bacon, I'll have none of it;
put aside that piece of pork;
this conger's good1 when cold;
remove it, take and put it aside."
You hear none of them saying this in earnest, but they stretch themselves out, while with half their bodies2 on the table, they are indulging their appetite.
PAL.
How cleverly the good soul has described their bad manners.
PERIP.
I have not said a hundredth part of what I could have enlarged upon had there been leisure for the matter.
PAL.
The business, then, that we are about-to that we ought first to turn our thoughts.
Do you both, now, give me your attention.
I have need, Periplecomenus, of your assistance;
for I have hit upon a pleasant trick, how this Captain with his long locks may be fleeced quite closer and how we may effect a means for Philocomasium, and this her lover, that he may carry her off hence, and have her as his own.
PERIP.
I wish this plan to be imparted to me.
PAL.
And I, wish that ring of yours to be imparted to me.
PEEIP.
For what purpose is it to be used ?
PAL.
When I have got it, I will impart the plan of my devices.
PERIP.
Take and use it.
(Gives him the ring.)PAL.
Take from me in return the plan of my contrivance that I have hit upon.
PERIP.
We are listening to you with most attentive car.
PAL.
My master is such a shocking rake among the women, that I think no one ever was his equal, nor ever will be.
PERIP.
I believe the same as well.
PAL.
He boasts, too, that his beauty exceeds that of Alexander1;
and, therefore, he says that all the women2 in Ephesus of their own accord are courting him.
PERIP.
Aye, faith, many there are who could wish3 that you were now telling an untruth about him.
But I am convinced full well that it is as you say.
For that reason, Palæstrio, do compress your words in as short a compass as ever you possibly can.
PAL.
Can you, then, find any woman of agreable person, whose mind and body are full of merriment and subtlety ?
PERIP.
Free by birth, or bondwoman made free ?
PAL.
I consider that a matter of indifference, so that you find one who is greedy for gain, who supports her body by her charms, who has, too, her senses all awake;
as for her heart, that cannot be so, as none of them have one.
PERIP.
Do you want one that has4 taken her degrees, or one as yet a novice in the art ?
PAL.
One sober but plump5, a juicy bit;
as taking a one as ever you can find, and one very young.
PERIP.
Why, I have one, a dependant of mine, a courtesan, a very young woman.
But what is the occasion for her ?
PAL.
For you to bring her home at once to your house as your wife, and, for that reason, to bring her there dressed out, so that she may wear her locks with her hair arranged, and fillets after the fashion of matrons1, and may pretend that she is your wife ;
so you must instruct her.
PERIP.
I am at a loss what road you are taking.
PAL.
Well, you shall know.
But what sort of a maid has she ?
PERIP.
She is a rare clever one.
PAL.
We have need of her as well;
so give your instructions to the damsel and her maid, to pretend that she is your wife and is doting upon this Captain;
and as though she had given this ring to her maid, then she to me, that I might deliver it to the Captain ;
and I must be as though it were a go-between in this matter.
PERIP.
I hear you ;
don't stun my ears as if I were deaf.
PAL.
I myself will go straightway to him ;
I'll say that it has been brought and delivered to me from your wife, in order that I might introduce her to him.
He'll be distractedly longing for her at home, a scoundrel that cares for nothing else whatever but intriguing.
PERIP.
If you had commissioned the Sun himself to search them out, he couldn't have found, better than myself, two more cleverly suited for this business.
Be of good courage about it.
PAL.
Take you every care then.
There is need of despatch.
(-EXit PERIPLECOMENUS.PAL.
Now, do you listen, Pleusicles.
PLEUS.
I am all at­ tention to you.
PAL.
Take care of this.
When the Captain comes home, do you remember not to call Philocomasium by her name.
PLEUS.
What am I to call her ?
PAL.
Glycera.
PLErUS.
The same, you mean, that was agreed upon a little time since.
PAL.
Hush!
—Be off.
PLEUS.
I'll remember;
but still I don't know what use it is to keep it in my mind.
PAL.
But.
I will tell you.
at the time, when occasion shall require.
Meanwhile, be quiet;
so that, bye and bye, when he too shall be acting his part1, you may, on the instant, be minding your cue.
PLEUS.
I'll go in then.
PAL.
Go, and do take care steadily to follow my instructions.
(PLEUSICLES goes into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)PAL.
What mighty turmoils I create!
What mighty en­ gines I do set to work!
This very day I shall take his mistress away from the Captain, if my soldiers are only well drilled2.
But I'll call him out.
(Goes to the door and calls.)
Hallo!
Sceledrus, if you are not busy, come out to the front of the house;
I, Palæstrio, call you.
LucR.
Sceledrus is not at leisure.
PAL.
Why so ?
LUCR.
He's fast asleep, gulping3.
PAL.
How, gulping?
LUCR.
He's snoring, 'twas that I meant to say :
but, be­ cause tis very like gulping when you are snoringPAL.
What!
Is Sceledrus asleep in-doors ?
LUCR.
Not with his nose, in fact;
for with that he is call.
ing out loud enough.
PAL.
He has taken a cup by stealth ;
the butler has lately tapped a cask of nardine.
Oho!
you rascal, you are his deputy-butler2.
Oho!
LUCR.
What do you mean ?
PAL.
How has he thought fit to go to sleep ?
LUCR.
With his eyes, I suppose.
PAL.
I don't ask you that, you vagabond.
Step this way:
you're undone now, unless I know the truth.
Did you draw the wine for him ?
LUCR.
I did not draw it.
PAL.
Do you deny it ?
LUCR.
I' faith, I do deny it undoubtedly;
for he charged me not to tell.
I really didn't just3 draw for him eight half pints into a pitcher, and, when drawn, he didn't just drink it hot4, at his breakfast.
PAL.
And you didn't just drink as well?
LUCR.
The Gods confound me if I did drink-if I could drink.
PAL.
Why so ?
LUCR.
Because, in fact, I only sipped;
for it was too hot;
it burnt my throat.
PAL.
Some are gloriously drunk, while others are drinking vinegar-water1.
The cellar's trusted to an honest butler, as well as under-butler.
LUCR.
I' faith, you'd be doing the same, if it was en­ trusted to you.
Since you can't follow our example, you are envious now.
PAL.
Come, now, did he ever draw any wine before this ?
Answer me, you rascal.
And, that you may understand it, I give you this notice:
if you purposely tell me an untruth, you shall be put to the torture.
LUCR.
Indeed so ?
That you may inform, forsooth, that I told you;
and then I shall be turned out of my fattening post in the cellar, that you may find another under-butler to draw for your own self.
PAL.
On my honour, I will not;
come, speak out boldly to me.
LUCR.
By my troth, I never saw him draw any.
But thus was it;
he requested me, and then I drew it.
PAL.
Think of that now!
very frequently, I guess, the casks were standing on their heads2 there.
LUCR.
No, faith, the casks would not3 have stood so very badly there.
But there happened to be in the cellar a bit of a slippery spot;
a two-pint pot was placed there, near the casks, in this fashion (shows the way).
Frequently, that was filled ten times in a day.
When the pot acted the revelled the casks were all tottering.
PAL.
Get you gone in-doors.
Both of you, I find, are acting the revellers in the wine-cellar.
I' faith, I shall fetch my master home just now from the Forum.
LUCR. (aside).
I'm ruined.
My master, when he comes home, will have me tortured, when he knows of these doings.
I' faith, I'll fly somewhither, and put off this punishment to another day.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Don't you tell him1, I do entreat you most earnestly.
(He is going.)PAL.
Whither are you betaking yourself?
Lues.
I am sent elsewhere:
I'll come back here just now.
PAL.
Who has sent you ?
LUCR.
Philocomasium.PAL.
Go;
be back directly.
LUCR.
If it is divided, prithee do you only take my share of the punishment while I'm away.
(-Exit LUCRlO.PAL.
So—I understand what scheme the lady is upon.
Because Sceledrus is asleep, she has sent her under-keeper away out of doors, whilst she may pass from our house to next door.
That's all right.
(Looks down the street.)
But Periplecomenus is bringing here a woman of very comely appearance, her, for whom I commissioned him.
By my faith, the Gods are helping us in this matter.
How becomingly drest she struts along2, not like a Courtesan.
This business is prospering charmingly in our hands.
(Stands aside.)PERIP. (as he advances).
I have explained the whole affair, Acroteleutium, to you, and, Milphidippa, to you as well.
If you don't well understand this device and plan, I wish you to hear it all over again.
If you comprehend it aright, there is something else that we may speak of in preference.
ACROT.
I' faith, it would be folly, and ignorance, and fool­ ishness, for me to engage in the service of another, or to promise you my assistance, if, in its fabrication, I did not know how to be either mischievous or clever at deceiving.
PERU.
But, 'tis better for you to be instructed.
ACROT.
Really I don't understand of what great use it is for a Courtesan to be instructed.
How now!
have I told you all in vain, after my ears had drunk in the draughts1 of your discourse, in what fashion it was possible for the Cap­ tain to be cajoled ?
PERU.
But no one, unaided, is sufficiently perfect;
for full oft have I seen many a person lose the road to good ad­ vice before they had found it.
ACROT.
If a woman has anything to do mischievously and maliciously, in that case her memory is immortal at remem­ bering it for everlasting;
but if anything is to be done for a good purpose, or honestly, it will fall out that those same women will become oblivious that instant, and be unable to remember.
PERIP.
Therefore do I fear that same, because both those things happen to be about to be done by us;
for that will be a benefit to me in which you both will be acting mischievously towards the Captain.
ACROT.
So long as we do anything that's good, not know­ ing it, don't you fear.
No woman is awkward Have no apprehensions, they are ready for the worst.
PERIP.
So it befits you.
Do you follow me.
PAL. (advancing).
Why do I hesitate to go and accost them ?
PERIP.
Well met, and opportunely, Palæstrio.
See, here they are whom you commissioned me to bring, and in the very dress.
PAL.
Well done :
accept my thanks.
I am glad that you have come safe.
I' faith, you bring them nicely dressed.
Pa­ læstrio salutes Acroteleutium.
ACROT.
Prithee, who's this, that calls me so familiarly by name ?
PERIP.
This is our master-plotter.
ACROT.
Health to you, master-plotter.
PAL.
And health to you.
But, tell me, has he any way given you full instructions ?
PERIP.
I bring them both thoroughly prepared.
PAL.
I'd like to hear how.
I'm afraid lest you should be making some mistake.
PERIP.
I have added to your instructions nothing new of my own.
ACROT.
I suppose you wish the Captain, your master, to be gulled.
PAL.
You've said what's true.
ACROT.
Cleverly and skilfully, adroitly and pleasantly, the whole thing is planned.
PAL.
In fact, I wish you to pretend to be his wife.
(Points to PERIPLECOMENUS.)ACROT.
That shall be done.
PAL.
To pretend as though you had set your affection on the Captain.
ACROT.
And so it shall be.
PAL.
And as though this affair is managed through me, as the go-between, and your servant-maid.
ACROT.
You might have made a good prophet;
for you tell what is to be.
PAL.
As though this maid of yours had conveyed from you this ring to me, which I was then to deliver to the Cap­ tain, in your name.
ACROT.
You say what's true.
PERIP.
What need is there to mention these things now, which they remember so well ?
ACROT.
Still, it is better.
For think of this, my patron ;
when the shipwright is skilful, if he has once laid down the keel exact to its lines, 'tis easy to build the ship, when Now this keel of ours has been skil­ fully laid and firmly placed;
the workmen and the master­ builders are not unskilled in this business.
If he who fur­ nishes the timber1 does not retard us in giving what is needed, I know the adroitness of our ingenuity-soon will the ship be got ready.
PAL.
You know the Captain, my master, then ?
ACROT.
'Tis strange you should ask me.
How could I not know that scorn of the public, that swaggering, frizzle­ headed, perfumed debauchee ?
PAL.
But does he know you ?
ACROT.
He never saw me:
how, then, should he know who I am ?
PAL.
'Tis most excellent what you say.
For that reason, i' faith, the thing will be able to be managed all the more cleverly.
ACROT.
Can you only find me the man, and then be easy as to the rest P If I don't make a fool of the fellow, do you lay all the blame on me.
PAL.
Well, go you in then;
apply yourselves to this business with all your skill.
ACROT.
Trust me for that1.
PAL.
Come, Periplecomenus, do you conduct them at once in-doors.
I'm off to the Forum ;
I'll meet him, and give him this ring, and will tell him that it has been delivered to me from your wife, and that she is dying for him.
As soon as we shall have come from the Forum, do you send her (points to MILPHIDIPPA) to our house as though she were privately sent to him.
PERIP.
We'll do so ;
trust us for that.
PAL.
Do you only attend to the business;
I'll now polish him off with a pretty burden on his back.
(Exit.PERIP.
Go, with good luck to you, manage the matter cleverly.
(To ACROTELEUTIUM.)
But now, if I shall manage this adroitly, that my guest can this day gain the mistress of the Captain, and carry her off hence to Athens;
if, I say, this day we shall succeed in this plan, what shall I give you for a present ?
ACROT.
If now the lady seconds our efforts on her part, I think it will be right cleverly and adroitly managed.
When a comparison shall be made of our artifices, I have no fear that I shall not prove superior in the cleverness of my contrivances.
PERIP.
Let's go in-doors, then, that we may deeply weigh these plans, that carefully and cautiously we may carry out what is to be done, so that, when the Captain comes, there may be no tripping.
ACROT.
You are delaying us with your talk.
(They go into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)PYRG.
'Tis a, pleasure what you do, if it succeeds agreably and to your mind.
For I this day have sent my Parasite to King Seleucus, to lead those soldiers, that I have levied, hence to Seleucus;
in order that they may defend his kingdom till I have leisure to attend in person.
PAL.
Why don't you attend to your own concerns rather than those of Seleucus.
What a charming new proposal is being offered to you through me as the negotiator.
PYRG.
Well then, I lay all other things aside, and I give my attention to you.
Speak out:
my ears, in fact, I surren­ der at your disposal.
PAL.
Look around, then, that no one here may be an eaves­ dropper for our discourse ;
for this business was entrusted me to transact with you in private.
PYRG. (looks around).
There's no one near.
PAL.
In the first place, receive from me this pledge of affection.
(Gives him the ring.)PYRG.
What's this ?
Whence comes it ?
PAL.
From a charming and a handsome lady, one who loves you, and dotes upon your extreme beauty.
Her maid just now gave me the ring that I might then give it to you.
'PYRG.
What ?
Is she free born or a freed woman, made free from a slave by the Prætor's rod1 ?
PAL.
Pshaw!
Should I presume to be the bearer of a mes­ sage to you from a person once a slave, who cannot sufficiently answer the demands of the free women who are longing for you ?
PYRG.
Is she wife, or is she widow ?
PAL.
She is both wife and widow.
PYRG.
In what way is it possible for the same woman to be a wife and a widow ?
PAL.
Because she is a young woman married to an old man.
PYRG.
That's good.
PAL.
She is of genteel and charming person.
PYRG.
Beware of misrepresenting.
PAL.
It is alone worthy to be compared with your own charms.
PYRG.
By my faith, you make her out to be a beauty.
But who is she ?PAL.
The wife of that old gentleman, Periplecomenus, next door.
She is dying for you, and wishes to leave him;
she hates the old fellow.
Now she has begged me to entreat and beseech you that you will give her your support and assistance.
PYRG.
I' faith, I'm ready for my part if she desires it.
PAL.
Doesn't she long for it ?
PYRG.
What shall we do with that mistress of mine, who is at my house ?
PAL.
Why, do you bid her to be gone about her business, wherever she chooses;
as her twin-sister has come here to Ephesus, and her mother, and they are come to fetch her.
PYRG.
Ha !
what's that you say ?
Has her mother come to Ephesus ?
PAL.
Those say so who know it.
PYRG.
I' faith, a charming opportunity for me to turn the wench out of doors.
PAL.
Aye, but do you wish to do the thing handsomely ?
PYRG.
Speak out, and give me your advice.
PAL.
Do you wish to pack her off forthwith, that she may quit you with a good grace ?
PYRG.
I do so wish.
PAL.
Then this is the thing you must do.
You have a superabundance of wealth;
bid the woman to keep as a present for herself the gold and trinkets which you have supplied her with, and to take herself off from your house wherever she likes.
PYRG.
It pleases me what you say;
but yet, only think, if I should lose her, and the other change her mind ?
PAL.
Pshaw!
you're over nice;
a lady, that loves you as her own eyes.
PYRG.
Ve us befriends me.
PAL.
Hist!
hush!
the door is opening;
come this way a little out of sight.
(MILPHI­ DIPPA comes out of the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)
This is her fly-boat-ber go-between, that's coming out there.
PYRG.
How so-fly-boat ?
PAL.
This is her maid that is coming ut of the house, she that brought that ring which I delivered to you.
PYRG.
I' faith, she too is a prettyish wench.
PAL.
This one is a little monkey and an owl 1 in comparison with the other.
Do you see how she hunts around with her eyes, and goes fowling about with her ears.
(They stand aside.)MIL. (as she enters).
My Circus, then2, is before the house, where my sports are to take place.
I'll make pretence, as though I didn't see them, or knew as yet that they are here.
PYRG.
Hush!
let's quietly listen, whether any mention is made of me.
MIL. (aloud).
Is there no one near at hand here, to attend to another's business rather than his own?—to prowl after3 me to see what I'm about P No one who is feeding this evening4 at his own expense ?
I dread such men as these, lest they should now come in the way, or prove an hindrance somehow, should my mistress privately pass from her house this way, who is so enamoured of his person, who so dotes upon this very charming man with his exceeding beauty-the Captain Pyrgopolinices.
PYRG.
And doesn't she dote upon me, too ?
She is praising my beauty.
PAL.
I' faith, her language stands in need of no ashes5.
PYRG.
For what reason?
PAL.
Why, because her lan­ guage is clean spoken and far from slovenly.
Whatever she says about yourself, she handles it in no slovenly way.
A ,id, then, besides, she herself is a very pretty and a very dainty wench.
PYRG.
Troth, indeed, she has made an impression already, Palæstrio, at first sight.
PAL.
What!
before you have seen the other with your eyes ?
PYRG.
What I see, in that I have faith for myself;
for this mackerel1, in the absence of the mullet, compels me to be in love with her.
PAL.
I' faith, you really mustn't be falling in love with ner, she's engaged to me.
If the other weds you to-day, forthwith I shall take this one for my wife.
PYRG.
Why, then, do you delay to accost her ?
PAL.
Follow me this way, then.
PYRG.
I am your lackey at your heels-.MIL. (aloud).
I wish that I had an opportunity of meeting him on account of whom I came here out of doors.
PAL. (accosting her).
It shall be so, and you shall have what you so greatly wish;
be of good courage, don't fear;
there is a certain person who knows where that is which you are seeking.
MIL.
Who's that I hear at hand ?
PAL.
The sharer of your plans and the partaker of your secrets.
MIL.
I' faith, then, what I do conceal I don't conceal.
PAL.
Aye, but still you don't conceal it this way.
MIL.
HOW SO ?
PAL.
From the uninitiated you conceal them.
I am sure and trustworthy to you.
MIL.
Give me the sign, if you are one of these votaries3.
PAL.
A certain lady loves a certain gentleman.
MIL.
Faith, many ladies do that indeed.
PAL.
But not many ladies send a present from off their fingers.
MIL.
Aye, I know now.
You've now made the matter level for me instead of steep.
But is there a certain person here ?
PAL.
Either he is or he is not.
MIL.
Come aside with me alone, in private.
PAL.
For a short or for a lengthy conversation ?
MIL.
For three words only.
PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
I'll return to you this in­ stant.
PYRG.
What ?
Shall I be standing here in the meanwhile, with such charms and valorous deeds, thus to no purpose ?
PAL.
Submit to it and wait;
for you am I doing this service.
PYRG.
Make haste ;
I am tortured with waiting.
PAL.
You know that commodities of this kind are only wont to be reached step by step.
PYRG.
Well, well;
as is most agreable to yourself.
PAL. (aside).
There is no stone more stupid than this fellow.
I now return to you.
(To MIL HIDIPPA.)
What would you with me ?
(Retires with her to distance.)MIL.
In the way in which I received it of you a short time since, I bring you back your clever lot;
my story is as though she were dying with love for him.
PAL.
That 1 understand.
Do you commend his beauty and his appearance, and make mention of his prowess.
MIL.
For that purpose I am armed at all points1, as I have shown you before already.
On the other hand, do you give all attention, and be on the watch, and take your cue2 from my words.
PYRG.
Prithee do now, in fine, give n e some share in the business;
step this way this instant, I beg.
PAL.
(goes up to him).
Here I am.
If you wish for aught, give me your commands.
PYRG.
What is she saying to you ?
PAL.
She is saying that her mistress is lamenting, and, in tears, is tormenting and afflicting herself because she wishes for you, and because she possesses you not;
for that reason has she been sent here to you.
PYRG.
Bid her approach.
PAL.
But do you know how you are to act ?
Pretend that you are full of disdain, as though it pleased you not;
exclaim against me, because I make you so common to the mob.
PYRG.
I remember, and I'll follow your instructions.
PAL.
I'll call her, then, who is inquiring after you.
PYRG.
If she wants anything, let her come.
PAL.
Wench, if you want anything, step this way.
MIL. (approaching).
Save you, charmer1.
PYRG.
She makes mention of my surname.
May the Gods grant you whatever you may desire.
MIL.
To pass life with you is the wish ofPYRG.
You are wishing too much.
MIL.
I am not speak­ ing of myself, but of my mistress, who is dying for you.
PYRG.
Many others are wishing for the same thing, who have not the opportunity.
MIL.
By my troth, 'tis not to be wondered at;
you set a high value on yourself-a person so handsome, and so illus­ trious for his prowess, and so valorous in his deeds!
0 ! was there ever any one more worthy to be a man ?PAL. (aside).
I' faith, the filthy fellow is not a human being;
indeed, I think there is something more human in a vulture2.
PYRG. (aside).
Now I shall make myself of importance, since she so praises me up.
(Struts about.)PAL. (aside).
Do you see the blockhead, how he struts ?
(To PYRGOPOLINICES.)
But will you not answer her;
she is the woman that's come from the lady whom I was mentioning just now.
PYRG.
But from which one of them ?
For there are so many courting me, I cannot remember them all.
MIL.
From her who strips her own fingers and adorns your fingers;
for I delivered to him (pointing to PALÆSTRIO) that ring from her who is sighing for you, and then he to you.
PYRG.
Tell me, wench, what is it yon want then ?
MIL.
That you will not despise her who is sighing for you;
who lives now but in your life:
whether she is to exist or not, her hope is in you alone.
PYRG.
What does she want then ?
MIL.
To talk with you, to embrace you, and to be intimate with you.
For un­ less you bring her succour, she will soon be quite desponding in her mind.
Come, my Achilles, let that be done which I entreat;
save her, charmer, by your charming ways.
Call forth your kind disposition, stormer of cities, slayer of kings.
PYRG.
0! by my troth, 'tis a vexatious thing!
(To PALÆSTRIO.)
How often, whip-scoundrel, have I forbidden you to make promises of my attention thus common.
PAL.
Do you hear that, hussy ?
I have told you already, and I now tell you again, unless a fee is given to this boar­ pigl, he cannot possibly throw away his attentions in any quarter.
MIL.
A fee shall be given, as large as he shall demand.
PAL.
He requires a talent of gold, in Philippean pieces.
Less he will take from no one.
MIL.
0, by my troth, but that's too little, surely.
PYRG.
By nature there's no avarice in me;
I have riches enough.
I' faith !
I've more than a thousand measures2 full of Philippean gold coins.
PAL.
Besides your treasures.
Then, of silver, he has mountains, not ingots;
Ætna is not so high.
MIL. (aside).
By the stars ! 0, what a lie!
PAL. (to MILPHIDIPPA, aside).
How rarely I am playing him off!
MIL. (to PALÆSTRIO, aside).
And I;
how do I do it?
Ain't I gulling him ?PAL. (aside).
Rarely.
MIL.
But, prithee, do let me go now.
PAL. (to the CAPTAIN).
But do you give her some answer, either that you will do it, or that you won't do it.
Why cause this poor lady so much anguish of mind, who has never de­ served any ill of you?
PYRG.
Bid her come to me herself.
Tell her that I will do everything that she requires.
MIL.
You now act as it is proper for you to act, since you wish the same yourself that she is wishing.
PAL. (to himself, aside).
No poor faculty of invention has she.
MIL.
Since too you have not scouted your petitioner, and nave suffered me to prevail upon you.
(Aside to PALÆS­ TRIO.)
How now ?
Haven't I played him off?
PAL. (aside to MILPHIDIPPA).
Faith, I couldn't refrain from laughing.
MIL. (aside to PALÆSTRIO).
Yes;
and for the same reason I turned in this direction away from you.
PYRG.
By my troth, wench, you don't understand how great an honor I am now paying her.
MIL.
I know, and I shall tell her so.
PAL.
To another he could have sold his favours for his weight in gold.
MIL.
I' faith, I believe you in that.
PAL.
Of those that are parents by him true warriors are born, and his sons live eight hundred years.
PYRG.
Why, straight on, from age to age, they live for a thousand years.
PAL.
I spoke within limits, for the reason that she mightn't suppose I was telling lies to her.
MIL. (aside).
I burst, I die!
(Aloud.)
How many years will he live himself whose sons live so long ?
PYRG.
Wench, I was born the day after Jupiter was borr of Ops.PAL.
If he had only been born the day before the othei was, he would have had the realms of heaven.
MIL. (aside to PALÆSTRIO).
Now, now, prithee, no more do let me get away from you, if I can, alive.
PAL.
Why don't you go then, as you have your answer?
MIL.
I'll go, and I'll bring her here, on whose behalf I am employed.
Is there aught else you wish ?
PYRG.
May I never be more handsome than I am at pre­ sent ;
so much trouble do my good looks cause me.
PAL.
Why do you stay now ?
Why don't you go ?
MIL.
I'm going.
PAL. (aside to MILPHIDIPPA).
And tell her, too, do you hear, cleverly and correctly, what has passed.
MIL. (to PALÆSTRIO).
So that her very heart may leap for joy.
PAL. (aside to MILPHIDIPPA) If Philocomasium is there, tell her to pass through into our house;
that the Captain here.
MIL. (to PALÆSTRIO).
She is there with my mistress for, on the sly, they have been overhearing1 this con­ versation.
PAL. (aside to MILPIIIDIPPA).
'Twas cleverly done;
here­ after they will take their cue the more readily from this conversation.
MIL. (to PALÆSTRIO) .
You are delaying me.
I'm off.
PAL. (to MILPHIDIPPA).
I'm not delaying you, nor touching you, nor 2I'm mum.
PYRG.
Bid her make haste to come out here;
we'll give our first attention to this matter especially.
(MILPHIDIPPA goes into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)PYRG.
What do you advise me now to do, Palæstrio, about my mistress ?
For this lady can by no means be re­ ceived into my house before I have sent the other away.
PAL.
Why consult me what you are to do ?
So far as I am concerned, I have told you by what method that can be effected in the gentlest manner.
The gold trinkets and female clothing with which you have furnished her, let her keep it all for herself:
let her take it, be off, and carry it away:
tell her that it is high time for her to go home;
say that her twin-sister and her mother are come, in company with whom she may go straight home.
PYRG.
How do you know that they are here PPAL.
Because, with my own eyes, I've seen her sister here.
PYRG.
Have you met her ?
PAL.
I have met her.
PYRG.
And did she seem a brisk wench ?
PAL.
You are wishing to have everything.
PYRG.
Where did the sister say her mother was ?
PAL.
The captain that brought them told me that she was in bed, on board the ship, with sore and inflamed eyes.
This captain of the ship is lodging with them next door.
PYRG.
And he, too, is he a very fine fellow ?
PAL.
Away with you, if you please.
What have you1 to do with him ?
You have your hands quite full enough with the women.
Attend to this for the present.
PYRG.
As to that advice you were giving me, I wish you to have afew words with her upon that subject.
For, really, a conversation on that subject with her is more becoming2 for you.
PAL.
What is more advisable than for you to go yourself, and transact your own concerns ?
You must say that it is absolutely necessary for you to marry:
that your relations are persuading, your friends are urging, you.
PYRG.
And do you think so ?
PAL.
Why shouldn't I think so ?
PYRG.
I'll go in, then.
Do you, in the mean time, keep watch here before the house, that when the other woman comes out you may call me out.
PAL.
Do you only mind the business that you are upon.
PYRG.
That, indeed, is resolved upon.
For if she will not go out of her own accord, I'll turn her out by force.
PAL.
Do you take care how you do that;
but rather let her go from your house with a good graceS, and give her those things that I mentioned.
The gold trinkets and apparel, with which you furnished her, let her take away.
PYRG.
By my troth, I wish she would.
PAL.
I think you'll easily prevail upon her.
But go in- doors ;
don't linger here.
PYRG.
I obey you.
( Goes into his house).
PAL. (to the AUDIENCE).
Now, does be really appear to be anything dif­ ferent from what, awhile ago, I told you he was, this wench­ ing Captain ?
Now it is requisite that Acroteleutium should come to me, her maid too, and Pleusicles.
0 Jupiter!
and does not opportunity favour me in every respect ?
For those whom I especially wished to see, I perceive at this moment coming out here from our neighbour's.
ACROT.
Follow me;
at the same time look around, that there may be no overlooker.
MIL.
Faith, I see no one, only him whom we want to meet.
PAL.
Just as I want you.
MIL.
How do you do, our master-plotter ?
PAL.
I, the master-plotter ?
Nonsense.
MIL.
How so ?
PAL.
Because, in comparison with your­ self, I am not worthy to fix a beam in a wall.
ACROT.
Aye, indeed so.
PAL.
She's a very fluent and a very clever hand at mischief.
How charmingly she did polish off the Captain.
MIL.
But still, not enough.
PAL.
Be of good courage all the business is now prospering under our hands.
Only do you, as you have begun, still give a helping hand;
for the Captain himself has gone in-doors, to entreat his mis­ tress to leave his house, with her mother and sister, foi Athens.
PLEUS.
Very good-well done.
PAL.
Besides, all the gold trinkets and apparel which he himself has provided foi the damsel, he gives her to keep as a present for herself­ so have I recommended him.
PLEUS.
Really, it's easily done, if both she wishes it, and lie desires it as well.
PAL.
Don't you know that when, from a deep well, you have ascended up to the top, there is the greatest danger lest you should thence fall back again from the top.
This affair is now being carried on at the top of the well.
If the Captain should have a suspicion of it, nothing whatever of his will be able to be carried off.
Now, most especially, we have need of clever contrivances.
PLEUS.
I see that there is material enough at home for that purpose-three women, yourself the fourth, I am the fifth, the old gentleman the sixth.
PAL.
What an edifice of stratagems has been erected by us !
I know for certain, that any town seems as thougl it could be taken by these plans:
only do you lend your assistance.
ACROT.
For that purpose are we come to you, to see if you wish for anything.
PAL.
You do what's a propos.
Now to you do I assign this departmentl.
ACROT.
General, you shall assign me whatever you please, so far as I am capable.
PAL.
I wish this Captain to be played off -cleverly and adroitly.
ACROT.
I' faith, you're assigning me what's a pleasure to me.
PAL.
But do you understand how ?
ACROT.
You mean that I must pretend that I am distracted with love for him.
PAL.
Right—you have it.
ACROT.
And as though by reason of that love I had foregone2 my present marriage, longing for a match with him.
PAL.
Everything exactly in its due order;
except only this one point;
you must say that this house (pointing to the house of PERIPLECOMENUS) was your marriage-portion :
that the old man had departed hence from you after you had carried out the divorce, lest he should be afraid just now to , come here into the house of another man.
ACROT.
You advise me well.
PAL.
But when he comes out from in-doors, I wish you—standing at a distance there -so to make pretence, as though in comparison with his beauty you despised your own, and as though you were struck with awe at his opulent circumstances ;
at the same time, too, praise the comeliness of his person, the beauty of his face.
Are you tutored enough ?
ACROT.
I understand it all.
Is it enough that I give you my work so nicely finished off that you cannot find a fault with it.
PAL.
I'm content.
Now (addressing PLEUSICLES), in your turn, learn what charge I shall give to you.
So soon as this shall be done, when she shall have gone in, then do you immediately take care to come here dressed in the garb of a master of a ship.
Have on a broad-brimmed hat1 of iron- grey, a woollen shade2 before your eyes ;
have on an iron-grey cloaks (for that is the seaman's colour) ;
have it fastened over the left shoulder, your right arm projecting out4, • * * * * * * your clothes some way well girded up, pretend as though you are some master of a ship.
And all these re­ quisites are at the house of this old gentleman, for he keeps fishermen.
PLEUS.
Well, when I'm dressed out, why don't you tell me what I'm to do then ?
PAL.
Come here, and, in the name of her mother, bring word to Philocomasium, that, if she would return to Athens, she must go with you to the harbour directly, and that she must order it to be carried down to the ship if she wishes anything to be put on board;
that if she doesn't go, you must weigh anchor, for the wind is favourable.
PLEUS.
I like your plan much:
do proceed.
PAL..
The Captain will at once advise her to go speedily, that she may not delay her mother.
PLEUS.
Every way you are clever.
PAL.
I shall tell him that she asks for me as a helper to carry her baggage down to the harbour.
I shall go, and, understand you, I shall im­ mediately be off with you straight to Athens.
PLEUS.
And when you have reached there, I'll never let you be ashore three days before you're free.
PAL.
Be off speedily and equip yourself.
PLEUS.
Is there anything besides ?
PAL.
Only to remem­ ber all this.
PLEUS.
I'm off.
(Exit.) PAL.
And do you (to ACROTE- LEUTITIUM and MILPHIDIPPA) be off hence in-doors this in­ stant, for I'm quite sure that he'll just now be coming out hence from in-doors.
ACROT.
With us your command is as good as law.
PAL.
Come, then, begone.
But see, the door opens oppor­ tunely.
(The women go into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)PYRG.
What I wished I have obtained just as I wished, on kind and friendly terms, that she would leave me.
PAL.
For what reason am I to say that you have been so long in-doors ?
PYRG.
I never was so sensible that I was beloved by that woman as now.
PAL.
Why so ?
PYRG.
How many words she did utter !
How the matter, was protracted!
But in the end I obtained what I wanted, and I granted her what she wanted and what she asked of me.
I made a present of you also to her.
PAL.
What—me, too ?
In what way shall I exist with­ out you ?
PYRG.
Come, be of good heart;
I'll make you free from her, too.
But I used all endeavours, if I could by any method persuade her to go away, and not take you with her;
sibe forced me, however.
PAL.
In the Gods and yourself I'll place my trust.
Yet, at the last, although it is bitter to me that I must be deprived of an excellent master, yourself, at least it is a pleasure to me that, through my means, by reason of the excellence of your beauty, this has happened to you with regard to this lady neighbour, whom I am now introducing to you.
PYRG.
What need of words?
I'll give you liberty and wealth if you obtain her for me.
PAL.
I'll win her.
PYRG, But I'm impatient.
PAL.
But moderation is requisite;
curb your desires;
don't be over anxious.
But see, here she is herself;
she is coming out of doors.
MIL. (in a low voice).
Mistress, see!
the Captain's near,ACROT. (in a low voice).
Where is he ?
MIL.
Only loot to the left.
Eye him askance, that he mayn't perceive that we are looking at him.
ACROT.
I see him.
Troth, now's the time, in our mis­ chief, for us to become supremely mischievous.
MIL.
'Tis for you to begin.
ACROT. (aloud).
Prithee, did you see him yourself?
(Aside.)
Don't spare your voice, so that he may hear.
MIL. (aloud).
By my troth, I talked with his own self, at my ease, as long as I pleased, at my leisure, at my own dis­ cretion, just as I wished.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
Do you hear what she says?
PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
I hear.
How delighted she is because she had access to you.
ACROT. (aloud).
0 happy woman that you are !
PYRG.
How I do seem to be loved!
PAL.
You are deserving of it.
MIL. (aloud).
By my troth, 'tis passing strange what you say, that you had access to him and prevailed.
They say that he is usually addressed, like a king, through letters or messengers.
MIL. (aloud).
But, i' faith, 'twas with difficulty I had an opportunity of approaching and beseeching him.
PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
How renowned you are among the fairPYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
I shall submit, since Venus wills it so.ACROT. (aloud).
By heavens !
I return to Venus grateful thanks, and her I do beseech and entreat, that I may win.
him whom I love and whom I seek to win, and that to me he may prove gentle, and not make a difficulty about what I desire.
MIL. (aloud).
I hope it may be so ;
although many ladies are seeking to win him for themselves, he disdains them and estranges himself from all but you alone.
ACROT. (aloud).
Therefore this fear torments me, since he is so disdainful, lest his eyes, when he beholds me, should change his sentiments, and his own gracefulness should at once disdain my form.
MIL. (aloud).
He will not do so;
be of good heart.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
How she does slight herself!
ACROT. (aloud).
I fear lest your account may have sur­ passed my looks.
MIL. (aloud.)
I've taken care of this, that you shall be fairer than his expectations.
ACROT. (aloud).
Troth, if he shall refuse to take me as his wife, by heavens I'll embrace his knees and entreat him!
If I shall be unable to prevail on him, in some way or other, I'll put myself to death.
I'm quite sure that without him I cannot live.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
I see that I must prevent this woman's death.
Shall I accost her ?
PAL.
By no means ;
for you will be making yourself cheap if you lavish yourself away of your own accord.
Let her come spontaneously, seek you, court you, strive to win you.
Un­ less you wish to lose that glory which you have, please have a care what you do.
For I know that this was never the lot of any mortal, except two persons, yourself and Phaon of Lesbosl, to be loved so desperately.
ACROT. (aloud).
I'll go in-doors2—or, my dear Milphi­ dippa, do you call him out of doors.
MIL. (aloud).
Aye;
let's wait until some one comes out.
ACROT. (aloud).
I can't restrain myself from going in to him.
MIL. (aloud).
The door's fastened.
ACROT. (aloud).
I'll break it in then.
MIL. (aloud).
You are not in your senses.
ACROT. (aloud).
If he has ever loved, or if he has wisdom equal to his beauty, whatever I may do through love, he will pardon me by reason of his compassionate feelings.
PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
Prithee, do see, how distracted the poor thing is with love.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
'Tis mutual in us.
PAL.
Hush!
Don't you let her hear.
MIL. (aloud).
Why do you stand stupefied?
Why don't you knock ?
ACROT. (aloud).
Because he is not within whom I want.
MIL. (aloud).
How do you know1?
ACROT. (aloud).
By my troth, I do know it easily;
for my nose would scent him if he were within.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
She is a diviner.
Because she is in love with me, Venus has made her prophesy.
ACROT. (aloud).
He is somewhere or other close at hand whom I do so long.
to behold.
I'm sure I smell him.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
Troth, now, she really sees better with her nose than with her eyes.
PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
She is blind from love.
ACROT. (aloud).
Prithee, do support me.
MIL. (aloud).
Why?
ACROT. (aloud).
Lest I should fall.
MIL. (aloud).
Why?
ACROT. (aloud).
Because I cannot stand ;
my senses—my senses are sinking so by reason of my eyes.
MIL. (aloud).
Heavens!
you've seen the Captain.
ACROT. (aloud).
I have.
MIL. (aloud).
I don't see him.
Where is he ?ACROT. (aloud).
Troth, you would see him if you were in love.
MIL. (aloud).
I' faith, you don't love him more than I do myself, with your good leave.
PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
No doubt all of the women, as soon as each has seen you, are in love with you.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO) .
I don't know whether you have heard it from me or not;
I'm the grandson of Venus.
ACROT. (aloud).
My dear Milphidippa, prithee do ap­ proach and accost him.
PYRG. (to PALÆSTRIO).
How she does stand in awe of me !PAL. (to PYRGOPOLINICES).
She is coming towards us.
MIL. (advancing).
I wish to speak with you.
PYRG.
And we with you.
MIL.
I have brought my mis­ tress out of the house, as you requested me.
PYRG.
So I see.
MIL.
Request her, then, to approach.
PYRG.
Since you have entreated it, I have prevailed upon my mind not to detest her just like other women.
MIL.
I' faith she wouldn't be able to utter a word if she were to come near you ;
while she was looking at you, her eyes have in the meantime tied her tongue.
PYRG.
I see that this woman's disorder must be cured.
MIL.
See how terrified she is since she beheld you.
PYRG.
Even armed men are the same ;
don't wonder at a woman being so.
But what does she wish me to do ?
MIL.
You to come to her house;
she wishes to live and to pass her life with you.
PYRG.
What!
—I come home to her, when she is a mar­ ried woman ?
Her husband is to be stood in fear of.
MIL.
Why,-for your sake, she has turned her husband out of her house.
PYRG.
HOW ?
How could she do so ?
MIL.
The house was her marriage-portion.
PYRG.
Was it so ?
MIL.
It was so, on my word.
PYRG.
Bid her go home;
I'll be there just now.
MIL.
Take care, and don't keep her in expectation ;
don't torment her feelings.
PYRG.
Not I, indeed.
Do you go then.
MIL.
We are going.
(ACROTELEUTIUM and MILPHIDIPPA go into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.)
PYRG.
But what do J see ?
PAL.
What do you see ?
PYRG.
See there, some one is coming, I know not who, but in a sailor'a dress.
PAL.
He is surely wanting us, now;
really, it is the ship- master.
PYRG.
He's come, I suppose, to fetch her.
PAL.
I fancy so.
PLEUS. (to himself).
Did I not know that another man in other ways has done many a thing unbecomingly on account of love, I should be more ashamed by reason of love for me to be going in this garb.
But since I have learned that many per­ sons by reason of love have committed many actions, dis­ graceful and estranged from what is good, * * * * * for I pass by how Achilles sufferedl his comrades to be slain —
But there's Palæstrio, he's standing with the Captain.
My talk must now be changed for another kind.
Woman is surely born of tardiness itself.
For every other delay, which is a delay just as much, seems a less delay than that which is on account of a woman.
I really think that this is done merely from habit.
But I shall call for this Philoco­ masium.
I'll knock at the door then.
Hallo!
is there any one here ?
(Knocks at the CAPTAIN'S door.)PAL.
Young man—what is it ?
What do you want ?
Why are you knocking ?
PLEUS.
I'm come to inquire for Philocomasium ;
I'm come from her mother.
If she's for going, let her set off.
She is delaying us all;
we wish to weigh anchor.
PYRG.
Her things have been some time in readiness.
Hearkye, Palæstrio, take some assistants with you to carry to the ship her golden trinkets, her furniture, apparel, all her precious things.
All the articles are already packed up which I gave her.
PAL.
I'll go.
(Goes into the house.)
PLEUS.
Troth now, prithee, do make haste.
PYRG.
There shall be no delay.
Pray, what is it that has been done2 with your eye ?
PLEUS.
Troth, but I have my eye.
(Points to the right one.)PYRG.
But the left one I mean.
'PLEUS.
I'll tell you.
On account of the sea, I use this eye less;
but if I kept away from the seal, I should use the one like the other.
But they are detaining me too long.
PYRG.
See, here they are coming out.
PAL. (to PHILOCOMASIUM).
Prithee, when will you this day make an end of your weeping ?
PHIL.
What can I do but weep ?
I am going away hence where I have spent my days most happily.
PAL.
See, there's the man that has come from your mother and sister (pointing to PLEUSICLES).
PHIL.
I see him.
PYRG.
Palæstrio, do you hear ?
PAL.
What is your pleasure ?
PYRG.
Aren't you order.
ing those presents to be brought out which I gave her ?
PLEUS.
Health to you, Philocomasium.
PHIL.
And health to you.
PLEUS.
Your mother and sister bade me give their love to you.
PHIL.
Heaven prosper them.
PLEUS.
They beg you to set out, so that, while the wind is fair, they may set sail.
But if your mother's eyes had been well, she would have come2 together with me.
PHIL.
I'll go;
although I do it with regret-duty compels me.
PLEUS.
You act wisely.
PYRG.
If she had not been passing her life with myself, this day she would have been a blockhead.
PHIL.
I am distracted at this, that I am estranged from such a man.
For you are able to make any woman what­ ever abound in wit;
and because I was living with you, for that reason I was of a very lofty spirit.
I see that I must lose that loftiness of mind.
(Pretends to cry.)PYRG.
Don't weep.
PHIL.
I can't help it when I look upon you.
PYRG.
Be of good courage.
PHIL.
I know what pain it is to me.
PAL.
I really don't wonder now, Philocomasium, if you were here with happiness to yourself, when I, a servant­ as I look at him, weep because we are parting (pretends to cry), so much have his beauty, his manners, his valour, captivated your feelings.
PYRG.
By all means.
PHIL. (embracing him).
0 my eyes !
0 my life!
PAL.
Do hold up the woman, I entreat you, lest she should fall.
(He takes hold of her, and she pretends to faint.)PYRG.
What means this ?
PAL.
Because, after she bad quitted you, she suddenly became faint, poor thing.
PYRG.
Run in and fetch some water.
PAL.
I want no water;
but I had rather you would keep at a distance.
Prithee, don't you interfere till she comes to.
PYRG. (observing PLEUSICLES, who is holding PHILOCOMA­ alUM in his arm).
They have their heads too closely in con­ tact between them ;
I don't like it;
he is soldering his lips1 to hers.
What the plague are you about ?
PLEUS.
I was trying whether she was breathing or not.
PITRG.
You ought to have applied your ear then.
PLEUS.
If you had rather, I'll let her go.
PYRG.
No, I don't care;
do you support her.
PAL.
To my misery, I'm quite distracted.
PYRG.
Go and bring here from in-doors all the things that I have given her.
PAL.
And even now, household God, do I salute thee before I depart;
my fellow-servants, both male and female, all farewell, and happy may you live;
prithee, though absent, among yourselves bestow your blessings upon me as well.
PAL.
Alas!
alas!
I cannot but weep since from you I must depart.
PYRG.
Bear it with patience.
PHIL. (feigning to recover).
Ha!
how's this P
What means it ?
Hail, 0 light!
PLEUS, Are you recovered now?
PHIL.
Prithee, what person am I embracing ?
I'm undone.
Am I myself?
PLEUS. (in a low voice).
Fear not, my delight.
PYRG.
What means all this ?
PAL.
Just now she swooned away here.
I fear and dread that this at last may take place 1 too openly.
PYRG.
What is that you say ?
PAL.
I fear that some one may turn it to your discredit, while all these things are being carried after us through the city.
PYRG.
I have given away my own property, and not theirs.
I care but little for other people.
Be off then, go with the blessing of the Gods.
PAL.
'Tis for your sake I say it.
PYRG.
I believe you.
PAL.
And now farewell!
PYRG.
And heartily farewell to you!
PAL. (to PLEUSICLES and PHILOCOMASIUM as they leave).
Go you quickly on;
I'll overtake you directly;
I wish to speak a few words with my master.
(To PYRGOPOLINICES.)
Although you have ever deemed others more faithful to yourself than me, still do I owe you many thanks for all things;
and if such were your feelings, I would rather be a slave to you by far than be the freedman of another.
PYRG.
Be of good courage.
PAL.
Ah me!
When it comes in my mind, how my manners must be changed, how womanish manners must be learnt, and the military ones forgotten !
PYRG.
Take care and be honest.
PAL.
I can be -so no longer;
I have lost all inclination2.
PYRG.
Go, follow them ;
don't linger.
PAL.
Fare you right well.
PYRG.
And heartily fare you well.
PAL.
Prithee, do remember me;
if perchance I should happen to be made free, I'll send the news to you;
don't you forsake mel.
PYRG.
That is not my habit.
PAL.
Consider every now and then how faithful I have been to you.
If you do that, then at last you'll know who is honest towards you and who dishonest.
PYRG.
I know it;
I have often found that true, as well before as to-day in especial.
PAL.
Do you know it ?
Aye, and this day I'll make you hereafter say still more how true it is.
PYRa.
I can hardly refrain from bidding you to stay.
PAL.
Take you care how2 you do that.
They may say that you are a liar and not truthful, that you have no honor;
they may say that no one of your slaves is trustworthy except my­ self.
If, indeed, I thought you could do it with honor, I should advise you.
But it cannot be;
take care how you do so.
PYRG.
Be off;
I'll be content then, whatever happens.
PAL.
Then, fare you well.
PYRG.
'Twere better you should go with a good heart.
PAL.
Still, once more, farewell.
(Exit.) PYRG.
Before this affair, I had always thought that he was a most rascally ser­ vant;
still, I find that he is faithful to me.
When I con­ sider with myself, I have done unwisely in parting with him.
I'll go hence at once now to my love here:
the door, too, I perceive, makes a noise there.
Boy. (to some one within).
Don't you be advising me;
I remember my duty;
this moment I'll find him.
Wherever on earth he may chance to be, I'll search him out;
I'll not be sparing of my pains.
PYRG.
'Tis I he is looking for;
I'll go and meet this boy.
BOY.
0, I'm looking for you;
save you, dearest sir, one loaded by opportunity with her gifts, and whom before all others two Divinities do favour.
PYRa.
What two ?
BOY.
Mars and Venus.
PYRG.
A sprightly boy.
Boy.
She entreats that you will go in;
she wishes—she longs for you, and while expecting you, she's dying for you.
Do succour one in love.
Why do you stay ?
Why don't you go in ?
PYRG.
Well, I'll go.
(Enters the house of PERIPLECO­ MENUS.)
Boy.
There has he entangled himself at once in the toils.
The snare is prepared :
the old gentleman is standing at his post1 to attack the letcher, who is so boastful of his good looks ;
who thinks that, whatever woman sees him, all are in love with him;
whom all, both men and women, detest.
Now I will on to the uproar;
I hear a tumult within.
PERIP.
Bring that fellow along.
If he doesn't follow, drag him, lifted on high3, out of doors.
Make him to be between heaven and earth;
cut him in pieces.
(They beat him.)PYRG.
By my troth, I do entreat you, Periplocomenus.
PERIP.
By my troth, you do entreat in vain.
Take care, Cario, that that knife of yours is very sharp.
CARIO.
Why, it's already longing to rip up the stomach of this letcher.
I'll make his entrails hang just as a bauble hangs from a baby's neck.
PYRG.
I'm a dead man.
PERIP.
Not yet;
you say so too soon.
CARIO.
Shall I have at this fellow now ?
PERIP.
Aye,—but first let him be thrashed with cudgels.
CARIO.
True, right lustily.
PERIP.
Why have you dared, you disgraceful fellow, to seduce another man's wife ?
PYRG.
So may the Gods bless me, she came to me of her own accord.
PERIP.
It's a lie.
Lay on.
(They are about to strike.)PYRG.
Stay, while I tell —PERIP.
Why are you hesi­ tating ?
PYRG.
Will you not let me speak ?
PERIP.
Speak, then.
PYRG.
I was entreated to come here.
PERIP.
How did you dare ?
There's for you, take that.
(Strikes him.)PYRG. 0 ! 0 ! I've had enough.
Prithee, now.
CARIO.
Am I to begin cutting him up at once ?
PERIP.
As soon as you like.
Stretch the fellow out, and spread out his pinions1 in opposite ways.
PYRG.
By heavens, prithee, do hear my words before he cuts me.
PERIP.
Speak before you're made of no sex.
PYRG.
I supposed that she was a widow;
and so her maid, who was her go-between, informed me.
PERIP.
Now take an oath that you won't injure any person for this affair, because you have been beaten here to- day, or shall be beaten hereafter, if we let you go safe hence, you dear little grandson of Venus3.
PYRG.
I swear by Dione3 and Mars that I will hurt no one because I have been beaten here this day;
and I think that it was rightfully done;
and if I don't go hence further injured, I am rightly punished for the offence.
PERIP.
But what if you don't do so ?
PYRG.
Then, may I always have my word not to be trustedl.
CARIO.
Let him be beaten once more;
after that I think he may be dismissed.
PYRG.
May the Gods ever bless you, since you so kindly come as my advocate.
CARIO.
Give us a golden mina2, then.
PYRG.
For what reason ?
CARIO.
That we may now let you go hence unmaimed, you little grandson of Venus;
otherwise you shall not escape from here;
don't you deceive yourself.
PYRG.
It shall be given you.
CARIO.
You're very wise.
As for your tunic, and your scarfs, and sword, don't at all hope for them;
you shan't have them.
A SERVANT.
Shall I beat him again, or do you let him go ?
PYRG.
I'm tamed by your cudgels.
I do entreat you.
PERIP.
Loose him.
PYRG.
I return you thanks.
PERIP:
If I ever catch you here again, I'll insert a dis­ qualifying clause.
PYRG.
Well:
I make no objection.
PERTP.
Let's go in, Cario.
(PERIPLECOMENUS, CARIO, and SERVANTS, go into his house.)PYRa.
Here are some of my servants, I see.
Tell me, is Philocomasium off yet.
SCEL.
Aye, some time since.
PYRG.
Ah meSCEL.
You would say that4 still more if you were to know what I know, for that fellow who had the wool before his eye was no sailor.
PYRG.
Who was he, then?
SCEL.
A lover of Philo­ comasium's.
PYRG.
How do you know ?
SCEL.
I do know:
for after they had got out of the city gate, they didn't wait a moment before falling to kissing and embracing each other at once.
PYRG.
0 wretched fool that I am!
I see that I have been gulled.
That scoundrel of a fellow, Palæstrio, it was he that contrived this plot against me.
SCEL.
I think it was properly done.
If it were so done to other letchers, there would be fewer letchers here;
they would stand more in awe, and give their attention less to these pursuits.
PYRG.
Let's go into my house.

—Athens:
before the houses of the FIRST BACCHIS and of PHILOKIM a which are in the same streetMNESILOCHUS, when absent at Ephesus, writes and requests his friend, Pisto­ clerus, to search for his mistress, Bacchis, who has left Athens with a military Captain.
Having discovered her on her return to Athens, Pistoclerus falls in love with her twin-sister, whose name is also Bacchis, and is severely reproved by his tutor, Lydus, for so doing.
Mnesilochus returns to Athens, and discovers from Lydus that his friend Pistoclerus is in love with a female of the name of Bacchis.
He thereupon imagines that he has supplanted him with his own mistress, and in his anger resolves to restore to his father some money of his which he had gone to Ephesus to recover, and a part of which he had contrived, through a scheme of the servant Chrysalus, to retain, in order that he might redeem his mistress from the Captain.
Having afterwards discovered the truth, he greatly repents that he has done so, as the officer threatens to carry Bacchus off instantly, if the money is not paid.
On this, Chrysalus contrives another stratagem against Nicobulus, his aged master, and makes him, through fear cf the Captain's threats, pay the required sum.
Having gained not only this but a still further sum of money, the young men regale themselves at the house of Bacchis.
Nicobulus afterwards discovers from the Captain the trick that has been played upon him, and he and Mnesilochus repair to the house of Bacchis to demand their sons.
The damsels, hereupon, apply themselves to coaxing the old men, who are at last persuaded to forgive their sons and Chrysalus and tc go into the house and join the entertainment.
[Supposed to have been written by Priscian the Grammarian.]
MNESILOCHUS is inflamed with love for Bacchis (Bacchidis).
But, first of all, lie goes to Ephesus, to bring back some gold (Aurum).
Bacchis sails for Crete (Cretam), and meets with (Convenit) the other Bacchis;
thence she re­ turns to Athens;
upon this (Hinc), Mnesilochus sends a letter to Pistoclerus, that he may seek for her (Illam).
He returns;
he makes a quarrel while (Dum) he supposes that his own mistress is beloved by Pistoclerus;
when they have discovered the mistake as to the twin-sisters, Mnesilochus pays the gold to that (Ei) Captain;
equally are the two in love.
The old men (Senes), while they are looking after their sons, join the women, and carouse.
'
Tis a wonder if the spectators on the benches this day don't hiss, and cough, and make a snorting noise at this ridiculous sight, furrow their brows, and, with cries with one consent2, shout all aloud, and mutter impreca­ tions.
Hardly in their youth can beardless actors, or mimics with their beards plucked out, find room upon the stage.
Why comes forth this aged and lethargic go-between, who is borne upon the ass's back ?
Listen, I pray, and give me your attention, while I tell you the name of this quiet Comedy3.
'Tis proper for you to make silence for a Divinity.
It befits not those to use the resources of the voice, who come here not to exclaim, but to be spectators.
Give me attentive ears;
but not into my hands I mean;
I wish my voicel, as it flies, to strike these vacant ears.
What do you fear ?
Are those blows more hurtful which open what is shut2, or which close what is open ?
You're very kind;
the inhabitants of heaven do love you deservedly.
There is profound silence —even the children are still—and now, attend to a new-come messenger, on a new errand.
Who I am—why I am come to you—I'll tell you in a few words ;
at the same time, I'll ' disclose to you the name of this Comedy.
Now, behold, I shall tell you what you wish to know;
do you then give me your attention.
I am a God of NatureS, the foster-father of, most mighty Bromius4, him who, with a female army5, gained a kingdom.
Whatever about him renowned nations relate, some part, at least, has been accomplished by my advice.
That which pleases me is never displeasing to him.
’Tis right if one father6 another father does obey.
Ass-borne do the Ionian multitudes7 style me, because I am borne on an ass1 for my conveyance.
Who I am, you understand:
if you understand, allow me now to tell the name of this quiet play;
at the same time, you may learn why I have come to you.
Philemon2 formerly produced a play in Greek;
this, those who speak the Greek language call “Evantides3;
” Plautus, who speaks the Latin, calls it " Bacchides."
'Tis not to be wondered, then, if hither I have come.
Bacchus sends to you the Bacchides—the Bacchanalian Bacchanals.
I am bringing them unto you.
What!
Have I told a lie ?
It don't become a God to tell a lie;
but the truth I tell—I bring not them;
but the salacious ass, wearied with its journey, is bringing to you three, if I remember right.
One you behold;
see now, what on my lips I bring-to wit, two Samian sisters4, Bacchanalians, merry Courtesans, born of the same parents, at one time, at a twin-birth;
not less alike than milk to milk, if you compare it, or water to water;
were you to see them you would think them halved5;
so much would you confuse your sight, that you would not be able to distinguish which was which.
What remains you long to hear.
Now give at­ tention :
the story of this Play I will disclose.
What country Samos is, is known to all;
for seas, lands, mountains, and islands, have your legions6 made easy of access.
There, Sostrata bore to her husband, Pyrgoteles Pyrocles7, twin-daughters at one birth;
and it pleased them, being initiated at the tri- ennial festivall of Bacchus, to call after his name the damsels of which they were the parents.
The parents, as often hap­ pens, gave a turn to- their future fortunes.
A Captain car­ ried one of them with him to Crete.
The other of the twins sailed for Athens3.
As soon as Mnesilochus, the so a of Ni­ cobulus, beheld her, he began to love her, and frequently paid her visits.
Meantime, his father sent the youth to Ephesus, to bring back thence some gold, which he himself, some time before, had deposited with Archidemides, an an­ cient friend of his, an aged Phœnician.
When, for two years he had stayed at Ephesus, he received the sad news that Bacchis was gone from Athens, for some sailors of his ac­ quaintance sent him word that she had set sail.
On this, he writes a letter to Pistoclerus, his only friend, the son of Phi­ loxenus, entreating him to seek the fugitive with care and ear­ nestness.
While Pistoclerus is devoting his services to his friend, the twin-sisters, who have just returned to Athens, arouse a passion in the seeker.
The one wins Pistoclerus for herself;
the other longs for the coming of Mnesilochus.
What wonder if two bewitching, merry, pretty Bacchantes, should attract to themselves two unfledged Bacchanalians, and if they should ensnare their decrepit, most aged fathers, fit subjects for the undertaker-, bowed down by the weight of their years ?
But, see, here's Pistoclerus, who is returning to the Bacchides so lately found, and in his simplicity1 is blowing in himself the sparks of passion so lately kindled.
Now I'm off—do you attend.

With pleasure;
you may proceed.
1st BACCH.
When my memory shall fail me, then do you take care to aid me, sister.2nd BACCH.
I' faith, I'm more afraid that I shan't have the choice of prompting you.
1st BACCH.
Troth, I'm afraid the little nightingale may lose her powers1 of song.
Follow this way.
(They move.)PISTOC.
What are these two Courtesans, the namesake­ sisters, about ?1st BACCH.
Nothing is there more wretched than a woman.
PISTOC.
What, say you, is there more worthy of it ?
What have you been planning in your consultation ?1st BACCH.
What's proper ?
PISTOC.
I' faith, that doesn't belong to the Courtesan.1st BACCH.
This sister of mine entreats me so to find some person to protect her against this Captain;
that when she has served her time2 he may bring her back home.
Do you, I entreat you, be her protector.
PISTOC.
Why should I protect her?
1st BACCH.
That she may be brought home again, when she has fulfilled her engagement to him, so that he may not take her as a servant3 for himself.
But, if she had the gold to pay him back again, gladly would she do so.
PISTOC.
Where now is this person ?
1st BACCH.
I expect that he'll be here just now.
But this you'll be able to ar­ range better among ourselves;
and sitting there, you shall wait until he comes.
So you will drink some wine, and so, I'll give you a kiss when you have drunk it.
PISTOC.
Your coaxing is mere birdlime.
1st BACCH.
How so ?
PISTOC.
Because, in fact, I understand how you two are aiming at one poor pigeon, myself;
(aside) very nearly is the limed reed1 breaking my feathers.
Madam, I judge that such deeds befit me not.
1st BACCH.
Why so, I pray ?
PISTOC.
Bacchis, it is, because I dread you Bacchantes, and your Bacchanalian den2.1st BACCH.
What is it that you dread ?
Surely, not that the couch in my house may lead you into mischief?
PISTOC.
Your allurements3, more than your couch, do I dread.
You're a mischievous serpent4.
But, madam, a lurking-place does not befit this youthful age.
1st BACCH.
Should you wish at my house to do anything that's unwise, I myself should hinder it.
But, when the Captain comes, I wish you.
to be at my house for this reason;
because, when you are present, no one will do her and me any injury.
You will prevent that, and by the same means you will be aiding your friend;
this Captain, too, on arriving, will suspect that I am your mistress.
Why are you silent, pray ?
PISTOC.
Because these things are pleasant in the talking of;
but in the practice, and when you make trial, the same are armed with stings.
They pierce the feelings, goad one's fortune, and wound one's merits and character.2nd BACCH.
What do you dread from her ?
PISTOC.
What do I dread, do you ask ?
Am I a person in my youth to enter a place of exercise1 of such a nature, where people sweat to their undoing ?-where for the quoit I re­ reive a loss, disgrace, too, for my running ?2nd BACCH.
How charmingly you do talk.
PISTOC.
Where I'm to take a turtle-dove2 instead of a sword, and where another puts into my hand the gobletS instead of the cestus;
the drinking-cup4 is in place of the helmet, the wreathed gar­ land instead of the crest5, the dice in place of the lance.
For the coat of mail I should have to assume a soft cloak 6 ;
where, too, in place of a horse a couch must be given me,—for shield, a strumpet7 may be lying by me.
Avaunt from me—avaunt!2nd BACCH.
0, you're too fierce.
PISTOC.
I am attend­ ing to my own Interests.2nd BACCH.
You must be softened down;
and, in fact, I offer you my aid in this.
PISTOC.
But you are too expensive an assistant.
1st BACCH.
Do pretend that you are in love with me.
PISTOC.
Whether should I be pretending that in jest, or seriously ?1st BACCH.
Well said!
better to do the last.
When the Captain comes here, I want you8 to embrace me.
PISTOC.
What need is there of ray doing that ?1st BACCH.
I want him to see you.
I know what I'in about?
PISTOC.
And I, i' faith, I know not what I'm in fear of.
But what say you?
1st BACCH.
What's the matter now?
PISTOC.
Well, suppose perchance on a sudden a breakfast or a drinking bout, or else a dinner, should take place at your house, just as is the wont in such places of resort;
where, then, should I take my place ?1st BACCH.
Near myself, my life, that with a she wit a he wit may be reclining at the repast.
A place here, at our house, should you come late, is always at your service.
When you wish right merrily to disport yourself, my rosebud, you say to me, "Do let me enjoy myself to-day," I'll provide you a delightful place where it may be so.
PISTOC.
Here is a rapid stream;
not without hazard can this way be passed.
1st BACCH. (aside).
And, by my troth, something must you ose amid this stream.
(Aloud.)
Give me your hand and ollow me.
PISTOC.
0, by no means.
1st BACCH.
Why so ?
PISTOC.
Because to a man in his youth nothing can be Hare alluring than these-night, women, wine.
1st BACCH.
Away, then, with you;
for my part, I don't at all care for it, but for your own sake.
The Captain, then, shall take her off;
don't you be present at all if you don't choose.
PISTOC. (to himself).
And am I a thing of nothing, who annot moderate my own passions ?1st BACCH.
What's there for you to fear?
PISTOC.
There's nothing;
all nonsense.
Madam, I resign nyself to you.
I'm yours ;
to you do I devote my services.
1st BACCH.
You are a dear man.
Now I wish you to do his.
To-day I want to give a welcome entertainment1 to my ister.
For that purpose I shall at once order the money2 to je brought you from in-doors.
Do you take care and cater for us a splendid entertainment.
PISTOC.
No, I'll stand treat;
for it would be a shame, that on my account you both should take trouble for me, and by reason of that trouble should pay the expense from your own means.
1st BACCII.
But I can't allow you to give anything.
PISTOC.
Do let me.
1st BACCH.
Well, I'll let you, if you choose.
Prithee, do make haste.
PISTOC.
I shall be here again, before I cease to love you.
(Exit PISTOCLERUS.2nd BACCH.
You entertain me pleasantly upon my return, my sister.
1st BACCH.
How so, prithee ?2nd BACCH.
Because, in my way of thinking, this day a lucky haul has fallen to your lot.
1st BACCH.
He's mine, assuredly.
Now, sister, with respect to Mnesilochus, I'll give you my aid1, that here at home you may be receiving gold, rather than be going hence together with the Captain.2nd BACCH.
That's my desire.
1st BACCH.
My aid shall be given you.
The water's warm ;
let's go in, that you may bathe.
For, as you have travelled on board ship, you are faint, I think.2nd BACCH.
A little so, sister.
(PISTOCLERUS is seen at a distance.)
Besides, he's beginning to cause I don't know what bustle.
Let's begone hence.
1st BACCII.
Follow me this way in-doors to bathe, that you may relieve your weariness.
LYD.
For some time, Pistoclerus, I've been following you in silencer watching what you were doing in this dress1.
For, so may the Gods favour me, even Lycurgus him­ self2 seems to me as if be could be led into debauchery here.
Whither now are you betaking yourself hence in an opposite direction with such a train?
PISTOC.
To this place (pointing to the house).
LYD.
Why to this place ?
Who lives there ?
PISTOC.
Love, Pleasure, Venus, Beauty, Joy, Jesting, Dalliance, Converse, and Sweet-kissing.
LYD.
What intercourse have vou with these most destruc­ tive Deities ?
PISTOC.
Bad are those men who speak evil of the good.
You speak not well of even the Gods themselves;
you do what is not right.
LYD.
Is Sweet-kissing, then, some God ?
PISTOC.
And do you not think she is ?
0 Lydus, why, what a barbarians you are, you, whom I had deemed to be far more wise than Thales himself4.
Go to, you are more foolish than Potitius, the foreigner5, who, at an age so advanced, knew not the names of the Divinities.
LYD.
This dress of yours pleases me not.
PISTOC.
But no one prepared it for you;
it was prepared for myself, whom it pleases well.
LYD.
And do you commence upon your repartees against myself even ?
You, who, if you had even ten tongues, ought to be silent.
PISTOC.
Not every age, Lydus, is suited for school1.
One thing especially is just now on my mind, how the cook may with due care attend to these things as befits the elegance of the entertainment.
LYD.
Now have you undone yourself and me and all my labours, me who so oft have shown you what is right, all to no purpose.
PISTOC.
In the same place have I lost my labour where you've lost yours:
your instructions profit neither me nor yourself.
LYD. 0 obdurate heart!
PISTOC.
You are troublesome to me.
Hold your tongue, Lydus, and follow me.
LYD.
Now, see that, please ;
he no longer calls2 me " tutor," but mere " Lydus."PISTOC.
It seems not proper, nor can it be fit, that, when a person is in a house, and is reclining at the feast together with his mistress, and is kissing her, and the other guests are reclining too, the tutor should be there too in their presenceLYD.
Are these provisions purchased for such a purpose, pray?
PISTOC.
My intentions, indeed, expect so ;
how it falls put, is in the hands of the Gods.
LiD.
Will you be having a mistress ?
PISTOC.
When you see, then you'll know.
LYD.
Aye, but you shall not have one, and I won't allow it.
Go back again home.
PISTOC.
Do leave me alone, Lydus, and beware of mischief3LYD.
What ?
Beware of mischief ?
0 yawning gulf, where art thou now?
How gladly would I avail myself of thee!
Already have I lived far longer than I could have wished.
'Twere much better now to have once existed than to be living still.
That any pupil should thus threaten his tutor!
PISTOC.
My years are now advanced beyond your tutor­ ship.
LYD.
I want no pupils for me with heated bloody
An up­ grown one may harass me thus devoid of strength.
PISTOC.
As I guess, I shall become a Hercules, and you a Linus2.
LYD.
I' faith, I fear more that through your goings-on I shall become a Phœnix3, and have to tell the news to your father that you are dead.
PISTOC.
Enough of these stories.
LYD.
This youth is lost to shame4;
the man's ruined.
And does it then recur to you that you have a father ?
PISTOC.
Am I your servant, or you mine ?
LYD.
By my troth, you made an exchange not desirable for that age of yours, when you gained these impudent wavs.
Some bad master has been teaching you all this, Dot I.
You are a scholar far more apt at these pursuits than at those lessons which I taught you when I was losing my labour.
Troth, 'twas a bad piece of deceit you were guilty of at your age, when you concealed these vicious tendencies from myself and from your father.
PISTOC.
Lydus, you have thus far had liberty of speech that is enough.
So now do you follow this way, and hold your tongue5.
(They go into the house of BACCHIS.)CHRYS.
All hail, land of my master!
which I joyfully be.
hold after the two years that I have been absent hence at Ephesus.
I salute thee, neighbour Apollo1, who dost have thy shrine close by our house, and to thee do I make my prayer, that thou wilt not let me meet our old gentleman, Nicobulus, before I have seen Pistoclerus, the friend of Mnesilochus, him to whom Mnesilochus has sent the letter about his mistress, Bacchis.
PISTOC. (to the FIRST BACCHIS within).
'Tis strange that you are so earnestly begging me to return, who am able by no possible means to depart hence, if I were willing, so bound down2, and so enchained with love do you hold me.
PISTOC.
Hail, Chrysalus, to you !
CHRYS.
I will at present compress many speeches for you in a small space.
You are glad that I am come;
I give you credit for it.
You promise me lodging and an entertainment coming from my journey, as it is befitting, and I agree to come.
I bring you the sincere greetings of your friend.
Would you ask me where he is ?
He's come.
PISTOC.
Is he alive and well ?
CHRYS.
That I was wish­ ful to enquire of yourself.
PISTOC.
HOW can I know ?
CHRYS.
No one better.
PISTOC.
Why, in what way ?
CHRYS.
Because if she has been found whom he so loves, he is alive and well.
If she is not found, he is not well, and is like to die.
His mistress is the very life of a lover.
If she is away, he is non-existent;
if she is with him, his property is non-existent, and himself worthless and wretched.
But what have you done in respect of his commission ?
PISTOC.
And ought I not to have his request complied with against his arrival, which his messenger brought to me from him ?
I'd sooner be dwelling in the realms of Acheron than not.
CHRYS.
How now, have you found out this Bacchis ?
PISTOC.
Yes, and a Samian one too.
CHRYS.
Prithee, do take care that no one handles her carelessly:
you know how soon a Samian vessel1 is wont to break.
PISTOC.
What now, your old habit ?
CHRYS.
Prithee, do tell me where she now is.
PISTOC.
Here, where you just now saw me coming out.
CHRYS.
How capital that is!
She's living almost next door.
Does she at all remember Mnesilochus ?
PISTOC.
Do you ask me that ?
Aye, him alone does she esteem at the very highest value.
CHRYS.
Indeed!
PISTOC.
Yes, and were you to believe her, distractedly in love—she quite longs for him.
CHRYS.
That's good.
PISTOC.
Yes, Chrysalus;
see, now;
not even so small a space of time ever passes by as this2, out that she is uttering his name.
CHRYS.
I' faith, so much the better.
(Moving, as if about to go.)PISTOC.
Yes;
but(Holds him.)
CHRYS.
Yes, faith3, I'd rather be off.
PISTOC.
And do you so unwillingly hear how your mas­ ter's interests have prospered ?
CHRYS.
No, not the subject4, but the actor offends my feelings with his tediousness.
Even " Epidicus," a play that I love quite as much as my own self, were Pollio to act it1, no play would I see so reluctantly.
But, does Bacchis seem handsome, as well, to you ?
PISTOC.
Do you ask the question?
Had I not got a Venus, I should pronounce her a Juno.
CHRYS.
I' faith, Mnesilochus, as I find these matters pro­ ceeding, there's something ready for you to love ;
'tis needful that you find something to give her.
But, perhaps you have need of gold for that other one ?
PISTOC.
Yes, some Philippeans.
CHRYS.
And you have need of it directly, perhaps ?
PISTOC.
Aye, and even sooner than directly.
For there's a Captain coming here just nowCHRYS.
A Captain, indeed!
PISTOC.
Who is demanding some gold here for relinquishing Bacchis.
CHRYS.
Let him come when he pleases, and so there be no delay.
The money's at home;
I fear not for myself, nor do I go begging to any man;
so long, at least, as this heart of mine shall be armed with its inventiveness.
Go in;
I'll manage here.
Do you tell them in-doors, that Mnesilochus is coming to Bacchis.
PISTOC.
I'll do as you request.
(Goes into the house of BACCIIIS.)CHRYS.
The money business belongs to me.
From Ephesus we have brought twelve hundred golden Philippeans, which our entertainer owed to our old gentleman.
Hence, some contrivance2 will I this day contrive, to procure gold for this son of my master thus in love.
But there's a noise at our door—who's coming out of doors, I wonder ?
Stands aside.
Nico. (to himself).
To the Piræus will I go;
I'll go see whether any merchant-ship has come into harbour from Ephesus.
For my mind misgives me;
my son lingers there so long, and does not return.
CHRYS. (aside).
Now, I'll finely unravel him, if the Gods are propitious.
There must be no sleeping;
gold is requi­ site1 for Chrysalus.
I'll accost him, whom for sure this day I'll make a ram of Phryxus2 of;
so, even to the quickS, will I shear him of his gold.
(Accosting him.)
His servant Chry­ salus salutes Nicobulus.
Nice. 0, immortal Gods !
where is my son ?
CHRYS.
Why don't you return the salutation first, which I gave you ?
Nico.
Well, save you.
But where on earth is Mnesilochus ?
CHRYS.
He is alive and well.
NICO.
Is he not come ?
CHRYS.
He is come.
Nico.
Hurra!
you've brought me to4 my senses.
And has he all along been well ?
CHRYS.
Aye, well as a boxers and an athlete.
Nico.
But what as to this-the business on account of which I sent him hence to Ephesus ?
Has he not received the gold from his entertainer, Archidemides ?
CHRYS.
Alas!
my heart and my brain are cleft, Nicobulus, whenever mention is made of that fellow.
Why don't you call that entertainer of his your enemy ?
Nice.
Troth now, prithee, why so ?
CHRYS.
Because, i' faith, I know for sure, that Vulcan, the Moon, the Sun, the Day, those four Divinities, never shone upon another more wicked.
Nico.
What, than Archidemides ?
Dear me!
CHRYS.
Than Archidemides, I say.
Nice.
What has he done?
CHRYS.
What has he not done ?
Why don't you ask me that ?
In the first place, then, he began to make denials to your son, and to assert that he didn't owe three obols1 to you.
Forthwith, Mnesilochus summoned to himself there ourancient host, the old gentleman, Pelago;
in his presence, he at once showed the fellow the token2, which you yourself had given to your son to deliver to him.
Nico.
Well—when he showed him the token ?
CHRYS.
He began to say that it was counterfeit, and that it was not a true token;
and how many reproaches he did utter against him so undeserving of them!
and he said that in other matters he had committed forgery.
NICO.
Have you not the gold ?
In the first place, I want that to be told me.
CHRYS.
Yes, after the Prætor had appointed delegates3;
being cast, at length compelled by force he paid down twelve hundred Philippeans.
Nico.
He owed that much.
CHRYS.
Besides, listen to another struggle of his, as well, which he was desirous to enter on.
Nice.
What, besides, as well ?
Oho!
this will turn out now a regular hawk's nest1.
I've been deceived:
I've entrusted my gold to an Autolycus2 for my host!
CHRYS.
Nay, but do you listenNice.
Well, I wasn't aware of the disposition of my avaricious entertainer.
CHRYS.
Afterwards, at last we had got the gold, and em­ barked on board ship, desirous for home.
By chance, as I was sitting on the deck, while I was looking about me, at that moment I beheld a long bark being fitted out by this cheating knave.
Nice.
Troth, I'm undone;
that bark breaks my hearthCHRYS.
This was held in partnership by your host and some pirates.
Nico.
And that I should be such a blockhead as to trust him, when his very name of Archidemides4 cried aloud to me that he would deprive me of it, if I should entrust anything to him.
CHRYS.
This bark was lying in wait for our ship.
I began to watch them, to see what business they were about.
Meanwhile, from harbour our ship set sail.
When we had fully left the harbour, these fellows began to follow with their oars;
nor birds, nor winds more swiftly.
As I dis­ covered what scheme was being carried out, at once we dropped anchor.
As they beheld us stopping, they began to keep their vessel back in harbour.
NICO.
Wicked wretches, by my troth.
What did you do at last ?
CHRYS.
We returned again into harbour.
Nice.
'Twas cleverly done by you.
What after that ?
CHRYS.
At nightfall they returned ashore.
Nice.
Troth now, they intended to carry off the gold;
they were attempting that plan, no doubt.
CHRYS.
It didn't escape me;
I discovered it:
I was almost terrified to death by it.
As I saw that a scheme was being laid against the gold, forthwith on this we came to this de­ termination ;
the next day we carried away all the gold thence in their presence, openly and publicly, that they might know it was done.
Nice.
Skilfully managed, i' faith.
Tell me, what did they?
CHRYS.
Chopfallen at once,-soon as ever they saw us leaving the harbour with the gold, shaking their heads, they hauled their bark ashore.
We deposited all the gold with Theotimus, who is a priest there1 of Ephesian Diana.
Nice.
Who is this Theotimus?
CHRYS.
The son of Me­ galobyzus2, who is now living at Ephesus, a man most dear to the Ephesians.
Nice.
By my troth, he'll surely turn out very much more dear to me3 if he shall chouse me out of all that gold.
CHRYS.
But it is stowed away in the very temple itself of the Goddess Diana;
there they keep guard at the public expense4.
NICO.
You kill me outright;
much more safely would it have been kept in private hands.
But haven't you brought any of the gold home here ?
CHRYS.
0 yes ;
but how much he has brought, I don't know.
Nice.
How's that ?-not know ?
CHRYS.
Because Mnesi­ lochus went privately by night to Theotimus;
and didn't wish to entrust it to me, nor to any one in the ship.
For that reason I don't know how much he has brought, but he hasn't brought very much.
Nico.
Do you think it was even a half ?
CHRYS.
By my troth, I know not;
but I don't think it.
Nico.
Does he bring a'third part?
CHRYS, Troth, I think not;
but I do not know the truth.
Indeed, I know nothing at all about the gold, except that I do know nothing about it.
Now, you yourself must take a voyage there on board ship, to carry home this gold from Theotimus;
and, hearkye- (Takes him by the arm.)NICO.
What do you want ?
CHRYS.
Take care and re­ member to carry your son's ring.
Nico.
What need is there of the ring ?
CHRYS.
Because that is the token agreed on with Theotimus, that the person who brings it to him, to him he is to give up the gold.
Nico.
I'll remember it, and you advise me well.
But is this Theotimus rich ?
CHRYS.
What, do you ask that ?
Why, hasn't he the soles fastened to his shoes with gold ?
Nico.
Why does he thus despise it ?
CHRYS.
He has such immense riches;
he doesn't know what to do with his gold.
Nico.
I wish he'd give it me.
But in whose presence was this gold delivered to Theotimus ?
CHRYS.
In presence of the people;
there's not a person in Ephesus but what knows it.
Nico.
My son at least did wisely there, in entrusting that gold to a rich man to keep.
From him it may be recovered even at a moment's notice.
CHRYS.
Aye, and look here, he ll never keep you waiting even thus much (shows his finger-nail) from receiving it on the very day you arrive there.
Nico.
I thought that I had escaped a seafaring life, and that, at length, an old man of my years, I shouldn't be sailing about.
But now I find that I'm not allowed to have the choice whether I would or no;
'tis my fine host Archi­ demides has done me this.
Where, then, is my son, Mnesi­ lochus, at present ?
CHRYS.
He has gone to the market-place to pay his respects to the Deities and his friends.
Nico.
Then I'll go hence to meet him as soon as I can.
(Exit NICOBULUS.
CHRYS.
He's right well loaded, and carries more than his proper burden.
Not so very badly has this web been com­ menced by me, that I may find means for the son of my master in his amour.
I've managed it so, that he may take as much of the gold as he chooses, and give up to his father as much as he may like to give up.
The old gentleman will be going hence to Ephesus to fetch his gold;
here our life will be spent in a delicious manner, since the old man will leave me and Mnesilochus here, and not be taking us along with him.
0! what a kick-up I shall be making here.
But what's to be done, when the old gentleman shall have discovered this ?
When he shall have found out that he has made his journey thither to no purpose, and that we have mis­ spent his gold, what will become of me after that ?
I' faith, I think upon his arrival he'll be changing my name, and at once be making me Crucisalusl instead of Chrysalus.
Troth, I'll run away, if there shall be a greater necessity for it.
If I'm caught, I'll plague him for a punishment2 ;
if his rods are in the fields, still my back's at home.
Now I'll be off, and tell my master's son this contrivance about the gold, and about his mistress Bacchis who has been found.
(Exit.LYD.
Open and throw back straightway this gate of hells, I do entreat.
For, really, I do deem it nothing else;
in- asmuch as no one comes here but he whom all hopes have deserted, that he may yet be a decent person.
Bacchis—no, not Bacchis is their name, but they are most determined Bacehanals.
Avaunt from me, you sisters, who suck the blood of men.
Richly and elegantly furnished is this house -for destruction.
Soon as I beheld all this, at once I straight­ way betook myself to my heels.
And ought I to carry these things concealed in secrecy ?
Ought I, Pistoclerus, to con­ ceal from your father your excesses, or your misdeeds, or your places of resort?
by which you are aiming to drive your father and myself, and your own self and all your friends, to disgrace, and shame, and ruin altogether, and to destroy us all.
Within yourself you entertain no awe of either me or your own self on account of the deeds which you are doing;
by which you have made your own father and myself as well, your friends and your connexions, to be abettors1 in the disgrace of your excesses.
Now, before you add this mischief to the rest, I am resolved at once to tell your parent.
This instant from myself will I remove this blame, and shall dis­ close the matter to the old gentleman, that he may forthwith draw forth his son out from this loathsome pollution.
(Exit,MNES.
In many ways have I thought it over with myself, and thus I think it is;
a man your friend, who is a friend such as the name imports-except the Gods-nothing does excel him.
By fact have I experienced it so to be.
For when I departed hence to Ephesus ('tis now almost two years ago it happened), from Ephesus I sent letters hither to my friend Pistoclerus, requesting that he would find out my mistress Bacchis for me.
I hear that he has found her, as my servant Chrysalus has brought me word.
How aptly, too, has he framed a device against my father about the gold, that I may have abundance in my amour.
I see 'tis right!
that I should make a due return.
'Tis better for you to be styled extravagant than ungrateful;
but, i' faith, in my way of thinking at least, there's nothing more extravagant than the ungrateful man.
The former the good will praise, the latter even the bad will censure.
'Twere better for an ill-doer to escape than for a benefactor to be deserted.
For this reason, then, it behoves me to take the greater care;
I needs must be on the watch.
Now, Mnesilochus, the sample is on view, now the contest is being decided, whether you are or are not such as you ought to be;
good or bad, of whichever kind;
just or unjust, penurious or liberal, fretful or complying.
Take you care, if you please, lest you let your servant excel you in doing well.
Whatever you shall prove, I warn you, you shall not be concealed.
But see, I perceive my friend's father and his tutor coming this way.
I'll listen what matter 'tis they are upon.
(He retires aside.)LYD.
I'll now make trial, whether your heart is sharpened by wisdom in your breast.
Follow me.
PHILO.
Whither shall I follow?
Whither are you now leading me ?
LYD.
To her who has undone, utterly destroyed your single, only son.
PHILO.
How now, Lydus;
those are the wiser who mode rate their passion.
'Tis less to be3 wondered at if this ag does some of these things than if it does not do so;
I, a well, did the same in my youth.
LYD.
All me!
ah me!
this over-indulgence has proved his ruin.
For had he been without you, I should have had him trained up to moral rectitude;
now, by reason of you and your trusting disposition, Pistoclerus has become abandoned.
MNES. (aside).
Immortal Gods!
he names my friend.
What means this, that Lydus is thus exciting his master, Pis­ toclerus ?
PHILO.
'Tis but a little time, Lydus, that a man has a desire to indulge his inclinations;
the time will soon come, when he will hate himself even.
Humour him;
so that care is taken that he offends not beyond the line of honor, e'en suffer him.
LYD.
I'll suffer him not, nor, for my part, while I'm alive, will I allow him to be corrupted.
But you, who are plead­ ing his cause for a son so profligate, was this same your own training, when you were a young man ?
I declare that for your first twenty years you had not even this much liberty, to move your foot out of the house even a finger's length away from your tutor.
When it did happen so, this evil, too, was added to the evil;
both pupil and preceptor were esteemed disgraced.
Before the rising of the sun had you not come to the school for exercise 1, no slight punishment would you have had at the hands of the master of the school.
There did they exercise themselves rather with running, wrestling, the quoit, the javelin, boxing, the ball, and leaping, rather than with harlots or with kissing;
there did they prolong their lives2, and not in secret-lurking holes.
Then, when from the hippodromes and school of exercise you had returned home, clad in your belted frock4, upon a stool by your master5 would you sit;
and there, when you were reading your book, if you made a mistake in a single syllable, your skin would be made as spotted as your nurse's gown 1.MNES, (aside).
I'm sorely vexed, to my sorrow, that on my account these things should be said about my friend.
In his innocence he incurs this suspicion for my sake.
PHILO.
The manners, Lydus, now are altered.
LYD, That, for my part, I know full well.
For formerly, a man used to receive public honors by the votes of the people, before he ceased to be obedient to one appointed' his tutor.
But now-a-days, before he is seven years old, if you touch a boy with your hand, at once the child breaks his tutor's head with his tablet.
When you go to complain to the father, thus says the father to the child:
“ Be you my own dear boy, since you can defend yourself from an injury."
The tutor then is called for;
" Hallo!
you old good-for-nothing2, don't you be touching the child for this reason, that he has behaved so boldly;
" and thus the despised tutor becomes just like a lantern3 with his oiled linen rags.
Judgment pronounced, they go away thence.
Can this preceptor then, on these terms, keep up his authority, if he himself is to be beaten the first ?MITES, (aside).
This is a severe accusation.
So far as I understand his words, 'tis strange if Pistoclerus has never thumped Lydus with his fists.
LYD. (seeing MNESILOCIIUS).
But who is it that I see stand­ ing here before the door ?
0 Philoxenus, I would not prefer for myself to behold even the propitious Gods rather than him.
PHILO.
Who's this ?
LYD.
Why, he's Mnesilochus, the friend of your son.
He is not of a like turn of mind with him who reclines and takes his meals in brothels.
Fortu­ nate Nicobulus !
who begot him for himself.
PHILO. (advancing).
My greetings to you, Mnesilochus;
I'm glad that you have arrived safe.
MNES.
May the Gods favour you, Philoxenus.
LYD.
He, now, was born at a lucky moment fox his father;
he goes to sea, attends to the interests of his family, takes care of the house, is obedient and attentive to the wish and commands of his father.
He, when but a boy, was the com­ panion of Pistoclerus in his boyhood;
'tis not by three days that he is the older in age, but his disposition is more im­ proved by thirty years than that of the other.
PHILO.
Beware of a mischief1, and forbear to speak of him unjustly.
LYD.
Hold your peace.
You're a foolish man, who cannot bear to have him badly spoken of who does badly.
But I would rather have him draw upon my mishaps than upon my savings2.
PHILO.
Why so ?
LYD.
Because, if he were to draw upon my mishaps, he would each day be making them less.
MNES.
Why, Lydus, are you censuring your pupil, my friend ?
LYD.
Your friend is ruined.
MNES.
May the God a for­ bid it.
LYD.
'Tis so as I say.
And further, I myself saw it when he was undone ;
I am not censuring him from hearsay.
MNES.
What has been done by Mm ?
LYD.
He is disgracefully doting upon a harlot.
MNES.
Won't you be silent now ?
LTD.
She, too, like a tide, most voraciously swallows all up, whenever she has touched any one.
MNES.
Where does this woman live ?
LTD.
Here. (Points to the house)MNES.
Whence do they say she comes ?
LiD. From Samos.
MNES.
What's her name ?
LYD.
Bacchis.
MNES.
You are wrong, Lydus;
I know the whole affair, just as it is.
You are blaming Pistoclerus without reason, and in his innocence.
For he is carefully performing the business enjoined on him by his friend ano companion, his sincere well-wisher.
Neither is he himself in love, nor do you suppose him so.
LYD.
Is it necessary for him carefully to perform the busi­ ness enjoined upon him by his friend in this fashion-for him­ self, sitting down, to hold a damsel in his lap who is kissing him ?
Can the business thus entrusted be in no way trans­ acted unless ever and anon he is placing his hand upon the bosom of Bacchis, or never withdraws his lips from hers ?
But I'm ashamed to make mention of other things which I have seen him do;
when, in my presence, I saw him take most unbecoming liberties with the person of Bacchis, and yet not be at all ashamed.
What need of words is there ?
My pupil, your friend, his son (pointing to PHlLOXENUS), is ruined.
For I say that he is ruined, whose modesty in fact is lost.
What need of words is there ?
Had I been willing to wait only a little time, that I might have had a better oppor­ tunity of viewing him, I then should, I think, have seen more than would have been proper for me to see, and for him to do.
MNES. (aside).
Friend, you have undone me.
And ought I not to punish this woman with death ?
I should prefer that I should perish after some dreadful fashion.
Isn't it the fact, you know not whom to deem faithful to yourself, or in whom to put your trust ?
LYS.
Don't you see how much he grieves that your son, his friend, has been corrupted?
and how he is afflicting himself with sorrow ?
PHILO.
Mnesilochus, I beg this of you, that you will in­ fluence his feelings and his disposition.
Preserve for yourself a friend as well as a son for me.
MNES.
I fain would do so.
LYD. (to PHILOXENUS).
Much better, too, would you leave me here together with him.
PHILO.
Mnesilochus has cares, more than enough.
LYD.
Rate the man soundly, who disgraces me, yourself his friend, and others, by his excesses.
PHILO. (to MNESILOCHUS).
Upon you do I impose all this responsibility.
Lydus, follow me this way.
LYD.
I follow you.
(Exeunt PHILOXENUS and LYDUS.
MNES.
Which of the two.
now I should think to be my greater enemy, my companion or Bacchis, is extremely doubtful.
Has she chosen him in preference ?
Let her keep turn, that's the best.
Surely, by my troth, she has done this to her own loss.
For never letl any one entrust to me aught that is sacred, if I don't by an abundant example2, andas­ suredly love her.
I'll make her not to say that she has got hold of a person to make a fool of.
But I'll go home now and pilfer something from my father.
Even to such straits will I force her, that beggary shall be the lot 3——my father.
But do I really now possess my wits with a mind unimpaired, who am in this fashion prating here of these things that are to come to pass ?
I' faith, I'm of opinion that I'm in love, inasmuch as I know for sure I am.
But still, than that she, from my abundance, should, by the scraping of a single feather, grow the richer, I'd rather outvie a beggar in begging.
Never, by Heaven, while I live, shall she make a laughing-stock of me.
For I have made up my mind to pay down all the gold at once to my father.
Upon me, therefore, needy and pen­ niless, shall she fawn, at the time, when it shall be for her ad­ vantage not a whit the more than if she were saying her pretty things to a dead man at his tomb.
Beyond a doubt, 'tis my fixed determination to give the gold up to my father.
Like­ wise, I'll entreat that, for my sake, my father won't hurt Chrysalus, nor censure him at all on my account with respect to the gold which he has deceived him about.
For 'tis right that I should have a care for him, who, for my sake, has told this falsehood.
(To some ATTENDANTS).
Do you follow me.
(Goes into his father's house.)PISTOC. (speaking to BACCHIS as he comes out).
Before other matters, Bacchis, will I give place to what you enjoin me, that I find out Mnesilochus, and bring him, together with myself, to you.
But at this my mind is surprised, if my messenger has reached him, what it is that delays him.
I'll go into his house here, and see if perchance he's at home.
MNES, (as he enters).
I've given up to my father all the gold.
Now could I wish that she should meet me, after I am penniless, this fair one so scornful of me.
Yet with what great difficulty did he grant me a pardon for Chrysalus.
But I prevailed on him at last that he wouldn't be at all angry with him.
PISTOC. (apart).
Isn't this my friend ?MNES. (apart).
Isn't this my foe that I see ?
PISTOC.
For sure 'tis he.
INES.
'Tis he.
PISTOC. (apart).
I'll go to meet him, and I'll mend my pace.
(Aloud.)
Health to you, Mnesilochus !
MNES.
Hail !
PISTOC.
As you are arrived safe from abroad, a dinner must be given.
MNES.
A dinner pleases me not, which excites my choler.
PISTOC.
Has any vexation befallen you on your arrival ?
MNES.
Aye, and a very grievous one.
PISTOC.
From what quarter ?
MNES.
From a person whom heretofore I had supposed to be my friend.
PISTOC.
Many live after that manner and method, who, when you think them to be friends, are found false with their deceitfulness, strong in their talking, slothful in their doing, of faith infirm.
Not one is there whom they don't envy on their enjoying prosperity;
through their own indolence do they themselves take right good care that no envy is directed against them.
MNES.
By my troth, you surely understand their ways most thoroughly.
But still this one misfortune do they find from their bad disposition ;
they are the friends of no one, while they themselves are all at enmity against themselves;
and these, while they are deceiving themselves, in their foolishness imagine that others are deceived.
Just so is he whom I sup­ posed to be as much a friend to me as I am to my own self.
He, so far as in him lay, has taken all care to do whatever injury he could towards me, to turn all my own resources against me.
PISTOC.
This same must me a bad man..
SINES.
I judge that so he is,PISTOC.
Troth now, prithee, do tell me who it is.
MNES.
He lives on good terms with yourself.
But were he not so, I would entreat you to do him whatever harm you could do.
PISTOC.
Only tell me the person, who he is;
if I don't do him an injury, some way or other, do you say that I'm the greatest of cowards.
MNES.
The person's a bad one, but he's your friend, i' faith.
PISTOC.
So much the rather, then, tell me who he is.
In good sooth, I set no value on the esteem of a worthless per­ son.
MNES.
I appear, then, not to be able to avoid disclosing to you his name.
Pistoclerus, you have utterly undone me, your friend.
PISTOC.
How's that ?
MNES.
How's that ?
Did I not send you a letter from Ephesus about my mistress, that you should find her out for me ?
PISTOC.
I own you did ;
and I have discovered her.
MNES.
How now ?
Was there not a choice for you of other Courtesans in Athens, for you to form engagements with, instead of with her whom I had recommended to your care ?
Could you yourself begin to love, and to contrive an injury against myself?
PISTOC.
Are you in your senses ?
MNES.
I have found out the whole affair from your tutor ;
don't deny it.
You've ruined me.
PISTOC.
What, still upbraiding me without reason with these rebukes of yours ?
MNES.
Why ?
You're in love with Bacchis.
PISTOC.
But look you, two persons of the name of Bacchis are living here in this house.
MNES.
How, two ?
PISTOC.
Aye, and the two are sisters.
MNES.
You are now designedly telling idle stories.
PISTOC.
In fine, if you persist in thinking there's but little confidence in me, I'll take you upon my shoulders, and carry you hence into their house.
MNES.
Well, I'll go;
but stay a moment.
PISTOC.
I will not stay, and you shall not be holding me under a false suspicion.
MNES.
I follow you then.
(They go into the home of BACCHIS.)PAR.
Of a debauched and unscrupulous fellow am I the Parasite—a Captain, who has brought his mistress with him from Samos.
Now he has ordered me to go to her, and make enquiry whether she will pay back the gold, or whether she will depart together with him.
You, boy, who have for some time been with her, whichever of these is the house, do you knock.
Go to the door forthwith.
(The BOY goes to knock.)
Are you coming back from there, you hangdog1 ?
How the graceless scoundrel does knock!
Yo can gobble up a loaf three feet wide, and yet you don't know how to knock at a door.
(He calls out and knocks violently.)
Is there any one in-doors?
Hallo!
is there any one here?
Does any one open this door ?
Who's coming out ?
PISTOC.
What's the matter?
What's this knocking?
Why, what the confounded torment possesses you, to be exerting your strength in this fashion on another person's door?
You've almost broken the door down.
What do you want now ?
PAR.
Young gentleman, my respects.
PISTOC.
And my respects.
But whom are you looking for ?
PAR.
For Bacchis.
PISTOC.
But which of them?
PAR.
Of that I know nothing, only it's Bacchis.
In a few words, the Captain, Cleomachus, has sent me to her, either for her to pay back the two hundred golden Philippeans, or to go hence this day, together with him, to Elatia2.
PISTOC.
She doesn't go:
she says sibe shan't go.
Begone, and take back this message—she loves another person, and not him.
Take yourself off from the house.
IPAR.
You're too hasty.
PISTOC.
And would you know how hasty I am ?
By my faith, your phiz isn't far off from a mishap;
so much are these teeth-crackers (looking at his fists) longing in my fists.
PAR. (aside).
So far as I understand his words, 'tis a warn­ ing to me, lest he should knock my nut-crackers out of my jaws.
(To PISTOCLFRUS.)
At your own peril, I'll tell him this.
PISTOC.
What do you say ?
PAR.
I'll tell him that which you bade me.
PISTOC.
Who are you ?
Tell me.
PAR.
I'm the skin of his bodyl.
PISTOC.
He needs must be a scampish fellow, who has got so worthless a skin.
PAR.
He'll be coming here, swollen up with wrath.
PISTOC.
I wish he may burst.
PAR. (about to go).
Is there anything you want?
PISTOC.
Be off;
you must do so this instant.
PAR.
Good-bye, teeth-cracker.
(Exit.)
PISTOC.
And you, skin of his body, good-bye!
This matter has come to such a point, that what advice to give my friend about his mistress, I know not;
who, in his pet, has given up all the gold to his father, and not a coin is there that may be paid to the Captain.
But I'll step aside, for the door makes a noise.
0, here's Mnesilochus coming out, and pensive, too.
(He stands apart.)
MITES.
Insolent, of a froward, passionate, ungovernable, inconsiderate disposition, without reason and moderation, am I;
without fine principles of rectitude and honor, hard of belief, powerless to control my passions, born of a temper ill-disposed, unamiable and ungracious is my life2.
In fine, I am that which I could wish others to be.
There's not a person more worthless, or more unworthy for the Gods to bless, or for men to love or to associate with.
'Tis more iust that I should have enemies than friends—'tis more reasonable that the bad should give me their assistance than the good.
There's not a person more deserving of all the re­ proaches that are befitting worthless men, than I, who have given up to my father the money that was in my power.
Could this be believed by any one whatever ?
Am I not a madman, who have miserably undone myself and the device of Chrysalus ?
PISTOC. (aside).
He must now be consoled by me;
I'll accost him.
(Aloud.) Hallo, Mnesilochus!
what's the matter ?
MNES.
I'm ruined.
PISTOC.
May the Gods grant better things 1MNES.
I'm ruined.
PISTOC.
Won't you hold your tongue, simpleton ?
MNES.
Hold my tongue?
PISTOC.
You are not now quite right in your senses.
MNES.
I'm undone.
Many sharp and poignant woes are now arising in my breast.
Did I not put faith in that accu­ sation ?
Without any cause was I angry with you.
PISTOC.
Come, come, do have a good heart.
MITES.
Whence have it ?
A dead man is of more value than I am.
PISTOC.
The Captain's Parasite came here, just now, to fetch the gold hence.
I drove the fellow away from this door and from this fair one, and packed him off through my harsh language.
MNES.
But of what service is that to me ?
Wretch that I am, what shall I do ?
I have nothing;
and he certainly will carry her off.
PISTOC.
By my faith, if I had the means, I'd engage not.
MNES.
I know you'd give it me;
I know your ways;
and were you not in love, I should now have the very greatest pos­ sible confidence in your assistance.
At present, you yourself have more than enough of your own business, for me to suppose that you, who are in want yourself, are able to give me any assistance.
PISTOC.
Do but hold your tongue:
some Divinity will favour us.
MNES.
Nonsense.
(Moves as if going) PISTOC.
Do stay.
(Takes hold of him.
MNES.
What's the matter ?
PISTOC.
Why, I see Chry­ salus here, your main resource.
CHRYS. (to himself).
It's right this man (pointing to him­ self) should be worth his weight!
in gold:
it's fair that a statue of gold should be erected for him.
For, this day, two exploits have I achieved;
with twofold spoils have I been graced.
So cleverly have I gulled my elder master this day, that he has been made a fool of.
The crafty old blade, by my crafty tricks, have I compelled and constrained to believe me in everything.
Then, for the son of the old gentleman, my master here in love, together with whom I drink, with whom I cat and go a-courting, I have procured regal and golden trea­ sures, that he may take from thence at home, and not go seeking abroad.
Those Parmenos2, and those Syruses, please me not, who filch some two or three minæ from their masters.
There's nothing more worthless than a servant without skill- worthless, if he has not a breast mightily well-stocked, so that, whenever there is necessity, he may draw his supply from his own breast.
No one can be a person well to do * * * unless he understands both how to do good and how to do evil.
With rogues he must be a rogue;
with thieves let him filch whatever he can.
It befits him who is truly wise, to be a person that can shift his very skins.
Good with the good let him be, bad with the bad:
just as things are, so let him ever frame his humour.
But I should like to know how much gold my master has taken for himself, and what he has given up to his father.
If he is a prudent person, he has made a Hercules4 of his parent:
he has given him the tenth part, and has kept back nine for himself.
But, see!
the person whom I was looking for;
he meets me most opportunely.
(To MNESILOCHUS.)
Has any of your money fallen down, my master, that thus, in silence, you are looking down upon the ground ?
Why do I see you two sad and sorrowful ?
I like it not;
and 'tis not without some reason.
Are you going now to give me auy answer ?
MNES.
I'm undone, Chrysalus.
CHRYS.
Perhaps you took too little of the gold.
MNES.
How, a plague, too little ?
Why, yes, indeed, a very great deal less than too little.
CHRYS.
Why the mischief then, simpleton, since by my skill an opportunity was procured for that very purpose, that you might take as much as you pleased, did you thus take it up with the tips of two fingers1 ?
Or, didn't you know how rarely an opportunity of that kind presents itself to a person ?
iNES.
You are mistaken.
CHRYS.
Why, surely, 'tis you yourself that were mistaken, when you dip't your fingers in not deep enough.
MNES.
I' faith, you'd upbraid me more than now you do, if you knew the matter better.
I'm undone.
CHRYS.
My mind is now foreboding further mischief from those words.
MNES.
I'm ruined.
CHRYS.
How so ?
MNES.
Because I've given all up to my father, with every particle 2 of it.
CHRYS, Given it up ?
MNES.
Given it up.
CHRTS.
What, all ?
MNES.
Every jot.
CHRYS.
We are done for.
How came it into your mind to do this deed so foul ?
MNES.
I had a suspicion, Chrysalus, by reason of a charge, that Bacchis and he (pointing to PISTOCLERUS) had been playing me false ;
for that reason, in my anger, I gave up all the gold to my father.
CHRTS.
What did you say to your father when you gave up the gold ?
MNES.
That I had at once received this gold from his host, Archidemides.
CHRYS.
Eh!
by that speech you have this day consigned Chrysalus to the torture;
for, when he shall set eyes on me, the old gentleman will carry me off that instant to the executioner.
MNES.
I've besought my father.
CHRYS.
I suppose, to do, in fact, the thing that I was speaking of ?
MNES.
Nay, not to punish you, or to blame you at all on account of this business.
And with some difficulty I've pre­ vailed.
Now, Chrysalus, this must be your care.
CHRYS.
What do you wish should be my care ?
MNES.
That once again you should make a second inroad upon the old gentleman.
Contrive, devise, invent whatever you please;
frame your planar so that this day you may cleverly deceive the old man unawares, and carry off the gold.
CHRYS.
It scarcely seems possible.
to be done.
MNES.
Set about it, and you'll easily effect it.
CHRYS.
How the plague " easily," for me, whom he has this moment caught out in a lie ?
Should I entreat him not to believe me at all, he would not venture even to believe me in that.
MNES.
Aye, and if you were to hear what things he said about you in my presence.
CHRYS.
What did he say ?
MNES.
That if you were to say that this sun was the sun, he would believe it was the moon, and that that is the night which is now the day.
CHRYS.
By my troth, I'll bamboozle the old chap right well this very day, so that be shan't have said that for nothing.
PISTOC.
Now, what would you have us do ?
CHRYS.
Why, nothing, except that I beg you'll still love on.
As for the rest, ask of me as much gold as you please ;
I'll find it you.
Of what use is it for me to have the name of Chrysalus1, unless I give proofs by fact?
But now, tell me, Mnesilochus, how much gold is requisite for you.
MNES.
There's occasion for two hundred pieces at once, to pall the Captain for Bacchis.
CHRYS.
I'll find it you.
MNES.
Then we have need of some for current expenses.
CHRYS.
Aye, aye, I wish us to do each thing deliberately;
when I've accomplished the one, then I'll set about the other.
First, for the two hundred pieces, I shall direct my engine of war against the old gentleman.
If with that en­ gine I batter down the tower and the outworks, straight at the gate that instant I'll attack the old town and the new one;
if I take it, then carry to your friends the gold in baskets, just as your heart wishes.
PISTOC.
Our hearts are with you, Chrysalus.
CHRYS.
Now, do you go in-doors to Bacchis, Pistoclerus, and quickly bring outPISTOC.
What ?
CHRYS.
A pen, some waxl, tablets, and some cord.
PISTOC.
I'll have them here this instant.
(Goes into the house.).,NES.
What now are you about to do ?
Do tell me that.
CHRYS.
Let a breakfast be prepared;
there will be you two, and your mistress will make a third with you.
MNES.
Just as you say.
CHRYS.
Pistoclerus has no mistress ?
MITES.
0 yes, she's here;
he's in love with the one sister, I with the other, both of the name of Bacchis.
CHRYS.
What were you going to say?
MNES.
This;
how we are to managedCHRYS.
Where are your couchess laid out ?
MNES.
Why o you ask that ?
CHRYS.
So the matter stands;
I wish to be informed.
You know not what I am about to do, nor what a great exploit 1 shall attempt.
MNES.
Give me your hand, and follow me close, to the door.
Peep in.
(CHRYSALUS looks in at the door of the house of BACCHIS.)CHRYS.
Hurra !
'Tis a very pretty place, this, and exactly as I could wish it to be.
PISTOC.
The things that you ordered—what's ordered for a good purpose is forthwith done by the obedient.
CHRYS.
What have you brought ?
PISTOC.
Everything that you bade me bring.
CHRYS. (to MNESILOCHUS).
Do you take the pen at once, and these tablets.
MITES. (taking them).
What then ?
CHRYS.
Write there what I shall bid you ;
for I wish you to write for this reason, that your father may know the hand when he reads it.
Write now.
MNES.
What shall I write?
CHRYS.
Health to your father, in your own language.
(MNESILOCHUS writes.)
PISTOC.
Suppose he were to write " disease and death," in preference, that would be much better.
CHRYS.
Don't you interrupt us.
MNES.
What you have ordered is now written on the wax.
CHRYS.
Tell me in what terms.
MNES. " Mnesilochus sends health to his father."CHRYS.
Write this, too, quickly:
" My father, Chrysalus is always and everywhere talking at me, and in no measured terms, because I gave you up the gold, and because I did not cheat you of it."
(MNESILOCHUS writes.
)PISTOC.
Stop till he has written it.
CHRYS.
It befits the hand of a lover to be active.
PISTOC.
I' faith, that hand is more active by far at lavishing than at writing.
MNES.
Say on;
that's written down.
CHRYS, " Now, my dear father, do you henceforth be on your guard against him, for he is forming knavish plans to deprive you of the gold, and has declared that he will have it beyond a doubt."
Write legibly.
MNES.
You only dictate.
(Writes.)
CHRYS.
And he promises that he will give this gold to me, for me to give away to naughty women, and to consume it and live like a Greek1 in dens of infamy.
But, father, do you take care that he does not impose on you this day;
I entreat you, do beware."
MNES.
Do say on.
CHRYS.
Just write on, then.
MITES.
Only say what I am to writeCHRYS. (MNESILOCHUS writing). " But, father, what you promised me I beg that you will remember, that you will not beat him, but keep him in chains at your house at home."
Do you give me the wax and cord forthwith.
Come, fasten it, and seal it in an instant.
MNES. (sealing the tablets).
Prithee, what use is there in this writing after such a fashion, that he is to give no cre­ dence to you, and to keep you in chains at home ?
CHRYS.
Because it pleases me so.
Can't you possibly take care of your own self, and have no thought about me ?
In confidence in myself I undertook the task, and at my own peril do I carry on the matter.
iNES.
You say what's true.
CHRYS.
Give me the tablets.
MNES. (giving them:
).
Take them.
CHRYS, Give atten­ tion now;
Mnesilochus, and you, Pistoclerus, do you take care that each of you goes at once and reclines on his couch with his.
mistress;
so 'tis requisite;
and on that same spot where the couches are now laid, do you forthwith commence to carouse.
PISTOC.
Anything else ?
CHRYS.
This, and this especially:
when you shall have once taken your places together, don't you arise anyhow, until the signal shall be given by me.
PISTOC.
0 skilful commander !
CHRYS.
You ought by this time to have taken your second draught.
MNES.
Capital;
let's go.
CHRYS.
Do you take care of your duty, and I'll do mine.
(MNESILOCHUS and PISTOCLERUS go into the house.)
CURYS.
A tremendously great business am I undertaking, and I have my fears how in this one day I may accomplish it.
But now I have occasion for the old blade to be fierce and savage at me.
For it suits not this plan of mine that the old fellow should be calm when he has beheld me in his pre­ sence.
I'll turn him about!
this day, finely, if I live.
I'll have him parched as well as ever pea was parched2.
I'll walk before the door, that when he comes out, at once as he comes up, I may put the letterS in his hand.
(Stands near the door of BACCHIS.)
Nice.
This is a matter of great vexation to me, that Chrysalus has thus escaped me this day.
CHRYS. (aside).
I'm all right:
the old fellow is in a pas­ sion.
Now's my time for me to accost my man.
Nice.
Who speaks hard by?
(Looking round.)
Why surely this is Chrysalus, I think.
CHRYS. (aside).
I'll accost him.
NICO.
My honest ser­ vant, hail to you.
What's doing now ?
How soon do I set sail for Ephesus, to bring back the gold home from Theotimus ?
What—silent ?
I swear by all the Gods, if I didn't love my son so much as to wish everything done for him that he desires * * * * * that your sides should be wealed now right well with rods, and that in irons at the mill you should be lingering out your life.
I've learnt of Mnesilochus all your wicked pranks.
CHRYS.
Has he accused me ?
'Tis very good;
lama bad one, I am a cursed one-a wicked one.
Only reflect upon the matter.
I'll utter not one word.
Nice.
What?
Hangdog, do you even threaten me4?
CHRYS.
You'll find out before long what sort of man he is.
He ordered me just now to carry this letter to you.
He re­ quested that that which is there written may be done.
Nico.
Give it me.
CHRYS.
Take notice of the seal (Gives him the tablets.)
Nico.
I know it.
Where is he himself?
CHRYS.
I don't know.
I ought to know nothing now;
I've forgotten everything.
I know that I'm a slave;
I know not even that which I do know.
(Aside.)
Now from the springe this thrush is catching at the worm ;
he'll be finely noosed this day, so well I've set the snare.
Nico.
Stay here but a moment;
I'll return to you directly, Chrysalus.
(Goes into his house.)CiEnS.
How he does dissemble with me ;
how ignorant I am of the business he's about.
He has gone to fetch slaves from in-doors to bind me.
The ship speeds prosperously on ;
finely, too, is this craft boarding it1.
But I'll hold my tongue, for I hear the door opening.
Nico.
Artamo, do you fasten the hands of that fellow, this very instant.
(The SLATES bind him.)CHRYS.
What have I done ?
Nico.
Pitch your fist into him if he mutters a word.
(To CHRYSALUS, pointing at the tablets.)
What does this letter say ?
CHRYS.
Why do you ask me ?
As I received it from him, so I've brought it sealed to you.
Nico.
Come now, you rascal, have you not shamefully abused my son in your talk, because he gave me up that gold, and said that you would still take that gold away from me by some knavish trick ?
CHRYS.
Have I said so?
Nico.
You have.
CHRYS.
What person is there, who says that I've said so ?
Nico.
Hold your tongue.
No person says so;
this letter which you have brought me accuses you.
See, 'tis this that requests you to be chained.
(Points to the open tablets.)
CHRYS.
Ah!
your son has been making a Bellerophon2 of me;
I myself brought this letter, for the purpose that I might be bound.
Be it so.
Nice.
This I am doing for this reason, because you per­ suade my son to live like a Greek with you, you thrice-dotted villain.
CHRYS. (aside).
0 fool, fool, you know not that you are at this moment on sale;
and that you are standing on the very stone1 as the auctioneer puts you up.
NICO. (overhearing him).
Answer me;
who is selling me?
CHRYS.
He whom the Gods favour2 dies in youth, while he is in his health, has his senses and judgment sound.
This person (pointing to NICOBULUS), if any God had favoured him, ought to have been dead more than ten years-aye, more than twenty years ago.
'Tis for long, he has walked, a nuisance, on the earth ;
so devoid is he of either judgment or sense.
He is of as much value as a rotten mushroom is.
NICO.
Do you think that 1 am a nuisance to the earth ?
Away with him in-doors, and tie him tightly to the post.
You shall never take away any gold from here.
CHRYS.
No, but you'll soon be giving it me.
Nice.
I, give it you ?
CHRYS.
You'll be entreating me, too, of your own accord to receive it, when you shall come to know this accuser of mine, in how great danger and in what a dreadful situation he is.
Then will you be offering his liberty to Chrysalus ;
but I certainly shan't accept it.
Nice.
Tell me, source of mischief, tell me, in what danger is my son Mnesilochus.
CHRYS.
Follow me this way;
I'll soon let you know.
Nice.
Where on earth shall I follow you?
CHRYS.
Only three steps.
NICO.
Aye, ten even.
CHRYS.
Come, then, Artamo, do you open you this door but a very little way ;
softly, don't make it creak.
(The door. of the house of BACCHIS is opened.)
That's enough.
Now, step you hither.
(To NICOBULUS, who looks in.)
Do you see the entertainment ?
NICO.
(still looking in).
I see Pistoclerus and Bacchis right opposite.
CHRYS.
Who are upon that other couch ?
Nico. (looking on the other side).
Wretch that I am, l'in undone.
CHRYS.
Do you recognize that person ?
Nico.
I do recognize him.
CHRYS.
Now tell me, if you please, does that woman seem of handsome appearance ?
Nico.
Very much so.
CHRYS.
Well, do you take her to be a courtesan ?
Nico.
Why not ?
CHRYS.
You are mistaken,Nico.
Who is she then, prithee P CHRYS.
You'll find out;
from me, indeed, you'll get no more information to-day.
CLEOM. (aloud).
Is this Mnesilochus, the son of Nicobu­ lus, by force to detain my own mistress ?
What proceeding is this ?
Nice.
Who's this ?
CHRYS. (aside).
This Captain's oppor­ tunely come for me.
CLEOM.
He doesn't consider that I am a soldier, but a woman, who cannot defend myself and mine.
But may neither Bellona nor Mars ever put confidence in me, if I don't put him out of life, if I meet him, or if I don't make him lose possession of his existence.
Nico.
Chrysalus, who's this that's threatening my son ?
CHRYS.
This is the husband of that woman with whom he is now reclining.
Nico.
What!
The husband ?
CHRYS.
The husband, I say.
Nico.
Prithee, is she mar.
ried then ?
CHRYS.
You'll know before very long.
Nico.
Wretch that I am ;
I'm utterly undone.
CHRYS.
How now ?
Does Chrysalus seem such a villain to you?
Come, chain me now1, and do listen to your son.
Didn't I tell you that you would discover what sort of person he is ?
Nico.
What shall I do now ?
CHRYS.
Order me at once to be released, if you please;
for, if l'in not released, he'll just now be overpowering the young man in our presence.
CLEOM.
There's no gain that I should this day take so much delight in making, as I should in falling upon him as he reclines with her, so that I might kill them both.
CHRYS. (to NICOBULUS).
Don't you hear what he says ?
Why don't you order me to be released ?NICO. (to the SLAVES).
Unbind him.
I'm ruined;
wretch that I an!
I'm in a dreadful fright.
CLEOM.
Then I'd make her, who publicly puts up her person for sale, not to say that she has got a person for her to laugh at.
CHRYS. (to NICOBULUS).
You may make terms with him for a little money.
Nice.
Make terms, then, I beg, for what you like;
so that he mayn't, in our presence, fall upon the young man, or kill him outright.
CLEOM.
Unless the two hundred Philippeans are repaid to me at once, I'll this instant swallow the lives of them both outright.
Nice. (to CHRYSALUS).
Make terms with him, if you can;
prithee, do make haste;
agree for any sum you like.
CHRYS.
I'll go, and do it carefully.
(Goes up to CLEO­ MACHUS.)
Why are you exclaiming so ?
CLEOM.
Where's your master ?
CHRYS.
Nowhere;
I don't know.
Do you wish the two hundred pieces to be promised you at once, so as to make no riot or disturbance here ?
CLEOM.
There's nothing that I would desire more.
CHRYS.
And that I may heap many a curse upon you ?
CLEOM.
Just as you please.
CHRYS. (aside).
How the villain does cringe.
(To CLEOMACHUS.)
This is the father of Mnesilochus:
follow me;
he shall promise it you.
Do you ash for the gold.
As to the rest, a word's enough1.
(They go up to NICOBULUS.)
Nice.
What has been done ?
CHRYS.
I've struck the bargain for two hundred Philippeans.
Nice.
Well done!
Goddess Salvation2, thou hast saved me.
Well, how soon am I to say I'll pay it? .CHRYS. (to CLEOMACHUS).
Do you ask it of him;
and (to NICOBULUS) do you promise it him.
Nico.
I promise it.
(To CLEOMACHUS.)
Come, ask me.
CLEOM.
Will you give me two hundred golden Philip­ pean pieces, lawful money ?
CHRYS. " They shall be given," say:
do answer him.
NICO.
I'll give them.
CHRYS.
Well, now, filthy fellow is there anything owing to you ?
Why are you plaguing him ?
Why are you frightening him about death ?
Both I and he wish you every ill luck.
If you have a sword, still we have a spit at home;
with which, in fact, if you provoke me, I'll make you more full of holes than a rat's skin1 when caught in a trap.
I' faith, for my part, some time since I found out what suspicion it was that tormented you;
namely, that he was with that wife of yours.
CLEOM.
Yes;
and so he is.
CHRYS.
So may Jupiter, Juno, Ceres, Minerva, Hope, Latona, Ops, Virtue, Venus, Castor, Pollux, Mars, Mercury, Hercules, Summanus2, the Sun, Saturn, and all the Deities, prosper me, he neither re­ clines with her, nor walks, nor kisses, nor does that which is wont to be reported.
Nice. (aside).
How he does swear!
He's saving me, however, by his perjury.
CLEOM.
Where then, at this moment, is Mnesilochus ?.CHRYS.
His father has sent him into the country.
And she has gone hence to the citadel, to see the temple of Minerva.
The door's open now;
go in, and see if he's there.
CLEOM.
I'll be off to the Forum next.
CHRYS.
Or rather, by my troth, to very perdition.
CLEOM.
Am I to demand this gold to-day ?
CHRYS.
Demand it, and go hang yourself;
on t you sup pose, you worthless fellow, that we shall be entreating of you.
(Exit CLEOMACHUS.)
He'a taken himself off.
Permit me, master, I entreat you by the immortal Gods, to go in-doors here to your son.
(Pointing to the house of BACCHIS.)NICO.
But why go in there?
CHRYS.
That with many words I may rebuke him, since after this fashion he has been going on this way.
NICO.
Well, I beg you will do so, Chrysalus;
and I entreat you not to spare him in your talking to him.
CHRYS.
And do you instruct even myself?
Isn't it sum­ cient, if this day he shall hear from me more harsh things than ever Clinias heard1 from Demetrius ?
(Goes into the house OFBACCHIS.)NICO.
This servant of mine is very like a running eye;
if you have it not, you don't wish for it or desire it;
if you have it, you can't keep off from rubbing it.
But if he hadn't, by lucky chance, been here to-day, the Captain would have surprised Mnesilochus with his wife, and have killed him as an adulterer detected in the fact.
Now, in a manner have I ransomed my son with the two hundred Philippeans which I have promised to give to the Captain;
which, however, I shall not rashly pay him down, before I have met with my son.
By my troth, I'll never rashly give credence in anything to Chrysalus.
But I have a mind even once again to read over this letter;
'tis right that when a letter is sealed we should give credence to it.
( Goes into his house.)
CHRYS.
The two brothers, the sons of Atreus, are said to have done a most famous deed, when, with arms, and horses, and an army, and with chosen warriors, and with ships a thousand in number, after the tenth year, they subdued Pergamus, the native land of Priam, founded by hands divine.
Not more decidedly did it fall by the engine of war, than I shall storm my master here, without a fleet, and with­ out an army and so great array of soldiers.
I have won, I have taken by storm this gold from his father for my.
master's son, in his amour.
Now, before the old man comes here, I wish to lament until he does come out.
0 Troy! 0 my country!
0 Pergamus!
0 Priam!
old man, you are un­ done, you, who'll be wretchedly and shockingly choused out of four hundred golden Philippeans.
For those tablets, sealed on the one side and on the other, they are not tablets, but the horse which the Greeks sent, of wood.
Pistoclerus is the Epeusl;
from him were these received.
Mnesilochus is the Simon left behind.
Behold him!
not in Achilles' tomb, but on a couch he reclines:
he has Bacchis with him ;
just as the other formerly had the fire with which to give the signal ;
so now does she inflame himself.
I am Ulysses, by whose advice they do these things.
Then, the characters which there are written, are the soldiers in this horse, armed and of high courage.
So even thus far has the matter pros­ pered with me.
This horse, too, will be making his attack, not on a citadel, but on a coffer2.
A ruin, a destruction, a cleaner-out of the old man's gold, will this horse prove this day.
To this silly old man of ours, in fact, I give the name of Ilium;
the Captain is Menelaüs ;
I, Agamemnon ;
I, too, am Ulysses, the son of Laërtes ;
Mnesilochus is Alexander3, who will be the destruction of his father's fortunes ;
he has borne off the Helen, on whose account I am now carrying on the siege of Ilium.
For there I have heard say that Ulysses was both bold and full of mischief, just as I am.
I have been detected in my tricks—he, discovered in a beggar's guise, had almost perished, while he was spying out there the doings of the Trojans.
Similarly has it happened to my­ self to-day.
I have been bound, but by my devices I have redeemed myself;
he, too, preserved himself by artifice.
I have heard that there were three destinies4 attending Troy, which were fatal to it;
if the statue should be lost from the citadel;
whereas the second was the death of Troilus;
the third was when the upper lintel of the Phrygian gate!
should be demolished.
Just so are there three fatalities for this Troy of ours, corresponding with those three;
for, first of all, when, a short time since, as I told our old gentleman the lying story about his host, and the gold, and the bark, then, that instant, did I steal the statue2 from the citadel.
And even then two fatalities were remaining, and no further had I taken this city.
Afterwards, when I carried the letter to the old man, then I killed my Troilus.
When he sup­ posed, just now, that Mnesilochus was with the Captain's wife, from that, with difficulty, did I disengage myself.
And that danger do I compare to what they say, how that Ulysses, recognized by Helen3, was betrayed to Hecuba.
But as, in olden time, by his coaxing arts, he liberated himself from her, and persuaded her to let him go, so I, by my devices, have rescued myself from the danger, and have deceived the old man.
Afterwards, I engaged with the blustering Cap­ tain, who, unarmed, takes cities with his words, and there I repulsed my man.
Then I engaged in fight with the old gen­ tleman ;
straightway by one lying device did I vanquish him ;
by one blow, in a moment, did I take the spoils away from him.
He now will give the two hundred Philippean pieces to the Captain, which he has promised that he will give, * * * * Now, I have occasion for another two hundred, to be distributed when Ilium is taken, that there may be the usual draught of honeyed wine4 with which the soldiers may celebrate their triumph.
But this Priam is far superior to him of old.
Not fifty sons only has he, but four hundred, and all choice ones, without a blemish;
all these this day will I cut off at two single blows.
Now, if there were any purchaser for this Priam of ours, I would sell the old fellow in the lumpl, whom I have on sale the moment that I shall have taken the city.
But, lo!
I see our Priam standing before the door;
I'll go and speak to him.
Nico.
Pray, whose voice is it that sounds near me ?
CHRYS.
0 Nicobulus!
Nico.
What's the matter?
CHRYS. 0, capital!
Nico.
Well, have you done aught of what I sent you upon ?
CHRYS.
What—ask you that ?
Step closer this way.
Nico. (coming nearer).
Well, I do come closer.
CHRYS.
I am an excellent pleader.
By rebuking him, and by whatever hard language I really was able to think of, I forced the fellow to tears.
Nico.
What did he say ?
CHRYS.
He uttered not a word:
crying, he listened in silence to what I was saying;
in silence he wrote down on his tablets;
these sealed he gave to me;
he bade me deliver them to you.
(Gives him the tablets.)
But I am afraid that they sing to the same tune that the former ones did.
Observe the seal, is it his ?
Nico.
I recognize it.
I'd like to read them over.
(Goes to a distance.)CHRYS.
Read them through.
(Aside.)
Now is the upper lintel2 being cut down, now is the destruction of Troy near at hand.
The wooden horse is shaking it right cleverly.
Nico.
Chrysalus, just step here while I am reading these through.
CHRYS.
Prithee, what need is there for me to be near you ?
Nico.
That you may know what's written here.
CHRYS.
I don't care, and I don't wish to know.
Nico.
Still, do come here.
CHRYS.
What need is there?
Nico.
Hold your tongue.
CHRYS.
I won't, I say.
Nico.
But I will, I say.
CHRYS.
What need is there ?
Nice.
Still do you only do that which I bid you.
CHRYS.
I'll come.
'Tis right to do so;
your own ser­ vant ought to be obedient at your command.
( Goes up to him.)Nico. (looking at the tablets).
Heyday!
he hasn't been sparing1 of his wax or pen.
But whatever it is, I'm re­ solved to read it through.
Attend to me, please, this very instant.
CHRYS.
When you choose, read on;
I devote to you the attention of my ears.
Nico. (looking close).
Bless me the letters are small.
CHRYS.
To one, indeed, who cannot see well with his eyes but they are quite large enough for one who can see well.
Nice.
Give your attention then.
(He reads.) "
Father, I beseech you, do give two hundred Philippeans to Chrysalus, if you wish me to be safe or alive for you—”CHRYS.
By my troth, really a very great mistake, I tell you.
Nice.
What's the matter ?
CHRYS.
He hasn't first written the salutation to you.
NICO. (looking).
I don't see it anywhere.
CHRYS.
Even from its very commencement the letter is an impertinent one.
If you are wise, you'll not give it;
but at the best, if you give it him, why, let him find out some other porter for himself, if he is wise;
for I won't carry it if you order me ever so much.
I've been quite enough suspected as it is, when I was guiltless of a fault.
Nice.
Listen on now, while I read through what's written.
(Reading.) "
I am ashamed, father, to appear before you in your presence;
such disgraceful conduct of mine have I heard that you are aware of, that I have formed an inter­ course with the wife of a strange Captain."
By my troth, you are not joking there;
for I have saved your life from the consequences of this foul deed with two hundred golden Philippeans.
CHRYS.
There's not a particle of these things but what I've told him.
Nico. (reading).
"I confess that I have acted foolishly.
But I beseech you, father, do not forsake me, if, in my folly, I have transgressed.
Of fierce desires, and eyes uncontrolled, have I been;
I have been urged on to do a deed of which I am now ashamed."
It were proper, then, that you should have taken heed before you were ashamed.
CHRYS.
All these very same words did I say to him only just now.
Nico. (reading). " I beseech you, father, to consider that it is enough that Chrysalus has reproached me with many cutting words, and by his advice has made me a better man, so that 'tis right that you should return him sincere thanks."
CHRYS.
Is that written there ?
Nico.
Look and see, then you'll know.
(Shows him the letter.)CHRYS.
He that has so offended, how humble to all he is, and of his own accord.
Nico. (reading). " Now, father, if even yet I may be allowed to ask anything of you, do give me two hundred Phi­ lippean pieces, I do entreat you."CHRYS.
By my troth, now, not one even, if you.
are wise.
Nico.
Let me read on.
(Reading.) "
In set forml I have taken an oath that I would give this to the woman this day before nightfall, ere she leaves me.
Now, father, have a care that I be not forsworn, and take me hence away from her as soon as you can, on whose account I have incurred so much loss and guilt.
Take care and let not the two hundred pieces be a cause of annoyance to you;
I will repay you innu­ merable times as much, if I live.
Farewell, and do attend to these matters."
Now, Chrysalus, what do you think ?
CHRYS.
I won't give you one bit of advice this day, and I won't run the risk, that if any mistake is made, you should say that you had done it by my counsel.
But, as I conceive, if I were in your place, I would rather give the gold than suffer him to be corrupted.
There is a twofold choice ;
con­ eider which you would adopt;
either to lose the gold, or for a lover to be forsworn.
I neither order you, nor forbid you, nor do I persuade you.
Nico.
I'm sorry for him.
CHRYS.
You don't do anything surprising-he is your son.
If still more must be lost, 'tis better for it to go, than for this disgrace to be everywhere proclaimed.
Nico.
By my troth, I certainly had much rather he had been at Ephesus, so long as he was well, than that he had returned home.
But why don't I hasten to get rid of that which is doomed to be squandered away ?
I'll bring you just now from in-doors twice two hundred Philippeans, both those which, a little time since, to my sorrow, I promised to the Captain, and these others.
Wait there;
I'll be out to you, Chrysalus, this instant.
(Goes into his house.)
CHRYS Troy is laid waste, the chiefs have razed Pergamus.
I knew some time ago that I should be the ruin of Pergamus.
I' faith I wouldn't dare make a bet with him who should say that I was deserving of severe torture;
so great confusion am I making.
But the door makes a noise;
the plunder's being brought forth from Troy.
For the present I'll hold my tongue.
NICO.
Take you this gold, Chrysalus ;
go, carry it to my son.
But I'll go hence to the market-place to pay this to the Captain.
CHRYS.
For my part, I'll not receive it;
do you seek somebody at once to take it.
I won't have it entrusted to me.
Nico.
But do take it;
you're worrying me now.
(Holds it to him.)CHRYS.
For my part, I'll not take it.
Nico.
But, prithee do.
CHRYS.
I am telling you what is the fact.
Nico.
You are delaying me.
CHRYS.
I don't want, I say, the gold to be entrusted to me.
At all events, find some person to keep a watch upon me.
Nico.
You're plaguing me.
CHRYS.
Well, give it me, if it must be so:
(Holds out his hand.)Nico. (gives him the money).
Take care of it.
I'll be back here just now.
(Exit.CHRYS.
I've taken care that you shall be a most wretched old fellow;
this is bringing an undertaking to a fair ending;
even as it has proved my lot to go rejoicing, laden with the spoil.
With safety to myself, and the city taken by stratagem, I now bring home my whole army unhurt.
But, Spectators, don't you now be surprised that I don't go in tri­ umph ;
'tis such a common thing, I don't care for it.
Still however, the soldiers shall be received with the usual honeyed wine.
Now I'll carry off all this booty at once to the Quæstor1.
(Goes into the house of BACCHIS.)PHIL.
The more I revolve it in my breast, what disturb­ ances my son has raised, into what a course of life, and into what habits he unwittingly has headlong plunged himself, the greater is my concern, and the more do I dread lest he may be ruined or corrupted.
I know it;
I once was of the same age, and I did all these things;
but in a quiet way.
I was gay, I had my mistress, I drank, I feasted, I made presents, but still it was seldom I did so.
The methods, too, please me not which I see parents in general employ towards their sons.
I have de­ termined to give some latitude to my son, that he may have some scope for his inclinations.
I think that's right;
but still, I don't wish him to give way too much to sloth and wantonness.
Now I'm going to Mnesilochus, to see whether, as I requested, by his endeavours he has turned him for me to virtue and to sobriety;
as, indeed, I am sure he has done if he has met him, of such a disposition is he by nature.
( Exit.Nico.
Whoever there are in any place whatsoever, who­ ever have been, and whoever shall be, in time to come, fools, blockheads, idiots, dolts, sots, oafs, lubbers2, I singly by far exceed them all in folly and absurd ways.
I'm undone.
I'm ashamed of myself;
that I at this time of life should disgracefully have been twice made a fool of!
The more I think of this confusion which my son has made, the more am I incensed.
I'm ruined, and I'm utterly destroyed;
I'm dis­ tracted in every possible way.
All plagues harass me, by all modes of death do I perish.
This day has Chrysalus rent me in pieces;
Chrysalus has plundered wretched me ;
he, the villain, by his clever tricks, has shaved, to the very quick, simple me, just as he has pleased.
For the Captain says that she is a Courtezan, whom that fellow said was his wife;
and he has in­ formed me of everything, as each particular happened;
how that she had been hired by him for this year;
how that that much gold was left to be repaid1, which I, most simple man, had promised him.
'Tis this, this, I say, through which my breast boils with indignation2;
'tis this, in fine, by which I am dis­ tracted ;
that I, at my time of life, should be made a fool of, aye, by Heaven, so made a very sport of, and with my hoary head and white beard, that wretched I should be bamboozled out of my gold.
Undone am I, inasmuch as this slave of mine has dared in this way to set not the value of a nutshell upon me.
And I—if any other way I had lost a greater sum —I should have taken it less amiss, and have deemed it less of a loss to me.
PHILO. (as he enters).
For sure, some person, I know not who, seems to be talking near to me.
But who's this I see ?
Really, 'tis the father of Mnesilochus.
NICO.
Hah!
I see a partner in affliction.
Save you,
Phi­ loxenus!
PHILO.
And you;
whence are you betaking yourself?
Nice.
From a place whence comes a wretched and a luck­ less mortal.
PHILO.
Why, troth, I'm surely on the earth, the spot where it befits a wretched and a luckless mortal to be.
Nice.
We now, as we are of like age, are meeting with similar fortunes.
PHILO.
So it is.
But as to yourself, what's the matter with you ?
NICO.
I' faith, mine's the same mishap as your own.
PHILO.
Does this misfortune in any way relate to your son ?
Nice.
Such is the fact.
PHILO.
The same disease exists in my own breast.
NICO.
Aye, and that very worthy fellow, Chrysalus, has been ruining my son, myself, and all my fortunes.
PHILO.
Pray now, what is this mishap of yours about your son ?.NiO.
You shall know:
together with your own son he's undone;
both of them are keeping mistresses alike.
PHILO.
How do you know ?
Nice.
I have seen them.
PHILO.
Ah!
wretch that I am !
I'm ruined outright..
Nico.
Why do we hesitate a moment to knock and to ca them both hither out of doors.
PHILO.
I don't object.
Nico. (knocks at the door of th house of BACCHIS).
Hallo there!
Bacchis!
Bid the door t be opened this instant, if you please, unless you had rathe the door and the posts be knocked to bits with hatchets.
1st BACCH.
Who is it that calls out my name with such noise and tumult, and is knocking so hard at the door ?
NICO.
I and this person here.
(Pointing to .
PHiLOXENUS1st BACCH.
Pray, what's the matter now ?
Who has beea driving these sheep1 to us ?
Nice.
These most shocking hussies call us sheep.2nd BACCH.
Their shepherd's asleep, as they come stray­ ing thus from the flock.
1st BACCH.
But, i' faith, they are not white;
they both look dirty,2nd BACCH.
Because they have both been shorn just now.
PHILO.
How they seem to be laughing at us.
Nice.
Let them, just as long as they please.
1st BACCH.
Don't you think that these sheep are shorn three times a year ?2nd BACCH.
I' faith, to-day one of them has been already shorn twice, that's sure.
1st BACCH.
They are old and fleeceless1, both of them.2nd BACCH.
But I think they have been in good plight once.
1st BACCH.
Prithee, do you see how they are looking with a sheep's eye at us ?2nd BACCH.
By my troth, I really do believe they are with­ out any ill design.
PHILO.
This happens to us deservedly, for having come here.
1st BACCH.
Well, let them be driven in-doors to fold2.2nd BACCH.
I don't know what occasion there is for that, as they have neither milk nor wool.
Let them stand as they are.
Of whatever value they have been, they are now out of date;
all their fruit has fallen off them by this.
Don't you see, how, straying unattended, they are ranging about at liberty ?
Why, I fancy that they must be dumb with age;
they don't bleat even, though they are absent from the rest of the flock.
They seem both silly and worthless.
1st BACCH.
Let's return in-doors, sister.
NICO.
Stay where you are, both of you;
these sheep want you.2nd BACCH.
Why, surely this is a prodigy;
sheep are ad­ dressing us with a human voice.
PHILO.
These sheep will return you the heavy and great injury which they owe to you.
1st BACCH.
If you owe me aught, I forgive it you;
keep it to yourself;
I'll never demand it of you.
But what is the reason that you are threatening mischief to us ?
PHILO.
Because they say that our two lambs are shut up here.
(Pointing to the house.)
Nice.
And besides those lambs, my dog is there concealed that bitesl.
If they are not now produced to us and sent out of the house, we shall be furious rams;
we shall attack you forthwith.
1st BACCH.
Sister, I have something to say to you in private.2nd BACCH.
How now, prithee ?
(They go apart.)
Nice.
Whither are they going?
1st BACCH.
Sister, I give to you that old fellow that's farthest off, that you may have him cleverly smoothed down;
I'll now attack this other one that's angry;
if we can only entice them here in- doors.2nd BACCH.
I'll manage my task with cleverness, although 'tis to caress an old skeleton.
1st BACCH.
Take care and do your best.2nd BACCH.
Be quiet;
do you do yours;
I'll manage what I have said.
Nice.
Why are these two women holding a council here in private ?
PHILO.
What say you, my good fellow?
Nice.
What would you with me?
PHILO.
I really am ashamed to tell you a certain thing.
Nice.
What is it that you're ashamed about ?
PHILO.
Still, as you are a person, a friend of mine, I'm de­ termined to entrust you with what I could wish.
( Whispers.)
I'm good for nought.
NICO.
I've known that this long time;
but tell me why you're good for nought ?
PHILO.
I've been terribly touched with birdlime:
troth, my heart is pierced by the goad.
Nice.
I' faith, 'twere much better if your flanks were goaded, you worthless fellow.
But what is it ?
Although I suspect that I myself pretty well know already what it is;
still, I should even like to hear it from yourself.
PHILO.
Do you see that woman ?
(Pointing to the SECOND BACCHIS.)
Nice.
I see her.
PHILO.
She's not an uncomely person.
Nico.
Troth, but she is decidedly uncomely;
and you are a good-for-nothing fellow.
PHILO.
'Pon honor1.
Nico.
And do you, you rotten creature, presume to become a lover at your time of life ?
PHILO.
Why not?
Nico.
Because it's a disgrace.
PHILO.
What need of words ?
I am not vexed with my son, noryet is it right you should be vexed with yours:
if they are in love, they do wisely.
1st BACCH.
* * * Follow me this way.
(They approach the old men.)Nico.
See, they are moving at last, these allurers and enticers to disgrace.
(To the women.)
How now ?
Do you this instant restore us our sons and my servant, or am I to try rougher means with you ?
PHILO.
Won't you away with you?
You surely are not a man, to address a pretty woman so rudely in that fashion.
1st BACCH.
Most worthy old gentleman, by whatsoever is upon the earth, let me entreat this of you, that you will cease to attack this error with such great vehemence.
Nico.
If you don't away with you, although you are so handsome, I'll be doing you some great mischief just now.
1st BACCH.
I shall endure it;
I don't apprehend that any blow that you can give, will cause'me any pain.
Nico.
How smooth of speech she is.
0 me!
I am in alarm.1st BACCH. (aside).
He's more calm already.
(Aloud.)
Step this way with me in-doors ;
and there, if you choose, correct your son.
(Takes his arm.)Nico.
Avaunt from me, abomination!
(Shakes her off.)1st BACCH.
Do, my love, let me prevail upon you.
NICO.
You, prevail upon me ?
2nd BACCH.
For sure, I 1 shall prevail, at all events, upon this gentleman.
(Pointing to PHILOXENUS.)PHILO.
Yes, I beg of you to show me in-doors.2nd BACCH.
What a dear man you are.
PHILO.
But do you know on what condition you are to show me in-doors P2nd BACCH.
That 3ou are to be with me.
PHILO
You mention all that I desire.2nd BACCH.
* * * * *Nice.
I have seen wicked men;
but not one worse than yourself.
PHILO.
I am as I am.
1st BACCH. (to NICOBULUS).
Step this way in-doors with me, where you may be elegantly re­ ceived with viands, wine, and unguents.
Nice.
Enough, enough now of your banquets ;
it matters not to me how I'm received.
My son and Chrysalus have choused me out of four hundred Philippeans.
If I don't surely this day put him to the torture, may I never receive as large a sum again.
1st BACCH.
What, pray, if half the gold is paid you back ?
Will you go in-doors here with me, and so control your feelings as to forgive them their faults ?
PHILO.
He'll do it.
(Takes his arm.)
Nice.
Certainly not —I won't-I don't care-let me alone, now.
(Shakes him off.)
I had rather punish them both.
PHILO.
Take you care, you good-for-nothing man, that through your own fault you don't lose even that which the favouring Gods offer you.
One half of the gold is offered;
take it, and carouse, and enjoy yourself with your partner.
Nice.
What, am I to carouse in that very place where my son is being corrupted ?
PHILO.
You must carouse there.
Nico.
Am I to be the witness of it when she is reclining with him at table ?1st BACCH.
Nay, so far as I'm concerned, i' faith, I'll re­ cline at table with your own self.
Nico.
My head does itch so1.
(Aside.)
I'm a ruined man— I can scarce deny her.
PHILO.
And has it not before this come into your mind, that if, while you live, you enjoy yourself, that, i' faith, is for no very long time;
and that, if you lose the present day, it call never return to you after you are dead ?
NICO.
What am I to do ?
PHILO.
What are you to do ?
Do you even ask it ?
NICO.
I should like, and yet I'm afraid.
1st BACCH.
What are you afraid of?
NICO.
Lest I should be exposed before my son and my servant.
1st BACCH.
Pray now, my honey;
such things do happen.
He's your own son;
whence do you suppose that he is to have money, except that only which you give him yourself?
Let me obtain pardon of you for them both.
Nico. (aside).
How she does work her way.
She's now pre­ vailing on me against that which I was quite resolved upon.
1st BACCH.
I will love you, and embrace you,Nice.
Through your doing, and for your sake am I cor­ rupted.
1st BACCH.
I certainly had rather 'twere for your own than for mine.
Nico.
Come then, however that may be, although it is to my disgrace, I'll submit;
I'll induce my feelings to do so.
1st BACCH.
Have I that solemnly promised?
* *Nice.
What I have once said, I will not alter.
1st BACCH.
The day wears apace.
Come into the house, to take your places at table:
your sons are expecting withinNice.
How soon, in fact, we may be dead, d'ye mean ?1st BACCH.
'Tis evening, already ;
come, follow us.
PHILO.
Lead us in like bondsmen1.
(They go into the house.)1st BACCII. (to the SPECTATORS).
Right cleverly are these persons entrapped2 themselves, who for their sons had laid a snare.
(Goes in.)
Had not these old men been worthless from their youth upwards, they would not, with their hoary heads, have this day done an action so disgraceful;
nor, indeed, should we have represented this, if we had not, before this, seen it happen that fathers became the rivals of their sons in the houses of pro­ curers.
Spectators, we wish you Farewell !
and that you will grant us loud applause.

Scene.
-Athens:
a Street before the house of ANTIPHO and those of EPIGNOMUS and PAMPHILUS ;
the two latter being next door to each other.
THE plot of this Play (which is supposed by some Commentators not to have been written by Plautus) is extremely meagre.
Antipho, a wealthy and jovial old gentleman of Athens, has two daughters, Philumena and Pamphila.
They are married to two brothers, Epignomus and Pamphilus, who, having run through their property in the company of idlers and Parasites, have, with the view of retrieving their fortunes, taken to merchandize.
Having been absent three years from home, and no tidings being heard of them whether they are alive or not Antipho assumes the prerogative of a father, and requests his daughters to marry again;
who resolve, however, to maintain their fidelity to their absent husbands.
Pbilumena sends the Parasite, Gelasimus, to the harbour to see if any ships have arrived.
In the meantime, the boy, Pinacium, brings her word that her husband has returned to Athens.
He and his brother meet the Parasite, and resist all his attempts to fasten himself upon them;
they then go home, and become reconciled to Antipho, from whom, in their poverty, they had become estranged;
and who now requests them to make him a present of a female slave.
Stichus, the servant, obtains a day's holiday, together with a present from his master of a cask of wine.
He makes an entertainment for himself, his friend Sagarinus, and their mistress Stephanium.
The Play con­ eludes with a dance, to the music of the Piper.
An old man (Senex) rebukes his daughters because they are so (Tam) persevering in thus (Ita) adhering to their husbands, brothers, poor and abroad, and in not deserting them.
And, on the other hand (Contra), he is softened down by prudent words to allow them to retain (Habere) those whom they have already got.
Enriched with wealth, their husbands (Viri) come back from beyond the sea;
each one retains his own (Suam) wife, and to Stichus a holiday is given.
PHIL.
Sister, I think that Penelope was wretched from her very soul, who was so long deprived of her husband;
for from our own fortunes, whose husbands are absent from us, we judge of her feelings;
for whose affairs, still, in their absence, both night and day, sister, as is becoming, we are ever anxious.
PAM.
'Tis right that we should do our duty;
and we do not that any further than affection bids us.
PHIL.
But, sister, step this way a moment;
I want to speak about the affairs of my husband.
PAM.
Ain't they prospering, pray ?
PHIL.
I hope and wish so, indeed.
But, sister, at this am I vexed, that your and my father, one who is esteemed as espe- cially honorable among all his fellow-citizens, should be now acting the part of a dishonorable man;
who is unde­ servedly doing so great an injustice to our absent husbands, and is wishing to separate us from them.
These things, sister, render me tired of existence;
these things are a care and a vexation to me.
(She sheds tears.)PAM.
Weep not, sister, nor do that to your feelings which your father is threatening to do.
'Tis to be hoped1 that he will act more righteously.
I know him well;
he says these things in jest;
and he would not earn for himself the mountains of the Persians, which are said to be of gold2, to do that of which you are in dread.
Still, if he does do it, it befits you by no means to be angry;
nor will it happen without some reason.
For this is the third year since our husbands have been away from home.
PHIL.
'Tis as you say;
while, in the meantime, they may be living, and may be wells, they do not make us ac­ quainted where they are, what they are doing, whether they are doing well, neither do they return.
PAM.
And do you, sister, regret this, that they do not observe their duty, whereas you do yours ?
PHIL.
Troth, I do.
PAM.
Hold your peace, if you please;
take care, please, that I hear not that same thing from you in future.
PHIL.
And why, pray ?
PAM.
Because, i' faith, in my opinion, 'tis proper for all prudent people to observe and to do their duty.
For that reason, sister, although you are the older, I advise you to remember your duty;
and if they are unjust and act otherwise to us than is right, then, i' faith, in exactly the same degree, that there may be no further mis­ chief, it befits us studiously to remember our duty by all means in our power.
PHIL.
'Tis good;
I'm silenced.
PAM.
But do take care and remember it.
PHIL.
I do not wish, sister, to be thought to be unmindful of my husband;
nor has he thrown away the distinction that he conferred upon me.
For, by my troth, his kindness is pleasing and delightful to me ;
and, really, this choice of mine is not now irksome to me, nor is there any reason why I should wish to abandon this match.
But, in fine, 'tis placed in our father's power1;
that must be done by -as which our rela­ tives enjoin.
PAM.
I know it, and in thinking of it I am overwhelmed with grief;
for already has he almost disclosed his sentiments.
PHIL.
Let us consider, then, what is necessary for us to do.
ANT.
The man in condition of a servant who always waits to be told his duty, and doesn't remember to do it of his own accord, that servant, I say, is not of a deserving character.
You remember well on each returning Calends to ask for your allotment of provisions2;
why, then, do you less remem­ ber to do what is necessary to do about the house ?
Now, therefore, if, when I return, the furniture shall not be set for me, each piece in its proper place, I'll be putting you in mind with a bull's hide remembrancer3.
Not human beings seem to be living with me, but pigs.
Take care, if you please, that my house is clean, when I return home.
I shall soon be back home;
I'm going to her house, to see my eldest daughter.
If any one should enquire for me, call me thence, some of you;
orI shall be here soon myself.
PHIL. (aside).
What are we to do, sister, if our father shall resolve against us ?
PANI.
It befits us to submit to what he does whose power is the stronger.
By entreating, not by opposing, I think we must use our endeavours.
If with mildness we ask for favour, I trust to obtain it of him.
Oppose him we cannot, without disgrace and extreme criminality;
I will neither do that myself, nor will I give you the advice to do it, but rather that we should entreat him.
I know our family1;
he will yield to entreaty.
ANT. (speaking to himself).
In the first place, in what manner I should make a beginning with them, about that I am in doubt;
whether I should accost them in language couched in ambiguous terms, after this fashion, as though I had never pretended2 anything at all against them, or whether as though I had heard that they were deserving of some cen­ sure against them ;
whether I should rather try them gently or with threats.
I know that there will be opposition ;
I know my daughters right well.
If they should prefer to remain here rather than to marry afresh, why, let them do so.
What need is there for me, the term of my life run out, to be waging war with my children, when I think that they don't at all de­ serve that I should do so ?
By no means ;
I'll have no dis­ turbances.
But I think that this is the best thing to be done by me;
I'll do thus;
I'll pretend as though they had themselves been guilty of some fault;
I'll terribly terrify their minds this day by some ambiguous expressions;
and then, after that, as I shall feel disposed, I'll disclose my­ self.
I know that many words will be spoken;
I'll go in.
(Goes to the door of PHILUMENA'S house.)
But the door's open.
PHIL.
Why, surely the sound of my father's voice reached my ears.
PAM.
I' troth, 'tis he ;
let's hasten to meet him with a kiss.
(They both run to kiss him.)PHIL.
My father, my respects.
ANT.
And to you the same.
Away this instant, and be off from me.
(-Removes her.)PHIL.
One kiss.
ANT.
I've had enough of your kissing.
PHIL.
Prithee, father, why so ?ANT.
Because, as it is, the seasoning of your affection has reached my soul1.
PAM.
Sit down here, father.
(Points to a chair.)
ANT.
I'll not sit there ;
do you sit down;
I'll sit on the bench2.
(Sits on a bench.)ANT.
You take kind care of me;
I'm nicely seated now as I am3.
PAM.
Do let me, father.
(Goes into the house.)
ANT.
What need is there ?
PAM.
There is need.
(Coming out, and bringing a cushion.)ANT.
I'll submit to you.
(Arranging the cushion.)
Yes, this does very well.
PAM.
Why, daughters can never take too much care of their parent.
Whom is it proper that we should esteem more dear than yourself ?
And then, in the next place, father, our husbands, for whom you have chosen that we should be the mothers of families.
ANT.
You do as it is proper for good wives to do, in esteem­ ing your husbands, though absent, just as though they were present.
PAM.
'Tis propriety, father, for us to highly honor those who have chosen us as companions for themselves.
ANT.
Is there any other person here to listen with his ears4 to our conversation?
PHIL.
There's no one except us and yourself.
ANT.
I wish your attention to be given;
for, unacquainted with female matters and ways, I come now as a pupil to you, my instructresses;
in order that each of you may tell me what endowments matrons ought to have, who are the best esteemed.
PAM.
What's the reason that you come hither to enquire about the ways of females ?
ANT.
Troth, I'm looking for a wife, as your mother's dead and gone.
PAM.
You'll easily find, father, one both worse and of worse morals than she was;
one better you'll neither find nor does the sun behold.
ANT.
But I'm making the enquiry of you, and of this sister of yours.
PAM.
I' faith, father, I know how they should be, if they are to be such as I think right.
ANT.
I wish, then, to know what you do think right.
PAM.
That when they walk through the city, they should shut the mouths of all, so that none can speak ill of them with good reason.
ANT. (to PHILUMENA).
And now speak you in your turn.
PHIL.
What do you wish that I should speak to you about, father?
ANT.
How is the woman most easily distinguished, who is of a good disposition ?
PHIL.
When she, who has the power of doing ill, refrains from doing so.
ANT.
Not bad that.
(To PAMPHILA.)
Come, say you, which choice is the preferable, to marry a maiden or a widow ?
PAM.
So far as my skill extends, of many evils1, that which is the least evil, the same is the least an evil.
He that can avoid the women, let him avoid them, so that each day he takes care, the day before, not to do that which, the day after, he may regret.
ANT.
What sort of woman, pray, seems to you by far the wisest ?
PHIL.
She who, when affairs are prosperous, shall still be able to know herself, and who with equanimity can en­ dure it to be worse with her than it has been.
ANT.
By my troth, in merry mood have I been trying the bent of your dispositions.
But 'tis this for which I am come to you, and for which I wished to meet you both.
My friends are advising me to the effect that I should remove you hence to my own house.
PAM.
But still, we, whose interests are concerned, are ad­ vising you quite otherwise.
For either, father, we ought not formerly to have been bestowed in marriage, unless our hus­ bands pleased you, or, it is not right for us now to be taken away when they are absent.
ANT.
And shall I suffer you while I am alive to remain married to men who are beggars ?
PAM.
This beggar of mine is agreable to me;
her own king is agreablel to the queen.
In poverty have I the same feelings that once I had in riches.
ANT.
And do you set such high value on thieves and beggars ?
PHIL.
You did not, as I think, give me in marriage to the money, but to the man.
ANT.
Why are you still in expectation of those who have been absent for now three years ?
Why don't you accept an eligible match!!
in place of a very bad one ?
PAM.
'Tis folly, father, to lead unwilling dogs to hunt.
That wife is an enemy, who is given to a man in marriage against her will.
ANT.
Are you then determined that neither of you will obey the command of your father ?
PHIL.
We do obey;
for where you gave us in marriage, thence are we unwilling to depart.
ANT.
Kindly good b'ye;
I'll go and tell my friends your resolutions.
PAM.
They will, I doubt not, think us the more honor­ able, if you tell them to honorable men.
ANT.
Take you care, then, of their domestic concerns, the best way that you can.
(Exit.PHIL.
Now you gratify us, when you direct us aright:
now we will hearken to you.
Now, sister, let's go in- doors.
PAM.
Well, first I'll take a look at home.
If, perchance, any news should come to you from your husband, take you care that I know it.
PHIL.
Neither will I conceal it from you, nor do you con­ ceal from me what you may know.
(Calls at the door of her house.)
Ho there, Crocotium1, go, fetch hither Gelasimus, the Parasite;
bring him here with you.
For, i' faith, I wish to send him to the harbour, to see if, perchance, any ship from Asia2 has arrived there yesterday or to-day.
But, one servant has been sitting at the harbour whole days in waiting ;
still, however, I wish it to be visited every now and then.
Make haste, and return immediately.
(Each goes into her own house.)GEL.
I do suspect that Famine was my mother;
for since I was born I have never been filled with victuals.
And no man could better return the favour to his mother, than do I right unwillingly return it to my mother, Famine.
For in her womb, for ten months she bore me, whereas I have been carrying her for more than ten years in my stomach.
She, too, carried me but a little child, wherefore I judge that she endured the less labour;
in my stomach no little Famine do I bear, but of full growth, i' faith, and extremely heavy.
The labour-pains arise with me each day, but I'm unable to bring forth my mother, nor know I what to do.
I've often heard it so said that the elephant is wont1 to be pregnant ten whole years;
for sure this hunger of mine is of its breed.
For now for many a year has it been clinging to my inside.
Now, if any person wants a droll fellow, I am on sale, with all my equipage:
of a filling-up for these chasms am I in search.
When little, my father gave me the name of Gelasimus2, because, even from a tiny child, I was a droll chap.
By reason of poverty, in fact, did I acquire this name, because it was poverty that made me to be a droll;
for whenever she reaches a person, she instructs him thoroughly in every art.
My father used to say that I was born when provisions were dear;
for that reason, I do believe, I am now the more sharply set.
But on our family such complacence has been bestowed —I am in the habit of refusing no person, if any one asks me * out to eat.
One form of expression has most unfortunately died away with people, and one, i' faith, most beseeming and most elegant to my thinking, which formerly they employed:
" Come here to dinner-do so-really, do promise-don't make any difficulties-is it convenient ?
—I wish it to be so, I say;
I'll not part with you unless you come."
But now, in the present day, they have found a substitute for these expres­ sions-a saying, by my faith, truly right worthless and most vile:
" I'd invite you to dinner, were I not dining out myself."
I' faith, I wish the very loins of that phrase broken, that it mayn't repeat its perjury if he does dine at his own house.
These phrases reduce me to learn foreign habits3, and to spare the necessity for an auctioneer, and so proclaim the auction, and put myself up for sale.
CROC. (aside).
This is the Parasite, whom I've been sent to fetch.
I'll listen to what he's saying, before I accost him.
GEL.
Now there are a good many curious mischief-makers here, who, with extreme zeal, busy themselves with the affairs of other'people, and who have themselves no affairs of their own to busy themselves with.
They, when they know that any one is about to have an auction, go forthwith and sift out what's the reason;
whether a debt compels it, or whether he has purchased a farm;
or whether, on a divorce, her marriage- portion is to be repaid to his wifel.
All these, although, i' faith, I don't judge them undeserving, in their most wretched state, to go toiling on, I don't care about.
I'll proclaim the reason of my auction, that they may rejoice in my mishaps, for there's no person a busybody but what he's ill-natured too.
Very great mishaps, alas!
have befallen wretched me.
So dreadfully afflicted has my property2 ren­ dered me:
my many drinking-bouts are dead and gone;
how many dinners, too, that I've bewailed, are dead!
how many a draught of honeyed wine;
how many breakfasts, too, that I have lost within these last three years!
In my wretchedness, for very grief and vexation have I quite grown old.
I'm almost dead with hunger.
CROC, (aside).
There's no one such a droll, as he is when he is hungry.
GEL.
Now am I resolved that I'll make a sale:
out of doors3 am I obliged to sell whatever I possess.
Attend, if I you please;
the bargains will be for those who are present.
I've funny ion mots1 to sell.
Come, bid your price.
Who bids a dinner ?
Does any one bid a breakfast ?
They'll cost vou an Herculean breakfast2 or dinner.
Ho, there!
(to one of the SPECTATORS) did you nod to me ?
No one will offer you better—I won't allow that any Parasite has better quibbles, cajoleries, and parasitical white lies3.
I'm selling a rusty flesh-scraper4, too ;
a rusty-coloured brown bottle5 for the Greek unguents1 at the sweating-baths2 ;
delicate after-dinner powders3;
an empty Parasite as well (pointing to himself), in whom to lay by your scraps.
'Tis needful that these should be sold at once for as much as they can;
that, if I offer the tenth part to Hercules4, on that account it may be greater * * * * * *CROC. (aside).
An auction of no great value, by my troth.
Hunger has taken hold of the very deepest recess of the fel­ low's stomach.
I'll accost the man.
(Moves towards him.)GEL.
Who's this that's coming towards me ?
Why, surely this is Crocotium, the maid-servant of Epignomus.
CROC.
My respects, Gelasimus.
GEL.
That's not my name.
CROC.
I' faith, for sure that used to be your name.
GEL.
Distinctly it was so, but I've lost it by use.
Now I'm called Miccotrogus5 from what is fact.
CROC.
0 dear!
I've laughed a good deal at you to-day.
GEL.
When ?
or in what place ?
CROC.
Here, when you were carrying on a most worthless auction.
GEL.
How now;
did you really hear it ?
CROC.
Aye, and one really right worthy of yourself.
GEL.
Where are you bound for now ?
CROC.
For yourself.
GEL.
Why have you come ?
CROC.
Philumena bade me ask you by all means to come to visit her at her house this instant, together with me.
GEL.
I' faith, but I'll surely come there as fast as I can.
Are the entrails cookedl by this ?
With how many lambs has she been sacrificing ?
CROC.
Indeed, she hasn't been sacrificing at all.
GEL.
How P
What does she want with me, then ?
CROC.
I think that she's going to ask you for ten mea­ sures of wheat.
GEL.
Or me rather ask it of her ?
CROC.
No;
that you yourself should lend them to us.
GEL.
Tell her that I've nothing to give myself, or that she could wish to borrow, nor anything whatever, except this cloak that I have on.
Even my very tongue that so freely used to offer itself2 I've sold as well.
CROC.
How ?
Have you got no tongue ?
GEL.
Why, the former one, that used to say “ here, take mes," I've lost:
see, here's one now that says give me."
(Puts out his tongue.)CROC.
A curse may the Gods give you * * * *GEL.
Aye. if a curse you want, this same tongue will give you that.
CROC.
Well now, are you coming or not ?
GEL.
Well, be off home;
tell her I'll be there this mo­ ment ;
make baste and be off.
(CROCOTIUM goes into the house.)
I wonder why she has requested me to be fetched to her, who has never, before this day, requested that I should be fetched to her, ever since her husband left.
I wonder what it can be;
except it is for some experiment to be made upon me;
I'll go see what she wants.
But see, here's her boy, Pina­ cium.
Look at that now;
how very facetiously and just like a picturel does he stand ?
Full many a time, for sure, in good troth, has he poured out for me the wine, almost unmixed, right cleverly into a very tiny cup2 indeed.
(Stands aside.)PIN. (to himself).
Mercury, who is said to be the messenger of Jove, never bore such pleasing tidings to his father, as I shall e'en now be telling to my mistress.
So loaded do I bear my breast with joy and with delight;
and really I don't care to speak a syllable but in a highflown style.
The charms of all the loves and graces do I bring;
my heart, too, is overleaping its banks, and overflowing with joyousness.
Now have you the means of acquiring glory, fame, and honor;
make haste, Pina­ cium, exhort your feet to swiftness, grace your message by your deeds, and come to the rescue of your mistress in her need * * * * * who is so wretched in awaiting the ar­ rival of her husband, Epignomus ;
just as becomes her does she dote upon her husband, and anxiously long for him.
Now, Pinacium, do as pleases you, run on, just as you like;
take care and regard no person at the value of a straw;
thrust them from the path with your elbows;
make right smooth your way.
If a king shall come in your way, upset the king himself forthwith.
GEL. (apart).
Why, I wonder1, is Pinacium running so overladen with baggage2 P He's carrying a rod, and a basket, and a fish-hook.
PiN. (to. himself).
But yet, I think 'tis proper that my mistress should come with entreaty to me, and that she should send envoys to me, and gifts of gold, and chariots in which for me to be borne, for I can't go on foot.
Therefore I shall now go back.
(Turns back.)
I think it is only proper that I should be approached and addressed with entreaties.
And do you really think that it's mere nonsense or nothing at all that I am now acquainted with ?
Blessings so great am I carrying from the harbour, joys so extensive am I bringing, that hardly could my mistress herself presume to wish this of the Gods, if she were to know it.
And am I to carry it, then, of my own accord ?
It pleases me not, nor do I think that the duty of a man.
This way does it seem to be better suited to this news of mine;
let her come to meet me, let her entreat me to communicate to her this news.
Haughtiness and pride befit prosperous fortunes.
But, at last, when I reconsider it, how could she know that I know this?
(Turning round.)
Well, I can't do otherwise than return, than speak, than relate it at length, and relieve my mistress of her grief, and both mightily increase the good deeds of my ancestors, and present her with a comfort unhoped for and oppor­ tune.
I'll outdo the deeds of Talthybius3, and I'll set all messengers at nought, and at the same time I'll think about the running at the Olympic games.
But this distance4 is far too short for the course;
how sorry for it I am.
How's this ?
I see the door's closed.
I'll go and knock at the door.
(Knocks at the door of PHILUMENA'S house) Open, and make haste, cause the door to be thrown open;
away with all delay.
This matter is attended to too carelessly;
see how long I've been standing here and knocking.
Are you in­ dulging yourselves with a nap ?
I'll try whether the door or my arms and feet are the stronger.
(Knocks and kicks) I wish much that this door would run away from its master, that for that reason it might meet with a heavy punishment1.
I'm tired of knocking.
Well, be this the last for you.
(Knocks again.)GEL. (apart).
I'll go and accost him.
(Accosts PINACIUM.)
Good day to you.
PIN.
And good day to you.
GEL.
Are you turned fisher­ man, then ?
PIN.
How long is it since you ate ?
GEL.
Whence come you ?
What are you carrying ?
Why are you in a hurry ?
PIN.
About that which is no business of yours, don't you trouble yourself.
GEL.
What's there in that ?
(Taking up the lid of the basket) PIN.
Snakes, for you to eat.
GEL.
Why are you so pettish?
PIN.
If you had any shame, you wouldn't address me.
GEL.
May I learn the truth from you ?
PIN.
You may ;
this day you'll get no dinner.
PHIL.
Who now, pray, is breaking this door down ?
(To GELASIMUS.)
Are you doing this ?
Do you come to me like an enemy ?
GEL.
My respects to you ;
I come at your bidding.
PHIL.
And is it for that reason you are breaking down my door ?
GEL.
Scold your own people;
the offenders are your own.
I came to see what you wanted me for.
Why, for my own part, I pitied this door.
PIN.
For that reason your assistance was given so very readily.
PHIL.
Pray, who's that, talking here so near to us ?
GEL.
Pinacium.
PHIL.
Where is he ?
(Looks on each side.)PIN. (coming forward).
Attend to me, and leave alone that needy Parasite, Philumena.
PHIL.
Pinacium.
PIN.
That name my elders gave me.
PHIL.
What's your business ?
PIN.
What's my business, do you ask ?
PHIL.
Why shouldn't I ask it ?
PIN.
What's yours with me?
PHIL.
Do you insult me, impudent fellow ?
Answer me, this very instant, Pinacium.
PIN.
Bid those, then, to let me alone, who are detaining me.
PHIL.
Who are detaining you?
PIN.
Do you ask me that ?
A lassitude is in possession of all my limbs.
PHIL.
Well, I know right well that it's not in posses­ sion of your tongue.
PIN.
With such rapid speed have I been hastening from the harbour, for the sake of your own well-doing.
PHIL.
Why, do you bring any good news ?
PIN.
I bring more, by very much, than you expect.
PHIL.
I'm saved, then.
PIN.
And I'm done for;
lassi­ tude is drinking up my marrow apace.
GEL, What, then, am I, the marrow of whose stomach, to my sorrow, famine has seized upon ?
PHIL.
Did you meet any one ?
PIN.
Many.
PHIL.
But any man ?
PIN.
Very many;
but, of the many, not one a greater rascal than he is.
(Points at GELASIMUS.)PHIL.
How so ?
GEL.
I have been affronted already at his saying uncivil things to me.
If you irritate me any further(Holds up his fist to PINACIUM.)PIN, I' faith, you'll be plaguy hungry to eat me.
GEL.
I'll cause you to know that assuredly you've said that with reason.
PIN.
I wish everything to be made clean.
(Calls to the SERVANTS from the door.)
Bring out here your brooms, and a reed as well,l that I may destroy all the labours of the spiders and their plaguy webs, and rout out all their looms.
(The SERVANTS bring some brooms.)GEL.
The poor things will be cold in future.
PIN.
What ?
Do you think that they are just like yourself, with only one coat ?
Take this broom.
(Gives him a broom.)GEL.
I'll take it.
PIN.
This I'll take myself, Do you sweep away there.
GEL.
I'll do so.
(Sweeps away.) PIN. (calling aloud).
Will some one bring here a pail and water1 ?
GEL.
Really, this fellow's playing the Ædile2 without the vote of the public even.
(The water is brought.)PIN.
Come, do you quickly sweep the ground, and sprinkle before the house.
GEL.
I'll do so.
PIN.
It needs be done.
I'll knock down the spider-webs there from the door and from the wall.
GEL.
I' faith, a troublesome business, this.
PHIL.
Still, I don't at all understand what it means;
un­ less, perchance, some guests are about to come ?PIN. (ordering the SERVANTS).
Do you spread the couches.
GEL. (aside).
The beginning pleases me, about the couches.
PIN.
Others, you chop the billets;
others, you clean the fish which the fisherman has brought;
take you down the gammon of bacon and the collar of brawn3..GEL. (aside).
I' faith, this is a very sensible fellow.
PHIL.
By my troth, as I imagine, you haven't quite minded the directions of your mistress.
PIN.
Why, I've left all matters unattended to by reason of what you wished.
PHIL.
Then do you inform me upon that, on account of which you were sent to the harbour ?
PIN:
I'll tell you.
After, with the daybreak, you had sent me to the harbour, the sun with its beams opportunely arose from out of the sea.
While I was enquiring of the revenue officers whether any ship had arrived from Asia, and they were saying none had come, I beheld, in the meantime, a bark, than which I think I never saw a greater one.
With a favouring breeze, and in full sail, it came into harbour.
We were enquiring one of another whose ship it was, and what it carried ?
In the meantime I espied your husband and his servant Stichus.
PHIL.
Ha!
what?
Did you mention Epignomus?
GEL.
Your husband and my own life.
PIN.
He has arrived, I say.
PHIL.
Did you see him yourself ?
PIN.
Tes, and with pleasure too.
GEL.
I' faith, I'll surely take the broom, and sweep this place with pleasure.
PIN.
He has brought a great amount of silver and gold.
GEL.
'Tis right cleverly done.
PIN.
Wool and purple in plenty.
GEL.
Aye, for me to clothe my carcase with.
PIN.
Couches, adorned with ivory and gold.
GEL.
I'll recline at table right regally.
PIN.
Besides—Babylonian coverings for couchesl, and carpets dyed in purple, has he brought.
GEL.
Abundance of fine things.
I' faith, his business has been successful.
PIN.
Then, as I began to say, female players on the harp, on the pipe, sackbuts too2, has he brought with him, of sur­ prising beauty.
GEL.
Capital!
Whon I'm at my wine, I'll be quite sportive;
then am I in merriest pin.
PIN.
Besides many unguents of numerous kinds.
GEL.
I'll not sell my bon mots;
I'll not have an auction now;
I've got an estate in feel.
Let the mischievous hunters of auctions go to perdition.
Hercules, I congratulate thee that the tenths which I vowed to thee are increased.
'Tis my hope that at length, by some means or other, I may expel this plaguy famine from my stomach.
PIN.
And then, besides, he has brought some Parasites2 with him.
GEL.
Alas!
to my confusion, I'm undone.
PIN.
Right funny fellows.
GEL.
I' faith, I'll sweep this dust back, which I just now swept together.
(Sweeps it back).
Those bon mots are now on sale, which I was saying I wouldn't sell.
I'm done for:
now there is occasion for spiteful persons to rejoice at my misfortune.
Hercules, thou who art a God, thou really hast departed not oppoi­ tunely.
PHIL.
Did you see Pamphilus, the husband of my sister ?
PIN.
No. PHIL.
Isn't he there ?
PIN.
Yes, they said that he had come as well.
I ran hither before them, with all speed, that I might bring the welcome tidings.
PHIL.
Go in-doors, Pinacium;
bid the servants prepare the sacred things3 for me.
(To GELASIMUS.)
Fare you well!
GEL.
Do you want me to assist ?
PHIL.
I have servants enough in the house.
(PHILUMENA. and PINACIUM go into the house.)GEL. (to himself).
In good sooth, Gelasimus, I doubt you have come to but little purpose, if neither he'that is here gives you any aid, nor yet he that's coming.
I'll off in- doors to my books4, and take my instructions from the cleverest sayings;
for if I don't drive away those fellows, the Parasites that are coming, most surely I'm undone.
(Exit.EPIG.
Inasmuch as, my business prosperously carried on, I am returned safe home, thanks do I return to Neptune and to his tempests;
to Mercury as well1, who in my traffic has aided me, and by my profits has rendered my property fourfold.
Those whom formerly I affected with sorrow at my departure, the same shall I now make joyous at my ar­ rival.
But already have I met my connexion Antipho, and from bad terms have I returned to friendship with him.
See, prithee, what money can effect.
Since, my affairs pros­ pering, he sees that I've returned, and brought home great wealth, without any mediators, there on' board the ship, upon the deck, we have returned to friendship and good feeling.
Both he and my brother dine with me this day;
for yesterday we were both in the same harbour2 together;
but to-day my ship weighed anchor a little the soonest.
Take these people in-doors, Stichus, whom3 I've brought with me.
STICH.
Master, whether I'm silent or speak, I'm sure you know how many hardships I've endured in your ser­ vice;

You ask what's just and right.
Stichus, you may take this day for yourself;
I don't object to it.
Go where you like.
A cask, too, of old wine, I give you to drink.

This plan have I thus resolved upon.
I have a mistress here in the neighbourhood, Stephanium, the servant- maid of your brother.
I'm going to invite her;
I'll take her to a pic-nic entertainment:
!
at her fellow-servant's, Sagarinus We both have the same mistress ;
we are rivals.
Epic.
Come then, conduct them in.
I grant you this day.
STICH.
Hold me to blame if I don't make the most of it3.
Troth now, I'll pass through the garden to my mistress, to engage her beforehand for me this evening;
at the same time I'll give my contribution, and bid the dinner to be cooked at Sagarinus's, or else I'll go myself and make my marketing as caterer.
Sagarinus, * * * * * * * a servant * * * for my * * * * * with stripes * * * * to take him home well thrashed, I'll make all things to be in readiness here;
but I'm delaying myself.
And don't you be surprised!
(to the AUDIENCE) that men, who are slaves, drink, court, and give invitations to dinner ?
This is allowed us at Athens.
But when I think of it, rather than meet with censure, there's here, too, another door to the back buildings of our house.
I'll go that way to market;
by that way I'll bring back the provisions-through the garden there's a passage that communicates with both houses.
(To the SLAVES.)
Do you follow me this way.
I surely will pull this day to bits2.
(Goes into the house of EPIGNOMUS.)GEL. (to himself).
I've consulted my books;
I'm as sure as possible, that by my funny bon mots I shall recover my patron3.
Now I'm going to see whether he has arrived by this from the harbour, that when he comes I may smooth him down with my speeches.
EPIG.
Surely, this is Gelasimus, the Parasite, that'a coming.
GEL. (to himself).
With lucky auspices, by my troth, this day did I come out of doors ;
since an omen auspiciously befel me4.
This was beheld by me;
how a weasel carried off a mouse close at my feet.
For as she found sustenance for herself this day, so do I hope that I shall do, as the augury predicts (Sees EPIGNOMUS.)
Surely this is Epignomus that's standing here;
I'll go and address him.
My dear Epignomus, how pleased I am to see you now;
how my tears are starting forth for very joy.
Have you all along enjoyed your health ?
EPIG.
With care it has been preserved.
GEL.
Right heartily I wish you health1.
EpIG.
You speak kindly, and like a friend.
May the Gods grant what you wish.
GEL. * * * EPIG.
I, sup there with you ?
GEL.
Since you are returned safe.
Epic.
Really, an engagement has been made already;
but I give you thanks.
GEL.
Do promise me.
Epic.
It's settled.
GEL.
But do, I say.
Epic.
The thing's agreed on.
GEL.
By my troth, you'd do it with much pleasure to me.
Epic.
I know that well.
When an opportunity shall come, it shall be so.
GEL.
Now, then, is the opportunity.
Epic.
I' faith, I cannot.
GEL.
Why make difficulties ?
Do consider;
I have I know not what luxuries at hand2.
Epic.
Do be off, now;
seek for yourself another guest for to-day.
GEL.
You promise, then ?
Epic.
I would make no diffi­ culty if I could.
GEL.
Really, on my word, one thing, for sure, I promise you, I'd entertain you with pleasure, beyond a doubt, if you would promise.
Epic. Adieu! (Moving.)
GEL.
Have you resolved PEpic.
I have resolved.
I shall dine at home.
GEL. (aside).
Since nothing has been effected this way, I'll therefore approach him by a more open path, and I'll speak plainly out.
(To EPIGNOMUS.)
Since you, yourself, are not willing to promise to come to me, should you like that I should come to dine with you ?
Epic.
If it were possible, I should like it;
but here are nine other people3 coming to dine at my house.
GEL.
For my part, I don't ask that I should recline ON the couch;
you know that I'm a man for the lower seats.
EPIG.
But these are deputies of a people, tip-top men;
they come here as public ambassadors from Ambracial.
GEL.
Let then the deputies of a people, your tip-top men, recline at the tip-top place;
I, the lowest, in the lowest quarter.
EPIG.
It isn't proper for you to be entertained among deputies.
GEL.
I 'faith, and I—I'm a deputy, too2, but little it does avail me.
EPIG.
I intend that to-morrow we shall dine upon the scraps.
Sincerely, farewell.
(Goes into his house)GEL.
By my troth, 'tis clear that I'm undone, and by no fault of my owns.
The number is less than it was before by one Gelasimus.
I'm resolved, hereafter, never to believe in a weasel, for I know of no beast more uncertain than her.
She who herself is ten times a day shifting her place, from her have I taken my omens in matters of life and death to me!
I'm determined to call my friends together, to take counsel how by rule I must starve henceforth.
(Exit.ANT.
So may the Gods favour me, and preserve for me my daughters, it is a pleasure to me, Pamphilus, that I see you both return home to your native land, your business prosper­ ously managed, yourself and your brother.
PAM.
I should have heard enough from you, Antipho, did I not see that you are friendly to me;
now, since I've found that you are my friend, I'll give you credence.
ANT.
I would invite you to my house to dinner, had not your brother told me that you were going to dine at his house to-day, when he invited myself to his house to dinner.
And it would have been more proper for me to give you an entertainment on your arrival, than to engage myself to him, were it not that I didn't wish to disoblige him.
Now I don't wish with words alone to insinuate myself into your favour;
to-morrow you shall be at my house, both you and he, with your wives.
PAM.
Then, the day after, at my house ;
for it was yester­ day he invited me for to-day.
But am I quite reconciled to you, Antipho ?ANT.
Since you have thus thrived in your affairs, as it behoves yourselves and persons friendly disposed to wish, let there be good-will and intercourse between us.
Take you care to think of this;
according as wealth is obtained by each man, so does he experience his friends.
If his fortunes are flourish­ ing, so are his friends true;
if his prospects decline, so, too, do his friends decline.
Fortune finds friends.
EPIG. (to himself).
I'm now returned.
'Tis a great delight, if you have been long from home, when you return home again, if no anxieties come in contact with your feelings.
But, in my absence, so well has my wife taken care of my private affairs, that she has made me free and unembarrassed by anxieties.
But, see, here's my brother Pamphilus, walk­ ing with his father-in-law.
PAM.
How fares it, Epignomus P Epic.
How with you?
How long since you came into harbour ?
PAM.
Not very long ago.
EPIG. (aside).
And is it since then that he has become on smooth terms with you ?ANT. (overhearing).
More smooth than the sea, on which you have both been borne.
Epic.
You do as you are wont to do other things.
Do we unlade the ship to-day, brother ?
PAM.
I would rather go quietly to work.
Let's rather lade ourselves with delights in their turn.
How soon will the dinner be cooked ?
I haven't breakfasted to-day.
EPIG.
Go in-doors to my house and bathe.
PAM.
I'll only step home to my own house, to salute the Gods1 and my wife.
If I do that as I wish, I'll forthwith return to your house.
EPIG.
But your wife -is hastening to come here with her sister.
PAM.
'Tis very good ;
there will then be the less delay on that account.
I shall be at your house2 this instant.
ANT. (to PAMPHILUS).
Before you go away, in your pre­ sence I wish to relate a single story to him.
EPIG.
By all means.
ANT.
There was once an old gentle­ man, just as I now am;
he had two daughters, such as mine now are;
they were married to two brothers, just as mine now are to yourselves.
PAM.
I wonder how the story'is to turn out ?
ANT.
One of these young men had, as you (to PAMPHILUS) now have, a damsel, a music-girl;
he had brought her from abroad, as you have now done.
Now, this old gentleman was a widower, just as I now am.
PAM.
Do proceed ;
this story is really a propos.
ANT.
Then said this old gentleman to him to whom the music-girl belonged, just as I now say to youPAM.
I'm listening3, and carefully giving heed.
ANT. "
I gave you my daughter, to be a comfortable bed- fellow for you;
now, I think it fair that one should be given me in return by you, to be my bed-fellow."
PAM.
Who says that ?
Does he say it1 just as though you were to say it ?
ANT.
Just as I now say it to you. “ Aye, I'll give you two of them," says this young man, "if one's too little;
and if you are not satisfied with two," says he, " two more shall be added."
PAM.
Prithee, who says that ?
Does he say it just as though I were to say it ?
ANT.
He says it just as though you were to say it.
Then says this old gentleman, just as though I were to say it, “ Well, give me four, if you like, so long only as, i' faith, you find them something to eat as well, that they mayn't consume my victuals."
PAM.
Why surely it must have been a stingy old chap to say that, in asking food as well of him who promised them to him.
ANT.
Why surely, this young man must have been a good-for-nothing fellow, who forthwith, when the other asked him, refused to give him a grain of wheat.
But, i' troth, the old gentleman asked what was fair, inasmuch as the dowry which he had given to his daughter, he wished him to have as an equivalent for the music-girl.
PAM.
I' faith, for sure I really do think that the young man was well advised, who wouldn't give a mistress to that old fellow in return for the dower..
ANT.
The old gentleman wished, indeed, if he could, to bargain for their maintenance ;
because he couldn't, he said he wished it to be done on what terms it might.
" Done," said this young man. " You do me a kindness," said the old gentleman. "
Have I the thing agreed upon ?" said he. " I'll do even as you wish it to be done," said the other.
But I'll be off in-doors, and congratulate my daughters on your arrival.
Then I'll go wash me at the bath:
!;
there will I take all care of my old age;
after that, when I've bathed, lying down, I'll await you at my leisure.
(Exit.PAAT.
A funny mortal, Antipho;
how cleverly he did make up his story.
Even yet the rogue considers himself a young man.
A mistress shall be given to the fellow, to sing to the old chap at night in bed;
for, 'i' faith, indeed, I know not of what other use a mistress can be to him.
But how fares our Parasite, Gelasimus ?
Is he well, too ?
EPIG.
I' faith, I saw the fellow not so very long ago.
PAM.
How fares he ?
EPIG.
Like one half-starved.
PAM.
Why didn't you invite the fellow to your house to dinner ?
Epic.
That on my arrival I mightn't be wasting anything
But see, here's the wolf in the Fable1;
here he is in person with his ravenous fit.
PAM.
We'll have some sport with the fellow.
Epic.
You put me in mind of a plan I had already re­ solved on.
GEL. (to the AUDIENCE).
But as I had begun to tell you;
while I have been absent hence, I've now been consulting with my friends and with my relatives.
They have been my advisers to the effect that I should this very day kill myself with starvation.
But don't I see Pamphilus with his brother Epignomus?
Yes, 'tis he.
I'll accost the man.
(Goes up to PAMPRILUS.) 0 longed-for Pamphilus!
0 my salvation!
0 my life !
0 in delight!
right welcome.
I rejoice that you've returned safe from abroad to your native land.
Welcome.
PAM.
Welcome, Gelasimus.
GEL.
Have you been quite well?
PAM.
I have taken good care of my health.
GEL.
I' troth, I'm glad of it.
I' faith, I confoundedly wish I had now a thousand measures of silver.
EPIG.
What need have you of it ?
GEL.
I' faith, that I might invite him to dinner, and not invite you.
EPIG.
You are talking against your own interest.
GEL.
This, then, that I might invite you both * * * * * * for my part * * * ** I should not avoid1 * * * * * * there is nothing so * as this * * * *EPIG.
Troth, now, I'd ask you with pleasure, if there were room left.
GEL.
Well, standing, then, I'll gobble down a bit in the scramble.
EPIG.
No, only this one thing can be done.
GEL.
What?
EPIG.
When the guests have gone, that then you may comeGEL.
Hurra!
capital!
EPIG.
To wash the pots, I mean;
not to dinner.
GEL.
The Gods confound you!
What say you, Pamphilus ?
PAM.
I' troth, this day I'm engaged to dine elsewhere abroad.
GEL.
How, abroad ?
PAM.
Really abroad, on my word.
GEL.
How the plague do you like, thus wearied, to be supping abroad ?
PAM.
Which do you advise me?
GEL.
Order a dinner to be cooked at home, and word to be sent to him who invited you.
PAM.
Shall I dine at home, alone ?
GEL.
Why, not alone;
invite me.
PAM.
But I'm afraid lest he should scold me, who has been to this expense for my sake.
GEL.
It may easily be excused-only listen to me;
do order a dinner to be cooked at home.
EPIG.
Not by my advice, indeed, will he act so as to dis­ appoint that person this day.
GEL.
Will you not be off from here ?
Perhaps you sup­ pose that I don't see what you're about.
Do you look to yourself, please.
(To PAMPHILUS.)
How that fellow is gaping after your property just like a hungry wolf.
Don't you know how men are set upon here in the street at night ?
PAM.
SO many the more servants will I bid to come and fetch me, that they may protect me.
Epic.
He won't stir-he won't stir;
because you persuade him so earnestly not to go out.
GEL.
Do order a dinner to be cooked at home with all speed for me and for yourself and your wife.
Troth, if you do so, I don't think you'll say that you are deceived.
PAM.
So far as that dinner is concerned, Gelasimus, you may be dinnerless to-day.
GEL.
Are you going abroad to dine ?
PAM.
I'm going to dine at my brother's, hard by.
GEL.
Is that fixed ?
PAM.
Fixed.
GEL.
By my troth, I hope you may be struck with a stone this day.
PAM.
I'm not afraid;
I shall go through the garden;
I'll not go abroad.
Epic.
What say you to that, Gelasimus ?
GEL.
You're entertaining your deputies;
keep them to yourself.
Epic.
Why, faith, 'tis your own business.
GEL.
If, indeed, 'tis my own business, avail yourself of my assistance;
invite me.
EPIG.
By my faith, I see, as I fancy, one place still for yourself only, where you may recline.
PAM.
Really, I do think it may be managed.
GEL.
0 light of the city !
EPIG.
If you can manage to re­ cline in a small compass.
GEL.
Aye, even between two wedges!
of iron.
As little space as a puppy can lie in, the same will be enough for me.
EPIG.
I'll beg for it some way or other;
come along.
(Pulls him along.) .GEL.
What?
This way?
Epic.
Yes, to prison.
For here, indeed, you'll not find any further entertainment2.
Let's be off, you Pamphilus.
PAM.
I'll but salute the Gods:
then I'll pass through to your house forthwith.
GEL.
What then?
EPIG.
Why, I said that you might go to prison.
GEL.
Well, if you order it, I'll go there even.
EPIG.
Immortal Gods!
really, by my troth, this fellow might be induced by a dinner or a breakfast to bear extreme torture.
GEL.
Such is my nature;
with anything can I struggle much more easily than with hunger.
EPIG.
I know it:
at my house full long enough has this facility of yours been experienced by me * * * * * * while you were the Parasite of myself and my brother, we ruined our fortunes.
Now I don't wish you to be made by me from a Gelasimus into a Catagelasi­ musl.
(EPIGNOMUS and PAMPHILUS go into their houses.)GEL.
And are you gone now?
Surely he is gone.
Now have I need of a wise resolution.
Both are gone;
consider, Gelasimus, what plan you must adopt.
* * * * What, I? Yes, you.
What, for myself ?
Yes, for yourself.
Don't you see how dear provisions are ?
Don't you see how the kindness and the heartiness of men have vanished?
Don't you see how drolls are set at nought, and how they themselves are sponged upon ?
By my troth, not a person shall ever behold me alive on the morrow;
for, this instant, in-doors will I load my throat with a bulrush dose2.
And by this I shall not give cause for men to say that I died of hunger.
(Exit.STICH.
Foolishly and unwisely is it done in my opinion, if people are in the habit, if they are expecting a person, of looking out for him;
faith, he doesn't on that account come a bit the faster.
I'm now doing that same thing, in looking out for Sagarinus;
who, still, for that reason won't come a jot the faster.
Troth, I shall just now be taking my place alone, if he doesn't come here.
I'll now fetch that cask of wine hither from home, and then I'll take my place.
The day, like snow, is melting away apace.
(Goes into the house of EPIGLOMUS.)SAG.
Hail!
Athens, thou nurse of Greece;
country of my master, hail!
How joyously do I behold thee.
But I have a wish to see how my mistress and fellow-servant, Stephanium, is faring.
For I bade Stichus to give her my regards, and to tell her that I should come to-day, so that she might cook a dinner in good time.
But, surely, here's Stichus.STICH. (to himself).
A clever thing you did, master, when you presented your servant, Stichus, with this gift.
0 ye immortal Gods!
how many delights do I carry, how many smiles, how many jokes, how many a kiss, dancing, dalliance, and good-fellowship.
SAG..
Stichus, how fare you ?
STICH.
Right well, Saga­ rinus, most delightfully;
I'm bringing Dionysus1, as my guest and yours.
For, i' faith, the dinner's cooked;
free range has been given me and you at your house.
For at our house there's an entertainment;
your master's dining there with his wife, and Antipho as well;
there, too, is my master.
This was given me as a present.
(Points to the cask.)SAG.
How ?
Are you dreaming ?
STICH.
I' faith, I'm telling you the truth.
SAG.
Who then gave you this ?
STICH.
What matters that to you?
I wish us this day to wash away everything of foreign climes.
Leave them alone;
let's now attend to Athens;
follow me.
Do you at once make haste, and bathe.
SAG.
I have bathed.
STICH.
Very good;
follow me, then, this way in-doors, Sagarinus.
SAG.
Of course, I follow.
By my troth, this beginning pleases me as I return home;
a happy omen and augury1 has met me in my path.
(They go into the house of PAMPHILUS.)STEPII. (to the AUDIENCE).
I wish that it may ap­ pear wondrous to no one of you, Spectators, why I who live there (pointing to the house of PAMPHILUS) am come out hither from this other house:
I'll inform you thereon.
Just now was I sent for to this house by the back way.
For as soon as news was brought that the husbands of these ladies were about to come, we all hurried thither.
We attended to laying the couches, and setting all in order.
Still, amid these duties, I had a care for my friends, Stichus and my fellow-servant Sagarinus, that their dinner should be cooked.
Stichus has been caterer;
but for cooking it, I've appointed one my deputy.
Now, I'll be off hence, and attend to my friends, who, I see, are coming here.
(Goes into the house Of PAMPHILUS.)SAG.
Come, out of doors with you;
lead on the proces­ sion2.
Stichus,
I appoint you commander of the cask.
I'm resolved to prove our banquet in every fashion this day.
So may the Gods love me, we are well entertained in being feasted in this place.
I will that each person that passes by shall be invited to join the banquet.
STICH.
Agreed, so long only as, i' faith, each man comes with his own wine3 ;
for of this, a mouthful shall be given to no person but ourselves, this day.
Eating alone1, let's wait upon ourselves.
SAG.
This banquet, for our means, is quite sufficient, with its nuts, beans, figs2, a dish of olives, pounded lupines, and a cake.
STICH.
It better becomes a man who is a slave to bring his expenses within moderation than beyond.
Each one to his own station;
they, who have wealth at home, drink from cups, goblets, and bowls;
we, if we are now drinking from our Samian jugS, still build our walls according to our means.
SAG.
But while she who is your mistress and mine is arranging her hair, and bedecking herself, I wish us to have some diversion among ourselves.
I appoint you the com­ mander4 of this feast.
STICH.
Very aptly does it suggest itself to your mind.
SAG.
Wouldn't we be more suitably entertained like Cynics5 on benches here, than upon couches ?
STICH.
Aye, but this is far the most pleasant.
SAG.
On which side is each of us to recline by our mis tress ?
STICH.
Of course you go to the upper place.
And, so that you may understand it, I make a division with you on these terms :
consider, and take which province you would even like now to take.
(They take their places.)SAG
But what's your meaning about this "province?"STICK.
Whether you would choose to hold the command over the water or over Bacchus.
SAG.
Over Bacchus, most distinctly.
But, in the mean­ time, general of ours, why stands this goblet here?
See how many cups1 we have drunk.
STICH.
As many as there are fingers on your hand.
The Greek song is, " Drink either your five cups 2 or your three, but not your four."SAG. (about to drink).
I pledge you.
Do you take for yourself the tenth part from the fountain3, if you are wise.
Here's luck to you, luck to us;
here's luck to thee, luck to me;
luck to our Stephanium as well.
STICH.
'Tis bravely done.
I pledge you in a goblet.
(Drinks.)SAG.
Keep your wine;
I'd very much like something by way of a relish4.
STICH.
If you are not satisfied with what's here, there's nothing else.
Take some water5.
SAO.
You say right;
I care for no dainties.
Drink away, Piperl;
drink, if you do drink.
I' faith, this must be drunk—don't shirk it.
(Holds the goblet to the PIPER.)
Why flinch at what you see must be done by you ?
Why don't you drink ?
Do it, if you are to do it.
Take it, I tell you, for the public pays for this.
That's not your way to shirk your drink.
Take your pipes2 out of your mouth.
(The PIPER drinks.)
STICK.
When he has drunk, either do you mind my rules3, or else I'll give up.
I don't wish us to drink this straight out;
we shall soon be about nothing4;
for, by my faith, almost all in a moment, the cask might be turned head downwards 5.SAG. (to the PIPER).
How now ?
Although you did make a fuss about it, still it didn't hurt you.
Come, Piper, when you've done drinking, put back your pipes to your lips;
quickly puff out your cheeks, just like a reptile serpent6.
Come now, Stichus, whichever of the two breaks order, shall be fined a cup.
STICH.
You propose a good regulation.
You ought to have your way, who only ask what Is fair.
SAG.
Mind it then;
if you offend, I'll forthwith take the forfeit on the spot.
STICH.
You ask what's quite right and just.
SAG. (pledging STICHUS).
Here's to you first of all.
STICH.
'Tis a droll thing this, for two persons, rivals of each other, to be courting, to be drinking from one goblet, and to be kissing one wench.
'Tis worthy of remark this:
I am you, you are I;
of one accord are we.
With one mistress are we both in love;
when she's with me, still she's with you ;
and when she's with you, she's with me as well;
neither of us envies the other.
SAG.
Come, come, there's enough of it;
I don't want it overdone to weariness.
I'd now like some other sport.
STICH.
Drink on, if you are drinking.
SAG.
There shall be no skulking in me.
But, troth, I've had enough of the feast;
would but our mistress come here.
If she were here, nothing else would be away.
STICH.
Should you like us to invite our mistress out ?
She shall give us a dance.
SAG.
I agree.
STICH. (calling aloud).
My sweet one, my lovely one, my pleasing one, Stephanium, do come out of doors to your sweethearts;
to me you are quite charming.
SAG.
But to me, indeed, most charming.
STICH.
Make us jovial fellows more jovial by your assist­ ance and your company.
Returning from abroad, we want you, dear little Stephanium, my honey, that is, if our loving­ ness is pleasing to you, if we are acceptable to you.
STEPH.
I'll indulge you, my dears;
but, so may pretty Venus favour me, I should have already come out of door here together with you, had I not been sprucing myself up for you.
For such is the way of woman, when she is well washed, made clean, dressed and tricked out, still is she incomplete;
and a female who is a courtesan much more quickly acquires dislike for herself by sluttishness than always keeps in lavour through neatness.
STICH.
That's very cleverly said.
SAG.
'Tis the genuine] language of Venus.
STICH.
Sagarinus.
SAG.
What's the matter ?
STICH.
I'm in pain all over.
SAG.
All over?
So much the more unfortunate you.
STEPH.
Where do I take my place ?
SAG.
Wherever you please.
STEPH.
I'd like with both of you, for I love you both.
STICH.
Whack go my savings1.
I'm done for;
freedom has abandoned this person of mine.
STEPH.
Prithee, do give me room, where I may take my place, if, indeed, I am agreable.
(She takes her place.)
Now I do long to be cozy with you both.
STICH.
I'm ruined utterly.
What were you saying ?
SAG.
Heyday!
What'a the matter?
STICH.
So may the Gods favour me, it never shall be otherwise this day but that this girl shall have a dance somehow.
Come, my love, my sweet, do dance ;
I'll dance too.
(They rise and dance.)SAG.
I' faith, you shan't that way get the better of me, but what I'll have a bit of enjoyment, too, that way.
STEPH.
Well, if I must dance, do you then give the Piper something to drink.
STICH.
Aye, and to me.
SAG. (holds the goblet to the PIPER).
Piper, you take first:
and after that, if you tipple this off, just as has been your wont before to-day, straight­ way strike up some merry and amorous tune to dance to, by which we may tingle all over from our very finger nails.
Pour some water here.
Take this, you ;
toss it off.
The drink didn't please him just now;
now at last he takes it with less difficulty.
Take it, you.
To STEPHANIUM.)
In the mean­ time, apple of my eye, give me a kiss while he's drinking.
STErn.
Why, it's the way of a common strumpet, for a damsel to give a kiss standing to her sweetheart as he stands.
(She turns away, while he tries to kiss her.)STICH.
Bravo !
bravo!
that's the way it's given to a thief2.
SAG.
Come, blow out your cheeks now;
something in the amorous way1 at once.
Give us a new tune in return for the old wine.
What person in the Ionian2 or the ballet line is there that can do anything like that ?
(He capers about.)STICH.
If you get the better of me this turn3,just challenge me to another.
SAG.
Just you do it in this fashion.
(Capers.)STICK.
And you in this fashion.
(Capers too.)
SAG.
0 grand4!
STICH.
Quiet5!
SAG.
Now, then, both in the same step.
(They dance quietly, in the same measure.)
I challenge all the dancing-masters to dance against me.
'Tis no more pos­ sible for there to be enough of this for us than for there to be too much rain for a mushroom.
STICH. (ceasing to dance).
Let's away hence in-doors at once now;
we've danced long enough for the wine6.
You, Spectators, give us your applause, and then go home to enjoy yourselves.
Sum, an old gentleman of Athens.

Scene.
—Athens.
The house of BALLIO IS on one side of the Street tui SIMO on the other.
CALIDORUS, a young Athenian, the son of Simo, is in love with Phœnicium, a young woman who belongs to Ballio, a procurer.
A bargain has been made by the procurer, to sell her to a military officer for twenty minæ;
fifteen of these have been paid down, and it has been agreed that when the remaining five and a certain token, with a letter, shall have been sent by the Captain, the damsel shall be sent to him in return.
Pseudolus, the servant of Simo, promises his master's son, that, if possible, he will prevent this.
They first address Ballio on the subject;
but their attempts to influence him are all in vain.
Pseudolus then devises a plan to get some money out of Simo, by whom, however, it is dis­ covered;
but, after having acknowledged his fault, he prevails upon the old gentleman to promise him twenty minse if he shall contrive to get the girl out of the procurer's hands.
Harpax, the messenger from the Captain, in the meantime makes his appearance.
Being a stranger to the place, he un­ wittingly delivers the Captain's letter and the token to Pseudolus, who pretends that he is the head-servant of the procurer.
Charinus, the friend of Calidorus, iends him five minæ;
and, provided with this, Pseudolus equips Simmia, a servant of Charinus, so as to represent the messenger from the Captain.
He finds the procurer, delivers the letter, pays the five minse, and carries off the damsel.
Balho then makes a bet of twenty minæ with Simo, that Pseudolus shall not outwit him that day.
The real Harpax now applies to Ballio for the girl, and the trick being discovered, the procurer has to pay back the fifteen minæ to the Captain, and the twenty for the bet which he has made with Simo.
Simo then pays the twenty minæ, which he has promised to Pseudolus if he should suc­ ceed in outwitting the procurer.
Pseudolus is handsomely entertained by Calidorus, and engages to return to Simo one-half of the money, if he wil join the entertainment.
AN officer pays down fifteen minæ, ready money (Prœsentes);
as a token he also (Simul) gives an impression of his seal, that the procurer may deliver Phænicium to him (Ei), who brings it with the rest of the money.
Pseudolus intercepts his camp-servant coming (Venientem) with the token, saying (Dicens), that he is Syrus, the servant of Ballio, and thus he gives his aid (Opem) to his master;
for the procurer (Leno) delivers up the damsel to Simmia, whom he has substituted.
The real Harpax comes (Venit);
the matter is all discovered, and the old man (Senex) pays the money which he has agreed to give.
ATTEND to me this day;
good things I bring upon the stage;
for I think 'tis very just that to the good good things should be brought;
as likewise bad things to the bad;
that those who are bad may have what's bad, those who are good what's good;
bad men are bad because they hate the good;
because the good contemn the bad, needs must be that they are good;
and therefore, you are good since you have ever abhorred the bad ;
and both by your laws, Quirites, and by your legions, have you routed them with good success.
In like manner now do you give your goodly attention to this goodly company, which is a good one, and to good people brings this day good things.
Ears, eyes, and understanding, shall be amply filled.
He that comes hungry or thirsty to the theatre, the same shall carefully give his attention both through laughter and a sharpened stomach ;
while those who are full will laugh, the hungry will be carping.
Now, if you are wise, you hungry ones, give place, and go away;
you who are full, stand—aye, sit you down, and give attention.
I shall not now divulge the plot, nor yet the name of this play—Pseudolus will fully do that.
I imagine then and I think that this is enough which I have said to you.
Where mirth, jokes, laughter, wine, and jollity, are the order of the day, the Graces, too, and propriety, joyousness, and delight;
ne who seeks for other things, that person appears to seek for evil.
Away, then, with evil cares, as being men at your ease this day.
'Tis better for your loins to be stretched1, and for you to arise.
A long play of Plautus is coming upon the stage.
PSEUD.
If, master, by your being silent, I could be in­ formed what miseries are afflicting you so sadly, I would willingly have spared the trouble of two persons-of myself in asking you, and of yourself in answering me.
Since, however, that cannot be, necessity compels me to enquire of you.
Answer me:
What's the reason that, out of spirits for these many days past, you've been carrying a letter about with you, washing it with your tears, and making no person the sharer of your purpose ?
Speak out, that what I am ignorant of, I may know together with yourself.
CAL.
I am wretchedly miserable, Pseudolus.
PSEUD.
May Jupiter forbid it!
CAL.
This belongs not at all to the arbitration of Jupiter;
under the sway of Venus2 am I harassed, not under that of Jove.
PSEUD.
Is it allowable for me to know what it is ?
For hitherto you have had me as chief confidant in your plans.
CAL.
The same is now my intention.
PSEUD.
Let me know then what's the matter with you.
I'll aid you either with resources, or with my efforts, or with good counsel.
CAL.
Do you take this letter:
do you thence inform yourself what misery and what care are wasting me away.
PSEUD. (taking the letter).
Compliance shall be given you.
But, prithee, how's this ?
CAL.
What's the matter?
PSEUD.
As I think, these letters are very loving;
they are climbing on each other's backs.
CAL.
Are you making sport of me with your foolery ?
PSEUD.
I' faith, I really do believe that unless the Sibyll can read them, nobody else can possibly interpret them.
CAL.
Why speak you unkindly of those sweet letters- sweet tablets too, written upon by a hand as sweet.
PSEUD.
Troth now, have hens, prithee, such hands?
For certainly a hen has written these letters.
CAL.
You are annoying me.
Either read it or return the letter.
PSEUD.
Very well then, I'll read it through.
Give me your attention.
CAL.
That's not here.
PSEUD.
Do you summon it then.
CAL.
Well, I'll be silent;
do you summon it from that wax there;
.!;
for there my attention is at present, not in my breast.
PSEUD.
I see your mistress, Calidorus.
CAL.
Where is she, prithee ?
PSEUD.
See, here she is at full length in the letter;
she's lying upon the wax.
CAL.
Now, may the Gods and Goddesses, inasmuch3PSEUD.
Preserve me from harm, to wit.
CAL.
For a short season have I been like a summer plant1;
suddenly have I sprung up, suddenly have I withered.
PSEUD.
Be silent, while I read the letter through.
CAL.
Why don't you read it then ?
PSEUD, (reading).
" Phœnicium to her lover, Calidorus, by means of wax and string and letters, her exponents, sends health, and safety does she beg2 of you, weeping, and with palpitating feelings, heart, and breast."CAL.
I'm undone;
I nowhere find, Pseudolus, this safety for me to send her back.
PSEUD.
What safety?
CAL.
A silver one.
PSEUD.
And do you wish to send her back a silver safety for one on wood3 ?
Consider what you're about.
CAL.
Read on now;
I'll soon cause you to know from the letter how suddenly there's need for me for one of silver to be found.
PSEUD. (reading on).
"The procurer has sold me, my love, for twenty minæ, to a Macedonian officer from abroad..
Be­ fore he departed hence, the Captain paid him fifteen minæ;
only five minæ now are remaining unpaid.
On that account the Captain left here a token-his own likeness impressed on wax by his ring-that he who should bring hither a token like to that, together with him the procurer might send me.
The next day hence, on the Festival of Bacchus4, is the one fixed for this matter."CAL.
Well, that's to-morrow;
my ruin is near at hand, unless I have some help in you.
PSEUD.
Let me read it through.
CAL.
I permit you ;
for I seem to myself to be talking to her.
Read on;
the sweet and the bitter are you now mingling together for me.
PSEUD. (reading on). "
Now our loves, our tenderness, our intimacy, our mirth, our dalliance, our talking, our sweet kisses, the close embrace of us lovers equally fond, the soft, dear kisses impressed on our tender lips, the delicious pressing of the swelling bosom ;
of all these delights, I say, for me and for you as well, the severance, the destruction, and the downfal is at hand, unless there is some rescue for me in you or for you in me.
I have taken care that you should know all these things that I have written;
now shall I make trial how far you love me, and how far you pretend to do so.
"CAL.
'Tis written, Pseudolus, in wretchedness.
PSEUD.
Alas!
very wretchedly 1. CAL.
Why don't you weep, then ?
PSEUD.
I've eyes of pumice stone2;
I can't prevail upon them to squeeze out one tear even.
CAL.
Why so?
PSEUD.
My family was always a dry­ eyed one.
CAL.
Won't you attempt to assist me at all ?
PSEUD.
What shall I do for you ?
CAL.
Alas!
PSEUD.
Alas!
do you say ?
Well, don't be sparing of them, i' faith;
I'll give you plenty.
CAL.
I'm distracted.
I nowhere can find any money to borrow.
PSEUD.
Alas!
CAL.
Nor is there a single coin in the house.
PSEUD.
Alas!
CAL.
He's going to carry th'e damsel away to-morrow.
PSEUD.
Alas!
CAL.
Is it in that fashion that you help me?
PSEUD.
I give you that which I have;
for I've a per­ petual supply of those treasures3 in my house.
CAL.
It's all over with me this very day.
But can you now lend me one drachma, which I'll pay you back to-mor­ row ?
PSEUD.
I' faith, I hardly think I could, even though 1 should pawn myself for it.
But what do you want to do with this drachma ?
CAL.
I want to purchase a halter for myself.
PSEUD.
For what reason ?
CAL.
With which to hang my­ self.
I'm determined, ere 'tis dark, to take1 a leap in the dark.
PSEUD.
Who then shall pay me back my drachma * * * * ?
Do you wish purposely to hang yourself for the very reason, that you may cheat me out of my drachma if I lend it you ?
CAL.
At all events, I can in nowise survive if she'a re­ moved and carried off from me.
PSEUD.
Why do you weep, you cuckoo2 ?
You shall survive.
CAL.
Why should I not weep, who have neither a coin of silver in ready money, nor have the hope of a groat3 any­ where in the world ?
PSEUD.
As I understand the tenor of this letter, unless you weep for her with tears of silver, the affection which you wish yourself by those tears to prove is of no more value than if you were to pour water into a sieve.
But have no fear, I'll not forsake you in your love.
In troth, I do trust that this day, from some quarter or other, by my good aid I shall find you help in the money line.
But whence that is to come,-that whence I know not how to pronounce;
ex­ cept only that so it shall be;
my eyebrow twitches1 to that effect.
CAL.
As to what you say, I trust that your deeds may be as good as your words.
PSEUD.
I' faith, you surely know, if I set my plans a-going2, after what fashion and how great is the bustle that I am in the habit of causing.
CAL.
In you are now centred all the hopes of my ex­ istence.
PSEUD.
Is it enough, if I this day make this damsel to be yours, or if I find you twenty minæ ?
CAL.
'Tis enough, if so it is to be.
PSEUD.
Ask of me twenty minæ, that you may be assured that I'll procure for you that which I have promised.
Ask them of me, by my troth, prithee do;
I long to make the promise.
CAL.
Will you this day find me twenty minæ of silver ?
PSEUD.
I will find them;
be no more troublesome to me then.
And this I tell you first, that you mayn't deny that it was told you;
if I can no one else, I'll diddle your father out of the money.
CAL.
So far asfilial affection is concerned, even my mother as well.
May the Gods always preserve you for me.
But what if you are not able ?
PSEUD.
Upon that matter do you go to sleep with either eye.
CAL.
With the eye or with the ear3 ?
PSEUD.
The latter is too common an expression.
Now, that no one may affirm that it wasn't told him, I tell you all (to the AUDIENCE), in the presence of the youths in this audience, and of all the people, to all my friends and all my acquaintances I give notice, that for this day they must guard against me, and not trust me.
CAL.
Hist!
be silent, prithee, by all the powers!
PSEUD.
What's the matter P CAL.
There was a noise at the procurer's door.
PSEUD.
I could only wish it were his legs in preference.
CAL.
Yes, and he himself is coming out from in-doors, the perjured scoundrel.
(They stand at a distance.)BAL.
Get out, come, out with you, you rascals, kept at a loss and bought at a loss, in the minds of not one of whom aught ever comes to do aright, of whom I can't make a bit of use, unless I try it after this fashion.
(He flogs the men all round.)
At no time did I ever see human beings more like asses;
so hardened are your ribs with stripes;
when you flog them, you hurt yourself the most.
Of such a disposition are these whipping-posts who follow this line of conduct;
when the opportunity is given, pilfer, purloin2, prig, plunder, drink, eat, and run away's the word.
This is their method, so that you would choose rather to leave wolves among sheep, than these fellows on guard in your house.
Yet, when you look at their appearance, they don't seem amiss;
by their doings they deceive you.
Now, therefore, unless you all of you give your attention to this charge, unless you remove drowsiness and sloth from your breasts and eyes, I'll make your sides to be right thoroughly marked with thongs, so much so that not even Campanian coverlets are coloured as well, nor yet Alexandrian tapestry3 of purple embroidered with beasts all over.
Even yesterday I already gave you all notice, and assigned to each his own respective employment;
but so utterly worthless are you, so neglectful, of such stub­ born dispositions, that you compel me to put you in mind of your duty with a basting.
You are so minded.
I suppose, to get the better of this scourge and myself through the hard­ ness of your hides.
Never, i' faith, will your hides prove harder, than is this cow-hide of mine.
(He dangles it before them.)
Do look at that, please;
they are minding other matters.
Attend to this, and give heed to this.
(Heflogs one of them.)
How now ?
Does it pain ?
Ah, that's the way it's laid on when any slave slights his master.
Stand all of you before me, you race of mortals born to be thrashed;
turn your ears this way;
give attention all of you to what I say.
You fellow who are holding the pitcher, do you fetch the water;
do you take care that the cauldron's full this instant.
You, with the axe, I appoint over the wood-cutting department.
SLAVE.
But this one is blunted on the edge.
BAL.
Let it be so, then.
And so are you yourselves with stripes;
yet am I for that reason any the less to enjoy your services ?
My orders I give to you, that the house be made clean.
You have what you are to do;
make haste, and go in-doors.
(-Exit FIRST SLAVE.)
Be you the one that makes the couches smooth 1.
Do you wash the plate clean, and ar­ range it in order as well.
Take care that when I return from the Forum, I find things done;
that all be swept, sprinkled, scoured, made smooth, cleaned, and arranged in order.
For this day is my birthday;
it befits you all to celebrate it.
Take care to lay the gammon of bacon, the brawn, the collared neck, and the udder, in water;
do you hear me ?
I wish to entertain tip-top men in first-rate style, that they may.
fancy that I have property.
Go you in-doors, and get these things ready quickly, that there may be no delay when the cook comes.
I'm going to market, that I may make purchase of whatever fish is there.
Boy, go you before me;
I must have a care that no one cuts away my purse.
Or wait there;
there's something that I bad almost forgotten to say at home.
Do you hear me, you women ?
I have this charge for you—you, misses of distinction, who spend your time with illustrious men in refinements, luxury, and elights;
now shall I know and make trial this day, which one has regard for her liberty1, which for her appetite which thinks on her business, which on sleeping only:
this day I'll make trial which I must think of as a freed-woman, and which as one to be sold.
Take you care that many a present from your lovers comes in for me this day;
for if your year's board isn't picked up for me, to-morrow I'll turn you adrift on the public.
You know that this is my birthday ;
where are those youths, the apples of whose eyes you are, whose very existence, whose delight you are?
Where are your kisses, where your bosoms sweet as honey ?
Make the bearers of presents to come here then, for my sake, before this house, in whole regiments2.
Why am I to find clothes for you, gold trinkets, and those things which you need?
What have I, you jades, through your means, except vexation, you women, eager for nothing but the wine ?
You are a-soaking away yourselves and your paunches too, at the very time that l'in here a-dry.
Now, therefore, this is the best thing to do;
for me to call you each by her name, that no one of you may be declaring to me by-and-by that her business hasn't been told her.
Give attention, all of you.
In the first place, Hedylium, my business is with you—you, who are the favorite of the corn-merchants, men who have, all of them, immense mountains of wheat piled up at home;
take you care that wheat is brought here for me, to suffice this year to come for myself and all my household, and that I may so abound in corn that the city may change my name for me, and instead of the procurer Balio proclaim me King Iasion3.
CAL. (apart).
Do you hear what the gallows-bird is saying?
* * * Doesn't he seem a regular boaster to you ?
PSEUD, (apart).
I' troth the fellow does, and a wicked one1 as well.
But hush now, and give attention to this.
BAL.
Æschrodora, you who have for your patrons the outchers, those rivals of the procurers, who, just like our­ selves, by false oaths seek their gains, do you listen ;
unless the three larders shall be crammed for me this day with car­ cases of ample weight, to-morrow, just as they say that for­ merly the two sons of Jupiter fastened Dirce2 to the bull, aye, this day as well, will I tie you up to the larder;
that, in fact, shall be your bull.
CAL. (apart).
I'm quite enraged by the talk of this fellow;
that we should suffer the youth of Attica to encourage heres this fellow!
Where are they-where are they skulking, they of mature age, who have their amorous dealings with this procurer ?
Why don't they meet ?
Why don't they one aud all deliver the public from this pestilence ?
But I am very simple, and very ignorant;
they would venture, of course, to do that to those, to whom their passions compel them, to their misfortune, to be subservient, and, at the same time, prevent them from doing that against them which they would rather wish to do.
PSEUD, (apart).
Hush! CAL. (apart).
What's the matter ?
PSEUD, (apart).
Pshaw!
you are not very obliging.
Why are you drowning his talk4 by your noise ?CAL. (apart).
I'll be silent.
PSEUD, (apart).
But I'a much rather you would be silent, than that you should say you will be silent.
BAL.
And you, Xystilis, take you care and give me your attention-you whose fanciers have large quantities of oil at home.
If oil shall not be brought me here forthwith in leathern bags, I'll to-morrow cause yourself to be carried off in a leathern bag to the prostitutes' shambles1.
There a bed shall be given you, I warrant, where you can have no rest, but where, even to downright fainting You understand what's the tendency of that which I'm saying ?
Will you tell me, you viper you, you who have so many of your fanciers so right well laden with their oil, is now the head of any one of your fellow-slaves a bit the better anointed by your means, or do I, myself, get my dainty morsels a bit the better seasoned with oil2 for it ?
But I understand-you don't care much about oil;
with wine you anoint yourself.
Only wait a bit;
by my troth I'll punish you for all at one spell, unless indeed this day you contrive to manage all these things that I've been speaking of.
But as for you, Phce­ nicium, I tell you this, you pet of the mighty men-you who have been for so long a time always paying down to me your money for your liberty-you who only know how to promise, but don't know how to pay what you have promised;
unless this day all your keep is brought me here out of the stores of your customers, to-morrow, Phœnicium, with a true Phœni­ cian hide3, you'll pay a visit to the strumpets' shambles.
(The SLAVES go into the house of BALLIO.)CAL.
Pseudolus, don't you hear what he says ?
PSEUD.
I hear it, master, and I give good heed.
CAL.
What do you advise me to send him, that he mayn't devote my mistress to dishonor ?
PSEUD.
Don't you trouble yourself about that;
be of cheer- ful mind.
I'll manage for myself and for you.
For some time past I've been on terms of goodwill with him, and he with me;
and our friendship is of old standing.
I'll send him this day, on his birthday, a mischief heavy and well-matured.
CAL.
What's the plan ?
PSEUD.
Can't you attend to something else ?
CAL.
But PSEUD.
Tut.CAL.
I'm distracted.
PSEUD.
Harden your heart.
CAL.
I cannot.
PSEUD.
Make yourself to can.
CAL.
By what means, pray, can I prevail upon my feel­ ings PPSEUD.
Carry you out that which is to your advantage, rather than give heed with your feelings to the thing that's disadvantageous.
CAL.
That's nonsense;
there is no pleasure, unless a lover acts like a fool.
PSEUD.
Do you persist ?
CAL;
0 my dear Pseudolus, let me be undone-do let me, please.
PSEUD.
I'll let you;
only let me go.
(Going.)CAL.
Stay, stay.
As you shall, then, wish me to be, so will I be.
PSEUD.
Now, at last, you are in your senses.
BAL.
(coming forward from the door of his house to the other side of the stage).
The day is passing;
I'm causing delay to myself.
Boy, do you go before me.
(Moves as if going.)CAL.
Hallo there!
he's going;
why don't you call him back?
PSEUD.
Why in such a hurry P Gently.
CAL.
But before he's gone.
jBAL.
Why the plague do you go so slowly, boy ?
PSEUD.
You born on this day, hallo!
you born on this day ;
I'm calling to you;
hallo!
you born on this day, come you back and look at us.
Although you are busy, we want you ;
stop-it's because some persons want to speak to you.
BAL.
What's this ?
Who is it, when I'm busy, causes me unseasonable delay?
PSEUD.
He that has been your supporter.
BAL.
He's dead that has been;
only he that is, is note alive.
PSEUD.
You are too saucy.
BAL.
You are too trouble some.
(Turns away to go on.)CAL.
Seize the fellow;
follow him up.
BAL.
Go on, boy.
PSEUD.
Let's go and meet him this way.
(They run and stand before him.)BAL.
May Jupiter confound you, whoever you are.
PSEUD.
That for yourself I wish.
BAL.
And for both ofyou do 1.
Turn you this way, boy.
(Takes another direction.)
PSEUD.
May we not speak with you ?
BAL.
Why, it doesn't please me.
PSEUD.
But if it's something to your advantage ?
BAL.
Am I allowed to go away, pray, or am I not ?
PSEUD.
Pshaw !
Stop. (Catches hold ofhim.)
BAL.
Let me go.
CAL.
Ballio, listen.
BAL.
I'm deaf.
CAL.
Really, you are uncivil.
BAL.
You are a chatterer of nonsense.
CAL.
I gave you money so long as I had it.
BAL.
I'm not asking what you gave.
CAL.
I'll give you some when I have it.
BAL.
When you have it, bring it to mel.
CAL.
Alas, alas!
In what a foolish fashion have I lavished what I brought to you, and what I gave you.
BAL.
Your wealth defunct, you now are talking about it;
you are a simpleton, a cause that has been tried you are trying over again.
PSEUD.
At least consider him, who he is.
BAL.
I've known for a long time now who he was;
who he now is, let him know himself.
Do you walk on (to the Boy).
PSEUD.
And can't you, Ballio, only once give a look this way for your own profit ?
BAL.
At that price I'll give a look;
for if I were sacri­ ficing to supreme Jupiter, and were presenting:
!
the entrails in my hands to lay them on the altar, if in the meanwhile any- thing in the way of profit were offered, I should in preference forsake the sacrifice.
There's no being able to resist that sort of piety, however other things go.
PSEUD, (aside).
The very Gods, whom it is especially our duty to reverence-them he esteems of little value.
BAL.
I'll speak to him.
Hail to you, right heartily, the very vilest slave in Athens.
PSEUD.
May the Gods and Goddesses favour you, Baltic, both at his wish and at my own;
or, if you are deserving of other terms, let them neither favour nor bless you.
BAL.
What's the matter, Calidorus ?CAL.
Love and pinching want1 are the matter.
BAL.
I would pity you, if, upon pity I could support my establishment.
PSEUD.
Aye, aye, we know you quite well, what sort of character you are;
don't be proclaiming it.
But do you know what we want ?
BAD.
I' faith, I know it pretty nearly;
that there may be something unfortunate for me.
PSEUD.
Both to that and this for which we called you back, prithee do give your attention.
BAL.
I am attending;
but compress into a few words what you want, as I'm busy now.
PSEUD.
He (pointing to CALIDORUS) is quite ashamed about what he promised you, and the day for which he pro­ mised it, that he hasn't even yet paid you those twenty minæ for his mistress.
BAL.
That which we are ashamed at is much more easily endured than that which we are vexed at.
At not having paid the money, he is ashamed;
I, because I have not received it, am vexed.
PSEUD.
Still, he'll pay it, he'll procure it;
do you only wait some days to come.
But he has been afraid of this, that you'll sell her on account of his embarrassment.
BAL.
He had an opportunity, had he wished, of paying the money long ago.
CAL.
What if I had it not ?
BAL.
If you had been in love, you would have found it on loan.
Yov would have gone to the usurer1;
you would have paid the interest;
or else you would have pilfered it from your father.
PSEUD.
Ought he to have pilfered it from his father, you most shameless villain ?
There is no fear that you'll point out to him anything that's right.
BAL.
That's not like a procurer.
CAL.
And could I pos­ sibly pilfer anything from my father, an old man so much on his guard ?
And besides, if I could do so, filial affection forbids.
BAL.
I understand you;
do you then at night embrace filial affection in place of Phœnicium.
But since I see you prefer your filial affection to your love-are all men your fathers ?
Is there no one for you to ask to lend you some money ?
CAL.
Why, the very name of lending's dead and gone by this.
PSEUD.
Look you now;
since, i' faith2, those fellows arose from the banker's table, with a filled skin, who, when they called in their own, paid what they had borrowed to no born creature, since then, I say, all people have been more cautious not to trust another.
CAL.
Most wretched am I;
nowhere am I able to find a coin of silver;
so distractedly am I perishing both through love and want of money.
BAL.
Buy oil on credit3, and sell it for ready money;
then, i' faith, even two hundred minæ ready money might be raised.
CAL.
There I'm done;
the twenty-five year old law4 founders me.
All are afraid to trust me.
BAL.
The same law1 have I. I'm afraid to trust you.
PSEUD.
To trust him, indeed!
How now, do you repent of the great profit he has been to you ?
BAL.
No lover is a profitable one, except him who keeps continually making presents.
Either let him be always giving, or when he has nothing, let him at the same time cease to be in love.
CAL.
And don't you pity me at all ?
BAL.
You come empty-handed;
words don't chink.
But I wish you life and health.
PSEUD.
Heyday!
Is he dead already ?
BAL.
However he is, to me indeed, at all events, with these speeches, he is dead.
Then, does a lover really live, when he comes begging to a procurer ?
Do you always come to me with a complaint that brings2 its money.
As for that, which you are now lamenting about, that you have got no money, complain of it to your stepmother3.
PSEUD.
Why, have you ever been married to his father, pray ?
BAL.
May the Gods grant better things.
PSEUD.
Do what we ask you, Baltic, on my credit, if you are afraid to trust him.
Within the next three days, from some quarter, in some way, either by land or sea, I'll rout up this money for you.
BAL.
I, trust you ?
PSEUD.
Why not ?
BAL.
Because, i' faith, on the same principle that I trust you, on that principle I should tie a run-away dog to a lamb's fry.
CAL.
Is the obligation thus ungratefully returned by you to me, who have deserved so well of you ?
BAL.
What do you want now ?
CAL.
That you will only wait these six days of the Feast, and will not sell her .or prove the death of the person who loves her.
BAL.
Be of good courage;
I'll wait six months even.
CAL.
Capital-most delightful man!
BAL.
Aye;
and do you wish, too, that from joyful ] should make you even more joyous ?
CAL.
How so ?
BAL.
Why, because I've got no Phœ­ nicium to sell.
CAL.
Not got her ?
BAL.
I' faith, not I, indeed.
CAL.
Pseudolus, go fetch the sacrifice, the victims, the sacrificersl, that I may make offering to this supreme Jove.
For this Jupiter is now much more mighty to me than is Jupiter himself.
BAL.
I want no victims;
with the entrails of minæ2 I wish to be appeased.
CAL. (to PSEUDOLUS).
Make haste.
Why do you hesitate ?
Go fetch the lambs;
do you hear what Jupiter says ?
PSEUD.
I'll be here this moment;
but first I must run as far as beyond the gate3.
CAL.
Why thither?
PSEUD.
I'll fetch tw6 sacrificers thence, with their bells;
at the same time I'll fetch thence two bundles of elm twigs, that this day a sufficiency may be provided for the sacrifice to this Jove.
BAL.
Away to utter perdition4.
PSEUD.
Thither shall the pimping Jupiter go.BAL.
It isn't for your interest that I should die.
PSEUD.
How so ?
BAL.
This way ;
because, if I'm dead, there will be no one worse than yourself in Athens.
For your interest (to CALIDORUS) it is that I should die.
CAL.
HOW so ?
BAL.
I'll tell you;
because, i' faith, so long as I shall be alive, you'll never be a man well to do.
CAL.
Troth now, prithee, in serious truth, tell me this that I ask you—have you not got my mistress, Phcenicium, on sale?
BAL.
By my faith, I really have not;
for I've now sold her already.
CAL.
In what way ?
BAL.
Without her trappings, with all her in wards1.
CAL.
What ?
Have you sold my mistress ?
BAL.
Decidedly;
for twenty minae.
CAL.
For twenty minæ ?
BAL.
Or, in other words, for four times five minæ, which­ ever you please, to a Macedonian Captain;
and I've already got fifteen of the minæ at home.
CAL.
What is it that I hear of you ?
BAL.
That your mistress has been turned into money.
CAL.
Why did you dare to do so ?
BAL.
'Twas my pleasure;
she was my own.
CAL.
Hallo!
Pseudolus.
Run, fetch me a sword.
PSEUD.
What need is there of a sword ?
CAL.
With which to kill this fellow this instant, and then myself.
PSEUD.
But why not kill yourself only rather ?
For famine will soon be killing him.
CAL.
What do you say, most perjured of men as many as are living upon the earth ?
Did you not take an oath that you would sell her to no person besides myself?
BAL.
I confess it.
CAL.
In solemn form2, to wit.
BAL.
Aye, and well considered too.
CAL.
You have proved perjured, you villain.
BAL.
I sacked the money at home, however.
Villain as I am, I am now able to draw upon a stock of silver in my house;
whereas you who are so dutiful, and born of that grand family, haven't a single coin.
CAL.
Pseudolus, stand by him on the other side and load this fellow with imprecations.
PSEUD.
Very well.
Never would I run to the Prætor1 with equal speed that I might be made free.
(Stands on the other side of BALLIO.)CAL.
Heap on him a multitude of curses.
PSEUD.
Now will I publish you with my rebukes.
Thou lackshame!
BAL.
'Tis the fact.
PSEUD.
Villain!
BAL.
You say the truth.
PSEUD.
Whipping-post!BAL.
Why not ?
PSEUD.
Robber of tombs!
BAL.
No doubt.
PSEUD.
Gallows-bird!BAL.
Very well done.
PSEUD.
Cheater of your friends!
BAL.
That's in my way.
PSEUD.
Parricide!BAL.
Proceed, you.
CAL.
Committer of sacrilege!
BAL.
I own it.
CAL.
Perjurer!
BAL.
You're telling nothing new2.
CAL.
Lawbreaker!BAL.
Very much so.
PSEUD.
Pest of youth!
BAL.
Most severely said.
CAL.
Thief!
BAL.
Oh!
wonderful!
PSEUD.
Vagabond!
BAL.
Pooh!
pooh3!
CAL.
Defrauder of the public!
BAL.
Most decidedly so.
PSEUD.
Cheating scoundrel!CAL.
Filthy pander!
PSEUD.
Lump of filth!
BAL.
A capital chorus.
CAL.
You beat your father and mother.
BAL.
Aye, and killed them, too, rather than find them food;
did I do wrong at all ?
PSEUD.
We are pouring our words into a pierced cask4:
we are losing our pains.
BAL.
Would you like to call me anything else besides ?
CAL.
Is there anything that shames you PBAL.
Yes ;
that you have been found to be a lover as empty as a rotten nut.
But although you have used towards me expressions many and harsh, unless the Captain shall bring me this day the five minæ that he owes me, as this was the last day appointed for the payment of that money, if he doesn't bring it, I think that I am able to do my duty.
CAL.
What is that duty ?
BAL.
If you bring the money, I'll break faith with him;
that's my duty.
If it were more worth my while, I would talk further with you.
But, with.
out a coin of money, 'tis in vain that you request me to have pity upon you.
Such is my determination;
but do you, from this, consider what you have henceforth to do ? (Moves.)CAL.
Are you going then ?
BAL.
At present I am full of business.
(Exit.PSEUD.
Before long you'll be more so.
That man is my own, unless all Gods and men forsake me.
I'll bone him just in the same fashion that a cook does a lamprey1.
Now, Calidorus, I wish you to give me your attention.
CAL.
What do you bid me do ?
PSEUD.
I wish to lay siege to this town, that this day it may be taken.
For that purpose, I have need of an artful, clever, knowing, and crafty fellow, who may despatch out of hand what he is ordered, not one to go to sleep upon his watch.
CAL.
Tell me, then, what you are going to do ?
PSEUD.
In good time I'll let you know.
I don't care for it to be repeated twice;
stories are made too long that way.
CAL.
You plead what's very fair and very just.
PSEUD.
Make haste;
bring the fellow hither quickly.
CAL.
Out of many, there are but few friends that are to be depended upon by a person.
PSEUD.
I know that;
therefore, get for yourself now a choice of both, and seek out of these many one that can be depended upon.
CAL.
I'll have him here this instant.
PSEUD.
Can't you be off then?
You create delay for yourself by your talking.
Exit CALIDORUS.PSEUD.
Since he has gone hence, you are now standing alone, Pseudolus.
What are you to do now, after you have so largely promised costly delights to your master's son by your speeches ?
You, for whom not even one drop of sure counsel is ready, nor yet of silver * # # # nor have you where first you must begin your undertaking, nor yet fixed limits for finishing off your web.
But just as the poet, when he has taken up his tablets, seeks what nowhere in the world exists, and still finds it, and makes that like truth which really is a fiction;
now I'll become a poet;
twenty minæ, which no­ where in the world are now existing, still will I find.
And some time since had I said that I would find them for him, and I had attempted to throw a net over our old gentleman;
how­ ever, by what means I know not, he perceived it beforehand.
But my voice and my talking must be stopped;
for, see! ] perceive my master, Simo, coming this way, together with his neighbour, Callipho.
Out of this old sepulchre will I dig twenty minæ this day, to give them to my master's son.
Now I'll step aside here, that I may pick up their conver­ sation.
(He stands apart.)SIMO.
If now a Dictator1 were to be appointed at Athens of Attica out of the spendthrifts or out of the gallants, I do think that no one would surpass my son.
For now the only talk of all throughout the city is to the effect that he is trying to set his mistress free, and is seeking after money for that purpose.
Some people bring me word of this ;
and, in fact, I had long ago perceived it, and had suspected it, but I dissembled on it.
PSEUD. (apart).
Already is his son suspected by him;
this affair is nipt in the bud, this business is at a stand-still.
The way is now entirely blocked up against me, by which I had intended to go a-foraging for the money.
He has perceived it beforehand.
There's no booty for the marauders.
CALL.
Those men who carry about and who listen to accu­ sations, should all be hanged, if so it could be at my decision, the carriers by their tongues, the listeners by their ears.
For these things that are told you, that your son in his amour is desirous to chouse you out of money, the chance is that these things so told you are all lies.
But suppose they are true, as habits are, now-a-days especially, what has he done so surprising ?
What new thing, if a young man does love, and if he does liberate his mistress ?
PSEUD, (apart).
A delightful old gentleman.
SIMO.
I don't wish him to follow the old-fashioned habits1.
CALL.
But still, in vain do you object;
or you yourself shouldn't have done the like in your youthful days.
It befits the father to be immaculate, who wishes his son to be more immaculate than he has been himself.
But the mis­ chief and the profligacy you were guilty of might have been distributed throughout the whole population, a share for each man.
Are you surprised at it, if the son does take after the father ?
PSEUD, (apart).
0 Zeus, Zeus2!
how few in number are you considerate men.
See, that's being a father to a son, just as is proper.
SIMO.
Who is it that's speaking here ?
(Looking round.)
Why, surely 'tis my servant Pseudolus.
'Tis he corrupts my son, the wicked scoundrel;
he is his leader, he his tutor.
I long for him to be put to extreme torture.
CALL.
This is folly now, thus to keep your anger in readiness.
How much better were it to accost him with kind words and to make all enquiries, whether these things are true or not that they tell you of ?
SIMO.
I'll take your advice.
PSEUD, (apart).
They are making towards you, Pseudolus;
prepare your speech to meet the old fellow..
Good courage in a bad case is half the evil got over.
(Aloud, as he advances to meet them.)
First, I salute my master, as is proper;
and after that, if any­ thing is left, that I bestow upon his neighbour.
SIMO.
Good day to you.
What are you about ?
PSEUD.
About standing here in this fashion (assuming an attitude).
SIMO.
See the attitude of the fellow, Callipho;
how like that of a man of rank.
CALL.
I consider that he is standing properly and with boldness.
PSEUD.
It befits a servant innocent and guileless, as he is, to be bold, most especially before his master.
CALL.
There are some things about which we wish to inquire of you, which we ourselves know and have heard of as though through a cloud of mist.
SIMO.
He'll manage you now with his speeches, so that you shall think it isn't Pseudolus but Socratesl that's talking to you.
What do you say ?
PSEUD.
For a long time you have held me in contempt, I know.
I see that you have but little confidence in me.
You wish me to be a villain ;
still, I will be of strict honesty.
SIMO.
Take care, please, and make the recesses of your ears free, Pseudolus, that my words may be enabled to enter where I desire.
PSEUD.
Come, say anything you please, although I am angry at you.
SIMO.
What, you, a slave, angry at me your master ?
PSEUD.
And does that seem wonderful to you ?
SIMO.
Why, by my troth, according to what you say, I must be on my guard against you in your anger, and you are thinking of beating me in no other way than I am wont to beat yourself.
What do you think ?
(To CALLIPHO.)CALL.
I' faith, I think that he's angry with good reason, since you have so little confidence in him.
SIMO.
I'll leave him alone then.
Let him be angry:
I'll take care that he shall do me no harm.
But what do you say ?
What as to that which I was asking you ?
PSEUD.
If you want anything, ask me.
What I know, do you consider given you as a response at Delphi.
SIMO.
Give your attention then, and take care and please mind your promise.
What do you say ?
Do you know that my son is in love with a certain music-girl ?
PSEUD.
Yea, verily1.
SIMO.
Whom he is trying to make free ?
PSEUD.
Yea, verily and indeed.
SIMO.
And you are scheming by cajolery and by cunning tricks to get twenty minæ in ready money out of me ?
PSEUD.
I, get them out of you ?
SIMO.
Just so;
to give them to my son, with which to liberate his mistress.
Do you confess it ?
Speak out.
PSEUD.
Yea, verily;
yea, verily.
SIMO.
He confesses it.
Didn't I tell you so just now, Callipho ?
CALL.
So I remember.
SIMO.
Why, directly you knew of these things, were they kept concealed from me?
Why wasn't I made acquainted with them ?
PSEUD.
I'll tell you:
because I was unwilling that a bad custom should originate in me, for a servant to accuse his master before his master.
SIMO.
Wouldn't you order this fellow to be dragged head first to the treadmill2 ?
CALL.
Has he done anything amiss, Simo ?
SIMO.
Yes, very much so.
PSEUD, (to CALLIPHO).
Be quiet, I quite well understand my own affairs, Callipho.
Is this a fault ?
Now then, give your attention to the reason why I you kept ignorant of this amour.
I knew that the treadmill was close at hand, if I told you.
SIMO.
And didn't you know, as well, that the treadmill would be close at hand when you kept silent on it ?
PSEUD.
I did know it.
SIMO.
Why wasn't it told me ?
PSEUD.
The one evil was close at hand, the other at a greater distance;
the one was at the moment, the other was a few days off.
SIMO.
What will you be doing now ?
For assuredly the money cannot be got in this quarter out of me, who have especially detected it.
I shall forthwith give notice to all that no one is to trust him the money.
PSEUD.
I' faith, I'll never go begging to any person, so long, at all events, as you shall be alive;
troth, you shall find me the money;
and as for me, I shall take it from you.
SIMO.
You, take it from me ?
PSEUD.
Undoubtedly.
SIMO.
Troth, now, knock out my eye, if I do find it.
PSEUD.
You shall provide it.
I warn you then to be on your guard against me.
SIMO.
By my troth, I know this for sure;
if you do take it away, you will have done a wonderful and a great exploit.
PSEUD.
I will do it, however.
SIMO.
But if you don't carry it off?
PSEUD.
Then flog me with rods.
But what if I do carry it off?
SIMO.
I give you Jupiter as your witness, that you shall pass your life free from punishment.
PSEUD.
Take care and remember that.
SIMO.
Could I possibly be unable to be on my guard, who am forewarned ?
PSEUD.
I forewarn you to be on your guard.
I say you must be on your guard, I tell you.
Keep watch.
Look, now, with those same hands will you this day give me the moneySIMO.
By my troth, 'tis a clever mortal if he keeps his word.
PSEUD.
Carry me away to be your slave if I don't do it.
SIMO.
You speak kindly and obligingly;
for at present you are not mine, I suppose.
PSEUD.
Would you like me to tell you, too, what you will still more wonder at ?
SIMO.
Come, then;
i' faith, I long to hear it;
I listen to you with pleasure.
PSEUD.
Before I fight that battle, I shall first fight another battle, famous and memorable.
SIMO.
What battle?
PSEUD.
Why, with the procurer, your neighbour;
by means of stratagem and artful tricks, I'll cleverly bamboozle the procurer out of this music-girl, with whom your son is so desperately in love;
and I surely will aave both of these things effected this very day, before the evening.
SIMO.
Well, if you accomplish these tasks as you say, you will surpass in might King Agathocles1.
But if you don't do it, is there any reason why I shouldn't forthwith put you in the treadmill ?
PSEUD.
Not for one day, but, i' faith, for all, whatever the time.
But if I effect it, will you not at once give me the money of your own free will for me to pay to the procurer ?
CALL.
Pseudolus is making a fair claim ;
say " I'll give it."SIMO.
But still, do you know what comes into my mind ?
Suppose they have made an arrangement, Callipho, among themselves, or are acting in concert, and on a preconcerted plan, to bamboozle me out of the money ?
PSEUD.
Who would be more audacious than myself, if I dared to do such an action ?
Well,
Simo, if we are thus in collusion, or have ever arranged any plan, do you mark me quite all over with elm-tree stripes2, just as when letters are written in a book with a reed.
SIMO.
Now then, proclaim the games as soon as you please.
PSEUD.
Give me your attention, Callipho, I beg you, for this day, so that you may not any way employ yourself upon other business.
CALL.
Why, now, I had made up my mind yesterday to go into the country.
PSEUD.
Still, do you now change the plan which you had resolved upon.
CALL.
I am now resolved not to go away on account of this ;
I have an inclination to be a spectator of your games, Pseudolus;
and if I shall find that he doesn't give you the money which he has promised, rather than it shouldn't be done, I'll give it.
SIMO.
I shall not change my purpose.
PSEUD.
Because, by my faith, if you don't give it, you shall be dunned for it with clamour great and plenteous.
Come, now, move yourselves off hence into the house this instant, and in turn give room for my tricks.
SIMO.
Be it so.
CALL.
You may have your way.
PSEUD.
But I want you to keep close at home.
SIMO.
Well, that assistance I promise you.
CALL.
But I shall be off to the Forum.
I'll be back here presently.
(Exit CALLIPHO.
SIMO goes into his house.)
PSEUD.
Be back directly.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
I have a suspicion, now, that you are suspecting that I have been pro­ mising these so great exploits to these persons for the pur­ pose of amusing you, while I am acting this play, and that I shall not do that which I said I will do.
I will not change my design ;
so far as that then I know for certain;
by what means I'm to carry it out not at all do I know as yet;
only this, that so it shall be.
For he that appears upon the stage in a new character, him it befits to bring something that is new.
If he cannot do that, let him give place to him who can.
I am inclined to go hence into the house for some little time, while I summon togetherl all my stratagems in my mind.
Meanwhile this piper shall entertain you.
(Goes into the house of SIMO, and the PIPER strikes up a tune.)PSEUD.
0 Jupiter, whatever I undertake, how cleverly and how fortunately does it befal me.
Not any plan is there stored up in my breast that I can hesitate upon or be afraid of.
But it is folly to entrust a bold exploit to a timorous heart;
for all things are just as you make them, so as you make them of importance.
Now in my breast have I already so prepared my forces-double, aye, threefold stratagems, that when I engage with the enemy, relying upon the merits, I say, of my forefathers, and on my own industry and tricking propensity for mischief, I may easily conquer, and easily spoil my antagonists by my contrivances.
Now will I adroitly batter down this Ballio1, the common foe of me and all of you;
only lend me your attention.
Now will I forthwith draw out my legions against this old town.
If I take it, I shall make it a- pleasant matter for the citizens:
I'll load and fill myself, and my allies as well, with booty from it.
I shall strike terror and fright into my enemies, so that they may know of what race I was born.
Great exploits it befits me to perform, which long after may bespeak fame for me.
But whom do I see here?
Who's this low fellow that's presented before my eyes?
I should like to know why he's come here with his sword:
I' troth, now then I'll lie here in ambush for him, to see the business that he's about.
(Retires to a distancedHAR.
This is the place, and this the spot, which was .
pointed out to me by my master, according as I form a judgment from my eyesight.
For my master, the Captain.
told me to this effect, that the house was the seventh from the gate, in which lives the person to whom he requested me to carry the token and this silver * * * * * I could vastly wish that some one would inform me where this Ballio, the procurer, lives.
(Looks from side to side.)PSEUD. (apart).
Hist!
Silence!
This man is mine, unless all Gods and men forsake me.
Now have I need of a new plan;
this new scheme is suddenly presented to me.
This I prefer to my former one;
that I shall dismiss, which, before, I had commenced to carry into effect.
By my troth, I'll then work this military messenger that's just arrived.
HAR.
I'll knock at the door, and call some one out of doors from within.
(Goes towards the door of BALLIO'S house.)PSEUD.
(coming up to him).
Whoever you are, I wish you to spare your knocking;
for I've just come out of doors, I, the spokesman and the defender of the door.
HAR.
Are you Ballio ?
PSEUD.
Why, no;
but I'm the deputy-Ballio1.
HAR.
What means that expression?
PSEUD.
I'm hIS butler-steward2 ;
the caterer for his larder.
HAR.
As though you were to say, you are his chamber­ lain3.
PSEUD.
No;
I'm above his chamberlain.
HAR.
What are you, slave or free man ?
PSEUD.
Why, at present, I'm still a slave.
HAR.
So you seem to be;
and you don't look to be one worthy to be free.
PSEUD.
Ain't you in the habit of looking at yourself when you abuse another person ?
HAR. (aside).
This must be a roguish fellow.
PSEUD. (aside).
The Gods protect and favour me!
for this is my anvil:
this day will I hammer out thence full many a device.
HAR.
Why is he talking to himself alone ?
PSEUD.
How say you, young man?
HAR.
What is it?
PSEUD.
Are you, or are you not, from that Captain of Macedonia ?
The servant of him, 1 mean, who bought a damsel of us here, who gave fifteen silver minæ to the procurer, my master, and is still owing five?
HAR, I am.
But where in the world have you ever known me, or have ever seen or spoken to me?
For in fact, before this day, I never was at Athens, nor did I ever before this day behold you with my eyesPSEUD.
Because you seem likely to be from him;
for at the time when he went away, this was the day appointed for the money, on which he was to pay it to us, and he has not brought it as yet.
HAB.
Yes, here it is.
(Holding up the bag.)PSEUD.
What ?—have you brought it PHAR.
I, myself.
PSEUD.
Do you at all hesitate to give it me PHAlt.
I, give it you ?
PSEUD.
Aye, faith, to me, who manage the business and the accounts of my master Ballio, receive his money, and pay it to him to whom he owes it.
HAR.
By my troth, if you were even the keeper of the treasures of supreme Jove, I would never entrust a groat of silver to you.
PSEUD, (pointing).
While you've been making yourself so big, the money has become loosedHAR.
I'll keep it the rather tied up — this way.
(Ties the mouth of the bag.) ,PSEUD.
Woe to you!
You indeed have been found to doubt my honor.
As though innumerable times as much are not in the habit of being entrusted to me alone.
HAR.
It's possible that others may think so, and that I mayn't trust you.
PSEUD.
As though you meant to say that I wished to chouse you out of the money.
HAlt.
Why, yes;
as though you meant to say so;
and as though I, on the other hand, meant to suspect it.
But what's your name ?
PSEUD. (aside).
This procurer has a servant of the name of Syrus;
I'll say that I am he.
I am Syrus.HAR.
Syrus P PSEUD.
That's my name.
HAR.
We are making many words.
If your master's at home, why don't you call him out, that I may transact that for which I was sent here, whatever be your name PPSEUD.
If he were within I would call him out.
But if you choose to give it me, it will be more truly paid than if you were to give it to himself.
HAR.
But now do you know how it is P My master has sent me to pay this, not to lose it.
But I know, to a cer­ tainty, that you are in a fever now, because you cannot lay your claws upon it.
I shall entrust the money to no person except to Ballio himself.
PSEUD.
But at present he's full of business:
a cause of his is being tried before the judge.
HAR.
May the Gods prosper it!
And I, when I shall think that he's at home, will come again.
Do you take this letter from me, and give it him:
for in it is the token agreed upon between your master and mine about the damsel.
PSEUD.
For my part, I understand it;
the person who should bring the money and the impress of his likeness hither to us, with him he said he wished the damsel to be sent;
for he left a specimen of it here as well.
HAR.
You understand the whole affair ?
PSEUD.
Why should I not understand it ?
HAR.
Give him this token then.
(Gives the letter and token.)
PSEUD.
Very well.
But what's your name ?
HAR.
Harpax.
PSEUD.
Get along with you, Harpax, I like you not.
By my troth, you really shan't enter this house, lest you should be doing something in the harpy line1.
HAR.
I am wont to carry off my enemies alive from the battle-field;
from that circumstance is my name.
PSEUD.
I' faith, I think that you are much more likely to carry off the brass pots from a house.
HAR.
Such is not the fact.
But, Syrus, do you know what I request of you ?
PSEUD.
I shall know, if you tell me.
HAR.
I shall put up outside of the gate here, at the third shop, at the house of that tun-bellied, limping, fat old woman, Chrysis.
PSEUD.
What do you wish then ?
HAR.
That you'll fetch me thence when your master comes.
PSEUD.
At your pleasure ;
by all means.
HAR.
For, as I've come wearied off my journey, I wish to refresh myself.
PSEUD.
You are very wise, and your plan is agreable to me.
But take care, please, that you are not out of the way when I send for you.
HAR.
Why, when I've dined, I shall indulge myself with a nap.
PSEUD.
I quite agree with you.
HAlt.
Do you wish aught else?
PSEUD.
That you'll be off to take your nap.
HAR.
I'm off.
PSEUD.
And, do you hear, Harpax ?
Order yourself to be covered up, please;
you'll receive the benefit if you take a good sweat.
(-EXit HARPAX.
PSEUD.
Immortal Gods!
this man has preserved me by his coming.
By his supply for my journey he has brought me from my wanderings quite into the right way.
For the Goddess Opportunity herself could not come to me more opportunely, than has this letter in this opportune manner been brought to me.
For this has been brought as a horn of plenty1, in which there is whatever I wish for:
here are my wiles, here all my tricks, here my stratagems, here my money, here his mis­ tress for my master's son so much in love.
And now how vaunting shall I show myself;
how, with a breast so fertile in expedients, I was to do each thing, how, to steal away the damsel from the procurer, I had all my plans arranged in order in my mind as I desired, fixed, planned out.
But, no doubt, thus will it come to pass :
this Goddess Fortune, unaided, prevails over the designs of a hundred armed men.
And this is the fact, just as each person uses his fortune, so does he surpass others, and forthwith we all pronounce him wise.
When we learn that the counsels of any person have turned out well, we declare that he is a prudent man;
but that he is a fool who is unsuccessful.
In our folly we know not how much we are mistaken, when we eagerly wish -any- thing to be given to us;
as though we ourselves could possibly know what is for our advantage.
We lose what is certain, whilo we are seeking what is uncertain.
And this comes to pass, amid labours and amid sorrow, that death meanwhile comes creeping on.
But there's enough now of philosophizing;
I have been talking too long, and at too great length.
Immortal Gods!
my lie was not dear at its weight in double-distilled gold, which I just now trumped up here on the spur of the moment, when I said that I belonged to the procurer.
Now, through this letter shall I deceive three persons—my master, and the procurer, and him who gave me this letter.
Excellent!
another thing as well has happened, that I wished for:
see, Calidorus is coming;
he is bringing some one with him, I know not whom.
(Stands apart.)CAL.
The sweets and the bitters, all have I disclosed to you.
You know my love, you know my difficulty, you know my poverty.
CITAR.
I well remember all;
do you only let me know what you want me to do.
CAL.
Pseudolus has directed me thus, that I should bring to him some bold and zealous person.
CHAR.
You observe your directions well;
for you bring him one both friendly and zealous.
But this Pseudolus' is a stranger to me.
CAL.
He is a very clever fellow—he is my contriver.
He said that he would effect those things for me that I have told you of.
PSEUD. (apart).
I'll address this person in a very lofty strain.
CAL.
Whose voice is it that's heard here?
PSEUD.
Oh!
thee, sovereign lord, thee, oh!
thee do I address who dost rule over Pseudolus:
thee do I seek, to impart to thee delights thrice three, threefold, acquired by three contrivances, obtained over three persons through craftiness and through subtlety, which in this very little sealed packet I have brought unto youl.
(Holds up the letter.)CAL.
That's the fellow;
how the hang-dog does bluster just like a tragedian.
PSEUD.
Advance a step on thy side towards me.
Boldly stretch forth thine arm for greeting.
CAL. (taking his hand).
Tell me, Pseudolus, whether, as Hope or as Safety, must I greet you ?
PSEUD.
Why both.
CAL.
As both I greet you.
But what has been done ?
Why are you silent ?
I have carried this person here.
(Pointing to CHARINUS.)PSEUD.
How ?
Carried him here ?
CAL.
Brought, I meant to say.
PSEUD.
Who's this person?
CAL.
Charinus.
PSEUD.
Well done;
I return him thanks1 then.
CHAR.
Will you then boldly enjoin me what it is neces­ sary to do ?
PSEUD.
My thanks, so far.
May it be well with you, Cha­ rinus;
I don't like that we should be troublesome to you.
CHAR.
You, troublesome to me ?
Now, really, that's troublesome.
PSEUD.
Well, then, wait a moment.
(Takes the letter out from under his dress.)CAL.
What's that ?
PSEUD.
This letter have I just now intercepted, and the token.
CAL.
Token ?
What token ?
PSEUD.
The one that was brought just now from the Captain.
His servant, who was bringing it, with five minæ of silver, who came to fetch your mistress hence, him I have just now bamboozled.
CAL.
HOW so ?
PSEUD.
For the sake of these Spectators the play is being performed;
they know, who were present here;
you I'll tell at another time.
CAL.
What are we to do then ?
PSEUD.
You shill this day embrace your mistress at liberty.
CAL.
What, I ?
PSEUD.
You yourself.
CAL.
I ?
PSEUD.
Your own self, I say, if indeed this head shall exist so long;
if you'll only quickly find me out a man.
CHAR.
Of what description ?
PSEUD.
A cunning, crafty, and clever one, who, when he has once taken hold of the beginning, may by his own ingenuity still hold fast upon what it behoves him to do;
one, too, who has not often been seen here.
CHAR.
If he is a slave, does that matter at all ?
PSEUD.
Why, I'd much rather have him than a free man.
CHAR.
I think that l'in able to procure for you a cunning and clever fellow, that has lately come to my father from Carystus1, and hasn't as yet gone anywhere out the house, and who never visited Athens before yesterday.
PSEUD.
You assist in right earnest.
But I have need to borrow five minæ of silver, which I shall repay this day, for his father (pointing to CALIDORUS) owes it me.
CHAR.
I'll lend it;
don't seek it anywhere else.
PSEUD. 0, how convenient a person for me.
I have need of a scarf as well, a sword, and a broad-brimmed hat.
CHAR.
I can provide them from my house.
PSEUD.
Im­ mortal Gods!
surely this is not Charinus for me, but Abun­ dance.
But this servant, who is come here from Carystus, is there anything in him ?
CHAR.
Plenty of the stinking goat2 in him.
PSEUD.
It befits the fellow, then, to have a tunic with long sleeves3.
Has the chap anything sharp4 in his breast ?
CHAR.
Aye, of the very sharpest.
PSEUD
But if it is necessary for him to draw forth what is sweet from the same place, has he aught of that?
CHAR.
Do you ask that ?
He has wine of myrrh, sweetj raisin wine, spice winel, honey wine, sweets of every sort.
Why, he once began to set up a hot liquor-shop in his breast.
PSEUD.
Bravissi o! Why, Charinus, you beat me cleverly2 at my own game.
But what am I to say is the name of this servant ?
CHAR.
Simmia.
PSEUD.
In a difficulty, does he under­ stand how to twirl about ?
CHAR.
A whirlwind3 is not so ready as he.
PSEUD.
Is he shrewd at all?
CHAR.
In mischievous tricks4 very often.
PSEUD.
How, when he's caught in the fact ?
CHAR.
He's a very eel;
he slips out.
PSEUD.
Is this fellow an experienced one ?
CHAR.
A public ordinance5 is not more experienced.
PSEUD.
He is a suitable person, according to what I hear you say.
CHAR.
Aye, and from this you may know it.
When he looks at you he'll tell, of his own accord, what it is you want with him.
But what are you about to do ?
PSEUD.
I'll tell you.
When I've dressed up my man, I intend to make him become the pretended servant of the Captain;
let him take this token to the procurer, with five minæ of silver.
There's the whole plot for you.
As for the rest, in what way he is to do each thing, I'll instruct himself.
CAL.
Why, therefore, do we stand here then?
PSEUD.
Bring the fellow to me just now, dressed out with all his accoutrements, to Æschinus, the banker's.
But make all haste.
CAL.
We'll be there before you.
PSEUD.
Get you gone there quickly.
(CALIDORUS and CHARINUS go into SIMO'S house.)
Whatever before was un­ certain or doubtful in my mind, is now clear-now fined to the dregs;
my heart has now an open path.
All my legions will I lead forth under their standards with happy omen1 with favorable auspices, and to my heart's content.
I have a certainty that I can rout my enemies.
Now will I go to the Forum, and load Simmia with my instructions what he is to do, that he may not be tripping at all, and that he may cleverly lay the train for this plot.
Soon now shall I cause the town of this procurer to be carried by storm.
Boy.
On that Boy on whom the Gods bestow servitude under a procurer, when they add a base occupation as well, assuredly do they, so far as I now understand in my mind, bestow upon him a great misfortune and miseries manifold.
Just as this servitude has turned out to me, where I am set over duties great and small;
nor am I able to find any I admirer to love me, so that at length I might be fitted out in a little better guise.
Now this day is the birthday of this procurer.
The procurer has made a determination, from the lowest to the highest, that if each one does not this day send him a present, he shall perish to-morrow with the greatest torments.
Now, faith, I know not what to do in my line, for, unless I shall send a present to the procurer this day, to-morrow must I swallow down fullers' produced j
And yet I cannot do that which they who can are wont to do.
Alas!
how little am I, even still for this vocation.
And by my troth, now, to my misfortune how fearfully do I dread punishment.
If any one lays on1 whose hand is too heavy, although they say that it generally is done amid great weep­ ing, I think that I am able in some measure to keep my teeth closed.
But I must keep close my lips and my talking, for see, my master is betaking himself home, and bringing a Cook with him.
(Stands at a distance.)BAL.
Those who call it the cook's market, call it so foolishly;
for 'tis not a cook's market, but a thieves' market.
For if, upon oath, I were to seek out the worst of men, I couldn't have brought a worse one than this fellow that l'in bringing, one, chattering, bragging, silly, and worthless.
Why, for this very reason Orcus has declined2 to take him to him­ self, that he might be here to cook a banquet for the dead;
for here he is able to cook a thing to please them alone.
COOK.
If you thought of me in this manner that you are mentioning, why did you hire me ?
BAL.
From scarcity;
there wasn't another.
But why, if you were a cook, were you sitting in the market-place, you alone behind the rest ?
COOK.
I'll tell you.
By reason of the avarice of men have I become an inferior cook, not through my own inclina­ tion.
BAL.
For what reason is that?
COOK.
I'll tell you.
Because, in fact, directly people come to hire a cook, no one enquires for him that's the best and the highest priced:
rather do they hire him that's the lowest priced.
Through this have I to-day been the only sitter in the market.
Those wretched fellows are for a drachma a-piece;
not any person is able to prevail on me to rise for less than a didrachm3.
I don't cook a dinner too, like other cooks, who bring me up seasoned meadows of grass upon their dishes;
who turn the guests into oxen, and supply the grass.
This herbage, too, do they further season with other herbs:
put in coriander, fennel, garlick, orage;
they add, too, sorrel, cabbage, beet, and spinach.
In this they dissolve a pound weight of asafœtida.
The roguish mustard is pounded, which makes the eyes of those that pound it drop tears before they have pounded it.
These fellows, when they cook dinners, when they do season them, season them, not with seasonings, but with vampyre owls1, which eat out the bowels of the guests while still alive.
Through this, in fact, it is, that people here live such short lives, inasmuch as they heap up these herbs of this sort in their stomachs, dreadful to be mentioned, not only to be eaten.
Herbage which the cattle eat not, men eat themselves.
BAL.
What do you say ?
Do you use divine seasonings, by which you can prolong the life of men, you, who find fault with these other seasonings ?
COOK.
I proclaim it boldly;
for those who shall eat of my victuals which I have seasoned will be able to exist two hun­ dred years even.
For when I've put into the saucepan either cicilendrum, or cepolindrum, or mace2, or saucaptis, the very dishes become warmed forthwith.
These are sauces forfish, the cattle of Neptune;
theflesh of the earthly cattle I season with cicimandrum, hapalopsis, or cataractria.
BAL.
Now may Jupiter and all the Divinities confound you with your sauces, and with all those lies of yours !
COOK.
Do allow me to speak, please.
BAL.
Speak, and I go to very perdition.
COOK.
When all the saucepans are hot, I open them al then does the odour fly towards heaven with its hand hanging downl.
BAL.
The odour with its hands hanging down ?
COOK.
I made a mistake without thinking.
BAL.
How SO ?
COOK.
With its feet hanging down, 1 meant to say.
Jupiter dines on that odour every day.
BAL.
If you happen not to go out to.
cook, pray what does Jupiter dine upon ?
COOK.
He goes to sleep without his dinner.
BAL.
Go to very perdition.
Is it for this reason that I'm to give you a didrachm to-day ?
COOK.
Well, I confess that I am a very high-priced cook ;
but I make the results of my labour to be seen for the price, hired at which I go out.
BAL.
In thieving, to wit.
COOK.
And do you expect to meet with any cook except with the claws of a kite or of an eagle PBAL.
And do you expect to go anywhere to cook, and not to cook the dinner there with your claws tied up ?
Now, therefore, you boy (to the Boy), who are my servant, I now give you notice to make haste to remove hence all my property;
and to keep his eyes as well in your sight.
Whichever way he shall look, do you look the same way as well.
If he shall move in any direction, do you move as well.
If he shall put forth his hand, put you forth your hand as well.
If he shall take anything of his own, do you suffer him to take it;
if he shall take what's mine, do you on the other side hold him fast.
If he shall stoop to the ground, do you stoop there as well.
Likewise over your understrappers I shall appoint a single guard a-piece.
COOK.
On.y have good courage.
BAL.
Prithee, tell me how I possibly can have good courage, who am taking you home to my house ?
COOK.
Because, by my broth, this day will I do just in the way that Medea cooked up the old man Pelias1, whom she is said by a draught and by her potions from an aged man to have made young again;
so will I make you likewise.
BAL.
How now;
are you an enchanter as well ?
COOK.
Why no, by my troth, I am rather a preserver2 of mankind.
BAL.
Well now;
for how much would you teach me that one point in cooking ?
COOK.
What point ?
BAL.
That I may preserve you from pilfering anything from me.
COOK.
For a didrachm, if you believe me ;
if not, not for a mina even.
But whether are you about to-day to give a dinner, to your friends or to your enemies ?
BAL.
Why, faith, to my friends surely.
COOK.
But why don't you invite your enemies to it rather than your friends ?
For this day will I present to the guests a banquet so savoury, and I'll season it with such a dulcet sweetness, that whoever shall taste each thing that's seasoned, I'll make that same person to gnaw off the ends of his own fingers.
BAL.
Troth now, prithee, before you shall present aught to the guests do you yourself first taste, and give some to your understrappers, that you may gnaw off the ends of your own pilfering hands.
COOK.
Perhaps then you don't believe me in the things that I say.
BAL.
Don't you be troublesome;
you din me too much;
you don't please me by it.
See, there I live.
(Points to his house.)
Do you go in-doors and cook the dinner, with all speed.
Box.
Why don't you go, and take your place ?
Go and find the guests ;
the dinner's spoiling already.
(COOK and Box go into the house.)BAL.
Now, just look, please, at that young offshoot;
for he, too, is a good-for-nothing deputy-scullion for the cook.
Truly I don't know what now first to be on my guard against;
such thieves there are in my house, and there's a robber close at hand.
For my neighbour here, the father of Cali­ dorus, a short time since, in the market-place, asked me by all means to be on my guard against his servant Pseu­ dolus, not to put any trust in him;
for that he is on the hunt this day, if possible to dupe me out of the woman.
He said that he had stoutly promised to him that he would get away Phoenicium from me by stratagem.
I'll now go in- doors and give notice to my household, that no one must put any trust whatever in this Pseudolus.
(Goes into his house.)PSEUD.
If the immortal Gods ever did determine that any person should be assisted by their aid, now do they intend that Calidorus.
shall be preserved for me, and the procurer destroyed, inasmuch as they produced you for my assistant, so clever and so knowing a fellow.
(Looking back.)
But where is he ?
am
I not a silly fellow to be thus talking to myself alone ?
I' faith, he has put a trick upon myself, as I fancy;
myself one knave, I have been poorly on my guard .against another knave.
By my troth I'm undone, if this fellow's off, and I shall not carry into effect this day what I intended.
But see, there he is, a statue that deserves a whip­ ping;
how stately he does stalk along!
PSEUD.
How now!
By my faith I was looking about for you ;
I was very greatly afraid that you were off.
SIM.
It was my character to do so, I confess.
PSEUD.
Where were you loitering ?
SIM.
Where I pleased.
PSEUD.
That I know well enough already.
SIM.
Why then do you ask me what you know ?
PSEUD.
Why this I want, to put you in mind.
SIM.
Needing to be put in mind yourself, don't you be putting me in mind.
PSEUD.
Really I am treated by you quite with contempt.
SIM.
And why shouldn't I treat you with contempt, I, who have the repute of being a military gentleman ?
PSEUD.
I want this then, which has been commenced, to be completed.
SIM.
Do you see me a-doing anything else ?
PSEUD.
Therefore walk on briskly.
SIM.
No, I choose to go slowly.
PSEUD.
This is the opportunity;
while this Harpax is asleep, I want you to be the first to accost him.
SIM.
Why are you hurrying ?
Softly ;
don't you fear.
I wish Jupiter would so make it, that he were openly in the same place with me, whoever he is, that has arrived from the Captain.
Never a jot, by my troth, should he be a bit the better Harpax than I.
Have good courage, I'll have this business nicely accounted for to you.
So by my tricks and lies would I put this military stranger in a fright that he himself would deny that he is the person that he is, and would believe me to be the person that he himself is.
PSEUD.
How can that be ?
SIM.
You are murdering me when you ask me that.
PSEUD.
A clever fellow.
SIM.
And so are you too, who are quite my equal with your mischievous tricks and liesPSEUD.
May Jupiter preserve you for me.
SIM.
Aye, and for myself.
But look, does this dress be­ come me quite well ?
PSEUD.
It suits very well.
SIM.
Be it so.
PSEUD.
May the Deities grant you as many blessings as you may wish for yourself.
For if I were to wish for as many as you are deserving of, they would be less than nothing;
(aside) nor have I ever seen any one more of a rogue than this fellow.
SIM. (overhearing him).
Do you say that to me ?
PSEUD.
This man's an honest fellow.
SIM.
It is neither this person, then (pointing to PSEUDO­ LUS), nor myself.
PSEUD.
But take care that you don't be tripping.
SIM.
Can't you hold your tongue ?
He that puts a man m mind of that which, remembering it, he does keep in mind, causes him to forget it.
I recollect everything;
they are stored up in my breast;
my plans are cleverly laid.
PSEUD.
I'm silent.
But what good turn shall I do you if you carry through this matter with management?
So may the Gods love meSIM.
They won't do so;
you'll be uttering sheer false­ hoods then.
PSEUD.
How I do love you, Simmia, for your roguery, and both fear and laud you.
SIM.
That I have learned to make a present of to others;
you can't put your flatteries on me.
PSEUD.
In how delightful a manner I shall receive you this day, when you have completed this matter.
SIM.
Ha, ha, ha! (Laughing.)PSEUD.
With nice viands, wine, perfumes, and titbits between our cups.
There, too, shall be a charming damsel, who shall give you kiss upon kiss.
SIM.
You will be receiving me in a delightful manner.
PSEUD.
Aye, and if you effect it, then I'll make you say so still more.
SIM.
If I don't effect it, do you, the executioner, take me off to torture.
But make haste and point out to me where is the door of the procurer's house.
PSEUD.
'Tis the third hence.
SIM.
Hist! hush !
the door's opening.
PSEUD.
In my mind, I believe that the house is poorly.
SIM.
Why so?
PSEUD.
Because, i' faith, it is vomiting forth the procurer.
(BALLIO is coming out of his house.)SIM.
Is this he ?
PSEUD.
This is his own self.
SIM.
'Tis a worthless commodity.
PSEUD.
Do see that:
he doesn't go straight, but sideways, just as a crab is wont.
(They conceal themselves from BALLIO.)BAL.
I do believe that this fellow is not so bad a cook as I thought he was;
for he has clawed off nothing as yet ex­ cept a cup and a tankard.
PSEUD. (apart to SIMMIA).
Hallo you!
now's your oppor­ tunity and your time.
SIM.
I agree with you.
PSEUD.
Step slily out into the street;
I'll be here in ambush.
(SIMMIA steps forward, and then walks along the middle of the street to meet BALLIO.)SIM. (talking aloud to himself).
I took the number care­ fully;
this is the sixth lane from the city gate;
down that lane he bade me turn;
how many houses down he told me, that I don't quite know for certain.
BAL. (eyeing SIMMIA).
Who's this fellow in the scarf, or whence does he come, or whom is he looking for ?
The appearance of the fellow seems outlandish and shabby.
SIM.
But see, here's a person, who, from uncertainty, will make the thing more certain for me that I wish to know.
BAL.
He's coming straight towards me.
Where in the world am I to say this fellow comes from ?
SIM.
Harkye!
you who are standing there with a goat's beard, answer me this that I ask you.
BAL.
How now!
Don't you salute me first ?
SIM. (with a surly voice).
I have no salutations to give away.
BAL.
Well, troth, you shall get just as much from here then.
PSEUD. (from behind).
Well done, at the very beginning.
SIM.
Do you know any person in this lane, I ask you ?
BAL.
I know myself.
SIM.
Few persons do that which you mention;
for in the Forum there is hardly every tenth person that knows his own self.
PSEUD. (from behind).
I'm all right;
he is philosophizing now.
SIM.
I'm looking for a fellow here, a bad one, a law­ breaker, an impious, perjured, and dishonest rogue.
BAL (aside).
He's looking for me, for those are my titles.
If he would only mention the name.
(To SIMMIA.)
What's the name of this person ?
SIM.
Ballio, the procurer.
BAL.
Do I know him ?
I am the very person, young man, that you are looking for.
SIM.
What, are you Ballio ?
BAL.
I really am he.
SIM.
How you are clothed, a housebreaker * * (He takes hold of BALLIO'S cloak.)BAL.
I think if you were to see me in the dark, you'd be keeping your hand off.
SIM.
My master bade me present you many greetings.
Receive this letter from me ;
he bade me give you it.
BAL.
Who's the person that bade you ?
PSEUD, (from behind).
I'm undone, now the fellow's in the middle of the mud.
He doesn't know the name­ this business is at a dead lock.
BAL.
Who do you say sent me this ?
SIM.
Observe the seal;
do you yourself tell me his name, that I may know that you are Baltic himself.
BAL.
Give me the letter.
SIM.
Take it, and look at the seal.
(Gives him the letter.)BAL.
(looking at it).
Oho!
'Tis nothing more nor less than Polymachæroplagides1, his own very self;
I recognize it.
Hallo you, Polymachæroplagides is his name!
SIM.
I know now that I have rightly given you the letter, since you have mentioned the name of Polymachæroplagides.
BAL.
How fares he ?
SIM.
By my troth, just as a brave man and a good soldier should.
But make haste, I beg, to read this letter through, for it is requisite to do so, and to take this money at once and send out the damsel.
For it's necessary for me this day to be at Sicyon2, or else to suffer death to-morrow;
so peremptory is my master.
BAL.
I know it:
you are telling those who know it already.
SIM.
Make haste then to read the letter through.
BAL.
I'll do so, if you'll only hold your tongue.
(He reads the letter.) "
The Captain Polymachæroplagides sends this letter, written to the procurer Ballio, sealed with the impression which was formerly agreed upon between us two."SIM.
The token's in the letter.
BAL.
I see the token and I recognize it.
But is he in the habit of sending no greeting written in his letter ?
SIM.
Such is the military etiquette, Ballio;
with their hand they send health to their well-wishers, and with the same do they send destruction to their evil-wishers.
But -is you have commenced, go on to ascertain of yourself what this letter says.
BAL.
Listen then.
(Reading on.) " Harpax is my camp- servant, who has come to you."
Are you this Harpax ?
SIM.
I am, and the real Harpax tool.
BAL. (reading on).
"Who brings this letter;
I wish the money to be received from him, and the woman to be sent together with him.
'Tis becoming to send greeting to the worthy;
had I deemed you worthy, I should have sent it to you."SIM.
What then ?
BAL.
Pay me the money, take away the woman.
SIM.
Which of us is delaying the matter ?
BAL.
Follow me in-doors then.
SIM.
I'm following.
(They go into BALLIO'S house.)
PSEUD.
I' troth, a more artful fellow, and one more skil­ fully cunning, I never did see than is this same Simmia.
Very much do I dread this man, and sadly do I fear that he may prove mischievous against myself just as he has been against him;
lest in his prosperity he may now turn his horns against me, if he finds an opportunity.
Should he prove mischievous towards me * * * * But, i' faith, for my part I hope not, for I wish well to him.
Now in three ways am I in the greatest dread.
First of all then, I dread this comrade of mine, lest he should forsake me and go over from me to the enemy.
Next do I dread that my master should in the meantime return from the Forum;
lest, the booty taken, the plunderers should be taken.
To­ gether with these things do I fear, lest that other Harpax should arrive here before this Harpax has departed hence with the woman.
By my faith, I'm undone;
they are very slow in coming out of doors.
With baggage packed1 up, my heart is waiting, ready, if he doesn't bring out the damsel together with himself, to fly away in exile out from of my breast.
* * * * * * (The door of BALLIO'S house opens.)
I'm the conqueror- I've got the better of my wary guards.
SIM. (to PHŒNlCIUM).
Don't weep :
you know not how the matter is, Phœnicium ;
but before long I'll let you know it when you are resting.
I'm not leading you to that Mace­ donian long-teethed fellow, who now causes you to be weep­ ing.
To him will I lead you, whose you especially long to be.
I'll cause you before very long to be embracing Calidorus.
PSEUD.
Prithee, why did you stay so long in-doors?
For how long a time was my heart throbbing with beating against my breast.
SIM.
You have found reason, you whipping-post, with a vengeance to be making enquires of me * * * * * * * amid the ambush of the enemy.
Why don't we go home with all speed with military strides2.
PSEUD.
Now, by my troth, although you are a worthless fellow, you advise aright.
March in triumphal procession, this way, straight in the path to the festive goblet.
(They march off in triumphal procession.)BAL.
Ha, ha, ha ! (laughing.)
Now, at last, my mind is in a state of ease, since that fellow has departed hence, and taken away the woman.
I should like Pseudolus now to come, that wicked rascal, to carry the woman off from me by his stratagems.
I know for sure, right well, that I had rather in solemn form perjure myself a thousand times, than that he should cheat me by making a laughing-stock of me.
By my troth now, I'll laugh at the fellow if I meet him.
But I guess that he'll soon be on the treadmill, just as befits him.
Now I wish for Simo that he would come in my way, in order that he might be joyful in common with my joy.
Sum (to himself).
I'm going to see what business my Ulysses has transacted;
whether he now has the statue1 from the Ballionian citadel.
BAL.
0, lucky man!
give me your lucky hand.
(Takes his hand.)SIMO.
What's the matter?
BAL.
Now.
Sum.
What now ?
BAL.
There's nothing at all for you to fear.
Sum.
What's the matter?
Has that fellow Pseudolus come to you ?
BAL.
No. Sum.
What good fortune is there, then ?
BAL.
Yonr twenty minæ are safe and sound which Pseu­ dolus stipulated for from you this day.
SIMO.
I' faith, I really do wish they were.
BAL.
Ask of me twenty minæ if he this day gets hold of that woman, or gives her to your son this day, as he has pro­ mised.
On my word, prithee, do demand them of me ;
I quite long to promise them.
And, besides this, keep the woman as a present for yourself, that in every way you may know that your money's safe.
SIMO.
There's no danger that I know of in making this bargain.
According as you have solemnly pledged your word, will you give me twenty minæ ?
BAL.
They shall be given.
SIMO.
This, indeed, is not so badly done.
But have you met the fellow ?
BAL.
Aye, both of them together.
SIMO.
What did he say ?
What did he talk about?
Prithee, what did he mention to you ?
BAL.
Theatrical nonsense;
expressions which, in comedies, are wont to be used to a procurer, which boys are ac­ quainted with.
He said that I was worthless, and wicked, and forsworn.
SIMO.
I' faith, he told no lie.
BAL.
'Twas for that reason I wasn't angry.
For what matters it for you to speak uncivilly to him who cares not for it, and who don't deny the truth of what you say?
SIMO.
Why is it that you are in no fear of him ?
That I'm longing to hear.
BAL.
Because he never will carry the woman off now, nor is he able.
Don't you yourself remember that I told you, some time since, that she had been sold to a Macedonian officer ?
SIMO.
I remember.
BAL.
Well, his servant just now brought me the money, and the token with the impression, which had been arranged between himself and me.
SIMO.
What then?
BAL.
He took away with him the woman, not long since.
SIMO.
Do you say this in real truth ?
BAL.
Whence could I possibly have that quality?
SIMO.
Do you only take care that he hasn't been playing some trick there.
BAL.
The letter and the impress on the seal make me sure.
Indeed, 'twas but just now he took her off for Sicyon.
SIMO.
Troth now, 'twas well done.
Why do I delay to make Pseudolus give a name1 to a colony at the mill-stones ?
But who's this fellow in the scarf?
BAL.
I don't know, i' faith;
however, let's observe whither he's going, and what business he's upon.
(They stand on one side.)HAR. (to himself).
That slave's a base and worthless fellow, who values his master's commands at nought;
and he, too, is good for nothing who is forgetful to do his duty unless he's put in mind.
But those who forthwith deem them­ selves to be at liberty, when they have hidden themselves from the sight of their master, who riot, wench, devour what they have,—aye, what they have not,-long- do those same endure the name of servitude.
Nor is there any good disposition in them, except only that they may uphold themselves by their dishonest contrivances.
With these, neither their company nor their conversation suits me, nor by these persons have I been ever known.
Although he is away, I consider my master as being here;
I fear him when he isn't here, that I may not have to fear him when he is here.
Therefore, as I have been ordered, to this business will I give my attention.
But that Syrus, to whom I gave the token, would have been letting me stay even yet in the shop.
As he bade me, I stayed there;
he said that he would send for me when the procurer was at home.
But since he hasn't come, or called me while staying there, I'm come hither of my own accord, that I may know what is the fact, that that fellow mayn't be playing tricks with me.
And there is nothing better than that I should knock at this door, and call some out here from in- doors.
I want this procurer to take this money of me, and to send off this woman with me.
(Goes towards BALLIO'S door.)BAL. (from behind, to SIMO).
Hark you!
SuMO. (apart).
What do you want ?BAL. (apart).
This fellow's my own.
Sum. (apart).
How so ?BAL.
(apart, pointing to the purse in the hand of HARPAX).
Because that booty's mine.
He's in search of a mistress he has got money.
I already long to fix my teeth in him.
SIMO. (apart).
Are you going to devour him already ?
BAL. (apart).
While he's fresh, while he's in the habit of giving away, while he's warm upon it, 'tis proper for him to be gobbled up.
The good men keep me poor, the bad ones support me;
the virtuous are a benefit to the public, the debauched to myself.
Sum. (aside).
A mischief may the Gods send you;
such a villain are you.
BAL. (apart).
Venus bestows upon me these blessings, when she drives hither these biters of money, these who quite long for losses, who carefully pamper themselves and their youthful age, eat, drink, and wench.
Of quite dif­ ferent dispositions are they and you.
HAR. (to himself).
I'm now delaying myself, in not knocking at this door.
that I may know whether or u Ballio is at home now.
(Calls out, going up to the door.)
Hallo!
where are you?
Hallo!
where are you?
BAL. (apart).
Why, he's going straight up towards my house.
I shall come off finely loaded with plunder from this fellow ;
I know it's a lucky omen for me.
HAR.
(knocking violently at the door).
Does any one come to open this door ?
BAL.
(calling out to him).
Hallo!
you in the scarf, what's owing you at that house ?
HAR.
I'm enquiring for Ballio, the procurer, the master of the house.
BAL.
Whoever you are, young man, make short work of your enquiries.
HAR.
Why so ?
BAL.
Because he himself in person sees you in his presence before him.
HAR.
What, are you he P SIMO.
You in the scarf, take you care, please, of some crooked misfortune, and point your finger1 at him ;
this fellow is a procurer.
BAL. (pointing to SIMO).
And this is an honest man.
(To SIMO.)
But you, worthy fellow, are many a time being hunted after in the Forum with noise enough, when you haven't a groat in the world, unless this procurer here comes to help you a bit.
HAR.
But why don't you address yourself to me ?
BAL.
I do address you.
What is it you want ?
HAR.
You to take this money.
(-He holds out thefive minœ.)BAL.
(holding out his hand).
Already have I extended my hand, if you are going to give it.
HAR.
Take it;
here are five picked minæ of silver counted out.
(Gives him the money.)
This did my master, Polyma­ chæroplagides.
order me to deliver to you, the sum which he was owing, and that you were to send Phœnicium with me.
BAL.
Your master ?
HAR.
I say to that effect.
BAL.
The Captain ?
HAR.
I speak to that effect.
BAL.
The Macedonian ?
HAR.
Such is the fact, I say.
HAR.
You say what's fact.
BAL.
To give me this money ?
lIAR.
If you really are the procurer Ballio.
BAL.
And for you to take away the woman from me ?
HAR.
Even so.
BAL.
Did he say that it was Phœnicium ?
HAR.
You remember it exactly.
BAL.
Wait there;
I'll return to you this instant.
HAR.
Make haste, then, with all speed, for I'm in a hurry, 'Tis now late in the day, d'ye see ?
BAL.
I see ;
still I wish to call this person aside.
Do you only wait there;
I'll return to you this instant.
(He takes SIMO on one side.)
What's to be done now, Simo ?
What are we to do ?
I've detected this fellow that has brought the money in the fact.
SIMO.
How so ?
BAL.
And don't you understand what this plan is ?
SIMO.
About as much as the most ignorant do.
BAL.
Your servant, Pseudolus, has sent this fellow on the message, as though he was from the Macedonian Captain.
SIMO.
Have you got the money from the fellow ?
BAL.
Do you ask about that which you see ?
(Shows the purse in his hand.)SIMO.
Harkye, remember to give me one half of that plunder.
It's right that that should be in common.
BAL.
Why, plague on't, 'tis all your own1.
HAR. (coming forward a step).
How soon are you going to attend to me ?
BAL.
I'll attend to you, indeed.
(Aside.)
What now'do you advise me to do, Simo ?SIMO. (aside).
Let's make some fun of this counterfeit spy, even until he himself shall be sensible that he is being made a fool of.
BAL.
Follow me.
(To HARPAX.)
What have you to say ?
You are his servant, I suppose ?
HAR.
Most certainly.
BAL.
At what price did he pur­ chase you?
lIAR.
With the victory of his prowess in battle;
for I was a very great general at home in my own country.
BAL.
Why, did he ever capture a gaol in your country ?
HAR.
If you utter affronting speeches, you'll be hearing them.
BAL.
In what time did you come from Sicyon hither ?
HAR.
In one day, by noon.
SIMO.
Bravo!
By my troth, you did come quickly;
how very swift of foot this man is.
BAL.
When you look at his calves, you might know that he can wear heavy fetters.
How say you—were you also, when a child, in the habit of sleeping in a cradle ?
SIMO.
Of course.
BAL.
And were you, too, in the habit of doing1—you know what I mean ?
SIMO.
Of course he was in the habit of doing as other children did?
HAlt.
Are you men in your senses ?
BAL.
What, be­ cause I asked you that ?
At night, when the Captain was going on guard, and when you were going with him, did the sword of the officer fit your scabbard ?
HAR.
Go to utter perdition.
BAL.
You, indeed, shall have the opportunity of going there in good time to-day.
HAR.
But do you bring out the woman to me, or else give me back the money.
BAL.
Wait a bit.
HAlt.
Why should I wait ?
BAL.
That scarf, tell me for how much it has been lent.
HAR.
What matters it ?
SIMO.
How much is the sword hired for ?
HAR.
These fellows surely stand in need of hellebore2.
BAL.
How now—(Takes hold of him.) HAR. (repulsing him).
Leave me alone.
BAL.
What wages does that broad-brimmed hat hire to- day for its owner ?
HAR.
What owner ?
SIMO.
What do the shoes ?
* * # * * * *HAR.
What are you dreaming about ?
Why, I'm the owner of all these things, bought with my own savings.
BAL.
Those, you mean, which the upper part of your thighs supports3.HAR. (aside).
These old fellows have been anointed;
they want themselves rubbed down1, after the old-fashioned custom.
BAL.
I' faith, prithee, answer me this truly and seriously, which I ask of you:
What are you to earn ?
For how trifling a sum has Pseudolus hired you ?
HAR.
Who is this Pseudolus ?
BAL.
Your tutor, who has instructed you in this knavery, to take away the woman hence from me by stratagem.
HAR.
What Pseudolus, and what stratagem are you talk­ ing to me about ?
A person that I know of no colour, black or white.
BAL.
Will you not be off from here ?
There's no profit here for swindlers to-day.
Therefore you may tell Pseudolus that another person has carried off the prize-the first Harpax that came.
HAR.
On my word, I really am that Harpax.
BAL.
Aye, on my word, you want to be.
This is nothing more nor less than a downright impostor.
HAR.
I have given yourself the money, and a while ago, im­ mediately on my arrival, the token to your servant;
a letter sealed with the likeness of my master, here before the door.
BAL.
You gave a letter to my servant ?
What servant ?
HAR.
To Syrus. BAL. (to SIMO).
The wicked rogue has assurance enough2.
He hasn't contrived his knavish scheme amiss.
By my faith, that whipping-post of a fellow, Pseudolus, how cleverly he has managed his plans;
just as much money as the Captain owed, he has given this man, and has dressed out the fellow that he might take away the woman * * * * * * * * (To HARPAX.)
But the real Harpax himself brought that letter hither to me.
HAlt.
My name is Harpax;
I am the servant of the Mace­ donian Captain.
I'm doing nothing roguishly or cheatingly, nor do I know or understand this Pseudolus, what mortal being he is.
SIMO.
Unless it's something wonderful, procurer, you've clearly lost the woman.
BAL.
Assuredly, by my troth, I'm in dread of that more and more, when I come to hear his words.
I' faith, that Syrus, too, has already set my heart a-freezing, that received the token from him.
SIMO.
'Tis a wonder if it isn't Pseudolus.
(To HARPAX.)
How now, you!
of what appearance was the person to whom you delivered the token ?
HAR.
A certain red-haired fellow1, pot-bellied, with thick calves, swarthy, with a big head, sharp eyes, red face, and very large feet.
BAL.
You prove our undoing, when you mention the feet.
It was Pseudolus himself.
It's all up with me.
I'm dying now, Simo.
HAlt.
By my troth, I shan't let you die, unless the money's returned me—twenty minæ.
SIMO.
And another twenty minæ to me as well.
BAL. (to SIMO).
And is the sum to be taken of me that I promised by way of a joke ?
SIMO.
From unprincipled men it's proper for both their money and their plunder to be taken.
BAL.
At least you might give up Pseudolus to me.
SIMO.
I, give up Pseudolus to you ?
What has he done amiss ?
Did I not tell you a hundred times that you were to beware of him ?
BAL.
He has ruined me.
SIMO.
And on me he has laid a fine of twenty fair minæ.
BAL.
What am I to do then ?
HAR.
When vou have given me the money-go hang yourself.
BAL.
The Gods confound you.
(To HARPAX.)
Follow me, then, this way, please, to the Forum, that I may pay you.
HAR.
I follow you.
SIMO.
What am I to do ?
BAL.
Strangers I'll pay at once ;
to-morrow I'll settle with fellow-citizens.
Pseudolus has been holding a council- general2 against my life, in sending that fellow to me to-day to carry off the woman.
(To HARPAX.)
Do you follow me.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Now don't you be expecting that I shall be returning home this way.
As matters stand, I've deter­ mined to go through the alleys.
HAR.
If you had walked at the rate you talk, you'd by this have been at the Forum.
BAL.
I'm determined to make this, instead of my birthday, my dying day.
(-Exit BALLIO, HARPAX folloioing.
SIMO.
I've touched this fellow handsomely, and cleverly has my servant managed his adversary.
Now am I resolved to lie in ambush for Pseudolus in a different manner to what's done in other plays, where people lie in wait with goads or whips.
Without revenge will I at once pay down the twenty minæ which I promised if he should effect it.
I'll carry them to him of my own accord.
This creature is very clever, very cunning, very artful.
Pseudolus has surpassed the Trojan stratageml and Ulysses too.
Now I'll be off in-doors.
I'll take out the money;
I'll lie in ambush for Pseudolus.
(Goes into his house.)PSEUD. (staggering).
How's this?
And is it the fact?
Feet-are you standing or not ?
Or is it this you want, some one to pick me up here as I lie ?
But, by my faith, if 1 do fall down, yours will be the fault.
Are you going to go ?
Heigho!
I must wait upon myself.
This is the great fault in wine ;
it first lays hold of the feet;
'tis a cunning wrestler.
By my faith, assuredly am I now come off right well drenched;
with such exquisite viands, with such becoming elegance, in such a delightful place, have we been delightfully enter­ tained.
What's the need for me to make much prosing?
This is the thing for a man, an object for him to pass his life for ;
here are all pleasures and all delights.
I think that the ecstasy is equal to that of the Deities, when the lover embraces his mistress, when he places lip to lip, when melting kisses are exchanged, when breast is pressed to breast, or else, if they please, they are locked in strict embrace;
then for your most loving mistress, with her white hand, to be pledging you in the luscious goblet, for no one there to be disagreable to another, for no one to be indulging in silly conversation;
for unguents and perfumes, ribbons1 and fes­ tive wreaths, to be provided in profusion;
and for the rest of the entertainment, too, to be provided in no niggardly style.
That no one may have to question me then, in this manner have myself and my young master been spending this day in jollity.
After I had fulfilled all my task just as I intended, the enemy put to flight, I was leaving them reclining and drinking, each lover with his mistress, and my own mistress there as well, indulging heart and soul.
But after I had risen, they begged me to dance.
After this fashion (he dances) did I show my­ self off there quite charmingly, in a master-like style, to wit;
for I am thoroughly acquainted with the Ionian step.
Thus, clad in my little mantle, full of fun, I was stepping about, this way.
Some of them clapped me, others cried out for me to dance again.
In that same IoniaM fashion once again did I begin to take a turn;
I presented myself to my mis­ tress, that she might caress me;
as I was pirouetting, down I tumbled:
that was the funeral dirge2 for my sport.
And so, while I was a-struggling to get up, near ,almost, 1 mean, I soiled my mantle.
Then, by my troth, I was the cause of plenteous mirth.
A goblet was presented me on account of my fall.
Forthwith I changed my mantle, and put on this;
thence have I come hither, that I might get rid of my surfeit.
Now I'm going to my old master, to put him in mind of our bargain.
Open-open the door.
Hallo, there!
Tell Simo, somebody, that I'm here.
(Knocks at the door of SIMO's house.)SIMO.
The voice of a rascally fellow is calling me out of doors.
(He stares at PSEUDOLUS.)
But what's this ?
How's this ?
What is it I see in this guise ?
PSEUD, (staggering towards him).
Your own Pseudolus, drunk, with a chaplet on2.
SIMO. (to himself).
By my troth, this is free and easy indeed.
But see his attitude;
is he on my account a bit the more afraid ?
I'm thinking whether I shall address him harshly or kindly.
But this (pointing to a purse in his hand) that I'm carrying forbids me to use rough measures towards him just now;
if there's any hope for me, centred in this.
PSEUD, (staggering up to SIMO).
A worthless fellow is coming to meet the best of men.
SIMO.
May the Gods bless you, Pseudolus. (PSEUDOLUS eructates.)
Foh!
go to utter perdition.
(Pushes him away.)PSEUD.
But why should I have that mischance befal me ?
SIMO.
Why, the plague, in your drunkenness, are you eructating in my face ?
PSEUD.
Hold me up, steadily;
take care that I don't fall.
Don't you see me, how drenched and soaking I am ?
SIMO.
What impudence is this, for you to be going about this way in broad daylight, drunk, with a chaplet on ?
PSEUD.
Such is my pleasure.
(Eructates again.)
SIMO.
Why your pleasure ?
Do you persist in eructating in my very face ?
PSEUD.
An eructation is comforting to me ;
do indulge me in it;
do but stand off.
SIMO.
For my part I really do believe, you villain, that you are able in a single hour to drink up four right plentiful vintages of the Massic hills3.
PSEUD.
A winter hour1, add.
SiMO.
You don't remind me amiss.
But tell me, however, whence I am to say that you are bringing your deeply-laden bark ?
PSEUD.
I've just been having a thorough bout with your son.
That damsel is the cause of this ;
along with your son she is carousing, a free woman.
SIMO.
You are a most worthless fellow.
PSEUD.
But, Simo, wasn't Ballio nicely diddled?
How well I carried what I told you into effect.
SIMO.
I know everything in its order, just as you managed each particular.
PSEUD.
Why, then, do you hesitate to pay me the money?
SIMO.
You ask what's just, I confess;
take it.
(Gives him, the money.)PSEUD.
But you declared that you wouldn't give it me;
and still do you give it.
SIMO.
Are you laughing at me ?
What ?
Are you going to take this from your master, Pseudolus ?
PSEUD.
With most willing heart and soul.
SIMO.
Prithee, can't you venture to make me an abate­ ment of some portion of this money ?
PSEUD.
No:
you shall say that I really am a greedy fellow;
for you shall never be richer by a single coin of this money.
SIMO.
Well, I really didn't suppose that it would ever come to pass with me that I should be begging of you.
PSEUD.
Load your shoulder with it, and follow me this way.
(Pointing.)SIMO.
I—load myself with that ?
PSEUD.
You will load yourself, I'm sure.
SIMO.
What am I to do to this fellow?
Doesn't he, con­ trary to my expectation, take my money, and then laugh at me ?
PSEUD.
Woe to the conquered2;
turn your back, then.
(Turns him round.)SIMO.
Oh!
oh! desist.
Let me alone—I'm in pain.
PSEUD.
Were you not in pain, I should be in pain;
and no compassion would you have bad for my back, if I hadn't this day managed this.
SIMO.
There will be an opportunity for me to be revenged on you, if I live.
PSEUD.
Why do you threaten ?
I've got a back of ray own.
SIMO.
Very well, then.
(Moves as if going.)
PSEUD.
Come you back then.
SIMO.
Why come back ?
PSEUD.
Only come you back;
you shall not be deceived.
SIMO. (turns round).
I am come back.
PSEUD.
Come and have a drink with me.
SIMO.
What—I, come?
PSEUD.
Do as I ask you.
If you do come, I'll let you take half of this, or even more.
(Points to the purse in his hand.)SIMO.
I'll come ;
take me where you like, Pseudolus.
PSEUD.
How now then ?
Are you at all angry with me or with your son, Simo, on account of these matters ?
SIMO.
Certainly, not at all.
PSEUD. (going).
Step this way now.
SIMO.
I follow you.
But why don't you invite the Spec­ tators as well ?
PSEUD. (turning round).
I' faith, they are not in the habit of inviting me;
and, therefore, I don't invite them.
But if you (addressing the AUDIENCE) are willing to applaud and approve of this company of players, and this Comedy, I invite you for to-morrow1.

One of these, whose name was Menæchmus, when a child, accom­ panied his father to Tarentum, at which place he was stolen and carried away to Epidamnus, where in course of time he has married a wealthy wife.
Disagree­ ments, however, arising with her, he forms an acquaintance with the Courtesan Erotium, and is in the habit of presenting her with clothes and jewels which he pilfers from his wife.
The original name of the other twin-brother was Sosicles, but on the loss of Menæchmus, the latter name has been substituted by their grandfather for Sosicles, in remembrance of the lost child.
Menæchmus Sosicles, on growing to manhood, determines to seek his lost brother.
Having wandered for six years, he arrives at Epidamnus, attended by his servant, Messenio.
In consequence of his resemblance to his brother, many curious and laughable mistakes happen between him and the Courtesan Erotium, the wife of Menæchmus of Epidamnus, the Cook Cylindrus, the Parasite Peniculus, the father-in-law of Menæchmus of Epidamnus, and lastly Messenio himself.
A:
length, through the agency of the latter, the brothers recognize each other;
on wnich Messenio receives his liberty, and Munæchmus of Epidamnus resolves to make sale of his possessions and to return to Syracuse, his nat've plane.
[Supposed to have been written by Priscian the Grammarian.]A SICILIAN merchant (Mercator) who had two sons, on one being stolen from him (Ei), ended his life.
As a name (Nomen) for him who is at home, his paternal grandfather (Avus) gives him that of Menæchmus instead of Sosicles.
And (Et) he, as soon as he is grown up, goes to seek his brother about (Circum) all countries.
At last he comes to Epidamnus;
hither (Huc) the one that was stolen has been carried.
All think that the stranger, Menæchmus (Menœch­ mum), is their fellow-citizen, and address him (Eum) as such:
Courtesan, wife, and father-in-law.
There (Ibi) at last the brothers mutually recognize each other.
IN the first1 place now, Spectators, at the commencement, do I wish health and happiness2 to myself and to you.
I bring you Plautus, with my tongue, not with my hand:
I beg that you will receive him with favouring ears.
Now learn the argument, and give your attention;
in as few words as pos­ sible will I be brief.
And, in fact, this subject is a Greek one;
still, it is not an Attic3, but a Sicilian one.
But in their Comedies the poets do this;
they feign that all the business takes place at Athens4, in order that it may appear the more Grecian to you.
I will not tell you that this matter happened anywhere except where it is said to have happened.
This has been my preface to the subject of this play.
Now will I give the subject, meted out.
to you, not in a measure, nor yet in a threefold measure1, but in the granary itself;
so great is my heartiness in telling you the plot.
There was a certain aged man, a merchant at Syracuse2;
to him two sons were born, twins, children so like in appearance that their own foster-motherS, who gave the breast, was not able to distinguish them, nor even the mother herself who.
had given them birth ;
as a person, indeed, informed me who had seen the children;
I never saw them, let no one of you fancy so.
After the children were now seven years old, the father freighted a large ship with much merchandize.
The father put one of the twins on board the ship, and took him away, together with himself, to traffic at Tarentum4;
the other one he left with his mother at home.
By accident, there were games at Tarentum when he came there:
many persons, as generally happens at the games, had met together;
the child strayed away there from his father among the people.
A cer­ tain merchant of Epidamnus was there;
he picked up the child, and carried it away to Epidamnus5.
But its father, after he had lost the child, took it heavily to heart, and through grief at it he died a few days after at Tarentum.
Now, after news reached the grandfather of the children at home about this matter, how that one of the children had been stolen, the grandfather changed the name of that other twin.
So much did he love that one which had been stolen, that he gave his name to the one that was at home.
That you may not mis­ take hereafter, I tell you then this beforehand;
the name of both the twin-brothers is the same.
He gave the same name of Menæchmus to this one as the other had;
and by the same name the grandfather himself was called.
I remember his name the more easily for the reason that I saw him cried with much noised
Now must I speed back on foot to Epi­ damnus, that I may exactly disclose this matter to you.
If any one of you2 wishes anything to be transacted for him at Epidamnus, command me boldly and speak out;
but on these terms, that he give me the means by which it may be transacted for him.
For unless a person gives the money, he will be mis­ taken ;
(in a lower tone) except that he who does give it will be very much more mistaken3.
But I have returned to that place whence I set forth, and yet I am standing in the self-same spot.
This person of Epidamnus, whom I mentioned just now, that stole that other twin child, had no children, except his wealth.
He adopted as his son the child so carried off, and gave him a well-portioned wife, and made him his heir when he himself died.
For as, by chance, he was going into the country, when it had rained heavily, entering, not far from the city, a rapid stream, in its rapidity4 it threw the ravisher of the child off his legs, and hurried the man away to great and grievous destruction.
And so a very large fortune fell to that youth.
Here (pointing to the house) does the stolen twin now dwell.
Now that twin, who dwells at Syracuse, has come this day to Epidamnus with his servant to make enquiry for this own twin-brother of his.
This is the city of Epidamnus while this play is acting;
when another shall be acted, it will become another town;
just as our companies, too, are wont to be shifted about.
The same person now acts the procurer, now the youth, now the old man, the pauper, the beggar, the king, the parasite, the soothsayer * * * *PEN.
The young men have given me the name of Peni­ culus1, for this reason, because when I eat, I wipe the tables clean.
* * * * * * *
The persons who bind captives with chains, and who put fetters upon runaway slaves, act very foolishly, in my opinion at least.
For if bad usage is added to his misfortune for a wretched man, the greater is his inclination to run away and to do amiss.
For by some means or other do they release them­ selves from the chains;
while thus fettered, they either wear away a link with a file, or else with a stone they knock out the nail;
'tis a mere trifle this.
He whom you wish to keep securely that he may not run away, with meat and with drink ought he to be chained.;
do you bind down the mouth of a man to a full table.
So long as you give him what to eat and what to drink at his own pleasure in abundance every day, i' faith he'll never run away, even if be, has committed an offence that's capital;
easily will you secure him so long as you shall bind him with such chains.
So very supple are these chains of food, the more you stretch them so much the more tightly do they bind.
But now I'm going directly to Menæchmus;
whither for this long time I have been sen­ tenced, thither of my own accord I am going, that he may enchain me.
For, by my troth, this man does not nourish persons, but he quite rears and reinvigorates them;
no one administers medicine more agreably.
Such is this young man;
himself with a very well-stocked larder, he gives dinners fit for Ceres2;
so does he heap the tables up, and piles so vast of dishes does he arrange, you must stand on your couch if you wish for anything at the top.
But I have now had an interval these many days, while I've been lording it at home all along together with my dear ones1;
—for nothing do I eat or pur­ chase but what it is most dear.
But inasmuch as dear ones, when they are provided, are in the habit of forsaking us, I am now paying him a visit.
But his door is opening;
and see, 1 perceive Menæchmus himself;
he is coming out of doors.
SCENE II.
—Enter MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnus,from his house.
MEN. (speaking at the door to his WIFE within).
Unless you were worthless, unless you were foolish, unless you were stark wild and an idiot, that which you see is disagreable to your husband, you would deem to be so to yourself as well.
Moreover, if after this day you do any such thing to me, I'll force you, a divorced woman, turned out of my doors to go visit your father.
For as often as I wish to go out of the house, you are detaining me, calling me back, asking me questions:
whither I am going, what matter I am about, what business I am transacting, what I am wanting, what I am bringing, what I have been doing out of doors ?
I've surely brought home a custom-house officer2 as my wife;
so much am I obliged to disclose all my business, whatever I have done and am doing.
I've had you hitherto indulged too much.
Now, therefore, I'll tell you how I am about to act.
Since I find you handsomely in maids, provisions, wool, gold trinkets, garments, and purple, and you are wanting in nought, you'll beware of a mischief if you're wise;
you'll leave off watching your husband.
(In a lower voice.)
And therefore, that you mayn't be watching me in vain, for your pains I shall find me a mistress to-day, and invite her to dinner somewhere out of doors.
PEN. (apart).
This fellow pretends that he's upbraiding his wife, but he's addressing myself;
for if he does dine out of doors, he really is punishing me, not his wife.
MEN. (to himself).
Hurra!
I' troth, by my taunts I've driven my wife from the door at last.
Where now are your intriguing husbands ?
Why do they hesitate, all returning thanks, to bring presents to me who have fought so gallantly ?
This mantle1 of my wife's (taking it from under his cloak) I've just now stolen from in-doors, and I'm taking it to my mistress.
This way it's proper for a clever trick to be played this knowing husband-watcher.
This is a becoming action, this is right, this is skilful, this is done in workman-like style;
inasmuch as at my own risk I've taken this from my plague, this same shall be carried off to destruction2.
With the safety of my allies3 I've gained a booty from the foe.
PEN. (aloud, at a distance).
Harkye!
young man;
pray what share have 14 in that booty ?
MEN.
I'm undone ;
I've fallen into an ambuscade.
PEN.
Say a safeguard rather.
Don't be afraid.
MEN.
What person's this ?
PEN.
'Tis I. (Coming up to him.)MEN.
0 my convenient friend—O my ready occasion, save you.
PEN.
And save you.
(They shake hands.)
MEN.
What are you about ?
PEN.
Holding my good Genius in my right hand.
MEN.
You couldn't have come to me more a propos than you have come.
MEN.
I'm in the habit of doing so;
I understand all the points of ready occasion.
MEN.
Would you like to be witness of a brilliant exploit ?
PEN.
What cook has cooked it ?
I shall know at once if he has made any mistake, when I see the remnants5.
MEN.
Tell me—did you ever see a picture painted on a wall, where the eagle is carrying off Ganymede1, or Venus Adonis ?
PEN.
Many a time.
But what are these pictures to me ?
MEN.
Come, look at me2.
Do I at all bear any resem­ blance to them ?
PEN.
What's this garb of yours ?
MEN.
Pronounce me to be a very clever fellow.
PEN.
Where are we to feed ?
MEN.
Only do you say that which I requested you.
PEN.
Well, I do say so ;
very clever fellow.
MEN.
And don't you venture to add anything of your own to it ?
PEN. —
And very pleasant fellow.
MEN.
Go on.
PEN.
I' faith, I really can't go on, unless I know for what reason.
You've had a fall-out with your wife ;
on that ground am I the more strongly on my guards against you.
MEN.
While you are interrupting me, you are delaying yourself.
PEN.
Knock out my only eye4, Menæchmus, if I speak one word but what you bid me.
MEN.
* * * * where, un­ known to my wife, we will erect the funeral pile * * ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ and let us consume this day, upon it.
PEN.
Well, come then, since you request what's fair, how soon am I to set fire to the pile ?
Why really, the day's half dead already down to its navel2.
MEN.
Come this way from the door.
PEN.
Be it so.
(Movesfrom the door.)
MEN.
Come still more this way.
PEN.
Very well.
(Moves.) MEN.
Even still, step aside boldly from the lioness's den.
PEN. (still moving).
Well done;
by my troth, as I fancy, you really would be an excellent charioteer3.
MEN.
Why so ?
PEN.
That your wife mayn't follow you, you are looking back ever and anon.
MEN.
But what say you ?
PEN.
What, I?
Why, whatevei you choose, that same do I say, and that same do I deny.
MEN.
Could you make any conjecture at all from the smell, if perchance you were to take a smell at something ?
PEN.
Were the college of Augurs summoned * * ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗MEN. (holds out the skirt of the mantle).
Come then, take a sniff at this mantle that I'm holding.
What does it smell of?
Do you decline?
PEN.
It's as well to smell the top of a woman's garment;
for at this other place the nose is offended with an odour that can't be washed out.
MEN. (holding another part).
Take a smell here then, Peniculus, as you are so daintily nice.
PEN.
Very well.
(He smells it.) MEN.
How now?
What does it smell of ?
Answer me.PEN.
Theft, a mistress, and a breakfast.
To you ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗MEN.
You have spoken out * * * * * now it shall be taken to this mistress of mine, the Courtesan Erotium.
I'll order a breakfast at once to be got ready, for me, you, and her;
then will we booze away even to the morrow's morning star.
PEN. Capital.
You've spoken out distinctly.
Am I to knock at the door then ?
MEN.
Knock-or hold, rather.
PEN.
You've removed1 the goblet a full mile by that.
MEN.
Knock gently.
PEN.
You're afraid, I think, that the doors are made of Samian crockery.
(Goes to knock.)MEN.
Hold, prithee, hold, i' faith;
see, she's coming out herself.
(The door of EROTIUM'S house is opened.)
Ha you behold the sun, is it not quite darkened in comparison with the bright rays of her person.
ERO.
My life, Menæchmus, save you.
PEN.
And what for me ?
ERO.
You are out of my number.
PEN. ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ * that same thing is wont to be done for the other supernumeraries2 of the legion.
MEN.
I would order a skirmish to be got ready there at your house for me to-day.
MEN.
In that skirmish we two shall drink.
Him shall you choose that shall be found there the better warrior with the goblet;
do you make up your mind with which of the two you'll pass this night.
How much, my love, when I look upon you, do I hate my wife.
ERO.
Meantime, however, you cannot help being wrapped in something of hers.
What's this ?
(Takes hold of the mantle.)MEN. (taking it off).
'Tis a new dress for you, and a spoil from1 my wife, my rosebud.
Euo.
You have a ready way of prevailing, so as to be superior in my eyes to any one of those that pay me suit.
(Embraces him.)PEN. (aside).
The harlot's coaxing in the meantime, while she's looking out what to plunder * * * * * * * (to EROTIUM) for if you really loved him, by this his nose ought to have been off with your teething him2.
MEN.
Take hold of this, Peniculus:
I wish to dedicate the spoil that I've vowed.
PEN.
Give it me.
(Holds it while MEN ÆCHMUS puts it on.)
But, i' faith, prithee, do dance afterwards with the mantle on in this way.
MEN.
I—dance ?
I' faith, you're not in your senses.
PEN.
Are you or I the most ?
If you won't dance, then take it off.
MEN. (to EROTIUM).
At a great risk have I stolen this to- day.
In my opinion, indeed, Hercules didn't ever carry off the belt from Hippolyta3 with danger as great.
Take this for yourself (he takes it off, and gives her the mantle), since you are the only one alive that's compliant with my humours.
ERO.
With such feelings 'tis proper that real lovers should be animated.
PEN. (aside).
Those, indeed, who are making haste to bring themselves down to beggary.
MEN.
I purchased that for my wife a year since at the price of four minæ.
PEN. (aside).
The four minæ are clearly gone for ever, as the account now stands.
MEN.
Do you know what I wish you to attend to ?
ERO.
I don't know;
but I'll attend to whatever you do wish.
MEN.
Order a breakfast, then, to be provided for us three at your house, and some dainties to be purchased at the market;
kernels of boars' neck, or bacon off the gammon1, or pig's head, or something in that way, which, when cooked and placed on table before me, may promote an appetite like a kite's :
and—forthwithERO.
I' faith, I will.
MEN.
We're going to the Forum:
we shall be here just now.
While it's cooking, we'll take a whet in the meantime.
ERO.
Come when you like, the things shall be ready.
MEN.
Only make haste, then.
Do you follow me (to PENI­ CULUS).
PEN.
By my troth, I certainly shall keep an eye on you, and follow you.
I wouldn't take the wealth of the Gods to lose you this day.
(Exeunt MENÆCHMUS and PENICULUS.ERO.

Call Cylindrus, the cook, out of doors this moment from within.
ERO.
Take a hand-basket and some money.
See, you have three didrachms here.
(Giving him money.)CYL.
I have so.
ERO.
Go and bring some provisions, see that there's enough for three;
let it be neither deficient nor overmuch.
CYL.
What sort of persons are these to be ?
ERO.
Myself, Men chmus, and his Parasite.
CYL.
Then these make ten, for the Parasite easily performs the duty of eight persons2.
ERo.
I've now told you the guests;
do you take care of the rest.
CYL.
Very well.
It's cooked already;
bid them go and take their places.

There's no greater pleasure to voyagers, in my notion, Messenio, than at the moment when from sea they espy the land afar.
MESS.
There is a greater, I'll say it without subterfuge,­ if on your arrival you see the land that is your own.
But, prithee, why are we now come to Epidamnus ?
Why, like the sea, are we going round all the islands ?
MEN.
Sos.
To seek for my own twin-brother born ?
MESS.
Why, what end is there to be of searching for him ?
This is the sixth year that we've devoted our attention to this business.
We have been already carried round the Istriansl, the Hispanians, the Massilians, the Illyrians, all the Upper Adriatic Sea, and foreign Greece2, and all the shores of Italy, wherever the sea reaches them.
If you -had been searching for a needle, I do believe you would, long ere this, have found the needle, if it were visible.
Among the living are we seeking a person that's dead;
for long ago should we have found him if he had been alive.
MEN.
Sos.
For that reason I am looking for a person to give me that information for certain, who can say that he knows that he really is dead;
after that I shall never take any trouble in seeking further.
But otherwise I shall never, while I'm alive, desist;
I know how dear he is to my heart.
MESS.
You are seeking a knot in a bulrush3.
Why don't we return homeward hence, unless we are to write a history4 ?
MEN.
SOS.
Have done with your witty sayings, and be on your guard against a mischief.
Don't you be troublesome;
this matter shan't be done at your bidding.
MESS, (aside).
Aye, aye;
by that same expression do I rest assured that I'm a slave;
he couldn't in a few words have said more in a plain-spoken way.
But still I can't restrain myself from speaking.
(Aloud.)
Do you hear, Menaechmus ?
When I look in the purse, Ifind, i' faith, we're only equipped for our journey like summer trayellers1.
By my troth, I guess, if you don't be returning home, while you're seeking your twin- brother, you'll surely be groaning2, when you have nothing left.
For such is this race of people;
among the men of Epidamnus there are debauchees and very great drinkers;
swindlers besides, and many wbeedlers are living in this city;
then the women in the harlot line are said nowhere in the world to be more captivating.
The name of Epidamnus was given to this city for the very reason, because hardly any person sojourns here without some damnable mishap3.
MEN.
Sos. I'll guard against that.
Just give me the purse this way.
MESS.
What do you want with it?
MEN.
SOS.
I'm apprehensive then about yourself, from your expressions.
MESS.
Why are you apprehensive ?
MEN.
Sos.
Lest you should cause me some damnable mishap in Epidamnus.
You are a great admirer of the women, Messenio, and I'm.
a pas­ sionate man, of an unmanageable disposition;
of both these things will I have a care, when I've got the money, that you shall not commit a fault, and that I shall not be in a passion with you.
MESS. (giving him the purse).
Take and keep it;
with all my heart you may do so.

I'll set a good breakfast before the breakfasters.

bid a sacrifice be made for you at my expense;

If you take my advice, that didrachm, which you just now promised to give me—you would order, if you were wise, a pig to be procured with it for yourself.

By my faith, a very silly fellow, and an annoyance to me.

How very droll he is, when his wife isn't present.

What, you villain, urges you to be an annoyance to him?
CYL.
Pray what business have you with me?

MEN.
Sos.
By my troth, you are not a person in his right senses, that I know for sure.

I'll have these things cooked directly;
there shall be no delay.
Don't you be going after this anywhere at a dis­ tance from the house.
Do you want anything ?
MEN.
Sos.
You to go to utter and extreme perdition.
CYL.
I' faith, 'twere better for you to go in-doors at once and take your place, while I'm subjecting these things to the strength of the fire1.
I'll go in-doors now, and tell Erotium that you are standing here, that she may fetch you away hence, rather than you be standing here out of doors.
(He goes into the house.)MEN.
Sos.
Is he gone then ?
He is gone.
By my faith, I find by experience that your words are not untrue.
MESS.
Do you only be on your guard;
for I do believe that some woman in the harlot line is living here, as, in fact.
this madman said, who has just gone away from here.
MEN.
Sos.
But I wonder how he came to know my name.
MESS.
I' faith, 'tis far from surprising:
courtesans have this custom;
they send servant-boys and servant-girls down to the harbour;
if any foreign ship comes into port, they enquire of what country it is, and what its name is;
after that, at once they set themselves to work, and fasten them­ selves upon him;
if they inveigle him, they send him home a ruined man.
Now in this harbour there stands a piratical craft, against which I really think that we must be on our guard.
MEN.
Sos.
I' troth, you really counsel aright.
MESS.
Then, in fine, shall I be sure that I' ve counselled aright, if you are rightly on your guard.
MEN.

Be silent for a moment, then;
for the door makes a noise.
Let's see who's coming out from there.

Meanwhile, I'll lay this down.

My dear life, it seems wonderful to me that you are standing here out of doors, for whom the door is wide open, more so than your own house, inasmuch as this house is at your service.
Everything's -ready as you requested and as you desired;
nor have you now any delay in-doors.
The breakfast, as you ordered, is prepared here;
when you please, you may go and take your place.
MEN.
Sos.
To whom is this woman addressing herself?
ERO.
Why, I'm talking to yourself.
MEN.
SOS.
What business have I ever had with you, or have I now ?
Eno.
Troth, inasmuch as Venus has willed that you singly above all T should exalt;
and that not without your deserving it.
For, by my faith, you alone make me, by your kindnesses, to be thriving.
MEN.
Sos.
For sure this woman is either mad or drunk, Messemo, that addresses me, a person whom she knows not, in so familiar a way.
MESS.
Didn't I say that these things are in the habit of occurring here ?
The leaves are falling now;
in comparison with this, if we shall be here for three days, the trees will be tumbling upon you.
For to such a degree are all these Courtesans wheedlers out of one's money.
But only let me address her.
Harkye, woman, I'm speaking to you.
ERO.
What's the matter ?
MESS.
Where have you your­ self known this person ?
ERo.
In that same place where he has known me for this long time, in Epidamnus.
MESS.
In Epidamnus ?
A man who, until this day, has never put a foot here inside of this city.
ERO.
Heyday!
You are making fun, my dear Menæch­ mus.
But, prithee, why not go in ?
There, it will be more suitable for you.
MEN.
SOS.
I' faith, this woman really does address me rightly by my name.
I wonder very much what's the meaning of this business.
MESS. (aside).
That purse that you are carrying has been smelt out by her.
MEN. SOS. (aside).
I' faith, and rightly have you put me in mind.
Take it, then;
I'll know now.
whether she loves myself or the purse most.
(Gives him the purse.
ERO.
Let's go in the house to breakfast.
ERO.
Why then did you bid me a while since prepare a breakfast for you ?
Eno.
Certainly you did, for yourself and your Parasite.
MEN.
Sos.
A plague, what Parasite ?
Surely this woman isn't quite right in her senses.
ERO.
Peniculus.
MEN.
Sos.
Who is this Peniculus ?
The one with which the shoes are wiped clean1 ?
ERO.
Him, I mean, who came with you a while ago, when you brought me the mantle which you purloined from your wife.
MEN.
Sos.
What do you mean ?
I, gave you a mantle, which I purloined from my wife ?
Are you in your senses ?
Surely this woman dreams standing, after the manner of a gelding1.
ERO.
Why does it please you to hold me in ridicule, and to deny to me things that have been done by you ?
MEN.
Sos.
Tell me what it is that I deny after having done it ?
ERO.
That you to-day gave me your wife's mantle.
MEN.
Sos.
Even still do I deny it.
Indeed, I never had a wife, nor have I one;
nor have I ever set my foot here within the city gate since I was born.
I breakfasted on board ship;
thence did I come this way, and here I met you.
ERO.
See that now;
I'm undone, wretched creature that I am!
What ship are you now telling me about ?
MEN.
Sos.
A wooden one, weather-beaten full oft, cracked full oft, many a time thumped with mallets.
Just as the implements of the furrier2;
so peg is close to peg.ERO.
Now, prithee, do leave off making fun of me, and step this way with me.
MEN.
SOS.
* * * * for, madam, you are looking for some other person, I know not whom, not me.
ERO.
Don't I know you, Menæchmus, the son of your father Moschus, who are said to have been born in Sicily, at Syracuse, where King Agathocles reigned, and after him Pintia3, the third Liparo, who at his death left the kingdom to Hiero—which Hiero is now king ?
MEN.
SOS.
You say, madam, what is not untrue.
MESS.
By Jupiter, hasn't this woman come from there, who knows you so readily ?
* * * *MEN. SOS. (apart).
Troth, I think she must not be denied.
MESS. (apart).
Don't you do it.
You are undone, if you enter inside her threshold.
MEN. SOS. (apart).
But you only hold your tongue * * * * * * *
The matter goes on well.
I shall assent to the woman, whatever she shall say, if I can get some entertainment.
Just now, madam (speaking to her in a low voice), I contradicted you not un­ designedly ;
I was afraid of that fellow, lest he might carry word to my wife about the mantle and the breakfast.
Now, when you please, let's go in-doors.
ERO.
Are you going to wait for the Parasite as well ?
MEN.
Sos.
I'm neither going to wait for him, nor do I care a straw for him, nor, if he should come, do I want him to be admitted in-doors.
ERO.
By my faith, I shall do that not at all reluctantly.
But do you know what I beg you to do ?
ERO.
For you to take that mantle which you gave me just now to the embroiderer's 1, that it may be trimmed again, and that some work may be added which I want.
MEN.
SOS.
I' faith, you say what's right;
in such a way shall it be disguised that my wife shan't know that you are wearing it, if she should see you in the street.
ERO.
Then take it away with you just now, when you go away.
MEN.
Sos.
By all means.
ERO.
Let's go in-doors.
(Goes into her house.)MEN.
Sos.
I'll follow you this instant;
I only wish to speak to this person.
So, there!
Messenio, step to me this way.
MESS.
What's the matter ?
MEN.
Sos. Listen.
MESS.
What need for it ?
MEN.
Sos.
There is need.
I know what you'll say to meMESS.
So much the worse.
MEN.
Sos.
Hold your tongue I've got some spoil;
thus much of the business have I begun upon.
Go, and, as quick as you can, take away those people1 at once to an inn2.
Then do you take care to come and meet me 3 before sunset.
MESS.
Don't you know that these people are harlots, master ?
MEN.
Sos.
Hold your tongue, I say, and go you away from here.
It will cost me pain, not you, if I do anything here that's foolish.
This woman is silly and inexperienced.
So far as I've perceived just now, there's some spoil for us here.
(He goes into the house of EROTIUM.)MESS.
I'm undone.
Are you going away then ?
He is certainly ruined;
the piratical craft is now leading the boat straight to destruction.
But I'm an unreasonable fellow to wish to rule my master;
he bought me to obey his orders, not to be his commander.
(To the ATTENDANTS.)
Follow me, that, as I'm ordered, I may come in good time to meet my master.
PEN.
More than thirty years have I been bon vet during that time I never did any more mischievous or more evil trick than this day, when, to my misfortune, I thrust myself into the midst of the assembly 1 .
while I was gaping about there, Menæchmus stole away from me, and went, I suppose, to his mistress, and didn't want to take me.
May all the Divinities confound that man who first.
mischievously devised the holding of an assembly, which keeps men thus engaged.
By my troth, is it not fitting that men who are disengaged should be chosen for that purpose ?
These, when they are cited, if they are not present, let the officers exact the fine2 forthwith * * * * the senate * *****
Abundance of men are there who every day eat their victuals alone, who have no business, who are neither invited nor invite to feast;
these ought to give their attendance at the assembly and the law-courts 3.
If so it had been, this say I shouldn't have lost my breakfast;
to which I deemed myself as much ac­ customed, as to see myself alive.
I'll go;
even yet the hope of the scraps comforts my mind.
But why do I see Menæch­ mus here ?
He's coming out of doors with a chaplet on ?
The banquet is removed;
i' faith, I come just in time to meet him.
I'll watch the fellow, what he's about, then I'll go and accost him.
(-He steps aside.)MEN.
SOS. (speaking to EROTIUM within).
Can't you rest content, if this day I bring it you back in good time, nicely and properly trimmed ?
I'll cause you to say it isn't itself, so much shall it be disguised.
PEN. (apart).
He's carrying the mantle to the embroi­ derer's, the breakfast finished and the wine drunk up, and the Parasite shut out of doors.
By my troth, I'm not the person that I am, if I don't handsomely avenge this injury and myself.
'Tis requisite I should watch * * * I'll give something.
MEN. SOS. (to himself).
0 ye immortal Gods!
on what man ever have you conferred more blessings in one day, who hoped for less ?
I've been breakfasting, drinking, feasting with a mistress;
and I've carried off this mantle, of which she shall no more be owner after this day.
PEN.
Isn't he now talking about me, and my share of the repast ?
I can't well hear what he says.
MEN. SOS. (to himself).
She says that I secretly gave her this, and that I stole it away from my wife.
When I per­ ceived that she was mistaken, at once I began to assent, as though I really had had acquaintanceship with her.
What.
ever the woman said, the same said I.
What need of many words ?
I was never entertained at less expense.
PEN. (apart).
I'll accost the fellow;
for I quite long to have a row.
MEN.
Sos.
Who's this that's coming up towards me?
(Takes off the mantle, and hides it.)PEN.
What say you, you fellow lighter than a feather, most rascally and most abandoned—you disgraceful man—you cheat, and most worthless fellow ?
Why have I deserved this of you ?
For what reason should you ruin me ?
How you stole yourself away from me just now at the Forum.
You've been performing the funeral of the breakfast in my absence.
Why did you dare to do so, when I was entitled to it in an equal degree ?
MEN.
Sos.
Young man, prithee, what business with me have you, who are thus purposely insulting a person whom you know not ?
Do you wish a punishment to be given you for your abuse ?
PEN.
Do be quiet;
by my faith, I discover that you've done that already indeed.
MEN.
SOS.
Answer me, young man, I beg;
what is your name ?
PEN.
Are you laughing at me, as well, as though you didn't know my name ?
MEN.
SOS.
By my troth, I never saw or knew you, that I'in aware of, before this day;
but at all events, whoever you are, if you do what's right, you won't be an annoyance to me.
PEN.
Don't you know me ?
MEN.
SOS.
I shouldn't deny it if I did know you.
PEN.
Menæchmus, awake.
MEN.
SOS.
I' troth, I really am awake, so far as I know.
PEN.
Don't you know your own Parasite ?
MEN.
SOS.
Young man, I find that your headpiece isn't sound.
PEN.
Answer me;
have you not purloined that mantle from your wife to-day, and given it to Erotium ?
MEN.
SOS.
I' faith I have no wife, nor have I given the mantle to Erotium, nor have I purloined it.
PEN.
Are you really in your senses ?
* * * * * * * *
This matter's settled 1. Did I not see you coming out of doors clad in a mantle ?
MEN.
Sos.
Woe to your head.
Do you think that all people are effeminate rogues2 because you are one ?
Do you declare that I was clothed in a mantle ?
PEN.
Troth, I really do.
MEN.
SOS.
Why don't you go where you are deserving to go, or else request yourself to be atoned for, you downright madman ?
PEN.
By my troth, never shall any one prevail upon me not to tell your wife the whole matter now, just as it happened.
All these insults shall be retorted upon yourself.
I'll take care that you shan't have devoured the breakfast unpunished.
(He goes into the house of MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnus.)MEN.
Sos.
What's the meaning of this business ?
Why, just as I see each person, do they all make fun of me in this way ?
But the door makes a noise.
MAID.
Menæchmus, Erotium says that she entreats you much, that at the same opportunity you'll take this to the goldsmith's, and add to it an ounce in weight of gold, and order the bracelet!
to be fashioned anew.
(Gives him a bracelet.)MEN.
Sos.
Tell her that I'll attend both to this and any­ thing else that she shall wish, if she wishes anything else attended to.
MAID.
Do you know what this bracelet is ?
MEN.
Sos.
I don't know, unless it's of gold.
MAID.
This is the same one that you once said that you had secretly stolen out of the closet from your wife,MEN.
Sos.
By my troth, 'twas never done.
MAID.
Prithee, don't you remember it ?
MEN.
Sos.
Not in the least.
MAID.
Give it me back then, if you don't remember it.
(Tries to take it.)MEN.
SOS. Stop. (Pretends to examine the bracelet.)
0 yes, I really do remember it;
it's the same, I believe, that I presented to her.
MAID.
I' faith, it is the same.
MEN.
Sos.
Where are the clasps which I gave her together with them ?
MAID.
You never gave her any.
MEN.
Sos.
Why, faith, I gave them together with this * * * * *MAID.
Shall
I say that you'll attend to it ?
MEN.
Sos.
Do say so;
it shall be attended to.
I'll take care that the mantle and the bracelet are brought back together.
MAID.
My dear Menæchmus, do, pray, give me some ear­ rings2, the pendants to be made two didrachms in weight;
that I may look on you with delight when you come to our house.
MEN.
Sos.
Be it so.
Give me the gold1;
I'll find the price of the workmanship.
MAID.
Give it yourself, please;
at a future time I'll give it you back.
MEN.
Sos.
No, give it yourself;
at a future time I'll give it you twofold.
MAID.
I haven't any.
MEN.
Sos.
But when you have it, do you give it me, then.
MAID.
Do you wish for aught ?
MEN.
Sos.
Say that I'll attend to these things, (aside) to be sold as soon as they can, and for what they'll fetch.
(The MAID-SERVANT goes into the house.)
Has she now gone off in-doors ?
She's gone, and has shut the door.
Surely all the Gods are favouring, amplifying, and prospering me.
But why do I delay while opportunity and time are granted me to get away from these procurers' dens ?
Make haste, Menæchmus;
pull foot and quicken your pace.
I'll take off this chaplet2, and throw it away on the left hand side (throws the chaplet down), that, if they follow me, they may think I've gone in that direction.
I'll go and meet my servant, if I can, that he may learn from me these blessings which the Gods confer upon me.
WIFE.
And shall I allow myself to remain in wedlocks here, when my husband secretly pilfers whatever's in the house, and carries it thence off to his mistress ?
PEN.
Why don't you hold your peace?
I'll let you now catch him in the fact;
do you only follow me this way.
(They go to the opposite side of the stage.)
In a state of drunkenness, with a chaplet on, he was carrying the mantle to the embroiderer's, which he purloined from you at home to-day.
But see, here is the chaplet which he had on.
(Seeing the chaplet on the ground.)
Now am I saying false ?
Aha, this way has he gone, if you wish to trace his footsteps.
And, by my faith, see, here he comes on his way back most opportunely, but he isn't wearing the mantle.
WIFE.
What now shall I do to him ?
PEN.
The same as usual;
abuse him.
WIFE.
So I am resolved.
PEN.
Let's step aside this way watch him from ambush.
(They retire on one side.)MEN. (to himself).
Howwe do practise a custom here that is veryfoolish and extremely troublesome, and how even thosewbo are the most worthy and great1 do follow this habit:
all wish their dependants to be many in number;
whether they are de­ serving or undeserving, about that they don't enquire.
Their property is more enquired about, than what the reputation of their clients is for honor.
If any person is poor and not dishonest, he is considered worthless;
but if a rich man is dishonest, he is considered a good client.
Those who neither regard laws nor any good or justice at all, the same have zealous patrons.
What has been entrusted to them, they deny to have been so entrusted;
men full of litigation, rapacious, and fraudulent;
who have acquired their property either by usury or by perjury;
their whole pleasure is in litigation.
When the day for trial is appointed, at the same time it is mentioned to their patrons, in order that they may plead for them, about what they have done amiss.
Before the peoplel, or at law before the Prætor, or before the Ædile, is the cause tried.
Just so, this day, a certain dependant has kept me very much engaged, nor was it allowed me to do what I wished, or in company with whom I wished;
so fast did he stick to me, so much did he detain me.
Before the Ædile, in behalf of his doings, very many and very disgraceful, did I plead his cause;
a compromise I obtained, obscure and perplexed­ more than enough I said, and than I needed to say, that surety for him2 might end this litigation.
What did he do ?
Well, what ?
He gave bail.
And never did I at any time see any person more clearly detected;
three very adverse wit­ nesses against all his misdeeds were there.
May all the Gods confound him, he has so spoilt this day for me ;
and myself as well, who ever this day beheld the Forum with my eyes.
I ordered a breakfast to be prepared;
my mistress is expecting me, I'm sure;
as soon as ever I had the opportunity, I made haste immediately to leave the Forum.
Now, I suppose, she's angry with me ;
the mantle, however, will appease her that I gave her, the one I took away to-day from my wife and carried to Erotium here.
PEN. (apart to the WIFE).
What say you now?
WIFE (apart).
That I'm unfortunately married to a worth­ less fellow.
PEN. (apart).
Do you perfectly hear what he says ?
WIFE (apart).
Quite well.
MEN.
If I am wise, I shall be going hence in-doors, where it may be comfortable for me.
PEN. (coming forward).
Stop;
on the contrary, it shall be uncomfortable.

this doesn't quite please me, but I'll speak to her.
Tell me, my wife, what is it amiss with you ?PEN. (to the WIFE).

Can't you cease being annoying to me ?
Did I ad­ dress you ?

Take yourself off—away with your caresses from me.
Do you persist in it ?

Why are you offended with me ?
WIFE.
You ought to know.
PEN.
The rascal knows, but he pretends not to know.
MEN.
Has any one of the servants done amiss ?
Do either the maid or the men-servants give you saucy answers ?
Speak out;
it shan't be done with impunity.

Do you ask me that ?
MEN.
Do you wish me to ask him ?

A certain person has taken a mantle.
(MENÆCH­ MUS starts.)PEN. (to MEN ÆCHMUS).
Why are you alarmed?

For my part, I'm not alarmed at all—(aside) except about one thing;
the mantle makes1 my face mantle.

Go on against your husband.

Won't you hold your tongue ?

Faith, I really will not hold my tongue.

On my word, I really never did nod to you, or wink in any way.

By Jupiter and all the Gods, I swear, wife, that I did not nod to him ;
isn't that enough for you PPEN.
She now believes you about that matter;
go back again there.
MEN.
Go back where ?

Why, to the embroiderer, as I suppose.
Go and bring the mantle back.
MEN.
What mantle is it?
PEN.
Now I hold my tongue, since he doesn't remember his own business.

Did you suppose that you could possibly commit these villanies unknown to me ?
By heavens, you have as­ suredly taken that away from me at a heavy usury;
such is the returnl.

Such is the return.
Do you make haste to eat up the breakfast in my absence;
and then in your drunken­ ness make fun of me, with your chaplet on, before the house.
MIEN.
By all the powers, I have neither breakfasted, nor have I this day set foot inside of that house.
PEN.
Do you deny it ?
MEN.
By my troth, I really do deny it.
PEN.
Nothing is there more audacious than this fellow.
Did I not just now see you standing here before the house, with a chaplet of flowers on, when you were declaring that my headpiece wasn't sound, and declaring that you didn't know me, and saying that you were a foreigner ?
MEN.
On the contrary, as some time since I parted with you, so I'm now returning home at last.

You didn't think it was in my power to take vengeance upon you;

By Jupiter and all the Gods, I swear, wife (and isn't that enough for you ?), that I did not give it.
PEN.
Aye, and I, by all the powers, that we are telling no untruth.

But I haven't given it away, but just only lent it to be made use of.
WIFE.
But, i' faith, for my part, I don't lend either your scarf or your cloak out of the house, to any one, to be made use of.
'Tis fair that the woman should lend out of the house the woman's apparel, the man the man's.
But why don't you bring the mantle home again ?

I'll have it brought back.

For your own interest you'll do so, as I think;
for you shall never enter the house to-day unless you bring the mantle with you.
I'm going home.

What's there to be for me, who have given you this assistance ?
WIFE.
Your assistance shall be repaid, when anything shall be purloined from your house.

Then, by my troth, that really will never be;
for nothing have I at home to lose.
May the Gods confound you, both husband and wife.
I'll make haste to the Forum, for I see clearly that I've quite fallen out with this family.
MEN.
My wife thinks that she does me an injury when she shuts me out of doors;
as though I hadn't another better place to be admitted into.
If I displease you, I must endure it;
I shall please Erotium here, who won't be shutting me out of her house, but will be shutting me up in her house rather.
Now I'll go;
I'll be- her to give me back the mantle that I gave her a while since.
I'll purchase another for her­ a better one.

ERO.
I know well;
that you may amuse yourself with me.
MEN.
Why no, troth, that mantle which I gave you a while since, give it me back, I entreat you;
my wife has be­ come acquainted with all the transaction, in its order, just as it happened.
I'll procure for you a mantle of twofold greater value than you shall wish.
ERO.
Why, I gave it your own self a little while since, that you might take it to the embroiderer's, and that bracelet, too, that you might take it to the goldsmith's that it might be made anew.
MEN.
You, gave me the mantle and the bracelet ?
You'll find 'twas never done.
For, indeed, after I gave it you awhile ago, and went away to the Forum, I'm but just re­ turning, and now see you for the first time since.
ERO.
I see what plan you are upon;
that you may de­ fraud me of what I entrusted to you, at that thing you are aimingMEN.
On my word, I do not ask it for the sake of defraud­ ing you.
But I tell you that my wife has discovered the matter.
ERO.
Nor did I of my own accord beg you to give it me;
of your own accord you yourself brought it me.
You gave it me as a present;
now you're asking for the same thing back again.
I'll put up with it;
keep it to yourself;
take it away;
make use of it, either yourself or your wife, or squeeze it into your money-box1 even.
After this day, that you mayn't be deceived, you shan't set your foot in this house, since you hold me in contempt, who deserve so well of you.
Unless you bring money, you'll be disappointed;
you can't cajole me.
Find some other woman, henceforth, for you to be disappointing.
MEN.
By my troth, very angry at last.
Hallo!
you;
stay, I bid you.
Come you back.
Will you stay now ?
Will you even for my sake come back ?
(EROTIUM goes into her house, and shuts the door.)
She has gone in-doors, and shut the house.
Now I'm regularly barred out;
I have neither any credit at home now, nor with my mistress.
I'll go and consult my friends on this matter, as to what they think should be done.
(Exit.MEN.
SOS.
I did very foolishly a while since, in entrusting my purse to Messenio with the money.
I suspect he has got himself into some bad house1 or other.
WIFE.
I'll look out to see how soon my husband is going to return home.
But here he is;
I see him;
I'm all right, he's bringing back the mantle.
MEN. Sos. (to himself).
I wonder where Messenio can be walking now.
WIFE.
I'll go and receive the fellow with such language as he deserves.
(Accosting him.)
Are you not ashamed to come forward in my presence, you disgraceful man, in that garb ?
MEN.
SOS.
What's the matter ?
What thing is troubling you, woman ?
WIFE.
Do you dare, you shameless fellow, to utter even a single word, or to speak to me ?
MEN.
Sos.
Pray, what wrong have I committed, that I shouldn't dare to speak to you ?
WIFE.
Do you ask me 0 dear, the impudent audacity of the fellow!
MEN.
Sos.
Don't you know, madam, for what reason the Greeks used to say that Hecuba was a bitch2 ?
WIFE.
I don't know, indeed.
MEN.
Sos.
Because Hecuba used to do the same thing that you are now doing.
She used to heap all kinds of imprecations on every one she saw;
and, therefore, for that reason she was properly begun to be called a bitch.
WIFE.
I can't put up with this disgraceful conduct of yours;
for I had rather see my life that of a widow, than endure this vile conduct of yours that you are guilty of.
MEN.
Sos.
What is it to me, whether you are able to endure to live in the married state, or whether you will separate from your husband ?
Is it thus the fashion here to tell these stories to a stranger on his arrival ?
WIFE.
What stories?
I say, I'll not endure it hence­ forth, but live separate rather than put up with these ways.
MEN.
Sos.
Troth, so far indeed as I'm concerned, do live separate, even so long as Jupiter shall hold his sway.
WIFE.
By heavens, I'll certainly now send for my father, and I'll tell him your disgraceful conduct that you are guilty of.
Go, Decio (calling to a SERVANT), seek for my father, that he may come along with you to me;
tell him that occasion has arisen for it.
I'll now disclose to him this dis­ graceful conduct of yours.
MEN.
Sos.
Are you in your senses ?
What disgraceful conduct of mine ?
WIFE.
When you filch from home my mantle and gold trinkets, without the knowledge of your wife, and carry them off to your mistress.
Don't I state this correctly ?
MEN.
Sos. 0 dear !
madam, by my faith, you are both very bold and very perverse.
Do you dare to say (pointing at the mantle) that this was stolen from you which another woman gave me, for me to get it trimmed ?
WIFE.
A little while since you didn't deny that you had purloined it from me;
do you now hold up that same before my eyes ?
Are you not ashamed ?
MEN.
Sos.
By my faith, madam, I entreat you, if you Know, show me what I'm to drink1, by means of which I may put up with your impertinence.
What person you are taking me to be, I don't know;
I know you just as well as Parthaon.
WIFE.
If you laugh at me, still, i' troth, you can't do so at him;
my father, I mean, who's coming here.
Why don't you look back ?
Do you know that person ?
MEN.
Sos.
Just as well as Calchas2 do I know him;
I have seen him on that same day on which I have seen your­ self before this present day.
WIFE.
Do you deny that you know me ?
Do you deny that you know my father ?
MEN.
Sos.
Troth, I shall say the same thing, if you choose to bring your grandfather.
WIFE.
I' faith, you do this and other things just in a like fashion.
OLD MAN.
According as my age permits, and as there is occasion to do so, I'll push on my steps and make haste to get along.
But how far from easy 'tis for me, I'm not mis­ taken as to that.
For my agility forsakes me, and I am beset with age;
I carry my body weighed down;
my strength has deserted me.
How grievous a pack upon one's back is age.
For when it comes, it brings very many and very grievous particulars, were I now to recount all of which, my speech would be too long.
But this matter is a trouble to my mind and heart, what this business can possibly be on account of which my daughter suddenly requires me to come to her, and doesn't first let me know what's the matter, what she wants, or why she sends for me.
But pretty nearly do I know now what's the matter;
I suspect that some quarrel has arisen with her husband.
So are these women wont to do, who, presuming on their portions, and haughty, require their husbands to be obedient to them;
and they as well full oft are not without fault.
But still there are bounds, within which a wife ought to be put up with.
By my troth, my daughter never sends for her father to come to her except when either something has been done wrong, or there is a cause for quarrelling.
But whatever it is, I shall now know.
And see, I perceive her herself before the house, and her husband in a pensive mood.
'Tis the same as I suspected.
I'll accost her.
WIFE.
I'll go and meet him.
May every happiness attend you, my father.
OLD MAN.
Happiness attend in Do I find you in good spirits ?
Do you bid me be fetched in happy mood ?
Why are you sorrowful ?
And why does he (pointing at MENÆCH­ MUS) in anger stand apart from you ?
Something, I know not what, are you two wrangling about1 between you.
Say, in few words, which of the two is in fault:
no long speeches, though.
WIFE.
For my part, I've done nothing wrong;
as to that point do I at once make you easy, father.
But I cannot live or remain here on any account;
you must take me away hence immediately.
OLD MAN.
Why, what's the matter ?
WIFE.
I am made a laughing-stock of, father.
OLD MAN.
By whom?
WIFE.
By him to whom you gave me, my husband.
OLD MAN.
Look at that-a quarrel now.
How often, I wonder, have I told you to be cautious, that neither should be coming to me with your complaints.
WIFE.
How, my father, can I possibly guard against that ?
OLD MAN.
Do you ask me ?
* * * * * * * * unless you don't wish.
How often have I told you to be compliant to your hus­ band.
Don't be watching what he does, where he goes, or what matter he's about.
WIFE.
Why, but he's in love with a courtesan here close by.
OLD MAN.
He is exceedingly wise:
and for this pains- taking of yours, I would even have him love her the more.
WIFE.
He drinks there, too.
OLD MAN.
And will he really drink the less for you, whether it shall please him to do to there or anywhere else ?
Plague on it, what assurance is this ?
On the same principle, you would wish to hinder him from engaging to dine out, or from receiving any other per­ son at his own house.
Do you want husbands to be your servants ?
You might as well expect, on the same prin­ ciple, to be giving him out his task, and bidding him sit among the female servants and card wool.
WIFE.
Why, surely, father, I've sent for you not to be my advocate, but my husband's :
on this side you stand1, on the other you plead the cause.
OLD MAN.
If he has done wrong in anything, so much the more shall I censure him than I've censured you.
Since he keeps you provided for and well clothed, and finds you amply in female servants and provisions, 'tis better, madam, to entertain kindly feelings.
WIFE.
But he purloins from me gold trinkets and mantles from out of the chests at home;
he plunders me, and secretly carries off my ornaments to harlots.
OLD MAN.
He does wrong, if he does that;
if he.
does not do it, you do wrong in accusing him when innocent.
WIFE.
Why at this moment, even, he has got a mantle, father, and a bracelet, which he had carried off to her ;
now, because I came to know of it, he brings them back.
OLD MAN.
I'll know from himself, then, how it happened.
I'll go up to this man and accost him.
(Goes up to ME­ NÆCHMUS.)
Tell me this, Menæchmus, what you two are disputing about, that I may know.
Why are you pensive?
And why does she in anger stand apart from you ?
MEN.
Sos.
Whoever you are, whatever is your name, old gentleman, I call to witness supreme Jove and the Dei­ tiesOLD MAN.
For what reason, or what matter of all matters ?
MEN.
Sos.
That I have neither done wrong to that woman, who is accusing me of having purloined this (pointing to the mantle) away from her at home * * * and which she solemnly swears that I did take away.
If ever I set foot inside of her house where she lives, I wish that I may become the most wretched of all wretched men.
OLD MAN.
Are you in your senses to wish this, or to deny that you ever set foot in that house where you live, you downright madman ?
MEN.
Sos.
Do you say, old gentleman, that I live in this house ?
(Pointing at the house.)OLD MAN.
Do you deny it ?
MEN.
Sos.
By my faith, I certainly do deny it.
OLD MAN.
In your fun you are going too far in denying it;
unless you flitted elsewhere this last night.
Step this way, please, daughter.
(To the WIFE.)
What do you say ?
Have you removed from this house ?
WIFE.
To what place, or for what reason, prithee ?
OLD MAN.
I' faith, I don't know.
WIFE.
He's surely making fun of you.
OLD MAN.
Can't you keep yourself quiet ?
Now, Me­ næchmus, you really have joked long enough;
now do seriously attend to this matter.
MEN.
Sos.
Prithee, what have I to do with you ?
Whence or what person are you ?
Is your mind right, or hers, in fact, who is an annoyance to me in every way ?
WIFE.
Don't yon see how his eyes sparkle ?
How a green colourl is arising on his temples and his forehead;
look how his eyes do glisten * * * * * * * * *MEN. SOS. 0 me!
They say I'm mad, whereas they of themselves are mad.
WIFE.
How he yawns, as he stretches himself.
What am I to do now, my father ?
OLD MAN.
Step this way, my daughter, as far as ever you can from him.
MEN. SOS. (aside).
What is there better, for me than, since they say I'm mad, to pretend that I am mad, that I may frighten them away from me ?
(He dances about.)
Evoe, Bacchus, ho!
Bromius1, in what forest dost thou in­ vite me to the chase ?
I hear thee, but I cannot get away from this spot, so much does this raving mad female cur watch me on the left side.
And behind there is that other old he-goat, who many a time in his life has proved the de­ struction of an innocent fellow-citizen by his false testi­ mony.
OLD MAN (shaking his stick at him).
Woe to your head!
MEN.
Sos. Lo !
by his oracle, Apollo bids me burn out her eyes with blazing torches.
(He points with hisfingers at her.)WIFE.
I'm undone, my father;
he's threatening to burn my eyes out.
OLD MAN.
Hark you, daughter.
WIFE.
What's the matter ?
What are we to do ?
OLD MAN.
What if I call the servants out here ?
I'll go bring some to take him away hence, and bind him at home, before he makes any further disturbance.
MEN. Sos. (aside).
So now;
I think now if I don't adopt some plan for myself, these people will be carrying me off home to their house.
(Aloud.)
Dost thou forbid me to spare my fists at all upon her face, unless she does at once get out of my sight to utter and extreme perdition ?
I will do what thou dost bid me, Apollo.
(-Runs after her.)OLD MAN (to the WIFE).
Away with you home as soon as possible, lest he should knock you down.
WIFE.
I'm off.
Watch him, my father, I entreat you, that he mayn't go anywhere hence.
Am I not a wretched woman to hear these things ?
(She goes into her house.)MEN. SOS. (aside).
I've got rid of her not so badly.
(Aloud).
Now as for this most filthy, long-bearded, palsied Tithonus, who is said to have had Cygnus for his father2, you bid me break in pieces his limbs, and bones, and members with that walking-stick which he himself is holding.
OLD MAN.
Punishment shall be inflicted if you touch me indeed, or if you come nearer to me.
MEN. Sos. (shouting aloud).
I will do what thou dost bid me;
I will take a two-edged axe, and I will hew this old fellow to his very bones, and I will chop his entrails into mince­ meat.
OLD MAN (retreating as far as he can).
Why really against that must I take care and precaution.
As he threatens, I'm quite in dread of him, lest he should do me some mischief.
MEN. Sos. (jumping and raising his arms).
Many things dost thou bid me do, Apollo.
Now thou dost order me to take the yoked horses, unbroke and fierce, and to mount the chariot, that I may crush to pieces this aged, stinking, tooth­ less lion.
Now have I mounted the chariot;
now do I hold the reins;
now is the whip in my hand.
Speed onward, ye steeds, let the sound of your hoofs be heard ;
in your swift course let the rapid pace of your feet1 be redoubled.
(-Points at the OLD MAN as he pretends to gallop.)OLD MAN.
Are you threatening me with your yoked steeds ?
MEN.
Sos. Lo! again, Apollo, thou dost bid me to make an onset against him who is standing here, and to murder him.
But what person is this that is tearing me hence by the hair down from the chariot ?
He revokes thy commands and the decree of Apollo.
OLD MAN.
Alas!
a severe and obstinate malady, i' faith.
By our trust in you, ye Gods * * * * * * * * even this .

All on a sudden has so great a distemper attacked him.
I'll go now and fetch a physician as fast as I can.
(Exit.MEN.
Sos.
Prithee, are these persons gone now out of my sight, who are compelling me by force, while in my wits, to be mad ?
Why do I delay to be off to the ship, while I can in safety ?

And all of you (to the SPECTATORS), if the old gentleman should return, I beg not to tell him, now, by what street I fled away hence.
(-Exit.OLD MAN.
My bones ache with sitting, my eyes with watching, while waiting for the Doctor, till he returned from his business.
At last the troublesome fellow has with diffi­ culty got away from his patients.
He says that he has set a broken leg for Æsculapius1, and an arm for Apollo.
I'm now thinking whether I'm to say that I'm bringing a doctor or a carpenter2.
But, see, here he comes.
-Do get on with your ant's pace.
Doer.
What did you say was his disorder ?
Tell me, respected sir.
Is he harassed by sprites3, or is he frenzied ?
Let me know.
Is it lethargy, or is it dropsy, that possesses him ?
OLD MAN.
Why, I'm bringing you for that reason, that you may tell me that, and make bit-a convalescent.
Doer.
That indeed is a very easy matter.
Why, I shall heal innumerable times as many4 in the day.
OLD MAN.
I wish him to be treated with great attention.
DOCT.
That he shall be healed, I promise that on my word;
so with great attention will I treat him for you.
OLD MAN.
Why, see!
here's the mail himself.
Doer.
Let's watch what matter he's about.
(They stand aside)MEN. (to himself).
By my faith, this day has certainly fallen out perverse and adverse for me, since the Parasite, who has filled me full of disgrace and terror, has made that all known, which I supposed I was doing secretly;
my own Ulysses1, who has brought so great evil on his king-a fellow that, by my troth, if I only live, I'll soon finish his life2.
But I'm a fool, who call that his, which is my own.
With my own victuals and at my own expense has he been sup­ ported ;
of existence will I deprive the fellow.
But the Courtesan has done this in a way worthy of her, just as the harlot's habit is :
because I ask for the mantle, that it may be returned again to my wife, she declares that she has given it me.
0 dear!
By my faith, I do live a wretched man.
OLD MAN (apart).
Do you hear what he says ?
DOCT. (apart).
He declares that he is wretched.
OLD MAN (apart).
I wish you to accost him.
Doer. (going up to him).
Save you, Menæchmus.
Prithee, why do you bare your arm ?
Don't you know how much mischief you are now doing to that disease of yours ?
MEN.
Why don't you go hang yourself ?
OLD MAN.
What think you now ?
DOCT.
What shouldn't I think ?
This case can't be treated with even ointment of hellebore.
But what have you to say, Mensechmus ?
MEN.
What do you want ?
Doer.
Tell me this that I ask of you;
do you drink white wine or dark-coloured ?
MEN.
What need have you to enquire ?
Doer. * * * * *MEN..
Why don't you go to utter perdition ?
OLD MAN.
Troth, he's now beginning to be attacked with the fit.

Why don't you ask whether I'm wont to eat dark bread, or purple, or yellow ?
Or whether I'm wont to eat birds with scales, or fish with wings ?
OLD MAN.
Dear, dear!
(Tothe DOCTOR.)
Don't you hear how deliriously he talks ?
Why do you delay to give him some­ thing by way of a potion, before his raving overtakes him ?
DOCT.
Stop a little;
I'll question him on some other matters as well.
OLD MAN.
You are killing me1 by your prating.
Doer. (to MENÆCHMUS).
Tell me this;
are your eyes ever in the habit of becoming bard2 ?
MEN.
What ?
Do you take me to be a locust3, you most worthless fellow ?
DOCT.
Tell me, now, do your bowels ever rumble that you know of?
MEN.
When I'm full, they don't rumble at all;
when I'm hungry, then they do rumble.
DOCT.
I' faith, he really gave me that answer not like an insane person.
Do you always sleep soundly until daylight ?
Do you easily go to sleep when in bed ?

Doer. (aside).
Now this person begins to rave.
(To the OLD MAN.)
From those expressions do you take care of yourself.
OLD MAN.
Why, he's now really quite favourable in his language, in comparison with what he was a short time since;
for, a little while ago, he was saying that his wife was a raving cur.
MEN.
What did I say ?
OLD MAN.
You were raving, I say.
MEN.
What, I ?
OLD MAN.
You there ;
who threatened as well to ride me down with your yoked steeds.
OLD MAN.
I myself saw you do this ;
I myself accuse you of this.
MEN.
And I know that you stole1 the sacred crown of Jupiter;
and that on that account you were confined in pri­ son ;
and after you were let out, I know that you were beaten with rods in the bilboes;
I know, too, that you murdered your father and sold your mother.
Don't I give this abuse in answer for your abuse, like a sane person ?
OLD MAN.
I' faith, Doctor, whatever you are about to do, prithee, do it quickly.
Don't you see that the man is raving ?
Door.
Do you know what's the best for you to do ?
Have him taken to my house.

Do you think so ?
Doer.
Why should I not ?
There at my own discretion I shall be able to treat the man.
OLD MAN.
Do just as you please.

I'll make you drink hellebore some twenty days.

Doer. (to the OLD MAN).
Go fetch some men to take him off to my house.
OLD MAN.
How many are sufficient ?
Doer.
Since I see him thus raving, four, no less.
OLD MAN.
They shall be here this instant.
Do you keep an eye on him,.
Doctor.
Doer.
Why, no, I shall go home that the things may be got ready, which are necessary to be prepared.

My father-in-law is gone, the Doctor is gone;

0 Jupiter!
Why is it that these people say I'm mad ?
Why, in fact, since I was born, I have never for a single day been ill.
I'm neither mad, nor do I commence strifes or quarrels.
In health myself, I see others well;
I know people, I address them.
Is it that they who falsely say I'm mad, are mad themselves ?
What shall I do now?
I wish to go home;
but my wife doesn't allow me;
and here (pointing to EROTIUM'S house) no one admits me.
Most unfortunately has this fallen out.
Here will I still remain;
at night, at least, I shall be let into the house, I trust.
(Stands near his door.)MESS, (to himself).
This is the proof of a good servant, who takes care of his master's business, looks after it, arranges it, thinks about it, in the absence of his master diligently to attend to the affairs of his master, as much so as if he himself were present, or even better.
It is proper that his back1 should be of more consequence than his appetite, his legs than his stomach, whose heart is rightly placed.
Let him bear in mind, those who are good for nothing, what reward is given them by their masters-lazy, worthless fellows.
Stripes, fetters, the mill, weariness, hunger, sharp cold;
these are the rewards of idleness.
This evil do I terribly stand in awe of.
Wherefore 'tis sure that to be good is better than to be bad.
Much more readily do I submit to words, stripes I do detest;
and I eat what is ground much more readily than supply it ground by myself2.
Therefore do I obey the command of my master, carefully and diligently do I observe it;
and in such manner do I pay obedience, as I think is for the interest of my back.
And that course does profit me.
Let others be just as they take it to be their interest;
I shall be just as I ought to be.
If I adhere to that, I shall avoid faultiness;
so that I am in readiness for my master on all occasions, I shall not be much afraid.
The time is near, when, for these deeds of mine, my master will give his reward.
After I had deposited the goods and the servants in the inn, as he ordered me, thus am I come to meet him.
(Going to the door of EROTITUM'S house.)
Now I'll knock at the door, that he may know that I'm here, and that out of this thick wood1 of peril I may get my master safe out of doors.
But l'in afraid that I'm come too late, after the battle has been fought.
OLD MAN (to the SERVANTS).
By Gods and men, I tell you prudently to pay regard to my commands, as to what I have commanded and do command.
Take care that this person is carried at once upon your shoulders to the surgery, unless, indeed, you set no value upon your legs or your sides.
Take care each of you to regard at a straw whatever threats he shall utter.
What are you standing for ?
Why are you hesitating?
By this you ought to have had him carried off on your shoulders.
I'll go to the Doctor;
I'll be there ready when you shall come.
MEN.
I'm undone.
What business is this?
Why are these men running towards me, pray ?
What do you want ?
What do you seek ?
Why do you stand around me ?

Whither are you dragging me ?
Whi­ ther are you carrying me ?
I'm undone.
I entreat your assistance, citizens, men of Epidamnus, come and help me.
(To the men.)
Why don't you let me go ?
MESS, (running towards them).
0 ye immortal Gods, I be­ seech you, what do I behold with my eyes ?
Some fellows, I know not who, are most disgracefully carrying off my master upon their shoulders.
MEN.
Who is it that ventures to bring me aid ?
MESS.
I, master, and right boldly.
(Aloud.) 0 shameful and scandalous deed, citizens of Epidamnus, for my master, here in a town enjoying peace, to be carried off, in daylight, in the street, who came to you a free man.
Let him go.
MEN.
Prithee, whoever you are, do lend me your aid, and don't suffer so great an outrage to be signally committed against me.
MESS.
Aye, I'll give you my aid, and I'll defend you, and zealously succour you.
I'll never let you come to harm;
'tis fitter that I myself should come to harm.
I'll now make a sowing on the faces of these fellows, and there I'll plant my fists.
I' faith, you're carrying this person off this day at your own extreme hazard.
Let him go.
(He lays about him.)MEN. (fighting with them).
I've got hold of this fellow's eye.
MESS.

You rascals!
you villains!
you robbers!

We are undone.
Troth, now, prithee, doMESS.
Let him go then.
MEN.
What business have you to touch me ?
Thump them with your fists.
MESS.
Come, begone, fly hence to utter perdition with you.
(Three run away.)
Here's for you, too (giving thefourth one a punch) ;
because you are the last to yield, you shall have this for a reward.
(They all disappear.)
Eight well have I marked his face, and quite to my liking.
Troth, now, master, I really did come to your help just now in the nick of time.
MEN.
And may the Gods, young man, whoever you are, ever bless you.
For, had it not been for you, I should never have survived this day until sunset.
MESS.
By my troth, then, master, if you do right, you will give me my freedom.
MEN.
I, give you your freedom?
MESS.
Doubtless:
since, master, I have saved you.
MEN.
How's this ?
Young man, you are mistaken.
MESS.
How, mistaken ?
MEN.
By father Jove, I solemnly swear that I am not your master.
MESS.
Will you not hold your peace ?
MEN.
I'm telling no lie;
nor did any servant of mine ever do such a thing as you have done for me.
MESS.
In that case, then, let me go free, if you deny that I am your servant.
MEN.
By my faith, so far, indeed, as I'm concerned, be free, and go where you like.
MESS.
That is, you order me to do so ?
MEN.
I' faith, I do order you, if I have aught of authority over you.
MESS.
Save you, my patron.
Since you seriously give me my freedom, I rejoice.
MEN.
I' faith, I really do believe you.
MESS.
But, my patron, I do entreat you that you won't command me any the less now than when I was your ser­ vant.
With you will I dwell, and when you go I'll go home together with you.
Wait for me here;
I'll now go to the inn, and bring back the luggage and the money for you.
The purse, with the money for our journey, is fast sealed up in the wallet;
I'll bring it just now here to you.
MEN.
Bring it carefully.
MESS.
I'll give it back safe to you just as you gave it to me.
Do you wait for me here.
MEN.
Very wonderful things have really happened this day to me in wonderful ways.
Some deny that I am he who I am, and shut me out of doors;
others say that I am he who I am not, and will have it that they are my servants.
He for instance, who said that he was going for the money, to whom I gave his freedom just now.
Since he says that he will bring me a purse with money, if he does bring it1, I'll say that he may go free from me where he pleases, lest at a time when he shall have come to his senses he should ask the money of me.
My father-in-law and the Doctor were saying that I am mad.
Whatever it is, it is a wonderful affair.
These things appear to me not at all otherwise than dreams.
Now I'll go in the house to this Courtesan, although she is angry with me ;
if I can prevail upon her to restore the mantle for me to take back home.
(-He goes into EROTlUM'S house.)MEN.
Sos.
Do you dare affirm, audacious fellow, that I have ever met you this day since the time when I ordered you to come here to meet me ?
MESS.
Why, I just now rescued you before this house, when four men were carrying you off upon their shoulders.
You invoked the aid of all Gods and men, when I ran up and delivered you by main force, fighting, and in spite of them.
For this reason, because I rescued you, you set me at liberty.
When I said that I was going for the money and the luggage, you ran before to meet me as quickly as you could, in order that you might deny what you did.
MESS.
Certainly.
MEN.
SOS.
Why, on the contrary, 'tis most certain that I myself would rather become a slave than ever give you your freedom.
MEN. (at the door, to EROTIUM within).
If you are ready to swear by your eyes, by my troth, not a bit the more for that reason, most vile woman, will you make it that I took away the mantle and the bracelet to-day.
MESS.
Immortal Gods, what do I see ?
MEN.
Sos.
What do you see ?
MESS.
Your resemblance in a mirror.
MEN.
SOS.
What's the matter ?
MESS.
'Tis your image;
'tis as like as possible.
MEN. SOS. (catching sight of the other).
Troth, it really is not unlike, so far as I know my own form.
MEN. (to MESSENIO).
0 young man, save you, you who preserved me, whoever you are.
MESS.
By my troth, young man, prithee, tell me your name, unless it's disagreable.
MEN.
I' faith, you've not so deserved of me, that it should be disagreable for me to tell what you wish.
My name is Menæchmus.
MEN.
Sos.
Why, by my troth, so is mine.
MEN.
I am a Sicilian, of Syracuse.
MEN.
Sos.
Troth, the same is my native country.
MEN.
What is it that I hear of you ?
MEN.
Sos.
That which is the fact.
MESS. (To MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES, by mistake).
I know this person myself (pointing to the other MENÆCHMUS) ;
he is my master, I really am his servant;
but I did think I be­ longed to this other.
(To MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnus, by mistake.)
I took him to be you;
to him, too, did I give some trouble.
(To his master.)
Pray, pardon me if I have said aught foolishly or unadvisedly to you.
MEN.
SOS.
You seem to me to be mad.
Don't you re­ member that together with me you disembarked from board ship to-day ?
MESS.
Why, really, you say what's right—you are my master;
(to MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnus) do you look out for a servant.
(To his master.)
To you my greetings;
(to MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnus) to you, farewell.
This, I say, is Menæchmus.
MIEN.
But I say I am.
MEN.
Sos.
What story's this ?
Are you Menaechmus ?
MEN.
I say that I'm the son of Moschus, who was my father.
MEN.
Sos.
Are you the son of my father ?
MEN.
Aye, I really am, young man, of my own father.
I don't want to claim your father, nor to take possession of him from you.
MESS.
Immortal Gods, what unhoped-for hope do you be­ stow on me, as I suspect.
For unless my mind misleads me, these are the two twin-brothers;
for.
they mention alike their native country and their father.
I'll call my master aside-Menæchmus.
BOTH OF THE MENÆCHMI.
What do you want ?
MESS.
I don't want you both.
But which of you was brought here in the ship with me ?
MESS.
You, then, I want.
Step this way.
(They go aside.)MEN.
SOS.
I've stepped aside now.
What's.the matter?
MESS.
This man is either an impostor, or he is your twin- brother.
But I never beheld one person more like another person.
Neither water, believe me, is ever more like to water nor milk to milk, than he is to you, and you likewise to him ;
besides, he speaks of the same native country and father.
'Tis.
better for us to accost him and make further enquiries of him.
MEN.
Sos.
I' faith, but you've given me good advice, and 1 return you thanks.
Troth, now, prithee, do continue to lend me your assistance.
If you discover that this is my brother, be you a free man.
MESS.
I hope .1 shall.
MEN.
SOS.
I too hope that it will be so.
MESS. (to MENÆCHMUS of Epidamnus).
How say you?
I think you said that you are called Menæchmus ?
MEN.
I did so indeed.
MESS. (pointing to his master).
His name, too, is Menæchmus.
You said that you were born at Syracuse, in Sicily;
he was born there.
You said that Moschus was your father ;
he was his as well.
Now both of you can be giving help to me and to yourselves at the same time.
MEN.
You have deserved that you should beg nothing but what you should obtain that which you desire.
Free as I am, I'll serve you as though roll.
had bought me for money.
MESS.
I have a hope that I shall find that you two are twin-born brothers, born of one mother and of one father on the same day.
MEN.
You mention wondrous things.
I wish that you could effect what you've promised.
MESS.
I can.
But attend now, both of you, and tell me that which I shall ask.
MEN.
Ask as you please, I'll answer you.
l'It not con­ ceal anything that I know.
MESS.
Isn't your name Menæchmus ?
MEN.
I own it.
MESS.
Isn't it yours as well?
MEN.
Sos.
It is.
MESS.
Do you say that Moschus was your father ?
MEN.
Truly, I do say so.
MEN.
Sos.
And mine as well.
MESS.
Are you of Syracuse ?
MEN.
Certainly.
MESS.
And you ?
MEN.
SOS.
Why not the same ?
MESS.
Hitherto the marks agree perfectly well.
Still lend me your attention.
(To MENÆCHMUS.)
Tell me, what do you remember at the greatest distance of time in your native country ?
MEN.
When I went with my father to Tarentum to traffic;
and afterwards how I strayed away from my father among the people, and was carried away thence.
MESS. (to MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES).
Why do you exclaim?
Why don't you hold your peace ?
(To MENÆCHMUS.)
How many years old were you when your father took you from your native country ?
MEN.
Seven years old;
for just then my teeth were changing for the first time.
And never since then have I seen my father.
MESS.
Well, how many sons of you had your father then ?
MEN.
As far as I now remember, two.
MESS.
Which of the two was the older-you or the other ?
MEN.
Both were just alike in age.
MESS.
How can that be ?
MEN.
We two were twins.
MEN.
Sos. The Gods wish to bless me.MESS, (to MENÆCHMUS SOSICLES).
If you interrupt, I shall hold my tongue.
MEN.
SOS.
Rather than that, I'll hold my tongue.
MESS.
Tell me, were you both of the same name ?
MEN.
By means;
for my name was what it is now, Menæchmus, the other they then used to call Sosicles.
MEN.
Sos. (embracing his brother).
I recognize the proofs;
I cannot refrain from embracing him.
My own twin-brother, blessings on you;
I am Sosicles.
MEN.
How then was the name of Menæchmus afterwards given to you ?
MEN.
Sos.
After word was brought to us that you * * * * * and that my father was dead, my grandfather changed it;
the name that was yours he gave to me.
MEN.
I believe that it did so happen as you say.
But answer me this.
MEN.
Sos.
Ask it of me.
MEN.
What was the name of our mother ?
MEN.
Sos. Teuximarcha.
MEN.
That quite agrees.
(He again embraces him.) 0 welcome, unhoped-for brother, whom after many years I now behold.
MEN.
Sos.
And you, whom with many and anxious labours I have ever been seeking up to this time, and whom I re­ joice at being found.
MESS, (to his master).
It was for this reason that this Courtesan called you by his name;
she thought that you were he, I suppose, when she invited you to breakfast.
MEN.
Why, faith, to-day I ordered a breakfast to be got ready here (pointing to EROTIUM'S house) for me, unknown to my wife;
a mantle which a short time since I filched from home, to her I gave it.
MEN.
Sos.
Do you say, brother, that this is the mantle which I'm wearing ?
MEN.
How did this come to you ?
MEN.
Sos.
The Courte­ san who took me here (pointing to EROTIUM'S house) to breakfast, said that I had given it to her.
I breakfasted very pleasantly;
I drank and entertained myself with my mistress;
she gave me the mantle and this golden trinket.
(Showing the bracelet.) * * * * *' * «:
* *MEN.
I' faith, I'm glad if any luck has befallen you on my account;
for when she invited you to her house, she supposed it to be me.
MESS.
Do you make any objection that I should be free as you commanded?
MEN.
He asks, brother, what's very fair and very just.
Do it for my sake.
MEN. SOS. (touching MESSENIO'S shoulder).
Be thou a free man.
MEN.
I am glad, Messenio, that you are free.
MESS.
Why, better auspices1 were required that I should be free for life.
* * * * * * * *MEN.
SOS.
Since these matters, brother, have turned out to our wishes, let us both return to our native land.
MEN.
Brother, I'll do as you wish.
I'll have an auction here, and sell whatever I have.
In the meantime, brother, let's now go in-doors.
MEN.
Sos.
Be it so.
MESS.
Do you know what I ask of you?
MEN.
What ?
MESS.
To give me the place of auctioneer.
MEN.
It shall be given you.
MESS.
Would you like the auction, then, to be proclaimed at once ?
For what day?
MEN.
On the seventh day hence.
MESS, (coming forward, and speaking in a loud voice).
An auction of the property of Menæchmus will certainly take place on the morning of the seventh day hence.
His slaves, furniture, house, and farms, will be sold.
All will go for whatever they'll fetch at ready money prices.
His wife, too, will be sold as well, if any purchaser shall come.
I think that by the entire sale Menæchmus will hardly get fifty hundred thousand2 sesterces.
(To the SPECTATORS.)
Now, Spectators, fare you well, and give us loud applauses3.

PHÆDRA,the daughter of Enclio.
STAPHYLA, an old woman, servant of Euclio.
–Athens, before the houses of EUCLIO and MEGADORUS, and the Temple of Faith.
EUCLIO, a miserly old Athenian, has a daughter named Phædra, who has ravished by a young man named Lyconides, but is ignorant from whom she has received that injury.
Lyconides has an uncle named Megadorus, who, being ignorant of these circumstances, determines to ask Phædra of her father, in marriage for himself.
Euclio has discovered a pot of gold in his house, which he watches with the greatest anxiety.
In the meantime, Megadorus asks his daughter in marriage, and his proposal is accepted;
and while pre­ parations are making for the nuptials, Enclio conceals his treasure, first in on place and then in another.
Strobilus, the servant of Lyconides, watches his movements, and, having discovered it, carries off the treasure.
While Euclio is lamenting his loss, Lyconides accosts him, with the view of confessing the outrage he nas committed on his daughter, and of announcing to him that his uncle, Megadorus, has cancelled his agreement to marry her, in favour of him­ self.
Euclio at first thinks that he is come to confess the robbery of the treasure.
After much parleying, his mistake is rectified, and the matter is explained;
on which Lyconides forces Strobilus to confess the theft;
and (although the rest of the Play in its original form is lost) we learn from the acrostic Argument that Strobilus gives up the treasure, and Lyconides marries the daughter of Euclio, and receives the gold for a marriage-portion.
The Supplement written by Codrus Ursens to supply the place of what is lost, has been added.
A POT (Aulam) that he has found full of gold, Euclio watches with the greatest strictness (Vi), being distracted in a dreadful manner.
Lyconides (Lyconides) debauches his daughter.
Megadorus wishes ( Vult) to marry her without a por­ tion, and to do it in a cheerful way (Lubens), he provides cooks with provi­ sions.
Euclio is afraid on account of the gold (Auro);
he drives them out of the house;
and the whole matter (Re) having been seen, the servant of the ravisher steals it (Id).
He discloses the matter to Euclio;
by (Ab) him he is presented with the gold, a wife, and a son.
Lest any one should wonder who I am, I will tell you in a few words.
I am the household God of this family, from whose house you have seen me coming forth.
It is now many years that I have been occupying this house, and I inhabited it for the father and the grandfather of this person who now dwells here.
But beseeching me, his grandfather entrusted to me a treasure of gold, unknown to all.
He deposited it in the midst of the hearth2, praying me that I would watch it for him.
He, when he died, was of such an avaricious disposition, that he would never disclose it to his own son, and preferred rather to leave him in want than to show that treasure to that son.
He left him no large quantity of land, on which to live with great laboriousness and in wretchedness.
When he died who had entrusted that gold to me, I began to take notice whether his son would any how pay greater honor to me than his father had paid me.
But he was in the habit of venerating me still less and less by very much, and gave me a still less share of devotion.
So in return was it done by me ;
and he likewise ended his life.
He left this person who now dwells here, his son, of the same disposition as his father and grandfather were.
He has an only daughter;
she is always every day making offerings to me, either with incense, or wine, or some­ thing or other;
she presents me, too, with chaplets.
Out of regard for her, I have caused this Euclio to find this treasure, in order that he might more readily give her in marriage if he should wish;
for a young man of very high rank has ravished her;
this young man knows who it is that he has ravished;
she knows him not, nor yet does her father know that she has been ravished.
This day I shall cause the old gentleman here, our neighbour, to ask her as his wife;
that will I do for this reason, that he may the more easily marry her who has ravished her.
And this old gentleman who shall ask her as his wife, the same is the uncle of that young man who debauched her in the night time at the festival of Ceresl.
But this old fel­ low is now making an uproar in the house, as usual;
he is thrusting the old woman out of doors, that she may not be privy to the secret.
I suppose he wants to look at the gold, if it be not stolen.
Euc.
Get out, I say, be off, get out;
by my troth, you must budge out of this house here, you pryabout woman, with your inquisitive eyes.
STAPH.
Pray why are you beating me, wretched creature that I am ?
Eire.
That you may be wretched, and that, curst as you are, you may pass a curst life, well befitting you.
STAPH.
But for what reason have you now pushed me out of the house ?
Euc.
Am I to be giving you a reason, you whole harvest of whipsl.
Get away there from the door !
There, do look, if you please, how she does creep along.
But do you know how matters stand with you ?
If I just now take a stick or a whip in my hand, I'll quicken that tortoise pace for you.
STAPH.
0 that the Gods would drive me to hang myself, rather indeed than that I should be a slave in your house on these terms!
ETc.
Hark how the hag is grumbling to herself!
By my troth, you wretch, I'll knock out those eyes of yours, that you mayn't be able to watch me, what business I'm about.
Get out (pushes her with his hands )-further yet!
still further!
further !
There now, stand you there !
By my faith, if you budge a finger's breadth, or a nail's width from that spot, or if you look back until I shall order you, i' faith, I'll give you up at once as a trainer for the gibbet.
(Aside.)
I know for sure that I did never see one more accursed than this bag, and I'm sadly in fear of her, lest she should be cheating me unawares, or be scenting it out where the gold is concealed, a most vile wretch, who has eyes in the back of her head as well.
Now I'll go and see whether the gold is just as I concealed it, that so troubles wretched me in very many ways.
(He goes into his house.)STAPH.
By heavens, I cannot now conceive what mis fortune, or what insanity, I am to say has befallen my master;
in such a way does he often, ten times in one day, in this fashion push wretched me out of the house.
I' faith, I know not what craziness does possess this man;
whole nights is he on the watch;
then, too, all the day long does he sit faT whole days together at home like a lame cobbler1.
Nor can I imagine now by what means to conceal the disgrace of my master's daughter, whose lying-in approaches near;
and there isn't anything better for me, as I fancy, than to make one long capital letter2 of myself, when I've tied up my neck in a halter.
Euc. (to himself).
Now, with my mind at ease, at length I go out of my house, after I've seen that everything is safe in-doors.
Now do you return at once into the house (to STAPHYLA), and keep watch in-doors.
STAPH.
Keep watch in-doors upon nothing at all, forsooth.
or is it, that no one may carry the house away.
For here in our house there's nothing else for thieves to gain, so filled is it with emptiness3 and cobwebs.
Euc.
'Tis a wonder that, for your sake, Jupiter doesn't now make me a King Philip, or a Darius4, you hag of hags.
I choose those cobwebs to be watched for me.
I am poor, I confess it—I put up with it.
What the Gods send, I endure.
Go in-doors, shut to the door, I shall be there directly.
Take you care not to let any strange person into the house.
STAPH.
What if any person asks for fire ?
Euc.
I wish it to be put out, that there may be no cause for any one asking it of you.
But if the fire shall be kept in, you yourself shall be forthwith extinguished.
Then do you say that the water has run out5, if any one asksfor it.
STAPH.
The knife, the hatchet, the pestle and mortar, utensils that neighbours are always asking the loan ofEuc.
Say that thieves have come and carried them off.
In fact, in my absence, I wish no one to be admitted into my house;
and this, too, do I tell you beforehand, if Good Luck should come, don't you admit her.
STAPH.
I' faith, she takes good care, I think, not to be ad­ mitted ;
for though close at handl, she has never come to our house.
Euc.
Hold your tongue, and go in-doors.
STAPH.
I'll hold my tongue, and be off.
EUC.
Shut the door, please, with both bolts.
I shall be there directly.
(STAPHYLA goes into the house.)
I'm lor­ mented in my mind, because I must go away from my house!
I' faith, I go but very unwillingly;
but I know full well what I'm about;
for the person that is our master of our ward2 has given notice that he will distribute a didrachm of silver to each man;
if I relinquish that, and don't ask for it, at once I fancy that all will be suspecting that I've got gold at home;
for it isn't very likely that a poor man would despise ever such a trifle, so as not to ask for his piece of money.
For as it is, while I am carefully concealing it from all, lest they should know, all seem to know it, and all salute me more civilly than they formerly used to salute me ;
they come up to me, they stop, they shake hands3;
they ask me how I am, what I'm doing, what business I'm about.
Now I'll go there whither I had set out1;
afterwards, I'll betake myself back again home as fast as ever I can.
EuN.
I could wish you, brother, to think that I utter these words by reason of my own regard and your welfare, as is be­ fitting your own sister to do.
Although I'm not unaware that we women are accounted troublesome ;
for we are all of us deservedly considered very talkative, and, in fact, they say at the present day that not a single woman has been found dumb2 in any age.
Still, brother, do you consider this one circumstance, that I am your nearest relation, and you in like manner are mine.
How proper it is that I should counsel and advise you, and you me, as to what we may judge for the in­ terest of each of us;
and for it not to be kept concealed or kept silence upon through apprehension, but rather that I should make you my confidant, and you me in like manner.
For that reason, now, have I brought you here apart out of doors, that I might here discourse with you upon your private concerns.
lEG.
Best of women, give me your hand.
(Takes her hand.)EuN. (looking about).
Where is she?
Who, pray, is this best of women ?
MEa.
Yourself.
EUN.
Do you say so ?
MEG.
If you say no, I say no.
Eux.
Indeed, it's right that the truth should be spoken;
for the best of women can nowhere be found;
one is only) worse than another, brother.
MEG.
I think the same, and I'm determined never to con­ tradict you on that point, sister.
What do you wish ?
EUN.
Give me your attention, I beg of you.
MEG.
'Tis at your service ;
use and command me, please, if you wish for aught.
EUN.
A thing that I consider very greatly for your advan­ tage I'm come to recommend you.
MEG.
Sister, you are doing after your usual manner.
EUN.
I wish it were done.
MEG.
What is it, sister ?
EUN.
That you may enjoy!
everlasting blessings in being the father of children.
MEa.
May the Gods so grant it.
EUN.
I wish you to bring home a wife.
MEa.
Ha!
I'in undone.
EUN.
How so ?
MEG.
Because, sister, your words are knocking out the brains of unfortunate me ;
you are speaking stolles2.
EUN.
Well, well, do this that your sister requests you.
MEG.
If she requests me, I will do it.
EUN.
'Tis for your own interest.
MEG.
Yes, for me to die before I marry.
Let her who comes here to-morrow, be carried out3 of the house the day after, sister;
on that con­ dition, give me her whom you wish to give;
get ready the nuptials.
EUN.
I am able, brother, to provide you with a wife with a very large marriage-portion.
But she's somewhat aged;
she's of the middle-age of woman.
If you request me, brother, to ask her for you, I'll ask her.
AEG.
Would you like me to ask you a question ?
EUN.
Yes, if you like, ask it.
AEG.
Suppose any old man, past mid-age, brings home a middle-aged wife, if by chance he should have a child by this old woman, do you doubt at all but that the name of that child is Posthumus4, all prepared ?
Now, sister, I'll remove and lessen this labour for you.
I, by the merits of the Gods and of my forefathers, am rich enough ;
these high families, haughty pridel, bountiful portions, acclamations, imperious­ ness, vehicles inlaid with ivory, superb mantles and purple, I can't abide, things that by their extravagance reduce men to slavery..
EUN.
Tell me, pray, who is she whom you would like to take for a wife ?
MEG.
I'll tell you.
Do you know that Euclio, the poor old man close by ?EUN.
I know him ;
not a bad sort of man, i' faith.
MEG.
I'd like his maiden daughter to be promised me in marriage.
Don't make any words2 about it, sister;
I know what you are going to say ;
that she's poor.
This poor girl pleases me.
EUN.
May the Gods prosper it.
MEG.
I hope the same.
EUN.
What do you want me now for ?
Do you wish for anything ?
lEG. Farewell.
EUN.
And you the same, brother.
(Goes into the house.)MEG.
I'll-go meet Euclio, if he's at home.
But, see!
the very person is betaking himself home, whence, I know not.
Eire. (to himself).
My mind had a presentiment that I was going to no purpose when I left my house;
and therefore I went unwillingly;
for neither did any one of the wardsmen come, nor yet the master of the ward, who ought to have dis­ tributed the money.
Now I'm making all haste to hasten home;
for I myself am here, my mind's at home.
MEG. (accosting him).
May you be well, and ever for­ tunate, Euclio!
Eire.
May the Gods bless you, Megadorus!
MEG.
How are you ?
Are you quite well, and as you wish ?Euc. (aside).
It isn't for nothing when a rich man accosts a poor man courteously;
now this fellow knows that I've got some gold;
for that reason he salutes me more cour­ teously.
MEG.
Do you say that you are well ?
Eto.
Troth, I'm not very well in the money line.
MEG.
I' faith, if you've a contented mind, you have enough to passing a good life with.
Eue. (aside).
By my faith, the old woman has made a dis­ covery to him about the gold;
'tis clear it's all out.
I'll cut off her tongue, and tear out her eyes, when I get home.
MEG.
Why are you talking to yourself?
Euc.
I'm lamenting my poverty;
I've a grown-up girl without a portion, and one that can't be disposed of in marriage;
nor have I the ability to marry her to anybody.
lEG.
Hold your peace ;
be of good courage, Euclio :
she shall be given in marriage ;
you shall be assisted by myself.
Say, if you have need of aught;
command me.
Euc. (aside).
Now is he aiming at my property, while he's making promises ;
he's gaping for my gold, that he may de­ vour it;
in the one hand he is carrying a stone1, while lie shows the bread in the other.
I trust no person, who, rich himself, is exceedingly courteous to a poor man;
when he extends his hand with a kind air, then is he loading you with some damage.
I know these polypi2, who, when they've touched a thing, hold it fast.
MEG.
Give me your attention, Euclio, for a little time:
1 wish to address you in a few words, about a common concern of yours and mine.
Eve. (aside).
Alas!
woe is me !
my gold has been grabbed from in-doors :
now he's wishing for this thing, I'in sure, to come to a compromise with me;
but I'll go look in my house.
(He goes towards his door.)MEG.
Where are you going ?
EUC.
I'll return to you directly, for there's something I must go and see to at home.
(He goes into his house.)MEG.
By my troth, I do believe that when I make men­ tion of his daughter, for him to promise her to me, he'll suppose that he's being laughed at by me;
nor is there out of the whole class of paupers one more beggarly than he.
(EUCLIO returns from his house.)Euc. (aside).
The Gods do favour me;
my property's all safe.
If nothing's lost, it's safe.
I was very dreadfully afraid, before I went in-doors!
I was almost dead!
(Aloud.)
I'm come back to you, Megadorus, if you wish to say any­ thing to me.
MEG.
I return you thanks ;
I beg that as to what I shall enquire of you, you'll not hesitate to speak out boldly.
Euc.
So long, indeed, as you enquire nothing that I mayn't choose to speak out upon.
MEG.
Tell me, of what sort of family do you consider me to be sprung ?
Euc.
Of a good one.
MEG.
What think you as to my character ?
Euc.
'Tis a good one.
MEG.
What of my conduct ?
Euc. Neither bad nor dishonest.
MEG.
Do you know my years ?
Euc. 1 know that they are plentiful, just like your money.
MEG.
I' faith, for sure I really did always take you to be a citizen without any evil guile, and now I think you so..
EUC. (aside).
He smells the gold.
(Aloud.)
What do you want with me now ?
MEG.
Since you know me, and I know you, what sort of person you are-a thing, that may it bring a blessing on my- self, and you and your daughter, I ask your daughter as my wife.
Promise me that it shall be so.
Buc. Heyday!
Megadorus, you are doing a deed that's not becoming to your usual actions, in laughing at me, a poor man, and guiltless towards yourself and towards your family For neither in act, nor in words, have I ever deserved it of you, that you should do what you are now doing.
lEG.
By my troth, I neither am come to laugh at you, nor am I laughing at you, nor do I think you deserving of it.
Buc.
Why then do you ask for my daughter for your self?
MEG.
That through me it may be better for you, and through you and yours for me.
Buc.
This suggests itself to my mind, Megadorus, that you are a wealthy man, a man of rank;
that I likewise am a person, the poorest of the poor;
now, if I should give my daughter in marriage to you, it suggests itself to my mind that you are the ox, and that I am the ass;
when I'm yoked to you, and when I'm not able to bear the burden equally with yourself, I, the ass, must lie down in the mire;
you, the ox, would regard me no more than if I had never been born;
and I should both find you unjust, and my own class would laugh at me ;
in neither direction should I have a fixed stall, if there should be any separationl;
the asses would tear me with their teeth, the oxen would butt at me with their horns.
This is the great hazard, in my passing over from the asses to the oxen.
MEG.
The nearer you can unite yourself in alliance with the virtuous, so much the better.
Do you receive this pro­ posal, listen to me, and promise her to me.
Euc.
But indeed there is no marriage-portion.
MEG.
You are to give none;
so long as she comes with good principles, she is sufficiently portioned.
Euc.
I say so for this reason, that you mayn't be sup­ posing that I have found any treasures.
MEG.
I know that;
don't enlarge upon it.
Promise her to me.
Eire.
So be it.
(Starts and looks about.)
But, 0 Jupi­ ter, am I not utterly undone ?
MEG.
What's the matter with you ?
Euc.
What was it sounded just now as though it were iron?
MEe.
Here at my place, I ordered them to dig up the garden.
(EUCLIO runs offinto his house.)
But where is this man ?
He's off, and he hasn't fully answered me;
he treats me with contempt.
Because he sees that I wish for his friend­ ship, he acts after the manner of mankind.
For if a wealthy person goes to ask a favour of a poorer one, the poor man is afraid to treat with him ;
through his apprehension he hurts his own interest.
The same person, when this opportunity is lost, too late, then wishes for it.
EUC.
(coming out of the house, addressing STAPHYLA within).
By the powers, if I don't give you up to have your tongue cut out by the roots, I order and I authorize you to hand me over to any one you please to be incapacitated.
MEG.
By my troth, Euclio, I perceive that you consider me a fit man for you to make sport of in my old age, for no deserts of my own.
Euc.
I' faith, Megadorus, I am not doing so, nor, should I desire it, bad I the means1.
lEG.
How now ?
Do you then betroth your daughter to me ?
Euc.
On those terms, and with that portion which I men tioned to you.
MEG.
Do you promise her then ?
Euc.
I do promise her.
MEG.
May the Gods bestow their blessings on it.
Euc. May the Gods so do.
Take you care of this, and remember that we've agreed, that my daughter is not to bring you any portion.
MEG.
I remember it.
EUC.
But I understand in what fashion you, of your class, are wont to equivocate ;
an agree ment is no agreement, no agreement is an agreement, just as it pleases you.
MEG.
I'll have no misunderstanding with you.
But what reason is there why we shouldn't have the nuptials this day ?
Euc.
Why, by my troth, there is very good reason for them.
MEG.
I'll go, then, and prepare matters.
Do you want me in any way ?
Eire.
That shall be done.
Fare you well.
MEG. (going to the door of his house and calling out).
Hallo !
Strobilus, follow me quickly, in all haste, to the flesh- market.
(Exit MEGADORUS.
Euc.
He has gone hence.
Immortal Gods, I do beseech you !
How powerful is gold!
I do believe, now, that he has had some intimation that JIve got a treasure at home ;
he's gaping for that;
for the sake of that has he persisted in this alliance.
Euc. (going to the door of his house, he opens it, and calls to STAPHYLA within).
Where are you who have now been blabbing to all my neighbours that I'm going to give a por­ tion to my daughter?
Hallo!
Staphyla, I'm calling you!
Don't you hear ?
Make haste in-doors there, and wash the vessels clean.
I've promised my daughter in marriage;
to- day I shall give her to be married to Megadorus here.
STAPH. (as she enters).
May the Gods bestow their bless­ ings on it!
But, i' faith, it cannot be;
'tis too sudden.
Euc.
Hold your tongue, and be off.
Take care that things are ready when I return home from the Forum, and shut the house up.
I shall be here directly.
(-Exit.STAPH.
What now am I to do ?
Now is ruin near at hand for us, both for myself and my master's daughter;
for her disgrace and her delivery are upon the very point of becoming known;
that which even until now has been concealed and kept secret, cannot be so now.
I'll go in-doors, that what my master ordered may be done when he comes.
But, by my faith, I do fear that 1 shall have to drink of a mixture of bitterness1!
(Exit.STRO.
After my master had bought the provisions, and hired the cooks2 and these music-girls in the market-place, he ordered me to divide these provisions into two parts.
CON.
By my troth, but you really shan't be dividing mes, tell you plainly.
If you wish me to go anywhere whole, I'll do my best.
ANTHI.
A very pretty and modest fellow, indeed4.
As if, when you are a conger by name, you wouldn't like to be cut into pieces.
CON.
But, Anthrax, I said that in another sense, and not in the one which you are pretending.
STRO.
Now my master's going to be married to-day.
ANTH.
Whose daughter is he to marry?
STRO.
The daughter of this Euclio, his near neighbour here.
For that reason he has ordered half of these provisions here to be pre­ sented to him—one cook, and one music-girl likewise.
ANTH.
That is, you take one half to him, the other half home ?
STRO.
'Tis just as you say.
ANTH.
How's that ?
Couldn't this old fellow provide from his own resources for the wedding of his daughter.
STRO.
Pshaw!
ANTH.
What's the matter?
STRO.
What's the matter, do you ask ?
A pumice stone isn't so dry as is this old fellow.
ANTE.
Do you really say that it is as you affirm ?
STRO.
Do be judge yourself.
Why, he's for ever crying out for aid from Gods and men, that his property has gone, and that he is ruined root and branch, if the smoke by chance escapes out of doors through the rafters of his house.
Why, when he goes to sleep, he ties a bag1 beneath his gullet.
ANTH.
Why so ?
STRO.
That when he sleeps, he may lose no breath.
ANTH.
And does he stop up the lower part of his wind­ pipe2 as well, lest, perchance, he should lose any breath as he sleeps ?
STRO.
In that 'tis as fair that you should credit me, as it is for me to credit you.
ANTH.
Why really, I do believe you.
STRO.
But, further, do you know how it is ?
I' faith, he grieves to throw away the water when he washes.
ANTH.
Do you think a great talent3 might be begged of this old fellow for him to give us, through which we might be­ come free ?
STRO.
By my troth, if you were to ask it, he would never let you have the loan of hunger.
Why, the other day, the barber had cut his nails4;
he collected all the parings, and carried them off.
ANTH.
I' faith, you do describe a miserably stingy wretch.
CON.
But do you think that he does live so very stingily and wretchedly ?
SiRo.
A kite, the other day, carried off his morsel of food;
the fellow went crying to the Prætor1;
there, weeping and lamenting, he began to request that he might be allowed to compel the kite to give bail.
There are innumerable other things that I could mention, if I had the leisure.
But which of you two is the sharper ?
Tell me.
CoN. I—as being much the better one.
STRO.
A cook I ask for, not a thief2.
Coif.
As a cook, I mean.
STRO. (to ANTHRAX).
What do you say ?
ANTH.
I'm just as you see me.
CON.
He's a nine-day cook1;
every ninth day he's in the habit of going out to cook.
ANTH.
You, you three-lettered fellow2;
do you abuse me, you thief?
CON.
To be sure I do, you trebly-distilled thief of thieves3.
STRO.
Now do you hold your tongue for the present, and, that lamb, whichever is the fatter of the twoCoN.
Very well4.
STRO.
Do you, Congrio, take that, and go in-doors there (pointing to EUCLIO'S house) ;
and (to a MUSIC-GIRL and some of the PEOPLE with provisions) do you follow him;
the rest of you this way, to our house.
CoN.
By my troth, you've made an unfair division;
they've got the fattest lamb.
STRO.
But the fattest music-girl shall be given you then.
Do you, therefore, go along with him, Phrygia5.
And do you, Eleusium, step in-doors here, to our house.
CON.
0 you crafty Strobilus, have you pushed me off here upon this most miserly old fellow, where if I ask for anything, I may ask even to hoarseness before anything's found me ?
STRO.
'Tis very foolish, and 'tis thanklessly done, to do a service to you, when what you do goes for nothing.
CON.
But how so?
STRO.
Do you ask?
In the first place then, there will be no confusion for you there in the house;
if you want anything to use, bring it from your own home, don't lose your trouble in asking for it.
But here, at our house, there's great confusion, and a large establish­ ment—furniture, gold, garments, silver vessels.
If any­ thing's lost here (as I know that you can easily1 keep hands off-if nothing's in your way), they may say, " The cooks have stolen it;
seize them, bind them, beat them, thrust them in the dungeon"2.
Nothing of that sort will happen to you, inasmuch as there will be nothing for you to steal.
Follow me this way.
CON.
I follow.
STRO.

Ho, there!
Staphyla, come out and open the door.
STAPH. (from within).
Who calls there?
STRO.
Strobilus.
STAPH.
What do you want ?
STRO.
For you to take in these cooks, and this music-girl, and these provisions for the wedding.
Megadorus bade me take these things to Euclio.
STAPH.
Are you about to make this wedding, Strobilus, in honor of Ceres3 ?STRO.
Why ?
STAPH.
Because I don't see any wine brought.
STRO.
Why, that will be brought just now, when he himself comes back from the market.
STAPH.
There's.no firewood here in our house.
CON.
There are the beams.
STAPH.
I' faith, there are.
CON.
There is wood, then;
don't you be seeking it out of doors.
STAPH.
What, you unpurified fellow1, although your busi­ ness is with the fire, for the sake of a dinner, or of your own hire, do you request us to set our house on fire ?
CON.
I don't ask you.
STRO.
Take them in-doors.
STAPH.
Follow me.
(They follow her in-doors, and STRO­ BILUS goes with the others into the house of MEGADORUS.)PYTH.
Mind you your business;
I'll step in and see what the cooks are doing, to observe whom, i' faith, to-day it is a most laborious task.
Unless I manage this one thing, for them to cook the dinner down in the dungeon2;
thence, when cooked, we might bring it up again in small baskets.
But if they should eat below3 whatever they should cook, those above would go without their dinner, and those below have dined:
But here am I chattering, as though I had no business, when there's such a pack of thieves in the house.
(Goes into the house.)
Euc.
I wished at length to screw up my courage to-day, so as to enjoy myself at the wedding of my daughter.
I come to the market, I enquire about fish;
they tell me that it is dear, that lamb is dear, beef is dear, veal, large fish4, and pork, all of them are dear.
And for this reason were they still dearer;
I hadn't the money.
I came away thence in a rage, since I had nothing wherewithal to make a purchase and thus did I baulkl all those rascals.
Then I began to think with myself upon the road, " If you are guilty of any extravagance on a festive day, you may be wanting on a common day, unless you are saving."
After I disclosed this reasoning to my heart and appetite, my mind came over to my opinion, that I ought to give my daughter in marriage at as little expense as possible.
Now I've bought a bit of frankincense, and these chaplets of flowers;
these shall be placed upon the hearth for our household God, that he may grant a propitious marriage to my daughter.
But what do I?
Do I behold my house open?
There's a noise, too, within;
is it that I'm robbed, wretch that I am ?CON.
(speaking within the house).
Seek of the neighbours a bigger pot2 if you can ;
this one's too little, it can't hold it.
Euc.
Woe to me !
By my faith, I'm a dead man ;
the gold' being carried off-my pot's being looked for.
I am certain!
murdered, unless I make haste to run with all haste in doors here!
Apollo, prithee do assist and help me, who thou hast already, before this, helped in such circumstances Pierce with thine arrows the plunderers of my treasures.
Bu am I delaying to run, before I perish outright.
Be run into his house.)ANTH. (speaking to some within).
Dromo, do you scale the fish.
Do you, Machærio, have the conger and the lampre boned.
I'm going to ask the loan of a baking-pall our neighbour Congrio.
You, if you are wise, will have that capon more smoothly picked for me than is a plucked play­ actorl.
But what's this clamour that's arising here hard by ?
By my faith, the cooks, I do believe, are at their usual pranks2.
I'll run in-doors, lest there may be any disturbance here for me as well.
(Retreats into the house of MEGADORUS.)CoN. (roaring out).
Beloved fellow-citizens, fellow-country­ men, inhabitants, neighbours, and all strangers, do make way for me to escape!
Make all the streets clear!
Never have 1 at any time, until this day, come to Bacchants3, in a Baccha­ nalian den, to cook;
so sadly have they mauled wretched me and my scullions with their sticks.
I'm aching all over, and am utterly done for;
that old fellow has so made a bruising school4 of me;
and in such a fashion has he turned us all out of the house, myself and them, laden with sticks.
Nowhere, in all the world, have I ever seen wood dealt out more plen­ tifully.
Alackaday!
by my faith, to my misery, I'm done for;
the Bacchanalian den is opening, here he comes.
He's following us.
I know the thing I'll do:
that the master himself5 has taught me.
Euc. (ealling out, while CONGRIO and the others are run- ning off).
Come back!
Where are you running to, now ?
Hold you!
CON.
Why are you crying out, you stupid ?
Euc.
Because this instant I shall give your name to the Triumvirsl.
CON.
Why ?
Euc.
Because you've got a knife.
CON.
'Tis the proper thing for a cook.
Euc.
Why did you threaten me ?
CON.
I think that it was badly managed, that I didn't pierce your side with it.
Euc.
There's not a person that's living this day a greater rascal than you, nor one to whom designedly I would with greater pleasure cause a mischief.
CON.
I' faith, though2 you should hold your noise, really that's quite clear;
the thing itself is its own witness.
As it is, I'm made softer by far with your sticks than any ballet­ dancer.
But what right have you to touch us, you beggar­ man ?
What's the matter ?
Buc.
Do you even ask me ?
Is it that I've done less than I ought to have done ?
Only let me(Is going to strike him.)CON.
Now, by my faith, at your great peril, if this head should feel it!
Euc.
Troth, I don't know what may happen3 hereafter;
your head feels it just now!
But what business, pray, had you in my house, in my absence, unless I had ordered you ?
I want to know that.
CON.
Hold your noise, then;
because we came to cook for the wedding.
EUC.
Why the plague do you trouble yourself whether I eat meat raw or cooked, unless you are my tutor1.
CON.
I want to know if you will allow or not allow us to cook the dinner here ?
Euc.
I, too, want to know whether my property will be safe in my house.
CON.
I only wish to carry the things away safe that I brought here!
I don't care for yours ;
should I be coveting your things ?
Euc.
I understand;
don't teach me;
I know.
CON.
What is it, on account of which you now hinder us from cooking the dinner here ?
What have we done ?
What have we said to you otherwise than you could wish ?
Euc.
Do you even ask me, you rascally fellow?
You who've been making a thoroughfare of every corner of my house, and the places under lock and key ?
If you had stopped by the fireside, where it was your business, you wouldn't have had your head broken.
It has been done for you deservedly
Therefore that you may now know my determination;
if you come nearer to the door here, unless I order you, I'll make you to be the most wretched of creatures.
Do you now know my determination ?
(He goes into his house.)CON.
Where are you going ?
Come you back again !
So may Laverna2 love me well, I'll expose you at once with loud abuse here before the house, if you don't order my utensils to be restored to me!
What shall I do now ?
Verily, by my faith, I came here with unlucky auspices ;
I was hired for a didrachm3;
I stand in more need now of a surgeon than of wages.
Euc. (to himself, as he enters).
This, by my faith, wherever I shall go, really shall be with me, and with myself will I carry it, nor will I ever again entrust it to that place, for it to be in such great peril.
(Speaking to CONGRIO and his SCUL­ LIONS.)
Now, then, go you all of you in the house, cooks and music-girls ;
introduce even, if you like, a whole company of hirelings1;
cook, bustle, and hurry now at once just as much as you please.
CON. 0 dear, I'm a ruined man.
Euc.
Be off!
your labour was hired here, not your talk.
CON.
Harkye, old gentleman, for the beating, by my faith, I shall demand of you a recompense.
I was hired a while ago to cook, and not to be basted.
Euc. Proceed against me at law!
Don't be troublesome!
Either cook .
the dinner, or away with you from the house to downright perdition!
CON.
Go there yourself then.
(CONGRIO and the COOKS and MUSIC-GIRL go back into the house.)
Euc.
He's gone.
Immortal Gods!
A poor man, who begins to have dealings or business with an opulent one, commences upon a rash undertaking!
Thus, for instance, Megadorus who has pretended that, for the sake of honoring me, he sends these cooks hither, is plaguing unfortunate me in every way;
for this reason has he sent them, that they might purloin this (putting his hand on the pot) from unfortunate me.
Just as I might expect, even my dunghill-cock in-doors, that was bought with the old woman's savings2, had well nigh been the ruin of me;
where this was buried, he began to scratch there all round about with his claws.
What need of more words ?
So exasperated were my feelings, I took a stick, and knocked off the head of the cock—a thief caught in the act.
I' faith, I do believe that the cooks had promised a reward to the cock, if he should discover it;
I took the opportunity1 out of their hands, however.
What need of many words ?
I had a regu­ lar battle!! with the dunghill-cock.
But see, my neighbour Megadorus is coming from the Forum.
I can't, then, venture to pass by him, but I must stop and speak to him.
(He retires close to his door.)MEG. (to himself).
I've communicated to many friends my design about this proposal;
they speak in high terms of the daughter of Euclio.
They say that it was discreetly done, and with great prudence.
But, in my opinion, indeed, if the other richer men were to do the same, so as to take home as their wives, without dower, the daughters of the poorer persons, both the state would become much more united, and we should meet with less ill feeling than we now meet with ;
both, they, the wives, would stand in fear of punishment more than they do stand in fear of it, and we husbands should be at less expense than we now are.
In the greater part of the people this is a most just way of thinking ;
in the smaller portion there is an objection among the avaricious, whose avaricious minds and insatiate dispositions there is neither law nor ma­ .
gistrate to be able to put a check upon.
But a person may say this;
"
How are these rich women with portions to marry, if this law is laid down for the poor ?"
Let them marry whom they please, so long as the dowry isn't their companion.
If this were so done, the women would acquire for themselves better manners for them to bring, in place of dowry, than they now bring.
I'd make mules, which exceed horses in price, to become cheaper than Gallic geldings3.
Euo. (aside).
So may the Gods favour me, I listen to him with delight;
very shrewdly has he discoursed on the side of economy.
MEG. (to himself) .
No wife should then be saying:
" In­ deed, I brought you a marriage-portion far greater than was your own wealth ;
why, it really is fair that purple and gold should be found for me, maid-servants, mules, muleteers, and lacqueys1, pages to carry2 compliments, vehicles in which I may be carried."Euc. (aside).
How thoroughly he does understand the doings of the wives!
I wish he were made Prefect of the manners of the women.
MEG. (tohimself).
Now, go whereyouwill,you may see more carriages3 among the houses than in thecountrywhenyou go to a farm-house.
But this is even light, in comparison with wher.
they ask for their allowance;
there stands the scourer4, the embroiderer, the goldsmith, the woollen-manufacturer, retail dealers in figured skirts5, dealers in women's under-clothing6, dyers in flame-colour, dyers in violet, dyers in wax-colour1, or else steeve-makers2, or perfumers3;
wholesale linendrapers, shoemakers, squatting cobblers, slipper-makers ;
sandal- makers stand there ;
stainers in mallow colour stand there ;
hairdressers4 make their demands, botchers their demands;
boddice-makers5 stand there;
makers of kirtles6 take their stand.
Now you would think them got rid of;
these make way, others make their demands;
three hundred duns7 are standing in your hall;
weavers, lace-makers1, cabinet­ makers2, are introduced;
the money's paid them.
You would think them got rid of by this ;
when dyers in saffron- colours come sneaking along ;
or else there's always some horrid plague or other which is demanding something.
Buc. (aside).
I would accost him, if I didn't fear that he would cease to descant upon the ways of women;
for the present I'll leave him as he is.
MEG.
When the money has been paid to all the nicknack­ mongers, for these saffron-coloured garments and stomachers, your wife's expenses, then at the last comes the tax-gatherer3 and asks for money.
You go, your account is being made up with your banker4;
the tax-gatherer waits, half-starved, and thinks the money will be paid.
When the account has been made up with the banker, even already is the husband himself in debt to the banker, and the hopes of the tax-gatherer are postponed to another day.
These, and many others, are the inconveniences and intolerable expenses of great portions;
but she who is without portion is in the power of her hus­ band;
the portioned ones overwhelm their husbands with loss and ruin.
But see;
here's my connexion by marriage before the house!
How do you do, Euclio ?
Euc.
With very great pleasure have I listened to your discourse.
MEo.
Did you hear me?
Euc.
Everything from the very beginning.
MEG.
(eyeing him from head to foot).
Still, in my way of thinking indeed, you would be acting a little more becomingly if you were more tidy at the wedding of your daughter.
Euc.
Those who have display according to their circum- stances and splendour according to their means1, remember themselves, from whence they are sprung;
neither by myself, Megadorus, nor by any poor man, are better circumstances enjoyed than appearances warrant.
MEG.
Surely they are;
and may the Gods, I hope, make them so to be, and more and more may they prosper that which you now possess.
Euc. (aside).
That expression don't please me, "which you now possess."
He knows that I've got this, as well as I do myself:
the old woman has discovered it to him.
MEe.
Why do you separate yourself thus alone, apart from the Senate2 ?Euc.
Troth, I was considering whether I should accuse you deservedly.
MEG.
What's the matter ?
Euc.
Do yon ask me what's the matter ?
You who have filled every corner in my house, for wretched me, with thieves ?
You who have introduced into my dwelling five hundred cooks, with six hands a-piece, of the race of Geryon3, whom were Argus to watch, who was eyes all over, that Juno once set as a spy upon Jupiter, he never could watch them ;
a music-girl besides, who could alone drink up for me the Corinthian fountain of Pirene4, if it were flowing with wine ?
And then as to provisions- MEG.
Troth, there's enough for a procurer5 even.
I sent as much as a lamb.
Euc.
Than which lamb, I, indeed, know right well that there is nowhere a more curiousl beast existing.
MEG.
I wish to know of you why is this lamb curious ?
Euc.
Because it's all skin and bone, so lean is it with care;
why, even when alive, by the light of the sun you may look at its entrails ;
it's lust as transparent as a Punic lantern2.
MEG.
I bought it to be killed.
EUC.
Then it's best that you likewise should bargain for3 it to be carried out for burial;
for I believe it's dead by this time.
lEG.
Euclio, I wish this day to have a drinking with you.
Euc.
By my troth, I really must not drink.
MEG.
But I'll order one cask of old wine to be brought from my house.
Euc.
I' faith, I won't have it;
for I've determined to drink water.
MEG.
I'll have you well drenched this day, if I live, you who have determined to drink water.
Euc. (aside).
I know what plan he's upon;
he's aiming at this method, to overcome me with wine, and after that, to change the settlement4 of what I possess:
I'll take care of that, for I'll hide it somewhere out of doors.
I'll make him lose his wine and his trouble together.
MEG.
Unless you want me for anything, I'm going to bathe, that I may sacrifice.
(He goes into his house.)
Euc.
By my faith, you pot (taking it from under his cloak), you surely have many enemies, and that gold as well which is entrusted to you!
Now this is the best thing to be done by me, to take you away, my pot, to the Temple of Faith1, where I'll hide you carefully.
Faith, thou dost know me, and I thee;
please, do have a care not to change thy name against me, if I entrust this to thee.
Faith, I'll come to thee, relying on thy fidelity.
(He goes into the Temple of Faith.)STRO.
This is the duty of a good servant, to do what I'm intending, not to consider the commands of his master a bore or trouble to him.
For that servant who resolves to serve his master with hearty goodwill, him it behoves to act expeditiously for his master, slowly for himself;
but if he sleeps, let him so sleep as to bethink himself that he is a servant.
But he who lives in servitude to one in love, as I am serving, if.
he sees love overcoming his master, this I think to be the duty of the servant;
to restrain him for his safety, not to impel him onwards towards his own inclina- tion.
Just as a float of bulrushes is placed beneath boys who are learning to swim, by means of which they may labour less, so as to swim more easily and move their hands ;
in the same way do I consider that it is proper for the servant to be a buoy to his master thus in love, so as to bear him up lest he should go to the bottom;
and so * * * * should he learn the will of his master, that his eyes should know what his mouth chooses not to speak.
What he orders, he should hasten to perform more swiftly than the swift steeds.
He who shall have a care for these things, will escape the castigation of the ox's hide, nor by his own means will he ever bring the fetters to brightness.
Now, my master's in love with the daugh­ ter of this poor man, Euclio ;
word has just now been brought to my master that she is given to Megadorus here:
he has sent me here to spy out, that he may be made acquainted with the things that are going on.
Now, without any sus­ picion, I'll sit here by the sacred altar1.
From this spot I shall be able, in this direction and that, to witness what they are about.
(He sits by the altar, and on seeing EUCLIO, hides behind it.)Euc. 0 Goddess Faith, do thou but take care not to dis­ cover to any person that my gold is there.
I have no fear that any one will find it, so well is it concealed in its hiding- place.
By my troth, he will surely have a charming booty there, if any one shall meet with that pot loaded with gold.
But I entreat thee, Faith, to hinder that.
Now I shall go wash me, that I may perform the sacrifice;
so that I may not delay my new connexion by marriage, but that, when he sends to me, he may forthwith take my daughter home.
Over and over again now, Goddess Faith, do thou take care that I shall carry away the pot safe from thy Temple.
To thy fidelity2 have I entrusted the gold;
in thy grove and Temple is it placed.
(Goes into his house.)STRO. (coming from behind the altar).
Immortal Gods, what a deed did I hear this person speaking of, how that he had hidden here, in the Temple of Faith, a pot filled with gold;
prithee, beware you, how you are more faithful to him than to myself!
And he, as I fancy, is the father of her whom my master's in love with.
I'll go hence into it;
I'll tho­ roughly ransack the Temple, to see if I can anywhere find the gold, while he's engaged.
But if I do find it, 0 Goddess Faith, I'll offer to thee a gallon jug1 full of honeyed wine, that I'll surely offer to thee;
but I'll drink it up myself, when I have offered it.
(Retreats behind the altar.)Euc. (to himself).
It wasn't for nothing that the raven was just now croaking on my left hand2 ;
he was both scratching the ground with his feet and croaking with his voice.
At once my heart began to jump about3, and to leap within my breast.
But why do I delay to run ?
(He discovers STRO­ BILUS, and drags him from behind the altar.)
Out, out, you earthworm4, who have this instant crept out of the earth;
who just now were nowhere seen, and now that you are seen shall die for it.
By my faith, you juggler, I'll receive you now after a disagreable fashion.
(Begins to shake and beat him.)STRO.
What the curst plague does ail you ?
What busi­ ness have you with me, old fellow ?
Why do you torment me ?
Why are you dragging me ?
For what reason are you beating me ?
Euc.
You out-and-out whipping-post, do you even ask that, you, not thief, but thrice-dotted thief.
STRO.
What have I stolen from you ?
Euc.
Give me that back here, if you please.
STRO.
What do you want me to give you back?
Euc.
Do you ask me that?
STRO.
As for me, I've taken nothing away from you.
Euc.
But give up that which you have taken away for yourself.
Are you going to do so ?
STRO.
Do what ?
Euc.
You can't carry it off.
STRO.
What do you want ?
Euc. Lay it down.
STRO.
Troth, for my part, I think that you are in the habit1 of quizzing, old gentleman.
Euc.
Put that down, please;
cease your quibbling;
I'm not trifling now.
STRO.
What am I to put down ?
Why don't you men­ tion it, whatever it is, by its own name ?
By my faith, I really have neither taken nor touched anything.
Euc.
Show me your hands, here.
STRO.
Well, I do show them ;
see, here they are.
(Holding out his hands.)
Euc.
I see them.
Come, show me the third2, as well.
STRO. (aside).
Sprites, and frenzy, and madness, possess this old fellow.
Are you doing me an injustice, or not ?
Euc.
A very great one, I confess, inasmuch as you are not strung up ;
and that too shall be done this moment, un­ less you do confess.
STRO.
What am I to confess to you ?
ELe.
What it was you took away hence.
STRO.
May the Gods confound me, if I've taken away anything of yours, (aside) and if I don't wish I had taken it away.
EUC.
Come then, shake out your cloak.
STRO.
At your pleasure.
(Shakes it.)Euc.
You haven't it among your under-clothing ?
STRO.
Search where you please.
Euc. Pshaw!
how civilly the rascal speaks, that I mayn't suppose he has taken it away!
I know your tricks.
Come, show me here again that right hand.
STRO.
Here it is.
(-Extending it.)
Euc.
Now show me your left.
STRO.
Well, then, I show you both, in fact.
(Extending them.)Euc.
Now I leave off searching.
Give back that here.
STRO.
Give back what ?
Euc.
Are you trifling with me ?
You certainly have got it.
STRO.
I, got it ?
Got what ?
Euc.
I shan't say;
you want to hear.
Whatever you have of mine, give it back.
STRO.
You are mad;
you've searched me all over at your own pleasure, and yet you've found nothing of yours in my possession.
Eue. (starting).
Stop, stop;
who was that?
Who was the other1 that was within here, together with yourself?
Troth, I'm undone;
he's now rummaging about within.
If I let this one go, he'll escape.
At last, I've now searched this one all over;
he has got nothing.
Be off where you please;
Jupiter and the Gods confound you!
STRO.
He returns his thanks not amiss2.
Euc.
I'll go in here now, and I'll at once throttle this accomplice of yours.
Will you not fly hence from my sight ?
Will you away from here, or no ?
STRO.
I'm off.
Euc.
Take you care, please, how I see you.
(He goes into the Temple.)STRO.
I would rather that I were dead outright, by a shocking death, than not lay an ambush this day for that old fellow.
But he'll not venture now to hide his gold here;
he'll now be carrying it with him, I guess, and be changing the spot.
But hark!
there's a noise at the door.
(Looking in the direction of the Temple.)
See, the old fellow's bringing out the gold with him!
Meanwhile, I'll step aside here to the door.
(Conceals himself near the door.)Euc. (to himself).
I had thought that there was the very greatest dependence upon Faith;
very nearly had she played me a pretty trick1.
If the raven hadn't come to my assist­ ance, to my sorrow I should have been undone.
Troth, I very much wish that raven would come to me which gave me the warning, that I might say something kind to him ;
for I would as soon give2 him something to eat as lose it.
Now I'm thinking of a lonely spot where I shall bide this.
The grove of Sylvanus, outside of the wall, is unfrequented, and planted with many a willow;
there will I choose a spot.
I'm determined to trust Sylvanus3, rather than Faith.
(-Exit.STRO. (re-appearing from his hiding-place).
Capital!
capi­ tal!
the Gods will me to be safe and preserved!
Now will I run before to that place, and climb up into some tree, and thence will I watch where the old fellow hides the gold.
Although my master bade me remain here, I'm resolved rather to risk a mishap along with emolument.
(Exit.LTC.
I've told you all, mother;
as well as I do myself, you understand all about the daughter of Euclio.
Now, I do entreat you, my mother, make mention of it to my uncle, and I now unask of you, mother, that which before I en­ treated of you, to conceal this from Megadorus.
EUN.
You know, yourself, that what you desire to be done, I desire, and I trust that I shall obtain this of my brother;
and the reason is good, if 'tis so as you say, that in a drunken fit you debauched this damsel.
LYC.
Could I, my mother, tell a falsehood in your presence ?(PHÆDRA cries out in labour, in EUCLIO’S house.)
I die, my nurse ;
my pangs are coming on!
I entreat thee for thy protection, Juno Lucina1!
Lyc.
Ah!
my mother, I see a more convincing proof for you;
she's crying aloud—she's in the pangs of labour.
EUN.
Come in-doors here, with me, my son, to my brother, that I may obtain a grant from him of that which you beg of me.
Lyc.
Go;
I'll follow you this instant, mother.
(EUNOMIA goes into the house.)
But my servant, Strobilus, I wonder where he is, whom I ordered to wait here for me.
Now I reflect with myself, if he's lending me his assistance, it isn't fair that I should be angry with him.
I'll go in-doors, where they are sitting in judgment2 upon my life.
( Goes into the house of MEGADORUS.)STRO.
I, by myself, exceed the riches of the Griffins3, who inhabit the golden mountains.
For I'm unwilling to make mention of those other kings, beggarly fellows—I am the king Philip.
0 charming day!
for when I went from here, just now, I arrived there much the first, and, long before, I placed myself in a tree, and thence observed where the old fellow hid the gold.
When he departed thence, I let myself down from the tree, and dug up the pot full of gold.
Thence, from that spot, I saw the old fellow betaking himself back again;
he didn't see me, for I turned a little on one side, out of the path.
Heyday!
here he comes himself.
I'll go and hide this away, at home.
(Goes into the house of MEGADORUS.)Euc.
I'm ruined!
I'm done for!
I'm murdered!
Whither shall I run?
Whither not run?
Stop him—stop him.
Whom?
who ?
I don't know.
I see nothing!
I'm going blindfold;
and, in fact, whither I am going, or where I am, or who I am, I can't in my mind find out for certain.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
I beseech you, give me your aid (I beg and entreat of you), and point me out the person that has taken it away.
What's the matter ?
Why do you laugh ?
I'm acquainted with you all;
I know that there are many thieves here, who conceal them­ selves with white clothes and chalk1, and sit as though they were honest!
(To one of the SPECTATORS.)
What say you?
You I'm resolved to believe;
for I perceive, even by your looks, that you are honest.
Well then, none of these has got it ?
You've been the death of me!
Tell me, then, who has got it ?
You don't know ?
Oh, wretched, wretched me!
I'm done for!
wofully undone!
In most sorry plight I go;
so much groan­ ing, and misfortune, and sorrow, has this day brought upon me, hunger and poverty, too.
I'm the most utterly ruined of all men upon the earth!
For what need of life have I, who have lost so much gold that I so carefully watched ?
I pinched myself, and my inclinations, and my very heart1!
Now others are rejoicing at this, my loss and my misfortune!
I cannot endure it.
(He runs about, crying and stamping.)LYC.
What person, I wonder, is this before our house lamenting, and that utters complaints with his moaning?
Why,surely, this is Euclio, as I imagine.
I'm utterly undone!
The thing's all out;
he knows now, as I suppose, that his daughter is brought to bed.
l'in in a state of uncertainty now what I shall do, whether go or remain, accost him or fly.
Euc.
What person is it that speaks there ?
Lyc. 'Tis I, wretch that I am.
Eire.
Yes, and so am I, and wretchedly ruined, whose lot is misfortune so great and sorrow.
Lie.
Be of good courage.
Euc.
How, prithee, can I be so ?
Lie.
Because that deed which is afflicting your mind, I did it, and I confess it.
EUC.
What is it I hear from you ?
Lie.
That which is the truth.
Euc.
What evil;
young man, have I deserved, by reason of which you should do thus, and go to ruin both me and my children ?
Lie.
A Divinity was my prompter;
he prompted me to do it.
Euc.
How ?
Lie.
I confess that I have done wrong, and I know that I deserve censure ;
for that reason l'in come to beseech you, that, with feelings assuaged, you will pardon me.
Euc.
Why did you dare do so, to touch that which was.
not your own ?
LYC.
What do you wish to be done ?
The thing has been done;
it can't be undone.
I believe that the Gods willed it, for if they hain't willed it, I know it wouldn't have happened.
EUC.
But I believe that the Gods have willed that I should be the death of you in fetters.
LYC.
Don't say that!
Eire.
What business then have you to touch what is my own against my will ?
LYC.
Because I did it under the evil influence of wine and love.
Euc.
Most audacious man, that you should dare to come here to me with that speech, you impudent fellow !
For if this is lawful, so that you may be able to excuse it—let us openly, in broad daylight, plunder their golden trinkets from ladies—after that, if we are caught, let us excuse ourselves, that we did it when intoxicated, by reason of being in love.
Too cheap are wine and love, if one in liquor and in love is allowed to do with impunity whatever he pleases.
LYC.
But I come to you of my own accord to supplicate you on account of my folly.
Eire.
Persons don't please me, who, when they've done wrong, excuse themselves.
You knew that you had no right there ;
you oughtn't to have touched1.
Lyc.
Therefore, inasmuch as I did dare to touch, I make no objection to keep by all means.
Euc.
You, keep what is my own against my will ?
LYC.
Against your will, I do not ask;
but I think that that which was yours ought to be mine2.
Moreover, Euclio, you'll find, I say, that mine it ought to be.
Euc.
Now really, on my word, I'll drag you to the Prætor and take proceedings3 against you, unless you make restitution.
LYC.
Make restitution of what to you ?
Euc.
What you've stolen of mine.
Lyc.
I, stolen of yours ?
Whence, or what is it ?
Euc.
So shall Jupiter love you, how ignorant you are about it !
LYC.
Unless, indeed, you tell me what you are enquiring for.
Euc.
The pot of gold, I say, I'm asking back of you, which you confessed to me that you had taken away.
LYC.
By my faith, I've neither said so, nor have I done it.
Euc.
Do you deny it ?
LYC.
Yes, I do utterly deny it;
for neither the gold nor yet this pot, what it means, do I know or understand.
Euc.
Give me up that pot which you took away from the wood of Sylvanus.
Come, give it me back!
I would rather give you the one-half of it.
Although you are a thief to me, I'll not be hard upon the thief.
Give it me back.
Lyc.
You are not in your senses, to call me a thief;
I thought, Euclio, that you had come to the knowledge of another matter;
as concerns myself, it is a great matter which I wish to speak with you upon at your leisure, if you are at leisure.
Euc.
Tell me, in good faith, have you not stolen that gold ?
Lyc.
In good faith, No. Euc.
Nor know who has taken it away ?
Lyc.
In good faith, No, to that as well.
Euc.
But if you should know who has taken it away, will you discover it to me ?
Lyc.
I will do so.
Euc.
Nor accept of a share from him, whoever he is, for yourself, nor harbour the thief?
Lyc.
Even so.
Euc.
What if you deceive me ?
Lyc.
Then may great Jupiter do unto me what he pleases.
Euc. I'm satisfied.
Come, then, say what you wish.
Lyc.
If you know me but imperfectly, of what family I'm born:
Megadorus here is my uncle;
Antimachus was my father;
my name is Lyconides ;
Eunomia is my mother.
Ere.
I know the family;
now, what do you want ?
LYC.
I want to know this.
You have a daughter or yours ?
Euc.
Why, yes, she's there at home.
Lie.
You have, I think, recently betrothed her to my uncle ?
Euc.
You have the whole matter.
Lie.
He has now bade me announce to you his refusal of herl.
Euc.
A refusal, when the things are got ready, and the wedding's prepared ?
May all the immortal Gods and God­ desses confound him, so far as is possible, by reason of whom this day, unhappy wretch that I am, I have lost so much gold!
Lie.
Be of good heart, and speak in kindly terms;
now, a thing-may it turn out well and prosperously to you and your daughter.
-May the Gods so grant-say.
Euc. May the Gods so grant.
Lie.
And for me, too, may the Gods so grant it.
Now, then, do you listen.
The man that admits a fault is not so much to be despised, if he feels a sense of shame when he excuses himself.
Now, Euclio, I do beseech you, that what unawares I have done urong towards yourself or your daughter, you will grant me pardon for the same, and give her for a wife to me, as the laws demand.
I confess that I did violence to your daughter on the festival of Ceres, by reason of wine and the impulse of youth.
Euc.
Woe is me!
What shocking deed do I hear of you ?
LYC.
Why do you exclaim ?
You whom I've made to be a grandfather now at the very wedding of your daughter.
For your daughter has just been brought to bed in the ninth month after-calculate the number2;
for that reason, in my behalf, has my uncle sent his refusal.
Go in-doors;
enquire whether it is so or not as I say.
Euc.
I'm undone utterly;
so very many misfortunes unite themselves for my undoing.
I'll go in-doors, that I may know what of this is true.
(He goes into his house.)
Lyc.
I'll follow you this instant.
This matter seams now to be pretty nearly in the haven of safety.
Now, where to say my servant Strobilus is, I don't know, but yet I'll wait here still a little while;
after that I'll follow this man in- doors ;
now, in the meantime, I'll give him leisure to enquire of the nurse about my doings, the attendant of his daugh­ ter, whether she knows the truth.
(Moves as if going.)STRO. (to himself).
Immortal Gods, with what and how great delights do you present me!
I've got a four pound pot filled with gold;
who there is richer than I ?
What man is there greater than I at Athens now;
any one, I mean, to whom the Gods are propitious ?LYC. (to himself).
Why, surely, I seemed just now to hear the voice of some one speaking here.
STRO. (to himself).
Ha!
do I not see my master?
LYC. (to himself).
Do I see Strobilus now, my servant ?STRO. (to himself).
'Tis he himself.
LYC. (to himself).
'Tis no other.
STRO. (to himself).
I'll accost him.
Lyc. (to himself).
I'll step out!
towards him.
I do think that he has been, as I requested him, to the old woman, the nurse herself of this damsel.
STRO. (to himself).
Why don't I tell him that I've found this prize, and speak out ?
For that reason, I'll beg of him to make me free.
I'll go and speak to him.
(Addressing him.)
I've foundLyc.
What have you found ?
STRO.
Not that which the boys cry out that they've found in the bean2.
Lyc.
And are you trifling with me then, as you are in the habit of doing ?
(He turns as if to go away.)STRO.
Master, stop;
I'll speak out then;
do listen.
LYC.
Come then, tell me.
STRO.
I've found to-day, master, very great riches.
Lyc.
Where, pray ?
STRO.
A four pound pot1$*, I say, full of gold!
Lyc.
What crime is this that I hear of from you ?
STRO.
I've stolen it from this old fellow, Euclio.
Lyc.
Where is this gold ?
STRO.
In my box at home;
I now wish to be made free.
Lyc.
I, make you free, you fellow, brimful of wickedness ?
STRO.
Out upon you, master, I know what you would be at.
Troth,
I've cleverly tried your inclination;
you were just getting ready to take it away from me ;
what would you do, if I had found it ?
LYC.
You can't make good your pretences.
Come, give up the gold!
STRO.
I, give up the gold ?
Lyc.
Give it up, I say, that it may be given back to him.
STRO.
Where am I to get it from ?
Lyc.
That which you confessed just now to be in your box.
STRO.
I' faith, I'm in the habit of talking nonsense;
'twas in that way I was speaking.
Lyc. (seizing him).
But do you know what ?
STRO.
Even kill me outright, i' faith, you never shall get it hence of me * * * *2STRO. — the pot belonging to the oldfellow, which ,I've not got.
LYC.
I will have it, whether you will or no;
when I've tied you up all fours, and torn asunder your body for you tied up to the beam.
But why do I delay to rush upon the jaws of this rascal, and why this instant do I not compel his soul to take its journey before its time1 ?
Are you going to give it me or not ?
STRO.
I will give it you.
LYC.
I want you to give it me now, and not at a future time.
STRO.
I'll give it now;
but I entreat you to allow me to recover breath.
(LYCONIDES lets hint go.)
Aha!
What is it you want me to give you, master ?
Lie.
Don't you know, you rascal ?
And do you dare to re­ fuse me the four pound pot full of gold which you just now said you had stolen?
(Calling at the door.)
Hallo there!
Where now are the flogging men ?
STRO.
Master, do hear a few words.
Lyc.
I won't hear;
floggers, hallo there-hallo!
SLAVE.
What's the matter ?
LYC.
I want the chains to be got ready.
STRO.
Listen to me, I beg of you;
afterwards order them to bind me as much as you please.
Lyc.
You speak not unwisely.
STRO.
Now then hear the rest.
Our age has produced masters too grasping, whom I'm in the habit of calling Harpagos, Harpies, and Tantali, poor amid great wealth, and thirsty in the midst of the waters of Ocean;
no riches are enough for them, not those of Midas, not of Croesus;
not all the wealth of the Persians can satisfy their Tartarean maw.
Masters use their slaves rigorously, and slaves now obey their masters but tardily;
so on neither side is that done which would be fair to be done.
Their provisions, kitchens, and store-cellars, avaricious old fellows shut up with a thousand keys.
Slaves, thievish, double- dealers, and artful, open for themselves things shut up with a thousand keys, which the owners hardly like to be granted to their lawful children, and stealthily do they carry off, consume, and lick them up—fellows that will never dis­ close their hundred thefts even at the gibbet;
thus in laughter and joking do bad slaves take revenge upon their slavery.
So then, I come to the conclusion that liberality renders slaves faithful.
Lyc.
Rightly, indeed, have you spoken, but not in a few words, as you promised me.
But if I do make you free, will you give me back what I'm asking for ?
STRO.
I will give it back;
but I wish for witnesses to be present;
you'll pardon me, master, I trust you but little.
LYC.
Just as you please;
let there be present even a hun­ dred ;
then I shouldn't care about it.
STRO. (going to the door of the house of MEGADORUS).
Megadorus, and you, Eunomia, please come here, I beg of you;
the business finished, you shall return directly.
MEG.
Who's calling us ?
Ha!
Lyconides!
EUN.
Ha!
Strobilus, what is the matter ?
Say.
Lyc.
'Tis a short matter.
MEG.
What is it ?
STRO.
I'm calling you as witnesses.
If I bring here a four pound pot full of gold and give it up to Lyconides, Lyco­ nides makes me a free man, and orders me to be my own master.
(To LYCONIDES.)
Do you not promise me so ?
Lyc.
I do promise so.
STRO.
Have you heard now what he has said ?
MEG.
We have heard.
STRO.
Swear, then, by Jupiter.
Lyc. Alas!
to what I am reduced by the misfortunes of others!
You are too insulting;
still, I'll do what he bids me.
STRO.
Hark you, our generation hasn't much confidence in people:
the documents are signed;
the twelve witnesses are present;
the registrar writes down the time and the place;
and still, the pleader is found to deny that it has been done.
Lyc.
But release me speedily, please.
STRO.
Here, take this stone.
(Giving him a stone.)
Lyc.
If I knowingly deceive you, so may Jupiter reject from me his blessings, the city and citadel safe, as I do this stone.
(He throws it.)
Have I now satisfied you ?
STRO.
I am satisfied;
and I'm going to bring the gold.
Lyc.
Go with the speed of Pegasus, and return devouring the road with your rapid steps.
(Exit STROBILUS.)
Any impertinent slave, that wishes to be more wise than his master, is a nuisance to a decent man.
Let this Strobilus be off as a free man to utter perdition, if he only brings me the pot full of pure gold, so that I may restore Euclio, my father-in-law, from his grief to joy, and obtain the favour of his daughter, who is just brought to bed by reason of my debauching her.
But see!
Strobilus is returning, loaded;
as I guess, he's bringing the pot;
and, for sure, it is the pot that he's car­ rying.
STRO.
Lyconides, I bring you my findings that I pro­ mised—the four pound pot of gold;
have I been long ?
Lyc.
Why, yes.
(He takes some of the gold out of the pot.) 0 immortal Gods, what do I behold ?
Or what is it I hold ?
More than six hundred Philippean pieces, three or four times over.
But let's call out Euclio forthwith.
LYC. (going to the door of EUCLIO'S house).
Ho, Euclio, Euclio!
MEG.
Euclio;
Euclio! Euc. (opening his window).
What' the matter ?
LYC.
Come down to us, for the Gods will you to be saved;
we've got the pot.
Euc.
Have you got it, or are you trifling with me ?
Lie.
We've got it, I say.
Now, if you can, fly down hither.
Euc. (having come out of the house to them).
0 great Ju­ piter! 0 household Divinity and Queen Juno! and Alcides, my treasurer!
that at length you do show pity upon a wretched old man.
(Taking the pot in his arms.) 0 my pot!
0 how aged I, your friend, do clasp you with joyfiil arms, and receive you with kisses ;
with a thousand embraes even I cannot be satisfied.
0 my hope!
my heart!
that dissi­ pates my grief.
Lyc. (aside, to MEGADORUS).
I always thought that to be in want of gold was the worst thing for both boys and IT en, and all old people.
Indigence compels boys to be guilty of mis­ deeds, men to thieve, and old men themselves to become beg­ gars.
But 'tis much worse, as I now see, to abound in gold beyond what's necessary for us.
Alas!
what miseries has Euclio endured on account of the pot, that a little while since was lost by him !
Eire.
To whom shall I give deserved thanks ?
Whether to the Gods, who show regard for good men, or to ray friends, upright men, or to them both ?
Rather to both, I think;
and first to you, Lyconides, the origin and author of so great a good;
you do I present with this pot of gold;
accept it with pleasure.
I wish it to be your own, and my daughter as well, in the presence of Megadorus, and his good sister, Eunomia.
LYC.
(receiving the pot of gold).
The favour is received, and is returned, in thanks, as you deserve, Euclio, a father-in-law most acceptable to me.
Euc.
I shall think the favour sufficiently returned to me, if you now receive with pleasure my gift, and myself as well for your father-in-law.
Lyc.
I do receive it;
and I wish my house to be that of Euclio.
STRO.
What still remains, master,-remember now that I'm to be free.
Lyc.
You've well put me in mind.
Be you a free man, 0 Strobilus, for your deserts;
and now prepare in-doors the dinner that has been so disturbed.
STRO. (coming forward).
Spectators, the avaricious Eucho has changed his nature ;
he has suddenly become liberal;
so, too, do you practise liberality;
and if the play has pleased vou well, loudly clap your hands.
PHILOCRATES, an Elean, captive in Ætolia.
TYNDARUS, his servant.
ARISTOPHONTES, an Elean, captive in Ætolia.
PHILOPOLEMUS, an Ætolian, captive in Elis.ERGASILUS, a Parasite.
A LAD, the same.ne.
-—A place in Ætolia, before the house olHEGIO, a wealthy native of Ætolia, had two sons, one of which was stolen by a slave when four years old, and being carried away to Elis, was sold there;
the father being unable for many years to learn what has become of him.
A war having commenced between the Eleans and the Ætolians, Philopolemus, the other son of Hegio, is taken prisoner by the Eleans.
The Ætolians having taken many Elean prisoners, Hegio commences to traffic in captives, with the view of thereb redeeming his son from the Eleans, in exchange for some prisoner of rank.
A this conjuncture the Play commences.
Among the captives whom Hegio has pur­ chased, Philocrates is one, having been taken prisoner, together with his ser­ vant, Tyndarus.
With the object of deceiving Hegio, Philocrates and Tyndarus change their clothes, and having exchanged names as well, Philocrates pretends to be the servant of Tyndarus.
Hegio being desirous to procure the ex­ change of his son, Philocrates (in the character of the servant of his fellow- captive) is sent to Elis for that purpose.
After his departure, Aristophontes, another captive, accidentally puts Hegio in the way of discovering the manner in which he has been deceived.
On this, the old man, losing all hope of obtaining the liberation of his son, sends Tyndarus in chains to the stone-quarries.
Shortly after, Philocrates returns, and brings with him Philopolemus, theson of Hegio, and Stalagmus, the runaway slave, that had stolen his other son.
It is then discovered that Sta*lagmus had sold the child to the father of Phi­ locrates, and that he is no other than Tyndarns, the slave;
on which, Tyndarus is sent for, and is informed that he is the lost son of Hegio.
Stalagmus is then condemned to the chains from which Tyndarus is liberated.
[Supposed to have been written by Priscian the Grammarian.]
One son of Hegio has been made prisoner (Captus) in battle.
A runaway slave has sold the other (Alium) when four years old.
The father (Pater) traffics in Elean captives, only (Tantum) desirous that he may recover his son, and (Et) among these he buys his son that was formerly lost.
He (Is), his clothes and his name changed with his master, causes that (Ut) he is lost to Hegio;
and he himself is punished.
And (Et) he brings back the captive and the runaway together, through whose information (Indicio) he discovers his other son.
THESE two captives (pointing to PHILOCRATES and TYN­ DARUS), whom you see standing here, are standing here be­ causethey are both2 standing, and are not sitting.
That I am saying this truly, you are my witnesses.
The old man, who lives here (pointing to HEGIO'S house), is Hegio—his father (pointing to TYNDARUS).
But under what circum­ stances he is the slave of his own father, that I will here explain to you, if you give attention.
This old man had two sons;
a slave stole one child when four years old, and flying hence, be sold him in Elis3, to the father of this captive (pointing to PHILOCRATES).
Now, do you under.
stand this ?
Very good.
I' faith, that man at a distance1 there (pointing) says, no.
Come nearer then.
If there isn't room for you to sit down, there is for you to walk;
since you'd be compelling an actor to bawl like a beggar2.
I'm not going to burst myself for your sake, so don't you be mis­ taken.
You who are enabled by your means to pay your taxes3, listen to the rest4;
I care not to be in debt to another.
This runaway slave, as I said before, sold his young master, whom, when he fled, he had carried off, to this one's father.
He, after he bought him, gave him as his own private slave5 so this son of his, because they were of about the same age.
He is now the slave at home of his own father, nor does his father know it.
Verily, the Gods do treat us men just like footballs1.
You hear the manner now how he lost one sun.
Afterwards, the Ætolians2 are waging war with the people of Elis, and, as happens in warfare, the other son is taken pri­ soner.
The physician Menarchus buys him there in Elis.
On this, this .legio begins to traffic in Elean captives, if, per­ chance, he may be able to find one to change for that captive son of his.
He knows not that this one who is in his house is his own son.
And as he heard yesterday that an Elean knight of very high rank and very high family was taken prisoner, he has spared no expense to rescue his son3.
In order that he may more easily bring him back home, he buys both of these of the Quæstors4 out of the spoil.
Now they, between themselves, have contrived this plan, that, by means of it, the servant may send away hence his master home.
And therefore among themselves they change their garments and their names.
He, there (pointing), is called Philocrates;
this one (pointing), Tyndarus ;
he this day assumes the character of this one, this one of him.
And this one to-day will cleverly carry out this plot, and cause his master to gain his liberty ;
and by the same means he will save his own brother, and without knowing it, will cause him to return back a free man to his own country to his lather just as often now, on many occasions, a person has done more good unknowingly than knowingly.
But unconsciously, by their devices, they have so planned and devised their plot, and have so contrived it by their design, that this one is living in servitude with his own father.
And thus now, in ignorance, he is the slave of his own father.
What poor creatures are men, when I reflect upon it!
This plot will be performed by us—a play for your entertainment.
But there is, besides, a thing which, in a few words, I would wish to inform you of.
Really, it will be worth your while to give your attention to this play.
'Tis not composed in the hack.
neyed style, nor yet like other plays, nor are there in it any ribald linesl unfit for utterance:
here is neither the perjured procurer, nor the artful courtesan, nor yet the braggart cap­ tain.
Don't you be afraid because I've said that there's war between the Ætolians and the Eleans.
There (pointing), at a distance, beyond the scenes, the battles will be fought.
For this were almost impossible for a Comic establishment2, that we should at a moment attempt to be acting Tragedy.
If, therefore, any one is looking for a battle, let him commence the quarrel;
if he shall find an adversary more powerful, I'll cause him to be the spectator of a battle that isn't pleasant to him, so that hereafter he shall hate to be a spectator of them all.
I now retire.
Fare ye well, at home, most upright judges, and in warfare most valiant combatants.
ERG.
The young men have given me the name of " the mistress," for this reason, because invocated3 I am wont to attend at the banquet.
I know that buffoons1 say that this is absurdly said, but I affirm that it is rightly said.
For at the banquet the lover, when he throws the dice, invokes his mistress2.
Is she then invocated, or is she not ?
She is, most clearly.
But, i' faith, we Parasites with better reason are so called, whom no person ever either invites or in­ vokes, and who, like mice, are always eating the victuals of an­ other person.
When business is laid asides, when people repair to the country, at that same moment is business laid aside for our teeth.
Just as, when it is hot weather, snails lie hidden in secret, and live upon their own juices, if the dew doesn't fall;
so, when business is laid aside, do Parasites lie hidden in retirement, and miserably live upon their own juices, while in the country the persons are rusticating whom they sponge upon.
When business is laid aside, we Parasites are greyhounds ;
when business recommences, like mastiffs4, we are annoying-like and very troublesome-like5.
And here, indeed, unless, i' faith, any Parasite is able to en­ dure cuffs with the fist, and pots to be brokenl about his head, why he may e'en go with his wallet outside the Trige­ minian Gate2.
That this may prove my lot, there is some danger.
For since my patron3 has fallen into the hands of the enemy—(such warfare are the Ætolians now waging with the Eleans;
for this is Ætolia;
this Philopolemus has been made captive in Elis, the SOIl of this old man Hegio who lives here (pointing to the house)—a house which to me is a house of woe, and which so oft as I look upon, I weep).
Now, for the sake of his son, has he commenced this dishonorable traffic, very much against his own inclination.
He buys up men that have been made captives, if perchance he may be able to find some one for whom to gain his son in exchange.
An object which I really do much desire that he may gain;
for unless he finds him, there's nowhere for me to find myself.
I have no hopes in the young men;
they are all too fond of themselves.
He, in fine, is a youth with the old-fashioned manners, whose countenance I never rendered cheerful with­ out a return.
His father is worthily matched, as endowed with like manners.
Now I'll go to him;
—but his door is opening, the door from which full oft I've sallied forth drunk with excess of cheer.
(He stands aside.)
SCENE II.
—Enter, from his house, HEGIO and a SLAVE.HEG.
Now, give attention you, if you please.
Those two captives whom I purchased yesterday of the Quæstors out of the spoil, put upon them chains of light weight4;
take oft those greater ones with which they are bound.
Permit them to walk, if they wish, out of doors, or if in-doors, but so that they are watched with the greatest care.
A captive at liberty is like a bird that's wild;
if opportunity is once given for escaping, 'tis enough ;
after that, you can never catch him.
SLAVE.
Doubtless we all are free men more willingly than we live the life of slaves.
HEG.
You, indeed, don't seem to think so1.
SLAVE.
If I have nothing to give, should you like me to give myself to flight2 ?HE a.
If you do so give yourself, I shall at once have some­ thing to be giving to you.
SLAVE.
I'll make myself just like the wild bird you were telling of.
HEG.
'Tis just as you say;
for if you do so, I'll be giving you to the cage3.
But enough of prating;
take you care of what I've ordered, and be off.
(The SLAVE goes into the house.)
I'll away to my brother's, to my other captives;
I'll go see whether they've been making any disturbance last night.
From there I shall forthwith betake myself home again.
ERG. (apart).
It grieves me that this unhappy old man is following the trade of a slave-dealer, by reason of the mis­ fortune of his son.
But, if by any means he can be brought back here, I could even endure for him to become an exe­ cutioner.
HEG. (overhearing him).
Who is it that's speaking?
ERG.
'Tis I, who am pining at your affliction, growing thin, waxing old, and shockingly wasting away.
Wretched man that I am, I'm but skin and bone through leanness;
nor does anything ever do me good that I eat at home;
even that ever so little which I taste out of doors, the same re­ freshes me.
HEG.
Ergasilus, save you!
ERG. (crying).
May the Gods kindly bless you, Hegio!
lEG.
Don't weep.
ERG.
Must I not weep for him ?
Must I not weep for such a young man ?
HEG.
I've always known you to be a friend to my son, and I have understood him to be so to you.
ERG.
Then at last do we men know our blessings, when we have lost those things which we once had in our power.
I, since your son fell into the power of the enemy, knowing by experience of what value he was, now feel his loss.
HEG.
Since you, who are no relation, bear his misfortune so much amiss, what is it likely that I, a father, should do, whose only son he is ?ERG.
I, no relation to him ?
He, no relation to me ?
Oh, Hegio!
never do say that, nor come to such a belief.
To you he is an only child, but to me he is even more only than an only one.
HEG.
I commend you, in that you consider the affliction of your friend your own affliction.
Now be of good heart.
ERG. (crying.).
0 dear! HEG. (half-aside).
'Tis this afflicts him, that the army for guttling is now disbanded.
Mean­ while, have you found no one to command for you the army that you mentioned as disbanded ?
ERG.
What do you think ?
All to whom it used to fall are in the habit of declining that province since your son Philopolemus was taken prisoner.
HEG.
I' faith, 'tisn't to be wondered at, that they are in the habit of declining that province.
You have necessity for numerous troops, and those of numerous kinds.
Well, first you have need of the Bakerians1.
Of these Bakerians there are several kinds.
You have need of Roll-makerians, you have need too of Confectionerians, you have need of Poultererians, you have need of Beccaficorians;
besides, all the maritime forces are necessary for you.
ERG.
How the greatest geniuses do frequently lie con­ cealed !
How great a general now is this private individual!
HEG.
Only have good courage;
for I trust that in.
a few days I shall bring him back home.
For see now;
there's a cap­ tive here, a young man of Elis, born of a very high family, and of very great wealth;
I trust that it will come to pass that I shall get my son in exchange for him.
ERG.
May the Gods and Goddesses grant it so!
HEG.
But are you invited out anywhere to dinner ?
ERG.
Nowhere that I know of.
But, pray, why do you ask me ?
HEG.
Because this is my birthday;
for that reason I'd like you to be invited to dinner at my house.
ERG.
'Tis kindly said.
HEG.
But if you can be content to eat a very littleERo.
Aye, even ever so little;
for on such fare as that do I enjoy myself every day at home.
HEG.
Come, then, please, set yourself up for sale.
ERG.
I'll put myself up for purchase, just like a landed estate, unless any one shall privately make a better offer that pleases myself and my friends more, and to my own conditions will I bind myself.
HEG.
You are surely selling me a bottomless pitl, and not a landed estate.
But if you are coming, do so in time.
ERG.
Why, for that matter, I'm at leisure even now.
HEa.
Go then, and hunt for a hare;
at present, in me you have but a ferretl, for my fare is in the way of frequenting a rugged road.
ERG.
You'll never repulse me by that, Hegio, so don't attempt it.
I'll come, in spite of it, with teeth well shod.
HEG.
Really, my viands are but of a rough sort2.
ERG.
Are you in the habit of eating brambles ?
HEG.
Mine is an earthy dinner.
ERG.
A pig is an earthy animal.
HEG.
Earthy from its plenty of vegetables.
ERG.
Treat your sick people3 at home with that fare?
Do you wish anything else ?
HEG.
Come in good time.
ERG.
You are putting in mind one who remembers quite well.
(Exit.HEG.
I'll go in-doors, and in the house I'll make the cal­ culation how little money I have at my banker's ;
afterwards I'll go to my brother's, whither I was saying I would go.
(Goes into his house.)SLAVE.
If the immortal Gods have so willed it that you should undergo this affliction, it becomes you to endure it with equanimity;
if you do so, your trouble will be lighter4.
At home you were free men, I suppose;
now if slavery has befallen you, 'tis a becoming way for you to put up with it, and by your dispositions to render it light, under a master's rule.
Unworthy actions which a master does must be deemed worthy ones.
PHIL. and Tim.
Alas!.
alas!
alas!
SLATE.
There's no need for wailing;
you cause much injury to your eyes.
In adversity, if you use fortitude of mind, it is of service.
PHIL. and TYND.
But we are ashamed, because we are in bonds.
SLAVE.
But in the result it might cause vexation to our master, if he were to release you from chains, or allow you to be loose, whom he has purchased with his money.
PHIL. and TYND.
What does he fear from us ?
We know our duty, what it is, if he allows us to be loose.
SLAVE.
Why, you are meditating escape.
I know what it is you are devising.
PHIL. and TYND.
We, make our escape ?
Whither should we escape ?
SLATE.
To your own country.
PHIL. and TYND.
Out upon you ;
it would ill befit us to be following the example of runaways.
SLATE.
Why, faith, should there be an opportunity, I don't advise you not.
PHIL. and TYND.
Do you allow us to make one request.
SLATE.
What is it, pray?
PHIL. and TYND.
That you will give us an opportunity of conversing, without these and yourselves for overlookers.
SLATE.
Be it so;
go you away from here, you people.
Let's step here, on one side.
(To the other CAPTIVES and SLAVES.)
But commence upon a short conversation only.
PHIL.
0 yes, it was my intention so to do.
Step aside this way (to TYNDARUS).
SLAVE (to the other CAPTIVES).
Stand apart from them.
TYND. (to the SLAVE).
We are both greatly obliged to you, by reason of your doing so, since you allow us to obtain what we are desirous of.
PHIL.
Step here then, at a distance now, if you think fit, that no listeners may be enabled to overhear our discourse, and that this plan of ours mayn't be divulged before them;
for a stratagem is no stratagem, if you don't plan it with art but it is a very great misfortune if it becomes disclosed.
For if you are my master, and I represent myself as your servant, still there's need of foresight, and need of caution, that this may be carried out discreetly and without over­ lookers, with carefulness and with cautious prudence and diligence.
So great is the matter that has been commenced upon ;
this must not be carried out in any drowsy fashionTYND.
Just as you shall desire me to be, I will be.
PHIL.
I trust so.
TYND.
For now you see that for your precious life l'in setting at stake my own, as dear to me.
PHIL.
I know it.
TYND.
But remember to know it when you shall be enjoying that which you wish for;
for mostly, the greatest part of mankind follow this fashion;
what they wish for, until they obtain it, they are rightminded;
but when they have now got it in their power, from being rightminded they become most deceitful, and most dishonest;
now I do consider that you are towards me as I wish.
What I advise you, I would advise my own father.
PHIL.
I' faith, if I could venture, I would call you father;
for next to my own father, you are my nearest father.
TYND.
I understand.
PHIL.
And therefore I remind you the more frequently, that you may remember it.
I am not your master, but your servant;
now this one thing I do beseech you.
Inasmuch as the immortal Gods have disclosed to us their wishes, that they desire me to have once been your master, and now to be your fellow-captive;
what formerly of my right I used to command you, now with entreaties do I be, of you, by our uncertain fortunes, and by the kindness of my father towards you, and by our common captivity, which has befallen us by the hand of the enemy, don't you pay me any greater respect than I did you when you were my slave;
and don't you forget to remember who you were, and who you now are.
TYND.
I know, indeed, that I now am you, and that you are I.PHIL.
Well, if you are able carefully to remember that, 1 have some hope in this scheme of ours.
HEG.
I shall return in-doors just new, when I shall have discovered from these people what I want to know.
(To the SLAVES.)
Where are those persons whom I ordered to be brought out of doors here, before the house ?
PHIL.
By my faith, I find that you have taken due pre­ caution that we shouldn't be missed by you, so walled in are we with chains and keepers.
HEG.
He that takes precaution that he mayn't be deceived, is hardly on his guard, even while he's taking precaution;
even when he has supposed that he has taken every precau­ tion, full often is this wary man outwitted.
Was there not good reason, indeed, for me to watch you carefully, whom I purchased with so large a sum of ready money ?
PHIL.
Troth, it isn't fair for us to hold you to blame, be­ cause you watch us closely ;
nor yet for you us, if we go away hence, should there be an opportunity.
HEG.
As you are here, so is my son a captive there among your people.
PHIL.
He, a captive ?
HEG.
Even so.
PHIL.
We, then, have not proved the only cowards1.
HEG. (to PHILOCRATES, supposing him to be the SERVANT of the other).
Step you aside this way, for there are some things that I wish to enquire of you in private, on which subjects I would have you not to be untruthful to me.
(They step aside.)PHIL.
I will not be, as to that which I shall know;
if I shall not know anything, that which I don't know I'll tell you of.
TYND. (aside).
Now is the old fellow in the barber's shop;
now, at this very instant, is Philocrates wielding the razor2.
He hasn't cared, indeed, to put on the barber's cloth3, so as not to soil his dress.
But whether to say that he's going to shave him close, or trim him through the comb1, I don't know;
but if he's wise, he'll scrape him right well to the very quick.
HEG. (to PHILOCRATES).
Which would you?
Would you prefer to be a slave, or a free man ?-Tell me.
PHIL.
That which is the nearest to good, and the furthest off from evil, do I prefer;
although my servitude hasn't proved very grievous to me, nor has it been otherwise to me than if I had been a son in the family.
TYND. (aside).
Capital!
I wouldn't purchase, at a talent's price even, Thales the Milesian2;
for compared with this man's wisdom, he was a very twaddler.
How cleverly has he suited his language to the slave's condition.
HEG.
Of what family is this Philocrates born ?
PHIL.
The Polyplusian3;
which one family is flourishing there, and held in highest esteem.
HE a.
What is he himself?
In what esteem is he held there ?
PHIL.
In the highest, and that by the very highest men.
HEG.
Since, then, he is held in such great respect among the Eleans, as you tell of, what substance has he ?
—Of large amount ?
PHIL.
Enoughfor him, even, when an old man, to be melt­ ing out the tallow4.
HECK
What is his father ?
Is he living ?
PHIL.
When we departed thence, we left him alive ;
whether he's living now or not, Orcus, forsooth, must know that.
TYND. (aside).
The matter's all right;
he's not only lying, but he's even philosophizing now.
HEG.
What's his name ?
PHIL.
Thesaurochrysonicocrœ­ sides1.HEG.
That name has been given, I suppose, by reason of his wealth, as it were.
PHIL.
Troth, not so, but rather by reason of his avarice and grasping disposition;
for, indeed, he was Theodoromedes originally by name.
HEG.
How say you ?
Is his father covetous ?
PHIL.
Aye, by my faith, he is covetous.
Why, that you may even understand it the better,-when he's sacrificing at any time to his own Genius, the vessels that are needed for the sacrifice he uses of Samian ware, lest the Genius himself should steal them;
from this, consider how much he would trust other people.
HEG. (addressing TYNDARUS as though PHILOCRATES).
Do you then follow me this way.
(Aside.)
The things that I desire to know, I'll enquire of him.
(-Addressing TYN­ DARUS.)
Philocrates, this person has done as it becomes an honest man to do.
For from him I've learnt of what family you are sprung;
he has confessed it to me.
If you are willing to own these same things (which, however, un­ derstand that I already know from him), you will be doing it for your own advantage.
TYND.
He did his duty when he confessed the truth tc you, although, Hegio, I wished carefully to conceal both my rank and my wealth ;
now, inasmuch as I've lost my country and my liberty, I don't think it right for him to be dreading me rather than you.
The might of warfare has made my fortunes on a level with himself.
I remember the time when he didn't dare to do it in word ;
now, in deed, he is at liberty to offend me.
But don't you see ?
Human fortune moulds and fashions just as she wills.
Myself, who was a free man she has made a slave, from the very highest the very lowest.
I, who was accustomed to command, now obey the mandates of another.
And indeed, if I meet with a master just such as I proved the ruler in my own household, I shall not fear that he will rule me harshly or severely.
With this, Hegio, I wished you to be acquainted, unless perchance you your­ self wish it not.
HEG.
Speak boldly out.
TYND.
As free a man was I till lately as your son.
As much did a hostile hand deprive me of my liberty as him of his.
As much is he a slave among my people, as I am now a slave here with yourself.
There is undoubtedly a God, who both hears and sees the things which we do.
Just as you shall treat me here, in the same degree will he have a care for him.
To the well-deserving will he show favour, to the ill-deserving will he give a like return.
As much as you lament your son, so much does my father lament me.
HE a.
That I am aware of.
But do you admit the same that he has disclosed to me ?
TYND.
I confess that my father has very great wealth at home, and that I am born of a very noble family;
but I entreat you, Hegio, let not my riches make your mind too prone to avarice, lest it should seem to my father, although I am his only son, more suitable that I should be a slave in your house, bountifully supplied at your expense and with your clothing, rather than be living the life of a beggar where 'twould be far from honorable.
HEG.
By the favour of the Gods and of my forefathers, I am rich enough.
I don't quite believe that every kind oj gain is serviceable to mankind.
I know that gain has already made many a man famous;
and yet there are occasions when it is undoubtedly better to incur loss than to make gain..
Gold I detest:
many a one has it persuaded to many an evil course.
Now give your attention to this, that you may know as well what my wishes are.
My son, taken prisoner, is in servitude at Elis there among your people;
if you restore him to me, don't you give me a single coin besides;
both you and him, your servant, I'll send back from here;
on no other terms can you depart hence.
TYND.
You ask what's very right and very just, and you are the very kindest person of all mankind.
But whether is he in servitude to a private person or to the public1 ?
HEG.
In private servitude to Menarchus, a physician.
PHIL.
By my faith, that person's surely his father's de­ pendant.
Why really, that's down as- pat for you, as the shower is when it rains.
HEG.
Do you then cause this person, my son, to be redeemed.
TYND.
I'll do so :
but this I beg of you, HegioHEG.
Whatever you wish, so that you request nothing against my interest, I'll do.
TYND.
Listen then, and you'll know.
I don't ask for my­ self to be released, until he has returned.
But I beg of you to give me him (pointing to PHILOCRATES) with a price set2.
upon him, that I may send him to my father, that this per­ son, your son, may be redeemed there.
HEG.
Why no;
I'd rather send another person hence, when there shall be a truce, to confer with your father there, and to carry your injunctions which you shall entrust him with, just as you wish.
TYND.
But it's of no use to send to him one that he doesn't know;
you'd be losing your labour.
Send this person ;
he'll have it all completed, if he gets there.
And you cannot send any person to him more faithful, nor one in whom he places more confidence, nor who is more a servant after his own mind;
nor, in fact, one to whom he would more readily entrust your son.
Have no fears;
at my own peril I'll make proof of his fidelity, relying upon his disposition;
because he is sensible that I'm kindly disposed towards him.
HEG.
Well then, I'll send him with a price set upon him, on the surety of your promise, if you wish it..
TYND.
I do wish it;
so soon as ever it can, I want this matter to be brought to completion.
HE a.
What reason is there, then, that if he doesn't return, you should not pay me twenty minæ for him ?
TYND.
Yes—very good.
HEG. (to the SLATES, who obey).
Release him now forthwith;
and, indeed, both of them.
(On being released, PHILOCRATES goes into the house.)TYND.
May all the Gods grant you all your desires, since you have deigned me honor so great, and since you release me from my chains.
Really, this is not so irksome now, since my neck is free from the collar-chain.
HEG.
The kindnesses that are done to the good, thanks for the same are pregnant with blessings.
Now, if you are about to send him thitber, direct, instruct him, give him the orders which you wish to be carried to your father.
Should you like me to call him to you ?
TYND.
Do call him.
(HEGIO goes to the door, and calls PHILOCRATES.)HEG.
May this affair turn out happily for myself and for my son, and for yourselves.
(To PHILOCRATES.)
Your new master wishes you to pay faithful obedience to your former owner in what he wishes.
For I have presented you to him, with the price of twenty minæ set upon you:
and he says that he is desirous to send you away hence to his father, that he may there redeem my son, and that an exchange may be made between me and him for our respective sons.
PHIL.
My disposition takes its course straight in either direction, both to yourself and to him;
as a wheel1 you may make use of me ;
either this way or that can I be turned, whichever way you shall command me.
HEG.
You yourself profit the most from your own dis­ position, when you endure slavery just as it ought to be endured.
Follow me.
(To TYNDARUS.)
See here's your man.
TYND.
I return you thanks, since you give me this oppor­ tunity and permission to send this messenger to my parents, who may relate all the matter in its order to my father, what l'in doing here, and what I wish to be done.
(To PHILOCRATES.)
Now, Tyndarus, thus is it arranged between myself and him, that I'm to send you, valued at a fixed price, to my father in Elis;
so that, if you don't return hither, I'm to give twenty minæ for you.
PHIL.
I think that you've come to a right understand­ ing.
For your father expects either myself or some mes­ senger to come from here to him.
TYND.
I wish you, then, to mind what message it is I want you to carry hence to my country to my father.
PHIL.
Philocrates, as up to this moment I have done, I will take all due care to endeavour that which may espe­ cially conduce to your interest, and to pursue the same with heart and soul, and with my ears.
TYND.
You act just as you ought to act;
now I wish you to give attention.
In the first place of all, carry my re­ spects to my mother and my father, and to my relations, and if any one else you see well-disposed towards me:
say that I am in health here, and that I am a slave, in servitude to this most worthy man, who has ever honored me more and more with his respect, and does so still.
PHIL.
Don't you be instructing me as to that;
I can, still, easily bear that in mind.
TYND.
For, indeed, except that I have a keeper, I deem myself to be a free man.
Tell my father on what terms I have agreed with this party about his son.
PHIL.
What I remember, it is sheer delay to be putting me in mind of.
TYND.
To redeem him, and to send him back here in ex­ change for both of us.
PHIL.
I'll remember it.
HEG.
But as soon as he can that is especially to the interest of us both.
PHIL.
You are not more anxious to see your son, than he is to see his.
HEG.
My son is dear to myself, and his own to every man.
PHIL. (to TYNDARUS).
Do you wish any other message to be carried to your father ?
TYND.
Say that I am well here;
and do you boldly tell him, Tyndarus, that we have been of dispositions for unin­ terrupted harmony between ourselves, and that you have neither been deserving of censure, nor that I have proved your enemy;
and that still, -amid miseries so great, you have shown implicit obedience to your master, and that you have never abandoned me, either in deed or in fidelity, amid .
my wavering, unprosperous fortunes.
When my father shall know this, Tyndarus, how well-disposed you have proved towards his son and himself, he will never be so avaricious but that he'll give you your liberty for nothing.
And by my own endeavours, if I return hence, I'll make him do so the more readily.
For by your aid and kindness, and good disposition and prudence, you have caused me to be allowed to return to my parents once again, inasmuch as to .legio you have confessed both my rank and my wealth ;
by means of which, through your wisdom, you have liberated your master from his chains.
PHIL.
The things which you mention I have done, and I am pleased that you remember this.
Deservedly have they been done for you by me;
for now, Philocrates, if I, too, were to mention the things that you have kindly done for me, the night would cut short the day.
For, had you been my slave even, no otherwise were you always obliging to me.
HEG.
Ye Gods, by our trust in you!
behold the kindly dis­ position of these persons!
How they draw the very tears from me!
See how cordially they love each other, and with what praises the servant has commended his master.
PHIL.
I' troth, he hasn't commended me the one hun­ dredth part of what he himself deserves to be commended in mv praises.
HEG. (to PHILOCRATES).
Since, then, you have acted most becomingly, now there's an opportunity to add to your good deeds in managing this matter with fidelity towards him.
PHIL.
I am not able more to wish it done, than by my en deavours to try to bring it about.
That you may know this, Hegio, with praises do I call supreme Jove to witness that I will not prove unfaithful to Philocrates1HEa.
You are a worthy fellow.
PHIL.
And that I will never in anything act otherwise towards him than towards my own self.
TYND.
I wish you to put these speeches to the test, both by your deeds and your actions ;
and inasmuch as I have said the less about you than I had wished, I wish you the more to give me your attention, and take you care not to be angry with me by reason of these words.
But, I beseech you, re­ flect that you are sent hence home with a price set upon you at my risk, and that my life is here left as a pledge for you.
Do not you forget me the very moment that you have left my presence, since you will have left me here behind a captive in captivity for yourself, and don't consider yourself as free, and forsake your pledge2, and not use your endeavours for you to bring his son home again, in return for me.
Understand that you are sent hence valued at twenty minæ.
Take care to prove scrupulously faithful;
take care that you show not a wavering fidelity.
For my father, I am sure, will do everything that he ought to do.
Preserve me as a constant friend to you, and find out3 this person so lately discovered.
These things, by your right hand, holding you with my own right hand, do I beg of you;
do not prove less true to me than I have proved to you.
This matter do you attend to;
you are now my master, you my patron, you my father;
to you do I commend my hopes and my fortunes.
PHIL.
You have given injunctions enough.
Are you satis­ fied if I bring back accomplished what you have enjoined ?
TYND.
Satisfied.
PHIL. (to HEGIO).
According to your wishes, and (to TYNDARUS) according to yours, will I return hither provided.
Is there anything else ?
TYND.
For you to return back as soon as ever you can.
PHIL.
The business itself reminds me of that.
HEG. (to PHILOCRATES).
Follow me, that I may give you your expenses for the journey at my banker's;
on the same occasion I'll get a passport from the Prætor.
TYND.
What passportl ?
HEG.
For him to take with him hence to the army, that he may be allowed to go home from here.
(To TYNDARUS.)
You go in-doors.
TYND.
Speed you well.
PHIL.
Right heartily, farewell.
(TYNDARUS goes into the house.)HEG. (aside).
I' faith, I compassed my design, when I purchased these men of the Quæstors out of the spoil.
I have released my son from slavery, if so it pleases the Gods;
and yet I hesitated a long time whether I should purchase or should not purchase these persons.
Watch that man in- doors, if you please, you servants, that he may nowhere move a foot without a guard.
I shall soon make my appearance at home;
now I'm going to my brother's, to see my other captives;
at the same time I'll enquire whether any one knows this young man.
(To PHILOCRATES.)
Do you follow, that I may despatch you.
I wish attention first to be paid to that matter.
(-Exeunt.ERG.
Wretched is that man who is in search of some­ thing to eat, and finds that with difficulty;
but more wretched is he who both seeks with difficulty, and finds nothing at all;
most wretched is he, who, when he desires to eat, has not that which he may eat.
But, by my faith, if I only could, I'd willingly tear out the eyes of this day;
-with such enmity has it filled all people towards me.
One more starved out I never did see, nor one more filled with hunger1, nor one who prospers less in whatever he begins to do.
So much do my stomach and my throat take rest on these fasting holidays2.
Away with the profession of a Parasite to very utter and extreme perdition!
so much in these days do the young men drive away from them the needy drolls.
They care nothing now-a-days for these Laconian men3 of the lowest benches- these whipping-posts, who have their clever sayings without provision and without money.
They now-a-days seek those who, when they've eaten at their pleasure, may give them a return at their own houses.
They go themselves to market, which formerly was the province of the Parasites.
They go themselves from the Forum to the procurers with face as ex­ posed4 as the magistrates in court5, with face exposed, condemn those who are found guilty;
nor do they now value buffoons at one farthing6;
all are so much in love with themselves.
For, when, just now, I went away from here, I came to some young men in the Forum:
" Good morrow," said I;
" whither are we going together to breakfast ?"
On this, they were silent. " Who says, ' here, at my house,' or who makes an offer ?” said 1. Just like dumb men, they were silent, and didn't smile at me.
" Where do we dine ?" said I.
On this they declined.
1 said one funny saying out of my best bon mots, by which I formerly used to get feasting for a month;
not an individual smiled;
at once I knew that the matter was arranged by con­ cert.
Not even one was willing to imitate a do-, when pro­ voked ;
if they didn't laugh, they might, at least, have grinned with their teethe From them I went away, after I saw that I was thus made sport of.
I went to some others;
then to some others I came ;
then to some others-the same the result.
All treat the matter in confederacy, just like the oil-mer­ chants in the Velabrum2.
Now, I've returned thence, since I see myself made sport of there.
In like manner do other Parasites walk to and fro, to no purpose, in the Forum.
Now, after the foreign fashions, I'm determined to enforce all my rights.
Those who have entered into a confederacy, by which to deprive us of food and life,-for them I'll name a day.
I'll demand, as the damages, that they shall give me ten dill­ ners at my own option, when provisions are dear:
thus will I do.
Now I'll go hence to the harbour.
There, is my only hope of a dinner;
if that shall fail me, I'll return here to the old gentleman, to his unsavoury dinner.
HEG. (to himself).
What is there more delightful than to manage one's own interests well for the public goodl, just as I did yesterday, when I purchased these men.
Every person, as they see me, comes to meet me, and congratulates me on this matter.
By thus stopping and detaining un­ lucky me, they've made me quite tired.
With much ado have I survived2 from being congratulated, to my misfortune.
At last, to the Prætor did I get.
There, scarcely did I rest myself.
I asked for a passport;
it was given me:
at once I delivered it to Tyndarus.
He started for home.
Thence, straightway, after that was done, I passed by my house;
and I went at once to my brother's, where my other captives are.
I asked about Philocrates from Elis, whether any one 01 them all knew the person.
This man (pointing to ARISTO­ PHONTES) called out that he had been his intimate friend ;
I told him that he was at my house.
At once he besought and entreated me that I would permit him to see him.
Forthwith I ordered him to be released from chains.
Thence have I come.
(To ARISTOPHONTES.)
Now, do you follow me, that you may obtain what you have besought of me, the opportunity of meeting with this person.
(They go into the house.)TYND.
Now stands the matter so, that I would much rather that I had once existed, than that I still exist;
now do my hopes, my resources, and my succour, desert me and spurn themselves.
This is that day, when, for my life, no safety can be hoped;
nor yet is death my end ;
nor hope is there, .n fact, to dispel this fear for me;
nor cloak have I anywhere for my deceitful stratagems;
nor for my devices or my sub­ terfuges is there anywhere a screen presented to me.
No de­ precating is there for my perfidy ;
no means of flight for my offences.
No refuge is there anywhere for my trusting;
and no escape for my cunning schemes.
What was concealed is now exposed;
my plans are now divulged.
The whole matter is now laid open;
nor is there any ado about this matter, but that I must perish outright, and meet with destruction, both on behalf of my master and myself.
This Aristophontes has proved my ruin, who has just now come into the house.
He knows me.
He is the intimate friend and kinsman of Philocrates.
Not Salvation herself1 can save me now, even if she wishes;
nor have I any means of escape, unless, per­ chance, I devise some artifice in my mind.
(He meditates.)
Plague on it !-how? ?
What can I contrive ?-what can I think of?
Some very great folly and trifling I shall have to begin with.
I'm quite at a loss.
(He retires aside.)HEG.
Whither am I to say, now, that this man has be, taken himself from the house out of doors ?
TYND. (apart).
Now, for a very certainty, I'm done for;
the enemies are coming to you, Tyndarus!
What shall I say ?—what shall I talk of ?
What shall I deny, or what confess ?
All matters are reduced to uncertainty.
How shall I place confidence in my resources ?
I wish the Gods had destroyed you, before you were lost to your own country, Aristophontes, who, from a plot well concerted, are making it disconcerted.
This plan is ruined outright, unless I find out for myself some extremely bold device.
HEG. (to ARISTOPIIONTES).
Follow me.
See, there is the man go to him and address him.
TYND. (aside, and turning away).
What mortal among mor­ tals is there more wretched than myself?
ARIST.
(coming up to him).
Why's this, that I'm to say that you are avoiding my gaze, Tyndarus ?
And why that you are slighting me as a stranger, as though you had never known me ?
Why, I'm as much a slave as yourself;
although at home I was a free man, you, even from your childhood, have always served in slavery in Elis.HEG.
I' faith, I'm very little surprised, if either he does avoid your gaze, or if he does shun you,.who are calling him Tyndarus, instead of Philocrates.
TYND.
Hegio, this person was accounted a madman in Elis.
Don't you give ear to what he prates about;
for at home he has pursued his father and mother with spears, and that malady sometimes comes upon him which is spit out1.
Do you this instant stand away at a distance from him.
HEG. (to the SLAVES).
Away with him further off from me.
ARIST.
Do you say, you whipp'd knave, that I am mad, and do you declare that I have followed my own father with spears ?
And that I have that malady, that it's necessary for me to be spit upon2 ?
HEG.
Don't be dismayed;
that malady afflicts many a person to whom it has proved wholesome to be spit upon, and has been of service to them.
ARIST.
Why, what do you say ?
Do you, too, credit him ?
HEG.
Credit him in what ?
ARIST.
That I am mad ?
TYND.
Do you see him, with what a furious aspect he's looking at you ?
'Twere best to retire, Hegio ;
it is as I said, his frenzy grows apace;
have a care for yourself.
HEG.
I thought that he was mad, the moment that he called you Tyndarus.
TYND.
Why, he's sometimes ignorant of his own name;
and doesn't know what it is.
HEG.
But he even said that you were his intimate friend.
TYND.
So far from that, I never saw him.
Why, really, Alcmæon, and Orestes, and Lycurgusl besides, are my friends on the same principle that he is.
ARIST.
Villain, and do you dare speak ill of me, as well ?
Do I not know you ?
HEG.
I' faith, it really is very clear that you don't know him, who are calling him Tyndarus, instead of Philocrates.
Him whom you see, you don't know;
you are addressing him as the person whom you don't see.
ARIST.
On the contrary, this fellow's saying that he is the person who he is not;
and he says that he is not the person who he really is.
TYND.
You've been found, of course, to excel Philocrates in truthfulness.
ARIST.
By my troth, as I understand the 'matter, you've been found to brazen out the truth by lying.
But i' faith, prithee, come then, look at me.
TYND. (looking at him).
Well!
ARIST.
Say, now;
do you deny that you are Tyndarus ?
TYND.
I do deny it, I say.
ARIST.
Do you say that you are Philocrates ?
TYND.
I do say so, I say.
ARIST. (to HEGIO).
And do you believe him ?
HECK More, indeed, than either you or myself.
For he, in fact, who you say that he is (pointing to TYNDARUS), has set out hence to-day for Elis, to this person's father.
ARIST.
What father, when he's a slave1TYND.
And so are you a slave, and yet you were a free man;
and I trust that so I shall be, if I restore his son here to liberty.
ARIST.
How say you, villain ?
Do you say that you were born a free man [liber] ?
TYND.
I really do not say that I am Liber2, but that I am Philocrates.
ARIST.
How's this ?
How this scoundrel, Hegio, is making sport of you now.
For he's a slave himself, and never, except his own self, had he a slave.
TYND.
Because you yourself are destitute in your own country, and haven't whereon to live at home, you wish all to be found like to yourself;
you don't do anything surprising.
'Tis the nature of the distressed to be ill-disposed, and to envy the fortunate.
ARIST.
Hegio, take you care, please, that you don't persist in rashly placing confidence in this man ;
for sc far as I see, he is certainly now putting some device in execution, in saying that he is redeeming your son from captivity;
that is by no means satisfactory to me.
TYND.
I know that you don't wish that to be done ;
still I shall effect it, if the Gods assist me.
I shall bring him back here, and he will restore me to my father, in Elis.
For that purpose have I sent Tyndarus hence to my father.
ARIST.
Why,.you yourself are he;
nor is there any slave in Elis of that name, except yourself.
TYND.
Do you persist in reproaching me with being a slave —a thing that has befallen me through the fortune of war ?
ARIST.
Really, now, I cannot contain myself.
TYND. (to HEGIO).
Ha!
don't you hear him?
Why don't you take to flight ?
He'll be pelting us just now with stones there, unless you order him to be seiz-ed.
ARIST.
I'm distracted.
TYND.
His eyes strike fire ;
there's need of a rope, Hegio.
Don't you see how his body is spotted all over with livid spots ?
Black bilel is disordering the man.
ARIST.
And, by my faith, if this old gentleman is wise, black pitch2 will be disordering you with the executioner, and giving a light to your head.
TYND.
He's now talking in his fit of delirium;
sprites are in possession of the man.
HEG.
By my troth, suppose I order him to be seized ?
TYND.
You would be acting more wisely.
ARIST.
I'm vexed that I haven't a stone, to knock out the brains of that whip-scoundrel, who's driving me to madness by his taunts.
TYND.
Don't you hear that he's looking for a stone ?
ARIST.
I wish to speak with you alone, separately, Hegio.HEG.
Speak from where you are, if you want anything;
though at a distance, I shall hear you.
TYND.
Tes, for, by my faith, if you approach nearer, he'll be taking your nose off with his teeth.
ARIST.
By heavens, Hegio, don't you believe that I am mad, or that I ever was so, or that I have the malady which that fellow avers.
But if you fear anything from me, order me to be bound;
I wish it, so long as that fellow is bound as well.
TYND.
Why really, Hegio, rather let him be bound that wishes it.
ARIST.
Now hold your tongue !
I'll make you, you false Philocrates, to be found out this day to be a real Tyndarus.
Why are you making signs1 at me ?
TYND.
I, making signs at you ?
(To HEGIO.)
What would he do, if you were at a greater distance off ?
HEG.
What do you say?
What if I approach this mad­ man ?
TYND.
Nonsense ;
you'll be made a fool of;
he'll be pra­ ting stuff, to you, neither the feet nor the head of which wil l ever be visible.
The dress only2 is wanting;
in seeing this man, you behold Ajax himself.
HEG.
I don't care;
still I'll approach him.
(Advances to ARISTOPHONTES.)TYND. (aside).
Now aID I utterly undone;
now between the sacrifice and tae stone1 do I stand, nor know I what to do.
HEG.
I lend you my attention, Aristophontes, if there is anything that you would wish with me.
ARIST.
From me you shall hear that truth, which now you think to be false, Hegio.
But I wish, in the first place, to clear myself from this with you—that madness does not pos­ sess me, and that I have no malady, except that I am in captivity ;
and, so may the King of Gods and of men make me to regain my native land, that fellow there is no more Philocrates than either I or you.
HE a.
Come, then, tell me who he is ?
ARIST.
He whom I've told you all along from the begin­ ning.
If you shall find him any other than that person, I show no cause why I shouldn't suffer the loss with you both of my parents and of my liberty for ever.
HEG. (to TYNDARUS).
What say you to this?
TYND.
That I am your slave, and you my master.
HEG.
I didn't ask that-were you a free man ?
TYND.
I was.
ARIST.
But he really wasn't;
he is de.
ceiving you.
TYND.
How do you know ?
Were you, perchance, the mid­ wife of my mother, since you dare to affirm this so boldly ?
ARIST.
When a boy, I saw yourself, a boy.
TYND.
But, grown up, I now see you grown up;
so, there's for you, in return.
If you did right, you wouldn't be troubling yourself about my concerns ;
do I trouble my­ self about yours ?
HEG.
Was his father called Thesaurochrysonicocrœsides ?
ARIST.
He was not;
and I never heard that name before this day.
Theodoromedes was the father of Philocrates.
TYND. (aside).
I'm downright undone.
Why don't you be quiet, heart of mine ?
Go and be stretched, and hang your­ self;
you are throbbing so, that unfortunate I can hardly stand up for my fear.
HEG.
Is a full assurance given me that this was a slave in Elis, and that be is not Philocrates ?
ARIST.
So fully, that you will never find this to be other­ wise ;
but where is he1 now ?
HEG.
Where I the least, and he the most could wish him­ self.
In consequence, then, I'm cut asunder2, disjointed, to my sorrow, by the devices of this scoundrel, who has barn.
boozled me by his tricks just as he has thought fit.
But do, please, have a care that you are right.
ARIST.
Why, I assure you of this, as an ascertained and established fact.
HEG.
For certain?
ARIST.
Why, nothing, I say, will you find more certain than this certainty.
Philocrates, from when a boy, has ever since that time been my friend.
HEG.
But of what appearance is your friend Philocrates ?
ARIST.
I'll tell you:
with a thin face, sharp nose, light hair, dark eyes, somewhat ruddy, with hair rather crisp and curling.
HEG.
The description is like.
TYND. (aside).
Aye, so much so, indeed, that I've this day, much to my sorrow, got into the midst of this, i' faith.
Woe to those unfortunate rods which this day will be meeting their end upon my back.
HEG.
I see that I've been imposed upon.
TYND. (aside).
Why, fetters, do you delay to run towards me and to embrace my legs, that I may have you in custody ?
HEG.
And have these two rascally captives really deceived me this day with their tricks ?
The other one pretended that he was the servant, and this one that he himself was the master.
I've lost the kernel;
for a security, I've left the shell.
To such a degree have they imposed upon me3, both on this side and that, with their trickeries.
Still, this fellow shall never have the laugh against me.
Colaphus, Cordalio, Corax4 (to the SLAVES), go you away and bring out the thongs.
SLAVE.
Are we to be sent to gather faggots1 ?
(The SLATES go and bring the thongsfrom the house.)HEG. (to the SLAVES).
Put the manacles on this whipp'd villain.
TYND. (whilst the SLAVES are fastening him).
What's the matter ?
What have I done wrong ?
HEG.
Do you ask the question ?
You weeder and sower of villanies, and in especial their reaper.
TYND.
Ought you not to have ventured to say the harrower first ?
For countrymen always harrow before they weed.
HEG.
Why, with what assurance he stands before me.
TYND.
It's proper for a servant, innocent and guiltless, to be full of confidence, most especially before his master.
HEG. (to the SLAVES).
Bind this fellow's hands tightly, will you.
TYND.
I am your own-do you command them to be cut off even.
But what is the matter on account of which you blame me ?
HEG.
Because me and my fortunes, so far as in you singly lay, by your rascally and knavish stratagems you have rent in pieces, and have distracted my affairs and spoiled all my resources and my plans, in that you've thus robbed me of Philocrates by your devices.
I thought that he was the slave, you the free man.
So did you say yourselves, and in this way did you change names between you.
TYND.
I confess that all was done so, as you say, and that by a stratagem he has got away from you, through my aid and cleverness;
and prithee, now, do you blame me for that, i' faith ?
HEG.
Why, it has been done with your extreme torture for the consequence.
TYND.
So I don't die by reason of my misdeeds, I care but little.
If I do die here, then he returns not, as he said he would;
but when I'm dead, this act will be remembered to my honor, that I caused my captive master to return from slavery and the foe, a free man, to his father in his native land;
and that I preferred rather to expose my own life to peril, than that he should be undone.
HEG.
Take care, then, to enjoy that fame at A cheron.
TYND.
He who dies for virtue's sake, still does not perish.
HEG.
When I've tortured you in the most severe man­ ner, and for your schemes put you to death, let them say either that you have perished or that you have died;
so long as you do die, I don't think it matters if they say you live.
TYND.
I' faith, if you do do so, you'll do it not without retri­ bution, if he shall return here, as I trust that he will return.
ARIST. (aside).
0 ye immortal Gods!
I understand it now;
now I know what the case really is.
My friend Philocrates is at liberty with his father, in his native land.
'Tis well;
nor have I any person to whom I could so readily wish well.
But this thing grieves me, that I've done this person a bad turn, who now on account of me and my talking is in chains.
HEG. (to TYNDARUS).
Did I not forbid you this day to utter anything false to me ?
TYND.
You did forbid me.
HEG.
Why did you dare to tell me lies ?
TYND.
Because the truth would have prejudiced him whom I was serving ;
now falsehood has advantaged him.
HEG.
But it will prejudice yourself.
TYND.
'Tis very good.
Still, I have saved my master, whom I rejoice at being saved, to whom my elder master had as­ signed me as a protector.
But do you think that this was wrongly done ?
HEG.
Most wrongfully.
TYND.
But I, who disagree with you, say, rightly.
For consider, if any slave of yours had done this for your son, what thanks you would have given him.
Would you have given that slave his freedom or not ?
Would not that slave have been in highest esteem with you ?
Answer me that.
HEG.
I think so.
TYND.
Why, then, are you angry with me ?
HEG.
Because you have proved more faithful to him than to myself.
TYND.
How now ?
Did you expect, in a single night and day, for yourself to teach me—a person just made captive, a recent slave, and in his noviciate-that I should rather con­ sult your interest than his, with whom from childhood I have passed my life ?
HEG.
Seek, then, thanks from him for that.
( To the SLAVES.)
Take him where he may receive weighty and thick fetters, thence, after that, you shall go to the quarries for cutting stone.
There, while the others are digging out eight stones, unless you daily do half as much work again, you shall have the name of the six-hundred-stripe manl.
ARIST.
By Gods and men, I do entreat you, Hegio, not to destroy this man.
HEG.
He shall be taken all care of2.
For at night, fastened with chains, he shall be watched;
in the daytime, beneath the ground, he shall be getting out stone.
For many a day will I torture him;
I'll not respite him for a single day.
ARIST.
Is that settled by you ?
HEG.
Not more settled that I shall die.
(To the SLATES.)
Take him away this instant to Hippolytus, the blacksmith;
bid thick fetters to be ri­ vetted on him.
From there let him be led outside the gate to my freedman, Cordalus, at the stone-quarries.
And tell him that I desire this man so to be treated, that he mayn't be in any respect worse off than he who is the most severely treated.
TYND.
Why, since you are unwilling, do I desire myself to survive ?
At your own hazard is the risk of my life.
After death, no evil have I to apprehend in death.
Though I should live even to extreme age, still, short is the space for enduring what you threaten me with.
Farewell and prosper;
although you are deserving for me to say otherwise.
You, Aristophontes, as you have deserved of me, so fare you;
for on your account has this befallen me.
HEG. (to the SLAVES).
Carry him off.
TYND.
But this one thing I beg, that, if Philocrates should come back here, you will give me an opportunity of meeting him.
HEG. (to the SLAVES).
At your peril, if you don't this in­ stant remove him from my sight.
(The SLAVES lay hold of TYNDARUS, and push him along.)TYND.
I' troth, this really is violence1, to be both dragged and pushed at the same time..
(He is borne off by the SLAVES.)HEG.
He has been led off straight to prison2, as he de­ serves.
Let no one presume to attempt such an enterprise.
Had it not been for you who discovered this to me, still would they have been leading me by the bridle with their tricks.
Now am I resolved henceforth never to trust any person in anything.
This once I have been deceived enough;
I did hope, to my sorrow, that I had rescued my son from slavery.
That hope has forsaken me.
I lost one son, whom, a child in his fourth year, a slave stole from me;
and, indeed, never since have I found either slave or son;
the elder one has fallen in the hands of the enemy.
What guilt is this of mine ?
As though I had become the father of children for the purpose of being childless.
(To ARISTOPHONTES.)
Follow this way.
I'll conduct you back where you were.
I'm determined to have pity upon no one, since no one has pity upon me.
ARIST.
Forth from my chains with evil omen did I come;
now I perceive that with like ill omen to my bonds I must return.
(Exeunt.ERG.
Supreme Jove!
thou dost preserve me, and dost augment my means.
Plenty, extreme and sumptuous, dost thou present to me;
celebrity, profit, enjoyment, mirth, fes­ tivity, holidays, sights, provisions, carousings, abundance, joy­ ousness.
And to no man have I now determined with myself to go a-begging;
for I'm able either to profit my friend or to destroy my enemy, to such extent has this delightful day heaped delights upon me in its delightfulness.
I have lighted upon a most rich inheritance without incumbrances1.
Now will I wend my way to this old gentleman Hegio, to whom I am carrying blessings as great as he himself prays for from the Gods, and even greater.
Now, this is my determination, in the same fashion that the slaves of Comedy2 are wont, so will I throw my cloak around my neck, that from me, the first of all, he may learn this matter.
And I trust that I, by reason of this news, shall find provision up to the end.
HEG. (to himself).
The more that I revolve this matter in my breast, the more is my uneasiness of mind increased.
That I should have been duped in this fashion to-day!
and that I wasn't able to see through it!
When this shall be known, then I shall be laughed at all over the city.
The very mo­ ment that I shall have reached the Forum, all will be saying, " This is that clever old gentleman, who had the trick played him."
But is this Ergasilus, that I see coming at a distance ?
Surely he has got his cloak gathered up;
what, I wonder, is he going to do ?ERG.
(advancing, and talking to himself).
Throw aside from you all tardiness, Ergasilus, and speed on this business.
I threaten, and I strictly charge no person to stand in my way, unless any one shall be of opinion that he has lived long enough.
For whoever does come in my way, shall stop me upon his face.
(He runs along, flourishing his arms about.)HEG. (to himself).
This fellow's beginning to box.ERG. (to himself).
I'm determined to do it;
so that every one may pursue his own path, let no one be bringing any of his business in this street;
for my fist is a balista, my arm is my catapulta, my shoulder a battering-ram;
then against whomsoever I dart my knee, I shall bring him to the ground.
I'll make all persons to be picking up their teeth1 whom­ soever I shall meet with.
HEG (to himself).
What threatening is this ?
For I can.
not wonder enough.
ERG.
I'll make him always to remember this day and place, and myself as well.
Whoever stops me upon my road, I'll make him put a stop to his own existence.
HEG. (to himself).
What great thing is this fellow pre­ paring to do, with such mighty threats ?
ERG.
I first give notice, that no one, by reason of his own fault, may be caught-keep yourselves in-doors at home, and.
guard yourselves from my attack.
HEG. (to himself).
By my faith, 'tis strange if he hasn't got this boldness by means of his stomach.
Woe to that wretched man, through whose cheer this fellow has become quite swaggering.
ERG.
Then the bakers, that feed swine, that fatten their pigs upon refuse bran, through the stench of which no one can pass by a baker's shop;
if I see the pig of any one of them in the public way, I'll beat the bran out of the masters' themselves with my fists.
HEG. (to himself).
Royal and imperial edicts does he give out.
The fellow is full;
he certainly has his boldness from his stomach.
ERG.
Then the fishmongers, who supply stinking fish to the public-who are carried about on a gelding, with his galloping galling pace1—the stench of whom drives all the loungers in the Basilica2 into the Forum, I'll bang their heads with their bulrush fish-baskets, that they may under­ stand what annoyance they cause to the noses of other people.
And then the butchers, as well, who render the sheep destitute of their young-who agree with you about killing lamb3, and then offer you lamb at double the price-who give the name of wether mutton to a ram—if I should only see that ram in the public way, I'll make both rain and owner most miserable beings.
HEG. (to himself).
Well done!
He really does give out edicts fit for an Ædile, and 'tis indeed a surprising thing if the Ætolians haven't made him inspector of markets4.ERG.
No Parasite now am I, but a right royal king of kings ;
so large a stock of provision for my stomach is there at hand in the harbour.
But why delay to overwhelm this old gentleman Hegio with gladness ?
With him, not a person among mankind exists equally fortunate.
HEG. (apart).
What joy is this, that he, thus joyous, is going to impart to me ?ERG.
(knocking at HEGIO'S door).
Hallo, hallo!-where are you ?
Is any one coming to open this door ?HEG. (apart).
This fellow's betaking himself to my house to dine.
ERG.
Open you both these doors1, before I shall with knocking cause the destruction, piecemeal, of the doors.
HEG. (apart).
I'd like much to address the fellow.
(Aloud.)
Ergasilus!ERG.
Who's calling Ergasilus?
REG.
Turn round, and look at me.
ERG. (not seeing who it is).
A thing that Fortune does not do for you, nor ever will do, you bid me to do.
But who is it ?
HEG.
Look round at me.
'Tis Hegio.ERG. (turning round).
0 me!
Best of the very best of men, as many as exist, you have arrived opportunely.
HEG.
You've met with some one at the harbour to dine with ;
through that you are elevated.
ERG.
Give me your hand.
HEG.
My hand ?ERG.
Give me your hand, I say, this instant.
HEG.
Take it.
(Giving him his hand.)ERG.
Rejoice.
HEG.
Why should I rejoice ?
ERG.
Because I bid you;
come now, rejoice.
HEG.
I' faith, my sorrows exceed my rejoicings.
ERG.
'Tis not so, as you shall find;
I'll at once drive away every spot of sorrow2 from your body.
Rejoice without re­ straίnt.
HEG..
T do rejoice, although I don't at all know why I should rejoice.
ERG.
You do rightly ;
now orderHEG.
Order what ?
ERG.
A large fire to be made.
HEG.
A large fire ?
ERG.
So I say, that a huge one it must be.
HEG.
What, you vulture, do you suppose that for your sake I'm going to set my house on fire ?
ERG.
Don't be angry.
Will you order, or will you not order, the pots to be put on, and the saucepans to be washed out, the bacon and the dainties to be made warm in the heated cooking-stoves, another one, too, to go purchase the fish ?
HEG.
This fellow's dreaming while awake.
EUG.
Another to buy pork, and lamb, and pullets.
HEG.
You understand how to feed well, if you had the means.
ERG.
Gammons of bacon, too, and lampreys, spring pickled tunny-fish, mackerel, and sting-ray;
large fish, too, and soft cheese.
HEG.
You will have more opportunity, Ergasilus, here at my house, of talking about these things than of eating them.
ERG.
Do you suppose that I'm saying this on my own account ?
HEG.
You will neither be eating nothing here to-day, nor yet much more than usual, so don't you be mistaken.
Do you then bring an appetite to my house for your every-day fare.
ERG.
Why, I'll so manage it, that you yourself shall wish to be profuse, though I myself should desire you not.
HEG.
What, I ?
ERG.
Yes, you.
HEG.
Then you are my master.
ERG.
Yes, and a kindly disposed one.
Do you wish me to make you happy ?
HEG.
Certainly I would, rather than miserable.
ERG.
Give me your hand.
HEG. (extending his hand).
Here is my hand.
ERG.
All the Gods are blessing you.
HEG.
I don't feel it so.
ERG.
Why, you are not in a quickset hedge1, therefore you don't feel it;
but order the vessels, in a clean state, to be got for you forthwith in readiness for the sacrifice, and one lamb to be brought here with all haste, a fat one.
HEG.
Why ?
ERG.
That you may offer sacrifice.
HEG.
To which one of the Gods ?
ERG.
To myself, i' faith, for now am I your supreme Jupiter.
I likewise am your salvation, your fortune, your life, your delight, your joy.
Do you at once, then, make this Divinity propitious to you by cramming him.
HEG.
You seem to me to be hungry.
ERG.
For myself am I hungry, and not for you.
HEG.
I readily allow of it at your own good will.
ERG.
I believe you ;
from a boy1 you were in the habit-HEG.
May Jupiter and the Gods confound you.ERG.
I' troth, 'tis fair that for my news you should return me thanks;
such great happiness do I now bring you from the harbour.
HEG.
Now you are flattering me.
Begone, you simpleton;
you have arrived behind time, too late.
ERG.
If I had come sooner, then for that reason you might rather have said that.
Now, receive this joyous news of me which I bring you ;
for at the harbour I just now saw your son Philopolemus in the common fly-boat, alive, safe and sound, and likewise there that other young man together with him, and Stalagmus your slave, who fled from your house, who stole from you your little son, the child of four years old.
HEG.
Away with you to utter perdition!
You are trifling with me.
ERG.
So may holy Gluttony2 love me, Hegio, and so may she ever dignify me with her name, I did seeHEG.
My son ?
ERG.
Your son, and my good Genius.
HEG.
That Elean captive, too ?ERG.
Yes, by Apollo3.
HEG.
The slave, too ?
My slave Stalagmus, he that stole my son?
ERG.
Yes, by Cora.
HEG.
So long a time ago ?
ERG.
Yes, by Præneste!
HEG.
Is he arrived ?ERG.
Yes, by Signia!
HEG.
For sure?
ERG.
Yes, by Phrysinone!
HEG.
Have a care, if you please.
ERG.
Yes, by Alatrium!
HEG.
Why are you swearin by foreign cities ?
ERG.
Why, because they are just as disagreable as you were declaring your fare to be.
HEG.
Woe be to you!
ERG.
Because that you don't believe me at all in what I say in sober earnestness.
But of what country was Stalagmus, at the time when he de­ parted hence ?
HEG.
A Sicilian.
ERG.
But now he is not a Sicilian­ he is a Boian;
he has got a Boian woman1.
A wife, 1 suppose, has been given to him for the sake of obtaining children.
HEG.
Tell me, have you said these words to me in good earnest ?
ERG.
In good earnest.
HEG. Immortal Gods, I seem to be born again, if you are telling the truth.
ERG.
Do you say so ?
Will you still entertain doubts, when I have solemnly sworn to you ?
In fine, Hegio, if you have little confidence in my oath, go yourself to the harbour and see.
HEG.
I'm determined to do so.
Do you arrange in-doors what's requisite.
Use, ask for, take from my larder what you like;
I appoint you cellarman.
ERG.
Now, by my troth, if I have not prophesied truly to you, do you comb me out with a cudgel.
HEG.
I'll find you in victuals to the end, if you are telling me the truth.
ERG.
Whence shall it be ?
HEG.
From myself and from my son.
ERG.
Do you promise that ?
HEG.
I do promise it.
ERG.
But I, in return, promise1 you that your son has arrived.
HEG.
Manage as well as ever you can.
ERG.
A happy walk there to you, and a happy walk back.
(Exit HEGIO,ERG.
He has gone away from here, and has entrusted to me the most important concern of catering.
Immortal Gods !
how I shall now be slicing necks off of sides;
how vast a downfall will befall the gammon2 ;
how vast a belabouring the bacon!
How great a using-up of udders, how vast a bewail­ ing for the brawn !
How great a bestirring for the butchers, how great a preparation for the porksellers!
But if I were to enumerate the rest of the things which minister to the supply of the stomach, 'twould be sheer delay.
Now will I go off to my government, to give laws to the bacon, and, those gammons that are hanging uncondemned,3 to give aid to them.
(Goes into the house.)LAD.
May Jupiter and the Deities confound you, Erga.
silus, and your stomach, and all Parasites, and every one who henceforth shall give a dinner to Parasites.
Destruc­ tion and devastation and ruin have just now entered our house.
I was afraid that he would be making an attack on me, as though he had been an hungry wolf.
And very dread­ fully, upon my faith, was I frightened at him ;
he made such a gnashing with his teeth.
On his arrival, the whole larder, with the meat, he turned upside down.
He seized a knife, and first cut off the kernels of the neck!
from three sides.
All the pots and cups he broke, except those that held a couple of gallons2;
of the cook he made enquiry whether the salting pans could be set on the fire to be made hot.
All the cellars in the house he has broken into, and has laid the store-closet3 open.
(At the door.)
Watch him, servants, if you please;
I'll go to meet the old gentleman.
I'll tell him to get ready some provisions for his own self, if, indeed, he wishes himself to make use of any.
For in this place, as this man, indeed, is managing, either there's nothing already, or very soon there will be nothing.
(Exit.HE-G. To Jove and to the Deities I return with reason hearty thanks, inasmuch as they have restored you to your father, aud inasmuch as they have delivered me from very many afflictions, which, while I was obliged to be here without you, I was enduring, and inasmuch as I see that thatfellow (pointing to STALAGMUS) is in my power, and inasmuch as his word (pointing to PHILOCRATES ) has been found true to me.
PHILOP.
Enough now have I grieved from my very soul, and enough with care and tears have I disquieted myself.
Enough now have I heard of your woes, which at the harbour you told me of.
Let us now to this business.
PHIL.
What now, since I've kept my word with you, and have caused him to be restored back again to freedom ?
HEG.
Philocrates, you have acted so that I can never re­ turn you thanks enough, in the degree that you merit from myself and my son.
PHILOP.
Nay, but you can, father, and you will be able, and I shall be able;
and the Divinities will give the means for you to return the kindness he merits to one who deserves so highly of us;
as, my father, you are able to do to this person who so especially deserves it.
HEG.
What need is there of words?
I have no tongue with which to deny whatever you may ask of me.
PHIL.
I ask of you to restore to me that servant whom I left here as a surety for myself;
who has always proved more faithful to me than to himself;
in order that for his services I may be enabled to give him a reward.
HEG.
Because you have acted thus kindly, the favour shall be returned, the thing that you ask;
both that and anything else that you shall ask of me, you shall obtain.
And I would not have you blame me, because in my anger I have treated him harshly.
PHIL.
What have you done ?
HE a.
I confined him in fetters at the stone-quarries, when I found out that I had been imposed upon.
PHIL.
Ah wretched me!
That for my safety misfortunes should have happened to that best of men.HEG.
Now, on this account, you need not give me even one groat of silver1 for him.
Receive him of me without cost that he may be free.
PHIL.
On my word, Hegio, you act with kindness;
but I entreat that you will order this man to be sent for.
HEG.
Certainly.
(To the attendants, who immediately obey.)
Where are you?
Go this instant, and bring Tyn­ darus here.
(To PHILOPOLEMUS and PHILOCRATES.)
Do you go in-doors;
in the meantime, I wish to enquire of this statue for whippingl, what was done with my younger son.
Do you go bathe in the meantime.
PHILOP.
Philocrates, follow me this way in-doors.
PHIL.
I follow you.
(They go into the house.)HEG.
Come you, step this way, you worthy fellow, my tine slave.
STAL.
What is fitting for me to do, when you, such a man as you are, are speaking false ?
I was never a handsome, or a fine, or a good person, or an honest one, nor shall I ever be;
assuredly, don't you be forming any hopes that I shall be honest.
HEG.
You easily understand pretty well in what situation your fortunes are.
If you shall prove truth-telling, you'll make your lot from bad somewhat better.
Speak out, then, correctly and truthfully;
but never yet truthfully or correctly have you acted.
STAL.
Do you think that I'm ashamed to own it, when you affirm it ?
HEG.
But I'll make you to be ashamed;
for I'll cause you to be blushes all over2.
STAL.
Heyday—you're threatening stripes, I suppose, to me, quite unaccustomed to them!
Away with them, I be,-.
Tell me what you bring, that you may carry off hence what you are in want of.
HEG.
Very fluent indeed.
But now I wish this prating to be cut short.
STAL.
As you desire, so be it done.
HEG. (to the AUDIENCE).
As a boy he was very obedient3;
now that suits him not.
Let's to this business;
now give your attention, and inform me upon what I ask.
If you tell the truth, you'll make your fortunes somewhat better.
STAL.
That's mere trifling.
Don't you think that I know what I'm deserving of?
HEG.
Still, it is in your power to escape a small portion of it, if not the whole.
STAL.
A small portion I shall escape, I know ;
but much will befall me, and with my deserving it, because I both ran away, and stole your son and sold him.
HEa.
To what person?
STAL.
To Theodoromedes the Polyplusian, in Elis, for six minæ.
HEG.
0 ye immortal Gods!
He surely is the father of this person, Philocrates.
STAL.
Why, I know him better than yourself, and have seen him more times.
HEG.
Supreme Jove, preserve both myself and my son for me.
(He goes to the door, and calls aloud.)
Philocrates, by your good Genius, I do entreat you, come out, I want you.
PHIL.
Hegio, here am I;
if you want anything of me, command me.
HEG.
He (pointing to STALAGMUS) declares that he sold my son to your father, in Elis, for six minæ.
PHIL. (to STALAGMUS).
How long since did that happen ?
STAL.
This is the twentieth year, commencing from it.
PHIL.
He is speaking falsely.
STAL.
Either I or you do.
Why, your father gave you the little child, of four years old, to be your own slave.
PHIL.
What was his name ?
If you are speaking the truth, tell me that, then.
STAL.
Pægnium, he used to be called;
afterwards, you gave him the name of Tyndarus.
PHIL.
Why don't I recollect you ?
STAL.
Because it's the fashion for persons to forget, and not to know him whose favour is esteemed as worth nothing.
PHIL.
Tell me, was he the person whom you sold to my father, who was given me for my private service ?
STAL.
It was his son (pointing to HEGIO).
HEG.
Is this person now living?
STAL.
I received the money ;
I cared nothing about the rest.
REG. (to PHlLOCRATES).
What do you say?
PHIL.
Why, this very Tyndarus is your son, according, indeed, to the proofs that he mentions.
For, a boy himself, together with me from boyhood was he brought up, virtuously and modestly, even to manhood.
HEG.
I am both unhappy and happy, if you are telling the truth.
Unhappy for this reason, because, if he is my son, I have badly treated him.
Alas!
why have I done both more and less than was his due.
That I have ill treated him I am grieved;
would that it only could be undone.
But see, he's coming here, in a guise not according to his deserts.
TYND. (to himself).
I have seen many of the torments which take place at Acheron1 often represented in paintings2 ;
but most certainly there is no Acheron equal to where I have been in.
the stone-quarries.
There, in fine, is the place where real lassitude must be undergone by the body in laboriousness.
For when I came there, just as either jackdaws, or ducks, or quails, are given to Patrician children3, for them to play with, so in like fashion, when I arrived, a crow was given4 me with which to amuse myself.
But see, my master's before the door ;
and lo!
ray other master has returned from Elis.HEG.
Hail to you, my much wished-for son.
TYND.
Ha!
how—my son ?
Aye, aye, I know why you pretend yourself to be the father, and me to be the son;
it is because, just as parents do, you give me the means of seeing the light1.
PHIL.
Hail to you, Tyndarus.
TYND.
And to you, for whose sake I am enduring these miseries.
PHIL.
But now I'll make you in freedom come to wealth.
For (pointing to HEGIO) this is your father;
(pointinq to STALAGMUS) that is the slave who stole you away from here when four years old, and sold you to my father for six minæ.
He gave you, when a little child, to me a little child for my own service.
He (pointing to STALAGMUS) has made a con­ fession, for we have brought him back from Elis.
TYND.
How, where's Hegio's son ?
PHIL.
Look now;
in- doors is your own brother.
TYND.
How do you say ?
Have you brought that captive son of his ?
PHIL.
Why, he's in-doors, I say.
TYND.
By my faith, you've done both well and happily.
PHIL. (pointing to HEGIO).
Now this is your own father;
(pointing to STALAGMUS) this is the thief who stole you when a little child.
TYND.
But now, grown up, I shall give him grown up to the executioner for his thieving.
PHIL.
He deserves it.
TYND.
I' faith, I'll deservedly give him the reward that he deserves.
(To HEGIO,) But tell me, I pray you, are you my father ?
HEG.
I am he, my son.
TYND.
Now, at length, I bring it to my recollection, when I reconsider with myself:
troth, I do now at last recall to memory that I had heard, as though through a mist, that my father was called Hegio.HEG.
I am he.
PHIL.
I pray that your son may be light­ ened of these fetters, and this slave be loaded with them.
HEG.
I'm resolved that that shall be the first thing at­ tended to.
Let's go in-doors, that the blacksmith may be sent for, in order that I may remove those fetters from you, and give them to him.
(They go into the house.)STAL.
To one who has no savings of his own, you'll be rightly doing so2.
Spectators, this play is founded on chaste manners.
No wenching is there in this, and no intriguing, no exposure of a child, no cheating out of money;
and no young man in love here make his mistress free without his father's know ledge.
The Poets find but few Comediesl of this kind, where good men might become better.
Now, if it pleases you, and if we have pleased you, and have not been tedious, do you give this sign of it:
you who wish that chaste manners should have their reward, give us your applause.
ARGYRIPPUS, his son, in love with Philenium.
THE ASS-DEALER.
DIABOLUS, an Athenian Captain, the rival of Argyrippux.
A Boy.ARTEMONA, wife of Demsenetus.
PHILENIUM, daughter of Cleæreta.
Scene—Athens, before the house of CLEÆRETA;
the house of DEMÆNETUS is little way down another street, and in view of the At DlENCE.
ARGYRIPPUS, tne son of Demænetus, is violently in love with Philenium:
a young woman, who is living with her mother, Cleæreta, a procuress.
The latter has made an agreement with a Captain, of the name of Diabolus, to transfer Philenium to him for twenty minæ, on condition, however, that if Argyrippus shall first pay that sum, he shall have her.
Argyrippus, having exhausted all his own resources, applies to his father, Demænetus, an over-indulgent and immoral old man, and requests him to furnish him with twenty minæ.
Demæ­ netus is married to Artemona, a rich woman, and is totally dependant on the will of herself and her favourite slave, the chamberlain Saurea.
Being desti­ tute of money, Demænetus orders his servant, Libanus, by some means or other to cheat his mistress or the chamberlain out of that sum.
Just then an ass-dealer arrives, to pay to Saurea twenty minæ, the price of some asses which he has previously purchased.
Libanus then arranges with his fellow-servant, Leonida, that the latter shall personate Saurea, and so receive the money from the ass-dealer.
This is done, and the money is paid to Leonida, in the presence of Demænetus, who assures the dealer that Leonida really is the person to whom the money is payable.
This sum is then given to Argyrippus, but with the disgraceful stipulation that for one day his father shall enjoy the company of Philenium.
This he submits to, and the three sit down to a banquet.
The Captain discovers this, and sends his Parasite to inform Artemona of her husband's conduct.
She accordingly accompanies the Parasite, and discovers her husband in the company of his son and the young woman;
after soundly rating him, she leads him off;
whIle Argyrippus remains in possession of Phi­ tenium.
THE son in love (Amanti), the old man, who lives under (Sub) his wife's centrol, wishes to help him with money;
therefore (Itaque), some money that has been.
brought in payment for the asses for Saurea he orders to be paid (Numerari) to his servant Leonida.
This is carried to (Ad) his mistress, and the son yields her favours to his father.
His rival (Rivinus) is furious on account of the woman thus taken from him:
he (Is) tells all the matter, through the Parasite, to the wife.
The wife rushes (Adcurrit) to the place, and drags her husband from the den.
ATTEND now, Spectators, if you please, forthwith to this, and may this matter turn out fortunately for me and for your­ selves, and for this company, and for our employers1, and for our managers2.
Now, crier, do you at once make all the people give attentive ear.
Come, be seated now, only be careful that 'tis not for nought.
Now I will tell you why I have come forward here, and what my intention is, that you may know the name of this play.
For, so far as relates to the plot, it really is a short one.
Now I will tell you what I said I was wishful to inform you upon.
The name of this play in Greek IS Onagos1—Demophilus2 composed it—Marcus3 Plautus turned it into Latin.
He wishes it to be called Asinaria4, if by your leaves it may be so.
In this play there is both plea­ santry and fun.
'Tis a droll story;
kindly lend me your attention;
may Mars, too, as, full oft at other times he has done, so give you now his aid.
LIB.
As you desire your own only son to survive your own existence, prosperous, and living on;
so by your lengthened years, and by that wife of yours of whom you stand in awe, do I conjure you, that if this day you have said anything that's false against myself, your wife may then survive your own existence, and that, she living, you, still alive, may come to utter destruction5.
DEM.
By the Gods above6, as to what you seek to know, I see that I must, perforce, speak out, whatever you question me upon, being thus conjured;
so determinedly have you accosted me, that I really do not dare otherwise than to disclose everything to you making all these enquiries.
Say then at once what it is that you desire so much to know ;
as I myself shall know, so will I let you know.
LIB.
Troth now, prithee answer me seriously what I ask you ;
take care that you tell me no falsehood.
DEM.
Why, then, don't you ask ?
LIB.
Will you, then, be sending me there, where stone grinds stone1 ?
DEM.
What place is that ?
Or where in the world is that place ?
LIB.
Where worthless men are weeping, who breakfast upon pearled barley2.
DEM.
What that place is, or where it is, I cannot under­ stand, where worthless men are weeping, who breakfast upon pearled barley.
LIB.
Why, in the islands of club-land and rattle-chain3, where dead oxen attack living mer.DEM.
I' faith, I now understand, Libanus, what place it is;
that perhaps you mean, where the pearled barley is prepared.
LIB.
0 dear:
I'm not speaking of that, i' faith, nor do I wish to speak of it.
Troth now, prithee, do spit out4 the words that you have spoken.
DEM.
Be it so;
you shall be indulged.
(He coughs and spits.)LIB.
Come, come-hawk away.
DEM.
What, still more ?
(Spits on.)LIB.
Troth now ;
prithee, do go on-still more.
DEM.
What—from the very bottom of my throat ?
(Spits.)LIB.
Even more still.
DEM.
Why, how long ? (Spits.)LIB.
I want you, even to the deathDEM.
Take you care of a woful mishap, if you please.
LIB.
Of your wife, I mean, not of yourself.
DEM.
For that speech, I give you leave to be free from apprehension.
LIB.
May the Gods grant you whatever you desire.
DEM.
In return, give me your attention.
Why should I ask this of you ?
Or why should I threaten you, because you have not made me acquainted with it ?
Or why, in fine, should I censure my son as other fathers do ?
LIB.
What new affair is this ? (Aside.)
I wonder much what it is, and I'm in dread what the upshot of it may be.
DEM.
In fact, I'm now aware that my son's in love with that Courtesan Philenium, that lives close by.
Is not this as I say, Libanus ?
LIB.
You are upon the right track;
such is the fact.
But a dreadful malady has overtaken him.
DEM.
What is the malady ?
LIB.
Why, that his presents don't equal his promises.
DEM.
Are you, then, one who assists my son in his amours ?
LiD.
I really am, and our Leonida is another.
DEM.
I' faith, you do kindly, and you gain thanks from me.
But this wife of mine, Libanus, don't you know what sort of a person she is ?
LIB.
You are the first to experience it, but we give a guess beforehand.
DEM.
I confess that she is troublesome, and not to be pleased.
LIB.
You say that later than I believed you in it.
DEM.
All parents, Libanus, who listen to me, will show indulgence to their children, inasmuch as they will find their sons more kindly disposed and more affectionate ;
and that do I desire to do myself.
I wish to be loved by mine;
I wish myself to be like my father, who, for my sake, himself in the disguise of a ship-master, carried off from a procurer a female with whom I was in love;
nor was he ashamed, at that time of life, to devise stratagems, and to purchase with good turns me, his son, for himself.
These ways of my father have I resolved to imitate.
For to-day my son Argy­ rippus has entreated me to give him a supply of money for his amours;
and I very much wish in that to oblige my son.
I wish to forward his amours;
I wish him to be fond of myself, his father.
Although his mother keeps him strictly, and with a tight rein, as fathers have been in the habit of doing, all that I dismiss.
Especially as he has deemed me deserving, for him to entrust it to me, I ought to pay all due regard to his feel­ ings.
Inasmuch as he has applied to me, as it is right that a respectful son should do, I wish him to have some money for him to give to his mistress
*****LIB.
You are desiring that which I find you are de­ siring to no purpose.
Your wife brought her servant Saurea with her on her marriage1, who has more in his con­ trol than you have.
DEM.
I received money with her, and for the portion I sold my authority.
Now I'll compress into a few words what I want of you;
my son is now in need of twenty silver minæ:
do you manage that it may be forthwith found for him.
LIB.
From what place in the world ?
DEM.
Cheat me of them.
LIB.
You are talking downright nonsense.
You are bid­ ding me take the clothes from off a naked man.
I, cheat you ?
-come now, fly you without wings, please.
What, am I to cheat you who have nothing in your power for your own self?
Unless you have first cheated your wife out of something.
DEM.
Impose upon or rob myself in any way you can, my wife in any way, my servant Saurea in any way.
I promise you that it shall not prove to your detriment, if you effect it to-day.
LIB.
On the same principle you might bid me to fish in the air, and to hunt with a javelin in the midst of the sea.
DEM.
Take Leonida as your coadjutor2;
devise some plan orother, think of some expedient:
bring it about that my soil this day gets some money to give his mistress.
LIB.
What say you, Demænetus * * * * * if the foe should intercept me, will you ransom me ?
DEM.
I will ransom you.
LIB.
Then do you attend to Something else, whatever you please.
DEM.
I'm off to the Forum, unless you wish for anything..
LIB.
Be off-why are you not walking1 ?
DEM.
And do you hear, too?
LIB.
Well now.
DEM.
If I want you for anything, where will you be ?
LIB.
Wherever it shall be agreable to my feelings.
Really, there's not a person that I shall stand in dread of from this time forward, for fear he might be able to do me an injury, since in your discourse you have disclosed to me all your sentiments.
Why, your own self even I don't stand much in awe of, if I carry this out.
I'll go where I intended, and there I'll commune upon my plans.
DEM.
Do you hear me ?
I shall be with Archibulus, the banker.
LIB.
In the Forum, you mean ?
DEM.
There, if there shall be any occasion for me2.
LIB.
I'll remember it.
(-Exit.DEM. (to himself)
Not any servant can there be more artful than this fellow, nor yet more crafty, nor one that it is more difficult for you to be on your guard against.
If you want anything well managed, entrust it to this same fellow;
he'd rather he should die in wretchedness, than not have that quite completed which he has promised.
For I know that this money is as surely forthcoming for my son, as that I look upon this same walking-stick.
But why am I delaying to go to the Forum where I had intended * ** * * * (Exit.ARG.
Is't thus it is,—me to be shut out of doors ?
Is the the reward that's given to me who deserve so highly of you To him who deserves well you are unkind, to him who deserve
Ill you are indulgent.
But to your own misfortune, for no from this spot will I go to the Triumvirs1, and there I'll take care your names shall be.
I'll punish capitally your­ self and your daughter, you enticers, pests, and destruction of young men!
For, compared with you, the sea is not the sea;
you are a most dangerous set.
For on the sea did I find it, here have I been cleaned out of my wealth.
What I have given, and what kindnesses I have done, I find them all valueless for good, and thrown away.
But from hence­ forth, whatever harm I shall be able to do you, I will do it, and do it at your deserts.
I' faith, I'll reduce you to the verge of poverty, that state from which you have risen.
By my troth, I'll make you to know what you now are, and what you once were;
what you were before I visited that daughter of yours, and, in my passion, bestowed upon her my affec­ tion;
on coarse bread2 you were enjoying your life, in rags, and in want.
And if these you had, especial thanks did you return to all the Divinities.
Now, bad woman, you the same person, when 'tis better with you, don't know me through whose means it is so.
From a wild beast, I'll make you tame through hunger, only trust me for that3.
But I have no reason to blame your daughter herself;
she does not deserve it in the least.
She acts by your command;
she obeys your bidding;
you are her mother, you too her mistress.
I'll revenge myself on you ;
I'll ruin you;
as you are deserving, and as you merit at my hands.
But look now, the hag, how she really doesn't think me worthy for her to come to and address and deprecate my resentment.
But, see, the enticer's coming out at last, I think.
Here, before the door, I'll address her in my own fashion, as I please, since I'm not allowed to do so within.
CLE.
If any purchaser should come, he could not carry him away from me each single word of those for gold Phi­ lippean pieces.
What you say wrongfully against us is good gold and silver.
Your heart is locked up here with us, at the helm of Cupid.
With oars and with sails make haste and fly as fast as you can;
the further you betake yourself to sea, the more the tide will bring you back to harbour.
ARG.
I' faith, I'll be depriving this custom-house officer1 of his dues.
From henceforth I'll persist in treating you as you have deserved of me and mine, since you have treated me not as I deserve, in excluding me from your house.
CLE.
I know that that is rather said with the tongue, than that it will happen in deed.
ARG.
I alone have brought you from obscurity and from want;
if I alone patronize you, you can never return suffi­ cient thanks.
CLE.
Do you still be the only one to patronize me, if you alone will always give me what I ask.
Do you always keep what has been promised you, on this condition, that you surpass others in your presents.
ARG.
What limit is there to be to giving ?
For really you can never be satisfied;
the moment that you've received something, not very long after, you are devising something for you to be asking for.
CLE.
What limit is there to be to your enjoying yourself, and to your indulging your amour ?
Can you never be satis- Red ?
The moment that you have sent her home, that instant, you are directly asking me to send her back to you.
ARG.
In fact, I have given whatever you have demanded of me.
CLE.
And I have sent the damsel to you.
A requital has been given, like for like ;
a return for the money.
ARG.
You treat me badly.
CLE.
Why do you blame me if I do my duty ?
For nowhere is it either feigned in story or represented in pictures or written in poems, where a Dro­ curess, who wishes to thrive, treats any lover well.
ARG.
Still, 'twere right for you to show favour to me at least, that I might last the longer for you.
CLE.
Don't you know, the woman that shows favour to a lover, that same woman shows little favour to herself?
Just like a fish, so is a lover to a procuress;
he's good for nothing if he isn't fresh.
Then it has juice, then it has sweetness;
in any fashion you like you may season it, either stewed or roasted;
in any way you will, you may turn it.
So the lover;
he's ready to give, he longs for something to be asked of him, for there it's taken from a full stock, nor does he know what he's giving, or what mischief he's doing.
Of this matter does the new lover think;
he wishes himself to please his mistress, he wishes to please me, he wishes to please her lady's maidl, he wishes to please the men-servants, he wishes to please the maid-servants as well, and even my dog does he caress, that when it sees him, it may be delighted.
I tell the truth;
it shows cleverness for every person to be fair­ dealing for his own advantage.
ARG.
I've thoroughly learned that this is true, to my own great misfortune.
CLE.
I' faith, if you now bad anything to give, you'd be uttering different remarks;
now, since you've got nothing, you expect to be having her by means of harsh language.
ARG.
'Tis not my way.
CLE.
Nor yet mine, indeed, i' faith, to be sending her to you for nothing;
but this shall be done out of regard for your youthful age and your own sake, since you have rather been the cause of profit to us than of reputation to yourself.
If two talents of silver2 are paid me down, reckoned in my hand, this night will I grant you for nothing, as a present, by reason of my respect for you.
ARG.
What if I haven't it ?
CLE.
I'll believe that you haven't it—still, she shall go to another.
ARG.
Where is that which I have given you already ?
CLE.
Spent;
for if it was remaining to me, the damsel should be sent to you, and I should never ask for anything.
Daylight, water, the sun, the moon, the night, these things I purchase not with money;
the rest, whatever we wish to enjoy, we purchase on Grecian trusty
When we ask bread of the baker, wine from the wineshop—if they receive the money, they give their wares;
the same principle do I go upon.
My hands always have eyes in them;
they believe what they see.
There's an old saying, "trusting is good for nought2 you know whose it is—I say no more.
ARG.
Now I'm clean stripped, you tell me another tale ;
a very different one, I say, you give me now from formerly, .when I was making presents;
a different one from formerly, when with kindness and good words you used to entice me tc your house.
Then did your house even smile upon me, when I used to come to you.
You used to say that I alone of all loved you and her.
When I had given anything, just like the young ones of a pigeon were you both upon my lips;
and all your likings were according to my own liking.
You always kept close to me ;
whatever I requested, whatever I wished, you used to do ;
what I didn't wish and forbade, that, with care­ fulness, you used to avoid, nor did you first venture to attempt to do it.
Now, you jades, you don't much care either what I do wish or what I don't wish.
CLE.
Don't you know ?
This calling of ours is very like that of the fowler.
The fowler, when he has prepared the spot, sprinkles the food about.
The birds are accustomed to the spot.
'Tis necessary for him1 to make an outlay, who seeks for gain.
They eat often;
if they are caught once, they re­ imburse the fowler.
So in like manner here with us.
Our house is the spot, I am the fowler, the courtesan is the food, the couch is the decoy, the lovers the birds.
By kindly welcoming them, by addressing them courteously, by dallying, and by chattering over the wine, and amusing conversation, they are won.
If one of them has touched her bosom, that is not without advantage to the fowler.
If he has taken a kiss, him you may take without a net.
That you should be forgetful of these things, you who have been schooled so long!
ARG.
That's your own fault, in turning away from you a scholar half instructed.
CLE.
Come back again without hesitation, if you've got the pay;
for the present, be off.
(Pretends to go.)ARG.
Stay, stay;
don't you bear me?
Say what you think it fair that I should give you for her, that for this year she may be with no one else.
CLE.
What, you ?
Twenty minæ.
And on this condition:
if any other person shall bring them first to me, to you— good-bye.
ARG.
But IThere's still something that I wish to say to you before you go.
CLE.
Say what you please.
ARG.
I'm not entirely ruined yet;
there's still something more left for me to come to ruin.
I have wherewithal to give you what you ask;
but I'll give it you on my own terms, that you may be enabled to understand that throughout all this year she is to be at my service, and that, in the meantime, she is to admit no other man whatever to her, besides myself.
CLE.
Why, if you choose, the male-servants that are at home, I'll make eunuchs of.
In fine, take you care and bring articles of agreement that we will be as you wish.
Impose conditions upon us as you wish, and as you shall choose.
Do you only bring the money with you, I'll readily put up with the rest.
The doors of procurers are very like those of a custom-house officer;
if you bring anything, then they are opened;
if there is nothing for you to give, then the doors are not opened.
(Goes into her house.)ARG. (to himself).
I'm undone, if I don't procure these twenty minæ.
And really, unless I make away with this much money, I must come to destruction.
Now I'll go to the Forum, and make trial with my resources, with all my endeavours.
I'll beg, I'll earnestly entreat each friend as I see him;
both good and bad am I determined to apply to, and make trial of.
But if I can't borrow it, I'll take it up at interest, I'm resolved.
(Goes into the house of DE­ MÆNETUS.)LIB.
Upon my faith, Libanus, it really were better for you now to be waking, and to be devising some plan for pro­ curing the money.
A long time has now elapsed, since you parted with your master and went to the Forum.
For that end that you might devise some plan for procuring the money, there till this time of day have you been sleeping at your ease.
Why don't you away with all slothfulness from yourself, and remove all sluggishness, and betake yourself again to your former dexterous ingenuity.
Preserve your master;
take you care, too, how you do the same that other servants are wont, who employ a clever ingenuity in cheating their master ?
Whence shall I get it ?
Whom shall I diddle out of it ?
Whither shall 1 steer this fly-boat?
'Tis settled, 'tis confirmed by auspices;
on each side do the birds give good omens.
The woodpecker and the crow are on my right, the raven, as well, upon my left.
They are persuading me to it:
i' faith, I'm resolved to follow your advice.
(Starts and listens.)
But what means this, that the woodpecker is tapping the elm-tree ?
That's not for nothing.
Troth, for certain, so far as I can gather omens from augury, the rods are in readiness for my own back, or for Saurea the chamberlain.
But what means this that Leonida is running this way out of breath ?
I fear that this bodes ill for my trumped-up schemes.
(Stands apart.
LEON. (to himself).
Where now shall I find Libanus, or my master's son, that I may make them more mirthful than is Mirth herself1 ?
Great booty and a triumph do I bring them on my arrival.
Inasmuch as together with me they drink, together with me they are wont to wench, why, this booty that I've got, together with them will I share it.
LIB. (apart).
This fellow has been robbing a house, if he has been acting after his usual manner.
Woe to the person that has so carelessly kept the door!
LEON. (to himself).
I could be ready to be a slave for an age, if I could only meet with Libanus.
LIB. (apart).
I' faith, with my assistance, indeed, you shall never be free a bit the sooner.
LEON. (to himself).
I'd give two hundred teeming lashed on my back as well.
LIB. (apart).
He's giving away all his substance, for he carries his treasures on his back3.
LEON. (to himself).
But if time should intervene upon this opportunity, never, upon my faith, will he hereafter obtain it again, even with white horses4.
He'll be deserting his master in the siege ;
he'll be increasing the courage of the foe.
But if with me he is desirous to seize hold upon this oppor­ tunity which has presented itself, very great bounties brimful of joyousness, will he, together with myself, be producing for his masters, both for the son and the father.
So that, for life, they will be indebted to us both, bound by our services.
LIB. (apart).
He's talking of persons being bound5, I don't know who.
I don't like it;
I fear for us in common, lest he may have been cheating in some cheatery.
LEON. (to himself).
I'm utterly undone, unless I find Li­ banus at once, wherever in the world he is.
LIB. (apart).
This fellow's looking out for an accomplice, to unite with himself in a bad design.
I don't like it:
'tis?
a portentous sign that instant, when a person trembles that sweats1.
LEON. (to himself).
But why, as I hasten, do I loiter here with my feet, and make myself so bounteous with my tongue ?
Why don't I bid it be quiet, that in its talkativeness is wearing out the day ?LIB. (apart).
Upon my faith, an unfortunate man, to check his patroness;
for if he has done anything roguishly, his tongue perjures itself in his behalf.
LEON. (to himself).
I'll make haste, lest I should be pro­ viding a safe keeping for my spoil too late.
LIB. (apart).
What spoil is this ?
I'll go meet him, and enquire what it is.
(He accosts him.)
I wish you health in as loud a voice as my strength admits of.
LEON.
Exerciser of the whip, health to you.
LIB.
Keeper of the gaol, how do you do ?
LEON.
Ha!
colonizer of the chains.
LIB.
Ha !
delight of the scourges.
LEON.
When naked, how many pounds do you say you are in weight ?
LIB.
Upon my faith, I don't know.
LEON.
I know that you don't know;
but, i' faith, I who have weighed you do know.
Tied up naked, you were a hundred pounds in weight, when you were hanging with your feet downwards.
LIB.
On what evidence is that ?
LEON.
I'll tell you ou what evidence, and in what way.
When you are tied up with a full hundred pounds to your feet2, when the manacles are fastened to your hands, and tied to the beam, you are weighing neither more nor less, than as being a worthless and good-for-nothing fellow.
LIB.
Woe be to you !
LEON.
That, Servitude bequeaths to you by her will.
LIB.
I wish this skirmishing of words to be cut short.
What matter is this ?
LEON.
Am I sure in trusting you ?
LIB.
You may, without hesitation.
LEON.
If you wish to assist our master's son in his amour, there is so much of a good opportunity on a sudden, but still mingled with evil-all the hangman's days will be rendered famous by ourselves.
Libanus, now have we occasion to find some boldness and inventiveness.
An exploit so great have I thought of just now, that we two may be pronounced the most deserving of all for torture to befall us.
LIB.
'Twas on that account I was wondering why my shoulder-blades were aching just now, which were beginning to prognosticate that there was some danger for them at home.
Whatever it is, speak out.
LEON.
'Tis great booty with great risk.
LIB.
If indeed all persons by compact were to collect all the tortures, I have, I fancy, a back at home, so that I need not seek it out of doors.
LEON.
If you maintain such firmness of resolve, then we are all right.
LIB.
Why, if the matter were to be atoned for by my back, I could wish to seize the public money:
I'll persist in my denial, and I'll endure all;
in fine, I'll forswear myself.
LEON.
Ah!
that's true valour, when occasion is, for one to endure misfortune with boldness.
He that endures misfor­ tune with boldness, that man afterwards enjoys good for­ tune.
LIB.
Why don't you tell the matter at once ?
I'm longing to tempt the scourge.
LEON. (breathing hard).
Ask deliberately each particular then, that I may rest me.
Don't you see that I'm still out of breath with running ?
LIB.
Well, well, I'll wait your pleasure, even, in fact, till you die.
LEON.
Where's our master, pray ?
LIB.
The old one is at the Forum, the young one is here in-doors.
LEON.
That's enough for me then.
LIB.
Is it then that you've become a rich man ?
LEON.
Leave off your raillery.
LIB.
I'll have done;
for my ears are in expectation of what you are bringing me.
LEON.
Give your attention, that equally with myself you may learn this.
LIB.
I'm silent, then.
LEON.
You oblige me.
Don't you remember that our chamberlain sold some Arcadian asses to a dealer of Pella1 ?
LIB.
I remember it;
after that, what then ?
LEON.
Well, he has sent some money here then to be paid to Saurea, for the asses;
a young man has just now come who has brought this money.
LIB.
Where is this person ?
LEON.
You think he ought to be devoured this instant, if you could see him.
LIB.
Aye, to be sure.
But, however, you are speaking, I suppose, of those asses, aged and lame, whose hoofs were quite worn away to their very thighs ?
LEON.
Those same ones, that carried the elm twigs hither from the country, for your use.
LIB.
I understand you;
and the same ones carried you from here, bound, into the country2.
LEON.
You say what's quite correct.
But as I was sitting in the barber's shop, he began to make enquiries of me, whether I knew a certain Demænetus, the son of Strata.
At once I said that I knew him, and that I was his servant;
and I pointed out our house.
LIB.
After that, what then ?
LEON.
He said that he was bringing the money for the asses to the chamberlain Saurea, twenty minæ in amount ;
but that he himself didn't know the individual, who he was, but that he knew Demænetus quite well.
Since he spoke thus to this effectLIB.
What then?
LEON.
Listen then, and you'll know.
At once I made myself courteous, and a person of con­ sequence.
I said that I was the chamberlain.
Thus, in these terms did he answer me:
" Upon my faith, I don't know Saurea, nor yet of what appearance he is.
It isn't fair for you to blame me;
but if you like, bring here Demænetus, your mas­ ter, whom I do know;
I'll not prevent you taking the money then."
I said that I would bring him, and that I should be at home immediately.
He's about to go to the baths1, from there he'll afterwards come here.
What plan do you think, now, I ought to adopt ?
Tell me.
LIB.
Why, I'm thinking of this, how to get between the money, and the stranger, and Saurea.
At present this matter is rough-hewn;
but if this stranger brings here the money first, then are we both at once shut out from it.
But the old man to-day took me apart at a distance from the house, and threatened me and yourself that we should be tasters of the elm twigs, if Argyrippus didn't this very day get twenty minæ of silver.
He commanded that we should cheat either the chamberlain or his own wife, and said that he would give the aid he promised.
Now, do you go to the Forum to our master, and tell him this, how we are going to manage;
that you, from Leonida, are going to be the cham­ berlain Saurea, until the dealer has brought the money for the asses.
LEON.
I'll do as you request me.
LIB.
In the meantime, I'll amuse him here, if by chance he should come first.
LEON.
But what say you?
LIB.
What do you want ?
LEON.
If I give you a blow on the cheek with my fist, by-and-by, while I'm personating Saurea2, don't you be offended.
LIB.
I' faith, but you'll have a care not to be touching me, if you are wise;
you'll surely have changed your name to day with a bad omen1.
LEON.
Prithee, do endure it with resolution.
LIB.
Do you endure the cuff that I, too, shall be giving you in return.
LEON.
I speak as it's in the habit of being done.
LIB.
I' faith, and I speak, too, of how I'm likely to act.
LEON.
Don't refuse me.
LIB.
Why I promise, I tell you, to give you a like return, just as you deserve.
LEON.
I'm off;
I know that you'll put up with it by- and-by.
But who's this ?
'Tis he—'tis the very man him­ self.
I'll return here just now;
in the meantime do you detain him here;
I want to inform the old gentleman.
LIB.
Well, do your duty, then, and fly.
Ass-D. (to himself).
According as it was pointed out to me, this must be the house where Demænetus is said to live.
(To the BOY.)
Go, boy, and knock, and call Saurea the chamber­ lain out here, if he's in-doors.
(The BOY goes to knock.)LIB.
Who's breaking in our door in this fashion ?
Enough there, I say, if you hear me at all.
Ass-D. No one has touched it as yet:
are you out of your senses ?
LiE.
Why I thought that you had touched it, because you were steering your course in that direction.
I don't want the door, my fellow-slave2, to be thumped by you;
I really am attached to our house.
Ass-D. I' faith, there's no fear of the hinges being broken off the doors, if you answer all who make enquiries in this fashion.
LIB.
This door is of this habit;
it cries out at once for the porter, if it sees any door-kicker at a distance coming towards it.
But what are you come for ?
What are you enquiring about ?
Ass-D. I wanted Demænetus.
LIB.
If he were at home, I would tell you so.
Ass-D. Well, his chamberlain then?
LIB.
No more is he at home.
Ass-D. Where is he ?
LIB.
He said he was going to the barber's.
Ass-D. Hasn't he returned, since he went there ?
LIB.
I' faith, he hasn't.
What did you want ?
Ass-D. He was to have received twenty minæ of silver, if he had been in.
LIB.
What was it for ?
Ass-D. He sold some asses at market to a dealer from Pella.
LIB.
I understand;
you are bringing it now.
I think that he'll be here just now.
Ass-D. Of what appearance is your chamberlain Saurea ?
If it's he, I shall be able to know at once.
LIB.
Lantern-jawed, with reddish hair, a little pot-bellied, with glaring eyes, middling stature, sour aspect.
Ass-D. A painter couldn't have more correctly described his appearance—— And, i' faith, I see the very man;
he's coming this way, wagging his head.
LIB.
Whoever gets in his way when he's in a passion, he'll be for striking him.
Ass-D. By my faith, if, indeed, he were coming filled with the threats and the courage of the grandson of Æacus1, if he were to touch me in his wrath, in his wrath he would be getting a thrashing.
LEON. (to himself).
What's this to do here ?
Not a person cares a bit about my orders!
How did I order Libanus to come to the barber's shop, and he didn't come at all.
I' faith, for sure he hasn't consulted well for his back and his legs.
Ass-D. (to himself).
This is a very overbearing fellow.
LIB. (to the Ass-DEALER).
Woe to me this day!
LEON.
I bid welcome to Libanus, the freed-man!
Are you set at liberty now ?
LIB.
I do implore you.
LEON.
In good sooth, to your great misfortune surely have you fallen in my way.
Why didn't you come to the barber's shop, as I ordered you?
LIB. (pointing to the ASS-DEALER).
This person de­ ained me.
LEON.
I' faith, if in fact you were now to say that supreme Jove had detained you, and he were present to sue for you, you shouldn't escape the evil consequences.
Whip-knave, did you disobey my orders ?
(Offers to strike him.)LIB. (to the ASS-DEALER).
Stranger, I'm done for.
Ass-D. Prithee, Saurea, for my sake, don't beat him.
LEON.
I wish, now, I had a whip in my handAss-D. Prithee, do be appeased.
LEON. —
With which to lash your sides, which have grown callous with blows.
(To the Ass-DEALER, who interposes.)
Stand off this way;
let me be the death of this fellow who is continually inflaming me with anger-a thief to whom I can never once enjoin a single thing, but-that I must command the same things a hundred times, and din them in his earsl.
For that reason, now, by my troth, what with bawling and passion, I cannot endure the labour.
Have you, you rascal, (pointing) ordered this dirt to be re­ moved hence from the door ?
Have you ordered the labours of the spiders to be swept down from the pillars ?
Have you ordered those bosses on our door2 to be brought to brightness ?
It's of no use;
I must walk about with a stick, as though I were a lame man.
Because only for these single three days I have been giving my constant attendance at the Forum, in order to find some one who requires money upon interest, here, in the meantime, are you sleeping at home, and my master is living in a pigstye, not in a house.
(He strikes LIBANUS.)
There now, take you that.
LIB. (to the ASS-DEALER).
Prithee, stranger, do take my part.
Ass-D. Saurea, for my sake, I entreat you, do let him go.
LEON.
Hark you!
has any one paid for the carriage of that olive oil ?
LIB.
He has paid.
LEON.
To whom was it given?
LIB.
To Stichus himself, your deputy.
LEON.
Tut!
you're trying to mollify me1.
I know that he is my deputy, and that there isn't a servant in the house who is more valuable to his master than he is.
But the wines that I sold yesterday to Exærambus, the wine merchant, has he yet paid Stichus for them ?
LIB.
I think he has, in full;
for I saw Exærambus himself bringing hither his banker.
LEON.
On such terms would I always deal2 ;
before, what I've trusted, I've hardly been paid within a year after.
Now he's quite in a hurry;
even of his own accord he brings him to the house, and writes a transfer of the money3.
LEON.
Has Dromo paid down the wages agreed upon ?
LIB.
Less than half, I think.
LEON.
What about the re­ mainder ?
LIB.
He said that he would pay it directly it was paid4 to him;
for it was retained until he had finished the work that was agreed on to be done by him.
LEON.
The cups that I lent to Philodamus, has he brought them back ?
LIB.
Not yet.
LEON.
What, not yet ?
If you wish to make a present5, lend to a person that is a friendAss-D. (aside).
I'faith, I'm quite undone;
he'll be just now driving me away with his ill-temper.
LIB. (in a low voice to LEONIDA).
Hallo!
you, enough now.
Do you hear what he's saying ?
LEON. (in the same way to LIBANUS).
I hear, and I'll have done.
Ass-D. (aside).
At last, I think, he has done:
now it's best to accost him before he commences again to prate.
(To LEONIDA.) '
How soon, sir, will you give me your attentionLEON.
Oh, by all means-have you been here any time ?
Troth, I didn't observe you;
pray, don't lay it to my charge:
anger has so blinded my eyesight.
Ass-D. 'Tisn't to be wondered at.
But if he's at home, I was wanting Demænetus.
LEON.
Libanus says that he isn't within.
But still, if you like to pay that money over to me, I'll give you au acquittance that the account is discharged as to that item.
Ass-D. This way rather, for me to pay you in the presence of your master, Demænetus.
LIB.
My master knows him, and he my master.
Ass-D. In his master's presence, I'll pay him.
LIB.
At my peril, so you only pay him, I'll engage the matter's safe.
For if our old gentleman were to know that confidence wasn't placed in him, to whom he himself always entrusts the management of all matters, he would be angry.
LEON.
1 don't much care;
don't let him not pay it, if he don't like;
so let him stand here.
LIB.
Give it him, I say.
Oh dear, I'm sadly afraid that he'll be thinking that I've persuaded you not to trust him;
prithee, do give.
it and don't be afraid.
Upon my word, it will be safe.
Ass-D. I think it will be-so long, indeed, as I myself keep it in my hand.
I'm a stranger;
I don't know Saurea.
LIB.
Well, know him now then.
Ass-D. It may be he, it may not be lie;
i' faith, I know not;
if it's he, why then it must be he.
I know for sure that I shall give this up to no person that I don't know.
LEON. (aside).
Troth now, may all the Gods confound the fellow.
(Aloud to LIBANUS.)
Take care you don't entreat him with a word.
He's arrogant, because he's fingering my twenty minæ.
No one will take it.
(To the ASS-DEALER.)
Take yourself off home, be off from here, and don't be troublesome.
Ass-D. You are in too angry mood:
it isn't right for a person who is a slave to give himself airs.
LIB.
By my faith, to your own great misfortune now are you talking uncivilly to him.
Dirty, worthless fellow, don't you see he's angry ?LEON. (to the ASS-DEALER).
Be off then.
LIB. (to the ASS-DEALER).
Scoundrelly fellow.
(Aside to him.)
Prithee, do give him the money lest he should abuse you.
Ass-D. On my word, you are seeking evil for yourselves.
LEON. (to LIBANUS).
By the powers, your legs shall be brokenl, if you don't proclaim this shameless fellow.
LIB.
Troth, I'm undone.
Be off, you shameless fellow.
LEON.
You rascal.
LIB. (to the ASS-DEALER).
Won't you venture to assist me, you rascal ?
LEON.
Do you persist in soliciting the scamp ?
Ass-D. How's this ?
(To LEONIDA.)
Do you, rascal, who are a slave, speak abusively to a free man ?
LEON.
Give him a beating.
Ass-D. By my faith, that surely shall befall yourself to get a beating as soon as ever I shall see Demænetus this day.
I summon you to judgment2.
LEON.
I shan't go.
Ass-D. You won't go ?
Remem­ berLEON.
I do remember.
Ass-D. I' faith, I'll have satis­ faction out of your back.
LEON.
Woe unto you?
What, villain-satisfaction to be given by us to you indeed ?
Ass-D. Aye, and even this very day satisfaction shall be given me for your abusive language.
LEON.
How now, whip-knave ?
How say you, hang-dog ?
Do you suppose that we shall run away from our master ?
Go this instant then to our master, where you were citing us just now, and where you were wishing to go.
Ass-D. What, now at last ?
Still, you shall never get a coin of money away from me, unless Demænetus shall order me to give it.
LEON.
Do so.
Come, move on then.
Are you to offer insults to another person, and are they not to be repeated to yourself?
I'm a man as much as you are..
Ass-D. No doubt such is the fact.
LEON.
Follow me this way, then.
With your good leavel I would now say this:
not a person has ever accused me by reason of my deserving it, nor is there in Athens one other individual, this day, whom they would think they could as safely trust.
Ass-D. Perhaps so:
but still, you shall never this day per­ suade me to entrust to you, whom I don't know, this money.
A man to a man is a wolf2, not a man, when the other doesn't know of what character he is.
LEON.
Now at last you are appeasing me3 :
I was sure that this day you would give satisfaction to this poor head of mine ;
although I'm in mean garb, still, I'm well to do, nor can an estimate of my means be formedfrom it.
Ass-D. Perhaps so.
LEON.
Still more then I tell you :
Periphanes, a merchant of Rhodes, a rich man, in the ab­ sence of my master, himself alone paid over to me, in private, a talent of silver, and trusted me, nor was he de­ ceived in it.
Ass-D. Perhaps so.
LEON.
And you, too, yourself, as well, if you had enquired about me of other people, would, i' faith, I'm quite sure, have entrusted to me what you now have with you.
Ass-D. I don't deny it.

And am I unable to render you obedient to my in.
junctions ?
Or are you so disposed as to be free from the control of your mother ?
PHIL.
How could I propitiate Piety1, if I could desire to please you, being endowed with these manners, after the fashion, mother, that you enjoin upon me ?
CLE.
Is it consistent with propriety for you to oppose my precepts ?
PHIL.
How SO ?
CLE.
Is this worshipping Piety, to lessen the authority of a mother ?
PHIL.
Those who act right I blame not, nor do I love those who do wrong.
CLE.
You are a very prating, lovesick girl.
PHIL.
Mother, that is my living2.
His tongue woos me, his person seeks me, his passion pleads, opportunity prompts.
CLE.
I was purposing to convince you.
Are you come as my accuser ?
PHIL.
By my troth, I neither do accuse you, nor do I think it right I should do so ;
but I do complain of my lot, when I am separated from him whom I love.
CLE.
Will then one bit of the whole day's talk be left for myself?
PHIL.
Both my share of the speaking and your own do I give up to you.
Do you yourself keep the signal3 both for speaking and for being silent.
But, i' faith, if I only put up my oars in the boat-house1, while I'm resting, all the welfare of the household is at a standstill for you.
CLE.
How say you, the out and out most insolent woman that ever I saw ?
How often have I forbidden you to speak to.
Argyrippus, the son of Demænetus, or to touch him, or to hold discourse with him, or to look at him ?
What has he ever given ?
What has he ordered to be brought to our house ?
Or do you fancy to yourself that smooth words are gold ?-that clever speeches are as good as presents ?
Of your own accord you fell in love with him;
of your own accord you go after him;
of your own accord you request him to be sent for to you.
Those who are givers, those same you laugh at;
those who are cheating us, you are dying for.
If any one promises you that he'll make you rich when his mother dies, ought you to be waiting for that ?
I' faith, a great risk impends over ourselves and the household, that we may die of hunger while we are awaiting her death.
Now therefore, unless he brings me here twenty minæ of silver, upon my word, though profuse of his tears, he shall certainly be turned from here out of doors.
This day's the end of2 excuses for poverty at my house.
PHIL.
If, my mother, you were to order me to go without victuals, I would submit.
CLE.
I don't forbid you to love those who give that for the sake of which they ought to be loved.
PHIL.
What, mother, if this inclination of mine is fixed?
What am I to do ?
Tell me.CLE.
Oh dear-look at my head3, if, indeed, you consider your own interest.
PHIL.
Even the shepherd, mother, that feeds the sheep of another, has a certain one of his own to be the consoler of his hopes.
For the sake of my affection, do allow me to love Argyrippus only, who is my choice.
CLE.
Go in-doors, for, upon my word, there is really nothing more impudent than yourself.
PHIL.
Mother, you have given birth to a daughter obe­ dient to your commands.
(They go into the house.)LEON.
Great praise and thanks we give deservedly to per­ fidy, when relying upon our tricks, our stratagems, and our devices, upon our confidence in our shoulder-blades and the hardihood resulting from the elm-twigs so oft applied, against the whips, the searing-irons, the crosses, and the fetters, the cords, the chains, the prisons, the stocks, the shackles, the collars, and taskmasters most cruel and well acquainted with our backs, who many a time before have imprintedl scars upon our shoulder-blades ;
by conquering, now, these legions, troops and armies of thieves, by our prowess, through our perjuries, 0 brave, have we gained the victory.
This, through the valour of this comrade of mine, and through my own courtesy, has been brought about.
LIB.
What man is there more firm than myself at enduring stripes ?
LEON.
By the powers, you who can extol your exploits now, as I can do exploits, which in peace and in warfare.
you have so villanously performed;
verily, in troth, many in number may they be now recounted according to your deserts;
where you have defrauded him that trusted you, where you have proved faithless to your master, where knowingly and wilfully you have on solemn oath been per­ jured, where you have bored through party walls, where you have been detected in theft, where you have full oft pleaded your cause, as you hung up, against eight clever, hardened fellows2, sturdy stripers.
LIB.
Certainly I do admit, Leonida, that it is true as you say.
But verily, in troth, your many misdeeds, too, may be recounted as well and truly;
where wilfully you have proved faithless to the trusting, where you have been detected in theft and scourged in public, where you have proved for.
sworn, where you have laid hands on sacred things, where to your masters you have full oft proved a loss, a trouble, and a disgrace, where you have stoutly denied that that was given to you which had been entrusted to you, where you have proved more faithful to your wench than to your friend, where through your hardihood you have frequently reduced to wea­ riness eight sturdy lictors, armed with pliant twigs of elm.
(To the AUDIENCE.)
Is the compliment ill repaid in the way that I've praised my comrade ?
LEON.
Just as befits both me and yourself, and our dis­ positions.
LIB.
Now drop this, and answer me this that I ask.
LEON.
Enquire of me what you please.
LIB.
Have you got the twenty silver minæ ?
LEON.
Guess ———
Upon my word, the old gentleman, Demænetus, has been very obliging to us.
How cleverly he pretended that I was Saurea.
With the greatest difficulty did I withhold my laughter, when he rebuked the stranger, because in his absence he had been unwilling to put conn­ dence in me;
and with what readiness did he call me Saurea the chamberlain.
LIB.
Stop a moment.
LEON.
What's the matter ?
LIB.
Isn't this Philenium that's coming from in-doors, and Argyrippus with her.
LEON.
Keep silence, 'tis he;
let's listen quietly to them.
In tears, she holds him, weeping, by the lappet of his gar­ ment ;
what, I wonder, am I to say is the matter ?
LIB.
Let's listen in silence.
LEON.
Dear me, a thought, I' faith, has just come into my mind;
I very much wish I had a long stick here.
LIB:
For what reason ?
'LEON.
With which to beat these assesl, if perchance they should begin to bray out here, from within the bag.
( They stand apart.)ARG.
Why are you holding me back ?
PHIL.
Because, as I love you, I cannot bear your de­ parting.
ARG.
Farewell.
PHIL.
I should fare somewhat better, if you were to remain here.
ARG.
Blessings on you.
PHIL.
Do you wish for blessings on me, to whom you are bringing disease by your departure ?
ARG.
Your mother has bid me the last farewell 1;
she has requested me to go home.
PHIL.
A bitter death will she'cause her daughter, if I must part from you.
LIB. (apart, to LEONIDA).
Troth now, the man has been turned out of doors there.
LEON. .(apart).
Such is the fact.
ARG.
Prithee;
do let me go.
PHIL.
Whither are you going now ?
Why don't you stay here ?
ARG.
This night, if you choose, I'll stay.
LIB. (apart);
Don't you hear him ?
How profuse he is of his attentions by night.
But now, in the daytime, he's en­ gaged ;
surely he's a Solon2 to write laws whereby the public may regulate itself.
Psha!
those who would be in readiness for themselves to pay obedience to his laws, would decidedly never do any good;
they would be drinking night and day.
LEON. (apart).
Troth now, for sure, he wouldn't budge a foot from her if she would let him, who is now in such haste, and is threatening that he's going away from her.
LIB. (apart).
Now make an end of your talk, that I may catch his discourse.
ARG.
Farewell!
PHIL.
Whither are you hastening ?
ARG.
Kindly fare you well!
I shall see you in the other world3.
For indeed now, so soon as I can, I shall sever my­ self from life.
PHIL.
Prithee, why, while I do not deserve it, do you wish to consign me to death ?
ARG.
I—you ?
whom, if I were to hear that you were in want of life, at once would I present you my own life, and from my own would add to yours.
PHIL.
Why, then, do you threaten that you will quit life ?
For what do you suppose that I shall do, if you do that which you are talking of?
I'm determined to do everything exactly the same to myself that you do to your­ self.
ARG. 0 ! sweeter than honey are you to me.
PHIL.
And surely you are my life.
Embrace me.ARG.
I do so with pleasure.
(They embrace.)PHIL.
Would that thus we might be carried to the tomb.
LEON. (apart).
0 Libanus, how wretched is the man that loves.
LIB. (apart).
Aye, but surely, faith, the man that's hang­ ing up1 is much more wretched.
LEON. (apart).
I know that, who have had experience of it.
Let's go round them:
let's accost them, one on the one side, one on the other.
(One walks towards them from each side.)LIB.
Health to you, master.
But is this female, smoke, that you are embracing ?
ARG.
Why so ?
LIB.
Because your eyes are filled with tears ;
'twas for that reason I asked.
ARG.
One who would have been a protector to you, you have lost.
LIB.
I' faith, I surely haven't lost one;
for this reason, be­ cause I never had one.
LEON.
Health to you, Philenium.
PHIL.
What you desire, the Gods will give you.
LIB.
I could desire your favours, and a cask of wine, if wishes were to come to pass.
ARG.
Whip-knave, beware how you speak a word.
LIB.
Why, 'tis for you, not for myself, I wish it.
ARG.
For that reason, then, say on what you please.
LIB.
(pointing to LEONIDA.
Troth, I'd lice to give him a beating.
LEON.
Who, pray, would allow you to do so, you frizzle- pated1 mountebank ?
Could you thrash me, you, who reckon as your daily food your own thrashings ?
ARG.
How far superior, Libanus, are your lots to my own, who never will live this day until the evening.
LIB.
For what reason, prithee ?
ARG. (pointing to PHI­ LENIUM).
Because I'm in love with her, and she's in love with me, and nowhere have I anything to bestow upon her ;
for that reason has her mother expelled me with all my affection from her house.
The twenty minæ of silver have brought me to my end, which the young man, Diabolus, de­ clared that he would give her this day, in order that she mightn't send her anywhere, for this whole year, except to himself.
Don't you see of what force are twenty minæ of silver, or what they can effect?
The man who parts with them is happy ;
I, who part not with them, am undone.
LIB.
Has he already paid2 the money ?
ARG.
He hasn't paid it.
LIB.
Be of good courage ;
don't be afraid.
LEON. (to LIBANUS).
Step this way, Libanus, I want you.
LIB.
Certainly, if you want anything.
(Steps aside, putting his hand on the shoulder of LEONIDA.)ARG.
I entreat of you, is it more pleasant in this same matter for you to discourse hugging one another ?
LIB.
Understand, master, that all things are not equally sweet to all persons.
'Tis pleasant for you lovers to converse, hugging one another ;
I care nothing for his hugging (point­ in!! to LEONIDA), and (pointing to PHILINIULM) she despises mine.
Do you then yourself do that which you would be suggesting to us to do.
ARG.
Indeed I will, and really with pleasure, i' faith.
(Placing his arm round PHILENIUM'S neck.)
In the mean­ time, if it seems good to you, do you step aside there.
LEON. (to LIBANUS).
Should you like our master to be bantered a bit ?
LIB.
He really is deserving of it.• LEON.
Should you like me, in his presence, to make Phi lenium embrace me ?
LIB.
I' faith, I should like it.
LEON.
Follow me this way (They join ARGYRIPPUS.)ARG.
Is there any escape at all ?
Have you conversed enough ?
LEON.
Listen, and give attention, and devour my words.
First of all, that we are your slaves, we don't deny ;
but if twenty silver minæ are forthcoming for you, by what name will you call us ?
ARG.
Freed-men.
LEON.
And not patrons ?
ARG.
That in preference.
LEON. (produces the baq).
Here are twenty minæ in this bag.
These, if you like, I'll give you.
ARG.
May the Deities ever preserve you, protector of your master, honor to the people, treasury of resources, preserver of my inner mail, and commander of love;
place it here, put down that bag, here on the spot, at once2.
LEON.
I don't like you, who are my master, to carry this load.
ARG.
Still, do you rid yourself of the trouble, and fasten that bag to myself.
LEON.
I'll carry it, porter-like;
you, as befits my master, go, without any burden, before me.
ARG.
How now ?
Why's this ?
Why don't you give up the bag3 here, for your master to feel its weight ?
LEON.
Bid her to whom I'm about to give it, to beg and entreat it of me.
For that's a dangerous spot where you bid me put it down at once.
PHIL. (to LEONIDA).
Apple of my eye, my rose, my life, my delight, Leonida, do give me the money, and don't sever us lovers asunder.
LEON. (to PHILENIUM).
Call me, then, your little spar- row, your chicken, your quail, your pet.
lamb:
say that I'm your pet kid or your pet calf;
take me by the ears, press your lips to my lips.
ARG.
She, kiss you, you whip-scoundrel ?
LEON.
Really, how unbecoming it does seem!
But, by the powers, you shan't get it this day, if my knees are not embraced.
ARG. (aside).
Necessity compels to anything.
(To LEO­ NIDA.)
Let them be embraced (kneels down and embraces his knees):
now give what I'm asking for.
PHIL.
Come, my Leonida, prithee do bring safety to your master thus in love.
Redeem yourself from him by this ser­ vice, and purchase him for yourself with this money.
LEON.
You are very pretty and amiable;
and if this were mine, you should never this day ask me for it, but I would give it you :
'tis better for you to ask it of him (pointing to LIBANUS), for 'twas he gave it me to keep for him.
Ap­ proach him then prettily, my pretty one.
(-Delivers the bag to LIBANUS.)
Take this, please, Libanus.
ARG.
Scoundrel, are you still trifling with me ?
LEON.
I' faith, I should never have done so, if you hadn't embraced my knees so roughly.
(Aside to LIBANUS.)
Come, please, in your turn, do you at once have some sport with him, and give her an embrace.
LIB. (aside to LEONIDA).
Hold your tongue ;
trust mefor that.
ARG.
Why don't we accost him, Philenium ? (pointing to LIBANUS)—really, a very worthy fellow, upon my faith, and not like this thief (pointing to LEONIDA).
LIB. (aside to LEONIDA).
We must walk up and down;
now, in my turn, they'll be entreating me.
ARG.
By heaven, Libanus, I do entreat you, be pleased by your deeds to come to your master's rescue;
do give me those twenty minæ:
you see that thus in love I stand in need of them.
LIB.
It shall be seen to ;
I wish it done;
return here at nightfall.
Now bid her, ever so little, to be- and entreat them of me.
PHIL. (to LIBANUS).
Do you wish me to begin with ca­ ressing, or with kissing you ?
LIB.
Why, really, with them both.
PHIL.
And do you then, I do entreat you, prove the saving of us both.
ARG.
0 Libanus, my patron, do give me that;
'tis more becoming for the freed-man1, than for the patron, tc be carrying a burden in the street.
PHIL.
My Libanus, golden apple of my eye, the gift an the very grace of love;
there's a dear, whatever you wish, I'll do ;
prithee, do give us that money.
LIB.
Call me, then, your little duck, dove, or your pup­ pet ;
your swallow, jackdaw, little sparrow, your mannikin :
make of me the reptile that crawls, so that I may have a double tongue2 ;
enfold me in your arms, and embrace my neck.
ARG.
She, embrace you, villain ?
LIB.
Really, how un­ deserving I do seem.
You shan't for no purpose have uttered a speech so unseemly against me.
By my troth, if indeed you expect to get this money, this day you shall carry myself on your shoulders.
ARG.
What ?
I, carry you?
LIB.
Otherwise, you shan't get this money from me.
ARG.
Heavens, I'm undone!
Still, if indeed it is de­ corous for the master to carry the servant, mount.
LIB.
In this way are proud people wont to be tamed.
Stand still then, just as you were wont to do when formerly a boy3.
Do you understand what I say?
(He prepares to get upon the shoulders of ARGYRIPPUS.)
Aye—so—move on:
I praise you much ;
not any horse is there more clever than yourself as a horse.
ARG. (while stooping).
Get on, directly.
LIB.
I'll do so.
(He gets on.)
Hallo !—what's the matter ?
How are you going ?
By my troth, I'll deprive you of your barley then, if you don't amble4, lifting up your feet.
ARG.
Prithee, Libanus, there's enough now.
LIB.
Never this day, by my troth, shall you get anything by entreaty.
For now up hill with the spur will I push on my steed.
After that, I'll deliver you to the millers, that there you may be tortured as you runl.
Stand still, that I may now at once get down for the hill, although you are but a bad one.
(Gets off his shoulders.)ARG.
Well now-since you've both made fun of me just as you liked, are you going to give the money ?
LIB.
Why, yes, if, indeed, you erect to me a statue and an altar, and then sacrifice an ox to me here as though to a God;
for I am the Divinity Salvation to you.
LEON.
Nay, but, master, do you betake yourself away from him, and do you come to me.
And, what he has demanded for himself, will you erect a statue for me, and offer prayers to me?
ARG.
But what Divinity am I to call you ?
LEON.
Fortune, and that the Propitious one2.
ARG.
You are better than he then.
LIB.
Why, is there ever anything better for a man than Salvation ?
ARG.
Though I praise Fortune, still, not to speak in dis­ praise of the Divinity SalvationPHIL.
By the powers, but they are good, both of them.
ARG.
I shall know it, when they have conferred anything that's good.
LEON.
Wish for that which you desire to befall you.
ARG.
What if I do wish it ?
LEON.
It shall come to pass.
ARG.
I wish for her to be devoted to me alone this whole year round.
LEON.
You have obtained it.
ARG.
Do you really say so ?
LEON.
I do say so for certain.
LIB.
Come to me, in my turn, and make trial:
wish ardently for that which you especially desire to happen to you;
it shall be done.
ARG.
What other thing could I ardently wish for rather than that of which I am in want ?
Oblige me with twenty silver minæ to give to her mother.
LIB.
They shall be given:
take care and be of good courage, your wishes shall be fulfilled.
ARG.
Just as they are wont, Salvation and Fortune are deceiving mortals..
LEON.
I this day have been the head in finding this money for you.
LIB.
I have been the foot.
ARG.
Why, neither head nor foot of your talking is visible;
I can understand neither what you mean, nor why you are trifling with me.
LIB.
I think that now you've been teased enough;
now let's disclose the matter as it really stands.
Give your atten­ tion, Argyrippus, if you please.
Your father has ordered us to bring this money to you.
ARG.
How very à propos and opportunely you have brought it.
LIB.
(giving him the bag).
Here, in this, there will be twenty good minæ, obtained by bad means:
these, on certain condi­ tions, he bade us give you.
ARG.
Prithee, what are they ?
LIB.
That you would grant him her favours and an entertainment.
ARG.
Bid him come, I beg.
For him who deserves it right well, we'll do what he wishes, him who has brought these scattered loves of ours to a happy result.
LEON.
You'll permit your father then, Argyrippus, to caress her ?ARG.
She, by being restored to me, will easily cause me to permit it.
Prithee, Leonida, run, and beg my father to come here.
LIB.
He has been in the house some time.
ARG.
He hasn't come this way, at all events.
LIB. (pointing to the back way).
He came round that way1 by the lane, through the garden, lest any one of his friends should see him coming here;
he's afraid that his wife may come to know of it.
If your mother knew about the money, how it was obtained——ARG.
Well, well-do use words of good omen2;
go in-doors quickly, farewell.
LEON.
And you two, love on.
(He and LIBANUS go into the house of DEMÆNETUS ;
ARGYRIPPUS and PHILENIUM into that of CLEÆRETA.)DIAB.
Come now, show me this agreement that you've written out between myself and the procuress.
Read over the conditions;
for you are a quite unique composerl in such matters.
PAR.
I'll make the procuress be terrified when she hears the conditions.
DIAB.
Troth now, prithee, proceed and read them over to me.
PAB.
Are you attending ?
DIAB.
I'm all attention.
PAR. (reads the agreement).
“Diabolus, the son of Glaucus, has made a present to Cleæreta, the procuress, of twenty silver minæ, that Philenium may be with him night and day for this whole year."
DIAB.
Yes, and not with any other person.
PAR.
Am I to add that ?
DIAB.
Add it, and take care and write it plainly and distinctly.
PAR. (writes it down, and then reads). "
And not admit any other man whatever, because either her friend or her patron, she may choose to call him"DIAB.
Not any one!
PAR. "
Or because she may say that he is the lover of a female friend of hers.
The door must be closed to all men except to yourself.
On the door she must write that she is engaged.
Or, because she may affirm that the letter has been brought from abroad, there is not to be even any letter in the house, nor so much as a waxed tablet;
and if there is any useless picture2, let her sell it;
if she does not part with it, within four days from the time when she has received the money of you, let it be considered as your own ;
you to burn it if you like;
so that she may have no wax, with which she may be able to make a letter.
She is to invite no guest;
you are to invite them.
On no one of them is she to cast her eyes:
if she looks upon any other person, she must be blind forth­ withl.
Then she is to drink cup by cup equally with yourself.
She is to receive it from you;
she is to hand it to you for you to drink.
She is not to have a relish for less or for more than yourself.
"DIAB.
That's quite to my taste.
PAR. (readino). " She is to remove all causes of suspicion from her, nor is she to tread on any man's foot2 with her foot;
when she rises she is neither to step upon the next couch, nor when she gets down from the couch is she thence to extend her hand to any one;
she is not to give to nor ask of any one a ring for her to look at;
she is not to present dice to any man whatever except to yourself;
when she throws3 them, she is not to say, 'You I call upon,’ she is to mention your name.
She may call on any Goddess that she pleases as propitious to her, but on no God:
if she should chance to be very full of devotion, she is to tell you, and you are to pray to him that he may be propitious.
She is neither to nod at any man, wink, or make a sign.
In fine, if the lamp goes out, she is not to move a single joint of herself in the dark."
DIAB.
That's very good;
so, in fact, she must do:
but ex­ punge that about the chamber;
for my part, I prefer that she should move.
I don't wish her to have an excuse, and to say that it is forbidden her by her vow.
PAR.
I understand, you fear some quibble.
DIAB.
Just so.
PAR.
Then as you bid me, I'll strike it out.
(-Erases it.)DIAB.
And why not ?
PAIL.
Hear the rest.
DIAB.
Say on, I'm listening.
PAll. (goes on reading).
"And she is not to use any shuffling words, nor is she to know how to speak in any tongue but the Attic.
If perchance she should begin to cough, she is not to cough so as to expose her tongue to any one in cough­ ing.
But if she should pretend as though she had a running at the nose1, even then she is not to do so;
you yourself must wipe her lips, rather than that she should open her mouth before another person.
And her mother, the procuress, is not to come in in the middle of the wine, nor is she to utter a word of abuse to any one;
if she does so speak, let this be her fine, to go for twenty days without wine."
DIAB.
You have written it nicely;
a clever agreement.
PAR. "
Then, if she bids her maid-servant carry chaplets, garlands, or unguents, to Venus or to Cupid, your servant is to watch whether she gives them to Venus or to a man.
If perchance she should say she wishes to keep herself in purity2, let her account for as many nights as she has kept herself in purity.
These are no trifles;
for they are no funeral dirge3.”DIAB.
The conditions please me entirely;
follow- me in- doors.
PAR.
I follow.
(They go into the house of CLEÆRETA.
DIAB.
Follow this way.
Am I to put up with this, or shall I hold my tongue ?
I would rather die than not dis­ cover this to his wife.
And say you so, old man ?
With a mistress would you be acting the part of a youngster ?
Would you be excusing yourself to your wife, and calling yourself an aged man?
Would you be taking the mistress from her lover ?
And would you be presenting the money to the procuress, and be secretly pilfering it from your wife at home ?
You should hang me, rather than you should carry off these matters undiscovered.
On my honor, I'll really go this instant hence to her whom I'm sure that you'll very soon be destroying, in order that you may be able to supply your extravagance, unless, indeed, she shall first prevent you.
PAIL.
I'm of opinion that thus you must act.
'Tis more becoming that I should disclose this matter, rather than yourself, lest she may think that you, excited by reason of love, rather than for her own sake, have acted thus.
DIAB.
Why, faith, you say what's right.
Do you then contrive to raise a storm and strife against him, that he, to­ gether with his own son, is carousing with one mistress the livelong day, and that he's secretly pilfering from her.
PAR.
Don't suggest to me.
I'll take care of that.
DIAB.
But I'll wait for you at home.
(Exit DIABOLUS ;
the PARASITE goes into the house Of DEMÆNETUS.)ARG.
Come then, father, let's take our places, please.
DEM.
As you bid me, my son, so it shall be.
ARG.
(to the ATTENDANTS).
Lads, spread the table.
DEM.
Is it at all displeasing to you, son, if she takes her place by me ?
(They take their places.)ARG.
Duty, father, keeps sorrow from my eyes;
although I love her, still I can control my feelings, not to take it to heart because she takes her place by you.
DEM.
It becomes a young man to be respectful, Argyrippus.
ARG.
Troth, father, through proper regard for you, I can be so.
DEM.
Come, then, let's enjoy this banquet with wine and pleasant discourse.
I don't wish to be feared, I prefer my­ self to be loved by you, my son.
ARG.
In truth, I do them both, as is proper for a son.
DEM.
I'd believe it, if I saw you were cheerful.
ARG.
Why, do you think that I'm sorrowful ?
DEAF.
Do I think so ?
You, whom I see as melancholy as if the day1 of trial had been named for you.
ARG.
Don't you say that.
DEM.
Don't you be so, then I'll not say so.
ARG.
Well then, look at me;
I'm laughing.
(He affects to laugh.)DEM.
I'd like that those who wish me ill would laugh thus.
ARG.
I know, indeed, father, why you now suppose to yourself that I'm sad;
it is because she is by you.
And really, father, by my faith, to tell you the truth, that matter does hurt me;
and not for this reason, that I don't desire for you that which you wish, but because I love her;
another woman, indeed, I could easily endure to be by you.
DEM.
But I have a fancy for this one.
ARG.
Then you have what you desire ;
for myself, I wish for what I could desire.
DEM.
Submit to it this one day, since I've given you the power to be with her for a year, and have procured for you the command of money in your amour.
ARG.
Well, by doing that, you have laid me under an obligation to you.
DEM.
Why then don't you show yourself cheerful to me ?
(They commence the banquet, PHILENIUM reclining below DE­ MÆNETUS.)ART.
Prithee, do you say that my husband is carousing here, together with my son ?-and that he has carried to his mistress twenty minæ of silver ?—and that, with the know­ ledge of my son, his father is perpetrating this wickedness ?
PAR.
Trust me in nothing henceforth, either divine or human, Artemona, if you find me untruthful in this matter.
ART.
Wretched then am I, who have supposed that, be­ yond others, my husband was sober, decent, chaste, and espe­ cially fond of his wife.
PAR.
But now, henceforth, understand that he, before all men, is a person of the smallest worth-a drunkard, a good- for-nothing fellow, unchaste, and a contemner of his own wife.
ART.
I' faith, if this wasn't true, he would never be doing the things that he is now doing.
PAR.
Upon my word, I too always hitherto took him to be a decent person;
but by this action he declares himself,-to be carousing, indeed, together with his son, and, a decrepit old man, toying with a mistress in his company.
ART.
For this it is, i' faith, that he's going out to dinner everyday.
He says that he's going to Archidemus, Chereas, Chærestratus, Clinius, Chremes, Cratinus, Dinias, Demos­ thenes:
while he's thinking of debauchery, and public dens of infamy with his harlot.
PAR.
Why don't you bid your maid-servants carry him off home upon their shoulders ?
ART.
Do you only be quiet.
By my troth, I'll surely give him some trouble.
PAR.
I'm sure of it, that so it will befall him, so long, indeed, as you shall continue married to him.
ART.
I was fancying that this fellow was still giving at­ tendance either in the senate or to his dependants :
that for that reason it was, that, worn out with fatigue, he snored the whole night through.
Wearied with his labours out of doors he comes home at night.
Another's farm he ploughs, his own he leaves untilled.
Both he himself is corrupted, and he cor­ rupts his son as well.
FAR.
Do you only follow me this way, I'll make you just now to fall upon the man himself in the very fact.
ART.
By heaven, there's nothing that I could more wish for.
PAR.
Just stop there.
(He moves stealthily forward, and examines the other side of the stage.)ART.
What's the matter?
PAR. (returning to her).
If perchance you were to see your husband reclining, if you be­ held him with a garland on, caressing a mistress, could you recognize him ?
ART.
I' troth, I could.
PAR. (points to the other end of the stage).
Then there's your man.
ART.
(moving stealthily forward with the PARASITE).
I'm undone.
PAR.
Stay a little.
Let's observe in private, from ambush, what business they are about.
ARG.
What end will you put to your caresses, father ?
DEM.
I confess, my sonARG.
What do you confers ?
DEM.
That I'm utterly undone with love for her.
PAR. (to ARTEMONA):
Do you hear what he says ?
ART.
I hear.DEM. (to PHILENIUM).
Ought I not to filch the mantle from my wife at home, which she is so fond of, and bring it to you ?
Though my wife's life should last a whole year in con­ sequence, by my troth I could not be dissuaded from doing so.
PAR. (to ARTEMONA).
Do you suppose that he has been accustomed to frequent a brothel to-day for the first time ?
ART.
Upon my faith, it was he that was pilfering me;
whereas I was suspecting my maid-servants, and was torment­ ing the wretched creatures who were innocent all the while.
ARG.
Father, bid him pour out some wine;
'tis a long time since I drank first1.
DEM. (to the SERVANT).
Begin, boy, from the top2. (To PHILENIUM).
Come, do you meanwhile from below give me a kiss.
(Kisses her.)ART. (to the PARASITE).
Wretch that I am, I'm undone!
How the villain, the garnishing of a bier3, is kissing away.
DEM.
A breath, by my faith, somewhat sweeter than that of my wife.
PHIL.
Tell me, there's a dear, does the breath of your wife smell bad ?
DEM.
I'd prefer to drink bilge-water, if it were necessary, rather than kiss her.
ART. (apart).
By heavens, you are a wretch.
PAR. (apart).
I' faith, he's deserving so to be.
ARG.
How say you, father ?
(Takes a draught in the mean­ while.)ART. (apart).
Aye, pray, how say you?
By my troth, to your own great detriment, you've surely said that against me.
Never mind;
only do you come home, I'll let you know what danger there is in speaking abusively against a wife with a dowry.
ARG.
Don't you love my mother ?
DEM.
Who—I?
I love her just now, because she isn't present.
ARG.
How, when she is present ?
DEM.
Then, I wish she was dead.
PAR. (apart to ARTE­ MONA).
This fellow is fond of you, according to what he says.
ART.
On my word, he's surely laying out all this at interest;
for if, this day, he returns home, I'll especially have my revenge in kissing him.
ARG. (handing the dice-box).
Father, throw the dice ;
that afterwards I may have a throw.
DEM.
By all means.
You, Philenium, for myself, and death for my wife.
(He throws.)
'Tis Venus's castl.
Lads, clap your hands, and give me some honeyed wine in my cup, in honor of my throw.
ART. (apart).
I can hold out no longer.
PAR. (apart).
If you haven't learned the fulling trader it's not to be wondered at;
now it's quite fitting for you to beset his eyes.
(They make their appearance before the revellers.)ART.
By heavens, I will live, and you this day have made that invocation to your own great misfortune.
PAR.
Will some one run to fetch the undertakerS ?
ARG.
Health to you, mother.
ART.
Health indeed after this fashion!
PAR. (aside).
Demænetus is dead.
'Tis time to betake myself hence:
this battle bravely waxes hot.
I'll be off to Diabolus.
I'll tell him his orders are performed as he de­ sired them;
and in the meantime I'll persuade him that we should take a meal, while these people are squabbling.
Afterwards, in fine, I'll bring him here to-morrow, to the procuress, that he may give her the twenty minæ, that, in his turn, he in his passion may be enabled to obtain this damsel.
I hope that Argyrippus will be able to be prevailed upon to allow him to pass each alternate night with him in her com­ pany;
for, unless I obtain that, I've lost my patron1;
so great is the passion of the man by reason of his love.
(He quietly withdraws.)ART. (addressing PHILENIUM).
What business have you to give a retreat here in your house to my husband ?
PHIL.
Troth, he really will this day be the death of wretched me, through sheer disgust.
ART. (to DEMÆNETUS).
Rise, wencher, be off home.
DEM.
I'm undone.
ART.
Yes, you are2;
don't, i' faith, gainsay it, you most vile of all men.
Why, the cuckoo's still on his nests.
Rise, wencher, be off home.
DEM.
Woe to me!
ART.
You prophesy correctly.
Rise, wencher, be off home.
DEM.
Step a little this way then.
ART.
Rise, wencher, be off home.
DEM.
Now, prithee, wife —ART.
Do you remember now that I'm your wife ?
It was but just now, when you were heaping abuse upon me, that I wasn't your wife.
DEM.
I'm utterly ruined.
ART.
Why, pray ?
Does the breath of your wife smell strong ?
DEM.
It smells of myrrh.
ART.
Have you filched my mantle then to be giving to your harlot ?
ARG.
By the powers-what, did he promise that he would filch your mantle ?
ART.
Won't you hold your tongue ?
ARG.
I was going to dissuade him, mother.
ART. (to ARGYRlPPUS).
A pretty son!
(To DEMÆNETUS.)
IS it proper for a father to teach these morals to his children ?
Are you ashamed of nothing ?
DEM.
I' faith, if there's nothing else, I'm ashamed of you, wife.
ART.
With your hoary head, your wife is dragging you, you cuckoo, from dens of infamy.
DEM.
The dinner's cooking ;
mayn't I stop, only to take my dinner ?
ART.
Faith, you'll dine to-day on a heavy mishap, as you deserve.
DEM. (rising).
I shall repose but uncomfortably ;
my wife is taking me home condemned.
ARG.
I told you, father, not to devise ill against my mother.
PHIL. (to DEMÆNETUS).
Do remember about the mantle1, there's a dear.
DEM. (calls out to CLEÆRETA).
Won't you order her to go away from here ?
PHIL.
No, I'll go in, in preference.
(To ARGYRIPPUS.)
Follow me this way, my life.
ARG.
Tes, I follow.
ART. (to DEMÆNETUS).
Be off home.
PHIL. (to DEMÆNETUS).
Do give me a kiss, at least, be­ fore you go.DEM. (to PHILENlUM).
Go hang yourself.
(Exeunt.
If this old fellow, unknown to his wife, has been in any way indulging his own inclinations, he has been doing nothing new or wonderful, or otherwise than others are in the habit of doing.
No one is there of a disposition so severe, or of a temper so firm, but that he will enjoy himself when he has any opportunity.
Now if you wish to interpose in behalf of this old man, so that he be not punished, we think that it can be brought about if you give us loud applause.
THERAPONTIGONUS, a Captain of Caria.
PHÆDROMUS, a young man in love with Planesium.
LYCO, a Banker.
THE CHOREGUS (or, Director of the Chorus).
AN ACTOR.
PLANESIUM, a young woman belonging to Cappadox.
AN OLD WOMAN, a Procuress.
Soela—Epidaurus, in Peloponnesus;
before the houses of PHÆDROMUS CAPPADOX, and the Temple of Æsculapius.
PHÆDROMUS is desperately in love with Planesium, wiio is in the possession of Cappadox, an avaricious Procurer.
Not having the means of obtaining her freedom, Phædromus sends Curculio, his Parasite, to Caria, to borrow the money from a friend.
The friend being unable to lend it, Curculio by accident meets a military officer, named Therapontigonus, and is invited by him to dinner.
The Captain accidentally mentionsto him that he has agreed to purchase Plane­ sium of the Procurer, and that the money is deposited with Lyco, the banker, who has been ordered, on receiving a letter signed with the Captain's signet, to have the young woman delivered to the bearer.
While the Captain is overpowered with wine, Curculio steals his signet, and hastens back to Epidaurus, where he forges a letter by means of it, which he delivers to Lyco, as though from the Captain.
The money is paid to the Procurer, and Planesium is banded over to Curculio;
a condition having been previously made, that if she should turn out to be a free woman by birth, the money shall be repaid to the purchaser.
Curculio then delivers Planesium to Phædromus.
The same day, the Captain arrives at Epidaurus, and is soon after recognized by Planesium as her brother, through the medium of the ring, which had belonged to her father.
To corroborate her assertion, Planesium produces another ring, which Therapontigonus had pre. sented to her when a child as a birthday present.
On this, she is given by ber orotner in marriage to Phædromus;
and Cappadcx, much against his willis forced to refund the money to the Captain.
ON an errand of Phædromus, Curculio (Curculio)-goes to Caria, that (Ut) le may obtain some money;
there he despoils the rival (Rivalem) of Phœdro­ mus of his ring.
He writes a letter, and seals it with that seal.
Lyco, when he sees it, recognizes (Cognoscit) the seal of the Captain;
that (Ut) he may send him his mistress, he pays the money to the Procurer.
The Captain threatens to summon Lyco (Lyconem) and the Procurer to justice:
lie himself (Ipsus) discovers his sister that was lost, at whose request (Oratu) he gives her in marriage to Phædromus.
Enter at one side of the stage PHÆDROMUS, with a lighted torch, and followed by SLAVES with wine and provisions for an entertainment, and PALINURUS on the opposite side.
PAL.
Whither away must I say that you are going out of doors at this time o' night, Phædromus, with that dress and with this train1 ?
PHÆD.
Whither Venus and Cupid summon me, and Love persuades mei whether 'tis the midnight or whether the earliest twilight, if the day is fixed2 for pleading your cause with your antagonist, still must you go where they corn.
mand you, whether you will or no.
PAL.
But pray, prayPHÆD.
Pray ——— you are an­ noying to me.
PAL.
Really that is neither pretty nor befitting you to say.
You are your own servantl;
in your fine garb you are showing the light with your waxen torch2.
PHÆD.
And ought I not to carry that which is gathered by the labour of the little bees-which has its birth in sweets -to my own sweet one, my little honey ?
PAL.
But whither must I say that you are going ?
PHÆD.
If you ask me that, I'll tell, so that you may know.
PAL.
If I make the enquiry, what would you answer me ?
PHÆD.
This is the Temple (pointing to it) of Æsculapius.
PAL.
That I have known for more than a twelvemonth past.
PHÆD.
Close to it is that door, dear as my very eyes.
(Points to the door of CAPPADOX.)
Hail to you!
door, dear as my very eyes;
have you been quite well of late ?
PAL.
Did a fever leave you3 but yesterday, or the day before, and did you take your dinner yesterday ?
PHÆD.
Are you laughing at me ?
PAL.
Why then, mad­ man, are you enquiring whether the door is well or not ?
PHÆD.
I' faith, I've known it as a door most comely and most discreet:
never one word does it whisper;
when it is opened, it is silent;
and when, by night, she secretly comes out to me, it holds its peace.
PAL.
And are you not, Phædromus, doing, or contemplating the doing of, some deed which is unworthy of yourself or of your family ?
Are you not laying a snare for some modest fair one, or for one that should be modest ?
PHÆD.
For no one;
and may Jupiter not permit me to do so.
PAL.
I wish the same.
Ever, if you are wise, so bestow your love, that if the public should know the object which you love, it may be no disgrace to you.
Ever do you take care that you be not disgraced4.
PHÆD.
What means that expression ?
PAL.
For you to proceed with caution on your path;
the object that you love, love in the presence of witnesses.
PHÆD.
Why, 'tis a Procurer that lives here.
(He points.)PAL.
No one drives you away from there, nor yet forbids you, if you have the money, to buy what's openly on sale.
No one forbids any person from going along the public road, so long as he doesn't make a path through the field that'a fenced around;
so long as you keep yourself away from the wife, the widow, the maiden, youthful age, and free-born children, love what you please.
PHÆD.
This is the house of a Procurer.
PAL.
A curse befall it.
PHÆD.
Why so ?
PAL.
Because it serves in an infamous service.
PHÆD.
You speak out.
PAL.
Be it so, most especially.
PHÆD.
Once more, will you hold your tongue ?
PAL.
You bade me speak out1, I thought.
PHÆD.
Then, now I forbid you.
But, as I had begun ta say, he has a young female slave —PAL.
This Procurer, you mean, who's living here ?
PHÆD.
You have hold of it exactly.
PAL.
The less shall I be in dread of its falling.
PHÆD.
You are impertinent.
He wishes to make her a courtesan, while she is desperately in love with me;
whereas I don't wish to have her upon loan.
PAL.
Why so ?
PHÆD.
Because I'm for having her as my own;
I love her equally as well.
PAL.
Clandestine courtship is bad;
'tis utter ruin.
PHÆD.
I' troth, 'tis so as you say.
PAL.
Has site as yet submitted to the yoke of Venus ?
PHÆD.
For me she is as chaste as though she were my own sister, unless, indeed, she is any the more unchaste for some kissing.
PAL.
Always, do you understand, flame follows very close on smoke;
with smoke, nothing can be burnt, with flame, it can.
He who wishes to eat the kernel1 of the nut, first breaks the nut;
he who wishes to seduce, opens the dance2 with kisses.
PHÆD.
But she is chaste, and never yet has bestowed her favours upon man.
PAL.
That I could believe3, if any Procurer had any shame.
PHÆD.
Well, but what think you of her ?
When she has any opportunity, she steals away to me;
when she has given me a kiss, she's off again.
This happens by reason of this, because this Procurer is lying a-bed ill in the Temple4 of Æsculapius;
that 'How is my torturer.
PAL.
How so ?
PHÆD.
At one time he asks me for thirty minæ for her, at another for a great talent;
and from him I cannot obtain any fair and just dealing.
PAL.
You are too exacting, in requiring that of him which no Procurer possesses.
PHÆD.
Now, I've sent my Parasite hence to Caria6, to ask for money on loan from my friend;
if he doesn't bring me this, which way to turn myself I know not.
PAL.
If you salute the Deities, towards the right6 I think;
now this is this altar of Venus before their door.
PHÆD.
I have already vowed to bring me1 an early, break­ fast for my Venus2.
PAL.
What?
Will you then be giving up yourself as a breakfast to Venus ?
PHÆD.
Myself, and you, and all of these.
(Pointing to the SLAVES.)PAL.
Then you would have Venus to be sick outright.
PHÆD.
(to an ATTENDANT).
Here, boy, give me the bowl.
PAL.
What are you going to do ?
PHÆD.
You'll know directly.
An old bag is in the habit of sleeping here, as the keeper of the door;
the name of the Procuress is "Much-bibber" and "Neat-bibber."PAL.
Just as you would speak of a flagon, in which Chiar wines is wont to be.
PHÆD.
What need is there of words ?
She is a most vinous soul;
and the very moment that I've sprinkled this door with the wine, she knows by the smell that I'm here, and opens it forthwith.
PAL.
Is it for her the bowl is brought with the wine ?
PHÆD.
Unless you object.
PAL.
I' faith, I do object;
for I'd rather have it broken about him who has brought it.
I fancied it was brought for ourselves.
PHÆD.
Why don't you hold your tongue ?
If any's left after her, it will be enough for ourselves.
PAL.
What river is it, pray, that the sea does not receive ?
PHÆD.
Follow me this way, Palinurus, to the door;
do you be obedient to me.
PAL.
I'll do so.
(They advance to the door of the PROCURER'S house.)PHÆD. (sprinkling the door with wine).
Come, drink, you joyous door, quaff on, readily prove propitious unto me.
PAL. (in an affected tone).
Door, would you like some olives or a tit-bit, or some capers ?
PHÆD.
Arouse and send out here to me your portress.
PAL.
You're spilling the wine;
what matter is it that pos­ sesses you ?
(Takes hold of his arm.)PHÆD.
Let me alone.
Don't you see ?
This most joyous door is opening ;
does the hinge make a bit of creaking ?
'Tis a charming one.
PAL.
Why don't you then give it a kiss ?
PHÆD.
Hold your tongue;
let's keep back the light and our noise..
PAL.
Be it so.
(They stand apart, leaving the bowl near the door.)PROC.
The savour of aged wine has reached my nostrils ;
the love of it has brought me in my eagerness hither in the dark ;
wherever it is, it's near me.
0 capital, I've found it.
(Stooping, and smelling at the bowl.)
Hail to you, my soul, joy of dear Bacchus ;
how enamoured am I of your old age.
For in comparison with yours, the odour of all unguents were mere bilge-water ;
you are my myrrh, you my cinnamon, you my rose, you my saffron unguent and my cassia, you are my vine-palm1 scent.
But, where you have been poured, there would I most earnestly hope to be buried.
PAL. (apart).
This old lady's thirsty;
how limited is her thirst?
PHÆD. (apart).
She's a moderate person;
she swal­ lows eight gallons2 only.
PAL. (apart).
I' faith, according to your account, this year's vintage is not enough for this old woman alone.
PROC.
But since as yet you, fragrance, alone have penetrated to my nostrils, so in its turn aff6rd some delight to my throat.
(Feels for the bowl on the ground, which PALlNURUS draws away.)
I find you not;
where is your own dear self?
I'm onging to touch you ;
do let me pour your liquids into me by sip-sipping.
But -in this direction it has gone, this way I'll follow it.
(Goes in the direction of PALINURUS, who has the bowl.)PAL. (apart).
It really had been more proper for her to be a dog;
she has a good nose.
PROC.
Prithee, whose voice is it that I hear at a distance.
PHÆD. (apart).
I think that this old hag should be ac costed.
I'll approach her.
(Aloud.)
Come back, Procuress, and look back towards me.
PROC.
Who is it that gives his commands ?
PHÆD.
The all-powerful in wine, jolly Bacchus ;
he who, when you're hawking, parched, and half asleep, brings you a draught and comes to quench your thirst.
PROC.
How far is he away from me ?
PHÆD.
(holding up the torch).
See this light.
PROC.
Then, prithee, do quicken your pace towards me.
PHÆD.
Health to you.
PROC.
How can I have health, who am parched with thirst ?
PRiED.
But you shall drink in a moment.
PROC.
'Tis long a-coming.
PHÆD. (extending the bowl).
Here's for you, jolly old dame.
PROC.
Health to you, gentleman dear as my very eyes.
PAL.
Come, toss this off quickly into your abyss;
scour out your sink right speedily.
PHÆD.
H.old your tongue;
I won't have her ill spoken to.
PAL. (aside).
In preference, then, I'll do her ill.
PROC. (pouring someof the residue on the altar).
Venus, of this little, this very little will I give to thee1—sore against my will;
for all the lovers, in their cups, to propitiate thee, expend their wine upon thee:
not such windfalls often fall to me.
(-Drinks aqain.)PAL.
Do look at that, please, how greedily the filthy hag swills down the pure wine into herself with distended gullet.
PROC. (patting her stomach and chuckling).
Ha, ha, ha.
PAL.
How is it ?
Do you like it ?
PROC.
I do like it.
PAL.
And I, too, should like to goad with a spur as well.
PHÆD. (aside to PALINURUS).
Don't you—do hold your tongue.
PAL.
I'll hold my tongue ;
(the old woman drinks) but see, the rainbow's drinking1;
I' faith, I do believe it will rain to-day.
PHÆD.
Troth now, I'm quite undone;
what first to say to her I know not.
PAL.
Why, the same thing that you said to me.
PHÆD.
What's that ?
PAL.
Say that you're quite undone.
PHÆD.
May the Gods confound you.
PAL.
Say so to her.
PHÆD.
Am I to say then to her—?
PAL.
Say what ?
PHÆD.
That I'm quite undone.
PAL.
Well then, say so.
PHÆD.
Old lady, do listen.
I wish you to know this;
to my sorrow, I'm quite undone.
PROC.
But, i’ faith, for my part, I'm altogether brought to life.
But why is it that you are pleased to say you are quite undone ?
PHÆD.
Because I'm deprived of the object which I love.
(Pretends to weep.)PROC.
My dear Phædromus, prithee, do not weep ;
do you take care that I'm not thirsty, I'll at once bring out here for you the object which you love.
( Goes into the house.)
PHÆD.
Assuredly, if you keep faith with me, in place of a golden statue, I'll erect for you one of wine2, which shall be a memorial of your gullet Palinurus, who on earth will be so blest as myself, if she comes to.
me ?
PAL.
By my faith, he who is in love, if he is in want as well, is afflicted with a dreadful malady.
PHÆD.
Such is not the case with me ;
for I feel sure that this very day my Parasite will come hither to me with the money.
PAL.
You attempt something mighty, if you ex­ pect that which nowhere exists.
PHÆD.
What if I approach the door, and trill a carol3 ?
PAL.
If you choose ;
I neither bid nor request you, since, my master, I see that you are of manners and disposition thus changed.
PHÆD. (sings).
Bolts, 0 ye bolts, with pleasure do I salute you.
I love you, I court you, I seek you, and you entreat;
most kindly lend your aid to me in love;
become, for my sake, as though play-actorsl from foreign climes;
leap upwards, pray, and send out of doors this fair one, who drains my blood for me distractedly in love.
(Addressing PALINURUS.)
Look at that, how those most accursed bolts sleep on, and none the quicker for my sake do they bestir themselves (Addressing the door.)
I see quite clearly that you don value my esteem at all.
Hist!
hush, hush!
PAL.
I' troth, for my part I'm silent enough.
PHÆD.
I hear a noise;
at last, i' faith, these bolts have become complaisant to me.
PROC. (to PLANE SlUM, while opening the door).
Come softly out, and prevent the noise of the doors and the creaking of the hinges, m) dear Planesium, that our master mayn't per­ ceive that that is going on which we are doing here.
Stay, I'll pour a little water2 on it.
(Pours water on the hinges.)PAL. (to PHÆDROMUS).
Do you see how the palsied hag is giving her dose ?
She herself has learnt right well to drink up the wine ;
to the door she's giving water for it to drink.
PLAN. (looking around).
Where are you—you who have summoned me on the recognizances of Venus3?
To you do I present myself, and, in the same way do I call on you, on the other hand, to present yourself to me.
PHÆD. (stepping forward).
Here I am;
for could I be absent, I wouldn't repine for any misfortune to befall me, my honey.
PLAN.
My life, it is not becoming for one thus in love to be at a distance.
PHÆD.
Palinurus, Palinurus!
PAL.
Say on;
why is it that you call upon 'Palinurus ?PHÆD. (aside).
She is a charming one.
PAL. (aside).
Age, too charming.
PHÆD.
I am a God.
PAL.
Why, no—a mortal, of no great value.
PHÆD.
What have you seen, or what will you see, more nearly to be compared with the Gods ?
PAL.
You are not in your senses, master ;
a thing that's grievous to me.
PHÆD.
You are not sufficiently respect­ ful to me :
hold your tongue.
PAL.
The person that sees1 the object which he loves, and enjoys not the opportunity while he may, is one who torments his own self.
PHÆD.
Rightly does he rebuke me ;
really there's nothing which for this long time past I have more eagerly desired.
PLAN.
Clasp me, embrace me then.
PHÆD. (embracing her).
This, too, is a reason for which I could wish to live ;
be­ cause your master restrains you, in secret do I court you.
PLAN.
Restrain me?
He neither can restrain me, nor will he restrain me, unless death should separate my soul from you.
PHÆD.
Let monarchs keep their kingdoms to themselves, the rich their riches to themselves, to themselves their honors, to themselves their prowess, to themselves their combats, to themselves their battles;
so long as they abstain from envying me, let each one of them keep what is his own.
PAL. (aside).
Of a truth, I cannot refrain from giving a lecture to my master;
for, really, it is good to love in a mode­ rate degree ;
to distraction, it is not good ;
but to love to en­ tire distraction, is the thing that my master's doing.
(Aloud.)
What say you, sir ?
Have you made a vow, Phædromus, you'd watch the night through for Venus ?
For really, upon my faith, before very long hence the dawn will be breaking.
PHÆD.
Do hold your tongue.
PAL.
Why hold my tongue ?
What, are you going to sleep?
PHÆD.
I am asleep ;
don't you make a noise.
PAL.
Why, but you're broad awake.
PHÆD.
Aye, but after my own fashion I'm asleep ;
this is my slumber.
PAL. (to PLANESIUM).
A word with you, madam;
'tis thoughtlessness to treat amiss one who deserves it not.
PLAN.
You would be angry, if, when you are eating, he were to drive you away1 from your food.
PAL. (aside).
It's all over with him.
I see that these two are equally in love to distraction;
and both of them are mad.
D'ye see how intensely they hug each other ?
They cannot embrace enough.
(Addressing them.)
Are you going to part yet ?
PLAN.
No human being has blessings that last2 for ever.
To this pleasure, then, is that plague added.
PAL.
What say you, you shocking hussy3 ?
What, you little tipsy ninny4, are even you with your owlish eyes5 to be calling me a plague, you whipper-snapper ?
PHÆD.
What, you abusing my own Venus ?
And really, is a slave well trounced with the rod to be commencing a discussion with myself ?
But, by the powers, you've surely said that to your own misfortune.
(Strikes him.)
There, take that, by way of punishment for this abusive language, that you may be able to put a check upon your speech.
PAL. (to PLANESIUM).
Your aid, I pray, you night-watching Venus.
PHÆD.
What, do you still persist, whip-scoundrel ?
(Strikes him.)PLAN.
Don't, there's a dear, be beating a stone, lest you should hurt your hand.
PAL.
You perpetrate, Phædromus, a flagitious and a shame­ ful deed of great enormity;
one who directs you aright, you pummel with your fists;
her you are in love with, a mere nonentity.
Is it right that you should behave yourself in this unreasonable manner ?
PHÆD.
Find me a reasonable lover against his weight in gold;
here, take the gold of me.
(Holds out his purse.)PAL.
Do you find me a person for me to serve in his sound senses against his weight in double-distilled gold.
PLAN.
Kindly fare you well, apple of my eye, for I hear the sound and creaking of doors ;
I think the keeperl is opening the temple.
But, prithee, in this same manner shall we always enjoy our love by stealth ?
PHÆD.
Far from it;
for I sent my Parasite four days since to Caria to fetch some money;
he'll be here to-day.
PLAN.
You are very long in your contriving.
PHÆD.
So may Venus love me, I'll never allow you to be three days in this house here, before I procure your liberty.
PLAN.
Take care to remember it.
Once more, before I go hence, take this kiss.
(Kisses him.)PHÆD.
By heavens, really if a kingdom now were offered me, I should not obtain it with greater pleasure.
When shall I see you again ?
PLAN.
Why now, for that expression get ready the Prætor's rod2 ;
if you love me, purchase my freedom ;
don't make any haggling.
Take care to prevail with your offer.
Kindly adieu!
(Goes into the house of the PROCURER.)PHÆD.
And am I then left behind?
Palinurus, I'm killed outright.
PAL.
And I as well, who am dying with thumps and sleepi­ ness.
PHÆD.
Do you follow me.
(They go into the house of PHÆDROMUS.)CAP. (to himself).
I am resolved to depart from this Temple out of doors forthwith, since thus I find1 the determination of Æsculapius, who sets me at nought, and chooses not that I should be healed.
My health is declining, my weakness in­ creases.
For now I walk, girded with my spleen as though with a belt;
in my stomach do I seem to be holding a twin offspring.
I'm afraid of nothing, but that, in my misery, I should burst asunder in the middle.
PAL. (speaking to PHÆDROMUS within as he enters).
If you do right, Phædromus, you'll listen to me, and banish this sorrow from your feelings.
You are anxious because your Parasite hasn't returned from Caria.
I think he'll bring the money;
but if he doesn't bring it, by a chain of iron he couldn't be withheld from betaking himself to eat at his manger2.
CAP. (turning round).
What person is it that speaks?
PAL. (to himself).
Whose voice is it that I hear ?
CAP.
Isn't this Palinurus, the servant of Phædromus ?PAL. (aside).
Who is this fellow with extended paunch, and eyes as green as grass ?
From his figure I know him;
from his complexion I cannot recognize him.
0, now I do know him:
it's the Procurer Cappadox.
I'll accost him.
CAP.
Save you, Palinurus.
PAL.
0 source of villanies, save you;
how are you ?
CAP.
I'm just alive.
PAL.
Just as you deserve, I sup­ pose ?
But what's the matter with you ?
CAP.
My spleen is killing me, my reins are in torment, my lungs are being torn asunder, my liver is being tortured, my heart-strings are giving way, all my intestines are in pain.
PAL.
The liver complaint is afflicting you, then.
CAP.
My spleen is expanded.
PAL.
Take walking exer­ cise1;
that's the best thing for the spleen.
CAP.
'Tis an easy matter to laugh at the afflicted.
PAL.
Well, then, do you hold out2 for some days until your intestines become putrid.
Now, while the humours are pretty sound, if you do that, you yourself might sell for a worse price than those intestines of yours.
CAP.
Prithee, have done with this, and answer me this which I ask ;
can you possibly form a conjecture on it, if I relate to you what I dreamt last night in my sleep ?
PAL.
Psha, this—(pointing to himself)—this is the sole person that is really skilled in divination;
why, the inter­ preters of dreams ask advice of myself;
the answer that I have given them, by that opinion they all stand.
COOK.
Palinurus, why do you delay ?
Why are not the things served out for.
me which are needed for the breakfast to be prepared for the Parasite when he comes.
PAR.
Wait, please, until I interpret his dream.
(-Pointing to CAPPADOX.)COOK.
Why, you your own self, if you've had any dream, always apply to me.
PAL.
I confess it.
COOK.
Be off, then, and serve out the things.
PAL. (to CAPPADOX).
Come now, do you in the meantime relate your dream to him.
I give you a substitute better than I am myself;
for what I do know, all of it I know from him.
(Pointing to the COOK.)CAP.
Let him give his attention then.
PAL.
He'll give it.
CAP.
He does what few do, in being attentive to their masters even.
(To the COOK.)
Do you give me your attention then.
(PALINURUS goes into the house of PHÆDROMUS.)COOK.
Although I don't know you, I'll give it you.
CAP.
Last night I seemed in my sleep to behold Æscu­ lapius, seated at a distance far away from me;
and it seemed that he didn't come near me, or set any value upon me.
COOK.
The other Gods will do the same, you must know;
in fact, among themselves they agree with perfect unanimity.
It isn't to be wondered at, if it fares no better with you.
But it had been better for you to pass the night in Jove's Temple, who has given you his assistance!
in your oaths.
CAP.
If, indeed, those should wish to sleep there who have been guilty of perjury, it were not possible for room to be found them in the Capitol2.
COOK.
Give your attention to this;
ask peace of AEscu­ lapius, lest perchance some great mishap befall you, which has been portended to you in your rest.
CAP.
You do well in advising me;
I'll go and pray to him.
(Goes into the Temple.)COOK.
And ill speed you with it * * # * * * (Goes into the house of PHÆDROMUS.)PAL.
(looking in the distance, as he enters).
0 immortal Gods, whom do I behold ?
Who's that yonder ?
(Pointing.)
Isn't that the Parasite, who was sent to Caria (Goes to the door.)
Hallo, come out, Phædromus, come out, come out, come out this instant, I say.
PHÆD.
Why are you making this noise here?.
PAL. ] see your Parasite running;
see, there he is (point­ ing), down at the end of the streetl.
Let's listen from here what he's about.
PHÆD.
I think it's as well.
(They stand aside.)CUR. (to himself).
Known or unknown, make way for me, while here I execute my commission;
fly all of you, be off, and get out of the way, lest I should hurt any person in my speed with my head, or elbow, or breast, or with my knee.
So suddenly now am I charged with a business of quickness and despatch.
And be there no person ever so opulent to stop me in my way, neither general2, nor any tyrant3, nor market-officer4, nor demarch5 nor comarch6, with their honors so great, but that down he goes, and tumbles head first from the footpath into the carriage-road.
And then those Grecians with their cloaks, who walk about with covered heads, who go loaded beneath their cloaks with books, and with baskets7, they loiter together, and engage in gossipping among them­ selves, the gad-abouts1;
you may always see them enjoy­ ing themselves in the hot liquor-shops2;
when they have scraped up some trifle, with their covered pates they are drinking mulled wine, sad and maudlin they depart:
if I stumble upon them here, from every single one of them I'll squeeze out a belch from their pearled-barley diets.
And then those servants of your dainty townsmen4, who are playing at catch-ball in the road, both throwers and catchers, all of them I'll pitch under foot.
Would they avoid a mishap, why then, let them keep at home.
PHÆD. (apart).
He points out aright, he only requires that he should speak with authority;
for such manners are in vogue in the present day, such at present are the slaves;
really, control cannot be held over them.
CUR. (to himself).
Is there any one, I wonder, who can point out to me Phædromus, my good Genius ?
The matter is of such pressing nature, I really must meet with the man this instant.
PAL. (apart).
He's looking for you.
PHÆD. (apart).
What if we accost him ? (Aloud.) Hallo!
Curculio, I want you.
CUR. (looking round).
Who's calling me?
Who's men­ tioning my name ?
PHÆD.
One who wishes to meet with you.
CUR.
(seeing him).
You don't wish more for me than I wish for you..
PHÆD. 0 my own ready occasion, Curculio, much longed- for, greetings to you.
CUR.
Greetings to you.
PHÆD.
I'm glad that you have arrived safe;
give me your right hand.
How stand my hopes ?
Troth now, prithee, do speak out.
Cup.
To you, troth now, prithee, do speak out, how stand my own.
(Makes curious gestures.)PHÆD.
What's the matter with you ?
CUR.
A dimness is beginning to come, my knees are failing through fasting.
PHÆD.
I' faith, through lassitude, I think.
CUR. (staggering).
Support me, prithee, do support me.
PHÆD.
See how pale he has turned;
will you give him a Beat, for him to be seated at once, and an ewer with some water ?
Will you make haste, this very instant ?
CUR.
I'm faint.
PHÆD.
Would you like some water?
CUR.
If it's full of bits1 of meat, prithee, give it me to swallow down, i' faith.
PHÆD.
Woe be to that head of yours.
CUR.
Troth now, prithee do give me cause to rejoice at my arrival2.
PHÆD. (begins to fan him).
By all means.
Cup.
Prithee, what's this you're about.
PHÆD.
Some air.
CUR.
Really, for my part, I don't want a breath to be raised.
PHÆD.
What then ?
CUR.
To eat, that I may rejoice on my arrival.
PHÆD.
May Jupiter and the Deities confound you.
CUR.
I'm quite undone;
I can hardly see;
my mouth is bitter;
my teeth, Ifind, are blunted3;
my jaws are clammy through fasting;
with my entrails thus lank with abstinence from food am I come.
PHÆD.
You shall eat something just now.
CUR.
I' faith, I don't want " something;
" I'd rather have what's fixed for certain, than your " something."
PHÆD.
Aye, but if you only knew what has been put by for you.
Cup.
I'd very much like to know where it is;
for really it's necessary for it and my teeth to make acquaintance.
PHASED.
A gammon of bacon, a sow's stomach, some udder and kernels of the throat.
Cup.
What, all this do you say ?
Perhaps you mean that they are in the flesh-market ?
PHÆD.
In the dishes, I mean ;
they've been got ready for you, since we knew that you were about to arrive.
Cup.
Take care you don't be fooling me.
PHÆD.
So may the fair one love me whom I love, I don't say what's false.
But as to what I sent you upon I'm none the wiser yet.
Cup.
I've brought back nothing.
PHÆD.
You've undone me.
CUR.
I can find something, if you'll give me your atten­ tion.
After, at your request, I had set out, I arrived in Caria;
I saw your friend;
I asked him to make me a loan of some money.
In answer, you were to know that he was willing to oblige you;
he didn't wish to disappoint you, as it is only proper that a person who is a friend should be ready, and should assist his friend.
In a few words he answered me, and quite in confidence, that he also was in the same extreme want of money as yourself.
PHÆD.
By your words you ensure my undoing.
CUR.
Why no;
I'm saving you, and wish you to be saved.
After this answer was given me, I went away from him to the Forum, in sorrow that I had applied to him in vain.
By accident I espied a military officer;
this person I accosted, and as I approached I saluted him. " Save you," said he to me, took my right hand, drew me aside, and asked me why I had come to Caria.
I said that I had come there for the sake of amusement.
Upon this he asked me whether I knew a certain Lyco, a banker of Epidaurus.
I said I knew him. " Well, and the Procurer Cappadox?”
I answered yes, that I had seen him. “ But what do you want of him ?" said I. "Because," said he, "I bought of him a girl for thirty minæ, her clothes and golden jewels too ;
and for these last ten minæ more are added “
Have you paid the money ?’ said I. " No,” said he;
" it is lodged with this Lyco the banker, whom I was mentioning, and I've instructed him that the person who should bring a letter sealed with my own ring, to him he was to give his services, that he might receive the damsel, with her jewels of gold and her clothes, from the Procurer."
After he told me this, I was going away from him.
At once he called me back, invited me to dinner;
it was a point of conscience, I was unwilling to refuse him. "
What if we go off home, and take our places at table said he.
The suggestion pleased me;
it is neither proper to lengthen out the day, nor to curtail the night.
Everything was prepared, and we, for whom it was prepared, were at our places.
After we had dined and well drunk, he asked for the dice to be fetched him.
He challenged me to play with him a game of hazard.
I staked my cloak, he staked his ring against it;
he called on the name1 of Planesium.
PHÆD.
What, my mistress ?
Cup.
Be silent a while.
He threw a most losing cast2.
I took up the dice, and invoked Hercules as my genial patron3;
I threw a first-rate cast4, and pledged him in a bumping cup;
in return he drank it off, reclined his head, and fell fast asleep.
I slily took away from him the ring, and took my legs quietly from off the couch, so that the Captain mightn't perceive it.
The servants en­ quired whither I was going;
I said that I was going whither persons when full are wont to go.
When I beheld the door, at once on the instant I betook myself away from the place.
PHÆD.
I commend you.
CUR.
Commend me when I've brought this thing about which you desire.
Now let'a go in- doors, that we may seal the letter.
PHÆD.
Do ] delay you ?
CUR.
But let's cram down something first, the gammon, the udder, and the kernels;
these are the foundations for the stomach, with bread and roast beef, a good-sized cup and a capacious pot, that counsel enough may be forthcoming.
Do you, yourself, seal the letter;
he'll do the honors (pointing to PALINURUS) while I am eating.
I'll dictate after what fashion you're to write.
Follow me this way, in-doors.
PHÆD.
I follow.
(They go into the house of PHÆDROMUS.)LYC.
I seem to be in opulence;
I've struck my balance, how much money I have, and how much I owe.
I'm rich, if I don't pay1 those to whom I'm in debt.
If I do pay those to whom I'm in debt, my debts are the greatest.
But really, upon my faith, when I carefully consider, if they press me hard, I'll resort to the Prætor2.
Most bankers have this habit, for one to borrow of the other, and to pay nobody, and to discharge the debt with their fists, if any one duns in a loudish tone.
The person that bas3 in a short time acquired wealth, unless in good time he saves it, in good time comes to starva­ tion.
I'd like to buy a servant for myself, who now, however, must be sought by me on hire4:
there's occasion for my ready money.
Cup..
Don't you be reminding me now Im full;
I recollect and understand.
I'll render up to you all this cleverly car­ ried out;
do hold your peace.
I' faith, I've surely filled myself in-doors right well, and still in my stomach I've left room for one corner, in which to stow away the rem­ nants of these remnants.
(Seeing LYCO.)
Who's this that with covered head is saluting Æsculapius ?
Heyday, the very man I wanted.
(To an ATTENDANT.)
Follow me.
I'll make pretence as though I didn't know him.
(Aloud.)
Hark you;
I want you.
Lie. (turning round).
One-eyed manl, save you.
CUR.
Prithee, do you jeer me ?
Lie.
I suppose that you are of the family of the Coclites2;
for they are one-eyed.
CUR.
This was knocked out for me by a catapulta, at Sicyon.
Lie.
What matters it to me, pray, if it had been knocked out by a broken pot with cinders in it ?CUR. (aside.)
This fellow's a wizard, surely8;
he tells the truth, for such catapultas are often directed at me.
(Aloud.)
Young man, as I bear this mark on my face4 in the service of the public, prithee don't be uncivil5 to me.
LYC.
May I then inforize6 you, if I may not incomi­ tiatize ?
CUR.
You shan't be inforizing me, indeed;
and really I don't care at all about your Forum or your Comitia.
But if you can point me out this person that I'm seeking, you will be doing me a real and a great service.
I'm looking for Lyco. the banker.
LYC.
Tell me why you are now seeking for him, or, of what country are you ?
CUR.
I'll tell you:
I'm come from Thera­ pontigonus Platagidorus, the Captain.
Lie.
I' faith, I know the name:
(aside) for with that same name, when I wrote, I filled four whole sides1.
(To CURCULIO.)
But why are you seeking for Lyco ?CUR.
(showing the letter).
I've been ordered to deliver this letter to him.
Lyc.
What person are you ?
CUR.
His freed.-man, whom all call Summanus2.
LYC.
Sum­ manus, my greetings.
But why Summanus ?
Let me know.
CUR..
Because, when in my drunken fit I've gone to sleep, I " summane3" the garments;
for that reason do all people call me Summanus.
Lyc.
'Twere better for you to look out for entertainment for you somewhere else ;
really in my own house I have no room for a Summanus.
But I am the person that you are looking for.
Cup.
Prithee, are you he, Lyco the banker ?
LYC I am.
Cup..
Therapontigonus requested me to give you a hearty greeting, and to deliver this letter.
LYC.
What, to me ?
CUR.
Just so.
Take it, recognize the seal.
Do you know it ?
(Lyco takes the letter.)LYC.
Why should I not know it ?
On which, a man, holding a shield, is cleaving an elephant asunder with a sword.
Cup.
What's written there he bade me request you to do immediately, if you wished for his esteem.
Lyc.
Step aside;
I'll look what's written in it.
CUR. (stepping aside).
By all means, at your pleasure, so long as I receive of you that which I'm come for.
Lyc. (reads).
" Therapontigonus Platagidorus, the Captain, his guest, sends to his host Lyco, at Epidaurus, right hearty greeting.”CUR. (aside).
This fellow'smyown;
he's swallowing the hook.
LYC. (going on). " I beg and request of you that, the person who delivers this letter to you, to him be given up the girl whom I purchased there (which I did there in your presence, and you being the negotiator), and the golden trinkets and clothes as well.
You know already how it was'agreed upon.
You give the money to the Procurer, and give the young woman to this person."
(To CURCULIO.)
Where is he him­ self?
Why doesn't he come ?
CUR.
I'll tell you;
because it is but four days since we arrived in Caria, from India;
there he now intends to order a solid golden statue to be made of Philippean gold, which is to be seven feet high-a memorial of his exploits.
LYC.
For what reason this?
CUR.
I'll tell you;
why, because within twenty days he singly has subdued the Per­ sians, Paphlagonians, Sinopians, Arabians, Cretans, Syrians, Rhodia and Lycia, Peredia and Bibesial, Centauromachia and Classia Unomammia2, and all Libya, and all Conterebromia;
one half even of all nations has he conquered unaided in twenty days.
Lyc.
Dear me!
CUR.
Why are you surprised ?
Lie.
Why, because if all these people were penned up in a cage as close as chickens, even so they couldn't be encom­ passed in a year.
Upon my faith, 1 do believe that you ares come from him;
for you do jabber such nonsense.
CUR.
Aye, and I can tell you still more, if you like.
Lie.
No;
I don't want it.
Follow me this way.
I'll pay you that, on account of which you came;
and lo, I see *Lyc.
Save you, Procurer.
CAP.
May the Gods prosper you.
LYC.
Do you know what this.
is about which I'm come to you ?
CAP.
Say on what you please.
LYC.
You are to receive the money, and to send away the young woman with him.
(Pointing to CURCULIO.)CAP.
But what if I'm bound on oath to another ?
Lyc.
What matters that to you, so long as you get the money ?
CAP.
He who advises is as good as an accomplice.
Do you follow.
CUR.
Procurer, take care that you don't cause me any delay.
(They go into the house of CAPPADOX.)CHOR.
By my faith, Phædromus has cleverly met with this clever rogue;
but whether a salt-water rogue2 or a dry-land one I'm the rather to say he is, I really don't know.
The costume that I've lent I fear I shan't get back.
Although I have nothing whatever to do with him (I trusted Phædromus himself), still I'll keep an eye upon him.
But until he comes out of doors, I'll point out in what place you may easily meet with each person, that he mayn't lose his labour through too much trouble, if any one wishes to meet either a rascal or one without rascality, or an honest man or a dishonest one.
He who desires to meet with a perjured fellow, let him go into the courts of laws;
he who wants a liar and a braggart, near the rites of Cloacina4.
The rich and erring husbands seek you at the magisterial halls of the Basilica.
There, too, will be the worn-out harlots, and those who are wont to haggle for them.
Contributors to pic-nic dinnersl you'll find in the fish market.
In the lower part of the Forum good men2 and opulent do walk;
in the middle, near the canal3, there are the mere puffers-off.
Beyond the lake4 of Ourtius are impu­ dent, talkative, and malevolent fellows, who boldly, without reason, utter calumnies about another, and who, themselves, have sufficient that might with truth be said against them.
There, at the old shops6, are those who lend and those who borrow at interest.
Behind the Temple of Castor there are those to whom unguardedly you may be lending to your cost.
There, in the Etrurian street, are those men who hold themselves6 on sale.
In the Velabrum7 you'll find either baker, or butcher, or soothsayer;
either those who sell retail themselves, or supply to others things to be sold by retail.
Rich sinning husbands you'll find at the house of Oppian Leucadia8.
But, meantime, the door makes a noise;
I must curb my tongue.
(Exit.CUR.
Maiden, do you go before;
what.
is behind me I cannot keep my eye upon.
Both the trinkets of gold, and all the clothing that she had, were his own, he said.
CAP.
No one is going to deny it.
CUR.
Still, however, it's somewhat better for me to remind you.
LYC.
Remember that you've undertaken, that, if any one should assert in course of law that she's properly free, all.
the money is to be returned to me—thirty minæ.
CAP.
I shall remember ;
be easy about that;
and now I say the same.
CUR.
But I wish you to remember this well.
CAP.
I remember, and I shall deliver her to you on war­ rantyl.
CUR.
And am I to take anything on warranty from a Pro­ curer, people who have nothing of their own except a tongue only ;
who, if anything's entrusted them, deny it upon oath?
You Procurers dispose of what belongs to others, you give liberty to what belongs to others, and what belongs to others your give your commands to ;
no guarantee of ownership is there in the transfer to yourselves, nor are you yourselves guarantees to another person.
The race of Procurers, among mortals, in my way of thinking at least, are just like flies, gnats, bugs, lice, and fleas—a plague, a mischief, and a nui­ sauce ;
you are of no serviceable use, and no respectable per­ son dares to stand with you in the Forum;
he that does associate with you, they censure him, he's spat upon and abused;
they say that he has lost his property and his honor, although he has done nothing at all.,Lyc.
Upon my faith, my clever one-eyed friend, in my way of thinking, you are well acquainted with the Procurers.
CUR.
You bankers, i' faith, I put and place in the same rank;
you are the very counterparts of them.
They, at least, are on sale in dark corners, you in the very Forum2.
You tear men to pieces with usury, they by persuading them amiss and by means of their dens.
Full many a proposed sta- tute1 has the public confirmed on your account, which when confirmed you break;
some loophole you find out;
just as boiling water becomes cold, so do you deem the laws.
LYC. (aside).
I'd rather I'd held my tongue.
CAP.
Not wrongfully, and with good reason, are you abusive against them.
CUR.
If abuse is uttered against those who deserve it not, that I do hold to be abuse ;
but if it is uttered against those who are deserving, it is fair censure, in my way 01 thinking, at least.
I care nothing about your warranty, nor about any other Procurer whatever.
Lyco, do you want anything with me ?
LYC.
Heartily fare you well.
CUR. Farewell.
(Going.)CAP.
Hark you!
I say to you-Cup.
Say on ;
what do you want ?
CAP.
Prithee do you take care that all's well with her (pointing to PLANESIUM) ;
I've brought her up in my house carefully and in chastity.
CUR.
If you have such compassion for her, pray, what would you give for it to be all well with her ?
CAP.
A plaguy mishap for yourself.
CUR.
You need take due care on that score about yourself.
CAP. (to PLANESIUM, who is weeping).
Why, simpleton, do you cry ?
Don't be afraid;
upon my faith, I've sold you favourably.
Take care,
Will you, and be a good girl;
now prettily accompany him, pretty one.
LYC.
Summanus, do you want anything with me at pre­ sent ?
CUR.
Fare you well, and health attend you.
(Aside.)
For you've kindly given me your services and your money.
LYC.
Give abundant greetings to my patron.
CUR.
I'll give them.
(Exit with PLANESIUM.
LYC.
Procurer, do you wish for anything ?
CAP.
Give me those ten minæ for me to manage for myself with, until things are better with me.
LYC.
They shall be paid ;
order them to be fetched to-morrow.
(Exit.CAP.
Since I've successfully finished the matter, I wish to return thanks here in the Temple.
For long since, when a little girl, I bought her for ten minæ;
but him who sold her to me, never since then have I set eyes upon.
I think he's dead.
What matters that to me ?
I've got the money.
The man to whom the Gods are propitious, for him, no doubt, they throw gain in his way.
Now will I give my attention to my devotions ;
it's clear that he has a kind regard for me.
(Goes into the Temple.)
THER.
I'm come now, inflamed with wrath in no moderate degree, but with that same with which I've learned to deal destruction upon cities.
At once now, unless this moment you make haste instantly to pay me the thirty minæ which I left with you, make haste to lay down your life.
Lyc.
By my troth, to no little mischief do I now devote you, but to that same to which I am wont to devote that man to whom I owe nothing at all.
THER.
Don't you be making yourself bold with me, or suppose that I shall be entreating you.
Lyc.
And you, indeed, shall never force me to pay you what has been paid, nor shall I give it you.
THEN.
I thought this, when I entrusted you with it, that you would repay nothing at all.
LYC.
Why then are you now asking it back of me ?
THER.
I wish to know to whom you have paid it.
Lyc.
To your one-eyed freed-man;
he said that he was called Summanus;
I paid it to him, who brought me this sealed letter.
(Gives him the letter.)THER.
What letter of mine, what one-eyed freed-man, what people called Summanus are you dreaming about ?
I really have no freed-man at all.
Lie.
You act more wisely than a portion of the military men who have freed-men, and then forsake them.
THER.
What have you done ?
Lie.
What you requested me, I've done for your sake, that I mightn't slight the messenger who had brought your seal's impression.
THER.
More fool than fool were you to give credit to this letter.
Lyc.
To that by which matters both public and private are carried on ought I not to have given credit ?
I'll be off;
the money has been properly paid you.
Warrior, farewell.
THER.
How—farewell ?
Lyc.
Fare you ill then, if you choose,—aye, all your life, so far as I'm concerned.
(Exit.THER.
What shall I do now ?
Of what use is it that I have caused kings to obey me, if this obscure fellow1 is this day to laugh at me ?CAP. (to himself).
The mail to whom the Gods are pro­ pitious, they cannot, I think, be angered with him.
After I had finished my devotions, it then came into my mind, lest the banker should abscond, to go fetch the money, that I may make good cheer rather than he.
THEE.
I had left my compliments for you at your house.
CAP.
Therapontigonus Platagidorus, save you;
since you are come safe to Epidaurus this day, at my house—you won't lick up one grain of salt2.
THER.
You give me a kind invitation;
things, however, are in a train for it to go badly with yourself.
But how fares my purchase at your house ?
CAP.
Why, not at my house at all.
Don't be bringing your witnesses—assuredly, I don't owe you anything.
THER.
How's that ?
CAP.
What I was bound on oath to do, I've done.
THER.
Will you give me up the girl or not, before I spit you with this sabre of mine, you whip-scoundrel ?
CAP.
I bid ycu go to perdition with all my heart;
don't you be terrifying me.
She has been carried off;
you shall be carried off hence away from me, beyond a doubt, if you persist in abusing me, to whom I owe nothing but a punishing.
THEE.
What, threaten me with a punishing ?
CAP.
Aye, and by my troth, I'll not be threatening, but I'll give it, if you persist in being impertinent to me.
THER.
A Procurer, forsooth, threatening me;
and are my combats in battle, so many in number, lying trodden under foot ?
But so may my sabre and my shield * * * * * trustily aid me when fighting in the field;
unless the girl is restored to me, I'll at once cause the ants to carry you away piecemeal from this spot.
CAP.
And so may my tweezers3, my comb, my looking- glass, my crisping-iron, and my hair-scissors and scrubbing­ towel love me well, I don't value your high-sounding words, nor these big threats of yours, a bit the more than my ser­ vant-girl that washes out my sink.
I've' given her up to him who brought the money from you.
THEN.
What person was that?
CAP.
He said that he was Summanus, your freed-man.
THER.
Mine ?
You don't say so;
i' faith, it's that Curculio that has put a trick upon me, when I think upon it;
he stole my ring from me.
CAP. (aside).
The Captain has been finely appointed to a cashiered company1.
THER.
Where now shall I find Curculio2 ?CAP.
In some wheat with the greatest ease I'll make you find even five hundred Curculios instead of one.
Therefore I'm off;
fare you well, and my service to you.
(Exit.THER.
Fare you ill, a plague attend you.
What shall I do ?
Shall I stop or go away ?
That I should have been imposed upon in this way!
I'd like to give a reward to him who would point out that fellow to me.
(Exit.CUR.
I've heard that an ancient Poet3 wrote in a Tragedy, that two women are worse than one;
such is the fact.
But a more crafty woman than is this mistress of Phædromus, I never saw or heard of, nor, i' faith, can one be spoken of or imagined;
she, as soon as ever she saw that I had got this ring, asked me whence I got it. " Why do you ask that ?" said I. "
Because I've need to know," said sce.
I said I wouldn't tell her.
To get it away, she seized hold of my hand with her teeth.
With much ado I betook me out of doors, and made my escape.
Away with this slut4.
PLAN.
My Phædromus, make haste.
PHÆD.
Make haste for what?
PLAN.
That you mayn't let the Parasite escape ;
the affair's of consequence.
PHÆD.
Nothing have 11 of consequence;
for what I did have I quickly made away with ?
(Seizes CURCULIO.)
I've got him;
what's the matter ?
PLAN.
Ask him whence he got that ring:
my father used to wear it.
CUR.
Why, troth, and so did my aunt.
PLAN.
My mother gave it him to wear.
CUR.
And your father, in his turn, to me.
PLAN.
You are talking nonsense.
CUR.
I'm in the habit;
for by reason of it I make a live­ lihood the more easily.
What is the matter now ?
PLAN.
I entreat you, don't be keeping me fromfinding my parents.
CUR.
How can I ?
Have I got your father and mother hidden beneath the stone ?
(Holding up the ring.)PLAN.
I was born a free woman.
CUR.
And so were many others, who are now in servitude.
PLAN.
Really now, I'm vexed.
CUR.
For my part, I've told you how this came into my possession.
How often must you be told ?
I cheated the Captain at dice, I tell you.
THEE. (eyeing CURCULIO).
l'in all right;
see, here he is whom I was looking for.
How do you do, good sir ?
CUR.
I hear you ;
three casts of the dice, if you like, even for that scarf of yours.
THEE.
Why don't you go to very perdition, with your casts and catch-pennies2 ?
Either give me back the money or the young woman ?CUR. (with an air of surprise).
What money ?
what rub­ bish are you talking about to me ?
What young woman are you demanding back of me ?
THEE.
The one that you took away this day from the Procurer, you scoundrelly fellow.
CUR.
I took none away.
THEE.
Why, surely, I see her.
There she is.
(Pointing to PLANE SIUM.)PHÆD.
This young woman is free.
THER.
What, my female slave free, to whom I have never given her liberty ?
PHÆD.
Who gave you possession of her, or of whom did you buy her ?
Let me know that ?
THER.
Why, I paid the money for her through my banker-a sum which I'll have re­ funded to me fourfold by you and the Procurer.
PHÆD.
You, who understand how to traffic in young women, kidnapped and of free birth, come you before the judge.
THER.
I shan't come.
PHÆD.
I may call my witnessl to the summons.
THER.
No, you mayn't.
PHÆD.
May Jupiter then utterly confound you:
live without witnesses2 then.
CUR.
But I'm a person that he may summon.
PHÆD. (to CURCULIO).
Do you step this way.
THEE.
What ?
A slave summoned as a witness ?
Take you care.
CUR.
Well, that you may know it, I'm free.
THER.
Then come before the judge.
There's for you:
take that.

Step this way you (pushes him towards the CAPTAIN) ;
there, I'll give him up to you.
Hold your noise.

As I would myself and my own good Genius.
Cap­ tain, prithee, do tell me whence you got that ring, which this Parasite purloined from you.

By your knees, I do entreat you to give us that information.

What matters that to you ?
You might as well ask after this sabre and this scarf, how each came into my possession.
CUR.
What airs the swaggerer does give himself!
THER.
Send that fellow away (pointing to CURCULIO) ;
then I'll tell you all.

It's nonsense what he says..
PHÆD.
Prithee, do let me know.

Listen to this matter, arid give atten­ tion.
My father Periphanes used to wear it.

Ha!
Periphanes ?
THER.
He, before he died, gave it to me as being his son, as it was right he should.
PLAN. 0 J upiter!
THER.
And on that occasion he made me his heir.
PLAN. 0 filial affection, do thou preserve me, since I have carefully preserved thee.
Welcome, my brother.
THER.
How am I to believe that ?
Tell me, if you are speaking the truth, who was your mother ?
PLAN.
Cleobula.
THER.
Who was your nurse ?
PLAN.
Archestrata.
Amid the sacred rites of Bacchus she had carried me to see the sights * * * * * * * after we had come thither, when now she had found me a place, a whirlwind arose1;
the scaf­ folding2 of the stage there tumbled down;
I was greatly alarmed, and then some one, I know not who, seized hold of me trembling and frightened, neither alive nor dead;
and in what manner he carried me off I cannot say.
THER.
I recollect that disturbance happening ;
but, do you tell me, where is this person, who carried you away ?
PLAN.
I know not;
but (showing a ring) this ring I have all along preserved by me, with it long since was I lost.
THER.
Give it me to look at.
Cup. (to PLANESIUM).
Are you in your senses to be trusting it to that fellow ?
(Holds her arm.)PLAN.
Do you only leave me alone.
(She gives it to the CAPTAIN.)
THER. (examining it).
O Jupiter!
This is the same that I presented you upon your birthday;
I recognize it as easily as my own self.
Welcome to you, my sister.
PLAN.
My brother, welcome to you.
PHÆD.
I trust the Gods will prosper this matter for you.
CUR.
And I, for all of us.
(To the CAPTAIN.)
Do you, as having this day arrived, give a dinner in honor of your sister;
he (pointing to PHÆDROMUS), to-morrow, will give one in honor of his marriage ;
we promise that.
CUR.
I shan't hold my tongue, as things are turning out so well.
Captain, do you promise her to him ;
I'll give the marriage-portion.
THER.
What is the marriage-portion ?
CUR.
What, that I give ?
Why, that always as long as he lives he's to feed me.
THER.
I' troth, he says what's fair;
with my consent you shall do so.
But this Procurer owes me the thirty minæ.
PHÆD.
For what reason so ?
THER.
Because he agreed with me on these terms to give it back:
that if any one should assert her to be free born in due course of law, he would, without dispute, pay back all the money.
CUR.
Then let's go to the Procurer.
THER.
I agree.
PHÆD.
This first I wish;
to despatch my matter.
THER.
What's that ?
PHÆD.
That you will betroth her to me.
(The CAPTAIN considers.)CUR.
Why do you hesitate, Captain, to give her as a wife to him ?
THER.
If she is agreable.
PLAN.
My brother, it is my wish.
THER.
So be it then.
CUR.
You do rightly.
PHÆD.
Captain, do you betroth me to her for my wife ?
THER.
I do betroth her.
PHÆD. (pointing to CURCULIO).
And to him do I promise support at my expense..
CUR.
You do kindly.
But * * * * * # * * THEE.
* *** *
But see, here's the Procurer coming ;
my treasurer 1, I mean.
CAP.
(to himself).
Those who say2 it's bad for bankers to be trusted, utter nonsense;
I say it's neither good nor bad for them to be trusted, and that, I've fully experienced this day.
They are not 1 badly trusted, who never repay, but with whom it is lost outright.
As for example, before this Lyco paid me the ten minæ, he had to go to every banker's counter.
After there were no proceeds, I summoned the fellow with much noise;
he appealed against me to the court.
I was most confoundedly afraid that this day he'd be settling accounts with me before the Prætor 2;
but my friends forced him, so he paid the money at home.
Now I'm resolved to make haste to my house.
(Runs towards his door.)THER.
Hallo!
you Procurer ;
I want you.
PHÆD.
And I want you.
CAP.
But I don't want either of you.
THEE.
Stay this instant, will you.
PHÆD.
And make you haste to disgorge the money with all despatch.
CAP. (to PHÆDROMUS).
What have you to do with me?
(To the CAPTAIN.)
Or what have you ?
THER.
Because this day I shall be making a javelin of you, discharged from a catapult a, and twist you with the string3, just as the catapultas are in the habit of doing.
PHÆD.
I'll this day make a coxcomb of you, to be sleeping with a puppy4 in your bed—an iron one, I mean.
CAP.
But I'll make you both to be rotting in a strong-barred prison.
THER.
Seize him by the throat, and away with him to extreme torture.
PHÆD.
However that is, he'll be going there of his own accord.
(The CAPTAIN seizes him.)CAP.
0 Gods and men, your aid!
that I, uncondemned, and without evidence against me, should thus be dragged along!
Prithee, Planesium, and you, Phædromus, do give me assistance.
PLAN.
Brother, I do beseech you, don't ruin him uncon­ demned;
he treated me kindly and modestly at his house.
THER.
That was through no inclination of his own;
give you thanks to this Æsculapius1 (pointing to the Temple) that you've preserved your chastity;
for if he had been well, he'd long ago have packed you off wherever he could.
PHÆD.
Now attend to me, both of you, if I can arrange between you.
(To the CAPTAIN.)
You let him go.
Pro­ curer, come you this way.
I'll pronounce my opinion, if indeed you are ready to abide by what I shall decide you should do.
THEN.
We leave it to you.
(He lets go of the PROCURER.)CAP.
So long, i' faith, as you give a decision to the effect that no one is to take the money away from me.
THER.
What, not that which you promised ?
CAP.
I, promised ?
How ?
THER.
With your tongue.
CAP.
With that same tongue I now gainsay it;
that was given me by Nature for the purpose of speaking, not of losing my property.
THEE..
He's trifling;
seize the fellow by the throat.
(Seizes him.)
CAP.
I'll at once then do as you bid me.
THER.
Since you are an honest man, answer me this that I ask you.
CAP.
Ask me what you please.
THER.
Did you not promise, that if any one should show that she (pointing to PLANESIUM) was freeborn, you would pay back all the money ?
CAP.
I don't remember saying so.
THER.
What, do you deny it ?
CAP.
I' faith, I really do deny it.
In whose presence ?
In what place was it ?
THER.
In my own presence, and that of Lyco the banker.
CAP.
Why don't you hold your tongue ?
THER.
I shan't hold my tongue.
CAP.
I don't care a rush for you;
don't be bullying me.
THER.
In my own presence and that of Lyco it took place.
PHÆD. (to the CAPTAIN).
I quite believe you.
Now, therefore, Procurer, that you may know my judgment, (pointing to PLANESIUM) she is a free woman;
he (pointing to the CAPTAIN) is her brother, and she is his sister;
she is engaged to me;
do you restore him the money;
that's my decision.
CAP.
Upon my faith, Phædromus, you have given this de.
cision corruptly.
It shall both be bad for you, and you, Cap­ tain,—may the Gods and Goddesses confound you.
THER.
And as for you, you shall be clapt in prison at once, unless the money's returned me.
CAP.
Then follow me.
THER.
Follow you where ?
CAP.
To my banker-to the Prætorl;
for it's there that I pay my money to all persons to whom I'm indebted.
THER.
I'll be carrying you hence to prison, and not to the Prætor, if you don't pay back the money.
CAP.
I do most earnestly wish you may come to a bad end, so don't misunderstand me2.
THER.
Do you really so ?
CAP.
I' faith, I really do so.
THEE.
I don't misunderstand these fists of mine.
(Hold­ ing them up.)CAP.
What then ?
THER.
What then, do you ask ?
With these same fists, if you provoke me, I'll be making you quiet immediately.
CAP.
(taking the money from his girdle).
Well then, take this back at once.
THEE, (taking the money).
By all means.
PHÆD.
Captain, you'll dine with me;
the nuptials shall take place to-day.
THER.
May this matter turn out well for me and for yourselves.
Spectators, give us your applause.
