THE spring of the year B. c. 421 found Athens and Sparta alike weary of the long continuance of the Peloponnesian War, and alike disposed to put an end to the conflict upon any fair and honourable terms.
The War had now lasted exactly ten years:
and as its fortunes alternated from side to side, Athens at one time, and Sparta at another, had been reduced to offer conditions of peace ;
but hitherto the very events, which had caused the offer to be made by one combatant, had themselves ensured its rejection by the other.
Now, for the first time, the wishes of both coincided;
both felt that they had far more to lose than to gain by a further prolongation of hostilities;
both were therefore eager to terminate the War, and the desire of Peace was as ardent and as genuine on the one side as on the other.
The LACEDAEMONIANS had commenced the war with the reputation of invincible prowess, and with the general sympathy of Hellas strongly manifested in their favour.
And notwithstanding the warnings of their wiser and more experienced counsellors, they had imagined that it would be but an easy task for their great Confederacy to chastise and humble the Imperial Republic which had dared to subjugate, and was holding in tributary vassalage, so many Hellenic cities, formerly as free and inde­ pendent as herself.
They looked forward to a few1 short and decisive cam­ paigns which would win them immortal glory, and the thanks and gratitude of a liberated Hellas.
These visions had been rudely and completely dis­ pelled.
The Peloponnesian vessels had been swept from the seas by the Athenian navy :
the Peloponnesian army had found no enemy to encounter, no fame to acquire :
its main occupation had consisted in ravaging the harvests, and despoiling the homesteads, of Attica ;
an occupation in­ glorious in itself, and unlikely, as it seemed, to be productive of any substantial effect upon the ultimate issue of the War.
No doubt much suffering and many losses were inflicted upon the Athenian people by this series of devastations;
but these were speedily and amply avenged by incessant1 and destructive descents upon the Peloponnesian coasts, ex­ tending even into the proper territories of Sparta herself.
Far from crumbling to pieces before the imposing forces of the Peloponnesian Confederacy, the Republic of Athens, when once she had shaken off the despondency occasioned in the earlier stages of the War by the pestilence and the invasions, seemed to gather fresh elasticity from the dangers which environed her, and almost to vindicate her right to empire, by the intrepid activity with which she carried the War into the enemies!
country, assailing them on every side with strokes so nimble and rapid, as completely to baffle and confound the proverbial slowness of the Spartan operations.
During the seventh, and the greater part of the eighth, years of the War, the tide was setting strongly and steadily against the Lacedaemonian cause.
The happy audacity of the Athenian Demosthenes in occupying and fortifying Pylus, was rewarded by the unlooked-for capture of the Spartan troops upon the islet of Sphacteria, a disaster which shook the Spartan reputation throughout Hellas, and inspired the numerous families, who were in any way connected with the captives, with a personal interest in the restoration of Peace.
Henceforth the one idea of the Lacedaemonian Government was to get rid of the War, and recover the captives.
Embassy after embassy was sent, to solicit peace from Athens:
embassy after embassy returned, to report that no peace could be obtained.
The Athenians declared that, if a Spartan army again crossed the borders of Attica, the captives should at once be led out to execution;
and having thus secured immunity for their own country, they proceeded to assail and ravage the coasts of Peloponnesus more incessantly and more system­ atically than ever.
Towards the close of the eighth year of the War we find Athens the undisputed mistress of the seas;
her triremes infesting the whole Peloponnesian seaboard;
her garrisons established in strongholds commanding the peninsula on every side, at Nisaea, Methone, Cythera, Pylus.
We find peaceful Laconian towns surprised and sacked by her flying detachments;
the Aeginetans pursued into their Laconian asylum, and massacred to a man j the Messenians, the deadliest enemies of the Spartan name, firmly planted at Pylus ;
the Helots deserting in numbers;
Ionian trophies erected on the very soil of Laconia itself;
and the scattered Spartan garrisons unable successfully to cope with their nimble and ubiquitous adversaries.
No wonder that the Lacedaemonians were dis­ tressed and bewildered, when they found themselves I hemmed in on every side by a system of warfare so novel and unexpected:
whilst their own prestige had suffered, and their high position been perceptibly lowered, even amongst their own allies.
In this strait a diversion was made in their favour by the brilliant exploits of Brasidas towards the close of the eighth year of the War.
Throwing himself boldly into the midst of the Athenian dependencies on the north-west shores of the Aegean, he detached city after city from the Athenian empire, as much by his wise and conciliatory policy, his winning and attractive character, and the confidence which his presence everywhere inspired, as by his consummate military skill.
But his countrymen, πολέμων διαποντίων ἂπειροι 1, were unable to appreciate his schemes and combinations, which passed far beyond the contracted horizon of their own narrow political traditions:
it was mainly as affording an outlet for their discontented and unoccupied soldiery, and as drawing out of the country the most daring, and therefore the most dangerous, of the Helots, that they had originally encouraged, or rather, perhaps, acquiesced in, his adventurous enterprise:
and his unlooked-for success was welcomed, not for its own sake, but because it seemed to open a prospect of at length recovering the Sphacterian captives.
And hence it was that they were unwilling to rely too much on the chances of war.
Successes so easily obtained might perhaps be as easily lost:
Perdiccas, who had originally invited their troops, had fallen off again to the Athenian alliance:
the passage through Thessaly was barred to reinforcements :
and the Spartans were eager to conclude a Peace while yet they had a fair equivalent to offer in exchange for the captives.
There was yet another circumstance which rendered the Spartan Government peculiarly anxious at this moment to be at peace with Athens.
Their treaty with Argos, which had lasted for thirty years, was on the eve of expiring, and grave apprehensions were entertained lest the Argives were preparing to seize the opportunity of regaining, with the assistance of Athens, their old traditionary predominance amongst the Dorians of the Peloponnesus.
The ATHENIANS, on their part, were equally desirous of effecting a termination of hostilities.
They had nothing to gain from the War, which had, in fact, been forced upon them, and in which the struggle on their side had been commenced merely to maintain, and not to extend, their existing empire.
At the first their hope had only been that they might come out of the conflict with undiminished power and importance :
they had entered upon it with undisguised reluctance, and, indeed, a large and powerful party had always been opposed to its continuance.
And the War had, from the outset, entailed upon them great and peculiar sacrifices.
The surrender of all the local institutions and country homes to which they, beyond all other Hellenic peoples, had from time immemorial been devotedly attached :
the spectacle which met their eyes, as they gazed from their city walls, of a rude and hostile soldiery pillaging their farms and vineyards, hacking down their olives and fig-trees, and destroying all that they held most dear:
the exchange of the ease and freedom, the thousand pleasures of a country life for stifling huts and cells, or rather for any hastily extemporized shelter which they could find or construct (for there were no roofs to accommodate the multitudes which kept pressing into the city):
and above all, the appalling visitation of the Pestilence which burst forth with unprecedented fury amidst these overcrowded immigrants, cooped and penned together in their miserable dwellings, so that " they died like sheep," says the historian, " corpses piled on corpses about the wells, and in the open spaces of the city":
such were to Athens the immediate results of the declaration of War.
Her spirit sank before these accumulated calamities, and she attempted to open negotiations for Peace.
But her offers were rejected:
and stricken by disease, not only in the city but also in her fleets and armies, she was compelled to carry on the War with an impoverished treasury and a desponding population.
Her energy, however, remained unabated :
and gradually the pestilence wore itself out;
the Peloponnesian invasions lost, by repetition, much of their terrors;
and the Athenians, at length, found their gallantry and perseverance rewarded by a series of successes, culminating in that great and astonishing event-the capture of the Spartan troops upon the islet of Sphacteria.
The surrender of a Spartan army, an event unprecedented in History, created a profound sensation throughout Hellas, and seems to have stimulated to a prodigious degree the hopes and aspirations of Athens;
her ambition began to take a wider flight (μειζόνων ὠρέγοντο)1:
and whereas she had hitherto sought merely to maintain and secure her maritime empire, she appears now for the moment to have conceived the idea of estab­ lishing her supremacy over the Hellenic race as well by land as by sea.
An invasion of Boeotia was the natural stepping-stone to the accom­ plishment of these high designs.
It was not the first time that Athens had cast a longing eye upon those rich pasturages, those lakes and plains swarming with fish and fowl;
and she had on one occasion succeeded in acquiring, and actually maintained for nearly ten years, an ascendancy over the whole Boeotian territory.
The Boeotians, always inert and sluggish, had never attempted to retaliate:
they were content to repel, as best they might, the efforts made for their subjugation, and never thought of overstepping their own frontiers to carry on an aggressive warfare against their active and enterprising enemy.
And the Athenians, therefore, now proposed, by a vigorous attempt, to reduce Boeotia wholly beneath their influence and control.
But their scheme, however well conceived, was ill carried into execution;
the various detachments failed to co-operate with each other, and the ambitious hopes of Athens were at once dashed to the ground by the signal overthrow which the Boeotians gave to the whole Athenian army among the deep 1 ravines and sloping shrub-covered hills over which the modern traveller passes as he journeys from Delium to Oropus.
All the military forces of Athens (excepting such as were at the moment actually engaged on foreign service) seem to have been present on that fatal field :
and all were overcome and borne down by the sturdy Boeotians, whose habit of gross and heavy eating (ἀδηφαγία) 2 dulled, in- deed, their mental faculties ;
but endowed their bodies with a weight and strength which rendered them almost irresistible in the push of shields (ὠθισμὸς ἀσπίδων) with which Hellenic armies closed.
Delium was the grave of those splendid hopes to which Sphacteria had given birth.
So great and irreparable an overthrow not only 1 destroyed the newly-gained reputation of the Athenian arms, but seems also to have given rise for the first time to painful and distressing apprehensions at Athens 2, lest the Boeotians, flushed with success, should throw off the singular reluctance which they had hitherto always displayed to cross their own frontier (and which had even wellnigh withheld them from attacking the invading Athenian host on that border-land whereon the battle of Delium was fought) and should lead their victorious forces into the defenceless fields of Attica.
And it would seem that the Athenian army became, to a certain extent, demoralized 3 by its defeat, and lost those habits of obedience and discipline which still distinguished the efficient and well-trained Athenian navy.
A still heavier blow was awaiting the Athenians.
Brasidas was in the midst of their invaluable possessions on the north-west coast of the Aegean :
city after city was falling away to him, each wishing to be the first to revolt;
Acanthus, Stagirus, the great and important town of Amphipolis, Torone, Scione, Mende, were already in his hands;
the whole fabric of their empire was shaken to its centre.
The flower of the Athenian army was dispatched, under Cleon, to recapture Amphipolis;
but the troops were disorganized, the leader was incompetent, and they were totally routed under the walls of Amphipolis, almost without striking a blow.
What effect this crushing defeat might have upon the Athenian allies, it was of course impossible to conjecture;
and Athens began to repent that she had not, while yet on the vantage-ground of success, accepted the favourable terms which the Spartans had then been ready to give.
Thucydides1 tells us that the two chief obstacles to peace had been Cleon, the Athenian demagogue, and Brasidas, the Spartan general:
Brasidas, because of the success and the glory which he was gaining in the War;
Cleon, because in quiet times his malpractices would be more apparent and his calumnies less easily believed.
It was, indeed, chiefly through the restless activity of Brasidas that the armistice for one year, which had been concluded in the spring of B.C. 423 (very shortly after the battle of Delium), had been rendered abortive;
nor can we wonder if, with the brilliant career which was then opening before him, he strained every nerve to prevent its being closed by the ill-timed advent of Peace.
The battle of Amphipolis removed both these obstacles:
Cleon was slain by a Myrcinian targeteer as he fled from the field of combat:
Brasidas was one of the seven who fell on the Lacedaemonian side.
And now arose throughout Hellas an earnest and impatient yearning after the Peace which, it was obvious, could not be long withheld 1.
So strong was the feeling that the War was about to determine, that hostili­ ties were suspended by tacit consent, and the Spartan reinforcements, under Rhamphias, turned back from Thessaly of their own accord :
partly, no doubt, for other reasons, but 2 " chiefly," says Thucydides, " because they knew that, when they left Sparta, their Government was bent upon making a peace.
"It was at this moment, when the prospect of the restoration of Peace to Hellas was the one great topic which engrossed all hearts and tongues, that Aristophanes composed the Comedy which, from its subject, he named " The Peace."
It was exhibited 3 at the great city Dionysia, in the archonship of Alcaeus, March, B.C. 421.
And hardly had it been produced upon the stage, when the Peace of which it sang dawned upon the Hellenic world.
The Peace of Nicias was concluded in March or April, B.C. 421, immediately after the great city Dionysia in the same archonship of Alcaeus 1.
It was no mere five years' truce, savouring of tar, and dockyards, and naval preparations—no mere ten years truce, savouring of intrigues and political combinations-not even a mere thirty years' truce, to which the hopes of Aristophanes had, four winters earlier, been limited—it was a Peace for fifty years, a term of which few, who had served in the War, could reasonably expect to see the expiration.
Almost immediately after the Peace, a defensive alliance was made between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, and the prisoners on each side were released.
So ended the first period of the Peloponnesian War, a period which, by way of distinction, was subsequently, from the King who led the Spartan armies at its commencement, called the Archidamian War.
It is said in line 990 of this Play that the Athenians had for thirteen years been languishing for want of Peace.
And it was, therefore, at one time contended by Paulmier and others that, inasmuch as the Pelopon­ nesian War did not formally commence until the year B.C. 431, the Play could not have been written until the year B. c. 419 or 418.
But this objection assumes that the peace between the Athenian Empire and the Peloponnesian Confederacy had remained undisturbed by any hostilities until the formal commencement of the Peloponnesian War:
whereas, in truth, for a period of fully three years before the actual declaration of war on the part of the whole Confederacy, Athens had been incessantly coming into collision with some of its principal members.
Not only had the Megarians, by a formal interdict, been excluded from all intercourse with the Athenian empire;
but the forces of Athens and Corinth had clashed in open and undisguised conflict, both on the east and on the west coasts of Hellas, at Potidaea on the one side and at Corcyra on the other.
No less than ten States had taken part with Corinth in the first expedi­ tion to Corcyra;
and, when Athens actively interposed in favour of the Corcyraeans, it was felt on all sides that the War was virtually begun.
The period which intervened before the Peloponnesian Confederacy, as a whole, could be set in motion against Athens was anything but a period of peace and tranquillity.
Thucydides clearly regarded it as a mere prelude to the more formal War:
a season of trouble and uneasiness, of broken treaties, of complaints and recriminations, of wars and rumours of wars:
the skirmishing which preceded the actual conflict of the great Hellenic powers.
It is, therefore, strictly accurate to say that in the year B. c. 421 the Athenians had for thirteen years been deprived of the blessings of Peace :
nor is there any real contradiction, as has been alleged by some, between such a statement as this, and those contained in the Acharnians and the Knights 2.
There the poet is referring to events-the exclusion of the products of Boeotia from the Athenian market, and the flocking of the country population into Athens-which happen to have been almost exactly coincident in date with the formal commencement of the Pelo­ ponnesian War.
Here he is speaking of a state of conflict and disquietude which had existed for a considerable period prior to such formal com­ mencement.
The correct view was ably and successfully maintained yei, Gray, and others.
And the controversy is now set at rest, and the date of the Play fixed'for the year B.C. 421, by the discovery of the valuable chronological notice which forms the concluding portion of the Second Argument (infra, page xli), and which was first transcribed by Bekker from the Venetian MS., and published in the year 1829.
The last distinguished supporter of Paulmier's theory was Mr. Fynes Clinton, in his " Fasti Hellenici," and he, in the Compendium published shortly before his death, acknowledged his error and adopted the correct date.
And, indeed, it is surprising that any doubt should ever have been entertained on the subject.
The entire Play would have been an anachronism in any other year.
Not only do all the incidental historical notices scattered throughout the scenes, the various circumstances of the several Hellenic peoples, and the motives by which they were respectively actuated in the negotiations for Peace, accord with this epoch, and with none other:
not only does the general tone of thought suit no other period of the War:
but the cardinal historical fact on which the Play itself is founded absolutely excludes the possibility of any other date.
Brasidas and Cleon were dead (they died in the summer of B.C. 422):
the Peace was not yet made (it was made in the spring of B.C. 421).
«The Peace" is, in my judgement, the tamest 2 and (if the expression is allowable) the most un-Aristophanic of all the extant Comedies of Aristophanes.
It has little of the inexhaustible merriment, the exuberant vivacity, of his other Plays;
and still less of that keen satire, that exquisite wit, that occasional sublimity of sentiment, that grace and elegance of thought and diction, which render his great masterpieces such unrivalled combinations of almost every poetical excellence.
The plot is loose and disjointed;
an important part of the Parabasis is repeated from one of his earlier plays;
and the production of a colossal image of Peace is a somewhat clumsy and inelegant device, and, as such, was justly assailed with ridicule by his able and witty antagonists 1, Eupolis and the comedian Plato.
Yet the Play is not without its own special and characteristic excel­ lences.
Its very defects were in some degree occasioned by the all­ absorbing importance, at the moment, of the subject with which it was dealing;
and by the strong and earnest feelings which that subject was everywhere calling forth.
It was the gravity of the crisis in which and for which the Play was written, which, to a certain extent, dulled the vivacity and cramped the vigour of the great comedian.
For years he had been labouring in furtherance of peace, and in opposition to the turbulent policy of Cleon;
and now that Cleon was no more, the eager anxiety with which men looked for the restoration of peace and goodwill among the Hellenic peoples was almost too serious and too real for the lighthearted raillery and ridicule in which, at all other times, Aristo­ phanes loved to indulge.
The Play breathes throughout a genuine appreciation of, and desire for, the enjoyments of rural life ;
a yearning such as all true countrymen, pent within the limits of a great city, must at times experience for " the fragrance of their old paternal fields."
Few country scenes of antiquity have received more hearty commendation, in modern times, than the second instalment of the Parabasis of this Play ;
" ou 1on respire, . says M. Pierron, "une des plus fraîches senteurs de la campagne.
"Je demande," asks M. Fallex, " s'il y a rien de plus gracieux que les scenes ravissantes de la Paix, d'ou s'exhale je ne sais quel parfum d'idylle antique."
IAnd the Play abounds also, like all the writings of Aristophanes, with genuine kindly Panhellenic sentiments, occasionally rising, amidst all the burlesque with which they are surrounded, into a strain of almost solemn and pathetic dignity, as in that beautiful address to Peace which may be called the Consecration hymn.
It is a serious defect in the constitution of the plot that the Play naturally divides itself into two distinct sections, differing from each other in purpose, in character, and even in locality.
The first half of the Play represents the Recovery of Peace from the celestial abodes:
the second exhibits the festivities and social enjoyments which welcome her restoration to the earth.
The Parabasis separates the two sections.
The first half of the Play, at times, almost assumes the character of a didactic historical poem, and becomes a most interesting supplement to and illustration of the graver history of the Peloponnesian War.
The harmony which exists in all substantial points between the statements of Aristophanes and those of Thucydides is only rendered more valuable from the circumstance that the writers are regarding the same events from totally different points of view.
The historian records accomplished events :
the poet, for a moment, lifts the veil and gives us a glance at the same events whilst yet in the process of accomplishment, an instan­ taneous but complete and vivid glimpse of the underlying forces, of the hopes, the fears, the suspicions, the doubts, the rivalries, which were co-operating in their formation.
The poet writes of the ever-shifting panorama before his eyes, whilst the waves are yet in motion, the wind perpetually changing, and it is all uncertain what the results may be.
The historian records the results when they have passed into the irrevocable domain of fact, when the winds are laid, and the waves have again settled down into a state of calm and motionless tranquillity.
So much the more striking is the accord which we everywhere find between the light offhand touches of Aristophanes, and the well-considered judge­ ments of Thucydides;
and that, not merely when they are treating of actual events, or estimating the conduct and character of individuals, but also when they are tracing the various dispositions and tendencies of the several Hellenic States.
The historical portion of the Play terminates with the commencement of the Parabasis :
the social scenes which follow, though censured1 as not directly advancing the action of the piece, yet exhibit much more of that genial and mirthful pleasantry, which is one distinguishing characteristic of Aristophanic Comedy."
The Peace " of Aristophanes was placed second at the Great Dionysia:
the prize was awarded to " The Flatterers" (Κόλακς) of Eupolis, and " The Clansmen " (Φράτορες) of Leucon was placed third.
The Flatterers of Eupolis 2 appears to have fully deserved the victory which it obtained.
It was one of those vigorous outbursts of bitter indignant satire for which that great poet was distinguished among his contemporaries :
its object being Callias, the brother-in-law of Alcibiades, and the wealthiest Athenian of his day, a voluptuary who squandered his colossal fortunes with profuse and reckless extravagance upon every kind of luxury and sensual pleasure, and who was attended wherever he went by a crowd 1 of fawning sophists, poets, rhetoricians, and other sycoph ts and parasites.
These formed the Chorus of the Play, and were described as men whom neither fire nor sword could keep from their patron's table 2.
Meineke cites from Maximus Tyrius (Diss. xx, section 7) the statement that Kaλλίaν ἐν Διονσίοις ἐκωμῴει Εὒπολις, ἰδιώτην ἂνδρα ἐν συμποσίοις κολακεόμενον, ὂπου τη̃ς κολακείας τὸ ἆθλον ἦν κύλικες Kal ἐται̃ραι Kat ἂλλαι ταπειναὶ Kal ἀνδραποδώεις ἠδοναὶ, and refers to this practice the nineteenth fragment of the Play-The Comedy was much esteemed by ancient critics, and more than thirty fragments of it have survived to our own times.
Little is known of the dramatic writings of Leucon.
Meineke 3 cites but three quotations from, or rather perhaps references to, his comedies;
and all three belong to this play of the Clansmen.
In one point the three Comedies seem to have concurred:
the Flatterers, the Peace, the Clansmen alike contained an attack upon the greedy and fawning character of the tragedian 4 Melanthius.
The first of the Arguments prefixed to this Play contains the following statement :
—"(
Aristophanes is said in the didascaliae to have exhibited an Εὶρήνη on two5 distinct occasions:
it is uncertain, therefore, says Eratosthenes, whether he exhibited the same Play a second time, or produced another which has not come down to us.
Crates, however, recognized two plays, writing thus :
at all events in the Acharnians, or in the Babylonians, or in the second Peace.
And, indeed, there are many scattered passages cited as from the Peace which are not to be found in the existing Play.
"This is, I believe, the only passage in the whole range of ancient literature in which any allusion is made to a second Play of the same name as the present:
and on this passage we may fairly make the following observations:
-(1).
That beyond twice recording the success 'Αριστοφάνους Εἰρήνῃ, the didascaliae would probably give no information on the subject.(2).
That the writer of the Argument had certainly never seen any second Peace.(3).
That Eratosthenes had certainly never seen any second Peace, and had no grounds, excepting such as were furnished by the entries in the didascaliae, for suspecting that such a Play had ever in fact existed.(4).
That the language attributed to Crates does not by any means necessarily imply that he had ever seen any second Peace;
and, indeed, it is highly improbable that he should have been acquainted with a Play, the very existence of which had escaped the investigation of so learned and industrious a student as Eratosthenes.(5).
That the passages to which the author of the Argument refers must have been invariably cited as from the Peace simpliciter, and cannot in any instance have been cited as from the second Peace eo nomine.(6).
That the old grammarians, citing passages from memory, are constantly referring them to the wrong play ;
and therefore the mere fact that passages, cited as from the Peace, are not to be found in the existing Play, raises little or no presumption of the existence of another play of that name.
The fragments of Aristophanes have been collected by Canter, Coddaeus, Brunck, Dindorf, and Bergk 1.
Their united researches have brought together six passages only cited as from the Peace, and not found in the existing Play.
Of these six fragments, one is from Pollux, one from Stobaeus, one from Suidas, and the remaining three from Eustathius.
The earliest of these writers lived centuries after the time of Eratosthenes;
and it is very unlikely that they should have seen the play which the research of that great scholar was unable to discover:
and even had they done so, it is absolutely incredible that after the doubts expressed by Eratosthenes (with whose works they were well acquainted) they should have invariably spoken of it simply as the Peace, without ever in any way distinguishing it from the more celebrated Play of that name, which had always been well and familiarly known.
Let us now examine seriatim the six passages in question:
-The first is found in Pollux x, Segm.
188, where it is said, 'Ev yovv τῃ̑ 'Αριϭτοφάνους [Εἰρήνῃ γέγραπται]
The words Εἰρήνῃ γέγρπται are omitted in some of the MSS.
of Pollux;
and whether they are clue to Pollux himself or to some copyist, it is, I think, highly probable that the reference intended is to the existing Play, the writer recollecting that, towards the close of the Comedy, Trygaeus does in truth recommend the conversion of the shield to certain domestic purposes, though a well-cover is not among them.
Stobaeus (Florilegium, Tit. lvi, ed. Gaisford) cites the two following passages in commendation of the art of husbandry:
-The second passage is vv. 556, 557, of the existing Play.
And it has been suggested with great probability that the heading 'Αριϭτοφάνους Εἰρήνης has been accidentally misplaced, " qui plurimorum," says Dindorf 1, " in Stobaeo fons errorum fuit," and that the first passage is really taken from the Γεωργοὶ (Farmers) of Aristophanes.
Here we can fortunately at once detect and rectify the error;
for Suidas is but transcribing the Scholiast on Clouds, 699, where the line is cited as being not ἐν Εἰρήνῃ but ἐν 'Ολκάϭιν (a play of a kindred character, see the second Argument infra, p. xli).
The transcriber was no doubt misled from thinking of the exclamations of War in lines 243, &c., of this play.
Eustathius, Comment, on Il. x. 249, speaking of the word ἀνει̑ν, says δηλοι̑ τὸ πτίϭϭειν ὡς 'Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν Εἰρήνῃ δηλοι̑.
The word ἀνει̑ν or αἰνει̑ν does not occur in the Peace, but it seems to have been used in the Γεωργοί.
See Bergk's note on Fragm.
ix of the Γεωργοὶ in Meineke's collection.
In the same Commentary, xxiii. 123, Eustathius, explaining the word φι̑τυ, says δηλοι̑ φυτὸν ἢ φύτευμα, ὡς 'Αριϭτοφάάνης ἐν Εἰρήνῃ.
Πόθεν τὸ φι̑τυ;
τί τὸ γένος;
τίς ἡ ϭπορά;
This would seem to be a correct reference to line 1164 of the present Play;
the verse which follows in Eustathius being cited from some other play, the name of which has accidentally dropped out.
In the Commentary on Od. vii. 120, Eustathius says, 'Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν Εἰρήνῃ ϭεμνύνων τὰς 'Αθήνας, μαρτυρει̑ ὡς διηνεκει̑ς ἐκει̑ at ὀπω̑ραι.
This is certainly an error:
Eustathius should have said ἐν ‛'Ωραις, not ἐν Εἰρήνῃ.
‛'Οτι ἐν ται̑ς 'Αθήναις διηνεκει̑ς ἦϭαν αἱ ὀπω̑ραι πα̑ϭαι, μαρτυρει̑ 'Αριϭτοφάνης ἐν ‛'Ωραις, says Athenaeus xiv, chap.
68. See also Id. ix, chap. 14 1. Even Bergk2 admits that this passage cannot be claimed for the second Εἰρήνη.
Indeed, it is simply incredible that Eustathius, who flourished in the twelfth century after Christ, should be familiarly citing under the name of the Peace, that comedy of which the vast research and prodigious learning of Eratosthenes could in the third century before Christ detect no traces whatever.
On the whole, therefore, we must, I think, come to the conclusion that if any such play as the second Εἰρήνη ever existed, it had ceased to exist, at all events under that name, before the time of Eratosthenes, and we have no more materials than be had for deciding what was the exact meaning of that entry in the didascaliae whereby it appeared that Aristopbanes had, on two distinct occasions, exhibited a Comedy under the name of the Peace.
Did he exhibit the same play twice ?
or did he really write a second Play of that name ?
Any answer which we may give to these questions must, of course, be of a purely conjectural character;
but to me it seems extremely im­ probable that the present Play should have been produced on the stage a second time.
It was written for the particular crisis which was occurring in B.C. 421 , and would have lost all its point and piquancy when repeated on any subsequent occasion.
Moreover it did not pretend to any very special merits, was not greatly successful at its first appearance, and bad been made a subject of ridicule by the poet's contemporaries.
On the other hand, it is in no way improbable that Aristophanes should, at some later epoch, have endeavoured to work out in a bappier vein and with improved execution the general conception embodied in this Comedy, omitting the devices which had been censured for their extravagance or impropriety, and adapting the incidents of the drama to the altered circumstances of the times.
And if he retained his Χορὸς γεωργω̑ν, he would be likely enough to have followed his usual practice of naming the Play from the Chorus (as is the case in eight out of his eleven extant comedies), so that the second Εἰρνη would, for distinction's sake, be also called the Γεωργοὶ, or the Farmers.
And since we know that Aristophanes1 did in fact write a comedy under that name, and since the fragments of it which still remain do in fact bear in many points a singularly close resemblance to the Play before us, there is nothing unreasonable in the conjecture (and, of course, it is merely a conjecture) that the Play, which when acted bore the same name as the present, is that which was afterwards called by the distinctive appellation of the Γεωργοί.
Fritzsche, in one 2 of those instructive Aristophanic tracts in which he was accustomed to pour out upon every subject which came in his way a copious flood of learning and acuteness, not always guided by sound judgement, made the following observations on the fourth of the above-mentioned passages:
—" Eustathius de αἴνειν disserens p. 801 δηλοι̑ δὲ TO πτίϭϭειν inquit ὡς 'Αριϭτοφάνη ἐν Εἰρήνῃ δηλοι̑.
Etiam hie locus Brunckii Dindorfiique1 praeclaram diligentiam latuit.
Pertinet ad hexametrum (Pollux x. 187) quern jam Brunckius e Γεωργοι̑ς exemptum esse intellexit Μή μοι 'Αθηναίους αἴειτ' ἢ μολγοὶ ἔϭοναι. — Nimirum jam veteres earn Comici fabulam quae plerumque Γεργοὶ appellatur, Εἰρήνης etiam nomine inscripserunt, Eustathius ipse p. 1291, Crates, Stobaeus, Pollux.
Verissime.
Etenim Γεωργοὶ fabula nihil aliud fuit quam Pads ejus quae aetatem tulit editio altera, id quod mox alibi certis argumentis demonstrabo."
I am not aware that Fritzsche ever resumed this hastily conceived idea, or fulfilled the promise which he made at the close of the foregoing passage.
And Bergk, although in his treatise 2 on the Remains of the Old Comedy he was inclined to adopt the idea, yet subsequently, in his Collection 3 of Aristophanic fragments, treated it as altogether without foundation.
To me it seems in the highest degree improbable that the grammarians in question should have intentionally cited the Γεωργοὶ, as Fritzsche supposes them to have done, under the simple name of the Peace :
I believe that it was by a mere unintentional oversight that the six passages, which we have been considering, were attributed to the Peace, and that the Peace from which they were supposed to come was, in fact, the existing Comedy of that name.
But I think it not unlikely that Aristophanes did write a second Play on the same subject, which was acted under the same name;
but which, long before the time of Eratosthenes, either was altogether lost, or had assumed and was passing under a different title;
and, if the latter view be correct, I know of no play with which we can so reasonably identify it as we can with the Γεωργοί.
Little or nothing has been done, since the commencement of this century, to assist in a right understanding of the Peace of Aristophanes.
The notes of Bothe and Richter, the only two editors who have attempted at any length to explain it, are of very moderate value;
and we are still for all practical purposes left to the old commentaries of Florent Chretien, Bergler, and Brunck.
The Play has, however, largely participated in the general improvement of the Aristophanic text, which resulted from the collation of the Ravenna and Venetian MSS.
In the present edition, the first complete edition of the Peace which has ever been published by an Englishman, I have endeavoured to adhere more closely than has hitherto been done to the reading of those two excellent MSS.
The various readings and conjectures are collected at the end of the Play• whilst in the notes which are subjoined to the text, I have attempted to bring out the purpose and meaning of the poet, to illustrate the historical bearings of the Comedy, and to explain such phrases and passages as seemed to require an explanation, carefully dis­ tinguishing, in every instance, whatever I have borrowed from previous writers.
The translation, though generally literal, is not uniformly so:
it is designed to be readable as a whole, without reference to the original Greek:
and I have not hesitated to sacrifice strict verbal accuracy when­ ever such a course seemed desirable for the carrying out of that primary object.
The translation retains the anapaestic, trochaic, and iambic measures, the heroic hexameters, and the other familiar metres of the original.
And in one instance, vv. 775-818, I have endeavoured to reproduce with exactness a more complicated Choral system, but the attempt was not so successful as to encourage a repetition.
IN 1866, when the first edition of this work was published, no Comedy of Aristophanes had received less attention than the present;
but during the last half-century no Comedy has received more.
Not only have there been twelve editions published, eight by English, and four by foreign, scholars;
there have also been numerous separate dissertations and discussions, principally on the subject of the machinery employed, and the manner in which Trygaeus was transported from the earth to the Palace of Zeus in heaven.
On this subject some very strange theories have been advanced.
That Trygaeus was raised aloft by the machine called the crane, γέρανος, is common ground.
But one contends that after ascending to a certain height he is brought down again to his own house which has meanwhile been transformed into the house of Zeus.
Another conceives that the house of Trygaeus is represented at one end of the stage, and the house of Zeus at the other, and that the crane lifts him up from his own house, swings him through the air and drops him at the house of Zeus.
And others devise other equally strange and wonderful theories.
They all unite in ignoring the ἐξώϭτρα, a machine which seems to play in this Comedy a very similar part to that which it afterwards played in the Thesmophoriazusae.
See the Commentary on Thesm.
277.
In the latter Play the scene at the opening is laid before the house of Agathon, and so it continues until line 276 when by means of the ἐξώϭρα the Thesmophorium is pushed forward, ὠθει̑ται TO ἱερὸν, and fills the entire stage, so that the house of Agathon with the original scene is completely blotted out, and does not reappear throughout the Play.
Here the scene at the opening is laid before the house of Trygaeus and so it continues until line 173 when, Trygaeus having been hoisted up to a height sufficient for the action of the ἐξώϭτρα, a large platform is pushed forward, ὠθει̑ται, underneath him so that he and his beetle at once find themselves resting upon it.
This platform fills the entire stage, so that the house of Trygaeus with the original scene is completely blotted out, and does not reappear until after the Parabasis, when by the action of the ἐξώϭτρα the platform is drawn in again, and the original house and scene become visible once more.
The exclamation of Trygaeus to the μηχανοποιὸς, line 174, is occasioned by the action not of the crane, but of the ἐξώϭτρα, the sudden protrusion of the great platform just underneath him being enough to alarm the most courageous man and beetle.
This platform or upper stage, as it may be convenient to call it, is, as in the Thesmophoriazusae, of exactly similar dimensions to the original or lower stage, and has for its background the Palace of Zeus.
Trygaeus and his beetle therefore, so soon as they rest upon it, are immediately in front of the Palace-doors, out of which come, first Hermes, and then War and his attendant.
Henceforth, until the Parabasis, the action of the Play proceeds on this upper stage, and the original scene with the house of Trygaeus is alike out of sight and out of mind.
It is here that War is preparing to pound all the Hellenic cities in his mighty mortar;
here is the pit into which Peace has been cast;
and out of which the Chorus, with the aid of Trygaeus and Hermes, at length succeed in bringing her once more to sight.
The Chorus is composed exclusively of Attic (possibly even of Athmonian) farmers;
for the notion that the Argives, Boeotians, Megarians, and Lamachus who are in turn upbraided for not giving due assistance to the work are actually represented in the theatre, either as forming part of the Chorus or as supernumeraries, is altogether fanciful and inadmissible.
These farmers must pull by means of ropes falling from the upper stage to the orchestra, if indeed they really pull at all and are not rather here, as elsewhere, substituting for real action mere dancing and gesticulation in the orchestra
1- But somehow or other Peace reappears, accompanied by her two handmaidens, Harvesthome and Mayfair.
The two handmaidens are represented by Choregic actors, and just as the Parabasis is about to commence they depart with Trygaeus by the masked staircase into the interior of the theatre, reappearing with him, when the Parabasis is over, on the lower stage.
It must be remembered that Trygaeus does not descend directly from the upper to the lower stage;
it would indeed have been impossible for him to do so.
Peace is not represented by any actor;
she is merely a colossal statue, and it seems as though only her head and bust1 appear above the upper stage.
No remarks are made upon her person as upon those of Harvesthome and Mayfair;
and her lips could not have approached the ear of Hermes had she and he been standing on the same level.
Trygaeus had ascended from the lower to the upper stage by means of his beetle, and it is no wonder that he cannot tell how he is to descend again;
but instructed by Hermes, he finds a staircase which takes him into the interior of the theatre, behind the scenes.
Speaking generally, the actors confine themselves to the stage, and the Chorus to the orchestra.
But in the preceding Comedy, the Wasps, Aristophanes did what no man had ever done before (του̑το οὐδείς πω πάρος δέδρακεν) by making his protagonist descend into the orchestra, and lead out the Chorus, dancing, at the ending of the Play."
And in the present Comedy he seems to have introduced the converse novelty by making the Chorus ascend to the stage and carry out the protagonist and his bride at the ending of the Play.
One Semichorus seems to have left the orchestra after line 1316, and to reappear after line 1328 carrying Harvesthome from the house into which she had entered (after line 855) for the purpose of taking her bridal-bath.
The other after line 1340 climbs up to the stage and raises Trygaeus aloft, the two processions finally leaving the theatre side by side for the nuptial festivities.
I observed in the original Introduction that the Play abounded with genuine kindly Panhellenic sentiments, occasionally rising, amidst all the burlesque with which they are surrounded, into a strain of almost solemn and pathetic dignity, as in that beautiful address to Peace which may be called the Consecration Hymn."
But this point is brought out more fully and more clearly by Mr. Sharpley in the Introduction to his ex­ cellent edition of the Peace, from which I take the liberty of borrowing the remarks which follow :
—"
The poet makes it plain from the first that the mission of Trygaeus is undertaken on behalf of all the Greeks, ὑπὲρ 'Ελλήνων πάντων (93), 'Ελλήνων περὶ ἁπαξαπντων (105).
Prayers for the future and regrets for the past alike have regard to Hellas, not to Athens.
Thus in line 435 we find in 1320 and in 646 ἡ δ' 'Ελλὰς av I ἐξερημωθει̑ϭ' ἂν ὑμα̑ς ἔλαθε.
In line 292 when the Chorus are summoned, the call is ὦνδρες "Ελληνες, altered ten lines below to the more expressive and sentimental address ὦ Πανέλληνες-a word sadly rare in our extant Greek literature.
But the climax of lofty patriotism is reached in that wonderful cry, -words which, in a different key, breathe the spirit of Panhellenism as nobly as does the Aeschylean battle-cry at Salamis.
"No poetical translation of the Peace had been published previously to the year 1866;
but since then we have had (1) a translation by Leonard Hampson Rudd in 1867;
(2) a translation of considerable parts of the Play by the Right Honourable John Hookham Frere, published in 1872 after Mr. Frere's death;
and (3) a very lively and enjoyable translation published in 1910 by Mr. R. F. Patterson.
In the Commentary, as now arranged, the notes which are new are distinguished from those which are old by being placed in brackets ( 〉1.
This has been done for several reasons:
(1) Many remarks which were strictly accurate in 1866 would not be accurate now.
To take one example.
It is stated in the note on line 153 that "all the Commentators" take βουκολήϭι in the sense of ἐξαπατήϭεται.
They had in fact all done so up to that time, but many if not "most of the subsequent Commentators share the view put forward in that note.
It seemed therefore desirable to make it clear that the statement in question belongs to the edition of 1866 and not to that of 1912.
(2) Again, subsequent Commentators have frequently arrived at the same conclusions as those which were advocated in the previous edition, and have naturally expressed them in very similar language.
I have always tried to be scrupulously honest in acknowledging my obligations to my predecessors, but if it were supposed that those conclusions were advocated in this edition for the first time, I might seem to have borrowed without acknowledgement from Commentaries which in reality were sub­ sequent to my own.
(3) Some of the remarks in the earlier edition have been very strangely, though of course quite unintentionally, misstated.
Here again I will give one example.
In my note on line 1014 τα̑ς ἐν τεύτλοιϭι λοχευομένας I said "
In the Medea of Melanthius, from which this and the preceding line are borrowed, the phrase may have been τα̑ς ἐν Κόλχοιϭι λοχευομένας."
That is all.
But Herwerden in his note on the passage after giving his own view proceeds to say "Postea vidi Rogersium conjecisse personatum Creontem dixisse;
ἀποχηρωθεὶς ras ἐν Κόλχοιϭι λοχευομένας.
Sed enim nec aptum foret participium praesens pro praeterito, nec Creon hercle Medeam, quam ob interfectos et liberos et recens nuptam Creusam pessime oderat, potuit desiderare."
Herwerden mentions that he had been unable to obtain my edition, and, apparently, his only knowledge of it was derived from the friendly quotations in Mr. Paley's notes.
But neither in my notes nor in Paley's is there the slightest justification for the remark that the words are conjectured to have been spoken by Creon.
It never occurred to me to consider who the speaker may have been, or even what was the special subject of the " Medea " of Melanthius;
it may have turned on incidents totally distinct from those of the " Medea " of Euripides, for there was more than one tragedy in the life of Medea.
I should not like it to be supposed that I made so ridiculous a suggestion in the earlier edition and suppressed it in the present, possibly, it might be conjectured, in consequence of Herwerden's criticism.
The same distinction between what is old and what is new is made in the notes to the first and second Greek Arguments;
but it did not seem necessary to extend it to the Appendix.

The Ravenna MS. gives no list of the Dramatis Personae.
In the Venetian they areThe scene, at the opening of the Play, represents the exterior of the house of Trygaeus, two of whose servants are visible in the foreground, ministering to the wants of an enormous dung-beetle, which is confined in one of the outer courts, the walls of the court being sum­ ciently high to conceal its inmate from the audience.
Δύα δέ εἰσιν οἰκέται, says the Scholiast, ὧν ὁ μὲν τρέΦει τὸν κάνθαρ
ον, o δὲ ἔτερος μάττει.
And Dobree has re­ distributed the opening dialogue, so as to bring it into accordance with the view that one servant prepares the food, the other gives it to the beetle.
But his arrangement, though adopted with more or less variation by all the recent editors, is throughout forced and unsatisfactory.
And lines 23 (κανθάρῳ μάττοντa παρέχειν έσθίειν) and 27 (ἢν μὴ παραθῶ τρίψας) seem of themselves sufficient to show that no such division of labour, as that which he supposed the Scholiast to suggest, was really intended by Aristophanes.
The whole manual work is performed by the second servant;
the first merely directs and superintends the operation, as the steward or confidential servant of Try­ gaeus.
In that capacity he remains throughout the greater part of the Play at his master's house, whilst the second servant, after feeding the beetle, quits the stage and is seen no more.
I have therefore, throughout the dialogue, re­ stored the traditional arrangement, which seems to me preferable in every respect.5.

τοῖν ποδοῖν]
All insects have six legs ;
but, as the Scholiast remarks, Aristophanes employs the dual in refer­ ence to the feet of the coleopter here, as he did with regard to those of the flea in the Clouds, 150.
There is in Wood's Natural History, iii. 468, a pleasantly written sketch of the modus operandi of certain of these dung-beetles, from which it would seem that the dual is not alto­ gether misapplied in describing the manner in which they roll the substance which is at once their food, their resi­ dence, and their nest.
"Every one who has walked in the fields must have noticed the singular rapidity with which patches of cowdung disappear, and many may have observed that this phenomenon is caused by the efforts of sundry beetles which burrow beneath the mass, and convey the substance deep into the ground.
The common watchman-beetle (Geotrupes stercorarius), so well known from its habit of flying on droning wings in the evening, is one of these valuable beetles;
and it is worthy of notice that, despite the nature of the substance in which they work, not a speck adheres to their bright and polished armour.
The Egyptian beetle (Scarabaeus sacer) employs a similar substance for the cradle of its future young, kneading it into irregular balls, in which it deposits its eggs, and then rolling it away by means of its odd-looking hind legs.
After it has made the ball, which is often larger than itself, the beetle sets to work to roll it to a convenient spot where the earth is soft, and performs this curious operation by a retrograde motion, the hind legs directing the ball, while the four other legs are employed in locomo­ tion.
During this operation the beetle seems to be standing on its head, the hind legs being much elevated, in order to guide the ball, which by dint of much rolling becomes nearly spherical.
A tolerably deep hole is then excavated in a suitable spot, the ball rolled into it, and the earth filled in.
Many beetles perform this useful operation, and in several European countries, where the beauty of the climate is only equalled by the uncleanliness of the inhabitants, these beetles are of inestimable service."
A similar account is given in Kirby and Spence's Entomology, Letter ix;
and for the observations of ancient natural­ ists see Aristotle, Hist. An. v. 17. 10 (ed Schneider) ;

Horace, Sat. i. 3. 80;
Juvenal ix. 5.)17. ὑπερέχιν τῆς ἀντλίας]
This ex­ pression is elsewhere used of sailors endeavouring to keep down the water in a sinking ship.
See the passages cited by Hemsterhuys (on Lucian's Ti­ mon 4), who thinks that, as in nautical language the phrase would mean "unable to work the ἀντλίαν" (in its sense of bilgewater) " sufficiently for the needs of the vessel," so here it must mean " unable to work the ἀντλίαν" " (in its sense of filth) " sufficiently for the needs of the beetle."
Brunck and Richter, who impute to Hemsterhuys the absurdity of supposing the beetle itself to be spoken of as τὴν ἀντλίαν, must strangely have misread the observations of that sagacious and admirable writer.
But I think that the interpretation of the Scholiast—ὑπερέχειν ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀντέχειν Kat περιγίνεσθαι τῆς ὀσμῆς-is on the whole the preferable one, and that the meaning simply is that, as in a sinking ship the bilgewater gets the mastery over the sailors, so here the stench is too strong for, and is overpowering the servant.
(In nautical language ἀντλία signifies either the bilgewater itself or the hold of the ship which contains it.
So here, by analogy :
in this line it signifies the filth, and in the next the tub, σκάφη, containing the filth.) ἄλη τῆ δυνάμει ἁ κάνθαρας, φησὶν, έσθίει κινούμενας.

The name ἁλκάδες is of course derived from their being towed (ἒλκω) with ropes.

and Bergler cites from Synesius, Epist. 57, and Antiphon, Tetr. B. y. 8, the phrases δαιμόνων προσ- (βολὰς, τὰς θείας προσβολὰς, in the same signification.
But the main, if not the only, meaning of the word in the pre­ sent passage seems to be an appendage, an adjunct, o προσβάλλεται, a sign speci­ fically appropriated or attached to a deity;
and so it is interpreted by Brunck, who compares the use of the word προσ­ νείμασθαι in Birds 563.42.
Διὸς Σκαταιβάτου]
(The words are a play upon a very common appellation of Zeus, Αιὸς Καταιβάτου, Zeus descending in thunder, Pollux ix. 41 ;
Pausanias v. 14. 8. In Lycophron's Cassandra 1370 Agamemnon is likened to ZeusIt was part of the insane adulation ex­ hibited by the Athenians towards Demetrius Poliorcetes that, treating him as a Divine being, they erected on the spot where he first descended from his chariot an altar Δημητρίου Καταιβάτου.
In the Prometheus (367) the falling thunderbolt is described as καταιβάτης κερουνός.
And in the present line the reading of the MSS.
and editions gener­ ally is Διὸς Καταιβάτου, a reading which made the passage unmeaning, for the four lines from χὤτου ποτ'are obviously intend­ ed to lead up to a telling joke, and no joke was forthcoming.
But the Ravenna MS. has a letter (which can hardly have been anything but a-) erased before καταιβάτου, and the Ravenna scholiast says παίζει σκαταιβάτην αὺτὸν καλῶν erret σκάτοις τρέφεται ὁ κάνθαρος, showing that he read Σκαταιβάτου a reading adopted by the three most recent editors, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and Graves.)46. 'Ιωνικός]
It must be remembered that this Play was performed at the great City Dionysia, in the presence of the allies and strangers from all parts of the Hellenic world.
(The poet puts the answer to the youngster's question into the mouth of one of the allies because he loves to introduce a few words in a non-Attic dialect, which doubtless, as pronounced by the actor, would produce a certain comic effect.
There is hardly an extant Play in which some such words are not found;
and cf. infra 836.

to the beetle if contrasted with Κλέωνα in the preceding line, to Cleon if contrasted with o κάνθαρ
ος two lines before.
Opinions differ widely on this point;
but in my judgement it refers to the beetle.
The beetle eating the muck reminds the speaker of Clean who was a σκατοφάγος, a muck eater;
διοβάλλει τὸν Κλέωνα ως σκατοφάγον as the Scholiast says.
We know that in Menander's time, and we may well believe that already in the days of Aristophanes, the epithet σκατοφάγος, like τοιχωρύχος, ἱερόσυλος, and similar words, was employed as a mere term of abuse without the slightest refer­ ence to its original signification.
Thus in Menander's Samia 348 (ed. Capps) (where it is said of a hotheaded fellow τραχὺς ἅνθρωπος, σκατοφάγος, αὐθέκαστος τᾳ̑ τρόπῳ), in the same writer's Περικει­ ρομένη 274, in the line quoted from Menander by Photius s. v. (ἁλλὰ σκατο­ φάγος ἐστὶ καὶ λίον πικρὸς), and in the metrical Argument of the Knights (where the epithet is applied to the Sausage- seller), it means merely "a blackguard," "a ruffian."
Cleon, being a σκατοΦάγος in this sense, is caricatured, it is sug­ gested, by the beetle, a σκατοΦάγος in the literal sense of the word.)50. τὸν λόγον]

He is referring, says the Scholiast, not to the war-mania, but to the μονίαν δικανικήν.
And this seems right, for there are many passages in the present Play which show that the mind of Aristophanes had not yet lost the impressions and ideas of which itwas full, when, in the preceding year, he wrote his comedy of the Wasps.νσι.—Scholiast.
The imprecation had not been found in any of Menander's Plays until the recent discovery of an important fragment of his Γεωργὸς (see Menander's Γεωργὸς, by Grenfell and Hunt, Oxford, 1898).
There a slave, coming from the country, says that he has brought some good news, but the beginning of his story is a bit of bad news, and one of the women to whomAnd to the great and mighty men among you, And to the greatest mightiest men of all.
My masters mad;
a novel kind of madness, Not your old style, but quite a new invention.
For all day long he gazes at the sky, His mouth wide open, thus;
and rails at Zeus :

Lay down thy besom, sweep not Hellas bare !

Ah me !
Ah me !
SERVo Hush !

What wouldest thou with our people ?
Thou wilt drain
The lifeblood from our cities ere thou knowest!
SERVo Aye, there it is;
that's just what I was saying :
Ye hear yourselves a sample of his ravings.
But what he did when first the frenzy seized him I'll tell you:
he kept muttering to himself, Oh if I could but somehow get to Zeus !
With that he got thin scaling ladders made, And tried by them to scramble up to heaven, Till he came tumbling down, and cracked his skull.
Then yesterday he stole I know not whither,he is speaking exclaimsΤαὺς κόκκους ἐκβαλλαυσῶν.—Scholiast.
See the Commentary on Lys. 364.)
The same derivation is given by the Et. Magn. and (with others) by Suidas.
And all the grammarians agree as to the exact meaning of the word, one illustrating it by the action of a monkey climbing up the boughs of a tree, and another by bees swarming up the stem of a plant.
Perhaps the best explanation is ἀναρρι­ χᾶσθαι σημαίνει τὸ ταῖς πασὶ καὶ ταῖς χερσὶν ἀντεχόμενον ἀναβαίνειν.
See Pier­ son at Moeris s. v. and Boissonade at Aristaenetus i. 3 and 20.)73. Αἰτναῖον]
The Scholiasts offer three interpretations of this word :
either (1) that it means ὑπερμεγέθη· μέγιστον γὰρ ὄρ
ος ἡ Αἴτνη :
or (2) that it refers to the breed of Aetnaean horses (Soph. Oed. Col. 312) :
or (3) that there was in fact some species of large beetle called theAetnaean, probably from being found in the neigh­ bourhoodof thatmountain.
Thepassages which they cite from Epicharmus, Aes­ chylus, Sophocles, and Plato Comicus are conclusive in favour of the third in­ terpretation.
The fragment cited from Plato is arranged by Meineke (Fragni. Corn. ii. 624) as follows :
θεῖν) " ἄγ᾽, ὦ φίλον μοι Πηγάσου πτερόν.”— Scholiast.
The flight of Trygaeus heaven­ wards on his winged beetle is throughoutAnd brought a huge Aetnaean beetle home, And made me groom it, while he coaxed it down Like a young favourite colt, and kept on saying, Wee Pegasus, my flying thoroughbred, Your wings must waft me straight away to Zeus !

intended to parody the flight of Belle­ rophon heavenwards, in the Euripidean Tragedy, on his winged steed.
And the present line discloses to the spectators the burlesque which they are about to witness.
Aristophanes had already ad­ verted to this Bellerophon flight in the preceding Comedy, Wasps 757;
and the hero's distressful appearance after he had been thrown by Pegasus is the subject of a joke in Acharnians 427.
See also infra 722 and Knights 1249.
The somewhat affected phrase Πηγάσου πτερὸν is reproduced infra 135.)80. μετέωρ

The servant throws open the doors, and Trygaeus is discovered sitting astride upon the beetle, which is just preparing to fly.

ος αἴρεται, says the Scholiast, ἐπὶ μηχανῆς· τοῦτο δὲ καλεῖται ἐώρημα.
They rise during the anapaestic systems, halting during the intermediate dialogues.
In addressing the beetle, info 82, Trygaeus substitutes for κάνθαρος, a word of not dissimilar sound, κάνθων, a jackass.97. ὀλολύζειν]

The further explanation of Hesychius ot δὲ τόπους πρὸς ὑποχώρησιν ἀνειμένους is probably due to the usage of the word in this Comedy.)108. Μήδοισιν]
Doubtless there were many beginning to feel that the inter­ necine dissensions of the Hellenic cities would prove of advantage to their ever­ watchful neighbour, the great Eastern monarchy only.
The repetition of this suggestion, info 408, seems to show that the mind of Aristophanes, at all events, was growing uneasy on this score.
And compare Lysistrata 1133-4.
The Lace­ daemonians had already sent frequent em­ bassies (Thuc.iv. 50) inviting the Persians to intervene in the affairs of Hellas;
and, apart from the Panhellenic danger, the Athenians might well feel anxious at the prospect of having the wealth and the ma­ ritime resources of the empire thrown into the opposite scale.
With regard to their remedy by indictment, " notantur Athenienses ut φιλόδικοι,” says Bergler after the Scholiast, " si nec Jupiter est securus.
”114. ἔτυμος φάτις]
The Scholiast pre­ serves some lines from the Aeolus of Euri­ pides, from which these dactylics seem to be parodied;
for so, I suppose, should the fragment be arranged.
ἔστι for πάρεστι, it is open to you to conjecture.117.

This familiar impre­ cation is converted into a similar joke, in Birds 28.
There two wayfarers are vainly endeavouring to penetrate to the king­ dom of the birds, and'' 'tis hard indeed," says Euelpides, " that when we are ready and willing ἐς κόρακας ἐλθεῖν, we cannot find the way.

(The κολλύρα (Athe­ naeus iii. 75) was a circular cake dressed in a rich thick broth or sauce ὄψον in αὐτῇ, the sauce being, in the opinion of epicures, the most important part of the dish :

To ride on it to heaven, Papa, Papa ?
TRYG.
It is the only living thing with wings,Such a sauce (σκευασία ὀψοποιικὴ, Photius s. v. κάνδυλος) was the κάνδαυλος, a Lydian dainty made in a variety of ways, Photius 1. c.;
Athenaeus xii. 12.
It was a sort of rich porridge, strengthened with boiled meat, cheese, honey, breadcrumbs, and the like.
Trygaeus, for κάνδαυλος, pro­ poses to substitute κόνδυλος, knuckle­ broth.)
Wordsworth (Athens andAttica, chap. 35) mentions that a circular cake is still called in modern Greek κουλοῦρι.126.
πτηνὸς πορεύσει]
(The Scholiast quotes some lines from the Stheneboea of Euripides, which appear to end with these words, though it is just possible that they may form no part of the quota­ tion.
If they do form a part of it, there is great force in Wagner's suggestion (Stheneboea Frag. 5) that the whole of the present line is borrowed from that Tragedy;
ναυσθλοῦσθαι, acorrupt form of ναυστολεῖσθαι, being rather a favourite word of Euripides.)129. Αἰσώπου]
The Scholiast explains the fable thus :
The eagle had carried off the young beetles;
thereupon the old beetle got into the eagle's eyry, and pushed out her eggs.
The eagle flew to complain to Zeus, who bade her build her nest in his own bosom.
But, when the eagle had laid her eggs there, the beetle flew buzzing about the ears of Zeus ;
and he, springing up to scare it away, dropped and broke the eggs.
The moral, says the Scholiast, is that there is no rest for the wicked, no, not even in the bosom of Zeus.
It is said that the apologue was told by Aesop to the Delphians, as they were about to put him to death on a false charge of theft;
his motive being to warn them that though he might be mean as the beetle, and they exalted as the eagle, yet his blood might ascend to heaven, and cry for vengeance upon his murderers.
This, too, is the fable which Philocleon endea­ vours to edge in, as he is being carried shrieking from the stage.
-Wasps 1446-8. See the Scholiasts there, and see Lys. 695.
It is versified by Spenser in his fourth Sonnet on the World's Vanity, and illustrated by Erasmus in his celebrated Adage (to which Bergler refers) Scarabaeus aquilam quaerit, which is found in vol. ii, p. 686 of the Leyden edition of his works, and of which the most pointed and bitter passages are translated in Hallam's Literature, chap.
iv.
〈It was this fable too which (in Lucian's Icaro-menippus) inspired Me­ nippus to soar on eagle and vulture wings to heaven ;
and to him also, as to Try­ gaeus here, the gate, when he knocks at it, is opened by Hermes as the lackey of Zeus.)
As the beetle merely followed the eagle to heaven, it is difficult to see with what propriety it is termed μόνος πετεινῶν εὶς θεοὺς ἀφιγμένος.131.
ἄπιστον εἶπας μῦθον]
These words are borrowed, as Bergler observes, from Eurip.
Iph.
Taur. 1293.
They are very appropriate here;
for μῦθος is a term more applicable even than λόγος to an Aesopian fable.

that he had, during his confinement in the Athenian prison, turned into verse the μῦθοι of Aesop, because he wished before his death to act in obedience to a heavenly vision, which often in his past life had enjoined him μουσικὴν ποιεῖν, and it seemed a poet's business ποιεῖν μύθους, ἀλλ᾿ οὐ λόγους.
(Here both words are used of Aesop's fables, but more frequently they are contrasted, μυ̂θος being taken to mean a fiction and λόγος a fact.

4) says that Daph­ nis and Chloe were delighted to hear of love, ὥσπερ μῦθον, οὐ λόγον, ἀκούοντες.

(This is the Euripidean phrase quoted by the Scholiast on line 76 supra.)Scholiast.
That κάνθαρ
ος is the name of a particular kind of ship, says Athenaeus, xi. 47, is κοινὸν, matter of common notoriety.
And in the next chapter he cites several passages which illustrate this and other meanings of the word.
(The name was probably given to the vessel from something in its shape and appearance which made it, with the oars reaching out on each side, bear a certain resemblance to a monstrous beetle.
It seems to have been originally invented at Naxos, which had a large seafaring population, and, in early times, many ships of war (πλοῖα μακρὰ πολλὰ, Hdt. v. 30).
And very probably, even when made or used by other people, it would retain the name of its origin, to distin- guish it from other kinds of κάνθαροι, the insect, the cup, the womanly ornament, &c.〉
As to πηδάλιον in the preceding line we must, I suppose, accept the Scholiast's interpretation, τὸ αἰδοῖον δείκνυσι, that is the penem scorteum.
145.
Πειραεῑ]
Peiraeus, says Thucy­ dides, i. 93, is possessed of λιμένας τρεῖς αὐτοφυεῖς.
Of these, one was called, as the Scholiast here informs us, Cantharus, from a traditionary hero of that name.
Another, he says, was called Aphro­ disium, and we learn from Hesychius and other authorities that the name of the third was Zea.
And see Colonel Leake's Topography of Athens, i. 373.147. χωλός]
Not only was Euripides noted as a χωλοποιὸς, an introducer of maimed and limping heroes, in general, see Acharnians and Frogs, passim ;
but one of his most celebrated representa­ tions in that line was Bellerophon lamed by a fall from Pegasus, Ach. 427. And as the whole of this beetle-flight is a sort of travestie of the Bellerophon of Euri­ pides, to Trygaeus, in a special manner, exemplum grave praebet ales Pegasus, terrenum equitem gravatus Bellerophontem.

signification, and which are collected by Bp. Blomf., Gloss, in Ag. 652, ἐβουκο­ λοῦμεν φραντίσιν νέαν πάθος, are widely different from the present.
And even were authority produced to show (1) that βαυκολεῖν, standing alone, can mean "to deceive a person" ;
and (2) that βουκαλήσομαι can be employed in a purely active signification (as to both of which points I must, in the absence of authority, entertain great doubt), yet the ordinary meaning of the word, "to feed oneself," " to turn to graze," seems to me not only preferable, but absolutely required by the context.
The με is to be joined, not with βουκαλήσεται, but with ῥίψας.155. χρυσοχάλινον] (golden-bitted.
χρυσοχάλινον πάταγαν, the clashing of golden bits.
The Scholiast quotes from the Bellerophon, ἴθι χρυσαχάλιν᾽ αἴρων πτέρυγας.
Euripides therefore applied the epithet to the horse, as do Hdt. (ix. 20) and Xenophon (Cyr. i. 3. 3).
And so St. Chrysostom (Horn. xxi in 1 Cor. p. 189 C) speaks of ἵππων χρυσο­ χαλίνων.
It is only by a sort of Aeschylean licence that Aristophanes transfers the epithet to the clanging of the curbs.)156. φαιδραîς ὠσίν]
The word φαιδρὰς, as applied to a horse's ears, is susceptible of two very different significations :
(1), from the idea of brightness, quickness, alertness, attached to the word, φαιδροῖς ὠσὶ may mean arrectis auribus, micans auribus;
(2), from its sense of placid, beaming, sleek good nature, it may mean blandis auribus.
Every commentator adopts the former interpretation ;
the Scholiast prefers the latter.
Πραέσι, μὴδρόμον (rather, perhaps, ἀκρατῆ " when about to run away ").
Florent Chretien and Bothe will not permit the Scholiast to know his own mind, the former cor­ rectinghis comment into ὀρθοῖς, μὴπραέσι;
the latter into πραέσιν ἢ ὀρθοῖς.
But in my opinion the Scholiast is quite right;
and Trygaeus is desiring in his steed a sign not of spirit, but of good temper.
These lines and those which follow (159- 61) seem borrowed from the Bellero­ phon of Euripides, probably from the same monody which Philocleon quotes in Wasps 757, &c.
In fact the chief humour of these anapaests consists in the inter- mixture by Trygaeus of snatches from that tragedy with ejaculations supposed to be wrung from him by the imminent danger of his own situation.165.

ἡ πόλις ή Χίων]
〈Dobree refers to the story told in Plutarch's " Anony­ mous Laconian Apophthegms,” No. 11.
Some persons had messed about the Ephors' Hall and over the Ephors' seats.
The indignation which the Ephors naturally felt at this outrage was some­ what appeased when they discovered that the offenders were Chians, for any disgusting act, they declared, was to be expected from Chians.
From this, or from some similar circumstance, there seems to have arisen a popular saying, Xȋος ἦν o ἀποπατω̑ν, It was a Chian who made the mess.
Trygaeus therefore assumes that Xȋος ἦν o ἀποπατω̑ν in the Peiraeus, and threatens to impose a heavy fine upon the culprit's city, or rather on the State to which he belonged.
Of.. infra 251 and Eur. Ion 294.)173. οἴμ’ ὡς δέδοικα]
As Trygaeus and his beetle are still floating in the air the scene suddenly changes, and they find themselves at the celestial abodes.
A platform or movable stage is thrust out exactly underneath the beetle, who thenceforth rests upon it.
The actor, half dropping his assumed character, turns from the imaginary perils of Try­ gaeus, to what he affects to consider his own real personal danger from the move­ ments of the theatrical machinery (οὐκέτι σκώπτων λέγω, "I'm in sober earnest now," cf. Plato, Rep. i. 20, p. 349 A). " Jocus est comicis antiquis solennis," says Person, Suppl. Praef. Hec.," ut acto­ rem personae, quam agit, oblivisci faci­ ant, et de theatre aut spectatoribus quasi imprudentem loqui."
From this point to the Parabasis the action is wholly on this higher stage, the scene representing the exterior of the palace of Zeus.
In front is a pit or cavern, blocked up with large stones, masking a secret flight of stairs which lead to the interior of the theatre.
Trygaeus dismounts, and shouts to the porter in the customary manner.
(The upper stage now pushed forward by the ἐξώστρα was probably a fabric of exactly the same size as the lower stage, so that it completely hides the house of Try­ gaeus and the original scenery, which are visible no more until after the Para basis ;
just as in the Thesmophoriazusae when the Temple is pushed forward by the ἐξώστρα, it completely hides the house of Agathon and the original scenery, which are seen no more during the remainder of the Play.

And I may observe that the dialogue called the Halcyon, inserted amongst Lucian's works, commences with the words, Τίς ἡ ΦΩΝΗ ΠΡΟΣΕΒΑΛΕΝ ἡμȋν;
But perhaps the poet purposely left it indefinite, and Hermes is merely meant to say that he is aware of the presence of man.
He appeals to Heracles, because the great destroyer of monsters is naturally in­ voked at the sight of some strange apparition— ̉Ω ‛Ηράκλεις, ταυτὶ ποδαπὰ τὰ θηρία;
Ach. 94;
Clouds 184 ;

Eccl. 1068, and elsewhere.
On the other hand the invocation of Heracles in Ach.
807, οἷον ῥοθιάζουσ’, & πολυτίμηθ’‛Ηρά­ κλεις, is in recognition of his traditional voracity.182. & μιαρέ]
Hermes is probably in­ tended as a sample of the footmen in the houses of the great at Athens, abusive at first, but soon subsiding into friendliness on the appearance of a bribe.
With this torrent of abuse compare the reception of Dionysus by the porter of Pluto, Frogs 465.
〈
There Dionysus was frightened out of his wits by the violent language used, but here Trygaeus is quite unmoved, and even proceeds to chaff Hermes who was never a very formidable personage, and who was always open to a bribe.
Try­ gaeus knows that he has with him more than one gift (infra 192, 424) sufficient to appease the wrath of Hermes.

In the second year of the war the combined pressure of the invasion and the pestilence was too much for the resolution of the Athenian people, and they sent ambas­ sadors to Sparta to endeavour to obtain a peace, but without success ;

Five years later the tide of fortune had changed, and was setting strongly in favour of Athens, and it was then the turn of the Laconians to ask for peace, and of the Atticans to re-As high as they can go;

War enters, bearing a gigantic mortar, in which he is about to make a salad, μυττωτὰν, info 247, 273 (or as we might say, to make mincemeat), of the Hellenic cities.
Now the full ingre­ dients of a μυττωτὸς, as described by the Scholiast on Knights 771, are cheese, garlic, egg, oil, and leek (κατασκευάζεται δὲ ἀπὸτυρου̑καὶσκορόδυκαὶ ὠ̩ου̑καὶἐλαίου καὶ πράσοω), sweetened, no doubt, with an admixture of honey.
Instead of leek (πράσον), War throwsin the homonymous Laconian town of Prasiae ;
for garlic he takes Megara, the great garlic-producing country;

Reiske says, " Scilicet ἱέμενος, qui ad affligenda, con­ fringenda crura tendit."
Brunck, "Sup­ plendum videtur earns, βεβηκὼς, vel simile quid."
And others refer it to the manner in which War was represented on the stage.
But it is clear that the phrase must refer, not to the representa­ tion, but to that which is represented, the dreadful War ὃνΦεύγομεν. "
Is this really and truly," says Trygaeus, "the terrible War κατὰ τοȋν σκελοȋν?”
It is conceivable that as the other epithets are appropriated from Lamachus, this also may have some reference to him.
But I rather believe it to be a parody of some existing description of War.
In the famous stanza, in which Horace speaks of death in battle (Od. iii. 2. 13)—
Dulce at decorum est pro patria mori;
Mors et fugacem persequitur virum, Nec parcit imbellis juventae Poplitibus timidove tergo, we know that the second line was bor­ rowed from Simonides (Stobaeus Anth. 118. 6) (6 8'αὖ Θάνατος ἔκιχε καὶ τὸν Φυγόμα-La­ χον), and whatmore probablethan thatthe succeeding lines also should be of Greek origin, and that Aristophanes should here be referring to the description from which they were taken ?
With the general turn of the expression, compare the inscription composed by Simonides for the statue of Pan (Fragm. 25, Gaisf.) τὸν τραγόπουν ἐμὲ nava, TOP ’Αρκάδα, TOP Kara Μήδων, κ.τ.λ.242.

Excluded for more than ten years from all markets throughout the Athenian empire, with the Athenian armies twice every year overrunning their territory, and ‟ grubbing up by the very roots'' their agricultural produce (see Ach. 750-63), with an Athenian garrison occupying their port of Nisaea and threatening the city itself, the Megarians were in truth reduced to such utter misery and destitution, that it seemed more than likely that they would be actually "worn and torn to pieces " by a prolongation of the war.
But here they are introduced to typify the garlic for which they had once been renowned throughout Hellas.
See Acharn.

That garlic was one of the principal ingredients of a Greek salad we see also from Acharn.

"Will she not come and help him to make his cheese ?” (66). " Your whey-face," says Doris, spitefully, to the same Galateain the first of Lucian's Sea-Dialogues, " is all that your Cyclops lover can see to admire in you;
it reminds him of his own beloved cheese and curds.

The MSS.
give this line to War, but I had ventured to assign it to Trygaeus, even before I had observed that a similar suggestion had been made by Dobree, adopted by Bergk, and approved (though not adopted) by Dindorf and Holden.
It is not to be supposed that Trygaeus would allow any ingredient to be poured in, without some comment of his own.
No allusion is here in­ tended, as Paulmier would have us believe, to the troubles of Leontini five years before (Thuc. iii. 86).
The poet is speaking of the Future, not of the Past;
of the misfortunes which, unless averted by the return of Peace, would fall upon the Hellenic world.
If there is any allusion to actual events, it would be to the troubles which, notwithstanding the general pacification of B. c. 424, were just recommencing in Sicily (Thuc. v. 4),
But I believe that the poet is not referring to any historical fact at all;
he is merely selecting, from the area over which the war extended, such cities as most aptly represent the ingredients of his salad.
That grated cheese was one of these ingredients we learn too from Knights 771 κατακνησθείην ἐν μυττωτῷμετὰτυρου̑. (He is, however, possibly anticipating that Sicily will be drawn into the vortex of the War, as it was shortly afterwards.
)252. TO PEAL τἀττικόν]
The honey of Attica was proverbial for its excellence.
" Sweet as Attic honey " is the passion­ ate encomium bestowed by the Scythian in Thesm.
1192, upon the maiden's kiss.
Nor has it altogether lost its pre-emi­ nence, even in modern days.
The ‟murmuring of innumerable bees is still heard amongst the fragrant thyme of " sweet Hymettus " ;
and no honey is esteemed of so exquisite a flavour as that which is there produced.
Sir George Wheler, who visited Attica about A.D. 1676, and who gives in the sixth book of his Travels a detailed account of the processes adopted by the Hymettian bee-keepers, describes their honey as of a good consistence, and of a fair gold colour.
He says that " the same quantity sweetens more water than the like quantity of any other doth " ;
and that it is in such request, and fetches so high a price in Constantinople, where it is used for the purpose of sweetening sherbet, that all the honey in the neigh­ bourhood of Hymettus is brought to be stamped with the mark of a monastery there, that it may pass as the genuine Hymettian honey.
See also the second letter of Mr. Brace bridge in the Ap­ pendix to Wordsworth's Athens and Attica.
The Scholiasts observe how tender the poet shows himself towards Athens.
She is the sweetest of all the ingredients, and the demon of War has no threats for her.
(I will add a few more tributes to the excellence of τὸ μέλι τἀττικόν.
Strabo (ix. 1. 23, p. 399) says ὁ ‛Υμηττὸς μέλι ἄριστονnotet.
And a few lines later, το̑ μέλιτος ἀρίστονὂντος τω̑ν πάντωντου̑ ’Αττικου̑. Pliny (N. H. xxi. 31, cf. Id. xi. 13) tells us that all the world gave the highest praise to the Attic honey ;
and that as its special flavour was supposed to be derived from the thyme on which the bees were accus­ tomed to browse, many have carried the Attic thyme into other lands, and soughtWAR.
And now I'll pour some Attic honey in.

Hey, there, I warn you, use some other honey :

WAit.
Then ruu at once and borrow one from Athens.
RIOT.

or else I'm sure to catch it.
to rear it there, but without success.
According to Plutarch (Dion. 58) it was commonly said that the very best and the very worst men came from Athens, just as her soil produced the most delicious honey and the deadliest hemlock.
And Synesius, in his 136th epistle, complains that Athens, which aforetime was the home of philosophers, now relies for her celebrity on her honey-factors. "
And still its honeyed wealth Hymettus yields," Childe Harold ii. 87.)255. κλαύσει μακρά] ("Plorabis largi­ ter," Bergler.
This is a favourite phrase with Aristophanes who uses it, or an equivalent, in every extant Comedy with the single exception of the Acharnians.
μακρὰ is μακρὸν χρόνον.
It cannot bear the meaning which Van Leeuwen gives it, "clamores qui procul audiantur."
Menander in his Περικειρομένη (line 250, ed. Capps) has οἰμώζειν μακρὰ καὶ μεγάλ a, loud and long.
Lucian couples it with χαίρειν, " Apology for the De Mercede conductis" (5), "Pro lapsu inter salu­ tandum " (2).)261. reap Ἀθηναίων]
Here again the Scholiast, perhaps rather fancifully, de­ tects a possible compliment to the anti­ quity of the Athenians, as if it was intended to contrast them with these new-comers, who " only moved in yesterday."
The two pestles of War are, of course, Cleon and Brasidas ;
of whom Thucydides (v. 16) also says that they were the most determined opponents of Peace :
Cleon, because in quiet times his malpractices would be more apparent, and his calumnies less easily believed :
Brasidas, because he was then in the full tide of his glorious and successful career."
They both fell in the battle which was fought under the walls of Amphipolis, in the summer preceding the performance of this Play.
Cleon is also called a pestle—δοῖδυξ—in Knights 984, cf. info 295.263. πόνηρ’ ἀνθρώπια]
This expression is used by Xenophon, Mem. ii. 3. 16.268. τὸ δεῖνα]
This expression has proved a great stumbling-block to the commentators.
Bergler's translation is illud enim periit pistillum, and with this Dindorf and Holden agree.
Reiske takes it to mean τὰ δεῖνά ἐστιν εἰπεῖν soil.
οἴμοι.
Weise in a long note labours to prove that it always means ille quisquis, and is here to be joined with ἁλετρίβανος:
whilst Richter supplies ἐγένετο,—οὐ Φέρω, TO δεῖνα γὰρ ἐγένετο.
I entirely agree with Brunck (at Lysist.
921) that it is a mere ejaculation, not grammatically con­ nected with the rest of the sentence, though even Brunck, as I think, to some extent misapprehends the nature and purport of the ejaculation.
It is, in my judgement, used here and info 879;
Birds 648 ;
Lysist.
921, 926, 1168 ;
as a sort of apologetic and deprecatory intro­ duction to a disagreeable narrative;
a sort of pretended forgetfulness or hesitation (like our " What was I going to say?" " What do you think?” " Would you believe it? ") introduced for the purpose of postponing or breaking the abruptness of a statement which the speaker is reluctant to make.
It is thus closely connected with the common use of ὁ ἡ TO δεῖνα to signify a person or object whose name you do not know or will not mention (Thesm. 620-5;
Ach. 1149).
And this I take to be the interpretation of the Scholiast, διὰ TOVTOV TO ῥηθησόμενον ἀηδὲς ἐκΦεύγει εὐθέως λέγειν* ὅτε γάρ τι δυσχερὲς μέλλομεν λέγειν, εἰώθαμεν τοῦτο προτάσσειν ὡς μὴTRYG.
What's to be done, my poor dear mortals, now ?
Just see how terrible our danger is:
For if that varlet bring a pestle back, War will sit down and pulverize our cities.

RIOT.

Don't you bring it?
RIOT.
Just look here, sir :
The pestle the Athenians had is lost, The tanner fellow that disturbed all Hellas.
TRYG.

Well is he lost, and for the stated advantage, Before they've mixed us up this bitter salad.
WAR.
Then run away and fetch from Lacedaemon Another pestle.
RIOT.

TRYG.
Now is the crisis of our fate, my friends.
And if there's here a man initiate In Samothrace, 'tis now the hour to prayεὐθυρημονοῦντες.

And in Birds 648 ἀτὰρ, τὸ Selva, δεῦρ’ ἐπανάκρουσαι πάλιν.
But (what was I going to say?) please hark back here an instant.
〈See Wasps 524, the commen­ tary on Lys. 921, and the introduction to the Plutus, p. xxv.
I have altered the distribution of the speeches in this line which generally runs no.
οὗτος. KY. τί ἔστιν ;
no.
οὐ Φέρεις ;
It seems to me that when Riot returns, War could not begin with οὗτος, nor could Riot reply with τί ἔστιν;
As I have arranged the line it exactly corresponds with the second entrance of Riot infra 280, 281.
Riot begins, and War answers here τί ἔστιν;
οὐ Φέρεις ;
just as he answers there τί ἔστι;
μῶν οὐκ οὖ Φέρεις276.
ἁγὼν μέγας]
The MSS.
and edi­ tions read νῦν ἀγὼν μέγας.
I have added the aspirate because I think that the meaning is not “now is a great contest " but now comes the Tug of War.
Thus in Wasps 533 ὁρᾷς γὰρ as σοὶ μέγας ἐστὶν ἁγών;
Plato, Republic, x. 608 B μέγος ὁ ἀγὼν, μέγας, οὐχ ὅσος δοκεῖ :

This was the head­ quarters of the secret rites and mysterious worship of the Cabiri.
Bentley refers to the Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, i. 918, who tells us that of those there in­ itiated it is said that, whatsoever they ask in prayer, they will surely obtain.279.
ἀποστραΦῆναι]
Opinions differ as to whether we are to render this “to be turned aside," or (in the sense of διαστραΦῆναι) “to be dislocated."
But, in my judgement, the words τοῦ μετιόντος τὼ πόδε are inserted Trapa προσδοκίαν, and ἀποστραΦῆναι means "to be averted."
Pray the Gods to avert—not the approach­ ing calamities, but—the messenger's two feet.283.
ἐς τἀπὶ Θρᾴκης χωρία]
The re­ gions to which the movements of Brasidas extended, though not within the limits to which the name of Thrace was ulti­ mately confined, were at this period uniformly described as τὰ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης (see Thuc. i. 59 ;
iv. 78, 82 ;
v. 2, 21, &c.):
and his expedition was commonly spoken of as ἡ ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης στρατεία (see Thuc. iv. 70, 74, &c.).285.

As, when Trygaeus heard that the Athenian pestle was lost, he gratefully invoked the patron Goddess of Athens (sup. 271), so now, on hearing of the loss of the Spartan pestle, he in­ vokes the patron Gods of Sparta;

Now may I sing the ode that Datis made, The ode he sang in ecstasy at noon, “Eh, sirs, I'm pleased, and joyed, and comforted.”
Now, men of Hellas, now the hour has come To throw away our troubles and our wars, And, ere another pestle rise to stop us, To pull out Peace, the joy of all mankind.291.
χαίρομαι]
According to the Scholiasts the Datis here spoken of was the Persian commander immortalized by his defeat at Marathon, who prided him­ self on his accurate knowledge of Greek, but with so little reason, that, from his ludicrous blunders, a barbarism acquired the name of a δατισμός.
In the present instance he seems to have thought it safe to make all the verbs end in a like ter­ mination, and therefore said χaίρομαι for χαίρω.294.
τὴν πᾶσιν Εἰρήνην Φίλην]
Strong words, yet scarcely too strong to describe the sentiment then pervading the whole Hellenic world.
The Sicilian Greeks had already followed the advice of Her­ mocrates, and made τὴν ὑπὸ πάντων ὁμολα­ γουμένην ἂριστον εἶναι εἰρήνην (Thuc. iv. 62).295. ἕτερον]
"Alcibiadem baud dubio intelligit," says Paulmier.
The mistake was a natural one for Paulmier, who sup­ posed the Play to have been written three years later than was really the case;
but it is strange to find it repeated by editors who are aware that the true date of the Play is B. c. 421.
For at that time Alcibiades was so far from being " a pestle of war," that "he was advo­ cating both the peace and the alliance with Sparta, and the restoration of the prisoners."
See Grote's History of Greece, chap, Iv.
And in fact there is no allusion here to any individual what­ ever ;
there is no other pestle :
War is gone in to make one (supra 288) ;
and Trygaeus is anxious to recover Peace, before any other pestle comes into existence.296-8.
γεωργοὶ... πάντες λεῴ]
(Wide as is the invitation, the Chorus is really composed simply of twenty-four Attic (the list of Dramatis Personae in the Venetian MS. says Athmonian) farmers.
They so describe themselves infra 508, 589, and elsewhere, and are so described by others 511, 550, 551, 603, and else­ where.
The Boeotians, Argives, Laco­ nians, Megarians, and others, who are presently called upon to assist in draw­ ing up Peace from the pit, form no part of the Chorus, nor are they (as some sup­ pose) supernumeraries ;
they are purely imaginary personages.
The twenty-four farmers, as they hasten into the orchestra at the summons of Trygaeus, are singing their Parodos or entrance-song, and call­ ing upon the other members of the Panhellenic family to aid them in the work.

ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος]
This expression refers, as the Scholiast observes, to the libation poured, after supper, in the name ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος.
It was made when the guests had washed their hands, ἐπὴν ἀπανίψωνται (Athenaeus xi. 73), and the tables were about to be removed,O all ye farmers, merchants, artisans, O all ye craftsmen, aliens, sojourners, O all ye islanders, 0 all ye peoples, Come with ropes, and spades, and crowbars, eome in eager hurrying haste, Now the cup of happy fortune, brothers, it is ours to taste.

(But though War is not entirely left out of sight, for it is to him that the description ἐκδραμὼν κ.τ.λ. in line 319 must undoubtedly be­ long, yet in my opinion the reference here is primarily to Clean himself, and only incidentally to War.
For Cleon was κάτω (infra 649) ;
whereas War was ἔνδοθεν (supra 310) and not κάτωθεν.
And although the words ἡνίκ᾿ ἐνθάδ᾿ ἦν, if they mean the upper stage whereon Trygaeus is standing (the view which I took in the former edition), could only apply to War, yet I am now satisfied that the Scholiast is right in treating them as merely equivalent to ὅτε ἔζη, of.

Mr. Graves aptly refers to Frogs 783 " where, although the scene is in Hades, Aeacus says ὀλίγον τὸ χρηστόν ἐστιν, ὥσ­ περ ἐνθάδε, as if speaking on earth."
The actor ignores the special spot on which the character he represents is supposed at the moment to be standing, and merely thinks of Athens, or the upper world, as the place in which he himself and the audience are visibly existing.
In the Knights the poet had dubbed Cleon κύνα Κέρβερον ἀνδραποδι­ στὴν, and described him as παΦλάζοντα (919, 1030) ;
and indeed from the latter characteristic had given him the name ΠαΦλαγὼν, which he bears throughoutHe may come with fuss and fury (as when he was here you know), Every obstacle and hindrance in the way of Peace to throw.

Aristophanes af­ terwards worked this idea up into a play called the Γῆρας, in which he introduced a number of old men who had cast the slough of old age, and become boys (and very boisterous unruly boys too) once more;
seeAthenaeusiii. 74, p.109 F. (In Lucian's Navigium seu Vota 44 the wish of Timolaus is that he may live a thou­ sand years, renewing his youth, ἀποδυό­ μενος τὸ γῆρας, every seventeenth year.)344. συβαρίζειν]
Sybaris had un­ doubtedly attained extraordinary wealth and magnificence before its annihilation in B.C. 510 by the armies of Croton :
but the anecdotes told of the fastidious luxury and extravagant refinement of its citizens are of much later date, and are mostly altogether apocryphal.
Athe­ naeus (xii. 15) says that in order to secure undisturbed slumbers, they not only banished all noisy trades, but would not even allow a single cock to be kept in the city.
One of them took a stroll be­ yond the gates, and happened to see some labourers digging.
“It was enough to make me break a blood-vessel," he declared. "
Why even to hear you tell of it," rejoined his friend, “has given me a stitch in the side !”
Another visited Lacedaemon, and no longer wondered at the valour of the Spartans;
" for, of course," said he, " they would sooner die than live such lives as theirs."
Whatever may have been the sumptuous­ ness of this opulent town in its palmiest days, such tales as these are quite incom-I'm so happy, glad, delighted, getting rid of arms at last, More than if, my youth renewing, I the slough of Age had cast.

It is not even certain that words like συβαρίζειν were originally connected with the name of Sybaris at all, though such was the idea in later times;
and it is quite possible that the Sybarite reputation may have been to some extent the victim of an erroneous derivation.346.

363. Κιλλικῶν]
According to the Scholiasts, Cillicon was a traitor who delivered up his native country to its enemies.
(Some say Syrus to the Sa­ mians ;
others Miletus to the Prienians, aud others otherwise.)
His suspicious movements had previously attracted ob­ servation ;
but whenever interrogated as to his intentions, his reply was πάντα ὰγαθὰ, all right.
And Trygaeus means that he is doing no harm, but πάντα ἀγαθὰ,Nor a judge so stubborn-hearted, unrelenting, and severe;
You shall find me yielding then, Quite a tender youth again, When these weary times depart.
Long enough we've undergone Toils and sorrows many a one, Worn and spent and sick at heart, From Lyceum, to Lyceum, trudging on with shield and spear.
Now then tell us what you would
Have us do, and we'll obey, Since by fortune fair and good You're our sovereign Lord to-day.
TRYG.
Come let me see which way to move the stones.
HERM.
Rogue !

what are you up to now ?
TRYG.
No harm;
Everything's right, as Cillicon observed.

But I'm not prepared :
I've bought no bread and cheese, as if to die.
HERM.
Ah, well, you're absolutely gone !
TRYG.
That's oddlike Cillicon.364.
ἣν λάχω]
"It was," says the Scholiast, "the general custom at Athens to execute only one criminal a day ;
and when several were condemned to death, the order in which they were led out to execution was determined by lot."
And I think that Trygaeus simply means that Hermes being the God of Chance, under whose special patronage lots and lotteries are, will of course follow the Athenian custom, and decide the matter by lot.
He is merely bantering Hermes with a series of ridiculous repartees.
Brunck would read οἶδ’ ὅ, τι, but οἶδ’ ὅτιιs placed at the end of the sentence here, as in Wasps 1348, Soph.
Antig. 276, and in­ numerable other places, in the sense of " Well I know."
And of. infra 373.368. οὔτ’ἄλφιτ’]
This is explained to mean, "I have bought no rations, as if I was going to be killed ";
" quasi unus tantum modus," says Bergler, " sit pere­ undi, aut certissimus in bellum ire."369.
ἐπιτέτριψαι]
This word is used, as supra 246 and constantly in Aristo­ phanes, in the sense of being utterly de­ stroyed ;
and the answer of Trygaeus, according to Bergler, turns upon the idea expressed in Acharnians 757, that so he would be out of his misery.
But probably he is only chaffing Hermes, as before.375.
μυηθῆναι]
The Scholiast refers to the sketch, given in the Frogs, of the happy state to which those, who have been initiated and have lived a holy life, ὅσοι μεμυήμεθ’ εὺσεβῆ τε διήγομεν τρόπον (Frogs 456), will after death be trans­ lated.
They dwell in realms of fairest sunshine and exhilarating brightness, φῶς κάλλιστον (155), μόνοις yap ήμῖν ἥλιος καὶ φέγγος ἱλαρόν ἐστιν (454), amidst myrtle groves (156) and banks of roses (448), while around them circle the dance and song and the softly-breathing melo­ dy of the flute (154), and all pure and holy festivities proceed for ever in the happy companies of the Blessed, θιάσους εὐδαίμονας (156).
And I may add (to illustrate the mention by Trygaeus of the χοιρίδιον, whose sacrifice was an essential part of the ceremony of initiation), that Xanthias no sooner sees those holy and happy bands in the world below, than he calls out, vulgarly, ὡς ἡδύ μοι προσ­ έπνευσε χοιρείων κρεῶν (Frogs 338).376. ὦ Zεῦ]
Hermes, indignant at this last sally, calls aloud to his Master.
Trygaeus endeavours to pacify him, yet even now cannot resist a joke, for there is an obvious play on the similarity of sound between πρὸς τῶν θεῶν and πρὸς τῶν κρεῶν.
In reply, Hermes (like Iris in the Birds) assumes a tragic style, τραγικαῖς λέξεσιν ἐχρήσατο, τῳ τετορήσω καὶ λακήσομαι.—Scholiast.382. ὦρμίδιον]

Without entering upon the wide and disputed questions respect­ ing the religious system of the Persians, it will be sufficient for the present pur­ pose to refer to the account which Hero­ dotus gives of it, and which was, no doubt, generally accepted throughout the Hellenic world.

Because, by Zeus I We sacrifice to you, but those Barbarians Only to them.

And everywhere the cities saved from woe Will sacrifice to you, the Saviour Hermes.(i. 23).
He mentions a nearly total eclipse of the sun at midday, in the first year of the War (Aug. 3, B.C. 431) when the sun appeared crescent-shaped, and stars be­ came visible, Thuc. ii. 28 ;
and another in the eighth year (March 21, B.C. 424), Thuc. iv. 52. In the word ἁρματωλίας there is a play upon ἁμαρτωλία, ἁμαρτία.418.
καὶ σοί]
Hermes, the prince of thieves, however shocked at the attempt of the Sun and Moon to rob the Gods of their accustomed honours, seems in no way disinclined to appropriate them himself.
We find this keen perception of, and exclusive devotion to, his own interests again portrayed in Plutus 1118, where after bewailing the sufferings of the Gods in general, he candidly admits422.
’Αλεξικάκῳ]
Not content with depriving Athenè of the great Panathe­ naean festival, Demeter and Persephone of the Eleusinian mysteries, Zeus of the Dipolieia (Clouds 984), and Aphrodite and Adonis of the Adonia, Hermes is also to rob Apollo of his noblest attribute-that of the ’Αλεξίκακας, the Saviour, the Avert­ er of ill.
It has not, I think, been ob­ served that the worship of Apollo under this special title had only just been intro­ duced at Athens, on occasion of the ces­ sation of the plague (Pausanias i. 3. 3).
It is now to be transferred to Hermes.

If there be any that delights in war,(Melesippus) to Athens with a last offer of peace.

The Scholiast thinks that Aristophanes is referring to this incident, and at all events the paral­ lel is an interesting one.

In every Comedy which Aristophanes wrote at this period of his career, he contrived to make room for Cleonymus 6 ῥίψασπις.

It would be interesting to know whether such constant butts of the Comedians, as, for example, Cleony­ mus and Cleisthenes, ever ventured to be present at the representation of Plays, in which they must have been well aware beforehand that some opportunity or other would assuredly be found of hold­ ing them up to the derision of their fel­ low citizens.

The Scholiast would refer both these imputa­ tions to Alcibiades, attributing the first to his opposition to the peace, the second to his flight to Sparta.

They had, in fact, felt hardly any pressure from the war, and had lately, single-handed, gained a signal victory near Delium over the whole Athenian land-force, B. C. 424.
The military power of Athens had, in consequence of that disaster, fallen into general disrepute:
τω̃ν 'Αθηναιων κατα­ φρονουμένων διὰ τὴν περὶ τὸ Δήλιον συμφο­ ράν.—Diod.
Sic. xii, chap. 75.
And the Boeotians, elated by their triumph, were ill disposed to be dragged, through the desire of Sparta to recover her captives, into a peace which would leave Athens as vigorous and as formidable as ever.
Accordingly they absolutely refused to accede to the Peace of Nicias (Thuc. v. 17), and merely concluded with Athens δεημέρους ἐπισπονδὰς (Thuc. v. 32), which is usually interpreted to mean an indefi­ nite truce determinable by either party on ten days' notice.

Dobree proposed aXX' ἂγετε ξυνανέλκετε καὶ σφὼ, which I have adopted in part;

474. μορμόνος]
Aristophanes had al­ ready in Acharnians, 582, applied this word to the Gorgon of Lamachus;
cf. info 561.
It is interesting to observe the name of Lamachus in Thuc. v. 19 (and cf. Id. 24), amongst the list of signatures to the actual Peace which was concluded a few days after the performance of this Play.
(As to μορμὼ, a bogey with which Hellenic nurses were in the habit of frightening their nurslings, see the Com­ mentary on Ach.

Argos was the only state in Southern Greece which had hitherto taken no part whatever in the Peloponnesian War.
Proud in her old historic traditions, she was ill inclined to range herself beneath the banners of either Athens or Sparta, and found her own advantage in the continuance of a conflict which was wasting and weaken­ ing her rivals, whilst her own power and resources remained unimpaired.
The language of Thucydides (v. 28) forms a commentary on the speech of Hermes cites a passage from "
The Deserters " of Pherecrates, in which that poet says of the Argives — With the phrase διχόθεν μισθοφορυ̃ντες, Bergler aptly compares the law which forbad citizens to receive pay from the State in more than one character at a time, μὴ διχόθεν μισοθορειν.— Demosth. in Timocr. 141, p. 739 ;
Boeckh's Public Econ. ii. 16.479. ἒχονται του̃ ξύλου]
The Scholiast is, in my judgement, unquestionably right in referring these words to the Spartan captives, who were then lan­ guishing in the Athenian prison, " keep­ ing fast to the ξύλον," which is the term constantly used by Aristophanes to denote the instrument employed for confining prisoners, and is indeed so used with reference to these very cap­ tives in Knights 394.
It was only the longing desire of the Spartans to recove these prisoners, τ0οὺς ἂνδρας κομισασθαι (Thuc. iv. 108, 117 ;
v. 15, &c.)—a desire so absorbing, that even the brilliant successes of Brasiclas were welcomed merely as a means to that end-which was now bringing about the opportunity of peace ;
nor is it probable that Aristo­ phanes should have altogether over-They only laugh at us, our toils and troubles, And all the while take pay from either side.

looked this circumstance in describing the pacific inclination of the Laconians.
The ingenious theory of Paulmier (which has been followed by Brunck, Bothe, Richter, and others), that by ol ἐχόμενοι του̃ ξύλου we are to understand the framers of agricultural implements, and by ὀ χαλκεὺς the forger of military weapons, would, I am persuaded, never have been invented, but for his erroneous belief that this Play was composed after the release of the Sphacterian captives.
I doubt if there is, in reality, so sharp a distinction between the interests of the workers in wood and those of the workers in metal, as his theory would imply.
And at all events it is, I think, clear that Aristophanes is here referring to some­ thing special in the circumstances of Sparta, and not to any mere general distinction between the warlike and un­ warlike classes, which, if true at all, would at any rate be no more true of Sparta than it would of any other Hel­ lenic State.
The exact meaning of the words o χαλκεὺς οὐκ ἐᾷ is, I think, more doubtful:
but, on the whole, it appears probable that the Scholiast's explanation is here again correct, ὂτι ἐδέδεντο καὶ περιέκειντο αὐτοι̃ς πέδαι.
There can be no allusion here (as Florent Chretien, re­ ferring to Knights 469, suggests) to Cleon, who was no longer living.481.
οἰ Μεγαρει̃ς]
We have already, on 246 supr., had occasion to notice the extremity of suffering to which the Mega­ rians had been reduced by the continu­ ance of the war.
Peace and the restora­ tion of Nisaea were to them objects of the most urgent necessity.
Yet they were at present holding back from, and ultimately declined to accede to, the Peace of Nicias, inasmuch as it allowed Nisaea, without which peace itself was valueless, to remain in the possession of the Athenians.

The poet is alluding to the circumstance that the Megarians furnished the immediate cause of, or excuse for, the Peloponnesian War.
See on 609 infra.
And as the Megarid was the great garlic-producing country (see on 246 supr.), he expresses himself in language borrowed from the custom of priming gamecocks with garlic before they commenced to fight.

You don't do anything but go to law.
No, if you really want to pull her out,505.
δικάζετε]
We should, as the Scholiast observes, have expected some other word, ye do nothing but talk, or get in the way;
but Aristophanes rarely misses an opportunity of twitting his fellow countrymen with their litigious propensities.
The advice conveyed in the two following lines is, no doubt, as Bergler and Brunck remark, equivalent to the celebrated political maxim of Themistocles, ὂτιἀνθεκτέα τη̃ς θαλάσσης (Thuc. i. 93).
Yet it is hard to see how it would tell at this moment in favour of peace, unless the poet means to imply either that it was not the maritime supremacy of Athens, but her attempt to interfere, as a military power, in the arrangements of Hellas Proper, which first alarmed the jealousy of Sparta ;
or else that the recent disasters of her armies at Delium and Amphipolis had deprived her of the power, which the victories of her fleets had previously placed in her hands, of making peace when, and almost as, she would.
In this case, too, the meaning of δικάζετε may be, '' Ye should not have haggled like pettifogging lawyers over the terms of peace (see Thuc. iv. 21), but, withdraw­ ing frankly from interference with the land powers, ye should have devoted yourselves entirely to the maintenance and extension of your maritime ascend­ ancy."511.

Aristophanes seems to have selected the word ἐξέλκουσι to express a meaning which does not usually belong to it merely because the preced­ ing lines have been full of έλκειν and its compounds :
just as in Acharnians 347 he selected the word ἀνασείειν to express a meaning which does not usually be­ long to it, merely because there the preceding lines had been full of σείειν and its cognates.)513. ὀμου̃]

A colossal figure of Peace, attended by two handmaidens, Harvesthome and Mayfair, is lifted out of the pit.

It would seem from 682 inf. that the head of the figure could be moved.
(However in all probability it was not the entire colossal figure, but only the head and bust of Peace which was drawn up from the pit.
Hence the lips would be near enough to the ear of Hermes for her to address him in a whisper.

(I have not got one of my own.
Naber proposed to change εἲχον into ἦγον, but ἒχειν οἲκοθεν is an extremely common expression.
In the Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi (p. 482 in Loesner's Hesiod) Hesiod recites one line and Homer immediately continues it with another.
So when Hesiod be­ ginsHomer caps it withThe same words σὺδὲν οἲκοθεν ἒχοντες are found in St. Chrysostom's Horn. vi in 1 Cor. (p. 45 D).
And in Horn.
XXXV in 1 Cor. (p. 330 A) he says οὖτος μὲν οἶκοθεν ἒχει TO ἀσφαλὲς, ἐκει̃νος δὲ ἒξωθεν.
Perhaps the- exact force of the word οἲκοθεν is most clearly shown by the distinction which the same writer draws between the powers exercised by our Lord and those exercised by the apos­ tles.
The apostles, he says, οὺδὲν οἲκοθεν ἒλεγον, ἀλλ' ἂπερ ἐδέξαντο παρὰ του̃ θεου̃ (Horn. vi in 1 Cor. p. 46 A);
whereas our Saviour οὺκ ἀναμένει δέξαθαι ἐνέρ γειαν, ἀλλ' οἲκοθεν πάντα ἐργάζεται (Horn. xxvi in Matth., p. 315 B).)528. πλέκος]
This is a witty adapta­ tion of a line of Euripides preserved by the Scholiast, ἀπέπτυσ ἐχθρου̃ φωτὸς ἒχθιστον τέκος.
(The Scholiast says that it comes either from the Telephus or the Tlepolemus.
No such Tragedy as the Tlepolemus is known ;
and some think that the reference is to the " Licymnius,'' as to which see Birds 1242 and the Commentary there.
Licymnius the half-brother of Alcmene was, either wilfully or accidentally, killed by Tie­ polemus the son of Heracles.
But the present line almost certainly comes from the Telephus:
see Acharnians 454 and the note there.
ἀπέπτυσα, I abominate, is a very favourite word of Euripides.
He uses it in that sense-generally at the commencement of a line, and some­ times with, and sometimes without, an accusative following—Hec. 1276, Hipp. 614, Iph. Aul. 509, 874, Iph. Taur. 1161, Troades 662, Helen 664.)530. ὐποδοχη̃ς] (reception, in the sense of entertainment.

This, as Bentley remarks (Phalaris, see.

and means the same thing with our 0 yes ! or Oyez.
Plutarch (in Thes.) tells us that, in the parish of the Pallenians of Attica, 'twas unlawful for the crier to use that common form, because a certain crier, called Leos, had betrayed their ancestors.
Stratonicus the musician made a quibble about it, for as he was once in Mylasa, a city that had few inhabitants, but a great many temples, he comes into the market-place, as if he would proclaim something :
but, instead of 'Ακούετε λαοὶ as the form used to be, he said 'Ακούετε ναοί.—Athen. viii. chap. 41." The form is several times used by Aristophanes.

The Scholiast explains it by παλαια̃ς καὶ ὰρχαίας, and so Suidas.

πολλοστῷ χρόνῳ]
(Paley objects to my rendering, after such a weary time, and takes the words to mean " for a moment" ;
but they cannot possibly bear that interpretation.
πολλοστὸς is never equivalent to, but always the reverse of, ὀλιγοστός.
In Demosthenes against Timocrates 224 (p. 761) πολλοστῷ χρόνῳ means, as here, Zongo post tempore;
in Lucian's De Syria Dea 2 οὐ πολλοστῷ χρόνῳ means not long afterwards.
The true signification of the word is shown in such passages as Irenaeus v. 2.
3 ὀ κόκκος TOV σίτου πεσὼν εις πὴν γη̃ν, κοὶ διαλυθεὶς, πολλοστὸς έγέρθη(multiplex surgit), the equivalent of the Gospel πλὺν κάρπον φέρει.
Is is only when applied to a fraction that πολλοσὸς implies, though it does not itself mean, something small;
and that is because the more numerous the parts into which a thing is divided, the smaller will each individual part be.
A myriadth part will be very much smaller than a tenth part;
but "in the myriadth year" signifies a very much longer period than "in the tenth year."
That is why such expressions as τὸ πολλοστὸν τη̑ς ὀφειλη̑ς (St. Chrysostom, Horn. lxi in Matth. p. 612 D) and τὸπολλοστὸν μέρς τῶν ἀνιώντων αὺτοὺς (Lucian, Epist.
Saturnales 26) may be rightly rendered the least part of the debt," "the least part of their troubles," though there is no word in the Greek actually signifying '' least."
So again πολλοστὸς as meaning " one of very many " comes to mean "common," "cheap," "worthless."
But πολλοϭτὸς χρόνος could never bear the interpretation which Paley gives it.)560. τῆ θεῳ̑] (that is "Peace";

Athene is γοργῶπιςιn the " Ajax."
Both Aeschylus (Septem 532) and Euripides (Phoen. 146) apply the epithet to the eagle eye of the boyish hero Parthenopaeus, the son of Atalanta, and one of the Seven against Thebes.
Achilles Tatius uses it of a maiden's quick clear-glancing eye, γοργὸν ἐν ἡδονῇ (i. 4).
So Xen. Eph., in his First Book extolling the wondrous beauty of Anthia, which far exceeded that of all other maidens, says, ὀφθαλμοὶ γοργοὶ, φαιδροὶ μὲν ὡς κόρης, φοβεροὶ δὲ ὡς σώφρονος.
So Heliodorus (i. 21 and ii. 31) γοργόν τε καὶ ἐπαγωγὸν ἐνεῖδε.
And of a youth ἔραστον ἄμα Kat γοργὸν προσβλέπων, Id. vii. 10. So St. Chrysostom (Hom. vii in 2 Cor. 491 C) ἀλλ᾽ ὑγρὸς o ὀφθαλμὸς καὶ γοργὸς, Kat ἣμερ
ος ἡ κόρη καὶ γαληνὸν τὸ ὄμμα.
Cf. Id. Horn. xvii in Hebr. p. 172 A.
And so, generally, γοργὸς sig­ nifies lively, without a trace of anything grim or terrible, which is quite a secon­ dary meaning derived from the supposed connexion of the word with the Gorgons.

Μετόρχιον is τὸ μεταξὺ τῶν φυτῶν, the space between the rows­ ὂρχοι-of vines.

greatest amount of testimony, ἔχουσα πλείστους μάρτυρας.
And he tells us that the enemies of Pericles wishing, before they attacked him personally, to test the feeling with which the Athenians would regard such attacks, began by accusing Pheidias-a man very dear to, and of great influence with, Pericles—of having subtracted a part of the gold assigned him for the statue of Athene.
And although Pheidias escaped from that charge by weighing the gold, which, by the advice of Pericles, he had made up so that it could at once be severed from the other materials, yet falling into disgrace on the ground that he had, in the battle-scene on Athene's shield, introduced likenesses of himself and Pericles, he was thrown into prison, and there died.
Aspasia and Anaxagoras, the mistress and the teacher of Pericles, were next assailed, and Plutarch pro­ ἐγκλήματα.
The same story, with varia­ tions, is told by Diodorus Siculus, xii. chap. 39. (By ἦρξεν αὐτῆς we must un­ derstand began with her, began τῆς ἀπωλείας αὐτῆς.

Μεγαρικοῦ Ψηφίσματος]
This was the famous interdict prohibiting the Megarians from all intercourse with any part of the Athenian empire (Thuc. i. 67 ;
Acharn. 532-4).
That it was the immediate occasion of, or pretext for, the war is plain upon all the authorities.
The issue between the Peloponnesian Confederacy and Athens was narrowed to this-Aye, or No?
Would she, or would she not, rescind τὸπερὶ Μεγαρέων Ψήφισμα ?
If she would, μὴ ἂ γίγνεοθαι πόλεμον (Thuc. i. 139).
So Aristophanes, Ach. 535-9, and here.
Andocides de Pace, p. 24, running through the mili­ tary history of Athens, speaks of the first ten years of the Peloponnesian War in the following terms :
—Πάλιν διὰ Me­ Siculus (xii. 39), Plutarch (Pericles, chap. 29), and Aelian (V. H. xii. 53) all treat τὸ Μεγαρικὸν ψήφισμα as the point upon which the issue of peace and war de­ pended ;
and it is clear, as well from the narrative of Thucydides as from the anecdotes collected by Plutarch, that it required all the authority and all the commanding eloquence of Pericles to restrain the Athenians from yielding the point.611.
πάντας "Ελληνας δακρῦσαι]
This statement, though not really inconsis­ tent with, yet forms a curious commen­ tary upon, the famous and honourable deathbed boast of Pericles, that no Athenian had, by any act of his, been obliged to put on mourning, οὐδεὶς δι᾽ ἐμὲμὲλαν ἱμάτιαν περιεβάλετο.—Plutarch, Pericles, chap. 38. (By τούς T' ἐκεῖ τούς τ᾽ἐνθάδε Hermes means the Pelopon­ nesians as well as the Athenians.)612. ἢκουσ᾽]
(The best MSS.
read ἄκουσ᾽ invita ;
but in my former edition I preferred ἢκουσ᾽, the reading of an in­ ferior MS.

Those who discard ἢκουσ᾽ understand ἐψόφησεν of the destruction of the Attic vines by the invading army of Archi­ damus;
but Peace disappeared before, not after that destruction, nor has the narrative of Hermes arrived at that point.
It is only in line 624 that he reaches the actual outbreak of the War.
Here he is speaking of something which occurred while the hostile states were, not yet fighting, but merely showingSuch a bitter smoke ascended while the flames of war he blew, That from every eye in Hellas everywhere the tears it drew.

Butt on butt was dashed and shivered, by revenge and anger stirred;
There was none to stay the tumult;

"De vite loquitur," says Bergler, " tan­ quam de animali, more Aesopico ;

οὐδεὶς ά παύσων]
(So Plutarch, in the last chapter of his Life of Cimon, says that after Cimon's death the Hel­ lenes did no glorious deed against the Barbarians, but being turned against each other by demagogues and agitators broke out into intestine wars, οὐδενὸς τὰς χεῖρας ἐν μέσῳ διασχόντος.〉616.

(So all the MSS.

τοὐς φάρους]
It is unnecessary here to trace the steps whereby Athens, from being merely prima -interpares, the First City in a Free Confederacy, all the members of which contributed alike to the common treasury kept at Delos for Panhellenic purposes, had developed into a superior inter inferiores, a Mistress ruling over subordinate Allies, exacting tribute, φάρους, as a due to herself, issuing orders at her pleasure, and en­ forcing them with jealous severity.
ἔλαθαν, says Plutarch of the Allies, ὰντὶ συμμάχων ὑποτελεῖς καὶ δοῦλοι γεγονότες.
Cimon, chap. 11. That one Hellenic state should reduce others into the con­ dition of tributaries, ὑποτελεῖς φόρου (see Thuc. i. 19), was a phenomenon so re­ pugnant to Hellenic sentiments, that Athens was universally regarded by both friends and foes in the light of a Tyrant city (Thuc. i. 122, 124, ii. 63, iii. 37) ;
and the avowed object of the Peloponnesians in entering upon the war was to put an end to what they considered an unnatural usurpation, and to leave every Hellenic city free.
So eager were the tributaries to shake off the yoke, that, shortly before the Pelo­ ponnesian War, we read of a whole maritime population giving up their homes and migrating inland, where it was hoped that the arm of Athens could not reach them (Thuc. i. 58).
Thucy­ dides does not actually mention that they employed bribes to induce the Spartans to commence the war ;
but he tells us (i. 58) that the Potidaeans, whom he calls ξυμμάχ
ους φάρου ὑποτελει̑̂ς of Athens, managed matters so well at Sparta, that they obtained from the highest Lacedaemonians a promise that, if the Athenians touched Potidaea, the Spartan armies should be led into Attica.623.
αἰσχροκερδει̂ς καὶ διειρωνάξεναι]
Bergler refers to Eurip.
Androm. 451, where Andromache, appealing to the candour of the Spartans, asks, " Are ye not αἰσχροκερδει̂ς ?"
The epithet διειρωνάξενοι is supposed to allude to the ξενηλασια of Sparta.
That that harsh institution was keenly resented by the other Hellenic states, may perhaps be gathered from the reply dictated by Pericles to the Spartan ultimatum, Μεγαρέας ἐάσομεν ἀγορᾷ καὶ λιμέσι χρῆσθαι, ἢν καὶ Αακεδαιμόνιοι ξενηλασίας μὴ ποιω̄σι μήτε ἡμῶν μήτε τῶν ἡμετέρων ξυμμάχων.— Thuc. i. 144.624. ἀνήρπασαν]
For they refused the offers of Athens to refer all matters in dispute to arbitration, and acted upon the advice of the Corinthians, μὴ ὀκνεῖν τὰν πάλεμαν ἀντ’εἰρήνης μεταλαμβάνειν (Thuc. i. 120).
In after years, when the fortunes of war had turned against them, they acknowledged that they had been too precipitate in commencing it (Thuc. vii. 18).625. τἀκείνων]
That is, of course, τῶν μεγίστων, not, as Richter explains it, τῶν πολεμούντων.
Aristophanes is dis­ tinguishing between the leading men and the peasant-farmers of Laconia :
the former, he says, gained by the war, for they were bribed to commence it;
it ruined the latter, for their lands were ravaged by the Athenian forays.
Peri­ cles (Thuc. i. 142) calls the Pelopon­ nesians in general ἄνδρες γεωργαί.626.
ἀντιτιμωρούμεναι]
Before the war commenced, Pericles had laid it down as a maxim of policy, ἢν ἐπὶ τὴν χώραν ἡμῶν πεζῇ ἴωσιν, ἡμεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν ἐκείνων πλευσούμεθα-Thuc. i. 143.
AndAnd the chief Laconian leaders by enormous bribes they gained.
These at once for filthy lucre, guest-deluders as they are, Hustling out this gracious lady, greedily embraced the War.
But from this their own advantage ruin to their farmers came;
For from hence the eager galleys sailing forth with vengeful aim, Swallowed up the figs of people who were not, perchance, to blame.
TRYG.
Very justly, very justly!
richly had they earned the blow, Lopping down the dusky fig-tree I had loved and nurtured so.
accordingly it was while the Pelopon­ nesians were yet in Attica on their first invasion, and while the whole city was in an uproar, as Mr. Mitford expresses it, about the devastation of Acharnae, that the Athenians sent out their first retaliatory fleet to ravage the coasts of Peloponnesus (Thuc. ii. 23).
And thence­ forward, in every succeeding year, even after the Laconian invasions of Attica had been stopped by the threat of exe­ cuting the Sphacterian prisoners, the Athenian triremes were constantly dart­ ing in upon the unguarded shores of Peloponnesus, revenging not upon the Laconian leaders, but upon the Laconian villagers, " who were not, perchance, to blame," the damage which Attica had sustained from the invading armies.
628. κορώνεων]
〈A fig-tree, which was so called because its fruit was as black as a crow, κορώνη.
For the same reason it was called κοράκες, the raven-black fig.

ἐξέκοψαν]
How bitterly the Athenians resented the cutting down of their vines and fig-trees, and the devas­ tation of their country-homes, may be seen as well in the impressive language of Thucydides (ii. 21) as from number­ less passages in the extant plays of Aristophanes.
" Peace ! " say the choleric Acharnians, in indignation (Ach. 183), “what!
when they have cut down our vines!”
"I too hate the Lacedaemonians with all my heart," says Dicaeopolis, κἀμοὶγάρἐστινἀμπέλια κεκομμένα.Andocides (see note on 609 supr.) speaks of this devastation as the most noteworthy event of the Archida­ mian War.
It was, in truth, the common practice in Greek warfare ;
but the existing generation of Athenians had never drunk the bitter cup before, and they, of all the Hellenic peoples, were most wedded to a country life.
The Mosaic Law forbade the practice (Deut. xx. 19) ;
and so, as among Hel­ lenic combatants, did Plato in his Re­ public, v. 471.633.
τὸντρόπονπωλούμενοςκ.τ.λ.]
This phrase has been universally, and, I think, very strangely, misinterpreted.
Nothing can be clearer than its mean­ ing.
Aristophanes has just shown that the Laconian farmers had been sold by their leaders, and now he adds, that the Attic farmers, when they came flocking in from all the villages to Athens, did not observe that they too were being sold by theirs, in just the same way, i.e. "eodem modo quo Lacones."
Yet Bergler and Brunck translate it, “ eodem modo quo urbani";
Bothe, "eodem modo ut antea cum ipsi in agris dege­ rent " ;
and others, otherwise.
With the phrase itself Bergler aptly compares Acharnians 370-4.
The word ἰσχάδας in the next line seems to refer to the donatives which the orators obtained for the hungry populace.637.
δικροι̑ςἐώθουν]
These words are to be taken together as constituting one idea, they pitchforked her out with yells ;
not as Fritzsche on Thesm.

The phrase is a common one;
and Florent Chretien and Bergler have already cited the δικράνοιςἐξεώθειοf Lucian's Timon ;
the furcillis ejiciunt of Catullus;
and the Naturam expelles furca of Horace.
aὐτὴν in the succeeding line means " of her­ self, of her own accord.

τὰΒρασίδου]
Thucydides pic­ tures, in very forcible language, the prodigious agitation and sympathy which the operations of Brasidas on the N.W. coast of the Aegean excited amongst the Athenian tributaries.
All were on theCHOR.

And Athens, though vigilant and energetic as ever, was yet full of alarm and suspicion, not knowing on whom to depend.
That an ally was " leaning to Brasidas" was an intimation requiring, and sure to receive, immediate attention.
In Wasps 473 the foiled and irritated dicasts, passing in their wrath from the trochaic to the abrupt gasping cretic metre, at once charge their opponent with Brasidean sym­ pathies :
Words with THEE, thou people-hater !

The Pnyx is admirably described by Wordsworth (Athens and Attica, chap. x).
The limestone rock, upon which Athens stands, is constantly protruding through its meagre superstratum of soil, like the bones of an emaciated body (to use the simile of Plato, Critias 111 B), through its torn and shrivelled skin.
Athenian ingenuity adapted this geological forma­ tion to architectural purposes, and everywhere the living rock is itself hewn into theatres, seats, steps, walls, cis­ terns, and the like.
The Pnyx may be roughly described as a semicircular area, along the chord of which ran a project­ ing ridge of this solid rock.
In the centre of the ridge (and therefore

nearly where the centre of the circle would be) there juts out a prominent piece of rock, 10 or 12 feet high, which is hewn into the pulpit or rostra from which the Athenian orators addressed the Assembly in the area before them.
This was the famous Bema or Pnyx­ stone.
The Pnyx derived its name either from the crowds which thronged together there, ἀπὸτου̑πυκνου̑σθαιτοὺς av8pas ἐντη̩̑ἐκκλησία̩,or from the closely- packed stones which propped up a sloping part of the arc, so as to keep it from lapsing down into the valley of the Agora beneath it, παρὰτὴντω̑νλίθων πυκνότα.
See also Schömann's As­ semblies, Book I, chap. iii.
Taking the Bema as the centre, the radius of the circle varied from 60 to 80 yards.

Ύπέρβολος]
The character of Hyperbolus the lamp-maker, the dema­ gogue who succeeded Cleon in the favour of the Athenian people, is pithily and expressively described by his contem­ poraries Aristophanes and Thucydides.
The former styles him here πονηὸν προστάτην,and in Knights 1304 μοχθηὸν ἄνδρα,while Thucydides (viii. 73) merely notices him as a μοχθη
ρὸνἄνθρωπον.687. τέως] (i. e. “donec melior pa­ tronus praesto esset," Herwerden ;
" as a temporary arrangement," Sharpley.)697. Σιμωνίδης]
Simonides was, as the Scholiast observes, the first poet who wrote for hire, and many tales are current about the mercenary spirit in which he practised the joyous Art."
(That Simonides was a lover of money, says Aelian, is a fact which none will gainsay, ὡς ἦνφιλοχρήματοςὁ Σιμωνίδης οὐδεὶςὐντιφήσειV.
H. viii. 2 ;
Id. ix. 1.)
But nowhere else, I believe, is a charge of this kind brought against Sophocles ;
the Scholiasts are utterly at aloss to account for it;
and it seems so incon­ sistent with all that we know of his character ;
with that fondness for plea­ sure and social enjoyments, to which he gave free rein, even ἐπὶδυσμαι̑ςτου̑βίου, in the very evening of his life, and about which Athenaeus (Book xiii) col.
lects so many scandalous anecdotes;
with that easy and accommodating dispo­ sition—εὐκολία—which distinguished him his whole life through, and which Aristo­ phanes supposed him to have carried into his grave (Frogs 82) ;
and even with the dubious tradition which the writer of his life records about the domestic troubles of his old age;
that I cannot help suspecting that these lines are in­ tended to be not a personal satire upon his actual character, but an allusion to some­ thing with which we are unacquainted, to some passing incident in the poet's life, or to some expression in his plays.
The Scholiast refers to a proverb, Θεου̑ θέλοντοςκἂνἐπὶῥιπὸςπλέοις, With God to aid, you might put to sect upon a hurdle.
(The line is ascribed by some old writers to the "Thyestes," but both Euripides and Sophocles wrote a Tragedy bearing that name, and we are not told to which of the two they are referring.

)700.
Κρατι̑νος]
This is but a con­ tinuation of the old joke about the convivial habits of Cratinus.
In Knights 526-36, Aristophanes, affecting to con­ sider him in his dotage, declared it a shame that he should be left to wander about like a drunken piper, he who, for his past services, was worthy (not δειπ­ νει̑ν, as others, but) πίνεινιn the Pryta­ neum.
But in the following year the jovial old Poet turned the laugh against his rival by his celebrated Play of the Flagon, Πυτίνη,which carried off the prize from the Κόννοςοf Ameipsias, and the Clouds of Aristophanes.
In this Play he represented the Flagon as the mistress who had seduced him from his first and lawful love, the Comic Muse ;
and it was here, in all probability, that he gave utterance to the sentiment re­ corded by Horace (Ep. i. 19.
1) con­ demnatory of the effusions of water­ drinkers, Ὓδωρδὲπίνωνοὐδὲνἂντέκοι σοφόν.
〈See the Commentary on Knights 536.)
The author of the Treatise on Longevity (Macrobii, in Lucian's Works), see. 25, says that Cratinus lived to the age of 97, and that he composed the Flagon πρὸςτῷτέλειτου̑βίου,dying not long afterwards, μετ’οὐπολὺἐτελεύα.
The Scholiast on Birds 521 makes him survive that Play many years, and, al­ though the Scholiast is of no authority in a matter of this sort, yet I doubt if it is right to look upon the lines before us as a conclusive proof that Cratinus was now dead.
At all events there had been no Laconian invasion, to which his death could even in joke be referred, since the date of the Flagon, the Spar­ tans having been deterred from sending an army into Attica by the threat that, if they did so, the Sphacterian prisoners should be put to death.
It may be, therefore, that Aristophanes is merely alluding in jest to the old invasions (τἀρχαȋα, as he says supr. 694), intend­ ing, as he before celebrated prematurely the dotage, so now to celebrate prema­ turely the obsequies, of his merry old rival.
The humour of the passage would certainly not be lessened by the circumstance that Cratinus was still alive, perhaps sitting in the theatre, an interested spectator of this very contest.

THE PARABASIS PROPER.
The first two lines denounce with great vigour the employment of " the anapaests " by a Poet for the purpose of singing his own praises.
In all the remaining “ anapaests "
Aristophanes is singing his own praises with keen relish and equal vigour.
The main ground of his self-praise is that just as Aeschylus had raised and ennobled Tragedy, so he himself had elevated and exalted Comedy from mere vulgar farce and attacks for paltry ends upon paltry objects into a high intellectual enter­ tainment, a mighty instrument for good, alike in the social and in the political world.
In order that none of his merits may be overlooked, he actually borrows, with but slight alterations, from the Parabasis of the Wasps (acted in the preceding year) his own description of the fearless gallantry with which he attacked Cleon in the Knights, when the demagogue was at the very height of his power.
As to the application of the term παραβὰς to the Poet himself see Ach.
629 and the Commentary there.

And again, in his Apology for the De Mercede Conductis 5, he says, τοȋς λεσσα μόνος.”—Scholiast.
In my former edition I took θύγατερ
Διὸς to mean Athene;
and that is, I think, the view of all the commentators ;
but I am now convinced that I was wrong, and that by the appellation of “Daughter of Zeus," Aristophanes, at all events, is addressing the Muse, as infra 775 and 817.
I do not know whom Simonides intended to address;
but the words θυγάτηρ
Διὸς, in an appeal of this kind, had been appropriated to the Muse from Homer's time ;
ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μου̑σα, πολύτροπον ... τω̑ν ἀμόθεν γε θεὰ, θύ­ γατερ
Διὸς, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμȋν.
—Odyssey i. 1, 10.
And so the words are understood by the Scholiasts who paraphrase the lineWere to fill with the praise of himself and his Plays our own anapaestic address.
But if ever, 0 daughter of Zeus, it were fit with honour and praise to adorn A Chorus-Instructor, the ablest of men, the noblest that ever was born, Our Poet is free to acknowledge that he is deserving of high commendation :
[t was he that advancing, unaided, alone, compelled the immediate cessation )f the jokes which his rivals were cutting at rags, and the battles they waged with the lice.
[t was he that indignantly swept from the stage the paltry ignoble device Of a Heracles needy and seedy and greedy, a vagabond sturdy and stout, Now baking his bread, now swindling instead, now beaten and battered about.
A.nd freedom he gave to the lachrymose slave who was wont with a howl to rush in, A.nd all for the sake of a joke which they make on the wounds that disfigure his skin :
“Why, how now, my poor knave.?”
so they bawl to the slave, “ has the whipcord invaded your back, Spreading havoc around, hacking trees to the ground, with a savage resistless attack ?”νέσαι τινά.
And more than all, the invo­ cation itself is part of a comic jest with which it would not be becoming to associate the great and awful name of Athene;
seethe Commentary on Knights 551-64;
while that no such impropriety attaches to a similar use of the Muse's name is shown by the passages, to which reference has been made above, in the Strophe and Antistrophe of this very Parabasis.
)739. τοὺς ἀντιπάλους]
The Scholiast says that the ensuing criticisms are specially directed against Eupolis, Cratinus, and others.
But they must not be restricted to individual cases.
A gluttonous Heracles was the stock joke of the comic poets (see Athenaeus x. 1) ;
and both in the Birds and in the Frogs, Aristophanes himself introduces the character.
But his Heracles plays quite a subordinate part, and is not-as he suggests was the case in other comedies —the staple commodity of the Play.740.
εἰς τὰ paKia κ.τ.λ.]
(This line has been taken too literally.
It is merely a comic description of the paltry and unworthy objects to which his prede­ cessors confined their satire.
By τοȋς Φθειρσὶν, the Scholiast says, we must understand εὐτελεȋς ἄνδρας καὶ ἀδόξους, and he explains εἰς τὰ ῥάκια by ὡς εἰσα­ YÓV1'CùV TCOV áÀ'ACùv KCùfJ.LΚίιJV paJ<orpopovvraç.
He adds αἰνίττεται δὲ εἰς Εὔπολιν, but that is hard to believe.
Everything we know of Eupolis tends to show that he went hand in hand with Aristophanes in his attempt to elevate Comedy and purge it from vulgar farce and attacks upon ignoble objects.

The following description of Cleon is repeated, with but slight varia­ tion, from the Parabasis of the Wasps, 1030-7, (where the poet is describ­ ing his own career as that of a Heracles, a Destroyer of monsters.
The reader is referred to the Commentary there.
)754. καρχαρόδοντι]
The epithet refers to the sharp, irregular, serrated teeth with which carnivora tear their food, as contrasted with the even, regular, flat surfaces which render the teeth of other animals more adapted for grinding.
Aristotle (Hist. Animal.
ii. 3. 9) defines καρχαρόδοντα to be ὅσα ἐπαλλ'άττει τοὺς ἀδόντας ταὺς ὀξεȋς.
Lycophron, in his obscure enigmatic style, speaks of Hera­ cles as one of γνάθοις πατὲ Τρίτωνος Canter adds, "Canes et pisces omnes carnivori asperos et serratos, non con­ tinuos, habent dentes."
Homer and Hesiod frequently apply this epithet to dogs, and Theocritus (xxiv. 85) applies it to the wolf.
The genus to which the terrible white shark belongs is called by naturalists Carcharodon, from the notched three-edged teeth which dis­ tinguish it.
Aristophanes had already (Knights 1017) called Cleon, or ratherSuch vulgar contemptible lumber at once he bade from the drama depart, And then, like an edifice stately and grand, he raised and ennobled the Art.
High thoughts and high language he brought on the stage, a humour exalted and rare, Nor stooped with a scurrilous jest to assail some small-man-and-woman affair.
No, he at the mightiest quarry of all with the soul of a Heracles flew, And he braved the vile scent of the tan-pit, and went through foul-mouthed revilings for you.
And I at the outset came down in the lists with the jaggèd-fanged monster to fight, Whose eyeballs were lurid and glaring with flames of Cynna's detestable light;
And around his forehead the thin forked tongues of a hundred sycophants quiver, And his smell was the smell of a seal, and his voice was a brawling tempestuous River, And his hinder parts like a furnace appeared, and a goblin's uncleansable liver.
But I reeked not the least for the look of the beast;
I never desponded or quailed, And I fought for the safety of you and the Isles;
I gallantly fought and prevailed.
You therefore should heed and remember the deed, and afford me my guerdon to-day, For I never went off to make love to the boys in the schools of athletic displaymade him call himself, a κύνα καρχαρό­ δοντο ;
and in line 765 of the same play he had already associated Cleon's name with that of Cynna, who was a shameless Athenian prostitute.756.
ἑκατόν]
Mr. Mitchell (at Wasps 1033) suggests that Aristophanes is here deriving his imagery from the descrip­ tion given by Hesiod of Typhoeus, Theo­ gony 825.758.
Λαμίας]
The mythological his­ tory of Lamia is given by the Scholiast, who represents her as a Libyan princess, beloved of Zeus.
Hera, discovering the intrigue, deprived her of all her off­ spring as soon as they were born, and the childless mother, roaming about in mad despair, endeavoured to indemnify herself for her bereavement by stealing the children of others ;
διὰ TOVTO, says the Scholiast, καὶ τὰς τίτθας ἐκΦοβούσας He adds, εἰδωλοποιεȋ τινας ὄρχεις Λομίας θη̑λυ γάρ.
And with reference to Φώκης ὀσμὴν, he cites Horn. Od. iv. 442—760. τω̑ν ἄλλων νήσων]
There is no special allusion here, as Dindorf sug­ gests, to Aegina :
by " the other islands "
Aristophanes merely means theAthenian Empire.
"Αλλων is of course used in that redundant way, which Elmsley, ad Oed.
Tyr. 7, illustrates by citing this passage and Plato's Gorgias (473 C), ὑπὸ τω̑ν πολιτω̑ν Kal τω̑ν ἄλλων ξένων.
This usage of ἄλλος is as old as Homer, Odyssey i. 132 ;

(The Poet, having borrowed so much from the Para­ basis of the Wasps, goes on to borrow this phrase from the Parabasis of the Knights 549, where it is employed in exactly the same sense as here.

This imputation, too, the Scholiast would fasten upon Eupolis.
With the succeeding line com­ pare the opening of the Prologue to the Eunuch of Terence:
Si quisquam est qui placere se studeat bonis Quam plurimis, et minime multos laedere, In his poeta hie nomen profitetur suum.
The Prologue, both on the Roman and on the English stage, discharged an office humbler than, but not dissimilar to, that of the Athenian Parabasis.

THE STROPHE AND ANTI­ STROPHE.
In this hastily constructed Comedy these do not rise to the lyrical elevation attained in the other Plays.
They are mainly little satirical pieces, the first aimed at Carcinus and his sons, the second at two worthless Tragedians, Morsimus and Melanthius.
But in each case the satire is prefaced by 3½ musical lines based on the Choral melodies of Stesichorus.
As regards the strophe, the Scholiast merely says that the commence­ ment ἐστὶ Στησιχόρειος ;
but he sets out the lines adapted in the antistrophe, from which we can see how extremely free the adaptation was.
The correspondence of the strophe and antistrophe is, as Mr. Sharpley points out, very close;
the Stesichorean melody closes at the same syllable (μακάρων and κελαδη̑) ;
Melan­ thins takes the place of Carcinus as a bad tragedian in the corresponding foot of the antistrophe ;
whilst in the two long lines filled with abusive terms (ὄρτυγας—μηχανοδίΦας, and Γοργόνες— ȋχθυολυ̑μαι) each word in the strophe has its exact counterpart metrically cor­ responding to it in the antistrophe.)
The translation is an attempt to repro­ duce the exact metrical system of the original.784. παίδων]
Three sons of Careinus were dancers and one was also a Tragic poet:
their dwarfish ungainly figures, and their extraordinary contortions as they danced in their father's choruses, were constant subjects for the mirth of Aristophanes.
See especially the closing scene in the Wasps where all three are in­ troduced.
They seem to have invented some mechanical contrivances to assist their efforts ;
for Xenocles, who was one of them, is, as the Scholiast observes, called by Plato Comicus Ξενοκλη̑ς ὁ δωδεκαμήχανος, and here we find them all described as μηχανοδίΦας.788.
ὄρτυγας οἰκογενεȋς]
Quails were domesticated in great numbers at Athens, and trained for the sport of ὀρτυγοκοπία, which is described by Pollux ix, Segm.
102,108, 109. (See the Commentary on Birds 1299.)
A ring was drawn round the bird, which was then struck sharply on the head with the finger.
If it stood its ground, its owner won :
if it backed out of the ring, he lost.
Sometimes the game was played for money;
at other times the bird itself was the stake.
Quail-fighting is, or was, much in vogue, Button observes (Wood's translation, xii. 425, &c.), in Italy ;
and also in the East, where, to use the language of Mr. Curzon, in his Armenia, " quails are as plenty as flies."
(Shakespeare, following Plutarch (Antony 33) makes Antony say of Augus­ tus " His quails Beat mine, inhooped, at odds," Ant. and Cleop. ii. 3.) They are game and pugnacious little birds :
" ecce coturnices inter sua proelia vivunt," says Ovid, Amor. ii.
6. 27 ;
but Buffon, who collects much curious information on the subject, remarks that they fight with their own species only, which implies jealousy rather than a temper naturally quarrelsome.
And this seems to agree with the observations of Aristotle, Hist.
Animal, ix.
9. Antiochus, the unlucky lieutenant of Alcibiades, first gained his patron's favour by capturing and re­ storing to him a tame quail, which had escaped from its master's robe in his flurry and delight at the applause which attended his first public appearanceAsk thee to join with his sons in choral dances, Hearken not, come not, stand not As an ally beside them, Think of them all as merely Little domestical quails, ballet-dancers with wallet necks, Nipped from the droppings of goats, small, stunted, machinery-hunters.
Yea, for their father declared that the drama which Passed all his hopes, in the evening
By the cat was strangled.
These are the songs of the fair sweet Graces with beautiful hair,(Plutarch, Alcib. chap. 10).
The Scholiast doubts whether the sons of Carcinus owe their sobriquet of tame quails to their appearance or to their tempers ;
but we may suppose that they were termed quails from their diminutive stature and οἰκογενεῖς because homebred birds were less valuable, as less suited for ὀρτυγ
οκοπία than wild ones.
Athenaeus (ix. 48) ob­ serves that Aristophanes has shortened the υ in ὄρτυγας to suit the metre.
〈γυλι­ αύχενας, wallet-necked.
We cannot tell the precise meaning of this epithet, because we do not know what was the shape of the γύλιος, the soldier's wicker wallet;
see the Commentary on Ach.
1097.
But it was probably twisted in some way so as to accommodate itself to the soldier's person;
so that the allusion here, as infra 864, is to their distorted figures while dancing, νάννος, or as it is more commonly spelled νᾶνος, signifies a mis­ shapen dwarf.
σφυράδες δέ εἰσι τὰ τῶν Scholiast.)795. γαλῆν]
The Scholiast says that Carcinus had composed a Play called " The Mice," which, though esteemed by its author one of his happiest efforts, yet proved a total failure.
Its untimely fate is described, as if it had been in truth the animals whose name it bore, a witticism not dissimilar to that of the Emperor Augustus, who, when asked what had become of his "Ajax" (a tra­ gedy which he had commenced to write, but had afterwards obliterated), replied, " In spongiam incubuit," in allusion to the fate of the hero falling on his sword (πεπτῶτα τῷδε περὶ νεορράντῷ ξίφει, Soph. Ajax 828), Macrobius, Saturnalia ii. 4.797. τοιάδε]
The strophe is immedi­ ately followed by the antistrophe, ἐπεὶ ov κεῖται μεταξὺ τὀ ἐπίρρημα, says the Scholiast.
The opening lines of the antistrophe are adapted from a passage in the Oresteia of Stesichorus, which is arranged by Bp. Blomfield, Mus. Crit. ii.
266, as follows :
And again ὅταν ᾖρος ὥρᾳκελαδῇ

but the MS.
reading is better in itself, and is strongly confirmed by Frogs 682, Eur. Phoen.

"The swallow," says Gilbert White (Selborne ii. 18), " is a delicate songster, and in soft and sunny weather sings both perching and flying, on trees in a kind of concert, and on chimney tops."
Chaucer (Cant. Tales 3257), speaking in praise of a woman's voice, says
But of hire song, it was as loud and yerne
As any swalow sitting on a borne.
Artemidorus (ii. 66) describes the swal­ low's song as ᾆσμα ἐνδοτικὸν καὶκελευ­ στικὸν πρὸς ἔργα.
And he says that, while it is absent, all Nature is stagnant:
σικήν.
A bronze swallow was, therefore, a fit symbol to place over a poet's grave.
See the Vita Sophoclis.801.
χορὸν δὲ μὴ ̉χη̩]
For it was not every play which could be exhibited at the Dionysia, but only the three which the presiding Archon had selected as worthy the allotment of a Chorus and the proper staff of actors.
Thus, merely to be one of the selected exhibitors was in itself a considerable success :
Trapa γὰρ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις, says the Scholiast on Plato's Republic, Book ii ad fin., χοροῦ ἐτύγχανον κωμῳδίας καὶ τραγῳδας ποιηταὶ οὐ πάντες, ἀλλ’ οἱ εὐδοκιμοῦντες καὶ δοκιμασθέντεςἄξιοι.
In Frogs 94 Aristophanes speaks of a multitude of poets, " who get one Chorus, and are heard no more," ἃΦροῦδα θᾶττον, ἢν μόνον Xopov λάβη̩.
And it is said (though it isWhich it well beseemeth

not perhaps quite certain whether in jest or earnest) that on one occasion, at least, Sophocles himself was refused a Chorus (Athenaeus xiv, chap. 43).
In the Republic, ubi supr., Plato is citing from Aeschylus a speech of Thetis, ex­ pressing sentiments which the philoso­ pher esteems unworthy of a heavenly speaker;
and he says that, if a poet uses such language as this about the Gods, we will take it ill, καὶ χαρὸναὐ δώσ
ομεν.802.
Μόρσιμ
ος—Μελάνθιος]
This is not the only occasion on which these two sorry tragedians are assailed by Aristo­ phanes.
"
If I hate thee not, set me to learn a play of Morsimus," say the Chorus to Cleon (Knights 401), by way of imprecation.
And in Frogs 151, those who have transcribed a speech of Morsimus are classed in the shades below with parricides, perjurers, and the worst of villains.
Melanthius is attacked in the Birds, and info 1009 he is mentioned as a glutton, which explains the use of the epithets ὀψοΦάγοι ἰχθυο­ λῦμαι below.
(Indeed he was so notorious for his ἰχθυοΦαγία that Archippus in his Comedy of the ’Ιχθῦςdepicted him as cast to the fishes, to be, in his turn, devoured by them (Athenaeus viii, chap. 30, p. 343 C) ;
an act of retributive jus­ tice in which, upon the principles of the philosopher Demonax, he ought to have cheerfully acquiesced.
For when De­ monax was embarking on a perilous voyage, and some friend warned him that he would probably be food for fishes, "And very unreasonable I should be," replied the philosopher, "if I who have devoured so many fishes, should object in my turn to be devoured by them."
Κάρτα (so I read for the κᾆτα of the MSS. and edd.)
ἀγνώμων ἄν εἴην, ὀκνῶν ὑπὸ ἰχθύων καταδασθῆναι, τοσούτους αὐτὸς ἰχθῦς καταΦαγών.—Lucian, Demonax 35.〉
The general, though by no means the universal, opinion of modern editors is that Morsimus was a brother of Melan­ thins, and is the person here spoken of as ἁδελΦὰς, but the Scholiasts do not favour this view, and we have no data for determining the question.815.

During the fore­ going Parabasis the upper stage together with the statue of Peace is withdrawn, and the scene again, as at first, repre­ sents the exterior of the house of Trygaeus.

As there observed, he is the steward or confidential attendant of Trygaeus, and in that character he co-operates with his master during the remainder of the Comedy.
The Second Servant, whose business it was to feed the beetle, left the stage when that duty was performed, supra 49, and returns no more.)825. τί 6' ἔπαθες ;

The word ἀνοβολὰς in the next line is universally translated "preludes," but it would seem from Aristotle's Rhetoric, iii.

as applied to dithyrambic poetry, it in­ volves the idea of a long, continuous, rambling ode, unconfined by stanza or strophe, and terminating only with the termination of its subject.

εἶτ’ ἀερίας, διερὰς, γαμψοὺς οἰωνοὺς ἀερονηχεῖς, Clouds 337 ;
ἀέρια καὶ ακότιά ye καὶ κυαναυγέα, Birds 1389.
The final τινὰς throws an air of indefiniteness about the description ;
and as to its following the article, τὰς, at the commencement of the line, Paley refers to Oed. Tyr. 107, Oed. Col. 289.)832. ἃ λέγουαι]
Various passages bearing on this notion are collected by Sir George Cornewall Lewis, in his treatise on the Astronomy of the An­ cients, chap.
v, sec. 15. It seems to have been a mere poetic fancy, and not a philosophic doctrine.836.
Ἀοῖον]
Referring, the Scholiast says, to an ode which Ion of Chios (who seems to have died shortly before the date of this Play) had composed, and which commenced The Star o' the Morn we awaited, The Star through the atmosphere floating, The white-winged herald of Day.
Bentley (Epistle to Mill, ii. 304-31, Dyce) throws a flood of light on the writings of Ion of Chios and discusses this fragment in particular.
SERVo
Then 'tisn't true what people say about it, That when we die, we straightway turn to stars ?
TRYG.
0 yes it is.
SERVo
And who's the star there now ?
TRYG.
Ion of Chios, who on earth composed “ Star o' the Morn,” and when he came there, all At once saluted him as “ Star o' the Morn."SERV.
And did you learn about those falling stars
Which sparkle as they run ?
TRYG.
Yes, those are some
Of the rich stars returning home from supper, Lanterns in hand, and in the lanterns fire.
But take this girl at once, and lead her in;
Deluge the bath, and make the water warm;
Then spread the nuptial couch for her and me :
And when you've finished, hither come again.
Meanwhile I'll give this other to the Council.

Whence have you brought these maidens ?
TRYG.
Whence ?
from heaven.

Modern science has had great difficulty in answering the servant's question;
but it seems now to be es­ tablished that they are small planetary bodies revolving round the sun, which entering the earth's atmosphere with inconceivable velocity become ignited by the friction and dissolve into fiery vapour.843. ὕδωρ]
The water in which the brides of Athens bathed was drawn from the fountain originally called Callirrhoe, and afterwards Enneacrounos (Thuc. ii. 15 ;
Pollux iii, segm. 43).
The bride with reference to whom these directions are given is, of course, Harvesthome :
Mayfair is to be delivered to the Council.848.
τριώβολον]
(This was a symbol of worthlessness.
Of. Plutus 125.
This use of the word passed from the Greeks to the Latins, with whom homo trioboli, and still more homo non trioboli, signified an absolutely worthless fellow, Plautus, Poenulus i. 2. 168, ii. 17 ;
Rudens v. 2. 43 and 67, 3. 11. It is frequently used by St. Chrysostom, generally in the form τριωβολιμαῖος. In Horn. xxi in Eph. (162 C) Greek cynics are styled τριωβολιμαῖοι ἄνδρες, ΦιλοσοΦίαν ἀναδεξά­ μενοι τριωβολιμαῖον. So in Horn. xxxvii in Matth. (421 D) ἄνθρωποι μαστιγίαι καὶ τριωβολιμαῖοι ;
and in Horn. lxiii in Matth. (633 D) τριῶν ὀβολῶν οὐκἂν ἔΦην ἀξίους εἶνοι τοὺς οὕτω πλουτοῦντας.)850. οὔκ, ἀλλά]
The ἀλλὰqualifies the universality of the negative ;
see the note on Wasps 9, " No, they don't do that:
yet, even there, some get their living by these girls."
Ἀπὸτούτωνιs explained by Richter to be ἀπὸτῶν πορ­ νῶν vel τοῦ πορνοβοσκεῖν, but no doubt it refers to Harvesthome and Mayfair, and to the offerings made to the Gods in the times of vintage, and on the occasion of public spectacles:
just as both in the Birds 1514-20, &c., and in the Plutus 1114-23, &c., the Gods are represented as depending for their very existence upon the sacrifices offered upon their altars.854.
ἀμβροσίαν λείχειν]
(Trygaeus em­ ploys the word λείχειν in its ordinary sense of lapping up, eating ;
Knights 1089, Wasps 738.
The servant in the following line diverts it into a coarse allusion ;
είς τὸ κακέμΦατοντῆς πόρνης λέγεται, as the Scholiast says.

No, no :

(The Servant, who had left the stage at the commence­ ment of the foregoing system to take Harvesthome to the bath, now returns to say that his mission is accomplished.
We should have expected that the mar­ riage would immediately take place, but instead of that the subject is altogether dropped for more than 300 lines, and only reappears in the closing scenes of the Play.)869. σησαμῆ]
The sesame-cake was (from the prolific qualities of the sesame, διὰ τὸ πολύγονον, Menander apud Schol.) selected as the recognized wedding-cake at Athens.
ἐν τοῖς γἀμοις ἐδίδοσαν σησα­ μῆνἐπεὶπολυγονώτατονσήσαμον.—Photius.
Our old custom of throwing rice at weddings was founded on the same idea.874.
Βραυρῶνάδ’]
Brauron was an Attic deme, frequently mentioned by old authors, and almost always in con­ nexion with the great quinquennial fes­ tival which the Athenian women cele­ brated there in honour of Artemis, and from which she derived her name of Brauronia (Hdt. vi. 138;
Aristoph.
Lysist. 645 and the Commentary there ;
Eurip. Iph. in Taur. 1464 ;

Pollux vii, segm.

Pausanias i, chap. 33, viii, chap. 46 ;
Suidas, sub voc. ἄρκτος, and frequently elsewhere).
Nor can I doubt that Ari­ stophanes is here alluding to that re­ nowned festival.
The statement of the Scholiast here, ἐκεῖ τὰ Διονύσιαἤγετο, Kal μεθύοντες πολλὰς πόρνας ἥρπαζον, is unsup­ ported by any authority (for Suidas, sub voc. Βραυρὼν, and the Scholiast on Demosth.

Come then and let us give Mayfair at once Up to the Council.
SERV.

Mayfair !
Is this May Fair ?
the Fair we kept at Brauron, When we were fresh and mellow, years ago ?

Aye, and 'twas work enough to catch her.
SERVo 0 !
How neat her pasterns, quite a five-year-old.
TRYG.
(Looking round upon the audience.)
Now, have you any there that I can trust ?
One who will lead her safely to the Council ?
(To the servant.)
What are you scribbling ?
SERVo Marking out a placehis words);
and, although adopted by every editor of Aristophanes, and ap­ proved by Hemsterhuys on Pollux ix, segm.
74, seems to me a mere unfounded suggestion made in forgetfulness of the great festivities which really brought Athenian women to the little borough of Brauron.
The word πρωκτοπεντετηρίδα, info 876, refers to the circumstance that.
the festival was a quinquennial one.
(In the 54th chapter of the Polity of Athens we have a list of all the quin­ quennial festivals controlled by Athens.
The list includes the Brauronia, but does not include any Dionysian festival ;
a cir­ cumstance which appears to prove con­ elusively the view taken in this note.
Instead of saying ἐπέμπομεν (scil. τὴν παμπὴν) Βραυρῶνάδε, the speaker, adapt­ ing his language to the Mayfair on the stage, and regardless of grammar, says ἐπαίαμεν (infra 898) Βραυρῶνάδε.
The Scholiast explains ἐπαίαμεν by συνουσιά­ ζομεν, ἠλαύναμεν.
And had the speaker said ἠλαύναμεν (Eccl. 39) his language would have been more grammatical, but less suited to the festival, and less simi­ lar to ἐπέμπαμεν.〉879. εἰς ”Ισθμια]
This passage, though generally misunderstood by the com­ mentators, is clearly explained by the Scholiast.
While Trygaeus is speaking to the audience (to whom the pronoun ὑμῶν, two lines above, refers), the servant seizing the opportunity, τῷ δακτύλῳ περιγράφει, draws a line with his finger round τὰ ἰσχία, so as to include τὸ αἰδοῖον, τη̂ς Θεωρίας.
Being asked what he is doing, he explains that it is there he wishes to pitch his tent at the approaching games, εἰς "Ισθμια.
He selects the Isthmian games, partly, perhaps, with a pun upon ἰσχία, and partly for the reason given by the Scholiast, viz., that the space at those games being very confined, people were accustomed to take places for their tents some time beforehand.
At those games, too, the Athenians enjoyed certain rights of πραεδρία.
See Plutarch's Theseus, chap. 25.
For τὸ δεῖνα see on 268 supr.883. 'Αριφράδης]
The same bestial habit is imputed to Ariphrades, in Knights 1285 and Wasps 1283.
With the phraseology here employed compare supr. 716 and 855.
In its better sense ζωμὸς is used both here and supr. 716 of the broth consumed ἐν ταῖς θεωρίαις.886. σκεύη]
Mayfair seems, as the Scholiast observes, to have brought with her certain symbols of peace and hus­ bandry" ;
possibly, amongst them, a small ὀπτάνιον, info 891;
unless the word is there used solely, as no doubt, it is mainly, πρὸς TO κακέμφατον, with a jest somewhat similar to that in Wasps 1373-5.887.
βουλή]
In the Athenian, as in the Roman, theatre a distinct place was assigned to the Senate;
aud I imagine that, in this address, Trygaeus advances with Mayfair to that part of the stage which is nearest to the senatorial benches (TO βουλευτικὸν, Birds 794, and the Scholiast there).
In the address itself Θεωρία is considered, as she has already been in more passages than one, in a double aspect, as a woman and as a public spectacle ;
and ἄπαντα, says theTo pitch my tent in, at the Isthmian games.
TRYG.
Well, is there none can take her?
come to me then;
I'll go myself, and set you down amongst them,SERVo Here's some one making signs.
TRYG.
Who is it ?
SERVo Who!
Ariphrades :

TRYG.
No :
I can't bear his dirty sloppy way.
So come to me, and lay those parcels down.
(Leads her forward towards the βουλευτικόν.)
Councillors !

And 0 remember what a deal of fun
That word implies:
what pastimes and what feasts.

'Tis blacked a little:
for in times of Peace The jovial Council kept its saucepans there.
Take her and welcome her with joy;
and thenScholiast, ὡς ἐπὶ συναυσίας σχημάτων καὶ θεωρίας λέγεται.
There is, unfortunately, abundance of material in both Greek and Roman literature for illustrating in all its details the grosser meaning of the passage.
But I have purposely con­ fined my translation (if the vague para­ phrase I offer be worthy of the name) to the description, which the poet intends also to give, of the legitimate amuse­ ments afforded by a public spectacle :
πάσας yap πανηγύρεις θεωρίας ἐκάλαυν.
And, so far as seemed practicable, I have done the same with the Commentary.890.
καταγαγεῖν 〈'Ανάρρυσιν]
'Ανάρρυσις, the Day of Sacrifice, was one of the Apa­ turian feast days, deriving its name from ἀναρρύειν, to sacrifice, literally, to draw back the victim's head for the purpose "Ομηρος (Iliad i. 459) αὖ ἔρυσαν.-Etymol.

The word καταγεῖν has pro­ bably some unsavoury meaning with re­ gard to Mayfair, and is therefore em­ ployed (instead of ἄγειν or ἀνάγειν) with 'Ανάρρυσιν in the sense of " keeping the feast.")—Scholiast.
λάσανα, we are told by the Scholiast and other grammarians, are the same as χυτρόποδες, little stands on which χύτραι were set over a fire that their contents might be boiled or warm-898.
πὺξ μου̂κ.τ.λ.]
Trapa τὸ λεγόμενον '' πὺξ ὁμου̂ καὶ τῷ σκέλει," Scholiast;

He has provided therefore for a three days' fes­ tival (to-day, to-morrow, and the day after), in accordance with his prognosti­ cation supra 716.
Notwithstanding the mention of the 'Ανάρρυσις supra 890, it seems impossible to identify these three days with the days of the Apatiuia.
〉908.
ἐκεχειρίαν]
This is rightly ex­ plained by the Scholiast to mean that, unless you bribed the Prytanis, he would say, " 'Tis a holiday, we can intro­ duce nothing into the Senate to-day," ἐκεχειρία ἐστὶν, οὐ δυνάμεθα σήμερ
ον εἰυά­ γειν, while all the time he would be holding out his hand for a fee, παίζει πρὸς τὸ ἄχειν TL ἐν τῃ̂ χειρὶ, πρὸς TO ὑπέχεινTo-morrow morning let the sports begin :
Then we'll enjoy the Fair in every fashion, With boxing-matches and with wrestling bouts, And tricks and games, while striplings soused in oil Try the pancratium, fist and leg combined.
Then the third day from this, we'll hold the races;
The eager jockeys riding :
the great cars Puffing and blowing through the lists, till dashed Full on some turning-post, they reel and fall Over and over:
everywhere you see
The hapless coachmen wallowing on the plain.
You lucky Magistrate, receive Mayfair !
Just look, how pleased he seems to introduce her ;
You would not though, if you got nothing by it, No, you'd be holding a Reception day.

Truly we envy your fate :
All must allow you're a great Blessing and boon to the state.

πολίταις]
I had changed the common reading πολίτης into πολίταις before I was aware that the same obvious emendation had been proposed by Hermann, and accepted by Weise, Holden, Bergk, and Meineke.
The word τρυγα̂τε, two lines below, refers to the name of the speaker.

TOp δημότην] 〈δημάτης, in states which were not democracies, signified a common person as contrasted with the ruling person or class, but it was never so used by Athenians of Athenians.

Throughout these scenes the Chorus is a mere looker-on, and not an active participator in the work.923.
χύτραις ἱδρυτέαν]
Harvesthome and Mayfair being thus disposed of, the next duty which devolves upon Trygaeus is that of inaugurating the worship of Peace Restored, ταύτην, and he has now to decide upon the votive offerings to be used for that purpose.
The first suggestion is an offering of χύτραι, that is, of earthen pots filled with vegetables, boiled pulse, and the like :
a memorial and thank-offering, says the Scholiast, both here and at Plutus 1198, for man­ kind's primitive diet, εὐχαριστήρια ἀπανέ­ μοντες τη̂ς πρώτης διαίτης.
This offeringCHOR.
Nay, but already 'tis known;
Yea, for already we own You have preserved us alone.
TRYG.
I think you'll think so when you drain a bowl of newmade wine again.
CHOR.
We'll always hold you first and best, except the Gods the ever blest.
TRYG.
In truth you owe a deal to me, Trygaeus, sprung from Athmonè, For I've released the burgher crew And farmers too From toils and troubles not a few ;
Hyperbolus I've done for.
SERVo
Now what's the next thing that we have to do ?
TRYG.
What but to dedicate her shrine with pipkins ?
SERV.
With pipkins !
like a wretched little Hermes !
TRYG.
Well then, what think you of a stall-fed bull ?is, however, at once rejected, as un­ worthy the occasion, and fit only for a μεμΦάμεναν ‛Ερμίδιον, where μεμΦάμενον is said to mean " fretful, grumbling at the vileness of his offerings."
In the Plutus ubi supr. the offering of χύτραι is adopted, and the χύτραι αἷς τὰν few ἱδρυσάμεθα are carried off by the old beldame ;
seem­ ingly for the purpose of introducing a poor pun upon the word γραυ̂ς, which (something like our word mother) may designate as well the scum which is usually on the top of the pots as the old woman who is pro hac vice, below them.
See the lines from Aristoph.
Danaides to which the Scholiasts both here and on the Plutus refer, (and which are cited in the Commentary on the Plutus.)
The offering to Hermes of a pot containing various vegetables was made on the third day of the Anthesteria which was thence called at χύτραι, Schol. at Ach. 1076, Frogs 218.925. λαρινῷ] (well-nourished, stall fed.
Athenaeus (ix. 18, p. 376 B) says that λαρινὰς is strictly an epithet λαρινῶν βοῶν, and offers three derivations of the word :
(1) from λαρινεύεσθαι, to be fattened, and he quotes from Sophron βάες λαρινεύαν- Tnt ;
(2) from a village in Epirus, called Larina ;
and (3) from their herdsman Larinus who is said to have obtained from Heracles the cattle of Geryon.
Photius says that Apollodorus called τοὺς εὐτραΦεῖς βαυ̂ς λαρινοὺς, λαρινεύειν γὰρ TO σιτεύειν, and he himself explains Xa­ ριναὶ by ot πίανες, σιτισταὶ, λιπαροί.

βοηθεῖν]
There is, of course, a play upon these words, which I have endeavoured to reproduce in my trans­ lation as between bulwarks and bull-works.930. 'Ιωνικόν]
That is, says the Scholiast, in its disyllabic form.
The Attics pronounced it as a monosyllable, οἶς.
In the succeeding lines I have followed the reading of the older editions, except that I have substituted εἰ 'v for ὲν.939. ὡς πάνθ']
This line does not answer to the first line of the corre­ sponding system, infr. 1023, σέ rot θύρασι χρὴ μένοντα τοίνυν, and (in my former edition I suggested that we should here read ὡς πάνθ' ὃσ'ἂν θέλῃ τύχη κατορθου̂ν.
But the conjunction of θεὸς (or δαίμων) and τύχη is so common that it seems im­ possible to dispense with either idea.
SERV.
A bull ?
0 no !
no need of bull-works now.
TRYG.
Well then, a great fat pig ?
SERVo
No, no.
TRYG.
Why not?

TRYG.
What other victim shall we have ?

TRYG.
A baalamb!
SERV.
Yes, by Zeus!
TRYG.
But that's Ionic, That word is.
SERVo
All the better:
then, you see, If any speak for war, the whole assembly Will talk Ionic and cry out Bah!
Bah !
TRYG.
Good, very good.
SERVo
And they'll be milder so, And we shall live like lambs among ourselves, And be much gentler towards our dear allies.
TRYG.
There, get the sheep as quickly as you can, I'll find an altar for the sacrifice.
CHOR.
Sure each design, when God and fortune speed it, Succeeds to our mind, what is wanted we find Just at the moment we need it.
TRYG.
The truths you mention none can doubt, for see I've brought the altar out.
CHOP.
Then hasten the task to perform :
War, with its vehement storm, Seems for the instant to cease;
Its soughings decrease, Shifting and veering to Peace.
TRYG.
Well, here's the basket ready stored with barley grain, and wreath, and sword.942. βωμός]

In the Acharnians (866) Aristophanes calls the Theban pipers Χαιριδεῖς βομβαύλιοι, and the Scholiast there says that Chaeris was an αὐλητὴς Θηβαῖος ἄμουσος. And cf. Birds 858.
The Thebans were noted in ancient times for their skill on the αὐλός.
The Athenians disliked it, preferring such instruments as left the musician's voice free. "
Let the young Thebans pipe," said Alcibiades, " for they can't talk."
Αὐλείτωσαν Θηβαίων παῖδες.
οὐ yap ἴσασι διαλέγεσθαι (Plutarch, Ale. cap. 2).
And so Maximus Tyrius, running through the specialities of different peoples, says σπουδὴ, τέχνη 'Αττική. (Diss. xxiii, see. 2).
And it would seem from Words­ worth's Athens and Attica, chap.
3, that the local reputation is still main­ tained, and that the Boeotian pipers are still in request at the neighbouring festivities.956. ἄγε δή]
The servant returns with the victim, and all is now ready for the sacrifice.
The altar has been erected, the fire is there, the knife is concealed in the basket beneath the garlands and the grain.
Trygaeus hurries through some of the indispensable preliminaries.
And first he sends the servant round theAnd here's the pan of sacred fire :

(So in Iph.
Aul.
1568 we are told that when Calchas had placed the knife in the basket (see on 948 supra)960. σείου σὺταχέως]
These words are addressed to the victim, as Trygaeus sprinkles him with water from the dripping brand, ἵνασείσητὴνκεφαλὴν, says the Scholiast, καὶἐπινεύειν τοι̑ςἱεραι̑ς δακη̑,that he may nod his head, and so seem to assent to his own immolation.
This was esteemed a favourable omen.
Abp. Potter (Antiq.
Book ii, chap.
4) refers to Plutarch, de Orac. Defect.
436, where it is said that the priests were accustomed to sprinkle the victim, Kat τὴν κίνησιν αὐτου̑ἀποθεωρει̑ν,and to the Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, i. 425, who, explaining the word πραχύτας,saysἐπινεύειντὸἰερει̑ον.Grain, as well as water, was sprinkled on the victim's head.961.
χερνίπτου]
That it was deemed absolutely necessary to wash the hands, before presuming to offer sacrifice to the Gods, is shown in numberless pas­ sages from Homer downwards;
and instances were recorded of the divine judgement which had, it was said, at once overtaken the impious wretch who had approached the altar χερσὶνἀνίπτοι­ σιν.
It is to this practice, which found a place in the Mosaic ritual, as well as in the multitudinous sacrificial systems of the heathen world, the clean hands typifying the pure heart, that the Psalmist alludes, when he says (xxvi.

I have translated it literally, though the double meaning of the English word “corn” is of course very different from that of the Greek word κριθή.968.
τίςτη̑δε;
]
It appears from the Scholiast that, before the prayers com­ menced, the officiating priest (or rather perhaps the κη̑ρυξ) addressed the con­ gregation with the words τίςτη̑δε;
Whom have we here?
To which they replied, πολλοὶκἀγαθοί,that is to say, "We are all pious worshippers ;
there is no pro­ fane person amongst us."
The guilty had to withdraw from the sacred place :
I'll hold the bason while you wash your hands.
Now throw the corn amongst the audience.
SEE V. There.
TRYG.
What!
thrown it out already ?
SERVo Yes, by Hermes !
There's not a single man amongst them all But has at least one corn, I'll warrant you.
TRYG.
Aye, but the women ?
SERVo
If they haven't got one, They'll get it by and by.
TRYG.
Now, then, to prayers :
Who's here ?
where are our honest simple folk ?
SERVo Here:
these are simple folk;
I'll give to them.
TRYG.
What, these good simple folk ?
SERVo I'faith I think so;
Who, though we've poured such lots of water on them, Yet stand stock still, and never budge a step.
TRYG.
Come, let us pray, no dallying ;
let us pray.
O
Peace most holy, august, serene, O heavenborn queenthey could take no part in the prayers, ὲκὰς ἑκὰςἐστὲβέβηλοι.
The congregation being thus sifted were, it would seem, sprinkled with holy water from the dripping brand (see on 959 supra), and the prayers began.969.
τοιοδί] τοι̑ςχρευται̑ς.—Scho­ liast.
The servant presses the chorus into the ceremony, in the character of a congregation, and plentifully besprin­ kles them with water, which they, it seems from 972 inf., huddle together to avoid.973.
ἀλλ’ὡςτάχιστ’κ.τ.λ.]
(Almost all recent editors, following a suggestion of Bentley, divide this line into two, giving the first four words to Trygaeus, and the last two either to the Chorus or to the Servant.
There is much to be said in favour of this course ;
but on the whole it seems to me that μεθαιs not a word to be passed by one speaker in the dialogue to another;
it is the solemn formula of exhortation to be pronounced only, so to say, by the officiating min­ ister :
see 435.
In this case Trygaeus is officiating.
He had already, six lines above, said εὐχώμεθαand, a slight inter­ ruption having occurred, he now repeats, somewhat impatiently, aλλ’ὡςτάχιστ’ εὐχώμεθ’,let us get to our prayers at once;
and again pronounces the exhortation εὐχώμεσθαδή.
That solemn phrase of ritual could, in my opinion, be pro­ nounced only by the person about to lead off the prayer ;
and so, Trygaeus having again said "Let us pray," immediately commences the prayer.)983. προσέχῃ TOP νου̑ν]
This expres­ sion is constantly used by the Attic writers (especially by Plato and Aristo­ phanes) in the general sense of “paying attention to " what is being said or done.
But it is thought that (like the corre­ sponding English phrase) it has a more special application in reference to lovers.
See Hemsterhuys on Lucian's Deor.
Dial. v, and to the passages there cited add Lysias, de caede Erastosth.

The Latins used “animum adjicere" in the same sense, Plautus, Mil. Glor. iii. 3. 35, Mercator ii. 2. 62 ;
Terence, Eun. i. 2. 63.) I doubt, however, if Hemsterhuys is right in considering the line before us to be an example of that special signifi­ cation.

Indeed the ex­ clusion of Megarian goods from the Athenian markets was not only prior to that war, but was in some sense the cause of it.
And although 13 may oc­ casionally be employed to denote an in­ definite number (see the Commentary on Plutus 1082), it could not be used to describe such a precise and well-known period as the duration of the Archidamian War.)
The date of this Play is con­ sidered in the Introduction.997.
πάλινἐξ ἀρχη̑ς]
(This is a very common combination.
Cf. infra 1327, Frogs591, Plutus 221,866;
Plato, Theae­ tetus 30 (p. 187A), Laches 27 (p. 197 E), &c. So Eusebius (Mart. Pal. ix.

We have al­ ready, supr. 246, seen that garlic was one of the chief productions of the Megarid.
It was thence, too, that the Athenian markets were supplied with their cucumbers and their χλανίσκια.
See Acharnians 519-22.
These χλανί­ σκια,called also ἐξωμίδες,were in truth the staple manufacture at Megara.

I do not know that any part of Hellas, except Boeotia (Ath. xiv. 64), was specially noted for an abundance of pomegranates ;
but it seems exceedingly probable that in this first group of arti­ cles Aristophanes is referring exclusively to the products of Megara and the Pelo­ ponnese, and no doubt pomegranates, too, were obtainable from those regions also.1004.
χη̑ναςκ.τ.λ.]
A very similar, but more complete, enumeration of the fish, fowl, and other luxuries, furnished in times of peace by Boeotia to the Athe­ nian markets is given in Acharnians 874-80.
(As to the χη̑νας,νήττας,and φάττας, the geese, the ducks, and the wood­ pigeons, see the Introduction to the Birds, pp. I, lxx, and lxxv.
The pigeons may have come, in part at any rate, from Homer's παλυτρήρωναΘίσβην(Iliad ii. 502), where Dodwell also (i. 258) noticed "an incredible number of pigeons."
τροχίλαςwas a generic name including probably the plover (whose special name however was χαραδρίὰς) and certainly the sandpiper, dunlin, curlew, and the like.
See the Introduction to the Birds, p. lxv.)1005.

Once more from Copais to journey with eels, And for us to be hustling, and tussling, and bustling,written on the subject of the Copaic eel, the darling of ancient epicures.
Lurking about the “katavothra,”or subterra­ neous channels (minutely described by Sir George Wheler, Colonel Leake, and others), through which the inland waters of Boeotia are discharged into the sea, these eels attained a prodigious size and fatness.
In Ach.
885, Dicaeopolis in­ vokes the Copaic eel in strains which a lover might address to his mistress, or a worshipper to his divinity ;
and Athe­ naeus (vii. 52-6) preserves many similar passages from the comic poets in eulogy of this " Helen of the dinner-table," this “holy divine Virgin of Copais."
In Lysistrata 35, where one speaker imprecates destruction on all the inhabi­ tants of Boeotia, the other at once inter­ poses with a saving clause, " except the eels."
And see line 702 of the same Play.
Some connoisseurs, indeed, pre­ ferred on the whole the eels of other waters, but none were cold to the charms of the Copaic eel.
Thus the Sicilian Archestratus, in his hexameter poem on the Art of Cookery, whilst patriotically claiming the first place for eels caught in the Straits of Messina, yet admits that Bards with abundance of rhyming Justly have sung the praise
Of the eels of Copais and Strymon.
Fine fat beauties are they;
Ah well!
in my conscience I feel Whatever a person may say, There's nothing so good as an eel.
An eel is the primest of dishes, The virgin and queen of the fishes.μεγάλαιτε γάρ εἰαιΚαὶτὸ πάχοςθαυ­ μασταί.—Athenaeus vii. 53.
And travel­ lers in every age have, from their per­ sonal experience, celebrated the Copaic eels;
from Pausanias, who says that they are μεγέθειμέγισται Kai ἐσθίεινἥδισται (ix. 24) down to Mr. Hughes and others, in recent times, who describe them as " of an extraordinary size, firm in flesh, and of a delicious flavour."
〈σπυρὶς is the proper word for a fish-basket or creel.
In the 25th epigram of Leonidas of Tarentum a fisherman is dedicating his ἰχθυδόκουςσπυρίδαςand other fishing implements to the Lord of his craft.)1008.
Μορύχῳ]
In the passage from the Acharnians, referred to in the preceding note, the eel is described as φίληΜορύχῳ.
Morychus is again men­ tioned as an ὀψοφάγοςιn Wasps 506.
And “the Morychian ”—ἡ Μορυχία— which Plato speaks at the commence­ ment of the Phaedrus, is thought to be “a species of luxurious hotel, so called from this notorious voluptuary.”—Sewell's Dialogues of Plato, chap. xxiii ;
Ruhnken's Timaeus, sub voc. Μορυχαία;
Ast on Plato ubi supr. Morychus and Glancetes are coupled together as well- known epicures by Plato Comicus (see the Scholiast on Clouds 110) :
and Glaucetes is mentioned as a devouring whale in Thesmoph.
1033.
Teleas is satirized in the Birds, but not in the special character of a glutton.
For Melanthius see the note on 802 supr.1014.
τεύτλοισι]
The epicure had been picturing to himself a delicious eel upon his dinner-table, half concealed by the beet amid which it lay snugly ensconced. "
That eels when dressed for the table were enveloped in beet, is plain," says Athenaeus, vii. 56, "from many passages in the ancient comedians,'' and he proceeds to cite two extracts from Eubulus, in which the eel is described as a beautiful maiden, with a mantle of beet thrown round her.
One is from his Echo :
—
Whitefleshed, tender, and sweet, Behold the immaculate virgin, Wrapped in her robes of beet, In peerless beauty emerging :
With Morychus, Teleas, Glaucetes, all The gluttons together besieging the stall, To purchase the fish :
and then I could wish For Melanthius to come too late for the fair, And for them to be sold, and for him to despair, And out of his own Medea a groan Of anguish to borrow, “I perish !
I perish! !
bereaved of my sweet, My treasure, my darling, embowered in her beet;
” And for all men to laugh at his sorrow.
These things we pray;
0 mistress, grant us these.

There too were heavenly eels Divinely nourished in Boeotia's lakes Robed in their beet.
The practice of garnishing eels with beet is noticed in Acharn.
894, and by Phere­ crates apud Pollux vi, Segm.
59. (Boeotia seems to have furnished the finest beets as well as the finest eels.
The beet which came from Ascra (Hesiod's birthplace) was in special request.
Clement of Alexandria, Paeda­ gogus ii. 1, § 3, p. 164.)
The beet was said to act as a corrective to certain unwholesome properties of the fish.
See Badham's Ancient and Modern Fish­ tattle, chap. 17.
In the Medea of Melanthius, from which this and the preceding line are borrowed, the phrase may have been τα̑ςἐνΚὀλχοισιλοχευο­ μένας.1020.
οὐδ’αἰματου̑ταιβωμός]
The Scholiast says that unbloody sacrifices were offered to Peace on the festival of the Synoecia, which was held on the 16th of Hecatombaeon, to commemorate (as we learn from Thuc. ii. 15 ;
Plutarch, Theseus, cap. 24) the consolidation by Theseus of the independent Attic com­ munities into the one Athenian state.
(Another altar to Peace was erected by the Athenians after the battles of Eury­ medon and the close of the Persian.
Wars, Plutarch, Cimon 13.)1022. τω̣̂χομηγω̣̂σώζεται]
It is hardly correct to say, with Bothe and Richter, that χορηγω̨̂ιs used 'rapa προσδοκίανfor ἱερει̂ :
the whole expression τῳ̂χορηγῳ̂ σώζεταιιs introduced παρὰπρ
οσδοκοίαν,the audience expecting to hear how the vic­ tim would be sacrificed, and not that the sacrifice would be altogether evaded, so as to spare the pocket of the wealthy citizen, whose allotted task it was to provide the expenses of the Play.
(The Choregus is often mentioned in Comedy.
It is not clear whether Eupolis, in the line cited by Pollux (iii. 115) Ἤδηχορη­ γον πώποτεῥυπαρώτερον| του̂δ’ εἶδες;
is referring to the Choregus of the Comic Play in which the line occurs ;
and Ari­ stophanes (Athenaeus iii. 62, p. 103 F) is certainly not doing so where amongst persons who have experienced vicissi­ tudes of fortune he classes a man who χορηγὸςαἱρεθεὶςΙ ἱμάτιαχρυσα̂ παρασχὼν τῷχορῷ,ῥάκοςφορεȋ.
Nor is he doing so in Ach.
1155. But, if we may judge from the Latin imitations, this was fre­ quently done in the New Comedy.
Thus in Plautus, Persa i. 3. 79, when Toxilus is instructing Saturio to disguise his daughter in a foreign dress, the last- named saysAnd when you have slain it, bring the thighs out here.
There :
now the sheep is-saved for the Choregus.

Stilbides was a celebrated diviner, living at Athens when the Peace was acted.
He pos­ sessed great influence over Nicias, and seems to have exercised it with singular judgement and good sense, so that his death, some time before the fatal close of the Sicilian expedition, was no incon­ siderable misfortune.
ΤῷΝικίᾳ συν­ ἔμπροσθεν.—Plutarch, Nicias, chap. 23.

A vagrant χρησμολόγ

So if an oracle was hard to understand, the χρησμολόγοι, as the professional interpreters, were called upon to expound it.
See Hdt. vii. 142, 143.
The Scholiast says that priests and prophets wore laurel wreaths as the badge of their profession.1054.
η̒ κέρκος ποει̑ καλω̑ς]
These words, which the MSS.
and editions give to Trygaeus, seem to belong to Hierocles.
The Scholiast explains 〈καλω̑ς is the regular word for favourable omens drawn from a sacrifice.
Cyrus, just before the battle of Cunaxa, bids Xenophon report ο̉τι τὰ ι̒ερὰ και̒ τα̒σφάγτα καλὰ ε̉η, Anab. i. 8. 15. Cf. Birds 1118 and passim.)
Hierocles, there­ fore, says, " The tail is going on well," in a sacrificial point of view. "
It is, indeed," observes the servant, referring to the culinary process.1056.
άπάρχαυ] 〈cmmence.
άπάρχσθαι generally means to commence a sacrifice by cutting, and throwing into the fire, the hair from the victim's brow.
But that stage is long passed here;
and Hierocles must be exhorting them to commence the sacrificial feast.)1060.
ὴ γλω̃ττα χωρι̒ς τέμνεται
This formula, which occurs again in Birds 1705 and Plutus 1110, is said to refer to a custom of cutting out the victim's tongue, and keeping it apart till the close of the feast, to be offered with libations of wine to the Herald Hermes, wheu the party broke up to retire to rest.
There are many passages (all of which, I believe, are cited by Florent Chretien and Bergler), in which this custom is mentioned ;
but its origin and meaning were obscure, even to the ancients themselves.
Athenaeus (i, chap. 28) says that the libation was made to Hermes as the patron of sleep, and that the tongue was selected δὰ τὴν έρμηνει̒αν.
Various other explanations of the rite are suggested by the Scho­ liasts on Homer's Odyssey, ii.
332, 341;
on Apollonius Rhodius, i. 517;
and on the above-mentioned passages of Ari­ stophanes ;
as, that it was intended as a sign that what had passed was not to be divulged, or as a peace-offering for any idle word which might have offended the Divine Majesty, or as a memorial of some legendary adventure ;
or the like.1061.
η̉ν φράσης]

This is an Attic colloquialism, fre­ quently used by Plato :

And compare Ach. 833, Plutus 650.1065. χαρ

Though the word may in strictness mean "joy­ ful-eyed," the joy is almost always, in classic Greek, that of the wild beast about to spring upon its prey.

άλωπεκιδυ̑σι]
A very similar phrase is used in relation to the Lacedae­ monians in Lysistrata, 1268 ;
and in the Acharnians, 308, they are described as people οι̉̑σιν ου̉τε βωμὸς ου̉τεπι̉στις ου̉θ’ ο̉ρκος μένει.
The Scholiast refers to Eurip.
Andromache 446 Σπάρτης ε̉νοικοι, δόλιαβουλευτήρια, ψευδω̑να̉νακτες.
Oil these and similar charges brought by Athenian writers against the good faith of Sparta, (see the Commentary on the Acharnians.
Here where the Spartans are described as "foxes " the Athenians masquerade as κέπφοι τρήρωνες, tiviorous petrels.
The κέπφος, our Stormy Petrel, was by the Greeks considered as a synonym for a fool;
ευ̉ηθες ζω̑ον o κέπφος, says the Scholiast;
see Plutus 912 and the Commentary there.
τρήρωνιs in Homer the recognized epithet of the timid dove.
The words κέπφοι τρήρωνες are intended to throw scorn alike on the intelligence and on the courage of Trygaeus and his assistants.

I imagine that Trygaeus, as he says this, is burning his hands with the roasting meat.
Cf. Wasps 918 (and the Commentary there).

The Bakis here referred to was an ancient Boeotian prophet, whom Pausanias describes as a man possessed by the Nymphs—κατάσχετον α̉νδραέκ Νυμφω̑ν (x. 12. 6, cf. Id. iv. 27. 12), which accounts for his being here represented as a medium between the Nymphs and mankind.
His prophecies, which are again mentioned in the Knights and in the Birds, were held in great repute at the time of the Persian war.
Herodotus cites them four times, and always as having been fulfilled to the letter.
Pausanias, too, repeatedly testifies to their veracity.1077.

This line was first supplied by Invernizzi from the Ravenna MS.

σφονδύλη] Schneider on Ari­ stotle, Hist. Animal.
v. 7, collects the various passages wherein the ancient writers have mentioned the σφονδύλη, which appears to have been a sort of beetle.
Kirby and Spence in their 21st letter (" Means by which insects defend themselves ”) enumerate a variety of insects, mostly beetles, which, "when urged by danger, endeavour to repel it by emitting disagreeable scents orftuids."
The common cocktail beetle defends itself in this manner.
"It has the power of throwing out a most disgusting odour, which is penetrating and persis­ tent to a degree, refusing to be driven off even with many washings.

ταυ̑ταδὲ πάντα, says the Scholiast, ε̉πι̒τηδες α̒διαναήτως ε̉φρασεν, τὰ ἀσαφἐςτω̃ν χρησμω̑ν μιμαύμενας.
(So for κύων he substitutes κώδωνὰκαλνθι̒ς, the word κώδων, a bell, bearing some resemblance to κύων, and the sounds produced by its clapper being compared to the noisy yapping of a dog :
ἀκαλανθἰς is properly a goldfinch, see the Introduction to the Birds, p. xliv) ;
but it is here used as an epithet of a dog, παρὰ τὰ αι̒κάλλεινι̉σως τοὺς γνωρίμους, ύλακτει̑νδἐ ταυ̉ςξἐναυς, as the Scholiast on Birds 873 remarks.1082.
κοινη̑ τη̑ς 'Ελλάδαςα̉ρχειν]
This is no mere comic suggestion :
it was much in men's minds at this epoch that Athens and Sparta were in reality coa­ lescing to obtain the joint supremacy of Hellas, and the idea had a powerful influence over the political combinations of the period.
It derived additional force from the significant circumstance that, in the peace which was concluded a few days after the exhibition of this Play, a joint power was reserved to Athens and Sparta, enabling them, without the concurrence of the other Hellenic states, to alter the articles of cf. Id. iv. 20 ;
and Diodorus Siculus xii, chap. 75).
(And some forty years later this joint supremacy of Athens and Sparta was a favourite dream of Isocrates.
See, for example, the early part of his Panegyrical Oration.)1084.
δεπνήσειςὲν πρυτανι̒ῳ]
A din­ ner was served up daily at the public expense, in the Prytaneum, which was considered the domestic hearth of the commonwealth (έστι̒ατη̑ς πόλεως, Pollux ix, Segm. 40), and as such was embellished with consecrated images of Peace aud Hestia (Paus. i. 18. 3).
Hestia was indeed the special patroness of all Prytanea, whence Pindar, in the eleventh Nemean Ode, addresses her as Παι̑ 'Ρέας, ἄ τε ITpv­ τανει̑αλέλογχας, 'Εστι̒α, and speaks of her ἀἐναοιτρἐπεζαι.
The Prytanes for the time being had places, ex officio, at the table (Pollux viii.
155 ;
Ruhnken's Ti­ maeus, sub voc. θόλος ;
Scholiast at Lucian's Prometheus, 4);
and there, too, were entertained foreign ambassadors, successful envoys, and others whom for their public services the State delighted to honour (Pollux ix. 40 ;
cf. Ach. 125 ;
Knights 281, 535, 709, 1404;
Frogs 764).
This was the famous σι̒τησις ἐν Πρυτανεικῳ, so familiar from the Attic orators.
So in Plato's Apology, 36 D, Socrates says to his judges that, if he must fix his own sentence, he should name a σι̒τησις ἐν Πρυστανει̒ῳ, as to a public benefactor;
and Lucian, ubi supr., makes Prometheus say that the benefits which he had conferred upon mankind would have been more aptly recom­ pensed by a σι̒τησις ἐν Πρυτανει̒ῳ than by the vulture and the Caucasus.
For a decree conferring upon some person (the name is lost) a perpetual σι̒τσις έν Πρυτανει̒ῳ, a perpetual προεδρι̒α at the games, and the right of placing his statue in any part of the Agora except beside the statues of Harmodius and Aristogei-HIER.

The Scholiast tells us that this honour was granted to the sooth­ sayer Lampon, and no doubt he very much enjoyed it, if the account given in Athenaeus viii.

And probably he was not the only member of his craft who found his harvest in these times of public anxiety and suspense, and there­ fore of public superstition.1090.
ὥς, οι̒ μέν]
These verses are ex­ temporized by Trygaeus in imitation of the Homeric style and phraseology.
Brunck, Dindorf, and Richter refer to Iliad i. 464, xvi. 301, xvii. 243 ;
Od. vi. 261, vii. 137 ;
for sundry of the expres­ sions and sentences here strung together.
(The phrase νέφος άπςσάμενοι, or its equivalent, is found in other writers.
In Hdt. viii. 109 Themistocles, dissuading the Athenians from intercepting Xerxes at the Hellespont, enlarges on the good for­ tune the Hellenes had experienced νέφος τοσου̑το ἀνθρώπν ἀνωσάμενοι.
Plutarch may have had these passages in his mind when he speaks of Marius telling his soldiers that they were to do battle with the Cimbri and Teutones, not to gain honour and glory for themselves, but chap.
16.) The phrase έγὼς' όδὀν η̒γε­ μόνευον is repeated by Theocritus xi. 27. The κώθωνwas a drinking-cup, much used in the Lacedaemoniau armies;
its interior surface seems to have been broken by sundry ridges, ἄμβωνας, and it was found that, when the soldiers on campaigns were reduced to drink muddy water, these ridges arrested the sediment, and only the clearer water passed over to the drinker's lips.
Such, at least, I take to be the meaning of the description given of this cup by Critias in a passage of his Lacedaemonian Republic, cited both by Plutarch, Lycurgus, chap. 9, and by Athenaeus, xi, 66.1095. Σι̒βυλλα]
It is unnecessary here to discuss the various theories which have been advanced respecting the origin, the history, the books, of the Sibyls;
but I may mention Max Müller's conjecture that Sibylla is derived from sabius, asupposed Italian form of sapiens, and so merely means a wise woman.

(Both Bakis and the Sibyl are mentioned in the Knights ;
and both are bracketed together as χρησ­ μῳδοι̒ in the Theages of Plato, chap. 5 (p. 124D), and are discussed in the thirty- fifth chapter of Aelian's V. H. Book XII, where much learning will be found collected in the notes of Kuhn and Perizonius.

The oracle leaves in uncertainty the object of the kite's swoop;
but the language naturally pointed to the σπλάγχνα (see Birds 892), and Trygaeus alarmed at this, and by the hungry glances which Hierocles is casting at the meat, cautions the servant to be on his guard;
lest Hierocles himself should be preparing to play the part of the symbolical kite.
(The carry­ ing off of sacrificial meats by kites was so common a practice, that Aristotle (DeNone to the soothsayer gave the shining beautiful goblet.

who is carrying off surreptitiously sheep­ skins belonging to Trygaeus or his ser­ vant ;
a strange idea, which though at first sight rather attractive, cannot pos­ sibly be right.
The χρησμολόγος in the Birds has no attendant, nor is it likely that the χρησμολόγος in the Peace would have one.
His entrance is announced (supra 1043-51) in terms which seem to negative the idea that two persons were approaching;
and his exit also (infra 1126) is that of a single individual.
So, two lines below, the bearer of the skins is addressed as ὦ θυηπόλε, an appel­ lation which can be appropriate only to Hierocles.
Nor again is there any reason to suppose that either Trygaeus or his servant had any sheepskins on the stage.)1125. κόραξ]
Can the speaker be in­ tending to compare Hierocles denuded of the skins to the crow (for the fable is told of the crow as well as of the daw) stripped of its borrowed plumes ?
Moveat cornicula risum Furtivis nudata coloribus (Hor. Ep. i. 3. 19).
Or is he merely alluding, as the Scholiast suggests (κό­ ρακαεἶπεν ἐπειδὴ ἥρπαζεν) to the rapacity of the soothsayer, who is still clutching after the σπλάγχνα, not heeding, and as though not hearing (ἤκουσας;
), the servant's objurgations ?
Elymnium is said to have been the name of some small place in the neighbourhood of Oreus.
With these words Trygaeus and the servant leave the stage, driving Hierocles before them.
(Perhaps a better explanation of this line is that offered by Dr. Verrall in Mr. Sharpley's edition, " ‘There's the crow as he came from Oreus’, that is, naked, or nearly so."
Only, one would have thought, had that been his meaning, he would have discarded the unnecessary ἤκουσας and written ὁρα̂τε τὸν κόρακ’.
κόραξ of course really means a raven, not a crow.)1127. ΧΟΡΟΣ]

The Scholiasts give two interpretations of this word :
συμπινων and διάγων.
The former is universally adopted, and is undoubtedly right, for the description of a party sitting round the fire, roasting ἐρέβινθοι (chickpease) and φηγαὶ (which, if not actually chest­ nuts,fagus castanea, were certainly fruit of that class), would be very incomplete without some allusion to the wine-cup.
Thus, Xenophanes of Colophon, cited by Athenaeus in his chapter on ἐρέβινθοι (ii. 44) saysBack to Elymnium !

As to the ἐρέβινθος see the Commentary on Ach.
801. The use of the genitive here implies that the guest retained hold of a part of the pod.
The phraseology, common everywhere, is no­ where more common than in this second Parabasis;

μυρρίνας τω̑ν καρπί

Comarchides is a fit name for the Coryphaeus here, whether it means a leader of the revels (from κω̑μος) or a village magnate (from κώμη).
(It is the name of a rustic letter- writer in Aelian (Ep. 2) and Alciphron (iii. 73).)
So Κωμίας is used in Wasps 230, and there also in connexion with Chariuades.
(The neighbour's speech appears to end with this line, and the rest of the Epirrhema to be the reply of the Coryphaeus.)1147. οἰναρίζειν]
(The leaves of the vine were called οἴναρα ;
and σἰναρίζειν means to prune the vine by stripping off the superfluous leaves which would keep the sun's ripening influence from the grapes.

Ask Aeschinades to send its myrtle branches green and strong;
required at a convivial entertainment.
A myrtle branch was the badge of minstrelsy, passed to each guest as his turn arrived to sing (Plutarch, Sympos. i. 4. 8 ;
see Clouds 1364, and Dicaear­ chus quoted by the Scholiast there).
Myrtle-wreaths, too, were worn by the revellers themselves (Eurip. Alcestis 759) ;
and it would seem that the very couches were sometimes strewn with myrtle ;
thus Plato, Rep. ii. 12 (p. 372 B) κατακλινέντες ἐπὶ στιβάδων ἐστρωμένων μίλακί τε καὶ μυρρίναις ἐπιπίνοντες του̑ οἴνον, and Heliodorus iv.
16 στιβάδος ἣν μυρρίναι καὶ δάφναι τοι̑ς ξένοις ἐστρώκεσαν.
Moreover a thrush has just been ordered (1149 supr.), and that thrushes when served up for the table were garnished with myrtle may, perhaps, be gathered from the lines of Pherecrates quoted at 1197 info With respect to the epithet καρπίμων, myrtles of the fruitful kind," it must be remembered that the fruit of the myrtle was formerly applied to a great variety of culinary and medicinal uses.
See Pliny, Nat. Hist. xiv. 19, xv. 7, 35-8, xxiii. 81-3. Columella (xii. 38) gives some very precise recipes for the manufacture of myrtle wine, some species of which are highly recom­ mended by Pliny as a wholesome bever­ age, very grateful to invalids, and one " which cheers but not inebriates."
Useful oils were extracted from the myrtle :
its leaves and berries were alike esteemed for their healing properties ;
and, before the introduction of pepper, it was in common use as a condiment.
Myrtle-berries, too, seem to have been ordinarily eaten as a fruit.
Athenaeus, more than once, quotes comic fragments in which μύρτα are enumerated among other dainties (ii. 39, iii. 7, xiv. 67, 68);
and one Athenian was said to live on nothing else, Id. (ii. 21).
See also the passage cited from Plato on 1131 supr. and of. supr. 575.
And it appears that " the fruit of the myrtle is eaten by the modern, as it was by the ancient, Athenians.”—Dr. Daubeny, "Trees of the Ancients," p. 94.1159.

Nothing is known of any Cyzicene dye;
and Brunck has introduced into his text Markland's conjecture of χεζικηνικὸν, with which compare Birds 68.
But though, perhaps, the epithet Κυζικηνικὸν was selected as a play upon some derivative of χέζω, yet its more direct reference seems to be to the character of the Cyzicenes, who, accord­ ing to the Scholiast, ἐπὶ δειλία̨ καὶ θηλύτητι ἐκωμω̨δου̑ντο.1177. ξουθὸς ἱππαλεκτρυών]
This un­ lucky phrase, upon which the comic writers fastened with such zest (ὃν ἀεὶ κωμω̨δοι̑σιν, Scholiast) was introduced by Aeschylus in his Play of the Myrmidons (see the Scholiast here, and at Birds 800), as a description of a naval ensign ;
he explains it himself in Frogs 9331178.

This sentence, I imagine, is a quotation, or parody, of some passage unknown:
possibly the one from which Suidas extracts the word λινοπτωμένη, explaining it by λίνον ἁλιέως ψυχόμενον ἐποπτεύουσα. Pollux v, Segm.
17, enumerates the λινόπτης amongst the attendants of the chase, and the metaphor may be drawn from, either the birdcatcher at his nets, the hunter at his toils, or the fisher at his line, wasting the day in fruitless expectation, while the prey he is watch­ ing is escaping unharmed.

The same complaint is made Knights 1369.
Lysias (adv. Nicoma­ chum
3) says that Nicomachus for bribes τοὺς μὲν ἐνέγραΦε τοὺς δὲ ἐξήλειΦεν.
The words ἐξαλείΦεν and ἐγγράΦειν are simi­ larly contrasted by Plato, Rep. vi. 501 C, (and by St. Chrysostom in his thirtieth Homily on St. Matthew (p. 355 A), where he says that in moulding the immortal souls committed to our charge we should spare no trouble, nor shrink from going over the same ground again and again and again.
"See you not," he asks,“how much and how often painters are rubbing out and writing in, πόσα ἐξαλείΦουσι, πόσα παρεγγράΦουαι, and that merely to im­ prove the picture ?
And shall we take less trouble than they ?" See Id. Horn. xi (p. 158 C-E), Horn. xli (p. 450 C).)
And ἐγγράΦειν is used in precisely the same way in the much discussed lines of Aeschylus, Choephoroe 685, 686:
where, as I venture to think, every ex­ positor without exception has gone wrong, from not observing that παρου̑σαν refers to the Family Curse to which the whole speech is addressed.
The death of Orestes proves that the ’Αρὰ is still present at its post, still engaged on active service.

The ten Athenian tribes were named after ten ancient heroes, the ’Επώνυμοι, whose statues were erected in the Agora, at no great distance from the Prytaneum.
They were still standing when Pausanias visited Athens, and he gives a detailed account of them (i, chap. 5), doubting, however, which Pandion it was that gave his name to the tribe Pandionis.
That the proposer of a new law was bound previously to exhibit it on notice boards, ἐν σανίσιν, placed before the Eponymi, is plain from Demosth.

See also the passages referred to in Alberti's note to Hesychius, sub voc. Επώνυμοι.
And here, too, were sus­ pended, in times of war, the special muster-rolls of soldiers called out for immediate service, the list for each tribe being probably affixed to its own Epony­ mus.
See Aeschines, de F.L. 179 (p. 50).
Florent Chretien remarks that Pandionis was the tribe to which Aristophanes himself belonged.

Thrushes were highly prized for the dinner-table, among both Greeks and Romans;
and con­ noisseurs could at once detect from the taste whether the thrush upon their plate was wild or tame, male or female.
See Persius, vi. 24, and the Scholiast there.
Varro, de R. R. iii.

and it was esteemed a singular refinementof luxury, on the part of Lucullus, that fat thrushes could be obtained from his preserves all the year round (Plutarch, Luc. chap. 40, and Pompey, chap. 2).
The judgement of Horace (Ep. i. 15,40), " obeso nil melius turdo," is fully confirmed by Martial, xiii. 92 :

The trierarchs were bound to supply their triremes with the proper complement of rowers.
Whether they had to defray the whole expense out of their own pockets, or whether the Government contributed its quota, is uncertain :
but the better opinion seems to be that they were allowed a certain proportion out of the public treasury, and had to find the residue themselves.
See Boeckh's Public Economy iv. 11.
And it seems that certain trierarchs defrauded the State by supplying an insufficient number of seamen, and stopping up the vacant oar-holes, so that the deficiency might be less apparent to the eye.
Compare the “ dead pays ” of which our old dramatists complain:
Massinger's Unnatural Combat, Act iv, Scene 2, and Gifford's note.
Trygaeus will have an arm through every hole, lest he, too, be found guilty of similar frauds.

And the other actor who represented the Breastplate-seller will shortly return as a Helmet-seller, apparently accompanied by the Spear-burnisher, who in any case would have to be represented by a Chore­ gic actor.)1244. τῶν κατακτῶνκοττάβων]
The σάλπιγξ, a, tall straight instrument, was to be set erect on its broad bell-shaped base (called ή κὠδων, τὸ πλατὺ, and here τὺ κοῖλον, τῆς σάλπιγγος), which was kept steady by being weighted with lead.
A light rod, ῥάβδος, was to be fastened at the top, i.e. at the mouth-piece, of the σάλ­ πιγξ, extending from it at right angles.
There would then be the instrument re­ quiredfor playing thecottabus, which was the art of throwing a few drops of liquid, λάταγες, at a mark with correct and dex­ terous aim.
The Scholiast on Lucian's Lexiphanes, 3 (whose account is gene­ rally accepted as being at all events the most intelligible), says that there were two kinds of cottabus :
(1) the κατακτὸς, and (2) the cottabus δι’ ὸξυβάφων.
And referring to this passage of Aristophanes, he explains the κατακτὸς thus :
-A tall candelabrum-like shaft was set up, to which was attached a small bronze statu­ ette, called Manes (a common name for a slave, cf. supr. 1146).
Above the head of the Manes a little scale, πλάστιγξ or πινάκιον, was suspended from a rod, ῥάβδοςB.S.
Sure, you won't use a forty pounder so.
TRYG.
Why not, you rascal ?
Marry, I suppose
My seat of honours worth eight hundred shillings.
B.S. Well, fetch the silver out.
TRYG.
Plague take the thing;
It galls my stern :
off with you :
I won't buy it.
TRUMPETER.
See, here's a trumpet, cost me two pounds ten:
How in the world am I to use it now ?
TRYG.
I'll tell you how.
Fill up this mouth with lead,
Then fix a longish rod, here at the top, And there you'll have a dropping cottabus.
TRUMPETER.
0 me !
he mocks me.
TRYG.
Heroes another plan :
κοτταβικὴ, and if the wine drops were cleverly flung into this scale, it would fall and strike the Manes with a sharp ringing sound.
The game was of course suscep­ tible of an infinity of modifications, but it would seem by comparing the descriptions given by Pollux vi, Segm.
109,110, Athe­ naeus xv. 4, 5, and the Scholiasts here, that the distinguishing characteristic of the κατακτὸς κότταβος was the dropping or falling scale, ή καταβαλλομένη πλάτιγξ, whilst in the cottabus δι’ ὸξυβάφων there was no scale, but a number of tiny boats, whether with or without lamps, were set afloat upon water, and the object of the player was to submerge as many as pos­ sible with one throw.
Divers complica­ tions were introduced into the κατακτὸς κότταβος for the sake of increasing the amount of skill and ingenuity required.
Sometimes there was a pair of scales, fas­ tened as in a balance, with a bronze sta­ tuette under each, and the wine being thrown into one scale sent it down upon the Manes beneath it, whence it sprang up with a rebound sufficient to drop the other scale upon the other Manes.
Or again, water was placed under each scale, and the wine flung into one scale sub­ merged it beneath the water, until brought up by a cast into the opposite scale.
Or again, the scale, detached, had to strike the Manes at such an angle as to fall into a bason placed below it.
Sometimes the frame that supported the apparatus was a chandelier swinging from the ceiling ;
sometimes the winedrops were not flung from the cup, but squirted from the mouth.
Athenaeus (xv. 1-7 and elsewhere) quotes from the Come­ dians a vast number of pleasant passages illustrative of the game.
In one extract from the ’Αφροδίτης yoval of Antiphanes, all the details of the game and the proper mode of making the throw are very hap­ pily explained to a wondering novice.
The special mention of the πλάστιγξ in connexion with the balance, info 1248, must not be understood as implying that a πλάστιγξ was not also to be employed for the cottabus.

This was a strong purge or emetic, which in certain parts of Egypt the whole population, accord­ ing to Herodotus, took for three con­ secutive days every month.
Συρμαἴξουσι
So in Thesm.
857 Aristophanes speaks of "Egypt's white plains and black-dosed citizens," μελανοσυρμαῖον λεὠν, black- dosed, with an allusion to black-dressed, the syrma being a long trailing robe.
Pour in the lead as I advised before, Then at the top suspend a pair of scales
With little cords, and there's a famous balance
To weigh out figs for labourers on the farm.

Νῦν αὗθ’ όπλοτέρων]
This was he commencement of the Epigoni, one of those epic poems which forming, in con­ nexion with the Iliad and Odyssey, an almost continuous chronicle of the heroic age down to the death of the lastsurvivor of the heroes who conquered Troy, were thence commonly called the Cyclic poems.
It is not known who was the author of the Epigoni:
in the time of Herodotus it was commonly attributed to Homer him­ self, although Herodotus suspected its au­ thenticity, Έστιν ‛Ομήρῳ περὶ ‛Υπερβορέων εὶρημένα ὲν Έπιγόνοισι, εὶδὴ τῷ ὲόντι γε ‟Ομηρ
ος ταῦτα τὰ ἕπεα
έποίησε.-iv. 32. (The author of the Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi says that after that contest Homer travelled about, reciting as well the seven books of the Thebais which commence as the seven books of the Epigoni which commence φασὶ γάρ τινες, he adds, καὶ ταῦτα
Ομήραυ εἶαι.
The παῦσαι with which Trygaeus closes the line is intended to mimic the Μοῦσαι of the original.
See Bentley's Epistle to Mill ii. 322, ed. Dyce.)

TRYG.
Casks?
gladly, I warrant.machus ;
but he is no doubt, as Tyrwhitt (in Kidd's Dawes 530 note) and Brunck observe, confounding the Cyclic poem of the Epigoni with the Thebais writ­ ten by Antimachus of Colophon in a much later age, indeed about the era of the Peloponnesian War.
The Epigoni recorded the second and successful attack which the Argive army, under the com­ mand of Adrastus and the younger war­ riors, the sons of the original Seven, made upon the city of Thebes.
The epithet όπλοτέρων merely signifies "younger," but Trygaeus objects to everything connected with ὅπλα.1273.
oi δ’ ὅτε]
This line occurs eleven times in the Iliad.
σύν ῥ’ἕβαλον ῥινοὺς is found iv.
447, viii. 61, and ὸμφαλόεσσαι is a common epithet of ὰσπίδες, but the two phrases are not conjoined in one line.
Line 1276 is found in iv. 450 and viii.
64. The subsequent lines, though couched in Homeric phraseology, are not actually found in Homer.1280.
καὶ τὰ τοιαυτί]
These words may be in apposition, either with βοῶν κρέα, “ they ate the flesh of beeves and the like," or with the whole preceding clause, " Sing how they feasted and the like."
The latter is the construction universally adopted, and I have, though with some doubt, followed it in my translation.1286.
θωρήσσαντ’]
The boy uses this word in the sense of " they donned their breastplates, ”but Trygaeus understands it in the signification which it not unfre­ quently bears of " they fortified them­ selves with draughts of wine."
A similar play on the double meaning of the word occurs in Ach.
1132-5 to which Bergler refers.1297.
σώφρονος]
Discreet;
with that discretion which, as Falstaff says, "is the better part of valour."
Florent Chre­ tien cites the saying with which Demo­ sthenes excused his flight from the battle- field, ὰνὴρ ό φεύγων καὶ πάλιν μαχήσεται (Aulus Gellius xvii. 21. 9), the original, I suppose, of our familiar rhyme, “ He that fights and runs away, Will live to fight another day.
"And compare Ralph's argument in Hudi­ bras iii.
3. 243. On Cleonymus see the note at 446 supr.1298.
Άσπίδι]
This is the famous elegy of Archilochus (Fragm. 3, Gaisford), the first poet who recorded in verse his own flight, “ relicta non bene parmula," from the field of battle:
and in conse­ quence of which the Spartans, it is said, forbade him to enter their territory.
The lines are as follows :
—Boy I.
"Out from the towers they poured, and the roar of battle ascended."TRYG.
Perdition seize you, boy, your wars and all!
You sing of nought but battles:
who's your father ?
Boy I. Whose?

Boy I. Why, Lamachus.
TRYG.

Alcaeus, who imitated Archilochus in his flight, imitated him also in the unblushing frankness with which he proclaimed his shame.
—Hdt. v. 95. But the fragment, as given (No. 32) in Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci, is almost entirely the composition of Bergk, and contains little which can with cer­ tainty be ascribed to Alcaeus :

Horace made a similar confession, referred to above.
With the reproach κατή̩σχυνας δὲ τοκη̑ας, applied to Cleonymus, compare Aelian, H. A. iv. 1, 'Αριστόδημος ό τρέσας,1300. πόσθων]
On the use of this word to signify a boy, see Scaliger's note on the Asinaria of Plautus iii.
3. 104.1305. νΤΟ λοιπόν]
I fear that these lines will not go far towards re­ deeming the character of the iambic te­ trameter catalectic, of which Mr. Frere, in his translation of the Knights, says that it is so essentially base and grovel­ ling, that he could find no respectable English song to adduce as an example of the metre, until Sir George Cornewall Lewis suggested the sufficiently vulgar but otherwise inoffensive ditty of " Miss Baily " ("A Captain bold of Halifax, who lived in country quarters ") which does in truth give a very tolerable notion of the rhythm of the Greek.1306.
κενὰς παρέλκειν]
We are em­ barrassed here by the very multitude of the substantives which may be ap­ propriately supplied for κενὰς, and between whose claims it is really im­ possible to decide.
Κώπας is suggested by the Scholiast (as if the meaning were, "Dip your oars well in "):
λνάθαυς or σιαγόνας by Florent Chretien and Bergler (the latter comparing κἀργὸυς ἔχειν μηδέποτε τὰς σιαγόνας, Alexis apud Athen. xiv, chap. 49) :
and κύλικας also by Bergler, who cites Antiphanes apud Athen. x. 65 μὴ μεστὰς ἀεὶ ἕλκωμεν.
And see 1131 supra.
Κύλικας is adopted by Bothe also, whose observation, " παρὰ in παρέλκειν vitium actionis signi­ ficat," is, I think, correct, whatever be the word supplied.
But no exhorta­ tion to drinking seems intended here ;
and perhaps a new claimant for the vacant place may be suggested in the person of ναυ̑ς, in which case the metaphor would be drawn from ships hauled up and laid aside as not intended for immediate use :
the converse of such expressions as that of Thucydides ii.

There is not much to choose between κἀπικελεύειν, the read­ ing of the Ravenna MS., and κἀπιχο­ ρεύειν, the reading of the Venetian.
The latter seems rather more appropriate to the occasion (although that circumstance may, no doubt, be urged as affording a greater probability of its interpolation), since it is rare to find either the choruses, or the torches, or the wedding-songs omitted in a description of a marriage procession.
See, for example, the plea­ sant picture which in Lucian's Sea Dia­ logue, No. 15, the West Wind draws for the Wind of the South, of Europa's passage to her nuptial bed across the Mediterranean waters:
"The sea was hushed, and the winds were still, as they gazed upon the scene, and little Loves skimmed lightly over the waves, holding up the lighted torches, ἡμμένας τὰς δα̩̑δας φέροντες, and chanting the hymenaeal song.
The Nereids rose, half-naked from the deep, riding upon their dolphins, and clapping glad welcome with their hands :
whilst all the Triton race, and whatever else the Ocean holds of mild and gra­ cious aspect, danced in happy chorus round about the bride, περιεχόρευε τὴν παι̑δα."
(So again Musaeus (line 274) says of the stolen loves of Hero and Leander:
See, too, Iliad xviii.
490-5;
Hesiod, Scutum 274-7.
I may add from Mr. M. Arnold's Merope a chorus which illus­ trates the subject, and is otherwise appro­ priate to the closing scenes of this Play :
Peace, who tarriest too long;
Peace, with Delight in thy train ;
Come, come back to our prayer ;
Then shall the revel again Visit our streets, and the sound
Of the harp be heard with the pipe, When the flashing torches appear
In the marriage-train coming on, With dancing maidens and boys :
While the matrons come to the doors, And the old men rise from their bench, When the yonths bring home the bride.

And we gather back in abundant store
The many blessings we lost before;
And the fiery steel-be it known no more.

(The remainder of the Play consists entirely of glyconic lines with a monosyllabic base ;
some of them being full (acatalectic) glyconics and others shortened (catalectic) glyconics, it will be observed that the refrain 'Υμὴν, 'Υμέναι' ὦ is catalectic.
In order to make it a full glyconic, Bentley changed the ὦιnto ἰὼ (referring to Catullus lxi who in his glyconic Ode "in nuptias Juliae et Manlii" gives it as Io Hymen, Hymenae' Io. Io Hymen, Hymenaee), and Dawes into 'Υμήν.
But this is ne­ cessary only in the last antistrophe.
It appears to me that the lines are divided into five strophes and antistrophes of un­ equal length :
the last three lines of the Play, the farewell of Trygaeus, standing by themselves.
One line, the third in the first antistrophe, is lost.
The glyconics commence with the welcome of Trygaeus to his bride on her reappearance.>1330.

Mr. Frere, in a note to his translation of the Birds, describes the close of this Play as a rustic Epithala­ mium.

I may perhaps be allowed to close these notes with a translation of one of Catullus's smaller poems (Carm. xxvi) turning upon a legal witticism (for opposita means both exposed to and pledged for) which in (Sir Theodore's) version is hardly brought out with sufficient distinctness to satisfy a legal reader.

and no doubtTrygaeus here, like Praxagora's maid and Blepyrus in the Ecclesiazusae, is giving a general invitation to the spectators to join in the approaching festivities.)
THE Peace is found, in a more or less perfect condition, in eight MSS.
They are :
- R. The Ravenna MS. V. The first Venetian (No. 474, St. Mark's Library, Venice).
I. The Vaticano-Palatine (Pal. No. 67, Vatican Library).
F. The first Florentine (No. 31, 15, Laurentian Library).
p1, The second Parisian (No. 2715, National Library, Paris).
P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717, National Library, Paris).
V2. The third Venetian (No. 475, St. Mark's Library).
D. Havniensis (No. 190, Royal Library, Copenhagen).
A careful collation of the first six MSS.
has recently been published in Zacher's edition.
It was commenced by Velsen who collated R. V. F. and the first 131 lines of I.
The collation of this MS. was completed by A. Wilmanns, " cujus collatio," says Bachmann, " non semper satis accurata videtur."
On Velsen's death the work was continued by Zacher who collated Pl. and P2., but he too died before the edition was ready for publication;
and it was finally revised, and published with a careful preface, by Bachmann.
V2. is said in Bachmann's Preface to be a mere copy of V., and D. to correspond with 1. P2.
The publication of Velsen's collations, and still more the photogravures of R. and V., have shown how inconceivably inaccurate were all previous collations, and I have thought it better to confine myself to the readings given in Zacher's edition, though invariably verifying from the photogravures the readings of those two all-important MSS.
It. and V. are the only MSS.
which give the Play in its entirety.
All the other four omit from 947 to 1012;
and none of them have lines 1355,1356.
F. and Pl. indeed end the Play at line 1300.
And in addition to these gaps F. omits the first 377 lines;
from 490 to 548;
from 837 to 893;
and from 1126 to 1190.
The first printed edition of Aristophanes was that published at Venice by Aldo Pio Manuzio, A.D. 1498, the immediate editor being Marco Musuro, a native of Crete, and afterwards Abp. of Monovasia.
It was at first intended to comprise seven Plays only, the Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, the Knights, the Acharnians, the Wasps, and the Birds.
At the end of the Birds is the following finis:
But before publication the editor had obtained and added to the work two more Comedies, the Peace and the Ecclesiazusae;
so that the Editio Princeps, as published, contained all the Comedies we now possess except the Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae.
Of course we cannot tell with certainty what were the ἀντίγραφα διάφορα from which Musuro collected the nine Plays and their Scholia, but it is generally agreed that he had before him amongst other documents I. or a very similar MS.;
and there is no doubt that for the two additional Comedies he had also Pl. or a duplicate of Pl., since almost all the numerous liberties with the text in which the writer of that MS.
indulges are reproduced in the pages of the Aldine edition.
Probably some of the MSS.
employed by the early editors have ceased to exist:
they would be used as copy for the press and so become soiled and torn;
and might well be cast away as worthless when their contents had been committed to print.
The Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae remained unpublished for seventeen years longer.
But in the year 1515 two small volumes were issued at Florence by the Giunta family;
the earlier containing the nine Comedies published by Manuzio, the later the two theretofore unpublished Comedies.
The two volumes are, I believe, always found bound together, aud go by the name of "Junta."
Ten years later the same family published a third edition of Aristophanes under the editorship of Antonio Fracini.
Fracini is supposed to have had access to the Ravenna or some very similar MS., since the important improvements which he introduced into the text correspond very closely with the readings of R.
In the present Play, amongst other things, he was the first to print the 65 lines from 947 to 1012 which are omitted in Aldus and Junta, as in every known MS.
except R. and V.
In all these the line ειs ἀγαθὰ μεταβιβὰζει is immediately followed by εἶτα μονω̩δει̑ν ἐκΜηδείας.
He did not, however, include in his edition either the Lysistrata or the Thesmophoriazusae, nor did his successor Gormont in his Paris edition of 1528 (the first edition published out of Italy) ;
and the eleven Plays were not published in one volume until Cratander so published them at Basle in the year 1532.
Thenceforward the eleven Plays have always been printed together.
The text as settled by the earliest editions remained substantially unaltered for some two centuries.
A few slight corrections were made by Zanetti, and others, more numerous and more important, by Grynaeus, but as a rule editors were content to hand on the text as they received it from their predecessors.
The edition which Aemilius Portus, another Cretan scholar, published at Geneva in 1607 has perhaps been unduly depreciated.
If the editor added little of his own, he generally contrived to select the best of the various readings adopted by earlier scholars.
And he was the first to publish, together with the Greek, a Latin translation and notes.
It is true that neither the translation nor the notes were his own;
the former was a combination of the verse translations of Florent Chretien and Frischlin, and for the remaining Plays the prose translation of Andreas Divus;
the latter consisted of the Greek notes of Bisetus on all the eleven Comedies, and of Bourdin on the Thesmophoriazusae, and the Latin notes of Girard on the Plutus, and of Florent Chretien on the Wasps, the Peace, and the Lysistrata.
He also published the Greek scholia on the nine Aldine Plays as Aldus, Fracini, and Gelenius had already done.
And, on the whole, his edition made the Comedies far more intelligible to the ordinary reader than they had ever been before.
It was however altogether superseded by Kuster's edition published in 1710, a work on much the same plan, but carried out with far greater erudition on the part of the editor, and with much more important subsidiary appliances than existed in the time of Portus.
Kuster was the first editor to avail himself systematically of the help afforded by the MSS.
He tells us that he had consulted five which he calls Vaticano-Urbinas, Vaticano-Palatine, Bodleian, Arundel, and Vossianus, and which have been identified with the MSS.
called in this series U. (No. 141), I. (No. 67), the MS. x. 1 in the Library of Lincoln College, Oxford, L3. (the fourth London, Arundel 530), and Bentley's copy, now in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, of 1. (No 52. in the University Library, Leyden).
See Professor John Williams Whitens articles on "the MSS. of Aristophanes."
Apparently he relied mostly, and very wisely, on the two Vatican MSS.
which enabled him to effect several important improvements.
But his text is very unequal.
Many of the most glaring errors, both in language and in metre, are entirely overlooked.
Except that for the three versions by Andreas Divus he substituted versions of the Birds by Hemsterhuys, of the Ecclesiazusae by Le Fevre, and of the Thesmophoriazusae by himself, he retained everything that was in Portus's edition.
But he added a series of valuable annotations by various scholars;
by himself on all the Comedies except the Wasps and the Peace;
by Paulmier on the Lysistrata ;
by Casaubon on the Knights;
by Spanheim on the Clouds, Frogs, and Plutus;
by Le Fevre on the Ecclesiazusae;
and by Bentley on the Clouds and the Plutus.
Moreover the copy of the Leyden MS.
which Bentley sent him contained the Scholia on the Lysistrata which were for the first time published in this edition.
No Scholia on the Thesmophoriazusae were published until more than a century later, viz. in Bekker's edition of 1829.
Kuster was followed half a century later by Bergler, whose brief notes enter fully into the spirit of Aristophanes, and teem with apt illustrations and terse and happy comments.
He made too some brilliant conjectural amendments, but did not turn his attention to a systematic improvement of the text.
And unfortunately he died before the work was published, and its publication was undertaken by Peter Burmann the younger, a dull man incapable of appreciating either Aristophanes or Bergler.
Consequently the text which he prepared for Bergler's edition is as infelicitous as Bergler's own annotations are brilliant.
Brunck's edition was originally published at Strasburg in the year 1783, and the assistance afforded him by the Parisian MSS., and his own sound practical judgement, enabled him to effect a very material improve­ ment in the text of Aristophanes.
He seems to have been the first editor who went carefully through each Comedy, weighing every line, and endeavouring to detect, and, so far as he could, to remedy, every inaccuracy either of metre or of language.
Hardly any error escaped his notice, but not having access to the best MSS.
he frequently failed to administer the right remedy for the disease.
Indeed on more than one occasion, in reliance on the unsafe MS.
which is called P1., he unquestionably left the right path for the wrong."
But his edition was a remarkable advance on all preceding ones;
it was universally recognized as giving the standard text of Aristophanes;
and would doubtless have held its own till now, but for the flood of light unex­ pectedly thrown upon the text by the discovery (or rediscovery) of the great Ravenna and Venetian MSS.
The Ravenna MS. was brought to the notice of Western scholars by Invernizzi in the year 1794.
The edition which he commenced was continued by Beck and completed by Dindorf.
But Invernizzi's tran­ scription of the MS.
was of a deplorably imperfect and faulty character.
And the whole MS.
together with the Venetian (which for the Peace is hardly less valuable than the Ravenna) was again collated by Immanuel Bekker, whose excellent Variorum edition, published in London in the year 1829, professed to show, either in the text or in the footnotes, every variation of these two important MSS.
The results were embodied in Dindorf's Oxford edition of 1835.
But Bekker's own collation, though vastly superior to Invernizzi's, was itself very far from accurate;
and the only thoroughly trustworthy collations that have ever been published are those by Adolphus von Velsen of the Knights, the Peace, the Thesmophoriazusae, the Frogs, the Ecclesiazusae, and the Plutus.
However the importance of collations has been considerably diminished by the publication of photogravures of both these MSS.;
that of the Venetian in London and Boston, 1902, and that of the Ravenna in Leyden, 1904.
I did not, in my former Appendix to the Peace, attempt to criticize any editions published in my own lifetime, nor do I propose to do so now, beyond observing that with Cobet and Meineke an era of systematic corruption of the text was, most unhappily, inaugurated.
Empty irrational rules are formulated by anybody who has the audacity to formulate them, and when the MSS.
show them to be unfounded, it is the MSS., and not the rules, which have to be altered.
And he is acclaimed the aptest scholar who can make the most numerous alterations.
If Aristophanes wrote one thing an editor will remark " Malim some other thing," and merely on the ground of the editor's preference that other thing at once takes its place in the text.
Another editor considers his suggestion "multo elegantius" than what Aristophanes wrote, and again this much more elegant suggestion is substituted for the genuine reading.
That is the right way to correct a schoolboy's exercise, but it is most emphatically the wrong way to deal with the writings of an ancient poet, towards whom our attitude should be that of learners, and not that of a dictatorial schoolmaster.
One can imagine the indescribable mess into which the Plays of Shakespeare would be thrown were they to be treated in a similar manner even now, and much more 2000 years hence when tastes and ideas may have undergone a complete transformation.
I observed in my former Appendix that no complete edition of Aristophanes, and indeed no complete edition of the Peace, had ever been published by an English scholar;
but although that was true in 1866, it is not true now.
It is, however, still true that (as I proceeded to say) no country has contributed more than our own to the improvement of the Aristophanic text.
The marvellous sagacity of Bentley had already anticipated a great number of the corrections which were sub­ sequently supplied from the MSS.;
and " it is not too much to say," as Bp. Monk (Life of Bentley, i. 195) most truly observes, "that had he given his mind to such a work, no person ever lived who was so well qualified for an editor of the great Comedian of Athens."
His letters on the subject to Kuster, published more fully in the Museum Criticum than in Kuster's own edition, are specimens of literary criticism only less delightful and instructive than his own immortal Dissertation on Phalaris;
and his marginal jottings on Aristophanes, printed in the same Museum and in the Classical Journal, are altogether worthy of his unrivalled reputation.
The Aristophanic criticisms of Dawes are famous all over the world;
and truly, to pass from his Miscellanea Critica to such works as the Vindiciae Aristophaneae of Meineke and Herwerden, is like passing from the Garden of Eden to a barren and dry land where no water is.
Nor are the conjectures of Thomas Tyrwhitt, though briefer and less concerned with general principles, unworthy to stand by the side of the conjectures of Dawes.
Person, to use the language of Bps.
Monk and Blomfield in their Preface to his Adversaria, "in Aristophanem expoliendum semper incumbebat, et in hoc omnes nervos intendebat;
quin etiam credibile est, si vita suppeditasset, Comicorum principem demum exiturum fnisse, a principe Criticorum innumeris fere locis restitutum, Atticoque suo nitore postliminio donatum."
His numerous, though brief, criticisms were, after his death, edited by P. P. Dobree, whose own acute lucubrations were similarly given to the world by the late Professor Scholefield.
And finally no Aristophanic scholar is more constantly cited or more highly appreciated by foreign critics than Peter Elmsley, whose notes on the Acharnians are full of careful and patient observation upon the text, not only of that Play, but also of Aristophanes generally.

The Destructive Criticism of these latter days has dealt gently with the old Attic Comedy.
No one has yet discovered, so far at least as I am aware, that a Play of Aristophanes is a thing of shreds and patches put together by the order of Peisistratus;
or that it was composed by "Lord Bacon," or in the days of the Maccabees.
Doubtless these things will come in good time;
else how will the Professorial mind amuse itself in all the centuries to be.
I think that my original Appendix to this Play was the first attempt to bring together the various readings of the MSS.
and editions.
In it I proposed " to give the whole of the variations of the Ravenna and Venetian MSS.
according to Bekker's recension;
the whole of the variations of the Parisian MSS.
so far as they are recorded by Brunck;
and a tolerably complete collection of the various readings found in all the most noteworthy editions which have been published since the collation of the Ravenna and Venetian MSS.," besides giving a general account of the readings of the earlier editions.
But since then many similar collections have been made, fuller and better than mine, and it did not seem desirable in the present Appendix to repeat all the minute variations of the MSS.
and editions.
Indeed the most important MS. readings, those of the Ravenna and the Venetian MSS., are now brought within the reach of every scholar by the publication of the two photogravures as mentioned above.
The present Appendix therefore contains only such variations as appeared to be of some little importance or interest.1. ὡς τάχιστα κανθάρω̜ MSS.

Nothing but necessity would justify an alteration which destroys the rhythm of the line, and there is no necessity here.
The Greek dramatists were not so strict about the use of the article as modern critics are.
And here too there is the special circumstance that the word κανθά
ρω̜ιs introduced παρὰ προσδοκίαν, without any preliminary intimation having been given to the audience of the existence of a beetle.
2, 3. Dobree gives these two lines to the second servant, and this is followed by Weise, Meineke, and several other edi­ tors.
Yet while the traditional reading, given in my text, is perfectly plain and simple, Dobree's rearrangement bristles with difficulties, and requires numerous alterations of the text.
It rests on a misunderstanding of the word τρέφει in the scholium, which has no reference to the manual act of feeding an animal, but means keeps, is in charge of;
Clouds 109, 1407, Wasps 835, 928, Plutus 173, &c.

But αὐτω̩̑) is obviously right, and it was hardly neces­ sary for Dobree to refer to infra 1121 and Frogs 1121.
And for φάγαι in v. 3 Brunck reads φάγαις.
"Qua emenda­ tiones non opus," says Richter," quum infra quoque legamus κατέφαγεν et φησίν."
But of course what Brunck meant was, not that the term φάγαι was in itself inapplicable, but that the imprecation lost all its force if referred to the beetle whose favourite food the μα̑ζα in question was.
However his alteration is quite inadmissible.5. νμ̑ν δὴ "φερες. Bergler (in notes), Brunck, recentiores.

νυ̑ν γ ἤφερες Pl. Dobree, and those who adopt his arrangement, give the whole of this verse and the first two words of the next to the second servant:
thence to the end of v. 8 to the first.
Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.) truly says, "Servus (secundus) non potuit quaerere που̑ yap ἣνυ̑ν δὴ ἤφερες;
siquidem τὰ φέρειν pinsentis servi est";
but instead of discarding the faulty and perverse ar­ rangement which alone creates the difficulty, he would alter ἔφερες into ἔφεραν.
And this is actually done by Blaydes.7.

τρι̑β'έτέρας TE I. P2.18. συλλαβὼν R. V. Invernizzi, recen­ tiores, except Bothe and Weise, and except that one or two editors write it ξυλλαβὼν.
πρασλαβὼν I. P1. P2. editions before Invernizzi;
and Bothe and Weise afterwards.
This line, according to Dobree's arrangement, is given to the first, and the next to the second, servant.
Yet Meineke (V. A.) justly says "
Servo pinsenti qui se imparem esse tarn foedo negotio dixerat, responderi non potuit a primo servo quod nunc respondetur."
But here again, instead of returning to the traditional arrangement which does not present a single difficulty or require a single emendation, he would further tamper with the text by sub­ stituting αἶσε for αἴσω.
For τὴν ἀντλίαν Van Leeuwen reads τὴν κάρδαπαν, the Scholiast here saying ἀντὶ ταυ τὴν σκάφην, and Pollux (x. 102) observing Μένανδρας ἐν Εἰρήνη̩.
But Pollux means that Aris­ tophanes used ἀντλία, not κάρδαπας, in the sense of σκάφη in the Peace.
And so the other grammarians ;
ἀντλία, σκάφη Hesychius, ἀντλία, ἡσκάφη Suidas, quoting this very line.20. αἶδ'ἐμαὶ Brunck, recentiores,except Bothe and Richter, who, with the MSS.
and editions before Brunck, read αἶδέ μαι.32.
τέως ἕως ... λάθη̩ς MSS.
vulgo.
And so the line is quoted by Priscian, p. 1206, and by the Scholiast on Plato's Hipparchus.
Dawes, observing that τέως ἕως are not elsewhere conjoined by any Attic writer, and that ἕως with the sub­ junctive requires ἂν, proposed ἕως σεαυτὸν av λάθη̩ς, which is adopted by Brunck and Bothe.
Reisig suggested λάθαις for λάθη̜ς, a suggestion followed by Dindorf, Holden, Meineke, and most recent edi­ tors, but which seems to me inadmissible where the sense is so distinctively future as it is here.
And in truth ἓως with the subjunctive is frequently found without ἂν in the Tragedians, and in a matter of this kind, quite unconnected with the superior elevation of Tragic diction, it seems absurd to say that a usage allowable in Tragedy was impossible in Comedy.
The Tragedians were not shut up in one watertight compartment with a certain set of words and the Comedians in another with a different set.
They were all Athenians, speaking and writ­ ing the free language of Athens, though of course, in their compositions, the former would, as a rule, select the more dignified words as more suitable to Tragedy, and the latter the lighter and less formal, as more suitable to Comedy.
42.
Διός Σκαταιβάτου]
The Ravenna Scholiast, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and Graves, and this is approved by Meineke in his Vind.
Aristoph.
Δτός καταιβάτου MSS.
vulgo, but in R. a letter before K is erased.
In all probability that letter was σ, which the eraser took to be the final letter of Διός reduplicated.
Pauw conjectured καταιπάτου, Blaydes σκαται­ φάγου (a word which is found in the Plutus), and Rutherford Σκαταιβότου, which is adopted by Herwerden and Sharpley, and is very attractive, but departs a little too far from Καταιβάτον.
In all the MSS. (except V.) and in all the editions the word preceding Διός is ov.
In V. it is τοῦ, and Bentley had already proposed οὐκ ἔστι TO τέρας τοῦ.47.
αἰνίττεται MSS. vulgo.
This being the Attic form, Dobree proposed αἰνἰσσε- TaL, which is approved by Dindorf in his notes and read by Holden, Meineke, and most subsequent editors.
But in using an alien dialect Aristophanes was never careful to make it strictly accurate.
48.
ἀναιδέως R. V. Bekker, Dindorf, Bothe, Holden, recentiores, except Her­ werden and Merry, ἀναιδῶς the other MSS.
and all other editions before Bothe's second.
Bentley proposed ἀνέ­ δην, and Elmsley (at Ach. 178) ἡδέως, omitting τὴν.
In omitting τὴν he is followed by Dindorf, Bothe, and Green.
But ἀναιδὲωs is practically a trisyllable, the epsilon here, as frequently elsewhere, coalescing with the following vowel;
see Appendix to Lys. 63, and compare Lys. 734 ἀλλ ἐῶ 'πολέσθαι τἄρια, and such words as πόλεως.
The notion that κεῖνος is Cleon has given rise to some singular conjectures.
Van Leeuwen in a maga­ zine article (A.D. 1887) proposed to read ἐν 'Αίδεω, and this is done by Herwerden and Merry.
Then it was necessary to explain the meaning of τὴν σπατίλην.
Van Leeuwen thought it referred to the filthy hides of the tannery ;
Herwerden (with whom Dr. Merry agrees) to the σκῶρ ἀείνων in which Cleon was presum­ ably plunged in Hades.
The notion that the Ionian is pronouncing dogmati­ cally as to what Cleon was doing in the world below seems to me not comic but ridiculous;
and the idea that he is engaged in eating the dung by which he is supposed to be surrounded is not merely ridiculous but repulsive.
Neither idea could have entered into the mind of Aristophanes.
And in fact Van Leeuwen in his edition of the Play (A.D. 1906), having come to the con­ clusion that κεῖνος is the beetle, reverts to the ordinary reading and the ordi­ nary interpretation;
and Herwerden, though he still thinks that the words ὡς κεῖνος refer to Clean, agrees that the rest of the line is spoken of the beetle;
"Like Cleon, the beetle eats muck in a shameless manner."
This seems pro­ bable enough.
Another difficulty in referring the entire line to Cleon arises from the present tense ἐσθίει which, the Scholiast says, is used for ἤσθιεν.
Brunck proposed to read ἤσθιεν, and Paulmier and Dobree ἔσθιεν, which Blaydes intro­ duces into the text.
59.
μὴ 'κκόρετ R. V.Suidas (s.v. κορημα), Florent Chretien, Brunck, recentiores, except Bekker and Weise. μὴ κόρει the other MSS.
and editions.
Florent Chretien obtained the correct reading from Suidas, where Kuster made the same suggestion, and Brunck from Eustathius on Iliad xiii.
635 ἐκκορεῖν60. ἔαἔα.
In the MSS.
and in all editions before Brunch these words formed part of the servant's speech.
Brunch restored them to Trygaeus, to whom they clearly belong, and he is followed by almost all subsequent edi­ tors.
They are merely interjectional, and not, as Richter supposed, "idem quod μὴ 'κκόει."64. τουτὶ R. V. Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, recentiores.
δῆτα I Pl. P2. and the other editions before Bergk.67.
ἐνθαδί MSS. vulgo.
Lenting and Hirschig propose, and Meineke, Holden, Paley, Blaydes, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher read, ἄν ταδί, a probable reading in itself, but the words ἔλεγον ἄν ταδί are found 213 infra, and the im­ probability that Aiistophanes would have used the same formula twice seems sufficient to support the MS.
reading.76. ὦ Πηγάσιόν μοι, φησὶ Pl. vulgo.
ὦ Πηγάσιον φησὶ μοὶ I. P2- ὦ Πηγάσιόν φησι R. V., omitting the μοι, " quo non abu­ tar," says Dindorf, " ad duas quae in promptu sunt conjecturas."
Later edi­ tors have not been so considerate.
ὦ Πηγάσειον, φησὶ Bergk, Blaydes, Herwer­ den, Hall and Geldart, Mazon, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.
Yet Πηγά­ σιον, the proper form of the diminutive and the form most suited to the Comic rhythm, is found in every MS. ;
μοι is found, in different positions, in three MSS.;
and, what is perhaps more im­ portant, it occurs in the line of Euri­ pides which Aristophanes is here bur­ lesquing.
Meineke conjectured Πηγα­ σίδιον.85. ἰδίοῃς Person, Elmsley (at Medea 215, 216), Bothe, Blaydes, Herwerden, Mazon.
ἰδίῃς MSS.
vulgo.
It seems impossible that the present and the aorist ἰδίῃς καὶ διαλύσῃς should be brack­ eted together with reference to the self­ same process, and the Scholiast's com­ ment ἀντὶ TOV πρὶν ἱδρώσῃς seems to show that he read ἰδίσῃς.95.
τίμάτην οὐχ ὑγιαίνεις MSS.
vulgo.
And this is so obviously right that I do not know why anybody should object to it.
But Zeunius (at Vigor, p. 453) placed a note of interrogation after μάτην.
Blaydes suggested τί πέτει σὺ μά­ την;
which Herwerden reads, though himself proposing παθὼν for μάτην.
One would have thought, having regard to the MS.
μάτην and Lysistrata 599 τί μαθὼν οὺκ ἀποθνήσκεις, that it would be more natural to have proposed μαθὼν here.
Van Leeuwen not only proposes, but reads τί πέτει τλήμων ;
98.
ἀνθρώποισι φράσον V. Pl. vulgo.
ἀνθρώποις φράσον R. 1. P2. Dobree sug­ gested φράζειν or φράζω, with ἀνθρώποις, and φρόζω is so read by Meineke, Blaydes, and Merry.100.
ἀναικοδομεῖν MSS. vulgo.
But Florent Chretien suggested ἀποικοδομεῖν, and this is approved by Dindorf in his notes, and adopted by Holden, Meineke, Green, and subsequent editors except Hall and Geldart and Merry.
It seems to me, however, that ἀνοικοδομεῖν, to build up, block up, is the very word required.107.
καταγορεὐσῃ R. V. P1. vulgo.
κατη­ γορεύσῃ I. P2. Cobet altered it into κατα­ γορεύῃ (but the present tense is impos­ sible here) announcing " ἀγορεύσω, ἠγό­ ρευσο, ἠγόρευκα et cognata omnia neque in simplici forma neque in composita in antique sermone usitata fuisse."
This is one of Cobet's reckless generalizations which have done so much harm to the text of Aristophanes.
Veitch, who in his " Greek Verbs" showed it to be erro­ neous, trusted according to Dr. Ruther­ ford (New Pbrynichus, § 234) too impli­ citly to the authority of the MSS;
in other words, he preferred to rely on the facts rather than on the theory which the facts disproved.
Facts were abhor­ rent to Cobet, " Errant omnes," he says, "Sophistae, Rbetores, Magistri."
An investigator who works in this spirit is little likely to arrive at the truth.
The truth could be more briefly stated in two words " Errat Cobetus."
But I too have a little bone to pick with the old Gram­ marians.
Instead of saying that such a form as καταγ
ορεύσῃ is the aorist sub­ junctive, and that there is no future subjunctive, I wish that they had de­ scribed it as both the aorist and the future subjunctive.
Cobet's error is followed by Meineke, Blaydes, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Van Leeuwen, and Graves.114.
ἆp' ἔτ
υμός ye MSS.
Florent Chre­ tien, Grynaeus, Kuster, recentiores, ex­ cept Dindorf (in his text) and Richter.
Strangely enough, in Aldus, the ἆρ' was shifted from its proper place to the end of the line, ἔτυμός ye ἆρ', not ἆρα, though the next word commenced with a con­ sonant.
This was evidently a mere clerical error, but it was repeated in every edition, save as aforesaid, before Kuster.
For ἆρ' Dindorf in his text had ἦρ' (which the Scholiast seems to have read), but he returned in his notes to ἆρ'.
Richter changed γε into δὴ.129.
έξευρέθῃ R. Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, Richter, Green, Paley, Merry, and Sharpley. ἐξηυρήθῃ the other MSS.

All the MSS.
give al- for the first syl­ lable, but Brunck altered it to άετοῦ as the " Attic " form (see the Introduction to the Knights, p. xxxvi);
and his error has been followed by all subsequent editors except as mentioned above.
135.

Πειραιεῖ P1. Richter, Holden (second edition), Blaydes, Hall and Gel­ dart, Sharpley, recentiores.
See infra 165.155.
χρυσοχάλινον MSS.
Suidas, s. v. ψαλίοις, vulgo.
" Malim χρυσοχαλίνων " Florent Chretien. " Mallem cum Flo­ rente χρυσχαλίνων" Bergler. " Sed vul­ gatum magis poeticum est" Dindorf.
Not only is it the more poetical, it is also the more accurate :
for what is the meaning of 'golden-bitted curbs " ? " Golden-bitted clatter" is a poetical version of " the clatter of golden bits."
However Florent Chretien's suggestion is adopted, against all the authorities, by Bothe, Bergk, Blaydes, Herwerden, and Sharpley.161.
ὀρθῶς MSS. (except V), all edi­ tions before Bergk;
and Paley and Blaydes afterwards.
ὀρθὸς V. Dobree, Bergk, recentiores, except as aforesaid.
ὀρθῶς means in the right way, not swerv­ ing in this direction or in that;
ὀρθὸς can only mean standing upright, a diffi­ cult task for a beetle.
163. ἀπόθ' MSS. (except V) vulgo.
ἀπὸ δ' V. Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, Blaydes, recentiores, except Zacher.
But TE is rightly used after μὲν, where the two sentences which they introduce are not contrasted, but practically iden­ tical.
See Lys. 262,263 and Thesm. 352, 353 and the Appendix to each of those passages.
ἡμερινῶν MSS. vulgo.
your daily (that is ordinary) food.
Dobree said "Qu. ἁίερίων,i.e. ἀνθρωπείων."
He meant ἡμερίων, but used the form familiar in the Choral Odes of Tragedy.
How­ ever ἡμερίων could not possibly be equi­ valent to ἀνθρωπείων.
The word means, like ἐφήμερος,lasting for a day;
and ἡμέριοι, like ἐφήμεροι, is used to signify mortal men;
but ἡμέρία, or ἐφήμερα, atria.
would mean not human food but food lasting only for a day.
Nevertheless the MS.
reading is ignored, and ἡμἐρίων sub­ stituted for it, by Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Merry, Sharpley, and Zacher.— σίτων Brunck, Porson, recentiores.
σιτίων MSS., editions before Brunck, but the first syllable is long.
Bentley suggested σκατίων.165.
Πὲιραεῖ MSS. (except Pl.), all editions before Brunck;
and Dindorf, Bergk, Paley, and Mazon afterwards.
Πειραιεῖ Brunck, recentiores, except as aforesaid, so that many who gave πειραεῖ in 145 supra give Πειραιεῖ here.
This must, I think, be due partly to the cir­ cumstance that, according to Bekker, V. has πειραεῖ there and Πειραιεῖ here.
But Bekker was quite wrong ;
V. has Πειραεῖ in both places.
And partly to the fact that the penultimate is short there and long here ;
but the length of the syllable cannot depend upon the presence or absence of the iota.
174.
ὡςἐμέ MSS. vulgo.
We should have expected ἐμοὶ after πρόσεχέ τὸν νοῦν, but that phrase involves an idea of mo­ tion, whence we have in Clouds 575 AEYPO τὸν νοῦν πρόσχέτε.
Blaydes, however, punctuated after voûv, connect­ ing ὡs ἐμὲ with the following line, and so Herwerden, Mazon, recentiores.175.
στροφεῖ MSS. vulgo.
Dindorf suggested στρέφει, and Cobet (Novae Lect. p. 106), with his usual assurance, takes upon himself to announce that στροφεῖ is a barbarism.
στροφέω is no more a barbarism than φορέω.
The re­ lation of the former word to στρέφω is identical with that of the latter word to φέρω.
However the prosaic στρέφει is introduced into the text by Meineke, who is followed by Holden, Blaydes, Sharpley, and subsequent editors.
176.
φυλάξει Reiske, Bergk, recen­ tiores, except Green, Paley, Mazon, and Zacher.
φυλάξεις MSS.
(except that Pl. has φυλάξῃς), all editions before Bergk, and the four excepted above.
It seems to me that the middle is required, the sense being if you are not careful.
Mr. Green says " scil. με, ' if you don't keep me safe.'"
Paley "scil.
τὴν μηχανὴν or ἐμὲ, unless-you keep a guard, or good care of me.'"
Zacher, to support the MS.
reading, refers to Wasps 155, Frogs 1002, Knights 434, 499, but these pas­ sages do not seem to be in point.180. με προσέβαλ';
I. P1. P2. vulgo. με προσέβαλεν R. V. μοt προσέβαλ'Blaydes ;
but the enclitics με and σέ are some­ times used where in strictness a dative should be employed, cf. Lys. 297.
προσ­ έβαλεν (without με) Van Leeuwen.
After προσέβαλ' or προσέβαλεν the sign of an unfinished sentence is placed by Weise, Paley, Mazon, and Van Leeuwen ;
but I cannot believe that in a short sentence of five words Aristophanes would have omitted one, and that the most impor­ tant, word.182.
ὦ μιαρὲ MSS. vulgo.
And so Suidas, s. vv. μιαροὶ and τολμῆσαι.
But in Kuster's edition of Suidas, s. v. μιαροὶ, the line was made to commence ὦ βδε­ λυρὲ, apparently from a slip of memory, and a reminiscence of Frogs 465.
Per­ son noticed that Suidas had ὦ βδελυρὲ, but of couise did not recommend its adoption here.
Yet Dindorf actually introduced it into his text, and what is still more strange, this ridiculous error is followed by almost every subsequent editor, even after Gaisford, in his edition of Suidas, had struck out βδελυρὲ and restored μιαρὲ from the MSS.
Bothe absurdly reads ὦ μικρὲ, and this is not a mere clerical error for he explains it in a note.196. ὅτ' (for ὅτε) MSS.
vulgo.
ὅτι Brunck, Bothe, Weise, Hall and Geldart. —ούδὲ μέλλεις MSS. vulgo.
Dobree said " usitatius ova' ἔμελλες," and οὐδ' ἔμελλες is accordingly read by Meineke, Holden, Green, Herwerden.
Not only is this unnecessary, it is absolutely wrong, there being no reference to any past action.
Reiske proposed to read ὅπου δὲ with an interrogation after θεῶν, a proposal which must have sprung from his erroneous idea that the ὅτ' of the MSS.
represented ὅτι.—εἶναι MSS. vulgo.
ἰέναιΒrunck, Invernizzi, Bothe, Bekker.202. ἀμφορείδια Dawes (at Plutns 986), Brunck, recentiores, except Richter.
The line is cited by Suidas (s. v. ἀμφο­ ρεαφόρους), and there the Parisian MS.
2625, which Gaisford calls " exemplar omnium quotquot nobis innotuerunt praestantissimum," has άμφορείδια.
The form ἀμφορείδια is also found in all the MSS.
in Eccl. 1119, and seems to be the proper form for the diminutive of ἀμφορεύς.
ἀμφορίδια MSS., editions before Brunck ;
and Richter afterwards.210. εἵνεχ' (and εἴνεκαιnfra 760) MSS.
vu]go.
Brunck waged a war of exter­ mination against εἵνεκα, changing it into οὕνεκα wherever it occurs, and he is followed by many subsequent editors.
With equal onesidedness Blaydes attempts to extirpate οὕνεκα, changing it into εἵνεκα wherever it occurs, and be too has his followers.
It seems safer in every case to follow the reading of the MSS.
Both forms were in common use.211.
ἁτιὴ Bentley, Dindorf, recentiores, except Bothe and Mazon.
ἅτι MSS., all editions before Dindorf;
and Bothe and Mazon afterwards.
In Plutus 948, where Bentley makes a bimilar correction, the vestiges of the genuine text are visible in V.'s reading ὅτι ἢ.214.
᾽Αττικίων Secret δίκην MSS.
vulgo.
Dindorf added the aspirate, and is followed by several editors.
Cobet, on the assumption thatAristophanes always made his Durians speak the strictest possible Doric (an assumption supported neither by intrinsic probability nor by any known fact), proposed ὡττικίων δωσεĩ δίκαν, and this is adopted in its entirety by Blaydes, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Van Leeuwen, and Graves, and in part by Bergk and most recent editors.
215.
πράξαιτ᾽.
This is Bekker's sug­ gestion, approved by Dindorf in his notes, and brought into the text by Holden, Bergk, and all subsequent editors except Mazon.
πρὰξαιντ᾽ MSS., all editions before Holden's first;
and Mazon afterwards.
I am overborne by the authority of so many recent editors, otherwise 1 should have thought πράττεσθαι ἀγαθόν TL perfectly good Greek.
Cobet’s remark(N.L. p.325)“Est enim πράττεσθαι ἀγαθόν τι et πράττεσθαι εὖ pro εὖ πράττειν non minus portentosum quam χαίρομαι " ignores the distinction between the intransitive πράττειν with an adverb, and the transitive πράττειν governing an accusative.
However πράττειν ἀγαθόν τι is no doubt good Greek, Frogs 302, Plutus 341 ;
Plutarch, Marius xvii. (6) ;
and I have therefore gone with the crowd.—
῾Αττικωνικοὶ.
The aspirate was suggested by Bekker and is added by all recent editors, except that Richter has ὡττικωνικοὶ, and that Van Leeuwen for ῾Αττικωνικοὶ coolly writes ὑμεῖς ᾽Αττικοί.218.
νὴ τὴν ᾽Αθηνᾶν, νὴ Δί᾽ MSS.
(except that I. P1, and P2. insert τὸν before Δί᾽) vulgo.
Meineke takes all the dramatic life out of the line by reading νὴ τὴν ᾽Aθηναίαν μὰ Δί᾽, yet he is followed by Holden, Blaydes, and Herwerden.
Cobet, who in 217 proposed εὐθύς ἄνδρες for ὑμεῖς, εὐθὺς, here pro­ poses ὦνδρες for νὴ Δί᾽.—πειστέον I. P1. P2. vulgo.
πιστέον R. V. σπειστέον Hirschig, which Blaydes also adopts.219.
τὴν Πύλον I. Pl. P2. vulgo. τὴν πόλιν R. V., an obvious error, but followed by Fracini, Gormont, Bergk, and Mazon.
ἢν ἔχωμεν τὴν Πύλον is pre­ cisely what the Athenians would, and did, say;
but for some reason or other a, number of really nonsensical con­ jectures have been put forward in its place.
Hirschig proposed ἢν ἔλωμεν τὴν Πύλον, a reading historically impossible (since Pylus bad been taken long ago), but so like one of Cobet's that it is not surprising to find Cobet applauding it as " verissimum," N. L. p. 204, and Blaydes brings it into the text.
Kock suggests ἀντέχωμεν αὖ πάλιν.
Van Leeuwen, for the vigorous sentence with which Aristophanes concludes the speech, substitutes his own somewhat feeble composition ἢν μεθῶμεν τήμερον.
Such alterations as these seem to go beyond what is permissible to the editor of an ancient author.220.
ὁ γοῦν χαρακτήρ.
This line was continued to Hermes in every edition before Brunck's ;
and several editors therefore changed ἡμεδαπὸς into ὑμεδαπός.
Bentley was the first to restore it to Trygaeus, to whom it is now found to be given by R., while V. has the line signifying a new speaker.
And it is given to Trygaeus by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
233.
ἔνδον V. I. Pl. P2. vulgo.
ἔνδοθεν R. Fracini, Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, Richter, Green, Paley, and Mazon.239. τοῦ βλέμματος R. V. Bothe, Bekker, recentiores.
καὶ τοῦ βλέμματος I. P1. editions before Brunck. καὶ βλέμματος P1. Brunck. τὸ βλέμμα πως Invernizzi.
But the variations in this and the preceding line are in the punctuation rather than in the words, the question being whether each line is to be taken as an independent sen­ tence, or whether ἄσον κακὸν is to govern τοῦ πλάτους as well as τοῦ βλέμματος, or to be considered parenthetical.
On this point there is great diversity both in the MSS.
and in the editions, some punctuating after πλάταυς, some after κακὸν, and some after both words.
The ordinary Aristopbanic usage seems greatly in favour of taking line 238 as an independent sentence;
ὦναξ῎
Απολλον, τοῦ νέφους, Birds 295;
῎Απολλον ἀποτρόπαιε, ταῦ χασμήματος, Id. 61;
῎Απολλον ἀποτρόπαιε, τοῦ μαντεύματος, Wasps 161 ;
and I have so taken it with Kuster, Brunck, Dindorf, Bergk, Blaydes, and most of the Commentators.242.
τρισάθλιαι MSS. vulgo.
Dobree says “Perspicue legendum τρὶς ἄθλιαι.”
And this is followed by Bothe and some others but not generally.
And see Plutus 851 and the Appendix there.246. ὦ Μέγαρα, Meyap' ὡς ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽ αὐτίκα, the Ravenna scholiast, Elmsley (in Edinburgh Review xxxvii. 68), Dindorf, recentiores, except Bothe, Sharpley, Zacher, and Graves. ἰὼ Μέγαρα Μέγαρ᾽ ὡς ἐπιτρίψεσθ᾽ αὐτίκα I. P1. P2. all editions (except Invernizzi) before Dindorf;
and Bothe, Sharpley, Zacher, and Graves afterwards.
But Bentley, objecting probably both to the use of τρίψομαι in a purely passive sense, and to the rhythm of the line, proposed ὦ Μέγαρα with ἐπιτριβήσεσθ᾽;
while for the latter word Elmsley proposed ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽.
And ὦ Me'yapa was subsequently found to be the reading of R. V. (though they also have ἐπιτρίψεσθ᾽, making the line a syllable short, and so Invernizzi);
whilst the Scholiast on R. has ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽.
Ac­ cordingly there has been a general acquiescence in Bentley's ὦ Μέγαρα and Elmsley’s ἐπιτετρίψεσθ᾽.
It is difficult to say whether the fact that War's other denunciations commence with ἰὼ is in favour of, or against, the same commencement here.251.
oF ἡ Bp. Blomfield (Gloss. on Agamemnon 64) Richter.
And so I read in my previous edition, observing that " oἷ ἡ might easily be mistaken for οἵη and so become converted into οἵα.”
Harpocration indeed, a. v. Κεῖοι, does read οἷα.
οἵα MSS. vulgo.
Meineke reads olaf, with which however πάλις would require the article.
The MSS. ' and early editions continue the line to War, but Dobree's proposal to transfer it to Trygaeus is obviously right, and is now universally accepted.
253.
χρῆσθἀτέρῳ.
The MSS.
read χρῆσθαι θἀτέρῳ, making the line a syllable too long.
All editions before Brunck rectified the metre by omitting orai, which all the MSS.
read.
And so (after Brunck) Bothe, Weise, and Rich­ ter. ''
At locum hie habere non potest θἀτέρῳ, altero, tanquam de duobus definitis sermo esset;
oportet ἑτέρῳ absolute, alio.
Scribendem igitur αὗτας, παραινῶ σοι μέλιτι χρῆσθαι ᾽τέρῳ " Brunck.
And so, or as Bekker wrote it, χρῆσθἀ­ τέρῳ all subsequent editors except as aforesaid.254.
τετρώβαλον MSS. vulgo.
Dindorf suggested τετρωβόλσυ, which is read by Holden, Meineke, Richter, Green, and Paley.257.
ὡς δριμύς.
In the editions before Bekker these two words were continued to War.
But Bentley proposed to trans­ fer them to Riot, and this is now found to be the arrangement in R. V., and is followed by Bekker and others.
Hermann however proposed to transfer them and the whole of the following line (changing ἐνέβαλες into ἐνέβαλεν) to Trygaeus, and this is followed by Dindorf and others.
It seems to me that the MS.
arrangement, which I have retained, is in every respect better than Hermann's.259.
αἴσεις MSS. vulgo.
Dobree on Clouds 633 said " Qu. oἶσ᾽ οἶσ᾽,” an un­ fortunate suggestion, which he did not repeat when he came to the Peace.
It is however adopted by Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes.261.
᾽Αθηναίων μεταθρέξει ταχύ. R. V. I. P2. Fracini, Gelenius, Invernizzi, Green, Paley, Merry, and Graves. ᾽Αθηναίους μεταθρέξει ταχύ. Pl. all other editions before Brunck.
Since Inver­ nizzi all editions have adopted ᾽Αθηναίων.
But according to the rule invented by Dawes (at Plutus 166) the second syllable of μεταθρέξει should be short;
and editors from Brunck downwards, except as aforesaid, have sought to re­ model the line so as to bring it into conformity with this rule.
Brunck inserted σὺ before μεταθρέξει, and this is followed by Bekker, Bergk, Van Leeuwen, and others ;
Elmsley (at Ach. 759) proposed to read’Αθηναίοισι subaud.
ὄντα ;
Dobree proposed to change raxv into ταχὺ πάνυ, and this is done by Meineke, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart and others;
Dindorf inserted γε before μεταθρέξει, and so Bothe, Richter, and others, and Blaydes reads τινὰ TaxO.
But rules, so purely empirical as this, however useful as showing the general leaning of the Comic Writers, and the airiness and vivacity which they strove to infuse into their metres, become positively mischievous when they are elevated into Draconian laws which must be strictly enforced against any amount of opposing evidence.
The enormous number of passages (some, but not all of which are collected by Kidd in his notes on Dawes, and by Mitchell in his Note H to the Wasps), in which a perfectly simple and unsuspi­ cious text has been vexed and worried into a reluctant conformity with this supposed rule, is at least sufficient to show that the rule, if it existed at all, admitted of abundant exceptions.
It is not suggested that the rule applies to any but the comic poets, and it seems to savour strongly of the watertight compartment theory ;
see on 32 supra.262.
εἰ δὲ μή γε, κλαύσομαι MSS.
vulgo.
Meineke substitutes γὼ for γε and is followed by Holden.
Richter reads εἰ δὲ μὴ— ΠΟΛ.
κεκλαύσεται.
Κεκλαύσαμαι had previously been proposed by Paper;
see Kidd's Dawes 154 note.269.
᾽Αθηναίοισιν ἁλετρίβανος Person, Bothe, Bekker, recentiores.
᾽Αθηναίοις ἀλετρίβανος R. V. I. P2.
To these words Pl. added ὁρᾳ̑ς, an unsuccessful attempt to mend the metre, and such is the reading in all editions before Bothe and Bekker.
The iota in ἀλετρίβανος was supposed to be short;
it really is long.
273.
ἦ πρίν γε sane priusquam.
So I read in my former edition.
ἢ πρίν γε MSS. vulgo.
The Scholiast's explanation of the line is εὖ ye ποιῶν ἀπώλετο ἐκεῖνος, εἴπερ 7rpo τοῦ ἀπολέσαι τὰ π ράγμ ατα -ἡμῶν ἀπώλετο, whence he is supposed by Dobree and Seidler (wrongly, I think) to have read εἰ πρίν ye here, and that reading is adopted by Bothe and Zacher.
πρὶν ἤ ye Buttman.
Bergk suggested πρὶν τόνδε, which is read by Merry and Graves.
The line is omitted by Dindorf, Meineke, and some others, and bracketed by some.274. δῆτ’ MSS. (except R.) vulgo.
γέ τι R. Invernizzi represented R. as reading, and himself read, y ἔτ’. γέ τιν’ Dindorf, Bergk, Green, Blaydes. γ’ αὖτ’ Reisig, Zacher.313.
εὐλαβεῖσθε K.T.X. R. V. Invernizzi, recentiores.
I. P2. have the same line, save that they omit κάτωθεν.
But P1. making, as usual, an attempt at emenda­ tion, produces a most extraordinary line.
He omits not only κάτωθεν but also the νυν after εὐλαβεῖσθε, and annexes, from the Scholiast, the words καὶ δεδίτ­ τεσθε, so that the line ran εὐλαβεῖσθ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν Κέρβερ
ον καὶ δεδίττεσθε.
And that was the reading of all editions before Brunck.
Whilst the text was in this condition Florent Chretien proposed εὐλαβεῖσθ’ ἐκεῖνο Kat τὸν Κέρβερον δεδίττεις;
Bentley εὐλοβεῖσθ’ ἐκεινονὶ TOV Κέρβερ
ον καὶ δείδετε ;
Pierson εὐλαβεῖσθ’ ἐκεῖνο νῦν τὰν Κέρβερόν τε δείδετε;
while Brunck, with the aid of P2., read εὐλαβεῖσθε νῦν ἐκεῖνον δεδιότες τὸν Κέρβερον.316.
οὔτι καὶ νῦν MSS.
vulgo.
οὔτι ’κείνων, i.e. τω̃ν κάτωθεν, was proposed by "Hotibius," but Bothe did not re­ peat the suggestion in either of his editions.
Dobree proposed οὔτι νῦν γ’?T', and Richter ούδ’ ἐκεῖθεν.
οὔτι χαίρων Meineke, Holden.
But the meaning is not "none shall take her away with impunity,” but none shall take her away at all," as in the passages of Euripides cited in the Commentary.
οὔτ ἐκείνων Sharpley.329. μηδὲν ὀρχήσεσθ᾽ ἔτι MSS., editions before Bekker;
and Bergk afterwards.
Richter too keeps this reading, but changes the preceding καὶ into KOV, which Meineke approves in his V. A.;
Mazon also retains it but takes ἀρχήσεσθ᾽ to be the infinitive future.
μηδὲν ὀρχήσησθ᾽ ἔτι Bekker, recentiores, except as aforesaid.
But the future indicative is sometimes, though rarely, found with μὴ or μηδὲν, as in Plutus 488 μαλακὸν 8' ἐνδώσετε μη­ δὲν, and it does not seem right to reject it here, with the evidence of every MS. in its favour.344.
συβαρίζειν MSS. vulgo.
The first syllable of the verb is long, and the first syllable of Σύβαρις (the city) is short, Wasps 1259,1427,1435 ;
but it is doubt­ ful if the two words are really connected, though assumed to be so in after times ;
and indeed it is not uncommon for poets to adapt the quantity of proper names to suit their own metrical exi­ gencies.
The existence of various forms of the verb, συβαριάζειν, συμβαρίζειν, συβριάζειν, is of itself sufficient to cast some doubt upon the derivation from Σύβαρις.
Thus συμβαριτικαι̃ς· Περσικαῖς, ὑπερηφάνοις, πολυτελέσι, Hesychius.
συ­ βριάζειν᾽ ἀπὸ τοῶ συβαρίζειν, ἐν ὑπερθέσει (transposition), Et. Magn. συβαρίζειν* αὐλητῶν μὲν ἧν,” Scholiast.
“Olim conjeci συμβαρίζειν,” says Bergk, " sed neque hoc, neque συβαριάζειν vel συβριάζειν satis probabile."
Meineke, in his Fragm.
Graec. Corn. vol. v. 41 (published in 1857), having regard to the word συβα­ ριασμὸς in the line of Phrynichus, pro­ posed συβαριάζειν, but in his edition of the Play (published in 1860) he ignored that suggestion and actually read πυδαρίζειν, to which he adhered in the Vind.
Aristoph. (published in 1865).
πυδαρίζειν is, as Mr. Sharpley says, a worthless suggestion, and is adopted only by Van Leeuwen.
συβριάζειν, Green, Mazon.
The despised συβαριάζειν was however rescued from its obscurity and brought into the text by Blaydes, who is followed by Herwerden, Sharpley, Zacher, and Graves.346-60.
This little system is re­ peated, with exact metrical concordance, infra 385-99 and again infra 582-600.
I will here set out the scheme, which in the earlier edition was given in the Introduction :
-In drawing out the scheme in the former edition I did not make sufficient allowance for the extreme frequency with which the final syllable of a cretic ending a line is found to be short, so that the cretic really becomes a dac­ tyl.
For example in the eight cretico- paeonic lines relating to the sons of Automenes (Wasps 1275-82) this ter­ mination occurs in four consecutive lines, and perhaps more frequently still, though not so continuously in any one passage, in the Acharnians.
It will be seen that the system of seventeen lines is composed of twelve cretico-paeonic lines, all dimeters except the last which is a trimeter, three trochaic tetrameters catalectic, one iambic dimeter, and one consisting of a trochaic dimeter followed by a cretic dimeter.
The last-mentioned line is the first of the system, and is the only line about the metre of which there is any conceivable doubt;
some making it a trochaic tetrameter, and others treating it as half trochaic and half cretic, as it was given in the intro­ duction to my former edition and now appears in my text.
Not a single MS.
gives the line in either of the three systems as a trochaic tetrameter :
one gives it in one case exactly as in the text, and the reading of the others point to the same conclusion.346. εἰ γὰρ ἐκγένοιτ᾽ ἰδεῑν ταύτην με τὴν ἡμέραν.
This is the reading of R. except that R. adds ποτὲ, a word that has probably crept in from some marginal gloss.
It will perhaps make the matter clearer if we divide the line into two sections:
(1) εἰ yap ἐκγένοιτ᾽ ἰδει̃ν R. Invernizzi, recentiores.
For ἐκγένοιτ᾽ V. has γένοιτο, I. P2- γένοιτ᾽, while P1. fills up the gap left in these latter readings by giving μοι γένοιτ᾽, and so all editions be­ fore Brunck who reads εἴθε μοι ταύτην ἰδει̃ν. (2) ταύτην με τὴν ἡμέραν ποτέ R. V. 1. P2. Invernizzi, Bekker. Pl. having inserted μοι in the first section, omits με here, reading ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν ποτέ.
And so all editions before Brunck (who reads γένοιτό ποτε τὴν ἡμέραν), and Weise after­ wards.
Since
Bekker three different readings have prevailed.
Person pro­ posed τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην ποτέ, and this is followed by Meineke, Blaydes, and Mazon.
Dindorf proposed ταύτην μέ ποτε τὴν ἡμέραν, which is followed by Bothe, Green, and Paley.
Bergk simply struck away the ποτὲ from R.'s reading, and this 1 followed in the introduction to my former edition;
and, save as aforesaid, it is adopted by all editors subsequent to Bergk.
382.
ὦρμίδιαν MSS. vulgo.
Dindorf is said to have suggested ὦρμήδιον (I do not know where he did so), and this appears to he the correct reading in Lucian's Contemplantes 1.
Schwabe proposed Ἑρμῄδιον.
But the first to alter the text was Blaydes who read Ἑρμείδιον.
His particular alteration has not been followed, but his example in altering the text has been followed by all subsequent editors except Merry and Mazon ;
Herwerden adopting Schwabe's proposal, and the others following in his train.
See the Commentary.385.
μηδαμῶς μηδαμῶς V. Bergk, and all the editors who in line 346 read ratify με τὴν ἡμέραν.
μὴ μηδαμῶς μηδαμῶς R.I. Invernizzi.
I imagine that in this reading the first μὴ is merely a duplicate of the last syllable of Ἑρμῆ which immediately precedes.
μὴ μηδαμῶς μὴ μηδαμῶς F. P2.
μηδαμῶς μὴ μηδαμῶς Pl. vulgo.387.
παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ ye vulgo.
παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ (omitting γε) MSS.
παρ᾽ ἐμοί ye Cobet, Meineke, Holden.
I do not know why they object to Trap' ἐμοῦ, from me, as my gift, which is obviously right.
389.
νόμιζ᾽ ἐν τῳ̑δε τῳ̑ νῦν πράγματι Bentley, Hall and Geldart.
νομίζων ἐν τῳ̑δε τῳ̑ πράγατι MSS., editions before Brunck;
and Invernizzi, Bothe, and Beaker afterwards.
Brunck wrote κεῖνο μὴ φαῦλον νομίζων τουτῳὶ Τῳ̑ 7rpayματι.
Dindorf, combining the suggestions of Bentley and Brunck, gave νόμιζ ἐν τουτῳὶ T6 πράγματι, observing that the words τουτῳὶ τῳ̑ πρέγματι occur in Lys. 615.
And this has been almost univer­ sally followed, though it departs far more widely than Bentley's proposal from the MS.
reading.
But Bergk and one or two others end the line (as the first line of the system) with two cretics νόμιζ᾽ ἐν τῳ̑δε τῳ̑ πράγματι, and Meineke writes νομίζων ἐν τοιούτῳ πράγματι402.
κλέπται τε yap νῦν εἰσι μα̑λλον.
So I read in the former edition, following V., except that, with I. and P2., I wrote εἰσι μα̑λλον for μα̑λλάν εἰσι, so as to bring the termination of the present line into more exact conformity with that of its predecessor;
and so now Zacher reads.
R. omits the line, no doubt owing to the similarity of termination, but some corrector has written in the margin V.'s reading rendered unmetrical by the omission of τε.
κλέπται τε γὰρ νῦν μα̑λλον εἰσὶν V. Dindorf, Holden. κλέπται yap νῦν εἰσι μα̑λλον I. P2. κλέπται γάρ εἰσι νῦν ye μα̑λλαν P1., a more fortunate conjecture than most of his, since it has been accepted by every editor except the few here excepted.
Meineke quite unne­ cessarily deserted all the MSS.
and wrote κλέπται τὰ νῦν γάρ εἰσι μα̑λλον, which is adopted by Van Leeuwen and Graves;
then, in his V. A., he altered τὰ vvv γὰρ into τὰ γὰρ νῦν which Green follows.407.
ἐπιβουλεύαντε R. Bentley, Bothe, Bekker, recentiores.
ἐπιβουλεύονται V. F. I. P2. ἐπιβουλεύουσι (with a colon or full stop at the end of the line) P1.
And here again his conjecture was adopted by every editor before I nve rnizzi, who represented R.'s reading to be, and himself read, ἐπιβαυλεύαντες.409.
ἵνα δὴ τί Bentley, Bergk, and almost all subsequent editors.
So Clouds 1192, Eccl. 791. ἵνα τί δὴ (which is contra metrum) R. V. F. I. P2. Fracini, Gelenius to Bergler inclusive.
ἵνα τί δ᾽ Pl. Aldus, Cratander, Brunck, and.
others.
ἵνα δὲ τί the two Juntas, Gormont, and Grynaeus.412.
ἡμα̑ς R. V. Bentley, Bergk, Meineke, Green, Herwerden, recentiores, except Sharpley.
ὑμα̑ς the other MSS.
and vulgo.415.
ἁρματωλίας MSS.
vulgo :
and Suidas cites this line for the purpose of illustrating the word ἁρματωλία.
Bentley however suggested ἁμαρτωλίας, which is read by Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Herwerden, and subsequent editors except Mazon and Zacher ;
but which seems to me simply to destroy a characteristic jest.417.
τήνδε καὶ MSS. vulgo.
On account of the anomalous position of the copulative Dobree suggested τήνδε δὲ ξυναέλκυσον or συνεξέλκυσον, and some have adopted ξυναέλκυσον with τήνδε Kal.
Meineke changed τήνδε into τω̑νδε, a very improbable reading, but adopted by Herwerden, Sharpley, and Zacher.420.
Διπολίει᾽.
With Zacher
I have adopted Mr. Sharpley's spelling of this word, which is so spelled in inscriptions and in the Lexicon Sangerman, Bekker's Anecd.
p. 91, and which corresponds with the Διπολιώδη of Clouds 984.
Διιπόλει᾽ MSS., all editions before Bothe and Bekker, and one or two afterwards.
Person objected to Διιπόλει᾽ and proposed Διπόλει᾽, which is read by Bothe and Bekker and almost all subsequent editors.421.
ἅλλαι.
The aspirate, proposed by Bergk, is added by Meineke, Blaydes, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and Graves.
But even without the aspirate there was never any doubt as to the meaning of the line.
"Tum civitates ceterae, functae malis," Florent Chre­ tien.427.
εἰσιάντες MSS. vulgo.
We have not enough information about the in­ tricacies of the Athenian theatre to understand precisely what the Chorus are directedto do ;
but there is no need of such idle conjectures as Bachmann's εἶ᾽ ἰόντες (which Herwerden introduces into the text), or Kock's εἶα πάντες.
And we must remember that, as a rule, the action of the Chorus is restricted to songs, dances, and gesticulations in the orchestra.430. τἄλλα 8' MSS. vulgo.
Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.), "not understanding to what τἄλλα can refer," proposes καὶ γὰρ, or πάντα δ᾽.
But the meaning is plain. "
You take the manager's part;
every­ thing else we can supply.
"432. μεν. φιαλαῦμεν MSS. vulgo.
The apostrophe was added by Bentley from Eustathius on Odyssey i. 150 (p. 1403), and so Brunck, Bergk, Blay­ des, and several other editors.
Sharpley reads ᾽πιαλοῦμεν.
But Eustathius ob­ serves εἰς TO δοκει̑ν δασύνεσθαι τὰ ἱάλλειν ἀρκέσει ἁ Ἐφιάλτης.435.
εὐχώμεσθα V. F. I. Pl. P2. vulgo.
εὐχώμεθα R. εὐχόμεσθα Hamaker, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Herwerden, recen­ tiores, except Mazon.
But this seems to me a complete mistake.
Trygaeus is not stating a fact, but exhorting to prayer.
μεσθα,
Let its pray, was the regular form.
It is used again infra 973.439.
ye διάγειν.
This I proposed in my former edition.
The MSS. (except Pl.) have simply διάγειν (without γε).
Pl. has Stayer με, and so all editions before Dindorf.
Dindorf proposed διάξειν, which is followed by Weise, Green, and Blaydes.
Lenting proposed διαγαει̑ν, which is fol­ lowed by Bergk, and, save as aforesaid, all subsequent editors.
Boissonade pro­ posed διάγειν γε.
It seems to me that Stayer is right:
compare Wasps 1006, where Bdelycleon promises to take his father to dinners, wine-parties, and public spectacles ὣσθ᾽ ἡδέως διάγειν σε τὸν λοιπὸν χράναν.
But the ye should here come after εἰρήνῃ, not after διάγειν.441.
The Scholiast says δύα πρόσωπα take him to mean that the preceding six lines have been a prayer for blessing, but that now we come to a series of im­ precations which he supposes to have been invoked by a different speaker.
Dobree however, quite misunderstand­ ing, as it seems to me, the Scholiast's observation, divides the triplets which follow into two sections, giving to Trygaeus merely the description of an objectionable person, and then making the Chorus take the words out of his mouth, and declare that person's fate.
Thus he arranges the first triplet in this way :
TP.
ὅστις δὲ πόλεμον μα̑λλον εἶναι ἐξαιραύμεναν.
And so on with the others :
so that Trygaeus is never allowed to finish his sentence.
This seems to me supremely ridiculous, and it cannot be what the Scholiast meant, for under this arrangement Trygaeus never εὔχεται, the Chorus does that for him.
Yet no less than five editors-Richter, Herwerden, Mazon, Sharpley, and Graves-have followed Dobree's mistake.445.
πάτνι᾽ , ev ταῖσιν μάχαις.
This seems to have been suggested by Dindorf in some earlier edition, and it is adopted by Bekker and all subsequent editors except.
Weise.
πάτνι᾽ ἐν ταῖς μάχαις MSS.
except P1 πότνιά γ᾽ ἐν ταῖς μάχαις Pl. editions before Beaker;
and Weise afterwards.450. κεἰ . . . ξυλλάβῃ MSS. Suidas (s. v. τροχὸς) vulgo.
Here, as in Knights 805, the weight of authority in favour of the combination of εἰ with the subjunctive is so great that it cannot reasonably be rejected.
And it seems certain that Aristophanes occasionally used ἢν with the optative and el with the subjunctive.
See the Appendix on Knights 698-700, 805, Birds 1240, Plutus 217, and infra 783.
In the present case it would be easy to change κεἰ into κἢν or ξυμμάβῃ into ξυλλάβpι.
And indeed the former change was made by Brunck and Bothe, while the latter was suggested (though not adopted) by Meineke, and made by Richter, Holden, Paley, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Merry, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Graves.457.
"Apet δὲ μή;
TP.
μή.
Bentley, Dindorf, recentiores, except Bothe, Richter, Sharpley, and Zacher.
῎Αρει he;
(to the first speaker) and μὴ μή. (to the second) MSS.
and the other editions.
But Bentley's emendation is confirmed by the second section of the line, where again we find one μὴ in the question, and but one in the answer.462.
εἶα ἔτι μάλα Pl. editions before Invernizzi;
and Bothe, Bekker, Blaydes, and Zacher afterwards, ἔτι μάλα (without εἶα) the other MSS.
and editions.
But in the corresponding line infra 489 all the MSS.
read εἶα νὴ Δία, which seems to.
require εἶα ἔτι μάλα here.469. ἀλλ’ ἄγεταν ξυνανέλκετε καὶ σφώ.
So I read in my former edition and so Zacher now reads.
The MSS., except V., read ἄγετον ξυνέλκετον καὶ σφὼ, and so all editions before Dindorf.
And at the date of my former edition it was sup­ posed that V.'s reading was the same ;
but it is now clear that V. begins the word with ξυνα- with νε written above the u.
They all omit the initial ἀλλ’.
Hermann proposed ἀλλ’ ἄγετόν ye συνέλ­ κετε καὶ σφώ.
Ahlwardt ἀλλ’ ἄγετ’ ἀλλὰ συνέλκετε καὶ σφώ. Dobree ἀλλ’ ἄγετε ξυνανέλκετε Kal σφὼ, which is followed by Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, and Graves.
And so Holden in his first edition, though himself suggesting ἀλλ’ ἄγεθ’ ἕλκετ’ ἀνέλκετε καὶ σφὼ which in his second edition he introduced into the text.
Dindorf proposed ἀλλ’ ἄγεθ’ ἕλκετον ὦγαθὲ καὶ σφὼ, but in his text prudently substitutes a lacuna for ὦγαθὲ, in which he is followed by Green.
Bothe, who omits the ὼς in line 496 infra, reads ἄγετε ξὺν δ’ ἕλκετε Kat σφώ.
Bergk gives ἀλλ’ ἄγετον ξυνεφέλκετε not σφὼ, and so Paley, Blaydes, and Merry.
Meineke, not observing that the line is dactylic, gives ἀλλ’ ἄγετον νυ̑ν ἕκετε
Kat σφώ, and so Mazon.
Richter ἕλκομεν, aXA' ἄγεθ’ έλκετε καὶ σφώ.
But the strangest alteration of all is made by Van Leeuwen who reads ἂγετον, ξυνέλκετον ἤδη σφὼ, regardless of sense and metre.
I have adopted Dobree's ξυνανέλκετε, though for the reason given in the Commentary retaining with Hermann, Bergk, and Meineke the dual ἄγετον.479.
ἔχονται roG ξύλου MSS. vulgo.
Mr. Richards suggests ἐνέχανται r6 ξύλῳ, whence Van Leeuwen reads ἔχονται ἐν τῳ̑ ξύλῳ.
This expresses the meaning clearly, possibly too clearly, for Hermes seems to be purposely enigmatic.
481.
Μεγαρει̑ς.
The word occurs again infra 500.
In both places V. and P2. have Μεγαρει̑ς;
R. and I. have Μεγαρει̑ς in one place and Μεγαρη̑ς in the other ;
and the only MS.
which has Μεγαρη̑ς in both places is P1., the most untrustworthy of all the MSS.
The great preponderance of authority therefore in these passages is in favour of Μεγαρει̑ς, but Marco Musuro employed Pl. or a very similar MS., and accordingly Μεγαρη̑ς found its way into the Editio Princeps, and has ever since retained its place in the text.
See Acharnians 753 and the Appendix there.489-92.
νὴ Δία ... ἀντισπα̑ν.
The arrangement in the text is that of R. V. I. F. P2.
Half a line, probably consisting of two spondees, is missing.
Pl. attempted to fill up the gap by inserting between 489 and 490 the words ὦ εἶα, & εἶα as in the corresponding system (463), and writing the next line XO.
μικρόν ye κινου̑μεν.
TP. οὐ δεινόν;
and Musuro, as so often in this Play, adopted the alteration of P1., and so all editors before Bekker, Bentley however sug­ gesting that μικρὸν κινου̑μέν γ’ should be read for μικρόν γε κινου̑μεν, and Brunch and Bothe so reading.
The intruding ὦ εἶα, ὦ εἶα was first ejected by Bekker, on the authority of R. V., and save in Weise and Bothe's second edition has never appeared again.
Bekker, wrongly I think, left a blank after δεινὸν, and all subsequent editors have assumed that the missing half-line should come there;
and some have proposed, and some in­ serted, a form of words to fill the gap.
Thus Dindorf proposed δη̑τα τόδ’ ἐστίν;
which Graves reads;
Bergk, δη̑τα τόδ’ ὑμω̑ν, which Herwerden reads:
Holden proposed καὶ δεινότατον. Richter reads του̑τ’ ἔστ’ ὦνδρες;
Blaydes, δη̑τ’ ἐστ’ ὦνδρες;
Merry, κἄτοπον, ὑμω̑ν ;
Sharpley, κἄτοπόν ;
and Van Leeuwen, του̑τ’ ἔστ’ ἤδη.
It seems to me, however, that the blank really comes after ἀντισπα̑ν, and should be filled by words equivalent in meaning to, but less prosaic than, τοὺς δ’ οὐδὲν 8pav.
There are three parties among the Hellenic peoples;
those who are pulling their best;
those who are thwarting them;
and those who are doing nothing, δρω̑σ’ οὐδὲν, supra 481;
and all three should be mentioned here.496.
κακόνοι τινές R. Suidas s. v., Bentley, Tyrwhitt, Brunck, recentiores.
κακὸν οἵ τινες I. P2. KOKOL τινες V. KOKOV εἴ τινες P1, again accepted in the Aldine edition and holding its place till ejected by Brunck.
—ὑμι̑ν MSS., Aldus, and all editions before Gelenius, except Fracini and the second Junta.
ἡμι̑ν Suidas s.v. κακόνοι, Fracini, the second Junta, Gelenius, recentiores.
I had no hesita­ tion in the former edition in restoring the MS.
reading, which seems to me abso­ lutely necessary, for the defaulters are not in the Chorus, but are some of the imaginary peoples, Boeotians, Argives, and the like, who ought to be assisting in, but are in reality retarding, the restoration of Peace.497.
μέν γ’ οὖν (or μὲν yovv) Bentley, Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores, except as hereinafter appears.

μέν νυν Cobet, Meineke, Holden, Her­ werden, Merry, and Graves.503-7. καὶ τοι̑ς Ἀθηναίοισι ... ὑποχω­ ρήσατε.
These lines are given in the text exactly as they stand in every MS.
and in every edition except Van Leeuwen's.
His alterations are worth recording for the purpose of showing the amazing extent to which a Dutch editor considers himself at liberty to rewrite a Play of Aristophanes.
Τοι̑ς Ἀθηναίοισι he changes into τοι̑σι Θηβαίοισι;
δικά­ ζετε into διστάζετε ;
τήνδ’ ἐξελκύσαι into τὴν θεόν ποτε ;
and πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν into ἰδει̑ν παρου̑σ αν.
All these changes are made without a shadow of authority, and, as it seems to me, without a shadow of justification.
511.
ἐξέλκουσι MSS. vulgo.

Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, an ingenious conjecture, but for the reason given in the Commentary I am unable to desert the reading of the MSS.513.

The Scholiast says ὁμου̑ ’στιν ἤδη ἀντὶ του̑ ἐγγὺς, and P1. annexes the ἐγγὺς to the line, reading ὁμου̑ ’στιν ἥδ’ ἐγγύς.
And so, save that they have ἤδ’ for ἥδ’, all editions before Brunck, though both Hemsterhuys and Toup pointed out that ἐγγὺς was a mere gloss on ὁμού.524.
πρόσωπον ὦ Θεωρία MSS. (save that Pl. omits the line, doubtless because it has the same termination as the pre­ ceding line) vulgo.
Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.) proposed to substitute for this second ὦ Θεωρία the words Εἰρήνη φίλη and this is done by Van Leeuwen.
Blaydes observes " Possis etiam ὦ φίλη θεὰ,” whence Mazon reads ὦ θίλη θεός.
No doubt what follows seems more appropriate to Peace herself than to one of her attendant maidens ;
but it is difficult to believe that Trygaeus ad­ dressed the words οἷον δὲ πνει̑ς, &c. to an artificial statue.525.
ὡς ἡδὺ κατὰ τη̑ς καρδίς MSS.
vulgo.
It was a Dutch editor who supra 503-7 substituted his own composition for that of Aristophanes ;
it is an Eng­ lish editor, Dr. Blaydes, who does so here.
For the words in the text he reads ὄζει δὲ καὶ τη̑ς κισίδος, leaving only the article τη̑ς unchanged.
527.
ὅμοιον MSS. vulgo.
Richter reads ὁμίλου.
But after ὅμοιον we must understand τῃ̑ ὀσμῃ̑ as if Trygaeus had used the word ὀσμὴ in the preceding lines.
529.
κρομμυοξυρεγμίας MSS. vulgo.
Do­ bree suggested κρομμξερμίας, which is read by Richter, Holden, Green, and Graves, but is certainly wrong.
As I pointed out in the introduction to my former edition, ὀξυρεγμία is used by Aristophanes in his Σκηνὰς καταλαμ­ βάνουσαι, and by Lucian, De Mercede Conductis, 19, in precisely the same sense.531.
τραγῳδω̑ν MSS. vulgo.
Brunck, and afterwards Bergk, suggested τρυγῳ­ δω̑ν, which is read by Meineke, Richter, Holden, Herwerden, and Zacher.536.
κόλπου MSS. vulgo.
I think that Blaydes is the only editor who has actually altered the text, reading ὄχλον, but many have suggested an alteration.
Reiske proposed κτύπου, Hamaker κώμου, Bergk κάλπῃ, Kock κόπρ
ου, and Hall and Geldart βολίτον.
But nobody has adopted anybody else's conjecture.
­ ἀγρὸν MSS.
Invernizzi, recentiores, ex­ cept Weise.
ἰπνὸν editions before Inver­ nizzi;
and Weise afterwards.
No MS. has ἰπνὸν, but one Scholiast mentions it as a variant;
γράφεται εἰς ἰπνὸν’ ἰπνὸς δὲ, ὃ ἡμει̑ς κομ ίνιον καλ
ου̑μεν.542. κυάθοις πρ
οσκείμεναι Pl. Suidas (s. v. ὑπωπιασμέναι), all editions (except Bekker) before Bergk ;
and Richter and Green afterwards.
κυάθους προσκείμεναι R. V. and the other MSS,, except P1 Bekker, Bergk, recentiores,save as afore­ said.
In this state of the authorities I feel that I too ought to read κυάθους, but I cannot bring myself to believe that κυάθους προσκείμεναι is Greek, or that it can, as Cobet (N. L. 145) assures us, be equivalent to κυάθους προσκειμένους ἔχουσαι.
Nor do I perceive the analogy, upon which he insists, between κύαθον προστίθεμαι and κύαθον πρόσκειμαι, the latter being an intransitive verb.
Nor am I impressed by his argument that “ πρόσκειμαι κυάθω̨ eo fere sensu dicere­ tur quo Cicero usus est 'quum Lentulum generum suum, exiguae staturae homi­ nem, longo gladio accinctum vidisset;
quis, in quit, generum meum ad gladium alligavit?' apud Macrob. Saturn. ii. 3," for that, I take it, is the very meaning which the words arc intended to convey.
With Cicero's jest may be compared the language, which in Beaumont and Fletcher's Bonduca i. 1, the British General uses to his nephew:
And, little sir, when your young bones grow stiffer I'll tie you to a sword ;
and Sir Walter Scott's description, in the second chapter of Old Mortality, of wee Guse Gibbie who " was girded rather to than with the sword of a full grown man.
"557.
ἄσμενός σ’ ἰδὼν Pl. Tyrwhitt, Brunck, recentiores.
ἄσμεν
ος ἰδὼν the other MSS., "pronomen exhausit prae­ cedens litera " as Brunck says.
ἄσμενόςγ᾽ ἰδὼν (apparently an attempt on the part of Musuro to restore the metre) editions before Brunck.568.
αὐτῶν ἀπαλλάξειεν MSS.
vulgo;
but in R. αὐτῶν was originally omitted, and then added in the margin.
Seve­ ral scholars taking αὐτῶν to refer to the agricultural instruments, and not (as it really does) to the farmers themselves, have felt constrained to alter the line.
Herwerden changes αὐτῶν into αὐται̑ς, Sharpley into ἐκ τῶνδ᾽.
These are the only editors who have altered the text, but several other conjectures have been made.
αὐτῶν ἂν ἀπολαύσειεν ἂν μετόρχια, Kock ;
αὔων ἀπαλλάξειαν ἂν μετόρχιον, " they will rid their vineyard spaces of dry leaves," 0. Schneider.
But αὐτῶν is to be joined with μετόρχιον, their vineyard spaces.582.
ώς ἦλθες ἡμῖν ἀσμένοις φιλτάτη.
The reading of the MSS.
and of all editions before Dindorf, and of Zacher afterwards, is ὦ φίλταθ᾽ ὡς ἀαμένοισν ὴμῖν (or ήμίν) ἦλθες, and so Bothe, except that for φίλταθ᾽ he reads φιλτάτη.
Din­ dorf reads ώς ἦλθες ἡμῖν ἀσμένοις ὦ φιλ­ τάτη, and so Weise, Green, Paley, and Blaydes.
The reading which I recom­ mended in my former edition, and have now brought into the text, is really Dindorfs line with the ὦ omitted ;
and so too Richter reads.
Bergk reads ὡς ἀαμένοισιν ἦλθες ὦ φιλτάτη, and so Her­ werden, Hall and Geldart, Merry, and Sharpley.
Meineke reads ὡς ἀσμένοισιν ἦλθες ἡμῖν φιλτάτη, and so Holden and Graves;
and so Mazon, except that he changes φιλτάτη into ὦ φίλη.589.
γεωργῶν.
See the Commentary.
γεωργικὰν MSS., editions (except Bothe) before Bergk ;
and Green and Blaydes afterwards.
γεωργὰν Bothe, Bergk, and (save as aforesaid) recentiores.599.
ἁπάσ᾽ Bentley, Bekker, Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, recentiores.
ἅσ᾽ R. and all the MSS.
except V. and all editions before Brunck.
ἅσσ᾽ V. Bothe. ἅσα γ᾽ Brunck, Invernizzi, Weise.600.
πρασγελάσεται λαβάντ᾽ MSS. (ex­ cept Pl.) Person, Bothe, Bekker, recen­ tiores.
πρασγελάσντίσε λαβάντ᾽ P1., who no doubt took the line to be, as Brunck afterwards contended that it was, " di­ metrum anapaesticum, nisi mails chori­ ambicum trimetrum catalecticum eum appellare " ;
and the reading of Pl. is, as usual, adopted in the Aldine edition, and is followed by all the editions (ex­ cept Fracini and Junta II) before Ge­ lenius ;
and by Brunck and Invernizzi afterwards.
Fracini introduced προσ­ γελάσεται, but retained the σε, and so Junta II and Gelenius to Bergler inclu­ sive.603.
σαφώτατοι MSS. vulgo.
In Archi­ lochus and Cratinus (see the Commen­ tary) the epithet is λιπερνῆτες, and Dio­ dorus Siculus, citing this passage, inad­ vertently transfers that epithet to the present line.
I cannot understand why Bentley proposed to read λιπερνῆτες here, but his suggestion is followed by Bothe, Meineke, Holden, Paley, and Sharpley.605.
ἦρξεν αὐτῆς Bentley.
See the Commentary.
αὐτῆς ἦρξε (contra me­ trum) MSS.
vulgo.
ἦρξν ἄτης Seidler, Dindorf, Weise, Holden, Meineke, Richter, Green, Paley, Merry, and Graves.
Blaydes, though he does not accept this reading, supports it with a vast number of quotations, but in every one of them, with the exception of Medea 1372, the article accompanies the genitive.
A more apposite passage than any which he has cited may be found in Pausanias i. 25.
3 τὰ yap ἀςύχημα TO ἐν Χαιρωνείᾳ ἕπασι ταῖς῞Ελλησιν ἦρξε κακαῦ.
But there the meaning is "was the beginning of troubles," not "commenced the trouble";
and we should certainly expect τῆς ἄτης here.
Bothe in his first edition suggested αὐτὰς ἦρξε, but he did not repeat the suggestion in his second.
Bergk pro­ posed αὐτίχ᾽ εἷρξε, Madvig ἦρξ᾽ ἀὔτῆς, which is adopted by Mazon.
Sharpley for γὰρ αὐτῆς ἦρξε reads κακῶν γὰρ ἦρξε, Van Leeuwen ἦγξεν αὐτὴν, which one would imagine would have put an effec­ tual stop to her going away or return­ ing.
Many other equally hopeless con­ jectures have been made.606.
μετάσχαι R.V.Bekker, recentiores, except Weise and Richter, who with the other MSS.
and the editions before Bekker read μετάσχῃ.610. ἐξεφύαησεν (or -σε) MSS. vulgo.
Bentley suggested κἀξεφύσησεν, which is read by Dindorf, Weise, Holden, and others.612.
τὰ πρῶταν ἤκαυσ᾽ P1., all editions before Bekker ;
and Bothe and Richter afterwards.
ἄκαυσ᾽ R. V. the other MSS., Bekker, and save as herein appears subsequent editors.
Blaydes reads ἁφ­ θεῖσ᾽ and is followed by Herwerden.
And though ἤκαυσ᾽ has been discarded for ἄκαυσ᾽ the latter word has been found so unsatisfactory that every effort has been made to get rid of it.
Widmann suggests ἡβῶσ᾽, Ruppersberg αἴθουσ᾽, Richter ὡς δὲ πυρὶ TO πρῶτον ἀλγοᾶ᾽, Hall and Geldart TO πῦρ ἀκούουσ᾽, Zacher φλογμῷ᾽γανακτοῦσ᾽, and so on.
Probably ἤκουσ᾽ is the conjecture of P1., but if so it is much the best conjecture of the lot, and I have in the Commentary given my reasons for retaining it.
Richter and Zacher say that Aristophanes would not have combined the expressions ἄπαξ τὸ πρῶτον, and that may be true with the reading ἄκουσ᾽;
but it is exactly what he would have done with the reading ἤκουσ᾽ for the purpose of expressing the instantaneous sequence of events.
616.
ἠκηκόειν MSS., editions before Brunck;
and Bergk and Mazon after­ wards.
And this is the form which Aristophanes invariably employed, ex­ cept where metrical or rhythmical rea­ sons compelled him to desert it.
See the Fourth Additional Note to the Birds, p. 244 of that Play.
Brunch changed the reading of all the MSS.
into ἠκηκόη, merely saying “ἠκηκόη Attice.
Vulgo ἠκηκόειν,” and save as aforesaid he is followed by all subsequent editors.
Mr. W. M. Starkie, Classical Review ix. 119, finding that in Wasps 800 Dr. Merry retains the form ἠκηκόειν, exclaims "
Has the teaching of Cobet and Rutherford been writ in water ? "
To the question, so worded, the answer must be in the negative ;
for water has some sustaining power;
but if that very competent scholar, instead of trusting to the "teaching" of others, had looked into the matter for himself, he would have found that this "teaching" has NO­ THING WHATEVER to support it.
Van Leeuwen indeed may be thought to have discovered some support for it in the present passage, for he says that ἠκηκόη is read by " Phrynichus in schol."
But this again is a mistake.
The words of the Scholiast are τὸ δὲ ἠκηκόειν οὖτω διὰ TOV η Φρύνιχος ἀναγινώσκει.
The Scholiast is calling Phrynichus as a wit­ ness in favour not of ἠκηκόη but of ἠκη­ κόειν, and the η to which he refers is the first, not the last, syllable of the word.
He means that the pluperfect is com­ monly written ἀκηκόειν with an a, but that Phrynichus recognizes the spelling ἠκηκόειν with an η.627.
αἰτίων ἂν ἀνδρῶν R. V. Invernizzi, recentiores.
αἰτίων ἀνδρῶν I. F. P2., the ἂν having been absorbed into the first syllable of ἀνδρῶν.
This reading P1., always ready with his emendation, tried to make metrical, by reading αἰτίων ἀνδρῶν γε, and as usual his reading was adopted in the Aldine edition and by all subsequent editors before Brunck who read αἰτίων περ ἀνδρῶν.628.
τὴν κορώνεών (κορώναιόν R. V.) ye μου MSS.
vulgo.
Person, who in his note on Hecuba 1161 discusses lines 628-31, observes " nocet articulus τὴν, ut additus noceret ante ἑξμέδιμνον κυψέλην.
Lege igitur καὶ κορὠνεώγέ μου.”
But this is quite wrong.
There is nothing special about the individual κυψέλην which was destroyed ;
but here Trygaeus is bewailing not merely a fig- tree, but the particular tree which he had planted and tended with such solicitude.
Nevertheless the significant τὴν is changed into the insignificant καὶ by Dindorf, Holden, Meineke, Rich­ ter, Green, Blaydes, and Herwerden.
Equally unfortunate is Van Leeuwen's change of p.ov into μοι, for it is not the general damage done that Trygaeus regrets but the loss of "MY favourite fig-tree."629.
ἐγὼ ’φύτευσα κἀξεθρεψάμην Bentley, Dawes (who adds " Exstat locus plane gemellus apud Eurip.
Med. 1349 παῖδας οὔς ἔφυσα κἀξεθρεψάμην”), Brunck, recentiores, except that in his second edition Bothe reads φυτεύσας ἐξεθρεψάμην ἐγώ. ἐγὼ φυτεύσας ἐξεθρεψάμην MSS., editions before Brunch.630. & μέλ᾽ Junta, vulgo.
& μέλε᾽ MSS.
Aldus, Fracini, Junta II, Gelenius.
ἐνδίκως γε δῆτ᾽ Bentley, Person, Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores, except as herein­ after mentioned.
ἐνδίκως δῆτ᾽ R. V. I. F. P2. Invernizzi, Bekker. P1., being minded to set this right, inserted ye, but inserted it at the wrong place ἐνδίκως δῆτά γ᾽, and so all editions before Brunck.
Brunck in his text wrote ἐνδίκως δῆτ᾽ et ye κἀμαῦ TOP λίθον, but in his note preferred εἴγε δὴ κἀμοῦ λίθον.
Person for ἐνδίκως suggested ἐν δίκῃ, which is read by Herwerden, Merry, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.—κἀμοῦ λίθον is the reading of all the MSS.
except P1., and of Fracini, Junta II, Gelenius to Faber inclusive, Invernizzi, and all subsequent editors.
τὰν λίθον P1. Aldus and the other editors before Invernizzi.632. κᾆτα 8' ὡς MSS.
vulgo.
κἀνθάδ᾽ as Dobree, Blaydes, Herwerden, Merry, and Van Leeuwen.637.
κεκράγμασιν MSS. vulgo.
Scaliger suggested καὶ κράγμασι which Blaydes reads.640.
φρονοῖ MSS. (except p1.)
Brunck, Bekker, Dindorf, Weise, Bothe, Bergk, Green, Paley, Merry, and Mazon. φρονεῖ P1. vulgo.—τὰ Βρασίδαυ MSS. vulgo.
Person called attention to the fact that Suidas (s. v.), quoting the present line, writes τὰ Βρασίδα.
Of course he did not suggest that this slip of Suidas should be brought into the text of Aristophanes, but that is done by Dindorf, Bothe, Meineke, Holden, Herwerden, and Van Leeuwen.
Dindorf however recants in his notes;
and the others do not seem to have observed that with Thucydides the genitive is always Βρασίδαυ (Thuc. iv. 83, 108, 123, 127, v. 13), the dative Βρασίδᾳ, and the accusative Βρασίδαν.663. εἶεν ἀκούω MSS. (except Pl.) Fracini, Junta II, Gelenius, Bekker, recentiores, except Weise.
Pl., to save the metre, wrote εἶέν y', and so the other editions before Beaker;
and Weise afterwards.
But the present reading is sufficiently confirmed by, possibly is borrowed from, Aesch.
Cho. 644.676. οὗπερ Bentley, Brunch, recen­ tiores.
ὅπερ R. V. I. F. P2., but in R. there is a considerable gap between the o and the περ.
Pl. corrected ἅπερ into ὥσπερ which is read by all editions before Brunck.684.
αὑτῷ MSS. (αὐτῷ R. V. F.) vulgo.
Cobet (N. L. p. 165) conjectured αὕτω, a probable conjecture in itself, though the arguments by which he supports it are naught.
It is adopted by Meineke, Blaydes, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.693.
τὰ τί MSS. (τατί R. V.) vulgo.
Reiske suggested either τὰ τί or τίνα :
the former is adopted by Holden, Sharpley, and Graves, the latter by Herwerden, Merry, and Van Leeuwen.
By so doing these editors have destroyed an idiomatic expression, perfectly in­ telligible, if not easy to explain.
τί is often used with a plural pronoun:
τί γὰρ τάδ’ ε’στίν ;
Clouds 200, τί δέ σοι ταυ̑ ;
(so all the best MSS.) Lys. 514.700. τί δαί* I. F. P2. Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
τί δέ R. V. Pl. editions before Bruuck.716.
ῥοφήσεις MSS. (V. has the double s superscript), all editions before Din­ dorf;
and Bergk, Richter, Merry, Mazon, and Zacher afterwards.
See Ach. 278, Knights 360.
Elmsley's theory (at Ach. 278), that because ῥοφήσομαι is found in Wasps 814 Aristophanes could never have used the active future ῥοφήσω, is negatived in every passage by every MS.
Yet ῥοφήσει is here introduced by Dindorf who is followed by subsequent editors, save as aforesaid.
See Appendix on Knights 360 and 969.729, 730.
παραδόντες ... δῶμεν MSS. vulgo.
The combination of these two words in one sentence is no doubt a little awkward, but I do not think that it is inadmissible.
Bothe however proposed to change παραδόες into παρελόντες.
Hamaker's suggestion τήνδε σκευὴν ἀπο­ δύντες is adopted and applauded by Cobet (N. L. p. 51), but has found favour with nobody else.
Meineke changes δῶμεν into φῶμεν and is followed by Herwerden.
Blaydes reads καταθέντες for παραδόντες, and so Van Leeuwen.
Mr. Richards for παραδόντες proposes παραβάντες.
Mr. Richards objects to Hamaker's sugges­ tion that "an article would surely be wanted."
Schmidt to Meineke's that φημὶ is never, though λέγω is often, used in the sense of κελεύω.
Herwerden and Mr. Richards to Blaydes's that it ought to be καταθέμενοι. And Van Leeuwen to Mr. Richards's that it ought to be κατα­ βησόμενοι.
Two lines below Hamaker wished to change σκηνὰς into σκευὰς, and this also is approved by Cobet (u. s.) but by nobody else.732.
φυλάττετε* V. Bekker, recentiores, except Weise. φύλαττε (by a natural error) R. F. P2.
This left the line a syllable short, which Pl. attempted to make good by reading φύλαττε σὺ, and so all editions before Bekker;
and Weise afterwards.
733. ἢν ἒχομεν ὁδὸν λόγων εἲπωμεν ὂσα re νοῦ ἒχει R. and (except that for ἣν it has ἢν) I. ἢν ἒχωμεν (and then as R.) F. P2. ἢν ἒχωμεν ὁδὸν λόγων εἲπομν (and then as R.) V.
In order to make the line an anapaestic tetrameter Pl. changed λόγων into λόγον, ὂσα re into χὢσα τε (" quae scribere non poterat Atticus," Parson, Suppl. Praef. in Hec.), and inserted αὐτὸς before, and ye after ἒχει, so making the line run ἣν ἒχομεν ὁδὸν λόγον εἲπωμν, χὢσα τε νοῦς αὐτὸς ἒχει γε.
In the Aldine edition some but not all of P1.’s alterations are adopted, and the line is given as ἣν ἔχομεν ὁδὸν λόγων εἲπωεν χὢσα τε νοῦς αὐτὸς ἒχει, a nonde­ script verse, being neither a trochaic tetrameter with R. nor an anapaestic with Pl.
And this is followed by every edition before Brunck (except that Florent Chretien and Grynaeus for αὐτὸς ἒχει have ἒχει αὐτὸς), and by Bothe in his first edition.
Brunck inserted the line as P1 gave it, and so Invernizzi.
And, except that I changed χὢσα re into χὠπόσα, I did the same in my former edition, under a complete misunder­ standing of the reading of R., which had been reported by Invernizzi, Bekker, and Dindorf to be ἣν ἒχομεν ὁδὸν, λόγον εἲπωμεν, the commencement of an ana­ paestic, not trochaic, line.
But, strange to say, Bekker, while misreporting R.'s reading, gave in his text what R. really reads, a trochaic tetrameter ἣν ἒ|χομεν ὁ|δὸν λόγ|ων εἲπωμεν I ὂσα re I νοῦς ἒ|χει.
And though one of the Scholiasts says that the κομμάτιν consists of five anapaestic tetrameters, another says it consists of four anapaestic tetrameters, and the cor­ rupt and confused words which follow can only mean " and one trochaic tetrameter."
Bekker's, which is really R.'s, reading has been followed by all subsequent editors, except that Weise embarks on an unintelligible line of his own, and that he, Blaydes, Herwerden, and Merry change νοῦς into νοῦν.742.
φεύγντας MSS. vulgo. " Lege Φρυνώνδς :
vide Hesych.
Harpocrat. Suid."
Bentley.
This line does not seem very applicable to Heracles, and Bergk placed it after the following line, so as to make it a description of τοὺς δαύλους, a transposition followed by several editors.
But this necessitates a further alteration, since ἐπίτηδες and οὓνεκα τουδὶ would be merely tauto­ logous.
One or the other therefore of the two lines must be omitted, and this is accordingly done.
On the whole I think it better to adhere to the ar­ rangement of the MSS., and to suppose that the poet is referring to scenes in Comedies now lost, but familiar to his audience.
743.
παρέλυσεν R. V. Bekker, recen­ tiores, except Weise.
κατέλυσν the other MSS. and editions.
In the next line Paley would change ἐξῆγον into εἰσῆγον, but the poet is referring to the abrupt exit of a flogged slave from his master's house, like that of Demosthenes and Nicias in the Knights.
747.
TO νῶτον Suidas (s. v. ὑστριχὶς), Bekker, recentiores, except Weise and Bothe.
τὸν νῶτον MSS., except P1., who altered it into τὰ Para.
His alteration, as usual, is adopted in the Aldine edition, and is followed by all editors before Bekker;
and by Weise and Bothe afterwards.752.
τοῖσι μεγίστοις MSS.
vulgo.. θηρσὶ μεγίστοις Merry, Sharpley.
This is a very ingenious alteration, but it cannot I think be right.
Apart from the overwhelming unanimity of the MSS., both here and in the Parabasis of the Wasps, it seems to me that τοίσι μεγίστοις is exactly what we should have expected to find.
Just as Aristophanes says in the Ecclesiazusae that Agyrrhius now πράττει τὰ μέγιστα, undertakes the most important business, and in the Birds that τὰ μέγιστα, the most important benefits that men possess, are derived from the birds, so here he would natu­ rally say that the poetic Heracles essays the most important tasks, ἐπιχειρεῖ
τοῖσι μεγίστοις*.
On the other hand, though θηρσὶ is in some respects very appro­ priate, it gives rise to some slight difficulty.
Here there is but one an­ tagonist;
and in the Wasps the Agues and Fevers, the extirpation of which constitutes the Second Labour of Heracles, though rightly called τὰ μέγιστα, could hardly, perhaps, be called θῆρες.
—ἐπεχείρει R. V. and all the other MSS. (except Pl.), Bentley, Bekker, re­ centiores, except Weise and Bothe ἐπιχειρεῖ Pl. and (as usual) Aldus and all editions before Bekker;
and Weise and Bothe afterwards.
But Bentley had long before suggested ἐπεχείρει;
the present tense is not employed until the poet is represented as speaking in his own person.
754.
Kat πρῶτον μὲν μάχομαι πάντων MSS.
vulgo.
Here the poet commences, as it were, to speak in his own person, and this is continued to the end of the Parabasis Proper.
He is borrowing from the Parabasis of the Wasps, and naturally introduces a few changes to prevent an absolute sameness.
Will it be believed that, in defiance of all the MSS.,
Meineke thinks himself justified in striking out the new words, intro­ duced into this line by Aristophanes, and replacing the discarded words θραϭέως ξυϭτὰς εὐθύς ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ?
And this singular impropriety is repeated by Holden, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, and Graves.
Van Leeuwen indeed disap­ proves of the poet's speaking in his own person, and alters the succeeding verses in various ways, which it is not necessary to record, for the purpose of preventing his doing so.
For μὲν μάχομαι Richter wrote δὴ’μαχόμην.756.
κεφαλαὶ MSS. vulgo.
Meineke changed this into γλῶτται, and is followed by Holden, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, and Graves.
The alteration is sometimes ascribed to Bentley, but apparently without any justification.
The passage of Hesiod to which Aristophanes is referring is ἐκ δέ οἱ ὤμων | ἦν ἑκατὸν κεφαλαὶ ὄφιος, δεινοῖο δράκοντος | γλώϭϭηϭι δνοφερῆϭι λελειχμότς (Theog. 823-5), where, observe, it is the κεφαλαὶ, and not the γλῶτται, that are described as λελειχμότες.758.
καμίνου R. V., the other MSS. (except Pl.) and Suidas, s.v. πρωκτός.
No word can be better authenticated, yet it does not appear in a single printed edition excepting my former one;
in which I also suggested that perhaps κάμινον would be better.
For Pl. with his usual readiness to alter the text introduced καμήλου from Wasps 1035.
Aldus, as usual, adopted the reading of Pl.;
and all other editions, with the exception aforesaid, follow Aldus.761.
ἀποδοῦναίμοιτὴνχάριν MSS.(except Pl.) Kuster, recentiores, except Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.
P1. omitted the μοι and so did all editions before Kuster.
It did not appear on what authority, if any, Kuster inserted the μοι, and Bentley suggested ἀνταποδοῦναι τὴν χάριν, a very good suggestion, but one which Bentley would never have made, had he been aware of the reading of the MSS.
However a century and a half or so after Bentley's death, and with full know­ ledge of the MS.
reading, ἀνταποδοῦναι is introduced into the text first by Blaydes and then by Van Leeuwen, the former omitting the τὴν, the latter the μοι.762.
περινοϭτῶν MSS. vulgo.
This word too was omitted in all editions before Kuster, was restored by Kuster, and is read by all subsequent editors except Van Leeuwen.
Here too Bentley, sup­ posing περινοϭτῶν to be Kuster's con­ jecture, suggested περιήειν, with πειρῶν for ἐπείρων in the following line, and here too Bentley's suggestion is intro­ duced into the text by Van Leeuwen.770.
καὶ ξυμποϭίοις MSS. vulgo.
Meineke suggested κἀν ξυμπαϭίοις, a quite unnecessary alteration, but adopted by Blaydes, Herwerden, and Van Leeuwen.
Richter absurdly understands τραπέζη of the tables of the money-changers.
774.
ἀνδρὸς MSS. vulgo.
Dindorf, misunderstanding the passage, proposed λαμπρὰν, which is read by Meineke, Holden, Richter, and Paley.
Bergk proposed ἁδρὸν, but the reading of the MSS.
is clearly right.783.
ἀντιβολῆ Pl. P2. (according to Brunck) Brunck, Bothe, Bekker, recen­ tiores.
ἀντιβαλεῖ R. V. and the other MSS.
(but V. has ῆ written above the εῖ) editions before Brunck ;
and Invernizzi afterwards.
I suspect that ἀντιβολεῖ is right, see on 450 supra;
but there seems sufficient authority to permit the reten­ tion of ἀντιβολῇ.785.
ὑπάκουε Bentley, Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores.
ύπακαύϭης MSS., editions (except Bothe) before Dindorf.—ἒλθης MSS.
vulgo.
Bentley also proposed to change this into ἐλθὲ followed by ξυνέριθος, but to this Dobree rightly ob­ jected, referring to Lys. 733μὴ διαπετάνν, μηδ’ ἀπέλθης μηδαμῆ, as a similar com­ bination of an imperative and sub­ junctive.
Of. Aesch. Eum. 767 μὴ βαρὺν κότον | ϭκήψηϭθε, μὴ θυμοῦϭθε, μηδ’ ἀκαρ­ πίαν | revere.
800.
ἠρινὰ MSS.
Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
ἠρινᾷ (agreeing with φωνῇ, its voice of spring) editions before Brunck:
a very good reading, if the metre permitted it.
ἠρινὰ may either be governed by κελαδῇ, and agree with κελαδήμαρα understood, verna (sc. carmina) cantat;
or else be used adverbially, as Brunch thinks, verno tempore cantat.802.
ἑζομένη MSS. vulgo.
And this is a characteristic of the swallow's song, for practically it is only heard when the bird is perching :
see the Commentary.
Its flight is so rapid that even if it is singing on the wing an observer can only catch an occasional note.
Bergk however changed ἑζομένη into ἡδομἐνη, and is followed by Van Leeuwen and Zacher.
The change, though unen­ durable, is not without excuse, since we should expect an epithet with φωνῇ, and we have ἡδαμένα̣ φωνᾷ in Birds 236.
But what are we to say to Meineke's absurd ἡδομέη agreeing with χελιδών ?
It is difficult to speak of it in parliamentary language.
Possibly the use of φωνῃ without an epithet is due to the fact that κελαδεῖν may be employed of any loud noise, and is not confined to vocal sounds.831.
ἐνδιαεριαυερινηχέτους R. V. Berg!:
, Meineke, Richter, Holden, Paley, Her­ werden, Hall and Geldart, Zacher, Graves.
For -avept- the other MSS.
have -ανερι- and so all editions (except Bothe's second) before Bergk, and Paley afterwards.
-avpo- Bothe in his second edition.
-αεριαερι- Richter.
-αιθερι- Reisig, Green, Merry. ἐνδιαπεριαερι- Blaydes, Mazon.
-αεριαυρι- Sharpley.
These I think are the only alterations introduced into the text, but the conjectures offered for our acceptance are innumerable.
Dr. Blaydes, for ex­ ample, offers eleven in his critical note;
and, not content with that, adds six more in his Addenda.
As regards the first syllables of the word Bentley suggested εὐδι, and this is adopted by Green.
Bothe too reads εὐδι-, but takes εὐ as equivalent to εὐ.
Van Leeuwen omits the line.
The reading -αυερι- (perhaps a burlesque on -aept-) is very old.
The Scholiast says Δίδυμος πεπλάνηται λέγων "αὐεριηχέτους” οὐ γὰρ λέγουϭιν αὐέρα οὗτοι.835.
TP. ῎Ιων ὁ Χῖος ὅσπερ K. τ. X.
So all the MSS.
and all editions before Bergk, and save as hereinafter appears all subsequent editions.
But with Bergk the assaults of the conjecturers com­ menced.
Bergk continued the words ῍Ιων ὁ Χῖος to the Servant, and commenced the speech of Trygaeus with ὅϭτις ;
ἐποίηϭεν πάλαι, which was plainly impos­ sible, and has been followed by nobody.
Next Meineke tried his hand and con­ tinued the Servant's speech to ᾽Ααῖόν ποθ᾽.
This was adopted by Richter and Holden, but was really as preposterous as Bergk's.
Herwerden gives to Trygaeus the Ser­ vant's share of line 834,so that Trygaeus speaks continuously from μάλιϭα to ἐκάλουν ὀστέρα.
Wilamowitz, reverting to Bergk's division of the line, com­ mences the speech of Trygaeuswith ὅνπερ ἐποίηϭεν πάλαι, an ingenious suggestion, which Zacher adopts, but this makes an involved sentence, unsuited to the sprightly directness of an Aristophanic dialogue.
The MS.
reading, alone, stands free from all possible objection.847.
ταύτας ϭύ ;
TP.
πόθεν;
ἐκ τοὺρανοῦ R. V. Bekker, Richter, Paley, Mazon, Van Leeuwen.
ταῦτα ϭύ;
TP. πόθεν ;
ἀκ τῶν οὐρανῶν the other MSS.
and all editions before Brunck, who for ταῦτα ϭύ wrote ταύτα.
Invernizzi gave as R.'s reading, and himself read (contra me­ trum) TOUT-a ϭύ ;
TP.
πόθεν ;
ἐκ τούρανοῦ.
Tyrwhitt altered ταῦτα into ταύτα, and so Bathe, who in other respects followed Invernizzi, and this was supposed to be R.'s actual reading and, except as herein mentioned, is adopted by subsequent editors.
Hirschig suggested ταύτας ;
TP.
όπόθεν ;
ἐκ τοὐρανοῦ, which is read by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Merry, and Graves.851. ἂγε νυν ἲωμεν.
These words given to the Servant by all the MSS.
and vulgo are, on the suggestion of Boissonade (approved by Meineke) transferred to Trygaeus by Holden, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Merry, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and Graves.
This is plainly wrong.
Trygaeus was not going any­ where.
He has told the Servant to take Harvesthome in for her bridal bath, and then to bring her back again.
Accordingly the Servant now calls upon the girl to go in with him.
It is to her that these words are addressed.
There is the less excuse for this tampering with the text, because the passage is carefully explained by the Scholiast;
ὁ θεράπων852.
ταύτῃ τι ;
P1. P2. Brunck, recen­ tiores.
ταύτη τι ;
the other MSS.
and all editions before Brunck.
And Cobet again suggested τί, apparently as his own conjecture.
But the Servant, being ordered merely to take Harvesthome to the bath and then bring her back again, without any mention of refreshments, would be much more likely to say Shall I give her anything to eat than What shall I give her to eat ?860.
γέρων Pl. Bergk, Meineke,Richter, Holden, Paley, Herwerden, Merry, Van Leeuwen.
And so I read in my former edition, since a glyconic line cannot end with a pyrrhic, except at the close of a sentence ;
see Appendix to Eccl.
307. γέραν the other MSS.
and editions.864. φανει̑ R. V. Bentley, Tyrwhitt, Brunck, recentiores, except Bekker. φανεὶς P2., all editions before Brunck, and Bekker afterwards.
Both R. and V. have a line (the mark of a new speaker) before this verse, but the other MSS.
continue the verse to Trygaeus, whence no doubt the reading φανεὶς arose.
Bentley corrected φανεὶς into φανει̑ and restored the line to the Chorus.
Then, in all editions before Dindorf (except Invernizzi), the following speech of Trygaeus is arranged as three tetrameter iambics, the first line ending with κανθάρου βὰς, the second with ἐν ται̑ς ἀγροι̑σιν αἰτοὺς, and the third with καθεύδειν (the readings of Pl.), so that Trygaeus had, in the whole, a speech consisting of five consecutive tetra­ meters.
Invernizzi following R. (with which V. concurs) divided the first line of Trygaeus's speech into two, the second ending with ’πιβὰς, but this was not followed.
Dindorf was the first to arrange the speech as in the text and Holden the first to adopt his arrange­ ment, since which time it has been universally accepted.872.
τη̑ βουλη̑ τι. 01. ταυτηνί;
V. (except that it gives all four words to Trygaeus) Meineke, Richter, Holden (in his second edition), and Mazon.
R. for ταυτηνὶ has ταυτηὶ, but otherwise agrees with V. τη̑ βουλη̑. 01. τίς ἐσθ’ αὔτη;
P1. vulgo.
It is very unusual to find ἀνὑσάς TL separated by any intervening word ;
and the readings in the editions are very diversified, some adhering to the actual reading of R. and others to that of V;
some making the servant say ταυτηί;
TL φής ;
or τί ;
ταυτηνί;
τι φής ;
Or τίς αὑτηί;
τί φής, and others arranging the words otherwise.874.
ἐπαίομεν MSS. vulgo.
Kock first, and Blaydes afterwards, proposed ἐπέμπομεν, which is read by Sharpley and Graves.—ὑποπεπωκότες Pl. Bergler, recen­ tiores.
ὑποπεπτωκότες R. V. P2., all editions before Bergler, but the true reading had been suggested by Nannius, Leopardus, and Scaliger.
And the true meaning had been recognized through­ out.
For though Andrea Diva translated the word " subcadentes” Florent Chretien gave " potabundi," and his was the accepted version before Bergler.882.
ἐς μέσους αὐτός σ’.
So I wrote the line in my former edition, and so Graves.
The pronoun σ’ had not previously been inserted, ς (or εἰς) μέσους αὐταὺς R., all the other MSS. (except V.), and all editions before Dindorf.
Unfortunately Bekker gave αὐτοὺς is μέσους (which is V.'s reading) as the reading of R., and this being unmetrical Seidler proposed αὐτὰς ἐς μέσους, which is read by Dindorf and all subsequent editors except as hereinafter mentioned.
Green proposed αὐτὰς ἐς μέσον σ’, and so Blaydes, Merry, and Sharpley.
Herwerden proposed αὐτὰς ἐς μέσαυς σ’, which is read by Mazon.
These alterations depart rather more widely from the general reading of the MSS.
than mine, and I am not sure that ἐς μέσον gives the right sense.
Trygaeus speaks of introducing Mayfair into the senatorial benches;
is μέσον might mean that he was about to exhibit her in the centre of the stage.886.
τὰ σκεύη R.V. vulgo.
τὴν σκευὴν Meineke, Herwerden, Merry. For, says Meineke, “sequentia ostendunt aperte jubere Trygaeum Theoriam ut nudam sese spectandam praebeat."
The learned professor does not seem to be aware that, just as actors who repre­ sented men wore the penem scorteum outside their clothes, so actors who represented women exhibited the signs of womanhood outside (or on) their clothes, though even the dozen preceding lines might have taught him that.
And he must have forgotten that if Mayfair " nudam sese spectandam praebuisset" she would have shown that she was not a woman but a man.890.
μετέωρα MSS. vulgo.
Blaydes suggested μετεώρω, which is read by Herwerden, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.—καταγαγει̑ν MSS.
vulgo.
Blay­ des conjectured κᾆτ ἀγαγει̑ν, which Herwerden and Van Leeuwen read.
But I doubt if κᾆταcan be used, like εἶτα, to combine a participle with a verb.
891.
ὁρα̑τε τοὐπτάνιαν ἡμι̑ν καλόν.
This is the reading of Pl. Brunch, Invernizzi, and Weise, except that for ἡμι̑ν they read ὑμι̑ν.
ὁρα̑τε τοὐπτάνιον is the reading of all the MSS., but in R. it is followed by ἡμι̑ν ὡς καλὸν, in V. by ὡς καλὸν ἡμι̑ν, and in the other MSS. (except P1.) by ὑμι̑ν ὡς καλόν, all three readings being unmetrical.
Save as aforesaid all editors retain the ὡς, most of them reading with Bentley ὁρα̂τ’ ὀπτάνιον, and others with Bekker opa τοὐπτάνιον, some in each case adding ἡμι̑ν and others ὑμι̑ν.
I am unwilling to give up the ὡς, but more unwilling to give up the article τὸ ὸπτάνιον which every MS.
reads.
And therefore I follow on this point the reading of P1.892.
κεκάπνικέ rap'.
So I read in the former edition, the various readings of the MSS.
κεκάπνικ’ἄρα, or ap', or ἆρ’ being all unmetrical.
One or other of them was followed by all the earlier editions.
Brunch read κεκάπνικεν ἆρ’, which is followed by Invernizzi, Bergk, Mazon, and Zacher.
Dindorf read κεκάπνικεν ἄρ’, changing the ένταυ̑θα yap which follows in the MSS.
into ἐντευ̑θεν yap ἦν, and omitting the ἦν at the end of the next verse, and others have done much the same.
Blaydes inserts rot before καὶ κεκάπνικ’, and so Herwerden.
Several editors give this and the next line to the Servant.897.
πλαγίαν καταβάλλειν κ.τ.λ.
This line was introduced by Invernizzi from R. and is adopted by all subsequent editors except Bothe.
It does not ap­ pear in any other MS., and it is difficult to see how it applies to the festival.
I expect that Aristophanes, observing this, superseded it by the line ἐπὶ γη̑ς παλαίειν κ.τ.λ.906. θέασ’ R. V. and all MSS. (except Pl.) Invernizzi, recentiores, except Weise and Merry, and except that Dindorf introduced the spelling θα̑σ’ which has been adopted by several editors, quite unnecessarily;
see on 48 supra. ἴθ’ Pl. editions before Brunck. ἴδ’ Brunck and Weise. θασ̑θ’ Merry, referring to Ach. 770.909. πολίταις Hermann, Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, Green, Paley, Herwerden, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and Graves. πολίτης MSS.
vulgo.
Hermann's emendation seems to me indubitably right.
Such a sentence as χρηστὸς ἀνὴρ πολίτης ἐστὶν ἅπασιν would be singularly top-heavy;
and though ἅποσιν does not necessarily require a substantive, it would in all probability have one here as it has four lines below.910.
ὅστις ἐστὶ F. Herwerden, Van Leeuwen.
ὅστις ἐστὶν R. V. and all the other MSS.
except Pl. who (I presume from an erroneous notion that the metre required it) inserted γ̕between ὅστις and ἐστὶ, and so vulgo.916.
φήσεις γ̕Dindorf, recentiores, excepting Hall and Geldart and Van Leeuwen.
φήσεις MSS., editions before Dindorf;
and Hall and Geldart after­ wards.
The ye seems to be required where the assent takes this shape;
infra 1350, Knights 1388.—ἐπειδὰν K.r.X. R. V. and all the MSS. (except Pl.) Fracini, Gelenius, Portus, Scaliger, Faber, Brunck, recentiores, except Van Leeu­ wen.
Pl. after φήσεις inserted τί δη̑τ̕̕̕̕’ (no doubt from its double appearance in the strophe 859 and 863) and omitted νέου, and so all editions, except Fracini, be­ fore Gelenius.
Rapheleng omitted both τί δη̑τ’ and νέου, so making the line a foot too short, and Kuster and Bergler in­ serted them both, so making it a foot too long.
Tyrwhitt proposed to substitute τί δη̑τ̕̕’ for φήοεις, and this is done by Van Leeuwen.918.
ἄξιος MSS. vulgo.
Dawes (at Ach. 633) changed this to αἴτιος, which is quite inadmissible.
But he atoned for this error by adding the article to Ἀθ­ μονεὺς, in which he is followed by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
The first syllable ofἈθμονεὺς is short in 190 supra.
The name Τρυγαι̑ος is omitted in Pl. and in all editions before Brunck, but was restored by Bentley, was found by Brunck in P2., has since been discovered in R. V. and the other MSS., and is read by Brunck and all subsequent editors.921.
τὸν δημότην.
After this word the MSS.
and all editions before Dindorf insert ὅμιλον, which is shown by the corresponding verse in the strophe to be an interpolation.
It is therefore omitted by Dindorf and all subsequent editors, except Bothe, Hall and Geldart, and Zacher.924.
Ἑρμίδιον MSS.
vulgo, but the same alterations have been made here as were made supra 382.926.
δέη Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, Green, recen­ tiores.
δέοι MSS. vulgo.
But in V. the word is written on an erasure, and I cannot, in the photogravure, decipher it with certainty.
928.
θεαγένους MSS., all editions be­ fore Dindorf;
and Weise, Bothe, Bergk, Mazon, and Zacher afterwards.
θεογέ­ νους Dindorf and (save as aforesaid) recen­ tiores.
There is no ground for confusing the two names, which are quite distinct.
The θεο- is pronounced as a mono­ syllable as in θέασ’ supra 906.
See Ap­ pendix on Lys. 63.929.
τῳδὴR. Fracini,Gelenius,Raphe­ leng, Portus, Scaliger, Faber, Inver­ nizzi, and (so far as the τῷ is concerned) all subsequent editors ;
but in order to avoid the combination of δὴ and Sira, Meineke introduced τῷ δαὶ, and is fol­ lowed by Blaydes, Herwerden, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.
τί δὴ the other MSS.
and editions.931.
TO ῥῆμά y' K.T.X.
Except that I have substituted εἰ ’ν for ἐν, this line stands in my text exactly as it does in Pl. and in all editions before Brunck.
And the other MSS.
agree with P1., save only that they omit the γ’ and give τὸ ῥῆμα.
ἐπίτη
δές y', a reading which pos­ tulates the insertion of γ’.
Bergler proposed ἵν’ εἰ ἐν " si εἰ corripiendum est ante ἐν, v.el si correptio fieri non potest, λέγων pro λέγει ut sit λέγων pro λέγοντος.”
The latter suggestion was again ad­ vanced by Elmsley who proposed (at Ach. 335) to read τὸ ῤῆμ’ ἐπίτηδες οὖν with λέγων in the following line as a nominative absolute.
This seems very improbable, but is adopted by Dindorf and Paley.
Bentley proposed to sub­ stitute εὶ for ἐν, and so Brunck.
Por­ son, also reading TO ῥῆμ’, proposed to insert ἐὰν between ἵν’ and ἐν, and this is followed by Bothe, Weise, and Richter.
Meineke inserted ὅταν in the same place, and so Holden, Green, Blaydes, recen­ tiores, with λέγη in the following line.
The reading of R. and all the MSS.
(except V.) there is λέγει, but V. has λέγη.939.
θεὸς θέλη MSS. vulgo;
but θεὸς is omitted in all editions before Gelenius.
θεοὶ θέλωσι Mazon.943.
ἐπείγετε MSS. vulgo.
ἀπείγετε Aldus, Junta, and Junta II.
The line is omitted in Fracini, but the Scholiast has ἐπείγετε.
Some editors have thought that, as the three following lines are anapaestic, this should be the same.
It is said (in Bekker's edition) that Dindorf adopted ἄγ’ ἐπείγετε at Hermann's sug­ gestion.
This must have been in some early edition.
Dindorf ignores it alto­ gether in his Oxford edition, and in his treatise De Metris.
It is however read by Richter, Holden, Sharpley, and Graves.
“Hotibius ” suggested κατεπεί­ γετε which is read by Mazon.
It is however to be observed that the first line in each speech of the Chorus in this and in the corresponding system is metrically different from its successor:
and the simple ἐπείγετε seems more for­ cible and more elegant without the ἄγ’ or the κατ-.948-1011.
τὸ κανοῦν ... τὸν δ’ ὀτοτύξειν.
These 64 lines are omitted in 1. F. Pl. P2 and in Aldus, Junta, Gormont, and Junta II.
They were first introduced by Fracini (it is supposed from R.) and are found in Cratander, Zanetti, Far­ reus, and all subsequent editors.
Al­ dus between lines 947 and 1012 has the word “ΑΕΙΠΕΙ,”the three others have “ΑΕΙΠΕΙ.
ὸ δὲ λεῖπον ἄδηλον.”
But all the 64 lines are contained in R. and V.951.
ἢν Χαῖρις ὑμᾶς R. V. vulgo.
The line, as it stands, must be taken as an iambic dipody, followed by a cretic.
In order to make it an iambic Bentley proposed o Χαῖρις ἢν ὑμᾶς, and Brunck, borrowing the final word of the preced­ ing line, reads ὡς Χαῖρις ἢν ὑμᾶς;
while in order to make it a glyconic Bergk reads ἢν Χαῖρις ὀλὰς.
In the antistrophe we have εν ἄνδρα τοιοῦτον, and though the first syllable of τοιοῦτος is often long, as in Knights 49, Wasps 384, Birds 136, &c., it is more commonly short.
The line is probably glyconic, but ὀλὰς seems grotesque.
Something like ἢν Χαῖρις τύχη would be preferable.952.
ἄκλητος αὐλῶν Bergk, Richter Blaydes, Herwerden, Sharpley, the cor­ responding line in the antistrophe being glyconic -τις πόλλ’ ἀνατλὰς ἔσω.
αὐλήσων ἄκλητος R. V. vulgo.
Dindorf, taking (I suppose) the mid-syllable of ἀνατλὰς to be long, proposed αὐλῶνἄκλητος, which is followed by Weise, Holden, Green, Paley, Merry, and Graves, though Din­ dorf himself speedily discovered his error, and adopted Bergk's reading.953.
τόδ’ οἶδ’ Weise.
τοῦθ’εὖ οἶδ’ R. V. (the οἶsuperscript in V).
τοῦτ’ εὖ οἶδ’ vulgo.
σάφ’ οἶδ’ Dindorf, Bergk, Richter, Green, Blaydes, Herwerden, Sharpley.
Here again the correspond­ ing line in the antistrophe is glyconic -ςο τὴν ἱερὰν πόλιν.
Bothe in his second edition for κᾆτα τόδ̕̕’ reads κἀντὶ τοῦδ’.959.
δαλίον, οὖτω διὰ τοῦ X ό τὴν κωμικὴν .
γράψας λέξιν ἀναγινώσκει, and again οὐ γραπτέον, ὥς τινες, δδίον, Scholiast.
δαλίον οὖτως οἱ κωμικοὶ διὰ τοῦ A. " φέρε δὴ τὸ δαλίον τόδ’ ἐμβάψω,” Suidas.
Brunck therefore in his notes proposed to read δαλίον here, as indeed Bentley had previously suggested.
And this is done by Bothe, Dindorf, and all subsequent editors.
δαδίον R. V. and all other editors before Dindorf.960.
σείου σὺ R. V. vulgo.
Both the reading and the meaning are so clear and satisfactory that we might have expected this passage to escape the attacks of the conjecturers.
But Blaydes offers five alternatives, one of which, σείσω τε, is adopted by Herwerden and Sharpley.973.
ἀλλ’ ὡς τάχιστ’ K. τ. X. Neither R. nor V. has the sign of a new speaker before this line, so that, with them, it is a continuation of the preceding speech.
Accordingly in Fracini and in all editions prior to that called Scaliger's, and in Kuster and Bergler afterwards, it is continued to the Servant.
In “ Scaliger's " and " Faber's " it is given to Trygaeus, to whom it was restored by Brunck and by all subsequent editors before Bergk ;
and by Green and Paley afterwards.
But Bentley and Tyrwhitt suggested that the last two words belong to a second speaker, and V. is found to preface them (though R. does not) with the sign of a new speaker.
And the δὴ is certainly apt fora speaker not making, but assenting to, a proposal.
And so, though the first four words have been left to Trygaeus, the last two have been assigned to the Chorus by Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Hall and Geldart, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Graves;
and to the Servant by Richter, Blaydes, Herwerden, Merry, Mazon, and Zacher.
My reasons for leaving the entire line to Trygaeus will be found in the Com­ mentary.990.
τρία καὶ δέκ’ ἔτη R. V. vulgo.
This is quite accurate :
see the Com­ mentary and the Introduction to this Play.
Many critics however unaccount­ ably assumed that the period of 13 years here mentioned is intended to commence with the commencement of the Archi­ damian War.
Paulmier, Brunck, and others, therefore, thought it clear that the Comedy was not exhibited nntil the year 418 B. c.
This notion, sufficiently refuted (one would think) by the Comedy itself, was finally disposed of by the discovery of the didascalia, first printed in Bekker's edition, which showed that it was exhibited in 421.
Since then, on the same erroneous assumption, attempts have been made to alter the text.
Blaydes proposed δέκτον τοδ’ ἔτος, Herwerden σου δίχα καὶ δέκ’ ἔτη τρυχόμεθ’ ἤδη ;
and I have somewhere seen, though I cannot recall where, the suggestion τρικακῶς δέκ’ ἔτη.
But these are merely academic conjectures ;
nobody has really altered the text.1000.
ἐμπλησθῆναι μєγάλων R. V. vulgo.
I observed in my former edition that in all probability Aristophanes is in this first group of articles (999-1002) refer­ ring exclusively to the products of Megara and the Peloponnese.
Hamaker proposed to change μєγάλων into 'K Mєγάρων, and this is done by Meineke, Blaydes, Herwerden, Mazon, Van Leeuwen, Zacher, and Graves ;
while Mr. Sharpley, leaving the present line as it stands, substitutes ἐκ μὲν Mєγάρων in the pre­ ceding line for ἡμȋν ἀγαθῶν.
These changes give far too much importance to the resources of Megara.
To repre­ sent the Athenians as exulting in the idea that their market would be full of good things imported from Megara is contrary to all the facts of history.
The exclusion of Megara from the Athenian markets was the voluntary act of the Athenians themselves, and while it ruined Megara did not affect the Athenians at all.
That unfortunate country, now a mere desert owing to the incursions of the Athenian armies, was in its most flourishing days of little importance to the Athenian market.
The soil was poor (παράλυπρος, Strabo ix. 1, § 8, p. 393), and there was never any­ thing to import except such trifles as garlic, cucumbers, and the like.
In the Acbarnians, the Boeotian brings a load of good things such as those enumerated below 1003-5.
The Megarian has nothing whatever to bring.
It seems to me therefore preposterous to confine this first group of articles to Megara.
The apples and pomegranates would come from other districts of the Peloponnese.1012.
єἶτα μονῳδεȋν.
Here the lacuna which commenced in 948 terminates.1013.
ἀπαχηρωθεὶς V. Florent Chre­ tion,Bentley,Bothe, Bekker,recentiores.
ἀποχειρωθεὶς R. and the other MSS., and all editions before Bothe and Bekker.
The word which follows is accented as the accusative plural, τὰς, in the MSS.
and in all editions before Bekker, and by Bothe afterwards.
Florent Chretien changed it to τὰς and so Bekker, and, save as aforesaid, all subsequent editors.
The change seems a necessary conse­ quence of the reading ἀποχηρωθείς.1023.
μένοντ’ ἐνθαδὶ μεθ’ ἡμῶν.
See the Commentary.
μένοντα τοίνυν MSS.
vulgo.
μένοντα νῦν Brunck, Invernizzi, Bothe.
But the corresponding line in the strophe (939) is iambo-trochaic, and the efforts of all later editors have been directed to making this an iambo- trochaic line also.
Dindorf in his text marked a lacuna before μένοντα, and this is followed by Holden, Bergk, Meineke, Green, Hall and Geldart, and Merry.
That lacuna was filled by Richter with μένειν Kat, by Enger and Van Leeuwen with ἐνθαδὶ after θύρασιν, while Blaydes suggested ὦ γέρον in the same place with πῦρ καὶ for τοίνυν But Dindorf in his notes said that he now thought it more probable that the lacuna came after ἐνοντα (or μένοντ') and that τοίνυν should be struck out;
and so Weise, Blaydes, Herwerden.
Blaydes suggested in his notes (besides the ὦ γέρον mentioned above) two modes of filling up this lacuna, μένοντ' ἐνθάδ’ ὦ Τρυγαῖε, or μένοντ’ ὦ Τρυγαῖε καὶ πῦρ.
I had written the line as in my text before I observed that he had, in his Addenda, offered a fourth suggestion, very similar to mine, ἐνθάδε ξὺν ἡμῖν, though of course ξὺν ἡμῖν and μεθ’ ἡμῶν had very different meanings,1028-9.
ἐστιν τόν γε σοφῇ.
There have been so many small variations in these lines that it is not worth while to record them.
All the MSS.
except P1. have ἐστι τὸν σοφῇ, and so Bekker, Bergk, Meineke, and Graves.
P1. and all editions before Brunck have ἐστὶ χρεὼν TOP γε σοφῇ.
Dindorf omits ἐστι and marks a lacuna between σοφῇ and δόκιμον, and many have done the same.
But Hermann changed ἐστι into ἐστιν, and this with PIs τόν ye gives the re­ quired metre.
And the line as written in my text is read by Hall and Geldart, Mazon, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.1032.
ἐνημμένη MSS. (ἐννη- R.) vulgo.
Dr. Verrall proposes and Mr. Sharpley reads νενημένη, piled up.1037.
οὐ μὴ παύσει MSS. (except P1.), Fracini, Gelenius, Portus, recentiores, except as hereafter mentioned, οὐ πε­ παύσει P1. and the other editions before Portus.
Dawes on Clouds 366 laid down the rule “Exigit sermonis ratio ut voculae οὐ μὴ vel cum future indicative vel cum aoristo altero formae subjunc­ tivae construantur."
Relying on this rule Brunck and Meineke changed οὐ μὴ παύσησθε in Lys.
704 into οὐ μὴ παύ­ σεσθε, though indeed the same change had been suggested by Bentley before Dawes had enunciated his rule.
On the other hand Elmsley, in an excellent note on Oed. Col. 177, lays down " οὐ μὴ cum future vetantis est, cum subjunctive vero negantis," and would alter here παύσει into παύσῃ, and infra 1226 ποιήσει into ποιήσῃ.
And this alteration is made in both passages by Blaydes, Sharpley, and Van Leeuwen, and in this passage by Hall and Geldart, and Graves.
I cannot follow them in this, or in striking out the οὐ in the οὐ μή σ’ ἐγὼ περιόψομαι of Frogs 508.
I do not believe that the rule was so strict as Dawes on the one hand, or Elmsley on the other, contends:
or that οὐ μὴ might not be used as an em­ phatic negative either with the future in­ dicative or with eitheraorist subjunctive.
I leave παύσησθε in Lys. 704 because all the MSS.
read it, and for the same reason I leave παύσει here.—ποτ’ ὢν R. Gelenius, recentiores. ποτ’ ἂν the other MSS.

V. seems to have had οὗτός, altered into αὐτός.1074.

But in 1107 infra, where Trygaeus is retorting this line upon the soothsayer, all the MSS.
read τόδε πρότερ
ον, and Dobree on that line ob­ served that we should either read roSe πρότερ
ον here or repeat the reading of this line there.
This seems to me cer­ tain, for all the retorts of Trygaeus preserve in substance the very words of Hieracles.
Accordingly τόδε πρότερ
ον is read here by Dindorf, Bergk, and save as aforesaid all subsequent editors.
Sharpley reads TO ye in both passages.
Bekker and Graves have τό γε here and τόδε in 1107.—τοῖς ἀλσί I. F. Pl. P2. vulgo. τοῖσδ’ ἁλσί R. V. Meineke, Richter, Holden, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Mazon, and Van Leeuwen.1076.
καὶ πῶς ὦ κατάρατε K. τ. X.
This line was first introduced by Invernizzi from R.
It is also found in V. and is preserved by all subsequent editors.
It is not found in the other MSS.
or in any previous edition.1078.

Bentley, Bekker, Dindorf, Holden.

R. has λοιπ’ ἐν, which is merely a different way of writing the same words, and they are so written by Invernizzi.
ἔτι τοῦ λοιποῦ γ’ ἐν editions before Portus.

rpaxvv ἐχῖνον I. F. P1. P2. τρηχὺν ἐχῖνον R. V. But in 1114 infra, where Trygaeus is repeating this line, R. V. as well as the other MSS.
have τραχὺν ἐχῖνον.
There is therefore a great preponderance of authority in favour of the Attic rather than the Epic form ;
and in both lines that is the general reading.
But Bekker and Blaydes have τρηχὺν here and τραχὺν there, which can hardly be right;
while Bergk introduced τρηχὺν into both places, and has been followed by most of the subsequent editors.
1109.
ἀπένεγκον R. Bekker, Dindorf, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, Green, Paley, Merry, Mazon, and Graves, ἀπένεγκε the other MSS.
and vulgo.
Recent editors have fallen away to ἀπένεγκε because it is alleged by Richter and Blaydes that Aristophanes invariably uses ἔνεγκε the second aorist form, and never ἔνεγκον the first aorist form, of the imperative.
Yet we have ἐνεγκάτω infra 1149 and in Ach.
805, Wasps 529, Frogs 1304, and elsewhere ;
ἐξενέγκατε in Ach. 887, 1222, and Frogs 847, and ἐξενεγκάτω in Wasps 860.
And besides, this is the only place in which the second person singular is found at the end of the line, and that too an heroic hexameter which seldom closes with a short vowel.
In all the fifty­ four hexameters of the present scene there are but five which do so.
1111.
προσδώσει V. and in the next line προσδιδόαι V. as corrected, Bekker, recentiores, except Weise.
V. and all-the other MSS.
follow the verb by μοι τῶν, all these editors omitting the τῶν except Hall and Geldart, Sharpley, aud Van Leeuwen, who omit the μοι.
I think, on the whole, we can more easily spare the τῶν.
As to προσδιδόναι cf. supra 955, Knights 1222.
προδώσει and προσδιδόναι R. 1. F. P2 and (originally) V. To re­ store the metre Pl. read δώσει and πρὶν διδόναι, and so all editions before Inver­ nizzi ;
and Weise afterwards.
Invernizzi read δώσει and προσδιδόναι, and Bothe in his first edition δώσει and προσδιδόναι.1116.
τί δὴ ᾽γώ ;
(or ἐγώ ;
) R. V. Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Mazon, and Van Leeuwen.
τί δ᾽ ἐγώ;

Pl. vulgo. τί ἐγὼ δέ ;
Dindorf, Bothe, Bergk, Green, Paley. τί 8' ἐγώ;
TP. σὺ Meineke, Holden, Merry, Graves. τί δ᾽ ἐγὼ δή ;
.Richter, who also suggested τί δὲ δὴ ᾽γώ;
which is adopted by Blaydes and Sharpley.
Blaydes again, amidst many other conjectures, suggested τί δαὶ ᾽γώ;
which Zacher adopts.
The MS.
readings τί δὴ ᾽γώ;
and τί δ᾽ ἔγωγε;
seem better than any of these conjectures.1119.
ὦ παῖε παῖε R. V. Invernizzi, re­ centiores, except Weise and Bothe.
The other MSS.
and all editions before Brunck omit ὦ, so making the line a syllable short.
Bentley therefore suggested beginning the line with either ὦ (which is found to be the true reading) or παῖ.
Dawes also suggested 'rat, and this is read by Brunck and Weise, and by Bothe in his second edition, though in his first he had read ὦ.
Dawes in­ tended παῖ for the vocative of παῖς, but Brunck must have taken it as an ab­ breviated form of παῖε, since in his translation he altered Bergler's double percite, percute into a triple percute, percute, percute.
And this is approved by Elmsley (in a note at the end of his Review of Hermann's "Hercules Fu­ rens," Classical Journal viii. 218) who compares παῦ παῦε in Knights 821.1127-90.
The whole of this supple­ mental Parabasis is omitted in F.1127.
ἥδομαι γ᾽.
The γ᾽ was added, from R., by Invernizzi, who is followed by all subsequent editors.
Apparently it is found in all the MSS.
except P1., but it is absent from every edition before Invernizzi.1132.
έταίρων MSS.
Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
ἐτέρων editions before Brunck.1133.
ἐκκέας R. V. Invernizzi, re­ centiores, except Weise.
And this was Bergler's happy conjecture, but Bur­ mann, with his usual want of judgement, kept it out of Bergler's text.
Brunck read συγκέας, but before any other edition was published Bergler's conjecture was confirmed by R. and V. Brunck is how­ ever followed by Weise.
οὐκ ἐάς I. P2. all editions before Brunck " sine ullo sensu " as Brunck observes.
οὐκ ἐάσω P1. Florent Chretien for οὐκ ἐᾷς τῶν inge­ niously suggested εὐκεαστῶν, coming so near the mark that it is wonderful he did not hit it.
1135.
έκπεπρεμνισμένων.
This is Bothe's conjecture, which in my former edition I thought the most probable of all the conjectures, and as it has since been approved by Blaydes, and adopted by Herwerden (who however, I suppose by a clerical error, spells it έκπεπρημνισ­ μένων), Merry and Graves, I have now brought it into the text.
έκπεπρισμένα R. V. Bekker, Dindorf, Meineke, Holden, Green, Hall and Geldart, but of course this is contra metrum.
Pl. has έκπεπιεσμένα, and so all editions before Bekker;
and Weise and Bothe after­ wards.
The line is omitted in I. P2.
έκπεπρεμνισμένα Bergk, Paley, Blaydes, Mazon, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher, and this is no doubt nearer the MS.
reading, but I think that the genitive is necessary, not indeed for the metre but for the sense.
The order is ἐκκέας aTT' ἂν ὖδανότατα τω̑ν ξύλων ἐκπεπρεμνισμένων.
Richter reads ὲκπερι­ πεπρισμένα, but besides other objections the system admits no paeon except in the preceding line.
There have been many other conjectures which it is unnecessary to record.1142.
τί τηνικαυ̑τα (what next) Bentley, Brunck, recentiores, except Van Leeu­ wen.
Tt τηνικάδε R. V. I. P2. editions before Brunck.
Pl. to correct the metre reads τί 6' ἄν τηνικάδε.
Blaydes offers three conjectures, one of which, τί τήμερον δὴ, is rather attractive and is indeed brought into the text by Van Leeuwen.
1143.
δρω̑ντος καλω̑ς MSS.
vulgo.
No words could more happily express the speaker's feelings about the benefi­ cent rain now falling, and I cannot imagine what could have induced Nauck to propose δόντ
ος καλω̑ς, substituting a transitive for an intransitive verb, and an aorist for an action emphatically present.
And this frivolous conjecture is foisted into the text by Herwerden without the slightest objection having been taken to the genuine, and far superior, reading.
Cf. εὖποιου̑ντος infra 1157.1146. 'K του̑ χωρίον.
The 'K was sug­ gested by Bentley, and being found in both R. and V. is read by Invernizzi and all subsequent editors except Weise.
It is omitted in the other MSS.
and editions.
1154.
Αἀσχινάδου MSS. vulgo.
This is the third instance of a name being introduced into these Comedies which does not seem to be in accordance with the metre, the others being Lacratides (Ach. 220) and Hippodamus (Knights 327), where see the notes.
They are all proper names, and it may be that to appellations so constantly in use custom gave an accent which did not properly belong to them, and consequently that though the second syllable of Αίσχίνης is short, that of Αἱσχινάδου may be long.
Here several attempts have been made to amend the metre.
Elmsley (at Ach. 220) proposed to insert οὖνafter αἳτησον. Meinekc in the Fragm.
Corn. Graec. iv. 542 (on the Philargyrus of Dioxippus) suggested Αίσχυνάδου which is read by Green and Blaydes, but in his own edition he gave 'Αρχινάδου. Herwerden proposed Αἱσχρωνίδου.
But the most ingenious of all these conjectures is that of Van Leeuwen who reads ἒξ πορ' Αἱσ χίνου, six myrtles from Aeschines.
With this lengthening of a short vowel in a proper name scholars compare Aesch.
Septem 483, 542 'Ιππομέδοντος and Παρθενοπαϊος, where the second syllable in each name is treated as if it were long.1159.

1176.
Κυζικηνικόν V.P1. vulgo.
κυζικηνόν R. I. P2- Markland (at Eur. Suppl. 1181) conjectured Χεζικηνικὸν, which is adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Bekker.
Brunck also changed αὐτὸς to αὑσὴ, viz.
ὴ φοινικὶς, which perhaps was necessary with Χεζικηνικὸν, but which really de­ stroys the contrast intended between the man's face and his cloke, as in Lys. 1140, where Pericleidas is described as ὠχρὰς ὲν φαινικίδι.
Lines 1175,1176 are omitted in the text of V., but are added in the margin.1178.
λινοπτώμενος MSS. vulgo.
This is the reading of every MS.
and every edition, but it has been assailed of late years on the ground that the first syllable of λίνον is short.
That is of course true, and is probably the very reason why the word is employed here.
I said in ray former edition that the sentence appeared to be a parody of some passage unknown ;
and the parody may be due to the fact that the parodied poet had made the first syllable long.
The substitutions proposed have been singularly infelicitous, such as ληνοπτώ­ μενος,Meineke;
ye λινοπτώμενος, Blaydes;
δὴ πνέων μένας, Herwerden ;
λινοπτώμενος Bachmann;
έγὼ δὲ δὴ λινοπτάζω μένων, Van Leeuwen;
ἀναπτερωμένος, Naber.1179.

see on 1159 supra. ἠνίκα 8' ἂν I. F. P1. P2. editions before Bothe.1183.
πραστὰς MSS.
vulgo.
Lenting proposed to write πρασστὰς, and this is done by Richter, Holden, and several recent editors.
It is of course the par­ ticiple of προσίστημι, but the Attics do not seem to have doubled the σ in these compounds of πράς.
Neither προσστὰς nor πρόσσχετε is found in any Aristo­ phanic MS.1184.
θεȋ τῷ κακῷ R. V. Invernizzi, re­ centiores, except Weise, and except that Bothe in his second edition writes κἀπόρῳ 'θει.
The words τῷκακῷare to be joined with κάπορω̑ν, driven to his wits' end by the blow.
θεȋ τὸ κακὸν I. P2. ἄθει τὸ κακὰν editions before Brunck. ἒθει κακὸνV (agreeing with όπὸν) Brunck, Weise.1187. έτ' εὐθύνας MSS. (except R.) vulgo.
έντευ̑θεν εὐθ'ύνας R., έντευ̑θεν being obviously a mistake for ἓτ' εὐθύν- which the transcriber forgot to alter.1190.
έν μάχη MSS. vulgo.
Zacher strangely represents Dobree as propos­ ing to change this into έν 'Εφέσῳ.
But Dobree is correcting not Aristophanes, but the Scholiast.
The Scholium runs Παροιμία παρὰ τοὺς έν τη̑̑ 'Ασίᾳ Λάκωνας ὰτυχήσαντας, " οἲκοι λέοντες, ἐν 'Εφέσῳ δὲ Λάκωνες."
And when Dobree says " Schol.
Lege ὲν 'Εφέσῳ δ' άλώπεκες, ut Kuhn. ad Aelian.
V. H. xiii.
9" he means, as Kuhn had said before him, that the proverb should run οἲκοι λέοντες, ἐν 'Εφέ­ σῳ δ' άλώπεκες, an iambic senarius.
He is proposing to change Λάκωνες to άλώπεκες in the Scholium not ἐν μάχη to ἐν 'Εφέσῳ in the Comedy.1195.

But all the MSS.

πεντήκαντά δρᾱχμω̑ν MSS.
vulgo.
The first syllable of δραχμὴ is long here, as in Wasps 691, Plutus 1020, several fragments of other Comic Poets, and probably in other lines of Aristophanes, such as Ach.
161 and the line following the present, in each of which an ana­ paest is more rhythmical than a tribrach.
It is however more commonly short;
and Dawes (at Plutus 166) proposes to insert γἐὠ after δρᾰχμω̑ν in the present line.
But Dawes was arguing that a short vowel could not be made long before χμ ;
he was not considering the case of a vowel which in its own nature might be either long or short, quite apart from the consonants which might happen to follow it.
Plautus (Trinum­ mus ii.. 4. 23) divides the consonants χ and μ, writing drachumarum, but still makes the first syllable long.
Brunck inserted αὓτ' " id est τἀ δρέπανα " after δραχμω̑ν, and is followed by Invernizzi.
Elmsley, at Ach. 178, found a further fault with the line, viz.
"plane absurdum esse falces quinquagenis drachmis ae­ stimari, cum proximo versu cadi trims veneant."
And this objection is echoed by several subsequent editors.
Very likely they are right.
But I am not myself aware of the relative values of a δρέπανον and a κάδας;
and am certainly not prepared to say that a δρέπαναν, which was a much more elaborate im­ plement than our sickle, might not have been worth as much as 16 or 17 little casks for country use or nearly as much as a trumpet, infra 1241.
However, Elmsley proposed to read νυνὶ8' ὲγὼ μὲν πεντέδραχμα ταυ̑τ'έμπαλω̄, and this is followed by Herwerden and Graves, and (save that he changes ταυ̑τ' into πάντ', surely a change for the worse) by Van Leeuwen.

Florent Chretien's proposal, to read κάδων θ' for καὶ τω̑νδ', though inadmis­ sible, is worth recording for its real ingenuity.
1210.
ΛΟΦΟΠΟΙΟΣ.
I have named the speakers in the ensuing dialogue, as they are named substantially in the MSS.
and in all the editions down to and including Bergk's.
Bergk however thought that the dialogue with Trygaeus from 1210 to 1264 was carried on by one speaker, an 'Οπλοποιὸς or an 'Οπλοπώλης, for which others have substituted from line 1209 "Οπλων κάπηλος.
He did not indeed introduce this arrangement into his own edition ;
but it was carried out by Meineke and most subsequent editors, the only exceptions, I think, being Paley, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Merry.
Yet the MSS.
are quite unani­ mous, and are confirmed by the Scholiast, who on 1210 says ό λοφοποιὰς ἓρχεται, καταβοω̑ν Τρυγαίου κ.τ.λ,;
and on 1225 ἂλλας δέ έστιν αὖτοςὀλοφυρόμενος;
and on 1250 οὖτοςκράν κομίζει δύα ;
and indeed line 1250 ὦ, δυσκάθαρτε δαȋμον ὢς μ' ἀπώλεσας seems to postulate the inter­ vention of a new speaker.
And that a continuous succession of speakers was quite in the manner of Aristophanes at this period of his career we see from the examples in the next extant Comedy, the Birds.
And, supra 545-9, the λοφοπαιὰς, ξιφαυργὀς, and δαρυξὰς are distinguished from each other, and not compressed into a single 'Οπλοπαιάς.
Moreover this huddling them all up under a single name destroys the distinction so clearly drawn between the manufacturer, the retail dealer, and the non-trader.
The λοφοποιὀς himself manufactured the λόφοι, and therefore nothing is said about what they had cost him;
Trygaeus alludes merely to the elaborate work­ manship.
The θωρακοπώλης and the κρανοπώλης are not manufacturers, they are merely retail dealers;
and their complaint therefore is of the expense they incurred in purchasing the articles which the action of Trygaeus has rendered unsaleable.
The σαλπιγκτὴς appears to be not a trader at all, but merely a bandsman who has bought a military trumpet, now useless.
(I do not know how we should class the δορυξός.)
So far therefore from thinking that Bergk's view has such superior merit as to justify our deserting the unanimous authority of the MSS., I think that the MS.
arrangement, taken on its own merits, is in every respect far superior.1216.
ἓχει πόνον πολὺν MSS. vulgo.
Cf. Frogs 829 πλευόνων πολὺν πόνον.
πολὺν ἓχει πόνον Brunck, who asks "
Quis dubitet numerosam illam compositionem e poeta esse ? "
Apparently every one doubts it except Weise, for Weise alone has adopted it.
But Blaydes, not to be outdone, conjectured, though he did not read, πόνον ἓχει πολὺν, and as Brunck found his one follower in Weise, so Blaydes has found his in Herwerden.1217.

Aristophanes would not have put into this shopkeeper's mouth such a periphrasis as θώρακ
ος κύτος unless he were quoting some well-known passage;
and I suspect that the words ένημμένῳ κάλλιστα
θώρηκος κύτει are a quotation from, or a parody of, the iambics of some Ionian poet.

μάθῃς ... αὒτ’ ἀποδώσεται R. V. μύθῃ•■• ἀποδώσεταιthe other MSS.
and editions.
But this is incom­ patible with the speech of the Helmet- seller, which Trygaens is answering.
Many suggestions have been made to reconcile the two speeches, the one which has found most support being the transfer of the Helmet-seller's speech to some other person.
The best MSS.
as we have seen read μάθῃςand ἀποδώσεται.
One of these must be wrong;
but the change of μάθῃς into μάθῃ necessitates further alterations ;
whilst the change of ἀποδώσε[τα]ι into ἀποδώσειmakes the whole passage clear and consistent.
And even in the next two lines we have two examples of the omission of y', since R. and V. are the only MSS.
which insert it after μηδαμῶς, and R. the only one which omits it after τούτῳ.1262.
διαπρισθεῖεν MSS. vulgo.
Some recent editors have taken objec­ tion to the use of the plural verb in conjunction with δόρατα, and διαπpισ­ θείη was suggested by Meineke in his V. A. and is read by Holden, Blaydes, Herwerden, and Van Leeuwen.
This alteration is sometimes attributed to Dindorf, but I do not know on what grounds.
In his edition Meineke read διαπ
ρίσειεν.1266. οὺρησόμενα MSS.
Here again an objection has of late been taken that two quite different reasons are given for the appearance of the boys, and Bergk suggested μανυριζόμενα (which Green adopts probably for decency's sake) or ὀρθριζόμενα, Meineke ὀρχησόμενα which Holden, and Blaydes μινυρόμενα which Graves, adopts, probably for the same reason.
1267.

He also suggested προαναβάλητ ἐμοὶ, which is read by Blaydes, Van Leeuwen, and Graves.1270.
όπλοτέρων and in the next line óπλοτέρους MSS.
vulgo.
Dawes, with more than his nsual confidence, and without his habitual sanity of judge­ ment, proposed to substitute óπλοφόρων and ὀπλοφόρους.
He could not have observed that the words are a quotation.
He says " Locum interpretatur Florens Christianus Rursus ab armigeris nunc incipiamus.

ἆδαν MSS.
Junta, Dobree, Bothe, Dindorf, Weise, Paley, Blaydes, Herwerden, Hall and Geldart, Mazon, and Zacher.
But in both R. and V. there is an erasure between the a and the v, and there is little doubt that each of these MSS.
originally read ἄδων which has been corrected into ἄδαν.
And ἄδων is read by Florent Chretien, Zanetti, Farreus, Bentley, Kuster, and, save as aforesaid, all subsequent editors.
εἶδον the other editions before Kuster, with the exception of Rapheleng, who reads εἲδων.
I should have much preferred to read ἄδων, but am con­ strained in this line to retain ἆδον, not only by the authority of the MSS., but by the ἀμαθὲς and κατάραταν of the following line, which show that in this little speech Trygaeus is keeping in mind the neuter παιδίον of his previous speech.
It is otherwise in lines 1275 and 1278.
The use of the neuter di­ minutive παιδίον or παιδάριαν for the masculine παῖς constantly involves a confusion of the two genders, the speaker sometimes having in mind the boy before him, sometimes the neuter appellation by which he has previously addressed him.

πεπαυμέναι MSS. vulgo.
"Fuit cum putarem legendum πεπασμέναι, ut esset idem ac κεκσρημέναι, et quasi echo daret illi responsum ἄσμενοι. Tamen nihil muto, et calidum fortasse nimis hoc inventum," Florent Chretien.
“ Cali­ dum fortasse nimis hoc inventum?
Immo ingeniosum adeo, ut nihil a te alias vel simile vel secundum excogita­ tum sit;
at timide adeo gelideque ministratum, ut vix persensisse videaris, quantum vulgatae lectioni praestet," Dawes.
"Florentis conjecturam maximo probavit Dawesius opere, quam ego, licet ingeniosam, nec recepi, nee vellem re­ cepisse," Brunch.
However, everything comes to those who wait;
and Florent Chretien's pleasant conjecture, after waiting for upwards of three centuries, has at last found in Herwerden an editor bold enough to admit it into the text of Aristophanes.—οἶμαι MSS. Scaliger (in notes), Brunck, recentiores.
In the Aldine edition the word was unac­ countably omitted, and thenceforward in every edition before Brunck the line ended abruptly with ἄσμενοι. Florent Chretien proposed to supply the blank with οὓτως ;
Dawes proposed εἶεν(with πεπασμένοι) or ὦ το̑ν (with πεπαυμένοι) “ ac si dixisset;
Immo πεπασμένοι caue, nonπεπαυμένοι.”Scaliger alone hit upon the true reading.1292.

" Rescribendum est ᾆσει. Futurum utique aetivum a verbo ᾆδω formatum Attici non agnoscunt, sed medio duntaxat ᾆσομαι utuntur, supra 1267, Ach. 14, 261, Eccl. 887," Dawes.
And on this authority Brunck and all subsequent editors, save the two men­ tioned above, have changed ᾆσειςιnto ᾆσει.
I wish that I had a better array of editors to countenance me in retain­ ing the MS.
reading, for there seems to me to be no sufficient foundation for Dawes's view.
The use of the future middle does not in any way negative the coexistence of the future active.
ὄ̩δω is merely a contracted form of ἀείδω, both the future middle and the future active of which are in common use.
There is therefore no a priori presump­ tion against a future active of ᾆδω, and two such thoroughly well attested ex­ amples of it as the ᾆσεις here, and the ᾆσουσιοf Plato's Laws ii.
10 (p. 666 D) are quite sufficient to authenticate its use.1301.

This is Holden's conjecture, which I adopted in my former edition and which is also adopted by Mr. Graves.
ἐμβάλλετον MSS.
Suidas (s. v. ἀνδρικῶς and S. v. σμώχετε), vulgo.
But the dual is quite incomprehensible here, and various efforts have been made to supersede it.
ἐμβάλλετε Portus, Scaliger, Faber, Kuster, Bergler, Weise, and Hall and Geldart.
This, however, does not account for the final -ov in the MSS.
Bergk proposed ἐμβάλλετ’ ὦ, which has obtained greater vogue than it deserved, being adopted by Meineke, Paley, Blaydes, Herwerden, Merry, Mazon, Sharpley, Van Leeuwen, and Zacher.
Dobree proposed ἐμβάλλετε Σμώχοντες.
Holden's suggestion is the most simple in itself as well as the most likely to have given rise to the MS.

These two lines are found only in R. and V. and are omitted in all editions before Invernizzi.
But all the previous editions had recognized the lacuna, some writing "ΛΕΙΠΕΙ,” others “ΛΕΙΠΕΙ τὸ δὲ λεῖπον ἄδηλον ”as supra 948-1011.
In the former edition, there being at that time no translation of the Peace into English verse, I collected in the Appendix half a dozen poetic versions by various authors of favourite and isolated scenes.
Of these I now retain only two, one by Professor Eugène Fallex and the other by Henry Hart Milman, Dean of St. Paul's ;
and these I retain because Fallex and Milman were the only two authors cited who were then living, and their kindness in allowing me to cite their versions is gratefully acknowledged in the Introduction.
The first passage is taken from the “Theâtre d'Aristophane ;
scenes traduites en vers français par Eugène Fallex, Professeur de seconde au Lycée Napoleon.
Deuxième edition.
Durand, Paris, 1863;
" and the other from "
The Agamemnon of Aeschylus, and the Bacchanals of Euripides, with passages from the other Poets of Greece :
translated by Henry Hart Milman D.D. Dean of St. Paul's.
Murray, London, 1865."Be honour given where honour's due, our poet stands contest
Of all our comic teachers the wisest and the best.
For he alone, with nobler aim, his rivals made to cease, On rags for ever jesting and waging war on fleas.
Still making poor starved Hercules like a glutton munch and eat;
And now a runaway and rogue, and ever soundly beat.
All these, dishonoured, from your stage he drove away and gave A truce to that eternal flogged and ever howling slave ;
While evermore his brother slave would o'er his stripes begin
His sorry jests, " Poor fellow !
what's the matter with your skin ?
Alas!
and has the bristly whip thus ventured to attack
Thy sides with his fierce legions, and thus laid waste thy back ? "
This wretched burthen off he threw, this low-born ribaldry :
Created you a noble art and set it up on high With lofty words and sentences, disdaining as unfit Women and petty private men for his unvulgar wit.
At once upon the highest with Herculean strength I sprung, Through stench of filthiest tanhides and pelting showers of dung;
And first that blatant beast I fought with sharpest teeth o'ergrown, Whose fiery eyes more fierce than those of shameless Cynna shone.
And all around his brows the heads of sycophants were hung
That rolled out o'er his noisome cheek the flattering slavering tongue.
And torrent-like his voice poured forth fierce ruin unreprest, With all the mingled filth and stench of every loathsome beast.
Against this dreadful monster I feared not alone t'arise
In your defence, my countrymen!
and the Islands our allies.
