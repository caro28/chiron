[1.] HAS a god, or some man, obtained from you, 0 guests, (the fame of being) the cause of the laying down of laws ?
Clin.
A god, 0 guest, a god, to say what is most just;
with us indeed, Zeus;
but amongst the Lacedæmonians, from whose country is this person here, I think, they mention Apollo.'
Is it not so ?.egil.
It is.
Athen.
Say you then, according to Homer,2 that Minos did constantly on the ninth year3 go to a conference with his father, and according to the oracular responses given by him, lay down the laws found in your states ?
Clin.
It is so said by us;
and, likewise, that his brother Rhadamanthus—for you have heard the name-was the most j ust [of men].
Now we Cretans would say that he obtained this praise from his distributing at that time things pertain­ ing to justice in an upright manner.
Athen.
And honourable is the renown, and very becoming to the son of Zeus.
But since both you and this person here have been brought up in legal institutions of this kind, I ex­ pect it will not be unpleasant for us at present to have a dis­ sertation, by speaking and hearing respecting a form of go­ vernment and laws, and at the same time to be taking a walk.
Now the way from Cnossus to the cavern and temple of Ju­ piter is, as we hear, altogether sufficient, 1 and the resting- places along the road are, as is proper, during the present sultry weather, shady amongst lofty trees ;
and it will be suited to our age to rest in them frequently, and by relieving each other during the conversation, to go in this way through the whole walk with ease.
CUn.
There are indeed, 0 guest, to a person as he goes on, in the groves cypress-trees of wondrous height and beauty, and meadows, in which while we rest, we may discourse.[2.]
Athen.
Speak you correctly ?
CUn.
Entirely so ;
and we shall say so more, on seeing them.
But let us go with a good fortune.
Athen.
Be it so.
But tell me, why has the law ordained for your joint-feasts gymnastic exercises and the handling of arms ?
Clin.
I conceive, 0 guest, that it is easy 2 even for every one2 to apprehend these customs of ours.
For you see that the nature of the whole country of Crete is not a plain, like that of Thessaly.
On this account, they make use of horses more;
but we of running.
3
Now as this irregular [ground]3 is more adapted to the exercise of foot-races, it is necessary for a person in such a case to have light arms, and not to run 4holding what has a weight.
4
Now the lightness of bows and arrows seems to be fitted (for this).
All these therefore have been adopted by us in war;
and all this has the legislator, as it appears to me, looking to this point, ordained;
especially since he nearly seems to have instituted the joint feasts, through perceiving how all persons, when engaged in war, are then compelled by the thing itself, for the sake of their own defence, to feast 1 at that time together.
1
In truth, he appears to me to have condemned the multitude of stupidity, for their not learning that there is constantly through life a war to all with all states.
Now if during the time of war it was neces­ sary to feast in common for the sake of defence, and for certain persons, both rulers and ruled, to be drawn up as their defenders, this should be done in the time of peace likewise.
For that, which most men call peace, is only a name;
but in reality there is a war, not proclaimed by a herald, accord­ ing to nature, to all2 against all states.
For by thus con­ sidering, you will almost discover, that the Cretan legislator has, looking to war, ordained for us all institutions both public and private, and ordered us to guard the laws in such a man­ ner, as if nothing else were useful, either of possessions or pursuits, unless one became victorious in war, and all the goods of the vanquished became the property of the victors.[3.]
Athen.
You appear to me, 0 guest, to have been well practised in seeing through the laws of Crete.
But tell me still more clearly this.
For 3 by the definition you have laid down 3 of a well-regulated state, you seem to me to say that one ought to administer it, so arranged in order, as to be victorious over the rest of states in war.
Is it not so ?
Clin.
Just so;
and I think it will seem so to this person here.
Megil.
For how can any Lacedæmonian whatever, 0 thou divine man, answer otherwise ?
Athen.
Whether, then, is this right in the case of states towards states, but otherwise in the case of one village towards another ?
Clin.
By no means otherwise.
Atnen.
But it is the same ?
Athen.
What then, is it the same in the case of one family towards another family, and in the case of one man towards another ?
Clin.
The same.
Athen.
But in the case of a person towards himself, shall we consider him in that of an enemy towards an enemy?
Or, how shall we say ?
Clin. 0 Athenian guest,-for I am not willing to call you Attic, because you appear to me rather to deserve to be called after the name of the goddess Minerva,1—you have, by cor­ rectly carrying back the reasoning to its principle, made it clearer;
so that you will more easily discover that it has just now been rightly said, that all persons are enemies to all, both publicly and privately, and2 each individual to himself.
Athen.
How bast thou, 0 wonderful man, said this ?
Clin. 3
And these, too,3 0 guest;
it is the first and best of all victories for a man to conquer himself;
but to be van­ quished by himself is of all things the most shameful and vile.
For these words4 signify that there is a war in each of us against ourselves.
Athen.
Let us then turn back our discourse, For, since each of us is 5 one better and another5 worse than himself, shall we say that a family, and a village, and a state, have this same thing in them, or not ?
Clin.
Do you mean that ( one) 6 is better than itself in some things, and the other worse ?
Athen.
Yes.
Clin.
Concerning this too you have rightly inquired.
7
For a thing of this kind occurs very and much, not the least in states.
7
For, in the case of those, in which the better conquer the multitude and the worse, such a city would be correctly said to be better than itself, and be most justly praised for such a victory.
But the contrary where the contrary (occurs).
Athen.
Now the question, whether the worse is at any time more excellent than the better, let us lay aside ;
for it would be a long discussion ;
but for the present I understand what is asserted by you;
that sometimes citizens of the same family and of the same city, being unjust and numerous, will, by coming together, forcibly attack the just, fewer in number, and enslave them;
and that, when they conquer, the city may be justly said to be inferior to itself, and at the same time de­ praved ;
but, when they are conquered, better than itself, and good.
Clin.
What is now said, guest, is very strange ;
but yet it is most necessary to confess it.[4.]
A then.
Hold then, and let us again consider this.
Many brothers may surely be born from one man and from one (woman).
1 Nor is it at all wonderful that the greater 2 part of them should be unjust, and the lesser just.
Clin.
It is not.
Athen.
Nor will it be proper for me and you to investigate this, that, when the base vanquish, both the family and every kind of relationship may be called inferior to themselves, but better than themselves, when the base are vanquished.
For we do not investigate these things at present for the sake of some elegance or inelegance in words, according to the dis­ course of many, but for the sake of discovering what is a natural rectitude and error in the case of laws.
Clin.
You speak most truly, 0 guest.
Megil.
To me too so much appears to be well said.
Athen.
Let us look into this likewise.
Can any one become a judge of the brothers just spoken of?
Clin. Doubtless.
Athen.
Which then will be the better judge?
He, who cuts off such of them as are bad, and orders the good to govern themselves?
or he, who causes the good to govern, but suffers the bad to live, being willing to be governed ?
But let us mention a third judge, if such there be, with re­ spect to virtue;
who, receiving a single clan at difference with itself, will not destroy any person ;
but, after having reconciled the parties, will lay down for them laws relating to each other, and be able so to guard them, that they may be on friendly terms.
Clin.
Such a judge and legislator would be the better by far.
Athen.
And he would frame laws for them, looking to a purpose contrary to war.
CUn.
This indeed is true.
Athen.
But what is he, who brings a state together?
Would he, by looking to external war, better put in order its life than (by looking) to the wars produced constantly within itself, which is called sedition ?
which every one would par­ ticularly wish not to occur in his own state;
and when it has occurred, to be released from it as quickly as possible ?CUn.
(By looking), it is evident, to this (the latter).
Athen.
Whether would any one choose that peace should result from sedition, through one party being destroyed, and the other1 victorious, or that, by peace and friendship result­ ing from a reconciliation, they should necessarily2 direct their attention to external wars ?
Clin.
Every one would rather wish it to happen to his own state in this way than in that.
Athen.
Would not a legislator too in a similar manner?
Athen.
Would not every one lay down all laws for the sake of that which is best ?
Athen.
But neither war nor sedition is the best of things, 3—for to be in want of these is a thing to be prayed for—3 but peace with, and kindly feelings towards, each other.
More­ over, for a state to vanquish itself, is not, it seems, one of the best, but of necessary things ;
just as if1 any one should think a body in sickness would, when meeting with medicinal cleansing, be then doing the best, but should pay no attention to the body, which needed (the cleansing) not at all.
Should any one in like manner have his thoughts directed to the happiness of a state or an individual, he will never become correctly2 a statesman, while looking only and primarily to external war;
nor will he be an accurate legislator, unless he lays down laws respecting war for the sake of peace, rather than laws respecting peace, for the sake of war.[5.]
Clin.
This reasoning, 0 guest, appears somehow to have been stated correctly.
But still, I wonder whether the institu­ tions existing with us, and still more those relating to Lacedæ­ mon, have not given rise to all care for the sake of those things.
Athen.
This may perhaps be the case.
We ought not, however, to contest the matter at present in a harsh manner;
but quietly to ask questions, as both we and they have espe­ cially an interest in things of this kind.
Do ye then keep pace with my discourse.
In the first place, we will place before you Tyrtæus3—who was by birth an Athenian, but afterwards a fellow-citizen with these persons here;
and who has the most of all men been engaged on these points-where he says, " I would not bear in recollection the man, nor hold him in any account, not though he were the most wealthy of men, and possessed many good things,"—and he enumerates nearly all,—" who is not always the best in the affairs of war."
For you have surely heard of his poetry.
For this person here is, I think, saturated with them.
Megil.
Entirely so.Clin.
And they have reached us likewise, having been brought from Lacedæmon.
Athen.
Come then, let us interrogate in common this poet somehow in this fashion.
Thou, most divine poet, Tyrtæus,— for you appear to us to be wise and good, because you have celebrated excellently well those, who excel in war,—and as myself, and this person here, and Clinias the Cnossian, hap­ pen, as we seem, to agree very much with you in this par­ ticular,—we wish to know clearly, whether we are speaking about the same men or not,-do tell us, whether you too think, as we do, that there are two kinds of war ?
Or how (say you) ?
To this I think that a man, much inferior to Tyrtæus, would say the truth, that there are two kinds;
one, which we now call sedition, which is the most grievous of all wars, as we just now asserted;
but the other kind of war, which we employ in our differences with those out of the state, and of a different tribe, we will lay down, as being milder than the other.
Athen.
Come now, (inform us) what men, and for what kind of war, have you so transcendently praised (some) 1 and blamed others.
For you appear to have praised 2 those (en­ gaged) in a foreign (war).
2
For you have said in your poems thus-that you by no means endure those, Who dare not upon gory slaughter look, Nor with the hand, close standing, clutch the foe.
Hence, as an inference, we should say that you, Tyrtæus, are praising, it seems, those, who have been eminently conspicuous in a foreign and external war.
Surely he would say this and confess it.
Athen.
But we, although these are good, assert that those are far better, who are conspicuously the best in the greatest war.
We have too the poet Theognis as a witness, a citizen of Megara in Sicily, who says, The man, who, when the strife of party's high, Is faithful, is in gold and silver worth His weight.
Now, such a one we say is in a more difficult war altogether superior to the other, by nearly as much as justice, temper­ ance, and prudence, when coming to the same point, are supe­ rior 1 to fortitude (by itself alone ).1
For no one can be found faithful and sound in seditions, without the whole of virtue.
But, as Tyrtæus says, there are a great number of mercenaries who fight 2 standing firmly with their legs apart,2 and die will­ ingly in battle-among whom are the most 3 bold, and unjust, and insulting,3 and nearly4 the most thoughtless of all (men) except some very few.
But to what does this story tend ?
And what did he wish to render clear, when he said this ?
It was evidently this above all;
that both he, who laid down laws here from Zeus, and every one else, from whom there is even a little advantage, will lay down his laws, while always looking for the most part to nothing else than the greatest virtue.
But it is, as Theognis says, a faithfulness in things of dread, which a person may denominate perfect justice;
but that, which Tyrtæus has praised so highly, is indeed beautiful, and opportunely celebrated by the poet, yet it may most rightly be called the fourth in number and in the power of being in honour.[6.]
Clin.
Shall we, 0 guest, throw:
our legislator away amongst the remote legislators ?
Athen.
Not (him)6 indeed, most excellent man, but our­ selves, should we imagine, that both Lycurgus and Minos laid down their laws in Lacedæmon and here, looking especially to war.
Clin.
What then, (and) how ought we to say ?
Athen.
xAs truth and justice, I think, require those to speak, who discourse about a divine (republic ).1
Not looking to some part of virtue, and that the most trifling, but to the whole of virtue, 2he laid down, and according to their species to seek the laws, not what those seek who place species before those now2—for that, of which each person is in want, does he laying aside3 seek ;
one, the laws about inheritances ;
4an­ other, those about sole heiresses ;
4 another, those about an as­ sault ;
and others, about ten thousand other matters of a similar kind.
But we assert that the inquiry about laws is the busi­ ness of those, who properly inquire, as we have just now begun (to do).
And I am in every way delighted with your attempt to give an explanation on the subject of laws.
For it is right to begin from virtue, by asserting that for its sake a person has laid down laws.
But when you said that the legislator had laid down all (laws) with reference to a part of virtue, and this too the least, you did not appear to me to speak cor­ rectly any longer;
and on this account did I speak all this subsequent speech.
Do you, then, wish me to say in what manner 1 I am still willing for you to speak in detail, and my­ self to hear.
1Clin. Entirely so, 0 guest.
Athen.
It is proper to assert that the laws of the Cretans are not vainly held in very great esteem by all the Greeks.
For they are in a correct state by their making those, who use them, happy;
for they impart every good.
Now there are two kinds of good;
one human, and the other divine;
and the former hangs upon the divine;
and if any state re­ ceives the greater, it possesses likewise the lesser;
but if not, it is deprived of both.
But the lesser are those, of which 2 health is the leader, beauty the second in order, and strength for running, and all other movements of the body, the third;
but the fourth is, Plutus, (wealth,)2 not blind indeed,3 but see­ in-, acutely, if it follows prudence.
Now that which is the first 4good (and)4 the leader of the divine, is prudence;
but the second, after intellect,5 is a temperate habit of the soul;
from these (two) mixed up with fortitude,6 the third in order will be justice;
and the fourth, fortitude.
Now all these are naturally arranged before those, and so must they be ar­ ranged by the lawgiver;
7and after these he must enjoin upon the citizens the other ordinances that look to these.
7
But of these the human look to the divine, and all the divine to their leader intellect.
1
And he ought to have a care respecting marriages contracted by each other, and after these in the procreation and education of children,1 such as are male and female, and likewise of those still young, and of those advancing in years to old age, and to hold cor­ rectly in honour and dishonour;
2 directing, in all the inter­ course of these persons, his attention to their pains, and pleasures, and desires, and eagerness in all matters of love;
and acting as a guard over them to blame and praise cor­ rectly through the laws themselves.
In the case of anger and fear, and what perturbations soever in the soul arise through misfortune, and whatever escapes from them exist in prosperity;
and whatever sufferings happen to men through disease, or wars, or poverty, or the contraries to these, in all such occa­ sions he must teach and define what is beautiful, or not, in the arrangement of each.
And after this, it is necessary for the legislator to watch over the property and expenditure of the citizens, in whatever way it may take place, and the unions with and separations from each other in all persons (acting) with their free will or without it;
and to have an eye to what is just or not, and in what things it exists or is wanting, and to distribute honours to those who obey the laws, but to inflict upon those, who do not obey, punishments ordained (by law);
until, having reached the end of all polity, he shall perceive in what manner it is meet for the burial of the dead to take place, and what honours to pay to them.
And after perceiv­ ing, he who has laid down the laws shall place over them all, as guardians, some persons on account of their prudence, and some who have gone through a truthful reputation;
so that intellect, binding all these together, may exhibit them as fol­ lowing temperance and justice, and not riches or ambition.
In this manner, 0 guests, I did wish, and still do wish now, that you would explain how all these particulars exist in the laws said to be from Zeus, and in those of the Pythian Apollo, which both Minos and Lycurgus laid down;
and how, after they have assumed a certain order, they become evident to a person skilled in the business of law, either through art or cer­ tain customs ;
while to us, the rest of mankind, they are by no means apparent.[7.]
Clin.
How then, 0 guest, ought we to speak of what comes after these ?
Athen.
It appears to me that we ought to go through again from the beginning, as we have begun (in part), in the first place, the pursuits of fortitude;
and afterwards we will go through another species of virtue, and again another, if you are willing ;
and that we may go through the first subject, we will endeavour, by laying down a pattern, and conversing about the others in this way, to make for ourselves a beguile­ ment of the road;
and afterwards we will show, if god is willing, that the things relating to the whole of virtue look thitherward.
Clin.
You speak well.
Endeavour then, in the first place, to sift for us this praiser of Zeus.
Athen.
I will endeavour likewise (to sift) both you and my­ self.
For the discourse is common.
Speak therefore.
Shall we say that the joint-feasts and gymnastic exercises were invented by the lawgiver for the purposes of war ?
Athen.
And that a third or fourth thing (was invented) ?
2For perhaps it is necessary for a person thus to make an enumeration respecting those of the rest of virtue, whether it is right to call them of parts, or any thing whatever, only showing clearly what he means.
2Megil.
The third thing, as I and any Lacedæmonian what­ ever likewise would say, he discovered was hunting.
1
And a fourth, and even a fifth,2 thing let us try, if we can, to mention.'
I then would endeavour to mention the fourth thing, namely, that which takes place to a great extent with us, in the en­ durance of pain, which occurs constantly in fighting with hands against each other, and 3 in certain snatchings in the midst of many blows.
3
There is, moreover, what is called a concealment,4 wonderfully laborious as regards endurance (of pain);
and the being in winter without shoes and without a bed, and waiting without servants upon themselves, while wandering night and day through the whole country.
Still further, in the exercises of naked persons,5 there is a severe endurance amongst us when contending with the violence of intense heat;
and there are very many other things 1(of this kind),l in detailing which a person would 2nearly never ceasedAthen.
You speak well, 0 Lacedæmonian guest.
But come, whether shall we put down fortitude as a contest merely with fears and pains ?
or with desires likewise and pleasures, and certain vehement fawnings of flattery, which soften 3 the minds of those, who deem themselves objects of worship, and mould them like wax?
4Megil.
5 I think thus,5 (that it is) a contest with all these.
Athen.
If then we call to mind the previous discourse, this person here said, that both a state is inferior in some things to itself, and 6 a man (to himself).
6
Was it not so, Cnossian guest ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Now then, whether shall we call him the inferior,7 who is subdued by pain, or him rather, who is subdued by pleasure ?
Clin.
Him, it appears to me, who is subdued by pleasure.
And surely we all much rather say that he, who is vanquished by pleasures, is disgracefully inferior to himself, than he, who (is vanquished) by pains.
Athen.
Surely the legislator through Zeus and he through Apollo did not lay down by law that fortitude is lame, and able to march against things only on its left hand, but unable (to do so) against elegancies and Batteries on its right hand ?
or (is it able to march against) both ?
Clin.
Against both, I think.
Athen.
Let us, then, mention again what those pursuits are, in both of your states, which give a taste of pleasures, and do not avoid them in the same manner, as they do not avoid pain, but bring persons into the midst of them, (pleasures,) and induce them, partly by force, and partly by honours, to vanquish them.
Now where is the same thing ordained in your laws respecting pleasures (as respecting pains) ?
Let it be stated, what is that, which in your case causes the same per­ sons to be similarly brave, both with respect to pain and plea­ sures, while they are victorious over those things, in which they ought to be victorious, and to be by no means inferior to ene­ mies the nearest to them and the most difficult (to contend with).
Megil.
In the same manner, 0 guest, as I had the power to mention many laws opposed to pains, I should not thus perhaps possess the means of speaking about pleasures according to their great and conspicuous parts;
but according to their small I might perhaps have the means.
CUn.
Nor should I be able myself to do any thing of this kind clearly in the case of the laws of Crete.
Athen.
This, 0 ye best of guests, is by no means wonderful.
But should any one of us, who is desirous of seeing what is true, and at the same time the best, find fault with any thing in the laws of our respective countries, let us receive (the words)1 from each other not harshly, but with mildness.
CUn.
You speak well, 0 Athenian guest;
and we must obey you.
Athen.
2 For no other conduct than this2 would become men of our age.
CUn.
Certainly.
Athen.
Whether then a person finds fault rightly or not with the Laconian and Cretan polity, is another question.
But perhaps I can better tell what is said by the multitude than either of you can.
For although the laws are regulated even moderately well, yet there would be with you one law the most beautiful, not to permit any youth to inquire which laws are well or ill established, but (to ordain) all to proclaim, with one voice, and with one mouth, that they are all beautifully laid down, since the gods were the parties who gave them;
and that, if any one says otherwise, persons should not endure to hearken to him:
and that if any old man has any thoughts respecting them, he shall place his reasons before a ruler and his equals in age, but not in the presence of a young man.
Clin.
You speak most properly, 0 guest:
and, like a seer, although you were absent from the then thoughts of the party who laid them down, yet you appear to me to have made a conjecture reasonably correct, and to have spoken what is very true.
Athen.
There is then a freedom now from the presence of young men;
but we, on account of our old age, are per­ mitted by the lawgiver to speak about the laws among our­ selves, without doing any wrong.
Clin.
Such is the case.
Do not then be remiss at all in reproving our laws.
For it is not dishonourable to know aught of what is not beautiful;
but by this means it happens that a remedy exists to a party receiving what is said with not an envious feeling, but with a good will.[8.]
Athen.
(You speak) correctly.
I shall not however speak in reprehension of the laws before diligently considering them to the utmost of my power;
or rather, (I shall speak) doubt­ ingly.
For upon you alone of all the Greeks and Barbarians, of whom we hear, the legislator has enjoined to abstain from the greatest pleasures and sports, and not to taste them;
but on the question of pains and fears, which we have lately dis­ cussed, he was of opinion, that if any one should avoid them thoroughly from his infancy, he would, when he came to endure necessary labours, and fears, and pains, avoid those, who are exercised in them, and would become their slave.
The same lawgiver ought, I think, to have thought the same respecting pleasures, and to have said to himself that, if the citizens shall from childhood be inexperienced in the greatest pleasures, and be unpractised in bearing up against pleasures, so as1 not to be compelled to do any thing base for the sake of the sweetness arising from pleasure, they would suffer the same as those, who are vanquished by fear, and become the slaves in a different and still baser manner to those, who are able to bear up against pleasures, and are the masters of what relate to plea­ sures, although they are sometimes the worst of men;
and they would have their soul partly a slave, and partly free, and be unworthy to be called wholly brave and free.
Consider therefore whether aught of what has been now said appears to you to be according to reason.
Clin.
It appears so 1to us somehow, on the speech being spoken.
1
But immediately (and) readily to be confident about questions of such moment would be the act rather of young and senseless persons.
Athen.
But if, 0 Clinias and Lacedæmonian guest, we dis­ cuss some one point of those,2 which we proposed-for after for­ titude let us speak of temperance-what difference shall we find between these polities and those, which are laid down at ran­ dom, 3as the things relating to war just now ?
3Megil.
It is nearly not easy.
4
But it seems that the joint- feasts and gymnastic exercises have been well invented for both.
5Athen.
It appears then, 0 guest, to be a difficult thing for what is incontestable6 on the question of polities to exist in deed as well as in word.
For it seems almost that, as in the case of bodies, it is not possible to order any one regimen for any one body, because7 the very same thing would be seen to do an1 injury to some of our bodies, and a benefit to others, 2 (so too in a state) ;
2 since these gymnastic exercises and joint- feasts are on many other grounds now beneficial to states, but in seditions are hurtful.
This do the children of the 3 Milesians and Bœotians and Thurians3 make evident.
And in truth this very institution, 4legalized of old, appears to have perverted the natural4 pleasures of Venus, not only in the case of men, but of beasts.
5
And of such things a person may ac­ cuse your cities the first, and such others, as have chiefly adopted gymnastic exercises.
And whether one ought to con­ sider things of this kind in a jocose or serious manner, still we must consider that, to the male and female sex, proceeding to a participation in production, the pleasure arising from the act seems to have been imparted according to nature ;
but, that the copulation of males with males, or of females with females, is contrary to nature ;
and that the daring attempt of those who first did so, arose from the non-mastery over pleasure.
We all of us indeed bring an accusation against the Cretans, as having invented the story respecting the fable of Gany­ mede.
(For), since their laws are believed by them to have been from Zeus, they have put together this fable against Zeus, in order that they may enjoy this pleasure, by following forsooth the example of the god.
But let us bid farewell to the fable;
but of those, who direct their attention to laws, nearly the whole consideration is with regard to pleasure and pain, in the case of states and the morals of individuals.
For these two fountains are permitted to flow by nature;
from which he who draws at what place and at what time and what quantity he ought, is happy;
and so is a state, and an individual, and every animal:
but he, (who draws) unskilfully and at an improper time, will live in a manner the contrary to that person.[9.]
Megil.
This, 0 guest, is surely said beautifully.
Never­ theless a want of speech does not lay hold of me as to what I ought to say against it.
Still to me at least it seems correct that the Lacedæmonian lawgiver exhorted persons to fly from pleasures.
But with respect to the Cnossian laws, this per­ son here will, if he pleases, assist us.
But those at Sparta relating to pleasures seem to me to be laid down most beauti­ fully of all.
1
For that, by which men chiefly fall into the greatest pleasures and insulting conduct and all kinds of folly, the law casts out from the whole of our country ;
nor would you see in the fields or in the cities, over which there is to the Spartans a care, banquets or such things as attend upon them, and excite, according to their power, every kind of gratification.
Nor is there one, who, meeting with a person revelling from intoxication, would not immediately inflict on him the great­ est punishment;
nor would he let the party go free, pleading as an excuse a Dionysiac festival, as I once saw was the case with your people when (riding) in carts;
2 and at Tarentum, amongst our colonists, I have seen the whole city intoxicated during the Dionysiac festival;
but with us there is nothing of the kind.
Athen.
0 Lacedæmonian guest, all such things are to be praised, where there are certain endurances of pain ;
but, where there is a remission of the latter, the former are rather of a stupid kind.
For some one, defending our institutions, would very quickly lay hold of you by showing the free manners of your women.
Now in all these cases, occurring at Tarentum, and with us, and with you, one answer appears to free them, so that they are not in a bad state, but in a correct one.
For every one may answer and say to a stranger, expressing wonder on his beholding what is unusual in his own country-Wonder not, 0 guest.
This law exists amongst us ;
but with you perhaps there is upon the same points a different one.
At present however our discourse is not, 0 friends, about different men, but about the vice and virtue of the lawgivers themselves.
But let us speak more fully about all kind of intoxication.
For it is not a thing of a trifling nature;
nor to know it thoroughly is it the province of an inferior lawgiver.
I am not speaking about drinking wine or not, in general, but about intoxication itself, whether it is to be adopted, as the Scythians and Persians use it, and still more the Carthaginians, and Celts, and Iberians, and Thracians, all of whom are warlike nations ;
or, as you use it;
for you, as you say, abstain from it entirely.
But the Scythi­ ans and Thracians use it entirely unmixed with water, both women and men, and pour it on their garments, and imagine they are engaged in a beautiful and blessed occupation.
But the Persians make much use of other luxuries, which you re­ ject, yet, 0 thou best of men, in a more orderly manner than these.
Megil.
All these, however, we pursue1 when we take arms into our hands.
Athen.
Do not, thou best of men, say this.
For many flights and pursuings have been, and will be, without a proof;
on which account, we cannot at any time give a clear defini­ tion, but (rather) a doubtful one, about occupations honourable or not, when we speak of victory and defeat in battle;
espe­ cially since the greater states, when fighting, overcome and enslave the lesser;
as the Syracusans did the Locrians,2 who were thought to be regulated by the best laws of all those around that district;
and as the Athenians did the Ceans ;
3 and we could find numberless other instances of a similar kind.
But let us endeavour by speaking to persuade ourselves of each pursuit taken by itself;
and let us for the present put out of the account victories and defeats, and let us state how a pursuit of this kind is honourable, but of that kind not honourable.
But first hear from me, how we ought to con­ sider what is useful or not as regards those very things.[10.]
Athen.
All those, who in talking lay hold upon any pursuit and propose to praise or blame it immediately it is enun­ ciated, appear to me to act by no means according to reason ;
but to do just the same, as if, while one person is praising wheat1 as good, another should immediately blame it, with­ out having heard either its operation or utility, (and) in what manner, and for what, and with what 2 and how it has itself, and to persons how having themselves, it is useful.
2
The very same thing do we seem to do now in the case of our discourses.
For after merely hearing about drunkenness, some of us immediately blame, 3 and others praise3 it, and very absurdly too;
for making use of witnesses and those who praise, we each of us praise,4 and some of us think we say something decisive, because we adduce many (witnesses);
but others, because we see that those, who do not make use of it (wine), are victorious when fighting.
But this too has been consi­ dered doubtful by us.
If then we go through in this manner each of the other laws, it will not be to me at least according to sound sense.
But 51 am desirous of speaking in the man­ ner, which it seems we ought, by endeavouring, if I can, about this very matter5 [drunkenness],6 to point out the right road for us in all such cases;
since ten thousands upon ten thou- sands of nations are in doubt upon these points, and would contend in a discourse with your two states.
Megil.
If indeed we possess any correct method of inquiry touching these matters, we must not shrink from hearing it.
Athen.
Let us then consider somehow in this way.
Come now, should one person praise the rearing of goats, and the animal itself, as a beautiful possession, but some other person blame it, from having seen goats feeding apart from the goat­ herd, in cultivated grounds, 1 and doing mischief and from see­ ing that every kind of cattle is either without a ruler, or under bad rulers, 2should thus find faulty should we hold that the blame of such a person has blamed any thing whatever soundly ?
Megil.
How should we ?
A then.
But is a commander in ships,3 who possesses merely nautical skill, useful, should he be troubled with sickness or not ?
or how shall we say ?
Megil. 4
By no means (useful) ;
should he have in addition to his skill the suffering you mention.
4Athen.
And what is the commander of armies ?
Is he competent to command, if he possesses the science of war, al­ though he may be timid in danger, and be sick with 5 the drunkenness of fear.
5Megil.
How can he ?
Athen.
But what if he does not possess the art, and is timid ?
Megil.
You are speaking of a person, who is in every respect vile, and by no means 6 a ruler of men, but of some very women.
6Athen.
But what (say you) of him, who praises or blames a community, over which is naturally a ruler, and which with him (the ruler) is useful ? 1
But he, who has never seen it in commu­ nion with a ruler over itself, but always without a ruler, or in communion with bad rulers, 2can we imagine that such in­ spectors of such communities2 will blame or praise any thing usefully ?
Megil.
3
How can those, who have never seen or been con­ nected with any one of such-like communities rightly consti­ tuted ?
3Athen.
Attend then.
Out of many communities, shall we not lay down, that fellow-drinkers and fellow-drinkings are a certain single association ?
Megil.
Yes, very much so.
Athen.
Has any one then ever seen this existing in a proper manner ?
Now it is easy for you to answer, that no one has ever ( seen it) at any time;
for it is neither according to your country nor laws.
But I have met with many, and in many places;
and moreover I have diligently inquired, as I may say, about all;
and I have seen or heard of scarcely one whole (community) existing correctly.
And though (there are) a few and small portions, 4yet the whole together, so to say, are for the most part in error.
4Clin.
How say you, guest, this ?
Speak still more clearly.
For we, as you say, through our inexperience in such mat­ ters, would perhaps, even when meeting with them, not im­ mediately know what in them is right or not.
Athen.
You say what is reasonable ;
but, while I am speak­ ing, do you endeavour to learn.
Do you then acknowledge, that, in all associations and communions of any doings what­ ever, it is proper every where for each to have a commander ?
Athen.
But we have just now said, that the commander of persons fighting ought to be brave.
Athen.
Now the brave man is less disturbed by fears than cowards are.
Clin.
And this too is so.
Athen.
If there were any plan of placing a general over an army, who was not at all timid, nor confused, should we not have done so by all means ?
Clin.
Most certainly.
Athen.
But we are now speaking not of a person about to command an army amongst associations of mien, the foes of foes during a war, but of friends, sharing during a peace in the kind feelings of friends.
Clin. Right.
Athen.
But an association of this kind, if it is attended with drunkenness, will not be without confusion.
Is it not so?
Clin.
How should it be (without)?
'Nay, I imagine quite the contrary.
1
Athen.
In the first place then they have a need of a ruler.
Clin.
How not, as for any thing else ?
Athen.
Must one then furnish a ruler, if possible, not confused ?
Athen.
And he ought, it seems, to be thoughtful with re­ spect to associations.
For he is the guardian of existing friendship, and has the care of it still becoming greater, through the previous association.
Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
It is proper, therefore, to place over the drunken a sober and wise ruler, and not the contrary.
For, if the ruler of the drunken is himself drunk, young, and not wise, he must have great good luck indeed, if he does not perpetrate some mighty mischief.
Clin.
Very great indeed.
Atken.
Should then any one blame such associations, when existing as correctly as possible in states, while he is finding fault with the thing itself, he will perhaps properly blame it.
But if a person blames a pursuit through seeing it erring as much as it can,1 it is evident, in the first place, that he is ignorant that this existed not correctly;
and, in the next place, that every thing will in this manner appear improper, when it is done apart from a sober master and ruler.
Or, do you not understand, that when a pilot, and each ruler of each thing, is drunk, he will overturn every thing, whether ships, or chariots, or an army, or whatever else is ruled by him?[11.]
Clin.
You have said, 0 guest, this at least what is al­ together true.
But tell me moreover 2what good would it do us, should this regulation respecting drinking be correct?
2 just as what we lately stated, that should an army meet with a correct leading, there would be victory in war, a no small good to those who followed;
and so as regards the rest.
But what great advantage will accrue either to individuals or states from a drinking association being placed properly under an instructor ?
Athen.
What great advantage can we say would arise to a state from one boy, or one chorus,3 being properly instructed ?
Or shall we not say, when asked this question, that the state derives very little advantage from the education of one person ?
But if you inquire universally about the education of youth, how does it profit greatly the state, it is not difficult to say, that persons well educated will become good men ;
and becoming such will act in other respects in an honourable manner ;
and still further, that they will conquer their enemies in battle.
Discipline therefore brings with it even victory ;
but victory sometimes produces a want of instruction.
For many become more in­ solent through victory in war, and through their insolence are replete with a thousand other ills.
Now discipline indeed has never at any time been Cadmeian;
4 but there have been, and will be, many victories of this kind among men.
Clin.
You seem to say, friend, that the passing the time in common over wine, if it be done properly, tends in a great part to instruction.
Clin.
Shall you after this be able to state that, what has been just now asserted, is true?
Athen.
To assert positively for truth, 0 guest, that such is the case, while many persons are in doubt, is the province of a god;
but, if it be requisite to state what seems to me, there will be no grudging;
since we have rushed onwards to make for ourselves a discourse about laws and a polity.
Clin.
Let us then endeavour to learn what is your opinion upon these doubtful points.
Athen.
It is proper to do so ;
and that you for the purpose of learning, and myself for that of teaching, should endeavour by some means to lengthen out our discourse.
But first of all, hear from me some such thing as this.
All the Greeks consider this city of ours as fond of talk­ ing and of many words;
but that Lacedæmon and Crete practise, the former a brevity in speech, 1 but the latter, an abundance in thought rather than in words.
But I am con­ sidering lest I shall give you an idea of my speaking much about a trifling matter, 2while cleansing a very long speech2 about drunkenness.
3
But the rectification of it according to nature would not be able, without musical rectitude, to take off in discourses either clear or sufficient;
and on the other hand, music would not be able without the whole of education.
3
Now all this is the work of very many words.
Consider then, what we are to do, if we leave these things for the present, and pass on to some other discourse about laws.
Megil.
Perhaps you do not know, Athenian guest, that our (family) hearth is the public guest1 of your city.
Perhaps then into all the boys2 3of each of us the public guests,3 when they hear that they are the public guests of some city, a certain kind feeling enters immediately from their youth towards that city, as being a second country after their own.
And this very same thing has now taken place with myself.
For im­ mediately on hearing the boys, when the Lacedæmonians were blaming or praising the Athenians for something-How your city, Megillus, say they, has done to us not well or well-on hearing this, and contending 4against these assertions, in your behalf, I have ever had every kind feeling towards those, who are bringing the city into blamed
And now, indeed, both your voice is grateful1 to me;
and that too which is said by many, that such of the Athenians, as are good, are so pre-eminently, appears to be most truly asserted.
For they alone, without necessity, by their very nature, and from a divine allotment, are truly and not feignedly good.
There­ fore on my account at least you may, my friend, boldly say whatever is agreeable to you.
Clin.
And in truth after hearing and receiving, 0 guest, a word from myself, do you with confidence speak what you please.
For you have perhaps heard, that Epimenides was held here a divine man, who was of our family, and ten years prior to the Persian war came to your city, according to the oracle of the god,2 and performed certain sacrifices, which the god had enjoined;
and he told, moreover, the Athenians, who were terrified at the expedition of the Persians, that they would not come for ten years ;
and that, when they did come, they would depart without having done a single thing they expected, and suffer greater evils than they inflicted.
At that time our an­ cestors were hospitably received by yours;
and hence both myself and my parents have a kind feeling towards you.
Athen.
You therefore, as it seems, are prepared to hear ;
and I too am prepared as regards my will, but not very easy as re­ gards my power.
I must however make the attempt.
In the first place then, as (preparatory) to our discourse, let us define what education is, and what power it possesses.
For we say that through this must proceed the discourse taken for the present in hand by us, until it arrives at the deity.
3Clin.
Let us altogether do this, since it is agreeable to you.
Athen.
While then I am saying what it is proper to assert that education is, do you consider whether what is asserted is agreeable to you.
Clin. Say on.[12.]
Athen.
I say then and assert4 that he, who is about to be a good man in any thing whatever, ought immediately from childhood to practise, when engaged in playful and serious pursuits, the very thing suited to each particular of the object in view.
Thus he, who is about to be a good farmer or house­ builder, ought, the latter I to play at building children's houses ;
the former, on the other hand, at tilling the ground;
and he, who brings up each of them should provide for each small instruments, the imitations of the true ones;
and moreover, they should learn previously what is necessary to learn previ­ ously.
For instance, a workman, to measure or use a rule;
and he, who (is to be) a warrior, should in sport ride on horse­ back, or do something else of a similar kind ;
and 3(the mas­ ter of the children should)3 endeavour by sports to turn the pleasures and desires of the children thither, where, when they arrive, it is proper for them to have an end.
We say then, that the very head of instruction is a right bringing up, which will lead as much as possible the soul of him, who sports, to the love of that which it will be requisite for him, when he has become a complete man, to 4lay down as a part of the virtue of the thing.
See then whether, up to this point, what has been asserted docs, as I said, please you.
Athen.
Let not then that, which we assert instruction is, be undefined.
For now, when we blame or praise the bringing up of each person, we say that one has been educated, but another uneducated;
although the men have sometimes been very well educated for 5 retail trades, and those of ship-own­ ers,5 and for 6 the profits from some other things of this kind.
6
For of those, who, it seems, consider such things to be edu­ cation, there would be now no account;
but that (we say) is the education from childhood towards virtue, which causes a person to feel a desire of, and a love for, becoming a perfect citizen, and to know how to govern and to be governed with justice.
Such a bringing up this discourse would, as it seems to me, define, and be willing to call it the only education;
but that, which tends to the acquisition of wealth, or to any bodily strength, or any other cleverness, apart from intellect and justice, is a handicraft trade and illiberal, and not worthy to be called education at all.
Let us not then contend with them1 about a name;
but let the assertion, which has been assented to just now, remain, that those, who are properly educated, become nearly (all of them)2 good.
And it is by no means meet to hold education in dishonour;
since when it is present to the best men, it is the first of things the most beautiful.
And if at any time a person goes astray, and it is possible for him to set himself right, this must ever be done by every one according to his ability, through (the whole of)3 life.
Clin. Right;
and we agree with what you are saying.
Athen.
And we formerly agreed, that those are good, who are able to govern themselves, but those bad, who are not.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
Let us then resume in a still clearer way the very point we were speaking of;
and do you receive me through some resemblance, if perchance I am able to render clear to you a thing of this kind.
CUn.
Only speak.[13.]
Athen.
Do we not consider each of us ourselves1 as one ?
Athen.
But that each has in himself two counsellors, oppo­ site and thoughtless, which we denominate pleasure and pain ?
Clin.
Such is the case.
Athen.
And in addition to both these, there is the opinion about things to be, to which is given the common name of ex­ pectation ;
but individually the expectation, prior to pain, is fear ;
but that, which is prior to its contrary, is confidence.
But in the case of all these there is a reasoning process, as to which of them is better or worse;
which, when it becomes the common determination of the city, is denominated law.
Clin.
I scarcely follow you.
However, say on, what comes after, as if I were following you.
Megil.
And the very same state of suffering is to myself likewise.
Athen.
Let us then think upon these matters in this manner.
Let us consider that each of us is a kind of animal, the wonder of the gods,2 and put together, either as their plaything, or through some serious act;
for on this point we are ignorant;
but this we do know, that these passions are inherent in our nature, and that they pull us, like nerves or ropes, and being themselves contrary, draw us to contrary actions, where virtue and vice are situated apart from each other.
For reason says, that each ought always to follow one of the pullings, and, never abandoning it, draw in a contrary direction by the other nerves;
and that this is the 1 golden and sacred leading1 of the reasoning power, which is called the common law of the state;
but that the other (pullings) are hard, and iron-like;
but that this is soft, as being golden, 2 (and moreover it is uniform,)2 but that the rest arc like every variety of forms.
It is necessary for us then to assist always the most beautiful leading, belonging to the law.
For inasmuch as the power of reasoning is beautiful and gentle, and not violent, its leading has need of assistants, in order that the golden race in us may vanquish the rest of the races.
And thus the story of virtue 3relating to our being a wonder,3 will be preserved ;
and the expression, to be superior or inferior to oneself, will in a cer­ tain manner become more clear, as to what it means ;
and that both a state and a private individual ought, the latter, after receiving in himself the true reason respecting those pullings, to live conformable to it;
but that a state, after receiving reason from some of the gods, 4 or from the very person who knew these particulars,4 ought to lay down reason as a law, 1and to have an intercourse with itself and the rest of states.
1
Thus vice and virtue would be more clearly disjointed;
and this taking place rather conspicuously, both education and the rest of pursuits would be perhaps more apparent, and espe­ cially that relating to the passing the time in drinking, 2 about which it might appear despicable to discourse any further.
2Clin.
But perhaps it would appear to be not unworthy of a long discourse.
Athen.
You speak well;
and let us go through whatever is worthy of the present (mental) exercise.
Clin. Say on.[14.]
A then.
If to this wonder3 we bring drunkenness, what thing shall we make of him ?
CUn.
Looking to what do you ask this ?
Athen.
4To nothing particular.4
But if this (the wonder- thing) should be combined with that, (drunkenness,) what would happen to be the result ?
But I will endeavour to ex­ plain more clearly what I mean.
For I am asking some such thing as this.
Does the drinking of wine cause pleasure, and pain, and anger, and love, to be more violently on the stretch ?
CUn.
Very much so.
Athen.
Does it on the other hand cause the senses, and memory, and opinion, and prudence, to be in like man­ ner more vehement?
5or do these entirely leave him, who may have become saturated with drunkenness.
Clin.
They leave him entirely.
5Athen.
Does he not return then to the same point, (as re­ gards)1 the habit of the soul, which he had when he was a boy ?
Athen.
At that time then he would have the least control over himself.
Clin.
The least.
Athen.
Is not then such a one, we say,2 the most wretched ?
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
Not the old man then, as it appears, is alone twice a child,3 but the man likewise who is drunk.
Clin.
You speak, guest, in the best manner.
Athen.
Is there any reason, which should endeavour to per­ suade us, that we ought to have a taste of this pursuit, and not avoid it, as far as possible, with all our might.
Clin.
It appears there is;
at least you just now said you was prepared to show it.
A then.
You have correctly reminded me;
and I am now prepared, since you have both said that you are willing to hear me with alacrity.
Clin.
How should we not hear you, if on no other account, yet for the sake of the wonderful and the absurd, if it is meet for a man at any time to voluntarily throw himself into every kind of depravity ?
A then.
Are you speaking of the soul ?
Athen.
But what (say we) of the deformity, the leanness, and ugliness, and imbecility of the body ?
should we wonder, my friend, if at any time some one should voluntarily arrive at a thing of that kind ?
A then.
What then, do we think that those, who go to me­ dical shops for the sake of drinking drugs, are ignorant that, for a short time afterwards, and for many days they will have the body in such a state, that, if they were about to endure to the end, they would not accept of life ?
or, do we not know that those, who go to places of exercise and labour, do for the time being become weak ?
Clin.
All this we know.
A then.
And that they willingly go for the sake of the sub­ sequent benefit ?
Clin.
(You speak) most beautifully.
1Athen.
Is it not, then, requisite to think of the rest of pur­ suits in the same manner ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
In the same manner, then, we ought to think about the occupation of (drinking) wine, if it is lawful to think cor­ rectly upon this amongst those.
Athen.
If it should appear to us to possess any utility, not inferior to the occupation relating to the body, it is superior at the very outset to bodily exercise, in that, the latter is (at­ tended) with pain, but the former, not.
Clin.
You speak correctly.
But I should wonder, if we are able to perceive any such thing in it.
Athen.
This, then, as it seems, I must now endeavour to explain to you.
And tell me—Are we able to perceive two kinds of fear, nearly opposite ?
Clin.
Of what kinds ?
Athen.
Such as these.
We surely are in fear when we ex­ pect that ills will arise.
A then.
And we are often in fear of opinion, thinking we shall be considered bad characters, by doing or saying some­ thing not good;
which fear, I think, both we and all others call shame.
Athen.
These then are the two fears I spoke of;
one of which is contrary to pain, and the rest of other fears;
and contrary likewise to the most in number and the greatest in kind of pleasures.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
Does not then a legislator, and every one, from whom there is derived even a little, reverence this fear with the greatest honour ?
and calling it shame, does he not deno­ minate the contrary to this, boldness and shamelessness ?
and has he not held it to be the greatest evil to all, both in a public and private view ?
Clin.
You speak correctly.
Athen.
This fear then preserves us in many other and great matters;
and not a single thing, taken by itself, works out so greatly both victory and safety in war.
For there are two things which work out victory, confidence on the part of foes,1 and the fear of shame on the ground of cowardice2 amongst friends.
Clin.
It is so.
Athen.
It is necessary therefore for each of us to be fear­ less and fearful.
But on what account, either the one or the other, we have defined.
Clin.
Completely so.A then.
When we wish to render any one fearless, in com­ bination with law, we make him such by leading him to the fear of many terrible3 things.
Clin.
So we appear to do.
Athen.
But what, when we endeavour to render any one fearful in combination with justice, must we not cause him to overcome those, who are arrayed with, and previously exercised in, shamelessness, by his having contended with his own lusts ;
and4 by contending with and overcoming his usual mode of living, he must needs become perfect in fortitude ;
but whoso­ ever is unexperienced and unexercised in contests of this kind, he will not become even the half of himself as regards virtue.
I But how will any one be perfectly temperate, who has not fought with, and overcome by reason, and labour, and art, in sport and in earnest, many pleasures and lusts,l that urge him to act with shamelessness and injustice, but who is impassive with respect to all such things.
Clin.
It is by no means probable that he can.[15.]
Athen.
What then, is there a god, who has given any medicine for fear to man, so that by how much the more desirous is any one of drinking it, by so much the more from every draught he thinks himself unhappy, dreads every thing present and to come, and at last, although the bravest of men, proceeds to every kind of fear;
and yet, after having slept, and being re­ leased from the effect of the potion, will always become the same man again.
Clin.
And what potion of this kind,- shall we say, 0 guest, exists amongst men ?A then.
None.
Yet if such a potion had been from any quarter, it would,2 be assured of that,2 have been useful;
3 and we should have been able to converse with him much in such a manner as this respecting it.
3
Come, (say,) thou legislator, whether you have laid down laws for the Cretans, or any other people whatever, are you in the first place willing to be able to receive a touchstone of the citizens, as regards fortitude and timidity ?
Clin.
It is plain that every one would say (he was).
Athen.
What, with security, and without great danger, or the contrary?
Clin.
And this too every one will acknowledge, with security.
Athen.
Would you make use (of this drinking)1 by leading them to fears and trying them during their sufferings, so as to compel (one person)2 to become fearless, by exhorting, and advising, and honouring him;
but disgracing another, who would not be persuaded by you to become in all things such as you enjoin him ;
and would you dismiss him unscathed, who had exercised himself in a proper and manly manner, but im­ pose a punishment upon him, who (had exercised himself) badly ?
or would you not use the potion at all, having no other fault to find with it ?
Clin.
Why should (one) not use it, 0 guest ?
Athen.
There would be, friend, an exercise contrary to those at present, and wonderful for its facility, as regards one indi­ vidual and a few and as many as a person would wish.
And whether any one, being alone in solitude, should place the idea of disgrace before his eyes, and thinking that he ought not to be seen, 3before he is in a good condition,3 should thus exer­ cise himself against fear, and prepare merely a potion in pre­ ference to ten thousand other acts, he would do something proper;
or whether some one trusting to himself to be pro­ perly prepared by nature and careful practice, should not hesitate in the company of many fellow-drinkers to show his power, 4 in the necessary difference of the drinking,4 5 by being superior (to others) and being (his own) mastery so as neither to stumble in one great matter through unseemliness, nor to be changed (in manner) through virtue,' but should 2depart, be­ fore he reached the last drinking,2 3fearing the defeat which all men suffer through drinking.
3
Clin. Certainly.
For such a one, by thus acting, would conduct4 himself with temperance.
A then.
Let us thus then say again to the legislator this.
Be it so, lawgiver, that neither has a god given nearly5 to mankind such a medicine for fear, nor have we devised one ourselves-for I say nothing of sorcerers6 at a banquet-but is there a potion for fearlessness and for excessive confidence, and (doing) unseasonably what is not meet ?
Or how say we ?
Clin.
There is, he will perhaps say, meaning wine.
A then.
Has this a property contrary to that which was just now spoken of?
Does it make a man drinking it, to be in the first place immediately more cheerful than before ;
and by how much the more he tastes it, by so much the more to be filled with good hopes and an opinion of his own power;
and at last is such a person filled, as if he were wise, with all freedom of speech and of behaviour and of all fearlessness, so as to say any thing whatever without hesitation, and do so likewise ?
Clin.
Every one, I think, will agree to this.
A then.
Let us then recollect this, that we said that two things in our souls ought to be cultivated;
one, that we may be as confident as possible;
the other, the very contrary, that we may be as fearful as possible ?
Clin.
These, I think, you said belonged to shame.
Athen.
You very properly remind me.
But since it is meet to practise fortitude and fearlessness in fears,l let us consider whether the contrary ought to be cultivated in the case of things contrary.
Clin.
It is at least probable.
Athen.
In those things, which when we suffer, we are na­ turally remarkably confident and audacious, it will be proper, as it seems, to meditate, how we may become the least possible shameless and full of boldness, but fearful with respect to daring on each occasion to speak, or suffer, or do any thing base whatever.
Clin.
It seems so.
A then.
Are not then these the things, in which we are such, (namely) anger, love, insolence, ignorance, the love of gain, cowardice,2 and these too, riches, beauty, strength, and all such things as make a person, drunk with pleasure, to be mad ?
Now to the making in the first place an easy and harmless experiment in all these, and afterwards to the meditating upon them, 3 with the exception of the touch-stone furnished by wine and sport, what pleasure more in measure, can we mention should it exist in any degree with caution ?
3 For, let us consider.
Of a disposition morose and savage, from which ten thousand acts of injustice arise, 4is it more dangerous for a person, when going for the purpose of contracts, to make a trial, and so run a risk respecting them, or when present at the shows of Dionysus 4 or to a disposition, yielding to venery, to apply a touchstone, by intrusting to it one's own daughters, and sons, and wives,1 and thus by running a risk in things the most dear, to see the moral condition of the soul?
2and by mentioning ten thousand things, a person would not accom­ plish,2 by how much excels 3the contemplating in sport, and without a fixed purpose, and without a reward, bringing damage.
3 4
And this very thing,4 we think, that on these points at least, neither the Cretans nor other persons would doubt of this being a reasonable experiment of each other, and of its superiority, as compared with other touchstones, (on the ground)5 of its slightness, and security, and despatch.
Clin.
This at least is true.
Athen.
This, then, will be one of the most useful things, to know the nature and habit of souls by that art, whose busi­ ness it is to cure them.
Now this, I think, is the business of the statesman's art.
Is it not ?
Clin.
It is entirely so.[1.]
AFTER this, it appears, that point must be considered respecting them, whether this alone has a good, namely, to see how we possess our natures, or whether some greatness of advantage likewise, that deserves much care, is inherent in the proper use of wine-parties.
What then do we assert ?
It is inherent, as our reasoning seems desirous to point out.
But when, and how, let us hear by giving our attention, lest per­ adventure we are shackled by it.
Clin.
Speak then.
Athen.
I am desirous therefore of again recalling to me­ mory what we stated a correct education to be.
For its pre­ servation, as I now conjecture, consists in this employment being properly directed.
Clin.
You speak largely.
Athen.
I say then, that the first puerile 1 perception of children1 is pleasure and pain;
and that these two2 exist in those, to whose soul vice and virtue are present for the first time.
3But (as to) reflection and opinions true (and) firm, that man is happy4 to whom they are present even to old age.
And that man is perfect, who possesses these and all the goods in them.
Now I call the virtue, which is first present to children, education;
but5 should pleasure, and friendship, and pain, and hatred be correctly produced in the soul of those not yet able to understand a reason;
but of those, who have understood reason, should they agree with the reason, 6 to have been cor- rectly accustomed by fitting customs.
6
This very consent is the whole of virtue ;
but its proper nurture is relating to plea­ sures and pains, so as to hate what it ought to hate, immedi­ ately from the beginning to the end, and to love what it ought to love, 1 after having cut off this very thing by reason,1 and calling it education, you would according to my (mind) rightly call it.
Clin.
Both formerly, 0 guest, and likewise now it seems to have been correctly spoken by you on the subject of edu­ cation.
A then.
Correctly indeed.
2
For of these pleasures and pains, after having been rightly brought up by existing edu­ cation,2 the greater part is relaxed and corrupted by men3 during life ;
but the gods, pitying the naturally laborious race of man, have ordained for it, as remissions from labour, the returns 4 of feast-days in honour of the gods, and have given the Muses, and Apollo, the leader of the Muses, and Dio­ nysus, as fellow-feasters, in order that they may correct 5 the nurture that has taken place in the feasts with the gods.
5
It is meet then to see whether the account is hymned by us truly according to nature, or how ?
For it says that the whole, so to speak, of youth is unable to keep quiet in its body and voice, but is ever seeking to be moved and to speak, at one time leaping and skipping, as if dancing with joy and full of fun, at another uttering all kinds of sounds ;
and that the rest of animals have no perception of either order or disorder in their movements, to which 1 is given the name of 2 rhythm and harmony2;
but that the gods, whom we have said were given to us as fellow-choristers, have given to us the per­ ception likewise of what is in rhythm and in harmony in com­ bination with pleasure, by which they excite us and lead the dance, uniting us with each other by means of songs and dances, and given the name 3 of dance from the inherent name of plea­ sure.3 [2.]
Shall we then in the first place receive this ?
Shall we lay down that the first education was through the Muses and Apollo ?
or how ?
Clin.
Thus.
Athen.
He therefore, who is uneducated, will be with us one, who has not joined a choir;
but him, who has been educated, we must lay down as one, who has sufficiently engaged in a choir.
Clin.
Certainly.
Athen.
But a choir, as a whole, is dancing and singing.
Clin.
It is necessarily so.
Athen.
He then, who is properly educated, would be able to sing and dance well.
Clin.
It seems so.
Athen.
Let us see then what has been now asserted.
Clin.
What is that ?
Athen. (A person), we have said, sings well and dances well.
Whether shall we add that he does so, if he sings what is beautiful and dances what is beautiful, or not ?
Clin.
Let us add it.
Athen.
What then, should a person consider things beauti­ ful, as beautiful, and things base, as base, and use them as such, will such a one be better educated for us, with respect to dancing and music, who1 may be sufficiently able to minister to the body and voice what is considered beautiful, but yet does not rejoice in things beautiful, nor hate such as are void of beauty ?
Or he, who, though he is not altogether able to act2 or think rightly, with respect to his voice and body, yet acts rightly with respect to pleasure and pain, embracing such things as are beautiful, and feeling a disgust at such as are not beautiful ?
Clin.
You are speaking, guest, of a great difference of edu­ cation.
Athen.
If, then, we three know what is beautiful in singing and dancing, we likewise know correctly the person educated or not educated:
but, if we are ignorant of this, we shall not be able to know if there is, and where, a guard of education.
Is it not this ?
Clin.
It is thus.
Athen.
We must then in the next place, like dogs on the track, seek out what is beautiful in form, and melody, and singing, and dancing.
But if these shall escape us and get away, our discourse about proper education, whether Grecian or Barbarian, will hereafter be in vain.
Clin.
Truly so.
Athen.
Be it so.
What forms then, or melody, is it proper to call the beautiful ?
Shall we say that the form and the voice of a brave and a timid soul, held fast by1 the same and equal labours, are similar ?
Clin.
How (similar),2 since neither are their colours ?
3Athen.
Well (said), my friend.
But in music there are both forms and melody,4 since music is conversant with rhythm and harmony;
5 so that it is possible for a person, making use of a resemblance, as the chorus-teachers do, to speak correctly of a melody or form as being in good rhythm or in good harmony, but not as being of a good colour.
Now of a timid, and of a brave man, there is a certain form or melody;
and (one) has the power to call those properties of brave men, beautiful, but of timid, ugly.
And that there may not be to us a great prolixity respecting these matters, let all the beautiful forms and melodies connected with the soul or body be all abstractedly the property of virtue, either of itself or of some image of it;
but of vice on the other hand, all that is of a contrary kind.
Clin.
6
You correctly make a call upon me;
6 and let it be decided, for the present, that such is the state of the case.
A then.
But (let us consider) 7 still further this ;
whether all of us are similarly delighted with all dancing, or it wants much of such being the case ?
Clin.
It wants it entirely.
A then.
What then shall we say is that, which has caused us to err ?
Is it because the same things are not beautiful to all of us ?
Or that some are, but do not appear to be the same ?
For surely no one will say that the choric movements of vice are more beautiful than those of virtue;
or that he is de­ lighted himself with the forms of depravity, but others with music, the contrary to this.
And yet the majority assert, that the correctness of music consists in the power which imparts pleasure to the soul.
But this is not to be endured, nor is it holy to speak so at all.
But this more probably causes us to err.[3.]
Athen.
Since the things relating to choric movements are the imitations of manners, that take place in all kinds of actions, and I fortunes, and morals, and imitations, each going through.
1
For those then, to whom is suited what is said, or sung, or danced, according to nature or custom, or both, it is necessary to rejoice in and praise those acts, and to call them beautiful;
but for those, to whom they are contrary to nature, or manners, or custom, it is possible neither to rejoice in nor praise them, but to call them base.
And they, to whom the things of nature happen to be right, but the things of custom the contrary, or the things of custom right, but the things of nature the contrary, 2 address their praises contrary to plea­ sures.
2
For they say that each of these is pleasant, but wrong ;
and in the presence of others, whom they consider to be intellectual, they are ashamed for such movements to take place in their body, and ashamed to sing, 1as if making a display with seriousness1 of things beautiful;
but by them­ selves they are delighted with them.
2Clin.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
Does something then bring any injury to him, who is delighted with the forms or melodies of depravity ?
or an advantage on the other hand to those, who are pleased with the contraries to these ?
Clin.
It is probable.
Athen.
Is it probable, or is it necessary also, for the same thing to take place, as when any one, associating with the de­ praved habits of depraved men, does not hate, but rejoices in and admits them;
and yet blames his own depravity in the way of fun, as if he were in a dream.
Surely at that time it is necessary for the party rejoicing to be assimilated to the things in which he rejoices, even though he is ashamed to praise them.
And yet what greater good, or evil, can we say, would of every necessity happen to us than a thing of this kind ?
Clin.
I think, none.
Athen.
But where laws are beautifully established, or will be at some future period of time, can we think that the in­ struction touching the Muses and amusement, will be in the power of poets, so that, whatever delights a poet in compo­ sition, or what is connected with rhythm, or melody, or verse, he can, by teaching it to the children of the well-regulated, and to young men formed into choirs, work out whatever may happen with respect to virtue and depravity ?
Clin.
This has no particle of reason ;
for how could it ?
Athen.
But, now it is in their power to do so in all states, so to say, except in Egypt.
Clin.
But how say you that a thing of this kind has been established by law3 in Egypt?
Athen.
It is wonderful even to hear.
For, as it seems, this doctrine, of which we are now speaking, has been known of old amongst them, that young men in cities should be ac- customed to occupy themselves with beautiful forms and beau­ tiful melodies.
And after regulating these, as to what they are, and of what kind they may be, they exhibit them in their tem­ ples ;
and except these it is not lawful either for painters or others, who work out forms, and whatever else there may be, to introduce any novelty, or even to think of any other than those of the country;
nor is it lawful at present to do this, either in these particulars or in the whole of music;
and you will, by observing, discover, that what have been painted and sculptured there ten thousand years ago,—1 and I say ten thou­ sand, not as a word, but a fact,—1 are neither more beautiful, nor more ugly, than those turned out of hand at the present day, but are worked off according to the same art.
Clin.
You say what is wonderful.
Atlien.
It is, however, a matter relating pre-eminently to law and politics.
But you would find other things there of a trifling kind.
But this respecting music is true, and worthy of consideration, that it was possible for 2 a law-giver upon these points to lay down2 firmly and with confidence melo­ dies, possessing correctness naturally.
But this would be the work of a deity, or of some divine person;
as they say there, that the melodies, which have been preserved for such a length of time, are the production of Isis.
So that, as I said, if any one is able to understand their correctness ever so little, he ought with confidence to reduce them to law and order.
Since the search after pleasure and pain does, through3 the seeking perpetually to make use of new music, possess 4 scarcely no great4 power towards corrupting the consecrated dancing, by finding fault with its antiquity.
The dancing there at least it does not seem to have been able to corrupt, but the contrary has been entirely the case.
Clin.
It appears from what has been just now stated, that it would be so.[4.]
Athen.
Shall we not then confidently assert that there is in music and sport together with dancing a correct use in some such manner as this ?
We are glad, when we think we are doing well;
and, when we are glad, think on the other hand we are doing well?
Is it not so?
Clin.
It is so.
Athen.
And at such a time in our gladness we are unable to keep quiet.
eliM.
It is so.
Athen.
Are not then the young amongst us ready to dance ?
and do not we their elders think we conduct ourselves pro­ perly in looking upon them, while we take a delight in their sports and revelry, since elasticity fails us 1 at our time of life,1 which regretting 2and loving2 we thus establish games for those, who are able in the highest degree to carry us by the aid of memory to our youth.
Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
Do we then think that the majority give really in vain the account now told of those who celebrate festivals, that it is meet to consider him the wisest, and to decide that he is the victor, who causes us to be delighted and to rejoice in the greatest degree ?
For since we are permitted to play at this period, it is surely meet, for him, who causes the most in number to be glad in the highest degree, to be honoured the most;
and, as I just now said, 3to bear off the prize of victory.3
Is not this rightly said ?
and would it not be (rightly) done, if it took place in this way ?
Clin.
Perhaps so.
Athen.
But, 0 blessed man, let us not hastily decide upon a matter of this kind;
but, dividing it into parts, let us con­ sider it in some such manner as this.
If any one should at any time simply establish a certain game-but without defining whether it is gymnastic, or musical, or equestrian—and, col­ lecting together all those in the city, should make a proclama­ tion, after laying down the prizes of victory, for any one who wished to come and enter the contest for pleasure alone, and that he, who should delight the spectators the most, without receiving any order as to the manner (of contending),1 and be victorious in effecting this very thing in the greatest degree possible, and should be adjudged to be the most agreeable of all the competitors,1 what do we think would result from this proclamation ?
Clin.
Of what are you speaking ?
Athen.
It is surely likely that one would exhibit, like Ho­ mer, a rhapsody, another guitar-playing ;
2 one a tragedy, and some again a comedy.
Nor would it be wonderful, if some one, by exhibiting things of wonder, should think that he is especially the victor.
Now when these and other competi­ tors without number come together, can we say which of them would justly be the victor?
Clin.
You ask an absurd question.
For who can answer you on this point, 3 as if he were cognizant of it,3 before 4 hearing and being himself a hearer4 of each of the champions ?
Athen.
What then, are you willing for me to reply to this absurd question ?
Athen.
Now if very little children were to decide, they would decide that he who had exhibited the things of wonder, 5 (was the victor over the others).
5
Is it not so ?
Athen.
But if greater boys (were to decide, they would de­ cide in favour of the party exhibiting) comedies;
but the women, who are better educated, and the young men, and perhaps nearly the whole multitude, (would decide in favour of the party exhibiting) a tragedy.
Clin.
Perhaps so.
Athen.
But perhaps we old men would hear with the great­ est delight the rhapsodist, when stringing together in a beau­ tiful manner the Iliad and Odyssey, or some of the works of Hesiod, and say that he was very far the victor.
Who then would be rightly the victor ?
This (must be stated1) after these.
Clin. Certainly.
Athen.
It is evident that it is necessary for me and you to say that those are properly the victors, who are judged so by persons of our age;
2for habit seems to us to be by far the best of things at present which are in all states and every where.2[5.]
Athen.
I grant then thus much to the many, that music ought to be judged of by pleasure, yet not by that of any person one meets with,-but that that is nearly the most beau­ tiful music, which delights the best of men, and such as are sufficiently educated;
but especially, that which delights one person, who excels in virtue and education.
On this account we say that the judges of these things stand in need of virtue;
because they ought to be partakers of the rest of prudence and fortitude.
For a true judge ought not to learn how to judge from a theatre,3 being stupefied by the clamours of the multitude, and by his own ignorance;
nor on the other band, while knowing (something),2 ought he through unmanliness.
and cowardice to give from the same mouth, with which when about to judge, he called upon the gods, 3a decision contain­ ing a falsehood,3 with an easy disposition.
For a judge does not sit as the disciple, but, as is just, the teacher rather of the spectators, and as about to oppose himself to those, who do not afford pleasure fitly and properly to the spectators.
For by the old law of Greece, it was permitted (to 4do), what the law of Sicily and Italy (permits) 4 at present;
(which5) by leaving to the mass of spectators to decide, by the holding up of hands, upon the victor, has corrupted the poets themselves ;
for they write according to the depraved pleasure of their judges ;
6 so that the spectators instruct themselves ;
6 and it has corrupted likewise the pleasures of the theatre.
For while it is meet that the spectators should, by always hearing of manners better than their own, have a superior pleasure, it happens now that they do quite the contrary.
What then do the matters dis­ cussed in the present discourse intend to point out ?
Con­ sider whether it is this.
Athen.
The reasoning appears to me, after making a third or fourth revolution, to come to the same point-that edu­ cation is the drawing and leading of youth to that, which is called by the law right reason, and which has been decreed by the most reasonable and oldest men through their experi­ ence to be really correct.
In order then that the soul of a youth may be accustomed not to feel joy or sorrow in things contrary to the law, and to those that are recommended1 by law, but follow in joy and in sorrow after the same things as those which an old man does, for the sake of this, the compositions which we call odes, and which are truly incantations for the soul, are (said)2 to have been produced, having been carefully adapted to that kind of symphony, of which we are speaking ;
but on account of the soul of children not being able to bear a serious pursuit, sports and (other)3 odes (are said) 4to be played on the pipe and executed.
4
Just as in the case of per­ sons who are sick and have their bodies in a weak state, they, who have the care of them, endeavour to bring useful food in pleasant meats and drinks;
but that, which is annoying,5 in such as are bitter, in order that they may receive kindly the one, and be accustomed to reject rightly the other.
6In the same way a correct lawgiver will by words fairly spoken and to be praised, persuade, or, not persuading, compel, the poet to re­ present correctly the attributes of men, temperate, and brave, and good in every way, by composing his forms in rhythm, and his melodies in harmony.
6Clin.
Do persons, by Zeus, seem to you, 0 guest, to act thus at present in other states ?
For, as far as I hear, what you are now speaking of I do not know to be done except by us and the Lacedæmonians;
but there are certain novelties ever taking place in dancing, and all the rest of music, and changes not through law, but some inordinate pleasures, which are very far from being the same, and in the same manner, as you have said occur in Egypt, 1 but never belong to the same.
1Athen.
Most excellent, 0 Clinias !
But if I have appeared to you, as you say, to speak of these things as existing at pre­ sent, I should not wonder, if I have done this through my not clearly stating my meaning.
But as to what I mean as taking place with respect to music, perhaps I have spoken of it in such a way 2 as to seem to you to speak of it.
2
For to abuse things which are incurable, and far advanced in error, is by no means agreeable, although it is necessary sometimes.
But since the same things appear good to you likewise, come, tell me, do such kind of things exist amongst you and these here, more than amongst the other, Greeks ?
Athen.
But if they thus existed amongst others likewise, should we say that they would thus be better than they now are ?
Clin.
By far better, if they subsisted, as they do amongst these here and with us, and as you just now said they ought to subsist.[6.]
Athen. 3
Come then, (say,) should we agree3 for the present, are the things mentioned by you in every kind of edu­ cation and music these ?
Do you compel poets to assert that a good man, if he is temperate and just, is fortunate and happy, and if he is a big man and strong, and if little and weak, and if rich or not ?
and that, although he is richer than 4 both Cinyras and Midas,4 but unjust, he is miserable, and lives in sorrow, and, as the poet says,5 if he says rightly, “ I would not mention nor place in account as a man " him, who does not perform all that is called beautiful with justice, and possess it likewise.
For being such a one1 he will stand near and grapple with the foe ;
2 but he, who is unjust, will 3neither dare to look upon gory slaughter, nor will he vanquish in running the Thracian Boreas,3 nor will there ever be to him any other of the things called good.
For what are called good by the many, are not rightly called so.
For it is said that health is the best thing ;
beauty the next;
strength the third;
and riches the fourth;
and numberless other things are called good.
Thus, to see and hear acutely, and to possess with a clear perception all that is connected with the senses;
and further, to do like a tyrant whatever you wish ;
and, what is said to be the completion of all happi­ ness, to become, after possessing all these, as quickly as pos­ sible, immortal.
But you and I surely say that all these are the best possessions for just and holy men;
but for the unjust, all the worst, beginning from health.
(For to be well),4 to see, hear, and possess the (other) senses, and, in short, to live, is the greatest evil, when a man is immortal 5 [through the whole of time],5 and possesses all that is called good, except justice and all virtue ;
but it is a less evil, should such a per­ son survive for the shortest time.
In this manner, I think, you will persuade, and, as I said,6 compel the poets with you to speak ;
and moreover, that persons who follow them should, by giving out rhythms and harmonies, thus educate your young men?
7Is it not so?
Look, then.
7
For I clearly assert, that the things that are called evil, are good to the unjust, but to the j ust, are evil;
but that things good are to the good truly good, but evil to the wicked.
In what then, I asked, do you and I agree, or how ?
Clin.
We appear ( to agree) in some things, but not in others.[7.]
Athen.
Is it then in the case of a person possessing health, and wealth, and despotic power completely, and, I add further, superior strength and bravery, together with immor­ tality, and to whom there is none else of the things called evil, but who has only injustice and insolence in his own person, that I do not perhaps persuade you that the person so living is not only not fortunate, but that he is clearly wretched ?
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
Be it so.
What then ought we to say after this ?
For if he is brave, and strong, and beautiful, and rich, and does through the whole of life whatever he wishes, does it not necessarily appear to you, that if he is unjust and insolent, he will live in a shameful manner ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
What then, and wickedly too ?
Clin.
This (does) not (seem) equally.
Athen.
What then, (would he not do so) unpleasantly, and not conducing to his own interest ?
Clin.
How can we admit this too ?
Athen.
How ?
If, as it seems,1 some god, my friends, should grant us to agree, as we now nearly dissent from each other.
For these things appear to me as necessary, as it is not even 2 for Crete, friend Clinias, to be clearly an island.
And if I were a legislator, I would endeavour to compel both the poets and all persons in the state to speak in this manner ;
and I would impose nearly the greatest of punishments, should any one in the land assert that there are certain wicked men, who lead a pleasant life ;
or that some things are more advantageous and lucrative, but others more just.
And I would persuade my citizens to as­ sert many other things, contrary to what are now advanced, it seems, by the Cretans and Lacedæmonians, and, differing from the rest of mankind.
For come, by Zeus and Apollo, (say) ye best of men, if we asked the very gods, who laid down laws for us, whether the most just is the most pleasant life, or whether there are some two lives, of which one is the most pleasant, and the other the most just?
and if they should say there are two, we should perhaps ask them again, if we in- quired properly,-Whom ought we to call the most happy, those, who lead the most just life, or those, who lead the most pleasant one ?
Now, should they say those, who lead the most pleasant life, their answer would be absurd.
But I am desirous that an expression of this kind should not be said of the gods, but of fathers and lawgivers rather.
Let then the ques­ tion previously put be asked of a father and a lawgiver, and let him say that he, who lives the most pleasant life, is the most happy.
After this, I would say thus-Have you not, father, wished me to live most happily ?
And yet you have never ceased exhorting me to live most justly.
He, then, who lays down1 in this manner, whether he is a legislator or a father, would, I think, appear absurd, and unable to speak consistently with himself.
But if he should, on the other hand, proclaim that the most just life is the most happy, every one, perchance, who hears him, would, I think, inquire-
What is it, which the law praises in that life as good and beautiful, and better than pleasure ?
For what good, separate from pleasure, can there be to a just man?
Come, (tell me,) -Is renown and praise from both men and gods a thing good and beautiful, but at the same time unpleasant ?
and in­ famy the contrary ?
2
We shall say-By no means, 0 thou dear lawgiver.
But neither to do any one an injury, nor to be in­ jured by any one, is it unpleasant, but at the same time good and beautiful?
And are the other things pleasant, but shameful and base ?
2Clin.
How can they be ?[8.]
Athen.
The reason, then, which does not separate the pleasant and the just, and the good and the beautiful, is per­ suasive, if towards nothing else, yet at least towards the wish to live a holy and a just life;
so that the language of the law­ giver will be most disgraceful and opposed (to itself) should one deny that these things are so.
For no one will voluntarily wish to be persuaded to do that, on which joy does not follow more than sorrow.
But that which is seen from a distance produces upon all, so to say, and especially upon boys, a ha­ ziness.
But the lawgiver, by dispersing the mist, will estab­ lish for us an opinion the contrary to this ;
and he will persuade the citizens, somehow or other, by customs, and praises, and arguments, that things just and unjust are both painted with shadow-lines ;
1 that things unjust, appearing contrariwise to that of the just, being viewed by the unjust and depraved man himself, pleasant;
but things just, most unpleasant;
but by the just man, all the contrary to every one as regards both.
1Clin.
It appears so.
Athen.
But which shall we say is the more decisive truth of j udgment ?
is it that of the worse soul, or the better ?
Athen.
It is necessary then that an unjust life should not only be more base and depraved, but, in truth, more unplea­ sant than a just and holy life.
Clin.
It appears nearly so, my friends, according to the present reasoning.
Athen.
Would then a legislator, from whom there is even a little benefit, although the fact were not so, as the reasoning has detected it to be, 2 dare, if there were any thing else, to tell an untruth to young persons for their good?
2 3knowing that he never would have told3 a falsehood more advantageous than this, and 1 more able to cause them to do all just things,1 not by force, but willingly.
Clin.
Truth is indeed, 0 guest, a beautiful thing, and stable.
It does not however appear an easy thing to persuadedAthen.
Be it so.
And yet that fabulous tale of the Sido­ nian, although improbable, has been easy to persuade, and numberless others (likewise).
Athen.
That, teeth having been sown at one time, armed men were produced from them.
Now this is a great example to a lawgiver, that he will persuade the souls of young men to whatever 3 a person may attempt to persuade;
3 so that he ought by considering to find out nothing else, than by per­ suading to what he may work out the greatest good to a state;
and for this to discover every contrivance, after what manner the whole of such fellow-dwellers may speak as much as possible one and the same thing on these points, continually through the whole of life, in odes, and fables, and rational discourses.
(So I think).
4
But if it appears to you to be otherwise than in this way, there will be no grudging about contesting these points in our discourse.
Clin.
It does not appear to me that either of us can contest them.
Athen. 5
It shall then be my business to speak after this.

For I assert, that it is necessary for the choirs, being three, to bring all together6 an enchantment upon the still young and tender souls of boys, and to say all the other beautiful things we have discussed, and shall still discuss.
And let this be the sum of them.
By saying that the same life has been pro­ nounced by the gods to be the most pleasant, and the best, we shall, at the same time, speak with the greatest truth, and more persuade those, whom we ought to persuade, than if we assert any thing else.
Clin.
We must agree to what you say.
Athen.
In the first place then, the boy-choir of the Muses would most correctly enter the first, about to sing in public subjects of this kind, with all earnestness, and for the whole city.
And let the second be the choir (of men) up to thirty years old calling upon the god Paean, as a witness in behalf of the truth of what is said, and praying him to be, together with Persuasion, propitious to the youth.
And it is necessary for the third to sing, consisting of those who are above thirty, and up to sixty years old;
but those after that period-for they are no longer able to endure singing—1 are left as the tellers of stories relating to the same habits through a divine oracle.
1Clin.
Who do you mean, guest, by these third 2 choirs?
for I do not clearly understand what you mean to say about them.
Athen.
And yet these are nearly the parties, for whose sake most of the above assertions were made.
Clin.
We do not yet understand.
But endeavour to speak still more clearly.[9.]
Athen.
We said, if we remember, at the beginning of our discourse, that the nature of all young persons was fiery, and unable to keep quiet either in body or voice, but that'it was always speaking without order, and leaping;
and that of the rest of animals not one had a sense of order in both of these things, but that the nature of man alone possessed it;
and that rhythm was the name given to the order of motion, but to that of the voice, when the acute and the grave are mingled together, the name of harmony was addressed;
1 and that both together are called a choir.
We said too that the gods in pity have given us Apollo and the Muses as our associ­ ates in, and leaders of, the choir;
and we mentioned, if we re­ collect, Dionysus as the third.
Clin.
How do we not remember ?
Athen.
Now the choir of Apollo and the Muses have been mentioned;
and it is necessary for the third and remaining choir of Bacchus to be spoken of.
Clin.
How so ?
Say on.
For to a person hearing on a sud­ den a choir of old men in honour of Dionysus it would seem very absurd, if persons, who have been born above thirty and fifty and up to sixty years old, were to join in the dance for that god.
Athen.
You speak most truly.
But I think there is need of a reason on these points, to show how this, taking place thus, may take place rationally.
Athen.
Are then the previous points agreed upon ?
Clin.
Respecting what ?
Athen.
That every man and boy, freeman and slave, female and male, and the whole city itself, should never cease singing for the whole city what we have gone through, 2yet changed perpetually in some manner, and exhibiting altogether a va­ riety, so that there may be to the singers no satiety of hymns and pleasure.
2Clin.
How should it be not agreed that this ought to be done ?
Athen.
Where then will the best part of the city, and which by its age together with intellect is the most persuasive of those in the state, effect the greatest good by singing the most beautiful subjects?
or shall we thus thoughtlessly omit that, which would be the chief object of songs, the most beautiful and the most useful ?
Clin.
But it is impossible to omit it, as1 has been just now said.
Athen.
How then would it be proper (to do)2 this ?
Con­ sider, if it is in this way.
Clin.
In what way ?
A then.
Every one on becoming rather old, is full of hesita­ tion with respect to songs, and is less delighted 3in doing this;
and when a necessity arises,3 is the more ashamed by how much the older and more modest he is.
Is it not so ?
CUn.
It is so.
Athen.
He will therefore be still more ashamed to stand up and sing in the theatre, and amongst persons of all kinds;
and this too, if like the choirs that, contending for victory, are compelled, after practising their voices, to sing lean and fast­ in,,, such persons should, by singing altogether in a manner unpleasant to themselves and with feelings of shame, perform without readiness their part.
Clin.
You speak of what is most necessary (to happen).
Athen.
How then shall we soothe them into being ready for singing ?
Shall we not lay down a law, in the first place, that boys shall not taste wine at all, until they are eighteen years old?
(thus) teaching them, that it is not proper 4to bring by a funnel fire to fire,4 into the body and soul, before they attempt to proceed to labours, (and) exercising a caution about the mad-like habit of young persons ;
but afterwards to taste indeed wine in moderation, until they are thirty years old ;
but that a young man is by all means to keep himself from intoxication and much wine;
but on reaching forty years, to indulge freely in convivial meetings, and to call upon the other gods, and especially to invite Dionysus to the mystic rites and sports of old men, 5in which he kindly5 bestowed wine upon man as a remedy against the austerity of old age, so that through this we might grow young again, and that, by a for­ getfulness1 of heart-sinking, the habit of the soul might become from a harder state more soft, just as iron becomes, when it is placed in the fire, and moulded thus more readily.
In the first place then, will not each person, who is thus affected, be willing with more readiness (and) with less shame, not indeed amongst many, but a moderate number, nor amongst strangers, but familiar friends, to sing, and, as we have often said, to join in a song?
Clin.
Very much so.
A then.
To lead them then to join with us in singing, this method will not be altogether unseemly.
CUn.
By no means.[10.]
Athen.
But what voice, and what music, will these men pour forth ?2
Or is it not evident that it must needs be some one becoming to them ?
Athen.
Now what will be becoming to divine men ?
Will it not be that of choirs ?
Clin.
We indeed, 0 guest, and these here,3 would not be able to sing any other song, than what we have learnt in the choirs, and have been accustomed to sing.
Athen.
And reasonably so.
For you have not in reality hit upon the most beautiful singing.
For you have the polity of an army, but not of those dwelling in cities;
and you keep your young men collected together in pastures, like colts, and feeding in herds.
And not one of you has taken to himself his own offspring, and 4dragging from his fellow-feeders4 one that is very wild and very unmanageable,5 placed over him a groom, 6 or privately6 educates him by rubbing him down and rendering him gentle, and giving all that is suited to the bring­ ing up of a boy;
from whence he would become not only a good soldier, but able to administer a state and cities, and one who, as we said at the beginning, would be more warlike than the soldiers of Tyrtæus, and would honour always and every where the possession of fortitude, as being the fourth, and not the first part of virtue, for the benefit of individuals and the whole state.
Clin.
I do not know, guest, why you are thus again hold­ ing cheap our lawgivers.
Athen.
I do so, if (so I do), by not giving, my good man, my mind to that point.
1
But by what road the discourse may carry us, by that, if you are willing, we will go.
For if we possess music more beautiful than that of the choirs and in the public theatres, let us endeavour to impart it to such as we said were ashamed of that music, and to seek that, which is the most beautiful, to share with them.
2Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
In the first place, then, it is meet for this to be pre­ sent to all things, which a certain agreeableness follows, that there be either this (the agreeableness) itself alone an object of the most serious attention,3 or a certain rectitude, or, in the third place, utility.
For instance, I say, that agreeableness follows food and drink, and every kind of aliment, and this agreeableness we should call pleasure ;
4 but if it contributes to health, we denominate it rectitude and utility.
4CUn.
Entirely so.A then.
1
And that learning too does an agreeableness follow, (namely,) the pleasure, but that it is the truth which perfects the rectitude and utility, and the well and the beautifully.
1Clin.
It is so.
Athen.
2But what, in the working out of things similar, should such arts as are productive of resemblances effect this, namely, for pleasure to result from them, would it not be most just to call it, should it by following be produced, an agree­ ableness ?
2Clin. Certainly.A then.
But the equality rather 3of the so great, and of the such kind,3 would, to speak universally, effect the rectitude of such things.
Clin. Right.
Athen.
Hence that alone can be rightly judged of by plea­ sure, which works out and affords neither a certain utility, or truth, or similitude;
nor, on the other hand, a hurt;
but which subsists for the sake of that very thing alone, (namely,) agree­ ableness, which follows the other things, and which a person may most beautifully denominate pleasure, when none of those follow it.
Clin.
Are you speaking of innoxious pleasure alone ?
Athen.
Yes;
and I say that this very same (agreeableness) is sport, when it does neither an injury or a benefit worthy of serious consideration or mention.
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
Shall we not then assert, from what has been now said, that all imitations, and moreover all equality, ought to be judged of the least by pleasure and false opinion ?
For equality 4would not be equality, or symmetry symmetry 4 wholly,1 although it appears so to some one, or some one is [not] 2 delighted with it;
but they are so from truth, the most of all things, 3 but from any thing else the least.
3Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
Do we not therefore say, that all music is productive of resemblances and is imitative ?
Athen.
When therefore any one asserts that music is to be judged of by pleasure, we must receive such an assertion the least of all, and seek in the least degree such music, as a serious thing, if, perchance, it exists any where ;
but that music (rather) which possesses a resemblance to the imitation of the beautiful.
Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
By those then, who are inquiring after the most beautiful singing and music, there ought, as it seems, to be sought not that which is pleasant, but that which is right.
For the rectitude of imitation, as we said, was then, when the thing imitated is exhibited, as great and such as it is.
Athen.
And surely every one will allow this with respect to music, that all its poetry is an imitation and resemblance.
And this will not all poets and auditors and players allow ?
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
It is meet then, as it seems, for a person to know in the case of each poem, what it is, if he is about not to err in that point.
For he who does not know its being, what it means, and of what it is the resemblance, will scarcely 4 under­ stand the rectitude or erroneousness of its intention.
Athen.
But would he, who does not know, ever be able to decide upon what is well or ill (done) ?
But I am not speak­ ing very clearly;
and perhaps it will be thus said more clearly.[11.
J Athen.
There are surely numberless resemblances, as regards the sight.
Athen.
What then, if any one in these cases does not know what each of the imitated bodies is, would he ever know whether it is worked out correctly?
I speak of some such thing as this, for instance, whether it has the joints1 of the body, and the positions of each of the parts of the body, and how many are (the joints), and of what kind, when placed near to what kind, have (the parts) received their fitting arrange­ ment, and moreover their colours and shapes;
or whether all these are worked out in a confused manner.
Do you think that any one can at all know these particulars, who does not know what is the animal imitated ?
Clin.
How should he ?
Athen.
But what, if any one knows that the thing painted, or modelled is a man, and that it has received all its parts, colours, and shapes from art, is it not necessary for a person knowing these facts, to know readily that too, whether it is beautiful, or whether it is in any respect wanting in beauty ?
Clin.
We should all of us, so to say, 0 guest, have known the beautiful points in animals.
2Athen.
You speak with perfect propriety.
Is it not then necessary for a person who is about to be an intelligent judge, to possess these three things, as regards every representation both in painting and music and every where ?3
In the first place, to know what the thing is ;
then that it is 4 rightly;
and then thirdly, that whatever it be of representations, it is worked out well in words and melodies and rhythms ?4Clin.
It appears so.
Athen.
Let us then be not faint-hearted in speaking of music in what point it is difficult.
For since it has been bruited beyond the other representations, it requires of all represent­ ations the greatest caution.
For a person erring in this, will be injured in the greatest degree by receiving kindly1 de­ praved manners;
and it is most difficult to perceive them, through poets being inferior to the Muses themselves.
For these would never err so much as, in composing 2 the words of men, to give the figure and melody of women;
and on the other hand in putting together the melody and gestures of freemen, to fit them for the rhythms3 of slaves and the not free;
or, in taking as a subject the rhythms and gestures of a freeman, to assign a melody or words contrary to the rhythms.
Moreover, they would never place together the voices of beasts and men, and instruments, and every kind of noise, as imitating one certain thing.
But human poets, 4 interweaving things of this kind very much, and mixing them together irrationally,4 would produce a laugh amongst men, such, as Orpheus says, " have obtained by lot the season of delight."
5
For the poets perceive6 all these things mingled together;
and moreover they tear away rhythm and figures7 apart from melody, put- ting naked words into measures, and, on the other hand, me­ lody and rhythm without words, and employing the playing the harp and the hautboy.
nakedly ;
1 from which it is very dif­ ficult to know what rhythm and harmony mean without words, and to which of the imitations,2 worthy of mention, they are similar.
But it is necessary to understand that every thing of this kind is full of rusticity, 3as much as it loves swiftness and not stumbling,3 and the voice of wild beasts, so as to make use of playing on the hautboy and the harp, except for dancing and singing.
But to use either of those instruments unaccompanied with words, would be wholly a non-musical education, and a wonder-exciting act.
In this way such assertions have a reason.
And we are considering not only that persons of thirty years old, and those even beyond fifty, ought to make use of the Muses, but in what they ought.
This then, for such reasons, does the discourse seem to me to point out to us respecting the music of choirs, that those who are fifty years old, and for whom it is suited to sing, ought to be better instructed (than the others).
4
For they must neces­ sarily possess a proper sensation and knowledge of rhythms and harmonies.
Or how shall any one know the rectitude of melodies, and for what the Doric5 harmony is proper or im­ proper, and of rhythm, which the poet has united to it, whether it is right, or not ?
Clin.
It is evident he cannot by any means.
Athen.
But the numerous common people are ridiculous in thinking that they sufficiently know what is well harmonized, and in proper rhythm, and what is not so;
such (at least) as have been compelled to sing and walk in rhythm.
But as they do each of these things ignorantly, they do not reason upon them.
Now every melody, when it has what is fitting, is in a proper state;
but (when it has) what is not fitting, it is in an erring one.
Clin.
Most necessarily so.
Athen.
What then, will the person, not knowing what it possesses, know, as we have said,' how it is in a proper state in any way and at any time ?
Clin.
What plan is there (for so doing) ?[12.]
A then.
This then, as it appears, we have now again discovered, that those singers, whom we are now calling upon, and, after a fashion, compel to sing voluntarily, ought from necessity to be disciplined thus far, as to be able each of them to follow the progressions of the rhythms, and the chords of the melodies, in order that, by perceiving the harmonies and the rhythms, they may be able to choose such as are fit to be sung by persons of such an age, and of such a kind, and who may sing thus, and by singing may themselves be immediately in­ nocently delighted, and become the leaders to an adoption of good manners, suited to younger persons;
and being edu­ cated to this point, they would take into their hands a share of that more accurate discipline, which has reference to the multitude, and is conversant about poets themselves.
For, it is by no means necessary for a composer to know the third point, whether the imitation is beautiful or not.
But it is nearly necessary (to know) that which relates to harmony and rhythm ;
but for those (the elders) to know all the three, for the sake of choosing the most beautiful, and the second, or else never to become a sufficient enchanter of young persons towards the acquisition of virtue.
And thus, what our discourse intended at the beginning, namely to exhibit a well-spoken support in favour of the choir of Bacchus, it has spoken to the best of our power.
But let us consider whether this has taken place in this manner.
For such an assembly does of necessity ever happen to become tumultuous through the drinking going for­ ward to a higher point, as we supposed at the beginning of our discourse it would necessarily do, 2 as regards those of the present time.
2Clin.
It is necessary it should.
Athen.
And every one becoming lighter than himself is elevated and joyous, and is filled with a freedom of speech, and with the not-listening at such a time to his neighbour, but considers himself sufficient to have a command over himself and the rest.
Clin.
Certainly.
Athen.
Did we not say, that, when this takes place, the souls of the drinkers, becoming warmed, are rendered, like iron, more soft and juvenile ?
so that they are easily led by a person able and knowing how to instruct and mould them, as when they were young, and that this moulder is the same as he, who was then said to be a good lawgiver, from whom there ought to be laws for convivial drinking, competent (to restrain) 1 the per­ son who had become full of confidence and bold and more impudent than is proper, and unwilling to endure a regula­ tion, and the turn for silence and talking and drinking and music;
(and so to instruct him,)2 that he is willing to do every thing the contrary to those acts;
and (laws) also com­ petent to send, together with justice, a fear the most honour­ able, which is to fight against a confidence not honourable, whilst it is advancing;
which divine fear we have denominated modesty and shame.
Clin.
It is so.
Athen.
[And we said] that there are guardians and fellow­ fabricators of these laws, the cool and sober leaders of those not sober;
without whom it is more difficult to fight against drunkenness than against enemies without cool leaders;
and that the person 3unable to be willing 3 to obey these and the leaders of Dionysus, upwards of sixty years old, suffers an equal or even 4 a greater disgrace than the person, who dis­ obeys the leaders of Mars.
Clin.
Right.
Athen.
If then there were such drunkenness and such sport, such fellow-drinkers, by being benefited and friends more than before, would not be separated from each other, nor enemies as at present;
but having formed their whole association according to law, they would follow, whenever the sober should 1 come and lead 1 the not sober.
Clin.
Certainly;
if the (sport) were such as you now speak of.[13.]
A then.
Let us then not blame that part of the gift of Bacchus simply, that it is an evil, and not worthy to be received into a state.
For one might go on and say much more still, since3 it is the greatest blessing which he gives.
4
There is a fear of speaking before the many, through men improperly taking it up, and knowing it when spoken.
4Clin.
What is that good ?
Athen.
A certain tale and rumour is somehow floating se­ cretly, that this god had the intellect of his mind5 scattered by his step-mother Juno ;
6 on which account he did, to avenge himself, introduce the Bacchic rites, and the whole of the mad choir;
from whence he gave for this purpose likewise wine.
But things of this kind I leave for those to say, who think they can assert them with safety respecting the gods.
But thus much I know, that every animal is not born with such and so much intelligence as is suited to it, when per­ fectly grown;
but that, during the time in which it has not yet obtained its proper intelligence, every animal is mad, and cries out in no order;
and 1 when any one slays it rapidly, it again leaps without order.
1
But let us recollect that we said these were the principles of the musical and gymnastic arts.
Clin.
We recollect it.
How not?
Athen.
And did we not say too, that this principle imparted to us men the sense of rhythm and harmony, and that Apollo, the Muses, and Dionysus were the causes of gods ?1Clin.
Certainly.
Athen.
And wine too, it seems, the account of the others says, was given as a punishment for men, in order that we might become mad.
But what has been now stated by us shows, on the contrary, that it was given as a medicine, for the sake of the soul acquiring shame, and the body health and strength.
Clin.
You have brought, very beautifully, 0 guest, the story to our recollection.
Athen.
And now let the half of the subject respecting the choir be held to be gone through.
Shall we go through the (other) half, how it seems to be, or omit it ?
Clin.
What parts are you speaking of;
and how do you divide each of them ?
Athen.
The whole of the choir was with us the whole of education.
But of this one part consists in rhythms and harmonies according to the voice.
Clin. Certainly.
Athen.
But the other, according to the movement of the body, had a rhythm in common with the movement of the voice, but a figure peculiar to itself;
but there (in the former part) melody is the movement of the voice.
Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
The things then pertaining to the voice, (and ex­ tending) as far as the soul, for the discipline of virtue, we have, I know not after what manner, denominated music.
Clin.
They were rightly called so.
Athen.
But the things pertaining to the body, which we called a dancing of those in sport, if such a movement should extend as far as the virtue of the body, we denominated the artistic leading of it to a thing of this kind, the gymnastic art.
Clin.
Most rightly.
Athen.
1
Let then that portion of the musical art, which we havejust now said we have gone through, as the half of dancing, and has been brought to an end, be held to have been spoken of.'
But of the other half shall we speak ?
Or, in what man­ ner and by what road must we proceed ?
Clin. 0 thou most excellent man, who art conversing with Cretans and Lacedæmonians, (say,) since we have gone through the subject relating to the musical art, but are deficient in that relating to the gymnastic, what do you think either of us ought to reply to this question ?
Athen.
I would say that you have by putting this question nearly answered it clearly;
and I understand that this, although a question, is for the present, as I have said, both an answer, and moreover a command to go through the points relating to the gymnastic art.
Clin.
You understand me excellently well;
and now act in this way.
Athen.
And act I must;
for it is not very difficult to speak about things known to both of you ;
for in this very art you have a greater share of skill than in that (of music).
Clin.
You speak nearly the truth.[14.]
Athen.
Is not then the principle of this very sport, that every animal is naturally accustomed to leap ?
But man, as we have said, receiving a sense of rhythm, has begotten and brought forth dancing;
1 but melody, putting him in mind of, and exciting, rhythm,1 these two have, by their connexion with each other, brought forth dancing and sport.
Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
One portion of this, we say, we have already gone through;
but the other we will endeavour to go through in in order.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
Let us then first put a Colophon2 (finish) to the use of drunkenness, if it seems good to you likewise.
Clin. 4
Of what kind of person, and whom4 are you speaking?
Athen.
If any state shall make use of 5the pursuit lately men­ tioned, as being a serious thing,5 by law and with order, 6 em­ ploying it as an exercise6 in behalf of temperance, and shall not keep itself from the rest of pleasures, in like manner, and for the same reason, by devising a plan for the sake of subduing them, after this manner it may use all these.
But (if it uses them) as a sport, and it shall be lawful for any one to drink, both when he pleases, and with whom he pleases, in combination with any other pursuit whatever, I would not give my vote in this way, that it is meet for that state, or that individual to make use at any time of drunkenness;
but I would give it much more to the law of the Carthaginians than to the custom of the Cretans and Lacedæmonians, namely, that no one, when in camp, is to taste of that drink, but to exist upon water during all that period;
and that in the city neither a male or female slave should ever taste it, nor magistrates during the year of their office, nor pilots, nor judges, engaged in business, should taste wine at all;
nor any one, who goes to any council to deliberate upon any matter of moment, neither in the day-time at all, unless for the sake of bodily exercise or disease;
nor at night, when any man, or even a woman, are thinking of begetting children.
And many other cases a person might mention, in which wine ought not to be drunk by those, who possess a mind and correct laws;
so that, according to this reasoning, there is to no state any need of many vineyards,' but other kinds of field-works should be ordained, and the whole of diet:
but those relating to wine should be nearly of all the most moderate in kind and the least in number.
And let this, if it seems good to you, 0 guests, be held to be said as the Colophon to the discourse relating to wine.
Clin.
It is beautifully (said), and it does seem good to us.[1.]
2THUS much then on this point.
But shall we say what was the commencement of civil government ?
Would not any one see it from hence in the easiest and best manner ?
Clin.
From whence ?
Athen.
From whence he might behold the progress of states marching3 continually to virtue and to vice.
Clin.
From whence do you say ?
Athen.
I conceive, from a length and infinity4 of time, and from the mutations in it.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
Come (tell me), do you seem to have ever conceived what a length of time has elapsed, since cities and 1 men have been formed into polities ?1Clin.
This is by no means easy.
2Athen.
It would however be something endless, and im­ possible (to be told).
Clin.
Yes, this very much so.
Athen.
Have not myriads upon myriads of states ex­ isted during this period ?
and, 3through the same ratio of the length (of time)3 have there not been destroyed no fewer in number ?
and have they not every where been often under every kind of polity ?
and at one time become greater from less, and at another less from greater, and worse from better, and better from worse ?
Clin.
It is necessary.
Athen.
Let us then lay hold, if we can, of the cause of this change;
for perhaps it would show us the first birth of polities, and their altered statedClin.
You speak well.
It is then necessary for you to be ready to show, what you are thinking about them, and for us to follow.
Athen.
Do the stories of old truth ?
appear to you to possess anyAthen.
That there have been frequent destructions of the human race through deluges and diseases and many other events, in which some small family of mankind was left.
Clin.
Every thing of this kind must be very probable to every one.
Athen.
Come then, let us consider one (of these destructions) out of many, (namely) that which took place through a de­ luge.
Clin.
Considering what about it ?
Athen.
That those, who then escaped the destruction, were nearly some1 hill-shepherds, preserved on the tops (of moun­ tains),2 like some slight fire-preserving (embers) of the human race.
Clin.
It is evidently so.
A then.
Now such as these must surely of necessity have been ignorant of the rest of the arts and contrivance of those in cities towards each other, with respect to cupidity and a love of quarrel, 3 and whatever other deeds of ill they had in their thoughts against each other.
3
Clin.
It is likely.
Athen.
Let us suppose then that the inhabited cities, which were in the plains and on the sea-coast, were at that time entirely destroyed.
Clin.
Let us suppose it.
Athen.
Shall we not say then, that all instruments were destroyed, and that, if any thing connected with art, either in politics or any other wisdom, had been carefully discovered, all such were lost at that period ?
Clin.
For how, 0 most excellent man, if these things had remained through the whole time, as they are placed in order at present, could any thing new whatever have been invented by any one whatever?
4 5 Because ten thousand times ten thousand years lay hid from persons then.
5
But there have been a thousand or twice as many years, since some things have been made known by Dædalus, others by Orpheus, and others by Palamedes;
while those relating to music have become so by Marsyas and Olympus, and, as regards the lyre, by Am­ phion ;
and very many other things by others, so to say, but yesterday and the day before.
Athen.
Know you not, Clinias, that you have omitted your friend, who was really of yesterday ?
Clin.
Do you mean Epimenides ?A then.
Yes, him.
For he has leaped far over all amongst you in his contrivance, which Hesiod had formerly, my friend, divined in word, but he has in reality accomplished, as ye assert.
Clin.
We do assert it.[2.]
Athen.
Let us then assert, that, when that destruction took place, human affairs had then a solitude1 infinitely ter­ rible;
that there was a very great part of the earth ungrudged ;
2 and that the other animals having perished, there were some herds of oxen, and a race of goats, if perchance it happened to have survived, 3 and these too rare to live for those feeding then at the commencement.
3Athen.
But of a state, and polity, and legislation, to which our conversation has now turned,4 do we think there was any, so to say, any recollection at all ?
Clin.
By no means.
Athen.
From those people then so situated all the present things did not arise, namely, cities and polities and arts and laws and much of vice and much of virtue.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
Think we, 0 wonderful man, that the persons of that time, who were inexperienced in many beautiful things relating to cities,1 and many too of a contrary kind, had be­ come perfect as regards either virtue or vice ?
Clin.
You speak well, and we understand what you say.
Athen.
As time then went on, and our race multiplied, all things advanced to [all] 2 their present state.
Clin.
Most right.
Athen.
But, as is probable, not suddenly, but by little, during some very long period.
Clin.
And this too is very likely.
Athen.
For there was a fear, I think, tingling3 in all, of coming down from their high ground to the plain.
Athen.
Did they not with delight behold each other, through the fewness 4 in things about that time?
4
For the means of going to each other at that period by land or sea, were nearly all, so to say, lost together with the arts;
hence it was not, I think,5 very possible for them to mingle with each other.
For iron and brass and all metals had disap­ peared confused together;
so that there was every want of means for them to be purified,6 and they had a scarcity (of means) in felling timber.
For if any instrument had by chance been preserved in the mountains, these had by rapidly wearing away disappeared;
and no others were about to be made, before the art of metallurgy had returned again to man.
Clin.
How could it ?
Athen.
But in how many generations afterwards think we did this take place ?
Clin.
It is evident, in a great many.
Athen.
Would not then the arts that require iron and brass, and all things of that kind, have disappeared for the same and even a longer time at that period ?
Athen.
Dissension then together with war was at that time dead every where.
'Athen.
In the first place, they loved and had a friendly feel­ ing towards each other, on account of their solitude ;
and then their food was not an object of contention;
for of pastures there was no scarcity-except perhaps to some at the begin­ ning—on which they lived for the most part at that time;
for they were not at all in want of milk and flesh;
and be­ sides, by hunting they obtained food, neither indifferent (in kind) nor little (in quantity).
Moreover, they had plenty of clothing, and beds, and dwellings, and utensils, for fire or not.
For the earth-moulding and weaving arts did not require iron at all.
And 2a god gave to man these arts to procure all those things,2 in order that, when at any time they might fall into a difficulty of this kind, 3the race of man might have a shoot­ ing up and an improvement.
3
Through some such means persons at that time were not very poor, nor had they, com­ pelled by poverty, any differences with each other.
But neither would they ever have become rich, being without sil­ ver and gold, 4 which was then present in them.
4
Now in any association, where neither riches nor poverty dwell, in this manners nearly the most just will exist.
For neither inso- lence nor injustice, neither emulation nor envy, are produced there.
Through these causes, and their so-called simplicity, they were good.
For whatever they heard to be beautiful or base, they thought, through being of simple manners, it was said so most truly, and were persuaded.
For no one, through his wisdom, knew to suspect an untruth, as at present;
but, conceiving all that was said about gods and men to be true, they lived in this manner;
and hence they were altogether such, as we have just now described them.
Clin. Both to me and to this person here such seems to be the case.[3.]
Athen.
Shall we then not assert,' that many genera­ tions, both of those prior to the deluge and of those at present living in this manner, are likely to be less skilful and less learned as regards the other arts, and those too of war, such as exist at present by land and sea;
and such, as in the case of a city being called only there2 law-trials and seditions, contrive both by words and deeds every plan for doing evil and injustice towards each other ?
but that they were more simple and brave, and at the same time more temperate, and in every respect more just?
Now of these things we have already detailed the cause.
Clin.
You speak correctly.
Athen.
Let then this be held to have been said by us ;
and let all that still follows upon this be said for the sake of un­ derstanding what need of laws there was to persons of that period, and who was their lawgiver.
Clin.
You have spoken well.
Athen.
Were they then neither in want of legislators, nor was there wont to be any matter of such a kind at that time ?
For surely to those existing at that portion of the period there were not writings, but they lived following the customs and the spoken3 laws of their ancestors.
1 Clin.
It is probable.
But the manner of their polity do you know well what it was ?
Athen.
This.
Athen.
All appear to me to call the polity subsisting at that period, a dynasty, which even now exists in many places, both amongst the Greeks and Barbarians.
And even Homer speaks some where of it as taking place in the administration of the Cyclόpes, saying, (Od. ix. 12,)" Meetings, that counsel bring, to them are not, Nor legal judges.
On the high hill-tops
They dwell, or in the hollow cave;
and each To wife and children gives the law, nor care Aught have they of each other.
"Clin.
This poet of yours appears to have been a graceful one ;
for we have gone through some other pieces of his, very clever, but not many of them ;
for we Cretans do not make a very great use of foreign poems.
Megil.
But we do on the other hand make use of them.
And he seems to excel poets of this kind ;
although he does not de­ scribe every where a Laconic, but rather an Ionic, life.
At present indeed he appears to testify fairly to your language, mythologically referring the ancient state of mankind2 to a savage life.
Athen.
So he does testify ;
and let us receive him, as point­ ing out that polities of this kind did once upon a time exist.
Clin. Well (said).
Athen.
Is it not then from those, who were dispersed by single families and races through the want arising from those destructions, amongst whom the oldest bears sway on account of the authority having come from the father and mother, that following them, as birds3 do, persons will form one herd, and under their fathers' laws be governed by kingly rule, which is the most just of all ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
And after this, more of them come together to a common spot, and form larger cities ;
and betaking themselves to agriculture, first at the foot of hills they make certain en­ closures of thorns, as defensive walls against wild beasts, and thus establish one common and large dwelling.
Clin.
It is probable that this occurs.
Athen.
But is not this also probable ?
Athen.
That, while these larger dwellings are increasing from the less and original ones, each of the small would re­ main,1 having, according to the race, the oldest person as its ruler, and, through living separate from each other, its own peculiar customs, and different from different parents and bringers-up, and which have been accustomed to be, as regards the gods and themselves, the more modest in the case of the more modest, and more manly in that of the more manly ;
and thus according to reason, each one, after stamping his own edicts 2 on his children and children's children, would come, as we said, to the greater community, bringing their own peculiar laws.
A then.
Moreover it is surely necessary for each to be pleased with their own laws (first),3 and afterwards with those of the others.
Clin.
It is so.
Athen.
We appear then to be unconsciously walking, as it were, in the commencement of legislation.
Clin. Entirely so.[4.]
Athen.
After this then, it is necessary for those, who thus come together to choose some among themselves in com- mon, who, after inspecting the laws of all, shall lay open such of them as they most approve of in common before the rulers and leaders of the wards,' as before kings, and enable them to make a choice ;
and these would be called legislators;
and after appointing their magistrates and making out of the dynasties an aristocratical or kingly government, they would dwell in such a change of polity.
Clin.
This would in this way take place in due order.
Athen.
Let us then speak of a third form of polity as occur­ ring, in which all the forms and accidents of polities and at the same time of cities happen to exist together.
CUn.
Of what kind is this ?
Athen.
That, which Homer likewise has pointed out, as having taken the third place after the second (II. xx. 216). " He built Dardania;
for Ilion holy Was in the plain, not yet a city made For voice-dividing men;
but still they dwelt Below Mount Ida with its many rills.
For he pronounces these verses, and those which he said re­ specting the Cyclopes, as having been spoken somehow di­ vinely and naturally.
For the race of poets being divine does enthusiastically2 handle the hymnings on many events which have truly happened, in conjunction with some of the Graces and Muses.
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
Let us then now proceed onwards, 3 a fable having just now come upon us ;
3 for, perhaps, it will make some sign respecting our wishes.
4
Is it not proper ?
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
We say 1 then that Ilion was colonized down from elevated places to a large and beautiful plain, upon a hill not very lofty, and having many rivers which rush from Mount Ida.
Clin.
So they say.
A then.
Do we not think that this occurred at some long time after the deluge ?
Clin.
How not a long time ?
A then.
A dreadful oblivion then it seems has taken place of the destruction just mentioned, since they thus placed a city under rivers many and flowing from high ground, and put their trust in hills not very high.
Clin.
It is then quite evident that they were distant some considerable time from that event.
A then.
And many other cities, I think, were at that time inhabited as mankind multiplied.
Athen.
And these perchance fought against it;
and per­ haps by sea, all of them now fearlessly using the sea.
Clin.
It appears so.
A then.
But the Achasans, after remaining ten years, over­ threw Troy.
Megil.
Entirely.
A then.
During then that period of ten years, in which Troy was besieged, the affairs of the besiegers happened to each of them to turn out very ill at home through the seditions of the young men, who received the commanders, when returning to their cities and homes, neither in a becoming nor just manner, but so that deaths 2 and murders and very many banishments occurred to those, who, after being exiled, returned with a change of name, and were called Doriens instead of Achæ­ ans, through Dorieus being the person who collected together the exiles of that period.
And hence you Lacedæmonians turn all these things into a fable, and go through them.[5.]
A then.
To the same point from whence, while discours­ ing at the commencement about laws, we turned aside through falling upon music and drunkenness, we have now arrived again, as it were, through some god ;
and our discourse gives us, as it were, a handle.
For it has come to the colonization of Lace­ dæmon, which you said was properly governed by laws fra­ ternal to those in Crete.
For the present then we obtain something additional to this extent from the wandering of our discourse, while passing through certain polities and coloni­ zations.
For we behold a first, a second, and a third city connected with each other, as we think, by their colonizations during a boundless length of time.
But now this fourth city, or, if you please, nation, presents itself to us, 1 which was formerly colonized, and is so now.
1
From all which, if we are able to understand what has been colonized well or not, and what laws of theirs preserve, what is preserved, and what corrupt, what is corrupted, and what being changed for what will render, Megillus and Clinias, a state happy, 2 (we shall think that enough has been done).
2
But all these matters must be discussed by us, as if from the beginning, unless we have any fault to find with what has been said.
Megil.
If, 0 guest, a god had promised us that.
if we put our hands a second time to the inquiry respecting legislation, we should hear discourses neither worse nor fewer than those already spoken, I would go a long road, and the present day would appear to me to be short, although it is nearly that of the god, when he is turning from the summer to the winter (solstice).
Athen.
It is meet then, as it seems, to consider these mat­ ters.
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Let us then be present in thought at that time, when Lacedæmon, and Argos, and Messéné, and the places which with them were, Megillus, under the power of your ancestors.
3
For then, it is said, (according to) the story,3 that after having divided their army into three parts, they colonized three cities, Argos, Messéné, and Lacedæmon.
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
And Temenus became king of Argos, and Cresphontes of Messéné, but Procles and Eurysthenes of Lacedæmon.
Athen.
Now, all of those then (present) swore to assist them, if any one should destroy their kingly rule.
A then.
Now (say), by Zeus, is kingly rule destroyed, or has any government whatever been destroyed by other parties than by themselves ?
Or after having just now 1 [a little be­ fore] 1 met with these words, did we suppose so, but have now forgotten it ?
Athen.
Now then, we will more confirm this kind (of as­ sertion).
For meeting with deeds, as it seems, which have occurred, we have arrived at the same discourse;
so that we shall not seek the same discourse respecting a vain thing, but one that has occurred and possesses truth.
Now this has oc­ curred.
Three kingdoms have made an oath with three cities under a kingly government, each with each other, according to the laws which they had laid down, about governing and being governed in common, that one party (the rulers) should not make for itself a government of violence, as time and race progressed, and the other, (the ruled,) that, while the rulers observed these (oonditions), they would not at any time them­ selves destroy the kingly rule, nor permit others to destroy it, but that the kings would defend both kings and the people when injured, and the people, both kings and the people.
Was it not so ?
Megil.
It was so.
Athen.
Was not then that, which is of the greatest moment in the establishments of polities, present to these three2 cities, regulated by law, whether the kings laid down the laws, or some other person ?.egil.
What was this ?
Athen.
That two cities should always assist1 against the one, which happened to be disobedient to the laws laid down.
Megil.
It is evident.
Athen.
And yet this do the many order the lawgivers, that they are to lay down such laws as the wards and the masses will willingly receive ;
just as if any one should order the ex­ ercise-masters, or physicians, to take care of, and cure, the bodies under their direction in an agreeable manner.
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
It is however often a desirable thing, should any one with no great pain be able to render bodies of a good habit and in health.
A then.
This too, which is not a small matter towards making easy the laying down of laws, was present to those of that period.
Megil.
What was that ?[6.]
Athen.
There was not to the lawgivers, while prepar­ ing an equality of property, the greatest blame, and which exists in many other cities regulated by laws, when any one endeavours to disturb the possession of land, or to wipe out2 debts, through perceiving that equality can never sufficiently exist without such measures.
For to the lawgiver, who en­ deavours to disturb any thing of this kind, every one on meet­ ing cries out, Do not move things to be not moved;
3 and utters curses upon him, who introduces the distributions of land, and the cutting off debts, so that every man is thrown into a difficulty.
4
But to the Dorians even this hap­ pened successfully and without any finding fault, that both the land was divided without causing disputes, and the debts were not large and of long standing.
4Athen.
How then, ye best of men, did the colonization and legislation turn out so badly to them ?
Megil.
How do you mean ?
and for what do you blame them ?
Athen.
That when three administrations had been estab­ lished, two parts of them quickly corrupted their polity and laws, and one alone, belonging to your city, remained.
Megil.
You ask a question not very easy (to answer).
Athen.
And yet it is requisite for us, while considering now and examining into laws, and playing a game suited to old men temperately,1 to go through the journey without annoy­ ance, as we stated, when we began to enter upon it.
Megil.
How not ?
and we must do as you say.
Athen.
What inquiry can we make to ourselves relating to laws (in general), more beautiful than respecting those (indi­ vidually) which have adorned cities of this kind ?2 or shall we make an inquiry about any cities and colonizations more illustrious and larger than these ?
Megil.
It is not easy to speak of others in preference to these.
Athen.
It is then nearly evident, that the persons of that period conceived this arrangement would be an assistance suf­ ficient not only for the Peloponnesus, but for all the Greeks, if any of the Barbarians should do it any injury;
3just as those, who dwelt then about Ilion, were, when trusting to the power of the Assyrians, as it existed in the time of Ninus, emboldened to excite war against Troy.
3
For the showy appearance1 of its government, still preserved, was by no means small.
(And) as we at present fear the great king, so the people then feared the combination (of power) standing together.
For the taking of Troy a second time became a great accusation against them ;
because the Trojan power was a portion of that (the Assyrian) government.
On all these accounts then, the unity of the arrangement of the army at that time, divided into three states, under the brother kings, the offspring of Hercules, appeared surely2 to be beautifully planned and put into order, and superior to that which went against Troy.
For, first, they conceived that the descend­ ants of Hercules were better commanders than those sprung from Pelops ;
and, next, that this army far surpassed in valour that which came against Troy;
for that these were the victors, but those vanquished3 by these, the Achæans by the Doriens.
Do we not then conceive, that the persons of that period made their arrangements with this very view ?
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Is it not probable then, that they thought their affairs would be in a firm state, and endure for some length­ ened period, through their having shared in many dangers and labours, and in being orderly governed by one race of brother kings ;
and in addition to this, through having made use of many other prophets, and the Delphic Apollo likewise ?
Megil.
How is it not probable ?
Athen.
But all these expectations so great flew away, as it seems, at that time quickly, except, as we just now said, a small part around your region;
and this has never ceased warring against the two other parts, even to the present day.
4
Since the policy then 1existing would,1 by agreeing for one object, have possessed a power in war not to be overturned.[7.]
Athen.
How then, and why was it dissolved ?
Is it not worth while to consider, what accident destroyed a con­ stitution of such a standing, and of such a kind ?
Megil.
Scarcely2 would any one, looking elsewhere,3 be­ hold either laws or other polities, conservative of doings beautiful and great, or on the contrary destructive of them, if he neglects these.
5Athen.
It seems, then, we have by some good fortune come upon a sufficient consideration of this question.
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Do not, then, all persons, thou wondrous man, and we too at the present moment, unconsciously fancy perpetually that they see some beautiful thing existing, and which would effect wonders, if a person knew how to use it properly.
But now we should ourselves, perhaps, neither think correctly about it, nor according to nature;
and moreover all men (err) 6 re­ specting all the other things about which they think in a similar manner.
Megil.
What do you mean ?
and about what especially shall we say this speech has been spoken ?
Athen.
My good man, I have been just now laughing at myself.
For upon looking to that very expedition about which we have been conversing, it appeared to me to be very beautiful, and that a wonderful possession would have fallen accidentally to the Greeks, if, as I said, any one had at that time made a proper use of it.
Megil.
Did you not say all correctly and with a fixed mind;
and did not we properly praise them ?
Athen.
Perhaps so.
But I think that every one, who be­ holds any thing great, and having much power and strength, has immediately this feeling, that if he knew as its possessor how to use it, being of such a kind, and such an age, he would do many and wonderful things, and be happy.
Megil.
Is not this correct ?
or how say you ?
Athen.
Consider now, by looking to what does he, who gives this praise to each thing, speak correctly.
Now first, as regards what has been said just now, how would the persons of that period, even if they had known how to draw up an army properly, have, by a complete marshalling, met with 1the op­ portunity somehow ?
1
Would it not have been, had they put it together securely, and preserved it 2 for ever, so that they might be free themselves, and rule over others whom they pleased, and do 3 in short, both themselves and their descend­ ants amongst all men, both Greeks and Barbarians, whatever they desired?
Would they not for the sake of these things have felt a desire ?
4Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Has not he too, who, on seeing great wealth, or su­ perior honours arising from a family, or any thing else of this kind, would have said the very same thing, said so, looking to this, as if through this there would come to him all he de­ sires, or the greater part of them, and such as are the most worthy of mention ?
Megil.
It appears so.
Athen.
5
But there is certainly one common desire to all men, which is signified by our present discourse.5.egil.
What is it ?
Athen.
That the things which do take place, should take place at the command of his own soul, all for the most part, but, if not (all), at least human affairs.
Athen.
Since then all of us when children, and men, and grown old, perpetually wish a thing of this kind, we should of necessity1 pray for that very thing to the end (of life).
Athen.
And we would pray for our friends that which they do for themselves.
Athen.
Now a son, being a boy, is a friend of his father, being a man.
Athen.
And yet many of the things which the boy prays may happen to himself, the father would pray the gods that they may not happen according to the prayers of his son.
Megil.
When, you mean, (the son) prays, being thought­ less and still young.
Athen.
Yes ;
and when the father, being old, or with very youthful feelings, shall, although he knows nothing of what is honourable and just, offer up a prayer with great fervour in the midst of sufferings, akin to those that happened to Theseus, in the case of the unfortunate Hippolytus, when dying, will the boy, think you, who does know, join in prayer with his father?
Megil.
I understand what you mean.
For you appear to me to assert, that a person ought not to pray, nor be urgent for all things to follow his wishes, but for wishes rather2 (to fol­ low) his prudence;
and that both a state and each of us ought to pray for and hasten to this, how to possess intellect.[8.]
Atlten.
Certainly.
And, moreover, that the statesman (and 3) lawgiver ought always to lay down the ordinances of your recollection, what, if we remember,1 was said, at the com­ mencement, that it was your advice, that a good lawgiver ought to lay down all laws for the sake of war;
but it was mine, that this would enjoin him to make laws for one virtue out of four existing;
that he ought to look to every virtue, but especially the first, which is the leader of the whole of virtue, and that is prudence, and intellect and opinion together, with love and desire attendant on them.
But our discourse has now re­ turned again to the same point;
and I now say again, what I then said in jest, if you please, or in earnest, 2 that I assert then,2 that it is dangerous for a person not possessing intellect to pray;
but that (it is better3) for the contrary to his wishes to happen to him.
If you are willing to suppose that I am in earnest,4 suppose it.
For I now fully expect to find you following the reasoning we produced a little before, that timidity was not the cause of the destruction of kings, and of the whole of their policy;
nor was it because the rulers and they, whom it was meet to be ruled, did not know what re­ lates to war;
5 but they were destroyed by all the remaining de­ pravity,5 and especially by their ignorance respecting the great­ est of human affairs.
That these things thus happened at that time, 6and (must so happen) now, if they happen any where,6 and will hereafter happen not otherwise, I will en- deavour, if you wish it, to find out, by proceeding according to a discourse in due order, and to show, as far as I can, to you, who are my friends.
Clin.
To praise you, guest, in words, would be rather of­ fensive;
but we shall mightily praise you in deed.
For we shall cheerfully follow what is said, by which (acts) he, who praises as a free-man or not, is most apparent.
Athen.
You speak most excellently, Clinias;
and let us do as you say.
Clin.
These things will be so, if god pleases.
Only speak.[9.]
Athen.
We say then, proceeding along the still remain­ ing road of our discourse, that the greatest ignorance destroyed that power at that time, and that it is naturally able to do the same thing now.
So that, if this be the case, the lawgiver must endeavour, as far as he can, to infuse prudence into states, and destroy to the utmost thoughtlessness.
1Clin.
It is evident.
Athen.
What then may be justly called the greatest ignor­ ance?
Consider whether you agree with me 2 in what I am going to say.
2
For I lay it down to be such as this.
Clin.
Of what kind?
A then.
When any one does not love, but hates that, which seems to him to be beautiful, or good;
but loves and embraces that, which appears to him to be base and unjust, I assert that this discordance, respecting pain and pleasure, with opinion founded on reason, is the extreme of ignorance;
and it is the greatest, because it belongs to the mass of the soul.
For that part of the soul, which feels pain and pleasure, is what the common people and the mass are in a city.
When, therefore, it is opposed to science, or opinions, or reason, the natural rulers, I call this ignorance;
and it is the same as that of a city, when the multitude will not obey the rulers and the laws;
and likewise in the case of one man, when although beautiful reasons reside in his soul, yet they do not produce any good effect, but every thing, the contrary.
All these kinds of ignorance I would lay down as the most inordinate, in the case of a state and each individual citizen, but not as applied to handicraftmen, if, guests, you understand what I mean.
Cin.
We do understand you, friend, and assent to what you say.
Athen.
Let this then be laid down as determined upon, and said, that to citizens, who are after this manner ignorant, no­ thing connected with government is to be committed, but they are to be reproached as ignorant, even though they are very skil ul in argument, and have laboured at all that is elegant (in language), and whatever relates to a quickness of intellect;
but that those, who possess qualities contrary to these, are to be called wise, although they should, according to the saying, 2know neither their letters, nor how to swim,2 and that power is tobe given to them as being prudent persons.
For how, friends, can the smallest form of prudence subsist without symphony ?
It is not possible.
4
But the most beautiful and greatest of symphonies may be most justly called the greatest wisdom;
of which he participates, who lives according to reason;
but he, who is deficient, is a family-destroyer, and in no respect a saviour as regards the city, but, quite the contrary, he will appear to be always ignorant on these points.
Let this then, as I just now said, be laid down, as having been spoken of in this manner.
Clin.
Let it be laid down.[10.]
Athen.
But it is surely necessary for rulers and ruled to exist in states.
Athen.
Be it so.
But of what kind, and how many, are the axioms5 respecting the ruling and being ruled in the case of great and small states, and similarly in that of families ?
Is there not one relating to a father and mother ?
and universally would it not be a correct axiom every where that parents should rule over their offspring ?
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
And the next to this, that men of high birth should rule over those of low birth ?
and the third, that the more aged should rule, and the younger be ruled ?
Athen.
And the fourth, that slaves should be ruled, and their owners rule ?
Athen.
And the fifth, I think, that the better person should rule, and the worse be ruled ?
Clin.
You speak of a ruling very necessary indeed.
Athen.
And one that exists the most in all animals, and is " according to nature,”1 as the Theban [Pindar] says.
But the greatest axiom, as it seems, would be the sixth, which commands the ignorant to follow, but the prudent to lead and rule.
And yet, 0 thou most wise Pindar, I should almost say, that this at least is not contrary to nature, but according to it, for the rule of law to be over willing (subjects), and not by an act of violence.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.
A then.
Let us then in speaking of the seventh rule, as being god-loved and fortunate, bring2 it to a lot-drawing, and say, that he, on whom the lot falls, is most justly the ruler, but he the ruled, who goes away, after being unsuccessful in the lot.
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
We will say then, playing with some one of those who go on with facility to the laying down of laws—Dost thou, 0 lawgiver, see how many axioms there are relating to rulers, and how they are naturally contrary to each other ?
For now we have discovered a certain fountain of seditions, to which it is necessary for you to attend.
First, consider with us, by erring how and in what point, contrary to these axioms, did the kings of Argos and Messéné destroy themselves, and the power of the Greeks, which at that time was wonderful.
Was it not through their not knowing that Hesiod had said most truly, that the half is often more than the whole?”1 (For), when to receive the whole brings a damage, but in the half is moderation, he held in that case the moderate to be more than the immoderate, as being better than the worse.
Clin.
Most correctly so.
Athen.
But whether think we that this, when it occurs, de­ stroys on each occasion what2 relates to kings before what exists amongst the people ?
Clin.
It is probable that this is mostly the disease of kings, who live proudly in luxury.
Athen.
Is not this evident then, in the first place, that the kings of that time had a power above the established laws ? 3 and (as) to what they had praised both by word and an oath, they did not accord with themselves.
3
But discordance, as we have said,4 being the greatest ignorance, although appear­ in-;
to be wisdom, has destroyed all those things through5 error and a sad want of education.
Clin.
It appears so.
A then.
Be it so.
But why was it meet for the lawgiver then laying down laws to be cautious about the generation of this disease?
6
Is it, by the gods, at the present time, no wisdom to know this, and not difficult to speak of it?
but that, if it had been possible to foresee it then, the person, who foresaw it, would have been wiser than we are ?
Megil.
What kind of thing are you speaking of?
A then.
For a person looking, 0 Megillus, to what has oc­ curred with you, it is easy to know, and, knowing, to state what ought to have occurred then.
Megil.
Speak yet more clearly.
Athen.
Some such thing as this then will be most clear.[11.]
Athen.
If any one gives a power too great to things rather small, by disregarding moderation,-as, for instance, sails to ships, food to bodies, and dominion to dispositions-all things are overturned;
for some, by being full of insolence, run 1 into disorders, and others 2to injustice, the offspring of in so­ lence.
2
What then are we saying ?
Is it not, my friends, of this kind?
that there exists not the nature of a mortal soul, which will be able, when young and not under super­ vision, to bear the greatest rule amongst men, so as, when filled as to its thinking faculty with folly, which is the great­ est disease, not to suffer a hate from his nearest friends;
which, when it takes place, is wont to corrupt quickly, and to cause all its power to disappear.
To be cautious on this point, through knowing moderation, is the province of great law­ givers.
3
Hence what took place at that time, it is now easy to perceive.
3
It appears to have been this.
Athen.
Some god, 4I think, (is) taking care of you;
who, through foreseeing future events, and planting for you the two­ fold generation of kings descended from one, has contracted you rather to a moderate state;
and after this a certain human nature,' mixed up with a certain divine power, did, perceiv­ ing your government to be still in an inflamed state, mingle the temperate power of old age with the self-willed strength of noble birth, and made equal with the power of the kings the vote of twenty-eight2 old men in matters of the greatest moment.
But your third saviour,3 perceiving your govern­ ment swelling with desire and passion, placed upon it the power of the Ephori,4 as a bit, and led it near the power which is chosen by lot.
And by this arrangement the kingly power with you, being mingled with such things as were proper, and possessing moderation, was both preserved itself, and became the cause of preservation to others.
For under the rule of Temenus and Cresphontes, and the lawgivers of that time, 5 if indeed they were lawgivers,5 not even the portion of Aristodemus would have been saved.
For they were not then sufficiently skilled in legislation;
for, (had they been so,)6 they never would have thought to moderate by oaths a youthful spirit, when receiving a power from which it was possible for a tyranny to arise.
But now the deity has shown what kind of government it was and is necessary to be, that is about to continue the longest.
But that these things should be known by us, as I said before, now that they have hap­ pened, is no feat of wisdom.
For from a model already ex­ isting, it is not difficult to see.
7
But if any one had then foreseen these things, and had been able to render govern­ ments moderate, and to form one out of three, he would have preserved all the beautiful conceptions of that time, and nei­ ther the Persian expedition, nor any other, would have come against Greece, through despising us as being of little account.
Clin.
You speak the truth.
Athen.
Hence, Clinias, they defended themselves shame­ fully.
Now by shamefully I mean, not that the persons of that time did not conquer by sea and land, and gain honour­ able victories;
but what I call shameful at that time, I say is this.
In the first place, that, out of those three states, (only) one fought in defence of Greece, but the other two were so miserably corrupted, that one of them (Messéné) prevented Lacedæmon from assisting her, (Greece,) by warring against it with all its strength ;
but the other, which had the first share at that period in the distribution, 1that about Argosy did, when called upon to repel the Barbarian, neither give ear nor assistance.
But by detailing many things that oc­ curred then relating to that war, a person might bring a charge against Greece by no means of a pleasant kind;
nor would he, who should say that Greece defended herself, speak correctly;
since, unless the policy in common of the Atheni­ ans and Lacedæmonians had warded off the slavery coming against them, there would have been mixed together nearly all the races of Greeks with each other, and Barbarians with Greeks, and Greeks with Barbarians ;
just as those, over whom the Persians are now the tyrants, are, after 2 being carried away separately or together, and scattered abroad, made to settle down in a miserable stated This, Clinias and Megillus, is what we have to urge against the men of old, called politicians and legislators, and likewise those of the present day, in order that, by seeking out the causes, we may discover what else besides these ought to have been done, as we say for the present,1 that it is not meet to lay down great or unmixed powers of rule, through considering this, that it is requisite for a state to be free and intellectual, and a friend to itself, and that a legislator ought looking to these points, to lay down laws.
And let us not wonder if, after proposing (other)2 things, we have frequently said that the legislator ought to look to these, while laying down laws, and that what have been proposed do not appear to us to be the same.
But it is proper to infer that, when we say the legislator ought to look to temperance, or prudence, or friendship, our design is not different, but the same;
3 and let not many other expres­ sions of that kind, should they occur, disturb yoU.
3Clin.
We will endeavour to do so by recurring to your reasoning.
4
But for the present explain, 5what you mean by saying with respect to friendship, and liberty, and prudence, that a legislator ought to aim at those objects.5[12.]
Athen.
Hear then now.
There are, as it were, two mothers of polities, from which he, who says that all the rest are produced, will speak correctly.
Now one of these it is right to call a monarchy, but the other a democracy;
and to say that the race of the Persians possess the extreme of the one ;
but we of the other.
Now nearly all the rest are, as I have said, variously formed from these.
6It is proper then, and necessary for (a state)6 to participate in both these, if there is to be freedom and friendship in conjunction with prudence.
Now this our discourse intends to enjoin, by saying that a city is unable to be beautifully governed, while it is destitute of these properties.
Clin.
For how can it ?
Athen.
When therefore the one embraces monarchy alone, but the other liberty more than is proper, neither of them 1 possess what is moderate in these.
1 Your cities however in Laconia and Crete (possess it) more (than others);
and so too did the Athenians and Persians formerly, but now less so.
Shall we go through the causes of this, or not ?
Clin.
By all means, if we wish to bring to an end what we have proposed for ourselves.
Athen.
Let us hear then.
The Persians under Cyrus pos­ sessed2 more of moderation in slavery and freedom.
At first they were free, but afterwards the masters of many others.
For by sharing as rulers their freedom with the ruled, and leading them to an equality, the soldiers became greater friends with their commanders, and conducted themselves with ala­ crity in dangers.
And if any one among them was intelligent and competent to give advice, as the king was not envious, and granted a liberty of speech, and honoured those, who were able to advise any thing, he brought into the midst of all the common power of intellect;
and at that time every thing ex­ hibited an improvement,3 through liberty, and friendship, and a communion of intellect.
Clin.
It appears somehow that what has been stated did so occur.
Athen.
How then was (that government) 4 almost destroyed under Cambyses, and again restored under Darius?
5Are you willing for us, while thinking, to make use, as it were, of divination.
5Clin.
This at least brings our inquiry to the point, whither we have been hastening.
Athen.
Respecting Cyrus, then, I thus divine;
that in other respects he was a good general, and a lover of his country, but that he bad not laid hold at all of a correct education, nor applied his mind to the regulation of his household.
Clin.
How shall we say a thing of this kind ?
A then.
He appears from his youth to have passed his life in the army, and to have committed to women the bringing up of his boys.
Now these brought them up as persons fortunate immediately from their childhood, and born blessed, and in­ digent of nothing of these.
1
Hence they forbade any one to oppose them in any respect, as being 2 sufficiently fortunate ;
2 and compelling every one to praise what was said or done by them, they brought them up 3 being some such.
3Clin.
You have detailed, as it seems, a beautiful education.
Athen.
At least a feminine one, the women princesses having become recently rich, and bringing up the boys, dur­ ing a scarcity of men, through the men not having leisure (to do so) in consequence of wars and many dangers.
Clin.
So goes the story.
Athen.
But their father possessed cattle and sheep and many herds of men, and of many other (animals) ;
but he was ignor­ ant that those, to whom lie was to hand down all these things, were not instructed 4 in his country's trade, which was a rough one, as the Persians were shepherds, the children of a rugged land,4 and competent to render the shepherds very strong, and able to live out of doors, and to be without sleep, and, if re­ quired,5 to become soldiers.
But he disregarded the corruption of education by the so-called happiness of Media, and by his sons being instructed by women and eunuchs;
from whence they became such as it was likely for those to become, who are brought up in luxury1 unreproved.
Upon the death of Cyrus his sons came into the possession (of power), and being full of luxury and without reproof, at first one of them slew the other, through brooking ill an equality;
and subsequently the sur­ vivor (Cambyses) becoming mad through drinking and a want of education, lost his power through the Medes and the then called Eunuch,2 who viewed with contempt his silly conduct.
3
Clin.
These things also are reported, and it seems they somehow happened nearly in this manner.
Athen.
And it is said moreover that the power came again to the Persians through Darius and the seven.
4Athen.
Let us then take a view,5 following out the reason­ in-.
For Darius was not the son of a king, nor brought up in a luxurious manner.
But coming to power, and receiving it,6 he divided it, himself the seventh (sharer), into seven por­ tions, of which there are at present left some small dream -(like)7 remnants, 8and he thought proper to live, laying down laws (and) introducing a kind of equality common (to all);
8 and he bound under law9 the tribute, 10 which Cyrus had promised the Persians, (and) infusing into all the Persians a feeling of interest, he attached to himself the masses in Persia, by money and gifts.
1
His armies therefore did with a good will add countries to his power 1 not less in number than what Cyrus had left.
After Darius (came) Xerxes, who was again brought up with a royal and luxurious education.
But it may be most just to 2 say perhaps, " 0 Darius, thou hast not learned the evil conduct of Cyrus, but hast brought up2 Xerxes in the same manners, as Cyrus did Cambyses.
He therefore, as being a child of the same education, has brought to pass what is very near to the sufferings of Cambyses;
and from that time3 scarcely a single Persian king has become truly great except in name.
Now the cause of this was not fortune, but, accord­ ing to my reasoning, the vicious life, which the sons of those, who were remarkably rich and tyrannical, for the most part lived.
For neither boy, nor man, nor old person, will ever become superior in virtue from such an education."
And these are the matters which we say should be considered by a legis­ lator, and by us likewise at present.
But it is just, 0 Lace­ dæmonians, to give this praise to your state, that you never distribute any superior honour or food4 to poverty or wealth, or to a private station or a kingly one, which the oracle5 from some god has not at the first prophetically enjoined.
For it is not proper in a state, 6to distribute to any one?
superior honours, because he is superior in wealth;
nor because1 he is swift-footed, or handsome, or robust, without some virtue, and not in the case of a virtue even, from which temperance is excluded.
Megil. 2 How, guest, say you this ?[13.]
Athen.
Fortitude is surely one part of virtue.
Athen.
Judge then yourself, after hearing my reasoning, whether you would admit any fellow-dweller or neighbour to be very brave, when not temperate, but profligate ?
Megil.
Speak good words.
Athen.
What then, that an artist is wise in things of his art, but unjust ?
Megil.
By no means.
Athen.
But justice could not be produced3 without tem­ perance..egil.
How could it ?
Athen.
Nor could he, whom we just now laid down to be wise, as possessing pleasures and pains, in harmony with, and following right reason.
Megil.
Certainly not.Athen. 4
But let us still consider this too, touching the be­ stowing of honours in states, of what kind do they take place properly or not on each occasion.
4Athen.
Whether temperance, if it be alone in a soul with­ out all the rest of virtue, can justly be a thing either of honour or dishonour ?
Megil.
I know not what to say.
Athen.
You speak with moderation.
For had you said either the one or the other, about which I asked the question, you would have appeared1 to me at least to have spoken be­ side the measure.
2Megil.
3
It would then have turned out well.
3Athen.
Be it so.
The addition then relating to honours and dishonours will be worthy not of a discourse, but rather of some irrational silence.
4Megil.
You appear to me to mean temperance.
Athen.
Yes.
But that which benefits us the most of the others, would, in addition to its being honoured the most, be honoured the most justly;
and that which is second (in benefit) would be second (in honour);
and thus each thing obtaining, according to the reasoning in succession, its honours in due order, would obtain them justly.
Megil.
Such is the case.
Athen.
What then, shall we not say that it is the busi­ ness of the legislator to distribute these ?
Megil.
And very much so.
Athen.
Are you then willing for us to allow him to distri­ bute all things, both pertaining to each work, and to trifling particulars ?
But with respect to making a triple division, let us endeavour, since we also are somehow desirous of laws, to divide the greatest, second, and third, apart from each other.
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
We say then that a state ought, as it seems, if it is about to be preserved happy to the utmost of human power, necessarily to distribute honours and dishonours in a proper manner.
Now (to do so) properly, it is for the good things pertaining to the soul, to be laid down as the most honourable and the first in rank, temperance at the same time being pre­ sent to it (the soul);
and as the second in rank, the things beautiful and good pertaining to the body;
and as the third in rank, the things pertaining to property and riches.
But if any legislator or state proceeds beyond these, by leading either riches to honours, or by placing by means of honours in the foremost rank any of the things in the rear, he will do a deed neither holy nor statesman-like.
Is this to be held as said, or how ?
Megil.
Let it be held as said clearly.
Athen.
The inquiry into the Persian polity has caused us to speak to a greater length on these points.
And we find that they became much worse still ;
1 and we say the reason was, that through their taking away too much of liberty from the people, and introducing a despotic power more than was proper, they destroyed the feeling of friendship and of a common in­ terest in the city ;
and that, when this is destroyed, the deliber­ ations of the rulers are not engaged in behalf of the governed and the people, but for their own power;
(and) 2 should they think that something more, even if it were little, would accrue to themselves, they would, by destroying with fire3 cities overturned, and by (treating) friendly4 nations in an hostile and unpitying manner, at once hate and be hated.
5
But when they come to the people during a time of need to fight for them, they find in them no such communion of interest, 6that any one is willing with alacrity 6 to run a risk and to fight;
and though they possess myriads, not to be defined in a calculation, yet they are all useless for war;
and, as if in want of men, they hire some, and think they will be saved by mercenary and foreign troops;
and added to this, they are compelled to act the part of simpletons, proclaiming by their acts,7 that the things constantly called honourable or beautiful in a state are a trifle as compared with silver and gold.
Megil.
Entirely so.[14.]
Athen.
Let then the subject of the affairs of the Per­ sians, which are now administered not correctly through ex­ cessive slavery and despotism, have an end.
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
But after this it is proper for us to go through in a similar manner the polity of Attica, 1 (that it may appear)1 how perfect liberty even, exempt from all rule, is not a little worse than that, which has a moderation 2in rule under others.
2
For at the time, when the Persian invasion took place against the Greeks, and perhaps against almost all the inhabitants of Europe, our polity had been of long standing;
and we had some four institutions framed with reference to a property-census ;
3 and a certain modesty too at that time was a despot, through which we were then willing to live in subjection to the laws.
In addition to this, the magnitude of the expedition, extending over land and sea, brought on a fear not to be overcome, and caused us to endure a still greater submission to the rulers and the laws.
And on all these accounts a violent friendship came upon us towards ourselves.
For nearly ten years before the naval battle at Salamis, Datis had arrived, leading the Persian ex­ pedition of Darius, who had sent him distinctly against the Athenians and Eretrians, to reduce them to slavery, and to carry them off;
and proclaiming 4 death to him, if he did not do so.
And Datis did in a very short time with his many myriads and by main force subdue them entirely;
5 and he sent a certain dreadful report to our city,5 that not one of the Eretrians had escaped him;
for that the soldiers of Datis had by joining hands to hands 6got, as into a net, the whole of Eretria.
6
This report, whether arriving true or in any way whatever, struck with terror the other Greeks, and the Athenians likewise;
and on their sending ambassadors every where,1 no one was willing to assist them, except the Lacedæ­ monians ;
and even they, through the war then raging against Messéné, or whether something else, as alleged,2 prevented them,-for we know not,-arrived one day later than the battle that took place at Marathon.
After this, mighty preparations and innumerable threats are said to have come from the king.
But as time went on, Darius was reported to have died, and his son, young and violent, to have received from him the govern­ ment, and by no means to have desisted from his (father's)3 un­ dertaking.
Now the Athenians were of opinion, that the whole of this preparation was against themselves, on account of what had occurred at Marathon;
and hearing of Athos being dug through, and of (the shores) of the Hellespont being united, and of the great number of the vessels, they thought there was no safety for themselves by land or sea;
4 for that none would assist them ;
as they recollected that, even when (the Persians) had come before, and had done thoroughly for the Eretrians, not one had given them assistance then,4 or had run a risk by fighting with them ;
and they expected the same thing would then take place, at least by land ;
and on the other hand, by sea they saw a want of all means of safety, since more than a thousand ships were being brought against them.
They thought, however, upon a single source of safety, slender indeed and dubious, yet the only one, through their looking to what had previously occurred, how even then victory had appeared to spring out of difficulties, as they were fighting.
5
Carried along upon this hope, they found their refuge rested in themselves alone and in the gods.
All these things then 6 engendered in them a friendship 6 with each other, both the fear which was then present, and that which had been produced by the laws before,' and which they had felt, when they were submitting to their former laws;
(a fear) which we have frequently in the preceding discourse called modesty;
to which we have said (all) 2 must be subservient, who are about to become good men;
(and) of which he who is the slave 3 is free and fearless ;
4 whom had not this fear seized,4 he would never have 5 quickly comes and defended himself and aided the sacred places, and tombs, and country, and all the rest of household ties, and friends, as he did aid at that time;
6 but each of us would at that period have been routed in small parties, and scattered one hither and another thither.
6Megil.
And very much so, guest;
and correctly have you spoken, and in a manner becoming both to yourself and country.[15.]
Athen.
Such is the case, Megillus.
For it is just to mention to you, what happened at that time, as being a sharer in the nature of your parents.
But do you and Clinias consider, whether we say what is suited to legislation.
For I do not go through these matters for the sake of telling a story, but for the sake of what I am saying.
For look ye.
Since the same circumstance has in a certain manner happened to us, that did to the Persians, while they were leading the people to every kind of slavery, but we, on the contrary, turning the masses to every kind of7 freedom, how and what shall we say hence- forth ?
8
The reasons that have previously occurred to us, have in a certain manner been detailed correctly.
8Megil.
You speak well.
But endeavour to point out to us still more clearly what has been said just now.
Athen.
This shall be.
The people was not, my friends, ac­ cording to the laws of old, the master of any, but did after a certain manner obey willingly the laws.
Megil.
Of what laws are you speaking ?
Athen.
Those relating in the first place to music as then existing-in order that we may detail from the beginning the great progress made in a life of freedom.
For music was then divided by us according to certain kinds and figures of itself;
1 and prayers to the gods was a kind of ode, and they were called by the name of hymns;
and the contrary to this was another kind of ode, and a person would have called it lamentations for the most part ;
2 and another was Pæans,3 and another the birth of Dionysus, called, I think,4 a Dithyramb:
and they have called laws5 by this very name, as being another ode;
and they have given the additional name of "harp music.
After these and some others had been ordained, it was not lawful to use one kind for another.
But the authority to know any of these, and, after knowing, at the same time to judge of them, and to fine the person not obedient, was not the whistle6 nor certain uneducated noises of the multitude, as at present, nor yet the clatterings that express praise, but it was decreed that persons, who were conversant with educa­ tion, should themselves hear to the end in silence;
but for boys, and boy-leaders,7 and the numerous vulgar, there was the admonition by a rod putting them in order.
These things having been thus ordained,1 the multitude of citizens were willing to be ruled, and not to dare to judge in a tumultuous manner.
After this, as time went on, the poets (themselves) became the leaders of this uneducated lawlessness ;
being na­ turally indeed poetical, but ignorant with respect to what is just and lawful in music, they were acting like Bacchants, and possessed with joy more than was becoming, and were ming­ ling lamentations with hymns, and pæans with dithyrambs, and imitated with harp music the music of the hautboy, and by bringing together all things to all they involuntarily, through their ignorance, asserted falsely that music did not possess any correctness whatever;
but that it might be judged of most correctly by the pleasure of the party gratified, whether he were a better person or a worse.
Composing, therefore, works of this kind, and adding to them words of this kind, they in­ fused into the multitude a lawlessness with respect to music, and a daring of their being competent to judge.
Hence the­ atres, from being silent, came to be noisy, as if capable of un­ derstanding what is beautiful or not in music;
and instead of an aristocracy in it, a certain depraved theatrocracy was pro­ duced.
For if only a democracy of free men had existed, nothing very dreadful would have taken place;
but now from music there began an opinion with us respecting the wisdom of all men in all things, and a lawlessness, and after these did a li­ centiousness follow.
For men became fearless, as if endued with knowledge;
and this absence of fear generated shamelesness.
For through boldness to feel no fear of the opinion of a better person, is almost a depraved shamelessness, (resulting) from a certain liberty that has dared too much.
Megil.
You speak most true.[16.]
Athen.
And consequent upon this liberty, there would arise that of being unwilling to submit to rulers ;
and following this, to fly from the submission to, and admonition of, a father and mother and elders, and to the being near the point of seeking to be not subject to laws;
and (having arrived;
at that point, to think nothing at all of oaths and faith and the gods;
2 by exhibiting and imitating the ancient Titanic1 nature, as it is called, so that, by again arriving at those 2 same things, they led a life of difficulty, and never ceased from ills.
On what account then has this been said by us ?
It appears that I at least 3 ought to pull up4 a discourse, like a horse, on each occasion,5 and not, by having its mouth without a bridle, to be carried away forcibly, and, according to the proverb, fall6 from the discourse, as from an ass.
But I again ask7 what was just now said.
On what account has this been mentioned ?
Athen.
This then has been said on account of those ?
Athen.
We have said that a legislator ought in laying down laws to aim at three things, how the state may, by being legis­ lated for, become free, and friendly to itself, and possess a mind.
These were the objects.
Is it not so ?
Megil.
Entirely so.
Athen.
For the sake of this we selected two kinds8 of go­ vernment, one most despotic, and the other most free;
and we were considering which of these is rightly administered.
But on laying hold of each of them, as regards1 a certain mo­ deration, on the part of some to be despots, and of others to be free, we saw that then (in moderation) prosperity resulted to them in an eminent degree, but that when each party was proceeding to the extreme, the one, of slavery, and the other, of the contrary, no benefit had accrued to either these or those.
Megil.
You speak most true.
A then.
And moreover, for the sake of these things, we looked into both the Doric army, and the country under the Dardan mountains, and the settlement by the sea, and first those persons who remained after the deluge;
and moreover we had a previous conversation about music and drunkenness, and on subjects still prior to these.
For all this has been men­ tioned, for the sake of seeing, how a state may be best admin­ istered, and how every one may individually best pass through life.
Now, if we have done any thing of importance, what proof of error can be brought, Megillus and Clinias, against us ?
Clin.
I seem to myself, 0 guest, to have something in my mind.
For it appears that the subjects of all the discourse, we have gone through, have arisen through some good fortune.
For I have come almost in want of them at the present moment;
and both you and Megillus here are by some opportune acci­ dent present.
For I will not conceal from you what has just now occurred to me, but I will make it a kind of omen.
For the greatest part of Crete is attempting at present to establish a certain colony, and orders the Cnossians to take the care of the matter;
but the city of the Cnossians (imposes it) upon me and nine others;
and at the same time orders us to lay down laws (taken) from this place, if any are pleasing to us, and, if there are any, from elsewhere, making no account of their fo­ reign character, should they appear to be better.
Let us then grant this favour2 to myself and you.
3
After making a selection out of what has been said,3 let us in our discourse form a state, and colonize it, as if from its commencement;
and there will be to us at the same time an inquiry into what we are in search of, and at the same time I may perhaps make use of this formation for the city that is to be.
Athen.
You are not, 0 guest, proclaiming a war.
And, unless there is some opposition on the part of Megillus, con­ ceive that every thing on my side will be to the best of my power according to your mind.
Clin.
You speak well.
Megil.
And on my side likewise.
Clin.
You both have spoken most beautifully.
Let us then endeavour, in the first place, to form in our discourse a state.[1.]
Athen.
COME then, what kind of state must we imagine it is to be ?
1
I mean that I am not asking what is its name now, nor what it will be necessary to call it in after-time ;
1 for this perhaps its colonization, or some spot, or the surname of some river or fountain, or of the gods of the place, may give their own appellation to the new state;
but this is rather what I wish to ask concerning it, whether it is near the sea, or inland ?
Clin.
The state, of which we are now speaking, is, 0 guest, distant from the sea nearly eighty stadia.
2Athen.
Are there any harbours along it, or is it entirely harbourless ?
CUn.
It has, as far as is possible, very good harbours, 0 guest.
Athen.
Ho!
ho!
What say you ?
But is the country about it likewise all-prolific, or is it wanting in some things ?
Clin.
It is nearly in want of nothing.
Athen.
Will there be any neighbouring state near to it ?
Clin.
Not very;
on which account it is colonized.
For an expulsion of the inhabitants having taken place of old in that spot, caused the country to be desolate for an immense space of time.
Athen.
But with respect to plains, and mountains, and woods, how has it obtained by lot a portion of each ?
Clin.
It is wholly1 similar to the rest of Crete.
Athen.
Would you say it is more rough than plain ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
It is not therefore incurably unfit for the acquisition of virtue.
For, if it were near the sea, and had good harbours, but not all-productive, but wanting in many things, it would require for itself some powerful preserver, and certain divine lawgivers,2 unless being such naturally, it had been about to acquire2 many various and depraved manners.
3
But now it has some consolation from its distance of eighty stadia.
It is situ­ ated indeed nearer the sea than is becoming, by nearly as much that it has, as you state, good harbours.
There is however this desirable circumstance.
For a sea, being near to a country, 4 brings something4 pleasant each day, although it is in reality a very brackish and bitter neighbour.
5
For filling it through 6retail-trading with foreign commerce6 and money-making, it begets in the disposition a moral conduct tost backwards and forwards,7 and not to be trusted, and (renders) the state faith­ less and unfriendly to itself and to other nations likewise.
It possesses however against these evils a consolation in being all-productive ;
since if it were rugged, it is evident that it would not be 8 very productive and all-productive at the same time.

For possessing this (advantage), by possessing a great export-trade, it would in return be filled with gold and silver coin in abundance;
1 than which a greater evil cannot, so to say, exist, (comparing) one thing with another, in a state, as regards the possession of manners generous and just, as we stated, if we remember, in our previous discourse.
Clin.
We do recollect;
and we concede that we were then and we are now speaking correctly.
Athen.
But how is the country situated as regards timber for ship-building ?
Clin.
There is not any fir worth mentioning, or pine, and not much cypress;
and a person would find little of larch, or plane-trees, which it is necessary for shipwrights to make use of for the inner parts of vessels.
Athen.
And this too would not be ill for the nature of the country.
Athen.
Because it is good for a city to be unable to imitate easily its enemies in mischievous imitations.
Clin.
To which of the subjects that have been mentioned have you, after looking, said what you are now stating ?[2.]
Athen.
Do thou, 0 excellent man, 2 watch me, looking to what was said at the beginning, the question about the Cretan laws, how they looked to one thing.
2
And you two as­ serted that this very thing was what regards war ;
but I, taking you up, said, that when1 such laws, being laid down, looked to virtue, it was well;
but when1 only to a part, but not to the whole almost of virtue, I did not entirely agree.
Do you then still again watch 2 my present3 legislation, while following me, if perchance I lay down any law not tending to virtue, or to a part of virtue.
For I make it a fundamental position, that he alone lays down a law correctly, who, like an archer, ever aims at that, on which alone some of those things that are ever beautiful4 follow close, but who leaves all the rest, whether it be wealth or any thing else of that kind, which happens to exist without those before mentioned.
And I said on one side, that the imitation of enemies would be then5 mischievous, when any one residing near the sea is annoyed by enemies, as for instance—for I will relate (it) to you, although not wishing to remind you of a past annoyance-when Minos imposed the payment of a tribute upon the inhabitants of At­ tica, through his having acquired a great power by sea.

But the Athenians did not at that period possess, as they do now, ships of war, nor a country abounding in wood, suited for ship-building, so as to exhibit with facility a naval power.
Hence they could not, through nautical imitation, become im­ mediately sailors themselves at that time, and defend them­ selves against their enemies.
And it would have been for their advantage to have lost many times 7 seven young men,7 before 1(suffering what happened to them.
For,)1 instead of being foot-soldiers, with heavy arms, and remaining firm,2 they were accustomed, on becoming sailors, frequently to leap with a run into and upon the vessels, and to come back again quickly;
and to think they were doing nothing disgraceful in not daring to die, by waiting for the attacks of the enemy advancing;
and there were pretexts plausible and ready to those throwing away their arms, and making, as they said, not disgraceful flights;
for language of this kind3 is wont to arise from naval heavy-armed troops4—(language) by no means worthy 5of unbounded praise, but very much the con­ trary.
5
For it is never proper to accustom persons to mis­ chievous habits, and this too the best part of the citizens.
And it is surely possible to understand this from Homer, that such conduct is not honourable.
For with him Ulysses abuses Agamemnon for exhorting the Greeks, at that time pressed down by the Trojans in fight, to draw down their ships to the sea, and he (Ulysses) is harsh against him (Agamemnon), and says, (II. xiv. 96,) Thou bid'st, while e'en of war, still standing round, The clamour's heard, our well-bench'd ships to drag Seaward, that, what the Trojans oft have wish'd, Their prayers may be accomplish'd, and 'gainst us The scale from on high Death turn.
But ne'er will Greeks Hold to the fight, while ships to sea are drawn ;
But frighten'd look, and from the fray retreat.
Such hurt will bring the counsel thou dost preach.
He too knew then that three-banked galleys standing near6 were an evil to heavy-armed soldiers while fighting at sea.
For even lions would, by adopting similar conduct, be ac­ customed to fly from stags.
Moreover the states, when power and safety depend upon a navy, do not bestow honours 1on the most beautiful of warlike concerns.'
For an account of the pilot's art, 2 and the rower's art, and that which is connected with persons of various kinds and of no great worth, no one could bestow upon each individual honours in a proper man­ ner.
And yet how can a polity deprived of this exist cor­ rectly ?
Clin.
It is nearly impossible.
But yet, 0 guest, we Cre­ tans say that the naval battle, which took place at Salamis, of the Greeks against the Barbarians, has preserved Greece.
Athen.
And indeed many both of the Greeks and Barba­ rians assert the same thing.
But we, my friend, both I and Megillus here, say, that the battle of foot-soldiers at Mara­ thon and Platææ did one of them begin, and the other com­ plete, the safety of the Greeks;
and some made the Greeks better, but some not better, so to say of the battles that conjointly saved us at that time ;
for to the naval battle at Salamis I will add the one at Artemisium.
But now, looking to the virtue of a polity, let us consider the nature of the region, and the order of the laws ;
not thinking, as the many do, that to be preserved and to exist is alone to mankind the most honourable of all things, but to become the best, and to continue to be so, for as long a period as they may live.
But this, I think, has been stated by us in the former part of our discourse.
Athen.
Let us then consider this alone, whether we are proceeding in the same path as being the best for states, touch­ in,, their settlement and legislation.
Clin. (Let us do so) very much.[3.]
Athen.
Tell me, then, what is next in order to this, what are the people, who are to be the colonists;
whether any one ( may go), who is willing from the whole of Crete, since the masses have become in the cities more numerous than according to the quantity of food to be got from the land ?
For you surely do not bring together whoever of the Greeks is willing (to go).
And yet I see that some persons from Argos, and Ægina, and other parts of Greece, have settled themselves in the country amongst you.
But for the present, tell me, from whence do you say there will be an army of citizens ?
Clin.
It seems it will be from the whole of Crete;
and of the rest of the Greeks it appears that (the colonizers) will receive persons from Peloponnesus, as fellow-settlers for the most part.
For, what you were saying just now, you said truly, that there are some from Argos, and the race, which has the highest character here at present, is that of Gortyna, be­ cause it happens to have settled there I from Gortyna in the Peloponnesus.
Athen.
The establishment of a colony would not take place in states with equal facility, when one family, like a swarm of bees, going from one country settles down, friends from friends, after having been, as it were, besieged by a certain want of space, or compelled by some other sufferings of a similar kind.
For it sometimes happens that a part of a city is forcibly driven out by seditions and compelled to migrate as strangers to some other spot;
and sometimes a whole city has exiled itself, after being thoroughly vanquished in war.
In all these cases then it is easy for one to be colonized and governed by laws, but difficult for another.
For when a colony is of one race, and has the same language, and the same laws, it possesses a kind of friendship, as being a partaker in the same holy rites, and every thing else of a similar kind, nor does it easily en­ dure other laws, and a polity foreign to what it had at home.
And sometimes a colony, having revolted through the badness of its laws, and through custom still seeking to adopt the very same habits as those, by which it was previously corrupted, be­ comes refractory and disobedient to its colonizer and legislator.
But on the other hand a colony, composed of all kinds of people flowing together to the same point, will perhaps be more willingly obedient to certain new laws;
but to conspire together, and, like a pair of horses to froth together,1 as the saying is, individually to the same point, is the work of a long time and very difficult.
Nevertheless legislation and the colonization of states is a thing the most effective of all for virtue in man.
Clin.
It is probable;
but tell me more clearly, looking to what have you said this ?[4.]
Athen.
I appear to myself, good sir, while praising2 and speculating about legislators, to be about to say something unimportant.
But if we shall say aught opportunely, it would be no matter.
And yet why do I feel a difficulty ?
for nearly all human affairs appear to exist in this manner.
CUn.
Of what are you speaking ?
Athen.
I was about to say, that no man is ever a legislator ;
but that fortune and all kinds of accidents, happening in all kinds of ways, are our legislators.
For either a war by vio­ lence has overturned polities and changed laws, or the want of means arising from severe poverty.
Many innovations too diseases compel men to make, through pestilences falling upon them, and unfavourable seasons during many years.
He then, who foresees all this, will be eager1 to exclaim, as I just now did, that no mortal was ever a legislator, but that nearly all human affairs are accidents ;
and that it is possible for him, who asserts all this respecting navigation, and the arts of the pilot, and physician, and general, to appear to speak correctly.
But on the other hand, it is equally possible for the person (to appear) to speak correctly on these points, who says this.
Athen.
That a god, and, together with a god, fortune and opportunity govern all human affairs ;
but that it is necessary to admit that art, a somewhat milder power, follows them.
For on the occasion of a storm I should consider it a thing of great moment for the pilot's art to take a part, or not.
Or how (say you) ?
Clin. Thus.Athen.
Will not the same reasoning apply similarly in the case of other things ?
And we must attribute the very same principle to legislation ;
that, other things concurring which ought to happen to a country, if it is about to live happily, it is requisite for a legislator, who adheres to truth, to fall on each occasion upon a state of such a kind.
Clin.
You speak most true.
Athen.
Would not he then, who possesses an art for each of the above-mentioned occasions, be justly able3 to pray for something to be present1 with him through fortune, should he be wanting 2 only in art ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
And all the rest just now mentioned would, if com­ manded to tell their prayers, say so.
Is it not so ?
Athen.
And a legislator likewise would, I think, do the same.
Clin.
So I think.
A then.
Come then, Legislator, (and say)—for let us address him—a city possessing what, and being in what state, shall we give you, 3 and you take and hold,3 so that you may admin­ ister sufficiently, from the things remaining,4 the city ?
What is it possible to assert rightly after this ?
5
Shall we not say surely something belonging to the legislator ?
For it is meet.
5Clin.
It is.
Athen.
This.
Give me a city governed by a tyrant, he will say;
and let the tyrant be a young man, of a good me­ mory, and docile, and brave, and naturally of a magnificent disposition ;
and let that, which, we said before, ought to fol­ low all the parts of virtue, now accompany the soul of the tyrant, if there is about to be any benefit from the presence of the other qualities.
Clin.
Our guest, Megillus, appears to me to say that tem­ perance should follow the other virtues.
Is it not so ?
Athen.
Yes, temperance, Clinias, in its popular sense, and not that, which any one in solemn phrase would call pru­ dence, and compel it to be temperance;
but that feeling which, inherent in boys and savage animals, bursts into flower on the instant, so that some are incontinent1 with respect to pleasures, but others continent;
and which we said,2 when it exists apart from the many things called good, is not worth mention.
For you understand what I am saying ?
Clin.
Perfectly.
Athen.
This nature, then, let our tyrant possess in addition to those (mentioned above), if the city is about to have a polity in the quickest and best manner possible, and on the re­ ceiving of which it may live the most happily.
For there nei­ ther is, nor will there ever be, the establishment of a polity more rapid or better than this.
Clin.
But how, 0 guest, and by what argument would anyone, who asserts this, persuade himself that he is speaking correctly ?
Athen.
It is easy, Clinias, to understand how this is so naturally.
Clin.
How say you ?
Do you assert,3 if the tyrant is a young man, temperate, docile, of a good memory, brave, (and) mag­ nificent ?
Athen.
Add too fortunate in nothing else, except in that during his time a legislator is existing worthy of praise, and that a certain fortune leads the two to the same point.
For, on this taking place, there is brought to pass by a god nearly every thing which (is done), when he wishes any state to be emi­ nently prosperous ;
and in the second degree, when two rulers are of such a kind;
and in the third degree, (when three);
5 and in a similar proportion more difficult, (as the rulers) 6 are more numerous;
7 but, the contrary, by how much the con­ trary happens.
7Clin.
You assert, as it seems, that the best state would result from a tyranny, in conjunction with a superior legislator and a well-regulated tyrant;
and that it would most easily and rapidly change 1 into that from such a kind as this;
1 and that the second in degree is from an oligarchy ;
and 2 the third in degree, from a democracy.
Is it not so ?
2Athen.
By no means.
But the first is produced from a tyranny;
the second, from a regal polity;
the third, from a certain democracy ;
but with respect to the fourth, an oligar­ chy would be able to receive a generation of this kind with the utmost difficulty.
For in it there are the greatest num­ ber of the powerful.
Now we say, that these things then take place, when a legislator is naturally true, and when there ex­ ists in him a strength in common with those, who possess the greatest influence in the state.
But where this exists the fewest in number, but at the same time the most strong, as in the case of a tyranny, in this way and then there is wont to take place a rapidity and easiness in the change.
Clin.
How ?
For we do not understand.
A then.
And yet I think this has been said by us, not once, but often.
But perhaps you never saw a state under a tyrant.
Clin.
Nor am I desirous of such a spectacle.
Athen.
And yet you may see it in the one just now spoken of.
Athen.
That the tyrant, who wishes to change the habits of a state, has no need either of (great) 3 labour, or any very long time for the accomplishment of his purpose.
For4 it is neces­ sary that he should proceed the first in whatever road he wishes, either to turn the citizens to the pursuit of virtue, or the contrary, and mark out the course by acting himself the first, and praising and honouring some things, but bringing a blame upon others, and disgracing the party that is disobedi­ ent in each of these doings.
Clin.
And how can we imagine that the other citizens will quickly follow him, who has obtained such persuasion, and at the same time force ?
Athen.
Let no one persuade us, friends, that a state has ever changed 2 its laws more quickly and easily by any other way than the leading of its rulers, or that this happens now by any other means, or will happen ever again.
For that indeed is neither impossible for us, nor would it be done with difficulty.
But this is the thing difficult to be done, and has rarely taken place in a long time;
although, when it does happen, it produces in the state, in which it is found, ten thousand, or rather every good thing.
Clin.
Of what are you speaking ?
Athen.
When a divine love of temperate and just pursuits is inherent in certain mighty powers, whether they rule ac­ cording to a monarchy, or a marked superiority in wealth or family, or should any one bring back the nature of Nestor, who they say excelled all men in the power of speaking, and still more in temperance.
But this, as they say, took place in the times of Troy, but in ours not at all.
If then such a man existed formerly, or shall exist, or is at present amongst us, he lives in a blessed state, and blessed too are those, who hear the words proceeding from his temperate mouth.
Of a similar kind is the reasoning respecting all power, that, when the greatest power of a man falls to the same point with the acting prudently and temperately, then the production of the best polity and of such kind of laws takes place, but otherwise it will never be.
Let this then be held to be spoken oracularly, as if it were a story detailed,3 and to have been shown, that in one way it is difficult for a state to have good laws, and in another, that, if what we have said should take place, it would have them in a manner the quickest and the easiest by far.
Athen.
Let us now endeavour, by adapting our laws to your state, to mould it, as old men do boys,1 by our discourse.
Clin.
Let us go this road, and no longer delay.[5.]
Athen.
But let us call upon a god for the preparation of the state.
And may he hear, and hearing come to us, in a propitious and kind manner, to adorn, in conjunction with us, the state and laws !
Clin.
May he come!
Athen.
But what kind of polity have we in our mind to en­ join upon the state ?
Clin.
Inform me still more clearly what you wish to say;
for instance, whether it is a certain democracy, or oligarchy, or aristocracy, or a regal government.
For you would not surely speak of a tyranny, as we should imagine.
Athen.
Come, then, which of you is willing to answer first, by stating what is the polity at home ?
Megil.
Is it not more just for myself, who am the elder, to speak first ?
Clin.
Perhaps so.
Megil.
When I consider, guest, the polity of Lacedæmon, I am unable to tell you what I ought to call it thus.
2
For it appears to me to be similar to a tyranny.
For the power of the Ephori in it is wonderfully tyrannical.
And yet it some­ times appears to me to be the most similar of all states to a democracy.
But, on the other hand, not to say that it is an aristocracy, is perfectly absurd.
There is in it likewise the office of a king for life, which is said, both by all men, and by us too, to be the most ancient of all.
On being then asked thus suddenly, I cannot, as I have said, by a definition, tell you which of these polities it is.
Clin.
I too, Megillus, appear to be affected in the same manner as yourself.
For I am quite at a loss as to which of these I should firmly assert the polity in Cnossus to be.
Athen.
For you, most excellent men, do really3 participate in polities.
But those, which we now name such, are not polities, but settlements of cities, ruled over, and a slave to1 some portions of each other, and each is denominated from the power of the ruler.
But if it were meet for a city to be called after this manner, it ought to be called by the name of the god, who is the ruler of those that possess truly a mind.
Clin.
Who is this god ?
A then.
Must we then still to a small extent make use of a fable, if we are about to explain in a careful manner what has been just now asked ?
Is it not meet to do so in this way ?
Clin.
By all means.[6.]
Athen.
A long time antecedent to that of the cities, whose settlement we have before gone through, there is said to have existed in the time of Saturn a certain government of, and dwelling in, them extremely happy, and of which that, which is now administered the best,2 exhibits an imitation.
Megil.
It would as it seems be very requisite to hear about it.
Athen.
It appears so to me;
and hence I have brought the subject amongst us during our conversation.
Megil.
And you have done so most correctly ;
and you will act very correctly too in bringing to an end the fable in due order as far as it is suitable.
Athen.
I must do as you say.
We have received then a report of the happy life of the persons living of that period, how it possessed all things without stint and produced spon­ taneously.
Of this state of things the cause is said to have been something of this kind.
Saturn, well knowing, as we have already detailed, that no human nature, when adminis­ tering with absolute power the affairs of man, is so sufficient, as not to be filled with insolence and injustice, did, from re­ flecting upon this, place over our cities, as kings and rulers, not men, but Daemons of a more divine and excellent race;
'just as we now do, by placing some men over flocks of sheep1 and such herds of cattle as are tame.
For we do not make oxen rulers of oxen, nor goats of goats;
but we ourselves rule over them, as being of a better race than them.
The same thing does2 the god, who being a lover of mankind has placed over us the race of Dæmons, as being better than us;
which through the great inactivity3 on their part, and great too on ours, has taken care of us, and by imparting to us peace and modesty and good legislation4 and abundance of justice, rendered the human race exempt from sedition, and happy.
And now this our discourse, employing (the language of) truth, asserts, that of such states as not a god but some mor­ tal governs, there is to them no escape from evils and labours;
but it conceives that we ought, by every contrivance, to imi­ tate the life, said to have been under Saturn;
and, as far as immortality is in us, by being obedient to it, to administer both publicly and privately our houses and cities, calling law the distribution of mind.
For should one man, or an oligarchy, or even democracy, possess a soul eager after pleasures and desires, and requiring to be filled with these, and retaining nothing,5 but connected closely with an 6 evil not to be finished, and a disease not to be filled,6 and should such a person1 rule over either a city or an individual, and trample upon the laws, there would be, as we just now said, no con­ trivance for security.
It is necessary then to consider, Clinias, whether we shall be persuaded by this account or not.
Clin.
It is surely necessary to be persuaded.
Athen.
You understand then, that some say there are as many species of laws as of polities;
but of polities we have already gone through as many as the multitude say there are.
Do not then think that our present doubt is about a matter of no moment, but about one of the greatest.
For that, to which the just and the unjust ought to look, has come again to us as a matter of doubt.
For persons say that the laws ought not to look either to war or to the whole of virtue, but to see 2 what may be beneficial to a polity whatever it may be, so that it may always rule, and never be dissolved;
and (they say) that the natural definition of the just is laid down most beautifully thus.
Athen.
That what belongs to the superior is beneficial.
Clin. Speak still more clearly.
Athen.
Thus (do I speak).
On every occasion the superior power, they say, lays down the laws in a state.
Is it not so ?
Clin.
You speak the truth.
Athen.
Think you then, say they, that ever at any time will a mob after being victorious, or any other polity, or even a tyrant,3 lay down willingly laws for any other purpose at first, than for what is conducive to the continuance of its own power ?
Clin.
How should it ?
Athen.
Whoever transgresses what is thus laid down, him will the lawgiver, who calls such laws by the name of just, punish as a person acting unjustly.
Clin.
It appears so.
Athen.
In this way then, and in this wise, and by this manner, will what is just exist.
Clin.
So at least this reasoning says.
Athen.
For this is one of those prerogatives 1 relating to government.
Clin.
What are those ?
Athen.
Those, which we were then considering as to what ought to govern what.
And it appeared that it was proper for parents (to rule over) their progeny, and the older over the younger, and the well-born over the ignobly born.
And there were many other things, if we remember, and 2 some an obstacle to others;
and among them there was this one;
(for) we said somehow that Pindar conceived it to be according to nature for the most violent to take the lead, to use his own words.
3
Clin.
This was indeed said formerly.
A then.
But consider to what4 persons our state is to be committed.
For a thing of this kind has taken place ten thousand times in certain states.[7.]
Athen.
When power has been fought for, the con­ querors are wont to take the affairs of the state so strongly into their own hands, as to give no share of the government to the conquered, or to their descendants, and they live watching each other,5 lest any one should get into power and cause an insurrection, through remembering the ills which had taken place.
At present we surely say that those are neither poli­ ties, nor upright laws, which are not laid down for the sake of the whole state in common;
and those, which so exist for the sake of some (alone), we call 1 seditions, but not polities;
' and that the things which they call just, are called so in vain.
Now this has been asserted by us on this account, because we will give your state no one as a magistrate, because he is rich, or possesses any thing of this kind, such as strength, or size, or family;
but whoever is most obedient to the laws laid down, and gains this victory in the state, to him we assert must be given the ministerial office, that relates to the gods,2 the greatest to the first;
the second to him, who gains the second prize;
and 3 so, according to a certain ratio,3 to those coming in a certain order must each of the things after these be assigned.
But those, that are called rulers, I have now denominated the ministers of the laws, not for the sake of introducing any innovation in names ;
but I think 4 there will be to a state a safety from this more than from any thing (else), and the contrary (from a contrary).
4
For I see destruction is at hand to that state, 5 in which the law is ruled over, and is powerless.
5
But in the state, where the law is the absolute ruler over the rulers, and the rulers are slaves of the law, I behold safety and all other good things, such as the gods have bestowed upon states.
Clin.
Truly so, by Zeus, 0 guest!
For according to your age you perceive acutely.
Megil.
For every man, when young, sees, himself by himself, matters of this kind very dully;
but most acutely, when old.
Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
But what after this ?
Shall we not suppose settlers as having arrived and being present ?
and must we not finish the portion next in order of our discourse for them ?
Atlten.
Let us then address them.
0 ye men, God, as the old saw (says), having (in himself) the beginning, and end, and middle of all things, does, proceeding in a circle, accord­ ing to nature, bring things to an end by a straight road ;
2 and him does Justice ever follow, the punisher of those, who are deserters from the divine law;
and close upon her attends in a humble and orderly manner he, who would be happy;
3but he, who is lifted up by high-boasting, exalting himself through his riches, or honours, or the fine form of his body, and having from his youthfulness and thoughtlessness his soul inflamed with insolence, as one who is in no need of either a ruler or a leader, but competent to lead even others, is left, deserted by the deity;
and being thus left, and falling in with others of a similar kind, he leaps about, when he throws all things into confusion together;
and to many indeed he appears to be some­ body ;
but in no long time afterwards suffers a punishment, which justice would not blame, and causes himself and family and city to be utterly destroyed.
3
With regard then to these matters thus disposed in order, what must a prudent man do, or think, and what must he not ?
Clin.
This at least is plain, that every man ought to think how he may be one of those, who are to follow the deity.[8.]
Athen.
What manner of acting then is dear to and attendant upon the deity ?
There is one, which possesses one reason of old, that the similar will be friendly to the similar, when it is moderate;
but that the immoderate are neither friendly to each other nor to the moderate.
Now the deity will be especially the measure to us of all things, and much more than, as persons say, a man.
2
He then, who is to be­ come friendly to a nature of this kind, must necessarily become such to the utmost of his power.
And, according to this reasoning, our temperate man is dear to the deity, for he is similar to him.
But the intemperate man is dissimilar, and at variance (with the deity), and unjust;
and the rest of in­ stances are by the same reasoning affected in this way.
Let us then consider that language of this kind is to follow these premises, (language) I think the most beautiful, and the most true of all, namely, that for a good man to sacrifice to, and be conversant ever3 with, the gods, 4by means of prayers, and offerings, and every kind of attention to the gods,4 is a conduct the most beautiful, and best, and most conducive to a happy life, and moreover pre-eminently becoming ;
but to the wicked man the contraries of these naturally happen.
For the wicked man is unpurified in his soul, but the contrary one is pure ;
and to receive gifts from a defiled person is not at all correct for either a good man or a god.
1
To the unholy then there is much labour in vain respecting the gods;
but it is the most seasonable to all holy men.
Such then is the mark at which we ought to aim.
2
Whither then can be most correctly carried, what are called the arrows of a person, and what is the shoot­ in- out by thought, as it were by arrows ?
2
We assert, in the first place, that he, who gives after the Olympian gods, and those who preside over the city, as honours to the terrestrial gods, the things of an even number, 3 and secondary, and on the left hand,3 will in the most proper manner reach the mark of piety ;
but to the gods above these, things of an odd number, and those that signify the opposite to what have been just now mentioned.
And after these gods a prudent person will celebrate the holy rites of Daemons, and after them of Heroes.
And after them follow the statues of the household gods, held holy according to law;
and after them are the honours paid to living parents;
since it is just for a person, who owes the first and the greatest of debts, to pay those that are of the longest standing ;
I and to thinly that the things he has acquired and holds belong all to those, who begot him and brought him up, for supplying what is required for their service to the ut­ most of his power, beginning from his substance ;
and, in the second place, from his body;
and, thirdly, from his soul, by paying off the debts due for their care of him, and in favour of those, who gave the pangs of labour as a loan to the young ;
and by returning 2 what has been due a long time to those2 who in old age are greatly in want.
It is requisite likewise through the whole of life for a person to hold and to have held pre-eminently a kind language towards his parents;
because there is 3 for light and winged words a punishment most heavy;
for Nemesis, the messenger of Justice, has been appointed an inspector over all persons in matters of this kind.

It is necessary then to yield to them when in anger, and gratify­ ing their feelings, whether they so conduct themselves by words or deeds, as not being ignorant that a father would very rea­ sonably be exceedingly angry with his son, if he conceived he had been injured by him.
But, on the death of parents, the funeral which is the most moderate is the best;
and (let) not its size exceed what is customary, nor be deficient in those things, which the forefathers made for their parents ;
and on the other hand, let persons pay yearly to such, as have now reached their end, the attention that brings a decoration (to the tomb) ;
and by omitting nothing,5 that contributes to a perpetual re­ membrance, by this especially is there ever an honour, and likewise by a person contributing for the dead a moderate expense, such as is allowed by fortune.
By acting thus, and living thus, we shall each of us on each occasion carry off what is due to us both from the gods and such as are superior to us, and we shall pass the greatest part of our lives in a good hope.
But why1 the person who is doing perfectly what re­ lates to his offspring, and kindred, and friends, and fellow- citizens, and what relates to the rites of hospitality (laid down)2 by the gods, and the intercourse arising from all these matters, ought to make his life a shining ornament according to law, the very course of the laws will (show forth) ;
3 which, by per­ suading some of our habits and punishing by violence and justice others, that do not yield to persuasion, renders our state blessed and happy.
But what it is meet and necessary for a legislator, who thinks as I do, to say, but which when spoken are unfitted to the form of a law, respecting these it appears to me that a person would,4 by bringing forward a pattern both before himself and those, for whom he is about to give laws, and by going through all that remains to the utmost of his ability, make after this a beginning in the laying down of laws.
5 Clin.
Let then such things be laid in some form espe­ cially.
Athen.
But5 it is not a very easy thing to embrace them, as it were in some one form, and to speak of them;
but let us in this way take some method, if perchance we may be able to establish any thing of a firm kind respecting them.
Clin.
Say what method.
Athen.
I should wish them to be very obedient as regards virtue;
and it is evident that the legislator will endeavour to accomplish this through the whole of his legislation.
Clin,
How not ?[9.]
Athen.
What then has been now said appears to me to effect something of moment towards a person listening with a greater mildness and a kinder feeling to what the words re­ commend, provided they do not come in contact with a dispo­ sition altogether savage;
so that should what the words say render the person, who has become if not very much, yet a little more kindly disposed, more docile, we must be quite content.
For there is no great facility1 nor an abundance of those, who feel a desire to become the best to the greatest de­ gree and in the shortest time;
and the many point out Hesiod as a wise person for asserting that the road to wickedness is smooth, and offers itself to be passed through without sweat, as being very short;
but (says he)"
Th' immortal gods have before virtue placed
The sweat of labour, and the road is long
And steep, that to it leads.
At first 'tis rough ;
But when you reach the top, 'tis easy all,2 Although it was all difficult before."
3Clin.
And he appears to be like a person who speaks well.
Athen.
Entirely so.
But what the discourse has done, as it has been going on, I wish to place in the midst of you.
Clin.
Place it then.
Athen.
Let us then say to the legislator, while addressing these words to him—Tell us, Legislator, is it not evident that, if you knew what we ought to do and say, you would have said it ?
Clin.
It is necessarily so.
Athen.
Did we not hear you saying a little before, that a legislator ought not to suffer poets to say what they please ?
For they would not know, that by saying what is contrary to the laws, they would injure the state.
Clin.
You speak truly.
Athen.
If then we should speak in this manner to him in behalf of the poets, would what has been said be in modera­ tion ?
Clin.
In what manner ?A then.
In this.
There is an old story, 0 legislator, which is constantly told by ourselves, and seems correct to all the rest, that a poet, when he sits on the tripod of the Muse, is then not in his right senses, but, like a fountain, readily permits what comes to it to flow out:
1 and as his art is an imitation, he is (often) compelled, when representing persons placed in situa­ tions contrary to each other, to contradict himself frequently, and does not know whether of what is told these or the others are true.
But it is not possible for a legislator to act in this man­ ner in the case of a law, namely 2 (to say) two (different) things about one thing ;
2 but he must always make one assertion about one thing.
And do you so consider it from what has been said just now.
For in the case of a funeral, one being exces­ sive, and another deficient, and a third moderate, you, having chosen one of these, the moderate, order it, and simply praise it.
But if my wife were pre-eminently rich, and should order me to bury her, 31 would celebrate in a poem her magnificent sepulchre;
3 but on the other hand, a parsimonious and poor man (would praise) a deficient one;
but he who possesses moderate means, and is moderate himself (in mind), would praise a moderate one.
But you must not talk, as you did just now, when speaking of the moderate;
but you must tell us what the moderate is, and of what quantity it is;
or do not imagine that a discourse of this kind is a law.
Clin.
You speak most true.[10.]
Athen.
Whether then will he, who is placed by us over the laws, say nothing of this kind at the beginning of his laws, but immediately state what it is meet to do, and what not, and, having threatened a fine, turn himself to another law, and add nothing of exhortation and persuasion I to those, for whom the laws are laid down?
1
2But as in the case of physicians, one is accustomed on each occasion to attend in this way, and another in that, 2 let us call to mind the me­ thod of either, in order that we may beg the legislator, as chil­ dren do a physician, to cure them in the mildest manner.
But what are we saying ?
There are, surely, we say, some persons physicians, and others the ministers of physicians;
and these too we somehow call physicians.
Clin.
Entirely so.A then.
And ( this too), whether they are free-men, or slaves, and possess the art through the injunctions of their masters, both according to theory and experience, but not by nature, just like free-men, (who) 3 have both learnt the art in this way themselves, and are teaching it to their children ?
4
Would you put down these as two kinds of the so-called physicians ?
A then.
Do you then not perceive that when there are both slaves and free-men sick in cities, the slaves do for the most part go round and cure the slaves, or remain in the medical shops ;
and that not one of such physicians either give or re­ ceive any reason respecting each of the diseases of each of the slaves, but, as if knowing accurately from experience, orders, as if he were a self-willed tyrant, what seems good to him;
and then goes away, bounding off from one sick domestic to another;
and by this means affords a facility to his master of attending to (other) patients ?
But the freeborn physician, for the most part, attends to and reflects upon the diseases of the freeborn;
and, by exploring them from the beginning, and according to nature, and communing with both the patient himself and his friends, does, at the same time, learn something himself from the sick, and at the same time teach him, as far as he can, something, and does not order him any thing until he has persuaded him of its propriety;
and then, after render­ ing the patient gentle by persuasion, endeavours to finish the business by bringing him (back)1 to health.
Which of these is the better physician ?
he who cures in this way or in that?
2 [and which is the better exerciser?
he who exercises in this way or that?]
2 he, who effects his single power in a twofold manner, or he, who works it out in one way, and in the worse and the more rustic of the two ?
Clin.
The twofold, 0 guest, is surely the superior.
Athen.
Are you willing then for us to look into this two­ fold and simple method, as it exists in legislation ?
Clin.
How am I not willing ?[11.]
Athen.
Come then, by the gods, (and state) what law will the legislator first lay down?
Will he not, according to nature, regulate by his ordinances first the commencement of generation3 relating to states ?
Athen.
Is not the connexion by and communion of mar­ riages the commencement of generation in all cities ?
Athen.
The laws then of marriage being first laid down correctly, seem to be laid down for correct conduct in every state.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
Let us then first speak of the simple law, which would perhaps exist somehow in this way ;
that a man is to marry when he is from thirty to thirty-five years old;
but if he does not, that he should be fined both in money and with the loss of political privileges;
1 in money to this or that amount, and in disfranchisement of this or that kind.
Let this then be the simple law respecting marriages;
but this the twofold;
that a man is to marry from thirty to thirty-five years old, considering that the human race has in some mea­ sure partaken naturally of immortality, of which every one has naturally every desire.
2
For to become famous, and not to lie when dead without a name, is the desire of a person of this kind.
The human race then is a thing connected with all time, and follows and will follow it to the end, becoming in this manner immortal through that, which is ever the same and one, partaking by generation of immortality, in conse­ quence of its leaving3 children's children.
Now for a man to deprive himself willingly of this, is by no means holy;
and he intentionally deprives himself of this, who has no care for children and a wife.
He, therefore, who obeys this Jaw would depart without a fine.
But let him, on the other hand, who does not obey it, and does not marry when he is thirty- five years of age, be fined yearly so and so, in order that his solitary life may not seem to bring him gain and an easy state ;
nor let him share in those honours, which the younger in the state pay on every occasion to the elder.
It is then in the power of a person, who hears this law compared with that, to form an idea of each particular law, whether it ought to become in this way double, and the longest4 in length through its mingling threats with persuasions ;
or by employ­ ing threats alone, it ought to become simple in length.
Megil.
It is the Laconic practice, 0 guest, to prefer ever the shorter method.
But should any one order me to become a judge of such enactments, which of the two I would wish to be written and laid down for a state, I would prefer the longer;
and as regards every law according to this model, if two such were proposed, I should make the same choice.
It is, how­ ever, requisite that the present legislation should be agreeable to Clinias;
for his is the state, which is now thinking of making use of laws of this kind.
Clin.
Well have you spoken, Megillus.[12.]
Athen.
To take any account of enactments either prolix or brief is very silly.
1 For we must honour, I con­ ceive, the best, but not the shortest, nor (look to) their length.
1
But, in the laws which we have just now spoken of, one dif­ fers from the other not by the double alone as regards the value of their use;
but that, which was said just now, re­ specting the twofold kind of physicians, was most properly adduced.
To this point however no legislator seems at any time to have given a thought, that, when it is possible to make use of two things in legislation, persuasion and force, they employ the other alone,2 as far as is possible, against the masses unexperienced in education.
For they legislate, not mingling a fight3 with force, but (employing) unmingled vio­ lence alone.
But I, 0 blessed men, perceive that a third thing likewise ought to exist with regard to laws, but which does not exist at present.
Clin.
Of what kind are you speaking ?
Athen.
Of something, which has arisen, through a certain god-send, out of the matters we have just now discussed.
For from the time when we began to speak about laws in the morning, mid-day has now arrived ;
and we have been in this very beautiful retreat discoursing upon no other topic than laws.
But we seem to me to be just now beginning to speak about laws ;
and that all before has been a prelude to laws.
1
Now why have I mentioned this ?
It is because I wished to say, that in all discourses, and whatever else partake of a vocal sound, there are both preludes and, as it were, movements backwards and forwards,2 that possess some artificial hand­ ling, useful to that which is about to be gone through.
And, indeed, of the laws, as they are called, of guitar-songs and of every kind of music, preludes are laid down composed with wondrous care.
But of laws really so, which we say are po­ litical, no one has ever at any time made any mention of their preludes, nor, as being a composer, has he brought it to light, as if it did not naturally exist.
But our present discussion, as it seems to me, indicates that it does exist;
and the laws, which were just now mentioned as twofold, have seemed to be3 not surely thus twofold simply, but there (have seemed) to be some two things, law and a prelude to a law;
but the tyrannical injunction, which was spoken of as being similar to the orders of slave-physicians, (has appeared) to be an un­ mingled law ;
but that, which was spoken of prior to this, and called persuasive by this person here, (seemed) to be in reality persuasive, but to have the power of a prelude, relating to dis­ courses.
For in order that the person, to whom the legislator addresses his law, may receive kindly, and, through his kind­ ness, with more docility, the injunction, which is the law, on this account the whole of this discourse has appeared to me to have been spoken;
4 which the speaker has spoken persuad­ ing.
4
Hence, according to my reasoning, this very thing would be properly called a prelude to a law, but not a dis­ cussion of it.
What then, after saying this, should I wish to be stated subsequently?
It is this;
1 that the legislator ought ever prior to all laws to make them not without a share of preludes;
and as regards each law, in so far as they differ from themselves, as much as the two just now mentioned have differed.
1Clin.
For my part, 2 I would never exhort 2 a man, skilled in these things, to lay down laws in any other manner.
Athen.
You appear therefore to me, 0 Clinias, to speak correctly, so far that there is a prelude to all laws;
and that it is requisite for a person commencing the business of legis­ lation, to prefer to every discourse a preface, that is natural to each.
For that, which is to be said after this, is not a thing of little moment, nor is it a trifling difference, whether they are stated clearly or not clearly.
However, if we should enjoin upon legislators to make a prelude equally about what are called great and small laws, we should not speak 3 correctly.
For this is not to be done either in every song or in every discourse;
since, though it naturally belongs to all, yet it is not to be used for all;
and a thing of this kind is to be allowed to the orator, the lyric singer, and the legislator.
Clin.
You appear to me to speak most true.
But let us make a no further exercise of delay, but return to the ques­ tion, and begin, if it is agreeable to you, from those points, which you did, as a person not preluding, speak of at that time.
Again then, as persons say, when playing,4 since se­ cond things are better, let us turn up and back from the be- ginning, as finishing a prelude, and not an accidental discourse, as just now.
Let us take then their commencement1 acknow­ ledging that we are preluding.
And what has been just now stated, respecting the honours to be paid to the gods, and the attention due to ancestors, is sufficient.
But let us endeavour to speak about what is next in order, until it shall appear to you that the whole prelude has been spoken of sufficiently.
And after this you will go through detailing the laws them­ selves.
Athen.
About the gods, then, and those that come after them,2 and parents, both when living and dead, we made sum­ ciently then a prelude, as we call it now ;
but the portion that still remains of this kind of a subject, you appear to exhort me to lead forth into the light.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
And after these matters, how it is necessary for per­ sons to keep their souls, and bodies, and substance with refer­ ence to serious pursuits and remissions (of labour), and fitting too for both the speaker and the hearers to ruminate3 in com­ mon, and to become, to the utmost of their power, successful in attaining instruction.
These very matters then must in reality4 be spoken of and heard by us after those.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.[1.]
Athen.
LET every one then hear, who has already heard what we have said respecting the gods, and our dear progenitors.
For a man's soul is, after the gods, the most divine of all his possessions, as being most his own.
Now the whole of a man's possessions are altogether twofold.
The more powerful and the better are the lords, but the weaker and worse, the slaves.
Of those then that are his the lord must always be held in honour before the slaves.
Hence after the gods, who are lords, and those that follow next to them, I properly exhort a person 1 to honour his own soul by speaking of it as the second in rank.
But not one, so to say, honours his soul properly, although he appears (to do so).
For honour is somehow a divine good;
but of things that are evil not one is honourable.
He then, who fancies that he shall enlarge his soul by certain discourses or gifts or certain yield­ ings, and yet does not make it better from being worse, ap­ pears indeed to honour it, but by no means does so.
For in­ stance, 2 every boy on becoming a man thinks himself competent to know all things,2 and that he honours his soul by praising it, and he freely permits it to do whatever it pleases.
But 3we now say3 that he, who acts so, injures and does not honour (his soul).
And yet it is necessary, as we have said, (to honour) it in the second rank after the gods.
Nor, when a man does not consider himself, but others, as the cause of his own errors and of ills the most in number and mag­ nitude, and ever exempts himself as free from blame, is he honouring his own soul, as he forsooth fancies;
for he is far from doing so;
since he injures it;
nor when 4contrary to reason, and the praise of the legislator he indulges in plea­ sures, does he honour it all;
but he dishonours it, by filling it with vice and repentance.
Nor yet when, on the contrary, he does not thoroughly labour by bearing up against exertions that receive praise, and against fears and pains, but sinks under them;
for 1 by sinking he then dishonours it;
for he causes it to be in dishonour by doing all these acts..
Nor does he honour it, when he thinks that to live is altogether a good:
for then too he dishonours it.
For while his soul imagines that every thing in Hades is evil, he yields, nor does he strive against it by teaching and convincing it that it does not know whether, on the contrary, that, what relates to the gods there is not the greatest of all good to us.
Nor yet, when any one honours beauty before virtue, is this any other thing than truly and wholly a dishonour to the soul.
For such an assertion falsely proclaims that the body is more honourable than the soul.
For nothing born of earth is more honourable than what is in Olympus;
and he, who thinks otherwise of the soul, is ignor­ ant that he is careless of this wonderful possession.
Nor when a person, who desires to possess wealth not honourably, or when possessing (unjustly), 2 does not bear it ill, does he then honour his soul with gifts ?
He fails3 of it entirely.
For he sells what is honourable and at the same time beautiful in his soul for a little gold;
for all the gold both on the earth and under the earth is of no value against virtue.
And, to speak comprehensively, he, who is neither willing by every contrivance to abstain from such things, as the legislator numbers up and ranks amongst the disgraceful and bad, nor, on the other hand, to pursue to the utmost of his power the good and the honour­ able, does not perceive that, in all these cases, he treats his soul, which is a thing the most divine, with the greatest dis­ honour, and in the most unseemly manner.
For not one, so to say, considers what is the greatest of the so-called1 punish­ ment for evil conduct.
Now the greatest is in the becoming similar to bad men;
and by becoming similar, to avoid good men and good discourses, and to be cut off from them, but to be glued to (the bad),2 while 3 pursuing according to their in­ tercourse ;
3 and sticking close to such persons, he must of ne­ cessity do and suffer what such persons naturally do and say to each other.
Such a state then is not one of justice, for the beautiful is just [and justice],4 but of punishment, the at­ tendant on a state5 of injustice, with which both he, who does meet, and he, who does not meet, are miserable ;
the one in not being cured;
the other in being destroyed, in order that many may be saved.
But to us it is an honour, to speak generally, to follow the better and to make the worse, still6 capable of becoming better, the best possible.[2.]
There is not then a possession belonging to a man more naturally fitted, than the soul, to flying from evil, and 7 to tracking out and taking7 what is of all things the best;
nor, when it has taken it, to associate with it for the rest of life.
Hence it has been ranked second in honour;
but the third- every one will understand this at least-is the honour, accord­ ing to nature, of the body.
It is however requisite to consider these honours, which of them are genuine, and which with a false stamp.
8
Now this is the business of a legislator.
And he appears to me to point out that they are these and some such as these;
8 that the body is honourable, not when it pos- sesses beauty, or strength, or swiftness, or size, or health— although this would seem so to many-nor even when it pos­ sesses the contraries to these.
But those things which, being in the middle, touch upon the whole of this possessing,1 are by far the most moderate and safe.
2
For the former cause the soul to be puffed up and confident, but the latter humble and servile.
And similarly situated is the possession of 3money and means,3 according to the same measure of valuation.
4
For an excess in the bulk of all these things produces enmity and revolts, both in states and amongst individuals ;
but a defi­ ciency (produces) slavery for the most part.
Let not then any one be desirous of riches for the sake of his children, in order that he may leave them very wealthy;
for this is better neither for them nor the state.
For the substance of the young is not the prey of flatterers;
and if it is not in want of the necessaries of life, it is the most harmonious and the best of all.
For by its harmony and fitness in all things it renders our life free from pain.
It is meet then to leave to children abundance of modesty, not of gold.
And we think we 5 shall accomplish this5 by reproving impudent young men, when they act shamelessly.
This, however, is not effected by the ex­ hortation given at present to young men ;
which persons give by saying that it is meet to be modest in every thing;
but a prudent legislator will rather advise old men to feel a shame be­ fore the young ;
and above all things to take care, that no young person, at any time, either sees or hears them doing or saying any thing base;
since where old men are shameless, there too must young men of necessity be the most impudent;
for the most ex­ cellent education both of the young and of themselves is, not in giving advice, but in being seen to do through the whole of life, what a person would say, while giving advice to another.
But he who honours and venerates his relationship and the whole communion G of family gods, that possess the nature of the same bloody will have, according to reason, the gods who preside over births favourably disposed towards him for the procreation of children.
And moreover, be will obtain the kind feeling of friends and associates in the intercourse of life, by considering their attentions to himself as of a greater and more respectful kind than they do;
but his own favours to them less than his friends and associates do themselves.
As regards, however, the state and fellow-citizens, he is by far the best, who prefers before the contests at Olympia and all in war and peace, to be victorious in the glory of being the servant of the laws at home, I [as having been subservient to them] I in a manner the most beautiful of all men through (the whole of)2 life.
We must consider too the laws of intercourse3 with strangers to be matters of the most holy kind.
For nearly all the delinquencies of strangers towards strangers depend more upon an avenging deity 4 than do those in the case of fellow- citizens.
4
For a stranger being destitute of companions and kindred, is an object of greater pity both to men and gods.
He therefore, who is more able to take vengeance, is more ready to assist.
Now the 5 Dæmon of each person, and the god of hospitality, are as the attendants upon Zeus, who presides over strangers, powerful in the greatest degree.
It is then a mat­ ter of much caution for a person, to whom there is even a little portion of forethought, to proceed on to the end of life, without having committed any error with regard to strangers.
But, of all the crimes done by strangers and denizens, the greatest is that which takes place in the case of each towards sup­ pliants.
For the god, with whom the suppliant happens to have met, as a witness to agreements made with a suppliant, be­ comes himself pre-eminently the guardian of the sufferer.
1 2 So that no one, who injures suppliants, will go unpunished.2[3.]
Thus then have we nearly gone through the modes of intercourse3 relating to parents, and to a person himself, and the things belonging to him, and those relating to the state, and friends, and kinsmen, and strangers, and natives.
But as to what follows how a person by being what can best pass through life, (it is meet)4 to detail, not what a law, but what praise and blame may, by teaching individuals, render them more obedient to the rein, and more kindly disposed to the laws about to be established.
These then are the matters we must subsequently speak of.
Now truth is the leader of every good both to gods and men ;
of which he, who is about to be blessed and fortunate, should participate immediately from the begin­ ning, in order that for the greatest length of time he may live a person of truth.
For he is trust-worthy;
but he is not trust­ worthy, by whom a voluntary falsehood is loved ;
while he, by whom an involuntary one is so, is a senseless person ;
of which states neither is an object of envy.
For he, who is not trust­ worthy and untaught, is unloved;
and as time progresses to­ wards morose old age, he becomes known, and at the end of life has prepared for himself a solitude complete;
so that, whether his associates and children are alive or not, his life becomes nearly equally an orphanhood.
He however who does no injury is held in honour;
but he, who does not suffer the unjust to act unjustly, deserves more than double the honour of the former person.
For the former has a value equal to one man;
but the latter to many others,1 by pointing out to the rulers the injustice of the rest.
But let him, who unites with the rulers in inflicting punishments to the utmost of his power, be proclaimed the great man in a state, and the complete victor, if ever one was,2 in virtue.
The very same praise it is meet to proclaim of temperance and prudence;
and the person, who possesses other goods, that have a power not only for him to possess them himself, but to share them with others, it is meet to honour, as being at the tip-top (of excel­ lence) ;
but him, who is unable, although willing, to put aside in the second rank;
and to blame indeed the man who is envious and unwilling through friendship3 to be a sharer of any of his good things with any one;
but not to hold a jot the more in dishonour his possession on account of the possessor, but to acquire it with all one's might.
Let then every one contend with us for virtue unstintingly.
For such a person advances a state by striving himself, and not cutting down others through calumny.
But the envious man, while he thinks to become the superior by detracting from others, tends less himself to true virtue, and makes his competitors disheartened through their being blamed unjustly;
and by these means causing the whole state to be untrained for the contests of virtue, he renders it, as far as he can, of less account as regards its renown.
It is proper, moreover, for every man to possess a spirit, and yet to be as mild as possible.
For it is not possible to avoid the unjust acts of others, which are harsh and difficult to be cured, or entirely incurable, otherwise than by fighting and con­ quering, after defending oneself, and by remitting nothing, when in the act of punishing.
Now to do this every soul is unable, without possessing a noble spirit.
With respect to the acts of those, who do an injury that admits of a cure, it is requisite to know, in the first place, 'that no unjust man is voluntarily unjust.'
For no one would at any time willingly possess any of the greatest evils, and least of all in the case of the most honoured belonging to him­ self.
Now the soul, as we have said, is in truth a thing the most honoured by.
all.
No one, therefore, would at any time volun­ tarily receive the greatest evil in the thing most honoured, and live through the whole of life possessing it.
But the unjust man and he who has what are evils, is in every respect an object of pity.
It is proper, however, to pity him, who has an evil that is curable, and to restrain and soften down one's anger, and not, like a woman with an excess of passion, to continue em­ bittered against him.
But it is meet to let loose one's anger against a person incontinently 2 sinful, and past all exhortation depraved.
On which account we have said that the good man ought to be conspicuous3 for possessing a spirit, and yet to be on each occasion mild.[4.]
But of all evils the greatest is implanted in the souls of the major part of mankind;
for which, while each one is giving himself a pardon, he devises no plan for avoiding it.
And this is what people4 say;
that every man is naturally a friend to himself, and that it is well for a thing of this kind to be necessarily so.
But, in truth, the cause of all his mis­ takes arises to each man, upon each occasion, through the violent love of self.
For the lover is blinded with respect to the ob­ ject loved.
5
So that he judges improperly of things just, and good, and beautiful, through thinking that he ought always to honour what belongs to himself in preference to truth.
For it is necessary that he, who is to be a great man, should love neither himself, nor the things belonging to himself, but what is just, whether it happens to be done by himself or by another person rather.
1
From this very same mistake it has come to pass in all cases that his ignorance appears to a person to be a wisdom peculiarly his own.
Hence, although we know, so to say, nothing, we fancy we know every thing;
but, by not permitting others to do that, of which we ourselves are ignorant, we are compelled to make mistakes through doing it ourselves.
On this account every man ought to avoid the vehement love of himself, and ever2 to follow one better than himself, without placing, in a matter of this kind, a feeling of shame in the foreground.
But what are of less importance than these, and mentioned frequently, and not less useful than these, it is proper for a person to remind himself of and to state.
For, as something is always flowing away from us, it is necessary for something on the contrary to be flowing (to us).
Now recollection3 is the influx of thoughts, which had left us.
On which account4 it is meet to abstain from ill-timed laughter, and tears;
and for every man to announce to every man that he must endeavour, by concealing 5 all excessive joy and all ex­ cessive sorrow, to preserve a decent bearing, 6 each person, while his Daemon is standing steadily, going on successfully or unsuc­ cessfully to places on high and steep, while Daemons are opposing with certain disturbances ;
6 and thatit is meet ever1 to hope that the deity will, when troubles fall upon the good state, which he has given, make them less instead of greater, and (cause) a change from the present state to a better one;
and with respect to 3 [good things] 3 the contraries of these, that they will always be present to them4 with good fortune.
In these hopes it is meet for every one to live, and in the recollection of all these things to be sparing on no point, but ever amidst serious and spor­ tive occupations to remind another and himself clearly.5[5.]
Now then there have been mentioned nearly (all), as far as divine things are concerned, respecting the pursuits, to which every one ought to attend, and respecting each individual himself, of what kind he ought to be;
but matters relating to man have not been at present spoken of.
But it is necessary (to speak of them):
for we are conversing with men, and not with gods.
Now pleasures, and pains, and desires, are naturally in the highest degree human ;
on which it is necessary for the whole mortal animal to bang, as it were, 6 [and to be sus­ pended] 6 with the greatest earnestness.
It is requisite then to praise the most beautiful life, not only because by its form it is superior, as regards fair renown ;
but because, if any one is will­ ing to taste of it, and not, as being young, to become a deserter from it, it excels in that too, of which we all are in search, (I mean) the possessing more of joy and less of sorrow through the whole of life.
That this will be clearly the case, if any one tastes of it correctly, will readily and vehemently appear.
Now what is this correctness?
This it is requisite to ascertain from the reasoning, and to consider whether it is produced accord­ ing to nature in this way, or in another, contrary to nature.
It is requisite therefore to consider in this manner one life, as compared with another, if it be more pleasant and more pain- ful.
We wish for pleasure to be present with us ;
but we neither choose nor wish for pain.
But what is neither the one or the other we do not wish for in the place of pleasure ;
but we do wish for it to be exchanged in the place of pain.
We wish too for less pain with more pleasure ;
but we do not wish for less pleasure with greater pain.
But we can show clearly that we do not wish to possess each of these, equal in the place of equals.
All these differ in multitude and magni­ tude and intensity and equality, and in whatever things are the contrary to all these, with respect to wishing ;
but I with respect to the choice of each, 1 they do not differ.
Since then these things have been thus arranged by necessity, we wish for that life, in which the many and great and intense of each kind exist, but in which pleasures exceed;
but we do not wish for that life, in which the contraries to these exist.
And on the other hand, the life in which things few and little and quiet exist, but in which pains exceed, we do not wish for;
but we wish for that life in which the contraries to these exist.
2
And again, the life, in which the balance is equal, as we said before, it is meet to consider as an equal-balanced life ;
2 since we wish for the life, which exceeds 3 in what is agreeable to us;
but we do not wish for that (which exceeds) in what is disagree­ able.
4
Now it is necessary to consider all our lives as natur­ ally bound up in these;
and 5 [it is necessary to consider] 5 what kind (of lives) we naturally wish for.
And if we say, that we wish for any thing except these, we say so through an ignorance of, and inexperience in, lives as they exist.[6.]
What then and of what kind are the lives, respecting which it is necessary for a person to know something,l while forecasting 2 what is to be wished for and is voluntary, and what is to be not wished for and is involuntary ;
and,3 after prescribing a law to himself, to choose what is agreeable and pleasant and the best and the most beautiful, and to lead a life as far as possible, the most happy for man ?
Let us then call one life temperate, another prudent, another brave, and rank one as healthy ;
4 and four others, the contraries to these four, by the name of the imprudent, the cowardly, the intemperate, and the diseased.
He, then, who knows the temperate, will lay it down as mild in all things, and exhibiting quiet pains, and quiet pleasures, and placid desires, and loves not insane;
but the intemperate as being impetuous in all things, and exhi­ biting vehement pains, and vehement pleasures, and desires on the stretch and goaded on, and loves the maddest possible ;
and that in a temperate life the pleasures exceed the pains ;
but in an intemperate one the pains (exceed) the pleasures in magnitude and multitude and intensity.
Hence, the one of these lives hap­ pens of necessity to be according to nature more pleasant to us, but the other more painful;
and it is no longer in the power of him, who wishes to live pleasantly, to live voluntarily in an intemperate manner;
but it is evident, if what has been said is correct, that every licentious person is of necessity so unwillingly.
For the whole mass of mankind live in the want of temperance, either through the want of teaching, or through incontinence, or through both.
The same things are to be considered respecting a diseased and healthy life, that they possess pleasures and pains, but that the pleasures ex­ ceed the pains in health, but the pains the pleasures in ill­ ness.
Our wish however in the choice of lives is not that pain may exceed, but, where it is exceeded, that life we have de­ cided to be the more pleasant.
Now the [temperate man],' we would say, possesses in both respects things fewer, and less, and slighter than [the intemperate], and the prudent than the imprudent, and the man of bravery than the one of timidity, each exceeding each on the score of pleasures;
but on that of pains, 2 the former exceeding the latter,2 the brave man has the victory over the timid, and in that of the prudent the im­ prudent;
so that 3 of the lives, the more pleasant are the tem­ perate, and the brave, and the prudent, and the healthy, than the timid, and imprudent, and intemperate, and the diseased ;
3 and in short, the life which is connected with virtue, pertaining either to the body or the soul, is more pleasant than the life which is connected with depravity, and is superior even to superfluity in the other points, such as beauty and rectitude and virtue and fair renown ;
so that it causes the person, who possesses it, to live more happily in every respect and totally, than he (who possesses) the contrary (life).4[7.]
5Let then the prelude of the laws, having been here spoken of, have an end of the speeches.
5
But after the prelude it is necessary somehow for the strain to follow ;
or rather, in good truth, to write down the laws of a polity.
As then it is not possible, in the case of a web, or any other tissue what­ ever, to work up the weft and the warp from the same mate­ rials, but there must needs be a difference as regard their quality in the production of the warp, by being some of it strong and assuming a firmness through the spindle,2 and another part of it softer and 3making use of a just easiness ;
3 from whence 4 it is meet that those, who are about to hold great offices in the state, should be judged of separately in this way, and those too, who have been tested in a trifling education, on each occasion according to reason.
For there are two kinds of polities, one relating to the appointment of offices to each individual, and the other relating to the laws assigned to the offices.
But before all it is requisite to consider things of this kind.
A shepherd, and a herdsman, and a breeder of horses, and whatever else there are of this kind of occupations, will, after receiving the whole herd, never attempt to attend to them otherwise than by first applying a purification suited to their individual living together;
and having by a selection separated the healthy and diseased, and the well-bred and ill-bred, he will send away one part to some other herds, but attend upon the other part, thoroughly perceiving that his labour would be in vain and non-effective as regards both the body and soul,5 which after nature and improper aliment had corrupted, 6they moreover destroy the race of healthy and unmixed habits and bodies in each of the flocks, unless a person purifies what is present in them.
6
The attention, however, which is paid to other animals is indeed less, and is alone worthy to be brought forward for the sake of an example.
But the affairs of men (need) the greatest attention on the part of the legislator, to investigate and detail what is suited to each individual, as re­ gards purification and all other actions.
For instance, that which relates to the purification of a state should be in this way.
Of many existing purifications, some are rather easy, but others more difficult;
and he who is both a tyrant and a legislator may be able to use such purifications as are difficult and the best.
But the legislator, who without being a tyrant lays down a new polity and laws, would, if he were able to purify with the mildest of purifications, do a thing of this kind contentedly.
1
The best purification is however painful;
just as are the remedies of some such kind, which leading for justice to punishment with avenging,1 put death or exile as the finish to punishment.
For it is wont to free the city from those, who have erred the greatest, and who, as be­ ing incurable, are the greatest hurt to the state.
But with us there is a milder purification of this kind.
For upon these, who, having nothing themselves, do, through the want of food, ex­ hibit themselves as prepared to follow their leaders in an attack upon the property of persons, who possess something, upon such, as being naturally a disease in the state, it imposes a removal, under the name, by way of good omen, of a colony, and sends them away in the kindest possible manner.
This then should somehow be done at the very commencement by every one legislating.
To us however what is still more strange than this has now happened relating to these.
For there is no need to devise either a colony or any selection for a purification;
but as if the waters, partly from fountains and partly from moun­ tain torrents, were flowing together into one lake, it is neces­ sary for persons to be on the watch, that, partly by pumping out, and partly by drawing off into channels, and partly by diverting its course, the water flowing together may be the most clear.
But labour and danger, as it appears, are to be found in every political establishment.
However, since what is now done exists in discourse, and not in action, let our selection be held to be completed, and the purification to have taken place according to our notions.
For having by every kind of persuasion and for a sufficient length of time tried by a test those amongst evil men, who were endeavouring to enter our city in order to administer it, let us prevent them from reaching it, and let us introduce the good, (rendering them)1 well-disposed and propitious to the utmost of our power.[8.]
Let not, however, the good fortune, which has happened, lie hid from us, that, as we said that the colony of the Heraclidæ was fortunate, because it escaped the dreadful and dangerous strife respecting the division of land and the abolition of debts,2 in which strife 3 it is impossible for a state, compelled to be re­ gulated by law, to leave any of its ancient institutions undis­ turbed, nor on the other hand is it possible to disturb them after a certain manner (successfully),4 (the same thing appears nearly to have happened to us) ;
5 and there is left merely, so to say, a prayer,6 and a trifling change to those making a slight alteration cautiously7 and slowly in a great length of time ;
8 which alteration should take place by those persons innovat- ing, who have an abundance of land, and have likewise many debtors, and are willing through a kind consideration to share with those in want, partly by giving up (debts) and partly by distributing (property), and by holding to moderation, and by thinking that poverty does not consist in a diminution of pro­ perty, but in an insatiable desire to acquire more.
For this is the greatest beginning of safety to a state;
and upon this, as upon a stable foundation, it is possible to build up what­ ever political arrangement.
any one would raise up, befitting a constitution of this kind.
But when the change is of an unsound kind, no political movement will afterwards take place easily in a state.
1 From this, as we have said, we fly.
It would however have been more correct to have said in what way, if we have not fled from it, we might have made for ourselves the flight.
Let it then be said how that through not being fond of money together with justice;
but there is no other escape, either broad or narrow, of such a plan1.
Let this then be laid down by us as 2 a prop of a stated
For it is necessary that (the citizens)3 should somehow raise up for themselves their property without reproach from each other;
4or, that they should not be willing to proceed pre­ viously to the before of the rest of the constitution,4 who have accusations of old standing against each other, and to whom there is even a small share of intellect.
But for those persons, to whom a god has given, as it has to us at present, to settle a new state, and for 1 no enmities to exist1 against each other, to become 2themselves the cause of enmities to each other2 through the division of the land and dwellings, would be a not­ human want of education, united to every kind of wickedness.
What then would be the method of a correct distribution ?
In the first place, it is requisite to fix3 the same quantity 3 of the number, 4 how great it ought to be.
4
After this it must be agreed respecting the distribution to the citizens, into how many and what kind of parts it is to be made by them for the mass of peo­ ple.
And for this purpose the land and dwellings must be distri­ buted as equally as possible.
Now a sufficient quantity of the mass of people cannot be correctly stated otherwise than with reference to the land and cities of neighbouring nations.
As regards5 the land, how much of it is sufficient to feed how many temperate persons6—for of more there is no need-but as re­ gards the number, how many would be able to defend them­ selves 7not altogether without resources7 against bordering tribes acting unjustly, and to assist their neighbours when in­ jured.
Having then viewed these points, we will define both by deed and word the land and neighbours.
But now, for the sake of a sketch and outline,1 that the thing itself may be accomplished, let the discourse proceed to our laying down the laws.
Let the land-owners and those that defend the distribution of the land, be, for the sake of a fitting number, five thousand and forty;
and let, in like manner, the land and the dwellings be distributed into the same portions, 2 so that the man and his portion may accord in distribution.
2
And in the first place, let there be of the whole number two parts distributed, and afterwards three of the same ;
3 for it is by nature (divi­ sible) into four and five, and so in succession as far as ten.
Thus much ought every person, who is legislating, to under­ stand respecting number, what it is, and what kind will be the most useful to all states.
Let us then say it is that, which possesses in itself the greatest quantity of divisions and most in orderly succession.
For the whole number does (not)4 obtain by lot all kinds of divisions for all things.
But the number five thousand and forty, in matters relating to war and whatever in peace have to do with conventions and communions, and relating to revenue and distributions, cannot be cut into more than sixty parts wanting one;
but there are continuous divi­ sions of it from one up to ten.[9.]
These things however it is meet for those to take in hand' firmly at leisure,5 on whom the law enjoins to take them;
for they cannot exist otherwise than in this manner.
But it is requisite for them to be mentioned to a person settling a state for the sake of this;
that no one, whether he is making a (polity) new from the beginning, or patching up an ancient one that has been corrupted, will, if he has any mind, attempt to disturb, with respect to the gods or sacred rites, and whatever else ought to be established in the state for each of the gods or daemons, by whatever name they may be called, what­ ever (has come)1 from Delphi or Dodona 2 or Ammon,3 or what 4 certain old accounts have somehow persuaded persons on hear­ ing them, when, through visions having occurred or an inspira­ tion from gods having been declared,4 parties have, through be­ ing persuaded,5 established sacrifices mixed up with mystic cere­ monies, (emanating) either from their own country, (or) being exotic 6 from Tyrrhenia,7 or Cyprus,8 or any other place what- ever ;
and from these ancient accounts and oracles they con­ secrated statues, and altars, and temples, and made for each of the deities a sacred grove.
Of all these not even the least must the legislator disturb;
but he must assign to each of the portions a god, a dæmon, or some hero.
And in the division of the land, he must give up, selected for the first in rank, the groves and all that is fitting, so that the assemblies of each of the portions, taking place at stated times, may furnish resources against their wants, and during the sacrifices kindly entertain, and become familiar with, and recognise, each other.
1
For there is no greater good to a state than for persons to be the ac­ quaintances of each other.
Since where there is no light2 to each other in the manners of each other, but a darkness, there no one will properly meet with the honour due to his worth, nor with offices, nor even with the justice which is fitting.
3It is meet then for every man in all states to be earnest in this matter, compared as one with one,3 that he never appear to any one to be of a base stamp, but always artless and true, and that no other person of that kind4 deceive him.
But the next movement, as in the case5 of the pebble-game, from the sacred spot would, as being unusual, cause, in the ease of legislation, the person who hears of it for the first time perhaps to wonder.
To him however who has reasoned upon, and tried it, it will appear that the state is in a second way settled for the best.
Perhaps however some one will not re­ ceive the movement, through its not being customary with a tyrannic legislator.
It will1 however be most correct to speak of the best polity, and of the second and third, and then to leave the choice to each person, 2 who is the lord in the co­ settlement.
2
Let us act then even now according to this very method, by speaking of a polity the first, and the second, and the third in worth ;
and let us leave the choice to Clinias at present, and to any one else who may be willing to come to the selection of such polities, and to assign, according to his own method, 3 that which is agreeable to him (with respect to) his own country.3[10.]
Now the first state and polity and the best laws are there, where the old saying may be most in vogue through the whole state;
for4 it said that, amongst friends all things are really in common.
This saying, whether it now is or ever will be (practised), 5that women are in common, and children in common, and all possessions in common,5 has taken away6 by every means every where and entirely from life what is called private property;
and it has planned that things even naturally private, as far as possible, become by some means in common ;
such as the eyes, the ears, and the hands, in seeming1 to see, and hear, and work, in common;
and that, again, all men taken singly2 praise and blame as much as possible (the same things), 3rejoicing in, and pained by,3 the same things;
4 and (hence) no one (has) ever laid down or will lay down a definition more correct and better (than this), that of such laws as cause a state to be as much as possible one, (there is) the superiority on the ground of virtue.
4
Such a state will ours5 be, whether gods or the children of gods, more in number than one,6 dwell there,7 and with delight save and regulate 8those living in that manner.
8
Hence it is proper to reflect upon the pattern of a polity in no other way;
but, sticking to this, to seek that, which is as much as possible of such a kind.
But that, which we have now taken in hand, would,9 if it ex- isted at all, be the nearest to immortality;
and if it is 1not in the first rank, it will be at least one in the second..
After this we will, god willing, go through the polity, which is the third in order.
But now let us speak of this polity, what it is, and how it may be produced.
In the first place, let them distribute the land and houses.
But let them not cultivate the ground in common ;
since a thing of this kind is spoken of as greater than is suited to their present birth, nurture, and education.
Let them however distribute land and houses with somehow such an intention as this, that each on obtaining his allotment ought to consider it as being common to the whole state;
and, as this country is their pa­ ternal land, they ought to attend to it in a greater degree than children do their mother, in that, being a goddess, she is the sovereign mistress of mortals.
The same conceptions they ought to have of the gods of the place, and likewise of dæmons.
But that these things may exist in this manner through all time, on this too they must thoroughly reflect.
As many hearths as are distributed by us at present, so many must there be always, and neither more nor less.
Now a thing of this kind will be firmly established through every state in this way.
Let the person, who has obtained his allotment, leave ever the child, who is most dear to him, the only heir of his household, and his successor, and the attendant upon the gods and family and state, and of those still living, and of such as their end has already reached up to the then period.
But with respect to the other children, they, to whom there are more than one, must give their daughters in marriage according to a law to be laid down ;
but distribute their male children as sons to those, who have no family, as an act of kindness conferred ;
but if there be a lack of kindness, or if more females are born than some2 males, or the contrary, when they are fewer, through barrenness taking place, let the magistrate,3 whom we shall lay down as the greatest and most honourable, consider what is proper to be done with the superabundance and deficiency of children, and devise a method by which five thousand and forty households alone may exist always.
Now there are many methods.
For there are checks to procreation when it is over­ flowing ;
1 and, on the contrary, care and an attention to the number of births do, by means of honours, and disqualifica­ tions, and 2the advice of elders to young persons, meet (the difficulty), and are able to effect what we are speaking of [by admonitory discourses].
2 3 Moreover, should at last every difficulty arise about the inequality of the five thousand and forty households,3 and an excessive influx of citizens take place through the kind feelings of those, who dwell together, and we come to want, there remains the old contrivance, which we have often mentioned, of friendly colonies being sent out from friends, whithersoever it may appear to be suitable.
But if, on the contrary, there should at any time come4 a wave bringing an inundation,5 or 6 a destruction arising from plagues or wars, and the people become, through a state of orphan­ hood, much less than the prescribed number, we must not willingly introduce citizens educated in a not legitimate disci­ pline ;
but7 to use force against necessity it is said not even a god has the power.7[11.]
This then let us assert our present discourse advises, by saying—O ye best of all men, do not relax in honouring simili­ tude and equality and the same and what is generally acknow­ ledged according to nature and according to number and all the power of things beautiful and good.
2
And now guard, in the first place, through the whole of life the above-mentioned number ;
next, do not hold in dishonour 3 the height and magnitude of3 the property, which ye first distributed, as being moderate, by buy­ in,, from, and selling to, each other.
For neither 4 the distributing lot, being a god, is an ally,4 nor the legislator.
For now the law, in the first place, enjoins upon the disobedient,5 by proclaim­ ing beforehand, that upon these conditions any person, who is willing, may cast lots or not;
and that, since the land, being sa­ cred, belongs first to all the gods, and next, to the priests and priestesses, who pray at the first sacrifices, and the second, and even to the third, both the buyer and seller of tenements and farms, which they have obtained by lot, are to suffer what is befitting upon such transactions ;
and having written 6 memoranda on cypress (tablets),6 they shall place them in temples 7 written for the time hereafter ;
7 and in addition to this they shall invest the guardianship of these, 8 in order that they may be,8 in that magistrate, who seems to see the most acutely, in order that the matters fraudulently introduced 1 may not lie hid from them, but that they may punish the per­ son disobedient at the same time to the law and to the god.
2
For how great a good will what is now enjoined be to all states that are persuaded, when they adopt the following ar­ rangement, according to the old proverb,3 no person being wicked will know, but being experienced and reasonable in his habits (he will).
For in such an arrangement there exists not much of money-making;
and there is attendant upon it the being neither necessary nor lawful for any one to make money by any illiberal kind of money-making—inasmuch as the so-called operative art is reproached as subverting liberal habits-nor to think it right to scrape money together at all by such means.[12.]
In addition to this a law still follows all these, that no private person be permitted to possess any gold or silver;
4 but that (there be)5 a coin 6 for the sake of daily exchange, which it is almost necessary for handicrafts to change, and for all, who have a need of such things,7 to pay the wages due to hired persons, be they slaves or domestic servants.
On which account we say that they must possess coin, which is of value amongst themselves, but of no worth amongst the rest of man­ kind.
For the sake of war indeed and of going abroad to other countries-for instance in the case of embassies, or some other business of a herald, compulsory on the state-should it.
be requisite to send out the common coin of Greece, it will be necessary on each occasion for the state to possess it.
1
But if there be any necessity for a private person to go abroad, let him, after obtaining leave of the magistrate, go abroad ;
but the foreign coin, which on his return home he has brought from any place, still remaining, let him put down for the state, and take up that of the country at the rate (of ex­ change).
2
And if 3 any one is detected in making (the foreign money) his own,3 such money shall become public property;
and let him, who 4 knows the fact, but does not divulge it, be subject to a curse 4 and reproach together with the party bringing it in, and to a fine in addition, not less than the amount of the foreign money so brought in.
And (be it enacted), that a person who is going to marry, or is giving (a daughter) in marriage, is neither to give or receive a marriage portion at all of any kind whatsoever, nor to deposit money with a person, 5whom one does not trusty nor to lend money upon interest, since it will be lawful for the borrower to repay neither interest nor principal.
Now that these pursuits are the best for a state to pursue, a person would decide correctly by considering them in this way, and referring them ever 6 to their origin and intention.
6
Now the intention of the statesman, who has a mind, we say, is not that, which the many would say, that a good legislator ought to wish, how the state, 7 for which he is with correct thoughts legislating,7 may be the greatest and the wealthiest possible, and possess gold and silver money, and rule over as many as possible by sea and land;
and they would add, that the person legislating correctly ought to wish the state to be the best and the hap­ piest possible.
Now of these things some can take place, but others cannot.
The possible then the arranging party would wish;
but the impossible he would not;
1 nor would he make even an attempt at wishes that are vain.'
For it is almost neces­ sary for them to be at the same time happy and good.
This then he would wish.
But it is impossible for persons to be very rich and good, such at least as the many reckon rich.
For they reckon rich those, who amongst a few persons have possessions valued at the greatest quantity of coin, which even a bad man may possess.
Now if such be the case, I will never agree with them that the rich man, if not a good one, can be truly happy;
but that it is impossible for the person pre-eminently good, to be pre-eminently rich.
What then ?2 some one would perhaps say.
Because, we would say, the possession of what is obtained both justly and unjustly, is more than double of that which is obtained justly alone ;
and that the expenditure, which is wont to be made neither honourably nor disgracefully, is doubly less than that which is honourable, and is wont to be made for honourable objects.
He, therefore, who acts in a contrary manner, will never be richer than him, who has double the means and half the expenditure.
Now of these, the one is a good person, but the other not a bad one, since he is (merely)3 parsimonious;
sometimes, indeed, he is altogether bad;
but, as we have just now said, is never good.
For he, who receives both justly and unjustly, and spends neither justly nor unjustly, is indeed rich, because he is parsimonious;
but he who is altogether bad, as being for the most part luxurious, is very poor.
And he, who spends upon honourable objects and acquires only justly, will never at any time become pre- eminently rich, nor yet very poor;
so that our assertion is right, that the very rich are not good men ;
and, if they are not good, they are not happy.[13.]
With us, however, the laying down of laws looks to that point, that the citizens may become the most happy and in the highest degree friends to each other.
But the citizens will never be friends, where there are many lawsuits with each other and much injustice;
but (most so) where the least and fewest are found.
We have said too, that there ought to be neither gold nor silver in the state;
nor, again, much money- making through handicraft trades and usury,1 or ugly cattle,2 but what agriculture gives and bears,3 and of these too such as will not compel a person by making money to neglect those things, for the sake of which riches are produced.
4
Now these are the soul and body ;
which, without gymnastics and the rest of discipline, would never be worth mentioning.
Hence we have said more than once, that we must put the attention to money in the last place of honour.
For, since all, about which every man is seriously engaged, are three, the last and third is cor­ rectly the attention paid to riches, but the middle is that re­ lating to the mind;
but that relating to the soul the first.
And, indeed, the polity, which we have just now been going through, has been correctly laid down by laws, if it ordains honours in this manner.
But if any one of the laws which are ordained in it shall seem to put health in the place of honour in the state before temperance, or wealth before health and temperance, it will appear to be not properly laid down.
A legislator, therefore, ought often to point out to himself this.
5" What do I intend?
and, " If this happens, or I fail in my aim,"5 (what then ?)
And thus perhaps he would get himself out of legislation, and liberate likewise the rest, but never a single person by any other means.
Let then the person, who has obtained by lot his portion, keep it on the conditions we have detailed.
1
It were a beautiful thing 1 for each person to come to the colony possessing the rest of things also equally.
But as this is not possible, and one will come possessing more means, and another less, it is requisite, for the sake 2 of many things, and of the opportunities in the state, for the sake of equality,2 that the value of property should be unequal, in order that magistra­ cies, and contributions, and distributions, 3(may exist) to each (according) to the value of his worth ;
3 4 (and) that, not accord­ ing to his own virtue alone, and that of his ancestors, nor yet according to the strength or beauty of his body, but according to the using of wealth and poverty they may receive as equally as possible, by what is unequal, but commensurable, and not differ.
4
For the sake of these things it is requisite that there should be four valuations in the size5 of property;
and that these should be called first, second, third, and fourth, or by some other appellation;
and that, when they remain in the same valuation, and when becoming richer from being poor, and poor from being rich, each may pass to the valuation suited to themselves.
This scheme of law I would lay down as fol­ lowing after these.
We say then that in a state, which is to have no part in the greatest of diseases, which would be more correctly called dis­ sension or sedition, there should exist neither severe poverty amongst some of the citizens nor (great) 6 wealth:
for both these produce both.
It is therefore requisite for a legislator to say at present what is the bound of each.
Let then the limit of poverty be the valuation of the lot, which ought to remain, and which no magistrate will ever overlook its becoming less to any one, nor any one of the rest of those who in the same way love honour on the score of virtue.
Now the legislator, having laid down that limit as a measure, will permit a person to possess the double, triple, and even to the quadruple of it.
But, if any one possesses more than these, whether by finding them, or their being given, or by money-making, or by acquiring through any other such like fortune, by giving up what is above the measure to the state and to the gods, who guard the city, he will be in good repute and without damage.
But if any disobeys this law, any one may inform against him on condi­ tion of receiving half the property, and the delinquent shall pay another portion to the same amount, and the half shall go to the gods.
And let the whole property of all, except the allotment,' be written down openly before the magistrates, who are the guardians, in order that such of the suits upon all points as2 relate to money may be easy and extremely clear.[14.]
After this it is meet in the first place to build3 the city as much as possible in the middle of the country, 4 after selecting a spot from those at hand, which possesses what is suited for a city,4 which it is not difficult to imagine and detail.
After this, to divide it into twelve 5 parts ;
and placing first the temple of Hestia, (Vesta,) and Zeus, and Athéné, to call it the Acropolis, and to throw round it a circular (enclosure), and from it to cut the city and all the country into twelve parts.
But the twelve parts ought to be equalized by the portions of the prolific land being small, but those of the unprolific large, and the allotments to be five thousand and forty.
And again (it is meet) to cut each of these into two;
and to unite two sections into one allotment, each having a share of what is near to, and what is remote from, the city, the near portion being added to that one farthest off, making one allotment;
and that, which is the second from the city, (to be added) to that, which is the second from the extremity;
and so on with all the rest.'
And (it is meet) to contrive in the twofold divisions, that what has just now been said (respecting)2 the badness and goodness of the land, be equalized 3 by the greater and less quantity at the distribution;
and to divide the males like­ wise into twelve parts;
and for a person to arrange the whole5 of the rest of property into twelve parts equal, as much as is possible, a description being made of all particulars.
After this, to assign the twelve allotments to the twelve gods, and to call them after their names, and to consecrate to each the por­ tion obtained by lot, and to call it a Phylé ;
6 and again to divide the twelve sections of the city in the same manner as they di­ vided the rest of the country;
and that each should possess two habitations, one near the centre and the other near the ex­ tremity ;
and thus let the method of settlement have an end.
But it is requisite for us to consider by all means a matter of this kind, that all the points, which have just now been stated, will never concur on such like occasions, so that all should happen to take place according to reason ;
and that men will exist, who would not feel annoyed at such a method of living together, but would endure to have property fixed (by law) and mode­ rate through the whole of life;
and the procreation of children to be such as we have mentioned ;
and to be deprived of silver and gold, and other things, which the legislator is clearly, from what has been said, about to forbid ;
and (endure) further 1 the equalization of the land and the dwelling in a city placed in the centre, 1 as we have mentioned above.
2
Of all which mat­ ters a person has been speaking almost as if they were dreams, and moulding2 a state and citizens, as it were, of wax.
Sub­ jects however of this kind have been in a certain manner not badly spoken of.
3But it is requisite to take up again against himself things of this kind.
3 4 For the legislator would say again to us this—"
Do not think, my friends, that what has been now asserted in these speeches has lain hid from me, and that (a person)5 has gone through in some manner the truth.
But I think this will be most just in each of those things about to be, that he, who exhibits a pattern, according to which the thing attempted ought to be done, should omit nothing of what is most beautiful and true;
but that he, to whom it is impossible for any thing of this kind to happen, should decline executing that very thing;
but that of those which remain, and is nearest to it, and most closely connected naturally with what it is fitting to do, 6 he should devise a plan how this very thing may take place ;
6 but permit the legislator to put a finish to his intention ;
and this being done, then to con- sider in common with him, which of the matters that have been mentioned are conducive, and which adverse to legisla­ lation.
1
For it surely behoves the artist in a matter the most trifling to make by all means his work consistent with itself, if it is to be worthy of mention.
But now after the decree relat­ ing to the division into twelve parts, we must be ready to look into this too,2 namely, to show in what manner the twelve parts have the greatest possible number of divisions of the things within them,3 and what are consequent upon these, and produced from them, up to the five thousand and forty;
and from whence (they have) 4 clans,5 and wards, and villages, and, in addition, the drawing up and leading out of (troops) in war, and moreover coins, and measures dry and liquid, and weights ;
all these it is requisite for the law to regulate in measure 6 and in harmony with each other.
In addition to these we ought not to feel a fear even on that ground, lest there should be what is con­ sidered an attention to trifles, should any one regulate all the chattels which persons are to possess, nor permit any of them to be immoderate, and consider by a reason common to all, that the distributions and variations of the numbers are useful for all things, even such as are various themselves7 in themselves, and such as are so in length and depth, or in sounds and motions, both those that proceed in a straight direction upwards and downwards, and (those that)8 move in a circle.
For it be­ hoves the legislator, looking to all these points, to enjoin all the citizens not to swerve from this arrangement to the utmost of their power.
For no one branch of learning suited to children possesses such a mighty power as regards domestic economy, and state polities, and all arts, as the study of num­ bers ;
and, what is the greatest of all, excites even the sleepy person and naturally untaught, and renders him docile, and with a good memory, and clever, while making a progress, by a divine art, beyond his own nature.
All these, if a person shall have taken away by other laws and pursuits illiberality and a love of money from the minds of those, who are about to possess them sufficiently and profitably, would become a course of instruction honourable and befitting;
but if not, a person would unconsciously, instead of wisdom, produce the so-called cleverness, such as it is in our power to see the 1 Egyptians and Phœnicians,1 and many other nations pro­ duce, through the illiberality of their other pursuits and possessions ;
either because some indifferent legislator of theirs has caused such results, or a severe misfortune has fallen upon them, or some other nature of this kind.
For let not this, Me­ gillus and Clinias, lie hid from us respecting places, that some differ2 from others in producing men better or worse ;
in op­ position to which we must not lay down laws.
For through all kinds3 of winds and violent heat, some persons are of an alien disposition, and with feelings of hostility ;
4 others through the water;
but others 5through that food from the earthy which not only imparts to bodies (properties) better and worse, but which is no less able to infuse all things of this kind into their soul.
But of all the places in a country those ex­ cel the most, in which there is a certain divine inspiration, and allotments for daemons, who are either always propitious to the inhabitants, or the contrary ;
for whom the legislator, who has a mind, would, after reflecting, as much as it is pos­ sible for man to reflect upon (all)1 things of this kind, en­ deavour to lay down laws;
which must be done by you, Clinias ;
for to matters of this kind must he turn himself, who is about to colonize a country.
Clin.
Very beautifully, Athenian guest!
do you speak;
and so must it be done by me.[1.]
Athen.
BUT, after all that has now been said, there will be almost2 the appointment of magistrates in your state.
Clin.
Such is the case.
AMen.
Respecting the proper arrangement of a polity, these two kind of things happen to exist.
First, the appointment of offices, 3[and of persons about to rule,]3 how many they ought to be, and in what manner appointed.
Next, with re­ spect to the laws that are to be imposed upon each office, what, and how many, and of what kind it will be fitting (to impose) upon each.
But, previous to choosing them, let us stop a little, and give some account fitting to be detailed re­ specting them.
Clin.
What account is this ?
Athen.
This.
Something of this kind is surely evident to all, that, since the work of legislation is a matter of moment, 1 by placing a state well furnished with laws well laid down under not Suitable magistrates,1 not only would there be a very great laugh at the (laws) well laid down to no purpose, but there would arise nearly the greatest mischief and bane to states from them.
Athen.
Let us then consider this, as happening to you, my friend, touching the present polity and state.
For you see that it is necessary in the first place for those, who are pro­ ceeding in a straight road to the powers of magistrates, to have given, both themselves and their respective families from childhood to the period of their election, a sufficient test.
Next for those, who are about to make the choice, to have been brought up and well taught in legal habits, so as to be able to judge correctly of those worthy of either (fate), and to receive, or to reject them with disgust.
2
But how can those, who have recently met together for this purpose, and are un­ acquainted with each other, and moreover uninstructed, be ever able to choose magistrates in a blameless manner ?
Clin.
They nearly never can.
Athen.
But a contest, as they say,3 does not readily admit of excuses.
This then must now be accomplished both by you and me ;
since you have with readiness undertaken to settle a colony for a clan of the Cretans, and are, as you say, the tenth commissioner;
and I have promised to assist you, according to our present story-telling.
I will not therefore willingly leave this discourse without a head.
1
For should it meet us,2 while wandering in this state, it would appear to be deformed.
Clin.
You have spoken, guest, very well.
Athen.
Not (spoken) merely, but so I will do to the utmost of my power.
CUn.
Let us do by all means, as we have said.
Athen.
Be it so, if god be willing;
and so far at least let us be victors over old age.
Glin.
And it is likely that he will be willing.
Athen.
It is reasonable.
Following him therefore, let us understand this.
Athen.
In how manly and hazardous a manner will our state have been at present settled.
Clin.
Looking to what3 and whither especially have you thus spoken at present ?
Athen.
How easily and fearlessly have we laid down laws for persons unskilled, in what way they may receive what has been just laid down.
Thus much, at least, is evident, Clinias, nearly to every one, although not very wise, that no one will easily admit these laws at first.
But if we wait for the time 4 when those, who in their boyhood had tasted of, and been suf­ ficiently brought up in, the laws, and accustomed to them,4 shall have taken a common part in them with the whole city in the election of magistrates, 5 on such an event happening as we are speaking of, if this should take place in a certain manner and skill, I conceive there would be a great security that a state would remain even after the then existing period educated in this way.
5Clin.
This carries reason with it.
Athen.
Let us then look to this, whether we can furnish any means sufficient for this end.
For I assert, Clinias, that the Cnossians ought, in a manner superior to the other Cretans, not merely to go through a formal rite respecting the coun­ try which is now being colonized, but to be strenuously care­ ful that the first magistrates may stand2 in the most secure and best manner possible.
With respect to others, it is a shorter work ;
but it will be most necessary for us to choose the guardians of the laws with every care.
Clin.
What road then and method 3 can we discover4 for this ?
Athen.
This.
I assert then, ye sons of Cretans, that the Cnossians, since they take the lead of the majority of cities, ought to choose in common with those who are going to this joint settlement, from themselves, and them, thirty-seven men in all;
nineteen from the settlers, but the rest from Cnossus itself;
and let the Cnossians give up these to your state, and for yourself to be a member of this colony and one of the eighteen men ;
and this, either by employing per­ suasion or moderate force.
Clin.
But why do not you, 0 guest, and Megillus, share with us in this polity ?[2.]
Athen.
Athens, 0 Clinias, has a high opinion of her­ self, and so too has Sparta, and each have their dwellings far off.
But to you and the other settlers there is a care on all points, the same as what we were just now saying respecting you.
1
Let it then be held to have been stated how these things may, from what is at present in our power, take place in the most likely manner.
1
But as time progresses, and the form of polity continues, let the choice of them (the magis­ trates) be something in this way.
In the election of magis­ trates let all take a share who bear arms, either as horse-soldiers or foot-soldiers, and who have taken a part in war according to their respective ability in age ;
and let the election take place in whatever temple the state holds in the highest veneration ;
and let each person bring to the altar of the god a small tablet, on which he has written the name of his father,2 and parish, and ward where he is a liveryman;
3 4 and let him write thus his own name in the same manner.
4
But let it be lawful for any one to take away the tablet, which appears to him to be not properly5 written, and to place it in the Agora, (there to re­ main 6) for not less than thirty days.
Of the tablets let the magistrates exhibit to the view of the whole city up to three hundred, that have been judged to be amongst the first;
and from these in a similar manner let the city vote whomsoever each person pleases ;
and let (the magistrates) exhibit again to all one hundred of those selected out of them a second time ;
and out of the hundred let any one vote a third time for whom he pleases, going 7 through cuttings.
7
But the thirty-seven, who may have the greatest number of votes, let some persons de­ ciding declare to be the magistrates.
Who then, Clinias and Megillus, shall appoint all these things for us in the state, re­ specting magistrates and the testing of them ?
Do we not per­ ceive, that in states, so united from the first, there must be some;
1 but who they would be, it is not the province of all magis­ trates?
1
It is however necessary (that there should be some), and these too men of not an inferior kind, but as much as pos­ sible at the very summit.
For the beginning, according to the proverb,2 is the half of the whole;
and all men praise a good commencement.
But this, as it seems to me, is more than the half;
nor has any one sufficiently praised it, when it has taken place correctly.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
Let us then, since we know it, not pass it by untold, by making nothing clear to ourselves as to the manner in which it exists.
For my part I have it not in my power to say but one word necessary for, and conducive to, the pre­ sent purpose.
Clin.
What is it ?[3.]
Athen.
I assert that to this state, which we are about to settle, there is not, as it were, a father and mother except the city which colonizes it.
Nor am I ignorant that often­ times some differences have arisen, and will arise, between colonies and their parent countries.
At present then, as a child, although it is about to be at variance with its parents, through its present want of instruction, loves and is beloved by them, and is constantly flying to its relations, finds allies in them alone, which 1 I assert has now taken place2 readily to the Cnossians through their care for the new city, and to the new (city through their care) for the Cnossians.
I repeat then, as I have just now said,3–for what is well said it does no harm (to say) twice-that the Cnossians ought to have a care over all these particulars in common, by selecting from those, who are departing for the colony, the oldest and best possible,4 not less than one hundred, and let there be another hundred from the Cnossians themselves.
I say too, that these should, on coming to the new city, be careful how the magistrates are appointed according to the laws, and after being appointed undergo a scrutiny.
And on this taking place, let the Cnossians dwell in Cnossus;
and let the new city endeavour to preserve itself and become prosperous.
Let then those numbered amongst the thirty-seven men be held to have been chosen both now and for all time to come for these purposes.
First, let them be guard­ ians of the laws;
next, of those writings (in) which 6 every one shall write down for the magistrates the amount of his pro­ perty, except the person who has the greatest valuation of four minæ,8 and the second of three, and the third of two [minæ] ;
9 but the fourth of (one) 1 mina.
But if any one shall be shown to possess any thing else beyond what has been written down, let all this become public property ;
and, besides this, let him 2undergo a punishment, through any one bringing him to trial, neither honourable nor with a good name, but disgrace­ ful,2 should he be convicted of despising the laws through the love of gain.
Let then any one indict him for being addicted to a disgraceful love of gain, and follow up the charge by a trial before the guardians of the laws.
And if the defendant is condemned to pay a fine, let him have no share in the pub­ lic property;
and when any distribution takes place in the state, let him be without a share, except as regards his (first) 3 allotment;
and let him be written down, where any one who wishes may read it, as a person condemned, as long as he lives.
Let not the guardian of the laws be in office more than twenty years ;
and let him not be inducted into his office, if he is less than fifty years of age.
But if he is sixty years old when he is inducted into it, let him hold it for ten years;
and according to this ratio let it be, that he, who has passed beyond seventy years, shall not imagine that he holds an office of such import­ ance amongst those who are holding it.[4.]
Let then these three ordinances be considered to have been stated, touching the guardians of the laws.
But as the laws progress, each one may enjoin upon these men, what matters they ought to attend to, in addition to what have been detailed already.
And now we will speak in order about the election of other magistrates.
For after this it is necessary to elect Gene­ rals, and such as minister to them in war, such as the 4Hip- parchs and the Phylarchs, and those who drill the foot-soldiers of the Phyle,4 to whom would be very fitting the name of Taxiarchs, as the common people call them.
1
Of these let the guardians of the laws propose for Generals from this very state itself;
' and from those so proposed let all, who have taken a part in war at their proper age, or are in the act of doing so on each occasion,2 make the selection.
But if it shall appear to any one that some one of those, who have not been proposed, is superior to some of those, who have been proposed, let him name the person, whom he proposes, in the place of some one, and, taking an oath touching this very matter, let him bring forward the other party;
and which ever shall be voted by a show of hands, let him be decreed as belonging to the selection.
And let the three, who have the greatest num­ ber of votes for them to be Generals and to have the care of the war department, undergo a scrutiny, as the guardians of the law (underwent).
And let the twelve elected Generals propose twelve Taxiarchs for themselves, for each tribe one ;
3 and let there be a preference nomination, as occurred in the case of the Generals, done in the same manner, respecting the Taxiarchs, and a second show of hands and a decision.
And let the guardians of the laws, after they have brought together an assembly at a place the most holy and most convenient, cause to sit, before the Prytanes and Council have been chosen, the heavy-armed apart, and apart too the cavalry, and the third in order after these the whole of those employed in war.
And let all hold up their hands for the Generals and Hipparchs;
but for the Taxiarchs those who carry shields;
but let all the cavalry choose for itself4
Phy­ archs ;
but let the Generals appoint for themselves the officers over the light-armed soldiers, or archers, and the rest of those employed in war.
There still remains for us the appointment of the Hipparchs.
These then let those propose, who proposed the Generals ;
and let the election and the preference nomination1 take place, as it occurred in the case of the Generals.
And let the cavalry hold up their hands for them in the presence of the infantry looking upon them;
and let the two, who have the greatest show of hands, be the commanders of all the cavalry;
and let the disputes about the show of hands2 take place up to twice;
but if any one doubts about them a third time, let those determine the votes,3 whose province it is to fix the mea­ sure of voting.3[5.]
The Council shall consist of thirty dozen;
for three hundred and sixty would be suited to the distributions ;
and by dividing that number into four parts, (each) ninety, from each portion of the census ninety councillors would give (their vote.) 4
And in the first place let all those of the largest valuation give their vote;
or the person who disobeys (the law) will be fined 5 according to the fine decreed,5 and ''when they shall have been carried in, let a person put a mark against them.
On the following day let those of the second class give (their vote), as on the former (day) ;
and on the third day let any one of the third class bring (his vote).
In the case of those belonging to these three classes, let it be compulsory 7 to give (a vote);
but let the fourth and smallest class be dis­ missed exempt from fine, should any one belonging to it be unwilling to give (a vote).
On the fourth day let all belonging to the fourth and smallest class give (their votes) ;
but let him, who belonging to the third and fourth class, is unwilling to give (a vote) be exempt from a fine.
But let him, who, belong­ ing to the second and first class, does not give a vote, be fined;
he, who belongs to the second rank, be fined the triple of the first fine ;
1 and he, who belongs to the first, quadruple.
On the fifth day let the rulers bring out for all the citizens to see the names that have a mark against them;
and let every man of them give (a vote) or be fined with the first fine.
And after selecting one hundred and eighty out of each class, let them, after choosing by ballot one half of them, make a scrutiny of them, and these shall form the council for one year.
The election taking place in this manner, would be a me­ dium between a monarchy and a democracy ;
which medium a polity ought always to preserve.
For slaves and masters can never become friends, nor the depraved and worthy, when proclaimed2 with equal honours.
For through things, that are unequal, those that are equal will become unequal, unless they partake of moderation ;
for, through both of those (in­ equalities) polities are filled with seditions.
For the old saw, being true, that equality produces friendship,3 has been asserted very correctly4 and carefully.
But through its not being very evident what the equality is, which is able to effect this, it throws us into great trouble.
For, as there are two equalities,1 of the same name, but in reality- nearly contrary to each other on many points, every state and every legislator is competent to introduce one of these in the case of honours by regulating, as regards the distribution by means of the ballot, the equality consisting in measure, weight, and number ;
but it is not easy for every one to perceive the most true and the best equa­ lity.
2
For it is the decision of Zeus ;
3 and it furnishes4 but little at all times to men ;
although as much as it does furnish to states or private persons, it works out every good.
For it distributes more to the greater, and less to the smaller,5 im­ parting to each what is moderate according to its nature.
Moreover it distributes greater honours to those who are even greater in virtue, 6 but to those who have (less) of virtue and education (it distributes) less (honours), as being suited 6 to each according to reason.
For this surely is justice itself even in politics, at which we ought at present to grasp, and, looking to this equality, Clinias, to settle our now rising state.
And should any one settle any other (state), he ought to give laws, with his mind turned to this point, and not to a few tyrants, or one, or to any power of the people, but always to justice it­ self.
And this is what has just now been stated, namely, the distributing what is according to nature, equal to unequals.
It is necessary however for every state to make use of these (two)1 equalities in name, if it is about not to have a share in seditions in any degree.
2For the easy and lenient temper of what is perfect and accurate contrary to justice the correct is improperly broken down when it takes placed
Hence it is perhaps necessary to make use in addition of the equality by ballot, on account of the moroseness of the multitude;
and after­ wards to invite by prayers a god and good fortune to direct the ballot to what is most just.
In this manner then it is neces­ sary to use both the equalities;
but the one which is in need of good fortune on the very fewest occasions.[6.]
These things, and in this way, and for these reasons, it is necessary, friends, for that state to do, which is about to be preserved.
But since both a ship, while sailing on the sea, requires constantly a watch both night and day, and in like manner a state dwells,3 while driven along by the storm of other states, and running the risk of being caught by all kinds of plots, it is requisite through the day to night, and from night to day, for the rulers to join with rulers, and watchers with watchers, and to succeed each other constantly, and never to cease handing over (their power).
But the multitude is not able to do any of these things quickly.
And it is neces­ sary to permit the majority of the counsellors to remain for the greatest part of their time properly managing their own private affairs;
but that a twelfth part of them should distri­ bute themselves over the twelve months, so as to furnish a watch, one part for one month, and I to be in readiness for any thing I in the case of any one coming from any where else, or from the city itself for any purpose, whether a person should be desirous of telling or hearing aught respecting what it is fitting for one state to give an answer to other states, or by putting questions to others to receive replies ;
and moreover for the sake of those innovations of all kinds which are wont to happen perpetually, in order especially that they may not occur;
or, if they have occurred, that the conse­ quences may be cured as quickly as possible, after the state shall have become acquainted with them.
Hence that por­ tion, which presides over the state, ought to be the mas­ ter of public meetings and their dissolutions, which take place both according to law and on a sudden.
All these matters it should be for the twelfth part of the council to ar­ range, who are to be at rest for eleven parts of the year.
But this part of the Council ought always to keep these watchings over the state in common with the other magistrates.
Such then being the state of affairs as regards the state, they may be put into order with moderation.
But what care, and what order, will there be in all the rest of the country ?
Must there not, since all the city, and the whole country, is dis­ tributed into twelve parts, be shown to be Commissioners of the roads, and dwellings, and buildings, and harbours, and of the market-place, and fountains, and moreover of sacred groves, and temples, and all other things of this kind belonging to the state ?[7.]
Athen.
Let us say then, that there ought to be per­ sons to cleanse the temples, and priests and priestesses;
and that it is meet to choose three kinds of officers over roads and buildings, and the ornaments belonging to things of this kind, and over human beings that they may do no injury, and over the rest of wild beasts,1 in the very encircling enclosure and suburb of the city, in order that every thing may take place befitting cities ;
and that as regards the duty just now stated, it is meet to call them City-Stewards,2 but as regards the market, Market-Stewards, and as regards the temples, Priests.
But let us not disturb those, with whom, as priests or priestesses, the sacred office is hereditary.
But if, as is likely to happen to those first settled, nothing has been laid down respecting holy 3 things of this kind in favour of any body or only a few, one must appoint priests and priestesses to be the cleansers of the temples of the gods.
But of all these things some are to be in their appointment by election, and some by lot, through those that are and are not Wards­ men mingling in a friendly manner with each other in every district and town, in order that they may be as much as pos­ sible of one mind.
To commit then what relates to sacred rites to the god himself, let it be an act of gratification to him, and to allow divine fortune to settle by lot.
But the party who has happened to obtain the lot, (it is meet) to subject to a scrutiny first, whether he is of a sound body and lawfully begotten ;
next of a family as pure as possible, and unpolluted himself by blood and all crimes of such a kind against the gods, and whether his father and mother have lived in a similar manner.
And it is meet to bring from Delphi the laws relating to all divine things, and, after appointing interpreters for them, to make use of them.
And let the priestly office be for a year, and not longer;
and let the person be not less than sixty years of age, who is, according to holy laws, to attend for us suf­ ficiently to divine matters.
And let there be the same1 laws relating to priestesses.
And let 2 the thrice four tribes bring (to the vote) thrice four interpreters,2 each (one) from them­ selves ;
and after scrutinizing the three who have the greatest number of votes, (it is meet) to send the other nine to Delphi, for the god to designate by an oracle one out of each triad;
and let the scrutiny relating to these, and their age, be as in the case of the priests,3 and let these be interpreters for life ;
and let the four4 wards 5 elect in the place of him, who may have left (life), (another)5 from the ward where there is a defi­ ciency.
(It is meet) too to choose Stewards for the sacred money in each of the temples, with full powers over the sacred groves and their produce, and the leasing (of the property), and three for the largest temples out of those with the largest estates ;
but two for the smaller temples, and one for the most moderate;
6 and let the choice and scrutiny of these be in the same manner as the election of the Generals was made.
And let what relates to sacred things take place in this way.[8.]
But let nothing be as far as possible without a guard.
Let the guards of the city be in this way, through the Generals, and Taxiarchs, and Hipparchs, and Phylarchs, and the Pry­ tanes, and moreover the City-Stewards and Market-Stewards, attending to their (respective) duties, after they have been chosen and appointed sufficiently ;
but the whole of the rest of the country (it is meet) to guard in this way.
The whole country has been divided by us into twelve parts as nearly as possible equal.
Let then, one Phylé (ward), after being allot­ ted to each portion, furnish for the year five, as it were, Rural- Stewards and Phylarchs.
1
And let it be for these to choose, each of 2 the five,2 out of their own Phyle, twelve from the young men not less than five-and-twenty 'years of age, and not more than thirty.
To these let there be allotted portions of the country during a month, each for each, so that all of them may have a practical knowledge of every part of the country.
But let the government and guardianship continue to the guards and governors for two years ;
and let those, who3 first obtain by lot their respective portions, the guard- officers lead out, changing the places of the country con­ stantly, (by going) 4to the place next in order towards4 the right in a circle, and let the right be that which is in the east.
But as the year comes round, in the second year,5 in order that the greatest portion of the guards may become acquainted with the country, not only during one season of the year, but that as many as possible may know thoroughly, in addition to the country, at the same time what occurs re­ lating to each spot in the country at each season, let the then officers lead them out again to the left, 1 constantly changing the place, until they go through the second year.'
In the third year, (it is meet) to choose other Rural-Stewards and guard- officers as the five curators of the twelve young men ;
and in their occupations attention should be given of some such kind as this to each place.
First that the country may be as much as possible well fortified against the enemy, 2 by trenching and digging out2 wherever it is requisite, and with buildings re­ straining, as far as they can, those endeavouring to injure in any way the country and its possessions ;
and by making use of animals under the yoke, and the servants in each place, for these purposes, 3 doing through them, standing over them, se­ lecting as much as possible their own employment in their own works,3 to render every place difficult for the enemy to pass, but as easy as possible for friends, and animals under the yoke and cattle ;
and by taking care 4 of the roads that they may be in the most quiet state,4 and of the waters from Zeus,5 that they may not injure the country, but benefit it rather, when descending from high grounds into hollow places in the moun­ tains,6and by restraining the outlets of the waters with buildings and ditches, such hollows may, by receiving and drinking up the waters from Zeus, produce streams and fountains for the fields below them and for all places,7 and thus cause the most dry places to possess water plentiful and good.
And let them, by ornamenting the water from fountains, whether it is a river or its source, with plantations and buildings,1 render it more beautiful, and bringing all the streams together make them abundant by means of 2 mine-like tunnels and surface­ irrigations, according to each season,2 if perchance there may have been a grove or sacred precinct about those very streams dedicated to a deity,3 and by sending which 4 to those spots they may adorn the holy places of the gods.
5
By all means too in spots of this kind it is necessary for youths to fit up places for naked exercises for themselves, and old men's baths, and making them warm for the aged, by placing wood 1 dry and dry1 for the benefit of those labouring under diseases, 2 and receiving kindly bodies worn down by rustic labours, and a habit (of body) much better than that of a medical practitioner not very skilful.2[9.]
All these things then, and of this kind, would be to such places an ornament and use, in conjunction with sport by no means unpleasant.
But let the serious attention relating to these things be this.
-Let the sixty3 defend, each their own place, not only on account of enemies, but for the sake of those, who call themselves friends.
But if any one, whether he is a slave or a free-man, injure his neighbour, or any other citizen, let those five rulers act as judges in the case of the party asserting that he has been injured, with respect to trifling matters;
but where one person brings a charge against an­ other on greater matters, let the seventeen, together with the twelve, on questions up to three minæ.
No judge or magis­ trate ought to be exempt from giving an account of his con­ duct as judge or magistrate, except such as, like kings, put the finish to suits.
Moreover as regards the Rural-Stewards if they behave insolently to those, of whom they are the guardians, by enjoining unequal tasks, or by attempting to seize and carry off any thing from these, employed in agricul­ ture, not having previously persuaded them (to give it up);
and'if they receive aught from those, who offer it to curry favour;
or if they give their decisions unjustly, through yield­ ing to adulation ;
let them bear off as their reward the reproach of the whole state.
But for the other wrongs, which they may do to those in their district, let them voluntarily undergo a fine, as far as one mina, imposed by the villagers and neigh­ bours.
But for greater or smaller injuries, on each occasion, if they are not willing to pay, through their trusting to being removed monthly to another place, and thus escaping, although pursued by law, in such cases the injured party is to have the chance of a trial at common law ;
and if he obtains a verdict, let him demand of the defendant to pay I a double fine,1 and 2 having been unwilling,2 to undergo punishment willingly.
And let the rulers and the Rural-Stewards have their diet­ ary for the space of two years in some such manner as this.
First let there be in the different places a common tablet 4
Fat which they must all make a common tablet
And let the person, who is absent from table, and sleeps out for one day or night, without orders from the rulers, or 5 some every neces­ sity 5 falling upon him, if the five inform against him, and, after writing the indictment, place it in the market-place, to the effect that he has broken through his guardianship, let him bear the disgrace of having on his part betrayed the con­ stitution, and be chastised with stripes by any one, who meets him, and is willing (to do so) with impunity.
And if any one of the rulers themselves is doing any thing of this kind him­ self, it is necessary for all the sixty to direct their care to such a person;
and let him who perceives or hears of it, but does not bring him to trial, be amenable to the same laws 1 (as the party offending) ;
1 and let him be punished with a greater fine than the young men,2 (and)3 be held dishonoured with respect to all the rule over young men.
Of these doings likewise let the guardians of the laws be the inspectors, in order that either they may not take place at all, or, taking place, meet with condign punishment.
Now it is meet for every man to bear in mind touching all men, that 4 he, who has never been a servant, will never be a master worthy of praise;
;
4 and it is requisite to pride oneself rather upon acting properly the slave, than on acting properly the master, first towards the laws, since this is being a servant to the gods;
next towards elders and the young persons5 who have lived with honour.
After this it is meet for the person, who has been one of the Rural-Stewards, to taste during these two years daily food of a humble and poor kind.
For, after the twelve magistrates shall have been enrolled,6 let them come together with the five and take counsel, that, like domestics, they will not have other persons to be domestics and slaves to them, nor will they from the household of other farmers and villagers use their attendants for their own concerns, but only so far as relates to the public at large;
but in other matters let them consider that they are to live, dependent themselves on themselves, and ministering to, and ministered by, themselves ;
and in addition to this, searching through the whole country, summer and winter, in arms, for the sake of guarding and knowing thoroughly all places, that successively present themselves.
For it appears that for all to know accurately their own country is a piece of learning inferior to none.
For the sake of which it behoves a person at the period of youth to attend to hunting by dogs and to other kinds of catching wild beasts, no less than for the sake of any other 1 pleasure and profit at the same time, which results through these means to all.
2
These very pursuits 2 then let every man to the utmost of his power readily pursue, whether a per­ son delights to call them 3 concealments, or rural stewardships, 3 or by any other name, if they are about to preserve sufficiently their own state.[10.]
After this there follows the subject relating to the election of those acting as rulers, both Market-Stewards, and City-Stewards.
Upon the Rural-Stewards, sixty in number, there should follow three City-Stewards, dividing the twelve parts of the city into three ;
and in imitation of those (the Rural- Stewards) they should have the care of the path-ways, and of the city, and the public roads, that respectively stretch from the country to the city, and of the buildings likewise, so that all of them are made according to law ;
and moreover of the streams of water, 4 which those, who watch them, send to them and deliver, after being attended to,4 in order that they may pass on to the fountains, sufficient in quantity and clear, and adorn at once and benefit the city.
These too ought to be .
persons of influence, and at leisure to pay attention to public affairs.
On this account let every man propose as a City- Steward whomsoever he wishes out of those with the largest property.
1
And when (all) have had hands held up for them, and those are reduced to six, to whom the most (votes) 2 have been given, let those, who are to have this charge, select by ballot the three, and after they have undergone a scrutiny, let them be in office according to the laws laid down for them.
Next in order after these (it is meet) to choose Market-Stewards, five in number, out of those with the valuation of the second and first class;
but in other respects let their election be in the same manner as for the City-Stewards.
3(For it is meet) that ten out of all the rest, having had hands held up for them, should ballot for the five,3 and declare them, after undergoing a scru­ tiny, to be the persons in power.
And let every one hold up his hand 4 for ten in all.
4
But let him, who is unwilling to vote, if informed against before the rulers, be fined fifty drachms, in addition to his being held to be a bad man.
And let any one who wishes go to the public assembly and common meeting ;
and let it be compulsory on him, who belongs to the se­ cond and first class of property, to be fined ten drachms, if he is not present and mustered at the conventions;
but it shall not be compulsory on the third and fourth class of property;
but let such a person be dismissed without a fine, unless the rulers give an order for all to be present in consequence of some (urgent) necessity.
And (it is meet) for the Market-Stewards to preserve the orderly arrangement enjoined by the laws relating to the mar­ ket-place ;
and to take care of the temples and fountains in the market-place, so that no one injures them;
and to punish the party so injuring with stripes and bonds, if a slave and a stranger;
but if a native acts in a disorderly manner with re­ spect to things of this kind, let them be authorized, after a trial, to fix a fine up to one hundred drachms in money, but to fine up to the double of this sum the offending party, if they are sitting in judgment in common with the City-Stew­ ards.
Let there be the same power to fine and punish allowed to the City-Stewards in their own department, so as to fine offenders up to a mina themselves, but the double of this sum in conjunction with the Market-Stewards.[11.]
After this it will be proper for the leaders in Music and Gymnastics to be established, two kinds of each ;
some of them for the sake of instruction, and others for the sake of contesting.
Now in the case of instruction, the law relating to Gymnasia and schools means to speak of those, who have the care of orderly arrangement and instruction to boot, and of the attention paid to such matters, and of the frequenting and staying at schools on the part of young persons, both male and female:
but in the case of contesting, (it means to speak of) those who assign the prizes to competitors in Gymnastics and Music;
and these two are two-fold;
one employed on Music, and the other on Gymnastics.
1
Now in the contests of men and horses,2 it would be proper for the same per­ sons to assign the prizes ;
but in those of Music, for some to do so in the case of solo-singing and the imitative art,3 such as the rhapsodists, and all of this kind ;
but others over chorus- singing and players on the harp and hautboy.
First then with regard to the amusement of the choirs of boys and men, and girls (exercised) in dancing, and in the whole order of music, it is surely requisite to elect their leaders.
Now one leader, not less than forty years old, will surely suffice for these.
One too not less than thirty years old will suffice for solo-singing, and to be the introducer of, and to give a j udgment sufficiently upon, the competitors.
Now the leader and regulator of the choir it is requisite to choose in some such manner as this.
Let those, who have a friendly feeling towards such matters, go to the meeting, subject to a fine if they do not go, and of this let the guardians of the law be the judges ;
but upon the rest, if they are not willing, let there be nothing compulsory.
And let the person, who makes the nomination, select one out of those who are skilful;
and in the scrutiny let there be only this one charge and denial, on the part of some, that the person, who has obtained the lot, is unskilled, but on the part of others, that he is skilled;
and let the person who, out of ten pre­ viously voted for, has obtained singly the lot, be, after under­ going a scrutiny, the leader of the choirs according to the law for one year.
In the same manner as these, let him who, out of those that come to a trial, in this way obtains the lot, be the leader for that year of the 3 solo-singing, and concert­ singing,3 after giving, as the party so obtaining the lot,2 to the judges the power to decide.
After this it is necessary to choose from the persons belonging to the third and even second class of property, the assignors of prizes in the contest relat­ ing to the exercises of horses and men.
Now to the elec­ tion let it be compulsory upon the three classes to go, but let the smallest class be dismissed without a fine;
and let there be three who obtain the lot, twenty having previously had hands held up for them, but three of the twenty obtaining the lot, whom the vote of the examiners shall approve of.
But if any one is rejected through any balloting or decision what­ ever of a magistrate, let another be chosen in his stead, and the scrutiny take place in the same manner respecting him.[12.]
There remains now the ruler relating to what has been mentioned by us before, namely, the party to take care of the whole instruction of females and males.
Let the person who is to rule over these be, according to the laws, not less than fifty years old, and the father of children lawfully be­ gotten, males and females especially, but if not, of either sex.
And let both him, who selects, and him, who is selected, consider that this office is by far the greatest of the chief offices in the state.
For the first budding of every plant, when it runs in a beautiful manner to the excellence of its nature, is the most powerful to put a suitable finish 1 of other plants, 1 and of animals tame and wild and men.
Now man we say is a tame animal;
and when he meets with proper instruction and a fortunate nature, is wont to become an animal the most divine and tame;
but when he is not sufficiently or not properly brought up, he is the most savage of all the animals, which the earth produces.
On which account the legislator ought not to suffer the bringing up of children to be a secondary thing, or as a by-work.
2
But it is necessary to begin from the first step, by the person,2 who is about to have the care of them, being selected, who is the best in all respects of those in the state;
3 and by the legislator ordering that person to be by all possible means set over3 and to take care of them.
Let all the magistrates, therefore, except the Counsellors and Prytanes, go to the tem­ ple of Apollo and give, unknown to the guardians of the laws, their votes for him, whom each conceives would rule the best amongst those conversant with education.
And let him, for whom the most votes come together, after be has been scru­ tinized by the other magistrates, who, with the exception of the guardians of the laws, have chosen him, enter upon his office for five years;
but in the sixth year, let another be chosen to the office in a similar manner.[13.]
But if any ruler dies while employed in a public situ­ ation before the term of office shall have expired, wanting more than thirty days, let those, to whom this duty belongs, appoint another in the same manner to the office.
And if any one, who is a guardian to orphans, dies, let the relations on both the father's and motber's side, as far as the cousins, who may at that time be in the country, appoint another within ten days, or let each be fined a drachm a day, until they shall have appointed the guardian 1 for the children.
1
Now every state will surely become no state, in which courts of justice are not properly established ;
and on the other hand a voiceless judge, and who, in the preliminary proceedings,3 does not speak more than the litigants, as in the case of arbitrat­ ors,4 will never be sufficient for the purpose of deciding justly.
On this account, it is not easy, when there are either many or few indifferent characters, to have a fair trial.
But it is ne­ cessary for the matter in dispute to be clearly stated by each party;
and time too and the sifting slowly and frequently a question conduce to the rendering a doubtful point clear.
On this account it is meet for those, who complain of each other, to betake themselves first to their neighbours and friends, and those the most conversant with the subject of dispute.
But if a party is unable to obtain a satisfactory decision from them, let him go to another tribunal;
but if those two cannot bring about a reconciliation, let the third put an end to the suit.
In a certain respect, indeed, the establishment of courts of jus­ tice depends on the choice of magistrates;
for every magis­ trate is necessarily a judge of certain things ;
but every judge1 is not a magistrate, although, in a certain respect, during the day in which he is deciding a suit, he is no mean a magistrate.
Considering, then, the judges likewise as magistrates, let us state which of them would be proper, and of what matters they are to be the judges, and how many for each suit.
Let then that tribunal be of the highest authority, 2 which each show forth, themselves to themselves, after having chosen cer­ tain persons in common.
2
But as regards the rest, let there be two tribunals;
one, when a private person accusing another private person of doing him a wrong, shall bring him to trial, and be willing for the suit to be decided;
the other, when any one conceives that the public has been injured by some of the citizens, and is willing to aid the community at large.
Let us state then 3 of what kind are the judges, and who.3
In the first place then, let a tribunal common to all, who are contending for the third time, as private persons with each other, exist in this manner.
All the magistrates that are in office for a year, and those for a longer period, ought, when the new year is about to commence in the month that succeeds the summer solstice,4 to come on the day, before that very5 day of the month, together to one temple, and, swearing by the god, to take, as it were, for the initiatory rite6 of every office, one judge, who shall be deemed to be the best in each office, and appear likely to decide in the best and most holy manner lawsuits amongst his fellow-citizens 1 during the en­ suing year.
When the judges are chosen, let a scrutiny take place by the very persons who have chosen them ;
and if any one is rejected, let them choose another in the same manner;
but let the persons approved of act as judges in the case of those, 2 who have fled from the other courts of justice,2 and let them give their vote openly.
The Counsellors, however, and the other officials, who chose them, must of necessity be the hearers and spectators of these decisions ;
and other persons too, who­ ever wish it.
But if any one accuses any person of having willingly decided a suit unjustly, let him go and make the accusation before the guardians of the law;
and let the party found guilty undergo a punishment of this kind, namely, to pay half of the damage done to the injured party;
but if he shall appear to deserve a greater fine, let those, who tried the suit, fix what additional punishment he ought to suffer (in per­ son), or to pay either to the public treasury, or 3 to the person who has suffered the injury.
3
But with respect to public ac­ cusations, it is necessary in the first place for the multitude to participate in the decision.
For all are injured, when anyone does wrong to the state;
and hence the multitude would justly take it ill, if they had no share in such decisions;
but both the beginning and the end of such a suit it is requisite to re­ fer to the people ;
but the inquiry into it, to the three greatest magistrates, whom both the defendant and plaintiff agree in acknowledging;
but if they are unable to participate in such agreement themselves, let the Council decide upon the choice4 of each of them.
It is meet moreover for all to have a share as far as they can in private suits.
For he, who has no share in the power of acting as a judge with others, conceives that he has in no respect a share in the state.
On this account then it is necessary for the courts of justice to be according to the wards, and for the judges to give on the instant, uncor­ rupted by entreaties, their decision by ballot;
and that of all such matters that tribunal is to give the final decision, which we say is established, as far as is possible by human power, the most incorruptible in the case of those, who are unable 1 to come to terms 1 either through their neighbours or the tri­ bunals belonging to the wards.[14.]
Now in truth, respecting courts of justice, of which we said that a person speaking could not easily assert indubitably that they are offices of rule or not, this description, painted, as it were, in outline,2 has asserted some things, and nearly left out others.
For the exact laying down and at the same time the division of laws relating to suits3 will take place by far the most correctly at the end of legislation.
Let it then be told to those subjects to wait for US.4
For the appointments relating to other magistrates have taken up nearly the greatest part of legislation.
But the totality and exactness relating to one and all of the subjects connected with a state, and the whole of a state administration,5 cannot become clear, until the digression shall arrive at the end, after having embraced 6 from the beginning portions of itself, the second and the mid­ dle and all.
At present, however, as far as the choosing of magistrates has taken place, this would be a sufficient finish to what has been previously mentioned;
while 7 the commence- ment of the laying down of laws is 7 requiring no longer a putting off and doubts.
Clin.
Having spoken, 0 guest, what has gone before en­ tirely to my mind, you have now said this, still more agreeably than those, by uniting the beginning with the end, touching both what has been, and is to be, said.
Atlien.
Thus far then will the game of prudent old men have been played by us in a becoming manner.
Clin.
Beautiful is the serious pursuit of men, which you appear to show forth.
Athen.
It is probable.
But let us reflect whether this ap­ pears to you as it does to me.
CUn.
What kind of thing ?
and about what ?
Athen.
You know that, as in painting to the life, the business appears never to have an end as regards each animal, but that by colouring, and decolouring, or by whatever name the sons of painters call a thing of this kind, it seems that it never would cease giving a fresh touch, so that what has been painted receives an increase towards becoming more beautiful and more clear.
Clin.
I almost understand, by hearing, what you mean, al­ though I am by no means conversant with this kind of art.
Athen.
This will be no detriment to you.
But let us em­ ploy the expression, which has occurred to us respecting the art, to this purpose, so that, if any one had an idea of painting a most beautiful animal, and to keep it for not a worse state, but a better one, as time was continually progressing, do you not perceive that, through his being a mortal, unless he left be­ hind him a successor to set it to rights, should it make any slip through time, and 1 who would be able to add what, through his own weakness in the art, had been omitted,' and by giving a brilliancy cause it to improve, all his great labour would last but a short time ?
Clin.
True.
Athen.
What then, does not this appear to you to be the intention of the legislator ?
First, to write down his laws as accurately as possible, (or) 2 sufficiently so ?
In the next place, do you think that in the course of time, and after making an actual trial of what has been decreed, any legislator has been so insane, as not to know that many things of this kind must necessarily be left out, which it is requisite for some successor to set to rights, in order that the polity and arrangement may by no means become worse, 1 (but always better and more adorned,) as regards the state settled by him ?1CUn.
It is likely-Chow not ?)—that every (legislator) what­ ever intends a thing of this kind.
Athen.
If then any (legislator) possesses any plan for this, in deed and in word, namely, by what method he could teach another, whether a greater person or less, to have his wits upon this point, how it is requisite to preserve laws and to set them to rights, he would never be tired of telling a thing of this kind, until he reached the end.
Clin.
How should he ?
A then.
Ought not this then to be done both by you and me at present ?
Clin.
Of what kind of thing are you speaking?
Athen.
Since we are about to establish laws, and guardians of the laws have been chosen by us, but we are ourselves 2 at the sunset of life,2 and the guardians are young men as com­ pared with us, it is, as we have said, necessary for us at the same time to lay down laws, and to endeavour likewise to make these very (young) men, as much as possible, both legislators and guardians of the laws.
Clin.
How not ?
since we are able to do so sufficiently.
A then.
Let us then make the attempt, and be eager (to do so).
A then.
Let us say to them—O friends, the preservers of the laws, we shall leave very many things relating to matters, the laws of which we have laid down ;
for it must needs be so ;
nevertheless we will not omit matters of not small moment, nor the whole as far as we can, undescribed, as it were, by some sketch;
1 and what is so sketched, it will be requisite for you to fill up.
But it is meet for you to hear by looking to what point you will accomplish a thing of this kind.[15.]
For Megillus, and myself, and Clinias have spoken upon these matters with each other not seldom, and we agree that it has been spoken correctly.
And we are desirous for you to be at the same time indulgent to us, 2and to become our disciples,2 looking to those points, to which we have agreed among ourselves that a guardian of the laws and a legislator ought to look.
Now this agreement has one head,3 namely, how a man may become good by possessing that virtue of the soul, which is suited to his nature, either from a certain study, or some habit, or from some kind of possession or desire or opinion, or from some kind of learning, whether the nature of those dwelling together is male or female, youthful or aged, in order that there may be, through the whole of life, every serious exertion directed5 to that very same object, of which we are now speaking;
but of all the rest, that are an impe­ diment to these, there will appear not one person holding a single thing in greater honour;
but that he will at length even die for a state, rather than be willing to support the yoke of slavery, should there appear a necessity for it to be overthrown, and to be under the rule of worse men, or to quit it a not-state by flight ;
7 since every thing of this kind is to be endured by those who are suffering, before they take in exchange that polity, which naturally makes men worse.
On these points we have previously agreed;
and do you now, looking to both of these, praise and blame the laws ;
blaming1 such as are not able to effect these objects ;
2 but, embracing and receiving with a kind feeling such as are able, do live3 ye in them ;
but to other pursuits, and many 4 of those called good, it is meet for you to bid a farewell.
Let this then be to us the beginning of the subsequent laws, commencing from things holy.
For we ought in the first place to resume the number five thousand and forty, because it had and has now convenient distributions, both the whole number, and that which was assigned to the wards;
which we laid down as the twelfth part of the whole, being exactly four hundred and twenty.
And as the whole number has twelve divisions, so also has that of the wards.
Now it is meet to consider each division as a sacred gift of a deity, through its following both (the order of) the months and the revolutions of the universe.
5
Hence that which is inherent6 leads every state, making them7 holy.
Some persons indeed have per­ haps made a more correct distribution than others, and with better fortune have dedicated the distribution to the gods.
But we now assert, that the number five thousand and forty has been chosen most correctly, as it has all divisions as far as twelve, beginning from one, except that by eleven;
and this has the slightest correction.
8
For it becomes whole, 1 if two hearths are distributed to the other parish
Now that these things are true, a tale not very long would show at leisure.
Believing then for the present in the present tradition 2 and story, let us distribute this number ;
and dedicating to a god, or a son of gods, each portion, and giving the altars, and the things pertaining to them, let us institute monthly two meetings re­ lating to sacrifices, twelve according to the division of the wards, and twelve to that of the city;
the first, for the sake of the favour of the gods, and of things pertaining to the gods;
the second, for the sake of our relationship and acquaintanceship with each other, and for the sake of every kind, as we should say, of intercourse.
For as regards the communion in, and mixture of, marriages, it is necessary to take away the ignorance as to the parties from whom a person leads home (a wife), and what (woman) 3 he is giving in marriage and to whom, deem­ ing it of every importance that there should be in matters of this kind as far as is possible no mistake at all.
For the sake then of a serious object of this kind it is necessary for,youths and maidens to make for themselves sports by dancing together, and at the same time seeing and being seen by each other,4 rational­ ly, and at an age that has a fair pretext,4 being both often naked as far as a prudent feeling of modesty exists in each party.
Of all these let the rulers of the choirs be the guardians and arrangers and the legislators likewise, together with the guar­ dians of the laws, by ordaining what we may have left out.
But it is necessary, as we have said, that, as regards all such matters, the legislator should leave out all that are small and numerous;
but that those, who become in succession during the year experienced by learning from their use, ] be arranged and being corrected move yearly, 1 until there shall appear to have been made a sufficient limit2 to such legal enactments and pur­ suits.
Now the space of ten years will, when applied to all and each, be at the same time moderate and sufficient for an expe­ rience 3in sacrifices and choirs,3 4a legislator, who had ar­ ranged, living in common,4 but coming to his end, let each of the magistrates themselves, bringing before the guardians of the laws, what is omitted in their own office, be corrected,5 until each thing shall appear to have attained the end of having been done properly.
And then, after laying them down as immov­ able, let them use them in conjunction with the other laws, which the legislator, who laid them down,1 ordained at the beginning;
2of which it is becoming2 for them to change voluntarily not a single thing at any time.
But should per­ chance any necessity seem to lay hold of them, it is requisite for all the magistrates and all the people to consult together, and to go to all the oracles of the gods;
(and) should all these accord, then to disturb (the laws), but by no means otherwise ;
but let the person, who prevents (a change), ever be, according to law, the superior.[16.]
Whenever then at whatever period a person amongst those of five-and-twenty years old believes that he has, after 3seeing and being seen3 by others, found some one4 to his mind and fitted for a communion in, and procreation of, chil­ dren, let him marry when he is within thirty-five years of age ;
but how it is requisite to seek the becoming and fitting, let him first hear.
For it is meet, as Clinias says, to lay down before each law a prelude relating to it.
Clin.
You have very properly reminded us, guest;
and you have seized upon the opportunity of a discourse, that ap­ pears to me to be extremely well-timed.
Athen.
You speak well.
Let us then say to a person born of good parents-
It is meet, 0 boy, to contract those mar­ riages, which appear correct amongst thinking men ;
who would advise you neither to avoid a marriage with poor per­ sons, nor to pursue pre-eminently one with the rich ;
but, if all the other things are equal, to always honour the inferior, and to enter into a communion with it.
For this5 would be advantageous both to the city and the hearths which come together.
For the equable and commensurate infinitely surpass the immoderate with respect to virtue.
He therefore, who is conscious of being rather headstrong, and carried away more than is fitting towards all kinds of actions, ought to be eager to become the relation of parents of orderly manners:
but he, who is naturally of a contrary disposition, ought to proceed to an alliance of a contrary kind.
And in every case, let there be one story1 respecting marriage.
For it is meet that each person should be a suitor in a marriage that is beneficial to the state, and not what is the most pleasant to himself.
For all are natur­ ally carried to that, which is the most like to themselves;
from whence the whole state becomes in an anomalous position as regards wealth and manners;
through which those things, that we do not wish to happen to ourselves, happen especially to the majority of states.
Now in our system to order by law that the rich are not to marry with the rich, or the party, who has much power, not to do so with another such, but to compel the quicker in their habits to go by a community of marriage to the more slow, and the slower to the quicker, would, in ad­ dition to its being ridiculous, excite a feeling of anger with the many.
For it is easy to understand that a city ought not to be mixed like a cup,2 in which the maddened wine, when poured forth, effervesces ;
but one that, being corrected by an­ other and a sober deity,3 does, after receiving a beautiful com­ mingling, produce a good and moderate drink.
But not one, so to say, is able to clearly see this taking place in the mingling (of the sexes) with respect to children.
On this account it is neces­ sary to leave alone things of this kind in a law;
and to endea- your by charms to persuade 1 each person to set a greater value upon the equality in their children, themselves to themselves, than in the equality of marriages, insatiable of wealthy and by reproaches to turn aside him, who makes riches the ob­ ject of his pursuit in marriage, but not to compel him by a written law.[17.]
Let these then be the exhortations respecting mar­ riages, and those too, which have been mentioned previous to these,2 that it is requisite to hold fast to ever-producing nature, by leaving behind children of children, and to deliver them over continually as servants of god in the place of ourselves.
All this then, and still more, a person may say respecting marriages, how they ought to take place, and may make use of a prelude cor­ rectly.
But if any one cannot be persuaded willingly, but keeps himself in the city estranged and without connexion, and re­ mains unmarried for five and thirty years, let him be fined every year, if he possesses property of the largest class, one hundred drachms;
if of the second, seventy;
if of the third, sixty;
but if of the fourth, thirty ;
and let the fine be sacred to Juno.3
And let him, who does not pay every year, be made a debtor tenfold ;
and let the Steward of the goddess exact the fine ;
and if he does not exact it, let him be the debtor.
4
And let every (Steward) in the passing of his accounts give a statement re­ lating to (debts) of this kind.
4
Let him then, who is unwilling to marry, be thus punished as regards money ;
and of all hon­ our from juniors let him be deprived:
nor let any young man voluntarily obey him in any thing;
and, if he attempts to chastise any one, let any one assist and defend the injured person;
and let him, who when present does not assist, be pronounced by the law to be both a cowardly and a bad citizen.
Concerning the marriage portion we have spoken before ;
and let it be said again, 5 that equal things are in return for equal things, by neither the poor receiving nor bestowing 'through want of money to grow old.
5
For the necessaries of life exist to all of those in this state;
and to wives, there will be less of insolence, and to the men who marry for money, (less of) humble and illiberal slavery.
1
And he who is obedient (to this law) will perform one of the things that are beautiful.
But let him, who is not obedient, and either gives or receives more than the worth of fifty drachms 2 for the sake of a garment,2 pay 3one mina, or three half-minæ, or two minæ;
3 but let him who has the largest property, pay another such sum to the public treasury;
and let whatever has been given or received be held as sacred to 4 Juno and Zeus,4 and let the Stewards of those deities exact the fine, just as was stated in the case of those who did not marry, that the Stewards of Juno were on each occasion to exact the fine, 5 or each of them to pay it themselves.
5
With respect to the power of betrothal, let the first be in the father, the se­ cond in the grandfather, and the third in that of brothers by the same father.
But if there be none of these, let the right rest afterwards in a similar manner on the mother's side ;
but should an unusual misfortune1 occur, let the nearest of kin have the power together with the guardians.
But whatever are the rites before marriage or any other sacred act, relating to things future, present, or past, and fitting to be done, it is requisite to inquire of the interpreters, and for each person to consider that, by obeying them, every thing will take place in moderation in his behalf. [18.]
With respect to (nuptial)2 feasts, it is meet to invite together not more than five male and five female friends ;
and as many of both sexes of kindred and familiars;
and let the expense be not more than is accord­ ing to any one's substance;
a mina to him of the largest pro­ perty ;
to another, the half of that sum ;
and so to another in succession, according as the value of his property decreases.
And it is requisite for all to praise the person who obeys the law;
but let the guardians of the law punish the disobedient, as being a person unskilled in what is becoming, and uneducated in the laws relating to marriage songs..
To drink, however, to intoxication, is never at any place becoming, except in the festivals of the god who is the giver of wine;
nor is it safe 3 for a person seriously occupied about a marriage ;
3 at which it is becoming for the bride and bridegroom to be particularly prudent, as making no small change in their life, and at the same time, that the offspring may always be produced as much as possible from prudent parents.
For it is nearly uncertain what kind4 of night or day will in conjunction with a deity produce.
And moreover it is meet for the work of pro­ creation to take place, not when bodies are relaxed by drink­ ing, I but for what is born to stand together compact, not wan­ dering and quiet in fate.
1
But be, who is filled with wine, is carried along every where, and carries (others)2 along, mad­ dened both in body and soul.
Hence he, who is drunk, is 3 at the same time beside himself and bad to sow seed;
so that it is probable he would beget offspring anomalous, and not trustworthy, and with a habit of body and mind not straight­ forward.
Hence,4 it is requisite 5through the whole year, and life more, but mostly during the time of procreation, to be careful,5 and not to do willingly such things as produce dis­ ease, or such as are close upon conduct riotous or unjust.
For it must needs be, that what is squeezed out into the souls and bodies of what is being born, should be moulded into a form, and produce things in every respect inferior.
But pre- eminently is it requisite to abstain from what is related to such things on that day and night.
For the principle and deity6 seated in man preserves all things, if it obtains the honour, suited to it, from those, who make use of it.
And it is requisite for the bridegroom to consider that one of 7 the two dwellings assigned by lot7 is for the procreation and bringing up of, as it were, fledgelings;
and that, separated from his father and mother, he is to make his marriage there, and have it as his own residence and the nurture-place of his children.
For where in friendships1 there exists a feeling of desire, it glues together and binds all habits ;
but where inter­ course becomes satiated, and has no retaining power, it causes the desire, that existed for a time for each other, to glide away through excess of repletion.
On which account it is meet for husbands to give up to mother, and father, and the rela­ tions of the wife their own dwellings, as if they were depart­ ing for a colony, and to live 2observing at the same time and observed, 2 while begetting and rearing children, and handing in succession from some to others life, like a torch,3 and ever paying, according to law, worship to the gods.[19.]
4(We must consider)4 after this by having what pos­ sessions would a person keep his substance in the most careful order.
The majority indeed it is not difficult to imagine or possess;
but in the case of domestic servants there is a diffi­ culty on every side.
Now the reason for this we can assign in a certain manner not correctly, and again in a certain man­ ner correctly;
for we consider what is said respecting slaves to be contrary, and yet according to, the use of them.
Megil.
How can we say this ?
5
For we do not, 0 guest, understand at all what you are asserting at present.
Athen.
And very reasonably so, Megillus.
For the Helot state amongst the Lacedæmonians would give rise to the greatest doubt and contention to nearly all the Greeks, to some as being well introduced, but to others, not;
1 but a less con­ tention would the enslaving of the Marianduni by the Hera­ cleotes furnish, and the clan of the Penestæ under the dominion of the Thessalians.
1
Looking to which and every thing of that kind, what ought we to do with respect to the possession of servants ?
a subject, that I happened to pass by in my dis­ course, when I was speaking;
and as you have very properly asked me, what I meant, (I say) it is this.
We know, that we should all assert, that it is requisite to possess slaves of the kindest and best dispositions.
For many slaves, by conducting themselves with respect to all virtue better towards some per­ sons than brothers and sons, have preserved their masters, and their possessions and the whole of their dwellings;
for we surely know that these things have been said of slaves.
Athen.
And is not the contrary likewise (said), that, as there is nothing healthy in the soul of a slave, it behoves a person, who possesses any intellect, never to trust at all to that race.
The wisest too of poets has given this opinion, when speaking of Zeus, he says, (Od. xvii. 332,) " Half of their minds wide-seeing Jove has ta'en From men, whose doom has slavery's day brought on.
"Since then each person has got such notions in his mind, some place no confidence at all in the race of slaves, but with goads and whips, not thrice alone, but often, cause the souls of their domestics, as if they had the nature of wild beasts, to become slavish;
but others on the other hand do what is quite the contrary.
Clin.2
How then must we act, since persons thus differ, in the case of our land, touching the possession, and at the same time the punishment of slaves.
Athen.
How, Clinias, is it notI evident that, since man is an animal ill-tempered, he is by no means willing to be easily got under hand2 for the purpose of a compulsory definition, namely, to define in reality a slave, [a free-man,]3 and a master ?
Clin.
So indeed he appears to be a thing difficult to have and hold.
Athen.
(True.)
For it has been often proved by facts in the case of the frequent revolts of the Messenians, that have been wont to occur, and of the cities of those, who possess many servants, speaking one language, how many mischiefs happen ;
and further still, (by)4 the doings and sufferings of all kinds of the thieves, called " Prædones, ”5 who exist round Italy.
By looking to all of which a person would doubt what he ought to do in all matters of this kind.
Two methods then alone are left, namely, for those, who are to act rather easily as slaves, to be not of the same country with each other, and, as much as possible, not of the same language;
6 but to bring them up correctly, and to hold them in honour, not only for their sakes, but much more for the sake of themselves.
6
Now the proper education of such persons is in not behaving insolently towards domestics, but in acting less unjustly towards them, if possible, than towards one's equals.
For he is quite clearly a person reverencing justice naturally and not fictitiously, who truly hates what is unjust as regards those human beings, amongst whom it is easy for him to do a wrong.
He then, who is with respect to the habits and doings of slaves undefiled by an unjust and unholy manner,1 will be the most competent to sow what is suited for the springing up of virtue.
The very same thing one may correctly assert, when speaking at the same time of a despot and a tyrant, and of any person exercising authority of any kind over a party weaker than himself.
It is however necessary3 to punish slaves, 4 and not to make them conceited by admonishing them, as if they were free-men;
and the ad­ dress to a slave ought to be entirely (or) nearly a command;
nor should persons ever in any respect jest with them, whether males or females-acts which many persons do very foolishly towards their slaves-and by making them conceited, render it more difficult during life for their slaves to be governed, and for themselves to govern.
Clin.
You speak correctly.
Athen.
When then a person has become furnished with do­ mestics to the best of his power, as regards their number and fitness to assist in each employment, is it not requisite after this to describe the dwellings ?
Clin. Entirely so.[20.]
Athen.
And of the entire, so to say, house-building, it appears we ought, as regards a new city and one never be­ fore inhabited, to have a care, in what manner each, as respects the temples and walls, ought to be.
The buildings ought5 in­ deed, Clinias, to precede the marriages.
But now, since it exists only in word, it is all very well for matters to stand as they do at present.
When however it shall exist in reality, we will, if god wills, make these (the walls) before the marriages, and then put those things, that are requisite,' to a finish after all matters of this kind.
But at present let us go through in a few words some model merely.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
The temples, then, it is necessary to build around all the market-place, and about the whole city in a circle upon ele­ vated spots, for the sake of defence and purity.
2
And hard by them the dwellings of the rulers, and the courts of justice ;
3 in which, as being most holy, they shall inflict and undergo punish­ ments ;
4 partly, as being about holy matters, and partly, 5 the seats established of such kind of gods;
5 and in these 6 courts of justice, in which6 there shall be fitting suits relating to mur­ ders and whatever crimes are worthy of death.
With respect to the walls, Megillus, I would agree with Sparta, to let them lie sleeping on the earthy and not raise them up on this ac­ count.
2
For well is hymned that poetical saying respecting them, that " walls ought to be 3 of brass and iron,3 rather than made of earth."
But our plan, in addition to this, of sending young men every year into the country to dig out the earth and make trenches, and by means of buildings to keep off the enemy, 4 as if forsooth not suffering them to put their foot on the boundaries of the land, would justly pay the forfeit of very great ridicule.
For we throw round a wall, which in the first place by no means contributes to the health of the citizens ;
and moreover it is wont to produce a cowardly habit in the souls of the inhabitants, by inviting them to fly to it, and not to repel the enemy, nor to find their safety in some persons in the city ever guarding it both night and day, but to fancy that, while they are hedged in with walls and gates and asleep, they will in reality possess the means of safety, as if they were born not to labour, nor knew that an easy life is the result of la­ bour ;
but that, as I conceive,5 from a disgraceful inactivity and easy temper 6 labours naturally result again.
But if there is any need to men of walls, it must needs be that the build­ ings of private dwellings be so laid down from the commence­ ment, that the whole city may be one wall through the equality and similarity of all the dwellings, possessing, as regards the roads, a good fortified position ;
and by the city having thus the form of one house, it would be not unpleasant to look upon ;
and it would be in every respect pre-eminently adapted to the ease of its guards, and the safety of the garrison.
To these points it should be particularly incumbent on those, who are to dwell in it, to direct their care, until those at the commencement are built up, and that the City-Stewards should look to it, and compel the party, who pays no attention, by imposing a fine;
and they ought to have a care with respect to the purity of every thing in the city;
and that no private person seizes upon any public property, either by buildings or diggings;
and moreover it is requisite to take care that the waters from Zeus (i. e. rain water) may run off easily ;
and that every part, both within and without the city, may be fit for dwelling in.
And let the guardians of the laws, knowing all this by expe­ rience, lay down additional laws on all these points, and on such others as the law may from its want of power have omitted.
But since both these matters and the buildings about the market- place, and the particulars relating to the gymnasia, (have been gone through,) 2 and the schools, that have been prepared, and the theatres too, are waiting for scholars and spectators, let us now proceed to what is consequent upon marriages, and keep close to the business of legislation next in order.
Clin.
By all means.
Athen.
3
Let then marriages be considered, Clinias, by us to exist.
3
But the mode of living prior to child-getting should subsist for not less than a year 4 after this;
4 but in what manner it is requisite for a bride and bridegroom to live in a city, which is 1 about to be pre-eminent 1 above the majority of cities—2 a point which is close upon what has been mentioned already2—is a thing not the most easy of all to state.
But though not a few of what have gone before are of such a kind, this will be still more difficult than all of those for the many to take in.
Nevertheless, Clinias, that which appears to be right and true must be mentioned.
Clin.
By all means.[21.]
Athen.
He then, who thinks to promulgate laws for states, as to what manner citizens3 should live and perform their public and common duties, but of their private concerns 4such as necessity does not bind down ought to be let loose,4 and that there should be a license for each person to live as they please each day, and no need for every thing to take place by an order, and [thinks] 5 that by leaving private mat­ ters not regulated by law, persons will be willing, as regards public and common concerns, to live according to law, (he) does not think correctly.
Now on what account has this been asserted ?
On this ;
that we shall lay down that the bride­ grooms ought neither pre-eminently more6 or less, than during the time previous to marriage, to have their living at the com- mon tables.
Now this was 1 a wonderful thing when it took place at first in your country through some war, as it seems, or some other circumstance possessing the same power, estab­ lishing it legally over you,2 when hampered during a paucity of people by a great want of means.
But after you had tasted these common tables, and been compelled by necessity to make use of them, the law was deemed 3 to conduce very greatly 3 to your preservation ;
and in some such manner as this, the employment of common tables was established amongst you.
Clin.
So it appears.
Athen.
What I mentioned as being at that time4 a thing wonderful and fearful for some to enjoin, it would not be now equally difficult for the person enjoining it to establish by law.
But that which follows this, namely, that the thing naturally existing would exist in a proper manner, but not existing at all at present, 5 it would want but little to cause5 the legislator, as the saying of persons in jest is, 6 to card wool for the fire,6 and to do by labouring7 in vain an infinity of things of this kind, it is 8 not easy to mention, nor, after mentioning, to accomplish.
8Clin.
What is this, guest, which you appear, although at­ tempting to mention, so vehemently to shrink from ?
Athen.
You shall hear, in order that there may be no longer needlessly a waste of time about it.
For every thing, that in a state partakes of order and law, produces every good;
but of things that are without order, or ordered badly, the majority 1loosens some of the well ordered, and destroys others:
1 which has' just now happened touching the matter under discus­ .sion.
For in the case of your countrymen, Clinias and Megillus, the common tables relating to the men have been instituted in both a beautiful, and, as I have said, wonderful manner, from a certain divine necessity;
but those relating to the women have been by no means correctly left unregulated by law;
nor has the arrangement of their common tables been brought to light.
But though3 the female sex is really.
rather more given to secrecy and stealth, on account of its weakness, than we men are, yet it is not properly dismissed, as being difficult to regulate in consequence of the legislator conceding this point.
For, through this being neglected, many things have in your state glided by, which would have been far better than they at present are, had they met with laws.
For the want of regulations 5 relating to women, is not, as it would seem, when disregarded, merely the half (of human concerns);
6 but, by how much the nature of women is worse than that of men, as regards virtue, by so much does it differ in being more than the double (as regards vice).
7
This therefore to take up again and to correct, and to arrange all pursuits in common for women and men, is better for the happiness of the state.
But at present mankind is so led on in a manner by no means fortunate for this purpose, that it is the part of a person with mind not even to mention it in some other places and states, where it has been voted that common tables shall not exist at all in a city.
How then shall any one without being laughed at attempt in reality to compel women to make their consumption of meat and drink a conspicuous spectacle ?
For there is nothing which that sex would with more diffi­ culty endure than this.
For being accustomed to live in re­ tirement' and obscurity it will, when brought by force into the light, make every possible resistance, and greatly over­ power the legislator.
This sex then, as I have said, would not elsewhere endure a reason urged even correctly, without making every kind of outcry;
but in this state perhaps they would.
If then it is agreeable to you, for the sake of convers­ ation, that our reasoning, as regards every kind of polity, should not be imperfect,2 I am desirous of telling you, how good and becoming a thing this is;
if, as I said, it seems good to you to hear;
but if not, to leave it alone.
Clin.
But, 0 guest, it does seem by all means wonderfully good for us to hear.[22.]
Athen.
Let us then hear it.
But do not wonder, 3if I appear to you to make an attempt from some source far back.
3
For we are now in the enjoyment of leisure, and there is nothing pressing us so as to prevent our seeing on every side and in every way what relate to the laws.
Clin.
You have spoken correctly.
Athen.
Let us then return to what was stated at first.
For it is proper for every person to correctly understand so much as this, that the generation of men either never had any beginning at all, nor ever will have an end, but always was and always will be, 4 or that the length of time from which its beginning took place, is so measureless, that even Time would not know it.
4Athen.
What then, do we not think that there have been the establishment and subversion of cities, and all sorts of pur­ suits relating to order and disorder, and the use1 of drink and food, (and) the desires of all kinds of those, mad in the affairs of love, and through all the earth, and all varieties in the al­ terations of seasons, in which it is likely that animals have un­ dergone very many changes ?
Athen.
What then ?
Do we believe that vines appeared somehow, not having existed previously;
and in a similar manner olives, and the gifts of Demeter and her virgin daugh­ ter ;
and that a certain Triptolemus was the minister of such powers ;
and do we not think that during the time, in which these did not exist, animals turned to devouring each other, as they do now ?
Athen.
But we see the custom remaining even now in many places of men sacrificing each other;
2 and we hear, on the contrary, that in others we did not dare to taste the flesh even of oxen, and that the sacrifices to the gods were not animals, but 1cakes moistened with honey, and fruits,' and other innocent offerings2 of a similar kind;
and that we en­ tirely abstained from flesh, as it was unholy to eat it, and to defile the altars of the gods with blood ;
and that there existed, what is called the Orphic3 life amongst persons of that period, keeping fast to all things without life, but abstaining on the contrary from all that had life.
Clin.
What you say is greatly bruited abroad, and is very easy to be believed.
Athen.
But for what purpose, some one may say, has all this been mentioned now ?
Clin.
You very correctly understand, 0 guest, the matter.
Athen.
I shall endeavour therefore, Clinias, to state, if I can, what follows in order upon this.
Clin. Speak then.
Athen.
I perceive that all things in the case of man hang from a threefold want and desire ;
through which virtue re­ sults to them, if they are properly led, but the contrary, if improperly.
These are, immediately on being born, eating and drinking, for which every animal having an innate love, is full of a mad feeling, and a disinclination to hearken to him, who says that one must do something else than, by satisfying the pleasures and desires connected with such things, to be ever1 freeing oneself from all pain.
But a third, and the greatest want, and a desire the most acute, comes rushing on the last, and causes men to be the most inflamed with all kinds2 of madness, (I mean) that which is on fire with the very great3 sexual passion for propagating the species.
These three diseases it is meet to turn from what is called the most pleasant5 to the best,4 and to endeavour to keep them down by the three greatest (bonds), fear, and law, and truth­ ful reasoning;
and by making use moreover of the Muses, and the gods who preside over contests,6 to extinguish their in­ crease and influx.
7
But after marriages let us place the pro­ creation of children, and after procreation their nurture and instruction.
And by our discourse proceeding in this man­ ner, each law will perhaps advance onwards to (our doctrine of) common tables ;
when, after arriving at communities of this kind, we shall perhaps see betterS by approaching nearer to them, whether they ought to exist of women likewise, or of men alone;
and by putting into order the institutions an­ tecedent to these, which are at present not laid down by law, we will consider them previously;
and, as has been just now said, we shall see them more accurately, and lay down laws more suited to them and becoming.
7Clin.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
Let us then keep in recollection what has been just now said ;
for perhaps we shall have a need of it hereafter.
Clin.
What do you bid us (remember) ?
Athen.
That which we defined by three words.
For we surely spoke about eating, and secondly, drinking, and thirdly, a kind of madness in the matters of love.
Clin.
We will by all means, 0 guest, recollect, 1what you now bid us (to do).
1Athen.
It is well.
Let us proceed then to the affairs of marriage, and teach the parties how and in what manner they ought to get children ;
and, if we cannot persuade them, we will threaten them with certain laws.[23.]
Athen.
It is requisite for the bride and bridegroom to consider, that they are about to exhibit to the state chil­ dren, the most beautiful and the best in their power.
Now all persons, who share in any work, when they give their minds to themselves and the work, produce the whole beauti­ ful and good;
but the contrary, when they do not give their minds, or do not possess any.
Let the bridegroom then give his mind both to the bride and to child-getting;
and in the same way let the bride give her mind to the bridegroom pre- eminently at the time when children have not yet been born to them.
And let the women, whom we have chosen, be the over­ seers of these matters, whether many or few, just as the rulers may order, as many and at what time they please ;
and let them assemble every day in the temple of Eileithuia,2 and (continue there) for the third part of an hour;
3 where they shall, on being assembled, tell, if they have seen any man or woman, of those connected with child-getting, looking to any thing else than to what are ordained to be done during the sacrifices and sacred ceremonies pertaining to marriage.
Let the procreation of children, and the supervision of those con­ nected with child-getting above mentioned, continue for ten years, but not for a longer time, when there is a fecundity in generation.
But should some continue unprolific for this space of time, let them, after having consulted with their kindred, and the women that are in power, be divorced for the benefit of each party.
If however any dispute arises respecting what is proper and beneficial to each, let them select ten of the guardians of the law, 1 and abide by what they shall im­ pose and ordain.'
And let these women, entering into the houses of the young folks, partly by admonitions and partly by threats, cause them to cease from their error and ignorance.
But if they are unable to do so, let them go and speak to the guardians of the law;
and let these restrain the parties.
If they too are unable to effect any thing, let them bring the mat­ ter before the public assembly, after having put up in writing the names of the parties, and made an affidavit that they are unable to make this or that person better.
And let him, who is indicted, unless he can obtain a verdict in a court of law against the parties so putting up in writing his name, be dis­ graced on these points ;
2 (namely), let him not go to weddings, nor to the rites solemnized for children;
3 and should he go, let any one who wishes scourge him with stripes with impunity.
And let there be the same enactments in the case of a woman.
For let her not share in female out-goings 4 and honours, and the visits made at weddings, and at the birth-rites5 of children, if she be indicted as acting disorderly, 1 and does not obtain a verdict..
But when they are begetting children according to law, if any man has a connexion with another woman for such a purpose, or a woman with another man, while such other parties are getting children, let the same fines be imposed upon them, as have been mentioned in the case of those 2 still getting them.
2
After this let the man and woman, who act temper­ ately with respect to such points, be altogether in good re­ pute, but those who act contrariwise be held in a contrary light, or dishonoured rather.
And if the majority act with moder­ ation in matters of this kind, let such points lie in silence without being established by law;
but if they act disorderly, 3 let enactments be laid down in this way, and punishment enacted3 according to the laws then laid down.
The first year is the beginning of the whole of life to every one ;
which ought to be written in the temples of their fathers, as the be­ ginning of life, both to a boy and girl.
In every Phratria4 too, let the number of the rulers5 that are numbered for a year, be written on a whitened wall, and near to them the names of those still living in the Phratria be always written ;
but blot out those who have departed from life.
Let the limits of a marriageable age for a female be from sixteen to twenty years of age-and let this be the longest definite time-but for a man from thirty to thirty-five;
and let the time for any public office be, in the case of a woman, forty years of age;
but in that of a man, thirty;
but with respect to war, for a man from twenty to sixty years ;
but for a woman, should it appear necessary to employ her for warlike purposes, and after she shall have brought forth children, up to fifty years of age, enjoining what is possible and becoming for each.
CHILDREN then, both male and female, having been begotten, it will be most correct to speak next about their nurture and education;
which it is perfectly impossible to be1 not men­ tioned ;
and being mentioned it will appear to us to be rather like a kind of teaching and admonition than laws.
For the numerous and trifling and not conspicuous matters, which happen to all privately, and in each family, since they easily take place through the pain, and pleasure, and desire of the respective individuals, will render, contrary to the advice of the legislator, the habits of the citizens all-various, and not similar to each other.
Now this is an evil to states.
For on account of their insignificance and frequency, to make them subject to a fine would be at the same time unbecoming and unseemly.
But it destroys2 even the laws already laid down in writing, if persons are accustomed to act contrary to law in things insig­ nificant and numerous;
so that it is difficult to lay down laws concerning them, and yet impossible to be silent.
But what I mean to say, I must endeavour to show clearly by bringing, as it were, samples to the light;
for there seems (to be) on what is now said in some respect a darkness.
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
Has not then this been rightly said, that a nurture perfectly correct ought to show itself able to render both bodies and souls the most beautiful and best ?
Athen.
Now the most beautiful bodies I conceive, (to speak) in the most simple style, ought, while boys are still young, to grow up in the most upright manner.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
What then, do we not understand this, that the first shooting forth of every animal is produced the greatest and most abundant by far;
so that it has given rise to a dispute amongst many, whether the length of human bodies does or does not become by increase from the age of five years doubled1 in the remaining twenty-five ?2Clin.
True.
Athen.
What then, when a great increase flows on without much and commensurate exercise, do we not know that it produces ten thousand maladies in bodies ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
There is need then of most exercise, when most nu­ triment is introduced into bodies.
Clin.
What then, 0 guest, shall we enjoin upon the recently born, and the youngest, the greatest exertions ?
Athen.
By no means;
but to those still prior, who are being nourished in the wombs of their mothers.
Clin.
How say you, thou best (of men) ?
Are you speak­ ing of those in a.state of being conceived ?
Athen.
Yes.
But it is not at all wonderful for you to be ignorant of the exercise of such as these;
which, although it seems absurd, I am willing to render clear to you.
Clin.
By all means (do so).
Athen.
For us indeed a thing of this kind is more easy to understand through some persons playing there3 sports more than is needful.
For with us not only children, but some older men, bring up the young of birds,4 and exercise such kinds of wild animals1 in fighting with each other, and they are far from thinking that the labours are moderate, in which by exercising they stir them up.
For in addition to this, 2 each taking under their arms the smaller in their hands, and the larger under their arms within,2 they walk about, going many stadia, and this, not for the sake of the good state of their own bodies, but for that of the birds.
And thus much they signify to the person capable of learning, that all bodies are benefited by shakings and motion, 3when moved without weariness, of all that3 are moved by themselves, or by swings,4 or carried on the sea,5 or on horseback, or borne along in any manner soever by other bodies;
6 and through these getting the mastery over food and drink, they are able to impart to us health, and beauty, and 7 the rest of strength.7[2.]
Since then such is the case, what shall we say we ought to do after this ?
Are you willing for us to say with a laugh, that we are laying down laws for the pregnant woman to walk about, and to mould the infant as a thing of wax, while it is yet flexible, and to put it in swathing-clothes until it is two years old;
and that we are moreover compelling the nurses by legal fines to carry the children either into the fields, or to the temples, or their acquaintance, until they are suffici­ ently able to stand alone ;
and then that they should be careful, lest by the limbs becoming distorted, while forcibly resting on them, being still young, to undergo the additional labour of carrying the infant, until it had completed its third year ;
and that the nurses ought to be as strong as possible;
and, in addition, that unless these things take place to each child, we are to enact a fine upon those who do not act so ?
or is this far from being the case ?
For that, which has just now been mentioned, would happen to us without stint.
1Clin.
What is that?
Athen.
To pay the debt of abundant laughter, through2 the womanlike and servile manners of the nurses being unwilling to obey us.
3Clin.
But on what account then did we say that this ought to be stated ?
Athen.
On this.
A person, on hearing4 of the habits of masters and free persons in states, would perhaps come to the correct conception, that, without a proper administration of private concerns taking place in states, one would think there would be vainly any stability in the laying down of laws ;
and so thinking, he would make use of the laws just now mentioned ;
and using them correctly, he would by his ad­ ministration render both his own household and the city happy.
Clin.
You have spoken very reasonably.
Athen.
Let us then not desist from the legislation of this kind, until we have given out the pursuits relating likewise to the souls of very young children in the same manner as we began to go through the subject, when the accounts were stated relating to the body.
Clin.
Perfectly right.
Athen.
Let us then receive this as an element with respect to both the circumstances, 1[the body and soul,]1 of the very young, that the nursing and motion, taking place as much as possible all the night and day, are profitable to all, and not the least 2 to the youngest;
so that,2 if it were possible, they may live as if always sailing on the sea.
But now, 3 (since this is impossible,)3 it is requisite to act as near as possible to this with respect to 4 the newly born nurslings of children.
4
And 5 (what ought to be done) one may conjecture5 from this, that both the nurses of infants, and those who are initiated in the remedies 6 relating to the Corybantes,6 have adopted this from experience, and know it to be useful.
For, when mothers are desirous to put to sleep their children, who sleep with dif­ ficulty, they do not bring to them a state of quietness, but, on the contrary, of motion, by shaking them ever in their arms ;
nor yet that of silence, but that of singing to them ;
and they artlessly7 soothe their children, as it were, by the sound of a pipe, and, as the remedies of the mad Bacchants are em­ ployed,8 by making use, at the same time, of the movements in music and the dance.
Clin.
What then, 0 guest, is especially the cause of this ?
Athen.
It is not very difficult to know.
Clin.
How so?
Athen.
Both these passions result from fear;
and there are certain terrors through a depraved habit of the soul.
When therefore any one brings from without an agitation to passions of this kind, that which is from without overcomes the dreadful and insane motion within ;
and after overcoming, it seems to have produced a calm in the soul, and a quietness in the leap­ ing, which had been troublesome as regards the heart of each ;
'(and) thus, (what is) altogether agreeable,1 it causes some to obtain by lot2 sleep;
but others, who are awake, and dancing and soothed by the pipe under the influence of the divinities, to whom each may be supplicating and sacrificing, it causes to possess habits of sound sense in the place of a maddened state.
Now this, to speak in brief, has in this way a certain probable reason.
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Now if these things possess thus any such power, it is requisite to consider this point as connected with them, that every soul, which has been familiar with fear from youth, would be more accustomed to be conversant with fears.
3
But this every one will surely say is an exercise of timidity, and not of fortitude.
Athen.
But the contrary pursuit we should say is that of fortitude, in the overcoming, even from youth, what falls upon us in the shape of fears and terrors.
Clin.
Correctly so.
Athen.
Let us say then, that this one thing, the all-perfect gymnastic exercise of children in motion, greatly contributes to a part of virtue1 in the soul.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
And moreover, that a disposition, morose or not, in the soul 2 would become and be called 2 respectively no little part of cowardice or bravery.
Athen.
In what manner then is to be implanted which of these we may wish in the newly born ?
We must endeavour to state how and to what extent a person may have an easy road in these matters.[3.]
Athen.
I will mention then the fixed opinion with us, that luxury renders the manners of youth morose and irascible, and vehemently agitated by things of a trifling nature;
but that an excessive and rustic servitude causes them to be con­ trary to this, abject and illiberal, and man-haters, and unfitting associates.
CUn.
But how will the whole state be able to bring up those, who have as yet no perception of language, and are un­ able to have any taste for the rest of instruction ?
Athen.
Somehow in this way.
Every animal, as soon as it is born, is wont to utter some sound with a loud cry, and not the least the human species ;
and more than the rest of animals it is affected in addition to its crying with the shedding of tears.
CUn.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Now nurses, looking to what infants are desirous of, make a conjecture by their presenting to them something.
For they think they correctly offer that, on which being pre­ sented the children are silent;
but incorrectly that, at which it sheds tears and cries out.
For in the case of children tears and cries are the indications of what they love and hate, (and are) signs by no means lucky.
Now this period is not less than three years, a not small portion of life to pass through badly or not badly.
Clin.
You speak correctly.
Athen.
Does not a person who is morose, and by no means good-tempered, appear to you to be for the most part given to lamentation and, full of meanings more than is fitting for the good to be ?
Clin.
It appears so to me.
Athen.
What then, if a person were to endeavour, by bring­ ing together every method, during those three years, that the nursling may be affected as little as possible with sorrow and fears and with every pains in our power, do we not think that we should render then the soul of the nursling more cheerful and kind ?
Clin.
It is evident, 0 guest;
and most of all, should any one supply it with many pleasures.
Athen.
In this I cannot, 0 wondrous man, follow Clinias.
For with us such conduct would be a destruction the great­ est of all.
1 For it occurs perpetually at the commence­ ment of nurtured
But let us see whether we are asserting any thing.
Clin.
State what you mean.
Athen.
That our discourse is at present about a not trifling matter.
Do you then, Megillus, look to it, and decide between us.
For my assertion is, that an upright life ought neither to pursue pleasures, nor entirely to avoid pain, but to embrace the medium between them, which I have just now denominated a favourable temper ;
a disposition, of which, according to some voice of an oracle, we correctly speak as belonging to a deity.
2
This habit, I assert, that he amongst us ought to pursue, who would be divine;
nor let him go wholly headlong to pleasures ;
for in this case he would not be free from pain ;
nor let him per­ mit any other person, old or young, male or female, to suffer a the same thing with us,3 and, as far as he is able, the newly born the least of all.
For all the manners are, through custom, im­ planted in all the most powerfully at that period.
And further still, if I were not about to appear to be jesting, I would say, that one ought to attend to women, who are carrying any thing in the womb, the most of all during that very year, so that the person pregnant may neither enjoy pleasures nu­ merous and violent, nor, on the other hand, feel pains, but live through that period, preserving a line of conduct benignant, and good-tempered, and mild.
Clin.
There was no need, 0 guest, of your asking Megillus, which of us spoke in the more proper manner;
for I agree with you, that all persons ought to avoid a life of unmingled pleasure and pain, and that they should always pursue a cer­ tain middle course.
You have, therefore, both spoken and heard in a proper manner.
Athen.
Very properly so, Clinias.
But, in addition to these points, let us all three consider this likewise.[4.]
Atlien.
That all these matters, which we are now going through, are by the many called unwritten laws;
and that those, which they call the laws of the country, are no other than of such a kind ;
and further still, that the discourse, which has just now flowed upon us, how that we ought not either to call them laws, or to permit them to be unmen­ tioned, has been spoken correctly.
For these are the bonds of all polity, existing in a middle state between all laws that have been, and are, and will be hereafter, laid down in writing ;
and being, as it were, altogether the laws of a country, and ancient in every respect, and which, when laid down correctly and have become a custom, have invested the written laws with every kind of security ;
but should they advance impro­ perly beyond what is right, they cause, like supports placed by carpenters in the buildings of houses, and gliding away from the centre, every thing to fall together to the same point, and to lie, some under others, both themselves and what has been subsequently built upon them, after the old portions have se­ cretly given way.
Reflecting upon which, it is necessary for us, 0 Clinias, to bind together your city new on all sides, and to the utmost of our power to omit nothing great or small which a person may call laws, or manners, or pursuits;
for by all things of this kind a state is bound together;
but none of these can be stable without each other;
so that one need not wonder, if many and at the same time trifling things, ap­ pearing to us to be enactments, or even customs, should, when flowing to the same point, cause the laws to become of a greater length.
Clin.
Both you speak properly yourself, and we too shall reflect in this manner.
Atlien.
If then, in the case of a boy and girl of three years old, any one should bring these matters accurately to an end, and make use of what has been said in not a careless man­ ner, they will be of no small advantage to those recently brought up.
But there will be a need of sports1 for the habits of the soul at three, and four, and five, and even six years of age.
But we must already remove them from luxury, by chastising them, not in an ignominious manner, but, as we said on the subject of slaves, by chastising not with insults so as to encourage an angry feeling in them, when so chastised, nor a feeling for licentiousness by suffering them to go unpunished, we must do the same in the case of the free-born.
Now the sports of persons of that age are self-produced;
and which, when they come together, they almost invent themselves.
2
All children then of this kind ought to come together at the tem­ ples distributed through the villages, from three to six years of age, each of those belonging to the same village to the same spot in common;
and let the nurses take cognizance of their or­ derly behaviour and licentiousness ;
3 but of the nurses them­ selves and their whole pack, let one of the twelve women be appointed to each to regulate for the space of a year, of those of the before-mentioned, whom the guardians of the law may have ordained.
3
And let the women, who have full powers over the care of marriages, choose them, one out of each ward, and of the same age with themselves ;
and let her, who is appointed, perform her office, by going each day to the temple, and ever punishing the person who does wrong, a male and female slave, and a stranger, male or female, herself, (or)' by means of certain domestics2 of the state ;
and let her take a citizen, when disputing about his punishment, before the City-Stewards for trial;
but let her punish herself, even a citi­ zen, when there is no dispute.
After six years of age, let each sex be separated ;
and let boys pass their time with boys, and girls in like manner with each other;
and it is meet for each to be turned to learning, the males from the teachers of horse­ manship, and archery, and the hurling of darts, and the using of slings, and the females too, if they consent so far as to learn espe­ cially what relates to the use of arms.
But what is at present established on matters of this kind, is unknown to nearly all.
Clin.
What is that ?[5.]
Athen.
That what relates to the right and the left hand differs naturally,3 with respect to their use in the several actions pertaining to the hands;
especially since there appears in what relates to the feet and the lower limbs no difference as regards labour.
But in the case of hands we each of us become, as it were, lame, through the (folly and) 1 ignorance of our nurses and mothers.
For while the nature of our limbs on each side 2 is nearly balanced, we have ourselves, by not using them correctly, made them, through habit,3 different.
In such employments as where there is no great difference, it is of no consequence, whether a person makes use of a lyre with his left hand and of the plectrum4 with his right, and whatever else is of a similar kind.
But to make use of these examples in other cases, 5where there is no need of using it,5 is nearly a folly.
This fact has the law of the Scythians pointed out, where a person does not push from him the bow with his left hand (merely), and draw to himself the arrow with his right merely, but he makes use of either similarly for both purposes.
And there are very many other examples of this kind in charioteering and other things.
From which one may learn, that those, who make the left hand weaker than the right, act contrary to nature.
This, as I have said, is of no great moment in the case of plectra made of horn, and such like instruments;
but in war, when it is necessary to use weapons of iron, and bows, and spears, 6and each of these,6 it matters much ;
but it is of the greatest moment by far, when it is necessary to use shields against shields.
There is too a great difference between a person learning and one not learn­ ing, and between one, who exercises himself, and one, who is not exercised.
For as he, who is perfectly exercised in the pan- cratium,l or in boxing, or wrestling, is incapable of com­ bating with his left-hand limbs, and becomes lame, and drags himself along in a superfluous manner,2 when any one, causing him to change his position, compels him to exert himself on the other side, so the same thing, I conceive, one must expect in the case of shields, and in all the rest of weapons, that it behoves him, who possesses doubly the arms by which he can defend himself and attack others, not to suffer, to the utmost of his power, either3 of these to remain idle, and without skill ;
4 but if any one were born, possessing the nature of Geryon or Briareus,5 he ought to be able with their hundred hands to hurl a hundred darts.
Of all these matters it is meet for the care to be under the female and male rulers;
the former being superintendents over the sports and nurture (of the children), but the latter over their education, in order that all the boys and girls by having the perfect use of their feet and their hands may do, to the best of their power, no injury to their natures by their habits.[6.]
6But a twofold education, so to say, it will happen to make use of;
6 one, of gymnastics, relating to the body ;
the other, of music, for the sake of a good state of the soul.
Again, those of the gymnastics are twofold ;
one dancing and the other wrestling.
And of dancing one kind imitates the diction of the Muse,l preserving the gorgeous at the same time with the liberal;
but another kind is for the sake of a good habit of body, and lightness, and the beauty of its limbs and parts, their own harmonious motion being imparted to each, (according to)2 what is becoming in their bending and ex­ tending, 3 and, at the same time, scattered through and follow­ ing upon every kind of dancing sufficiently.
3
The wrestling, however, which Antaeus' or Cercyon5 placed among their arts, for the sake of useless contention, or the boxing, which Epeius6 or Amycus7 did likewise, do not deserve to be graced by a discourse, as being of no use in the fellowship of war.
But what relates to a stand-up wrestling, and the untwisting of the neck, and the hands, and the sides, when the labour is accompanied with a spirit for contention and a well-framed arrangement of body, for the sake of strength and health, these, as they are useful in every way, are not to be omitted;
but we must enjoin upon disciples and masters at the same time, that when we come to that point of our laws, the latter are to impart with a good will all information of this kind, and the former to receive it with thanks.
Nor must we omit such imitations in dances as are fit to be imitated;
as regards this place, the armed sports of the Curetes ;
8 and, as regards Lacedæmon, those of the Dioscuri.
1
Our virgin too and mistress (Athéné) being delighted with the amusement of the dance, does not think fit to sport with empty hands;
but, being adorned with a complete suit of armour, goes in this manner through the dance;
2 which acts it will be proper for the boys and girls to imitate, and to do honour to the kindness of the goddess shown during the needs of war, and in behalf of festive days.
It will likewise be proper for the boys forthwith, 3 and for as long a time as they shall not have gone out to war, to make to all the gods processions and pomps, with the adornment of arms and horses, and to perform their supplications to the gods and the sons of the gods, swifter and slower, with dances and marches;
and to enter into contests, and preludes of contests, if for any pur­ pose, for not other than these.
For these, both in peace and war, are useful for a polity and private households.
But the rest of labours, and sports, and pursuits relating to the body are not, Megillus and Clinias, suited to free-men.
And thus the gymnastic, which I said in our former discourse ought to be gone through, I have almost gone through at the present moment, and the subject is finished.
But if you have any thing better than this, lay it down as a common topic and speak upon it.
Clin.
It is not easy, 0 guest, to put these on one side, and to have any thing better to say about gymnastics and contests.
Athen.
With regard then to the gifts of the Muses and Apollo, which is the sequel to the preceding, we formerly thought that, as having said 4 all correctly4 (about them), we should have to leave only the subject relating to gymnastics ;
but now it is evident that there is something which should be first mentioned before all.
Let us then speak of it in order.
Clin.
It must by all means be spoken of.
Athen.
Hear me then, although you have heard previously.
Nevertheless it is requisite for both the speaker and hearer to be cautious as to what is very strange and unusual ;
and now too, although I am going to tell a tale not to be spoken without fear, I will nevertheless take courage, and not stand aloof.
Clin.
What mean you, 0 guest, by this ?[7.]
Athen.
I mean that in all states it is a thing unknown to all, that the family of games is of the greatest power in the laying down of laws, as to whether what are laid down will remain or not.
1 For if it is so ordered, that the same persons shall always use the same (sports),1 and according to the same, and in a similar manner,2 and be delighted with the same play­ things, it permits the institutions laid down with seriousness to remain quiet.
"But when the sports are disturbed, and innovations made in them, and they are affected constantly by changes, the young never speaking of the same things as being dear to them, and neither in the bearing of their own bodies, nor in the rest of their dresses, the becoming and the unbe­ coming are laid down as acknowledged by them, and when the person, who is ever making some innovation, and introducing something different from what is customary, as regards shape and colour, and every thing of that kind, is pre-eminently held in honour, we should, by saying that no greater bane could happen to a state than by such a thing, speak most cor­ rectly ;
for he is secretly changing the morals of the young, and causing what is old to be dishonoured, and what is novel to be held in honour.
Than this, both an assertion and a fixed opinion, I assert again, there is not a greater bane to all states.
Hear, then, how great an evil do I say it is.
Clin.
Do you mean the circumstance, that what is old in states is found fault with ?
Athen.
Entirely so.
Clin.
You will then have in us no ordinary auditors, with respect to this very discourse, but the best disposed possible.
Athen.
It is likely.
Clin.
Only speak then.
Athen.
Come then, let us hear it 1more attentively than we usually do,1 and thus speak to each other.
For we shall discover that a change in all things, except the bad, causes us to stum­ ble the most, in the case of all seasons, 2 and winds,2 and in the diet of bodies, and in the manners of souls, and not merely, so to say, 3in some, but not in others,3 but in what4 I have just now said, in things bad.
5
So that (any one will see), if he looks to5 bodies, how, being accustomed to all kinds of food and all kinds of drink and labours, they do, although they are at first disturbed by them, in time generate from those very substances flesh, kindred to such substances, and by be­ coming friendly and accustomed to, and acquainted with, all that diet, they exist in the best way as regards pleasure and health.
But if at any time a person6 is compelled by neces­ sity to change any part of the approved diet, he is at first disturbed by diseases, and with difficulty is set on his legs again, 1 2 after acquiring again a familiarity with his food.
2
The same thing, it is meet to think, takes place as regards the ideas of men, and the nature of their souls.
For every soul has a reverence for the laws in which it may have been brought up,3 and which have, by a certain divine good fortune, re­ mained undisturbed 4 through time (so) long and much, that 4 no one either recollects or has ever heard of their having been otherwise than they are at present, and it fears to disturb any of those then existing.
The legislator then ought to devise from some quarter a plan as to the manner in which this may take place in a state.
In this way then do I discover it.
All men, as I have said before, consider the sports of youth, when they are disturbed, to be in reality sports, and not that the greatest seriousness and mischief arise out of them;
so that they do not avert (the change,)5 but comply with and yield to it;
nor do they consider this, 6 that the children, who engage in these new sports, must necessarily become men different from those who were children in the former period ;
s and that, becoming different, they will seek a different life;
and so seeking will be desirous of other pursuits and laws ;
and no one fears that, after this, there will come upon states what has been just now called the greatest evil.
But other changes would effect lesser evils such at least as relate to fashions would suffer a thing of this kind.
But whatever alterations occur frequently with respect to praise and blame, touching the question of manners, these would, I think, be the greatest of all, and require the most caution.[8.]
Athen.
What then, do we still believe in our former assertion, in which we stated that the matters relating to rhythm and every kind of music are imitations of the man­ ners of men better and worse ?
Or how ?
Clin.
Our fixed opinion would be in no respect otherwise than this.
Athen.
We assert then, that we must contrive every kind of plan in order that the children in our state may not hanker after other imitations in dancing and singing, nor any one persuade them (to an innovation) 1 by introducing pleasures of various kinds.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
Has then any one of us any art better for this pur­ pose than that of the Egyptians ?
Clin.
What art do you mean ?
Athen.
Of making holy every kind of dancing and melody, by ordaining, in the first place, festivals, after calculating2 for the year, what ought to take place, and at what time, and in honour of what gods respectively, and the sons of gods, and dæmons ;
and after this, what ode ought to be hymned at each sacrifice of the gods, and with what dances to honour the then sacrifice:
3wbich when they are ordained,3 (it is meet to) ordain some other things, so that all the citizens may in common make sacrifices (and) 4 libations to the Fates, and to all the other deities, (and) consecrate their several odes to the gods severally, and to the others.
5
But if any person intro- duces in honour of any god other hymns and dances besides those which are instituted by law, let the priests and priest­ esses, together with the guardians of the laws, restrain him in a holy manner, and according to law ;
and let him, who is restrained, if he is not willingly restrained, (suffer) the pun­ ishment of his impiety through the whole of life from any one who is willing to inflict it.
Clin. Right.
Athen.
But since we are now engaged on this subject, let us be affected in a manner befitting us.
Clin.
About what are you speaking ?
Alhen.
Every young person, not merely the old, on seeing or hearing any thing out of the way, and by no means custom­ ary, would not immediately 1run thus and concede what is the doubtful point respecting them, but he would stand still;
and, as if being where three roads meet, and not knowing very well the road, whether he happened to be travelling alone, or in company with others, he would inquire of himself and the others, and not proceed before he had settled the question in his mind, as to whither the road would lead him.
And we must act in a similar manner at present.
For a strange con­ versation having now fallen upon us on the subject of laws, we ought necessarily to make every inquiry;
and, being of such an age, to speak not readily on matters of such moment, insist­ ing with vehemence, that we have it in our power to say something clearly on the instant.
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
We will, therefore, give the subject time, and decide then firmly upon it, when we shall have considered it suffi­ ciently.
But in order that we may not be prevented from going through in vain the arrangement consequent upon the laws, let us proceed to the end of them.
For, perhaps, if god wills, this very digression will obtain wholly its completion, and point out sufficiently what is at present a matter of doubt.
Clin.
You speak most excellently, 0 guest, and we will do as you say.
Athen.
Let then, we say, this strange thing be decreed, that odes exist for us as laws, [and]1 just as the ancients gave such a name, as it seems, formerly 2 with respect to playing on the harp;
2 so that, perhaps, not even they would have entirely dissented from what is said by us at present;
and some one has surely, as if either in a night dream or with his eyes open in the day, imagined and prophesied this.
Let this then be the decree respecting it.
Let no one utter any song besides the public and sacred songs, or move in any dance, contrary to the whole dancing of the young men, any more than (lie would act) contrary to any other law:
and let him, who is such,3 be dismissed without a fine ;
but let, as was said just now, the guardians of the laws, and the priests and priestesses, chastise him, who does not obey.
Let then this be held to be laid down by us in our discourse.
Clin.
Let it be laid down.[9.]
Athen.
But in what manner can any one, so laying them down as laws, not be altogether a laughing-stock?
4
Let us still consider something of this kind respecting them.
4
It is the safest course to mould for them, as it were, certain impressions in our discourse.
Now I assert that one of the impressions is something of this kind.
The sacrifice having taken place and the victims burnt according to law, if some person, a son, we say, or a brother, should 5 as a private person stand by the altars and sacred rites, and blaspheme with every kind of blasphemy, should we not say that he gave vent to a want of thought, and imposed an evil omen and pro­ phecy both against his father and the rest of his kindred ?
Clin.
How not.
Athen.
6Now this is occurring in the places with us, the states, so to say, nearly all by a little.
6
For when any magis­ trate shall have performed any sacrifice publicly, after this there comes not one choir, but a multitude of choirs ;
and standing not far from the altars, but sometimes close to them, they pour forth every kind of blasphemy against things sacred, putting on the stretch1 the souls of the hearers with words, and rhythms, and the most doleful harmonies ;
and he who causes the city, after it has made the sacrifice, to weep the most on the instant, carries off the victory.
2
Do we not reject by our votes this law ?
And if at any time it is re­ quisite for the citizens to hear sorrows of this kind, it should be, not when the days are clear of any stain, but of an inauspi­ cious 3 kind rather ;
and then it is proper for some dancers (and)4 singers to be hired from abroad, just as those, who are hired at funerals,5 send forward 6 the dead7 with some Carian strain.
A thing of this kind would properly take place about such odes8 as these.
Moreover a robe will be proper for funeral odes,9 and not crowns, or golden ornaments, but every thing the contrary, that I may be freed as quickly as possible from speaking on these matters.
But thus much do I ask of you again, whether of the impressions relating to odes it is agree­ able I to you for this first one to be laid down ?2Clin.
Of what kind.
A then.
As a good omen ;
and moreover, let the genus of the ode be every where, and in every respect, a good omen to us.
Or shall I not ask you at all, but lay it down thus ?
Clin.
Lay it down by all means;
for by all votes this law is the victor.
Athen.
What then, after this good omen, shall be the second law of music ?
Will it not be for prayers to be (offered) to the gods, to whom we on each occasion sacrifice ?
Athen.
But the third law, I think, will be, that it behoves poets, when they know that 3 prayers are requests from men to the gods,3 ever4 to direct their mind very carefully to this point,5 that they may not unconsciously ask for what is an evil, as if it were a good.
6
For the condition of a prayer of this kind taking place, would, I think, be ridiculous.
Athen.
Were we not a little while ago convinced, that a Plutus, neither of silver nor of gold, ought to dwell in a state, as if settled there ?
eliM.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Of what then shall we say that this discourse has been spoken as the pattern ?
Is it not of this, that riot every race of poets is competent to know thoroughly things good and evil?
Some poet then surely, having composed either in prose or 1verse, on a mistaken subject,1 (so that)2 our citizens make their prayers not correct respecting matters of the greatest moment, 3will not do all with impunity,3 especially since, as we have already said, we shall not find many mis­ takes greater than this.
Let us then lay down this as one of the laws and forms respecting the Muse.
Clin.
What one ?
Speak to us more clearly.
Athen.
That a poet shall not compose any thing, either beautiful or good, contrary to what is lawful and just in the state;
nor shall he be permitted to show what he has com­ posed to any private person, before it shall have been shown to the judges and guardians of the law, appointed for this purpose, and approved of by them.
Now they have been almost marked out, whom we have chosen as the lawgivers relating to music, and the guardian likewise of education.
What then, as I have often asked, shall this be laid down4 as a law, and a type, and a third impression ?
Or how seems it ?
OliM.
Let it be laid down;
how not ?[10.]
Athen.
After these there should be sung hymns to, and praises of, the gods accompanied with prayers;
and after the gods in like manner, there should be prayers with praises to the daemons and heroes, and suited to all of them.
Athen.
And after these there should take place this law without any stint.
Such of the citizens as may have come to the end of life, after having performed works honourable and laborious relating to the body and soul, and have been obedient to the laws, it shall be fitting for these to meet with praises.
Athen.
But to honour those still living with praises and hymns, it is not safe, 1 before a person after having run through the whole of life, shall stand (still) at an honourable end.'
Let all these be common to men and women, who have been con­ spicuously virtuous.
But it is necessary for odes and dancings to be established in this manner.
There are many ancient and beautiful poems of old writers relating to music, and simi­ larly to dancing for bodies.
2
Against choosing out of these what is becoming and suited to an established polity, there is no objection.
Of these let the persons selected3 as ex­ aminers, being not less than fifty years old, make a selection.
And let them select whatever of the ancient poems appears to be all-sufficient;
but whatever is defective, or altogether unsuit­ able, let it be rejected entirely;
or let them take poets and musicians, and employing their powers of poetry, adapt it to a new rhythm after it is corrected ;
4 but let them not give way to pleasure or desire, except in some few cases ;
but, interpreting the intention of the legislator, establish dancing and singing, and every dancing5 according to their own good sense.
For every occupation relating to music, which adopts order, is in­ finitely better than that without order,6 even when the pleasant in music is not added.
Now the pleasant is common to all music.
For that music, with which a person has lived from childhood to a staid and intelligent age, 7 (he considers to be pleasant,) 7 inasmuch as it is temperate and in order.
But on hearing a contrary kind, he dislikes it, and calls it illiberal.
But if he has been brought up in that, which is pleasant and common, he says that the contrary to this is frigid and unpleasant.
So that, as I just now said, what relates to the pleasant or the unplea­ sant does not exist about either as a superabundance, but from a superfluity the one makes those, who have been brought up in it on each occasion better, the other worse.
1Clin.
You have spoken well.
Athen.
Further still, it will be meet to separate the songs suited to females and males, by defining them under a certain type, and necessary moreover to adapt them to harmonies and rhythms.
For it is a shocking thing for the whole of harmony to be a discord, or rhythm to be out of tune, and thus to attribute to melodies nothing adapted to each of them.
2
It is necessary then to lay down by a law the figures of these.
And it is necessary to attribute both constrained to both, but those of the females, by the difference of the nature of each, by this it is meet to mark out clearly.
2
Now that which is gorgeous and verges to fortitude, must be called manly ;
but that which more inclines to the ornamental and the moderate, must be handed down, both in law and in discourse, as more femi­ nine.
This, then, is the order.
After this, let the teaching and handing down of them be detailed, as to the manner how, and the persons by whom, and the time when it is requisite to perform them.
(And) as a shipwright, 3 when he lays down the keel timbers, as the commencement of the ship-building, draws the form of vessels,3 I appear to myself to do the same thing, by endeavouring to distinguish the figures of lives according to the manners of souls, (and) in reality to lay down their keel-timbers, (and) very properly to consider by what device, and after what manner, we may live together and be carried the best during this voyage1 of life.
Human affairs, indeed, are not worthy of great attention;
yet it is necessary to attend to them.
This indeed is not a fortunate circumstance.
But since we are here, if we can somehow accomplish this in a fitting manner, it will perhaps be within our measure.
2
But what am I saying ?
This very point perhaps some one would take up, and rightly so.2Clin.
And very much so.
Athen.
I say then, that to a serious thing we ought to pay a serious attention, but to a not serious one none at all;
and that the deity is naturally worthy of every blessed 3 attention, but that man, as I said before,4 has been devised as the play­ thing of a deity, and this is truly his best attribute.
It is necessary then for every man and woman to pursue this mode, and, by engaging in the most beautiful sports, to pass thus through life with thoughts the reverse of what they think at present.
A then.
At present indeed they think that serious pursuits ought to exist for the sake of sports.
For they consider thai they ought to well dispose the serious pursuits relating to war for the sake of peace.
But in war there never has been naturally either sport or instruction worthy of mention, nor is there, nor will there be.
But this we say is a thing to us the most seri­ ous, (that) every one ought to pass through life for the most part and the best in peace.
What then is the proper man­ ner, (in which) 5 a person may pass through life in sport ?
and what are the sports for a person to engage in, while sacrificing and singing and dancing, so as to be able to render the gods propitious to him, and to repel foes, and to be the victor in battle ?
Now by what singing and dancing a person may ac­ complish both these things, a portion of the type has been detailed, and the paths, as it were, have been cut, in which the person is to proceed, who thinks that the poet has well said, (in Od. iii. 26,) " Some things, Telemachus, thou wilt thyself Find in thy heart;
but others will a god Suggest;
for I do not conceive thou hast Been born or brought up 'gainst the will of gods.
"The same ought our nurslings likewise to bear in mind, and to consider that some things have been stated sufficiently, but that others a dæmon and a deity will suggest to them respecting sacrifices and dances in honour of what divinities and at what time they will by playing, each for each, render them propitious, and live themselves according to the manner of their nature, while they are for the most part things to stare at, yet partake in certain small particles of truth.
Megil.
You are vilifying, 0 guest, in every respect the human race.
Athen.
Do not wonder, Megillus, but pardon me.
For, look­ ing to the deity, and being affected (somewhat),1 I have said what I have just [now] 2 said.
But let our race be not a vile thing, if it so please you, but worthy of some serious attention.[11.]
With regard to the subject next in order after these, mention has been made3 of public schools, situate in a tripar­ tite manner in the middle of the city;
but out of and around the city the exercising grounds for horses have been (assigned) in a tripartite manner, and ample places put into order for the sake of the young men, learning and practising themselves in archery and other hurlings of missiles.
But if they were not then spoken of sufficiently, let them now be mentioned in our discourse together with the laws.
In all these cases let masters in each art be induced by wages to reside as strangers, and to teach every one, who fre­ quents their school, the learning that relates to war, and like­ wise to music;
not only the youth, who comes to school, because his father wishes it, but him too who, because (his father) does not (wish), neglects his education, but, as the say­ ing is, 1 every man and boy must by compulsion be instructed as well as they can, since they belong rather to the state than their parents.
The very same things my law would mention relating to females, as it does to males.
2 (For) it it is meet2 to exercise equally the females likewise.
And I should fear to say respecting this subject of horsemanship and gymnastics, that they are becoming indeed to men, but not to women.
For by hearing stories of the olden time have I been persuaded.
And even at present, I know that there are, so to say,3 countless myriads of women about Pontus, whom they call Sauromatides,4 on whom there has been en­ joined an exercise in common with, and perhaps equal to, that of men not only upon horses, but in bows likewise, and in the rest of arms.
But I have, moreover, a reason for this, of some such kind as this.
I say then, that if it is possible for these things to happen in this manner, of all things is that, which now takes place in our countries, the most silly, in the men not pursuing all together, and with all their might, and with one mind, the same pursuits as the women.
For thus the whole state is and becomes but the half, instead of being the double, from the same expense and labour.
And wonderful would this very error be to (any) legislator.
Clin.
It seems so.
Very much however of what has been asserted by us at present is, 0 guest, contrary to customary polities.
Athen.
But I have said 1 that it is meet to permit 2 (us) to go through the discourse properly, and, when we have gone through3 it, to select 4 thus what seems (the best).
4Clin.
You have spoken very elegantly, and caused me to reproach myself for what I just now said.
Speak therefore on this point whatever is agreeable to yourself.[12.]
Athen.
This very thing (is agreeable) 5 to me, Clinias, what I said above, that, if these matters are not sufficiently proved by deeds, that they can take place, it would be possible perhaps to gainsay them by words.
But now something else must be sought for by him, who does not admit this law at all;
but our exhortation will not in this case be extinguished, so that we should say that the female sex ought not to partake as much as possible in education and other studies in common with the male sex.
For it is required that we6 think on these points in some such way as this.
Say then, if women do not share in common with men in the whole of life, is it not necessary for some other arrangement to be assigned to them ?
Clin.
It is necessary.
A then.
What arrangement7 then among those, which are exhibited at present, shall we assign them in preference to this very partnership, which we are assigning to them ?
Is it that, in which the Thracians and many other nations employ their women, to cultivate the ground, and to tend cattle and sheep, and to minister to them in no way different from slaves ?
Or, as we do ourselves, and all around that place ?
1 2 for what happens at present with us, is in this way.
2
For having brought together into one dwelling, according to the saying, 3all our chattels,3 we hand over to the women the power to act as stewards, and to rule over the shuttles and all kinds of working in wool.
Or shall we, Megillus, speak of a medium between these, adopted in Laconia ?
so that the virgins should live, partaking in gymnastic exercises and music, but the married women be unemployed in wool-work,4 but, weaving a kind of active life and in no respect mean or worthless, arrive at some middle point in the duties of attendants and stewards and bringers up of children;
but not to take a part in warlike concerns, so as not to fight, even should a necessity arise from any accident to do so, in behalf of their city and children, nor be able with skill to take a part in the use of bows, like certain Amazons, or in any other kind of dart­ hurling ;
5 nor yet, seizing the spear and shield, to imitate the goddess, and standing up nobly for their country, while it is laid waste, 6 strike terror at least, if able to do 6 nothing more, into the foe, when they are seen drawn up in a kind of array.
And yet living even in this manner, they would not dare to imitate at all the Sauromatides, who would appear, as compared with them, to be men.
Let then the person, who is willing to praise your legislators on these points, praise them;
but my opinion will not be given otherwise.
For a legislator ought be a perfect and not a half one, who permits the female sex to indulge in luxury and waste by making use of an unregulated living, and who, by taking a complete care of the male sex, leaves to the state nearly the half instead of the double of a happy life.
Megil.
What shall we do, Clinias ?
Shall we permit our guest thus to run down our Sparta ?
Clin.
Certainly.
For, since a liberty of speech has been given to him, we must permit him, until we shall in every way have gone through the laws sufficiently.
Megil.
You speak correctly.
Athen.
Is it not then nearly my business to endeavour to unfold what follows upon this ?[13.J Athen.
What then will be the mode of life amongst men, for whom what is necessary may be procured in modera­ tion, and the affairs of art handed over to others, and agricul­ ture committed to slaves, who are to pay the first-fruits of the earth, sufficient for persons who live in a moderate manner;
and common meals adopted, the men being placed apart, but their household kept near them, 1 and the female children like­ wise,' and their mothers;
and where all these common meals are regulated by male and female governors, so that, after having inspected them daily, and seen the behaviour of those taking the common meals,2 3 they may on each occasion dis­ miss them;
3 and after this, that the governor and the rest, after making libations to the gods, to whom that day or night is dedicated, may go home 4 thus in this manner.
4
By per- sons under such regulations no work that is necessary, and in every way fitting, is left undone.
But must each of them live after the manner of cattle, and grow fat ?
This, we say, is neither just nor honourable;
nor is it possible for a man, who lives in this manner, not to fail in what is fitting.
But it is fitting for an animal idle and grown fat through indolence to be almost torn to pieces by another animal amongst those greatly worn down by fortitude 1 and labours to boot.
1
If then we investigate these matters with sufficient accuracy, as we are doing now, they will perhaps never take place, as long as women, and children, and dwellings 2 remain private property, and every thing else is made such by each of us.
2
But those things, which have just now been mentioned as secondary to these, if they take place at all, would take place in a very moderate manner.
We say then that to those, who live thus, there is left a work, neither the least nor vilest, but the greatest of all or­ dained by a just law.
3
For while the life of him, who is eager for victory in the Pythian or Olympian games, supplies a want of leisure for all other business,3 that life is filled with a double, or more than a double want of leisure, 4 which has chosen most correctly the care of the body and soul alto­ gether relating to virtue,4 for there ought to be nothing in the shape of a by-work as an impediment to the other works suited to the body, as regards the emolument5 from labours and bringing up, nor in the case of the soul, from education and habits.
Indeed the whole of the night and day is scarcely sufficient for a person, who is doing this very thing, to extract from them what is perfect, 1 or even something sufficient.
1
Since then such is naturally the case, there ought to be to all free-men an order in the employment of all time, beginning almost 2from the morning until the other, ever continually both morning and sunrise.
2
A lawgiver would indeed appear to be ill-conditioned, who speaks of many and frequent and trifling matters relating to the management of an household, 3 and the other things and whatever about sleeplessness3 it is becoming for those, who are about to watch completely over the state carefully.
For that any citizen whatever should pass the whole of any night whatever in sleep, and not be seen by all his domestics, as being awake and getting up the first, this ought to be considered by all a disgraceful act, and not that of a free-man, whether it is meet to call it a law or a fashion.
So too for a mistress to be called up by any servants, and not for herself to first call up them, it is meet for the male and female slaves and house-lad to speak of amongst them­ selves, and, if it were possible, the whole household together, as a disgraceful thing.
It is meet then for all to get up by night, and to perform their many parts in the business of the state and household;
the rulers, as regards the city, and the mistresses and masters in their own families.
For much sleep is not naturally suited to our bodies or souls, or to the actions relating to them.
For he, who is asleep, is not of any more worth at all than he, who is not alive.
But whoever amongst us is careful to live (well), 1 and to be the most wise, keeps awake for the greatest part of his time, reserving only what is neces­ sary for his health.
But 2 it is not much going well to a habit.
2
Now magistrates, who are awake by night in states, are a terror to evil-doers, whether enemies or citizens, but are admired and honoured by the just and the wise, and a benefit both to themselves and to the whole state.[14.]
The night, when passed through in this manner, sup­ plies, in addition to all the above-mentioned (advantages), a certain fortitude to the souls of each of those who are in the state.
But on the return of day and the early dawn, it is re­ quisite for the boys to turn their steps to their teachers.
For neither sheep nor any thing else ought to live without a shep­ herd, nor boys without some boy-leaders, nor slaves without masters.
Now a boy is of all wild beasts the most difficult to manage.
For by how much the more he has the fountain of prudence not yet fitted up,3 he becomes crafty and keen, and the most insolent of wild beasts.
On this account it is necessary to bind him, as it were, with many chains;
4 first by boy-leaders, as soon as he is freed from his nurse and mo­ ther, 1 on account of his childishness and infantine state;
1 and still again by those who teach him 2 any thing whatever, and by instructions2 as a free-born youth;
but as being a slave, let it be lawful for any free-born man to punish the child, boy-instructor, and master, whenever any one of these commits any sin.
But if any one, who happens to be present, does not punish the offenders according to justice, let him in the first place be subject to the greatest reproach ;
and let that one of the guardians of the law, who has been chosen to preside over the boys, look to the party who was present at the deeds of which we have spoken, and did not chastise (the offenders) when it was fit to chastise them, or did not chastise them in a proper manner;
and looking with a keen eye, and pre-emi­ nently regarding the bringing up of the boys, let him regulate their dispositions, by ever turning them to what is good ac­ cording to the laws.
But how shall our law itself sufficiently instruct that very person ?
For this it has not at present stated at all in a clear and sufficient manner, but only in some things, and some not.
It is however necessary, to the utmost of our power to leave nothing for him ( to do) ;
but to explain the whole reason, in order that he may be to others both an interpreter and a bringer up.
Now something has been already said about a 3choir, and melodies, and dancing,3 and possessing what type they are to be selected, and corrected, and made holy.
But as regards what is written out of metre, we have not stated of what kind and in what manner it is meet for the boys brought up under thee, thou best guardian of the boys, to handle them.
And yet you understand by our discourse what subjects re­ lating to war it is meet for them to learn and to practise;
but what relates to letters first and secondly Ito the lyre, and about calculations, of which we said there is a need, and what­ ever it is requisite for each to learn relating to war, and house- regulation ;
and the administration, as respects the state, and relating to the very same things still useful of those in the re­ volutions of divine things, and respecting the stars, and sun, and moon, whatever it is necessary to regulate about these things in every state.
But of what things am I speaking ?
Of the order of days according to the revolutions of months, and of months according to each year, in order that seasons, and sacrifices, and festivals, receiving each what is suited to them, by being celebrated according to nature, may render the city alive and awake, and pay to the gods the honours due, and cause men to be more intelligent respecting them1—all these matters, my friend, have been thus 2 sufficiently discussed for you by the legislator.
Direct therefore your mind to what is about to be said after this.
Now we have said that you do not sufficiently understand what is the first thing respecting letters,3 while we were finding some fault with the con­ versation on this point, that it has not been as yet clearly stated to you, whether he, who is about to become a moderate citizen, should betake himself to an accuracy in learning, or not betake himself at all.
And so too in the case of the lyre.
4
We say then that he ought to betake himself.
4
For learning to read and write three years would do for a boy ten years old.
But to those, who are thirteen, three years for handling the lyre would be a moderate time.
Nor let it be lawful for 1 a father (to permit), or his son of his own act 1 to make his application to these studies more or less, and for more or less years than these 2 whether desirous to learn or hating it.
2
And let him, who disobeys (the law), be deprived of those youthful honours, which are to be mentioned shortly after­ wards.
But hear this first, what the youths ought to learn during this period, and what the masters to teach.
They ought to labour at letters until they are able to write and read.
But let us leave those unregarded, whom nature has not urged on to become, 3with respect to quickness and beauty,3 proficients within the years enjoined.
But in the case of the lyreless learn­ ing4 of poets preserved in writings, some in metre, and others without metrical5 divisions, 6 which are called merely composi­ tions in prose 6 destitute of rhythm and harmony, there have been left to us unsafe writings 7 by some such men, the majority7 of which, ye best of all guardians of the laws, how will ye make any use ?
Or how would a lawgiver, ordering you to use them, correctly order ?
I expect he would be much at a loss.
Clin. 1
What is this, guest, which you seem to say, as re­ gards yourself, as being in reality at a loss.
1Athen.
You have taken me up correctly, Clinias.
But be­ fore you, who are associates with me on the subject of laws, it is necessary for me to state 2 what seems to be an easy mat­ ter, and what does not.
2CUn.
What then, do you now say, 3 and what has been your state,3 with respect to these matters ?
Athen.
I will tell you.
For it is by no means easy to speak what is opposed to many myriads of mouths.
Clin.
But what, does it (not) 4 seem to you that the few and trifling matters, previously mentioned by us relating to laws, are somewhat opposed to the multitude ?
Athen.
You have spoken this with the greatest truth.
5 For, as it seems to me, you are exhorting me to proceed con­ fidently in this road, although it is arduous and odious to many, and to advance through the path of laws, which our present discourse has laid open, without omitting any parti­ cular, when perhaps a journey of this kind will be pleasing to others not fewer in number, and, if fewer, not worse.5[15.]
Athen.
I am not then remiss.
I assert indeed, that there are very many writers of poetry amongst us, in hexameters and trimeters, 1 and all the so-called measures, 1 some having aimed at seriousness, others at fun ;
in whose writings very many myriads assert that we ought to bring up such of the youths as are properly instructed, and to render them full even to satiety, by making them to be frequent hearers at the read­ ing of them, and very learned in them, through having got whole poets by heart.
But others say that, selecting the heads from all, and bringing to the same point entire sentences, they ought to learn them well2 by committing them to memory, if any one among us is about to be a good man and wise through much experience and much learning.
Do you, then, exhort me with a freedom of speech to show to them what they say correctly or not ?
A then.
By saying what then upon all these points shall I in one word say what is sufficient ?
I think it nearly some­ thing of this kind, in which every one would agree with me, that each of those3 (the poets) have said many things beau­ tifully, and many the reverse.
And if this be the case, I assert, that much learning is bringing danger to youth.
4Clin.
How then, and what would you advise the guardian of the law to do ?
Athen.
Of what are you speaking?
Clin.
By looking to the pattern of what thing would he permit all the youths to learn one subject and forbid them an­ other ?
Speak, and do not shrink from speaking.
Athen.
My good Clinias, I seem almost in a certain man­ ner to have been fortunate.
Clin.
About what?
Athen.
In not being entirely in want of a pattern.
For now, after looking to the discourse, which we have gone through, from the morning up to the present moment, not without the inspiration of some god, as we appear to myself, 1 I fancy, by Zeus, that something has been said by a person in his senses1 altogether similar to a kind of poetry.
Nor has perhaps any lerful event fallen upon me, in being delighted with looking
In our own discourse, as being collected together.
2
For of the very many discourses in poems, or spoken thus in prose, which I have learnt and heard, they have appeared to me to be the most moderate of all, and the most fit for youths to hear.
Hence I conceive I could not have to mention to a guardian of the laws and an instructor a pattern better than this, or to ex­ hort the masters to teach boys these subjects, and what are next and similar to these, whether a person happens to be go­ ing through the compositions of poets, or what has been writ­ ten in prose, or spoken thus nakedly, without being written, as being the brothers of these discourses, so as not to neglect them in any way, but to write them down ;
and in the first place to compel the teachers themselves to learn and praise them ;
3 and not to employ as co-workers the teachers, to whom they are not acceptable;
but that such as a person may find giving their votes for praise, let him make use of these, and hand over to them the youths to teach and to instruct.
Here then and thus let my tale be brought to an end, after having been told as regards the teachers of letters and letters likewise.
3Clin. 4
As regards the argument,4 stranger, we do not ap- pear to myself at least to have wandered from the subject pro­ posed.
But whether we are right upon the whole or not, it is perhaps difficult to assert positively.
Athen.
But this, Clinias, will then become more clear, as is reasonable, when, as we have often said, we arrive at the end of this digression respecting the laws.
Clin. True.[16.]
Athen.
After the grammar-master is not the harp­ master to be spoken of?
Athen.
I fancy that, if we recollect our previous discourse, we assigned to the harp-masters what was suited to the teach­ ing and the whole of education in things of such a kind.
Clin.
Of what kind of things are you speaking ?
Athen.
We said, I think, that the Dionysiacal singers of sixty years of age1 ought to have pre-eminently a fine per­ ception of rhythms, and the compositions of harmonies, in order that 2 (some one, through knowing well) the imitation by melodies, when it is well or ill done, at what time an affection how violent soever may happen to the soul,2 may thus,3 by be­ ing able to select the resemblances of the good (soul) and those of the contrary one, reject the latter, but bring forward the former, and 4 hymn to and enchant the souls of the young, 4 and invite each of them, while following him on account of the imitations, to be led on5 to the possession of virtue.
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
For the sake then of these matters, it is requisite for both the harper and his pupil to use the sounds of the lyre, I for the sake of the clearness of the chords, by bringing out sounds in accordance with sounds.
1 But (as regards) the dif­ ference and variety of the sounds of the lyre-the chords pro­ ducing some melodies, and the poet who composes the strain others — and moreover 2 others by their making the thick 3 and the thin, the swift and the slow, the sharp and the flat, agree with or opposed to each other respectively, and by adapting similarly all the varieties of rhythms to the sounds of the lyre, it is not lawful 4 to bring all such things as these before those, who are about to extract quickly in three years what is useful in music.
For contraries, confusing each other, produce a difficulty in learning.
But it is requisite that the young should be as quick as possible to learn.
For the subjects of education enjoined upon them are of necessity not trifling or few.
However, our discourse, as it proceeds, will, together with time, point them out.
To such matters relating to music, let the teacher thus attend.
But the melodies and words, of what kind and what it is meet for the choir-masters to teach, have been all previously discussed;
and we have said that, by being consecrated and adapted each to festivals, they ought to be of service to the state, by contributing to a pleasure of a happy kind.
5Clin.
And this too have Gyou discussed with truth.
Athen.
Most truly indeed.
6
And let him, who is chosen the ruler as regards music, receive these rules from us, and let him attend to them with a kind fortune.
1
But let us deliver them relating to dancing and the whole of the gymnastics pertaining to the body, in addition to what has been stated previously;
(and) as we have delivered the instruction, that remained re­ specting music, let us act in a similar manner with regard to gymnastics.
For it is meet for boys and girls to learn to dance and to practise gymnastics likewise.
1
Is it not ?
Clin.
Certainly.
Athen.
Now for the boys dancing-masters, but for the girls dancing-mistresses, would be the better fitted2 for going through the occupation.
Clin.
Be it so.
Athen.
Again, let us call the man, who has the most to do, the curator of youth;
and who, since he attends to the sub­ jects relating to music and gymnastics, will not have much leisure.
Clin.
How then is it possible for a person, advanced in years, to attend to so many things ?
Athen.
Easily, my friend.
For the law has allowed and will allow him to take to himself as his associates3 in such an employment, whomever of the male and female citizens he pleases ;
and he will know whom he ought (to take);
and he will be desirous 4not to do wrong in these matters4 while 5 prudently knowing and reverencing the importance of his office, and5 being conversant with the reasoning6 that, when youths have been and are properly brought up, every thing will sail on prosperously 1 (over the sea of life) ;
1 but if not,2 it is not fit to state, nor do we state (what will follow) 3 through our vener­ ating the great lovers of prophets in a new city.4[17.]
Much then has been said by us on the subjects re­ lating to dancing and all the movements of gymnastics.
For under gymnastics we place all the exercises relating to war in archery and every kind of hurling, and the use of the small shield, and all the fighting with the large shield, and the tac­ tics of sallying out, and all the marching of armies, and their conduct in camps, and whatever relates to cavalry regulations.
For all these subjects there ought to be teachers in common, obtaining their pay from the state, and having both men and boys as their pupils, and girls and women skilled in all these matters-those who are still virgins practising every kind of dancing, and fighting in armour, but the women laying hold of the science of sallying out,5 and of laying down and taking up arms, if for nothing else,6 at least for this, that should there be a necessity at any time for those, who had been guarding7 the children and the rest of the city, to leave the town with their whole force,8 and to march to a distance from it, the women may be sufficient for so much 9 as this.
Or, on the contrary, (should it happen,) 1 2 what is not at all denied to be possible,2 that enemies from without fall upon it with some mighty power and force, whether Greeks or Barbarians, and furnish the necessity for a battle to take place for the state itself, it would surely be a great fault in a polity for the women to have been brought up in so shameful a manner, as not to fight, as even birds do in behalf of their offspring with the strongest of wild animals,3 nor to be willing to die, and to expose themselves to every dan­ ger;
but straightway to hurry 4 to sacred places, and to fill all the altars and temples, and to bring down upon the race of women the bad repute5 of being the most cowardly of all animals.
Clin. 6 By Zeus, 0 guest, this would be by no means seemly, independent of the cowardice, in any state, where it might take place.
6Athen.
Let us then lay down the law so far as this at least, that warlike concerns ought not to be neglected by women, but that all the citizens, both male and female, ought to attend to them.
Clin.
I agree with you.
Athen.
With respect to wrestling, then, we have said some­ thing ;
but that which is, as I should say, the greatest thing, we have not spoken of;
nor is it easy to speak of it, without pointing it out with the body, as well as by word of mouth.
This then we will determine, when our language, following out acts, shall indicate something clear about the other points of which we have spoken ;
and that such a wrestling is in reality of all motions allied the nearest to a personal encoun­ ter in battle;
and, moreover, that it is requisite to attend to this for the sake of that, but not that for the sake of this.
Clin.
Beautifully indeed do you say this.[18.]
Athen.
Let then thus much be held to have been said up to the present moment on the subject of wrestling.
But with respect to the other motions of the whole body, the greatest part of which a person would, by calling it a certain dancing, call it correctly, it is proper to consider as of two kinds;
one imitating the solemn in the more beautiful bodies, but the other the depraved in baser bodies.
And again, of the de­ praved there are two species, and two of the serious.
Of the serious motion one kind exists, when bodies of beauty and a soul of bravery become implicated in war and violent exer­ tions :
but the other, when a temperate soul (being mixed up) with a prosperous state and moderate pleasures.
Now he who calls a dancing of this kind pacific, calls it according to its nature.
I But the warlike, on the other hand,1 which is entirely different from the pacific, a person would correctly call Pyrrhic;
which imitates the careful guarding against all blows and hurlings by leanings away,2 and by every kind of yielding and leapings on high, together with a lowering of the body;
and the contrary to these, which are borne along to active gestures in the shooting of arrows, and the hurling of javelins, and which attempt to imitate the infliction 3 of all kinds of blows.
4
But that which is erect and braced up in these, when an imitation takes place of good bodies and souls, becom­ ing straightforward for the most part of the limbs of the body, receiving a thing of this kind as right, but the contrary as not right.
4
In this way, on the other hand, we must look upon the pacific dancing of each,1 whether a person lays hold or not of the beautiful dancing, and conducts himself in a be­ coming manner in the dances of men, acting according to law.
It is necessary, then, to separate first the dancing about which there is a doubt from that about which there is not a doubt.
Now what is this ?
And how must we separate them ?
Such then as is Bacchic, and belongs to those that follow the Bacchants, whom some persons, 2calling by the name of Nymphs, Pans, Silenuses, and Satyrs, say that they imitate, and,2 drunk with wine, perform3 purifications and certain mystic rites, the whole of this kind of dancing it is not easy to define, as being neither pacific, nor adapted to war, or (to say) what it means.
But it seems to me that it is nearly the most correct to define it in this way, by placing the warlike dancing apart, and apart too the pacific, and to assert that this kind of dancing is not adapted to a civil4 life.
Leaving it, therefore, to lie down lying there,5 let us return to the warlike and pacific dancing, as being indubitably ours.
Now the kind of the unwarlike Muse, and that which honours6 the gods and the sons of the gods by dancing, 7 will become altogether one kind,7 when it takes place in the reputation8 of doing well.
And we could make of this a twofold division ;
the one, possessing greater pleasures, after we have escaped from certain labours there1 and dangers to what is good;
but the other, when there is a preservation and increase of former good things, possessing pleasures milder than them;
2 since in matters of this kind, every one is affected with greater movements in the body, when the pleasures are greater, but with less, when they are less;
and he, who is more orderly, and more exercised in fortitude, exhibits less changes of movement;
but he, who is timid, and unexercised in temperance, the more vehement;
and generally every one, who emits a sound, whether in singing or in speak­ ing, is not entirely able to exhibit tranquillity in his body.
Hence an imitation of what has been said, taking place by gestures has produced the whole of the art of dancing.
In all these occasions, one, person amongst us moves elegantly, but another inelegantly.
Now it is fitting for him, who re­ fleets, to praise many others of the old names, as being as­ signed correctly, and according to nature ;
and to one of them, relating to the dancings 3 of those who are doing well, and are moderate in their pleasures,3 how correctly and at the same time musically did he, whoever he was, give a name.
For 4 assigning to them taken all together a name according to rea­ son, he called it Emmeleia,l and established two kinds of beautiful dancings, one warlike, called Pyrrhic, the other pa­ cific, called Emmeleia, assigning to each a becoming and fitting appellation.
These matters it behoves the lawgiver to explain by types, but the guardian'of the laws to seek out;
and having sought out, to combine dancing with the rest of music, and to distribute at all festivals that which is suited to each of the sacrifices;
and having thus made them all holy in their order, hereafter to disturb nothing connected with dancing or singing.
2
For it is requisite that the same city and the same citizens should pass their time as far as possible equally in the same pleasures,2 and live really3 well and happily.[19.]
The matters then relating to the dancings of beauti­ ful bodies and souls, of what kind it has been said they ought to be, have been gone through.
But it is necessary to look into and know those relating to disagreeable bodies and thoughts, and of those that are directed to the comicalities of laughter, as regards the language, and the song, and the dance, and the imitations of all these, done in a comical way.
For it is not possible to learn serious things without the laughable, nor the converse of any thing without its contrary, if a per­ son is about to be intellectual;
but to do both it would be not possible, if a person is on the other hand about to have even a little share of virtue.
But it is meet to learn them for the sake 4 of this very thing,4 namely, the not doing or saying at any time through ignorance what is ridiculous, when there is no need of it;
but (it is proper) 1 to order slaves and hired strangers to imitate things of this kind;
but for no serious study of them to exist at any time, or for any free person, either woman or man, to be seen learning them, 2 but for some novelty of imitations about them to always appear.
2
Thus then let whatever are the sports pertaining to laughter, which we all call comedy, be laid down both by our language and law.
But should any of the serious poets, who, they say, are occu­ pied on tragedies, come to us and ask-Shall we, 0 strangers, come to your city and country, or not, and bring our poetry and act3 it ?
or how is it decreed for you to do in matters of this kind ?
what answer to this should we correctly give to these divine men ?
This to myself indeed it seems good to say-O most excellent of strangers, we are ourselves, to the utmost of our power, poets of a tragedy the most beautiful and best.
For the whole of our polity consists in an imitation of a life the most beautiful and best, which we say is in reality the truest tragedy.
You, therefore, are poets, and we too are poets of the same kind, being your opponents in art, and antagonists in the most beautiful drama, which true law alone has naturally completed,4 as is the hope in us.
But do not think that we shall so easily suffer you to fix your scenes in our place of meeting, and, introducing players with beautiful voices, and who talk louder than we do, to speak in public be­ fore our children and wives and all the masses not the same things as we do about pursuits, but for the most part even the most contrary.
For we should be ourselves nearly quite mad, and the whole state too, should it permit you to do what has been just now mentioned, before the magistrates shall have decided whether you have composed what is to be spoken and fit to be brought forward or not.
Now then, ye children,1 offspring of the tender Muses, we will, after first showing your odes2 by the side of ours to the rulers grant you a Chorus;
if what has been said by you shall appear to be the same as, or better than3 that by us, but if not, we shall never, friends, be able to do so.
Let then these be the customs, ordained by laws, relating to all kind of dancing and the teaching of them, that separate are the affairs of slaves, and separate those of masters, if so it seems good to you.
Clin.
How does not this seem good, at least for the present ?[20.]
A then.
Three things however still remain for the free-born to learn;
one is computation, and what relates to numbers;
but that, which measures length, breadth, and depth, is a second one;
4 and the third that, which (measures) the orbits of the stars, (and) how they naturally march with re- lation to each other.
On all these it is not requisite for the many to labour to a nicety, but only some few;
of whom, as we advance, we will speak towards the end (of our discussion).
lFor so it will be becoming.
1
But such as are necessary for the masses, it has been very correctly said even by boys,2 that it is shameful for the many not to know.
However it is neither easy nor altogether possible to search into all things accu­ rately ;
but whatever is necessary among them, it is not pos­ sible to throw aside.
And it seems that he,3 who first spoke proverbially of the deity, that not even a god will ever at any time be seen contending against necessity, (said so) looking to this, namely, such necessities 4as, I conceive, are at least5 di­ vine ;
since, (if he said so) of human necessities, to which the multitude look when, speaking in this manner, it would be the most stupid by far of all their speeches.
Clin.
What then are those necessities for instruction, 0 guest, which are not such, but divine ?
Athen.
I think they are those, which be, who does not practise, nor in any respect learn, will never become either a god, a daemon, or a hero among men, competent 6 to undertake the care seriously of mankind.
And he would want much of being a divine man, who is unable to tell either one, or two, or three, or, in short, even and odd, or in any respect to know how to number, or to reckon nights and days, and is un­ skilled in the revolutions of the moon, the sun, and the other stars.
There is then much folly in the notion that all this education is not necessary for him, who is about to know the most beautiful subjects of instruction.
But of what kind is each of these, and how many they are, and when they are to be learnt, and what with some, and what apart from others, and the whole combination of them, these are the subjects, which a person ought to learn the first;
and, with this instruc­ tion as the guide, to go on to the rest.
For thus a necessity has overtaken him naturally, with which we say no divinity contests at present, or ever will contest.
Clin.
What has been asserted at present, 0 guest, seems to have been somehow truly asserted, and you speak according to nature.
Athen.
Such is the case, Clinias.
But it is difficult for a person, who has previously arranged thus for himself, to lay down laws in this manner.
But if it seems good to you, we will lay down laws for ourselves in a more accurate manner at some other time.
Clin.
You seem to is, guest, to fear our habit of ignorance on matters of this kind.
You do not, however, justly fear.
Endeavour then to speak, concealing nothing on this account.
Athen.
I fear the very things you are now speaking of;
but I fear much more those, who have indeed laid hold of these points of education, but have laid hold of them improperly.
For an ignorance of all things is by no means a dreadful thing nor slippery,1 nor yet the greatest evil;
but much skill and great learning united to an improper education, is a calamity much greater than these.
2Clin.
You speak the truth.[21.]
Athen.
It is necessary then to say that the free-born ought to learn of each of these subjects so much as the great mass of boys in Ægypt learn together with their letters.
For, in the first place, the rules relating to reckoning have been so artlessly devised for children, that they learn it in sport, and with pleasure ;
(for there are)3 distributions of certain apples and chaplets, the 1 the same numbers being adapted to more and at the same time to fewer :
1 and in the case of pugilists and wrestlers, 2the assessorships and co-allot­ ments 2 3in turn and in successive order,3 and 4 how they exist naturally;
4 and, moreover, when playing, 5 they mix phials of gold, and copper, and silver, and other things of this kind, and some distribute them whole,5 adapting, as I said before, to their sports the use of necessary numbers;
and thus they benefit those, who are learning to draw up and lead out armies, and to arrange encampments,6 and to regulate a household, and cause in short the men to be more useful themselves to themselves, and awake;
and after this in the case of measurements, relating to length, breadth, and depth, (since they say)' that there is naturally inherent in all men a certain ridiculous and disgraceful ignorance on all these points, they liberate them from this.
Clin.
What and what kind of ignorance do you mean ?
Athen.
My dear Clinias, I too, having altogether late in life heard how we are affected on these points, have felt a wonder;
and it seems to me, that it is the situation not of human beings, but rather of certain swine-like animals;
and I have been ashamed not only of myself, but of all the Greeks.
Clin.
About what ?
Tell us, guest, what you mean.
Athen.
I will tell you;
or, rather, I will point it out to you by asking a question.
And do you give me a short answer.
You surely know what length is ?
Athen.
And what breadth is ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
And that there are these two things, and that a third of these 2 is depth ?
Athen.
Does it not, then, seem to you, that all these may be measured by each other ?
A then.
I mean length by length, and breadth by breadth ;
and that depth is naturally capable of being measured simi­ larly ?
Clin.
Very much so.
A then.
But, if some of these can do this neither 3 violently nor quietly,3 but some can, and others not,4 and yet you ima­ gine that all (can), how do you conceive yourself to be situated with respect to these ?
Clin.
Badly, it is evident.
Athen.
But again, as regards length and breadth against depth, or length and breadth against each other, do not all of us the Greeks think, touching these questions, thus, that they can be measured against each other in some way ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
But if this be at no time and by no means possible, and yet all the Greeks, as I have said, think it is possible, is it not fit, that, being ashamed of them all, we should thus address them, — O ye best of Greeks, this is one of the things, which we said it was base not to know.
But is it not altogether beautiful to know things necessary (to be known) ?
Athen.
And in addition to these, there are other things allied to them, in which many errors, the sisters of those [errors],1 are produced in us.
Clin.
What are these ?
Athen.
Those relating to quantities that are commensurable and not commensurable, by what nature they exist.
For it is necessary that he, who reflects upon them, should distinguish them, or be altogether a person of no mark ;
and it is meet 2 by throwing out problems to each other, and, being engaged in an amusement more agreeable than the pebble-game 3 of old men, to have a love for contention in a pursuit worthy of all attention.
4Clin.
Perhaps so.
At least it seems that the pebble-game and this education are very5 different from each other.
Athen.
These subjects then I assert, Clinias,, the youths ought to learn.
For they are neither hurtful nor difficult;
and when they are learnt, combined with sport, they will do a be­ nefit, but never a hurt, to our state.
But, if any one says otherwise, let us hear him.
Atlien.
If then these things appear to be so, it is evident that we shall decide in their favour;
but appearing to be not so, they will be decided against.
CUn.
Evidently so.
How not?
Athen.
Let then these be laid down as belonging to neces­ sary instructions, in order that what relates to the laws may not be (done) by us in vain.
Athen.
2 (For they are) as it were pledges from the rest of the polity, which may be dissolved,2 if they should in no re­ spect receive kindly3 us, who propose them, or you, who establish them.
Clin.
The condition you propose is just.[22.]
Athen.
After these then look to the instruction re­ lating to the stars, whether this being chosen for youth pleases us, or the contrary.
CUn.
Only speak.
Athen.
And yet there is respecting them a subject of great marvel, and to be endured at no time and by no means.
Clin.
What is this ?
Athen.
We say that we ought not to search after the great­ est god,4 and the whole order of the world, nor to be busy in explaining the causes (of things);
for it is not holy.
It seems indeed, that, if the very contrary took place, it would take place correctly.
Clin.
How say you?
Athen.
What is stated is a paradox, and some one may think it is not suited to old men ;
but when any one conceives that instruction is something beautiful, and true, and advan­ tageous to a city, and likewise in every respect acceptable to the deity, by no manner of means is it possible not to mention it.
Clin.
You say what is reasonable.
But shall we find an instruction of this kind in the case of the stars ?
Athen.
All we Greeks, so to say, tell, 0 ye good men, a false­ hood respecting those mighty divinities the Sun and Moon.
Clin.
Of what kind is the falsehood ?
A then.
We say that they never proceed in the same path, and that there are some other stars with them, to which we give the name of planets.
Clin.
By Zeus, you are saying, guest, the truth.
For in the course of my life, I have often seen myself the morning and the evening star, and certain other stars, never proceeding along in the same track, but wandering entirely.
And we all know that the Sun and Moon 'are perpetually doing so.'Athen.
These then are the things, Megillus and Clinias, which I assert our citizens and youths ought to learn respect­ ing the gods in heaven, so far as this 2about all these matters, so far2 for the sake of not blaspheming them, but of offering sacrifices ever with good-omened words, and piously in prayers approaching3 them.
Clin.
This indeed is right, if, first, it is possible to learn that, of which you are speaking ;
and next, if we are not at present speaking properly about them, yet after learning, we shall speak so of them.
Thus much do I go along with you;
and that a thing of this kind must be learnt.
Do you, then, endeavour to explain entirely that these things are so, and we will together follow you as your disciples.
Athen.
It is not easy to learn what I am saying, nor is it on the other hand altogether difficult, nor is it a matter of a very long time.
And the proof is, that, although I myself have heard these things, neither recently 1 nor formerly, I am able to render them manifest in a little time.
And yet had they been difficult, I, who am in years, would not have been able to explain them to you, who are in years.
Clin.
You say what is true.
But what is the instruction, which you call marvellous;
but which you say it is fitting for the youths to learn, and yet we are ignorant of?
Endeavour to speak about it, at least to this extent, with the utmost perspicuity.
Athen.
I must endeavour.
The notion then, thou best of men, respecting the Sun and Moon and the other stars, that they are planets, is not correct;
but the very contrary is the case.
For each of them perpetually traverses the same path, being not many, but one, in a circle;
but they appear to tra­ verse many.
And that, which is the most swift of them, is not rightly thought to be2 the slowest, and contrariwise the contrary.
Now if such is the case naturally, but we do not think so, if we had such notions respecting the horses, that run at Olympia, or of men contesting in the long course, and we called the swiftest the slowest, and the slowest the swiftest, and, passing our encomiums, celebrated the vanquished as the victor, I think we should not attach our praises properly, nor in a manner agreeable to the racers, 3being men.3
But now, when we err in the very same manner respecting the gods, do we not think that, what,4 when it took place there, would be then ridiculous and incorrect, takes place here at present (not well) in the case of the gods.
Clin. Ridiculous, I am aware, entirely.
5Athen.
It is not then an act acceptable to the divinity, when we hymn to the gods what is false.
CUn.
Most true ;
if such is the case.
Athen.
If then we can show that such is the case, all these subjects are up to this point to be learnt;
but, if we cannot show it, we must dismiss them ;
and let this be thus laid down.
Clin.
By all means.[23.]
Athen.
It is then proper to say now, that the legal in­ stitutions relating to the instruction of childhood, have reached their end.
And it is requisite to reflect in a similar manner upon hunting and every thing else of this kind.
1
For it ap­ pears that the office of a lawgiver is not merely that of laying down laws ;
but that he ought to make use of what is a mean between admonition and laws;
1 an idea that has often oc­ curred to us during our discussion ;
for instance, (when we were speaking) about the bringing up of the very young.
For we said there were things not to be mentioned;
and that, speaking of them as laws laid down, we thought the notion2 to be full3 of folly;
but laws having been written in this way, and the whole of a polity (laid down),4 the praise of a citizen pre-eminent in virtue is not then perfect, when any one says that he, who ministers the best to the laws, and obeys them the most, is the good man;
but this would be said more perfectly, that he is so, who leads a life with­ out stain,5 through being obedient to the writings of the party, who lays down the laws and distributes praise and blame.
This is the most correct language for the praise of a citizen ;
and the legislator in reality ought not only to write down his laws, but in addition to the laws to write down, interwoven with them,1 what seems to him to be beautiful and not beautiful;
and the tip-top citizen should establish firmly these no less than what are bound down by fines imposed by the law.
And we adduce as a witness the subject of our present discussion ;
for it will show more clearly what we mean.
For hunting is a thing of wide extent, comprehended at present under nearly one name.
For there is much hunting of aquatic animals ;
much of those that fly ;
and still more of those on land, not only of wild beasts, but that which 2 it is fit to consider as the hunting of men, I mean3 in war, and much too is the hunting in the way of friendship, of which one part brings praise, the other blame.
The thefts too of robbers and armies are huntings.
The legislator, therefore, who establishes laws about hunting, can neither leave these unnoticed, nor, by imposing regulations and fines on all, lay down laws of a men­ acing kind.
What then is to be done in cases of this kind ?
4
On the one hand, the legislator ought to praise and blame the business of hunting,4 relating to the labours and pursuits of youth ;
and on the other hand, the young man ought to hear and obey, and neither pleasure nor labour ought to prevent him (from doing so) ;
but let him honour what is mentioned with praise, rather than what has been laid down by law, and are accompanied with threats, united to fines relating to each, -land perform what is enjoined.
5
This being premised, the praise and blame of hunting will follow in a becoming manner.
For that, which makes the souls of young men better, belongs to the person praising, but to the party blaming that, which (effects) the contrary.
Let us then speak of what follows in order, addressing the young men by a prayer—O friends, never may any desire or love of fishing by sea, or of fishing with a hook, seize you;
nor, generally, of labouring to catch any aquatic animals with an osier net,1 either when you are awake or asleep !
2 May no desire ever come upon you to catch men at sea, nor to rob them, which would make you cruel and lawless hunters!
And never may it come into your farthest thoughts3 to commit thefts in the country and city ;
nor let a desire, full of cleverness, but not a very liberal one,4 come upon any young person to catch birds.
The hunting then and catch­ ing of land animals alone remains for our athletes;
of which, one kind, performed by those sleeping 5 ever 6 in turn, and called noc­ turnal, belongs to sluggish men, and is not worthy of praise ;
nor yet the other(of thoseawake),7 which, enjoying a remission from labour, does by nets and snares, and not by the victory of a soul fond of labour, get the savage strength of wild beasts into its power.
That hunting then of quadrupeds alone remains as the best of all, performed with horses and dogs, and by the bodies of the parties themselves ;
over all of which animals they get the mastery by running them down, and inflicting blows, and hurling darts, the parties themselves, to whom there is any care of possessing a godlike bravery, being engaged with their own hands in the hunt.
Of all these matters then in the shape of praise or blame, let this discourse have been spoken;
and and let this be the law.
Let no one hinder these truly sacred hunters from hunting, wherever they please.
But no one shall ever suffer any person at any place to engage in noc­ turnal hunting with dogs8 and ropes.
And let him not prevent fowling in uncultivated places and in mountains;
but any one who may be present shall forbid it in cultivated and 1 sacred holy1 places, and a person catching fish, except in ports or sacred rivers, and marshes or pools;
but in other places let it be lawful for him to catch them, provided he does not use a mixture of juices.

Now, therefore, it is proper to say, that the legal institutions respecting education have arrived at their end.
Clin.
You may well say so.[1.]
CLOSE upon these it is for us to regulate and lay down by law, in conjunction with the Delphic oracles, festivals, (and)3 what (are to be) the sacrifices and the divinities,4 to whom it will be better and more advisable for the state to sacri­ fice, and at what time, and how many in number.
Of these mat­ ters,5 I think6 it will be perhaps nearly our business to by down some by law.
Clin.
Perhaps so, as regards the number.
A then.
Let us then speak first as regards the number.
7
For let there be7 of three hundred and sixty-five 8nothing want­ ing ;
8 so that some one9 of the magistrates may always sacri- fice to some god or daemon in behalf of the city, and the peo­ ple,' and their property.
And let the (holy) interpreters, and the priests, and the priestesses, and the prophets, being assembled together, with the guardians of the laws, ordain what it was necessary for the legislator to omit.
2
For it is requisite that'these should take notice of things omitted.
2
For the law will say that there are twelve festivals to the twelve gods, from whom each tribe has its name, and that persons are to make to each of these monthly sacrifices, and dances, and musical contests, and to assign the gymnastic exercises, in a manner befitting both to the gods themselves, and the several seasons ;
and to distribute the female festi­ vals likewise, such as ought to be separated from the men, and such as ought not.
Moreover, the festivals of the gods below, and such as are to be called celestial, and what is attendant on these, must not be mixed together, but must be separated in the twelfth month, sacred to Pluto,3 by persons paying rites according to law :
nor must persons feel, like enemies, an ill will towards that god, but they must honour him, as being even the best to the race of men.
4
For the communion between soul and body is not better than the separation, as I affirm, speaking seriously.
4
Besides, it is re- quisite for those, who are about to distinguish these sum­ ciently, to have this notion, that this our city is such, as no one will find another like it, of those at present, as regards the leisurely employment of time, and the power over things necessary for existence.
But it ought, like a single indi­ vidual, to live well.
Now to those living well, it is neces­ sary for this to be present the first, namely, 1 that persons should neither injure others,1 nor be injured by others.
Now of these, the former is not very difficult ;
but it is very difficult to possess the power of not being injured ;
nor is it possible to perfectly acquire it otherwise than by becoming perfectly good.
2
The same tiling also takes place in a city, to which, when it is good, there is a life of peace ;
but of war from without and within, when it is wicked.
And as this is the case nearly every where,3 each must exercise themselves in war, not during a war, but during a life of peace.
It is necessary then for a city, endued with intellect, to exercise itself in war, for not less than one day in each month, but for more as it may seem fit to the rulers, without taking thought of cold or heat, both the men, and the women and the boys, 4 in order that all may be prepared,4 when it shall somehow5 seem good to the rulers to lead forth the people in a mass, 6 and sometimes in portions.
6
And it is meet1 to devise some beautiful sports, together with sacrifices, that certain festival-battles2 may take place, imi­ tating as distinctly as possible the battles in war ;
and it is meet to distribute rewards of victory and valour to each of these, and to make encomiums upon, and abuse of, each other, according as each may conduct himself in the contests, and through the whole of life, 3by decking the party, who has been thought to be the best, and dispraising him, who has not.
3
But, in the first place, let not every one be a poet on such sub­ jects, but let him be a person not less than fifty years of age ;
nor, in the next place, such of those, as possess poetry and music sufficiently in themselves, but have never done any honourable and conspicuous act, but such as are good men themselves and held in honour by the state, and have been the doers of honourable deeds.
(And)4 let the compositions of such persons be sung, even although they may not be naturally musical.
But let the decision on these matters be with the instructor of youth, and the other guardians of the laws ;
and let them5 assign, as an honour to them6 alone, a freedom of speech in songs;
but to the others let there not be this liberty;
nor let any one dare to sing a song, which has not been approved of by the guardians of the laws, who are to decide, not even if it be sweeter than the hymns of 7 Thamyris and Orpheus;
;
7 but such sacred poems as have, after being decided upon, been dedicated to the gods ;
and such as, being the poems of worthy men, scattering blame or praise on certain parties, have been adjudged to do a thing of this kind with moderation.[2.]
The same things, I assert, ought to take place similar­ ly, both among men and women, respecting war, and the li­ berty of speech in poetry.
But it is meet for the legislator to bring the question before himself, and to cast about it with this discourse-Come, what citizens shall I, after having nourished the whole state properly, bring up ?
Ought they not to be the combatants in the greatest contests, to whom there are ten thousand antagonists ?
Entirely so, some one speaking with propriety may say.
What then, if we had brought up boxers or combatants in boxing and wrestling united, or per­ sons contending in any other contests of this kind, should we have met1 them in the contest itself, not having ourselves fought with any one at a former time ?
Or, if we were pugil­ ists, should we not have learned to fight many days previous to the contest, and laboured hard in imitating all such things as we should be about to adopt at that period,2 when we were contending for victory ?
And should we not, with the view of coming the nearest possible to what is similar, have put on box­ ing-gloves3 instead of the cestus, in order that the blows and the avoidance of blows might be practised as sufficiently as pos­ sible ?
And should there have happened to be a deficiency of fellow-combatants, should we not, through dreading the laugh­ ter of the senseless, have dared to hang up an inanimate image,4 and practise ourselves against it ?
And if we were in want both of animate and inanimate adversaries, should we not have ventured, in some desert spot, to fight even with a shadow5 against ourselves ?
Or, for what else would any one say that this practice in moving the hand took place ?
Clin.
For nearly nothing else, 0 guest, than the very one you have just now mentioned.
Athen.
What then, will the warlike portion of the city dare on each occasion to go to the greatest of contests, worse pre­ pared than combatants of this kind, when it is about to fight for life, and for children, and property, and the whole of the state.
And will not then the "legislator, fearful lest these gymnastic exercises with each other should appear to some persons ridiculous, lay down a law, and ordain that per­ sons are to act the soldier each day in a little way without arms, and cause the dances, and the whole of gymnastic exer­ cise, to tend together to this point ?
and will he not likewise ordain that some of the gymnastic exercises for instance,1 either greater or less, 2 are to last for not less than a month ;
and that persons are to enter2 into contests with each other through the whole country in seizing upon places, and making ambuscades,3 and by imitating the whole of war in reality,4 to fight with boxing-gloves, and to make use of darts somewhat dangerous, and as near as possible to the hurling of real ones ;
in order that the sport may not be altogether without a fear from each other, but cause some terror, and thus, after a man­ ner, show who is the man of mettle, and who is not;
and by distributing correctly honours to some, and disgrace to others, he may render the whole state through its (whole) life useful for a real contest.
And moreover, should any one happen to die in these contests, that, as the death was involuntary, he may lay down that the homicide shall, after being purified according to law, be pure in hand;
reflecting that when not many men die, others will be born again not inferior;
but when fear, as it were, dies, in all these cases he will no longer be able to discover a test of the better and the worse;
which is, in no small degree, a greater evil to a state than the other.
1Clin.
We will agree with you, 0 guest, that he ought to lay down matters of this kind by law, and direct the attention of the whole state to them.[3.]
Athen.
Do we then all of us know the reason, why in cities at present no such dancing and contest exist, scarcely at any time or in any manner, except to a very small extent ?
Shall we say that this happens through the ignorance of the masses, and of those who have laid down laws for them ?
Clin.
Perhaps so.
Athen.
By no means, 0 blessed Clinias.
But it is proper to say that there are two causes of this, and very sufficient too.
Clin.
What are they ?
Athen.
One is, that, through the love of wealth making the whole of time to be without any leisure2 for the care of other things except private property, on which the soul of every citizen is hanging, it can have no care for other things but of daily pecuniary gain ;
and whatever learning or pursuit leads to this, every one individually is most ready to learn and to practise, but he laughs down all the rest.
It is proper there­ fore to mention this as one reason, why a state is unwilling to engage seriously in this or any other honourable and excellent pursuit;
but through an insatiable desire of silver and gold is willing for every man to undergo every art and artifice, both the more beautiful and the more base,3 if he is about to become wealthy, and to engage in a line of conduct holy and unholy, and thoroughly disgraceful, and to feel no annoyance, if only he possesses the power, like a wild beast,4 to eat all kinds of things, and drink likewise,' and to obtain all satiety in all forms of venereal enjoyments.
Clin. Right.
Athen.
Let this then be put down as one reason, which I assign, as preventing states from practising2 any thing else that is honourable or what relates to war sufficiently;
but by causing the naturally well-ordered to become merchants, and ship-owners, and servile ministers, and the brave to be rob­ bers, and house-breakers, and guilty of sacrilege, and fond of war, and tyrannical, it destroys, and greatly so3 sometimes, those who were well-disposed but unfortunate.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
Why should I not call those in every respect unfor­ tunate, to whom there is a necessity by feeling hungry through the whole of life and neglecting their own soul to be per­ petually engaged in a contest ?
4CUn.
This, then, is one reason.
But what do you assign, 0 guest, as the second ?
Athen.
You have very properly reminded me.
5 Clin.
This insatiable search (after wealth) 6 that makes each person to be without leisure, is, as you say, one impedi­ ment to each practising what relates to war.
Be it so.
But tell us the second.
Athen.
Do I seem to have not spoken, but to have wasted time through a want of readiness ?
CUn.
You do not.
But you seem to us to reprobate, as through hatred, a custom of this kind more than is becoming, 7 in the language which has just now fallen from you.
7Athen.
You find fault with me, guests, most correctly;
and you shall hear, as is reasonable, what is after this.
CUn.
Only speak.
Athen.
I say, then, that the not-polities, of which we have often spoken in our previous conversation, namely, a demo­ cracy, an oligarchy, and a tyranny, are the causes of this.
For in these there is not a single polity;
but all may most justly be called states of sedition.
For not one willingly rules over the willing, but willingly over the unwilling, and this always with some compulsion.
And as the governor fears the governed, he never at any time willingly permits a person to be handsome, or wealthy, or strong, or brave, or altogether warlike.
1
These two then are nearly pre-eminently the causes of all things, but of these they are really the pre-eminent.
1
But the polity for which we are now giving laws, avoids both these.
For it leads a life of the greatest leisure;
and (the people) are free from each other, and will, I think, become from these laws the lovers of money the least.
So that such an establishment of a polity would alone of all existing at present, probably and according to reason receive at the same time the instruction that has been gone through, and the warlike sport, which has been perfected correctly at least by description.
Clin. Correctly (said).[4.]
Athen.
Is it not then next in order to these for us to have a recollection of all gymnastic contests, so that we may attend to such of them as appertain to war, and lay down the rewards of victory, but to bid farewell to such, as do not apper­ tain.
But what they are, it is better for them to be detailed from the beginning, and to establish by law.
And, first, must we not lay down what appertains to running and swiftness ?
CUn.
We must lay them down.
Athen.
Now the quickness of the body is altogether of all things the most appertaining to war ;
one kind connected with the feet, and the other with the hands;
that of the feet being required for running away and overtaking, but (of the hands) 1 the fight in close conflict and the standing up together re­ quiring strength and vigour.
1Athen.
But neither of them without heavy arms possesses the greatest utility.
Clin.
For how should they?
Athen.
The crier, then, shall first invite the runner in the stadium, as he does now at the games.
And the runner will enter, having a shield;
for we do not put, down rewards for the light-armed soldier.
He, who is about to contend by running in the stadium, 2 will enter the first with his arms;
but the second, he (who is to run) the doubled course;
the third, he (who is to run) the horse course;
the fourth, more­ over, he (who is to run) the long course;
2 and the fifth, 3whom we shall start the first with his arms on,3 is to run a dis- tance of sixty stadia to a certain temple of Mars;
and again call­ ing by name (another) heavier armed to contend in a (shorter and) smoother road ;
and again, another who is an archer, and having all the dress of an archer, (to run) a hundred stadia while engaged in the contest, through mountains and all kinds of country, to a temple of Apollo and Artemis ;
and after estab­ lishing the contest, we will wait for them, until they arrive, and we will then bestow upon each victor the prize.
Clin. Right.
Athen.
Let us then consider these contests as of three kinds;
one of boys, another of beardless youths, and a third of men.
And for the beardless youths we will lay down two thirds of the whole course;
but for boys the halves of these, 2when contending with archers and armed men.
2
With respect to females, for girls not yet arrived at puberty and un­ dressed,3 (we will establish) the stadium, and diaulum, 4 and horse-course, and the long course,4 for them to contend5 in the course itself, 6 but to those, who are thirteen years of age, the communion remaining until marriage, for a period not longer than twenty years, nor less than eighteen.
6
And clothed with a fitting dress let them descend to the contest in these courses.
And thus much concerning the contests of men and women in running.
With regard to trials of strength, in the place of wrestling, and such things, we will establish what are now considered heavy contests, namely, the fighting in heavy armour, by one contending with one, and two with two, and up to ten with ten.
But what and to what extent it is re­ quisite for a person not to suffer, or to do, to gain the victory, just as recently in the case of wrestling, the parties conN versant with that exercise have laid down laws, relating to what is the work of a person wrestling well, or not;
so it is requisite to invite parties skilled in fighting with arms, and to request them to lay down laws, as to who is justly the victor in contests of this kind, and what regulation shall determine likewise the defeated party.
And let the same laws be laid down respecting the females up to the time of marriage.
And it is requisite for us to oppose to the contest in boxing and wrestling united the whole of the art of the light-shield soldier, where parties contend with bows, and light shields, and short spears, and in the hurling of stones from the hand and from slings ;
and to lay down laws on these matters, (and)1 to distribute legal honours 2 and victories2 to the party conducting himself the best on these points.
After this it would be in the order of events for laws to be laid down respecting equestrian contests.
There is not, indeed, much need of horses, nor many of them, at least in Crete;
so that of necessity there is less attention given to the rearing of horses, and the contests with them.
For not one of you4 is in any respect 5the rearer of a chariot,5 and there would be no ambition founded on reason to any one on this point:
6so that for us to establish competitors in a pursuit, which does not belong to the country, would be for us to have no mind, and to seem not to possess it.
6
But by proposing rewards for single horse contests, and for colts, that have not shed their first teeth, and for those that are between full-grown horses and colts, and to those that are full-grown, we should introduce an equestrian amusement, suited to the na­ ture of the country.
Let then there be on these points, accord­ ing to law, a contest and a love of contests, and let there be granted to the Phylarchs and Hipparchs a decision in com­ mon respecting all the courses themselves and those, who descend into them as competitors with their arms on.
But by establishing contests either in gymnastic exercises or for those without arms here, we shall not correctly lay down the law.
But as an archer on horseback, or a javelin-hurler, a Cretan is not useless, so that there will be1 for the sake of sport a strife and contest in these points.
But it is not fit to force females by laws relating to these matters and by ordinances touching a sharing in common.
But if from their previous education, proceeding to a habit, their nature admits of it, and there is no reluctance in boys2 and virgins to take a share, (it is proper) to permit them and not to blame.[5.]
Here then has there now completely come to an end the plan for contending and the learning of gymnastics on such points, as we labour in contests, and such (as we learn) under 3 masters day by day.
And of music, moreover, the greater part has been gone through in like manner, and the matters relating to the Rhapsodists, and those that follow after them, and whatever contests of choirs necessarily occur at festivals, and will be orderly arranged in the months, and on the days, and in the years,4 assigned to the gods and those with them,5 whether they are distributed into triennial periods, or quinquennial, or in whatever way or manner the gods have given an idea respecting their arrangement.
At that period too it is meet to expect that the contests of music will take place, when ordered by the prize-distributers and the instructor of the youths, and the guardians of the laws;
who, on meeting together at a common spot, touching those very matters, shall become themselves the lawgivers, as to the time when, and the persons who, and with whom, they shall make the contests relating to all choirs and dancing.
But of what kind each of these ought to be, both with respect to the language, and songs, and harmonies mingled with rhythms and dancing, has been often said by the first legislator;
according to which the second legislators ought, by following in their steps, to distri­ bute the contests in a manner befitting the several sacrifices at proper periods, and to permit the city to enjoy its festivals.
With respect to these and other such like points, it is not dif­ ficult to know what kind of a lawful arrangement they should obtain by lot;
1 nor would the placing them here and there bring any great gain or loss to the state.
But what is of no small consequence, and difficult to effect by persuasion, 2 would be the work especially of a god ;
2 if indeed it is possible for the regulation to exist from him ;
but now there seems almost to be the need of some bold man to do honour pre-eminently to the liberty of speech, and to state what seems to be the best for a city and citizens, by enjoining upon souls, that have become corrupt, what is becoming and consequent upon the whole polity, and by speaking in opposition to the greatest desires, and this without having a human being as an ally, but solely following reason alone.
Clin.
Of what reason are you now speaking, guest?
for we do not understand you.
Athen.
Very likely.
But I will endeavour to speak to you in a yet clearer manner.
For when I arrived in the discourse at education, I perceived the lads and lasses associating with each other in a friendly manner.
And it came, as was natural, upon me to be alarmed, when I considered how a person would use a state of that kind, where young men and women are deli­ cately brought up, and unoccupied in those violent and vulgar labours, which very greatly extinguish rudeness, and where sacrifices, and festivals, and choirs are a care to all through the whole of life.
By what means then in such a state will they abstain from those desires, which hurl many men and many women into the worst state, 1 from which should reason order them to abstain, a law is attempting to become.'
Indeed it is not wonderful, if the laws previously ordained obtained a mas­ tery over the majority of desires.
For the not permitting a person to be excessively wealthy, is a no trifling advantage towards being temperate;
and the whole of education has adopted laws in moderation for objects of this kind.
Added to this, the eye of the rulers is compelled not to look elsewhere, but to regard even the young.
2
These then, such at least as relate to man, possess moderation, as compared with the rest of desires.
2 But against the (unnatural) 3 love for boys and girls, and for wo­ men (as if they were)4 men, and for men (as if they were)5 women, whence innumerable evils6 arise both to men indivi­ dually and to whole cities, how can any one be on their guard ?
and 7by cutting what remedy7 for each of these will a per­ son discover an escape from such a danger ?
This is by no means easy, Clinias.
For in other things not a few the whole of Crete and Lacedæmon will properly8 contribute no small assistance to us, while laying down laws alien to the manners of the majority;
but in matters of love-since we are alone,9 (I say it,) they are entirely opposed to us.'
For, if any one, following nature, should lay down the law, which was prior to the time of Laïus,2 and assert it was proper not to have an intercourse with men and boys, as if they were females, and bring forward as a witness the nature of wild beasts, and show that for such purposes the male does not touch the male, through its being unnatural, perhaps he would make use of a probable reason;
but he would by no means accord with your cities.
3Moreover he would not agree with them in that point,3 which we have said the legislator ought always to observe.
For we ever seek4 in the laws laid down what contributes to virtue or not.
Come then (say), should we agree that this may be at present laid down legally as something beautiful, or at least as not base, what part of it would aid us in the road to virtue ?
Whether, when it takes place, will the habit of fortitude be produced in the soul of him, who is per­ suaded ?
or a kind of a temperate form in the soul of him who persuades?
Or would no one be persuaded on these points ?
but rather in every way the contrary of this.
Will every one blame the soft disposition of him, who yields to plea­ sures, and is incapable of self-control ?
But will not every one blame on the other hand the likeness of the image in him, who proceeds to an imitation of the female sex ?
What man then will lay down as a law such a thing as this ?
Scarcely not one, who has true law in his mind.
How then do we say that this is true?
It is necessary for a person to see the nature of friendship and desire at the same time, and of the so-called loves, if he would reflect upon these matters cor­ rectly.
For they are two, and there is another and a third kind arising from both, and which, comprehended under one name, produces every doubt and darkness.[6.]
Athen.
We surely call a friend one, who is like to like and equal to equal, as regards virtue.
1
And on the other hand, a friendly thing that, which is in want of what has become wealthy, although it is the contrary in sex.'
But when each of these friendships becomes vehement, we call it love.
Clin. Right.A then.
The friendship, then, which arises from contraries is horrible and coarse, and does not often possess any thing in common;
but that which arises from similars is mild and common to both parties through life.
But as regards that, which is mixed up with these, it is not, in the first place, easy to learn thoroughly what the person, who possesses this third love, would wish to happen to himself;
and, in the next place, being drawn by both to a contrary point, be is in a state of doubt;
the one exhorting him to enjoy the prime of youth, and the other forbidding him.
For he, who is a lover of the body and hungers after its 2 beauty, as if it were a ripe grape,2 exhorts himself to be filled with it, and pays no honour to the moral feeling in the soul of his beloved.
But he, who holds the desire of the body as a thing of secondary import­ ance, and 3looks rather than loves3 with his soul, is wont, after feeling a desire for the soul in a becoming manner, to consider the satiety relating to the body4 as an insult;
but, reverencing, at the same time, and worshiping temperance, and fortitude, and what is highly becoming, 5 and prudence, he would wish to live ever chastely with the object of his love.
But the love, which is mixed up with both these, is the love, which we have just now detailed as the third.
Since then there are these so many in number,1 ought the law to forbid all of them, and prevent them from subsisting in us ?
or, is it not manifest that we should wish for the love, which is of virtue, and which is desirous of a young person becoming the best possible, to exist in the state ?
and, if it were possi­ ble, that we would prevent the other two ?
Or how shall we say, friend Megillus ?
Megil.
You have spoken, guest, on these very matters in a manner perfectly beautiful.
Athen.
I was likely, as I conjectured, friend, to meet with your accordance in sentiment.
And there is no need for me to examine what your law intends on points of this kind, but for me to receive your agreement with my reasoning.
But after this, I will again endeavour to persuade Clinias by a kind of enchantment tobe of our opinion.
Let then, what has been conceded by you to me, be dismissed, and let us now go through entirely the laws.
Megil.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
For laying down law itself 3
I possess a certain art, which at present is partly easy, and partly in every respect the most difficult possible.
Athen.
We know even at present very many men, who, although they act contrary to law, yet are restrained properly and carefully from an intercourse with beautiful persons, not unwillingly, but as much as possible willingly..egil.
When, say you ?
Athen.
When any one has a beautiful brother or sister ;
and in the case of a son or daughter, the same law, although unwritten, defends as sufficiently as possible (a person)4 from sleeping with (them) either openly or in secret, 5 or in any other way from embracing and touching them.
5
Nor does even the desire of this intercourse come at all upon the masses.
Atken.
Does not then a small word extinguish all such pleasures ?
Athen.
The assertion that these acts are by no means holy, but hateful to the gods, and of [all] 1 base acts the most base.
And is not this the cause, that no one even speaks of them in other terms?
but that each of us immediately from our birth 2 hear persons speaking of these acts at all times and in all places, both in fun and oftentimes in all the so-called seriousness of tragedy, when persons introduce 3Thyesteses, or some CEdi­ puses or Macareuses,3 who have had secretly a connexion with their sisters,4 but on being detected have readily inflicted death as the punishment of their wickedness upon themselves ?
Megil.
You have spoken most truly so far as this, that fame5 has some wonderful power, since no one attempts even to breathe in any other manner6 contrary to law.[7.]
Athen.
That, therefore, which we just now said was right, that for a legislator, desirous of bringing under sub­ jection some one of those passions, which pre-eminently get the mastery of men, it is easy to know in what manner he should take this in hand.
For by making this (evil) report a holy thing amongst all the slaves and free-born and children 1 and women, and the whole city, he will 2in the same manner 2 thus work out the greatest stability relating to this law.
Megil.
Entirely so.
But (consider) 3 how it will be pos­ sible to make all persons willingly speak in this manner.
Athen.
You have taken me up correctly.
For this is what was stated by myself, that I possess an art, relating to this law, of making use of an intercourse according to nature for the procreation of children, by persons abstaining from a con­ nexion with males, and not designedly destroying the race of man, nor sowing upon rocks and stones that, which,4 even if it takes root, will never obtain its naturally productive power;
and by abstaining from every female field, 5 in which what is sown is unwilling to germinate.
This law then, by becoming perpetual and in power at the same time, as it is now in power in the case of the intercourse amongst parents, would, 6 if it prevailed in other connexions justly,6 produce benefits innu­ merable.
For, in the first place, it is laid down according to nature.
And, next, it causes persons to restrain from the fury and madness of love, from all adulteries, and all the immo­ derate use of meats and drinks, and to be familiar with and friendly to their wives ;
and many other benefits would arise 8 if any one could be the master of this law.
8
But, perhaps, some violent and young man, who is brim-full of seed, would, on hearing this law laid down, immediately abuse (us) for framing laws foolish and impracticable, and would fill every place with his vociferations.
It was then through looking to this, that I said I possessed a certain art, in part the easiest of all, and in part the most difficult, for perpetuating this very law, when laid down.
For it is very easy to understand that this is possible, and in what way it is so.
For we have said that, when this legal institution shall have been sufficiently made holy, it will bring under subjection every soul, and cause them through fear to be entirely obedient to the laws laid down.
But matters at present have come to such a pass, that it appears it never can take place ;
just as the practice of common meals is believed to be a thing impossible for a whole state to practise through its whole life and to exist ;
2 and though it has been proved by the fact, that it does take place amongst you, yet as regards the female sex, it does not seem even in your states 3to have the nature of being able to exist (for ever).
3
Hence through the strength of this unbelief, I said it was very difficult for both of these to remain according to law.
Megil.
And you were right in saying so.
Athen.
Since then it is not above the power of man, but it may indeed take place, are you willing that I should endea­ vour to tell a tale bordering on credibility ?
Athen.
Will then a person abstain more easily from venery and be willing to do, what is enjoined, respecting it, in a moderate manner, 4 when he has his body in a good condition, and not like an ordinary person,4 or when in a bad one ?
Clin.
By much the most, when it is not like an ordinary person.
Athen.
Do we then not know by hearsay of Iccus5 of Taren- tium, how,1 for the sake of his contests at Olympia and the rest,2 he did, from his love of contest and his art and his possessing in his soul fortitude combined with temperance, never, as the story goes, touch any woman or a boy during the whole period of his practiced
And the same account is told of Crysson, and Astylus, and Diopompus, and very many others;
al­ though they were much worse educated as to their souls than my fellow-citizens and yours too, Clinias, and had their bodies swelling much more with carnal desires.
Clin.
In this you speak the truth that, what has been stated by persons of old respecting those athletes, did really take place.
Athen.
What then, did they for the sake of victory in wrestling, and in running, and such like things, dare to abstain from that, which is called happiness by the masses ?
and shall our youth be unable to have a mastery over themselves, for the sake of a far more excellent victory ?
which we tell them from their very childhood is the most beautiful, and in fables in prose, and by singing in verse, charm them, as is natural.
Athen.
The victory over pleasure;
( so that)4 by being masters of themselves they live happily;
but by being mas­ i tered, the very reverse.
In addition to this, will not the dread of its being at no time and by no means a holy act give them the power to be the masters over those things, which others, worse than them, have mastered ?
Clin.
It is probable.[8.]
Athen.
Since then we have arrived thus far on the subject of this law, but have fallen into a difficulty through the wickedness of the many, I assert (with confidence),5 6that our legal institution ought to march on without disguise, and to say on these points,6 that our citizens ought not to be worse than birds, and many other wild animals;
who, produced in large herds,1 live without intercourse, and pure, and chaste, up to the time of procreation;
but when they arrive at that period, the male for its gratification pairing with the female, and the female with the male, they live for the remainder of their time in a holy and just manner, firmly abiding in the first compacts of friendship.
It is requisite then for them2 to be better than wild beasts.
If however they are corrupted by the other Greeks, and the greatest number of the Barba­ rians, and on seeing what is called the unregulated Aphrodite, and on hearing that it has the greatest power, are thus unable to have a mastery over it, there will be a need for the guardians of the laws to become legislators, and to devise for them a second law.
Clin.
What law would you advise to be laid down for them, if the one now laid down escapes them ?
Athen.
Evidently, Clinias, that which follows upon this.
Clin.
What law do you mean ?
Athen.
That they should especially cause the strength of pleasures to be not exercised, by turning, by means of labours, to other parts of the body the course of their overflow and feeding.
3
And this will take place, if in the use of venereal pleasures there is no shamelessness.
For they, who, through shame, make a rare use of a thing of this kind, will have their mistress of less power, 4 [by using it seldom].
4 5 Let it then be held by custom and an unwritten law, that to do any of these lawful things secretly, is honourable;
but not secretly, is disgraceful ;
5 6but not to do it, not at all;
thus this would lie in our law as being disgraceful on the other hand, and honour­ able secondly possessing a second rectitude.
6
And thus one genus, comprehending three genera, would compel those, who are corrupted in their nature, (and) whom we have spoken of as being inferior to themselves, not to act contrary to the law.
Clin.
What are these ?
Athen.
The god-worshipping (genus), and the honour-loving, and that which is produced from the desire not of beauties in the body but of those really existing in the manners of the soul.
And these matters perhaps, now detailed by us, are like prayers1 in a fable;
but they will be by far the best, should they perchance exist in all states.
Perhaps, too, if a god pleases, we may compel one of two things to take place in matters of love;
either that no one shall dare to touch any free and well-born woman, besides his married wife, or sow the seed, for which there has been no sacrificial rite,2 and which is illegitimate, amongst harlots, nor that, which is barren, amongst males, contrary to nature ;
or we will take away en­ tirely the intercourse of males;
but with respect to females, if any one has an intercourse with any one, except those who come to his house, together with the gods, and sacred mar­ riages, whether such women are bought, or acquired by any other means, 3 and he does not lie hid from all men and women,3 to such a person we should, if we caused him by law to be dis­ franchised of the privileges4 in the state, perhaps appear to have acted by law correctly, as being one who is truly like a foreigner.
Let this law, whether it is one, or we ought to call them two, be laid down respecting all venereal and amatory matters, which, through having an intercourse with each other from desires of such a kind, we transact both in a proper and improper manner.
Megil.
Even now, 1 0 guest, I would vehemently accept this law from you ;
but let Clinias here tell us himself, what he thinks on these points.
CUn.
So shall it be, Megillus, when it appears to me that a fitting opportunity presents itself;
but, for the present, per­ mit our guest to proceed forward in the matter of his laws.
Megil. Right.[9.]
Athen.
But having proceeded so far, we are almost at the establishment of common meals, which we said would with difficulty exist elsewhere;
but in Crete no one else2 would suppose that it ought to be adopted.
But after what manner ?
whether as here, or as at Lacedæmon ?
or is there a third kind of common meals beside these, which would be better than both ?
This it seems to me it is not difficult to discover ;
and when discovered, to work out not a great good.
For what has been now prepared is in an elegant condition.
Following upon these is the preparation for livelihood, 3 in what manner it ought to follow them.
3
Now a livelihood in other states would be of various kinds and many, and especially from the double sources of what there would be to these.
For what relates to food is obtained by most of the Greeks from the earth and sea ;
but by these from the earth alone.
This therefore will present a more easy task for the legislator.
4
For not only will half the laws be moderate, but much fewer,4 and still befitting free-men.
For the legislator of this state is freed for the most part from matters re­ lating to ship-owners, and foreign merchants, and retail dealers, and inn-keepers, and tax-collectors, and miners, land money-lenders, and usurers at compound interest, 1 and ten thousand other things of this kind, and bids them all go hang ;
but he will lay down laws for the tillers of land, and shepherds, and the breeders of bees, and the guardianship and the superintendents of the operations connected with such matters, after having laid down laws on subjects of the greatest moment relating to marriages, and the procreation and the bringing up of children, and still further, their educa­ tion, and the establishment of magistracies in the state.
But at present it is necessary for the legislator to turn himself 2to (the laws), relating to feeding2 and to those, who labour for it.
Let the laws then, called Agricultural, be first laid down.
And let this be mentioned as the first law relating to Zeus, who presides over boundaries.
Let no one remove the land­ marks, either of a fellow-citizen, who is a friend, or of a neighbour, 3 while possessing himself at the extremities he is a neighbour to another stranger,3 thinking that this is truly "
To remove what is not to be removed."
4
But let every one be de­ sirous to attempt to remove the greatest other5 [except a bound­ ary] stone5 rather than a small stone, which is the boundary of friendship and hatred sworn before the gods.
For Zeus, who presides over a kindred-clan, is the witness of the one, and he who presides over hospitality, of the other;
which deities 1 are excited together with the most hateful wars.'
Now he, who is obedient to the law, will have no perception of the ills, that come from it:
but let him, who despises it, be exposed to a double punishment, one, and the first, from the gods, but the second, under the law.
For let no one voluntarily remove the land­ mark of his neighbour;
and against him, who does remove them, let any one, who is willing, inform the landowners ;
and let them bring him into court;
and if any one has to pay damages on the charge of his having made privately and by force the land to be without a division, 2 (respecting) the party so having to pay,2 let the court fix the penalty, as to what he is to suffer (in person) or in purse after being defeated.
After this, many and small injuries from neighbours do, through their fre­ quency, beget a great weight of enmity, and cause a neigh­ bourhood to be disagreeable and excessively bitter.
Hence it is requisite for a neighbour to take every care not to cause any differences with his neighbour;
and to be particularly cautious in other matters, and especially as regards the cul­ tivation of grounds, which they have a mutual right to till.
For to do an injury is by no means difficult, but is in the power of every man ;
but to do a benefit is not in the power of every one.
Let him then, who, stepping over his own boundary, secretly tills3 his neighbour's land, pay for the mischief done;
and, on account of his shameless and sordid conduct, pay another sum, the double of the mischief to the injured party.
Of these and all such like matters let the Land- Stewards take cognizance, and act as judges and fix the fine;
and over the greater suits, as it has been stated before, let the whole order of the twelfth part (preside) ;
but of the lesser, the chiefs of the guardians of these.
And if any one 1 pas­ tures his flocks over (his neighbours' grounds),1 let those who witness the injury, decide upon it and fix the fine.
And if a person appropriates to himself the swarms of bees belong­ ing to another, 2 by following the pleasure of the bees, and making a noise, by beating them down2 thus makes them his own, let him pay for the injury done.
And if any one sets fire to his own wood, and takes no thought of his neighbour's, let him be fined according to the damage decided on by the rulers.
And if in planting he does not leave a proper distance from his neighbour's land, (let him pay,)3 as has been stated even by many legislators sufficiently ;
of whose laws it is meet to make use, and not to think that the greater regulator of a state is to lay down laws for all matters, both great and small, and such as belong to a casual legislator.
Since relating even to water laws of the olden time, and those beautiful too, have been laid for the tillers of the ground, which it is not proper 5for us to use (like water-channels) in our discoursed
But let him, who will, lead water to his own ground, com­ mencing from common streams, and not cutting off the sources, evidently belonging to a private person;
and let him lead it where he likes, except 'through dwellings, or certain sacred (places) or tombs, and doing no damage, except what arises from1 leading aside the water.
But if the natural dryness of the ground in certain places should be incapable of retaining the waters from Zeus,2 and there is a deficiency in necessary drink, let a person dig in his own ground, until he comes to the clay.
3
But if in this depth he does not meet with water, let him draw from his neighbours as much drink as is neces­ sary for each of his domestics.
But if there should be a scarcity4 amongst his neighbours also, let him, after receiv­ ing an order from the Land-Stewards, take to himself the regulation-allowance each day, and thus have a share in the water of his neighbour.
But if there be water from Zeus, and one of those on the lower ground does an injury to a farmer on the upper, or to the party dwelling near him, by not allow­ ing an outlet to the water;
or, on the contrary, if the party above carelessly permits the waters to run down, and does an injury to a party below;
and (the two parties) are for this unwilling to communicate5 with each other on these matters, let the party, who wishes it, bring in a City-Steward in the city, and in the country a Land-Steward, and let him regu­ late himself6 what each ought to do;
and let him, who does not abide by the regulation, undergo a punishment for his envious and at the same time morose temper, and let him, the verdict being against him, pay to the injured party the double of his loss, 1 through not being willing to obey the person in office.1[10.]
It is meet likewise for all to have a communion in some such way as this of the fruits of autumn.
2
The god­ dess herself has a twofold gift of grace for us ;
2 one a Dionysal instruction,3 not to be treasured up;
the other, which is na­ turally suited for laying by.
Let then this law be ordained respecting the fruits of autumn.
Whoever tastes the rustic fruit, be it grapes or figs, before the season for gathering them, which falls in with the rising of Arcturus,4 either in his own or the grounds of others, pay fifty drachms sacred to Dionysus, if he has plucked them from his own land;
but if from his neighbour's, a mina ;
5 but if from that of others, two­ thirds of a mina.
But let him who wishes to gather the grape now called " well-born," 6 or grapes called well-born," 7 if he takes them from his own ground, pluck them how and when he likes;
but if from another's, let him, if he has not persuaded (the owner), be fined 1 in that way ever1 following out the law,2 that a person is not to remove what he has not put down.
But if a slave, not having persuaded the owner of the ground, gathers any fruit of this kind, let him be scourged with stripes equal in number to each grape on a bunch and fig on the tree.
Let a foreign settler, who has bought the "well-born" autumnal fruity eat them if he pleases;
but if a stranger sojourning in the land, as he passes along the road, (either alone) 4 or with one follower, desires to taste the au­ tumnal fruit, let him taste the " well-born " fruit, receiving it as the gift of a host;
but the law prohibits even a person of such a kind5 from sharing in the fruit called rustic.
If any one ignorantly tastes these, either himself or a slave, let a person punish the slave with stripes, but send away the free person after admonishing and teaching him that he may taste other autumnal fruits (unfit) 6 for laying by, but that those, belonging to raisins and wine and dry figs, are unfit for him to have.
With respect to pears, and apples, and pomegranates, and all such fruits, let it not be held a disgraceful act to gather them secretly.
But if a person under thirty years of age is detected (gathering them), let him be struck and repelled, but without wounds, but let there be no infliction of such like blows upon a free-man.
And let it likewise be lawful for a stranger to be a partaker of these, as of the autumnal fruits.
7
But if any older person tastes of them, eating them on the spot, and secretly taking away none, let him partake of all such as a stranger does ;
but if he is not obedient to the law, let him run the risk of being no competitor for virtue, should any one at that time give information of such matters to the then judges.[11.]
Water for gardens is pre-eminently the most nutritive of all things, but it is easily rendered corrupt.
For it is not easy to corrupt either the earth, or the sun, or the air, which together with water are the nourishers of what springs up from the soil, either by drugs, or turnings aside, or thefts ;
but all such things as these can take place in the case of the nature of water;
and hence it requires the assistance of law.
Let this then be (the law) respecting it.
If any one willingly corrupts the water of another by drugs, or diggings, or thefts, whether such water be from a spring or collected (in a tank), let the party injured have a trial before the City-Stewards, I and write down the estimated amount of the injury.
1 2
And if any one be found guilty of having corrupted it by any drugs, let him, in addition to the fine, cleanse the spring or the tank of water in the way that the laws of the (holy) interpreters shall point out, how the cleansing ought to be done on each occasion, and by each person.
2With respect to the conveyance of all fruits in season, let it be lawful for any, who wishes, to carry home his own pro­ perty through every place, wherever he shall do no damage to any one, or gain an advantage himself three times as much as the damage done to his neighbour.
But of these questions let the magistrates take cognizance, and of all other injuries that one person wilfully commits by violence or secretly against another person unwillingly, either himself or his pro­ perty, by means of the property of the former.
And let the party (injured) lay all matters of this kind before the rulers, and receive compensation for the injury up to three minæ;
but if the complaint of one person against another be of a higher amount, let him bring his suit before the common courts of justice, and let him have satisfaction against the party, who has done the injury.
But if any magistrate shall be found to decide upon the damage with an unjust sentence, let him be considered as a debtor to the injured person for twice the loss sustained.
And let any one, who wishes it, bring the unjust conduct of the magistrate before the common tribunals in each case of complaint.
But as there are ten thousand trifling things of law, according to which punishments ought to be inflicted, respecting the distribution of trials by lot, and the citations, and the persons citing, whether the citation ought to be made before two, or how many, and whatever else is of such a kind, these are not to be left unregulated by law, nor yet are they worthy of an aged legislator.
Let young men, therefore, lay down the laws relating to these, 1 (by looking) to the enactments of their predecessors, and modelling trifling matters after great, 1 and by becoming experienced in the neces­ sary use of them, till every thing shall appear to be sufficiently laid down.
2
And then rendering them immovable, let them live and use them as possessing a power in moderation.
2With respect to the other handicraft trades, it is requisite to act in this manner.
In the first place, let no person of the country be one of those, who labour at handicraft trades, nor yet the domestic of a person of the country.
For a citizen, who is to preserve and hold the arrangements of the state, com­ mon to all, is engaged in an art requiring much practice, and, at the same time, much learning, nor is he able 3 to attend to the pursuit as a by-work.
Now to labour accurately in two pur­ suits, or two arts, scarcely not a single nature of man is suffi­ dent.
Nor is the same person sufficient4 to exercise one art, and to superintend another person, exercising another.
This therefore ought first of all to take place in a state.
Let no coppersmith be at the same time a carpenter;
nor let a carpenter attend more to others, who are coppersmiths, than to his own art, making as a pretext, that while he is attending to many servants, who are working for him, he very reasonably attends more to them, for the sake of greater gain accruing from thence to himself than from his own art;
but let every artist in the state exercise one art alone, and from that obtain his living.
This law let the City-Stewards with all exertion preserve;
and let them punish with disgrace and infamy any person of the country, if he inclines to any art more than to the attention to virtue, until they bring him to his own pro­ per course.
But if any stranger applies himself to two arts, let them, by punishing him with bonds, and fines, and ex­ pulsions from the city, compel him to be one person instead of being many.
With respect to the wages of workmen, and the destruction1 of their works, and 2 should any other person injure them, or they3 any one else, let the City-Stewards pass a judgment as far as to fifty drachms ;
but beyond this, let the common tribunals decide according to law.
And let no person in the state pay any duty on exports and imports.
But with respect to frankincense, and other foreign aromatics, for the gods, and purple, and other dyed colours, which this country does not produce, or with respect to any other art, requiring foreign articles to be imported, let no one introduce any of these without some necessity;
nor, on the other hand, export any thing which it is necessary to remain in the country.
On all these matters let the twelve guardians of the laws, five of the elder being excepted, take the cog­ nizance and have the care.
With respect to arms and all warlike instruments, if there should be a necessity for im­ porting any foreign art, relating to plants,4 5or metals, or chains,5 or any animals, 6 on account of their use of such a kind,6 let the Hipparchs and the Generals have full powers over the import and export of such articles, 7 the state giving at the same and receiving ;
7 but the guardians of the laws shall lay down, respecting these matters, laws be­ coming and sufficient.
And let there be no higgling for the sake of money-making, 1 either by this person or any one else,' either in the whole country or city, or in any part.[12.]
With respect to food and the distribution of the pro­ duce of the country, the correctness of the method near to that laid down by the law in Crete, would seem, if adopted, to be adopted with reason.
For it is meet that all should distribute into twelve parts the whole produce of the land, in which way also it is to be consumed.
Let every twelfth part, for example, of wheat and barley, of which let all the rest of fruits be the followers, that are to be divided, and all the animals in each,2 that are to be sold, be divided into three parts, according to a certain proportion ;
one being for free-men, another for their domestics, and the third for handicraftsmen and strangers generally, and such as are residing with the foreign settlers, in want of necessary sustenance, or are constantly arriving during the exigencies of the state, or any individual.
Of all the necessaries (of life), let this third part so distributed be alone vendible from necessity;
but of the two others let nothing be necessarily sold.
How then would these be dis­ tributed most correctly ?
In the first place, it is evident that we should distribute3 them partly equally, and partly un­ equally.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
It must needs be, that the land produces and brings up each of these things worse or better.
Athen. 4
In such a way then as this, 4 as there are three parts, let no part have more, when distributed, either (that)5 for masters or slaves, nor, on the other hand, that for strangers ;
but let the distribution give 1 the equality of similitude, 1 the same to all.
And let each citizen, on receiving his two parts, have the power to distribute both to slaves and free-men, as much of his share, and of what kind, as be pleases.
2
But the greater quantity of tbese2 it is meet to be distributed by measure and number, in this way, (by a person) taking the number of all the animals to which there ought to be food from the earth and distributing it.
After this it is meet for habitations to be separately assigned them in an orderly regulated manner.
Now the following regulation is suited to matters of this kind.
There ought to be twelve hamlets, one in the middle of each twelfth part;
and in each hamlet, to be selected first a market- place, and temples for the gods and the daemons, who follow the gods;
and whether these are some local (heroes) amongst the Magnetes,3 or the holy seat of other ancients, whose memory has been preserved, to these let persons pay the honours due to ancient men, and found every where temples to Vesta, and Zeus, and Athéné, and to him who may be the leader of the others, that belong to each twelfth part.
And first (it is meet) for the buildings to be about these temples, where the ground is the highest, as receptacles the best protected possible for the garrison ;
but to prepare all the rest of the country, by dis­ tributing it into thirteen parts for the handicraftsmen ;
and to cause one portion of these to settle in the city, by distributing this portion amongst the twelve parts of the whole city ;
4 (but to have the other) 4 persons distributed out of the city, and in a circle about it;
and every hamlet to cause the race of handi­ craftsmen to settle together, that are useful to the agricul­ turists ;
and of all these let the Land-Stewards have the care, and of how many and of what kind each place may require;
and of the spots in which the handicraftsmen may dwell, and be the least annoyance, and the greatest benefit to the agricul- turists;
but of those in the city, let the City-Stewards in like manner have the care.1 [13.]
But to the City-Stewards each of the matters relating to the market-place must be a care.
For after their inspection of the sacred things, let their atten­ tion (be given) to the matters of the market-place, 2lest any one does wrong in what relates to the needs of man ;
2 their second work would be to punish, as being the inspectors of temperance and insolence, the person requiring punishment;
but such of the vendible articles, as the citizens are under re­ gulations to sell, they must first look into, in behalf of the strangers, whether each article is according to the law.
And let the law be this.
On the new 3 day of each 4 month, let the superintendents5 bring out a portion of what is to be sold to the foreigners ;
namely, a first twelfth part of the corn ;
and let the foreigner buy corn, and such things as pertain to corn, on the first market for the whole month.
But on the twelfth 6 day of the month, let some make a selling, and others a buy­ ing of liquid articles, sufficient for the whole of the month.
And on the twenty-third day (of the month), let there be a sale of such animals 7 as are to be sold by each party, or bought by those in want of them, and the sale of such chattels and goods as (suit) the agriculturists, such as of skins, and all kind of clothing, either woven or felt-like, or other things of such a kind ;
7 8 but it is necessary for foreigners to acquire them by purchasing from others;
but the retail dealing in these articles either barley or wheat, distributed in the form of meal, or any other food in general, for citizens and their slaves, let no one sell or buy from any person of this kind.,
But in the markets for foreigners, let a foreigner (sell) to the handicraftsmen, and their slaves, 1 exchanging the sold articles for wine and food, which the majority call a retail trading;
and let the cooks expose for sale portions of animals cut into pieces to foreigners and handicraftsmen and their domestics.
1
Let too a foreigner buy daily the whole of the materials for burning in a mass, from the superintendents of farms, and sell it again to other foreigners for as much as he pleases, and when he pleases.
But of all other goods and chattels, as much as there is a need of them to each person, let (the foreigners) sell (any part)2 at the common market, after bringing them to a place appointed 3 for each occasion,4 5 where they shall wait, having made a conjecture about fitting situations, until the guardians of the laws, and the Stewards of the market, with the City-Stewards, shall have marked out the limits of the sale-stands.
5
In these places let a person exchange money for goods, and goods for money, one party not giving up to another the article of bar­ ter (without an equivalent).
1
But if a person does give it up in confidence, whether he recovers (its value) or not, let him rest contented ;
as there is no action relating to contracts of this kind.
2But the article sold and bought, by how much the more it is, or at a greater (price) than according to the law, which has stated through how much its being increased and de­ creased it is meet to do neither of these acts ;
2 let the greater be written up before the guardians of the laws, and the contrary expunged.
Let the same take place respecting the foreign set­ tIers with regard to the registering of their property.
And let any one, who wishes, come to the emigration on cer­ tain conditions, 3 as there is a location for any foreigner, who has the wish and the power to emigrate,3 if he belongs to any craft;
and if there is to him sojourning not more than twenty years from his enrolling himself, and paying no foreign set­ tler's tax, ever so small, except that of living temperately, nor any other hawker's licence for the sake of buying and selling.
But when the time (twenty years) shall have expired, let him take away his property and depart.
4
But if during these years it should happen to him to become a person of note through some sufficient acts of kindness done to the state, and he trusts he can persuade the Council and Assembly by making a request that a delay may take place in his quitting the country absolutely, or that he may stay there for the whole of life, let him go and persuade the city;
(and) whatever he may persuade, let it be accomplished for him.
4
But in the case of the sons of foreign settlers, who are handicraftsmen and fifteen years of age, let the period of their settlement com­ mence after their fifteenth year ;
and after these let a person remain twenty years, and then depart whither he pleases;
but if he wishes to remain let him remain after having per­ suaded (the government) on the same grounds.
1
But let the person, who is leaving, go and expunge for himself the regis­ trations, which have been written previously about him before the rulers.
1[1.] 2 AFTER these there would be law-suits, consequent upon all the preceding doings, according to the natural arrangement of laws.
Now of the doings whatsoever, respect­ ing which it is requisite for law-suits to take place, some have been mentioned, namely, those relating to agriculture, and what follow upon them;
3but some of the greatest moment have not been mentioned at all;
and each having been mentioned stated singly3 what recompence it ought to receive, and what judges to meet with, these are to be stated after those in order.
Clin. Right.
Athen.
It were, however, after a manner disgraceful 1 to lay down all the laws, that we are now about to do, in such a kind of state as we assert will be well regulated, and meet with every thing leading directly to the pursuit of virtue.
For2 ever to think that in such a state a man can be born, who will participate in the depravity 3of the others, the greatest,3 so that it is necessary to lay down laws by antici­ pation, and to put out threats, should such a character arise, and for the sake of averting these, when they do arise, to lay down against them laws of punishment, as if they would arise,4 (this,) as I said, were after a manner disgraceful.
But since we do not, as the ancient legislators did, give laws5 to heroes the sons of gods, as the story now goes, and they who were born from gods, gave laws (to themselves) 6 and others, born them­ selves from such beings, but we do at present legislate as men for the seed of men, there is no dread of doing wrong in fearing that some of our citizens should be, as it were horn-struck,7 and become naturally so hard, as not to be liquefied, 1 (and,) as those kinds of pulse are in the case of fire, so these persons should in the case of laws, although ever so strong, become not wasted.
2 3
In favour of whom I will state what is no favour,3 first a law relating to sacrilege, should any one dare to commit it.
Now we would neither wish, nor is it to be very much feared, that any citizen amongst those, who have been properly brought up, will ever labour very greatly under this disease;
but their domestics and strangers, and the slaves of strangers, would attempt many things of this kind.
For the sake of whom especially, and at the same time being cautious of all the weakness of human nature, I shall mention the law relating to sacrilege,4 and all the other mat­ ters of that kind, as are to be cured, or 5 not to be cured at all.
The prelude, however, to these matters ought, according to what has been formerly agreed upon, to be as short as possible.
Some one then would, conversing and at the same time admonishing, address him, whom an evil desire calls aside by day and excites by night, and leads him to plunder temples, in these words :
—O wonderful man, no ill, either human or divine, stirs up that­ which is now urging you to proceed to an act of sacrilege, but a certain madness, begotten in men from crimes of old date, and not yet cleansed, and which is carried round in the form of something to be expiated ;
and against which you ought, with all your might, to be on your guard.
Learn, then, what this caution is.
When any such idea comes upon you, betake your­ self to expiatory rites ;
betake yourself, as a suppliant, to the temples of the gods who avert evils ;
(and) betake yourself to the society of men, who are called good, and partly hear, and partly endeavour yourself to say, that every man ought to honour what is beautiful and just.
But fly, without turning back, from the society of the wicked.
And if, while you are so doing, the disease becomes somewhat lighter, (it is well) ;
1 but if not, consider that death is more honourable than life, and free yourself from it.[2.]
Since, then, we have sung these preludes to those, who turn their thoughts to all such things as are unholy and destructive to the state, 2 it is meet for the law to be silent in the case of him who obeys :
2 but to him, who does not obey, to sing, after the prelude, loudly-He, who is detected in the act of sacrilege, if he is either a slave or a stranger, shall have the circumstance marked in his face and hands ;
3 and after be­ ing scourged with as many stripes as the judges shall think proper, he shall be cast out naked beyond the boundaries of the country.
For, perhaps, after suffering this punishment, he will, by being brought to his senses, become a better man.
For punishment, taking place according to law, is not inflicted as an evil, but it nearly effects one of two things;
for it makes him who suffers the punishment, either better or less depraved.
If however any citizen shall appear to have done any thing of this kind, in the shape of a crime, considered one of the heinous and not to be mentioned, 4 relating to the gods, or pa­ rents, or the state, the judge shall consider such a person to be incurable, from reflecting that though he had met with an education and a bringing up of so excellent a kind, he had not kept himself from the greatest wickedness.
Now to such a person death is the least of evils.
But he will by his ex­ ample benefit the rest, when he is held in dishonour, and is made to disappear, 1 and (is cast out) beyond the boundaries of the country.
But to his children and race, if they avoid their father's habits, let there be glory and words of honour, inas­ much as they have well and bravely fled from evil to good.
It will not, however, be becoming for the property of such per­ son to be confiscated to the state, in which the same and equal allotments ought to remain for ever.
But when any one shall be voted to have committed crimes worthy (of a loss) of property, let him pay 2 from his possession the fines,2 if there be any overplus beyond his allotment properly furnished;
and to this extent let him be fined, but not beyond.
And let the guardians of the laws, looking into these matters accurately from the registers, ever give a clear statement to the judges, in order that no one may be idle,3 with regard to his allot­ ment, through the want of means.
But should any one be voted to be worthy of a greater fine, and none of his friends be willing to be his surety, and, by paying jointly the fine, to pro­ cure his liberty, punish him with bonds for a length of time, and in public, and with some kind of ill-treatment;
4 and let no one for any offence be at any time without a punishment,5 not even if he is driven over the boundaries;
6 but it is meet for the punishment to be either death, or bonds, or stripes, or certain 1 formless sittings or standings, or by-standings at temples, 1 at the extreme parts of the country, or, as we before stated, the payment of money;
2and for the trial to take place in this way.
Let then the guardians of the laws be the judges of death;
and let the tribunal consist of the last year's ma­ gistrates, selected for their excellence.
But as regards the bringing (before the court) an accusation and the citing (the witnesses), and such like matters, and how they ought to take place, this must be the care of the junior legislators, but ours to lay down the law for regulating the manner of giving votes.
Now let the vote be given openly;
but, prior to this, let the judge be seated before the face of the accuser and defendant, 3in order, as near as possible, according to old age;
3 and let all the citizens too, who are at leisure, diligently attend as the hearers of such causes;
and let the accuser speak first one speech, and afterwards the defendant;
and after these speeches, let the senior judge commence by his own inquiry4 and proceed to a sufficient examination of what has been stated ;
and, after the elder judge, all the rest in order ought to go through whatever a person is 5 still desirous of being stated, or (re­ grets to have been) not stated5 by each party.
But let him, who desires or regrets nothing, give up his right of inquiry to another.
But of the matters mentioned, whatever may seem to be to the purpose, let persons affix a seal to the writings, and, after putting the marks of all the judges, place the document in the temple of Vesta ;
and again on the morrow, after coming together to the same place, let them inquire into and go through the suit, and again affix marks to what has been stated ;
and when they shall have done this thrice, after having sufficient­ ly sifted the proofs and testimony, let each judge, carrying in his hand a sacred1 pebble, undertake before Vestal to decide, as far as he can, justly and truly, and thus put an end to a suit of this kind.[3.]
After the offences relating to the gods, (let us speak) 3 of those, that relate to the dissolution of a polity.
Now he, who brings a person into power and makes the laws slaves, and puts the state under the control of factious societies, and effects all this by force, and excites sedition, acts contrary to the law.
Such a person it is meet to consider as the greatest enemy of all to the whole state.
And it is meet to hold him as the second in wickedness,4 who, although not taking any part in any of these acts, yet while he has a share in the greatest offices of the state, either lies hid from the knowledge of these matters,5 or not lying hid does through cowardice not act the part of an avenger on behalf of his country.
But let every one, who is of the smallest utility, lay an information before the magistrates, 1 and bring to trial the person who is plotting for a violent and at the same time an illegal change in the form of government.
And let the judges for these be those in the cases of sacrilege ;
and let the whole process be conducted for the former in a similar manner as for the latter ;
and let the vote, 2which is the superior in number, bring with it death.
2
And in one word,3 let not the disgrace and punishment of the father follow upon any of the children, unless the father, grand­ father, and great-grandfather of any one have in succession paid the penalty of death ;
and let the children keep their own property, except so much as belongs completely to the regu­ lated allotment, and let the state send them away4 to their an­ cient paternal land and stated
But as to those citizens, who shall happen to have more children than one, and these not less than ten years of age, let ten of them cast lots, whom the father or grandfather on the father's or mother's side shall mark out;
and let the names of those who have obtained the lot be sent to Delphi;
and whomsoever the god fixes upon, (it is meet to) appoint with a better fortune as the heir of the family of those who have left their home.
Clin.
And properly so.
Athen.
Let there be still a one-third 5 law in common, respect­ ing the judges 6 [who ought to judge for them],6 and the mode of the suits, 7 in the case of those, against whom a person shall lay a charge of treason, and bring them before a court of justice.
7
In like manner, let there be in the case of their children this one law on all points1 touching their remaining in, or depart­ in- from, their country, as regards the three, a traitor, and him who commits sacrilege, and him who by violence destroys the laws of the state.
Against a thief too, whether he steals a thing great or small, let there be one law, and one punish­ ment, after a trial2 in all cases.
For if any one is cast in a trial of this kind, and he has other property, beyond his allot­ ment, sufficient to pay, he must in the first place pay double of what has been stolen ;
but if he has not, let him be put into bonds, until he either pays, or persuades the party, who has a verdict against him, (to forego his claim).
But if any one is cast in a trial relating to a public theft, let him be freed from bonds, after he has either persuaded the state, or paid the double of the property stolen.
CUn.
How say we, guest, that there is no difference in the case of a thief, who purloins a thing small or great, and from places sacred or not sacred;
and in such other cases, as pre­ sent a dissimilitude in the whole of thieving, which, as being various, the legislator ought to follow up by assigning pun­ ishments not similar at all ?
Athen.
You have, Clinias, in the best manner, nearly beaten me off, while I have been as it were carried along ;
3 and after stirring me up, you have reminded me, although I had previ­ ously thought of it myself, that the matters relating to the lay­ ing down of laws have never at any time been by any means properly worked out, 4 as it has fallen out to speak of them at present.
4CUn.
But how again say we this ?[4.]
Athen.
We did not make use of an incorrect image, when we compared all those, who were now regulated by laws, to slaves under the care of slave-physicians.
For it is meet to know a thing of this kind correctly, that if at any time one of those physicians, who handle the medical art from practice (alone) without theory, should come upon a free-born physician, discoursing with a free-born patient, and making use of the­ ories bordering upon philosophy, and touching upon the dis­ order from its very commencement, and going back to the subject relating to (the whole) nature of bodies, he would quickly and greatly laugh, and speak no other language than is ready on such subjects to be addressed to the majority of the so-called physicians.
For he would say—0 stupid fellow, you are not curing the sick man, but you are almost giving him a lesson, as if he wanted to become a physician, and not to be in health.
Clin.
And would he not speak properly in speaking so ?
A then.
1
And would not the same person deservedly object against us,1 that whoever discusses laws, as we do now, gives the citizens lessons, but not laws ?2 CUn.
And would he not seem to say this too correctly ?
2Athen.
Perhaps SO.3
But at present a fortunate circum­ stance has occurred to us.
Clin.
What is it ?
Athen.
That there is no necessity for us to lay down laws ;
but that, entering voluntarily upon an inquiry into all kinds of polity, we are endeavouring to perceive in what manner the best one and the most necessary may take place.
And now, as it seems, it is permitted us, if we please, to con­ sider what is the best, or, if we had rather, what is the most necessary on the question of laws.
Let us choose, then, whichever it seems (is best).
CUn.
We propose, 0 guest, a ridiculous choice, and we should become really similar to those legislators, who are compelled by some great necessity to give laws immediately, as being not permitted (to defer it) till the morrow.
But it is lawful for us to speak with god's will, just as it is for masons, or those, who commence any other putting together of ma­ terials, to bring together for ourselves dispersedly, things out of which we may select what is suited to the combination which is to be, and to collect them at leisure.
Let us then suppose ourselves to be for the present house-builders, not from necessity, but those, who at leisure put aside for their use some things, and put together others, so that we may have to say correctly, that some portions of the laws have been laid down, but others laid aside.
Athen.
For thus, Clinias, our survey of the laws will be more natural.
But, by the gods, let us consider some such thing as this, relating to legislators.
Athen.
There are writings and written discourses in cities by many other persons, and writings likewise and discourses by the legislator.
Athen.
Whether then shall we direct our attention to the compositions of the rest of poets, and of such as in prose 1 and in verse,l 2 have put together their advice relating to life, to be remembered by their having written them down,2 and by no means apply ourselves to the writings of legislators ?
Or (to the latter) most of all ?
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
But surely it is not necessary for the legislator alone of those who write to give counsel about things beauti­ ful, and good, and just, while teaching what they are, and how they ought to be studied by those, who are about to be happy.
Athen.
But is it more disgraceful for Homer, and Tyrtæus, and the rest of poets, to have laid down in their writings what is incorrect, relating to life and its pursuits, and less so for Lycurgus, Solon, and such as, being legislators, have composed writings ?
Or is this correct, that of all writings in cities those relating to laws ought to appear, when unfolded,' the most beautiful and best;
2but that those of the rest, either following after them, or at discordance with them, are to be laughed down ?
23 Clin.
Let us think in this way.
Athen.
And3 that with regard to the writing down of laws, it ought to take place in states, that the writings seem to be of persons, who, in the garb of a father or mother, have feel­ ings of love, and possess a mind, 4 and not, like a tyrant 4 and despot, commanding and threatening, 5 and after writing (de­ crees) on walls, to depart.
5
Let us consider then, even now, whether we should, after thinking upon laws, endeavour to speak in this manner, whether we are able or not.
Let us (gird up ourselves6 for it), exhibiting at least an alacrity, and proceeding along this road, let us, if we must suffer aught, endure it.
And may the attempt be fortunate;
and (fortunate), if god pleases, it will be in this way.
Clin.
You have spoken well.
And let us do as you say.[5.]
Athen.
In the first place then, let us accurately con­ sider, as we have attempted to do, respecting those who com­ mit sacrilege, and about every kind of theft, and injuries of all kinds.
And let us not take it ill, if we lay down some, during our legislating, and deliberate about others.
For we are becoming to be legislators, but are not yet so, although perhaps we soon shall be.
But if it seems good to you, to consider about what I have said, let us, 1as I have said,' consider.
Clin.
By all means.
Athen.
With regard to all things that are beautiful and just, let us endeavour to look in some such way as this, how we may for the present agree with, and how differ from our­ selves;
2who would say that we desire, if nothing else, to differ from the majority, and the majority too on the other hand with themselves.
2Clin.
Of what kind of disagreement among ourselves are you speaking ?
Athen.
I will endeavour to state.
On the question of jus­ tice generally, and of just men, and of things, and of actions, we all of us in a manner agree, that all these are beautiful;
3 so that if any one should strenuously affirm that just men are, through their most just habit, all-beautiful, although they should happen to be ugly in body, scarcely a single person would, by speaking thus, be thought to speak improperly.
4
Is not this true ?
Clin.
Perhaps so.
Athen.
But let us see4 that, if all things that border upon justice are beautiful, 1the sufferings of all of us are nearly equal to our doings.
1Athen.
Whatever action is just, so far as it partakes of what is just, it nearly partakes of the beautiful likewise.
Athen.
Whatever suffering then partakes of what is just, it would so far, by being confessed to be beautiful, exhibit a reasoning not discordant.
Athen.
But if we should agree that a suffering is just, but not beautiful, the just and the beautiful would be discord­ ant through things that are just being said to be the least beautiful.
Clin.
How have you said this ?
Athen.
It is not difficult to understand.
For the laws which have been laid down a little before, would seem to pro­ claim what is perfectly the contrary to our present assertions.
Clin.
To what assertions ?
Athen.
We surely laid it down, that he, who committed sacrilege, would justly die, and he too, who is hostile to well­ established laws;
and, as we were about to lay down many other laws of this kind, we stopped short, on perceiving that these sufferings were infinite in multitude and magnitude;
and that they were of all sufferings the most just, and of all the least beautiful.
Will not then things just and beautiful appear in this manner at one time to be the same, and at another to be the most opposite ?
Clin.
There is a danger of it.
Athen.
By the multitude, then, things beautiful and just, which are so discordant 1 on these kind of points,1 are ad­ dressed as things separate.
Clin.
It appears so, guest.
Athen.
Let us then, Clinias, view again our notions, as to how the accordance 2 exists on these very points.
CUn.
Of what accordance, and with what,2 are you speaking ?
Athen.
I think I have clearly stated in the previous dis­ course;
3but if not before, suppose me saying it now.
Athen.
That all wicked persons are in all things wicked involuntarily ;
4 and that as this is the case, it is necessary for this inference to follow in order.
Clin.
What (inference) do you mean ?
Athen.
That the unjust man is wicked;
and that the wicked man is such involuntarily.
Now there is no reason for a volun­ tary act to be ever done in an involuntary manner.
He therefore, whoever acts unjustly, will appear to act so in an involuntary manner to him, who considers injustice to be an involuntary act.
And this too must now be acknowledged by me.
For I have agreed, that all men act unjustly involuntarily;
and though some one, for the sake of contention or ambition, may say, that unjust men are involuntarily unjust, but yet many act unjustly voluntarily, the other is my assertion, and not this.
In what way then should I agree with my own assertions, should ye, Clinias and Megillus, thus interrogate me—If these things are so, what would you, 0 guest, advise us respecting the legislation for the city of the Magnesians ?
To legislate for them, or not ? 5
How not ?
I shall say.
5
Will you then separ- arate injuries into the involuntary and voluntary?
And shall we assign greater punishments for voluntary offences and injuries, and less (for the contrary)?
1
Or equal for all, since injuries are not voluntary at all?
Clin.
You speak properly, 0 guest.
But how shall we make use of what has now been said ?
Athen.
You have inquired correctly.
Let us in the first place use them for this.
Clin. For what?[6.]
Athen.
Let us call to mind that we stated correctly, that there is a great confusion and dissonance amongst our­ selves respecting things just.
Laying hold then of this, let us ask ourselves again 2 (what shall we say).
2
Since we have nei­ ther found a way clearly out of the doubt relating to these mat­ ters, nor defined how those things differ from each other, which in all states, and by all legislators, that have ever existed, are laid down as forming two kinds of injuries, one voluntary, and the other involuntary, 3are they to be legally established3 in this way likewise ?4 and shall the language, which has been expressed by us, as if it had been spoken by some god, be dis­ missed, after having said only thus much, and without assign­ ing any reason, that it has spoken correctly ;
shall it in some manner lay down a counter-law ?
This may not be.5
But it is somehow necessary, before we lay down laws, to show these two things as existing, and (having) another6 difference be­ tween them, in order that when any one assigns a punishment for either, every one 7 may follow what is said,7 and be able to judge, whether it is established in a becoming manner, or not.
Clin.
You appear to us, 0 guest, to speak well.
For it is necessary to do one of two things, either to say that all unjust actions are not involuntary, or to show, 1 by first defining,1 that this has been stated correctly.
Athen.
Of these two things one I can by no means en­ dure that it takes place,2 (I mean) 3the denying that the per­ son, who thinks so, has the truth on his side ;
3 for this would be neither according to law4 nor holy.
But in what manner these are two, if they do not differ by the involuntary and vo­ luntary, but by something else perchance, I must endeavour by some means to show.
Clin.
By all means, 0 guest:
for it is not possible for us to understand this at least otherwise.
Athen.
Be it so.
Come then, (say,) does not, as it seems, much damage take place amongst citizens in their communi­ cations and intercourse with each other, and yet the voluntary and the involuntary abound in these transactions ?
Athen.
Let not however any one imagine, after laying down that all damage is an injury, that in this way the injuries exist in them of a double kind, partly voluntary, and partly involun­ tary.
For the involuntary damage done by all men is nei­ ther in number, nor in magnitude, less than the voluntary.
But consider 5whether I am saying any thing, when I say what I am about to say,5 or nothing at all.
For I do not say, Clinias and Megillus, that if some one hurts another, 6 not willingly, but unwillingly,6 he does an injury to a person un­ willing (to be injured).
And in this way I will lay down the law, by making legally this an involuntary injury;
nor will I consider a damage of this kind as an injury at all, whether it be of a greater or less magnitude.
And we shall frequently say that through 1 assistance taking place not correctly, he, who is the cause of the assistance, does an injury, 2 at least if my opinion is the better.
2
For, my friends, if any one gives one any thing, or, on the contrary, takes it away, it is not meet to call such an action thus simply just or unjust ;
but whether a person does to another in any thing a benefit or harm, while making use of (a correct)3 habit, and a just manner, to this ought the legislator to look;
4 and [direct his attention]4 to (these) two things, injustice and detriment;
and 5by making, what has been damaged, uninjured5 as much as is possible, by the law, and by restoring, what has been lost, and raising up again, what has fallen by means of any one, 6 and making, what has been wounded, whole, and, what has been killed, expiated with money,G let him ever endeavour to convert, in the case of the doers and sufferers, by means of his laws, each of the injuries from a state of variance to that of friendship.
Clin.
This at least is well (said).
Athen.
Unjust damages therefore and gains, if any one can by injuring a person cause 7 to be a gain to himself,7 he ought to cure, such at least as are to be cured, as being diseases in the soul;
but the question of the cure of injustice it is meet to say inclines in this way.
Clin.
In what ?A then.
That what injury soever a person may do, be it great or little, the law may instruct, and altogether compel him, either not to dare again at any time to do such an act voluntarily, or far less frequently, in consequence 1 of the punish­ ment for the injury.
This should any one accomplish, either by works or words, or by pleasure or pains, or by honours or dishonours, and by fines of money or gifts, or altogether by any means whatever, (so that)2 a person may hate injustice, and love, or at least not hate, the nature of justice, this is the very business of laws the most beautiful.
But, upon the persons, whom the legislator perceives to be incurable on these points, he shall impose a punishment and law,3 knowing that to all such as these it is better even for themselves not to live any longer, and that they will doubly benefit the rest, when freed from life, by being an example to others to do no wrong, and by causing the state to be devoid of bad men.
In this way there is a necessity for the legislator to assign death, as the pun­ isher of delinquencies of this kind,4 but by no means otherwise.
Clin.
This appears to have been spoken by you with great moderation ;
but we would hear still more gladly this spoken, namely, the difference between injustice and detriment, 5 and how the question of what is voluntary and involuntary is in these cases variously represented.
5[7.]
Athen.
I must endeavour therefore to do and say as you request me.
For it is evident that, respecting the soul, you 6 say to, and hear from, each other;
thus much, that one property of nature resides in it, whether as an accident or part, namely, anger,1 a thing naturally hard to contest with and to overcome, and which overturns many things by its irrational violence.
Athen.
And we speak moreover of pleasure as not being the same as anger;
and we say that it possesses, from a con­ trary influence, a power through persuasion, united to a vio­ lent deception, to do whatever the will pleases.
CUn.
And very much so.
Athen.
He too who says that ignorance is a third cause of crimes, will not state a falsehood.
Now the legislator, who makes a twofold division, would act the better by considering one kind as simple, and the cause of light offences;
but the other twofold, when any one is in a state of non-instruction, not only by being afflicted with ignorance, but by an opinion of wisdom, as if he knew perfectly what he does not know at all;
and laying down things of this kind, when followed by power and strength, as the causes of crimes mighty and un­ musical ;
2 but when followed by imbecility, as are the crimes of children and old men, he will consider them (all) as crimes, and will ordain laws against those who commit them;
(laws), how­ ever, the mildest of all, and near to the greatest pardon.
Clin.
You speak what is reasonable.
Athen.
Now nearly all of us say, that one of us is superior to pleasure and anger, and another inferior.
And such is the case.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
But we have never heard even, that one of us is superior to ignorance, and another Inferior,Clin.
Most true.
Athen.
But we say that all these allure to their will a per­ son, who is frequently drawn at the same time to things opposite.
Clin.
Very often indeed.
Athen.
Now I will define to you clearly the just and the unjust, of which I was speaking, with no variety of colouring.
For I denominate injustice to be wholly the tyranny over the soul through anger, and fear, and pleasure, and pain, and envy, and desires, whether it does, or does not, harm any one.
But the opinion of what is the best, by whatever way a state or any individuals may think it will exist, 2should it (the opinion,) by having a power in the soul, arrange in order the whole man, even though it stumbles in some matter, we must say that, what is done in this way, is just entirely, and (that too) which is under a rule of this kind of each, and of men through the whole of life best;
2 but that a damage of this kind is thought by the multitude to be an involuntary injustice.
However, our discourse at present is not a harsh contest about names.
But since there have been pointed out three kinds of delin­ quencies,3 let us, in the first place, still more diligently recall them to our memory.
Of pain then, which we denominate anger and fear, there is one kind.
CUn.
Entirely so.
Athen.
But of pleasure and desires there is a second kind;
another the third, of hopes, and 4 a desire of true opinion about that which is the best.
4
Now by this third being di­ vided into two parts, five kinds will be produced, 5 as we have just now stated,5 for which we must lay down five laws, dif­ fering from each other in two genera.
Clin.
What are these ?
A then.
One, when a deed is done constantly with violence and accordant 1 actions;
and the other, when it takes place secretly in darkness and with a fraud;
but sometimes the act is done with both of these, against which there will be laws the most severe, if they possess their proper character.
CUn.
This is reasonable.[8.]
Athen.
But let us after this proceed to the point, from which we have digressed, and finish the laying down of laws.
Now the subjects laid down by us were respecting those, who rob the gods, and are traitors to their country, and who corrupt the laws for the purpose of dissolving the existing polity.
Of these some one may perhaps commit an act, when mad, or affect­ ed with a disease, or a very great age, or childishness, 2 differ­ ing not at all from things of this kind.
2
Of which acts should any become manifest to the judges selected on each occasion, either by the party himself informing, or a person making an excuse in behalf of the perpetrator, and he be decreed, when in this state, to have acted contrary to the law, let him pay simply for the damage, whatever he may have done;
and let him be exempt from other punishments, unless by having killed any one his hands are not clean from murder;
for in this case let him depart to another country, and dwell there in exile during a year ;
but if he returns before the time prescribed by the law, or puts his foot on the whole3 of his native land, let him be imprisoned by the guardians of the laws for two years in the public gaol, and then released from bonds.
Since then we have begun with murder, let us endeavour to lay down laws completely for every kind of it.
And, in the first place, let us speak of that done with violence and in­ voluntarily.
If then any one in a contest, and at the public games, shall involuntarily kill a friend, either on the instant, or some time after from the blows inflicted ;
or, in like man­ ner, during a war, or in warlike exercises, of which the rulers have enjoined the practice, with naked bodies, or with any weapons, in imitation of warlike doings, let him be purified 1 according to the law brought from Delphi 2 touching these matters, and let him be held to be pure.
3
And in the case of physicians, should any person, when attended upon by them, die, without their willing it, let every one3 be held to be pure by the law.
But if any one with his own hand unwill­ ingly slays another, whether with his own naked body, or with an instrument or dart, or by administering drink or food, or by the hurling of fire, or a tempest,4 or the privation of breath, whether he does this with his own body, or through the means of other bodies, let him be considered altogether a slayer with his own hand, and suffer punishments such as these.
If he kills the slave (of another),5 thinking that he had done for 6 his own, let him either cause the master of the dead (slave) to be without loss or hurt, or be fined double the value of such slave;
and let the judges make an inquiry into the value, and let the homicide make use of greater and more purifications than those, who kill a person in gymnastic ex­ ercises ;
and in such cases let the holy interpreters, whom the god ordains, decide without an appeal.
1
But if any one kills his own slave, let him, after undergoing a purification, be re­ leased according to law from (the stain of) murder.
But if any one kills involuntarily a free-born person, let him be purified with the same purifications as him, who has killed a slave.
And let him not dishonour 2 some of so-called2 old stories of the ancients.
For it is said, that a person, who had lived with the feelings of a free-man, having been violently put to death, was, when recently dead, angry with his mur­ derer;
and being filled 3with fear and terror3 likewise through his violent suffering, and beholding the person, who slew him, passing the time in his own seats, [familiar haunts,] 4 terrified him, and, being disturbed himself, disturb­ ed with all his might the murderer and his doings, by having Memory 5 as an ally.
On this account, it is requisite for the doer to withdraw himself from the sufferer through all the seasons of the year, and to cause a void in all his own places through the whole of his native land.
But if the party de­ ceased is a stranger, let (the homicide) be debarred the coun­ try of the stranger for the same period.
And if any one willingly obeys this law, let him, who is the nearest relative of the deceased, be the examiner into all that has taken place and grant a pardon;
6 and by keeping quiet, he would be altogether moderate towards him.
6
But if a person does not obey, and, in the first place, being still unpurified, dares to go to the temples, and to sacrifice ;
and, further, is not will­ ing to be an exile, and to complete the stated time;
let the nearest relative of the deceased prosecute the murderer on a charge of blood, and let his punishment be doubled when found guilty.
But if the nearest relative shall not prosecute 1 [for the act of suffering],1 let any one, since the pollution has come round to the relative, 2 through the sufferer turning on himself the suffering,2 prosecute the relative and compel him by law to be absent from his country for five years.
But if a stranger involuntarily kills a stranger amongst those in the city, let whosoever is willing prosecute him on the same laws;
but if a foreign settler (kills a stranger), let him be exiled for one year;
but if he be altogether a stranger, in addition to the purification, let him, if he shall have killed a stranger, or a foreign settler, or a citizen, be banished for his whole life from the country which has the supreme power over these3 laws, and if he returns contrary to the law, let the guar­ dians of the laws punish him with death;
and if he has any property, let them give it to the nearest relative of the deceased.
But if he returns involuntarily by sea, and has been cast out on the coast by a storm, 4 let him fix a tent (on the shore), so that his feet may touch (the water),4 and watch for an opportunity of sailing;
but, if he is brought on land forcibly by any one, 1 let the magistrate, who of those in the city first meets him,1 release him 2 and send him safe from harm to the country over the borders.
2
But if any one with his own hand kills a free-man, and what is done is done through passion, it is meet, in the first place, to make a two­ fold distinction in a thing of this kind.
For a thing is done in a passion by those who, on a sudden, and without intend­ ing to kill, destroy by blows, or such other means, a person, 3on the instant that an impulse arises, and when repentance is close upon the deed ;
3 and (a deed is done) in a passion by those too, who, having been befouled by words or deeds of dis­ honour, pursue with revenge and subsequently kill a person, intending to murder, and for the deed there is no repentance.
We must therefore, as it seems, put down two kinds of murder, and both of them as arising nearly from passion, and they may be said most justly to be between the voluntary and the in­ voluntary.
4 Each, however, is only a likeness.
4 For, he who stores up his anger, and does not immediately (and) 5 suddenly, but with malice prepense 6 after a time revenge himself, is like to the voluntary ;
but he, who, without storing up8 his anger, does on the instant [immediately]9 gratify his passion, without premeditation, is like to the involuntary.
He is not, however, altogether involuntary, but the likeness of the in­ voluntary.
On this account, the murders committed in anger are difficult to define, whether one ought to lay down laws for them, as being voluntary, or some of them involuntary.
The best and the truest method therefore is to put both down as likenesses ;
and to divide them apart from each other, by their being done with malice prepense and without premeditation ;
and to lay down by law severer punishments for those, who kill in anger, and with malice prepense ;
but milder for those without premeditation and on the sudden.
For that, which is like a greater evil, should be punished more severely;
but that, which is like a less one, less severely.
Let it then be thus established by our laws.
Clin.
By all means.[9.]
Athen.
Let us then return again to the subject and say, that if any one with his own hand kills a free-man, but if the deed, when done, took place without premeditation, in a moment of anger, let him in other respects suffer, as it is proper for the party to suffer, who has killed a person, not in a passion;
but let him of necessity be an exile for two years, and thus punish his passion.
But he, who in a passion, but with malice prepense, commits a murder, let him (suffer) in other respects as the former does ;
but let him be an exile for three years, as the other is for two, and be punished for the greatness of his passion by a longer time.
And let this be held 1 universally respecting these matters.
1
It is difficult however to give laws on such matters with accuracy.
For sometimes of these two murders, the one, which is held by the law to be the more atrocious, is the milder;
and that, which is the milder, would be the more atrocious, 2 according as the murder is committed in a more savage or a more gentle manner.
2
But for the most part the deeds take place according to what has been mentioned already.
Of all these matters, therefore, it is meet for the guardians of the laws to have the cognizance ;
and, when the period of the exile shall have expired3 to each offender, to send twelve judges to the borders of the country, (so that) 1 after having examined still more clearly the conduct of the exiles during that period, they may be the judges of the pity (to be shown) and of their reception ;
and let the exiles acquiesce in the decisions of such magistrates.
And if, after having returned from exile, any one of them shall, over­ come by passion, commit again the very same offence, let him be exiled and never return again ;
and if he returns, he shall suffer in the same way as a stranger for returning from exile.
And let him, who kills his own slave, undergo a purifica­ tion.
But if, in a passion, he kills the slave of another, let him pay to the master double the value of the lass.
But whoever of all the homicides does not obey the law, but, while he is uncleansed, defiles (by his presence) the place of public meeting, and of contests, and other sacred places, whoever is willing may bring to trial the relative of the deceased, who has neglected (his duty), and the murderer likewise, and compel him to pay a double fine, and 2 to do some of the other doings ;
2 3and let the (accusing) party carry off the payment according to the law.
3
If a slave kills his master in a passion, let the kin­ dred of the deceased use the murderer in whatever manner they please,4 and be clean (of the acts), so long as they do not by any means 5preserve the life5 (of the slave).
6But if a slave kills (not his own master, but) some other free-man, in a passion,6 7let the owners give up the slave7 to the relatives of the deceased, and let them of necessity put him to death in whatever manner they please.
If a father or a mother in a passion kills their son or daughter by blows, or any other violent manner-events that happen but rarely-let them be purified after the same manner as other homicides, and be exiled for three years;
and on their return from exile, let the husband be divorced from the wife, and the wife from the husband, and let them never afterwards beget children to­ gether, nor be a fellow-dweller with those, whom they have deprived of a child or brother, nor have a share with them in sacred rites.
But he, who has acted impiously in these mat­ ters, and does not obey the laws, let him be brought to trial for impiety by any one who is willing.
If a husband kills his wife in a passion, or a wife does the same thing in a similar manner to her husband, they shall undergo the same purifi­ cations, and complete an exile for three years;
and let not the party, who has so acted, on his return, have a share with their children in sacred rites, nor ever eat at the same table with them.
And let the father or the child, who disobeys the law, be brought to trial for impiety by any one who is willing.
If a brother kills either a brother or a sister, or a sister (kills) a brother or a sister in a passion, let the matters, relating to purifications and exiles, be stated as necessary to take place in the same manner, 'as have been stated in the case of parents and children ;
1 2 and (on their return from exile), 2 let not any one3 be a fellow-dweller or a sharer in sacred rites with those, whom a person 4 has deprived, brothers of brothers, and fathers of children.
And if any one disobeys the law, he would rightly with justiceS be amenable to the before-mentioned law, relating to impiety on these points.
But should any one in the case of his ,parents be so powerless over his passion, as in the madness of anger to dare to murder one of his parents, if the deceased shall, before he expired, have voluntarily ab­ solved the perpetrator of the murder, let him be purified as they are, who commit murder involuntarily, 1 and performing the other things that they do, let him be considered as pure;
but if (the deceased shall) not have absolved him, let the party who has done a deed of this kind be amenable to many laws.
For he will be amenable to the extreme punishments for an assault, and, in like manner, for impiety and for the robbery of what is holy, because he has robbed his parent of his life ;
so that, if it were possible for the same man to die oftentimes,2 it would be most just for a person, who had in a passion com­ mitted an act of parricide or matricide, to meet with many deaths.
For in the case of him, whom no law will permit, even when defending himself and about to be made an end of by his parents, to destroy his father or mother, who have brought his nature to the light, and whom (the legislator) shall order3 to endure all things rather than do a deed of this kind, how would it be fitting for such a person to meet with punishment legally in any other way?
Let death then be laid down as the punishment for him, who in a passion kills either his father or mother.
But if a brother shall in his own defence, during a fight occurring in a sedition or in any other similar manner, kill a brother, while warding off the party, who first had recourse to his hands,4 let him be held clear in the same manner, as he who kills an enemy;
and similarly, if a citizen (kills) a citizen, or a stranger a stranger;
and if a citizen in defending himself kills a stranger, or a stranger a citizen, let him in the same way be held to be clear;
and si­ milarly if a slave (kills) a slave.
But if a slave, in his own defence, kills a free-man, let him be amenable to the same laws as him, who kills his father.
And what has been stated respecting the absolution from murder by a father, let the very same thing take place respecting every absolution in matters of this kind;
that if any person of his own accord gives an absolution to any one for such an act, let the purifi­ cations take place for the perpetrator, as if the murder had been involuntary, and let one year be the term of absence from the country according to law.
And thus let the matters re­ lating to murders, done with violence and involuntarily and in a passion, be held to have been detailed in moderation.
But as regards those relating to such as are voluntary and perpe­ trated with every kind of injustice, respecting these and what are done with malice prepense, through yielding to pleasure and desires and envy, it is to be spoken of subsequently.
Clin.
You speak correctly.[10. ] Athen. 1
Let us then again speak to the utmost of our power in the first place upon these points, how many they are.
1
Now the greatest is desire, having a mastery over a soul rendered savage by regrets.
2
And this exists for the most part there, where there happens to be the greatest and most vehement wish for wealth on the part of the many, and a power that is producing an infinite love for the pos­ session of property insatiable and boundless, by means of a natural disposition and a wretched want of education, 5 of which the cause is that wealth is praised improperly by report amongst both the Greeks and Barbarians.
5
For by placing as the first of good things that, which is the third, they do (by this opinion) 1 injure both those after them and themselves.
2
For that the truth respecting wealth be told in all states is of all things the most beautiful and the best ;
2 (namely,) that it exists for the sake of the body, but the body for the sake of the soul.
3
Of the good things then existing, for the sake of which wealth naturally exists, it would be the third after the virtue of the body and souP
This reason­ ing then will be to us4 a teacher, that it is not meet for him, who would be happy, to seek to be wealthy (by any means),5 but [to be wealthy] 6 in a just and temperate manner.
For7 thus murders, which require to be purified by murders,8 would not take place in cities.
But now, as we stated at the begin­ ning of the discussion, this is one and the greatest thing, which causes the greatest punishments of voluntary murder.
The second is the habit of an ambitious soul, producing envy, a fellow-dweller the most disagreeable to him who possesses it,9 and secondly,10 to the best of those in the state.
But the third is a cowardly and unjust fear, which has caused many mur­ ders, when acts are being done or have been done by a per­ son, which he does not wish to be conscious to himself of their taking place, or of having taken place.
They therefore take off by death the informers of such acts, if they cannot do it by any other means.
About all these matters then let this be held to be said as a prelude;
and in addition to this, the story, which many of those engaged seriously in the Mysteries have heard touching these subjects, and strongly believe, that of such persons there is in Hades a punishment;
and that it is neces­ sary for them to come back hither to suffer punishment accord­ in- to nature, namely, of suffering from another what a person had done himself, and with such a fate to finish his then life.
For him therefore, who from this prelude is persuaded, and fears altogether such a punishment, there is no need to hymn a law on this point, but for him, who is not persuaded, let this law be expressed in writing.[11.]
Whosoever shall designedly and unjustly kill with his own hand any one soever of his tribes-men, let him, in the first place, be debarred from legal rights, nor let him pollute the temples, or the place of public meeting, or the ports, or any other general assembly, whether any person forbids the perpetrator or not.
For the Jaw forbids him ;
and it is ever seen and will be seen forbidding him in behalf of the whole state.
But the relative of the deceased as far as a cousin,' on the male or female side, who does not, when requisite, prose­ cute, or forbid him to be debarred (from those things),2 shall first of all take upon himself the pollution, and the hatred of the gods, 3 as the imprecation by the law provokes the report;
;
3 and secondly, let him be amenable to any, who is willing to avenge the dead;
and let him, who is willing, avenge, after performing every thing respecting the observation of washings4 for such occasions, and of such other acts as the deity has enjoined as legal in cases of this kind ;
and after making the proclamation let him go and compel the perpe­ trator to suffer the vengeance of justice according to law.
But that these things ought to take place through certain prayers and sacrifices to certain deities, who have a care of such mat­ ters, so that murders may not take place in cities, it is easy for a legislator to show.
But who are the deities, and what would be the manner of introducing such suits most correctly as regards the divine power, let the guardians of the laws, to­ gether with the (holy) interpreters, and the prophets, and the god, lay down by law, and introduce these suits.
But let the judges of these matters be the same as those, to whom has been given the power of deciding upon sacrilege.
Let him too, who is convicted, pay the penalty of death, and 1 let him not be buried in the country of the murdered person,1 on account of his shameless conduct, in addition to the act of impiety.
But if he goes away, being unwilling to stand a trial, let him suffer a perpetual exile.
2
And if any one of these sets his foot upon the land of the murdered party,2 let whatever relation or even citizen, who first meets him, kill him with impunity, or, placing him in bonds, hand him over to the magistrates, who decide upon the suit, to put him to death.
3
But let him, who urges (the suit), require bail at the same time from him, against whom he is urging it;
3 and 4 let the latter produce three persons, whom the magistrate ap­ pointed for such matters shall decide to be in sufficient credit,4 who shall engage to produce (the accused) at the trial;
but if the latter either will not or cannot get bail, let the magistrate take and put him in prison, and produce him at the trial of the suit.
If a person shall not with his own hand (perpe­ trate), I but suggest to another, a murder, and by his willing and plotting cause the murder to take place,1 and dwell in a city, having been the instigator of, and not pure in his soul from, the murder, 2 let there be to him in the same manner, with the exception of the bail, a trial and verdict on these matters ;
2 and, if convicted, let it be lawful for him to have the family3 burial-place ;
but let other things take place in the same manner to him, as to the party previously mentioned ;
and let the same things take place in the case of strangers to­ wards strangers, and citizens and strangers towards each other, and of slaves towards slaves, with respect to a murder done by a person's own hand and instigation, with the exception of the bail ;
but this let the murderers with their own hands be required to procure, as has been stated;
4 and let the party who brings forward the suit, require bail of them likewise.
4
But if a slave voluntarily murders a free-man, whether with his own hand or through a plotting, and there is a verdict against him, let the public executioner lead him to the tomb of the deceased, or5 to a place, where he may see the tomb, and after scourging him with as many stripes as the plaintiff shall order, put the murderer, if he survives the whipping, to death.
But if any one kills a slave, who has done no wrong, through the fear of his disclosing deeds disgraceful and wicked, or for any similar reason, 6 let him, as if he underwent the punish­ ment of murder for having killed a citizen, undergo similarly and with the same forms a punishment on account of the slave, who had thus perished.,[12.]
But if cases occur, for which it is a thing of dread and by no means agreeable to legislate, and impossible on the other hand1 not to legislate, (relating to) the murder of rela­ tions by a person's own hand or plotting, and done willingly and wickedly in every way—which take place for the most part in states 2 badly administered and nurtured,2 and which will somehow take place in a country where no one would expect it-it is requisite to mention again, what has been stated a little before, should perchance some one, on hearing us, be enabled more willingly on this account to abstain from murders the most unholy in every way.
For a fable, or a story, or whatever else it is meet to call it, has been clearly told by priests of old, that 3Justice, the avenger and inspector of kindred blood, makes use of the law, which we have j ust now mentioned ;
and has ordained that he, who has done any such act, shall necessarily suffer what he has done ;
3 (so that) 4 if any one has ever murdered his father, he has at some time suffered 5 the very same fate by the daring and violence of his own children ;
5 and if he has (murdered) his mother, he has in after times become necessarily 6 a partaker in a feminine na- ture,6 and having become so, has departed from life at the hands of his offspring.
For of a common blood defiled there is no other cleansing, nor is the pollution wont to be washed out, before the life, that has done (wrong), shall pay like blood for like blood, and appease and put to sleep the anger of all the kindred.
It is requisite then for a person to be restrained on these points, through the fear of such punishments from the gods.
But if so wretched a calamity should lay hold of any one, as that he should dare designedly and willingly to separate the soul of his father or mother, or brethren or children, from the body, the law of the mortal lawgiver legislates respecting matters of this kind in this way, that there is to be a proclam­ ation 1 respecting a debarring from all rights,1 and the same bail, as mentioned above;
and if any one is convicted of a murder of this kind, 2 [for having killed any one of those,] 2 let the ministers of the judges and the magistrates put him to death, and cast him out of the city naked to an appointed place, where three roads meet;
and let all the magistrates, in behalf of the whole state, 3 carry each a stone and hurl it at'the head of the dead body,3 and thus make an expiation for the whole state;
and afterwards carry the corpse to the boundaries of the country, and cast it out there unburied, according to law.
But what ought he to suffer, who murders his nearest and so- called dearest friend ?
I mean, he who kills himself, and by violence deprives himself of his share of fate, being compelled neither by a verdict of the city ordering it, nor by a very painful (and)4 unavoidable misfortune falling upon him, nor by sharing in a thing of shame, without a resource, and not to be lived through, and who by his indolence and 5 the cowardice of unmanliness5 imposes upon himself an unjust punish­ ment.
To such a person a god knows what ought to take place on other points, and relating to purification and burial;
about which it is necessary for the nearest relatives to inquire of the (holy) interpreters, and at the same time the laws re­ lating to them, and to do according to the orders given by them;
but let the tombs of those, who have perished thus, be in the first place by themselves, and with no one buried in them ;
next, let them be in the twelve boundaries of the divisions, which are uncultivated and without a name ;
and bury them1 without honour, nor mark their tombs with any pillars or names.
But if a beast of burden or any other animal shall kill any person, except such as may do so in some public contest, let the rela­ tions prosecute the causer of the death:
and let the Land- Stewards, upon whom and how many the relative shall im­ pose the task, decide upon the matter;
and let them destroy the condemned animal, and cast it2 beyond the borders.
If any lifeless thing deprives a man of life, except lightning, or any other such-like bolt sent from a god, but of all the rest that kill a person, by either the person falling upon it, or it falling upon the person, let the nearest of kin appoint the nearest neighbour to be a judge for him, and let him make an expiation both for himself and the whole of his kindred;
but drive the thing condemned beyond the borders of the country, as has been stated in the case of the living kind.
If any one is found dead, and the murderer is not known, and is not to be discovered by parties searching not carelessly, let there be proclamations, as in other cases;
and let the heir-at-law3 make a proclamation against the perpetrator of the murder, and state in the Market-place that the person, who has murdered so and so, is not, as being guilty of murder, to set his foot upon any sacred place, or in the whole of the country 1 of the party suffering,1 as he shall die, should he be found and known, and shall be cast out unburied, beyond 2the country of the sufferer.
2
Let this one law then be laid down by us as decisive on the subject of murder.
And thus (be it said) up to this point about matters of this kind.
But for killing whom,3 and on what conditions, a person would be properly pure, let this be laid down.
If any one catches a thief, entering his house by night, for the purpose of stealing his property, and kills him, let him be pure.
In like manner, let him be pure, who kills a cloak-stripper4 in his own defence.
And if any one commits a rape upon a free-born woman or a boy, let him be put to death with impunity, either by the party treated with insult and violence, or by the father, or brothers, or sons of the party.
And if a man comes upon his wedded wife, while being ravished, and kills the party using violence, let him be pure by the law.
And if any one, while assisting his father, when doing nothing 5unlawful and un­ holy,5 or his mother, or children, or brothers, or joint-parent of his children, shall kill a person, let him be in every re­ spect pure.[13.]
Let these then be the laws laid down relating to the nurture and education of a living soul, with which if it meets it may live;
but not meeting, the reverse;
and relating also to violent deaths, what punishments there ought to be for them.
Mention too has been made of the nurture and education of bodies ;
and what is close upon those subjects, namely, actions done with violence by persons to each other, both voluntary and involuntary, we must define according to our power, what they are, and how many, and meeting with what punishment 1 they would each of them possess what is suited to them.
1
For these, it appears, would be properly laid down as laws after those.
Now the person of the least mark amongst those, who have turned themselves to law, would rank wounds, and mu­ tilations from wounds, as secondary to murders.
Wounds then are to be divided in the same manner as murders have been divided.
For some are involuntary, others done in a passion, some through fear;
but such as take place from design are called 3 voluntary.
Now about all such something of this kind must be premised ;
that it is necessary to lay down laws for mankind, and for them to live according to law, or for them to differ not at all from animals the most savage in every respect.
And the cause of this is, that the disposition of not a single man is natur­ ally sufficient to know what is conducive to a polity amongst men ;
and, when it does know, to be always able to do and wish what is the best.
For first it is difficult to know that not private but public interests must necessarily be the object of the true science of polities-for a common interest binds states, but a private one tears them asunder-and that it conduces to both public and private interests, when the public are well estab­ lished rather than when the private are so.
Secondly, that, although a person should obtain sufficiently from art the know­ ledge that such things are so naturally, yet should he after this possess power in the state, without being brought to book,4 and hold it in his own hands entirely, he would never be able to re­ main in this opinion, and continue to live, while nourishing the public interest in a state as the leading one, and the private as following the public ;
but his mortal nature will ever urge him on to the wish to possess more, and to his own individual well­ doing.
(For) through irrationally avoiding pain, and pursu­ ing pleasure, it will set both of these before what is more just and excellent;
and, by producing a darkness in itself, it will at length fill both itself and the whole state with every ill.
Since should any man, born with a divine destiny, be 1 naturally competent to comprehend1 this,2 he would require no laws for the government of himself.
For there is no law or order superior to science;
nor is it lawful for intellect to be the minister, and the slave of any thing, but the ruler of all, if it is thus3 true and really free by nature.
But now (it is not so);
4 for it does not exist any where and in any manner, ex­ cept to a small extent.
On this account then we must choose the second in rank, namely, order and law ;
5 which the one for the most part sees and beholds, but the other is entirely unable.
5
Thus much then has been stated for the sake of these matters ;
and let us now ordain what he ought to suffer (in person), or pay (in purse), who wounds or otherwise6 injures another.
7
For it is easy for every one upon every point to take up cor­ rectly of a party having wounded what thing, or what per­ son, or in what manner, or whether are you speaking;
7 for there are numberless things of this kind and very different from each other.
It is therefore impossible to commit to courts of justice, to decide upon all these matters, or not one.
For it is necessary to commit in the case of all to decide upon this one point, whether each of these acts have taken place or not;
but on the other hand not at all to commit to them, (to decide) upon this point, what the party, who has done any of these injuries, ought to be fined (in purse), and suffer (in person) ;
and yet (for the law-giver 1) himself to lay down laws upon all questions, small and great, is nearly impossible.
CUn.
What then is the inference consequent upon this ?
Athen.
It is this ;
that some matters should be committed to courts of justice, and others not, but be 2left to (the legis­ lator) himself.
CUn.
What then are the matters, which are to be laid down by law, and what those to be committed to courts of justice ?[14.]
Athen.
After the preceding, it would be the most correct to say this ;
that, in a state, where the courts of justice are depraved and dumb, and concealing 3 their opinions pass sentence in private ;
and, what is still more dreadful than this, when, not in silence, but full of noise, as in a theatre, they praise and blame with an uproar each of the orators in turn ;
then is a grievous calamity wont indeed to occur to the whole state.
It is not then a fortunate circumstance for a person to be laid hold of by some necessity to legislate for courts of justice of this kind;
nevertheless, when he is laid hold of by a necessity, 4 he must commit to them to order fines only relating to matters of the slightest kind, but he must him­ self distinctly lay down those relating to the most numerous,4 5 if he would ever legislate correctly 6 for such a kind of polity.
5
But in a state, where courts of justice are established as correctly as possible, and those, who are about to judge, are brought up well and undergo a scrutiny with all accuracy, there it is right and it will be well to commit to such judges to decide upon most points relating to those who are found guilty, as to what they are to suffer (in person), or to pay (in purse).
Against us then there will be no cause of complaint for our not laying down laws relating to matters the greatest and most numerous, into which judges, who have been educated in the meanest manner, would be able to look, and to adapt to each offence a punishment suited to the suffering and act.
But since we are of opinion, that those, for whom we are laying down laws, will be not the least clever of judges in such matters, we must commit to their decision the greatest number of cases.
However, as we have often said and done during the previous laying down of the laws, that by giving an outline and types of punishments, we have presented to judges patterns for their never going beyond the line of justice ;
and, as this was then correctly done, so must we now do likewise the very same thing, while return­ ing again to the laws.
Let then the outline1 (of the laws) re­ lating to wounds be thus laid down.
If any one, having both the intention and wish to kill a friend, except it be those whom the law ordains, shall wound, but is unable to kill him, towards the party with such intentions, so inflicting a wound, it is not meet to feel a pity nor to pay a regard to him, otherwise than by compelling him to undergo the punishment of murder, as if he had actually killed his friend ;
2 and, by doing reverence to his Fortune, not bad in every respect, and his Daemon likewise, who, pitying both him and the wounded party, became to both an averter of evil-to one, in the wound not being incurable, 3 and to the other, in the accident and calamity being exposed to a curse3—it is meet to give thanks to this Dæmon ;
and, by not opposing him, to take away the punishment of death from the party inflicting the wound, but for a removal to take place to him during life to a neighbouring state, enjoying there his property ;
but if he has inflicted any loss upon the wound­ ed person, let him pay for the loss ;
and let the court of jus­ tice, that tried the cause, fix the sum;
1 and let those, who would have decided about the murder, had the party died from the blow of the wound,2 be the judges.
1
If a child designedly wounds his parent, or a slave his mas­ ter, the punishment shall be death.
And if a brother wounds in like manner a brother or sister, or a sister a sister or bro­ ther 3 and there is a verdict of wounding by design, let the punishment be death.
But if a woman wounds her husband with the design of killing him, or (in like manner4) a husband his wife, let (each) undergo a perpetual exile ;
and, if their sons or daughters are at that time but children, let guardians man­ age their property, and take care of the children, as being orphans ;
but if they are adults, let it not be a compulsory act for the exiled parent to be suported by their offspring, but let there be a permission to take possession of the estate.
But whosoever happens to be childless, when falling into calam­ ities of this kind, let his kindred, as far as cousins, both on the male and female side, come together, and appoint for this family, being one of the five thousand and forty in the state, an heir, after consulting with the guardians o the laws (and) considering the matter 5in this manner and reasoning that no house out of the five thousand and forty is the property of its inhabitant, or of all his kindred, but of the state, considered in a public and private view, and that it is requisite for the state to possess its own houses, as holy and as happy as is possible.
When therefore any house has become at the same time unhappy and unholy, so that its possessor has left no children in it, and 6being in youth and married has died childless,6 through his having been convicted of vo­ luntary murder, or some other crime against the gods or his fellow-citizens—1 the punishment for which has been distinctly laid down by the law to be death-or if a person is in per­ petual exile, being without male2 children, 1 let it be necessary in the first place to purify this house and make use of expia­ tory sacrifices according to law ;
and next, let the kindred com­ ing together, as we have said just now, examine together with the guardians of the laws, what family there is in the state in the greatest repute for virtue, and fortunate at the same time, and in which the children are rather numerous ;
from which let them put one upon the father of the deceased and his progenitors, as their adopted son, 3 and let them call him, for the sake of4 a good omen,4 by the name (of the father,)3 and pray that he 5may become for them a parent and hearth-preserver and minister of rites holy and sacred, with better fortune than his predeces­ sor;
6 (and)7 after praying in this manner, let them appoint him the heir according to law, and suffer the sinner to lie nameless, and childless, and shareless, whenever such a cala­ mity shall have seized upon him.[15.] 8
There is not, as it seems, in all existing things a bound­ ary close in contact with a boundary;
but in things to which there is a boundary, that in the middle being previously thrown to either of the boundaries, would become between both.
8
Moreover, we have said that what takes place in a passion is something between what arc voluntary and involuntary.
If then a person is found guilty of wounds 1 existing, taken place in a passion, in the first place let him pay double the amount of the damage, if the wound is curable;
but four­ fold in the case of those incurable.
But if it be curable indeed, and yet brings upon the wounded party a feeling of considerable shame and disgrace,2 let the party pay fourfold.
3
But when 4 a person in wounding another, injures not only the sufferer, but the state likewise, by rendering him unable to assist his country against its enemies, he must,5 in addition to other fines, pay for the damage done to the state.
6
For besides his own period of service abroad, let him go through that of the disabled party, and execute the orders relating to war ( at home) in the place of the other ;
6 or not doing so, let him be brought to trial by any one whatever, according to law, for neglect of military duty.
And let the judges, who have given their votes against him, fix the equivalent for the damage, whether it is to be twofold, or threefold, or fourfold.
If one relative by blood wounds another in the same manner, let the parents7 and kindred, as far as the cousins on the male and female side, come together, and decide to deliver the offender to his pa­ rents to fix the fine according to nature.
But if the fixing of the fine be a matter of doubt, let the kindred on the male side fix the fine definitely.
And if they are unable (to decide), let them at length commit it to the guardians of the laws.
And of such kind of wounds as are inflicted by children on their parents the judges must be of necessity above sixty years old, and whose children are not adopted but truly their own.
And if a person is found guilty, let them fix the punishment, whether such a person must die or suffer something else greater, or not much less ;
but let none of the relatives of the doer act as judge, not even if he be of the age which, the law has or­ dained.
But if a slave wounds any free-man in anger, let his owner give up the slave to the wounded person, to use him as he pleases;
but if (the owner) does not give him up, he him­ self shall remedy the wrong.
And if any one brings an ac­ cusation touching what has happened, as being a plan arising from an arrangement between the slave and the wounded party, let him contest the matter;
and if he does not get a ver­ dict, let him pay the damage threefold ;
but if he does, let him hold the party planning as amenable together with the slave under the statute of slavery.
But let him, who involuntarily wounds another, pay a simple fine;
for no legislator is com­ petent to be the ruler over accident;
and let the judges be.
those, who were mentioned in the case of children (wounding) their parents, and let them fix a fine for the damage.[16.]
All the aforesaid sufferings come under the class of violent;
and violent too is every kind of assault and disfigure­ ment.
It is necessary therefore for every man and every wo­ man in matters of this kind alway to bear in mind that, what is older is honoured in no small degree beyond what is younger, both amongst gods and such persons as are about to be in a state of safety and happiness.
To see therefore an assault made upon an elderly person by a younger is in a state a thing shameful and hateful to the deity ;
and it seems reasonable for every young man, when struck by an old one, to refrain with a light heart his anger, 1 and to lay up for himself such a kind of honour for his old age.
Thus then let it be.
Let every one reverence both in deed and word a person older than himself;
and let him, deeming a person, who is his superior by twenty years of age, whether male or female, as a father or mother, act re­ verently towards them, and let him keep his hands from every period of life, that would be able to beget or bring forth himself, for the sake of the gods who preside over births.
In like manner let him keep his hands2 3 from a stranger, whether a resident of old, or a new comer.
For neither as the aggressor nor in self-defence let him dare to punish by blows such a person.
4
But should he conceive that a stranger ought, through acting wantonly and rudely, to be punished, let him lay hold of the party and bring him before the office of the City-Stewards ;
but let him abstain from beating him,3 5in order that he may be far from daring to strike a fellow-citizen.
5
And let the City-Stewards, reverencing ever6 the god of hospitality, receive (the stranger) and sift the matter ;
and let them, should the stranger appear to have struck unjustly the inha­ bitant of the country, cause the stranger to cease from his foreign and bold behaviour, by inflicting as many blows as he may himself have struck.
But if he has acted not unjust­ ly, let them after threatening and reproaching the party, who had brought him, dismiss them both.
If one person strikes another of the same age with himself, or1 who is a little older, but without children, or if an old man strikes an old man, or one youth another, let a person defend himself according to nature, 2 [without a weapon, ] 2 with naked hands.
But if any one more than forty years old dares to fight with an­ other, either as the aggressor, or in self-defence, let him be called rude, and ill-mannered, and slave-like, and meeting with this disgraceful punishment, he will have what is becoming to him.
And if any one is obedient to these admonitions, he will be led easily by the rein ;
but let him, who is disobedient, and heeds not a prelude,3 receive with readiness the follow­ ing law.
If any one strikes another, who is older than him­ self by twenty years or more, in the first place, let him, who happens to be present, if he is neither of an equal age, nor younger than the combatants, prevent them ;
or 4 (if he does not prevent them,) 4 let him be considered a bad man according to law.
But if he is of the same age with, or younger than,, the person struck, let him defend the injured party, as if he were his brother or father, or a person still more remote ;
5 and fur­ ther still, let him, who has dared to strike his senior, undergo the punishment for an assault and disfigurement, as stated ;
and if he is found guilty, let him be put into prison for not less than a year ;
6 and if the judges fix the fine for a longer period,6 let the time so fixed be considered as positive.
If a stranger or a settler strikes his senior by twenty years or more, let the same law have the same power, with respect to the assistance of those who are present.
And let him, who is de­ feated in a suit of this kind, if he is a stranger, and not a settler,7 8 undergo this very punishment, by being in bonds for two years.
8
But if he is a settler, and disobedient to the laws, let him be in bonds for three years, unless the court of justice shall fix upon him a punishment for a longer period.
And let whoever happens to be present on any of these oc­ casions, and does not give assistance according to law, be fined, the person of the largest estate, a mina, of the second class, fifty drachms, of the third, thirty, and of the fourth, twenty ;
and let the court of justice for such matters consist of the Generals and Taxiarchs, and 1 Phylarchs and Hip­ parchs.1[17.]
With respect to the laws, some, as it seems, are in behalf of worthy men, for the sake of their instruction, as to what manner they may associate with each other on friendly terms;
others for the sake of those, who fly from instruction through their being of an unmanageable nature 2 and not to be softened,2 so that they proceed to every kind of vice.
These are the persons, who would have caused 3 the discourses to be spoken, that are about to be ;
for whom in truth the legislator would of necessity lay down his laws, while wishing that there may never be a need of using them.
Whoever then dares to touch his father 4 or mother or their progenitors still,4 5 and to violently maltreat them,5 neither fearing the anger of the gods above nor the so-called vengeance of those below the earth, but, as one who, thinking he knows what he does not know at all, despises the men of old, and what has been asserted by all, and acts contrary to the law, for such a person there is a need of some extreme turning aside.
Now death is not the extreme;
but the pains inflicted1 on such persons in Hades are still more amongst the extreme than this;
2 and though they tell3 the greatest truths, they effect nothing in the way of turning aside in the case of such souls as these.
For other­ wise there would not have been persons to strike their mothers,4 5nor the unholy daring of blows inflicted upon other parents.
5
It is requisite then, that the punishments here for crimes of this kind, should be as much as possible in no respect inferior to those in Hades.
Let then what follows be stated in this way.
Whoever shall dare to strike his father or mother, or their fathers or mothers, unless he is seized with madness, let, in the first place, any one, who is present, as mentioned before, give assistance;
but if it be a settler or stranger,6 who assists, let him be called to the principal seat at the (public) games;
but, not assisting, let him suffer a per­ petual exile from the country.
But let him,7 who is not a set­ tler,7 if he assists, receive praise;
but if he does not assist, blame.
And if a slave assists, let him be made free;
but if he does not assist, let him receive a hundred stripes with a whip.
And if this occurs in the market-place, let him (be whipt) by the Market-Stewards;
but if out of the market- place in the city, let any one of the City-Stewards, who is resident, inflict the punishment;
but if in the rural parts of the country, let the chiefs of the Land-Stewards do so.
If any denizen happens to be present 1 (when parents are struck by their child),1 whether such denizen be a boy, or a man, or a woman, let him assist, and call the striker an im­ pious wretch;
and let him, who does not assist, be implicated in the curse sworn in the name of Zeus 2 Homognius, and Patroius,2 according to law.
3
And if any one is convicted on the charge of assaulting and disfiguring his parents, let him, in the first place, suffer a perpetual exile from the city to some other country ;
and next, let him keep himself from all sacred rites ;
but if he will not so keep himself, let the Land-Stewards punish him with blows, and entirely as they please.
And if he returns from exile, let him be punished with death.
And if any free-man 4 shall eat or drink with such a person, or have any other communication of such a kind4 with him, or only touch him voluntarily, should he happen to meet him any where, let the party neither enter a temple, nor a place of public meeting, nor, in short, the city, until he is purified;
conceiving that he has had a communication with a calamity of an impious kind.
But if, disobedient to the law, he shall 5 contrary to the law5 defile the sacred places, and the city, let the magistrate, who, cognizant of this, does not institute a suit against such a person, 1 be held amenable 2 to the greatest ac­ cusation for this very matter.
3
If a slave strikes a free-man, whether a stranger or citizen, let any one present give assist­ ance, or pay the fine above-mentioned, according to the value of his estate;
4 and let those who are present succour the party struck, and having bound the striker, deliver him to the injured party 4 and he, on receiving him, shall 5 put him into the stocks,5 and give him as many stripes with a whip as he pleases, without doing an injury to the slave's owner, to whom let him deliver up the slave, to be his possession ac­ cording to law.
And let the law be this.
Whatever slave strikes a free-man, without the order of the magistrates, let his owner, on receiving him bound from the party struck, not release him from bonds, until the slave shall have persuaded the party struck that he deserves to be released and to live.
And let the same laws be for women, with respect to each other, on all matters of this kind;
and for women with re­ spect to men, and men to women.[1.]
AFTER assaults,6 let a law of some such kind as this be stated relating to acts of violence, one for all;
that no one shall 1 carry or take away 1 any thing belonging to another, or use his neighbour's property, if he has not induced the possessor (to permit it).
For from a thing of this kind 2 all the above-mentioned evils have depended, and do and will (depend).
2
But of the remaining evils, the greatest are the lasciviousness and insolence of young men;
to the greatest extent, when they are directed against sacred things ;
and they are particularly great in the case of public and holy matters, 3 or in those of the common portions of tribes-men, or any other (persons) 3 who have a communion in things of that kind.
The second in order and heinousness, are those (directed against) the sacred concerns of individuals and sepulchres.
The third, when, apart from the acts previously detailed, a person behaves insolently towards parents.
The fourth kind of insolence is, when any one, despising the magistrates, carries off, or 4 drives away, or makes use of any thing be­ longing to them, without having persuaded them (to suffer it).
5
The fifth consists in unjustly calling to account the political conduct of any citizen.
5 6 For each of these there must be assigned a law in common.
6
For in the case of sacrilege, it has been stated summarily what a person ought to suffer, if it takes place with violence and secrecy.
But with regard to what a person does by word or deed inso­ lently towards the gods, let me now detail, after laying down an exhortation,1 what he ought to suffer.
Let it then be this.
No one, who believes that there are gods, conformably to laws, has ever at any time voluntarily done an impious act, or spoken a word contrary to the laws ;
but he, 2 who does or says an impious deed or word against the gods,2 suffers one of these three things ;
either he does not think, what I have stated;
3 or, secondly, that, although they exist, they take no care of mankind ;
4 or, thirdly, that they are easily appeased by sacri­ fices,5 and drawn aside by prayers.
6Clin.
What then shall we do, and what shall we say to them ?
Athen.
Let us, my good man, first hear, what I prophesy they will jocosely say in contempt of us.
Athen.
Perhaps they will say with a banter—O guests from Athens, and Lacedasmon, and Cnossus, you speak the truth.
For some of us think 7the gods are no gods7 at all;
others, 8that they take no care of us;
and others, that they are drawn aside by prayers,8 as you have described them.
We deem it then proper, as you have deemed it with respect to the laws, that, before you threaten us severely, you should endeavour to persuade and teach us that there are gods, by stating suf­ ficient arguments, and that they are beings too good to be drawn aside, contrary to what is just, by any gifts.
For now, after hearing this, and other things of such a kind, from those said to be the best of poets, and orators, and prophets, and priests, and ten thousand times ten thousand others, the majority of us do not turn to the acting unjustly, but, after acting so, we endeavour to get a salve.
But on the part of legislators, who profess themselves to be not savage, but mild, we think it rea­ sonable for them to make use of persuasion in our case, by stating, with regard to the gods, if not in a manner much su­ perior to the rest, yet superior at least as regards the truth, that they do exist.
And then perhaps we may be persuaded by you.
Endeavour then, if we say what is fair, to speak on the points, to which we invite you.
Clin.
Does it not seem then easy, 0 guest, to say with truth, that there are gods ?
Clin.
In the first place, the Earth and Sun, and all the Stars, and the arrangements so beautiful of the Seasons, di­ vided into months and years, (prove this);
' and moreover, that allmen, both Greeks and Barbarians, believe that there are gods.
Athen.
I feel a fear, 0 blessed man—for I will never say that I feel shame, lest depraved persons hold you in con­ tempt.
For you are not acquainted with the cause of their difference2 (in opinion);
but you imagine that their souls are impelled to an impious life, by a want of mastery alone over pleasures and desires.
Clin.
But what other cause can there be, 0 guest, besides this ?
Athen. 3
That, which you would know nearly not at all, through living out of their way, and which would lie hid from yoU.
3
Clin.
Of what are you speaking at present ?
Athen.
A certain ignorance of a very grievous nature is appearing to be the greatest prudence.
Clin.
How say you ?[2.]
Athen.
There are certain stories put into writing amongst us, which, as I understand, are, through the virtue of your polity, not amongst you, some in a kind of verse, and others out of it, which speak of the gods.
The most ancient (assert), that the first nature was that of Uranus1 and the other (gods);
and proceeding they detail, not far from the beginning, the birth of the gods, and how after being born they had in­ tercourse with each other.
Upon those, who hear the accounts, whether they are well or not upon any other ground, it is not easy to cast a censure, as they are of the olden time;
but as regards the attention and honour to be paid to parents, I would never praise them, nor say that they are beneficial, nor that they have been correctly2 told at all.
Let then, what re­ lates to the writings of the ancients, be dismissed and bidden farewell, and let them be spoken of, as may be pleasing to the gods.
But let the poetry3 of the young and wise4 be blamed as the cause of evil;
for the language of such persons effects this.
For when you and I, detailing the proofs, that there are gods, bring forward those very things, the Sun and Moon, and Stars, and the Earth, as being gods and of a god-like nature, they, who have been persuaded by these wise men, would say that they are 5 earth and stones,5 and incapable of paying any regard to human affairs;
and that such ideas are cleverly wrapped round in a paste of words6 to render them plausible.
Clin.
You have spoken, guest, a speech, grave indeed, even if only one had (said so) ;
1 but now, since there happen to be very many (who say so),2 it will be still more grave.
Athen.
What then shall we say, and what ought we to do ?
Shall we apologize, as if some person were accusing us before impious men, who fly 3 from the subjects relating to legislation, and3 assert that we are acting in a shocking manner by legis­ lating as if there were gods ?
Or shall we bid farewell to these, and return again to the laws, in order that this our preface to the laws may not become rather prolix ?
For the discourse will, if stretched out, become by no means short, if we sufficiently prove only moderately by reasons to men, eager to act impiously, some of the points, on which they say we ought to speak;
4 and if we lead them to feel a fear upon others;
and if, after having caused them to be disgusted on others, we lay down laws after this on matters that are be­ coming.
4Clin.
But, 0 guest, we have often, for so short a time at least, said this very thing, that for the present it is not meet to prefer brevity to prolixity.
For nobody, according to the saying,5 is pursuing us in haste.
6
And it would be ridiculous,6 and at the same time paltry, for us to be seen preferring the shorter to the best.
And it is a thing of no little moment, for our reasons possess somehow a power to prove that there are gods, that they are good, and that they honour jus­ tice pre-eminently more than men.
For this will be nearly the most beautiful and excellent preface to all our laws.
Let us then, without feeling any disgust, or being urged on, exhibit, as far as we can, sufficiently whatever power we possess in the way of persuasion, and lay aside no part of such kind of reasonings.
Athen.
1
The speech just now spoken by you appears to me to invite a prayer,1 since you put yourself on the stretch with alacrity, nor is it fitting to delay any longer to discourse.[3.]
But come, (tell us) how can any one speak without a feeling of anger on the question 2 that there are gods ?
For there is a necessity for us to bear ill with and to hate those, who have been and are3 now the cause of the discussion, 4in not being persuaded4 by the tales, which they have heard even 5from young children,5 and when they were fed with milk from their nurses and mothers, and which were spoken, as it were, in epodes,6 both in sport and in earnest, and together with sacri­ fices hearing them in prayers, and seeing the sights that follow them,7 which a young person sees and hears with the greatest delight, when they take place ;
while their parents are making a sacrifice with the greatest earnestness, and occupied in it in behalf of themselves and them;
8 and addressing in prayers and supplications the gods, as really existing, both at the rising of the Sun and Moon, and at their setting ;
and when they hear and see the rollings on the ground and acts of adoration of Greeks and Barbarians of all kinds,' under the influence of all kinds of adversity and prosperity, not as if the gods were not existing, but as if existing in reality, and giving not even a handle for the suspicion that the gods do not exist— they who despise all these facts, and from not a single suffi­ cient reason, as all would say, who possess even a little intel­ lect, compel us to speak as we do at present, how can any one in mild language admonish, and at the same time teach them, in the first place, that the gods do exist?
Let us however dare the attempt.
For it is not meet that some of us2 should be mad through a violent hankering after pleasure, and others through being angry with such characters as these.
Let then our address to persons thus depraved in their intellect be of this kind and passionless, and let us speak mildly after extin­ guishing our anger, as if conversing with one of such persons —3
My child, you are young.
But time, as it advances, will cause you to change in many points the opinions you now hold, and to give them to the opposite side.
3
Wait then until that period, so as to become a judge of matters of the greatest moment.
Now that is of the greatest moment, which you at present deem to be of no consequence, namely, to have correct ideas on the subject of the gods, and to live well or not.
If then I first point out4 to you a thing of this kind, as being one of great moment, I shall not appear to tell a falsehood.
Not you alone nor your friends are the first, who have held this opinion respecting the gods;
but there have been always a greater or less number labouring under this very disease.
I will therefore tell you this, as I have come in contact with many of them, that not one of them, after adopting this opinion from their youth respecting the gods, that they do not exist, has continued to old age remaining in it.
Two circumstances have however remained as regards the gods, not indeed to many, but to some ;
one is, that the gods exist indeed, but take no care of human affairs ;
and the other after this, that they do indeed take care, but are easily appeased by sacrifices and prayers.
If then you will be persuaded by me, you will, turning over!
with all your might this doctrine, 2 which has ever been clear 2 to you, wait and consider whether it be thus or otherwise, by inquiring of other persons, and the legislator in particular.
But during that period do not dare to act impiously towards the gods.
For he, who lays down laws for you, must endea­ vour, both now and hereafter, to teach you on these points in what state they are.
Clin.
What has been said thus far, is, 0 guest, most beau­ tiful.
Athen.
Entirely so, Megillus and Clinias ;
but we have un­ consciously fallen upon a wonderful assertion.
Clin.
Of what kind are you speaking ?
A then.
That, which is thought by many to be the wisest of all assertions.
Clin. Speak yet clearer.[4.]
Athen.
Some persons surely say, that all things, which are and have been and will be, exist, some from nature, others from art, and others from chance.
Clin.
And do they not (say) well ?
Athen.
It is reasonable, indeed, for wise men to speak cor­ rectly.
Let us then follow 3those from that point,3 and consider what they happen to be thinking of.
Clin.
By all means.
A then.
It seems, say they, that nature and chance effect the greatest and most beautiful things, but art the lesser ;
which, receiving from nature the generation of great and primary works, moulds and fabricates all the smaller works, which all of us call artificial.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
I will speak still clearer in this way.
They say that fire and water and earth and air exist from nature and chance, and not one of them from art ;
and that the bodies, next after these, of the Earth, and the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars,1 are generated through them, being entirely with­ out a soul ;
and that, 2 each being borne along by the chance, which is a portion of the power of each,2 to the spot where they fall together, 3 fit together in some congenial manner,3 the hot with the cold, the dry with the moist, and the soft with the hard ;
and that all things, which by the mixture of con­ traries, according to chance, have been commingled through necessity, have in this way and under such circumstances really4 generated the whole of heaven and all that are in heaven, and animals and plants together, 5 all the seasons having been produced from them ;
5 and not, say they, through intel­ lect, nor any god, or art, but, as we have stated, by nature and chance;
and that art, mortal itself, being subsequently produced from these, themselves mortal, generated afterwards some kind of instruction, not partaking very much of truth, but certain images allied to themselves,6 such as painting produces, and music, and whatever arts are fellow-workers:
and that if any7 of the arts produce any thing of a serious nature, they are such as communicate their own power with that of nature, such as the art of medicine, and of agriculture, and of gymnastics ;
and, moreover, the statesman's art communicates in some small part with nature, but very much with art;
and thus the whole of legislation is not from nature, but art;
of which1 the posi­ tions are not true.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
The gods, 0 blessed man, these persons say, in the first place, exist from art, not nature, but from certain laws;
and that these are different amongst different people, according as each have agreed to have laws laid down for each.
2
And, moreover, that things beautiful by nature are of one kind, those by law of another ;
and that 3 things just do not exist by nature at all,3 but that persons continue to dispute amongst themselves about them, and are perpetually changing them ;
and that, what they change and when, possess then a fixed authority, emanating from art and laws, but not from any certain nature.
All these, my friends, are amongst young men4 the doctrines of the wise, both private persons5 and poets,6 who assert that to be the most just, by which a person obtains a victory through violence.
From whence both im­ piety comes upon young men—since gods are not such as the law enjoins us we ought to think there are—7 and seditions too (arise) on this account, while persons are drawing towards the life, which is correct according to nature, which is in truth that a person lives, the master over others, and not the slave of others according to law.
7Clin.
What an account have you, 0 guest, gone through, and what a mischief (detailed) to young men, both publicly in cities, and in their private homes !
Athen.
You speak truly, Clinias.
What then think you a le­ gislator ought to do, 1 when states have been of old in this con­ dition.
1
Ought he 2merely to stand up in the city2 and threaten all, that unless they assert, and 3 are thoroughly sa­ tisfied in their own minds,3 that there are gods, such as the law says there are, 4 (they shall suffer punishment).
4
And with respect to things beautiful and just, and every thing of the greatest moment, and whatever tends to virtue and vice, that it is meet for them to think and act in the way the legislator leads by his writings;
and that, whoever does not exhibit himself obedient to the laws, one of them ought to die, another to be punished with stripes and bonds, and another with disfranchisement, and others with poverty and exile ;
and that while he is laying down laws for men, 5 he is to have no persuasion over them, (so that) by fitting them to reason­ ings, he may, as far as he can, render them mild.
5Clin.
By no means, 0 guest.
But should any persuasion, though small, happen to exist relating to matters of this kind, it behoves a legislator, who is of the least worth, to be never faint-hearted, but1 to utter, as the saying is, every cry,' and to become an helper to the old legal saw,2 that there are gods, and such other things as you have discussed;
and more­ over, to aid both nature itself and art, (by showing) that they two exist by3 nature, or not less than nature,3 since they are the progeny of intellect, according to correct reasoning, which you seem to me to have stated, and as I now believe.
Athen.
0 thou most eager-minded Clinias, what, are not the matters thus spoken before the multitude difficult to follow up by arguments, and do they not possess a prolixity spoken with a clamorous voice ?
Clin.
But what, 0 guest, have we on the subject of drunk­ enness and music waited, while we were speaking at such a length, and shall we not wait (while speaking) on the subject of the gods, and such like matters ?
Moreover there will be4 the greatest assistance to the legislation, which is united to intelligence, because the ordinances relating to the laws being put into writing, will, 5as being about to afford a disproof,5 for all time remain 6 perfectly quiet.
So that we ought not to be alarmed, even if those things are at the commencement harsh to hear, which it will be in the power of a person, who is slow to learn, by frequently recurring to them, to look into ;
nor even, if they are prolix, yet useful, do they on this account possess no consideration;
nor does it seem to me to be a holy thing for every person not to assist these assertions to the utmost of his power.
Megil.
Clinias appears to me, 0 guest, to speak most ex­ cellently.
Athen.
Yes, very much so ;
and we must do as he says.
For if assertions of this kind were not scattered, so to say amongst all men, there would be no need of arguments to prove that there are gods.
But now this is necessary.
To whom then does it pertain, more than to the legislator, to give assistance to the greatest laws, when corrupted by wicked men ?
Clin.
To no one.1[5.]
Athen.
But do you, Clinias, tell me again—for it be­ hoves you to take part in the conversation-does not he, who mentions these things, namely, fire and water and earth and air, appear almost to consider them as the first of all things, and to call them nature, and (to say) that soul is (a production) subsequent to them ?
Does it seem that he not only appears (to think so), but in reality signifies to us so much by his assertions ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Have we not then, by Zeus, discovered, as it were, some source of the stupid opinion of those men, who have ever touched upon inquiries relating to nature?
Look into and examine the whole subject.
For it is a matter of no small moment, if those, who meddle (themselves) with impious as­ sertions, and are the leaders to others, are seen to employ arguments not correctly, but erroneously.
Such to myself at present2 appears to be the case.
Clin.
You speak well;
but endeavour to show why so.
Athen.
It seems then I must employ rather unusual argu­ ments.
Clin.
You must not, guest, hesitate.
For I understand that you conceive you will travel out of legislation, if we handle reasonings of this kind.
But if it is not possible to agree in any other way than this with what has been according to law just now stated, as being correct, 3on the subject of the gods,3 let us, 0 wonderful man, speak even in this way.
Athen.
I will detail then some such reasoning as this, which, as it seems, is nearly not usual.
The discourses, which have worked upon the soul of the impious, have shown that, what is the first cause of the generation and corruption of all things, was not produced the first, but subsequently, and that the subsequent was prior :
from whence they have erred re­ specting the real existence of the gods.
Clin.
I do not yet understand.
Athen.
Almost all men, my friend, appear to have been nearly ignorant what the soul happens to be, and what power it possesses, with respect to other things belonging to it, and its generation besides-how that it is amongst the first of sub­ stances and before all, and that more than any thing else it rules over the change and altered arrangement of bodies.
And if this be the case, is it not necessary for things allied to soul to have been produced prior to those pertaining to body, through soul itself being more ancient than body ?
Clin.
It is necessary.
Athen.
Now opinion, and care, and intellect, and art, and law, would be prior to things hard and soft, and heavy and light.
And moreover the great and first works and doings of art would be amongst the first things ;
but those produced by nature, and nature herself, which they do not correctly call by that name, would be posterior to, and ruled by art and intellect.
Clin. I How not correctly ?
Athen.
Because1 they are willing to say that nature is the generation relating to the first;
2 and they place bodies amongst the first.
2
But if soul shall appear to be first, and not fire or air, 3 soul would be said with almost the greatest correctness to have 'been produced amongst the first;
and these will be pre-eminently by nature in this state, should any one show that soul is more ancient than body;
3 but other­ wise not.
Clin.
You speak most true.
Athen.
Shall we then, after this, proceed to this very point ?
CUn.
Undoubtedly.
Athen.
But let us by all means guard against a deceitful reason, lest perchance, being of a youthful look, it persuades us old men improperly, and after escaping, makes us a laugh­ ing-stock ;
and lest we appear, 1 after throwing ourselves upon greater things, to miss even the little.
1
Consider then, if it were requisite for us three to pass a river, running with a strong current, and I, happening to be the youngest of us, and acquainted with many rivers, should say,-It is proper for my­ self to make an experiment the first, and, leaving you in safety, to ascertain whether it is fordable by you, older than my­ self, or how it is;
and, on its appearing to be in that state, I were then to call upon you, and by my experience cause you to pass it together with myself;
but if not fordable by you, for the danger to fall upon myself—I should appear to speak with moderation.
So now, the future reasoning is of rather a violent kind, and perhaps nearly impassable, at least by your strength.
2
Lest then it should cause in you a dizziness and giddiness, by being carried round, and put questions to you unaccustomed to give answers, and afterwards beget in you an unseemly and unbecoming conduct,2 it appears to me that I ought, in the present case, to do thus to myself, (namely) to interrogate my­ self, first, while you are hearing in safety, and after this to give the answer myself, and thus to go through the whole of the reasoning, until, as regards the soul, it is finished, and shows that soul exists prior to body.
Clin.
You seem to us, guest, to speak most excellently;
and do then as you are saying.[6.]
Athen.
Come then, if at any time we ought to call upon gods,1 let this be done so now;
(and) let them be called on with all earnestness to the demonstration of their existence.
And laying hold, as by some secure rope,2 let us mount up to the present reasoning.
Now it appears to me that, when I am examined upon these points, I shall answer most securely after this fashion,3 to questions of this kind.
When a person says—O guest, do all things stand still,4 and is nothing moved;
or does quite the contrary5 to this take place?
Or, are some things moved, but others remain (fixed) ?
To this I shall reply-Some things are moved, but others remain (fixed).
Do not then the things, which stand still, stand in a certain place;
and are not the things, which are moved, moved (in a certain place) ?
How not ?
And some things would surely do so in one spot, but others in more (than one).
Are you speak­ ing, we shall say, of the things, which, obtaining the power of such as stand in the middle, are moved in one (spot), just as the circumference of tops,6 which are said to stand still, re­ volves ?
I do.
And we understand that, in this circumference, the motion, which carries round 7 the largest and the smallest circle,7 distributes itself proportionally in small and large circles, and is proportionally less and more.
Hence it becomes the fountain of all wonderful things, 1 proceeding (with) slow­ ness 1 and swiftness, that coincide with large and small circles,2 in a manner that one would expect to be an impossible occur­ rence.
You speak most true.
But by things that are moved in many (places), you appear to me to mean such as are car­ ried along by a movement, and pass from one place to another.
And 3sometimes it is when3 they obtain the going of some one centre, and sometimes more,4 by being rolled around,5 6and meeting on each occasion with each, they are cut through by those that stand still ;
6 1but being in the middle and between things of this kind, they are mingled with each other, meeting from an opposite direction, and carried along to one point.
1 I mean that these things are, as you say.
And, moreover, the things that are mingled together,2 are increased;
but when separated,3 waste away, when the existing condition of each remains ;
but when it does not remain, both are destroyed.
But the generation of all things takes place, when what event occurs ?
It is evident that, when the commmencement, after re­ ceiving an increase, arrives at the state of a second transition, and proceeding from this to that which is near, as far as three, 4it possesses sense in things sentient.
4
Every thing therefore is generated by this change and transition, and it exists in reality when it remains ;
but when it is changed into another condition, it becomes entirely destroyed.
Have we not then detailed, 0 friends, the whole of motion in its species and num­ bers, except two ?
Clin.
Of what kind are those ?
Athen.
They are nearly those, my good man, for the sake of which has been the whole of our present inquiry.
CUn.
Speak more clearly.
Athen.
It was surely for the sake of soul.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
Let then one motion be that, which is able to move other things, but is ever unable to move itself ;
5 and let the other be that, which is ever able to move both itself1 and other things, by a commingling and a separation, and by in­ crease and the contrary,2 and by generation and corruption ;
and let this motion be different from all the other motions.
Clin.
Be it so.
Athen.
Shall we not then place that motion as the ninth, which always moves another, and is moved by another ;
but the motion, which moves both itself and others, (and) which is adapted to all doings and sufferings, and which is truly de­ nominated the change and motion of all things, shall we not call this almost3 the tenth ?
4Clin. Entirely so.Athen.
But which of the ten motions shall we most correctly select as the most powerful of all, and pre-eminently effective ?
CUn.
It is necessary to say, that the motion, which is able to move itself is superior ten thousand-fold, and that all the rest come after this.
Athen.
You speak well.
Must we not then alter one or even two of our present assertions, as having been made not correctly ?
Clin.
Of what are you speaking ?
Athen.
That, which was stated respecting the tenth, was not correctly stated.
Clin.
In what way ?
Athen.
According to reason, it is the first in generation and strength ;
but we hold, as second to this, that which comes after it, (the tenth,) although it has been just now absurdly called the ninth.
Clin.
How say you ?[7.]
Atlien.
Thus.
When one thing moves another, and something else always moves the former, will there ever be amongst such things any thing which first moves ?
Clin.1
How can that, which is moved by another, ever be the first of things that cause an alteration ?
Athen.1
It is certainly impossible.
But when a thing, by moving itself, alters another thing, and this latter some other thing, and thousand things upon ten thousand become moved thus, will there be any other commencement of all the motion than the change of that, which moves itself ?
Clin.
You speak most beautifully ;
and on these points we must agree.
Athen.
Let us speak 2 still further in this way, and give an answer to ourselves.
If all things that are produced should somehow stand still together, as the majority of such persons3 dare to assert (they do), which of the above-mentioned mo­ tions must necessarily exist the first ?
Clin.
That surely which moves itself.
For things 4 will never change by a fall under another, when there has not ex­ isted previously a change by a fall in themselves.
4Athen.
We will say then that the commencement of all motions, and which first exists in things standing still and moved, is that, which moves itself;
(and) that this is neces­ sarily the most ancient and the most powerful change of all:
but that the second is that, which is altered by another thing, and moves other things.
Clin.
You speak most true.
Athen.
Since then we are at that point of our reasoning, let us likewise give an answer to this.
Athen.
If perchance we should see this (first) 1 motion taking place in a body formed of earth, or water, or fire-like, whether separate or mixed, what circumstance should we say was inherent in a thing of this kind ?
Clin.
Do you ask me, whether, when a thing moves itself, we should say it is alive ?
Athen.
Yes.
Clin.
That it is alive.
How not ?
Athen.
But what, when we see soul inherent in any thing, must we admit 2that it lives through any thing else than this ?
Clin.
Through nothing else.
2Athen.
Hold then, by Zeus.
Would you not be willing to understand three things with respect to each thing ?
CUn.
How say you ?
Athen.
One, the existence;
and one, the definition3 of the existence;
and one, its name;
and that there are likewise two questions respecting every thing that exists ?
Clin.
How two ?
Athen.
Sometimes each of us, when the name itself 4is pro­ posed, inquires the definition;
and sometimes, when the de­ finition itself4 is proposed, we inquire on the other hand the name.
Are you then willing for us to speak again of a thing of this kind at present ?
Clin.
Of what kind?
Athen.
There is surely a twofold distinction in other things, and in numeration.
Thus, for instance, in numeration, " even " is a name;
but the definition is, a number divided into two equal parts.
Clin. Certainly.
Athen.
I mean some such thing as this.
Do we not speak of the same thing in each way, when, on being asked the name, we give the definition, or, being asked the definition, (we give) the name ?
1 and when we call by the name of " even " a thing really the same, but by a definition divide a number as into two (equal) 1 parts ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
But what is the definition of that thing, to which there is the name of soul ?
Have we any other than what has been just now mentioned, I mean, the motion which is able to move itself?
Clin.
Do you mean, that the thing, which moves itself, is the definition of that existence, which we all call by the name of soul?
Athen.
Yes, I do.
But if this be the case, do we not still regret that it has not been shown sufficiently, that soul is the same with the first generation and motion of things which are, and have been, and will be, and, on the other hand, 2 of all the contraries to these;
2 since it has appeared to be the cause of all change and motion in all things ?
Clin.
No.
For soul has been sufficiently shown to be the most ancient of all things, and the commencement of motion.
Athen.
Will not then the motion, which exists in another through another, but which never causes a thing to be moved in itself, be the second in order?
3 and ought it not to be placed after the former motion, by whatever interval of num­ bers any one may choose to reckon,3 since it is the change by a truly soulless body ?
Clin.
Right.
Athen.
Rightly then, and decisively, and most truly, and most completely, should we have said that soul was generated prior to body, and that body is posterior and secondary, as being according to nature ruled over by the ruling soul.
Clin.
With the greatest truth indeed.[8.]
Athen.
We surely remember, however, that we agreed on a previous occasion that, if soul should appear to be more ancient than body, the things pertaining to soul would also be more ancient than those pertaining to body ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Now conduct, and manners, and wishes, and reason­ ings, and true opinions, and attention, and memory, would have been generated prior to the length, and breadth, and depth, and strength of bodies, if soul be (prior) to body.
Clin.
It is necessary.
Athen.
Is it not then necessary after this to acknowledge, that soul is the cause of things good and evil, and of honour­ able and base, and of just and unjust, and of all contraries, if we lay it down as the cause of all things ?
Athen.
Is it not also necessary to assert, that soul, which administers 1 [and dwells in] 1 all things that are moved in every way, administers likewise the heavens ?
Athen.
One soul, or many ?
Many;
(for) I will answer for you.
Let us not then lay down less than two, one the beneficent, and the other able to effect things of a contrary kind.
2Clin.
You speak very correctly.
Athen.
Be it so.
Soul then leads every thing in heaven, and on earth, and in the sea, by its movements;
the names of which are, to will, to consider, to take care of, to consult, to form opinions true and false, to be in a state of joy, sorrow, con­ fidence, fear, hate, love, together with all such primary move­ ments as are allied to these, and which, receiving those of bodies that are secondary efficients, lead all things to increase and decay, and to rarefaction and condensation, and to things consequent upon these, such as heat, cold, gravity, lightness, the hard and the soft, the white and the black, the sour and sweet, (and the bitter,) 1 and all that Soul makes use of, when, being a goddess herself, 2 she ever takes as an ally Mind, a god,2 and disciplines all things correctly and happily;
but when with Not-Mind,3 it works out every thing the contrary.
Shall we lay down that such is the case ?
or do we still doubt whether the case is different ?
Clin.
By no means.
Athen.
Whether then shall we say, that the genus of soul has a power over heaven and earth, and the whole circuit,4 (as being) 5 intellectual and full of virtue, or as6 possessing neither of these qualities ?
Are you willing then for us to answer these questions thus ?
Athen.
If, let us say, 0 wonderful man, the whole path of he a- ven, and at the same time the progressive movement of all it contains, possess a nature similar to the motion and circulation and reasonings of Mind, and proceed in a manner allied to them, it is evident that we must say that the most excellent soul takes care of the whole world, and leads it along a path of that very kind.
Clin. Right.A then.
But if it proceeds in a mad and disordered manner, that the evil (soul leads it).
Clin.
And this too is correct.
A then.
What nature then does the motion of Mind pos­ sess ?
To this question indeed it is difficult, friends, to an­ swer prudently.
It is therefore just that I should for the present anticipate 1 you in the answer.
Clin.
You say well.
A then.
Let us then not look, as it were, opposite to the sun,2 and, bringing upon ourselves night in mid-day, answer the question, 3 as if we could ever sufficiently see and know Mind with mortal eyes:
3 but one may see it more securely by look­ ing to the image of the object of the question.
CUn.
How say you ?
Athen.
From among those ten motions let us take (one) 4 as an image, to which Mind is similar, which bearing in re­ membrance, I will in common with you give a reply.
CUn.
You would speak most beautifully.
Athen.
We remember, at present,5 so much at least of what was said formerly, that some of all things we laid down were moved, and others remained ( at rest).
Clin.
We do.
Cthen.
But of things, which are moved, some were moved in one place, but others borne along in many.
CUn.
They are so.
A then.
Of these motions, it is necessary for that, which is borne 1 along in one place, to be moved round a certain middle point, in imitation of 2 circles fashioned by a wheel,2 and that it is in every respect as much as possible allied and similar to the circular movement of Mind.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
In saying that both Mind and the movement borne along in one place, are moved according to the same, and in a similar manner, and in the same, and round the same, and to­ wards the same, according 3 to one reason, and one order, similar to the movements of a sphere 4 made round by a turner, we should not appear to be at all indifferent workmen for beautiful similes in a speech.
Clin.
You speak most correctly.
A then.
The motion, then, which is not borne along in a similar manner, nor according to the same, nor in the same, nor round the same, nor towards the same, 5 neither in ar­ rangement, nor in order, nor in one certain reason,5 will be allied to all Not-Mind.
Clin.
It will so most truly.
Athen.
It will then be now no longer difficult to assert dis­ tinctly, that since it is soul, which leads all things in a circular manner, we must of necessity assert, that the best soul, or the contrary, leads round, and takes care of, and arranges the circular movement of heaven.
Clin.
From what has been now stated, it is not, 0 guest, holy to say otherwise than that either one soul, possessing every virtue, or more souls, lead those things round.
Athen.
You have listened, Clinias, to the reasons in the best manner ;
but listen still further to this.[9.
J Athen.
If a soul leads round the Sun, and Moon, and the other Stars, does it not do so to each singly.
Athen.
Let us then direct our arguments to one (luminary), that they may appear to suit all the stars.
Clin.
Which one ?
Athen.
Every one sees the body of the Sun, but not one its soul;
nor (the soul) even of the body of any other animal, either living or dead ;
1 but there is a great hope that this ge­ nus (of things), which is naturally altogether not perceptible by all the senses of the body, would be thoroughly perceptible by the Mind alone.
Let us then take something of this kind in our thoughts respecting it.
1Athen.
If soul leads the Sun, we shall perhaps not miss the mark by asserting that it does so in nearly one of these three methods.
Atken.
That either, residing within this apparent circular body, it entirely carries along a thing of that kind, just as the soul within us carries us around every where;
or that, by sup­ plying somehow from without a body of fire or air, as the doc­ trine is of some persons, it violently impels body with body ;
or thirdly, that being itself destitute of body, yet possessing certain other powers pre-eminently wonderful, it leads the way.
1 Clin.
Yes, this is necessary, that a soul, by doing some one of these things, should lead through2 all.
Athen 3
And this too is surely better,3 for every man to consider this very soul as a god, 4 which, keeping together the Sun, as a well-reined car, brings a dancing light to all the uni­ verse, whether derived from without, or in whatever manner, or by whatever road.
Or how shall we say ?
Clin.
Yes, (for every man) surely, who has not arrived at the extremity of silliness.
Athen.
But with respect to all the stars, and the moon, and years, and months, and all the seasons, shall we give any other account than this, that, since a soul, or souls, good in every virtue, are seen to be the causes of all these things, we will call them gods, whether they exist in bodies, as being animals, and put in order the whole of heaven, by what­ ever road or in whatever manner (they do so) ?
nor is there the person,1 who, assenting to this, would endure (to say) that all things are not full of gods.
Clin. 3
There is not, 0 guest, a person so insane.
3A then.
After assigning then limits to him, who at the former period conceived that gods do not exist, let us, Clinias and Megillus, free ourselves (from this person).
Clin.
What (limits) ?
Athen.
Either that he is to teach us we do not speak rightly, in laying down that soul is the first generation of all things, and such other points as follow upon this ;
or, if he is unable to assert any thing better than we do, that he is to be per­ suaded by us, and live for the remainder of his life in the notion that gods do exist.
Let us then see whether we have spoken sufficiently to those, who do not conceive that gods exist, or insufficiently.
Clin.
Insufficiently, 0 guest, the least of all.[10.]
A then.
For these then let this be the end of our dis­ course.
And let us thus 5 soothe him, who conceives that gods exist indeed, but take no care of human affairs.
Let us then say, 0 thou best (of men),6 since you think there are gods, perhaps a certain divine relationship leads you to honour what is cog­ nate, and to think it does exist;
but the 7 (good) fortune 7 of evil and unjust men, both in private and public life, who, al­ though not truly happy, yet are deemed to be very much so in common opinion, and are.
improperly hymned by the Muses, and in all kinds of compositions to boot, leads you not very sensibly1 to impiety.
Or perhaps, on seeing that impious old men, after arriving at their end, have left behind them grand- children in the greatest honours, you are disturbed 2 for the present 2 3 in all these matters;
3
4or learning by hearsay, or perhaps being altogether an eye-witness,4 you have met with many and dreadful impieties, that have occurred to some, who through such very acts have arrived5 6 from small means at despotic power and the greatest (state ).6
On account of all such events, you would then evidently be unwilling to blame the gods as the causes of such things, through your relation­ ship with them ;
but at the same time being led by a want of reason, and unable to feel an ill-will towards the gods, you have arrived at your present state, so as to think that they do indeed exist, but that they despise and neglect the affairs of men.
In order then that your present opinion may not7 draw you in the direction of impiety to greater suffering, but that we may be able, as it were, to send it away,2 while ad­ vancing (like a disease), by reasonings, let us endeavour to unite the reasoning next in order, with that, which we went through from the beginning, against the party, who held that gods did not exist at all, and to make use of it for the present.
And do you, Megillus and Clinias, in succession, answer for the young man, as you did before;
and if in our reasonings any thing difficult occurs, I will, as I did just now, take hold of you and cause you to pass the river.
Clin.
You speak correctly.
And do you act in this man­ ner, and we will, to the best of our power, do as you say.
Megil.3
But, perhaps, it would not be difficult to prove this at least, that the gods are no less attentive to small things than to such as are pre-eminent in greatness.
For I surely 4 heard and was present4 during what was just now said, that they are good and possess every virtue, and have a care peculiarly their own of all things.
Clin.
And I too heard it very distinctly.
Athen.
Let us then after this search out in common thus, by speaking of what virtue of theirs do we acknowledge that they are good.
Come then, to be temperate, we say, and to pos­ sess a mind, (belongs) to virtue, but their contraries to vice.
Clin.
We say so.
Athen.
And that fortitude (belongs) to virtue, and cow­ ardice to vice.
Clin.
Entirely so.Athen.
And shall we say that some of these are base, and others honourable?
Clin.
Of necessity.
Athen.
And shall we say that of such things those, that are vile, if (vile) they are, belong to us;
but that to gods there is no share in aught that is great or small amongst things of this kind ?
CUn.
And this too every one would acknowledge.
Athen.
What then, shall we place carelessness, and idleness, and luxuriousness, as belonging to the virtue of soul?
Or how do you say ?
Clin.
How can we ?
Athen.
But belonging to the contrary ?
CUn.
Yes.
Athen.
The contraries therefore to these belong to that which is contrary.
CUn.
To that which is contrary.
Athen.
What then, would a person luxurious, and careless, and idle, whom the poet says is most like the bees without a sting, be 3wholly of such a kind amongst us?
3Clin. 4
Having spoken most correctly.
4Athen.
It must not then be said, that a god has a habit of such a kind that be himself hates it;
nor must we overlook it, when a person attempts to say so much.
Clin.
By no means.
For how could it (be said) ?
Athen.
But of him, to whom it belongs pre-eminently to do, and to take care of, any thing, does the mind take care of great things, but neglect small ?
(And)1 shall we not do wrong entirely in the case of a person by praising such an assertion ?
But let us view the matter in this way.
Does not he, who acts so,2 whether a god or a man, so act according to two kinds (of acting) ?
Clin.
What two ?
Athen.
We will tell (you).
3
Either because he thinks it of no consequence to the whole, when the small are neglected ;
or, if it is of consequence, he does through indolence and luxu­ riousness (knowingly) disregard them.
4
Or does negligence take place in any other way ?
For surely, when it is impos­ sible to take care of all things, there will not then be a neg­ lect of things small, or great, in the case of the party not taking care of what 5 either a god may be wanting in power or some trifling person unable to take care.
5[II. ] Athen.
Now then let those two, who, although they both confess that there are gods, yet one (says) they are easy to be turned aside, and the other that they neglect matters of small moment, give an answer to us three.
Do ye both assert, first that the gods know, and see, and hear all things, and that no- thing of what there is a perception or knowledge can lie hid from them ?
Do ye say that such is the case ?
Or how ?
CUn.
That it is such.
Athen.
What then, that they are able to do all things over which there is a power to mortals and immortals ?
Clin.
How will they not agree that such too is the case ?
Athen.
We five then have agreed that the gods are good and the best.
Clin. Entirely.
Athen.
Is it not, then, impossible to confess that they do at all any thing whatever through indolence and luxuriousness, since they are such as we confess they are?
For with us in­ activity is the offspring of cowardice, but indolence of inactivity and luxuriousness.
Clin.
You speak most truly.
Athen.
Now of gods not one is negligent through inactivity and indolence;
for in cowardice surely they have no share.
CUn.
You speak most correctly.
Athen.
It remains then that, if they neglect things of little moment and size of those in the universe, they would do so either through their knowing that there is no need of taking care of things of this kind;
1 or-what remains but to think the contrary ?
1Clin.
Nothing.
A then.
Whether then, 0 thou 2 most excellent and best of men,2 shall we put you down, as saying that (the gods) are ignorant, and through their ignorance neglect, when they ought to take care;
or that, knowing what is proper, they do just as the weakest of mankind are said 3 to do, when they know there are other things better to be done1 than what they are really doing, they do not do them through some failure, aris­ ing from pleasure or pain.
Clin.
But how could there be ignorance ?
2Athen.
Do not human affairs partake of a nature endued with soul ?
and at the same time is not man of all animals the most pious towards the gods ?
3Clin.
It appears so.
Athen.
Now we assert that all mortal animals are the pro­ perty of gods, to whom belongs 4 the whole of heaven.
Athen.
Let then any one say that these things are to the gods either small or great, (it matters not);
5 for on neither ground would it be fitting for our owners, who are the most careful and the best, to neglect us.
For let us, in addition to these points, consider still further this.
Athen.
Respecting sensation and power, are they not na­ turally contrary to each other, with reference to easiness and difficulty ?
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
To see and hear small things is more difficult than large.
But on the other hand, to carry, and to rule over, and to take care of, small and few things, is for every one more easy than in the case of their contraries.
CUn.
Yes, more easy.
Athen.
But when the whole of a thing is enjoined upon a physician, both willing and able to cure, will the whole itself1 ever be in a good state, while he is taking care of great mat­ ters, but neglecting parts that are small?
Clin.
By no means.
Athen.
Nor will things many and large, apart from the few and small, 2(be in a good state)2 in the case of pilots, or army-leaders, or housekeepers, nor, 3 on the other hand, of some3 statesmen, or any other person of such a kind.
For ma­ sons say, that great stones do not lie well without small ones.
4Clin. 5 For how (is it possible) ?
Athen,
We will not then think it right5 for a god at least to be even more vile than mortal artificers ;
who, the better they are, by so much the more do they from one art bring out accurately and perfectly the works small and great, per­ taining to their own trade;
but that a god, who is most wise, and both willing and able to take care of things, does of things which, being small, it is easy to take care of, take no care at all, like a person inactive or timid, or listless through labour, but only of things that are largerClin.
Let us by no means, 0 guest, receive this notion, re­ specting the gods;
for we should form a conception neither holy nor true.
Athen.
We seem then, to myself, to have conversed in a very moderate manner with him who loves to find fault with the carelessness on the part of the gods.
Clin. Certainly.
Athen.
By forcing him through our reasoning to confess that he does not speak correctly.
He seems however to my­ self to be still in want of enchantments by certain words.1[12.]
Athen.
Let us persuade the young man by our reason­ ings, that by him, who takes care of the universe, with a view to the safety and excellence of the whole, every thing has been ar­ ranged, each part of which, as far as possible, suffers and acts what is suited to it;
and that over each of these parts rulers have been appointed with reference to even the smallest por­ tion of action and passion, 2 having worked out an end to the ultimate distribution ;
2 of which parts, even thy portion, 0 miserable man, is one, and although it is very small, it is con­ tinually stretching its view to the whole.
But this very thing has lain hid from you, that all generation is for the sake of the whole, in order that the existence of the universe may be happy in its life, and not for the sake of you ;
but that you exist for the sake of the universe.
For every physician, and every skilful handicraftsman, works out all things for the sake of the whole, stretching (his view)3 to that which is the best, taken in common ;
and he fashions a part for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of a part.
4
But you take it ill, through not knowing that what is best with respect to yourself, happens both to the universe and yourself, according to the power of a common generation.
But since a soul, connected 5 at one time with one body and at another with another, undergoes all kinds of changes through itself, or through some other soul, nothing else remains for the player at pebbles1 than to place the habit, which has become better, into a better place, but the worse into a worse, according to the proper condition of each, in order that they may obtain their fitting allotment.
Clin.
In what way do you mean ?
Athen.
I appear to myself to be speaking in that way, by which an inactivity on the part of the gods in taking care of all things would seem to have a reason.
For if any one, al­ ways looking to the whole, were to mould all things by changing their forms-for instance, water 2with a soul2 from fire,.
and either 3 many things from one or one from many—parti­ cipating in a first, or second, or even a third generation, the things relating to an altered arrangement would be infinite in number.
But now there is a wonderful easiness to the party taking a care of the universe.
Clin.
How again, say you ?
Athen.
Thus.
After our king had seen all his actions, pos­ sessing a soul,4 and much of virtue existing in them, and much of vice, and both soul and body being a thing 5 indestructible, but not eternal,5 like the gods, existing according to law,l for there never would have been a generation of living beings, if either of these (soul or body) had been destroyed,—and that the thing which, as being2 a good in the soul, has been thought to be always naturally disposed to be of service, but that the thing which, as being an evil in it, (has been thought) to do mischief,-all this, when (the king) beheld, he planned, where each of the parts should be situated, and cause virtue to gain the victory in the universe,3 and vice to suffer a defeat, in the easiest4 and best manner.
He planned therefore generally5 this, how a thing, being generated of what kind, what seat it ever ought to share in,6 and in what place7 reside ;
but he left to the will of each of us the causes of generation of 8this or that.
8 9 For wherever a person has a desire, and of what kind he may be as to his soul, there nearly on each occasion, and such becomes each of us, for the most part.
9Clin.
It is likely.
Athen.
Every thing then, that has a share of soul, is changed, and possesses in itself the cause of the change;
but, when changed, it is borne along according to the order and law of fate.
And 1 of the manners such as being changed are less and less (wicked),1 proceed along the superficies of the region;
2 but those that are more (changed) and are more unjust, fall into a depth, and into the so-called places below, which per­ sons, designating by the name of Hades, and what are close upon these appellations, greatly fear, and dream of, when living 3 and freed from their bodies;
but the soul when it partakes more of vice than of virtue through its will and intercourse becoming strong, when mixing with divine virtue, it becomes pre-eminently such, and it is changed to a pre-eminent place entirely holy, after being carried to some other better place;
but when the contrary, it transfers its life to the contrary.3[13.]
1
This is the judgment of the gods, who hold Olympus—1O thou 2boy and youth,2 who thinkest that thou art neg­ lected by the gods;
for that the person, who has become more wicked, departs to the more wicked souls ;
but he, who has become better, to the better, both in life, and in all3 deaths, to suffer and do what is fitting for the like4 to do to the like.
But neither must you or any one else1 pray, after becoming fortunate,2 to be superior to this judgment of the gods.
For this judgment, pre-eminent above all, did those, who or­ dained, ordain, and it is meet to regard it carefully in every way.
For you will never be neglected by it, 3 not though you were so small, as to sink into the depths of the earth, nor so lofty, as to fly up to heaven;
3 but you will suffer from them the fitting punishment, whether you abide here, or depart to Hades, or are carried to a place still more wild4 than those.
And my language will be the same to you, as it was respecting those persons, whom you have seen becoming great after being small, and whom, after committing unholy acts, 5 [or doing some­ thing of that kind,]5 you thought had become happy after being miserable.
And then you conceived that you beheld in their doings, as in a mirror, the disregard of all things on the part of the gods, nor did you know in what way they pay up the full amount of their contribution to every one;
6 and to know that, think you, 0 most courageous of all men, is a thing of no consequence?
7 which he who is ignorant of, will neither see a type of life, nor be able to contribute a discourse about it on the subject of happiness or an unhappy fortune.
If then Clinias here, and the whole of this old assembly,8 are able to persuade you that you do not know what you are saying about the gods, a god himself will kindly give you his aid;
but if you are still in want of a further reason, hear us, if you possess any mind whatever, while we are speaking to the third party.
For that there are gods, and that they take care of men, I would say has been not altogether badly shown by us.
But that the gods can be turned aside by receiving gifts from those who act unjustly, must not be conceded to any one;
but on the other hand, disproved by every means in our power.
Clin.
You speak most beautifully ;
and let us do as you say.
A then.
Come, then, by the gods themselves, (say) if forsooth1 they are turned aside in what manner are they so moved;
and who and what kind of beings are they ?
Now it is surely necessary for those to be rulers, who regulate continually the whole of heaven.
Clin.
It is so.
Athen.
But to what rulers are they like?
or what rulers are like to them 2amongst such as it is in our power to meet with, while likening the less to the greater ?
2
Would such be either the rein-holders, while two-yoked cars are contending (in the course), or the pilots of ships ?
Perhaps however they may be likened to certain leaders of armies.
Or it would be possible to liken them to physicians, who have a prudent care respecting the war of diseases3 about bodies;
or to hus­ bandmen, who, in fear for the generation of plants, wait for the usual period of bad seasons;
or to the superintendents of herds.
For, since we have agreed amongst ourselves that heaven is full of many good things, and that there are some of the opposite kind, but the majority is of those that are not,4 we assert that a war of this kind is immortal, and requires a won­ derful watching.
The gods however, and at the same time daemons, fight on our side;
for5 we are the property both of gods and demons.
But injustice and insolence together with imprudence corrupt us;
whereas justice and temperance, united to prudence, which dwell in the soul-endued powers of the gods, preserve us.
Now that some little portion of such properties resides in us, one may clearly see even in this way.
Certain souls residing on the earth, and possessing an unjust disposition, 1 it is plain, have a savage feeling towards the souls of their guardians, whether dogs, or shepherds, or in every respect the highest of all rulers.
(And) 2falling upon these, they persuade them2 by flattering words, and some prayer-like enchantments3—as say the reports of the wicked­ that it is lawful for them to possess a superfluity of power amongst men, and not to suffer anything.
Now this superfluity, what is now denominated a sin, we surely say is called, in the case of fleshly bodies, a disease;
in that of the seasons of the year, 4 a pestilence;
and in that of cities and polities, by giving again to this very word a change, injustice.
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Such a reasoning as this it is, therefore, necessary for him to state, who asserts that the gods always pardon men 5unjust and acting unjustly,5 should any one offer a part of his unjust gains, just as wolves 6give a small portion of their plunder to dogs,6 who, being softened down by gifts, allow them to seize upon the sheep.
Is not this the assertion of those who say that the gods are easily turned aside ?
Clin.
It is this.[14.]
A then.
To which then of the aforesaid guardians would any man 1 by likening the gods1 not become a laughing-stock ?
Is it to pilots, who turned aside 2
By wine-libations and the scent of fat,2 destroy both the ships and the sailors ?
Clin.
By no means.
Athen.
Nor yet to charioteers, who, when drawn up in order for contest, are induced by a bribe to give up the victory to the other two-yoked cars.
Clin.
For in speaking such a speech you would speak of a dreadful likeness.
Athen.
Nor yet to army-leaders, nor to physicians, nor to husbandmen, nor to shepherds, nor to certain dogs softened down by wolves.
Clin. Speak good words.
For how could 3 (a person, by so likening them, not be a laughing-stock) ?
A then.
But are not all the gods the greatest of all guardians, and over the greatest affairs ?
Clin.
Very much so.
Athen.
Shall we then say that those, who watch over the most beautiful things, and over 4 themselves pre-eminently,4 with a guard as respects virtue, are worse than dogs, and men of a moderate kind, who would never betray justice for the sake of bribes5 given in an unholy manner from unjust men ?
Clin.
By no means-such an assertion is not to be borne ;
and of those, 6who are engaged in every kind of impiety,6 he who lays hold of this opinion runs the risk surely of being most justly adjudged to be 7 of all impious persons 7 the worst and most impious.
Athen.
Let us say, then, that the three subjects proposed, namely, that the gods exist and have a care of (all things), 1 and that they are not to be drawn aside (by entreaties) con­ trary to what is just, have been demonstrated sufficiently.
Clin.
How not ?
and we give our votes together in favour of these reasonings.
Athen.
The arguments have however been somehow stated with greater vehemence through the love of contention in bad men.
But, friend Clinias, this love of contention has been in­ dulged in on this account, that wicked persons may not imagine that, by being the masters in words, they have a licence to do what they please, (according to) 2 3 what and of what magnitude and of what kind 3 they conceive of the gods.
There has then arisen a readiness on this account, to speak in rather a novel 4 manner.
But if we have done even a little of moment to­ wards persuading somehow the (three) 5 men to hate them­ selves and to love manners quite the reverse, the prelude to the laws relating to impiety will have been spoken by us to a good purpose.
Clin.
There is a hope at least;
but should (the event be) not so, this kind of discourse will bring no blame upon the lawgiver.[15.]
Athen.
After the prelude, then, such a discourse as is the interpreter of the laws, would follow 6 correctly, pro­ claiming to all impious persons, that they must stand apart from their depraved manners, and (betake themselves) to such as are pious.
But against those, who are not persuaded, let this be the law relating to impiety.
If any one is impious in word or deed, let any one who happens to be present repel him by giving information to the magistrates;
and let the magistrate, who first hears of it, bring, according to law, the party before the court of justice appointed for such matters.
But if any magistrate, on hearing of it, does not act so, let him be accused of impiety by any one, who is willing to be the avenger on behalf of the laws.
And if any one is convicted, let the court of justice fix a fine against each person1 for each act of impiety.
And let a prison in the case of all be assigned, since 2 there are three prisons in the city;
one in common for the generality of crimes committed about the Market-place, for the sake of safety to the majority of persons ;
another by the spot, where meetings take place at night, and which has the name of the House of Correction ;
and another in the middle of the country, where the locality is most solitary and wild,3 and 4 having as an appellation of punishment some ill name.
4 5
There being respecting impiety three causes which we have gone through ;
and since from each of such-like causes two are produced, there will be six kinds of crimes against the gods ;
which, 1 as being worthy of a distinction,1 require neither an equal nor a similar punishment.
For to him, who may think that gods do not exist at all, there may be a naturally just habit (of' mind);
and such become the haters of the wicked ;
and through their bearing ill with injustice, they do not give themselves up to committing actions of that kind, and they avoid the unjust, and love the just.
2
But upon whom, in addition to their opinion that all things are destitute of the gods, there falls a want of self-control in pleasures and pains, and to whom there is present a strong memory and a quickness in learning, the notion that gods do not exist, would be one circumstance com­ mon to both ;
but in the mischief done to the rest of mankind, one effects less of evil, the other more ;
2 for the one would in word be full of a freedom of speech on the subject of the gods, and about sacrifices and oaths, and, laughing at the others, he would perhaps render the rest like himself, should he not meet with punishment.
But the other, who thinks as the former does, is called by the vulgar clever,3 but is full of fraud and strata­ gem;
4 from whom many diviners are produced, and such as are excited5 with respect to every kind of witchcraft;
and sometimes, too, from them are produced tyrants, and mob­ orators, and army-leaders;
and those, who plot against6 private mysteries,7 and with the plans of men called so­ phists.
Of these indeed there are many species.
But two of them are worthy of legislation ;
one of which the ironic8 errs in a way to deserve not one or two deaths, (but more) ;
1 but the other requires admonition and bonds.
In like manner the notion that the gods are careless, produces two errors;
and that they are easily turned aside, another two.
Of these persons, so placed apart, such as have become so through folly, without a vicious frowardness and manners, let the judge 2 appointed by law,2 put into the House of Correc­ tion, for not less than five years ;
and during that time, let no one of the citizens converse with them, except those, who participating in the assembly by night,3 associate for the pur­ pose of admonition and the safety of the soul.
And when the period of their imprisonment expires, if any one amongst them appears to be modestly behaved, let him dwell together with the modest;
but if not, and he is again convicted on such a suit, let him pay the penalty of death.
But such as, in addition to their believing that gods do not exist, or that they are careless, or easily turned aside, become brute-like, and de­ spising mankind, allure the souls of many while living, and pretend they can allure too the souls of the dead, and pro­ mise they can 4persuade the gods, as bewitching them with sacrifices, and prayers, and incantations,4 and who endeavour by these means to destroy utterly individuals and whole fami­ lies and cities, for the sake of their property;
amongst these whoever shall be deemed to be convicted, let the court of justice determine that he is to be imprisoned5 according to law in the prison of the midland district;
and let no free-man be ever allowed to visit him ;
but let the food, appointed for him by the guardians of the laws, be brought to him by servants ;
and, when he dies, let him be cast out, beyond the boundaries of the country, unburied ;
and if any free-men shall 6together bury him,6 let the party undergo the punishment for impiety through any person who is willing to obtain by lot a trial.
1
If he leaves behind him children, sufficient2 for the state, let the guardians of orphans take care of these likewise, as being orphans not less than the others, from the day, on which their father was convicted.
But it is meet for a common law to be established in all these cases, such as shall cause the masses to behave less im­ properly towards the gods, both in word and deed, and may render them moreover less devoid of intellect, through not per­ mitting them to attend to sacred matters in a manner contrary to law.
Now let this law be laid down simply for all together.
Let no one practise sacred rites in a private d welling.
3
But when it enters into the mind of any one to sacrifice, let him go to the public buildings, and there sacrifice ;
and let him place his offerings in the hands of the priests and priestesses, to whom the holy ritual is a care ;
and let him pray, both himself and whoever else may wish to join with him in prayer.
And let this take place on this account.
It is not easy to build temples and place statues of the gods ;
but to do such things correctly, is the work of some mighty intellect.
But it is a custom with all women especially, and all4 men in sickness, or in danger, or in want, and, on the contrary, when they receive an abundance of any thing, ever to consecrate that which is at hand, and to vow sacrifices, and to promise statues to the gods, and to dæmons, and to the sons of the gods;
when they are awakened by frightful5 apparitions, and in dreams bring up the recollection of many visions likewise;
against all of which things they endeavour to make for each of themselves6 remedies, by filling all the streets 7 and all the villages with altars and chapels, and fixing them in purified places, and 8wherever a person has met with such events.
8
On account of all which things it is meet to act according to the law now mentioned, and on account moreover of the impious ;
in order that they may not, after acting fraudulently by such doings, put up al­ tars in their private dwellings;
and, thinking to render the gods propitious by sacrifices and prayers in secret, increase injustice unlimitedly, and give rise to accusations on the part of the gods against them and those, who permitted them (to do so), although the latter were themselves 1 the best of all ;
1 and thus the whole city meet2 justly, after a certain manner, with mis­ chief through the impious.
The god, however, shall not blame the lawgiver.
For let the law be laid down that no one is to have holy places in private houses;
and the party, who is discovered as having other places and performing orgies, except such as are public, let the person, who is cognizant of it, denounce to the guardians of the laws ;
and let them, 3 if a man or a woman has it, not having committed any great or impious crime,3 or­ der the parties to carry their private sacred affairs to the pub­ lic places ;
and not persuading,4 let them punish with a fine, until they are carried.
But, if any one shall be conspicuously committing, 5not the impious deed of unholy boys, but of men,5 whether by sacrificing6 to the gods in private or in public temples, let him be condemned to death, as one who has sacrificed, not being pure;
and let the guardians of the laws, 7 after deciding, whether there is (any impiety) or not, on the part of the children, bring it before a court of justice,7 and thus put in their case a finish to the trial for impiety.[1.]
AFTER these, the compacts with each other would re­ quire from us a suitable regulation.
Now a thing of this kind at least is surely simple.
1 Let no one touchy as far as possible, my property, nor disturb the least thing (of mine), without previously persuading me;
and may I, possessing a well-disposed mind, act in the same manner with respect to the property of others.
Let us then, in the first place, speak about such a treasure,2 as a person 3not descended from my parents,3 has placed as a thing to be kept both for himself and those belonging to him, and which may I never pray to the gods to find, nor, on finding, to disturb;
4 nor on the other hand to communicate with those called diviners, who in some sort ad­ vise me to take up the deposit put into the ground.
4
For I should never be so much benefited by the possession of pro­ perty, should I take it up, as I should increase in the virtue of the soul and in justice by not taking it to myself, 5 (and) by acquiring one possession instead of another, a better in a better, (and) preferring justice in the soul to wealth, to hold it as a property in preference.
5
For on many occasions it is well said—“ Do not disturb what ought not to be dis­ turbed—” and it may be said on this too, as being one of them.
It is likewise meet to be persuaded by the stories1 told re­ lating to these matters, that things of this kind do not contri­ bute to the procreation of children.
Now he, who is careless of children, and disregards the enactment of the lawgiver, and takes up that, which neither he nor his grandfather had de­ posited, such a one destroys the most beautiful and simple law, which has been laid down by a man,2 ignoble by no means, which says, " Thou shalt not take away that, which thou hast not deposited."
What then he ought to suffer at the hands of the gods, who, disregarding these two lawgivers, takes up a trifling thing, which he did not deposit himself, but is some­ times a mighty treasure, the god3 knows;
4(but let us de­ clare what he ought to suffer from men.)
4
Let him, who first sees (the offender) give information, if such an event happens in the city, to the City-Stewards ;
if in the market- place of the city,5 to the Market-Stewards;
and, if in any other part of the country, point him out to the Rural-Stew­ ards and to their chiefs;
and when the parties have been pointed out, let the city send to Delphi;
and whatever the god gives as an oracle respecting the money and the person who has removed it, let the city perform, and be the minister to the oracle;
and if the informer is a free-man, let him have a reputation for virtue ;
but, not informing, for wickedness;
but if he is a slave, let him for informing be made, and justly so, free by the city, paying the value to his owner ;
but not revealing it, let him be punished with death.
This enactment there would in due order follow this same1 law relating to matters great and small, 2(so as) to follow.
2
If a man leaves any property of his own willingly or unwillingly, let him, who may happen to meet with it, suffer it to remain, conceiving that the dæmon, who presides over roads, watches over things of this kind, that are dedicated to the deity 3 by the law.
When any one shall be 4 disobedient to the enactment, and, contrary to it,4 take up and carry home any thing of little worth, let him, if a slave, receive many stripes from any one not less than thirty years of age, who may happen to meet him.
But, if he is a free-man, let him in addition to his being considered ungentleman-like5 and out of the pale of the law, pay as a fine to the party, who left it, ten-fold the value of what he took up.
When any one accuses another of de­ taining his property, whether it be much or little, and the party (who detains it) acknowledges that he has it, but (denies) that it is the other's property, if there be a written statement relating to the property laid before the magistrates according to law, let the plaintiff call the detaining party before the magistrate, and let the latter place the property in court ;
6 and the matter being rendered clear, if the property mentioned in the written statement shall appear to belong to either of the contending parties, let him have it and depart.
But if it be­ longs to some of those, who are not present, whichever party shall in favour of the absent owner produce trust-worthy bail, that he will deliver it up to him, 1 let the party (so producing the bail) take the property away, according to the right of taking away in the absent party.
1
But if the property in dispute be not stated in writing before the magistrates, let it lie under the charge of the three oldest magistrates until the trial;
and if the property under security be 2a thing requiring food,2 let the party defeated in the suit respecting it, pay the magis­ trates for its keep;
and let the magistrates decide the ques­ tion within three days.[2.]
3
Let any one who wishes, provided he is in his senses, take his own slave and treat him as he pleases, in whatever way it is holy, and let him on behalf of a relation or friend, for their security, lead the slave (to punishment) who has re­ volted.
3
But if any one takes away another person, as if the latter were a slave led away, on the ground 4 of giving him freedom, let the party so leading let ( the other) go;
and let the person taking away, on producing three trust-worthy bail, take away on these conditions,4 but otherwise not.
And if a person takes away contrary to these conditions, let him be amenable to the laws relating to acts of violence;
and on being cast, pay to the party, who has taken away,5 double of the damage which has been stated in the pleadings.
And let a person lead (to punishment) his freed-man, if he does not attend to those, who have made him free, (at all) or not sufficiently.
Now the attention is in the freed-man going thrice in the month to the hearth of the party, who had made him free, and engaging to do whatever is requisite of acts just and in his power;
and as regards marriage, to do whatever seems good to his lord.
And let it not be lawful for him to possess more wealth than the person who made him free;
and let the overplus belong to his lord.
And let a freed-man remain not longer than twenty years, but like 1 the rest of strangers 1 depart, taking his whole property with him, unless he can persuade the magistrates and the party who made him free.
And if the property of a freed person, or of any other stranger, is more than that of the census, the third in magnitude, let him within 2 thirty days from that on which this occurs3 take his property and depart;
nor let there be granted to him by the magistrates a request for a further stay.
And if any one disobeys them, let him be brought before a court of justice, and after being convicted, let him be punished with death, and his wealth become public property.
And let the suits in these cases be4 amongst the suits relating to parishes,4 unless the parties are previously freed 5 from the accusations against each other in the presence of neighbours or chosen judges.
And if any one lays his hand upon an animal or any thing else whatever, as being his own property, let him who has possession of it bring (the claimant) to the party who sold or gave it, being trust-worthy, and having the right to do so, or who handed it over in any manner with authority,l in the case of a citizen, or a settler in the city, (within) thirty days, but in the case of a transfer by a stranger, within five months, the middle of which 2 is the month in which 3the summer sun turns to the win­ ter.
3
And whatever articles one person exchanges with another by sale or purchase, let them thus make the ex­ change, by one party giving and the other receiving on the instant the value in the place appointed for each kind of ar­ ticles in the market-place, and no where else ;
and let no one engage in the purchase or sale of an article on credit.
4
But if any one person barters with another any thing whatever for any thing whatever in any other manner or in any other place, by trusting the party, who is making the exchange, let a per­ son act in this way towards him, as no action will lie accord­ ing to law, respecting articles, that have not been purchased according to what is here detailed.
6
With respect to joint contributions, let any who is willing ask a contribution as a friend amongst friends ;
but if any difference arises respecting the payment of the contribution,7 let the parties act thus,8 as there will be no action against any one on such matters.
6
Whoever sells an article and receives for it a price of not less than fifty drachms, let him remain of necessity ten days in the city;
and let the buyer know the residence of the seller, for the sake of the complaints which usually take place on such matters, and the return of the articles according to law.
Now let the return or not, according to law, be in this way.
If a person sells a slave labouring under a consumption, or the stone, or a strangury, or the disease called sacred, 1 or any other malady not apparent to the many, of long standing and incurable, whether of the body or mind, if the sale be to a physician or a master of gymnastics, there is to be no return ;
nor yet, when the seller tells beforehand the (whole) truth to any one;
but if a handicraftsman sells to a person not in trade an article of such a kind, let the buyer return the article, except in the case of (a slave affected) with the sacred disease, within six months;
but in the case of the disease, let it be lawful' to make the return within a year;
and let the matter be decided before some physicians, whom the parties may bring forward and select in common, and let the party defeated pay double the value for which the party sold it.
But if a party not in trade sells to another not in trade, let the re­ turn and decision take place in the manner mentioned above ;
and let the party defeated pay simply the value.
If any one knowingly sells to another knowingly a slave, who has killed any person, let him have no return in the case of a purchase of this kind;
but to a person not knowing, let there be a return then, when any buyer becomes aware of it;
and let the de­ cision rest with the five youngest guardians of the laws;
and if it is decided that the seller was cognizant of the fact, let a person purify the residence of the buyer according to the law of the sacred interpreters, and let the seller pay the purchaser triple the sum.[3.]
Let him who exchanges either money for money, or any thing whatever for things of life or not of life, give and receive every thing unadulterated, following out the law.
Let us however receive2 a prelude, as in the case of other laws, so likewise with respect to the whole of this wrong.
It is meet for every man to consider adulteration, and lying, and fraud, as forming one genus ;
to which it is usual for the multitude to apply the saying, although speaking improperly, that when such a conduct is adopted opportunely, on each occasion, it often turns out well.
But as they leave the occasion, and the where, and the when, in an unregulated and undefined state, they do by this assertion much injury to themselves and to others.
But it is not fitting for the legislator to leave this undefined;
but he ought always to state clearly the greater and lesser limits.
Let them be determined now.
Let no one who is not about to be the most odious to the gods, perpetrate, either by word or deed, a falsehood, or fraud, or adulteration in any thing, when calling (to witness) the race of the gods.
Now such is (in the first place) 1 he, who while swearing false oaths, thinks nothing of the gods ;
and secondly he, who speaks falsely before those who are better than himself.
Now the better are superior to the bad, both the elder, to speak in ge­ neral terms, than the younger, and parents [better] 2 than their offspring, and men than women and children, and go­ vernors than the governed ;
3 all of whom it is becoming for all to reverence in every other government,3 and especially in political offices, 4 for the sake of which 4 the present convers­ ation has come upon us.
For every one of those in the market-place, who by adulterating any thing perpetrates a falsehood and a fraud, and calling upon the gods takes an oath,5 according to the regulations and precautions of the Market-Stewards, is a person who has no regard for men nor reverence for the gods.
6
It is indeed a beautiful institution not to defile the names of the gods, while a person is taking it easily, as the majority of us do on each occasion as regards the greater part of a pure and holy conduct in what relates to the gods.
6
If then a person is not persuaded 1 (by these reason­ ings),1 let this be the law.
Let the seller of any thing in the market-place never mention two prices of what he is selling;
but after mentioning a simple one, if he does not meet with it, let him take the article back again, and justly so, nor value it for that day at a greater or less sum.
Let puffing 2 and oaths be absent in the case of every thing sold.
And if a person is disobedient to these enactments, let any citizen, not less than thirty years of age, who happens to be present, pun­ ish the party swearing, and strike him with impunity ;
and if he neglects to do so, and is himself disobedient (to the law), let him be amenable to blame for his betrayal of the laws.
And let him, 3 who falls in with those who know 3 the seller of an adulterated article, and unable 4 to obey the present reasonings, if he is able himself to detect the party, expose (the fraud) before the magistrates, and if he is a slave or a settler, let him carry off5 the adulterated article.
But let the citizen, who does not expose (the fraud), be proclaimed a bad man, as one who defrauds the gods:
but if he ex­ poses it, let him offer up (the adulterated article) to the gods, who preside over the market-place.
6
And let him, who has been discovered selling any thing of this kind, in addition to his being deprived of the adulterated article, be scourged with as many lashes from a whip as there are drachms in the sum at which he valued the article, by the hands of the crier, proclaiming in the market-place the reason of his being about to be whipped.
And let the Market-Stewards and the guardians of the laws, after hearing from those who are skilled in each of the adulterations and evil practices of the sellers, write out 1 what the seller ought and ought not to do ;
1 and let them, after writing down the laws that are to afford clear information to those engaged in business about the market- place,2 put them upon a pillar before 3the court belonging to the Market-Stewards.
3
But the particulars relating to the City-Stewards have been sufficiently detailed above.
Should it however appear that any thing more is wanting, let them communicate with the guardians of the laws, and writing down what seems to be wanting, let them place on a pillar at the court belonging to the City-Stewards, the first and second regulations, as laid down by their authority.[4.]
To the business of adulteration 4 there follows on its heel5 those of the huckster's trade.
But about the whole of this let us first give advice According to reason, (and)6 after­ wards a law respecting it.
For the whole of huckstering in a city does not exist for the sake of doing an injury, at least naturally, but the reverse.
For how is not every onea bene­ factor, who causes the existence of property of any kind so­ ever, that is out of measure and unequably (diffused), to become so equably in measure ? 7
This it is meet for us to acknow­ ledge, and to work out the power of money;
and it is necessary to say that the merchant is ordained for this;
and the person who is hired, and the tavern-keeper, and other trades, that are some, more genteel, and some, less, have all this power, to show assistance to all in need, and to cause an equality in property.
7
But let us see why this seems to be neither honourable nor becoming, and why it happens to lead to calumny, in order that, although we may not cure the whole by a law, yet we may at least a part.
1 Clin.
This, as it seems, is no trifling matter, and requires no little virtue.
Athen.
How say you, friend Clinias ?
1 2 A race of men small and naturally few,2 and brought up with a superior education, are, when they fall into want and a desire for certain things, able to bear up with moderation;
and when they have it in their power to acquire great wealth, behave soberly, and pre­ fer that, which borders on moderation, to excess.
But the mass of mankind conduct themselves in a manner perfectly the reverse of this;
for they desire without measure;
and when they have it in their power to obtain a moderate gain, they prefer to have a gain that never satisfies.
Hence all the races of men engaged in trades 3 retail and wholesale,3 and as tavern-keepers, have been calumniated and subject to dis­ graceful reproaches.
For should any one-which never may it happen, nor ever will—compel—4 what it is ridiculous indeed to say, yet said it shall be4—the best of men in every way to keep a tavern for a certain time, or to be a huckster, or to do any thing of this kind, or even 5 women (the most holy) 5 through some necessity of fate, to take part in an employment of such a kind, we should know that each of these is 1 honest and laudable,1 and that 2 if they occurred uncorrupted ac­ cording to reason,2 all such acts would be honoured, as belong­ ing to the character of a mother and a nurse.
But now, since some one has for the sake of a retail trade established dwell­ ings in solitary places, and, having in every direction a length of road, receives in much-desired resting-places those unable to proceed, or affords a warm and quiet spot to those driven3 by the violence of severe weather, and a cool one in hot;
and afterwards having them received as friends, does not give them 4 symbols of friendship5 subsequent to their reception,5 but, Gas as if they were enemies taken in war and in their power, lets them go for a ransom very great, and unjust, and not to be cleansed 6 -these actions and such as these, having been disgracefully 7 committed by all persons of this kind, have correctly 7 furnish­ ed a ground of calumny against the assistance given to distress.
Against these the lawgiver ought therefore to prepares a remedy.
For the saying9 of old is correct, that against two opposite things it is hard to fight, as in the case of diseases and many other things.
But at present the contest is against these two things, poverty and wealth;
the latter of which corrupts the soul of man through luxury, while the former turns itself through pain to shamelessness of every kind.
1
What protection, then, will there be against this disease in a state endued with intellect ?
In the first place, let it make use, to the utmost of its power, of the fewest in number of the race of hucksters;
next, we enjoin 2such trades upon some2 of those persons, from whose corruption there would be not a great mischief to the state;
and thirdly, to discover a plan in the case of those, who take a part in these occupations, how their morals may not happen to become freely partakers in impudence and in feelings unfitted for free-men.
Let then, after what has now been stated, a law of this kind take place, with a good fortune relating to these matters.
Of the Magnesians, whom a god is again raising up and settling into a colony, let no one amongst such as have a share in the land, and pos­ sess hearths amounting 3 to five thousand and forty,3 either willingly or unwillingly become a retail or wholesale dealer, nor hold any situation whatever under individuals, who are not upon an equality with himself, except under a father or mother, and those 4 who are still higher up in birth than these,4 and all who are older than himself, and (live)5 like free-men in a free manner.
It is not however easy to legislate for what is gen­ tleman-like or ungentlemanly.
Let however a distinction be made by those, who have obtained the prize of excellence, by their hatred and reception of these doings (respectively).
Let then any one, who is willing, indict, on the charge of dis­ gracing his family, the person, who takes a part in any trickery of an ungentlemanly huckstering;
and if he shall appear to have defiled his paternal hearth by any unworthy employ­ ment, let him, after being in bonds for a year, abstain from such employment;
and if he does so again, for two years;
and on each conviction let him not cease doubling the pre­ vious period.
A second law ordains, moreover, that a person must be a settler or a stranger, who is to follow a retail trade.
And a third one (ordains this) the third, 1 in order that the best character, or one the least improper, may be a fellow- dweller in the city, that it is requisite2 for the guardians of the law to consider that they are the guardians not only of those, whom it is easy to guard against, when (acting) contrary to the law, and becoming wicked-such, I mean, as are well born and have been well brought up—but that they ought to guard still more against persons, who are not of such a kind, and who follow pursuits, that possess a powerful in­ centive3 to their becoming bad.
4
Such then are the circum­ stances4 relating to retail trade, which is extensive, and embraces many occupations.
Respecting then such of these, as may be left, through their being thought to be, from a great necessity, requisite in a state, it behoves the guardians of the laws to come again together with those skilled in retail trades, as we before enjoined in the case of adulteration, an occupation allied to this;
and, after coming together, to see what receipts and outlay produce a moderate profit to the re­ tail dealer ;
5 and after writing down the outlay and receipts, to lay down the result,5 and, to watch over it, in some matters the Market-Stewards, in others the City-Stewards, and in others the Rural-Stewards.
And thus will retail trading be of service in some points on nearly every occasion,6 and be of the least disservice to those, who make use of it in states.[5.]
1
Whatever compact a person acknowledges to have made, if he does not act according to the acknowledgment, except in cases where laws or a decree prevent him, or where he has made the acknowledgment through being compelled by some unjust necessity, or if he is prevented unwillingly by an unexpected accident, let an action lie against him 2 in the legal suits relating to the tribes,2 for an acknowledgment not com­ pleted in other respects, unless the parties are able to come to a reconciliation previously, in the presence of arbitrators or neigh­ bours.
1
The race of artificers is sacred to Hephæstus and Athéné, 3who jointly fit up our life by their arts ;
3 while, on the other hand, they, who preserve the works of artificers by other arts of a defensive kind, are (sacred) to Ares and Athéné.
And justly too is this race sacred to those gods ;
for all these are through life attending to the country and people;
some by pre­ siding over the contests of war;
others by bringing to an effect the production by hire of instruments and works ;
to whom it would not be a becoming act to tell a falsehood about these mat­ ters, while reverencing the gods, their progenitors.
4
If then any operative shall, through improper conduct, not complete his work by the stated time, and, paying no reverence to the god, who is the giver of life, conceive, seeing nothing with his mind's eye, that a god, as being of his own kindred, will pardon him, such a one will, in the first place, suffer punishment from the god himself;
and secondly,5 let a law be laid down conformably to this ;
5 and let him be bound to pay the value of the work, of which he has defrauded by a falsehood the party, who gave it out;
and let him complete it again from the commencement within the stated time gratuitously.
And as the law has ad­ vised the seller not to make an attempt (on the purchaser) by valuing (an article) 1 at more than its worth, but in all simpli­ city at its worth-for the operative knows the value-so does it advise in the case of a person undertaking a job, and gives the same order.
In cities, therefore, of free-men, it is not meet for the operative himself to make an attempt upon un­ skilled individuals by his own skill in an art, which is a thing naturally clear and devoid of falsehood ;
but (it is meet) for an action to lie on this ground in behalf of the person injured against the party doing the wrong.
If then any one, after giving out work to an operative, does not pay him his wages, according to the agreement legally drawn up, but by dishonour­ ing Zeus, the guardian of the city, and Athéné, 2(both) sharing in the polity,2 and, by being in love with a little gain, shall loosen 3 great societies, let there be a law to assist, conjointly with the gods, the binding together of the state.
For let him, who, after he 4 has bargained for work and got hold of it,4 does not pay the wages at the time agreed upon, be sued for double the amount.
5
And if a year has elapsed, while all the other monies are without interest, which a person confers as a loan, let him put down the interest at the rate6 of an obolus,5 for a drachm monthly, and let the cause be tried in the courts of justice7 belonging to the tribes.
As, however, (we have made mention)8 incidentally of those, who in war are the workers of safety, and of army-leaders, and such as are artists in these matters, 'it is (only) just to say that we have been re­ minded of operatives altogether, as in the case of these being again, like those, as it were other operatives.'
If then any one even of these undertakes a public work, either voluntarily or from a command,2 and executes it beautifully, (and)3 the law justly pays him in honours, which are the wages of men skilled in war, 4 such a law one will never be tired of praising ;
4 5 but he will blame it, if it does not pay, after it has bargained for and got hold of any work of those [works]6 that are beautiful in war.
5
Let then this law mingled with praise be laid down by us respecting these matters, in the form of advice, and not of compulsion, to the mass of the citizens, namely, to pay second­ ary honours to brave men, who are the saviours of the whole state, whether by their valour, or by stratagems in war;
for let the greatest guerdon be given to those the first, who have been able 7 to honour pre-eminently the writings of good legislators.[6.]
The greatest of compacts, that men have with each other, except such as relate to orphans, and the guardians of orphans, have been laid down by us in due order, in nearly (the best manner).
8
It is necessary however, after what has been now detailed, to arrange these matters at least in some manner.
Now of all these is the desire 1 of those about to die respecting their will, and the circumstances of those who have made no will.
I have said it is necessary, Clinias, from looking at the harsh and difficult temper of such persons;
nor is it possible to leave the point unarranged.
For each party would, 2previous to his being about to make his Will,2 intro­ duce many clauses at variance with each other, and contrary to the laws, and the manners of the living, and their pro­ genitors, if one gave a power for a will to be effective, simply in the manner, that a person may have made it in whatever state he might be towards the end of life.
For most of us, when we think we are about to die, are in a certain manner silly in mind, and broken down in spirit.
3
Clin.
How say you this, 0 guest ?
Athen.
A man, Clinias, when about to die, is morose, and full of language very terrible to legislators, and difficult (to treat with).
Clin.
In what way ?
Athen.
Seeking to be the master of all things, he is wont to speak with anger.
Athen.
It is a shocking thing, 0 ye gods, says he, if I am not permitted to give my property to whomsoever I please, 4 and not 4 to one person more, and to another less, amongst such as have evidently behaved ill or well towards me, after they have been tested sufficiently, (some) 5 during my disorders, and others during my old age, and in other circumstances of various kinds.
Clin.
Does he 6 then, 0 guest, not appear to you to speak correctly ?
Athen.
The lawgivers of old appear to me, Clinias, to have been cowards, and to have legislated, while they were looking to 1and thinking upon 1 a trifling portion 2 of human affairs.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
Terrified at this language (of the dying man),3 they laid down this 4 law, that it should be lawful for any one, to dispose of his property without exception entirely as he pleased.
But I and you will answer those in your state about to die, in a more careful manner.
A then.
0 friends, we will say, 6 who exist really but for a day,6 it is a difficult thing for you to know, your own affairs, and yourselves to boot, as the writing of the Pythian (priestess) 7 says at present.
I, therefore, as being a legislator, lay down that neither yourselves are your own property, nor this sub­ stance of yours, but that they belong to the whole of your family, both past and to come ;
and further still, that both the whole of your family and substance belong to the state ;
and this being the case, should any one by flattery insinuate him­ self8 into your favour, either during a disorder or when you are tost about by old age, and persuade you to dispose of your pro­ perty by will in not the best manner, I shall not willingly agree to it;
but looking to all that is the best both for the whole state, and your family, I will lay down laws 1 by justly putting to a less account that which belongs to each individual.
1
May you, therefore, be mild and well-disposed towards us, and proceed in the path, 2 in which you are now, according to man's nature, journeying ;
2 while of the rest of your concerns it will be for us to be the guardians, by taking, to the utmost of our power, a care (of every thing),3 and not of merely some, but not of others.
Let this then, Clinias, be 4 the consolation for the dead, and for the living this the prelude (of the law) ;
4 but this the law itself.[7.]
Let him, who makes a will, disposing of his property, if he is a father of children, appoint first whichever of his sons he thinks proper to be his heir, but of his other children whichever he gives to another person to adopt, let this too be written down.
And if any of his sons survive him, after hav­ ing been adopted, but not with any heir-property, and of whom there is an expectation that he will be sent to a colony accord­ ing to law, let the father be permitted to give him from his other property what he pleases, except the paternal allotment, and all the chattels belonging to it.
And if there are more children, let their father distribute in shares the remainder of the allotment in whatever manner he pleases.
But whichever of the sons possesses a house, let him not leave to such a one any money.
To a daughter, in like manner, to whom a man has been affianced, 5 [that he may be about to be her husband,] 5 let him not give a share;
but to her, who is not betrothed, let him give a share.
And if any allotment in the country shall be found to be in the hands of any of the sons or daughters, after the will has been made, let it be left6 for the heir of the party who has made the will.
And if the testator has no sons, but daughters, let him write down what man he would wish as the husband for any of his daughters, and as the son-in-law for himself.
And if the son of any one, whether natural or adopted, happens to die before he could be enrolled amongst men, let the testator mention this circumstance in the will, and signify whom he wishes to be his son in his stead with better fortune.
And if any one without children makes a will, let him select the tenth part of his property, beyond the allotment, and give it to whom he pleases;
but all the rest let him give without blame to his adopted son, and make for himself, ac­ cording to law, a son kindly disposed.
And in the case of a person whose children require guardians, if, after having made his will, he dies, and has mentioned as guardian for his children parties of the number and kind he wishes, and who are will­ ing and agree to act as guardians, let the selection of the guar­ dians be according to what has been written down in full force.
But if a person dies intestate, if there is 1 any thing deficient in the selection1 of the guardians, let the next of kin, two on the father's side, and two on the mother's, and one from among the friends of the deceased, have power to act as guardians;
and these let the guardians of the law appoint ( as guardians) to any orphan, who is in want of them.
And of the whole care of orphans, let fifteen of the guardians of the laws, who are the oldest, have the charge 2ever according to seniority;
and having divided themselves into threes, let three (act) in one year, and in another year three others, until the five periods are ac­ complished in a circle ;
2 and let no one fail in this duty to the best of his power.
But should any one die without having made a will at all, and leave children that require a guardian, let the indigent state of the children share in the same laws.
And should any one, meeting with an unexpected misfortune, leave behind him daughters, let him pardon the legislator if, looking to two things out of three, namely, proximity of race, and the preservation of the allotment, he makes provision for the giving the daughters in marriage;
but the third point, to which the father would have attended, namely,1 by looking to habits and manners,1 (to select)2 from all the citizens a fitting son for himself and a husband for his daughter, he omits, through the consideration of it being an impossibility.
Let then this law be laid down relating to matters of this kind.
If any one, dying intestate, leaves behind him daughters, 3 let the brother on the father's or mother's side, if he is without an allotment, take the daughter and the allotment of the deceased.
But if there is not a brother, let a brother's son ( do so) in like manner, if the cousins are of a sufficient age.
And if there is not one of these left, let the son of (the father's) sister (act) in the same way, and let the fourth after these be the father's brother;
the fifth, the son of this (brother);
and the sixth, the son of the father's sister;
3 and in like manner let the race be continued perpetually by consanguinity, if a person leaves behind daughters, proceeding through brothers and cousins, first the males, and afterwards the females, in one family.
And let the judge on reflection determine the fitness or unfit­ ness of the time of marriage, by looking at the males naked, and at the females naked, as far as the navel.
And if there is a want of kindred to families, as far as the sons of brothers, and as far too as the children of grandfathers, whomsoever of the other citizens, being willing, the girl shall of her own free-will select, with the consent of her guardians, let that person become the heir of the deceased, and the husband of his daughter.
Further still, there might be 5 a great want of many things, and a still greater of persons of this kind,5 at some time in this very state.
Should then a female, 6 being in want of nuptials,6 see any one going from hence to a colony, and it is in her mind for that person to be the heir of her father's property, provided he is a relation, let him enter upon the al­ lotment according to the arrangement of the laws.
1But if he is out of the family, those in the city being out of rela­ tionship,l let him have the power, through the selection of the guardians and of the daughter of the deceased, to marry her, and returning home, to take the allotment of the intestate.
And if any one, who has no male or female children at all, dies intestate, let other matters hold good respecting such a per­ son, according to the aforesaid law;
but let a female and a male go, as joint-sharers, from his family to the dwelling, on each occasion deserted ;
and to them let the allotment belong as owners;
and let a sister (enter) first;
a brother's daughter, second ;
a sister's offspring, third ;
a sister of the father, fourth ;
a daughter of the father's brother, fifth ;
and a daughter of the father's sister, sixth.
Let these females live together with those (males) according to affinity and lawful­ ness, as we have previously laid down by law.
Nor let the weighty nature of laws of this kind lie hid from us, that some­ times it harshly ordains the relation of a deceased person to marry a relation.
2(For he who introduces a law of this kind,)2 does not appear to consider that 3ten thousand impedi­ ments arise, so as to render a person unwilling to comply with mandates of this kind ;
and that there are those, who would suffer any thing whatever, when diseases and maimings in body or mind come upon some of those ordained by law to marry, or be married.
The legislator then will perhaps seem, not correctly so, to some, to pay no regard to these matters.
Let this then be stated, as if it were a prelude in common, both for the lawgiver, and the party to whom laws are given;
which re­ quests 4 those under laws to grant a pardon to the legislator, be­ cause, while he is taking care of public concerns, he cannot at the same time regulate the circumstances that occur to each in- dividual likewise;
and, on the other hand, 1 (the legislator to grant) 1 a pardon to those under laws ;
since they are sometimes unable, and reasonably so, to perform the commandments of the legislator, which, ignorant 2(of private circumstances,)2 he has ordained.
Clin.
By doing what then, 0 guest, will a person be the most in measure in such a case ?
A then.
It is necessary, Clinias, to choose arbitrators between laws of this kind, and for those governed by them.
Clin.
How say you ?
A then.
Sometimes 3the son of a rich father3 would not be willing to marry the daughter of his uncle,4 through being given to luxury and keeping his thoughts upon a greater con­ nexion ;
5and sometimes too, while the legislator is enjoining the greatest calamity, he would be compelled by necessity to disobey the law, which forces6 him to accept an alliance with a mad woman, or other terrible calamities of body or soul, and by possessing them, to live a life not to be endured.
5
Let then this law, which has been just now spoken of,7 be laid down by us.
If any persons find fault with the laws laid down relating to wills and any thing else whatever, and marriages to boot, (by saying)8 that if the legislator himself were 9present and living,9 he would never compel a person to act thus, nor would those compelled to marry, or to be married, do either ;
or should any of the family or any guardian assert, that (as) the lawgiver had left the fifteen of the guardians of the laws to appear1 as arbitrators and parents to male and female orphans, to these 2 let those go, who are contesting about any of such like mat­ ters, and by them be adjudged, and bring to an end their decrees as being decisive.
But should it seem to any one that too great a power has been given to the guardians of the law, let him carry the matter to the tribunal of selected jurymen, and decide the question about contested points ;
and upon him, who is defeated by the legislator, 3let blame and re­ proach lie, a fine in the eyes of him, who possesses a mind, more heavy than a mass of money.3[8.]
And now there would be, as it were, a second birth to orphans.
After the first the nurture and education for each have been spoken of.
4
But after the second, rendered deso­ late by the want of fathers, it is meet to devise by what means the misfortune of their orphanhood may excite the least pos­ sible pity for their misfortune in the case of those who have become orphans.
4
First then, we assert that we assign by law to them the guardians of the laws to be not worse parents, in the place of those who begat them;
and we ordain moreover, that for each year they take a care of them, as if they were their own.
5
And such is the prelude we have given with care5 to them and the guardians, relating to the bringing up of or­ phans.
For we appear to have detailed at some fitting time in the previous discourse, how that the souls of the dead pos­ sess a certain power,6 by which they attend to human affairs.
On this point indeed the reasons are true, but long, through the going round about.
It is necessary likewise to believe in the other traditions relating to matters of this kind, which are so nu­ merous and very old;
and to believe too in those who legislate, unless they seem to be altogether insane, that such is the case.
If then such is naturally the case, let persons fear in the first place the gods above, who have a perception of the desolate state of orphans;
next, the souls of the dead, to whom in the course of nature it belongs to have a care of their own off­ spring, and to be kind to those who do them honour, but hos­ tile towards those who treat them with dishonour;
and further still, the souls of those who are living, but in old age, and in the greatest honours;
1 for to whom there is a state under good laws and prosperous, their 2 children's children live a plea­ sant life, through paying them a proper attention.
3
For all those acutely hear and acutely see every thing 3 relating to these matters, and are kind to those who act justly to these persons, but excessively angry, on the other hand,4 with those, who behave insolently towards orphans and the destitute;
since they deem (such a stated to be a deposit the greatest and the most sacred.
To all of which points it is meet for the guar­ than and magistrate, who possesses the smallest degree of in­ tellect, to direct his attention, and by bestowing his care upon the bringing up and education of orphans, to pay, as it were, a contribution for the benefit of himself and children, and to confer wholly a kindness to the whole of his power.
He then, who is persuaded by this story6 before the law, and does not behave insolently towards an orphan, will never know distinctly the anger of the legislator about matters of this kind.
But let him, who is unpersuaded and does an act of injustice to one deprived of father and mother, suffer a punishment entirely the double of what he would have done from acting evilly to a party whose parents are both alive.
With regard to the remaining portion of legislation ap­ plicable to guardians, in the case of orphans, and to magis­ trates touching their supervision of guardians, if they had not1 themselves a pattern for bringing up free children, in bringing up their own, and taking care of their own property, and laws relating to these very matters stated2 in moderation, there would have been some reason to lay down certain laws for guardians, as differing very much individually from others, and causing to vary by individual pursuits the life of orphans from that of those who are not so.
But now, with respect to every thing of this kind, the care of orphans does not with us differ much from paternal care;
but it is unwilling to be equalized in honour, and dishonour, and in attentiveness.
Hence as regards this very point the law has, by consoling and threat­ ening, attended to the legislation relating to orphans;
and fur­ ther still, a threat of this kind would be very seasonable.
Let him, who is the guardian of a female or a male, and him, who is appointed by the guardians of the law to watch over the guardian, love, not less than his own children, the party who has a share in the misfortune of an orphan;
nor let him pay less attention to the property of the party brought up than to his own, but better than according to the fore­ thought 3 shown to his own.
Let then every one act as a guardian while having this one law relating to orphans.
But if any one acts otherwise (and) contrary to this law in affairs of this kind, let the magistrate fine the guardian.
4
And let the guardian bring the magistrate, (who has acted contrary to the law,) before the tribunal of select (jurymen), and punish him (if convicted) with a fine, that shall have seemed good to the tribunal, two-fold.
4
And if the guar­ dian shall appear to the kindred of the orphans, or to any other of the citizens, to act negligently or viciously, let such party bring him before the same tribunal;
and 1in whatever sum he shall be cast, let him pay the quadruple;
and let one half belong to the child, and the other to the party who brought the charge forward.
When an orphan arrives at pu­ berty, if he thinks that he has been badly treated by his guar­ dian, let him be allowed to obtain by lot a trial relating to guardianship up to 2 five years from the close of the guardian­ ship;
2 and if any guardian is found guilty, let the court of justice fix what he is to suffer (in person), or pay (in purse) ;
and if any magistrate shall appear to have injured an orphan through negligence, let the court of justice fix what he is to pay the child ;
and if through injustice, in addition to the fine, let him be removed from the office of a guardian of the law ;
and let the common power of the state appoint another in his place for the country and the city.[9.]
Greater differences take place between fathers and sons and between sons and fathers, than is proper ;
in which fathers will think that the legislator ought to permit them to renounce, if one wishes it, a son by the public crier, (and to say) he is no longer his own according to law ;
and sons, on the other hand, that they ought to be allowed to indict their fathers on the charge of silliness, when they are disgracefully in that state through disease or old age.
Now these things are wont to take place, when the morals of men are perfectly corrupt.
For on the half only of these evils taking place, as in the case of a wicked pa­ rent and child, or the contrary, calamities, which are the pro­ geny of such a mighty hatred, have no existence.
Indeed, in any other polity, a son disowned by his father would not neces­ sarily become cityless ;
but in a state, where these are the laws, it is a matter of necessity for the fatherless to settle himself in some other place;
since it is not possible for a single one to be added to the five thousand and forty households.
On this account it is necessary that the son, who shall suffer this justly at the hands of one person, his father, should be re­ nounced by his whole race.
It is meet then, in relation to matters of this kind, to act according to some such law as this.
For him, upon whom a feeling by no means fortunate has come, whether justly or not, in his desire to release the party, whom he has begotten and brought up, from a relationship to him­ self, let it not be lawful to do so upon slight grounds, nor on the instant;
but let him first bring together his own relations up to cousins, and in like manner those of his son on the mo­ ther's side ;
and let him accuse his son before them, and show that he deserves on all accounts to be expelled from the family;
and let him allow his son to give reasons of equal weight (to prove) that he does not deserve to suffer any thing of that kind ;
and if the father can persuade them, and get to vote on his side more than half of all the relations,1 except the father,2 mother, and the son himself, 3and of the rest such as are com­ plete women and men,3 in this way and under these regulations let it be lawful for the father to renounce his son;
but otherwise not;
and if any of the citizens is willing to adopt as his son the party so renounced, let no law prevent him from so adopting him.
For the habits of youth naturally undergo many changes continually in life.
But if during ten years no one wishes to adopt the renounced party as a son, let the curators of the superabundant population 4 (that is fit) for a colony,4 look to these likewise, in order that they may have a share in the same colony in a proper manner.
5
But if disease, or old age, or harshness of manners, or all these together, more than any thing else, cause a person to be pre-eminently beyond the ma­ jority out of his mind, and this is concealed from every one, except those who live with him, and, as being the master of his property, he brings his family to ruin, but his son hesitates and fears to bring a charge of silliness, let a law be first laid down in this case, that the son is to go to the oldest guardians of the law, and inform them of his father's calamity;
and let them, when they have seen him sufficiently, take counsel to­ gether, whether the suit is to be entered upon or not;
and if they together advise (a suit), let them be both witnesses and parties in the cause.
And if the father is condemned, let him for the remainder of his time be without the power of disposing by will of even the smallest portion of his property, but dwell at home for the rest of his life, like a child.[10.]
If a husband and wife cannot, through the misfortune of their tempers, agree with each other, it will be requisite for ten men, from amongst the guardians of the laws, as mediators, and similarly ten women, who are the curators of marriages, to have the care of matters of this kind;
and if they are able to reconcile the parties, let their decision be valid.
But if their minds swell rather violently, like waves, let them seek, to the best of their power, such persons as will reside1 with either party;
and as it is likely that such persons are not tempered by gentle manners, it is meet2 to endeavour to fit to them social habits and manners of greater weight and mildness, and that such as, being without children, or having but a few, disagree, 3should, even for the sake of children, make for themselves a joint-dwelling.
3
4But it is meet for such as, when there is a sufficient number of children, to make for themselves a separation and an union, for the sake of a joint old age, and a care for each other.
4
If a woman dies, and leaves behind her male and female children, let the law laid down advise, but not compel, (the husband)1 to bring up the children, and not bring upon them a stepmother;
but if there are no children, let him of necessity marry, until he has begotten children, sufficient both for his household and the state.
But if the husband dies, and leaves behind him a sufficient number of children, let the mother of the children remain (a widow),2 and bring them up.
But if she seems to be younger than is fitting for a person to live in a state of health without a husband, let her kindred, communicating with the women who take care of marriages, do what seems good to themselves and the women touching matters of this kind ;
and if they are in want of chil­ dren, even for the sake of children;
3 and let an exact sufficiency of children be considered, according to law, a male and a female.
When it is agreed that an offspring is the progeny of the adopters,4 but there is a need of a decision, as to which of the parents the child ought to follow,5 if a female slave shall have had connexion with a slave, or with a free­ born person, or with a freed-man, let the offspring be the pro­ perty of the master of the female slave;
and if a free-born woman shall have bad intercourse with a slave, let the off­ spring belong to the master of the slave.
If a slave becomes pregnant by her master, or a mistress by her slave, and this becomes apparent, let the women6 send the offspring of the woman, together with the father, into another country;
but let the guardians of the law (send away) the offspring of the man together with its mother.[11.]
7
To have a neglect of parents neither a god nor a man, who has any mind, would ever advise any one.
1
And it is necessary to consider that a prelude of this kind would be relating to the ministering to the gods,1 having been properly regulated touching the honours and dishonours shown to pa­ rents.
Now laws have been of old laid down relating to the gods amongst all men in a two-fold manner.
For seeing clearly some of the gods,2 we honour them ;
but of others we place statues as resemblances ;
which3 while we are honour­ ing, although not endued with life, we do not vainly 4 imagine that the gods, who are endued with life, feel a great good­ will on this account, and gratitude towards us.
Let not then any one, whose father or mother, or the fathers or mothers of these, lie in his house, like a deposit, worn down with old age, ever conceive that while he has such a possession 5 at his hearth and in his house, there will be ever a statue more power­ ful,6 if only the possessor ministers to it in a proper manner.
7Clin.
What is the propriety which you say exists ?
A then.
I will tell you.
For things of this kind, friends, it is fit to hear.
Clin.
Only mention it.
Athen.
We say that CEdipus, having been dishonoured by his children, imprecated upon them what every one celebrates in hymns,8 9 as having come to pass and being heard 9 by the gods.
Amyntor too is said to have cursed in anger his son Phoenix,1 and Theseus too Hippolytus,2 and innumerable other fathers innumerable other sons.
From which it has become manifest that the gods hearken to parents (when pray­ ing) against their children.
For a parent is to his children, as no one else is to other persons, 3when imprecating a curse, most justly pernicious.
3
Nor let any one imagine, that for a deity to be hearkening to the prayers of a father and mother, when dishonoured pre-eminently by their children, is according to nature;
for when a parent is held in honour, and has be­ come very joyous, and on this account is earnest in prayer and is calling upon the gods for good things to his children, shall we not imagine that they equally hear and grant us (their requests) ?
For otherwise they would not be just distributors of what is good-an act, which we say becomes the gods the least of all.
Clin. Certainly.
Athen.
Let us think then, as we observed a little before, that we could not possess a statue more honoured by the gods, than that of our father and grandfather, worn down by old age, and of mothers and grandmothers, possessing the same want of power ;
which when any one honours, the god is glad;
for otherwise he would not hear them.
5
For the statues of our progenitors (still living) are wonderfully superior to those with­ out life.
For those, which are animated, do, when ministered to by us, pray for us on each occasion ;
but the very contrary when they are held by us in dishonour.
But (the inanimate do) neither of these.
So that he, who behaves properly to his father and grandfather, and all persons of this kind, would possess the most powerful of all statues, as regards his portion (of life) beloved by the gods.
'Clin.
You speak most beautifully.
Athen.
Every one therefore, who has any mind, fears and honours the prayers of his parents, as knowing that they have come to pass to many persons and at many times.
Since then this is the ordinance of nature to good men, their aged progenitors will be a god-send, when living to the extremity of life, and young persons, when they depart,1 be a source of great regret;
but to the bad, on the contrary,2 very terrible.
Let then every one, persuaded by these reasonings, honour his parents with all lawful honours.
But if the voice of preludes like these lays hold of any deaf person,3 for such would this law be properly laid down.
If any one in this state takes a less care of his parents than is fitting, and does not pay them in all matters more attention than he does his sons, and all his offspring and himself, and is (not)4 fulfilling their wishes, let the party suffering in this way lay an information, either him­ self or by sending some one to three of the oldest guardians of the law, and likewise to three of the women, who have the care of marriages;
and let these attend to the matter, and punish the offenders, if young men, with stripes and bonds, if they happen to be up to thirty years of age;
and let women be punished with the same punishment, up to ten years more.
But if they are beyond these years, and do not stand aloof from the same neglect of parents, but maltreat them in some way, 5let (persons) bring them before a court of justice, to one and each of the citizens,5 who may be the oldest of all;
and if a person is cast, let the tribunal fix what he is to pay (in purse) or suffer (in person), and consider nothing of what a person can suffer (in person) or pay (in purse) as a thing not to be told.
And if any one, who has been maltreated, is unable to tell the tale, let him, who has heard from free persons, lay an inform­ ation before the rulers, or let him be considered a bad man, and brought to trial by any one who is willing, for a mis­ chief done.
And If a slave gives information, let him be made free;
and if he is the slave, either of the maltreating or mal­ treated parties, let him be made free by the magistrate ;
but if he is the slave of any other citizen, let the public (treasury) put down his value for his master;
and let it be a care to the magistrates, that no one, in revenging himself, does an injury to a person of this kind for giving the information.[12.]
With respect to the cases, where one person does a mischief to another by means of poisons, such as are deadly have been already spoken of;
but as regards other mischiefs, if any does an injury willingly and with malice prepense, by drink, or meat, or ointments, of these nothing has been stated as yet.
For two kinds of poisonings 1according to the race of man1 2stop the statement.
2 For (the poisoning), of which we were just now clearly speaking, is doing an injury to bodies by bodies according to nature;
but the other is that, which,by sorceries and incantations and the so-called bindings,3 persuades those, who dare to injure them,4 that they are able to do something of this kind;
and others, that they are injured more than any thing by those, who are able to act the sorcerer.
Now these matters, and all relating to things of this kind, it is neither easy to know how they exist in nature, nor, if any one did know, to persuade others.
But upon the minds of men, who look with suspicion on each other in things of this kind, it is not worth while to endeavour to make an attack,1 if per­ chance they see representations moulded in wax, either on the house-door, or where three cross-roads meet, or on the tombs of their parents, and to exhort those, who have no clear notions about them, to hold all things of that kind cheap.
Dividing then the law relating to poisonings into two parts, 2according as a person may attempt to use poisons in one way or the other,2 let us first beg, and exhort, and advise persons, that they ought not to attempt to do a thing of this kind, nor to terrify the masses of mankind, frightened like children ;
nor, on the other hand, to compel the legislator and judge to cure mankind of such fears;
3 since, in the first place, he who at­ tempts to make use of poison, if he does not know what he is doing, both as regards the body, if he happens not to be skilled in medical science, and as regards on the other hand sorceries, unless he happens to be a diviner, or an interpreter of miracles.
3
Let this law then be stated in words4 respecting poisons.
He, who employs poison, not for deadly injury 5 to a person him­ self, or to the folks belonging to that man,5 but 6for an injury of another kind, or deadly6 to cattle and hives of bees, if he happens to be a physician, and is condemned for poisoning let him be punished with death;
but if he is unskilled (in medicine), let the tribunal fix what he must suffer (in per­ son) or pay (in purse).
But if any one by bindings-down, or allurements, or certain incantations, or any of such like poi­ sonings whatever, appears to be like a person doing an injury, if he is a diviner, or an interpreter of miracles, let him be put to death.
But if any one is accused of poisoning, without being a diviner, let the same thing take place to him likewise.
For respecting him, let the tribunal fix what it seems good to them he ought to suffer (in person) or pay (in purse).
What­ ever injury one person does to another by fraud or force, if it be a great one, let him pay a greater fine ;
but a smaller one, if it be small;
and in all cases let a party pay as much as he may on each occasion have done an injury, until he shall have remedied the mischief done.
1In each case of wrong-doing, let each person pay the penalty that follows it, for the sake of bringing him to his senses;
1 and let one, who in thoughtlessness has done wrong, and by making use of a persuasion foreign to his nature, through his youth or some such thing, (pay) a lighter (fine), but another one a heavier, through his own thought­ lessness, or his non-mastery over pleasure and pain, from the fears of cowardice,2 or certain desires, or envyings, or angers, that have become difficult to cure ;
and let him suffer a punish­ ment, not for having done wrong—3for what has been born, ne'er will be unborn3—but for the sake of this, that in after- time both the culprit and those, who see him under the sentence of the law, may either hate injustice entirely, or that a great portion of a calamity of this kind may cease.
For the sake of all which, it is meet for the laws to look to all these matters, nor, like a bad archer, to take aim, for the sake of the magni- tude of the punishment in each case, and the proper desert viewed as a whole.
1
The same ought the judge to do, and to be the minister to the legislator, whenever a law puts upon him to fix what the party tried ought to suffer (in person) or pay (in purse) ;
and, like a painter, he ought to sketch out the acts, in conformity with the description of them;
which must be done at present by us, Megillus and Clinias, in the most beautiful and best manner;
and we must state what fines, as they are called, are to take place for all acts done by fraud and violence, in order that the gods, and the sons of gods, may permit us to lay down laws.[13.]
If any one is insane, let him not be seen openly in the city, but let the relations of each person watch over them at home, in the best manner they know of;
or let them pay a fine, he with property of the largest valuation a hundred drachms, if he is negligent in the case of.
a person, whether a slave or a free-man ;
he of the next valuation, four out of five parts of a mina;
he of the third, three parts of a mina;
and he of the fourth, four parts.
Many indeed are mad in various ways.
Some, of whom we have just spoken, through disease;
others, through the vicious nature and nurture to boot of passion ;
for being excited by a trifling enmity, they send forth a loud voice and speak blasphemously against each other.
But nothing of this kind ought to take place at any time, or by any means, in a state under good laws.
2
Let then there be this one (law) relating to all on the subject of evil-speaking.
Let no one speak evil of another.
But when one person has 3in some discourses3 a dispute with another, let him give to and receive instruction, from the person disputing, and those who are present, and abstain entirely from evil-speak­ ing.
4
For from uttering prayers and curses against each other, and bringing through disgraceful names the language of women upon each other,4 in the first place from words, which are a light thing, hatred and grievous enmities are pro­ duced in deed.
For by gratifying anger, a thing most un­ lovely, the speaker gorges passion with an evil feast, and just as much as he was once rendered mild by education, to such an extent does he again make his soul savage, and, living in moroseness, becomes like a wild beast, and receives from pas­ sion a bitter delight.
And under these feelings all are fre­ quently wont to go out of the way to utter something ridicu­ lous about their opponents;
to which there is no one who accustoms himself, but who fails
In a seriousness of manner, par­ tially or entirely, or destroys of highmindedness many a part.
On this account therefore, let no one ever speak any word of this kind in a temple, or 1 at public sacrifices,1 or at public games, or in the market-place, or a court of justice, or at any common meeting.
But let the magistrate, who is the president at such places, punish without damage to himself the individual (so speaking) ;
2 or never let him enter the lists for the prizes of good conduct, as being one who pays no attention to the laws, nor performs what is enjoined by the legislator.
2
And if any one in other places begins abuse or uses it in self-defence, and does not keep himself from language of this kind, let any more elderly person, who meets him, in defence of the law restrain with blows those, who 3 act kindly towards anger, another ill ;
3 or let them be held amenable to the fine ordained.
We say too at present, that he, who 4is entangled with abuse,4 is not able to make use of it without seeking to say what raises a laugh;
and this is what we abuse ourselves, when it takes place through anger.
But what then ?
I
Shall we admit the pro­ pensity of comic writers to say what raises a laugh against persons, if without any feeling of anger they attempt in their comedies to say any thing of this kind against the citizens ?1
Or shall we make a twofold division into the playful and not ?
and that it may be lawful for any one in fun to say what is laughable, if without anger, about any one ;
but that it be not lawful for any one, as we said before, when on the stretch2 and with any angry reeling ?
This then must by no means be put off;
but let us lay down by a law for whom it may be lawful, or not.
Let it then be not lawful for any composer of co­ medies, or of any iambics or melodies of the Muses, either by words or caricatures, to make any citizen a butt in comedy, either in anger or without anger.
And if any one disobeys (this law), let the umpires at the contests expel him utterly from the country on the very same day, or be fined three minæ, sacred to the god to whom the contest belongs.
But let it be lawful for the others, to whom it has been stated above that there is a permission, to do so to each other without anger and in sport;
but let it not be allowed in seriousness and in anger.
And let the inquiry into this matter be committed to him, who has the care of the whole education of the young.
And what­ ever he shall select, let it be lawful for the composer to bring it before the public ;
but whatever he rejects, let not the au­ thor show it to any one, nor let him be found to have taught it to any other person, either a slave or free-man ;
or let him be considered as a vicious character, and disobedient to the laws.[14.]
But he is a person deserving of pity, not when he is hungry or suffers a thing of this kind, but when temperate, or possessing some (other) virtue,3 or a part of it, he has in addition a certain calamity.
1
Hence it would be a thing of wonder, should a person, who is such, be so entirely neglected, as to arrive at extreme poverty, whether a slave or a free-man, in a polity and a city which is regulated even moderately.
On this account it would be safe for the legislator to lay down for such persons a law of this kind.
Let there be no beggar in the state.
But if any one attempts to do a thing of this kind, by collecting food by prayers 2 which cannot be satisfied,2 let the Market-Stewards expel him from the market-place, and the City-Stewards from the city, and the Rural-Stewards send him from the rest of the country, over the land on the borders, in order that the land may become altogether pure from an animal of such a kind.
If a male or a female slave injures the property of persons ever so little, the injured party himself not being a joint-cause, through inexperience or any other event of an intemperate kind, let the owner of the party, who has done the mischief, either remedy the mischief in not a deficient manner, or hand over the injuring party himself.
But if the owner (of the slave) brings an accusation by saying that the charge has been made by the common trick of the parties injuring and injured, with the view of depriving him of his slave, let him bring against the person, who pretends to have been injured, an action for fraudulent practices ;
and if the party is convicted, let him re­ ceive double the value of the slave, at which the tribunal may have fixed it;
but if he is himself defeated, let him remedy the mischief and give up the slave.
And if a beast of burden, or a horse, or a dog, or any other animal, injures the property of neighbours, let 3(the owner of the animal)3 in like manner pay for the mischief done.
If a person is unwilling to be a witness, let the party, who wants him, cite him ;
4 and after being cited,5 let him meet the party at the trial;
and if he knows the facts, and is willing to give evidence, let him give it.
5 Butif he says that he knows nothing, let him swear by the three deities, Zeus, Apollo, and Themis, that he knows nothing, and be dismissed from the trial;
and let him, who, when cited to give evidence, does not attend,' be held amenable for the mischief according to law.
If any one cause a juryman to stand up as a witness, let him not, while giving evidence, give his vote upon the case.
Let a free woman be allowed to bear witness, and appear as counsel, if she is more than forty years of age, and to obtain by lot a trial, if she is unmarried;
but if her husband is living, let her be al­ lowed to be a witness only.
Let a male and female slave, and a boy,2 be allowed to be a witness in the case of murder, and to act as counsel, if they can produce trust-worthy bail that they will remain up to the trial, should they be accused of bearing false witness.
Let either of the litigants bring a charge against the whole or part of the evidence, if he asserts that some have borne false witness before the trial is decided;
and let the magistrates preserve in writing the accusations put under the seal of both, and bring them forward for the purpose of deciding upon the false testimony.
If any one shall be twice convicted of having borne false witness, let the law no longer compel him to bear witness again;
but if thrice, let him not be allowed ever to bear witness again.
And if he dares, after having been caught thrice, to bear witness, let any one who is willing, inform against him before a magistrate;
and let the magistrate deliver him to a tribunal, and if he is convicted, let him be punished with death.
Of whomsoever, that have seemed to have borne false witness in a cause, and by so do­ ing to have gained the suit for the plaintiff, the evidence shall be detected, if more than half of such testimony is condemned, let the verdict obtained by such evidence be set aside, and let there be a question of doubt, and a trial, whether the cause had been decided or not by such evidence;
and according as the decision may be on either side, let the final result of the previous trials be determined by this decision.
While however there are many things of beauty in the life of man, to the majority of them there stick, as it were naturally, evil fates, which stain and defile them.
And yet, as there is justice amongst men, how is not that beautiful, which renders all human affairs mild ?
And this being beautiful, how would it not be beautiful in us to take the side of a party in a cause ?
But1 on these notions being of such a kind a certain malicious­ ness brings a calumny, 1 by putting forward art under an honourable name, which says forsooth that the first thing is a certain stratagem in causes, and that it is able to gain a victory 2 by litigating, and taking a part in causes,2 whether what may have been done respecting each suit is just or not;
and that of this art, and of the speeches resulting from it, there is a gift, if a person will give money in return.
This therefore, whether it is an art, or an artless skill 3 and practice, it is par­ ticularly necessary that it should not exist in our state;
but, as the legislator 4 requests (the people) to be persuaded by him, and not to say what is contrary to justice,4 5 be sent about its business to some other country.
5 6
To those then, who are persuaded, silence (is sufficient) ;
6 but for the unpersuaded let this be the voice of the law.
If any one is thought to be en­ deavouring to turn the power of justice, which is in the souls of the judges, to a contrary direction, and out of season 7 to toss back and fro a matter of this kind, 1 or to side with it, let any one who is willing, indict him for the perversion of a suit, or siding with a wrong one;
and let the trial come on in the court for select jurymen ;
and if he is convicted, let the court decide whether he seems to have done a deed of this kind through a love of money or contention ;
and if through a love of contention, let the court decide for what length of time such a person is not to obtain by lot a suit, or to side in a suit with any one;
but if through avarice, let him, if he is a stranger, depart from the city, and never return to it again, or be pun­ ished with death;
but let a citizen be put to death for his love of money, which has been honoured by him in every way;
but if a person is convicted of having done so twice through a love of contention, let him be put to death.[1.]
2 IF an ambassador or a herald by telling falsehoods performs improperly an embassy from one state to another, or when sent does not report the embassy on which he is sent, as it is in reality;
or again, on the other hand, is clearly bring­ ing back not correctly from enemies or friends what he has heard as an ambassador or herald,2 let indictments be drawn up against these persons, for having, contrary to law, acted with impiety towards the messages and mandates of Hermes and Zeus;
3 and let there be a fine as to what he is to suffer (in person) or pay (in purse).
3
The stealing of money is an ungentlemanlike act, but seizing by violence is a shameless one.
But of the sons of Zeus not one 1 has ever carried on either of those pursuits by fraud or force with impunity.
Let no one therefore, acting impro­ perly, be deceived and persuaded at all 2 by poets or certain mythologists, and think that, if he makes use of fraud or force, he does nothing disgraceful, but only what the gods themselves are doing.
For this is neither true nor becoming.
But who­ ever3 does a thing of this kind contrary to law, is neither a god, nor a son of the gods.
But this it is fitting for the legis­ lator rather than all poets to know.
He therefore, who is per­ suaded by our discourse, is happy, and may he be happy through the whole of time;
but let him, who is unpersuaded, be re­ strained 4 subsequently by some such law as this.
If any one steals what is public property, whether great or small, he has need of the same punishment;
for he who steals a trifle, steals with the same desire, but with less power.
But he, who re­ moves any thing of greater value, and does not put it down again, is wholly unjust.
The law however deems it just to punish the one with a less punishment than the other, not on account of the greatness of the theft, but through one of them being perhaps curable, but the other incurable.
If any one convicts before a tribunal a slave or a stranger of stealing any public property, let sentence be passed on him as to what he ought to suffer (in person), 5 or what fine he ought to pay,5 as if he were, from what is likely, curable;
but if a citizen, who has been brought up, as he will have been brought up, is caught committing a theft upon, or doing violence to, his country, whether taken in the fact or not, it is meet to pun­ ish him with death, as being nearly incurable.[2.]
For the sake of foreign expeditions much consultation and many laws are properly instituted.
The greatest of all things, however, is for no one, either male or female, to be at any time without a ruler, nor the soul of any one, either seri­ ously engaged or in sport, to be ever accustomed to do any thing alone itself by itself;
but that in all time of war and in all of peace, to look perpetually to a ruler, and, following him, to live and be governed by him in the smallest things;
as for instance, to stand, when he commands, and to march and to engage in gymnastics, and to wash himself, and to take food, and to get up at night, to mount guard and to convey orders ;
and in the midst even of dangers, neither to pursue nor to give way to any one, without the orders of the rulers ;
and in one word, to teach the soul by habit to do nothing apart from the rest, nor to think of, or know it at all;
but that the life of all men should, as much as possible, be in all things collected (into one), and in common.
For nothing is, or will ever be, superior to, and better, and more full of art than this, for the purposes of safety and victory in war.
And in peace, too, men must from their childhood be practised in ruling over others, and being ruled by others;
but anarchy must be expelled from the whole life of all men, and 1 of wild beasts under man.
All dancings moreover (it is meet) to celebrate with a view to the best modes of warfare, and to practise a complete facility in using the body and arms for the sake of the same objects, and an endurance in food and drink, and of cold weather and the con­ trary, and a hard bed, and, what is the greatest of all, the not destroying the powers of the head and feet through the cover­ ing of strange clothing, and by relaxing2 the generation and growth of our natural caps and shoes.
3
For these extremities, when preserved, possess the greatest power of the whole body;
but the contrary, when in a contrary state ;
and one (the feet) is the most subservient to the whole body;
but the other (the head) has the greatest power, through possessing naturally all its dominant senses.
And this praise of a war­ like life, it is meet, it seems to me, for young men to hear ;
but the laws are these.
Let the party serve in a campaign, who is on the list, or has been ordered through a certain quota.
But if any one through cowardice deserts his post, with­ out a dismissal from the army-leaders, let an indictment for desertion lie before the war-officers, when they return from camp;
and let those, who have served, try each of the parties, the heavy-armed foot and the cavalry severally, and all the other arms of the service each of the parties in a similar manner ;
and let the heavy-armed bring (the defaulters) before the heavy-armed, and the cavalry before the cavalry, and each of the other arms in like manner to those of their comrades.
If any one is convicted, let it be not in his power to be a candidate for the whole prize of good conduct;
1 or to indict another party for not serving in a campaign,' or to be an accuser on these matters ;
and besides this, let a court of justice decide what he is to suffer (in person) or pay (in purse).
After this, when the trials for desertions have been decided, let the commanders of each arm of the service form an assembly;
and let the party, who wishes it, have amongst his own clans a trial re­ lating to the prizes for good conduct;
but let him not produce any testimony touching a former war, nor the confirmation of his assertions by witnesses, but only of the campaign, which had taken place at that time ;
and 2let the crown of victory to each be that of a bough ;
2 and let this person, after writing out an inscription, hang it up in the temple of whatever war-god he likes, as a witness through the whole of life, of the decision relating to the prize of good conduct;
and so of the second and third prizes likewise.
But if any one goes out during a campaign, but returns home before his time, without the commanding officers having sent him away, let there be indictments against such persons for leaving the ranks before the same parties as those in the case of non-service;
and against the parties convicted, let punishments be imposed, such as have been laid down before.
Now it is requisite for every man, when bringing every kind of law-suit against a person, to have a fear of bringing a false punishment,3 either willingly or unwillingly, to the best of his power.
For Justice is said to be a modest 1 virgin, and 2 is said to be so really.
2 Now False­ hood is naturally an object of blame to Modesty and Justice.
Respecting other matters then it is requisite to take care not to err against Justice;
but pre-eminently so, in the case of throwing away arms in war;
lest perchance a person by making a mistake about the throwing away of arms from a necessity, places such acts on the score of a reproach, and brings lawsuits unjustly against a person not deserving them.
Indeed it is by no means easy to define one or the other of these points.
It is necessary however for the law to endeavour to define somehow in part.
Employing then a fable, let us say, that had Patroclus been carried to his tent without arms, and was still alive, as has befallen numberless per­ sons, 3 and those former arms, which, as the poet says,3 (II. S. 84,) were given as a wedding present to Peleus by the gods on his marriage with Thetis, had Hector possessed, would it have been lawful for such bad men, as were at that time, to re­ proach the son of Menœtius, for throwing away his arms ?
Still further, 4 (could such persons be reproached,) 4 who, by be­ ing thrown down from precipices, have lost their arms, or (have fallen) into the sea 5 during storms, or5 6in level places, when a great flow of water has suddenly received 6 them—and1 num­ berless things of this kind one might chaunt, when consoling (persons), and beautifying an act bad (in itself), and easy to be abused ?
It is necessary, however, to the utmost of our power, to divide the greater and the most grievous evil from the con­ trary.
Now in abuse, the very abundance of such appellations possess nearly a certain division.
For a person would not be justly called in all cases a thrower away of a shield, but the loser of them.
For he, who is deprived (of his arms) by a reasonable display of force, and he, who throws them will­ ingly away, would not be equally a thrower away of a shield ;
but there is a difference wholly and entirely.
Let then this be held as spoken by a law.
If any one, being overtaken by the enemy, and having arms, does not turn round and defend himself, but voluntarily drops them, or throws them away, catching at a base life, united to 2 a soulless cowardice,2 rather than at an honourable death, united to manliness, against such a loss of arms thrown away, let there be justice done;
but let the judge neglect to consider the loss mentioned above.
For it is requisite always to punish the coward, in order that he may become better;
but not the unfortunate.
For in this there is no advantage.
3But what punishment will be suited to him, who gives up such a power of defensive weapons to a contrary purpose?
3 4 For it is not possible to do, in the case of a man, the contrary to what they say a god did, by changing Cæneus of Thessaly from a woman into the nature of a man.
4 1 For to the man, who throws away his shield, the sex would, after a manner, be the most becoming of all, which is the con­ trary to that sex, which, by the being changed from a man into a woman, would become a punishment to such a person.
1
But now, what2 is the nearest to these, in order that a per­ son, for the sake of a love of life, may through the remainder of life run no risk, but live as long as possible, as being a coward and coupled to reproaches, for such let this be the law.
The man, who is convicted of having disgracefully thrown away his weapons of war, let neither the general of an army, nor any other military officer, ever employ as a soldier, nor put him into the ranks at all;
otherwise let the party, who is the auditor of his accounts and doings, set him to rights thus.
3
If the person who has put the coward into the ranks, belongs to the highest property-census, (let him pay) a thousand drachms ;
4 if to the second, five minæ ;
if to the third, three ;
and if to the fourth, one mina.
And let him, who has been convicted (of throwing away his arms), pay, in addition to his being ex­ cluded from manly dangers, through his own individual nature, a thousand drachms, if he belongs to the highest census;
and five minæ, if to the second;
three, if to the third;
and one mina, in like manner as the preceding, if to the fourth.5[3.]
With respect to the auditing6 of accounts, what would be for us the fitting discourse, when some of the magistrates are chosen by the chance of a lot for a year, and others for many years and from a selection ?
For of such accounts who will be a suffici­ ent Auditor ? 1
For should any one of the persons in office say or do any thing not straightforward, when bent down by the weight of his duties, or by the want of power, with respect to the dig­ nity of his office, it (would be) by no means easy to find a ruler, superior to (other) rulers in virtue;
1 still we must endeavour to discover some god-like Auditors.
For the case is this.
There are many occasions for dissolving a polity, as of a ship, 2 or any animal ;
2 3 of which while we say there are blocks, and under- joinings, and fibres, and ropes,3 we call the nature one, yet dis­ persed in many parts by many names.
But this is an occasion by no means the smallest, for the preservation of a polity and its dissolution and falling away.
For if those, who audit the accounts of the:
magistrates, are better than the magistrates, and this takes place with justice not to be blamed,4 and in a blameless manner, the whole country and state thus flourishes and is happy.
But if that, which relates to the audit of the magistrates, takes place in a different manner, then the justice, which binds together all political affairs into one, being dis­ solved, the whole government is torn apart, one portion from another, and 1 no longer inclining to the same point,' they cause the city from being one to become many, and, filling it with sedition, destroy it quickly.
On this account then it is requisite for the Auditors to be objects of admiration for their virtue.
Let us then devise by some method that their production shall be of this kind.
Let the whole city come together each year, after the turn of the sun from the summer to the winter, to a sacred grove, common to the Sun and Apollo,2 3 with the view of exhibiting to the god three men, which each person shall judge to be the best of all except himself, and not less than fifty years of age ;
and of those voted in preference by the greatest number of persons, let them make a selection up to the half, if they are an even number ;
but if they are odd, let them take away the one, who had the fewest votes, and leave the half, and make a decision by the number of votes;
but if to some the votes are equal, 4and they make the half number more,4 let them take away the surplus, after rejecting on account of the youth ;
but selecting the others, let them give their votes again, until three with unequal votes are obtained.
5
But if for all or for two the votes are equal, then, committing the affair to good fate and fortune, let them select the victor by a lot, and let them crown him, and the second, and the third, with a bough ;
6 and after giving the prizes for excellence, let (a crier) proclaim to all, that the city of the Magnesians having again obtained safety from a god, shows before the Sun three of her best men, and offers them up, according to the old law, as a common first-fruit to Apollo and the Sun, for as long a time as they follow their judgment.
7
Let these in the first year mark out twelve Auditors 1 (and do so) 1 until each has reached his seventy-fifth year;
and afterwards, let three be always added every year.
Let these, dividing the magisterial offices into twelve parts, freely2 examine them, by making use of all kinds of touchstones ;
and let them reside, as long as they are Auditors, in the grove sacred to the Sun and Apollo, in which they were elected.
And let each, judging of some matters privately, and of others in common with each other, exhibit the rulers before the state;
and putting, what they have writ­ ten respecting each office in the market-place, let it be stated what the parties are to suffer (in person) or pay (in purse) ac­ cording to the decision of the Auditors.
And whichever of the magistrates shall not admit that he has been judged of with justice, let him bring the Auditors to the select jury­ men ;
and if he escapes from the Auditors' decision, let him, if he will, bring a charge against the Auditors themselves;
and if he is convicted, let him, if the punishment fixed by the Auditors against any one is death, simply die, as necessity re­ quires ;
but of the other fines, of which it is possible to pay the double, let him pay the double.
It is now meet to hear what the honours3 of these Auditors are to be, and after what manner.
Let the first seats in all public meetings be given to those, who, while they live, are deemed by the whole state worthy of the prizes for good con­ duct ;
and further, in the case of sacrifices, and holy embassies amongst the Greeks in common, and of holy rites, in which there is a communion on other grounds;
1 let them send from amongst these the chiefs of each holy embassy;
and let these alone of those in the state be adorned with a crown of laurel;
and let all of them be priests of Apollo and the Sun;
and let one be the high priest for the year, who is adjudged to have been the first amongst the priests 2 in that year;
2 and write up his name every year, in order that it may become the mea­ sure of the period of time, as long as the city is inhabited.
And when they die, let the laying out of the corpse, and the carrying it out, and their graves, be different from those of the other citizens ;
and let (every one)3 wear his whole robe white, and let no one be without weeping and lamentation ;
and let there be also (one) choir of fifteen girls, and another of as many boys, and let each stand round the bier, and sing in turn praises on the priests, as it were a set hymn, and celebrate their happy state in an ode the whole day long;
and on the morning (fol­ lowing), let a hundred young men, amongst those engaged in gymnastic exercises, and whom the relations of the deceased shall have selected,4 carry the bier to the sepulchre.
And first, let the unmarried young men precede (the bier), each having put on a warrior's dress, the horsemen with their horses, and the heavy-armed foot-soldiers with their shields, and the rest after a similar manner ;
and let the boys around the bier go before and sing the national hymn, and let the girls follow behind, and such of the women as happen to be freed from child-bearing;
and after them let the priests and priestesses follow, as to a pure tomb, although they are repelled from other tombs, if at least the Pythian priestess gives her vote so and on this side;
and let the place of deposit for them be built under the earth, a long vault composed 1 of stones very valuable, and without old age to the best of their power, 1 and having couches, made of stones, lying by each other;
where having placed the man, who has become blessed,2 and raising a mound in a circle, they shall plant a grove of trees around, except at one limb, in order that the burial-place may have an enlargement, 3such that there may be no deficiency in a mound for those to be placed there in all time ;
3 and they shall make yearly contests in music and gymnastics and horse­ manship.
Such are the honours to be paid to those, 4 who have escaped (the reversal) of their auditorship.
4
But if any one of these, confiding too much in his having been tried, should exhibit 5 (a depraved) 5 human nature, by becoming depraved after his trial, let the law ordain that any one, who is willing, may indict him ;
and let the trial take place at a tribunal, in some such manner as this.
First let the guardians of the laws belong to this tribunal.
Next 6of these very persons the living ;
6 and moreover let the tribunal be composed of the select jurymen.
And let him, who lays the indictment, put on the record against the party, whom he is indicting, the charge, averring that this or that person is unworthy of the prize for good conduct and of his office.
And if the defendant is cast, let him be deprived of his office, and sepulchre, and the other honours granted to him;
but if the accuser does not obtain a fifth part of the votes, let him pay, if his property is of the highest valuation, twelve minæ;
eight, if of the second;
if of the third, six ;
and if of the fourth, two.[4.]
Respecting the so-called decision of Rhadamanthus, in judicial matters, it is indeed worthy of admiration.
For he saw that the men of that time distinctly believed that there were gods, and reasonably so;
because at that time the ma­ jority were the descendants of gods, of whom he was himself one, at least as the story goes.
He appears, therefore, to have thought that he ought to commit (nothing) 1 to any man as a judge, but to gods;
from whence causes were decided by him simply and quickly.
For by tendering an oath to the dispu­ tants upon each matter in dispute, he was freed from them with rapidity and safety.
But since at present, as we have stated, some portion of mankind think that the gods do not ex­ ist at all;
and others conceive that they take no care of us;
while the opinion of the greatest and worst part is, that, by receiving trifling sacrifices and abundance2 of flattery, they will conjointly deprive persons of considerable property, and free them from harm on many occasions,3 the art of Rha­ damanthus in lawsuits would no longer be suited to men of the present time.
For since the opinions of men respecting the gods have undergone a change, it is necessary for laws to be changed likewise.
In the allotment of causes therefore, it is meet for those who, possessing a mind, lay down laws, to take away the oaths of either of the opposing parties, and for the party, who has obtained by lot a trial against any one, to write down ths accusations, but to swear no oath ;
and for the defendant in like manner to write down his denial, and to hand it over to the rulers without an oath.
1 For it is surely a terrible thing to know well that, while many lawsuits are occurring in the state, almost one half of the parties have perjured themselves, 1 by having been easily mixed up with each other at joint-feasts 2 and through other intercourse and private joint-producings of each one.
2
Let it therefore be laid down as a law that he, who is about to act the juryman, shall take an oath as a juryman;
and that he, who appoints for the commonweal the magistrates by oaths, or by the bringing of votes, 3 must bring them from sacred places and do something of this kind ;
3 and on the other hand, that the judge of choirs and all kinds of music, and the presidents over, and the umpires at, the gymnastic and eques­ trian contests;
and in all matters which, according to the opinion of men, do not bring a gain to the party forswearing himself, (shall take an oath;
) 4but in those, that seem to be plainly a great profit to the party, who makes a denial or takes an oath, let all, who bring a charge against each other, be judged by lawsuits without any oaths.
4
And generally in a lawsuit let not the presidents permit a person while speaking to take an oath, for the sake of making his assertion credible, or to imprecate curses on himself and race, or to employ unseemly entreaties or the piteous tones of a woman, but let the party proceed ever with good words in teaching 1 and learning1 what is just;
and if not, let the magistrate, as if the party were speaking out of the record, bring him back to the arguments that may happen to be relating to the business in hand.
2
But let it be in the power of a stranger (when litigating) with a stranger, as at present, to receive from, if they are willing, and to tender to, each other oaths.
2
For they will not grow old, 3 nor by hatching young ones in the state, 4 will they fur­ nish the power to others for the most part of such a brood to become the masters of the country.
4
In the same manner let there be a decision respecting the allotment5 of lawsuits against each other in all cases,, where a free-man is not obedient to the state in matters, deserving neither stripes, nor bonds, nor death.
But as regards the non­ attendance6 at dancings, or processions, or other public acts of a showy kind, or sharing in public duties, such as take place for the sake of a sacrifice in peace, or a contribution in war, in all these let the first necessity be a remedy7 for the damage done;
but from such, as are disobedient, let a security be demanded by those, on whom the state and the law toge­ ther enjoin to demand it;
8and of such, as are inattentive (to the matter),8 let there be a sale of the security, and let money (got from the sale) belong to the state.
But if they are in need of a greater fine, let each of the magistrates, after imposing a fitting fine on the disobedient, bring the parties before a court of justice, until they are willing to do what they are ordered.[5.]
It is necessary moreover to consult about what it is meet to do for a state, which does not make money, except by what1 arises from the land, and does not import any thing,2 3touching the going abroad of its own people out of the country, and the reception of foreigners from other parts.
3
On these points the legislator ought to give advice by first persuading to the utmost of his power.
The intermixture indeed of states with states naturally causes a mixture of all kinds of manners, through strangers making with strangers innovations 4 with each other;
4 which thing would bring an injury the greatest of all to those, who have a good polity through good laws.
But, to the greater number of states, as being by no means under good laws, it makes no difference for the citizens 5 to be contaminated by receiving foreigners, and for the citizens6 to revel in other states, when a person is desirous of going abroad in any way or at any time, whether he is young, or rather advanced in years.
But, on the other hand, for these never to receive others, and never themselves to travel elsewhere, is not at all suitable;
and it would appear to be a behaviour rustic and rude to the rest of mankind, who would make use of harsh names, such as the so-called stranger-expellings,7 and manners self-willed and morose, as they would seem to be.
Now to appear to be good, or not good,to others, it is meet never to consider a thing of small importance.
For the multitude 1 do not, as far as they happen to fail in the substance of virtue, fail so far in their judgment of others, who are vicious and useless, 1 but there is even in the bad a something divine and fe­ licitous in hitting the mark, so that very many even of the very bad distinguish very well, both by their words and thoughts, the better sort of men and the worse.
And hence the ex­ hortation to many states is correct, to set some value on the good opinion of the multitude.
For it is a thing the most correct and of the greatest consequence for a man truly good to hunt in this way after a life of fair repute;
for without it, he will by no means become the perfect man.
And truly be­ coming would it be for the city, settled in Crete, to render it­ self in the opinion of the rest of mankind the most beautiful and best.
And there is every hope in all likelihood, should it con­ duct itself according to reason, that in a little time the Sun and the other gods will see it amongst the states and countries, that are well-governed.
In this way then it is meet to act, with regard to travelling into other countries and places, and the reception of foreigners.
In the first place, let it not be lawful for a person less than forty years of age to go abroad at any time, or in any manner;
and further still, for no person on a private account, but on a public one, let it be lawful for heralds or ambassadors, or certain holy inspectors (to go abroad).
But to be absent from the country during a war or a campaign, does not deserve to be called a going abroad, nor to be a part of such political doings.
It is likewise requisite to send persons to the Py­ thian Apollo, and the Olympian Jupiter, and likewise to Ne­ mea and the Isthmus,3 to take a share in the sacrifices and contests (sacred) to those gods ;
and to send the most numer- ous, and such as are the most beautiful and the best in their power, who may cause the state to appear of fair repute in holy and peaceful meetings, by exhibiting its apparatus for renown as the counter-part of what is requisite for war.
And when they return home, they will teach the young, that the legal institutions of the rest of mankind relating to political affairs, are second to their own.
1
But on other grounds it is (not) meet to send out holy inspectors;
but some such as these, after obtaining permission of the guardians of the laws, 1 should any of the citizens be desirous to look at the affairs of the rest of mankind, let no law restrain.
For a state, while unacquainted with good and wicked men, cannot by being un­ sociable be sufficiently mild and perfect.
2Nor again, can it preserve its laws without taking them into consideration, but not only by morals.
2
For amongst the multitude there are always some, not many, godlike men, every way worthy of being associated with, and who are produced in no respect the more in well-governed states than in those that are not so;
in whose footsteps it is ever meet for him, who dwells in well- regulated states, to proceed, when on going out by sea or by land, he is seeking the party, who may be uncorrupted, so as to make some of the legal institutions, that have been laid down correctly, more firm, and to correct others, where there is any deficiency.
For without such an inspection and search, a state will never continue perfect;
3 not even if they inspect it badly.
3Clin.
How, therefore, can both of these take place ?
A then.
Thus. [6.]
First let an inspector of this kind be not more than fifty years of age ;
and further, let him be of good repute for other matters and for war, if lie is about to lay be­ fore other cities a specimen of the guardians of the laws.
But when he is more than sixty years of age, let him no longer be an inspector.
And having made an inspection for as many years of the ten as he likes, let him return home and go to the as­ sembly of those who inspect the laws.
And let this (assembly) be composed of old persons and young;
and let it be held of necessity every day, from day-break until the sun rises;
and let it be composed first of those priests, who have received the prizes for good conduct;
next, ten of the guardians of the laws, 1 who happen to be the seniors;
1 and further still, the guardian of the whole education, both the new one, and those who have been released from the office.
And let each of these go not alone, but with a young man from thirty to forty years of age, having taken as an ally the person agreeable to himself;
and let there be a conference amongst them, and a conversation upon the laws of their own state, and on such matters as they shall have heard of, superior at all in any other quarter;
and about objects of learning to boot, such as may seem to be of use in this inquiry, and which, to those, who have learnt, will be more clear to be understood ;
2 but to those, who have not learnt, the points relating to laws would seem to be rather dark.
3
And whatever the elders may select from these, let the younger learn with all attention;
and if any one of those, who have been invited, seems to be an unworthy per­ son, let the whole meeting blame the party who invited him.
But let the whole 4 state watch over those of the young men, who are in good repute, 5 looking at them, and observing them pre-eminently;
and let them hold in honour those, who are in the right way,5 but in dishonour more than the rest, if they turn out worse than the majority.
To this meeting let him, who has inspected the legal institutions amongst the rest of mankind, go immediately on his arrival;
and if he has dis­ covered any persons possessing any rumour about the laying down of any laws, or of education or bringing up, let him men­ tion it, or if he has himself thought upon any matters, let him communicate it to the whole assembly.
But if he appears to have returned in no respect either worse or better, let him be praised at least for his very great readiness to go ;
but if (he returns) much better, let him while living be greatly honoured, and when dead, let all the power of the parties in the assem­ bly honour him with befitting honours.
But if he appears to have returned corrupted, although he pretends to be wise, let him associate with no one, either young or old.
And if he is obedient to the magistrates, let him live in private;
but if not, let him be put to death, 1 at least if he be convicted in a court of justice of being a busy-body on the subject of education and the laws.'
But if none of the rulers bring him before a court of justice, when he deserves it, let a reproach be laid up against the rulers at the time of their undergoing a trial for the rewards for good conduct.
Let him then, who goes abroad, go abroad in this manner, and being such a person.
But after him it is meet to receive kindly the person, who comes from abroad.
Now there are four kinds of foreigners of whom we ought to make mention.
The first is he, who comes ever in the sum­ mer, and continues for the most part in his visits like birds of passage;
and of these the majority flying, as it were, cle­ verly2 over the sea in the spring of the year,3 wend their way to other cities, for the sake of making money as merchants;
which persons it is meet for the magistrates, appointed for such purposes, to receive in the market-places, and ports, and public buildings outside the city, at the city;
4 taking care that none of such foreigners make any innovation;
and distributing correctly to them the claims of justice, and having an inter­ course with them for what is necessary, but as little as possible.
The second kind is he, who is in reality an inspector with his eyes, and receives1 with his ears such sights, as are presented by the Muses.
For every such person it is meet that lodgings should be fitted up near the temples by the kindness of people towards strangers ;
and it is meet for the priests and the sweep­ ers of the temples to take care that, after they have staid a mo­ derate time, and have seen and heard (all), for the sake of which they came, they take their departure, uninjured by doing or suf­ fering any thing;
and let the priests be their judges, should any one of them do an injury to any one, or any one else3 do an in­ jury to any one of them, to within fifty drachms.
But if there be a greater charge laid against them, it is requisite that the trial in such cases be before the Market-Stewards.
The third kind of foreigner it is meet to receive in a public manner, when he arrives from another country on some public busi­ ness.
Him let the Generals, and the Hipparchs, and the Taxiarchs alone receive ;
and let the care of such person rest with that one of the Prytanes, with whom alone any person, received as a stranger, takes up his abode.
The fourth, should he come at any time, is a rarity;
but if he should come, the counterpart of the Inspectors from US,4 let him, first, be not less than fifty years of age;
besides this, let him think it right to see something beautiful, and superior in its beauty to the things in other cities, 5or to show something of the same kind to another city.

Let then every such person come unbidden to the doors of the wealthy and wise, as being himself another of such a kind.
6
And let him go to the house of the party, who is the guardian of the whole of education, trust­ ing that 1 the reception of a stranger by one of those, who have gained a victory for virtue, will be sufficient for a stranger1 of such a kind;
and after being with some of these, and teach­ ing in part, and learning in part,2 let him go away honoured, as a friend should be by friends, with gifts and becoming honours.
According to these laws it is meet to receive all strangers, both male and female, from another country, and to send out our own people, doing honour to Zeus, who presides over hospitality, nor to make an expulsion of foreigners by eatings and sacrifices, as 3the nurslings of the Nile3 do at present, nor yet by savage proclamations.[7.]
Let a person, who makes himself a guarantee, make it in an explicit manner, by acknowledging the whole transaction in writing, before not less than three witnesses, where the guarantee is for a sum under a thousand drachms ;
but, if above a thousand, before not less than five.
4
Let the broker of a person, who sells any thing not justly, or is not trust­ worthy, be a guarantee;
4 and let the broker, like the seller, be amenable to a lawsuit.
If a person wishes to search for his property in the pos­ session of another party, let him, having previously sworn by the gods who preside over laws, that he expects to find (the property), search for it, either naked, or wearing a small cloak and ungirded;
1 and let the other permit him to search the house, and the portions sealed up or unsealed.
But if any one does not allow the search to the party desiring it, let the party, who is prevented, bring an action, after setting a value upon the property sought;
2 and, if the person is convicted, let him pay for twice the loss of the property valued.
If the master of the house happens to be abroad, let those that inhabit it permit the search of such portions as are unsealed, and let the searcher place his own seal by those already sealed, and appoint any person he pleases as a guard for five days.
But if the master is absent for a longer time, let the other party take the City-Stewards along with him, and search it thus, by breaking the seals, and, together with the relations and City-Stewards, seal them again in the same manner (as before).
Of property in dispute 3 it is meet to define the time,3 during which, if a person has held it, it will not be lawful to dispute it any longer.
Of farms and dwellings indeed there will be in this way no dispute.
But of other property, whatever a person may have had in his possession, if he appears to have used it in the city, and market-place, and at sacred rites, 4 (openly for a whole year,) 4 5 and no one has made a claim upon it, and he says he has been seeking (an owner)6 during that time, but that the party has concealed himself and never appeared-if a person has thus held possession of any thing for a year,5 1 and he continues to be the seeker, 1 let it be lawful for no person2 to lay claim to property of this kind, after a year has gone by.
But if a person uses it neither in the city nor in the market-place, but in the fields openly, and no one offers himself during five years (as the owner), let it not be lawful for any one, after the five years have elapsed, to lay claim to it for the remainder of time.
But if any one uses it at home in the city, let the period (of laying claim) be for three years ;
but if he uses it not openly in the country, for ten years;
but if in another land, whenever (the owner) shall find it any where, let there be no definite period in all time for lay­ ing claim to it.
If any one by violence prevents another from being present at a trial, whether the party himself, or his witnesses, or his slave, or that of another person, let the cause be unfinished and undecisive ;
but if (the party prevented) is a free-man, in addition to the cause being unfinished, let (the party pre­ venting) 3 be in bonds for a year, and let him be amenable to a trial for making him a slave at the suit of any one, who wishes.
And if any one by violence prevents an antagonist in a gymnastic or musical or any other contest from being present, let any one, who is willing, inform the prize-dis­ tributors ;
and let them send to the contest a free-man, who is willing to contend ;
but if they are unable (to do so), let them, should he, who has prevented a party from contending, be the victor, assign the reward of victory to the party prevented, and write him down as the victor in whatever temples he pleases ;
but to the party preventing let it not be lawful for any offering or inscription of such a contest to exist;
and let him be amenable to a trial for doing an injury, whether he is de­ feated in the contest, or is the victor.
If any one receives stolen property knowingly, let him un­ dergo the same punishment as the thief.
Let death, too, be the punishment of him, who harbours an exiled For 5 let every one consider the same person a friend and enemy, as the state does.
If any one makes privately a peace' with, or a war against, certain persons, without the public (sharing in it), let death be the punishment for such a one.
But if any part of the state makes a peace with, or a war against, any persons for its own benefit for itself, let the Generals bring the authors of this affair before a court of justice;
and let death be the punishment of the party convicted.
For they, who serve their country in any way, ought to do so without gifts.
And let there be no pretext or argument held out,2 that for good deeds we ought to receive gifts, but not for bad.
For it is not easy either to know,3 or knowing 4to restrain oneself4 patiently, when this knowledge is obtained.
It is, therefore, the safest plan to obey the law—“
Do not serve for gifts "-and let him who does not obey, simply die, when found guilty at a trial.
With regard to the contribution of money to the public, it is meet for the state of each person 5 to be valued, for many reasons ;
and for the parishioners to put down in writing be­ fore the Rural-Stewards the yearly produce, in order that, as there are two contributions, the public may, after deliberating6 every year, make use of whichever it pleases, whether it be a part of the whole valuation, or of the income arising each year, exclusive of the sums paid for the joint-feasts.
It is meet likewise for a man of moderate means to make moderate offerings to the gods.
Now the Earth is the holy hearth of the whole7 domicile of all the gods.
Let no one then consecrate (the same thing) 1 a second time to the gods.
But gold and silver in [other] 2 states, both privately and in temples, is an invidious possession.
3
And ivory, as belonging4 to a body, that has departed from life, is not a pure5 offering to the gods.
And iron and brass are the instruments of war.
6
Let, then, any one offer up whatever he pleases, of wood,7 and of one kind of wood,8 and, in a similar manner, of stone at the public temples ;
and let the woven portion be not more than one month's work for one woman ;
and the colours becoming to a god, both in other things and those woven, should be white;
and offer nothing dyed, except for warlike ornaments.
But the most godlike gifts are birds and pictures, such as a painter could finish in a single day.
And let all the other offer­ ings be imitations after this fashion.
Since then the portions of the whole state have been detailed, as to what number and of what kind they ought to be, and the laws have been mentioned relating to compacts of the greatest moment, it would be requisite that, as to what remains, the lawsuits 9 relating to all matters should be mentioned.
9
In the first place, there should be in the courts of justice selected judges, whom the defendant and plaintiff may choose in com­ mon, having the more becoming name of arbitrators, than of judges.
Secondly, let those of the same village and parish divided according to a twelfth part (be the judges), before whom let those go to contest about greater damages, who shall not have had the cause decided before the first judges;
and let the defendant, if he is defeated a second time, pay the fifth part of the damages I in the indictment.
1
But if any one brings an accusation against the judges, and wishes to contest the matter a third time, let him carry the cause before the select judges;
and if he is again defeated, let him pay the whole of the damages, and the half of it besides.
But if the plaintiff, after being defeated before the first (judges), will not be quiet, but goes to the second, let him, if he is the victor, receive the fifth part;
but if defeated, pay the same portion.
And if the parties go to the third tribunal, not satisfied with the former trials, let the defendant, if defeated, pay 2as has been stated, the whole of the damages, and the half to boot,2 but let the plaintiff pay the half only of the damages.
With respect to the allotments of the tribunals,3 and their fillings up,4 and the appointments of persons 5 to minister to the magistrates, and the times at which each of these ought to take place, and the matters relating to votes, and puttings off, and all that of such a kind necessarily takes place in lawsuits, and the obtaining by lot former and latter (trials) 6 and the necessities of answers,7 and of coming (into court) 1 and all together that are the nearest of kin 2 to these, we have spoken of even before;
3 4 but what is right is beautiful twice and thrice.
4
All such legal matters then, as are of a trifling kind, it is requisite for a young legislator to fill up after an older one has passed them by.
The tribunals re­ lating to private suits, would, when existing in this way, have a sufficient measure.
But those, that are public and com­ mon, and which it is meet for the magistrates to make use of, (so as) to administer affairs suited to each office, 5 are in many states the not unseemly legislation nor few of reason­ able persons;
5 from whence it is requisite for the guardians of the laws to furnish what is suited to the polity now being in a state of birth, by reasoning together, and correcting them­ selves (and) testing by experience, until each of the points shall appear to be laid down sufficiently ;
and then by putting a finish, to place a seal on what is to be thus irremovable, and to use them for the whole of life.
But what relates to the silence and the good-omened language1 of the judges and the contrary, and what in other states, cause 2 (the mind) of the many to change improperly (about) things2 just, good, and honourable, these have been mentioned in part;
but a part will be still mentioned towards the end.
To all of which it is requisite for him, who is about to be an impartial judge accord­ ing to justice, to look, and possessing 3them in writing to learn respecting all.
3
For of all objects of learning the matters laid down relating to laws have the greatest power to make the learner better ;
4 which event, if the laws are laid down correctly, would take place (well) ;
4 or vainly would the law, (considered) by us divine and wonderful, possess a name having an affinity with intellect.
5
And moreover 6of the rest of dis­ courses whatever are detailed in poems, as the praise or blame of some persons, or whatever in prose, whether in writings, or in all the rest of daily meetings, and are disputed about through a love of contention, and through concessions some­ times very foolish6—of all these the writings of the legislator would be the clearest touchstone;
which it behoves a good juryman to possess in himself, the remedies, as it were, against the poison of other discourses ;
and by putting himself and the state in a straight course,1to furnish to the good an abiding and an increase in justice;
1 but to the bad a change, to the best of his power, from ignorance and intemperance, and timidity, and in one word, from all injustice;
to such at least of the bad as have opinions that can be cured;
but to such as have (their opinions) really 2 woven by fate,2 the jurymen and leaders of the jurymen would be deserving of praise from the whole state, by assigning, what would be frequently said justly, death as the cure for minds so disposed.
After the lawsuits, that occur yearly, have been decided upon, and come to an end, it is neces­ sary for carrying out the proceedings after the verdict,3 that these laws should hold good.
Let the magistrate, who tried the cause, hand over to the victor all the monies of the defeated party, except what is required for necessaries, immediately after each verdict has been proclaimed by the cryer and in the hear­ ing of the jury.
And when a month, next upon those, when lawsuits are tried, shall have arrived, unless a party has will­ ingly sent the victor willingly away,4 let the magistrate, who tried the cause, follow the victor, and deliver to him the pro­ perty of the party in his debt.
But if he has not the where­ withal, and there is a deficiency not less than a drachm, let him have no lawsuit against any other person, until he has paid to the full the whole of what is due to the victor ;
but to others let there be lawsuits decisively.
1
And if any one when condemned 2 ( unjustly) takes (any thing)2 from the condemn­ ing magistrate, let the parties unjustly despoiled bring him before the tribunal of the guardians of the laws;
and if he is cast in this suit, let him be punished with death, as one who is destroying the whole state and the laws.[9.]
To a man 3after this,3 who has been born and brought up, and has begotten children and brought them up, and has been mixed up with contracts in a moderate manner, and has made restitution, if he has done any one an injury, and 4 on the other hand received4 (when injured)5 what is just in law,6 7(and) in turn7 has grown old, his end would take place ac­ cording to nature.
With respect then to the dead, whether a person be male or female, let the interpreters (of the gods) have full powers to 8 detail the laws of the gods under the earth, and of those here relating to things divine 10 (and) what it is proper to be done.
But let the receptacles be in such spots as are not cultivated at all;
nor let the monument be either great or small;
but such spots, as being useless, possess11 a nature fitted for that alone, and which easily receive and conceal the bodies of the dead in the least painful manner to the living, these (it is meet) to fill up.
1 For whatever the earth, being a mother, naturally wishes to bear as food for man, of this1 let no one alive or dead deprive any of us still living.
And heap up no mound higher than what would be the completed work of five men in five days.
And make not the upright tomb-stones greater than what may contain the praises of the deceased in not more than four heroic verses.
And let the laying out of the corpse within (the house), be 2 for not a shorter or longer 2 time than to show3 that the person is in a death-like trance, or really dead.
But the carrying out to the tomb would, as human affairs are, be for a moderate period on the third day nearly.
It is meet likewise to be persuaded by the legislator on other points, namely, when he says that soul is altogether superior to body;
and that there is nothing, but the soul, which causes each of us to be 4in this life the very thing we are ;
4 and that the body, like an image, follows each of us;
and that, when we are dead, the bodies of the deceased are beautifully said to be image-like forms;
and that each of us, being in reality immortal,5 but called by the name of soul, depart to other gods, to render an ac­ count, as the law of our country asserts, full of confidence to the good, but very fearful to the bad;
and that to this (last) one there is no great assistance when dead.
For it behoved all the relatives to aid the living man, so that he might have lived, when living, most just and holy, and when dead, have been punished for his wicked sins, during the life after this.
Since then such is the case, there is no need to ruin a family by acting in a luxurious manner,2 through thinking that the mass of flesh, which is buried, belongs to him ;
3 but not that his son, who lies dead,3 or brother, or whomsoever he regrets the most, and conceives he is burying, has departed, after bringing to an end and fulfilling his fate ;
and that he ought 5to do the best with present events,5 by ex­ pending a moderate sum upon, as it were, 6the lifeless altar of those in the earthy Now the legislature would divine what this moderate (expense) would be in not the most unseemly manner.
Let this then be the law.
By him in the highest census of property let there be expended not more than five minæ on the whole funeral ;
by him of the second class, three minæ ;
and two, by him of the third ;
and let one mina be the measure of expense to him of the fourth.
7
And it is necessary for the guardians of the laws 8 to do many other things,8 and to take care of many things, and especially of this, that they may live attending to boys and men, and 1persons of every age.
1
And moreover, at the end (of the life) of all, let one of the guardians of the laws, whom the relations of the deceased shall 2take as a superintendent,2 act as president,3 4to whom let whatever takes place in a proper and moderate manner be an honour ;
but what in not a proper manner, a disgrace.
4
And let the laying out, and (carrying out),5 and all the rest relat­ ing to such matters, take place according to this law.
But things of this kind it is meet to give up to the legislator, who lays down a political law.
6
It would be a thing unseemly to order, or not, persons to weep for the dead;
but it is neces­ sary 7 to forbid them to lament loudly, and to send the voice like that of a messenger 8 out of the house, and to bring forth 9 the corpse into the open part of the roads,1O and to talk 11 while go­ ing along the paths, and to go12 out of the city before day.
Let such laws then be thus laid down on these points;
and let him, who is obedient, be exempt from punishment;
but let him, who disobeys one of the guardians of the laws, be punished by a punishment that appears fit to all in common.
What other burials, or non-burials, in the case of persons guilty of parricide and sacrilege, and all acts of such a kind, take place of the dead, these have been spoken of in our previous discourse and laid down by law ;
so that our legislation would now have nearly arrived at the end.
But the end is not in having on each occasion done of nearly all matters something, nor in possessing and in settling, 1 but in having discovered a preservation for what has been produced, and in thinking that all, which ought to have been done, has been then done com­ pletely;
but previously, that the whole is incomplete.
1CUn.
You speak well, 0 guest.
But tell me still more clear­ ly, for what purpose has been said, what has just now been said ?[10.]
Athen.
Much, Clinias, of former (sayings) have been hymned beautifully, and nearly not the least so are the appel­ lations of the Fates.
CUn.
What are these ?
Athen.
In Lachesis being the first, Clotho the second, and Atropos the third, 2 the saviour of what has been asserted, things assimilated by that of those woven by fire, of working out a power not to be turned aside ;
which in a city and polity ought not only to furnish health and safety to bodies, but a good state of law in souls, or rather the preservation of laws.
But it appears to me that this is yet wanting to laws, how it is needful3 for a power to exist in them to be according to nature not turned.
CUn.
You speak of no small affair, if it is possible to find how a thing of this kind may exist in every possession.
A then.
But this is possible, as it appears to me, in every respect at present.
Clin.
Let us then by all means not separate until we have supplied this very thing to the laws already mentioned.
For it is ridiculous to labour at any thing in vain, and not to lay down something stable.
Megil.
You correctly exhort me:
and you will find me to be such another person.
Clin.
You speak indeed well.
What then, say you, would this preservation be, and after what fashion for our polity and laws ?
Athen.
Have we not said that an assembly ought to be held in our city of this kind-That ten of the oldest guar­ dians of the laws and those, who have received the prizes for good conduct, ought ever to be gathered together at the same spot [with them] ?1 and further, that those, who had gone abroad2 to make a search, if perchance it has happened to them to hear of any thing opportune for guarding the laws, (ought),3 on arriving safe at home, to be voted, 4 after having been tested by these very doings, worthy to become par­ takers of the assembly?
4 and in addition to this, that each ought to take as an ally one of the young men, not less than thirty years of age, 5 and that he himself, after deciding that the young man was a worthy character both by nature and nurture, should introduce him to the others ;
and, if it should seem good to the others, that he should take him as an ally;
but if not, that the judgment, which may have taken place, should be kept secret from the rest, and especially the party rejected;
5 and that the assembly ought to be at day-break, when there is leisure for the most part to every one from all other business, both public and private ?
Something of this kind was stated by us in the preceding discourse.
Athen.
Resuming then the subject relating to this very as- sembly, I would say something of this kind.
I assert then that if any one throws out this, as an anchor1 for the whole city, that it has in itself every thing requisite to preserve all we wish.
Athen. 2
On what comes after this an opportunity will occur for our speaking correctly, and to omit nothing of our readi­ ness (to act).
2CUn.
You speak exceedingly well;
and do as you intend.
Athen.
It is meet therefore, Clinias, to understand that with respect to every thing there is a saviour suited to each kind of work;
as in an animal, the soul and the head are na­ turally the greatest.
Clin.
How again say you ?
Athen.
The power of these two, doubtless, affords safety to the whole animal.
Athen.
In soul there is, besides other things, intellect im­ planted ;
and in the head, besides other things, sight and hearing.
And, in short, intellect being mingled with the most beautiful senses, and becoming one, it would justly be called the preservation of each.
Clin.
It appears so at least.
A then.
So indeed it appears.
But would not intellect, when conversant about something, and mingled with the senses, be­ come the safety of vessels, both in storms and fair weather ?
Do not, in the case of a ship, the pilot and the sailors, by ming­ ling their senses with the intellect of the pilot, preserve both themselves and what relates to the ship ?
Athen.
But there is no need of many examples relating to things of this kind ;
but let us consider, as in the case of armies, and (diseases),3 after laying down what mark would both generals and all the ministering of physicians direct their aim (for the sake) of preservation.
1 Clin.
Very right.
1Athen.
Does not the former (aim at) victory, and the power over the enemy ?
and the latter 2 [of physicians and their assist­ ants,]2 at a preparation for the health of the body ?
Athen.
But if the physician is ignorant of that relating to the body, which we now call health, or the general of that re­ lating to victory, or of the other things we have mentioned, would either appear to possess intellect relating to any of these matters ?
Clin.
How could they ?
A then.
But what with respect to a city ?
If any one is ig­ norant of the mark, at which a statesman ought to look, could he in the first place be justly denominated a ruler?
And in the next, would he be able to preserve that, of the scope of which he knows nothing at all ?
Clin.
How could he ?[11.]
Athen.
It is necessary therefore now, as it seems, if the settlement of this our country is to have an end, that there should be something in it, that knows, in the first place, what we call the mark, 3 whatever that may happen to be in a states­ man's view ;
3 next, after what manner it is requisite to partake of it;
and which of the laws first, and, afterwards, who among men, will properly or improperly consult with a view to it.
But if there shall be any state devoid of a thing of this kind, it will not be wonderful, if, by being mindless and senseless, it should on each occasion perform in each of its doings what­ ever presents itself by chance.
Clin.
You speak the truth.
Athen.
Now then, in what part of our state, or pursuits, is there any sufficient guard whatever prepared of such a kind ?
Have it we in our power to tell ?
Clin.
Not I indeed, guest, clearly.
But, if I must make a guess, this discourse seems to me to tend to that assembly, which you said ought to come together at night.
Athen.
You have rightly understood me, Clinias;
and, as the present reasoning indicates, this (assembly) ought to pos­ sess every virtue;
the beginning of which is not to be wander­ ing, by guessing at many things, but by looking to one thing, always to direct every thought, like arrows, to this.
CUn.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Now then we shall learn that it is not a wonderful thing for the legal institutions of cities to wander;
because the system of laws in each city looks, one to one thing, and another to another.
And for 1 the most part it is no wonder that1 to some the limit is that of what is just, in order that certain persons, whether they happen to be better or worse, may have dominion over the state ;
to others, that they may be wealthy, whether they are slaves of certain persons, or not;
the atten­ tion of others again is urged on to a life forsooth of liberty;
but others are regulated by laws, 2 like two united,2 looking to both, that they may be free (themselves),3 and the lords of other states.
But the wisest, as they think themselves, (look) to these, and to all such points as these together, and not to any one (singly),4 as they are unable to mention any one thing held in pre-eminent honour, to which it is needful for them to direct5 the rest.
Clin.
Would not then, 0 guest, our assertion formerly laid down be right;
for we said that the whole of our laws ought always to look to one point;
and we conceded that this might be called very correctly virtue.
Athen.
Yes.
Clin:
And we laid down surely that virtue is fourfold.
Athen.
Entirely so.
CUn.
And that of all these, intellect was the leader, to which all other things, and three of the virtues, ought to look.
Athen.
You have followed me in a most beautiful manner, Clinias;
and follow me too in what remains.
For we have said, that the intellect of the pilot, and of the physician, and of the ge­ neral, looks to that one point, 1 to which it ought to look ;
1 but examining the intellect of the statesman, we are at that point now;
and interrogating it, as if it were a person, we will say- 0 wonderful creature, to what point are you looking ?
What is that one thing, of which the intellect of the physician can speak in a clear manner?
but of which you, who are forsooth 2 superior, as you would say, to all clever persons, will not have it in your power to speak ?
Or can you, Megillus and Clinias, define and speak for him, and tell me what it is, as I have defined to you in behalf of many other matters ?
CUn.
By no means, guest.
Athen.
But what, 3 ought we not to be desirous of knowing well3 what it is, and in what it is ?
Clin. 4
In what, for example, do you mean ?
4Athen.
For example, when we said that there are four spe­ cies of virtue, it is evidently necessary to say that each is one, since they are four.
Athen.
And yet we call all these one.
For we say that fortitude is a virtue, and that prudence is a virtue, and the two others (likewise), as if this virtue was not in reality many things, but only one.
CUn.
Entirely so.Athen.
So far, then, as these two differ from each other, and have received two names, and the other two (likewise), there is no difficulty in speaking of them;
but so far as we apply to both one (name) of virtue, and to the others (likewise), it is not easy to speak of them.
Clin.
How say you ?
Athen.
It is not difficult to explain what I mean.
For let us distribute among ourselves the (business of) interrogating and answering.
Clin.
How again are you speaking ?
Athen.
Ask me why, when speaking of virtue as one thing, we have given this appellation to two things, one of which is fortitude, and the other prudence ?
for I will tell you the reason.
Because one of these is conversant with fear, from whence1 both wild beasts participate in fortitude, and so do the habits of children very young.
For the soul may be brave without reason and from nature ;
but on the other hand, with­ out reason it never has been prudent and possessed of intellect, nor is it so now, nor will it ever be, since this is a different thing.
2Clin.
You speak truly.
Athen.
In what way then these are different and two, you have received from me through the reasoning;
but in what way they are one and the same, do you on the other hand tell me.
But bear in mind that you are going to tell me in what way, being four, they are one;
and require of me (to tell),3 after you have shown that they are one, in what way they are again four.
And after this, let us consider whether for him,4 who would know sufficiently respecting any thing what­ ever, to which there is both a name and a definition, it is meet to know only the name, but to be ignorant of the definition ;
or whether it is disgraceful for him, who knows5 something of what excels in magnitude and beauty, to be ignorant of all such matters as these..
Clin.
It appears so.
Athen.
But is there any thing of greater consequence for a legislator and a guardian of the laws, and for him, who is thought to excel all others in virtue, and who has received the rewards of victory in these very points, than fortitude, temperance, justice, and prudence?
CUn.
How can there be ?
Athen.
On these points then ought not holy interpreters, and teachers, and legislators, and the guardians of others, to (speak)1 to him, who requests to know and to perceive, or who requests to be punished and reproved 2 when erring, by teach­ ing him what power virtue and vice possess, and by showing that they (themselves) excel the rest in every respect ?
Or must some poet come3 to the city, or an instructor of youth, and assert that he is seen to be better than him, who has been the victor in every virtue ?
And then will it appear wonder­ ful in a state like this, where both in word and deed the guar­ dians would be incompetent through their4 not having correctly4 a knowledge of virtue, that such a state, by being without a guard, should suffer what the majority of existing states suffer ?
Clin.
Not at all (wonderful), as it seems.[12.]
Athen.
What then, must we do what we just now said ?
Or how must we make the guardians more exact with respect to virtue, in deed and word, than the masses ?
Or after what manner will our state be assimilated to the head and senses of the prudent, through possessing in itself a guard of this kind ?
Clin.
How then, 0 guest, and after what manner, shall we speak, assimilating it to a thing of this kind ?
Athen.
It is evident 5 that, while the state itself is (the re­ semblance) of a cavity,5 the young of the guards, who are selected, as it were,1 for the top of the head, as being of the best disposition, and possess a quickness of perception in their whole soul, survey the whole state in a circle ;
and, while guarding it, they deliver up the senses to memory, and become the announcers to the elders of every thing in the state ;
and that these [the elders],2 being assimilated to intellect, through considering pre-eminently many matters and those worthy of regard, enter into consultations, and employ the young, as agents, in their joint deliberations;
and thus both truly pre­ serve the whole state in common.
Whether then shall we say that they are to be established in this manner, or how otherwise ?
Or that they all possess all things equally,3 and that some of them have been brought up and educated in not the most exact manner?
4CUn.
But this, 0 wonderful man, is impossible.
Athen.
Let us then proceed to a more accurate education than the former.
CUn.
By all means.
Athen.
Would not that, which we almost touched just now, happen to be the very one, of which we have a want ?
Clin.
Entirely so.
Athen.
Did we not say then, that of each trade the tip-top handicraftsman and guardian ought to be able not only to look to the majority of things, but to hasten onwards to one thing, and to know it, and, after knowing it by looking at it, to ar­ range every thing in order ?
Clin.
Correctly so.
Athen.
Would there be then to any person whatever a speculation or a sight more accurate, respecting any thing whatever, than to be able to look to one form out of many and dissimilar ?
Clin. Perhaps (not).
Athen.
Not perhaps, but in reality, 0 thou godlike man, there is not any method more clear than this to any one.
Clin.
Trusting to you, 0 guest, I admit it;
and in this way let us proceed in our discourse.
Athen.
We must compel, then, as it seems, even the guar­ dians of our divine polity to see accurately, in the first place, what happens amongst all the four virtues to be the same ;
and which, being one thing in fortitude, and temperance, and prudence, and justice, we assert would be properly called by one name, virtue.
This, my friends, if we are willing, let us for the present, as it were 1 squeezing violently, not let go, before we state sufficiently what it is that we must look at, whether as one thing, or as a whole, or as both, or in what­ ever way it exists naturally.
Or, if this escapes us, think we that we shall ever sufficiently possess the things relating to virtue, of which we shall be unable to say, whether it is many things, or four, or one thing ?
If, then, we follow ourselves as fellow-counsellors, we shall by some means devise a plan for this to take place in our state.
But if it seems good to you 2 to dismiss the subject altogether, it is necessary to dismiss it.2Clin.
By the god, who presides over hospitality, we must, 0 guest, dismiss a subject of this kind the least of all, since you appear to us to speak correctly.
But how can any one devise this plan ?
Athen.
Let us not at present speak of the how we can de­ vise it;
but let us first establish firmly by agreement amongst ourselves, whether it is requisite or not.
Clin.
It is doubtless requisite, if possible.[13.]
Athen.
But what, with respect to the beautiful and the good, 3 do we think the same on this point?
3
Must our guardians know only that each of these is many ?
Or that it is one, and how it is so ?
Clin.
It seems almost necessary for them to understand how (each of these) is one.
A then.
But what, (ought they) to understand, but be un­ able to show by arguments 1 (what they understand) ?1Clin.
How so?
For you are speaking of a certain habit be­ longing to a slavedAthen.
But what, with respect to all serious pursuits, is there the same reasoning, that it behoves those, who are to be really guardians of the laws, to know really the matters relating to the truth, and to be competent to interpret them in a dis­ course, and follow them out in deeds, deciding upon the things that exist beautifully according to nature, or do not exist ?
Athen.
Is not then one of the most beautiful things that relating to the gods, which we went through with seriousness, how that they exist, and of how great a power they seem to be the lords;
and that man, as far as he can, ought to know this ;
and, that we ought to pardon the greatest number of those in the state, if they will only follow the voice of the laws;
but that we ought not to commit to persons a share in the guardianship, who have not laboured to acquire every faith in the existence 3 of the gods ;
and that there should be 4 this one object of care,4 namely, never to choose any one for a guardian of the laws, who is not a divine man, and has not laboured for them,5 nor (permit him)6 to become one of those selected for his virtue.
Clin.
It is just then, as you say, for him, who is inactive on matters of this kind, or unable to give a reply,1 (to be)2 at a distance from honourable affairs.
Athen.
Do we then not know, that there are two things relating to the gods, which lead to a belief in what we have gone through in our previous discourse ?
Clin.
What are they ?
Athen.
One is that, which we asserted respecting the soul, that it is the oldest and most divine of all things, of which a motion, by receiving the generation, imparts an 3ever-flowing existence ;
3 and one too is that, concerning the movement, how orderly it is, of the stars and such other things with which 4 mind has, by its power over them, adorned the universe.
4
For he, who views these matters in neither a mean manner nor like a common individual, has never been an atheistical person, so as not to be affected in a manner the contrary to what would be expected by the many.
For they imagine that those, who take in hand subjects of this kind through astronomy and other necessary5 arts in conjunction with it, become atheists from having seen that it is possible for things to exist by necessity and not from the 6intellect of a divine plan6 relating to good things to be brought to pass.
CUn.
How then would it exist ?
Athen.
All things,7 as I have said, are in a contrary state now to what they were, when those, who thought upon them, conceived them to be without soul.
1
A feeling of wonder crept even then upon the mind respecting them;
and what is now really determined upon, was suspected then by such as touched upon accuracy, how that things without soul would never have made use of reasonings wonderful for their accu­ racy, had they not possessed intellect.
1
And some indeed dared to hazard this very doctrine even at that period, by say­ ing that 2it was Mind, which put into order every thing in heaven.
2
3But the same persons erred again3 about the nature of the soul, (by not knowing)4 that it is older than body;
but con­ ceiving it to be younger,5 they did, so to say, overturn all things, and themselves much more.
6
For 7 all things, that were before their eyes, while carried along the heavens, appeared to them to be full of stones and earth, and many other soulless bodies, that furnished reasons for the existence of the whole world.
7 8
These doctrines it was that caused much of atheism and dis­ gust to flit about amongst such persons.
8
Moreover revilings have come from the poets, (so that,) while likening philoso­ phers to dogs that make use of vain bowlings, they said, 1 on the other hand, other senseless things.
1
But now, as I have said, all the contrary takes place.
CUn.
How could this be ?[14.]
Athen.
It is not possible for any mortal man ever to become firmly pious, who does not receive these two things, that the soul is the oldest of all things, which share in generation and is immortal;
and that it rules over all bodies.
And in addition to this, what has been said very often, who shall re­ ceive 2 the mind said of beings in the stars,2 and the necessary learning before 3 these subjects, 4and after beholding the coin­ munion in these according to the Muse,4 shall make use (of it) in a manner fitting to the pursuits of morals and legal institu­ tions ;
and shall be able to give a reason for such things as admit of a reason, 5 and do not.
5
Now he, who is not able to acquire these in addition to public virtues, will scarcely ever become a competent ruler over a whole state;
but he would be a minister to other rulers.
It is then, Clinias and Megillus, re­ quisite to see 1 in addition to all the laws already detailed, which we have gone through,1 whether we can bring this nocturnal meeting of the rulers to be a guard,2 according to law, for the sake of preservation, after becoming a sharer in the education, such as we have gone through.
Or how shall we act ?
Clin.
But how, 0 thou best of men, should we not bring it, if perchance we are able, even for a little ?
Athen.
Let us then enter altogether into a contest for a thing of this kind at least.
For I will readily be your helper in this ;
and in addition to myself perhaps, through my skill in things of this kind, and my thinking upon them very fre­ quently, I shall find others likewise.
Clin.
Let us, 0 guest, proceed in this path, rather than any other, in which even a god is almost leading us.
But what is the method, which, if it took place, would take place cor­ rectly, this let us now speak of and seek out.
Athen.
Laws about things of this kind, Megillus and Cli­ nias, it is not possible to lay down, until (the whole state)3 is orderly arranged ;
4 for then (one can) lay down, over what it is meet for them to have an authority.
4
5But the furnishing such things at present would be, if it were done correctly, an act of instruction combined with much intercourse.
5Clin.
How so ?
Why do we say that this is mentioned again ?
Athen.
In the first place, a list should be drawn out of those, who would be fitted for the nature of a guard by the power of their time of life, and instruction, and by their morals and manners.
But after this, it is neither easy to find (oneself),6 what one ought to learn, nor to become the disciple of another, who has found it out.
In addition to this, it is a vain thing to state in writing the times 1 which and1 in which it is requisite to obtain each particular.
For not even to the learners themselves would it be manifest, what is learnt oppor­ tunely, before the science of the instruction is generated in the soul of each.
Hence, all, that relates to these matters, being spoken of, would not be said to be properly secrets ;
2 but they (might be said to be) not previously spoken, through nothing of what has been spoken indicating what has been previously spoken.
2Clin.
Since then this is the case, what, 0 guest, must we do ?
Athen.
According to the proverb, friends, it appears 3 we are lying in a common and middle ground.
3
And if we are willing to run a risk respecting the whole polity, we must do all things, by throwing, as they say, either thrice six, or thrice ace.
4
I will, however, undergo the danger with you in stating and explaining, what appears to me respecting the education and nurture, which has been agitated in our con­ versations.
The hazard is, indeed, neither small, nor similar to any others.
But I exhort you, Clinias, to have a care of this.
For you will obtain the greatest renown by establishing correctly the city of the Magnesians, or after what other event a god shall give it a name ;
or you will at least not escape the seeming to be 1the bravest of all born afterwards.'
If then this divine assembly shall be established by us, 0 friends and companions, the city must be delivered to its care ;
2 nor will there be any dispute amongst any one, so to say, of the legislators at present respecting 3 these institutions ;
2 but there will be completed almost 4 a day-dream in a matter, which we touched upon in our discourse a little before as a night dream,4 when we mingled together a certain image of the agreement of the head with intellect;
if indeed these men are accur­ ately mingled together by us, and properly instructed, and when instructed, reside in the acropolis of the country, and become guardians, such as we have never seen in our pre­ vious life, as regards the power of preservation.
Megil.
0 friend Clinias, from all that has been now said by us, we must either give up the city, as regards5 its settle­ ment, or not dismiss this our guest, but by entreaties and all kinds of devices make him a partner with us in settling the city.
CUn.
You speak with the greatest truth, Megillus;
and both myself will act thus, and do you also co-operate.
Megil.
I will co-operate.
