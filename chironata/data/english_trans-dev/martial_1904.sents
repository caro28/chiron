THE literature of imperial Rome has powerfully influenced the civilization of the Western world;
and, amid the vast changes of our social system, still continues to maintain its high place in the republic of letters.
This is due partly to the grandeur of the people by whom the language was spoken, but more so to the illustrious writers who wedded it to intellectual creations that must ever be models for study and admiration.
Among these writers, Martial stands as the first Epigrammatist, not only of his own, but of every succeeding age.
The bent of his genius seems to have lain entirely in this direction.
Everything he penned, whether begging a favour, satirizing a fault, writing all inscription, or paying a compliment, was an epigram.
The word epigram originally signified, as its etymology implies, nothing more than an inscription.
But in the development which it received in the progress of literature, and especially at the hand.
of Martial, it assumed an entirely new character, and may be de­ fined as the concentration of satire and pointed invective in a short poem.
One idea is selected, and to this all the powers of the poet's mind are directed, and made to converge as to a point.
To the gracefulness of the Greek epigram the Romans super- added shrewdness and an acute observation of human nature :
the shafts of Martial are pointed by the same sarcastic feeling which inspired the Epodes of Horace, and the Satires of Juvenal.
In the essentials of brevity and smartness our author seldom or never failed.
Some of his epigrams are, it is true, very obscure to us now, owing to our imperfect acquaintance with the subject of his satire.
And in such a mass it is to be expected that many would be of indifferent merit.
Of this the poet himself was well aware, as we learn from his own words, Book i. Ep. 16 :
Sunt bona, sunt quædam mediocria, sunt mala plura
Quæ legis hie :
aliter non fit, Avite, liber.
Of the epigrams which you read here, some are good.
some middling, many bad:
a book, A vitus, cannot be made in any other way.
But the greater part are unquestionably full of profound wit and humour, and it is only to be regretted that they should be asso­ ciated with so many that must be intolerable to any but an impure taste.
The age of Martial, which just preceded the decline of Ro­ man literature, allowed full scope for epigrammatic satire.
The city of Rome appears, as we learn from Juvenal, and other con­ temporary writers, to have presented one universal scene of villany.
The despotism of the Emperors, the luxury of the patricians, the dissipation of the citizens, and the corruption of public men, had then arrived at a climax.
Every feature of depravity started from the canvass.
The laws of nature were everywhere violated, and iniquity itself acquired a kind of legal acknowledgment.

In every street were found Voluptuous Sybarites with roses crown'd;
The rank Miletan and the Tarentine, Lewd, petulant, and reeling ripe with wino.
"The biography of MARCUS VALERIUS MARTIALIS is involved in some obscurity;
and the little we know of him is chiefly derived from his own writings.
With the exception of Ælius Verus, who designated him as " his Virgil," and the younger Pliny, he does not appear to have been especially noticed by any contemporary writers.
Pliny describes him as a man of acute and lively genius, whose writings abound with an agreeable spirit of wit and satire, conducted at the same time with great candour and good nature.
He also informs us that when Martial left Rome, he made him a present to defray the expenses of his journey, “not only as a testimony of his friendship, but in return for the verses with which he bad complimented him.
"From the above, and occasional allusions made by Spartianus, Lampridius, and the grammarians of the later period, we are enabled to glean so much of Martial's personal history, as that he was born at Bilbilis, in Spain, on the 1st of March, in the third year of Claudius, A. D. 43.
This Bilbilis (the modern Bubiera) was a town of ancient Celtiberia, now known as Arragon, and situated on the river Salo, or Halo, which falls into the Ebro, above Saragossa.
The name of our poet's father (as we learn from the 34th Epigram of his 5th Book) was Fronto, and of his mother Flaccilla.
1
At the age of twenty-one or twenty-two he came to Rome, in the reign of Nero, A. D. 66;
and there he continued to reside during a period of thirty-five years, under the Emperors Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian.
His first intention was to qualify himself for the bar:
but on discovering that he had no genius or inclination for this profession, he applied himself to the study of literature and poesy.
In this pursuit he happily succeeded, and acquired an elegant and versatile style of writing, which introduced him to Silius Italicus, Juvenal, Pliny, and many of the first wits of the age.
It appears that a noble­ man, named Stertinius, conceived so great an esteem for Martial's compositions, that he placed a statue of him, while living, in his library-at that time an unusual honour.
Domitian, the last of the twelve Caesars, whose name has ob­ tained an infamous notoriety in the annals of imperial Rome, con­ ferred many especial favours on Martial, which may be attributed to the adulations bestowed upon him by the poet.
Among other honours Martial was advanced to the tribunate and eques­ trian dignity, and, at the same time, invested with the jus trium liberorum, which conferred on him all the important privileges of a citizen who had three children.
The poet's humiliating pe­ tition for this honour is recorded in Epigram 91 of Book ii.
Martial's continued flattery of the brutal despot of Rome is a drawback on his fame.
His praises of the imperial monster were boundless and unqualified.
Thus in one of his epigrams he invokes Jupiter not to confer favours on himself, but upon the representative of the gods (Cæsar), who, in his munificence, was certain to transfer them to his favoured bard.
And sure enough Domitian rewarded the poet not only with wealth, but with the highest honours;
and this at the very time, as Juvenal, the friend of Martial, expresses it, when the tyrant " daily drain'd, by none withstood, The city of its best and noblest blood.
"On the assassination of Domitian, to whom the senate refused funereal honours, the true character of Martial developed itself.
After having portrayed the emperor, while living, as the pattern of every virtue, he undertook, after death, to expose his fiendlike abominations, and represented him as " the monster of the times, Without one virtue to redeem his crimes.
"
Martial afterwards attempted to pay his court to Trajan;
but that virtuous monarch turned a deaf ear to him.
Being forsaker) by his friends, he directed his thoughts towards his native country which he was enabled to revisit through the liberality of his friend Pliny;
for it appears, according to his own showing, that he was then reduced to great distress.
See Ep. 13, Book v “ Sum, fateor, semperque fui—pauper.
"He there succeeded in gaining the affections of a woman of fortune, named Marcella, whom he eventually married.
He speaks very highly of this lady, who, it appears, was in possession of a magnificent house and gardens, which she settled upon her husband.
After his marriage he completed his 12th Book of Epigrams, at the desire of his friend Priscus, a man of consular dignity, to whom the book is inscribed as his patron.
The other two books, which constitute the 13th and 14th of the series, are entitled "Xenia" and "Apophoreta," and so called from their containing mottoes or devices to be affixed to presents offered to friends, or distributed at the Saturnalia and other festivals.
These fourteen books are preceded by " Spectacula," which are a series of epigrams on the shows exhibited by Titus and Domitiau;
though, as it appears, not all written by Martial himself.
Martial lived in comparative affluence and ease to an advanced period of life;
and died about the 75th year of his age, the 104th of the Christian era.
Many difficulties exist in the chronology of Martial's Epi­ grams ;
but the researches of Lloyd, Dodwell, and Clinton have lone much towards their satisfactory elucidation.
It appears that :
he different books were collected and published by Martial, sometimes singly, and at other times several together.
Their chronology and order of publication are thus stated in Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography:
"
The ‛ Liber de Spectaculis,' and the first nine books of the re­ gular series, involve a great number of historical allusions, ex­ ending from the games of Titus, A. D. 80, to the return of Do­ nitian from the Sarmatian expedition, in January, A. D. 94.
The econd book could not have been written until after the commence­ ment of the Dacian war (ii. 2), that is, not before A. D. 86, nor the ixth until after the triumph over the Dacians and Germans (A. D. l);
the seventh was written while the Sarmatian war, which be­ an in A. D. 93, was still in progress, and reaches to the end of hat year.
The eighth book opens in January, A. D. 94;
the ninth !
so refers to the same epoch, but may, as Clinton supposes, have been written in A. D. 95.
The whole of these were composed nt Rome, except the third, which was written during a tour in Gallis Togata.
The tenth book was published twice :
the first edition was given hastisly to the world;
the second edition, that which we now read (x. 2), celebrates the arrival of Trajan at Rome, after his ac­ cession to the throne (x. 6, 7, 34, 72).
Now since this event took place A. D. 99, and since the twenty-fourth epigram of this book was written in honour of the author's fifty-seventh birth-day, we are thus supplied with the data requisite for fixing the epoch of his birth;
and since at the close of the book (x. 104) he had been thirty-four years at Rome, we can thence calculate the time when he left Spain.
The eleventh book seems to have been published at Rome early in A. D. 100, and at the close of the year he re­ turned to Bilbilis.
After keeping silence for three years (xii. pro­ em.), the twelfth book was despatched from Bilbilis to Rome (xii. 3, 18), and in this he refers (xii. 5) to the two preceding books, published, as we have seen, in A. D. 99 and 100.
”Martial, though he often offends by gross indelicacies of expres­ sion, or pruriency of thought, stands preëminent, not only as an epigrammatist, but as one of the purest Latin writers of his age;
and his style and manner have been generally copied by the wits of all succeeding periods.
Yet there are few authors who have been more exposed to criticism.
Some have bestowed upon him the most unqualified praise, while others have treated him with the grossest scurrility.
The learned Scaliger declares that many of his epigrams " are divine, and his style pure and ex­ act," and Morhofius, in his " Polyhistor," speaks of his " elegant knowledge of the Latin tongue."
Vossius, on the contrary, coin. tends that Martial was one of those authors who taught vice while reproving it;
and that, though he deserves commendation for many of his epigrams, yet by those which are obscene he did more harm than by others he had done good.
Notwithstanding the conflicting opinions of his numerous critics it is perhaps not too much to say, that the writings of Martial will be read and admired so long as the Latin language shal continue to be understood.
They are pervaded by a vein of wi and fund of information concerning the manners and customs a the important age in which he lived, that will always render hin valuable and interesting both to the archeologist and the studen of human nature-LET barbarian1 Memphis keep silence concerning the won.

Which did thy horn-framed altar lately crown ;

Let far-famed Babylon be praised no more;
Let not Ionia vaunt Diana's fane;
Nor let the Carian town exalt so high Its mausoleum, hanging in the sky;
In Cæsar's amphitheatre are shown Those rival glories all combined in one:
Let Fame henceforth her clamorous tongue confine
To sing the beauties of that dome divine.

Here, where the starry Colossus1 surveys the skies from a nearer point than we, and where lofty scaffoldings2 now rise in the midst of the street, the detested halls of a cruel king lately glistened,1 and one single mansion began to occupy the whole space of the city.
Here, where the venerable2 mass of the far-seen Amphitheatre now rises, were the ponds of Nero.
Here, where we gaze with admiration at the Thermæ, a boon so suddenly bestowed,3 a proud lawn bad deprived poor wretches of their homes.
Where the Claudian portico now throws its wide-spreading shadows, was the last remnant of a falling court.
Rome has been restored to herself, and what were formerly the delights of the master, are now, under thy rule, Cæsar, those of the people.
Where the ethereal Colon does appear, The tow'ring Machine to the stars draw near, The hated court, which so much blood did spill, Late stood:
one house the city seem'd to fill!
Where the stupendous theatre's great pile
Is reared, there Nero's fish-ponds were erewhile.
Here, where the Baths, a great yet speedy gift, All men admire (the people left to shift For dwellings) late was a proud ample space, Reserved to boast an insolent state and grace.
Where now a goodly terrace does extend, The city both with shade and walks befriend, Was but the court's fag and expiring end.
Rome's to itself restored ;
in Cæsar's reign
The prince's pleasures now the people gain.
Anon. 1695.
Where the Colossal star would stars survey, And rising machinations maze the way, Diverged the courts of an invidious crown, And one vast house monopolized the town.
Here, where the awful pile displays the show, A pond of Nero could presume to flow.
We there the Baths, the sudden boons, admire, Where the proud lawn bade wretches' homes retire.
Where Claudius' portico expands her shade, Was the last stand a falling palace made.

What race is so distant from us, what race so barbarous Cæsar, as that from it no spectator is present in thy city !
The cultivator of Rhodope is here from Orpheus' Hæmus :
the Sarmatian nourished by the blood drawn from his steed, is here.
He too who drinks the waters of the Nile where it first becomes known to us, and he whose shores the surge of the remotest ocean laves.
The Arabian has hastened hither, the Sabæans have hastened, and Cilicians have here drip­ ped with showers of their own perfume.
With locks twist­ ed into a knot, are come the Sicambrians;
and with hair twisted in other forms, the Æthiopians.
Though different the speech of the various races, there is but one utter­ ance, when thou art hailed as the true father of the country.
Most potent sir!
what region is so rude
From whence into your city none intrude ?
The Rhodopeian farmer leaves cold Thrace, And to banquet his eyes elects this place :
Tartarians, who quaff horses' blood at home Are much impatient till they have view'd Rome.
They who first give a welcome to the Nile ;
And they on whom sweet Zephyrus doth smile.
Both the Arabias are in rapid haste ;
For perfumed water Asia comes not last.
Shall we omit knot-hair'd Sicambrians, And nature's frizzled Æthiopians ?
Their languages are discrepant;
yet all The father of your country can you call.

What land's so barb'rous, Cæsar, so remote, Whose natives come not to admire thv court ?
Rough Thracians hither from Mount Hæmus speed ;
Fierce Tartars, who on flesh of horses feed ;
Who the Nile drink at the first spring and head ;
Britons from utmost
Thule hither led.
Arabs make haste, Cilicians posting come, And in their saffron showers are drench'd at Rome;
Germans with rolling locks in knots upfurl'd;
Ethiops after a diff"rent manner curl'd.
Various their voices sound, but hearts, we see, And the whole jargon, does in one agree When Father of thy Country all style thee.
Anon. 1695.
What scene sequestered, or what rude renown, Sends no spectators to th' imperial town ?
The Rhodopeian hind here scours the plains, And tunes from Hæmus his Orphean strains;
Sarmatians, Caesar, hie thy works to see, And their proud horses share their master's glee;
They come who first the rising Nile explore, And they who hear remotest Tethys' roar;
The Arab hastes, the Sabean hither flies, And the Cilician spurns his native skies ;
With tortured tresses, here Sicambrians gay, There Ethiops stroll along the crowded way.
'Mid various tongues, but one glad voice we find, Which hails thee father of converged mankind.

As erst, bound down upon the Scythian rock, Prometheus with ever-renewed vitals feasted the untiring vulture, so has Laureolus, suspended on no feigned cross, offered his defenceless entrails to a Caledonian bear.
His mangled limbs quivered, every part dripping with gore, and in his whole body no shape was to be found.
In short, be suffered such punishment as one who bad been guilty of parricide, or who had cut his master's throat, or had insanely despoiled the temples of their hidden gold or had applied the incendiary torch to thee, 0 Rome.
This criminal had surpassed the crimes of ancient story, and what had been fabulous, was in his case a real punishment.
Prometheus to cold Caucasus is chain'd, Whilst by his entrails vultures are sustained:
Wretched Laureolus a northern bear Very sincerely did asunder tear.
Every vein to weep blood was inclined ;
Strict search in Is carcass could no body find.
Thus one that stabb'd his master must have died, Or actors of infernal parricide.
This torment is his due who dares Rome fire, Or who deflowers the gods' most sacred choir.

How powerful was that tusk to whom a bull was a mere ball!

A perfidious lion with ungrateful jaws had wounded his keeper, having dared to attack with violence the hands so well known to him.
But worthy of such a crime was the offender's punishment, and he who would not submit to correc­ tion, succumbed to weapons.
What whould be the characters of men under such a prince, who bids the savage nature of brutes become more gentle!
With deep ingratitude, a lion flew
At 's keeper's throat;
thus his acquaintance slew.
But he received his wages;
since he could Endure no blows, the hunting-spears he should.
Men must be cautelous in carriage, since Beasts are taught morals by our gracious prince.

A trait'rous lion on his keeper flew, In him that fed him durst his teeth imbue.

Anon. 1695.
Whilst Bruin was rolling himself impetuously on the blood-stained arena, he lost the power of flight, entangled in bird-lime.
Henceforth let glittering hunting-spears lie neg­ lected, and their iron points be hid;
no more let the dart fly forth, lanced by the exerted arm.
Let the huntsman surprise his prey in the open air, if beasts are to be caught by the fowler's art.
1A bear roll'd barrels on the bloody sand, And was arrested at bird-lime's command :
There 's no more need to throw the letal spear, Or that a lance should forbid coming near.
Huntsmen may chase the birds unto a bay, If fowlers to catch beasts conceive fair play.
Pecke.
While Bruin wallow'd in th' ensanguin'd sand, He lost, belimed, the needful flight s command.
Now let the gleaming spears in darkness lie, Nor from the twisted arm the jav'lins fly;
In fields of air the huntsman seize his prey, If by the fowler's art we beasts betray.
Elphinston,Amidst the terrible contests by which Caesar imitates the sports of Diana, a light spear having pierced a pregnant she-boar, one of her litter leaped forth from the wound of its wretched mother.
Oh!
cruel Lucina!
was this a delivery ?
She would willingly have died wounded by more weapons, that this sad way to life might have been opened to all her young ones.
Who will now deny that Bacchus owed his birth to the death of his mother ?
you may believe that a deity was so produced;
for thus has a beast been born.
I' th' public huntings Cæsar did allow, A jav'lin swift transfixed a pregnant sow :
Straight from the wounded dam the litter sprung;
Lucina, call'st thou this to bring forth young ?
The dying sow wish'd that her wounds were more, That issues had been made for all her store.
Who denies Bacchus from the womb was torn ?
A god might well, when beasts were this way born.
Anon. 1695Stricken with deadly weapon, and pierced with a mortal wound, the pregnant sow at once lost life and gave it.
Oh!
how unerring was the hand with the well-poised dart!
This I believe to have been Lucina's stroke.
Dying, she ex­ perienced the power of either Diana;
1 hers, by whom the mother was delivered, and hers, by whom the savage beast was destroyed.
Pierced with a. deadly dart, the wounded mother
At one time lost one life and gave another.
How sure the levell'd steel the right hand throws!
This was Lucina's arm, I do suppose.
Diana's double power she did sustain, When th' parent was delivered and yet slain.
Fletcher.
A pregnant sow, pierced with a deadly blow, Her life at once did lose and life bestow.

Anon. 695.A wild she-boar, just about to be delivered of the pledge of her ripen'd womb, gave birth to her offspring, being made a parent by a wound;
nor did the litter lie still-born, but ran about while its mother was falling.
Oh !

While the dam staggered, that stay'd not behind :

That which was the utmost glory of thy renown, Melea­ ger, a boar put to flight, what is it ?
a mere portion of that of Carpophorus.
He, in addition, planted his hunting-spear n a fierce rushing bear, the monarch in the realm of the northern pole;
he also laid low a lion remarkable for its anheard-of size,-a lion, which might have become the hands )f Hercules;
and he then, with a wound from a distance, tretched lifeless a fleet leopard.
And when at length he carried off his prizes, he was still in a condition to engage in new combats.
A boar, Meleager, which gave thee a name, Adds little to Carpophorus's fame:
Who a vast bear, rushing upon him, slew ;
The northern clime a fiercer never knew ;
A lion which became Alcides' hand, Of immense bulk, he laid upon the sand;
Also a pard:
and when the prize was won, He still was fresh, and could yet more have done.
Anon. 1695.
That a bull, snatched up from the midst of the arena, as­ cended to the skies, was a work, not of art, but of piety.
A bull1 had carried Europa through his brothers waves;
but now a bull has borne Alcides to the stars.
Compare now, Fame, the bulls of Cæsar and of Jove:
2 grant that they carried an equal weight, Cæsar's bore it to a greater height.
3
That the bull was snatch'd up into the sky Seems not a pageant, but true piety :
On a bull's back Europa rid at ease, But not to heaven, as did Hercules.
Let Jove and Cæsar's bulls for credit vie ;
Jove's did but swim, and Cæsar's bull can fly.
Pecke.
That from the stage a bull towards heaven did fly Was not th' exploit of art, but deity:
A bull Europa through the surges bore, But with Alcides now 'bove clouds doth soar.
The fact of Cæsar and of Jove compare, Which of the two shall we pronounce most rare ?
Suppose the burdens even;
were that true, The lighter-loaded swam;
the heavier flew.
Anon. 1695.
Rapt from the sand, a bull ascends the skies;
Let not the act, but piety, surprise :
One bore Europa through fraternal main, And one Alcides to th' ethereal reign.

What diff'rent loads through diff'rent mediums rove !

Whereas piously and in suppliant guise the elephant kneel to thee, Cæsar,—that elephant which erewhile was so formi­ dable to the bull his antagonist,-this he does without com­ mand, and with no keeper to teach him:

That thee an elephant suppliant did adore, Who struck with terror a fierce bull before, T' his keeper's art cannot imputed be ;
We must ascribe it to thy deity.
Anon. 1696.

A tigress that had been accustomed to lick the hand of her unsuspecting keeper, an animal of rare beauty from the Hyr­ canian mountains, being enraged, lacerated with maddened tooth a fierce lion;
a strange occurrence, such as had never been known in any age.
She attempted nothing of the sort while she lived in the depth of the forests;
but since she has been amongst us, she has acquired greater ferocity.
The rare-seen glory of th' Hyrcanian land, A tiger, wont to lick his master's hand, In pieces tore a lion in his rage ;
A thing not known before in any age.
He durst not this attempt in forests high:
Beasts among men learn greater cruelty.
Anon. 1695.
The bull, which, lately goaded by flames through the whole arena, had caught up and cast aloft the balls,l succumbed at length, being struck by a more powerful horn, while he im­ agined the elephant might easily be thus tossed.
When the strong bull, enraged by fire, did eye Puppies like men, he mounted them on high ;
But dreaming thus an elephant to toss, He was struck dead by the flinty proboss.

When one faction 1 was calling for Myrinus, the other for Triumphus, Cæsar promised them both with either hand.

Whatever Rhodope is said to have beheld upon Orpheus' stage, your arena, Cæsar, has exhibited to you.
Rocks have crept along, and, marvellous sight!
a wood, such as the grove of the Hesperides is believed to have been, has run.
There was to be seen every species of wild beast mingled with flocks, and above the poet hung many a bird.
But he him­ self was laid low, torn by an ungrateful bear.
Thus, how­ ever, this story, which was before but a fiction, has now be­ come a fact.
2What Thrace on Orpheus' stage was said to see, Cæsar, the sand exhibits here to thee.
The rocks have crept, and the strange wood did move, Such as was once believed th' Hesperian grove.
A mingled troop of all wild beasts were there, And o er the bard a cloud of birds in th' air ;
But he lay torn by the ungrateful bear :
As it came feigned thence, so 't was true here.
Fletcher.
What in the Thracian mount's of Orpheus told, Thy theatre, great Cæsar, did unfold :
The rocks were seen to move, the woods to run, When to his harp the wondrous minstrel sung:
Together with the trees the beasts were led, And hovering birds circled his sacred head.
At last a bear the prophet piecemeal tore, Acted in truth what fabled was before.
Anon. 1695.
Do we wonder that the ground with sudden opening sent forth Orpheus ?
He came from Eurydice who was compelled to return to the shades.
1When Orpheus went down to the regions below, Which men are forbidden to see, He tuned up his lyre, as old histories show, To set his Eurydice free.
All hell was astonished a person so wise Should rashly endanger his life, And venture so far-but how vast their surprise, When they heard that he came for his wife !
To find out a punishment due to his fault Old Pluto long puzzled his brain, But hell had not torments sufficient, he thought-
So he gave him his wife back again.
But pity succeeding soon vanquished his heart, And, pleased with his playing so well, He took her again in reward of his art;
Such merit had music in hell.
While the trembling keepers were exciting the rhinoceros, and the wrath of the huge animal had been long arousing itself, the conflicts of the promised engagement were begin­ ning to be despaired of;
but at length his fury, well-known of old, returned.
For easily as a bull tosses to the skies the balls3 placed upon his horns, so with his double horn did he burl aloft the heavy bear.
While long they roused the hero to engage, And bid his nostrils gather all their rage, In vain the timid guides for battle burned;
When lo!
the glory of his power return'd:
High a huge bear he heaved with double horn, As a bull sends aloft the balls that brave his scorn.
Elphinston,
The bold right hand of the still youthful Carpophorus now directs with unerring blow the Noric hunting-spears.
He carried two steers on his shoulder with ease;
to him suc­ cumbed the bubalus' and the bison.
Fleeing from him, the lion fell headlong among the darts of others.
2
Go now, im­ patient crowd, and complain of the tardy delay to which you are exposed.
The Doric spears, with aim unerring, bore
The gallant arm of youthful Carpophore:
Well might two soft-neck'd steers resign the field ;
To him the buffalo and bison yield.
The lion fled ;
but headlong rush'd a prey.
Fly, madding mob, and chasten dull delay.
Elphinston.
Whoever thou mayst be, who art here a lately arrived spectator from distant lands, upon whom for the first time has shone the vision of the sacred show,-that the goddess of naval warfare may not deceive thee with these ships, nor the water so like to the waves of the sea,—here, awhile since, was the dry land.
Dost thou hesitate to believe it ?
look on, whilst the waves fatigue the god of war.
A short interval, and thou wilt say, "Here but a while since was the sea.
"Thou, late spectator, from a distant shore, Who com'st this day our festal shows t' explore, Be not deceived though naval battles here, And billows like the rolling main appear;
The sea thou now behold'st was land of late:
Believ'st thou not?
A few short moments wait, Till cease the ships to war, the waves to flow, And thou shalt say, 'Twas sea not long ago.
Amos, Gems of Latin Poetry, p. 36.
That the wave in thy nocturnal journey should have spared thee, Leander, cease to wonder:
it was Cæsar's wave.
While the daring Leander was seeking the sweet object of his love, and, exhausted, was just being ingulfed by the swelling waves, the unfortunate adventurer is said to have thus addressed the menacing surges:
"Spare me on my way;
drown me on my return."
1Leander, wonder not curl'd waves thee spare;
These inoffensive surges Caesaris are.
When Tethys stopp'd love-sick Leander's breath, And some few drops would hurry him to death, The poor wretch begged:
0 waft me safe to ground;
When I have seen my dear, let me be drowns.
Pecke.
The gentle band of Nereids sported throughout the sea, and adorned the yielding waves with many an antic.
There was the trident threatening with its barbs, the anchor with its curved prong:
we thought that we looked sometimes on an oar, sometimes on a ship ;
that the constellation of the Laconian twins,2 welcome to sailors, was shining, and that wide-spread­ ing sails were clearly swelling before us.
Who invented such arts in the liquid waves P Thetis either taught these gambols, or learned them.
3
The docile crew of wat'ry nymphs did vie To paint the waves with their vivacity.
A threatening trident, anchor, scalding oar, A stately ship, we beheld from the shore ;
Castor and Pollux, the Pilots delight, And tumid sailcloths, gratified our sight.
To whose invention should we this refer P Did Thetis instruct us, or we teach her ?
Pecke.
Had the ages of yore, Cæsar, given birth to Carpophorus, [barbarian lands would not have boasted of their monsters].
1
Marathonwould not have feared the bull, the woods of Nemea the lion, Arcadia the Mænalian boar.
Had Carpophorus armed his hands, one deadly stroke would have sufficed for the hydra;
by him would the whole of the Chimæra have been stricken down at once.
He would have yoked together the fire-breathing bulls without the assistance of the Colchian princess;
he could have conquered either monster of Pasi­ phae.
Could the fable of the marine prodigy be revived, he alone would release Hesione and Andromeda.
Let all the glories of the praise bestowed on Hercules be counted up;
it is more to have subdued twenty animals at one time.
If former ages had Carpophorus known, Beside himself there would have needed none
The monsters through the world to have subdued ;
Being in truth with all that might endued
Which to the fab'lous heroes gave a name, Raised Jason's, Perseus', Meleager's fame.
Theseus for th' Minotaur had ne'er been crown'd;
For the Nemean lion Hercules renown'd ;
The Hydra which so oft renew'd the fight, At first assault he would have slain outright;
Chimera, of such various figures formed, His powerful band would all at once have storm'd;
The bulls, which from their nostrils breathed a flame, Without a charm, his courage knew to tame:
Hesione'a devouring ore to quail, Andromeda to rescue from the whale.
Let poets then their specious lies relate, How Jove, a matchless hero to create, Two nights did turn to one;
to him allow A term of life twelve labours to go through;
Carpoph'rus' glory yet does his excel, By whom in one day twenty monsters fell.
Anon. 1695.
The task of Augustus had been to embattle fleets, and to arouse the waves with the sound of the naval trumpet.
How inferior is this to what our Cæsar accomplishes!
Thetis and Galatea have beheld in the waves wild animals previously un­ known to them.
Triton has seen chariots glowing along the foaming ocean course,1 and thought the steeds of his master 2 were passing before him;
and Nereus, while he was prepare ing fierce contests with bold vessels, shrunk from going on foot through the liquid ways.
3
Whatever is seen in the circus and the amphitheatre, the rich lake of Cæsar has shown to thee.
Let Fucinus, and the ponds of the dire Nero, be vaunted no more;
and let ages to come remember but this one sea-fight.
The palm of glory to Augustus yield, For framing sea into a pitched field.
How then may Cæsar triumph!
Such beasts are Guests to the waves as sea-queen Thetis scare.
Swift chariots track the main, at whose approach Triton cried out-Here comes King Neptune's coach:
Whilst Nereus for the skirmishes provides, And a whale's back victoriously bestrides.
What Caesaris pleasure, shall the Cirque command ;
The floods react, as mimics to the land.
On Claudius', Nero's lake, let scorn reflect:
Domitian's shows merit entire respect.
Pecke.T' embattle fleets exalts Augustus' reign, And with the naval trump to rouse the main :
Yet what is his to our Augustus' praise P
Or what the ancient to the modern days P Thetis and Galatea stared to own Such savages as they had never known.
Triton beheld, nor to behold abhorr'd,
The steeds he thought the coursers of his lord;
He saw with glee the flying axle glow, Though cover d with the dust of spray below :
For, when to furious fight a Nereus strains, He scorns on foot to scour the liquid plains, Whate'er the Cirque or Theatre surveys, To bless the eyes impartial water plays ;
Absorb'd the Fucine in the Marsian land, The pools of Nero duly still shall stand.
Sunk every scene that wondrous waves bestow, This single sea-fight shall the ages know.
Elphinston.
While Verus and Priscus were prolonging the combat, and the valour of each had been for a long time equal, quarter for the combatants was demanded with great clam­ our.
But Cæsar obeyed his own law.
The law was to fight with a stated reward in view, till by his thumb one of the pair proclaimed himself vanquished :
1but, as was allowed, he frequently gave them dishes and gifts.
2
An end, however, was found for the well-matched contest:
equal they fought, equal they resigned.
Cæsar sent wands to each,3 to each the meed of victory.
Such was the reward that adroit valour received.
Under no other prince save thee, Cæsar, has this ever happened, that, when two fought with each other, both were victors.
When Priscus, Verus, did prolong their fight, Characterized by Mars with equal spite, For their discharge a joint consent applied Itself to Cæsar;
by whom't was denied.
It was the fashion so long to contend
Till the vanquished made signs the fight should end :
And to detain the people to the last, Gifts were provided, and a slight repast.
Even wounds the sword-players did engrave ;
They fought alike ;
or equal scores did leave.
Cæsar acquitted both, gave both the palm :
Thus prowess for her cure acquired a balm.
Before your reign, Cæsar, who thought to see, When champions fight, that both should victors be ?
Pecke.
A hunted hind, as she was fleeing from swift Molossian hounds, and was by various turns contriving a lingering pro­ traction of the fatal moment, halted before Cæsar's feet, sup­ pliant and in pleading guise;
and the hounds touched not their prey 1 Such was the boon which she derived from recognising the emperor.
Cæsar is a divinity :
sacred, sacred is his power believe it;
the beasts of the field have not learned to lie.
The panting doe flung out the headlong hounds, By various doublings on the various grounds.
Spent at th' imperial feet the suppliant stood ;
Her fell pursuers, awed, no more pursued.
'Mid foes, now friends, surrounding safety bless'd;
Instinctive piety that power confess'd.
Cæsarean power let miscreants blind deny:
Believe we those who have not learn'd to lie.
Elphinston.
To yield to superior force is the second honour.
That is an insupportable victory, which an inferior enemy gains.
To bow to nobler foes is almost fame;
The basely-yielded palm alone is shame, W. S. B.Be indulgent to impromptus:
he does not deserve to dis­ please, whose haste, Cæsar, was to please thee.
My haste, though faulty, ought thee to appease:
Pardon his haste, who hasted thee to please.
Anon. 1695.
Race of the Flavii, how much has the third of thy name taken from thee !
It had been almost as well not to have had the other two.
2
How much thy third has wronged thee, Flavian race !
'T were better ne'er to have bred the previous brace.
Anon.
I TRUST that, in these little books of mine, I have observed such self-control, that whoever forms a fair judgment from his own mind can make no complaint of them, since they indulge their sportive fancies without violating the respect due even to persons of the humblest station;
a respect-which was so far disregarded by the authors of antiquity, that they made free use, not only of real, but of great names.
For me, let fame be held in less estimation, and let such talent be the last thing commended in me.
Let the ill-natured interpreter, too, keep himself from meddling with the simple meaning of my jests, and not write my epigrams for me.
1
He acts dishonourably who exercises per­ verse ingenuity on another man's book.
For the free plain­ ness of expression, that is, for the language of epigram, I would apologize, if I were introducing the practice ;
but it is thus that Catullus writes, and Marsus, and Pedo, and Getu­ licus, and every one whose writings are read through.
If any assumes to be so scrupulously nice, however, that it is not allowable to address him, in a single page, in plain language, he may confine himself to this address, or rather to the title of the book.
Epigrams are written for those who are accus­ tomed to be spectators at the games of Flora.
Let not Cato enter my theatre;
or, if he do enter, let him look on.
It appears to me that I shall do only what I have a right to do, it I close my address with the following verses :
-Since you knew the lascivious nature of the rites of sportive Flora, as well as the dissoluteness of the games, and the license of the populace, why, stern Cato, did you enter the theatre P Did you come in only that you might go out again?
When thou didst know the merry feast
Of jocund Flora was at best, Our solemn sports, how loosely free And debonair the vulgar be, Strict Cato, why dOlt thou intrude Into the seated multitude ?
Was it thy frolic here alone Only to enter and begone ?
Fletcher.
When thou the wanton rites of Flora's feast Didst know, the people's license then expressed, Why cam'st thou in, sour Cato, 'mong the rout ?
Didst enter only that thou might'st go out P Anon. 1695.
Why dOlt thou come, great censor of the age, To see the loose diversions of the stage ?
With awful countenance and brow severe, What in the name of goodness dost thou here ?
See the mix'd crowd!
how giddy, lewd, and vain !
Didst thou come in but to go out again ?
Spectator, No. 446.
The man whom you are reading is the very man that you want,-Martial, known over the whole world for his humorous books of epigrams;
to whom, studious reader, you have accorded such honours, while he is alive and has a sense of them, as few poets receive after their death.
This whom thou read'st is he by thee required, Martial, through all the world famed and desired For sharpest books of epigrams, on whom (Ingenious reader) living, without tomb, Thou hast bestow d that high and glorious wreath, Which seldom poets after death receive.
Fletcher.
He unto whom thou art so partial, O reader, is the well-known Martial, The epigrammatist:
while living, Give him the fame thou wouldst be giving
So shall he hear, and feel, and know it:
Post-obits rarely reach a poet.
Byron,
You who are anxious that my books should be with you everywhere, and desire to have them as companions on a long journey, buy a copy of which the parchment leaves are com­ pressed into a small compass.
1
Bestow book-cases upon large volumes;
one hand will hold me.
But that you may not be ignorant where I am to be bought, and wander in un­ certainty over the whole town, you shall, under my guidance, be sure of obtaining me.
Seek Secundus, the freedman of the learned Lucensis, behind the Temple of Peace and the Forum of Pallas.
Where you go, if you'd have a few books to befriend you, And on a long journey have one to attend you, Buy those whose short sides a small skin does go over,- As for great ones, lock up,—me your one hand will cover.
And if you can be struck with such foibles as these, I hope that my trifles their readers will please.
But that you may know where I'm sold, and may n't stray All over the city, I 'll show you the way :
Ask for Wilkie's fam'd shop, near the church of St Paul, Where this book may be had by whoever will call.
Rev. Mr Scott, 1773.
Whoe'er thou be, that wouldst my Muse convey, The light companion of the lengthen'd way;
Purchase the petty skin that crams her strains:
A case huge bodies, her a hand contains.
But, lest thou doubt where she displays her pride, And roam the town, accept herself thy guide.
The learn'd Lucensian's libertine thou 'It find The Fane of Peace and Pallas' Square behind.
Elphinston
Thou preferrest, little book, to dwell in the shops in the Argiletum,1 though my book-case has plenty of room for thee.
Thou art ignorant, alas !
thou art ignorant of the fastidiousness of Rome, the mistress of the world ;
the sons of Mars, believe me, are much too critical.
Nowhere are there louder sneers;
young men and old, and even boys, have the nose of the rhinoceros.
2
After thou hast heard a loud “Bravo!" and art expecting kisses, thou wilt go, tossed to the skies, from the jerked toga.
3
Yet, that thou mayst not so often suffer the corrections of thy master, and that his relentless pen may not so often mark thy vagaries, thou de­ sirest, frolicsome little book, to fly through the air of heaven.
Go, fly ;
but thou wouldst have been safer at home.
Among the stationers th' hadst rather be, My little book, though my shelf's void for thee:
Alas !
thou know'st not Madam Rome's disdain;
Great Mars's sons are of a fiery brain ;
Gibes nowhere are more free;
young men, and old, And boys, their nose up in derision hold:
While thou shalt hear thy praise, and kisses have, Thou shalt be toss'd from th' bosom to the grave.
But thou, for fear thou feel'st thy master's hand,
And thy loose sport should by his reed be scanned, (Lascivious book!) thou seek'st to mount abroad:
Go,fly;
but home were yet thy safer road.
Fletcher.
Why in Pall-mall with Dodsley will you dwell, When in my desk you still might lodge so well?
Little you know, how nice the taste in town:
The meanest of mankind are critics grown.
Sneerers abound ;
the beau, the man in years,
The boy at school, the scoff of Bentley wears.
They cry, " Extremely fine!"
You gorge the lie;
But soon in rockets to the stars shall fly.
You, who castration dread, who hate my strokes, And grave correction of your idle jokes, On wanton wing now sigh abroad to roam:
Away:
-but you might safer be at home.
Hay.
In the booksellers' windows you long to be shown, Little book, though my desk be entirely your own.
You know not our critics have nice judging eyes, And, believe me, the town is prodigiously wise.
Men are loud both their censure and scorn to disclose Young and old, even children, all turn up their nose.
While you fondly expect on Fame's pinions to rise, ’T is a blanket will toss you, my book, to the skies.
But you, that your master may cease to condemn, Nor your sallies be quench'd any more by his phlegm, Are ambitious to leave me, and largely to roam.
Go, fly;
—but you might have been safer at home.
Anon.
If you should chance, Cæsar, to light upon my books, lay aside that look which awes the world.
Even your triumphs have been accustomed to endure jests,1 nor is it any shame to a general to be a subject for witticisms.
Read my verses, I pray you, with that brow with which you behold Thymele 2 and Latinus 3 the buffoon.
The censorship4 may tolerate innocent jokes:
my page indulges in freedoms, but my life is pure.
Cæsar, whene'er you take in hand my books, Awe of the world!
lay by your sterner looks.
Your very triumphs mirth used to admit, Though you yourself were subject of the wit.
With such a face look on my verses, pray, As you'd an antick dance or mimick play.
Let not these harmless sports your censure taste:
My lines are wanton, but my life is chaste.
Old MS. 17th Cent.
I give you a sea-fight, and you give me epigrams:
you wish, I suppose, Marcus, to be set afloat with your book.
I give thee sea-fights, thou a book giv'st me :
Wouldst have me set afloat both it and thee ?
L. H. S.While through the air of heaven the eagle was carrying the youth,' the burden unhurt clung to its anxious talons.
From Cæsar's lions their own prey now succeeds in obtaining mercy, and the hare plays safe in their huge jaws.
Which miracle do you think the greater ?
The author of each is a supreme being:
the one is the work of Cæsar;
the other,2 of Jove.
While with the stripling a cries the welkin rung, The prize, unhurt, in trembling talons hung.
Now the imperial whelps compt ess no prey :
Safe in the lion's jaws the leverets play.
Say, whether gives thy wonder more to rove, The power of Cæsar, or the pounce of Jove ?

The dove, the delight of my friend Stella,3—even with Verona 4 listening will I say it, — has surpassed, Maximus, the sparrow of Catullus.
By so much is my Stella greater than your Catullus, as a dove is greater than a sparrow.
The biller, that my Stella sings (I care not, though Verona hear), We, Maximus, must own, outsprings
The chirper to Catullus dear.
My songster soars as far beyond
The genius you so justly love (Be counted whether bird more fond), As less the sparrow than the dove.

In that you so far only follow the opinions of the grea Thrasea and Cato of consummate virtue, that you still wish to preserve your life, and do not with bared breast rush upon drawn swords, you do, Decianus, what I should wish you to do.
I do not approve of a man who purchases fame with life­ blood, easy to be shed:
I like him who can be praised with­ out dying to obtain it.
That you great Pætus’ maxims so approve.
Or gallant Cato's, as still life to love, Nor run on naked swords with bared bream, You do, my Decian, what I think is best.
I like no squanderers of life for fame:
Give me the man that living makes a name !
Old MS. 17th Century.
Consummate Cato's and great Thrasea's strain, As far as prudence goes, thou dOlt maintain, And not thy breast on naked swords dost run;
What men judge best, that, Decian, thou hast done.
He '8 not approved, who cheaply dies for fame, But, without death, who gets a glorious name.
Anon. 1696.
That you, like Thrasea, or like Cato, great, Pursue their maxims, but decline their fate;
Nor rashly point the dagger to your heart;
More to my wish you act a Roman's part.
I like not him, who fame by death retrieves ;
Give me the man who merits praise, and lives.
Hay.
You wish to appear, Cotta, a pretty man and a great man at one and the same time:

Seeing that there are given to a knight twice five pieces,1 wherefore is twice ten the amount which you spend by your­ self, Sextilianus, in drink?
Long since would the warm water have failed the attendants who carried it, had you not, Sextilianus, been drinking your wine unmixed.

When twice five copper coins to a knight are allotted, With twice ten must Sextilian alone be besotted ?
Wave the tepid had fail'd the meek ministers sure, If Sextilian's good nature had scrupled the pure.

Where the road runs to the towers of the cool Tivoli, sa­ cred to Hercules, and the hoary Albula 3 smokes with sulphu­ reous waters, a milestone, the fourth from the neighbouring city, points out a country retreat, and a hallowed grove, and a domain well beloved of the Muses.
Here a rude portico used to afford cool shade in summer;
a portico, ah!
how nearly the desperate cause of an unheard-of calamity:
for suddenly it fell in ruins, after Regulus had just been conveyed in a carriage and pair from under its high fabric.
Truly Dame Fortune feared our complaints, as she would have been unable to withstand so great odium.
Now even our loss delights its ;
so beneficial is the impression which the very danger pro­ duces ;
since, while standing, the edifice could not have proved to us the existence of the gods.
Near Hercules' Cane, and Tibur's cooling strearns, Where Alba vapours forth pale sulphurous streams, Meadows and lands are seen, a sacred grove, Four miles from Rome, the Muses' care and love:
A rude old portico, near these high-raised, For grateful shade in heats of summer praised, A monstrous fact committed had well nigh;
As Regulus in's chariot passed by, The ponderous fabric rush'd unto the ground, And him and's train did only not confound;
But Fortune did our plaints and curses fear, Nor equal was the odious crime to bear.
The ruin pleases now ;
which did not prove, While yet it stood, what care the gods above Have of good men,—their guardianship and love.
Anon. 1695.
On Tibur's road, to where Alcides towers, And hoary Anio smoking sulphur pours ;
Where laugh the lawns, and groves to Muses dear, And the fourth stone bespeaks Augusta near, An antique porch prolong'd the summer shade:
What a new deed her dotage half essay'd!
Reeling, herself she threw with instant crash, Where Regulus scarce pass'd in his calash.
Sly Fortune started, for herself aware;
Nor could the overwhelming odium bear.
Thus ruins ravish us, and dangers teach :
Still-standing piles could no protection preach.
Elphinston.
When the chaste Arria handed to her Pætus bne sword which she had with her own hand drawn forth from her heart, " If you believe me,” said she, " the wound which I have made gives me no pain;
but it is that which you will make, Pætus, that pains me.
"When Arria to her Pætus gave the sword, With which her chaste and faithful breast she *d gored, " Trust me," said she, “ that I myself have slain I do not grieve;
't is thy death gives me pain."
Anon. 169&
When the chaste Arria drew the reeking sword From her own breast, and gave it to her lord, “ This wound," she said, " believe me, I despise ;
I feel the dagger by which Pætus dies."
Hay.
When the chaste Arria gave the reeking sword, Drawn from her bowels, to her honoured lord, " Pætus,” she cried, “ for this I do not grieve, But for the wound that Pætus must receive."
Rev. At, Scott, 1773
Thus to her much-loved virtuous lord, With tender grief oppressed, Chaste Arria said, and gave the sword Drawn reeking from her breast:
“ Believe me, Pætus, void of pain I 've found the pointed steel;
But, oh !
the wound that you 'll sustain, That wound I doubly feel."
Bouquet, Dublin, 1784.
When from her breast chaste Arria snatch'd the sword, And gave the deathful weapon to her lord, " My wound,” she said, " believe me, does not smart;
But thine alone, my Pætus, pains my heart."

When Arria to her Paetus gave the steel
Which from her bleeding side did newly part, “ For my own wound," she said, “ no pain I feel;
And yet thy wound will stab me to the heart."

When Arria, from her wounded side, To Pætus gave the reeking steel, " I feel not what I've done, she cried;
­ " What Pætus is to do, I feel.”

The pastimes, Cæsar, the sports and the play of the lions, we have seen:
your arena affords you the additional sight of the captured hare returning often in safety from the kindly tooth, and running at large through the open jaws.
Whence is it that the greedy lion can spare his captured prey ?
He is said to be yours:
thence it is that he can show mercy.
Thy lions, mighty Cæsar, shed the glee
On serried nations, they but mean for thee, When with the gentle tooth and generous jaws
The captive wantons, conscious of applause.
Whence has the savage learn'd his prey to spare?
Thine, Cesar, is the lion;
thine the hare.

Oh!
thou who art regarded by me, Julius, as second to none of my companions, if well-tried friendship and long- standing ties are worth anything, already nearly a sixtieth consul is pressing upon thee, and thy life numbers but a few more uncertain days.
Not wisely wouldst thou defer the en­ joyment which thou seest may be denied thee, or consider the past alone as thine own.
Cares and linked chains of dis­ aster are in store ;
joys abide not, but take flight with wing­ ed speed.
Seize them with either hand, and with thy fuL grasp;
even thus they will oft-times pass away and glide from thy closest embrace.
'T is not, believe me, a wise man'a part to say, " I will live."
To-morrow'is life is too late :
live to-day.
Thou, whom (if faith or honour recommends A friend) I rank amongst my dearest friends, Remember, you are now almost threescore;
Few days of life remain, if any more.
Defer not, what no future time insures :
And only what is past, esteem that yours.
Successive cares and trouble for you stay;
Pleasure not so;
it nimbly fleets away.
Then seize it fast;
embrace it ere it flies;
In the embrace it vanishes and dies. " I '11 live to-morrow," will a wise man say ?

Julius, my friend,-for well thy worth may claim, And long-tried faith, that highly honour'd name,— The sixtieth winter wreaths with grey thy brows, And fewer grow the days that Fate allows.
Then reckon not on years thou ne'er mayst see
Nor be the past alone enjoy'd by thee.
For cares await thee and fell sorrow's sting, While Pleasure flies, for ever on the wing.
Then seize her, if thou canst, with both thy hands,
And firmly, for she 'scapes the tightest bands.
No sage will e'er “ I ’ll live to-morrow " say :
To-morrow is too late:
live thou to-day.
W. S. B.Of the epigrams which you read here some are good, some middling, many bad:
a book, Avitus, cannot be made in any other way.
Some good, and some so-so, most of them naught!
Well, if no worse, the book may still be bought.
Anon.
Some things are good, indifferent some, some naught, You read:
a book can't otherwise be wrote.
Anon. 1695.
Here some good things, some middling, more bad, you will see :
Else a book, my Avitus.

Titus urges me to go to the Bar, and often tells me, " The gains are large."
The gains of the husbandman, Titus, are likewise large.
1Thou urgest me to plead;
dost oft repeat, " How great it is a wrong cause to defeat!
That which the ploughman does is also great.
Anon. 1695.
What pleasure can it give you, Tucca, to mix with old Falernian wine new wine stored up in Vatican casks P
What vast amount of good has the most worthless of wine done you ?
or what amount of evil has the best wine done you P
As for us, it is a small matter;
but to murder Falernian, and to put poisonous wine in a Campanian cask, is an atrocity.
Your guests may possibly have deserved to perish:
a wine-jar of such value has not deserved to die.
Tucca, what strange delight is this of thine, To mix the noblest with the vilest wine ?
What so great good, from bad, didst e'er receive ?
Or of what good did thee the good bereave ?'
Our throats to cut may no great matter be ;
To slay Falernian is a high degree
Of murder;
rich Campanian wine t' abuse, I' th’ generous grape rank poison to infuse.
Thy guests may possibly deserve their bane;
Such precious liquor cannot to be slain.
Anon. 1693.
If 1 remember right, Ælia, you had four teeth;
a cough displaced two, another two more.
You can now cough with­ out anxiety all the day long.
A third cough can find no­ thing to do in your mouth.
Ælia just four teeth had, if I told right;
One cough ejected two, another two:
Now she may cough securely day and night;
There 's nothing left for the third cough to do.
Fletcher.
When Gammer Gurton first I knew, Four teeth in all she reckoned:
Comes a damn'd cough and whips out two, And t' other two a second.
Courage, old Dame, and never fear
The third whene'er it comes ;
Give me but t’ other jug of beer, And I '11 insure your gums.

Tell me, what madness is this ?
While a whole crowd of invited guests is looking on, you alone, Cæcilianus, devour the truffles.
What shall I imprecate on you worthy of so large a stomach and throat ?
That you may eat a truffle such as Claudius ate.
What brutishness is this ?
When friends you treat, They looking on, alone you mushrooms eat;
What on such gluttony shall I implore ?
May'st Claudius' mushrooms eat, and ne'er eat more!
Anon. 1696.
When the hand that aimed at the king mistook for him his secretary, it thrust itself to perish into the sacred fire but the generous foe could not endure so cruel a sight, and bade the hero, snatched from the flame, to be set free.
The hand which, despising the fire, Mucius dared to burn, Porsena could not bear to look on.
Greater was the fame and glory of that right hand from being deceived;
had it not missed its aim, it had accomplished less.
When that right hand which aim'd a royal blow Spent on a worthless slave its baffled ire, It rush'd into the flames;
but e'en the foe Admiring snatched it from the sacred fire.
The pangs that fearless Scævola sustain'd, Porsenna's eye endured not to behold :
Had it not err'd, that hand had never -gain'd
So great a fame, or done a deed so bold.
Hodgson.
The hand, which struck the servant for the king, Did in the fire itself a victim fling.
The dreadful wonder moved the pious foe :
He snatch'd the man from flames, and let him go.
Mucius unmoved the hand to burn decreed;
Porsena could not view the tragic deed.
That hand by failing gain'd a nobler fame ;
And less had done, had it not miss'd its aim.

Why, silly hare, are you fleeing from the fierce jaws of the lion now grown tame ?
They have not learned to crush such tiny animals.
Those talons, which you fear, are reserved for mighty necks, nor does a thirst so great delight in so small a draught of blood.
The hare is the prey of hounds;
it does not fill large mouths:
the Dacian boy should not fear Cæsar.
Why, gentle hare, the generous lion fly ?
He has not learn'd to touch the tiny fry.
For brawny necks the griding claw remains :
Enormous thirst the petty draught disdains.
Filling no jaw, thou fall'st to dogs a prey:
Ne'er dread the Dacian boy that Cæsar slay.

You invite no one, Cotta, except those whom you meet at the bath;
and the bath alone supplies you with guests.
I used to wonder why you had never asked me, Cotta;
I know now that my appearance in a state of nature was unpleasing in your eyes.
Cotta, thou invitest none, but such with thee Are bathed, and baths provide thee company:
I wondered long how I escaped thy call, But now I see my naked truth spoil'd all.

You see yonder individual, Decianus, with locks uncombed, whose grave brow even you fear;
who talks incessantly of the Curii and Camilli, defenders of their country's liberties:
do not trust his looks;
he was taken to wife but yesterday.
1
Behold the man, with careless hair, Whose solemn supercilious air Inspires a Decian's self with awe, And so may well give others law ;
Who talks a Curius too, and whom A new Camillus worships Rome :
He, Decian (such the faith of face !)
Veil'd yesterday her new disgrace.

Issue at length your books to the public, Faustinus, and give to the light the work elaborated by your accomplished mind,-a work such as neither the Cecropian city of Pandion would condemn, nor our old men pass by in silence.
Do you hesitate to admit Fame, who is standing before your door;
and does it displease you to receive the reward of your la­ bour P Let the writings, destined to live after you, begin to live through your means.
Glory comes too late, when paid only to our ashes.
At length, Faustinus, let the world obtain
The polish'd pieces of thy learned brain, Which the Athenian schools would highly praise, And our old sages to the stars will raise.
Dost doubt t' admit Fame standing at thy gate?
Thy labour's just reward to bear, dost hate ?
That which will after, in thy time let live :
Too late men praise unto our ashes give.
Anon. 1695.
Your book, Sir George, now give to public use;
From your rich fund the polish'd piece produce:
Which will defy the Louvre's nicer laws;
And from our critics here command applause.
Fame at your portal waits;
the door why barr'd ?
Why loth to take your labours just reward P
Let works live with you, which will long survive;
For honours after death too late arrive.

Sextilianus, you drink as much as five rows of knights1 alone:
you might intoxicate yourself with water, if you so often drank as much.
Nor is it the coin of those who sit near you alone that you consume in drink, but the money of those far removed from you, on the distant benches.
This vintage has not been concerned with Pelignian presses, nor was this juice of the grape produced upon Tuscan heights;
but it is the glorious jar of the long-departed Opimius2 that is drained, and it is the Massic cellar that sends forth its black­ ened casks.
Get dregs of Laletane wine from a tavern- keeper, Sextilianus, if you drink more than ten cups.
3
In thee, the wine of five is sunk:
With as much water, thou wert drunk.
What for thy begging canst allege, From nearest knight, and farthest wedge ?
Nor owns thy grape Pelignian press ;
Or vine the hardy Tuscan's dress.
Thy palate old Opimian asks ;
From Massic cell the sable casks.
From tavern fetch Laletan dreg, Above ten goblets if thou beg.

Last night I had invited you—after some fifty glasses, I suppose, had been despatched-to sup with me to-day.
You immediately thought your fortune was made, and took note of my unsober words, with a precedent but too dangerous.
I hate a boon companion whose memory is good, Procillus.
To sup with me, to thee I did propound, But ’t was when our full cups had oft gone round.
The thing thou straight concludest to be done, Merry and sober words counting all one.
Th' example
Is dangerous at the highest rate;
A memorative drunkard all men hate.

Report says that you, Fidentinus, recite my compositions in public as if they were your own.

The following lines, in imitation of this epigram, were made by some Oxford wit, on Dr John Fell, Bishop of Oxford, who died in 1686:

Gellis does not mourn for her deceased father, when she :
s alone;
but if any one is present, obedient tears spring forth.
He mourns not, Gellia, who seeks to be praised;
he is the true mourner, who mourns without a witness.
When all alone, your tears withstand ;
In company, can floods command.
Who mourns for fashion, bids us mark ;
Who mourns indeed, mourns in the dark.
Anon.Gellia ne'er mourns her father's loss, When no one's by to see, But yet her soon commanded tears Flow in society:
To weep for praise is but a feigned moan;
He grieves most truly, that does grieve alone.
Fletcher.
Her father dead!
Alone no grief she knows ;
Th' obedient tear at every visit flows.
No mourner he, who must with praise be fee'd!
But he who mourns in secret, mourns indeed !
Hay-Gellia alone, alas!
can never weep, Though her fond father perish'd in the deep;
With company the tempest all appears, And beauteous Gellia 's e'en dissolved in tears.
Through public grief though Gellia aims at praise, 'T is private sorrow which must merit raise.
Gentleman's Magazine, 1736,You always take your pleasure, Lesbia, with doors un­ guarded and open, nor are you at any pains to conceal your amusements.
It is more the spectator, than the accomplice in your doings, that pleases you, nor are any pleasures grate­ ful to your taste if they be secret.
Yet the common courte­ san excludes every witness by curtain and by bolt, and few are the chinks in a suburban brothel.
Learn something at least of modesty from Chione, or from Alis:
even the monu­ mental edifices of the dead afford hiding-places for abandoned harlots.
Does my censure seem too harsh ?
I do not ex­ hort you to be chaste, Lesbia, but not to be caught.
Lesbia, thou sinn'st still with an unpinn'd door And open, and ne'er cloak'st thy pleasure o'er;
Thy peepers more than active friends delight, Nor are thy joys in kind, if out of sight
But yet the common wench, with veil and key, Strives to expel the witness far away ;
No chink doth in a brothel-house appear:
Of Alis learn, or Chione, this care.
They hide such filthiness ;
but, Lesbia, see If this my censure seem too hard to be :
I do n't forbid thee to employ thy prime,- But to be taken Lesbia, there's the crime.

You complain, Cornelius, that the verses which I compose are little remarkable for their reserve, and not such as a mas­ ter can read out in his school;
but such effusions, as in the case of man and wife, cannot please without some spice of pleasantry in them.
What if you were to bid me write a hymeneal song in words not suited to hymeneal occasions ?
Who enjoins the use of attire at the Floral games, and im­ poses on the courtesan the reserve of the matron ?
This law has been allowed to frolicsome verses, that without tickling the fancy they cannot please.
Lay aside, therefore, your severe look, I beseech you, and spare my jokes and gaiety, and do not desire to mutilate my compositions.
Nothing is more disgusting than Priapus become a priest of Cybele.

In words befitting funerals!
Who would at Floral games permit Whores clad in modest robes to sit ?
This law to epigrams allowed, They may with lustfull itch go proud.
Therefore, severity, away!
Indulge my sportive Muse, pray ?
Nor seek to geld my wanton books:
A gelt Priapus ugly looks.

Witty lays, like man and wife, Must not always be at strife ;
And, like them, but please by half, If they do not often laugh.
Would'st thou bid Thalassus speak, Not in Latin, but in Greek ?
Who can clothe the Floral game P Who allows a harlot shame ?

If, Lucanus, to thee, or if to thee, Tullus, had been offered such fates as the Laconian children of Leda enjoy, there would have been this noble struggle of affection in both of tou, that each would have wished to die first in place of his bro­ ther ;
and he who should have first descended to the nether realms of shade would have said, " Live, brother, thine own term of days;
live also mine.
"Fraternal love in such strong currents runs,
That, were your fate like that of Leda's sons, This were the single, but the generous, strife, Which for the other first should yield his life:
He first would cry, who first should breath resign, Live thou, dear brother, both thy days and mine.

If there be any man fit to be numbered among one's few choice friends, a man such as the honesty of past times and ancient renown would readily acknowledge;
if any man thoroughly imbued with the accomplishments of the Athenian and Latin Minervas, and exemplary for true integrity;
if there be any man who cherishes what is right, and admires what is honourable, and asks nothing of the gods but what all may hear;
if there be any man sustained by the strength of a great mind, may I die, if that man is not Decianus.
Is there t' enroll among the friendly few, Whose names pure faith and ancient fame renew ?
Is there, enrich'd with virtue's honest store, Deep versed in Latian and Athenian lore ?
Is there who right maintains and truth pursues, Nor knows a wish that Heaven can refuse ?
Is there who can on his great self depend ?
Now let me die, but Harris is this friend.
Dr Hoadley.
Is there a friend, like those distinguished few, Renown'd for faith, whom former ages knew;
Polish'd by art, in every science wise;
Truly sincere, and good without disguise;
Guardian of right, who doth by honour steer;
Who makes no prayer but all the world may hear;
Who doth on fortitude of mind depend ?
I know indeed, but dare not name, that friend.
Hay.
If there's one shall arise among all his rare friends, Whose famed honour and virtue knows no private ends;
If one whose great skill leaves us much at a strife, If in arts he excels, or most simple in life ;
If one who's the guardian of honesty's cause, And in secret asks nothing against divine laws;
If there's one, who on greatness of mind builds his plan, May I die if the Chamberlain won't be the man!

You imagine yourself, Cæcilius, a man of wit.
You are no such thing, believe me.
What then ?
A low buffoon;
such a thing as wanders about in the quarters beyond the Tiber, and barters pale-coloured sulphur matches for brok­ en glass;
such a one as sells boiled peas and beans to the idle crowd;
such as a lord and keeper of snakes;
or as a common servant of the salt-meat-sellers;
or a hoarse- voiced cook who carries round smoking sausages in steaming shops;
or the worst of street poets ;
or a blackguard slave- dealer from Gades ;
1 or a chattering old debauchee.
Cease at length, therefore, to imagine yourself that which is ima­ gined by you alone, Cæcilius, you who could have silenced Gabba, and even Testius Caballus, with your jokes.
It is not given to every one to have taste;
2 he who jests with a stupid effrontery is not a Testius, but a Caballus.

Elphinston,When Porcia bad heard the fate of her consort Brutus, and her grief was seeking the weapon, which had been carefully removed from her, “ Ye know not yet," she cried, “ that death cannot be denied:

She spoke, and with eager mouth swallowed the blazing coals. "
Go now, officious at­ tendants, and refuse me a sword, if you will.

The weapons to deny, my grief's desire."

When Porcia was informed her lord was dead;

Dauntless she gulph'd the embers as they flamed, And, while their heat within her raged, exclaim'd, “ Now, troublous guardians of a life abhorr'd, Still urge your caution, and refuse the sword."

Twice thirty were invited to your table, Mancinus, and nothing was placed before us yesterday but a wild-boar.
Nowhere were to be seen grapes preserved from the late vines, or apples vying in flavour with sweet honey-combs;
nowhere the pears which hang suspended by flexible twigs, or pomegranates the colour of summer roses:
nor did the rustic basket supply its milky cheeses, or the olive emerge from its Picenian jar.
Your wild-boar was by itself:
and it was even of the smallest size, and such a one as might have been slaughtered by an unarmed dwarf.
Besides, none of it was given us ;
we simply looked on it as spectators.
This is the way in which even the arena places a wild-boar before us.
May no wild-boar be placed before you after such doings, but may you be placed before the boar in front of which Chari­ demus was placed.
1Thine invited were yesterday, Mancin, threescore ;
Nor was anything served to thy guests, but a boar.
Not the grapes, that the last from their parent depend ;
Not the apples, that with the sweet comb can contend;
Not the pears, that are bound by the limberly broom :
Or pomegranates, so like fleeting roses in bloom ;
Not a cone of rich clots, from the country afar ;
Not an olive Picenum had pent in a jar.
Naked Aper, quite harmless, the company charm'd ;
And confessed himself slain by a pigmy unarm'd.
But our eyes had the sense, which alone he would feast:
On the sand have we often admired such a beast:
Hence to thee be a tusker presented no more :
But be thou, Charidemus-like, served to a boar.

The keepers could not snatch the bulls from those wide jaws, through which the fleeting prey, the hare, goes and re­ turns in safety;
and, what is still more strange, he starts from his foe with increased swiftness, and contracts something of the great nobleness of the lion's nature.
He is not safer when he courses along the empty arena, nor with equal feel­ ing of security does be hide him in his hutch.
If, venturous hare, you seek to avoid the teeth of the hounds, you have the jaws of the lion to which you may flee for refuge.
In the jaws that deny all retreat to a bull, See the hare come and go ;
and his gambol is full.
O'er his flight as fell fear has lost all her control;
From the foe he takes fire, by contagion of soul.
Not more safe in the course, when thou wanton'st alone;
Or so safe, when thou boastest a home of thine own.
The dire dogs to cast off, thou hast, puss, one sure feat:
In the mouth of the lion thou It find a retreat.
Elphinston,0 thou, whose name must not pe left untold by Celti- berian nations, thou the honour of our common country, Spain, thou, Licinianus, wilt behold the lofty Bilbilis, renowned for horses and arms, and Catus 1 venerable with his locks of snow.
and sacred Vadavero with its broken cliffs, and the sweet grove of delicious Botrodus, which the happy Pomona loves.
Thou wilt breast the gently-flowing water of the warm Con­ gedus and the calm lakes of the Nymphs, and thy body, relaxed by these, thou mayst brace up in the little Salo, which hardens iron.
There Voberca2 herself will supply for thy meals animals which may be brought down close at hand.
The serene summer heat thou wilt disarm by bathing in the golden Tagus, hidden beneath the shades of trees;
thy greedy thirst the fresh Dercenna will appease, and Nutha, which in coldness surpasses snow.
But when hoar December and the furious solstice shall resound with the hoarse blasts of the north-wind, thou wilt again seek the sunny shores of Tarraco and thine own Laletania.
There thou wilt despatch hinds caught in thy supple toils, and native boars ;
and thou wilt tire out the cunning hare with thy hardy steed;
the stags thou wilt leave to thy bailiff.
The neighbouring wood will come down into thy very hearth, surrounded as it will be with a troop of uncombed children.
The huntsman will be in­ vited to thy table, and many a guest called in from the neigh­ bourhood will come to thee.
The crescent-adorned boot a will be nowhere to be seen, nowhere the toga and garments smelling of purple dye.
Far away will be the ill-favoured Liburnian porter4 and the grumbling client;
far away the imperious demands of widows.
The pale criminal will not break thy deep sleep, but all the morning long thou wilt enjoy thy slumber.
Let another earn the grand and wild "Bravo !"
Do thou pity such happy ones, and enjoy with­ out pride true delight, while your friend Sura is crowned with applause.
Not unduly does life demand of us our few remaining days, when fame has as much as is sufficient.
'Mong Celtiberians, thou much-famed man, Spayne's praise, Licinian, Now thou fayre Bilbilis' high-seated ground, For horse and arms renown'd, And old Vadoveron's snow-white bared head With craggy cliffs bespread, And lonely Botrod's pleasant groves, wilt see, Where the brave orchards bee ;

There deere caught in the yielding toyles you may, Or home-fedd brawners, slay;
Or subtle hares with stronger horse runn downe, Leaving the stagg to the clowne.

From press of suitors and lords' companie
And roabes perfumed free ;
From horrid cryers and bold widdows' voyce, And peevish clyents' noyse;
No pale dependant your sound sleepes shall breake, With you i' th' morne to speak.
Whilst others purchase great applause, but vayne, Pity their hapless gaine.
Enjoy true bliss, nor envious bee, whene'er Your Sura's prayBe you heare :
Boldly you may, with fame enough now blest, Live to yourselfe the rest.

No neck, save the proudest, serves for the fierce lion.
Why dost thou, vain-glorious hare, flee from these teeth P
No doubt thou wouldst wish them to stoop from the huge bull to thee, and to crush a neck which they cannot see.
The glory of an illustrious death must be an object of despair to thee.
Thou, a tiny prey, canst not fall before such an enemy!
On nervous necks behold him hang;
Proud puss, why fear the lion's fang ?
From bulls would he descend to thee, Or crush the bones he cannot see ?
Then soar not to a fate so high ;
Nor hope by such a foe to die.

To thee, Quinctianus, do I commend my books, if indeed I can call books mine, which thy poet recites..
If they complain of a grievous yoke, do thou come forward as their advocate, and defend them efficiently ;
and when he calls himself their master, say that they were mine, but have been given 2 by me to the public.
If thou wilt proclaim this three or four times, thou wilt bring shame on the plagiary.
Dear Quintian, to thy happy powers
Our lays (if I may call them ours, Which thy bold bard will needs recite, And swear that once himself could write) I with just confidence commend ;
And shall exact it of my friend, That, if they heavy bondage wail, Thou stand their claimant and their bail:
So when himself the culprit calls
The owner of the wretched thralls, That them as mine thou redemand, As sent to freedom from my band.
This truth if o'er and o'er thou bawl,
The thief thou 'It redden and appal.

One page only in my books belongs to you, Fidentinus.
bat it bears the sure stamp of its master, and accuses your verses of glaring theft.
Just so does a Gallic frock coming in contact with purple city cloaks stain them with grease and filth ;
just so do Arretine 1 pots disgrace vases of crystal;
so is a black crow, straying perchance on the banks of the Cayster, laughed to scorn amid the swans of Leda:
and so, when the sacred grove resounds with the music of the tuneful nightingale, the miscreant magpie disturbs her Attic plaints.
My books need no one to accuse or judge you:

If, Fuscus, thou hast room to receive still more affection, (for thou hast friends around thee on all sides), I ask thee for one place in thy heart, if one still remains vacant, and that thou wilt not refuse because I am a stranger to thee:
all thy old friends were so once.
Simply consider whether he who is presented to you a stranger is likely to become an old friend.
You, whom your faithful friends surround, Can there within your breast be found
One spot another friend to grace ?
Oh!
grant to me that happy place
Refuse me not, because untried;
So once were all your friends beside.
Weigh well the man;
for from the new May grow a good old friend and true Hay,If yet one corner in thy breast Remains, good Fuscus, unpossess'd (For many a friend, I know, is thine), Give me to boast that corner mine.
Nor thou the honour'd place I sue Refuse to an acquaintance new.
The oldest friend of all thy store Was once, 'tis certain, nothing more.
It matters not how late the choice, If but approved by reason's voice!
Then let thy sole inquiry be, If thou canst find such worth in me That, constant as the years are roll'd, Matures new friendship into old.

If thou, Pronto, so distinguished an ornament of military and civil life, desirest to learn the wishes of thy friend Marcus, be prays for this, to be the tiller of his own farm, nor that a large one, and he loves inglorious repose in an unpretending sphere.
Does any one haunt the porticoes of cold variegated Spartan marble, and run to offer, like a fool, his morning greetings, when he might, rich with the spoils of grove and field, unfold before his fire his well-filled nets, and lift the leaping fish with the quivering line, and draw forth the yellow honey from the red 1 cask, while a plump house­ keeper loads his unevenly-propped table, and his own eggs are cooked by an unbought fire ?
That the man who loves not me may not love this life, is my wish;
and let him drag out life pallid with the cares of the city.
Well then, Sir, you shall know how far extend
The prayers and hopes of your poetic friend:
He does not palaces nor manors crave, Would be no lord, but less a lord would have
The ground he holds, if he his own can call, He quarrels not with heaven because 'tis small:
Let gay and toilsome greatness others please,- He loves of homely littleness the ease.
Can any man in gilded rooms attend,
And his dear hours in humble visits spend, When in the fresh and beauteous fields he may With various healthful pleasures fill the day?
If there be man (ye gods!)
I ought to hate, Dependence and attendance be his fate.
Still let him busy be, and in a crowd, And very much a slave, and very proud:
Thus he perhaps powerful and rich may grow;
No matter, 0 ye gods!
that I '11 allow;
But let him peace and freedom never see:
Let him not love this life, who loves not me.
Cowley.
Since you, whom all the world admires,
Would know what your poor friend desires;
Some little spot of earth he prays, To pass incognito his days.
Who'd bear the noisy pomp of state, Or crowd of clients at his gate, That might, in his own fields and wood, Find his diversion and his food ?
His ponds with various fishes stored;
The bees for him their honey hoard;
A nut-brown lass, both kind and neat, To make his bed, and dress his meat.
He that hates me, or likes not this, May he ne'er taste so sweet a bliss, But, fool'd by riches and renown, Still stay behind, and rot in town!
Bouquet, Dublin, 1784.

Do you ask what sort of maid I desire or dislike, Flaccus?
I dislike one too easy, and one too coy.
The just mean, which lies between the two extremes, is what I approve ;
I like neither that which tortures, nor that which cloys.
Wouldst know what temper I to love would choose ?
What maid I like, and what I would refuse ?
I neither like the facile, nor the coy, The overhard, nor easy to enjoy :
A mean 'twixt both I rather do approve, She that nor racks, nor cloys, the sweets of love.
Anon. 1696.
You ask me, dear friend, “ What lass I 'd enjoy ” I would have one that's neither too coming nor coy, A medium is best, that gives us no pain, By too much indulgence, or too much disdain.
Hay.
You ask, were I to change my life, What kind of girl I 'd take to wife ?
Not one who coy or easy seems, I hate alike the two extremes ;
She satiates who at first complies, She starves my love who long denies.
The maid must not, I 'd call my own, Say “ No " too oft, or " Yes " too soon.
Anon.
Ask you, my friend, what kind of she I 'd choose ?
Not one too difficult, or one too .oose;
The moderate fair, indifferently coy, With sense to please, but not too free to cloy;
Whose passions 'twixt the wide extremes are put:
I love no torment, and I hate a slut.

The sportula' at Baiæ brings me in a hundred farthings;
of what use is such a miserable sum in the midst of such sumptuous baths ?
Give me back the darksome baths of Lupus and Gryllus.
When I sup so scantily, Flaccus, why should I bathe so luxuriously ?
An humble hundred, Baian bounty gives :
Amid so nigh delights, what hunger lives!
Restore me Lupus' baths, and Gryllus' gloom :
Why bathe in state, if starving be my doom ?

Hare, although thou enterest the wide jaws of the fierce lion, still he imagines his mouth to be empty.

where the shoulders on which he shall fall ?
where shall he fix those deep bites which he inflicts on young bulls ?
why dost thou in vain weary the lord and monarch of the groves ?
'T is only on the wild prey of his choice that he feeds.
In the muzzled dread repair, Scarce the hero feels the hare.
Glee, my leveret, may be thine ;
Can he rush upon thy chine ?
On thy shoulder can he bound ?
Where infix the fatal wound ?
Vainly, trifler, dost thou scud;
Vainly proffer paltry blood ;
Vainly plague the king of groves:
He for royal victims roves.

Lævina, so chaste as to rival even the Sabine women of old, and more austere than even her stern husband, chanced, while intrusting herself sometimes to the waters of the Lu­ crine lake, sometimes to those of Avernus, and while fre­ quently refreshing herself in the baths of Balm, to fall into the flames of love, and, leaving her husband, fled with a young gallant.
She arrived a Penelope, she departed a Helen.
Lævina, chaste as Sabines were of old, Than her strict husband yet more strict and cold, While in the common baths she did descend, And in those freedoms many hours did spend, She fell in love ;
in the cold streams took fire;
And, burning with a youth in loose desire, She left her husband, and her virtuous name;
Helen went thence, Penelope that came.

You are mistaken, insatiable thief of my writings, who think a poet can be made for the mere expense which copy­ ing, and a cheap volume cost.
The applause of the world is not acquired for six or even ten sesterces.
Seek out for this purpose verses treasured up, and unpublished efforts, known only to one person, and which the father himself of the virgin sheet, that has not been worn and scrubbed by bushy chins, keeps sealed up in his desk.
A well-known book cannot change its master.
But if there is one to be found yet unpolished by the pumice-stone, yet unadorned with bosses and cover, buy it:
I have such by me, and no one shall know it.
Whoever recites another's compositions, and seeks for fame, must buy, not a book, but the author'a silence.
Thou sordid felon of my verse and fame, So cheap dost hope to get a poet's name, As, by the purchase barely of my book, For ten vile pence eternal glory rook ?
Find out some virgin poem ne'er saw the day, Which wary writers in their desk do lay Locked up, and known unto themselves alone ;
Nor one with using torn and sordid grown.
A published work can ne'er the author change, Like one ne'er pass'd the press, that ne'er did range
The world, trimly bound up ;

L. H. S.Whatever Rufus does, Nævia is all in all to him.
Whether he rejoices, or mourns, or is silent, it is ever Nævia.
He eats, be drinks, he asks, he refuses, he gesticulates, Nævia alone is in his thoughts:
if there were no Naevia, he would be mute.
When he had written a dutiful letter yesterday to his father, he ended it with, "Naevia, light of my eyes, Nævia, my idol, farewell."
Nævia read these words, and laughed with downcast looks.
Nævia is not yours only:
2 what madness is this, foolish man ?
Let Rufus weep, rejoice, stand, sit, or walk, Still he can nothing but of Nævia talk:
Let him eat, drink, ask questions, or dispute, Still he must speak of Nævia, or be mute.
He writ to his father, ending with this line, I am, my lovely Nævia, ever thine.

ElphinstonGo, my book, and pay my respects for me :
you are ordered to go, dutiful volume, to the splendid halls of Proculus.
Do you ask the way ?
I will tell you.
You will go along by the temple of Castor, near that of ancient Vesta, and that goddess's virgin home.
Thence you will pass to the majes­ tic Palatine edifice on the sacred hill, where glitters many a statue of the supreme ruler of the empire.
And let not the ray-adorned mass of the Colossus detain you, a work which is proud of surpassing that of Rhodes.
But turn aside by the way where the temple of the wine-bibbing Bacchus rises, and where the couch of Cybele stands adorned with pictures of the Corybantes.
Immediately on the left is the dwelling with its splendid facade, and the halls of the lofty mansion which you are to approach.
Enter it;
and fear not its haughty looks or proud gate;
no entrance affords more ready access;
nor is there any house more inviting for Phoebus and the learned sisters to love.
If Proculus shall say, " But why does he not come himself ?
" you may excuse me thus, “ Because he could not have written what is to be read here, whatever be its merit, if he had come to pay his respects in person.
"Go, little book, the breathings of thy lord 'Fore Proculus's splendid gods record.
Which is my way ?
By Castor shalt thou roam Near hoary Vesta's fane and virgin-dome.
Thence by the awful hill ascends thy tour:
The sov'reign's image beams direction pure.
Nor thee too long the famed Coloss beguile, That dims the radiance of the Rhodian pile.
Hence seek the soaking father of the feast, The mighty mother, and her painted priest.
Now, on the left, the lofty towers invite :
The courts august possess the ravish'd sight.
Yet, bold approach ;
thou canst redoubt no pride :
No welcome portals stand more sweetly wide.
None eyes Apollo, or the Nine more near.
The poet, why, he ’ll say, himself not here ?
Then thou:
Because, whatever these indite, The personal saluter could not write.

Do you imagine, Fidentinus, that you are a poet by the aid of my verses, and do you wish to be thought so ?
Just so does Ægle think she has teeth from having purchased bone or ivory.

You too, in the same way that you are a poet, will have flowing locks when you are grown bald.

What do you expect from Phœbus ?
The chest of Minerva contains the cash;
she alone is wise, she alone lends to all the gods.
What can the ivy of Bacchus give ?
The dark tree of Pallas bends down its variegated boughs under the load of fruit.
Helicon, besides its waters and the garlands and lyres of the goddesses, and the great but empty applause of the multitude, has nothing.
What hast thou to do with Cirrha ?
What with bare Permessis ?
The Roman forum is nearer and more lucrative.
There is heard the chink of money;
but around our desks and barren chairs kisses 3 alone resound.
Though midst the noblest poets thou hast place, Flaccus, the offspring of Antenor's race ;
Renounce the Muses' songs and charming quire, For none of them enrich, though they inspire.
Court not Apollo, Pallas has the gold ;
She 's wise, and does the gods in mortgage hold.
What profit is there in an ivy wreath ?
Its fruits the loaden olive sinks beneath.
In Helicon there's nought but springs and bays, The Muses' harps loud sounding empty praise.
What with Parnassus' streams hast thou to do P The Roman forum 's rich, and nearer too.
There chinks the cash :
but round the poet's chair
The smacks of kisses only fill the air.

When a devouring malady attacked his unoffending throat, and its black poison extended its ravages over his face, Festus, consoling his weeping friends, while his own eyes were dry, determined to seek the Stygian lake.
He did not however pollute his pious mouth with secret poison, or aggravate his sadfate by lingering famine, but ended his pure life by a death befitting a Roman, and freed his spirit in a nobler way.
This death fame may place above that of the great Cato;
for Domitian was Festus' friend.
2
When the dire quinsey choked his noble breath, And o'er his face the black'ning venom stole, Festus disdain'd to wait a ling'ring death, Cheer'd his sad friends, and freed his dauntless soul.
Nor meagre famine's slowly-wasting force, Nor hemlock's gradual chillness he endured;
But closed his life a truly Roman course, And with one blow his liberty secured.

See from what mischief this portico, which, overthrown amid clouds of dust, stretches its long ruins over the ground, lies absolved.
For Regulus had but just been carried in his litter under its arch, and had got out of the way, when forthwith, borne down by its own weight, it fell;
and, being no longer in fear for its master, it came down free from bloodguiltiness, a harmless ruin, without any attendant anxiety.
After the fear of so great a cause for complaint is passed, who would deny, Regulus, that you, for whose sake the fall was innoxious, are an object of care to the gods ?
The portico, that, mould'ring here, Her melancholy wreck extends:
From what a mighty mischief clear, A wise and willing witness lends.
Hardly had Regulus rode by, When, trembling with unwieldy weight, No passenger before her eye, She rush'd upon a bloodless fate.

Nay, I 'm so happy, most men think,
To live so near a man of chink, That they are apt to envy me, For keeping such good company:
But he 's as far from me, I vow, As London is from good Lord Howe$ For when old Hunks I chance to meet, Or one or both must quit the street.
Thus he who would not see old Roger, Must be his neighbour-or his lodger.
Swift.
Sir FormaTs house adjoining stands :
We from our windows may shake hands.
Blest situation!
you will say.
Do not you envy me, I pray, Who may, at early hours and late, Enjoy a friend so intimate ?
Sir t ormal is to me as near
As is the Consul at Algier.
So far from intimacy is it, We seldom speak, we never visit.
In the whole town no soul can be So near, and yet so far from me.
”Tis time for him or me to start;
We cannot meet, unless we part.
Would you Sir Formal keep aloof?
Take lodgings under the same roof.

That you may not be disagreeably fragrant with your yes­ terday's wine, you devour, luxurious Fescennia, certain of Cosmus's 1 perfumes.
Breakfasts of such a nature leave their mark on the teeth, but form no barrier against the emanations which escape from the depths of the stomach.
Nay, the fetid smell is but the worse when mixed with perfume, and the double odour of the breath is carried but the further.
Cease then to use frauds but too well known, and disguises well understood ;
and simply intoxicate yourself.
Each morne rich lozenges thou eat'st, the stinke, Fescennia, to hide o' th' last night's drinke :
Such breakfasts smear thy chapps;
but all in value, When those sowre fumes thou must belch up againe.
Nay, mixt with those perfumes the stinke is worse, And further goes with this redoubled force:
The cheat-, discovered now, and too well knowne, Lay by;
and henceforth smell of drinke alone.
Old MS. 17th Cent.Alcimus, whom, snatched from thy lord in thy opening years, the Labican earth covers with light turf, receive, not a nodding mass of Parian marble,-an unenduring monument which misapplied toil gives to the dead,-but shapely box­ trees and the dark shades of the palm leaf, and dewy flowers of the mead which bloom from being watered with my tears.
Receive, dear youth, the memorials of my grief:
this tribute will live for thee in all time.
When Lachesis shall have spun to the end of my last hour, I shall ask no other honours for my ashes.
Snatched from thy lord in thy youth's verdant bloome, Whose earth nought but earth-turfes gently entombe :
Accept no vague vast marble piles, which must Instead of keeping thine, themselves bee dust:
Butt this fraile boxe and palme-trees' gloomy shade, And greene sodds, with my dewy teares so made :
Accept, deare boy, these griefs pour'd on thy hearse, Thus shall thy name live ever in my verse.
When Fates my life's last thredd shall cutt in twaine, May I no other grave, than such, obtayne.
Old MS. 17th CentSweet innocent, whom wishes could not save, Light be the turf that rests upon thy grave !
No Parian marble thine, whose pomp might prove
The sculptor’s labour, not the parent's love.
The humble box, and festil vine thy bier, Thy home the mead, thy monument a tear.
O early lost, accept my votive lay, The last fond tribute which the Muse can pay:
And when too ling'ring age has closed my doom, My heart's asylum be-a daughter's tomb.
E. B. Greene, 1774.
Dear boy!
whom, torn in early youth away, The light turf covers in Labicum's way, Receive no tomb hewn from the Parian cave By useless toil to moulder o'er the grave;
But box and shady palms shall flourish here, And softest herbage green with many a tear.
Dear boy!
these records of my grief receive, These simple honours that will bloom and live;
And be, when Fate has spun my latest line, My ashes honoured, as I honour thine!

You always whisper into every one's ear, Cinna;
you whisper even what might be said in the hearing of the whole world.
You laugh, you complain, you dispute, you weep, you sing, you criticise, you are silent, you are noisy;
and all in one's ear.
Has this disease so thoroughly taken posses­ lion of you, that you often praise Cæsar, Cinna, in the ear?
1Cinna, thou 'rt ever whispering in the ear, And whispering that which all the world may hear.
Thou laugh’st i' th' ear, weep'st, quarrel’st, dost dispute ;
Thou sigh'st i' th’ ear, dost hollow, and art mute :
So far thou 'rt gone in this disease, I swear, Thou praisest Cæsar often in the ear.
Anon. 1695.
Your powder'd nose you thrust in every ear, And whisper that which all the world may hear:
In whispers smile, or wear a dismal face:
In whispers state, or else lament, the case:
Now hum a tune, judicious now appear;
Now hold your tongue, now hollow in the ear.
Is this a secret too ?
Your accent raise:
We love the king, whom you in whispers praise.

Inasmuch as I never saw you, Bassa, surrounded by a crowd of admirers, and report in no case assigned to you a favoured lover;
but every duty about your person was con­ stantly performed by a crowd of your own sex, without the presence of even one man;
you seemed to me, I confess it, to be a Lucretia.
That I ne'er saw thee in a coach with man, Nor thy chaste name in wanton satire met;
That from thy sex thy liking never ran,
So as to suffer a male servant yet:
I thought thee the Lucretia of our time:
But, Bassa, thou the while a Tribas wert, And clashing-with a prodigious crime Didst act of man th' inimitable part.
What Œdipus this riddle can untie P Without a male there was adultery.

You do not publish your own verses, Lælius;

But if you have neither fire, nor legs for your bare bedstead, nor broken basin of Chione or Antiope;
3 if a cloak greasy and worn hangs down your back, and a Gallic jacket covers only half of your loins;
and if you feed on the smell alone of the dark kitchen, and drink on your knees dirty water with the dog;
Here reposes Aquinus, reunited to his faithful Fabricius, who rejoices in having preceded him to the Elysian retreats.
This double altar bears record that each was honoured with the rank of chief centurion;
but that praise is of still greater worth which you read in this shorter inscription:
Both were united in the sacred bond of a well-spent life, and, what is rarely known to fame, were friends.
Here with Aquinus is Fabricius laid.
Rejoiced to find him in the realms of shade.
Graved on this tomb is either soldier's name, Alike their friendship, and alike their fame.

In constantly making a clamour, and obstructing the pleaders with your noise, Ælius, you act not without an object;

If it is not disagreeable, and does not annoy you, my verse, say, I prithee, a word or two in the ear of our friend Mater­ nus, so that he alone may hear.
That admirer of sad-colour­ ed coats, clad in the costume of the banks of the river Bætis, and in grey garments, who deems the wearers of scarlet not men, and calls amethyst-coloured robes the dress of wo­ men, however much he may praise natural hues, and be al­ ways seen in dark colours, has at the same time morals of an extremely flagrant hue.
2
You will ask whence I suspect him of effeminacy.
We go to the same baths ;
3
Do you ask me who this is ?
His name has escaped me.
My darling muse, if't is no troublous task, Or painful toil, let me one favour ask.
Go, drop these few in our Maternus' ear But so that he, and only he, shall hear.
Yon sallow lover of the sad array, Whom Bætis ever clothes, or motley grey Who none, in scarlet, can esteem as men;
Who all, empurpled, would with females pen;
Who hugs the native hue, detests all dye, Unless, perhaps, what saves from glare the eye:
Though offuscation overcast his whole, Galbanian manners tinge his inmost soul.
Inquiry, of the WHO, my course has stopped.
Inquirer, pardon:
I the name have dropped, Elphinston.
When every one is talking, then and then only, Nævolus, do you open your mouth ;
and you think yourself an advocate and a pleader.
In such a way every one may be eloquent.
But see, everybody is silent;
say something now, Nævolus.
Still in a crowd of noise thy voice is heard,
And think'st thyself a lawyer for thy prattle;
in this account each man that wears a beard May be as wise.
Lo, all men peace!

Diodorus goes to law, Flaccus, and has the gout in his feet.
But he pays his counsel nothing;
surely he has the gout also in his hands.
Thou 'st gouty feet, yet stoutly dost withstand
At law, and pay'st no fees the court demand :
Is not the gout, Diodore, in thy hand ?
Anon. 1696.
But a short time since, Calenus, you had not quite two millions of sesterces;
but you were so prodigal and open­ handed, and hospitable, that all your friends wished you ten millions.
Heaven heard the wish and our prayers;
and within, I think, six months, four deaths gave you the de­ sired fortune.
But you, as if ten millions had not been left to you, but taken from you, condemned yourself to such absti­ nence, wretched man, that you prepare even your most sump­ tuous feasts, which you provide only once in the whole year, at the cost of but a few dirty pieces of black coin;
and we, seven of your old companions, stand you in just half a pound of leaden money.
What blessing are we to invoke upon you worthy of such merits ?
We wish you, Calenus, a fortune of a hundred millions.
If this falls to your lot, you will die of hunger.
When some time since you had not clear Above three hundred pounds a year, You lived so well, your bounty such, Your friends all wish'd you twice as much:
Heaven with our wishes soon complied;
In six months four relations died.
But you, so far from having more, Seem robb'd of what you had before:
A greater miser every day, Live in a cursed starving way:
Scarce entertain us once a year;
And then not worth a groat the cheer:
Seven old companions, men of sense, Scarce cost you now as many pence.
What shall we wish you on our part?
What wish can equal your desert?
Thousands a year may heaven grant!
Then you will starve, and die for want!
Hay.
Possess'd of scarce three hundred clear, How blithely roll'd the liberal year!
So kind thy hand, thy heart so free, ’T was almost prodigality:
Each friend made happy wish'd thee more, Thy worth increasing with thy store.
Heav'n has indulged the grateful call:
Seven moons revolved, profusely fall
The showers of wealth, the kindred breath Four darts unerring closed in death.
While thou, as not a mite were left, As of toy little all bereft, Where Joy should smile bidst Avarice frown.
Dimm'd every gem in Plenty's crown!
In annual pomps we coldly greet One solitary sumptuous treat, The treat to glut thy sordid pride Cheaply from basest coin supply'd
To seven choice friends;
your choicest food As your light guineas light and good.
What prayers shall now engage the friend ?
Prayers for thy riches without end :
That meagre Famine death will give To him whose meanness does not live.
E. B. Greene, 1774.

Demetrius, whose hand was once the faithful confidant of my verses, so useful to his master, and so well known to the Cæsars, has yielded up his brief life in its early prime.
A fourth harvest had been added to his years, which previously numbered fifteen.
That he might not, however, descend to the Stygian shades as a slave, 1, when the accursed disease had seized and was withering him, took precaution, and re­ mitted to the sick youth all my right over him as his master;
he was worthy of restoration to health through my gift.
1
He appreciated, with failing faculties, the kindness which he had received;
and on the point of departing, a free man, to the Tartarean waters, saluted me as his patron.
That hand, to all my labours once so true, Which I so loved, and which the Cæsars knew;
Forsook the dear Demetrius' blooming prime:
Three lustres and four harvests all his time.
That not to Styx a slave he should descend, When fell contagion urged him to his end;
We cheer’d, with all our rights, the pining boy.
Oh!
that the convalescent could enjoy.
He tasted his reward, his patron bless’d, And went a free man to eternal rest.

"If the gods were to give me a fortune of a million ses­ terces," you used to say, Scævola, before you were a full knight,1 "oh how would I live!
how magnificently, how happily!
The complaisant deities smiled and granted your wish.
Since that time your toga has become much more dirty, your cloak worse;
your shoe has been sewn up three and four times;
of ten olives the greater portion is always put by, and one spread of the table serves for two meals;
the thick dregs of pink Vejentan wine are your drink ;
a plate of lukewarm peas costs you a penny;
your mistress a penny likewise.
Cheat and liar, let us go before the tribunal of the gods;
and either live, Scævola, as befits you, or restore to the gods your million sesterces.
Thou saidst when yet thou hadst not a knight's fee, “If Heaven would grant four thousand pounds to me, Oh!
in what ease, what splendour, I would live! ”
The easy gods smiled, and the sum did give.
But then thy gown was sordid;
cloak, thread-bare;
Shoes thrice and four times clouted thou didst wear.
Of poor ten olives, some were still set up;
On the same meat thou usest twice to sup;
Lees of wine served, that at Veientus grew, A pen'orth o' peas, a penny mistress too.
We '11 sue the cheat:
live better, or refund Unto the gods thou 'st mock'd four thousand pound.
Anon. 1695.
When we see the leopard bear upon his spotted neck a light and easy yoke, and the furious tigers endure with pa­ tience the blows of the whip;
the stags champ the golden curbs;
the Libyan bears tamed by the bit;
a boar, huge as that which Calydon is said to have produced, obey the purple muzzle;
the ugly buffaloes drag chariots, and the elephant, when ordered to dance nimbly, pay prompt obedience to his swarthy leader;
who would not imagine such things a spec- tacle given by the gods ?
These, however, any one disre­ gards as of inferior attraction who sees the condescension of the lions, which the swift-footed timorous hares fatigue in the chase.
They let go the little animals, catch them again, and caress them when caught, and the latter are safer in their captors' mouths than elsewhere;
since the lions delight in granting them free passage through their open jaws, and in holding their teeth as with fear, for they are ashamed to crush the tender prey, after having just come from slaying bulls.
This clemency does not proceed from art;
the lions know whom they serve.
On painted neck the pard sustains
The tender yoke, and loves the reins.
The furious tiger knows the crack, And timely takes the keenest smack.
The staggard champs the golden bit .
The Libyan bears to chains submit.
A beast, like Calydon's of yore.
Boasts headbands never bristler wore.
The shapeless burner draws the wain:
The monster moves beneath the chain
Of his black ruler, and obeys, As bid to earn the prancer's praise.
Worthy the gaze of gods are all:
Yet mortals will pronounce them small, When they the humble hunts admire
Of lions, whom the leverets tire.
Behold them seized, and now let go ;
Now see them swallow'd by the foe.
Yet safer in the mouth the prey, Than when it farthest flies away
The fondling jaws all pervious hang.
How dextrous is the timid fang!
To hurt a hare, they grin with shame, Who late the stoutest steers overcame.
Art ne'er produced the pitying play :
They know what master they obey.

The wine, Ovidius, which is grown in the Nomentan fields, in proportion as it receives the addition of years, puts off, through age, its character and name;
and the jar thus ancient receives whatever name you pleased
The pure, my Ovid, from Nomentan vinos, If all-improving age's smile she boast;
Her nature and her name at once resigns, For th' appellation that endears her most.

Rufus, you often pour water into your wine, and, if bard pressed by your companion, you drink just a cup now and then of diluted Falernian.
Pray, is it that Nævia has pro­ mised you a night of bliss;
and you prefer by sobriety to enhance your enjoyment?
You sigh, you are silent, you groan:
she has refused you.
You may drink, then, and often, cups of four-fold size, and drown in wine your concern at her cruelty.
Why do you spare yourself, Rufus ?
You have nothing before you but to sleep.
Rufus, I must plainly deal, Since you will your water steal;
And, though prompted by a friend, Scarce a drop of wine will blend ;
Naughty Nævia, in her spite, Promised you a pleasing night:
And you sober will prefer Jocund certainty with her.
Lo !
you sigh, look wise, and groan :
She denies?
my Rufus, own.
Therefore drink your sorrow down,
And your shame in goblets drown.
Neither wise it now, nor weep :
Hapless Rufus, you must sleep.

You often say to me, dearest Lucius Julius, “Write some­ thing great:
you take your ease too much."
Give me then leisure,- but leisure such as that which of old Mæcenas gave to his Horace and his Virgil,—and I would endeavour to write something which should live through time, and to snatch my name from the flames of the funeral pyre.
Steers are un willing to carry their yoke into barren fields.
A fat soil fa tigues, but the very labour bestowed on it is delightful.
“Write some brave piece ;
thou 'rt lazy!" often thus
Thou dost reprove me, dearest Julius.
Give mee but ease such as Micenas gave To Horace and to Virgill, thou shalt have Such lines as shall live to eternity, And rayse my name above mortality.
In barren grounds what bootes the oxen's toyle ?
Labour ’s rewarded in the richer soyle.
Old iS.

Most famous Julius, thou sayst oft to me, “Thou 'rt idle ;
write things for eternity."
Give me such boons, I cre, such as of old Horace and Virgil from their patron hold, I ’ll strive to raise my cares beyond time's date, And snatch my name from fire's consuming hate.
The ox on barren fields his yoke won't bear ;
A fat soil tires, but yet the labour’s dear.

You possess—and may it be yours and grow larger through a long series of years—a house, beautiful I admit, but on the other side of the Tiber.
But my garret looks upon the laurels of Agrippa;
and in this quarter I am already grown old.
I must move, in order to pay you a morning call, Gallus, and you deserve this consideration, even if your house were still farther off.
But it is a small matter to you, Gallus, if I add one to the number of your toga-clad visitors;
while it is a great matter to me, if I withhold that one.
I myself will frequently pay my respects to you at the tenth hour.'
This morning my book shall wish you " good day " in my stead.
May thy fair farm (though beyond Tiber's site), As it does now, thee more and more delight!
My rooms Vipsanian laurels do behold, In the which region I am now grown old:
A journey 't is, to give thee the good morn, But such thou art, though farther, to be borne.
One gown-man more, yet were not much to thee, Though to detain this one is much to me.
My book shall th' early ave for me pay, And I ’ll attend when ended is the day.
Anon, 1695.
Issa is more playful than the sparrow of Catullus.
Issa is more pure than the kiss of a dove.
Issa is more loving than any maiden.
Issa is dearer than Indian gems.
The little dog Issa is the pet of Publius.
If she complains, you will think she speaks.
She feels both the sorrow and the gladness of her master.
She lies reclined upon his neck, and sleeps, so that not a respiration is heard from her.
And, however pressed, she has never sullied the coverlet with a single spot;
but rouses her master with a gentle touch of her foot, and begs to be set down from the bed and relieved.
Such modesty resides in this chaste little animal;
she knows not the pleasures of love ;
nor do we find a mate worthy of so tender a damsel.
That her last hour may not carry her off wholly, Publius has her limned in a picture, in which you will see an Issa so like, that not even herself is so like herself.
In a word, place Issa and the picture side by side, and you will imagine either both real, or both painted.
Issa 's more full of sport and wanton play
Than that pet sparrow by Catullus sung;
Issa 's more pure and cleanly in her way Than kisses from the amorous turtle's tongue.
Issa more winsome is than any girl
That ever yet entranced a lover's sight;
Issa 's more precious than the Indian pearl;
Issa 's my Publius' favourite and delight.
Her plaintive voice falls sad as one that weeps;
Her masters cares and woes alike she shares;
Softly reclined upon his neck she sleeps, And scarce to sigh or draw her breath she dares.
When nature calls, she modestly obeys, Nor on the counterpane one drop will shed ;
But warns her lord with gentle foot, and prays
That he will raise and lift her from the bed.
So chaste is she, of contact so afraid, She knows not Venus' rites, nor do we find A husband worthy of such dainty maid 'Mong all the clamorous suitors of her kind.
Her, lest day of fate should nothing leave, In pictured form my Publius hath portray'd;
Where you to lifelike Issa might perceive, That not herself a better likeness made.
Issa together with her portrait lay, Both real or both depicted you would say.

Since your reputation for wisdom, and the care which you bestow on your labours, are equal, and since your piety is not inferior to your genius, he who is surprised that a book and incense are presented to you, Regulus, is ignorant how to adapt presents to deserts.

When I did not know you, I used to address you as my lord and king.

If, reader, you wish to employ some good hours badly, and are an enemy to your own leisure, you will obtain whatever sportive verses I produced in my youth and boyhood, and all my trifles, which even I myself have forgotten, from Quin- tus Pollius Valerianus, who has resolved not to let mv light effusions perish.
Reader of my roguish lay, Would'st thou con a stripling-play, Which a friend will never show, Which myself could hardly know ?
Would'st thou waste a golden hour, And abuse thy precious power ?
Thou to Pollius must apply, Who forbids my trash to die.

These gardens adjoining your domain, Faustinus, and these small fields and moist meadows, Telesphorus Fænius owns.
Here he has deposited the ashes of his daughter, and has consecrated the name, which you read, of Antulla;
—though his own name should rather have been read there.
It had been more just that the father should have gone to the Stygian shades;
but, since this was not permitted, may he live to honour his daughter's remains.
Next, Faustin, thine, confess a Fænius’ sway;
Whom modest lawns and oozy meads obey.
Here his Antulla's urn receives his moan :
Her name he hallow'd, mourning not his own.
The sire, as just, had woo'd the Stygian shade;
But sad survives, to see her honours paid.

A certain damsel, envious Procillus, is desperately in love with me,—a nymph more white than the spotless swan, than silver, than snow, than lily, than privet:
already you will be thinking of hanging yourself.
But I long for one darker than night, than the ant, than pitch, than the jack-daw, than the cricket.
If I know you well, Procillus, you will spare your life.
1
Me a damsel dotes upon, Fairer than the fairest swan ;
Silver, snow ;
than lily, privet;
Or what else the soul can rivet.
One I love as black as night, ack-daw, pitch, ant, cricket, sprite.
Poor Procillus thought to swing :
Now he thinks of no such thing.
Elphinston.
This grove, and these fair acres of cultivated land, Fænius has consecrated to the eternal honour of the dead.
In this tomb is deposited Antulla, too soon snatched from her family :
in this tomb each of her parents will be united to her.
If any one desires this piece of ground, I warn him not to hope for it;
it is for ever devoted to its owners.
Whenever you meet me, Lupercus, you constantly say, “ Shall I send my servant, for you to give him your little book of Epigrams, which I will read and return to you di­ rectly ? "
There is no reason, Lupercus, to trouble your ser­ vant.
It is a long journey, if he wishes to come to the Pirus ;
1 and I live up three pairs of stairs, and those high ones.
What you want you may procure nearer at hand.
You frequently go down to the Argiletum :
opposite Caesaris fo­ rum is a shop, with pillars on each side covered over with titles of books, so that you may quickly run over the names of all the poets.
Procure me there;
you will no sooner ask Atrectus,—such is the name of the owner of the shop,-than he will give you, from the first or second shelf, a Martial, well smoothed with pumice-stone, and adorned with purple, for five denarii.
“You are not worth so much," do you say ?
You are right, Lupercus.
As oft, Sir Tradewell, as we meet, You 're sure to ask me in the street, When you shall send your boy to me, To fetch my book of poetry ;
And promise you '11 but read it o'er, And faithfully the loan restore :
But let me tell you as a friend, You need not take the pains to send:
'T is a long way to where I dwell, At farther end of Clerkenwell:
There in a garret near the sky, Above five pair of stairs, I lie.
But if you d have what you pretend, You may procure it nearer hand:
An Cornhill, where you often go, Hard by th' Exchange, there is, you know, A shop of rhyme, where you may see
The posts all clad in poetry:
There Hlives of high renown, The noted'st Tory in the town:
Where, if you please, inquire for me;
And he, or’s prentice, presently From the next shelf will reach you down
The piece well bound for half a crown.
The price is much too dear, you cry, To give for both the book and me :
Yes, doubtless, for such vanities;
We know, air, you are too, too wise.

For him who is not satisfied with reading a hundred epi­ grams, no amount of trouble is sufficient, Cædicianus.
He who a hundred epigrams reads o'er, No ill ’s enough for him, if he wants more.

WHAT do I want," say you, " with a letter P Do I not snow you sufficient indulgence by reading your epigrams ?
Besides, what have you to say in this letter, which you could not say in your verses ?
I see why tragic and comic writers admit a prologue,-because they are not allowed to speak for themselves.
But epigrams have no need of a herald, and are contented with their own liberty of speech.
In whatever page they please, they present an epistle.
Do not, therefore, I pray, do a ridiculous thing, and clap a long dress on a person going to dance.'
Consider, too, whether you would choose a wand as a weapon against a retiarius.
2
For myself, I take my seat amongst those who at once object to a contest so un­ equal."
Indeed, Decianus, methinks you say what is just.
Is it possible that you knew with what sort of an epistle, and how long a one, you were in danger of being occupied ?
Be it, then, as you desire.
Whatever readers light upon this book, will owe it to you that they come to the first page without being tired.
You could, I admit, have contained three hundred epi­ grams ;
but who, my book, would have contained himself at you, and read you through ?
Yet learn, what are the advantages of a short book.
The first is, that I waste less paper.
The next, that the copier finishes it in one hour, and his services will not be confined only to my trifles.
A third advantage is, that if any one happens to read you, you will not, though ever so bad, be detested.
A person at table will begin to read you with his wine mixed, and finish you before the cup set before him begins to grow warm.
1
Do you imagine that by such brevity you are secure from all objec­ tion ?
Alas!
to how many will you even thus be too long!
Three hundred epigrams thou might'st contain, But who, to read so many, can sustain ?
Hear what in praise of brevity is said.
First, less expense and waste of paper’s made;
The printer's labour, next, does sooner end, And to more serious works he may attend;
Thirdly, to whomsoe'er thou shalt be read, Though naught, not tedious yet thou canst be said;
Again, in length whilst thou dost not abound, Thou mayst be heard while yet the cups go round;
And when this caution’s used, alas !
I fear To many yet thou wilt too long apocar.
Anon. 1695.
Crete gave a great name, Africa a greater, to their con­ querors, Metellus and Scipio;
a still nobler name did Ger­ many confer on thee, Cæsar, from the subjugation of the Rhine;
and even as a boy thou wast worthy of that name.
Thy brother2 earned his triumphs over Idumæa, with the assistance of thy father ;
3 the laurel which is given from the conquest of the Catti is all thy own.
Great was the Libyan, great the Cretan fame, Adorning Scipio's and Metellus’ name ;
Laurels more glorious from the vanquish’d Rhine, In opening youth, round Cæsar’s temples twine.
His sire and brother laid Idume low, Jle triumph'd singly o'er the German foe.

You owe nothing, Sextus;
you owe nothing, Sextus, I admit;
for he only owes, Sextus, who can pay.
Sextus owes nought, nor fears his quarter-day;
’T is true;
he owes most truly that can pay.

You say, you nothing owe;
and so I say:
He only owes, who something hath to pay.

Oh, how caressing, Ammianus, are you with your mother!
how caressing, Ammianus, is your mother with you!
She calls you brother;
you call her sister.
Why do such strange titles of affection delight vou ?
Why are you not content to be what you are ?
Do you think this an amusement and a jest ?
It is not so.
A mother, who desires to be a sister, ia not satisfied with being either mother or sister.
To thy mother, ah!
how kind!
Parent, ah !
how kind to thee!
Brother thou, and sister she!
Why to novel names inclined ?
Than ye are, pray, why be other P Jest ye think it:
vile the shame!
Mother, wishing sister’s name, Would not sister be, nor mother.

May I perish, Decianus, if I should not like to be with you all day, and all night!
But there are two miles that separate us;
and these become four, when I have to return.
You are often not at home:
even when you are, you are oft­ en denied;
or you have leisure only for your law business or your private concerns.
To see you, however, I have no objection to go two miles ;
but I have great objection to go four miles not to see you.
With you, dear Tom, I 'd often spend the day, And laugh, and chat, and trifle life away ;
But ten long miles, you know, divide us twain ;
Those ten make twenty, measured back again.
Then, o'er the downs with patience should I come, You 're always out, at least you 're not at home;
Or busy, or engaged in rhyme and metre, Or with your child, that entertaining creature !
In short, to see my friend ten miles I 'd go;
But twenty not to see you '11 never do.
Rev. R GracosMay
I not live, but, were it in my power, With thee I ’d pass both day and night each hour.
Two miles I go to see you;
and two more
When I return;
and two and two make four.
Often denied;
often from home you 're gone:
Are busy oft;
and oft would be alone.
Two miles, to see you, give me no great pain:
Four, not to see you, go against the grain.
Hag.
In some vile hamlet let me live forgot, Small-beer my portion, and no wine my lot;
To some worse fiend in church indentures bound Than ancient Job or modern Sherlock found, And with more aches plagued, and pains, and ills, Than fill our Salmon's works or Tilburgh's bills;
If't is not still the burden of my prayer, The night with you, with you the day to share.
But, sir (and the complaint you know is true), Two damn'd long miles there lie 'twixt me and you ;
And these two miles, by help of calculation, Make four by that I 've reached my habitation.
You 're near sage Will's, the land of mirth and claret ;
I live stow'd up in a Whitechapel garret.
Oft when I ’ve walk'd so far, your hands to kiss, Flatter'd with thoughts of the succeeding bliss, I 'm told you 're gone to the vexatious Hall, Where with eternal lungs the lawyers bawl;
Or else stol'n out, some female friend to see;
Or, what's as bad, you 're not at home for me.
Two miles I ’ve at your service, and that 's civil;
But to trudge four, and miss you, is the devil.
Tom Browne,Go now, and bid me publish my little books.
When tou have scarcely read a couple of pages, you look at the last page, Severus, and give long yawns.
These are those epi­ grams which, when I was reciting them, you used to steal and write out in Vitellian tablets.
1
These are they which you used to carry one by one in your pockets to every feast, and every theatre.
These are they, or (if there are any among them that you do not know) better.
Of what use is it for me to make my book so thin, as not to be thicker than a mere roller,1 if it takes you three days to read it through ?
Never were compositions intended to amuse more listlessly received.
You are fatigued, and lag so soon in your course ;
and when you ought to run to Bovillæ, you want to unharness your cattle at the temple of the Muses.
Go now, and bid me publish my little books.
Bid me now bring forth my spawn, Scarce hast thou two pages past, When thou op'st a piteous yawn, Panting to behold the lastThese, Severus, are the strains, Thou didst swallow with delight, Treasure with unwearied pains, And on thy best tablets write.
Public scenes, and private too, Heard thee these same lays rehearse :
Or, if any here are new, Still superior is the verse.
What avails my tiny book, How can such a shrimp succeed;
If thou cast so rare a look, That it take three days to read ?
Soon the verdant journey cloys, Though so smooth extend the lawn :
Stop amid Pierian joys!
Then bid me bring forth my spawn!

You declaim prettily, Attalus;
you plead causes prettily:
you write pretty histories, pretty verses.
You compose pan­ tomimes prettily, epigrams prettily ;
you are a pretty gram­ marian, a pretty astrologer.
You sing prettily, Attalus, and you dance prettily:
you are a pretty band with the lyre, a pretty hand with the ball.
Since you do nothing well, and yet everything prettily, shall I tell you what you are ?
You are a great busybody.
A pretty oratour and pleeder, hee ;
Pretty in history and poetry;
Pretty grammarian, epigrammatist;
Pretty astrologer and humorist:
Hee singeth prettyly, and danceth so;
Playes prettyly o' the lute, at tennis too.
Hee that doth nothing well, all prettyly, A very idle-busy-man must bee.
Old MS. 16th Cens.
Yes, you 're a pretty preacher, Sir, we know it, Write pretty novels, are a pretty poet;
A pretty critic, and tell fortunes too ;
Then, who writes farce or epigrams like you ?
At every ball how prettily vou nick it!
You fiddle, sing, play prettily at cricket Yet, after all, in nothing you excel, Do all things prettily, but nothing well.
What shall I call you P pay the best I can, You are, my friend, a very busy man.
Rev. R. Graves.
Fine lectures Attalus rehearses, Pleads finely, writes fine tales and verses;
Fine epigrams, fine farces vie With grammar and astrology;
He finely sings, and dances finely:
Plays tennis:
fiddles most divinely All finely done, and nothing well:
Then, if a man the truth may tell, This all-accomplish’d Punchinello Is a most busy, idle fellow.

If in these pages of mine, reader, anything seem to you too obscure, or written in too homely language, the fault is not mine:
the copier did the mischief, in his over-anxiety to give you the full amount of verses.
But if you shall deem, not him, but me to be the culprit, then I shall believe you to have no understanding. "
But still those verses of yours are bad."
As if I would deny what is evident!
They are bad but you do not write better.
Reader, if in theise bookes aught aeeme to want, As too obscure or little elegant;
’T is nott my fault, the printer must bee blam’d, Who, too much hast’ning, at thy pleasure aym'd.
If still you thinkb 't my errour and nott his, I shall believe your breast not candid is.
They 'r badd, you ’ll say-well, that for granted take ;
Though theise be badd, you cannot better make.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
If in my leaves aught, reader, to thee seem Obscure, or which less Latin thou dost deem, To th’ printer these impute, not me ;
who, while More books he hastes to vend, cares not how vile.
If yet thou think'st not him, but me, to blame, Thou fear'st not want of candour to proclaim.
But still my verse for naught thou dost decry:
As if what s manifest I would deny.
Naught be they then:
but them for good ones take, Till thou dost show that thou canst better make.
Anon. 1696.

I commend you, Postumus, for kissing me with only half your lip:
you may, however, if you please, withhold even the half of this half.
Are you inclined to grant me a boon still greater, and even inexpressible ?
Keep this whole half en­ tirely to yourself, Postumus.
Th' embrace thou deign'st with half-lip to bestow, I praise, though thou should’st hence take half away.
Give me a nobler, nameless boon to owe, And take the whole of t' other half, I pray.

Though, Rufus, you see Selius with clouded brow;
though you see him walking late in the porticoes;
though you see his heavy look conceal some mournful feeling, his ugly nose nearly touching the earth, his right hand striking his breast, and tearing his hair, he is not bewailing the loss of a friend or brother.
Both his sons are alive,-and I pray they may continue to live!
Safe and sound is his wife too, and his furniture, and his slaves;
nor has his farmer or his bailiff wasted any part of his property.
What then is the cause of his sadness P
He dines at home.
Whence comes it, that old Frank we see Hunting the Mall, thus, after three ?
What means that slow and Rolemn pace P That cloudy look, and rueful face ?
Why starts he thus, and smites his breast, Like one with secret grief oppressed ?
Prone to the earth his drooping head!
Why sure his wife or child is dead.
No, Sir;
for aught that I can tell, Frank's wife and children all are well.
And heaven vouchsafe their lives to spare!
For lovely boys and girls they are, As like old Frank as they can stare.
His money's out in proper hands,
Or well secured on mortgaged lands.
Nor loss of interest or of rent
By bankruptcies does Frank lament.
Whence is this grief, then ?
pry thee say.
Why, Sir, Frank dines at home to-day.
Rev. R. GiseSee lou the cloud on yonder mortal's face Walking the Mall, the last who quits the place :
In tragic silence, and in dumps profound, His nose almost draws furrows on the ground:
His wig he twitches, and he canes the air.
Is he for friend or brother in despair ?
'T is no such thing.
Two sons with him do dwell :
They both are promising, they both are well:
So his good wife, for whom we all do pray.
Safe are his bags ;
nor servants run away:
Duly accounts his steward for his rent;
And by his bailiff's care his crops augment.
Say, from what cause can such affliction come ?
Is there not cause ?
ye gods!
he sups at home.
Hay.
What am I to understand from the circumstance, that your kisses always smell of myrrh, and that you never have about you an odour other than unnatural ?
That you always smell so agreeably, Postumus, makes me suspect that you have something to conceal.
He does not smell pleasantly, Postumus, who always smells pleasantly.
'What's this that myrrh doth still smell in thy kiss, And that with thee no other odour is ?
T is doubt, my Postumus, he that doth smell
So sweetly always, smells not very well.
Fletcher.
How strong thou savour'st myrrh's perfume!
What foreign odours round thee scent!
They give us shrewdly to presume, That they are not for nothing lent.
Elphinston.
That thou dost, Casho, breathe of foreign gums, Enough to put thy mistress into fits:
Though Rome thy hair, and Spain thy gloves perfume, Few like, but all suspect those borrowed sweets;
The gifts of various nature come and go, He that smelis always well does never so.

Nothing does Selius leave untried, nothing unattempted, whenever he sees that he must dine at home.
He runs to the portico of Europa, and praises you, Paulinus, and your Achillean swiftness of foot, without ceasing.
If Europa does nothing for him, he then goes to the enclosures, to see whether he can gain anything from the sons of Phillyra and Æson.
1
Disappointed here likewise, he next haunts the Memphitic temple of Isis,2 and seats himself near the seats of that sad heifer.
From this place he goes to the palace suspended upon a hundred columns ;
3 thence to the monument of Pom­ peius' magnificence.
and his double grove.
Nor does he disdain the baths of Fortunatus, or those of Faustus, or the confined and dark ones of Gryllus, or the windy ones of Lupus.
As to the warm baths, he bathes in them again and again and again.
After doing everything, but without the favour of heaven, he runs back, well washed, to the box­ grove of the warm Europa, in case some belated friend may be taking his way there.
By thyself, amorous Bull, and by thy mistress, whom thou carriedst off, do thou, I implore, in­ vite Selius to dinner.
6
Nothing does Selius unattempted leave, When he's to sup at home he doth conceive.
He toots to th’ Race, where, Paulus, he will swear Thy feet are swifter than Achilles' were.
Nothing here got, the Place of Votes he tries, If aught will come from the Æsonides.
Where failing too, to th' Memphian temple next, Near the sad Heifer, calfa-head sits perplexed.
Thence runs to th' Porch a hundred props sustain, To Pompey'a Arch and Groves, nor does disdain The vulgar baths, which Gryllus, Lupus, keep, One on the hill, the othei low and deep.
Where having bathed in all, and all in vain, No pitying god fav’ring his glutt'nous pain, Back to the Race he flies, to see if there Some friend be yet taking the evening air.
Th’ adjoining Porch, of various paintings full, Shows fair Europa borne upon a bull.
Jove, I adjure thee by the virgin bright, Make forlorn Selius thy own guest this night!
Anon. 1695.
In offering to no one the cup from which you drink, you give a proof, Hormus, not of pride, but of kindness.

Zoilus is in:
his gorgeous bed is the cause of this fever.
If he were well, of what use would be these scarlet coverlets, this bed brought from the banks of the Nile, or this, steeped in the perfumes of Sidon ?
What but an illness displays such idle wealth ?
What have you to do with physicians ?
Dismiss all your Machaons.
If you wish to get well, use my bed­ clothes.
Zoilus is sick;
his rich stuff makes him so :
If he were well, what should his scarlets do ?
His bed from Nile ?
his hangings dyed at Tyre ?
He’s sick, we may his sottish wealth admire.
Dismiss the doctors, the Machaons all, To make him well, for my rug only call.
Anon. 1695
Vainlove is ill:
his illness is his bed, Made up of chintz and silks prohibited:
Near it an Indian screen, and work'd settee, Inflame his fever to a high degree.
When he is well, these fopperies are not seen:
They make him sick, and give us too the spleen.
Dismiss his doctors, and apply my spell;
Let him change beds with me, and he '11 be well.
HegAt the very entrance of the Suburra, where bang the blood- stained whips of the torturers,1 and where many a cobbler blocks up the Argiletum,2 sits a female hair-cutter.

"Does not cut hair?" you say.
"What does she then ?” She shaves.

Where many a cordwainer once more Dares honest Argus' death deplore ;

I am ashamed of doing so, but, Maximus, I court your dinner:

Happy by an invitation to dinner, Zoilus, and that dinner yours ?
That guest deserves to be a guest at the Aricine Hill,1 who is made happy, Zoius, by a dinner of yours.

Supremely blest, great Zoilus, by thine!
On the Arician cliff he must recline, Whose ostrich-maw thy supper can digest.

To some, Postumus, you give kisses, to some your right hand.

If harsh Fortune should overwhelm you with some terrible accusation, I will attend you in mourning habit, and more pale than a person accused.

Candidus, will you give me anything?
You will, then, share with me in misfortune only:
but if heaven with smiling countenance shows you favour, you will enjoy your happiness, Candidus, alone.
If thy cross fortune sends thee some sad fate, I must persist thy pale and squalid mate ;
If from thy country thou must banished be, Through seas and rocks I still must follow thee.
If riches come, will they be free to many ?

Because Nævia breathes painfully, and has a severe cough, and often sputters out saliva on your breast, do you imagine, Bithynicus, that your fortune is already made?

Rufus, do you see yon person who is always sitting on the front benches, whose sardonyxed hand glistens even at this distance;
whose cloak has so often drunk deep of the Tyrian dye, and whose toga is made to surpass unspotted snow ;
him, whose well-oiled hair smells of all the essences from Marcellus’ shop, and whose arms look sleek and polished, with not a hair unextracted ?
A latchet of later than yesterday's make sits upon his crescent-adorned leg, a scarlet shoe decks his foot unhurt by its pressure, and numerous patches cover his forehead like stars.
Are you ignorant what the thing is ?
Remove the patches, and you will read his name.
1Seest thou him, Rufus, that does so frequent
The nobles' seat ?
from whose bright gems are sent Rays to this place,—in twice dipp'd purple goes, Or garments whiter than the driven snows:
Costly amomum from whose locks does flow, Whose sleek, blanch'd arms no hair upon them show ?
The lunar-buckles were not his of old, Nor sandals pinch'd his feet, garnish’d with gold.
No secret pains his numerous patches need;
Look underneath, and him a slave you ’ll read.

It is idle, believe me, to hope for service from a friend who is himself in service.

In your love for Phileros, whom you have redeemed from slavery with your whole dower, you allow your three sons, Galla, to perish with hunger:

With your whole dower when Phileros you buy, You let three hopeful sons with hunger die.

I would not have you curl your hair, nor yet would I have you throw it into disorder.
Your skin I would have neither over-sleek nor neglected.
Your beard should be neither that of an effeminate Asiatic, nor that of an accused person.!

Me nor with frizzly shock, nor frowsy hair;
Thy skin nor sleeky shine, nor sordid scare.
Thy beard nor girlish, nor as culprit's such ;
Be not a man too little, or too much.
Pile clothes thy legs, thy breast the bristles suit;
But thy poor mind is pluck'd up by the root.

it is not for to-mor­ row, Cæcilianus, that I invited you.
You sweep my table:
sausages and chine, A capon on which two at least may dine, Smelts, salmon, sturgeon, birds of every feather, Dripping with sauce, you wrap up all together;
And give it to your servant home to bear;
Leaving us nothing, but to sit and stare.
For shame, restore the dinner;
ease our sorrow:
I did not ask you, sir, to dine to-morrow.
Hay.
These carry home thy servant must, All in a greasy napkin thrust, Whilst wee, an idle company, Haveing nought left to eate, sitt by.
For shame, restore the meate :
I did Not for to-morrow, too, thee bid.

Tongilius is reported to be consumed with a semi-tertian fever.
I know the cunning of the man ;
he has a hunger­ and-thirst fever.
He is now craftily spreading nets for fat thrushes, and throwing out a hook for mullet and pike.
He wants strained Cæcuban wine, and wine ripened in the year of Opimius;
and dark Falernian which is stored in small fla­ gons.
All the doctors have ordered Tongilius to bathe.
Fools !
do they think it is a case of fever ?
It is disease of the throat.
2
That Tongelin is feverish, many think;
I know the man;
he wants choice meat and drink.
Straight for fat thrush and cocks springes are set;
For pike and carp's employ’d the casting net;
Purveyance for old Cæcuban is made, Such as the sound drink sparing and allay'd ;
Bathing, physicians with one voice prescribe :
To cure his fever, fools, his belly bribe.
Anon. 1695.
Laugh if thou art wise, girl, laugh," said, I believe, the poet of the Peligni.3
But he did not say this to all girls.
Granting, however, that he did say it to all girls, he did not say it to you :
you are not a girl, Maximina, and you have but three teeth, and those plainly the colour of pitch and of boxwood.
If, therefore, you believe your mirror and me, you should shrink from laughing as much as Spanius dreads the wind, Priscus a touch,' Fabulla, with chalked face, a rain-cloud, or Sabella, painted with white-lead, the sun.
Put on a countenance more severe than the consort of Priam, and hie eldest daughter-in-law.
Avoid the pantomimes of the amusing Philistion, and gay feasts, and whatever by its wit and mirth distends the lips with broad laughter.
It befits you to sit by the side of an afflicted mother, of a wife lamenting for her husband, or a sister for her affectionate brother, and to seek your recreation only with the tragic Muse.
Take my advice, and weep if thou art wise, girl, Weep.“
Laugh, my girle, laugh, if you bee wise ;
” Ovid, I take it, gave advice.
But nott to all advised it hee;
Or if to all, yet nott to thee :
For thou no girle art certaynly.
Thou hast three teeth, 't is true, butt which Are made of boxe, and black as pitch.
If thou 'It trust, then, thy glasse or mee, Thou shouldst as much wide laughter flee
As neat-sett clouths or borrow'd hayre Rough hands or blustring windes doe feare ;
As faces whited the rayue shunn, Or painted o'er avoyd the sun;
And with severer lookes still bee Than Hecuba and Andromache.
The farce, with foolish mimicks cloy'd, And frolick gossipings, avoyd, Or what through wanton mirth, beside, With laughter opes thy lippes too wide.
Rather with matrons sadd converse, Lamenting o'er their husbands' hearse, Or pious brother's monument;
Thy time in tragicks only spent.
And if thou 'It follow my advice, Weepe, old wench, weepe, if thou bee wise.
Old MS. 16th Cent.Laugh, lovely maid, laugh oft, if thom art wise, As I remember, Ovid does advise.
But this to every maid he never said, Or, if he did, 't was always to a maid;
'T was never spoke to wretched aged thee, To whom remain of all thy teeth but three, And those coal-black.
Therefore if this do pass
For truth, inform'd the same by thine own glass, A smile thou oughtst t'avoid with no less dread
Than gallants fear the wind for their curl'd head;
Than painted madams fear a dashing shower, Or, when pomatum'd, the sun's raging power:
Rather old Hecuba's sad mood put on, When Troy was burnt, and all her glory gone.
Mimics and drolls, a laughter-moving jest, Whatever makes thee grin or gape, detest;
Mourn by your mother's side your equal cross, Your father's and your pious brothers loss ;
Your hours in what is sad and serious spend, An ear to tragic stories only lend.
The counsel's good, if to it you can keep, Weep, if you 're prudent, old mumps, often weep.
Anon. 696Ovid, who bid the ladies laugh, Spoke only to the young and fair:
For thee his counsel were not safe, Who of sound teeth have scarce a pair.
If thou thy glass or me believe, Shun mirth as foplings do the wind:
At Durfy's farce affect to grieve;
And let thy eyes alone be kind.
Speak not though 't were to give consent, For he that sees these rotten bones, Will dread their monumental scent, And fly thy sighs like dying groans.
If thou art wise, see dismal plays, And to sad stories lend thy ear, With the afflicted spend thy days, And laugh not above once a year.

Zoilus, why sully the bath by bathing in it your lower extremities ?
It could only be made more foul, Zeilus, by your plunging your head in it.

W. S. B.This is your community of goods among friends, Candidus;
this is your community of goods which you talk about so grandiloquently day and night.
You are clad in a toga wash­ ed in the waters of Lacedæmonian Galæsus, or one which Parma supplied from a select flock:
but I, in one which the stuffed figure first exposed to the furious horns of the bull,1 would be unwilling should be called his.
The land of Cad­ mus has provided you with coats dyed by the descendants of Agenor;
for my scarlet vestments you would not get three sesterces.
Your Libyan tables are supported on feet of In­ dian ivory;
my beechen table is propped up with a pot­ sherd.
Immense mullets, on your board, cover dishes of yellow gold;
with me, my earthen platter is ruddy with a craw­ fish of the same colour as itself.
Your crowd of attend­ ants might vie with the Idæan Ganymede:
my hand serves me for an attendant.
From such a mass of wealth you give nothing to an old and faithful companion, and do you say, Candidus, that the goods of friends are common ?
Still in your mouth, and at your fingers' ends,
These words,-" All things are common amongst friends.”
Fine cloth, or Genoa velvet, is your coat:
A tattered scare-scrow mine, not worth a groat.
With tables of mahogany you 're stored:
I have but one, and that a beechen board.
The ample salmon fills your golden dish:
The crab my platter, coloured like the fish.
Your servants spruce, each seems a Ganymede:
Me a dumb-waiter serves whene'er I feed.
For old acquaintance do you nothing care ?
From so much riches can you nothing spare P
Is your expression a vain song, which ends
Where it begun ?
—All's common amongst friends.
HasAll things are common amongst friends, thou say'st;
This is thy morning and thy ev'ning song :
Thou in rich point and Indian silk art dress*d, Six foreign steeds to thy calash belong;
Whilst by my clothes the ragman scarce would gain;
And an uneasy hackney jolts my sides:
A cloak embroider'd interrupts thy rain, A worsted camblet my torn breeches hides.
Turbots and mullets thy large dishes hold, In mine a solitary whiting lies:
Thy train might fire the impotent and old, Whilst my poor hand a Ganymede supplies.
For an old wanting friend thou It nothing do, Yet all is common among friends we know:
Nothing so common as to use 'em so.
Sedley.
Whether it be a slave that I have bought, or a new toga, or something worth perhaps three or four pounds, Sextus, that usurer, who, you all know, is an old acquaintance of mine, is immediately afraid lest I should ask a loan, and takes his measures accordingly;
whispering to himself, but so that I may hear:
" I owe Secundus seven thousand ses­ terces, Phœbus four, Philetus eleven;
and there is not a far­ thing in my cash-box."
Profound stratagem of my old ac­ quaintance !
It is hard to refuse me a favour, Sextus, when you are asked ;
how much harder, before you are asked.
Whether 1 've bought a frieze coat, or a boy, For three or four times double the pound Troy, Forthwith the usurer Sextus, whom you know To be my ancient neighbour-friend in show, In care lest I should borrow of him, fears, And whispers to himself, but by my ears, " I to Secundus owe seven thousand pounds;
To Phoebus four;
eleven Philetus sounds ;
Whilst I have not one farthing in my chest."
Oh my conceited friend's ingenious jest!
Sextus, ’t is hard to give a flat denial
When thou art ask'd ;
much more before the tria..
Fletcher
The scrivener, who of late so rich is grown,
Whom we have long so intimately known, Saw my coat laced, my boy in livery wait, And on my side board a small piece of plate:
He thence concludes, I'm now extravagant;
And, fearing I may his assistance want, He mumbles to himself, that I may hear:
“My God!
what will become of me this year!
Seven thousand pounds to Gripe, to Shylock four I owe;
and to my broker as much more!
And not one farthing by me!
nor can get!"
How great, old friend, is your Change-alley wit!
To ask and be denied is hard, all know:
Before I ask, is most extremely so.
Hay.
When I had purchased a fresh whore or coat For which I knew not how to pay, Sextus, that wretched, covetous old sot, My ancient friend, as he will say, Lest I should borrow of him took great care, And mutter'd to himself aloud, So as he knew I could not choose but hear, How much he to Secundus owed;
And twice as much he paid for interest, Nor had one farthing in his trusty chest:
If I had ask'd, I knew he would not lend, 'T is new, before-hand, to deny a friend.

Like as flowery Hybla is variegated with many a colour, when the Sicilian bees are laying waste the fleeting gifts of spring, so your presses shine with piles of cloaks, your wardrobe glistens with uncounted robes.
And your white garments, which the land of Apulia produced from more than one flock, would clothe a whole tribe.
You look, un­ moved, upon your ill-clad friend in the winter months, shame on you!
while you yourself fear the cold which pierces my ragged side.
What sacrifice would it have been, wretched mortal, to deprive of a couple of habits—(what do you fear ?)
-not yourself, Nævolus, but the moths ?
Not all the hues the blooming Hybla sees, When short-lived spring revives Sicilian bees, With the rich glories of the vestments vie, That thy vast wardrobe's endless stores supply.
Though a whole nation warm the fleece could keep, Shorn from thy numberless Apulian sheep;
Thou canst supine thy threadbare friend behold, Inhuman eye him !
shieldless from the cold.
What were it, should'st thou reave two bits of cloth;
Nay, frown not:
not from thee, but from the moth ?
ElphinstonA wine-merchant, a butcher, a bath, a barber, a chess- board and men, and a few books (but give me the selection of them) ;
one companion, not too unpolished;
a tall tier­ vant, one who preserves his youthful bloom for a long time;
a damsel beloved of my servant:
secure me these things, Rufus, even though it were at Butunti,1 and you may keep to yourself the baths of Nero.
Wine, and good fare, and my own person nice, Backgammon-tables, and a pair of dice, Books very few, but those all chosen right, One only friend, and him not unpolite, A man and maid, both honest, free from crime, Both neat and bandy, and in age's prime, Grant me in any corner of the land:

ElphinstonDo you wish to become free?
You lie, Maximus, you do not wish it.
But if you should wish to become so, you can in this way.
You will be free, if you give up dining out;
if the Veientan grape assuages your thirst;
if you can smile at the golden dishes of the querulous Cinna;
if you can be content in a toga like mine;
if a plebeian mistress becomes yours for a couple of small coins ;
if you can submit to lower your head when you enter your house.
If you have strength and force of mind such as this, you may live more free than the monarch of Parthia.
Would you be free?
't is your chief wish, you say.
Come on ;
I '11 show thee, friend, the certain way:
If to no feasts abroad thou lov'st to go, Whilst bounteous God does bread at home bestow;
If thou the goodness of thy clothes do'st prize By thine own use, and not by others' eyes;
If (only safe from weathers) thou canst dwell
In a small house, but a convenient shell;
If thou without a sigh, or golden wish, Canst look upon thy beechen bowl and dish ;
If in thy mind such power and greatness be ;
The Persian king's a slave compared with thee.
Cowly.
Parson !
't is false ;
I '11 ne'er believe With liberty you wish to live :
You hug your chains, and cut your jokes
On us, poor independent folks.
But would you then indeed be free ?
Come, I '11 prescribe-without a fee.
First, then, 't is plain you love to eat, And haunt the tables of the great:
You shun the man, and think him poor, That cannot give you “ four and four. ”
Indeed, my friend, this must not be ;
A parasite can ne'er be free.
Next, Doctor, you must drink no wine.- Ch.
Why so ?
Saint Paul, that great divine, Says, " Drink a little.”—F. That's not the question
You can't afford it—Ch. But for digestion- P. A glass of cider, or old mead, Or e'en mild ale, will do the deed.
Then, you 're a captain in your dress ;
A good black frieze would cost you less,
And look more venerable too, Than that grey cloth which I call blue.
Talk what you please, you '11 ne'er be free, If you despise economy.
Perhaps, too, you may think a wife Amongst the requisites of life:
Why, take some healthy farmers daughter, Some Blousalind—nay, spare your laughter:
She '11 mend your shirts, inspect your brewing A lady, sir, would be your ruin.
Your pars'nage house, I own, is mean;
But see!
that fragrant jessamine ;
See!
how that woodbine round the door
And lattice blooms-What would you more ?
Oh!
Doctor, could you but despise Life's pompous superfluities;
Could you but learn to live content With what indulgent Heav'n has sent;
Whate'er your lot, you'd live more free Than any prince-in Germany.
Rev. R. GravmYou talk of freedom, trust me, friend, Your freedom all in talk will end.
If It is your passion to be free, Contented dine at home, like me ;
Your beverage draw from Whitbread's butt;
Wear useful clothes of homely cut;
And though you cease to please the fair, Discard all powder from your hair:
Walk undistinguish'd 'mid the group, Nor scorn a door that makes you stoop
To such a plan contract your view, And kings will be less free than you.
dm&Would'st thou be free ?
I fear thou art in jest
But if thou would'st, this is the only law;
Be no man's tavern nor domestic guest:
Drink wholesome wine which thy own servants draw.
Of knavish Cario scorn the ill-got plate, The numerous servants and the cringing throng:
With a few friends on fewer dishes eat, And let thy clothes, like mine, be plain and strong.
Such friendships make as thou may'st keep with ease;
Great men expect what good men hate to pay;
Be never thou thyself in pain to please, But leave to fools and knaves th' uncertain prey.
Let thy expense with thy estate keep pace ;
Meddle with no man's business, save thine own:
Contented pay for a plebeian face, And leave vain fops the beauties of the town.
If to this pitch of virtue thou canst bring
Thy mind, thou 'rt freer than the Persian king.
Sedley.
You wish to be treated with deference, Sextus:
I wished to love you.
I must obey you:
you shall be treated with deference, as you desire.
But if I treat you with deference, I shall not love you.
Yes ;
I submit, my lord;
you've gain'd your end:
I'm now your slave-that would have been your friend ;
I '11 bow, I '11 cringe, be supple as your glove ;
— Respect, adore you—everything but-love.

I offer love, but thou respect wilt have;
Take, Sextus, all thy pride and folly crave :
But know I can be no man's friend and slave.

Among the nations of Libya your wife, Gallus, is un­ happily renowned for the disgraceful reproach of immoder­ ate avarice.
But what is said of her is pure falsehood;
she is not in the habit of receiving always.
What then is she in the habit of doing ?

But she is wrong'd, and all are lies they tell;

He, whom you see walking slowly along with careless step, who takes his way, in violet-coloured robes, through the middle of the square ;
whom my friend Publius does not sur­ pass in dress, nor even Cordus himself, the Alpha of Cloaks ;
he, I say, who is followed by a band of clients and slaves, and a litter with new curtains and girths, has but just now pawned his ring at Cladius' counter for barely eight sesterces, to get himself a dinner.
He whom you see to walk in so much state, Waving and slow, with a majestic gait, In purple clad, passing the nobles' seat, My Publius not in garments more complete ;

Young Hyllus, you are the favoured gallant of the wife of a military tribune;
do you fear, in consequence, merely the punishment of a child ?
Have a care;
while thus divert­ ing yourself, your flame will be suddenly extinguished.

Well, and what you are doing, Hyllus, is that lawful ?
Audacious stripling, hast no shame, To tempt an armed tribune's dame P And dost thou, youngster, barely fear
The chastisement all boys revere ?

You had but a hundred thousand sesterces, Milichus, and those were consumed in ransoming Leda from the Via Sacra.
This, Milichus, would have been an act of great extravagance, had you loved at such a price, even though rich.
You will at once tell me, " I am not in love."
It is still an act of great extravagance.

Of wealth in love luxuriant the disburse!
I'm in no love, cries Milic.
Ten times worse.

While you are thinking of becoming, sometimes a lawyer, sometimes a professor of eloquence, and cannot decide, Laurus, what you mean to be, the age of Peleus, and Priam, and Nestor, has passed by with you, and it would now be late enough for you even to retire from any profession.

One ringlet of hair, in the whole circle of Lalage's tresses, was out of its place, having been badly fixed by an erring pin.
This crime she punished with the mirror,1 by means of which she discovered it, and Plecusa fell to the ground under her blows, in consequence of the cruel hair.
Cease now, La­ lage, to adorn your fatal locks;
let no waiting-woman hence­ forth touch your outrageous head.
Let the salamander2 leave its venom on it, or the razor pitilessly denude it, that the image may be worthy of your mirror.
One single curl beyond its bounds had stray'd ;
The wandering hair-pin one false loop had made.
This fault to Lalage her mirror shows;
Plecusa's head receives its stunning blows.
Cease, Lalage, to deck thy brows;
forbear;
Cease, maidens, cease to dress that fury's hair.
Let scissors clip, or asps among it Bit;
Then, then her face that mirror shall befit.

Because
I now address you by your name, when I used before to call you lord and master, do not regard me as pre­ sumptuous.
At the price of all my chattels I have purchased my cap of liberty.
He only wants lords and masters who cannot govern himself, and who covets what lords and masters covet.
If you can do without a servant, Olus, you can alto do without a master.
That I do you with humble bows, no more, And danger of my naked head, adore;
That I, who lord and master cried erewhile, Salute you in a new and different style, By your own name, a scandal to you now;
Think not that I forget myself and you :
By loss of all things by all others sought, This freedom, and the freeman's hat, is bought.
A lord and master no man wants, but he Who o'er himself has no authority, Who does for honours and for riches strive, And follies, without which lords cannot live.
If thou from fortune dost no servant crave, Believe it, thou no master need'st to have.

You say, Classicus, that it is against your will that you dine from home.
May I perish, Classicus, if you do not lie.
Even Apicius himself delighted in going out to dinner, and, when he dined at home, was rather out of spirits.
If, however, you go against your will, why, Classicus, do you go at all ?
“I am obliged," you say.
It is true;
just as much as Selius 1 is obliged.
See now, Melior invites you to a regular dinner, Classicus;
where are your grand protest­ ations ?
if you are a man, say " No.
"Unwillingly thou supp'st abroad!
I '11 die, If what thou say'st be not a splendid lie.
In others' treats Apicius did delight, And with regret at home did pass the night.
If thou unwilling art, why dost thou go ?
Thou 'rt forced, thou say'st.
All smell-feasts are forced so.
Melior invites thee to a sumptuous feast:
Where are thy brags ?
Deny.
Now is the test.
Anon. 1695.
When thou art ask'd to sup abroad, Thou swear'st thou hast but newly dined;
That eating late does overload
The stomach, and oppress the mind;
But if Apicius makes a treat, The slenderest summons thou obey'st;
No child is greedier of the teat
Than thou art of the bounteous feast.
There thou wilt drink till every star
Be swallowed by the rising sun ;
Such charms hath wine we pay not for, And mirth at other's charge begun.
Who shuns his club, yet flies to every treat, Does not a supper, but a reckoning hate.

No one is more ingenious than yourself, Cæcilianus;
I have remarked it.
Whenever I read a few distichs from my own compositions, you forthwith recite some bits of Marsus or Catullus.
Do you offer me these, as though what you read were inferior to mine, so that, when placed side by side, my compositions should gain by the comparison ?
I believe you do.
Nevertheless I should prefer, Cæcilianus, that you recite your own.
There's none than thee more candid can be said, Who, when some parcels in my book thou 'st read, From Marsus or Catullus dost recite
The like, to show how much I better write, Compared with them.
Thy goodwill 's to me known, But would thou 'dst read some verses of thine own.
Anon. 1695.
Nothing, I see, your candour can exceed, My distichs whensoe'er you please to read:
From Dryden or from Pope you cite a line, To show how much they both fall short of mine.
Such foils, no doubt, make mine appear more taking, Yet I should choose some verses of your making.

2Do you notice,Maternus, that Saufeius accompanied in front and behind by a crowd of followers, a crowd as great as that by which Regulus is escorted home after sending off his shaven 1 client to the lofty temples of the gods P
Do not envy him.
May such an escort never, I pray, be yours.
Fuficu­ lenus and Faventinus procure for him these friends and flocks of clients.
What trains before, what trains behind him ride!
What crowds of friends support him on each side!
Such multitudes did never with lord mayor
On solemn festival to Paul's repair :

Envy him not:

You see his mortgage ;

A lion who had been accustomed to put up with the blows of his unsuspecting master, and quietly to suffer a hand to be inserted in his mouth, has unlearned his peaceful habits, his fierceness having suddenly returned, greater even than it ought to have been on the Libyan mountains.
For, cruel and malicious, he slew with furious tooth two boys of that young band whose duty it was to put a new face on the en­ sanguined arena with their rakes.
Never did the theatre of Mars behold a greater atrocity.
We may exclaim :
"
Savage, faithless robber!
learn from Rome's sacred wolf to spare children.
"A lion, wont his keeper's stripes to bear, Into whose mouth his hand, without all fear, He used to thrust, such tameness he was taught;
But suddenly so high his fury wrought, 'T was 'bove what from the Libyan clime he brought;
For while two boys did rake the sandy floor, With savage rage he both in pieces tore,- The theatre like crime ne'er knew before.
Romans may well say, “ Treacherous beast, forbear;
Of Romulus wolf young children learn to spare."
Anon. 1695.

Elphinston,You, Cosconius, who think my epigrams long, may pos­ sibly be expert at greasing carriage-wheels.
With like judgment, you would think the Colossus too tall, and might call Brutus's boy 2 too short.
Learn something which you do not know:
two pages of Marsus and the learned Pedo often contain only one epigram.
Those compositions are not long, in which there is nothing to retrench:
but you, Cos. comus, write even distichs that are too long.
My epigrams are long in your conceit:
Much fitter for a groom than judge of wit.
Long in your sense the giants in Guildhall;
And short the British king on Ludgate-wall.
Learn, that the Iliad and the Æneid shines, Though each contains so many thousand lines.
Works are not long, from which you nought can take :
But long the very distichs which you make.
Hay Coscus, thou say'st my epigrams are long:
I'd take thy judgment on a pot of ale:
So thou may'st say the elephant's too strong, A dwarf too short, the pyramid too tall.
Things are not long where we can nothing spare :
But, Coscus, even thy distichs tedious are.

Because
I neither delight in verse that may be read back­ wards,4 nor reverse the effeminate Sotades ;
5 because nowhere in my writings, as in those of the Greeks, are to be found echoing verses,' and the handsome Attis does not dictate to me a soft and enervated Galliambic strain;
2 I am not on that account, Classicus, so very bad a poet.
What if you were to order Ladas against his will to mount the narrow ridge of the petaurum ?
3
It is absurd to make one's amuse­ ments difficult;
and labour expended on follies is childish.
Let Palaemon write verses for admiring crowds.
I would rather please select ears.
That I acrostics' glory not do write;
In verses, backward read, take no delight;
Make not the echo in my verses play, After the Grecian poetastering way ;
Nor yet soft melting numbers so respect, As more the chime, than ev'n the sense, t' affect ;
—
So bad a poet, as these ways to take, I am not, Classicus.
What hire would make Ladas, for swiftness famed, so meanly stoop, To leave the race, and tumble through a hoop ?
Disgraceful't is unto a poet's name Difficult toys to make his highest aim :
The labour's foolish that doth rack the brains
For things have nothing in them, but much pains.

For delighting to lengthen out the night over too many cups, I pardon you, Gaurus;
you have the weakness of Cato.
For writing verses without help from Apollo and the Muses, you deserve to be praised;
this weakness was that of Cicero.
You vomit;
that was Antonius' failing;
your luxury, that of Apicius.
But as to your abominable de­ bauchery, tell me, from whom do you derive that ?
In profuse drinking that thy nights are spent, Gaurus, thou Cato hast for precedent;
Tully, for barbarous verses thou dost write, As if the Muses bore to thee a spite ;
Antony, Apicius, vomitings did use ;
— Thy horrid lust no patron can excuse.
Anon. 1695.
That thou dost shorten thy long nights with wine, We all forgive thee, for so Cato did ;
That thou writ'st poems without one good line, Tully's example may that weakness hide.
Thou art a cuckold;
so great Cæsar was:
Eat'st till thou spew'st;
Antonius did the same
Thou lovest whores;
Jove loves a bucksome lass:
But that thou 'rt whipped is thy peculiar shame.

Quintilian, supreme ruler over our unsteady youth,- Quintilian, glory of the Roman toga, do not blame me, that I, though poor yet not useless to my generation, hasten to enjoy life:
no one hastens enough to do so.
Let him de­ lay doing so, who desires to have a greater estate than his father, and who crowds his lofty halls with countless busts.
A quiet hearth delights me, and a house which disdains not the blackness of smoke,1 a running spring, and a natural piece of turf.
May these be mine;
a well-fed attendant, a wife not over-learned, nights with sleep, days without strife.
Quintilian, thou glory of the gowne, And for instructing youth of high renowne, If, poore, my life to mee content can give, Allow me:
none t' himselfe too much can live.
Lett who will strive their fathers' wealth t' enlarge, And with vast statues their huge porches charge ;
Give mee good fires, though in a smoaky ball, Unforced springs, and grass-plotts naturall ;
With full fedd clownes, and not too learn'd a wife, Spending my nights in sleepe, dayes without strife.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
Wonder net, sir (you who instruct the town
In the true wisdom of the sacred gown),
That I make haste to live, and cannot hold Patiently out, till I grow rich and old.
Life for delays and doubts no time does give;
None ever yet made haste enough to live.
Let him defer it, whose preposterous care Omits himself, and reaches to his heir.
Who does his father's bounded stores despise, And whom his own, too, never can suffice.
My humble thoughts no glittering roofs require, Or rooms that shine with aught but constant fire I will content the avarice of my sight With the fair gildings of reflected light:
Pleasures abroad the sport of nature yields, Her living fountains, and her smiling fields.
And then at home, what pleasure is't to see A little cleanly cheerful family!
Which if a chaste wife crown, no less in her Than fortune, I the golden mean prefer.
Too noble, nor too wise, she should not be, No, nor too rich, too fair, too fond of me.
Thus let my life slide silently away, With sleep all night, and quiet all the day.
Cowley.
Cæsar, thou who art the certain safety of the empire, t glory of the universe, from whose preservation we derive o belief in the existence of the gods ;
if my verses, so often re by thee in my hastily composed books, have succeeded fixing thy attention, permit that to seem to be which f< tune forbids to be in reality, namely, that I may be regard as the father of three children.
1
This boon, if I have fail to please thee, will be some consolation to me;
if I he succeeded in pleasing thee, will be some reward.
Welfare and glory of the earth, while thee We safe behold, we gods believe to be ;
If my slight books did e'er thee entertain, And oft to read them thou didst not disdain, What nature does deny, do thou bestow:
For father of three children make me go.
When my verse takes not, this will be an ease;
A high reward, in case it thee do please.
Anon.

THIS book, whatever may be its worth, Gaul, named after the Roman toga,1 sends from far distant climes.
You read it, and award your praise perhaps to the preceding;
but both are equally mine, whichsoever you think the better.
That book which saw the light in the city should, indeed, give the greater pleasure;
for a book of Roman production should bear the palm over one from Gaul.
This third book, good or bad, whatever it be, Gallia Togata sends from far to thee.
If, reading this, my former thou dost praise, Both yet are mine, that which least claims the bays.
Those must excel, born, Rome, within thy wall:
A slave of thine, above a free-born Gaul.

To whom, my little book, do you wish me to dedicate you ?
Make haste to choose a patron, lest, being hurried off into a murky kitchen, you cover tunnies with your wet leaves, or become a wrapper for incense and pepper.
Is it into Fausti­ nus' bosom that you flee ?
you have chosen wisely:
you may now make your way perfumed with oil of cedar, and, decorat­ ed with ornaments at both ends, luxuriate in all the glory of painted bosses ;
delicate purple may cover you, and your title proudly blaze in scarlet.
With him for your patron, fear not even Probus.
2Whither, thou darling child of joke, To what protector dost thou fly ?
Lest, wrapt in culinary smoke, Thou dripping clothe the tunny-fry:
Lest holy incense thou profane, Or think to lend the pepper poignance ;
Thou wouldst Faustinus' bosom gain ?
That is thy father's own enjoinance.
Imbued with cedars potent oil, The country thou beroam'st, and coast.
Thy decent frontlets nought shall soil:
Thou may'st thy painted navels boast.
And now, in gorgeous purple clad, Thy face assumes a maiden-blush :
In such a patron wisely glad, Thou valuest Probus not a rush.

Your face, which is beautiful, you cover with a black veil but with your person, which is not beautiful, you offend the waters in which you bathe.
Imagine that the nymph of the brook herself addresses you in these words of mine:
"Either uncover your face, or bathe dressed.
"Thy face, that's fair, thou veil'st when thou dost go To bathe, an ugly body naked show.
Believe the water-nymph thee thus doth pray, "Bathe in thv clothes, or cast thy veil away." Anon. 1695.
Go your ways to Rome, my book.
If Rome shall ask whence you are come, you will say from the quarter to which the Æmilian Way leads.
If she shall inquire in what land I am, or in what city, you may reply that I am at Cornelii Forum.
2
If she ask the reason of my absence, make in few words a full confession :
"
He was not able to endure the wearisomeness and vanity of the toga."
3
If she shall say, “When is he likely to return ?" reply, "
He departed a poet:
he will return when he has learned to play the lyre.”
1Hie thee to Rome, my book.
If whence, she say;
Tell her thou earnest from th' Æmilian Way.
If, in what track or town, she ask, we be;
In old Cornelius' Forum, Madam, he.
Why does the poet stray so far from town P
He could not bear the languors of the gown.
When comes he back ?
the next inquiry moves:
A bard he went;
but comes, when he a minstrel proves.
ElphinstonDo you wish, my little book, who are going to the city without me, to have recommendations to several persons ?
or will one person be sufficient ?
One, believe me, will be suffi­ cient,—one to whom you will not be a stranger,—Julius, whose name is so constantly on my lips.
Him you will seek out without delay, near the very entrance to the Via Tecta;
he lives in the house which Daphnis once occupied.
He has a wife, who will receive you to her arms and bosom, even were rOll to go to her covered with dust.
Whether you see them together, or either of them first, you will say, “ Marcus bids me salute you," and that is enough.
Let letters of introduction herald others;
he is foolish, who thinks it ne­ cessary to be introduced to his own friends.
Thee, little book, whom swift to town I send, To many, or to one, shall I commend ?
To one, enough;
nor shalt a stranger be :
Julius !
a consecrated name to me.
To him then hie :
lo!
sitting at the door, (He guards the gods, that Daphnis did before,) Thou seest his dame, whose longing arms will press, Or bosom, thee, should'at all in dust address.
Whether them both, or either, thou assail, Say :
Marcus bid you, both or either, hail.
Let dedications incense power or pelf:
No letter need address another self.

This is the third day, Marcellinus, after the Ides of May;
a day to be celebrated by you with double rites:
for it witnessed the introduction of your father to the light of heaven, and was the first to receive the offering from your blooming cheeks.
1
Although the day conferred on your father the gift of a happy life, yet it never afforded him a greater blessing than your safe arrival at manhood.
Hail, happy third beyond the Ides of May !
Twice, my dear Marcelline, thy holy day.
This brought thy parent to th' ethereal gales:
This of thy down the primal harvest hails.
On this whatever joys have whilom flow'd, More on a father never day bestowed.

To their defects they 're for the match in debt, And, but for faults on both sides, ne'er had met.

Your father, Philomusus, allowed you two thousand ses­ terces a month, and paid you day by day;
because, with you, the wants of the morrow always pressed close on the extra­ vagance of to-day;
and consequently it was necessary to allow daily aliment to your vices.
Your father is now dead, and has left you his sole heir;
and by so doing, Philomusus, be has disinherited you.
1
Your father gave you a large monthly pay;
And this continued to his dying day :
Yet want still followed close your luxury ;
And daily vices daily craved supply :
But now he all bath left you, and is dead, By being heir you 're disinherited.
Hay.
Your father, young Split-coin, they say, Allow'd you five hundred a year;
And it came like a corporal's pay ;

’T would keep you from starving, he thought;

But his will, in appearance less strict, Outright gave you all he could give:
Why, already we see how you 're trick'd- Disinherited, Bob, as I live.

If your mistress, Quintus, is neither Thais nor one-eyed, why do you imagine my distich to have been levelled against you ? —
But perhaps there is some similarity in the name;
perhaps it said Thais for Lais. —
Tell me, what similarity is there between Thais and Hermione ?-But you are Quintus, you say ;
— well, let us change the name of the lover.
If Quintus will not have Thais, let Sextus be her swain.
1If she thou lov'st nor blind nor Thais be, What makes thee think last distich writ on thee ?
If Lais 't were, and her I 'd Thais named, For such resemblance I might well be blamed :
But what similitude do these two bear ?
How do Hermione and Thais pair ?
But thou art Quintus, and that name I chuse.
Be It so:
I always feigned names do use.
I '11 change the lover's name, if that please more ;
Sextus, not Quintus, Thais loves, the whore.

The perfumes, I own, were good which you gave your guests yesterday;
but you carved nothing.
It is a queer kind of entertainment to be perfumed and starved at the same time.
A man, Fabullus, who eats nothing, and is embalmed, seems to me a veritable corpse.
Faith!
your essence was excelling;
But you gave us nought to eat :
Nothing tasting, sweetly smelling, Is, Fabullus, scarce a treat.

Who not feeds, but is anointed, Lives like nothing but the dead.

While you refuse to cut up the hare, Nævia, and the mul­ let, and spare the boar which is already more than putrid, you accuse and ill-treat your cook, on the pretence that he has served up everything raw and indigestible.
At such a banquet I shall never suffer from indigestion.
While boar to carve, and mullets thou dost spare, Wilt sooner cut thy father up, than hare :

Cobbler, kinglet of cobblers, you give gladiatorial ex­ hibitions, and what your awl has bestowed the sword destroys.

Anon. 1695.A tart, which had been carried round the second course several times, burnt the hand with its excessive heat.
But the throat of Sabidius was still more ardent to swallow it;
he immediately, therefore, blew upon it three or four times with his mouth.
The tart certainly grew cooler, and seemed likely to allow us to touch it.
But no one would touch it:
it was infected.
A tart around the second service flew, And burnt whatever hand the nearest drew.

Close to the hundred columns, where figures of wild beasts adorn the plane-grove, is to be seen a she-bear.
The fair Hylas, playing near it, explored its yawning jaws, and buried his tender hand in its mouth;
but an accursed viper was lurking in the dark recesses of the brazen throat, and the bear was animated with a breath more deadly than its own.
The child did not perceive that any mischief was there, until he was dying from the bite of the snake.
Ob, sad mis­ fortune !
that the bear was not a real one !
In the Piazza, where tall poplars grow, And well-carved beasts adorn the shaded row, A rugged bear takes up a mighty space, The ornament and terror of the place.
Young Hylas there the horrid monster saw, And fearless sported with its gaping jaw.
A lurking viper animates the stone, And arms the brute with poison, not its own.
Too late, alas!
the fair expiring boy Found bears could sting, and marble could destroy.

Tell me, my Muse, what my Canius Rufus I is doing.
Is he committing to imperishable tablets the history of the family of the Claudii, for future generations to read;
or refuting the falsehoods of the historian of Nero ?
Or is he imitating the jocosity of the plain-speaking Phædrus ? 2
Or is he sport­ ing in elegiacs ;
or writing gravely in heroic verse ?
Or is he terrible in the buskin of Sophocles ?
Or is he idling in the school of the poets, uttering jests seasoned with Attic salt P Or, if he has retired from thence, is he pacing the portico of the temple of Isis,3 or traversing at his ease the enclosure of the Argonauts ? 4
Or rather, is he sitting or walking, in the afternoon, free from cankering cares, in the sunny box-groves of the delicate Europa ? 5
Or is he bathing in the warm baths of Titus or of Agrippa, or in that of the shameless Tigillinus ? 6
Or is he enjoying the country seat of Tullus and Lucanus ?
I or hastening to Pollio's delightful retreat, four miles from the city ?
Or has he set out for scorch­ ing Baiæ, and is he now sailing about on the Lucrine lake ?—"
Do you wish to know what your Canius is doing ?
Laughing.
”Tell me, my Muse, how Canius spends his time :
In lasting leaves, and in immortal rhyme, Does he the facts of Nero rightly state, From malice and from ftatt'ry free, relate ?
Light elegies, or grave heroics write ?
I' th' comic, or the tragic strain delight ?
Or in the poets' school does Canius sit, Regaling all with his choice Attic wit P Or else, being free from study, does he talk I' th' temples, and the shady porches walk ?
Bathes he ?
Or from the city toil retired, Are fields and rivers more by him admired, Baia's or Lucrin's sweet recess desired ?
[ Muse. ]
How Canius spends his time, would'st have me show?
He laughs at all which most men serious do.

A goat, guilty of having gnawed a vine, was standing doomed before the altar of Bacchus, a grateful victim for his sacred rites.
When the Tuscan soothsayer was about to sacrifice him to the god, he chanced to order a rustic and unlettered countryman to castrate the animal quickly with a sharp knife, so that the foul odour from the unclean flesh might pass away.

But while he himself, with his body bent over the grassy altar, was cutting the neck of the struggling animal with his knife, and pressing it down with his hand, an immense hernia of his own showed itself at the outraged rites.
This the rustic seized and cut, thinking that the ancient rites of sacrifice demanded it, and that the ancient deities were honoured with such offerings.
So you, who but a while since were a Tuscan, are become a Gallus ;
3 and while you were cutting the throat of a goat, you were cut yourself.
A goat without awe, Who tendrils would gnaw, Was doom'd on the altar to die.
Now, Bacchus, thy priest Laid hold of the beast!
And thus to a clown that stood by :
“
While I shall divine, Lop off either sign, That so no rank odour remain."
When now he would slay, Both strugglingly lay;
Both doomed the green altar to stain.
As thus they lay low, How dire was the show!
The auspices saw it, and scowl’d.
The clown, with a knife, Clear'd all to the life:
Too late the bare bacchanal howl'd.
Well thought the poor man,
When orgies began, Such fibres high honour were held in.
The priest of the god Own'd Cybele's nod f And, slaying the goat, proved a gelding.
ElphinstonIf you wish, Faustinus, a bath of boiling water to be re­ duced in temperature,-a bath, such as scarcely Julianua could enter,—ask the rhetorician Sabinæus to bathe him­ self in it.
He would freeze the warm baths of Nero.
If thy hot bath, Faustus, thou seek’st to cure, 'Bove what a paralytic can endure:
Let orator Sabinus enter in Nero's hot baths, he '11 make a cooling spring.

Alone you possess your farms, Candiaus, alone your cash;
alone your golden and murrhine vessels;
alone your Music wine, alone your Cæcuban of Opimius' year;
alone your heart, alone your wit;
alone you possess all your property;
(do you think I wish to deny it ?)—but your wife, Candidus, you share with all the world.
Candidus has alone fine farms, gold coin, Myrrh, and drinks Ceecuban, and Massic wine;
Has the sole wisdom, and the only wit;
Enjoys the world alone, and all in it.
But has he all alone ?
That I deny ;
His wife with all is in community.
Fletcher.
Thy pleasant farm thou dost enjoy alone, Thy money, plate, communicat'st to none.
Alone, thou aged Massic wine dost drink, Alone thyself both wise and witty think:
That all thou hast alone, I yet deny, Thy wife is common, or the people lie.

You never invite me again, although you frequently accept my invitations.
I pardon you, Gallus, provided that you do not invite others.
But others you certainly do invite ;
—we are both in the wrong.
" How sop,” you ask.
I have no common sense;
and you, Gallus, no sense of shame.
I often you, you mee doe never bid, Which I could pardon if none else you did;
But others you invite :
—we 're both to blame,- Myself for want of witt, and you of shame.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
That oft I thee, thou me dost never call
To sup, I could forgive, if none at all Thou didst invite :
but, churl, thou dost afford
To other guests a frequent well-served board.
We 're faulty both.
In what, dost bid me name ?
I for the want of wit, and thou of shame.

Tell me then, Gargilianus, how do you contrive to live at Rome ?
Whence comes your paltry toga, and the rent of your murky den ?
Whence the money for a bath among the poor ?
or for the favours of Chione ?
You say you live in the highest degree reasonably, but you act unreasonably, in my opinion, in living at all.
No money’s paid, yet gratis eat'st my cheer, But when at Rome, Gargilian, what dost there ?
Whence hast thou house-rent ?
or whence hast a coat ?
How canst thou pay thy wench ?
whence host a groat ?
Though with much reason thou art said to live, Yet how thou dost it none can reason give.

You have, I admit, many a wide acre of land, and many a farm over which Alban household gods preside;
crowds of debtors to your well-tilled money-chest serve you as their master, and golden tables support your meals.
Do not, however, Faustinus, disdain smaller people than yourself:
Didymus bad more than you have;
Philomelus' has more.
I own, in manors you have large command ;
And rich in houses are, as well as land :
You have in mortgages a vast estate:
Your table elegant, and served in plate.
Despise not your inferiors on this score :
More once had Verres, Cheatall now hath more.
Hay.
I own, Sir Lutestring, you ’ve a million clear, You boast in lands ten thousand pounds a year;
Your various mortgages no chest can hold, Subscriptions, loans, and South Sea stock untold;
You eat on silver, and you drink in gold.
Yet sneer not righteous patriots, though on foot, Nor grin at virtue in an old surtout.
Sejanus claim'd than you a larger store Rufinus and Eutropius, sir, had more, And so had Osterman,—but all is o'er.

You ask, Matrinia, whether I can love an old woman, I can, even an old woman :
but you are not an old woman ;

I can love a Hecuba or a Niobe, Matrinia, provided the one has not yet become a hound, or the ether a stone.
Ask you, poor Bell, if I can love the old P I can,- but you are absolutely dead.
Bad Niobe, or Hecuba the scold, I might have borne ;
but nature's self had fled From tender looks, and arms in fondness thrown Around the railing bitch or weeping stone.

I prefer a lady;
but if such is denied me, my next choice would be a freed-woman.
A slave is the last resource ;
but if her beauty indemnifies the want of birth, I shall prefer her to either.
A wife of high descent, I first would wed;
For want of such, one freed should share my bed;
A slave the last;
yet if she noble be Inform, I'd chuse her first of all the three.

Such attentions as you receive from a new and lately made friend, Fabianus, you expect to receive also from me.
You ex­ pect that I should constantly run in dishabille to salute you at the dawn of day, and that your litter should drag me through the middle of the mud ;
that, worn out, I should follow you at four o'clock or later to the baths of Agrippa, while I my­ self wash in those of Titus.
Is this my reward after twenty winters' service, Fabianus, that I am ever to be in my ap­ prenticeship to your friendship ?
Is this what I have gained.
Fabianus, by my worn-out toga,-and this too my own,—that you do not consider me to have yet earned my discharge ?
Of a new friend the duties dire, Thou, Fabian, wouldst of me require:
That bristling I each mom repair, To tend through thick and thm thy chair:
That It at ten, or later hour, Despising toil's and hunger's power, Convoy thee to Agrippa's wave, When I must thence with Titus lave.
•
Thus, thirty winters at thy will!
And must I be thy novice still ?
This salary must make make known, For wearing out the gown my own P Nor have I length of duty trod, To merit the discharging rod ?

What cause or what presumption, Sextus, brings you to Rome ?
what do you expect or seek here ?
Tell me.
"I will plead causes," you say, " more eloquently than Cicero himself, and in the three forums 1 there shall be no one to equal me."
Atestinus pleaded causes, and Civis ;
you knew both of them;
but neither made enough to pay for his lodging.
"
If nothing is to be gained from this pursuit, I will write verses :
when you have heard them, you will say they are Virgil's own."
You are mad;
all that you see here hivering in threadbare cloaks are Ovids and Virgils. " I will push my way among the great."
That trick has found sup­ port for but two or three that have attempted it, while all the rest are pale with hunger. "
What shall I do ?
advise me for I am determined to live at Rome."
If you are a good man, Sextus, you will have to live by chance.
To town what cause, or rather what ill star, Hath brought my friend ?
say what your prospects are.
More eloquent than Murray I will be ;
In the four courts, not one shall rival me.
Some, whom we know, in hall their time have lost:
Others have rid the circuit, and paid cost.
If that won't do, verses compose I will, Equal to Maro’s.
That is wilder stilL
In window'd hose, and garments twice convey'd, Our Ovids and our Virgils are arrayed.
Then I ’il attend the great.

will give thee bread:
The malice of this town thou know'st not yet:
Wit is a good diversion, but base trade.
Cowards will for thy courage call thee bully, Till all, like Thraso ’s, thy acquaintance shun !
Rogues call thee for thy honesty a cully:
Yet this is all thou hast to live upon.

For lending me one hundred and fifty thousand sesterces1 out of the vast wealth which your heavy chest, Thelesinus, contains, you imagine yourself a great friend to me.

But that the grandeur 's mine, it may be said;
Who, being poor, so great a sum repaid.

Lentinus counterfeits his youth With periwigs, I trow, But art thou changed so soon, in truth, From a swan to a crow ?

And she ’ll make bold, without your leave, To take your cap away.

Do you wish to know the reason, Ligurinus, that no one willingly meets you;
that, wherever you come, everybody takes flight, and a vast solitude is left around you ?
You are too much of a poet.
This is an extremely dangerous fault.
The tigress aroused by the loss of her whelps, the viper scorched by the midday sun, or the ruthless scorpion, are less objects of terror than you.
For who, I ask, could undergo such calls upon his patience as you make ?
You read your verses to me, whether I am standing, or sitting, or running, or about private business.
I fly to the hot baths, there you din my ears:
I seek the cold bath, there I cannot swim for your noise:
I hasten to dinner, you stop me on my way ;
I sit down to dinner, you drive me from my seat:
wearied, I fall asleep, you rouse me from my couch.
Do you wish to see how much evil you occasion ?
—You, a man just, upright, and innocent, are an object of fear.
Ycu come;
away flies every mother's son:
On Bagshot Heath you can't be more alone.
If you ask, why,—you are bewitch'd with rhyme.
And this, believe me, is a dangerous crime.
Robb'd of her whelps, a tigress thus we shim Or viper basking in the noon-day sun:
Not more the dreadful scorpion's sting we fear, Than this incessant lugging by the ear.
Standing or sitting, you repeat your lays :
On my dose-stool I hear them ;
in my chaise:
Your trumpet on the water strikes my ear;
I at Vauxhall no other music hear.
When dinner waits, you seize me by the button ;
At table placed, you drive me from my mutton:
From a sweet nap you rouse me by your song.
How much, by this, yourself and me you wrong!
The man of worth, the poet, makes us fly ;
And by your verse we lose your probity.
Hay
You often wonder what the devil Can make the town so damn'd uncivil.
With what indifference they treat you!
There’s not a soul that cares to meet you.
Where’er you come, what consternation !
What universal desolation!
But for the cause-why, must you know it ?
I '11 tell yo 1 ;
" you 're too great a poet;
"
And that’s a thing true Britons fear More than a tiger or a bear ;
Your man of sense, of all God's curses, Dreads nothing like repeating verses.
And really, Tom, you 're past all bearing;
You ’d tire a Dutchman out with hearing.
One must submit :
—there’s no contending ;
You keep one sitting;
keep one standing Got loose, with more than decent speed I trudge away-yet you proceed.
Go where one will, there’s no retreat;
You 're at it still, repeat, repeat.
I flv to " Nando's ”— you are there, Still thundering distichs in one's ear:
Thence to the park-still vou 're as bad;
The ladies think you drunk or mad:
" But come, 't is late, at three we dine ;
”
You stop one with “ a charming line;
Now down we sit;
but lo !
repeating
Is greater joy to you than eating.
Quite tired, I nod, and try to dose ;
In vain—you ’ve murder'd all repose.
But prithee, Tom, repent in time;
You see the sad effect of rhyme (And check this humour, if you can)
That such an honest worthy man, With so much sense, and such good nature, Should be so terrible a creature !
Rev. R. Graves.
That cousins, friends, and strangers fly thee, Nay, thv own sister can't sit nigh thee, That all men thy acquaintance shun, And into holes and corners run, Like Irish beau from English dun, The reason ’s plain ;
and if thou 'dst know it, Thou 'rt a most damn'd repeating poet.
Not bailiff soured with horrid beard
Is more in poor Alsatia fear’d, Since the stern Parliament of late Has stript of ancient rights their state;
Not tigers when their whelps are missing;
Not serpents in the sunshine hissing;
Not snake in tail that carries rattle;
Not fire, nor plague, nor blood, nor battle, Is half so dreaded by the throng, As thy vile persecuting tongue.
If e'er the restless clack that's in it Gives thy head leave to think a minute, Think what a penance we must bear, Thy damn'd impertinence to hear.
Where'er I run, or stand, or sit, Thou still art in th' repeating fit:
Wearied, I seek a nap to take;
But thy cursed muse keeps me awake.
At church too, when the organ ’s blowing, Thy louder pipe is still a-going.
Nor park nor bagnio '& from thee free;
All places are alike to thee.
Learn wisdom once, at a friend's instance, From the two fellows at St Dunstan’s :

But strike, like them, but once a quarter.

I flee from yours, Ligurinus.
It is certainly a splendid one, and well furnished with excellent dishes, but nothing pleases me when you recite.
I do not want you to put upon table turbots or a mullet of two pounds weight, nor do I wish for mushrooms or oysters;
what I want is your silence.
Whether scared Phœbus fled (my Ligurine) Thyestes' feast, I know not;
we fly thine :
Though that thy table's rich and nobly spread, Yet thy sole talk knocks all th' enjoyment dead.

You demand from me, without end, the attentions due from a client.
I go not myself, but send you my freed-man. "
It is not the same," you say.
I will prove that it is much more.
I can scarcely follow your litter, he will carry it.
If you get into a crowd, he will keep it off with his elbow;
my sides are weak, and unsuited to such labour.
Whatever state­ ment you may make in pleading, I should hold my tongue ;
but he will roar out for you the thrice-glorious " bravo ! "
If you have a dispute with any one, he will heap abuse upon your adversary with a stentorian voice;
modesty prevents me from using strong language. "
Well then, will you show me, ” say you, " no attention as my friend ? ”
Yes,
Candi­ dus, every attention which my freedman may be unable to show.
How often do you ask me to go down,
To aid your interest in your borough town ?
I would do all to serve you that I can :
Yet cannot go:
but I will send my man.
You say, 't is not the same;
I '11 prove it more.
I scarce can follow you;
he '11 go before.
Is there a mob P he '11 elbow folks away:
I am infirm, not used to such rough play.
I can't repeat the popular things you say;
He will extol them, more than once a day.
Is there a quarrel ?
he ’ll be very loud:
I am ashamed to bully in a crowd. "
What!
will my friend do nothing, then ? ” say you :
All, that a servant cannot do, I ’ll do.
Yonder, Faustinus, where the Capene Gate drips with large dropsy and where the Almo cleanses the Phrygian sacrificial knives of the Mother of the Gods, where the sacred meadow of the Horatii lies verdant, and where the temple of the Little Hercules swarms with many a visitor, Bassus was taking his way in a well-packed chariot, carrying with him all the riches of a favoured country spot.
There you might have seen cabbages with noble hearts, and both kinds of leeks,' dwarf lettuces, and beet-roots not unserviceable to the tor­ pid stomach.
There also you might have seen an osier ring, hung with fat thrushes;
a hare, pierced by the fangs of a Gallic hound;
and a sucking-pig, that had never yet crush­ ed bean.
Nor did the running footman go idly before the carriage, but bore eggs safely wrapped in hay.
Was Bassus going to town ?
No;
he was going to his country-seat.
2Where the Capenian gate her pool extends, Where to the Phrygian parent Almo bends;
Where the Horatians verdure still the spot;
Where puny Hercules’s fane is hot;
Poor Bassus drove his team, but sang no song;
Lugging the struggling stores of the blest land along.
There coleworts might
Tou see of noblest shoot;
There might admire each lettuce, leek, and root;
But, above all, the deöbstructive beet;
Here a rich frail of fatted thrushes greet;
And here a hare, the cruel hounds could crunch;
With a sow's unwean'd babe, that bean could never munch.
Before the car, behold no idler stray:
Yet one preceded, stuffing eggs in hay.
Was Bassus winding his glad way to town ?
No:
winding his glad way to his dear villa down.

The reason you ask us to dinner, Ligunnus, is no other than this, that you may recite your verses.
I have just put off my shoes,1 when forthwith in comes an immense volume among the lettuces and sharp sauce.
Another is handed, while the first course is lingering on the table:
then conies a third, before even the second course is served.
During a fourth course you recite ;
and again during a fifth
Why, a boar, if so often placed upon table, is unsavoury
If you do not hand over your accursed poems to the mackerel­ sellers, Ligurinus, you will soon dine alone.
The single cause why you invite, Is that your works you may recite.
I hardly had my slippers dropp'd, Nor dream'd the entertainment stopp'd, When, mid the lettuces and salad, Is usher’ d in a bloody ballad.
Then, lo!
another bunch of lays,
While yet the primal service stays.
Another, ere the second course;
A third, and fourth, and fifth you force.
The boar, beroasted now to rags, Appears in vain :
the stomach flags.
The labours, that destroy each dish, Were useful coats for frying fish.

Else you shall sup alone for me.

Indeed, not to fatigue myself with enumerating each of them, I could do without you, Chloe, altogether.
I could resign that eye of blue, However its splendour used to thrill me ;
And ev'n that cheek of roseate hue—
To lose it, Chloe, scarce would kill me.
That snowy neck I ne'er should miss, However much I 've raved about it;
And sweetly as that lip can kiss, I think I could exist without it.
In short, so well I've learn'd to fast, That sooth, my love, I know not whether I might not bring myself at last -To do without you altogether.

Seeing that I cannot give you, Galla, what you ask of me as the price of your favours, it would be much mere simple.

Our friend Faustinus's Baian farm, Bassus, does not occupy an ungrateful expanse of broad land, laid out with useless myrtle groves, sterile plane-trees, and clipped box­ rows, but rejoices in a real unsophisticated country scene.
Here close-pressed heaps of corn are crammed into every corner, and many a cask is redolent with wine of old vint­ ages.
Here, after November, when winter is at hand, the rough vine-dresser brings in the ripened grapes ;
the sa­ vage bulls bellow in the deep valley, and the steer, with forehead still unarmed, yearns for the fight.
The whole muster of the farmyard roams at large, the screaming goose, the spangled peacock, the bird which derives its name from its red wings,2 the spotted partridge, the speckled fowls of Numidia, and the pheasants of the impious Colchiaps the proud cocks caress their Rhodian mates, and the turrets resound with the murmur of pigeons.
On this side mourns the ringdove,on that the wax-coloured turtle-dove;
the greedy swine follow the apron of the bailiff's wife, and the tender lamb bleats after its well-filled mother.
Young house-bred slaves, sleek as milk, surround the cheerful fire, and piles of wood blaze near the joyous Lares.
The steward does not, through inactivity, grow pale with enervating ease, nor waste oil in anointing himself for wrestling,' but sets crafty nets for greedy thrushes, or draws up fish captured with the tremulous line, or brings home deer caught in the hunter’s toils.
The productive garden amuses the well-pleased towns­ men,2 and long-haired children, freed from the rule of their instructor, delight to obey the farm-bailiff, and even the effeminate eunuch finds enjoyment in working.
/
Nor does the rustic come empty-handed to pay his respects ;
he brings with him white honey in its waxen cells, and the conical cheese from the forest of Sassina.
This one offers the sleepy dor­ mouse, that the bleating young of the hairy she-goat;
another,' the capon debarred from loving.
Tall maidens, daughters of honest husbandmen, bring their mothers' presents in baskets of osiers.
Work being over, the cheerful neighbourhood is invited in;
nor does a stinted table reserve its dainties for the morrow, but every one eats his fill, and the well-fed attendant has no cause to envy the reeling guest.
But you, Bassus, possess in the suburbs of the city a splendid mansion, where your visitor is starved, and where, from lofty towers, you look over mere laurels secure in a garden where Priapus need fear no thief.
You feed your vinedresser on corn which you have bought in town, and carry idly to your ornamental farm vegetables, eggs, chickens, fruits, cheese, and wine.
Should your dwelling be called a country-house, or a town-house out of town PAt my Faustinus' country-house there growes
No equal ranked shady myrtle rowes, Or barren plane-trees ;
no boxe-hedges there Cut into various figures doe appeare
To please the eye, engrossing a large field, And nought but an unfruitful prospect yield, But more delights in the true country's dress, In wilder forms affording rich increase.
The barnes and garners there with corne are fill’d t
And fragrant wines the spacious cellars yield ;
There (vintage past) when winter days begin,
The rough vine-dresser latter grapes brings in ;
Fierce bulls low in the vales, and there delight
The wanton calves with budding homes to fright.
The yard all sorts of poultry there mayntaynes ;
Shrill geese, and peacocks with their starry traynes;
The crimson and Numidian birds there nest, Pheasant, and partridge with his speckled breast ;
The lustfull cocks the Rhodian henns there tread, With moaning doves the house-topp's covered ;
The ring-doves in their mournful 1 notes complayne, Which the soft turtles echo back againc ;
The gruntling swine follow the house-wife's feete, The tender lambes for their dam's teats doe bleate;
The milk-fedd clownes begird the shining hearth, And, warm'd with the huge loggs, begin their mirth.
The caterer, nott with ease languishing, Butt, with his paynefull swett, the cates brings in ;
For greedy thrushes with spredd netts hee waytes;
Or angling taketh fishes with his baytes ;
Or deere caught in the toyles he bringeth home.
The merry maydes supply the gardner's roome.
The nicer pages here without command Delight in country-worke to have their hand, And the neate chamberlayne putts in his too.
No farmer there doth empty-handed goe To visit you.
—One honny in the combe, Another curds and creame from his owne home
By th' next wood's side ;
some sleepy dormice give, A kidd, or capons forced chaste to live;
And with their baskets the plumpe girles are sent Their mothers' gifts and service to present.
Harvest being done, neighbours invited, there No dish reserved is for next daye's fare;
All eate their fill;
nor does the wayter curse
The full-fedd, well-drench'd guest, ’cause hee has worse.
You your neate hungry suburbe house may prayse, From your balconies viewing naught butt bayes ;
You no Priapus neede there to preserve Your fruite :
your gardein would your gardner sterve.
When from the city thither you retreate, You must bringe with you (if you meane to eate)
Your sallades, poultry, fruites, cheese, and your wine, Else on your painted viands you must dine.
Is this that thing your country-house you call ?
No.
Tis your cyty-house without the wall.

Seeing that I am invited to dinner, and am no longer, as before, to be bought,2 why is not the same dinner given to me, as to you ?
You partake of oysters fattened in the Lucrine lake;
I tear my lips in sucking at a limpet.
Before you are placed splendid mushrooms;
I help myself to such as are fit only for pigs.
You are provided with a turbot;
I with a sparulus.

The golden turtle-dove fills your stomach with its over-fattened body;
a magpie which died in its cage is set before me.
Why do I dine without you, Ponticus, when I dine with you P Let it be of some profit to me that the spor­ tula exists no longer ;
let us eat of the same dishes.
Me, as a friend, to supper you invite :
Why have we then our supper different quite ?
Colchester oysters you, and mussels I ?
Yours perigord, and mine a mutton pie?
I have no rarities, you eat them up:
Strange!
I should with you and without you sup Came I, to see the king at table, hither ?
If we must eat, pray let us eat together.

Because you purchase slaves at a hundred and often two hundred thousand sesterces ;
because you drink wines stored in the reign of Numa ;
because your not over-large stock of furniture cost you a million;
because a pound weight 01 wrought silver costs you five thousand;
because a golden chariot becomes yours at the price of a whole farm ;
because your mule cost you more than the value of a house ;
-do you imagine that such expenses are the proof of a great mind, Quintus ?
You are mistaken, Quintus;
they are the extra­ vagances of a small mind.
Upon rich liveries no expense you spare Your Rhenish older than the first French war ;
Your little cabinet cost hundreds three, And full as much your little carved settee;
Your gilded coach a moderate estate ;
More than a house your pad is valued at.
Think you you show a soul by this expense ?
A little one it is, and void of sense.
HayMilo, forbear to call him blest
That only boasts a large estate, Should all the treasures of the East Meet, and conspire to make him great.

Cotilus, you are a beau;
so say many, Cotilus, I hear;
but tell me, what is a beau ? "
A. beau is one who arranges his curled locks gracefully, who ever smells of balm, and cinnamon;
who hums the songs of the Nile, and Cadiz ;
who throws his sleek arms into various attitudes ;
who idles away the whole day among the chairs of the ladies, and is ever whispering into some one's ear ;
who reads little billets-doux from this quarter and that, and writes them in return;
who avoids ruffling his dress by contact with his neighbour's sleeve;
who knows with whom everybody is in love ;
who flutters from feast to feast;
who can recount exactly the pe­ digree of Hirpinus."
1 What do you tell me ?
is this a beau, Cotilus ?
Then a beau, Cotilus, is a very trifling thing.
Oh!
Jemmy, you 're a beau!
Not I alone Say this, but t is the talk of all the town.
Prythee be free, and to thy friend impart
What is a beau.
Ay, sir, with all my heart.
He ’s one who nicely curls and combs his hair, And visits Sedgwick monthly all the year;
Sings bawdy songs and hums them, as along Flaunting he walks through the admiring throng ;
All the day long sits with the charming fair, And whispers pretty stories in their ear;
Writes billets-doux, shuns all men as he goes, Lest their unhallow’d touch should daub his clothes;
He knows your mishap ;
nay, at every feast He'll tell the pedigree of every guest.
Is this a beau ?
Faith, Jemmy, I’ll be plain, A beau's a bawble, destitute of brain.
Tom Browns.
They tell me, Cotilus, that you 're a beau:
What this is, Cotilus, I wish to know. "
A beau is one who, with the nicest care, In parted locks divides his curling hair;
One who with balm and cinnamon smells sweet, Whose humming lips some Spanish air repeat;
Whose naked arms are smooth'd with pumice-stone, And toss’d about with graces all his own :
A beau is one who takes his constant seat, From mom to evening, where the ladies meet;
And ever, on some sofa hovering near, Whispers some nothing in some fair one's ear ;
Who scribbles thousand billets-doux a day ;
Still reads and scribbles, reads, and sends away:
A beau is one who shrinks, if nearly press’d
By the coarse garment of a neighbour guest;
Who knows who flirts with whom, and still is found
At each good table in successive round:
A beau is one-none better knows than he A race-horse, and his noble pedigree ”— Indeed ?
Why, Cotilus.
if this be so, What teasing trifling thing is call’d a beau!

The Sirens, those seductive destroyers of mariners with their deceitful blandishments and fatal caresses, whom, once listened to, nobody had before been able to quit, the crafty Ulysses is said to have escaped.
Nor do I wonder at it;
but I should have wondered, Cassianus, bad he escaped from Can i us, 1 when reciting his verses.
The seamen's merry ruin, killing joy, The syrens, who with melody destroy, That sly Ulysses had the power to leave, When all besides, with charms, they did deceive, I wonder not:
but this I should admire, From Canius' fett'ring tongue could he retire.

The perfume, which is exhaled by the apple bitten by a young damsel;
by the zephyr that passes over the saffron-fields of Corycia;
by the vine, when it flowers white with its first clusters ;
by grass just cropped by the sheep;
by the myrtle;
by the Arabian spice-gatherer;
by amber rubbed with the hand;
by the fire pale with eastern frankincense;
by the turf lightly sprinkled with summer showers ;
by the chaplet resting loosely on locks dripping with nard:
all this fra­ grance, cruel Diadumenus, is combined in your kisses.
What would it not be, were you to grant them without grudging ?
As apples smell bitt by a young girle's tooth, Or winde past o'er a field of saffron doth;
As flow'ry vines when their first budds forth peepe, Or fragrant grass new crept by tender sheepe;
As myrtle or the Arabian mowers scent;
Chaft gums, or fumes which spices burnt present:
As furrows gently sprinkled with heat showers, As locks oyled with nard and crown'd with flowers :
So smell thy half-lipp'd kisses, cruel!

If freely giv’n how sweeter much they were!

Antony was guilty of a crime similar to that committed by Pothinits;
either sword cut off a sacred head.
The one, thy head, 0 Rome, when thou wast celebrating with joy laurelled triumphs;
the other, when thou wast displaying thy elo­ quence.
Yet the case of Antony is worse than that of Pothinus;
Pothinus did the deed for his master, Antony for himself.
1Alike great Pompey and sage Tully bled;
Sever alike each venerable head ;
Rome on that head her laurell'd triumphs saw ;
Heard her free voice from this enforce her law.
You, Antony, Pothinus have outdone ;
His was his masters crime ;
but yours your own.
Hay.
You are loitering, sailors, and know nothing of your busi­ ness, more sluggish than Vaternus and Rasina;
2 through whose sleepy waters while you take your way, you just dip your idle oars to measured time.
Already Phaeton is de­ scending, and Æthon 3 is perspiring;
the day has reached its greatest heat, and noon unyokes the tired horses of the hus­ bandman.
But you, floating negligently on the unrippled waters, enjoy your leisure in a sate bark.
You are net sailors, I consider, but Argonauts.
4Why, my lads, more sluggish go, Than Vetrenus or the Po ?
Think ye thro' their still ye steer, Drawling oars, to wait the cheer ?
Phaeton begins to fire :
Æthon, lo! in full perspire.
Now the noontide hour proceeds
To repose the panting steeds.
Ye, serene upon the wave, Sun, and wind, and water brave.
No mere navigators now, Ye are Argonauts, I vow.

Thus far this book is written entirely for you, chaste ma- tron,
Do you ask for whom the sequel is written ?
For my­ self.
The gymnasium, the warm baths, the race-course, are here;
you must retire.
We lay aside our garments;
spare yourself the sight of us in that state.
Here at last, after her wine and crowns of roses, Terpsichore is intoxicated, and, laying aside all restraint, knows not what she says.
She names no longer in doubtful guise, but openly, that deity I whom triumphant Venus welcomes to her temple in the sixth month of the year;
whom the bailiff stations as protector in the midst of his garden, and at whom all modest maidens gaze with hand before the face.
If I know you well, you were laying down the long book from weariness;
now you will read diligently to the end.
To thee, grave matron, hitherto my book I write.
Towards whom, dost ask, the rest doth look ?
Myself, the race, the baths;
retire thou then, We strip, forbear to look on naked men.
Well-soaked, Terpsichore weighs not what she says;
Niceness ’mong cups and roses down she lays ;
And though, without disguise, she plainly names, }
In broadest terms, what yearly Roman dames }
To Venus offer, cares not who her blames ;
}
T is that, I mean, our hinds in gardens place, And maids peep at, with hands before their face.
If now I know thee, though my book before Tired thee, thou'it eager be to read it o'er.
Anon. 1695.
Inasmuch as you write all your epigrams in chaste words, and ribaldry is nowhere to be found in your verses, I admire you, I praise you ;
no human being is more pure than your­ self.
But no page of mine is without freedoms of language.
Mine, then, let sportive youths, easy damsels, and the old man who is tortured by his mistress, read.
But your respect­ able and immaculate writings, Cosconius, must be read only by children and virgins.
That all thy epigrams thou dost indite
In cleanest terms, nor one broad word dost write, I praise, admire;
how chaste alone thou art!
Such crimes my pages show in every part , The which the waggish youth and maids approve, The older, too, who feel the sting of love.
But yet, I must confess, thy holy verse Deserves much more with children to converse.
Anon. 1695.
You, Scævinus, who were recently the husband of Aufidia, are now her gallant;
while he who was your rival is now her husband.
Why should you take pleasure in her, as the wife of your neighbour, who, as your own wife, gave you no plea­ sure ?
Is it that obstacles alone inspire you with ardour ?
Aufidia's now gallant, who wast her lord!
Her lord thy rival, once again abhorr'd!
Why like another's, nor thine own endure ?
Canst feel no fervour, where thou art secure ?

Your slave, Nævolus, is suffering from a disgraceful dis­ ease;
yourself, from one analogous to it.
I am no sorcerer, but I know what you are about.
With the psilothrum 1 you make sleek your face, with the dropax 1 your bald head.
Are you afraid of the barber, Gar­ gilianus ?
How will your nails fare ?2—for certainly you can­ not pare them by means of resin or Venetian clay.
3
Cease, if you have any modesty left, to disgrace your miserable head, Gargilianus :
leave such things for the other sex.
One lotion smugs thy face, and one thy crown.
Dost dread the rasor, or dost hope renown ?
How treat thy talons ?
Them corrode away Nor can fell rosin, nor Venetian clay.
Cease then, and blush t' expose thy barren scull:
One daubs but where one may nor shave nor cull.

Scallions and lose rochets nought prevail, And heightening meats in operation fail;

You are all on fire for old women, Bassus, and look with contempt on young ones ;
and it is not a handsome lady that charms you, but one just on the brink of the tomb.
Is not this, I ask, madness ? is not your desire insane ?
To love a Hecuba, and disdain an Andromache !
Neither mullet, Bæticus, nor turtle-dove delights you;
nor is hare ever acceptable to you, or wild boar.
Nor do sweet­ meats please you, or slices of cake;
nor for you does Libya or Phasis send its birds.
You devour capers and onions swimming in disgusting sauce, and the soft part of a gam­ mon of bacon, whose freshness is disputable ;
and pilchards and tunny, whose flesh is turning white:
you drink wines which taste of the resin seal, and abhor Falernian.
I sus­ pect that there must be some other more secret vice in your stomach :
for why, Bæticus, do you eat disgusting meats ?
1Nor mullet delights thee, nice Betic, nor thrush ;
The hare with the scut, nor the boar with the tush;
No sweet cakes or tablets:
thy taste so absurd, Nor Libya need send thee, nor Phasis, a bird.
But capers, and onions, besoaking in brine, And brawn of a gammon scarce doubtful, are thine.
Of garbage, or flitch of boar tunny, thou 'rt vain:
The rosin’s thy joy, the Falernian thy bane.
I dread thy poor stomach hints some dark abuse :
Else why, Betic, relish alone the refuse ?
Elphinston.
You have emptied your vessel once, Paulinus, while the ship was going at full speed.

He who would consent to be the guest of Zoilus, would not hesitate to sup with the strumpets of the Summœnium,1 and drink, without a blush, from the broken pitcher of Leda.
2
This, I contend, would be both easier and more decent.
Clothed in an effeminate kind of robe, he lies upon a couch which he wholly covers, and, propped up on purple and silk cushions, thrusts aside his guests with his elbows on this side and that.
At hand stands a minion, who hands to his master, ready to vomit, red feathers and toothpicks of lentisc wood;
while, if he is oppressed by the heat, a concubine, reclining by his side, wafts upon him a pleasant coolness with a green fan;
and a young slave scares away the flies with a rod of myrtle.
A softener,1 with nimble art, strokes his whole body, and passes her skilled hand over all his limbs
The signal of snapping his fingers is watched by an eunuch, who presents him with the vessel which his copious draughts render indispensable.
Meanwhile Zoilus himself, leaning backwards to the crowd at his feet, among the pup­ pies who are licking up the giblets of geese, divides among his athletes the neck of a wild-boar, or bestows upon his fa­ vourite the thigh of a turtle-dove;
and while to us is offered wine from Ligurian rocks, or such as has been ripened in the smoke of Marseilles, he hands to his creatures Opimian nectar in crystalline and myrrhine vases;
and, while he himself is drenched with essences from the stores of Cosmus, he is not ashamed to divide amongst us in a little gilt shell, un­ guents such as only the lowest women use.
Finally, over­ come by many draughts from his large cups, he falls snoring asleep.
We sit at the table, and, ordered to keep silence while he is grunting, drink each other's healths by signs.
Such is the insolence which we have to endure from this presum­ ing Malchion;
nor do we ask to be avenged, Rufus.
He has an evil tongue.
2Whoever with a Zoilus' treat can put up, As well at a prostitute's table may sup;
And e'en, while yet sober, were far better off From Leda's lame porringer humbly to quaff.
Behold him betrick'd on the couch he has seized, On either side elbowing that he may be eased;
Supported on purple, and pillows of silk;
The catamite standing, that nothing may bilk.
To Zoilus squeamish his minister lends
The ruddy provokers, and lentisk extends :
And now in a swim while he’s stewing, poor man A lolloping concubine flaps the green fan.
As thus she restores him to regions of light, A minion with myrtle puts insects to flight.
Meantime the bold stroker his person must skim,
And ply her arch palm o'er his each lazy limb.
The fingers, now snapp'd, give the eunuch the sign, My lord has a mind to alembic his wine.
The latter unwearied persisting the filler, The dextrous emasculate guides the distiller.
The treater converts, the repast to complete, His thoughts and his eyes on the crew at his feet;
He duly reflects what to servants he owes, And so to the dogs the goose-giblets he throws.
The kernels, and other nice bits of the boar, He portions to those who have toil'd on his floor:
And, sleek to plump up his most favourite widgeon, He deals the plump thighs of his best potted pigeon.
To us while the rocks of Liguria present, Or fumes of Massilia, their must and their tent;
The nectar Opimian he gives to refine, In crystals and myrrhines, for zanies the wine !
Himself made essential from Cosmus’ first flasks, His guests to accept a few droplings he asks, From out his gold shell scarce sufficing to shed The unguent upon an adulteress' head.
O'erpower'd with deep goblets, sweet Zoil besnores:
And, though we recline, none the musick deplores.
We smile, or we sweat, or we swill, now by nods;
Nor can we revenge-such a feast of the gods !

Who persuaded you to cut off the nose of your wife'a gallant ?
Wretched husband, that was not the part which outraged you.
Fool, what have you done ?
Your wife has lost nothing by the operation, since that which pleased her in your friend Deiphobus is still safe.
Offended lord, what could thee discompose, So cruelly to lop th' offender's nose ?
That suff’ring limb, as thine, was innocent:
Nor feels the paramour the punishment.
Ne'er canst thou hope t' extinguish either fire, While the incendiary remains entire.

I forewarned and admonished you, chaste matron, not to read this part of my sportive book :
and yet, you see, you continue to read.
But if, chaste as you are, you go to see the acting of Panniculus and Latinus, read on ;
these verses are not more shameless than the pantomimes.
I warn'd you, madam, not to read:
But I foretold, and you proceed.
If you indulge to see some plays, You safely may peruse my lays.

Rumour says, Chione, that you have never had to do with man, and that nothing can be purer than yourself.
And yet when you bathe, you veil not that part which you should veil.
If you have any modesty, veil your face.

for you have a face like one suffering from constipation.
Use lettuce limp, emollient mallows gain :
Thy sturdy stare bespeaks a stubborn strain.

When a dismissed veteran, a native of Ravenna, was return­ ing home, he joined on the way a troop of the emasculated priests of Cybele.
There was in close attendance upon him a runaway slave named Achillas, a youth remarkable for his handsome looks and saucy manner.
This was noticed by the effete troop;
and they inquired what part of the couch he occupied.
The youth understood their secret intentions, and gave them false information;
they believed him.
After drinking sufficiently, each retired to his couch;
when forth­ with the malicious crew seized their knives, and mutilated the old man, as he lay on one side of the couch;
while the youth was safe in the protection of the inner recess.
It is said that a stag was once substituted for a virgin;
but in this case something of a different nature was substituted for a stag.
2
When old Misitius sought his native land, Chance bid him join a sly Cybelian band.
Achillas, from his lord a slipp'ry stray, Adhered the partner of Misitius' way.
Him eye the half-men;
and their art employ, To learn the lair that hopes the beauteous boy.
Suspecting well their aim to catch such elves,
And render them enervate as themselves, Their industry industrious to deride, The pricket points the bed ;
but not the side.
They quaff their wine, and now the slumbers please.
The slumbers o'er, the noxious steel they seize.
Misitius they unman, who next them lay;
Safe on the inner beam, and snug, the stray.
Once, for a virgin, bled a wond'rous hind:
Now, for a deer, a dotard was consigned.

Though you have seen three hundred consuls, Vetustilla, and have but three hairs, and four teeth, with the chest of a grasshopper, and the legs of an ant;
though your forehead shows more folds than a matron's dress, and your bosom resembles a spider's web;
though in comparison with your vast jaws the mouth of crocodile of the Nile is small;
though the frogs at Ravenna chatter more melodiously than you, and the gnat of Atria sings more sweetly;
though your eyesight is no better than the owl's in the morning, and your body exhales the odour of the husband of the she-goat;
though your loins are those of a lean duck, and your legs shrunk like those of a withered old Cynic ;
though the bath­ keeper does not admit you into the bath till he has ex­ tinguished his light, and then only among the prostitutes that lodgeir the tombs;
though it is winter with you even in the mor August, and not even a pestilent fever can unfreeze you, you nevertheless dare to think of marriage after two hundred years of widowhood, and insanely expect somebody to fall in love with relics like yours.
Who, I ask, even if he were willing to till a rock, would call you wife?—you whom Philomelus but recently called grand- mother.
But if you will have your corpse meddled with, let Coris the grave-digger prepare you a couch, such as alone befits your nuptial rites, and let the kindler of the funeral pile bear the marriage torches for the new bride.
Such a torch is the only one that Hymen can offer you.
Alert Antiquilla, on thee Kind consuls three hundred have smiled:
What beauties remain, let us see, Of one but so lately a child.
Three hairs, and four teeth, are the dwindle Fell Chronus allows thy command:
Thy grasshopper breast on a spindle
As fine as an antling's can stand.
Thv forehead more furrows has made, Than any high dame in her stole:
Thv panters, unpropt, are decay'd to nets of Arachne's controLThink not thai search for thy flaws ;
Too mean a pursuit to be mine!
But narrow the crocodile's jaws, Compared, Antiquilla, with thine.
Ravenna's brisk froglings becroke Less hoarse, my gruff crony, than than ;
And Adria's high hornets invoke A hum thou canst hardly avow.
Thine eyes are as clear as thy notes:
Thou seest as the owl in the morn.
Thou smell'st like the lord of the goats:
Compare of each kind is thy scorn.
But now, to descend to the stump:
What gives an old cynic to rage, Emaciate duck, is thy rump ;
And bony the war he must wage.
The bather will blow out his lamp, To thee ere he open his doors ;
Then, careless of age, or of stamp, Admit all the bustuary whores.
Bland August thy winter we know:
Insatiate must still be thy maw?
Ah !
how can poor Hymen e'er glow, Where pestilence' self cannot thaw PThou only two hundred hast slain, And would'st the third century wed:
Would'st have a man, madding in vain, Attend thy cold ashes to bed ?
Yet.
wish'd he to harrow a stone, Who'd honour such mate as a wife P Whom call'd Philomelus a crone, Who'd e'er call the love of his life PBut, scraped if thy carcase must be, Coricles the clinic shall strow The couch :
he alone can agree With thy hymenean to go.
The burner the torches shall bear, Before the desirable bride:
A torch can alone enter there ;
Where Pluto himself will preside.

You never say, " Good day!" first, Nævolus:
but content yourself with returning the salute, though even the crow is often in the habit of saying it first.
Why do you expect this from me, Nævolus P I pray you, tell me.
For I consider, Nævolus, you are neither better than I am, nor have pre­ cedence of me in the eyes of the world.
Both Cæsars have bestowed upon me praise and rewards, and have given me the rights of a father of three children.
I am read by many;
and fame has given me a name known throughout the cities of the earth, without waiting for my death.
There is some­ thing, too, in this, that Rome has seen me a tribune, and that I sit in those seats whence Oceanus 1 excludes you.
I sus­ pect that your servants are not even as numerous as the Roman citizens that Cæssr has made at my request.
But you arc a debauchee, Nævolus, and play your part excel­ lently in that capacity.
Yes, now you take precedence or me, Nævolus ;
you have decidedly the advantage.
Good day to you.
Nævolus ne'er salutes first, but replies, Which the taught crow himself seldom denies.
Why dost expect this from me, Ncevolus ?
Since thou art not more great nor good than us P Both Cæsars have rewarded my due praise, And me to th' priv'lege of three sons did raise.
I 'm read by every mouth, known through the town,
And before death receive my quick renown.
And this is worth your note, I 'm tribune too, And sit where that Oceanus caps you;
How many by great Cæsar's grant are made Free denizens because by me 'twas pray'd P The number far exceeds thy family:
But thou shock'st nature, Nævolus, feed'st high:
Now, now thou over-com'st me sheere;
thus, thus, Thou art my better.
Salve, Nævolus.
Fletcher,I advise you, Rufus, not to let Cbione read this little book of mine.
She is hurt by my verses:
and she may hurt me in return.
Let not Snow, my dear friend, chill this bundle of spirt.
If she thaw by my fire, in her turn she may hurt.
Elphinston.
You ought not, cobbler, to be angry with my book;
your trade, and not your life, is satirized in my writings.
Allow me innocent pleasantries.
Why should I not have the right of amusing myself, if you have bad that of getting throats cut ?
Why art offended, Cerdo, with my book ?
Thy life, and not thy person, 's by me strook.
Then suffer harmless wit;
why is't not due For me to sport, when stabbing 's free to you ?
Fletcher.
It was twelve o'clock, Rufus, when I sent the messenger to you, and, I suppose, he must have been wet through when he handed you my verses.
For it happened that the sky was pouring down floods of rain.
This was exactly the weather in which it was proper for the book to be sent.
2I hied thee, my Rufus, a runner at six, Who, soak'd to the skin, would my glories present, While heav'n deign'd her torrents most copious to mix :
No other so proper way could they be sent.

O AUSPICIOUS birth-day of Cæsar,1 more sacred than that on which the conscious Ida witnessed the birth of Dic­ tæan Jupiter, come, I pray, and prolong thy duration beyond the age of Pylian Nestor, and shine ever with thy present aspect or with increased brilliancy.
Let Cæsar, decked with abundance of gold, sacrifice to Minerva on the Alban mount, and let many an oak-garland pass through his im­ perial bands.
Let him welcome the approaching secular games with magnificent sacrifices, and celebrate the solem­ nities due to Romulean Tarentus.
2
We ask indeed great things, 0 ye gods, but such as are due to earth ;
since for so great a god as Cæsar what prayers can be extravagant ?
Cæsar's bright birth-day's to be honoured more Than Jove's, on Ida's top by Rhea bore.
May
Rome this day's return more often see, Than, aged Nestor, thine was seen by thee, And, than the present, still more glorious be.
May he on earth (his head adorn'a with gold) Keep Pallas' feast;
as president behold
The poet's and the rhetor's strife, and crown With 's mighty hand the highest in renown.
May he the secular games, none twice e'er saw, Behold ;
be privileged beyond nature's law.
Great things I ask, but which from heaven are due;
For such a prince too much we cannot sue.
Anon.
1695,Horatius, a little while ago, was the only one, among all the spectators of the games, who appeared in black clothes, when the plebeians, the knights, and the senate, with their sa­ cred chief, were sitting in white array.
Suddenly snow fell in great abundance;
and Horatius became a spectator in white.
1Horace, mid the jovial crew, Saw the show in sable hue.
Third, and next, and first estate, With the chief all candid sate.
Sudden burst the flaky snow :
Horace saw, in white, the show.

See how thick a fleece of silent congealed water flows down upon the face and robes of Cæsar.
Still he pardons Jupiter for sending it, and, with head unmoved, smiles at the waters condensed by the sluggish cold, being accustomed to brave the constellation of the Northern Boötes, and to disregard the Great Bear drenching his locks.
2
Who can be sporting with the dried waters and gambolling in the sky ?
I suspect this snow came from Cæsaris little son.
1See the fleece of silent wave Play on Cesar's face and vest!
See him smile, as bland as brave, At the slow-congealing jest.
Once he could Boötes tire, Helice might soak his hair.
Who thus dry upon the fire ?
It must be the ravish'd heir.

What do you, Fabianus, an honest and poor man, sincere in speech and in heart, expect from visiting the City ?
You can neither be a pander nor a parasite, nor, with your monotonous voice, a crier, to call up persons trembling under accusation:
nor can you corrupt the wife of your dear friend, nor feel any desire after frozen old women, nor sell empty smoke about the palace;
2 nor award praise to Canus, or to Glaphyrus.3
How then, unhappy main, will you live ? “ I am a trustworthy person, a faithful friend."
That is nothing at all:
it would never make you a Philomelus.
Honest and poor, faithful in word and thought, What hath thee, Fabian, to the city brought ?
Thou neither the buffoon nor bawd canst play;
Nor with false whispers th' innocent betray;
Nor corrupt wives ;
nor from rich beldams get A living by thy industry and sweat;
Nor with vain promises and projects chests
Nor bribe nor flatter any of the great.
But you 're a man of learning, prudent, just;
A man of courage, firm, and fit for trust.
Why, you may stay, and live unenvied here;
But (faith) go back, and keep you where you were.

You wish to be thought, Malisianus, as chaste as a mo­ dest virgin, and as innocent as a child, although you are more abandoned than he who recites in the house of Stella' poems composed in the metre of Tibullus.

That ever blandly blushed or smiled ?
When all the while you conscious are Of sentiments corrupter far Than he, who wakes a Stella's ire By waking a Tibullus' lyre.

Why do you refuse, youthful Hyllus, to-day, what you freely gave yesterday ?
Why are you so suddenly become cruel, who but now were so kind ?
You now excuse yourself on account of your beard, and your age, and your hairy limbs.
O night, how long hast thou been, that hast made a youth into an old man !
Why do you mock me, Hyllus ?
You were yesterday a boy ;
tell me, how are you to-day a man ?
Why, how now, Hyllus, child, To yield make such a sputter!
Who wast before so mild, Nor ventur'dst once to mutter ?
Thy beard, thv bristles, years, Thou scruplest not attesting:
How long one night appears, That shoots a sage clandestine!
But yesterday a boy, Why brave us with thy treason ?
To-day thy pow'rs employ, To prove the man of reason.

The first and second hours of the day 1 exhaust the clients who pay their respects to their patrons ;
the third exercises the lungs of the noisy pleaders;
until the fifth Rome employs herself in various occupations;
the sixth brings rest to the fatigued;
the seventh closes the day's labours.
The eighth suffices for the games of the oily palæstra;
the ninth bids us press the piled-up couches at table.
The tenth is the hour for my effusions, Euphemus, when your skill is preparing ambrosial delicacies, and our excellent Cæsar relaxes his cares with celestial nectar, and holds the little cups in his powerful hand.
At that time give my pleasantries access to him ;
my muse with her free step fears to approach Jupiter in the morning.
The two first hours o' th' great consumed are;
The third in lawyers' pleadings at the bar;
The trades of Rome the fourth and fifth employ, The sixth some rest, the seventh all rest enjoy:
From eight to nine in exercise is spent,
The ninth on feasting all men are intent:
The tenth hour's proper for my book and me.
And, Euphem, thou who dost the board o'ersee, And order our great lord's ambrosial fare, When nectar has dissolved his public care, His mighty hand the sober cup does hold, To introduce my mirth, thou may'st be bold.
My muse forbears licentiously to rove I' th' mom, when serious, to importune Jove.

While my book is yet new and unpolished,3 while the page scarcely dry fears to be touched, go, boy, and bear the little present to a dear friend, who deserves beyond all others to have the first sight of my trifles.
Run, but not without being duly equipped;
let a Carthaginian sponge accompany the book ;
for it is a suitable addition to my present.
Many erasures, Faustinus, would not remove all its faults;
one sponging would.
Whiles that my book is new and rough, and feares
To have its undryed page took by the ears, Goe, boy, present this small gift to my friend, He that deserves ray toys at the first end:

While, puffed up beyond measure by an empty name, you were entranced with delight, and were ashamed, unfortunate man, of being merely Saturninus,1 you stirred up war under the Parrhasian Bear, like he who bore arms for his Egyptian consort.
Had you so entirely forgotten the ill-fortune of that name, which the fierce rage of the sea at Actium over­ whelmed ?
Or did the Rhine promise you what the Nile denied to him, and were the northern waters likely to be more propitious ?
Even Antony fell by our arms, who, compared with you, traitor, was a Cæsar.
White thou wert proud to bear Antonius' name, And that of Saturninus didst disclaim ;
Thou arms in Germany 'gainst Cæsar bore, As Antony in Egypt did before.
What Fate attends that name didst thou not fear?
Of his disgrace at Actium never hear?
Or did the Rhine promise success to thee, Tho' Nile to him deny'd the victory ?
That famous Antony by Rome's sword did fall;
Compared to thee, whom Cæsar we might call.

FletcherClaudia Peregrina, Rufus, is about to be married to my friend Pudens.
Be propitious, Hymen, with thy torches.

In after years may the wife cherish her husband in his old age;

Strange, Claudia 's married to a friend of mine.
O Hymen, be thou ready with thy pine!
Thus the rare cinnamons with the spicknard joyne, And the Thesean sweets with Massick wine.

Silius, glory of the Castalian sisters, who exposest, in mighty song, the perjuries of barbaric rage, and compellest the perfidious pride of Hannibal and the faithless Car­ thaginians to yield to our great Scipios;
lay aside for a while thy austere gravity, and while December, sporting with attractive games, resounds on every side with the boxes of hazard, and plays at tropa with fraudulent dice,1 accord some indulgence to my muse, and read not with severe but with cheerful countenance my little books, abounding with jocular pleasantries.
Just so perhaps might the tender Catullus venture to send his sparrow to the great VirgilO thou, whose strains in loftiest style (0 Silius, glory of the Nine !)
Tell barbarous warfare's varied wile, Hannibal's ever new design ;
And paint the Scipios in the field, Where Carthage false was forced to yield,Awhile your grandeur put away ;
December now, with rattling dice Cast from the doubtful box, is gay ;
And Popa 2 plied his false device ;
'T is now an easy festive time
That well befits my careless rhyme.

For thus, perchance, his sparrow's praise Catullus, whom sweet strains attend, To mighty Maro dared to send.

When you asked me yesterday for the loan of a thousand sesterces, Cæcilianus, for six or seven days, I said, " I have not so much."
But, on the pretence of a friend's arrival, you now ask me for a dish and some vases.

Just where the gate near the portico of Agrippa is always dripping with water,1 and the slippery pavement is wet with constant showers, a mass of water, congealed by winter's cold, fell upon the neck of a youth who was entering the damp temple, and, when it had inflicted a cruel death on the un­ fortunate boy, the weapon melted in the warm wound it had made.
What cruelties does not Fortune permit?
Or where is not death to be found, if your, waters, turn cut-throats.

I send you a foreign cloak, the stout workmanship of a Gallic weaver, which, though of a barbarous country, has a Lacedæmonian name;
1 a gift of small value, but not to be despised in cold December.
Whether you are rubbing into your skin the clammy wrestler's oil, or playing at tennis to warm you;
whether you are catching the dusty ball with your hand, or sharing with your competitors the featherlike weight of the loose bladder,2 or seeking to surpass the light Athas 3 in the race, this will be a defence to you, that the searching cold may not affect your wet limbs, or unpropitious Iris oppress you with sudden rain.
Clad in this gift, you will laugh at winds and showers;
nor will you be equally safe in Tyrian silk.
The frowsy foster of a female hand, Of name Laconian, from a barb'rous land;
Tho' rude, yet welcome to December's snow:
To thee we bid the homely stranger go.
Whether in limber liniment thou toil, Or in the Trigonal thy fibres boil;
Whether thy hand the dusty Harpast snatch, Or the Wind-bomb thy flying foot shall catch:
Whether the nimble Athas thou 'd'st outrun;
Or dare the bravest feat, that braves the sun:
That into glowing limbs no cold may glide, That baleful Iris never drench thy pride ;
This fence shall bid thee scorn the winds and showers.
The Tyrian lawn pretends no equal powers.

Cleopatra, after having submitted to the first embrace of love, and requiring to be soothed by her husband, plunged into a glittering pool, flying from his embrace ;
but the wave betrayed her in her hiding-place;
and she shone through the water though wholly covered by it.
Thus lilies are distinctly seen through pure glass, and clear crystal does not allow roses to be hidden.
I leaped in, and, plunging be­ neath the waves, snatched struggling kisses;
more was for­ bidden by the transparent flood.
The virgin danger passed, the bride enraged, Sweet Cleopatra, to be disengaged, And scare mine arms, dives in the baths most clear:
But the kind waters soon betrayed her there, For though thus hid her glories did appear, Like to soft lilies in a crystal grave, Or roses closed in gems no cover have.
With that I dived, and cropped the struggling kisses, Ye, glittering streams, forbade the other blisses.

The number of my books, dear Pudens, forms an objection to them;
the ever-recurring toil fatigues and satiates the reader.
Rarity gives a charm:
thus early fruits are most esteemed;
thus winter roses obtain a higher price ;
thus coy­ ness sets off an extravagant mistress;
and a door ever open attracts no young suitor.
Persius is oftener noticed on ac­ count of one book, than the empty Marsus for the whole of his Amazonid.
For yourself, when you are reading any one of ray little books, imagine it to be the only one ;

Withdraw, fisherman, I warn you, far from the Baian lake, fly, that you may not retire with guilt on your head.
These waters are inhabited by sacred fish, who know their sovereign, and lick his hand, a hand than which the world contains nothing more powerful.
They even have each its name, and each comes up at the voice of its master when called.
Once, in this deep pool, as an impious Libyan was drawing up his prey with quivering rod, he was suddenly struck with blindness, and unable to see the captured fish;
and now, abhorring his sacrilegious hooks, he sits a beggar on the banks of the Baian lake.
1
But do you withdraw while you may, and while you are yet innocent, casting into the waters only harm­ less morsels of food, and respecting the tender fish.
From the Baian lake, with awe, Angler, I advise, withdraw:
Lest, of hallow'd blood unspilt
Thou shouldst rash incur the guilt.
Sacred fishes, swimming bland, Hail their lord, and lick his hand':
Hand whose greater cannot wave, Or to sacrifice or save.
Name respective know they all, And attend their masters call.
Once a Libyan rued the deed,
When he play'd the trembling reed.
Sudden light his eyes forsook, Nor displayed the fish he took.
Now he well the hook may hate, Clothed with so dire a bait;
Where be, by the Baian pool, Sits a blinded begging fool.
Then, dear angler, still by law Innocent, do thou withdraw.
Throwing first a simple dish, Venerate devoted fish.

As to your desire to be named and read of in my books, and your belief that it would be something of an honour to you, may I be confounded, if your wish is not most agree­ able to me;
and I am most anxious to give you a place in my verse.
But you have a name imposed upon you un­ favourable to the inspiration of the Muses;
a name which a barbarous mother gave you, and which neither Melpomene, nor Polyhymnia, nor pious Calliope, nor Phœbus, could pro­ nounce.
Adopt, then, some name which is acceptable to the Muses;
" Hippodamus" can never be introduced with good effect.
1Cause thou desirest to be read and named
So in my books, as by it to be famed, Let me not live the thing much pleases me, And in my lines I would insert thee free, But that thy name is so averse to all The Muses, which thy mother did thee call, Which nor Melpom'ne nor Polymnia may, Nor sweet Calliope with Phœbus say.
Adopt thee then some grateful name to us;
How wretchedly this sounds!

You have bought up all sorts of silver plate;
you alone possess the old masterpieces of Myro, and the handiwork of Praxiteles and Scopas;
you alone have the productions of Phidias' graver, and the labours of Mentor.
Nor are genuine Gratiuses I wanting in your collection, nor vases inlaid with Callaic1 gold, nor embossed ones from the tables of your ancestors.
Yet, amidst all your silver, I wonder, Charinus, that you possess none pure.
2Charinus, thou 'st a rare collection made
Of silver works, both massy and o'erlaid Alone dost Myron's, Scopas' pieces show, What Mentor and Praxiteles could do ;
Alone dost Phidias' noble gravings vaunt, Alone the true Gratianus dost not want;
Enchased goblets of pure Spanish ore, All double gilt, thy fathers table bore.
What's in these wonders to be wonder'd most, A penny current-coin thou canst not boast.
Anon. 1695.
Wrought, graved, emboss'd, of old and modem date, In the best taste, how great your stock of plate !
Here Phidias, there Praxiteles doth stand :
Here the sole piece, that's left, of Mentor's hand.
This cistern did a Jerningham invent:
That bowl and cup were both design'd by Kent.
'Mongst all the things where art and fancy join, I wonder you no silver have in coin.

When the halls of the Pisos, and the thrice-illustrious house of the learned Seneca, were displaying long lines of pedigrees, I preferred you, Postumus, to all such high per­ sonages ;
you were poor and but a knight, but to me you were a consul.
With you, Postumus, I counted thirty winters;
we had one couch in common between us.
Now, full of honours, and rolling in wealth, you can give, you can lavish.
I am waiting, Postumus, to see what you will do for me.
You do nothing;
and it is late for me to look about for another patron.
Is this, Fortune, your act ?
Postumus has imposed upon me.
Though Piso's stem speaks great nobility, Seneca shows a threefold pedigree, And both their courts to my access are free ;
Yet my salutes to thee I first did bring, Poor, and a knight, but unto me a king:
Ten years, twice told, in amity we led, One table served us, and one common bed.
Thou 'rt noble now and rich, canst throw away ;
What to our ancient friendship wilt thou pay ?
I may expect:
but thou hast nought to say.
Grown old, a patron I can't seek, though poor
On me, or faith, hast thou imposed more ?

If any one could possibly grant my wishes, hear, Flaccus' what sort of favourite I would desire.
The youth should, first, be born on the banks of the Nile;
no land knows better how to bestow attractions.
Let him be whiter than snow ;
for in dusky Egypt that colour is more beauteous, as more rare.
Let his eyes rival the stars, and his floating locks play upon his neck;
I do not love, Flaccus, carefully arranged locks.
Let his forehead be small, and his nose slightly aquiline;
and let his lips rival Pæstan roses in redness.
Let him often seek my caresses when I refuse them;
refuse his when I seek them;
and let him be often more sportive than his master.
Let him be jealous of other youths, and ever keep young damsels at a distance;
and, while a man to all else, let him be a youth to me alone. " I understand," say you;
" you do not deceive me ;
for I can testify that your description is exact.
Such was my Amazonicus.
"If I could such obtain, as I desire, Hear then what beauty, Flaccus, I admire.
One born in Egypt, i' th' first place, I'd choose, Such artificial charms none else do use:
I'd have her skin white as the driven snow,— From that swarth clime the fair do fairest show ;
Her eyes with stars should vie, her flowing hair Fall on her neck, which I to curls prefer;
Her forehead should be smooth, well shaped her nose, Her lovely lips a rosy red disclose;
Sometimes I d have her kind, and sometimes coy, In no man's courtship, but mine own, to joy;
Young men to hate, ev'n her own sex to fear;
To others ice, to me a maid appear.
Now, Flaccus, I foreknow what thou wilt say.
Cælia, my Cælia, thou dost here display.
Anon. 1G95.
I did not call you, Coracinus, an unnatural debauchee;
I am not so rash or daring;
nor am I a person to utter false­ hoods willingly.
If I so spoke of you, Coracinus, may I find the flagon of Pontia and the cup of Metilus I hostile to me;
I swear to you by the extravagance and madness of the rites of Isis and Cybele.
What I said, however, was of a light and trifling nature,-a something well known, and which you yourself will not deny;
I said, Coracinus, that you are strangely fond of the female sex.
This is Vesuvius, lately green with umbrageous vines ;
here the noble grape had pressed the dripping coolers.
These are the heights which Bacchus loved more than the hills of Nysa;
on this mountain the satyrs recently danced.
This was the abode of Venus, more grateful to her than Lacedaemon ;
this was the place renowned by the divinity of Hercules.
2
All now lies buried in flames and find ashes.
Even the gods would have wished not to have had the power to cause such a catas­ trophe.
2Vesuvius, shaded once with greenest vines,
Where pressed grapes did yield the noblest wines;
Which hill far more than Nysa Bacchus lov'd, Where satyrs once in mirthfull dances mov'd, Where Venus dwelt, and better lov'd the place Than Sparta, where Alcides temple was, Is now burnt downe, rak'd up in ashes sad.
The gods are grill'd that such great power they had.
May.
Vesuvius, covered with the fruitful vine, Here nourished once, and ran with floods of wine:
Here Bacchus oft to the cool shades retired, And his own native Nysa less admired:
Oft to the mountain's airy tops advanced, The frisking Satyrs on the summits danced:
Alcides here, here Venus, graced the shore, Nor loved her favourite Lacedæmon more.
Now piles of ashes, spreading all around
In undistinguish'd heaps, deform the ground :
The gods themselves the ruined seats bemoan, And blame the mischiefs that themselves have done.

To thee, Phœbus, Parthenius, the chamberlain of Domitian makes these offerings, in behalf of his son Burrus, joyfully and with full censer;
that he, who this day marks his first five years by entering a second lustrum, may live many Olym­ piads of years.
Grant accomplishment to the prayers of a father;
so may thy Daphne delight in thee, and thy sister rejoice in unspotted virginity;
so mayst thou glory in per­ petual youth;
so may Bacchus never possess, Phoebus, locks as long as thine.
Accept, great Apollo, the censer of joy, Parthenius the Palatine lights for his boy;
That Burrus, who hails his first lustre complete, Olympiads unnumber'd of glory may greet.
Oh, sanction the vow:
so be loved by thy tree;
So guard thy fair sister virginity's glee;
So bloom thou perennial, with radiance divine ;
Not Bromius' own head boasting honours like thine.

The Saturnalia have made Sabellus a rich man.
1 Justly does Sabellus swell with pride, and think and say that there is no one among the lawyers better off than himself.
All these airs, and all this exultation, are excited in Sabellus by half a peck of meal, and as much of parched beans ;
by three half pounds of frankincense, and as many of pepper;
by a sausage from Lucania, and a sow's paunch from Falerii;
by a Syrian flagon of dark mulled wine, and some figs candied in a Libyan jar, accompanied with onions, and shell-fish, and cheese.
From a Picenian client, too, came a little chest that would scarcely hold a few olives, and a nest of seven cups from Saguntum, polished with the potter's rude graver, the clay workmanship of a Spanish wheel,1 and a napkin va­ riegated with the laticlave.
More profitable Saturnalia Sa­ bellus has not had these ten years.
Of Satumian joys a Sabellus may tell, And display the new ricbes that give him to swell.
He may think, 'mid the pleaders, and safely declare
That himself is most blessed beyond a compare.
Say, my Muse, what makes Belly so proud and so vain ?
Of split beans half a peck, half a bushel of grain ;
Of frankincense and pepper, thrice half a pound stanch;
A Lucanian sausage, Faliscian panch;
Or of deep must decocted a Syrian flask;
Superfine candied figs, a fair Libyan cask;
With some scallions, perwinkles, some choicest of cheese;
And whatever a high-pamper'd palate can please.
Nor, amid Saturnalian boons, be forgot Of old half-shrivell'd olives, no overgrown pot:
Nay, of crockery smooth!

Though his plate burnish neither the silver nor steel, 'T is the well-temper'd clay of a good Spanish wheeL
On a board so supplied universally spread, With a cloth of broad border, white striving with red.

He knows not, Flaccus, believe me, what Epigrams really are, who calls them mere trifles and frivolities.
He is much more frivolous, who writes of the feast of the cruel Tereus;
or the banquet of the unnatural Thyestes;
or of Dædalus fitting melting wings to his son's body ;
or of Polyphemus feeding his Sicilian flocks.
From my effusions all tumid ranting is ex­ cluded ;
nor does my Muse swell with the mad garment of Tragedy. "
But everything written in such a style is praised, admired, and adored by all."
I admit it.
things in that style are praised;
but mine are read.
Thou know'st not, trust me, what are Epigrams, Flaccus, who think'st them jests and wanton games.
He wantons more, who writes what horrid meat
The plagu'd Thyestes and vex'd Tereus eat, Or Dædalus fitting his boy to fly, Or Polyphemus' flocks in Sicily.
My booke no windy words nor turgid needes, Nor swells my Muse with mad smothurnal weedes.
Yet those things all men praise, admire, adore.
True ;
they praise those, but read these poems more.
May.
You little know what Epigram contains, Who deem it but a jest in jocund strains.
He rather jokes, who writes what horrid meat
The plagued Thyestes and vex'd Tereus eat;
Or tells who robed the boy with melting wings;
Or of the shepherd Polyphemus sings.
Our muse disdains by fustian to excel, By rant to rattle, or in buskins swell.
Though turgid themes all men admire, adore, Be well assured they read my poems more.

When you had not six thousand sesterces, Cæcilianus, you used to be carried about ostentatiously in a vast litter borne by six men.
But since the blind goddess has given you two millions, and your coins have overflowed your coffers, behold you have taken to go on foot.
What prayers ought I to offer on your behalf for such merit, such praise-worthy modesty?
May the gods restore you, Cæcilianus, your litter!
When six thousand, Cæcilian, exceeded thy store, Thee to bus'ness or pleasure six huge fellows bore.
When her thousands twice ten the blind goddess bestow'd,
And thy coin burst the budget, thy foot took the road.
For a merit so modest, what wish can be fair ?
May the gods, poor Cæcilian, restore thee thy chair!

Yonder person, Cosmus, whom you often see in the recesses of the temple of our Pallas, and on the threshold of the new temple,2—an old man with a stick and a wallet;
whose hair bristles white and dirty, and over whose breast a filthy beard descends;
whom a wax-coloured cloak, sole partner of his bare bed, covers ;
and to whom the crowd that encounters him gives food forced from them by his impor­ tunity,—him, I say, you take for a Cynic, but you are deceived by a false appearance;
he is no Cynic, Cosmus.
What then ?-a dog.3
He who i' th temples you so often meet, In public porches, Cosmos, and the street, With bag and staff, nasty, and antique dressed, His hair an end, beard hanging down his breast;
Who, for a cloak, a coverlet does use;
Barks for his meat, the givers of t' abuse;
A Cynic to be thought does make this stir :
But he no Cynic is.

O Collinus, to whom it has been granted to obtain the crown of oak in the Capitol,' and to surround thy deserving locks with its foliage first of all thy race, make the most, if thou art wise, of every day, and always imagine that thy last is come.
No one ever succeeded in moving the three wool-spinning sisters;
* they observe rigidly the day which they have fixed.
Though thou be richer than Crispus, more firm-minded than Thrasea's self, more magnificent than the splendid Melior, Lachesis adds nothing to the thread;
she unwinds the spindles of her sisters, and one of the three always puts a stop to the prolongation of it.
You, whom your country’s honours high do raise, And crown with merited but early praise;
If you are wise, make use of every hour, And never think another in your power.
No man could ever soften cruel fate;
But what that once decrees must be our date.
Were you polite as Sidney, or as great, Had Cato’s soul, or Marlborough's estate, Still is life's line by the three sisters sped:
Not one prolongs, but one still cuts, the thread.

O Lucius,3 glory of thy age, who dost not allow old Gaius 4 and our Tagus to yield the palm to eloquent Arpi,5 let him who has been born among the cities of Greece sing of Thebes or Mycenæ in his lay, or famous Rhodes, or the Ledæan palæstræ1 of licentious2 Lacedæmon.
For us, born among the Celts and Spaniards, let us not be ashamed of repeating in grateful verse the harsher names of our own land;
Bilbilis, renowned for its mines of cruel iron, a town which surpasses in this respect the Chalybes and the Norici;
Platea, resounding with the working of its own steel, a town which the river Salo, that tempers arms, surrounds with shal­ low but unquiet waters;
Tutela;
the dances of Rixamæ ;
the joyful festivities of Cardua;
Peterus, red with intertwined roses;
Rigæ, and its ancient theatres constructed by our ancestors;
the Silai, unerring in the use of the light dart;
the lakes of Turgontus and Perusia;
the pure waters of the humble Vetonissa;
the sacred oak-grove of radon, through which even the tired traveller walks;
* and the fields of the vale of Vativesca, which Manlius tills with lusty steers.
Do these rough names excite a smile, fastidious reader ?
Smile, if you please;
I prefer them, rough as they are, to Butunti.
4Lucius, thou glory of thy times, Who, by th' enchantment of thy rhymes, Nor lett'st old Gaius quit the field, Nor Tagus’ praise to Arpi's yield :
By bards, 'mid Argive cities sprung, Be Thebes or great Mycenæ sung;
Or Rhodes renown'd, or Leda's schools, Where lustful Lacedæmon rules.
From Celts and bold Iberians, we Shall twang the stubborn names with glee;
Nor deem it shame, in duteous verse, Parental honours to rehearse.
Be thou, my Bilbilis, proclaim’d, For might of savage metal famed.
Nor Chalybs nor Noricians try With thy superior sons to vie.
Hark!
how thy Platea's blows astound
The echoes, with her iron-sound!
Her Salo locks, the lord of arms, With gentle grasp, but potent charms.
Tutela, come ;
and bring along
The Ilixamars, with dance and sing The Carduans, with their festal joys;
And Peteros, who never cloys, As blushing still with wattled rose;
And Rigæ, seat of ancient shows.
Silaans, sure with slender shaft;
Ye gladdest lakes, that ever laugh'd !
Both Turgens and Petusia, hear :
Ye rills, who, ravishing the ear Of little Vetonissa, rove ;
And Baradon's holm-hallow* d grove, Where Sloth herself would ceaseless stray, Nor lose her patience, or her way.
But never shall the Muse forget
The winding vales, unequalled yet, That Matinessa’s toil endears To Manlius, by her sturdy steers.
Nice reader, at each rustic name, Thy stomach stirring, not thy blame, Thou laugh'st;
laugh on:
still be they mine, And be the sweet Bitunti thine.

Do you wish me, Gargilinnus, because you send large pre- Bents to old men and widows, to call you munificent P
There is nothing on earth more sordid or meaner than you are, who call your snares gifts.
In like manner is the guileful hook bountiful to fishes, and the crafty bait a boon to the silly inhabitants of the forests.
What the difference is between giving liberally, and making such presents, I will teach you, if you do not know.
Make them, Gargilianus, to me.
Gifts t’ old rich men thou send’st, and widows all, Yet would'st be thought, Gargilian, liberall.
There’s nought more sordid, nought more base than thee, To call thy snares a liberalitie.
So to the greedy fish the hooke is kinde:
Such favour beasts from cousening bates do finde.
But wouldst thou know true liberalitie ?
I ’ll teach thee then ;
bestow thy gifts on me.

Rich presents, to old men and widows sent, You hope may prove you are munificent.
What can your sordid baseness more declare, When for a present thus you send a snare ?
Such presents makes the angler to the trout:
Such presents in a mouse-trap are set out.
If you would learn what ’s generous and free, A real present is one sent to me.

I am detained by the voluptuous waters of the attractive Lucrine lake, and the caves warmed with fountains issuing from the rocks of pumice-stone, you, Faustinus, are dwelling in the domain of the Argive colonists,1 whither the twentieth milestone from the city brings you.
But the bristly chest of the Nemæan lion2 is now inflamed with heat, and Baiæ glows with more than its own warmth.
So, then, farewell, ye sacred fountains and grateful shores, the home alike of Nymphs and of Nereids!
In the cold winter you were preferable to the mountains of Hercules:
3 but now you must yield to the cool shades of Tibur.
While near the Lucrine lake, consumed to death, I draw the sultry air, and gasp for breath, Where streams of sulphur raise a stifling heat, And through the pores of the warm pumice sweat, You taste the cooling breeze, where, nearer home, The twentieth pillar marks the mile from Rome:
And now the sun to the bright lion turns, And Baiæ with redoubled fury burns ;
Then, briny seas and tasteful springs, farewell, Where fountain-nymphs confused with Nereids dwell;
In winter you may all the world despise, But now 't is Tivoli that bears the prize.

Whilst a viper was crawling on the weeping boughs of the Heliades,1 an amber-drop flowed upon the reptile as it lay in its way.
While wondering at being fettered by the gummy exudation, it suddenly grew stiff, immured in the congealing mass.
Pride not thyself, Cleopatra, on thy royal sepulchre;
for a viper reposes in a tomb still nobler.
Creeping among the boughs, where gums doe drop, The flowing amber did a viper stop:
Amazed awhile how in that dew she 's held, That straight turn'd ice, and shee in it congeal'd.
Of your vast shrine bee n't, Cleopatra, proud, Since vipers now are nobler tombs allowed.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
As ’mong the poplar boughs a viper crawls,

Let us in the summer solstice retire to Ardea and the coun­ try about Pæstum, and to the tract which burns under the Cleonæan constellation;
2 since Curiatius has condemned the air of Tivoli, carried off as he was to the Styx notwithstand­ ing its much-lauded waters.
From no place can you shut out fate:
when death comes, Sardinia a is in the midst of Tivoli itself.
When Leo rages with the summer's sun, From pestilential climates never run;
Since, in the wholesom'st and the purest air, The destinies Croatius did not spare.
When thy time's come, death from no place is bound, Sardinia in the midst of Tibur’s found.

A little while ago, Mancinus, you joyfully boasted to us, in an exulting tone, that some friend of yours had made you a present of two hundred thousand sesterces.
Only four days ago, as we were talking in the assembly-room of the poets, you told us that your cloak, which had cost ten thousand sesterces, was the gift of Pompulla;
you swore that Buss and Cælia had given you a real sardonyx, a brilliant opal, and two gems green as the waves of the sea.
Yesterday, when you suddenly left the theatre while Pollio was singing, you remarked, as you ran off, that three hundred thousand sesterces had just come to you by a legacy;
this morning you spoke of another hundred thousand, and this afternoon of a hundred thousand more.
What extraordinary injury have we, your companions, wrought you?
Have pity on us, unfeeling mortal, and at length hold your peace.
Or, if your tongue cannot be silent, tell us now and then some­ thing that we should like to hear.
Two hundred bounded by a friend, Mancinus, thou didat late pretend.
In poets' corner proved our walk;
Pompilla's present was thy talk :
Robes worth ten thousand, robes so fine!
The sardonyx with treble line, And the two gems, so like the wave, Bassa, thou swor'st, and Cælia gave.
Last night, while charming Pollio sung, Succession shook thy flippant tongue.
No theatre thy foot could stay;
Three hundred fell that very day;
And one at morn, and one since noon.
Have mercy on us, vile buffoon.
From thy poor friends what canst thou dread, That with thy wealth thou strik'st them dead ?
Or if thy clack can never tire, Say, sometimes, what thy friends desire.

On the long ridge of the Janiculan Hill lie the few acres belonging to Julius Martialis;
land more blessed than the gardens of the Hesperides.
Secluded retreats are spread over the hills, and the smooth summit, with gentle un­ dulations, enjoys a cloudless sky, and, while a mist covers the hollow valleys, shines conspicuous in a light all its own.
The graceful turrets of a lofty villa rise gently towards the stars.
Hence you may see the seven hills, rulers of the world, and contemplate the whole extent of Rome, as well as the heights of Alba and Tusculum, and every cool retreat that lies in the suburbs, with old Fidenæ and little Rubra, and the fruit-bearing grove of Anna Perenna, which delights in vir­ gins’ bloody
Thence may be seen the traveller on the Flami­ nian and Salarian roads, while his carriage is unheard, so that its wheels are no interruption to gentle sleep;
neither is it broken by the cry of the boatswain, or the noise of hawsers, although the Mulvian bridge is near, and ships are seen glid­ ing swiftly along the sacred Tiber.
This country box, but which ought rather to be called mansion, is rendered addition­ ally agreeable by the welcome of its owner;
you will imagine it to be your own;
so ungrudgingly, so liberally, is it thrown open to you, and with such refined hospitality.
You would deem it the pious abode of Alcinous, or of Molorchus re­ cently made rich.
3
You now, who think all these attrac­ tions insignificant, cultivate with a hundred spades cool Tivoli or Præneste, and give the slopes of Setia to one single husbandman;
whilst I, for my part, prefer to all your pos­ sessions the few acres of Julius Martialis.
Martiall's few acres pleasanter
Than the Hesperian gardens are:
Along the ridge of hills which crooke With many a large and hollow nooke, The topp, with little swelling there, Yett plavne, enjoys a sky more cleare;
And whilst foggs spread the winding valee, There only lightsome ayre ne'er fay les;
And gentler stars with happyness
This little lofty village bless, Whence the sev'n hills distinctly wee, And the world's lord, great Rome, do see ;
The Tusculan and Alban mount, And the suburban springs may count;
The old Fidene, Rubra’s short bounds, Perenna's apple-bearing grounds, Which much in virgin blood delight.
There in the highways to our sight
The whirling chariots oft appeare ;
Butt their sound cannot reach our eare, To break soft sleepes, nor joyned voyce
Of seamen or the boatemen's noyse, Though by the Milvian bridge so nigh On Tiber's flood the ships sayle by.
This lovely farme, or rather seate, Its master's bounty makes compleate;
With courteous frankeness still ’t is showne, So ope to guests they'd thinke 't their owns.
It's like the howse o' th' king or swayne, Who heroes once did entertayne.
You now who all too little count Cold Tiber or Præneste, or Mount Setia (which hundred teemes can't plow), May all unto their Fame allow;
Whilst Martiall's acres I prefer, Fewer, 't is true, but pleasanter.

You have always led the life, Linus, of a country gentle­ man;
an existence than which none can be more inexpen­ sive.
It was only on the ides, and occasionally on the kalends of the month,1 that you put on your toga ;
and one robe of ceremony lasted you ten summers.
The forest sent you wild boars, and the field sent you hares, without cost;
the well­ searched wood gave you fat thrushes.
The fish came easily snatched from the watery pool;
and the red cask poured forth wines of native growth.
No attendant of Grecian birth stood at your orders, but a rustic assemblage from the farm.
As often as your amorous fancies were warmed and excited by wine, the housekeeper, or the wife of your hardy labourer, sufficed to appease them.
Fire hurt not your house, nor Sirius your lands :
no ship of yours was ever sunk in the deep ;
nor is any one now at sea.
In your house dice never supplanted the quiet tali ;
2 but all your stake was a few nuts.
Tell us, then, where is the million sesterces which your parsimonious mother left you.
Nowhere.
You have accomplished a diffi­ cult thing, Linus.
Your life has ever in the country been
And in a way that nothing was so mean.
Scarce at a wedding a new bob did wear:
Your coat an old acquaintance of ten year.
From your estate your pork and venison came :
Your ponds supplied your fish, your woods your game.
And not a glass of wine throughout the year;
Your cellar stocked with only your own beer.
No French valet appeared in spruce attire:
Only John trots about your kitchen fire.
You ne'er had drunken frolic in your life, That ever aim'd above a farmer's wife.
No loss by fire, or by tempestuous skies, Of ships, insurance, freight, or merchandise.
You never play'd or ventured deep at Whitens:
The most was shilling whist on winter nights.
How is your mother's vast estate run out?
You've brought a most surprising thing about!

The poor Gaurus begged of Prætor a hundred thousand sesterces, well known to him as he was by long-standing friendship, and told nim that he wanted that sum alone to add to his three hundred thousand, to qualify him, as a full knight, to applaud the emperor..

" You know, I shall have to give a sum of money to Scorpus and Thallus ;

You always, it is true, Pamphilus, place Setine wine, or Massic, on table ;
but rumour says that they are not so pure as they ought to be.
You are reported to have been four times made a widower by the aid of your goblet.

Pure Massic wine thou dost not only drink, But giv'st thy guests :

This I believe not, yet not thirst to try.

The father of Ammianus, when dying, left him by his will nothing but a dry halter.
Who would have thought it pos­ sible, Marullinus, that Ammianus could have been made to wish his father still alive ?

and left him without hope:
For he hath nothing left him, but a rope.
By a strange turn did fortune thus contrive To make Jack wish his father were alive.

I have been long seeking, Safronius Rufus, throughout the city, for a maiden that says No:
but not one says No.
Just as if it were not right, as if it were disgraceful, as if it were prohibited, No maiden says No.
Is there then no maiden chaste ?
There are a thousand.
What then does the chaste one do ?
She does not say Yes, certainly, but still she does not say No.
Long have I searched, my Soph, the town, To find a damsel that would frown.
But not a damsel will deny, As if a shame 't were to be shy;
As if a sin, will no one dare:
I see not one denying fair. "
Then of the fair is no one chaste ? ”
A thousand,
Soph:
you urge in haste. "
What does the chaste ?
Enlarge my views."
She does not grant, nor yet refuse.

When Vestinus, overcome with disease, was at his last hour, and just on the point of crossing the Stygian waters, he prayed to the sisters who were spinning his last threads that they would bring their dark twine to an end with little delay.
While, dead for himself, he lived a few moments for his dear friends, such affectionate prayers moved the stern goddesses.
Then, having divided his great wealth, he retired from the light of day, feeling, after this was done, that he died an old man.
When on time's precipice Allworthy stood, Ready to launch into th' eternal flood, The cruel fates addressing thus he said, " Ye goddesses, one moment spare my thread:
Lost though I am, let friends my bounty prove."
His pious prayers the rigid sisters move.
He his vast wealth divides;
then quits the stage;
And in that moment lived a Nestor's age.

Nigrina, happy in thy beauty of soul, happy in thy consort, chief glory of the daughters-in-law of Latium, it delights thee to share with thy husband the wealth inhe­ rited from thy father, rejoicing to associate and participate with him in all things.
Though Evadne may have cast herself upon the funeral pyre of her husband, and have been burned;
and though a fame in no respect inferior exalt Alcestis to the stars;
thou hast done better;
thou hast gained, by visible evidence, such reputation for affection, that thy love needs not to be attested by death.
Blest in thy spirit, in thy husband blest, O thou of wives most bonour'd, and the best;
Who your whole fortune to your consort spare;
And know no joy in which he bears no share.
Evadne died in her lord's funeral flame ;

Yet less did they, when they resign'd their breath:
Late is the proof of love, when after death.

The mirror of our Roman dames are you, Nigrina, that so generously impart Your fortune where you wisely gave your heart.

Whereas in life your merits shine so clear, You need not die to make your love appear.

Although you have seen sixty harvests gathered in, and your face glistens with many a white hair, you run hither and thither wildly throughout the city, and there is no great man's chair to which you do not every morning assi­ duously pay your respects.
Without you no tribune is allow­ ed to leave his house, nor is either of the consuls excused from your dutiful attendance upon him.
Ten times a day you re­ turn to the palace on the sacred hill, and talk unceasingly of your friends Sigerius and Parthenius.
Let young men act thus-but than an officious old man, Afer, there is nothing more offensive.
Thrice twenty years you've seen your grass made hay;
Your eyebrows too proclaim your hair is grey:
Yet through all quarters of the town you run ;
At every ball, and levee, you make one.

And never fail both them who have the seals.

If you cannot excite perspiration by any other means, well and good. "

No, she, although asked once, twice, and thrice, disregarded the prayers of her lover.
Now, Fabulla, say Yeti:
I advised you to say No, but not to say No for ever.
When Fabulla heard the strain, Where the poet dares to plain
That no damsel will deny;

Of her lover she despised :

Do deny;

Recommend also, Rufus, these little books of mine to Ve­ nuleius, and beg him to grant me some few moments of his leisure, and, forgetting awhile his cares and occupations, to examine my trifles with indulgent ear.
But let him not read them after either bis first or his last glass, but when Bacchus is in his glory, and delights to witness convivial excitement.
If it be too much to read two volumes, let him roll up one of them;
and the task, thus divided, will seem shorter.
These, Rufus, to our Venuleius commend;
And beg him a moment with me to unbend.
Forget he must totally cares and designs, Not critic severely my libertine lines.
Nor let him read after the first or last cup, But when middle Bacchus bids spirits be up.
If two be too much, double one parcel down;
So half, perhaps, better the pleasure will crown.

When you are devoid of care, Nævolus, nobody is more disagreeable than you;
when you are in trouble, Nævolus, nobody is more pleasing.
When devoid of care you answer nobody's salutation, you look down on every one, you seem to think every one a slave, and no man living worthy of your regard.
When you are in trouble, you make presents to one person, you pay your respects to another as your lord and patron, and invite everybody to your house.
Pray be always, Nævolus, in trouble.

If thou wishest to be approved by Attic ears, I exhort and advise thee, my little book, to please the learned Apol­ linaris.

No one is more acute than he, or more learned, nor is any one more candid or more indulgent.
If he shall receive thee to his heart, and repeat thee with his lips, thou wilt neither have to dread the sneers of the malignant, nor wilt thou furnish parchment coverings for anchovies.
If he shall condemn thee, thou mayst run forthwith to the stalls of the salt-meat sellers, to have thy back scribbled upon by their boys.
3Wouldst thou, by Attic taste approved, By all be read, by all be loved, To learned Harris' curious eye, By me advised, dear Muse, apply.
In him the learned judge you '11 find, In him the candid friend and kind.
If he repeats, if he approves, If he the laughing muscles moves, Thou nor the critic's sneer shalt mind, Nor be to pies or trunks consign'd.
If he condemns, away you fly, And mount in paper kites the sky, Or, dead, 'mong Grub-street's records lie.

Your wife Bassa, Fabullus, has always a child at her side, which she calls her delight and her darling.
And, that you may have the greater cause for wonder, she is not at all fond of children.

You have sent me nothing in return for my little gift, and five of the days of the Saturnalia are passed.
Thus neither have six scruples of Septician silver1 been sent to me, nor a table-cloth, fit present for a complaining client, nor a jar red with the blood of the Antipolitan tunny, nor one containing small prunes, nor a little basket of wrinkled Picenian olives, so as to enable you to say that you have not forgotten me.
You may deceive others by your words and your smiling countenance ;
to me you will be henceforth an unmasked deceiver.
For the little boon that went, You, regardless, nothing sent:
And, what heightens my amaze, Five has Saturn seen his days.
Scruples one of Septy's name, Nor a cloth from client came;
Not a jar so sweetly red With the blood poor tunny shea:
Nor the texture of the twigs;
Fraught with tiny Coctan figs, Nor the wisely wattled frail, With Picenian wrinkles pale:
That you should prefer the plea, You had once remember* d me.

With your silken words and smile:
You to me have shown your plan ;
So are half an honest man.

THIS offering, 0 Cæsar, whether thou art residing upon the hills of Palladian Alba, and looking thence on the one side upon the temple of Diana, and on the other upon the waters of Thetis,—or whether the truth-telling sisters are learning thy oracular responses,1 where the smooth waters of the straits bathe the suburban meadows;
or whether the nurse of Æneas,2 or the daughter of the Sun,3 or Anxur, white with health-giving waters, attracts thee ;
-this offering I send to thee, auspicious support and protection of our empire, by whose continued preservation we believe that Jupiter shows his gratitude.

Whether i' th' Alban Mount thy station be, Where thou the prospect hast, on one side, sea, Diana's Grove on th' other;
or before This, if Caieta's bay delight thee more, The hill named from the daughter of the sun, Or where the Anxur's wholesome streams do run.
O health and safety of the public state!
Whose evils, as our own, we deprecate;
And whom, when prosperous and we happy see, Grateful we then believe the gods to be, Receive this little book I to thee send, Only a gracious hand vouchsafe t' extend ;

Myrtale is wont to smell of deep draughts of wine;
but, to deceive us, she eats bay-leaves, and cautiously mingles them in her cups instead of water.
Whenever, Paulus, you observe her with flaming face and swollen veins approaching you, you may well say, “Myrtale drinks bays."
1Myrtale often smells of wine, but, wise, With eating bay-leaves thinks it to disguise :
So nott with water tempers the wine's heate, But covers it.
Henceforth if her you meete
With red face and swell'd veynes, modestly say, “ Sure Myrtale hath drunk o’ th' bayes to day."

If it is not too much to ask, or too troublesome to you, ye Muses, make this request of your favourite Parthenius :
—
So may a long and happy old age, under the rule of Cæsar, bring thy last hour;
so mayst thou prosper, even envy her­ self looking favourably on thee;
and so may Burrus soon ap- preciate the virtues of his father, as thou shalt admit this timid and small collection within the sacred precincts of the prince's privacy.
Thou knowest the times when our Jove is at ease, when he beams on us with his own benignant counten­ ance, with which he is wont to refuse nothing to suppliants.
Thou hast no reason to fear that our request is extravagant;
a book which is decorated with cedar and purple, and swells proudly with dark bosses, never makes too great or inconveni­ ent demands.
Yet do not put these compositions too forward ;
but hold them as if thou wert offering and contemplating no­ thing.
If I know the votary of the nine sisters, he will of his own accord ask for the purple-covered book.
If what I ask appears to you not great, O Muses!
your Parthenius thus entreat:
- May thy old age come late, and happy end :
Cæsar be safe, and, to the last, your friend ;
So above envy may you ever be, Your son a scheme of all your virtues see, As you this timorous, bashful book shall grace
When in the sacred presence ’t is in place.
To you the prince's gracious moods are known, When with serenest looks, and most his own, He shines on all who to his throne address, And measures bounty out to each distress.
Nor apprehend, this trifling gilded book Aims at high things, does for great matters look;
You need not offer't, hold it in your hand, As one designing nothing to demand:
If the nine sisters' patron I do know, Himself will you command the book to show.
Anon. 1695.

Forget at length, I beseech thee, Vulcan, thy cause of complaint against us,1 and spare us:

Spare us, mighty lord;
so may thy sprightly consort pardon the nets forged at Lemnos,1 and resign herself to love thee.
As ruins renovate th' Assyrian nests, When twice five ages the Sol's bird hath spent;
So Rome her old decrepitness digests, Dress'd in the visage of her president.
Now, Vulcan, I beseech, forget and spare
Our grief, w’ are Mars and Venus progeny :
So thy loose wife shall pass the Lemnian snare, And in chaste love affect thee patiently.

The edict of our supreme lord and ruler, by which the seats in the theatre are more exactly defined, and the knight is allotted a place free from contact with the vulgar, was lately the theme of Phasis' approbation in the theatre, where, flaming with purple robes, he was boasting proudly, and in a pompous tone:
“ At length we can sit more at our ease;
the dignity of the knighthood is now restored;
we are not pressed or contaminated by the mob.”
These and such remarks was this upstart uttering, when Leitus2 ordered his arrogant purple robes to change their seat.
While Phasis in the theatre of late, Phasis, in purple shining, did dilate
On th' emperor's edict, which each order graced, And 'cording to their dignity them placed, These swelling words, big with conceit, he spake:
­ " At length we nobles here our case may take;
Regard's had of us, and our seat's set out, We 're neither press'd, nor dirty'd by the rout."
While, lolling, thus he did the rout despise, The lictor bids his saucy purple rise.

For what reason shall I say it happens, that fame is refused to writers while living, and that but few readers love the compositions of their own day ?
It is doubtless the cha­ racter of envy, Regulus, ever to prefer the ancients to the moderns.
Just so, ungrateful as we are, do we frequent the ancient portico of Pompey;
l just so do old men extol the mean temple of Catulus.

Ennius was read by thee, 0 Rome, while Virgil was alive;
and Homer was derided by his own age.
Rarely did the theatres applaud and crown Menander;
Ovid was known only to his Corinna.
Do not, however, ye little books of mine, be in haste for fame:
if glory comes only after death, I am in no hurry for it.
What's this ?
that fame to living men 's denied ?
And readers their own times seldom affect ?
Regulus, these are tricks of envious pride, The present still for old things to reject.
So most ingrate we seek old Pompey's shades, And praise the totter'd fane of Catulus.
While Maro lived, Ennius whole Rome invades.
And Homer's age laugh'd him ridiculous.
Crowned Menander seldom heard a shout, Corinna her own Naso knew alone.
O my small books, ne'er hasten to go out:
If praise come after death, I '11 not go on.

My friend Stella, Severus, wears on his fingers sardonyxes, emeralds, diamonds, jaspers.
Though there are many gems on his fingers, there are more in his verses, whence, I con­ clude, his hand is so decorated.
My Stella does upon his fingers wear Em'ralds and diamonds, sapphires, rubies fair;
Many bright gems upon his hands we see,- More, and more radiant, in his verses be.
The brilliant fancies in his lines which stand, Seem to proceed from his adorned hand.

That Masthlion proudly carries nodding burdens upon his sturdy head, or that the gigantic
Ninus holds seven or eight boys on each arm, seems to me by no means difficult, when my friend Stella bears, upon any one of his fingers, ten girls.

That the haughty Masthlion now Wields such weights on perched brow;
Or that Linus finds his praise, With each hand eight boys to raise Cannot seem a matter hard, Or attract supreme regard;
When my Stella, without pother, On one finger, this or t' other, Can, by so enchanting aids, Carry half a score of maids.

I am, I confess, Callistratus, and have always been, poor;
yet I am not an obscure or unknown knight, but am read throughout the world, and people say of me, " That is he! " and, what death has awarded to but few, has become mine during my lifetime.
But you have halls, resting upon a hundred columns;
your coffers with difficulty contain the wealth which you have gained as a freedman;
vast farms in Egyptian Syene are yours;
and Gallic Parma shears for you innumerable flocks.
Such are you and I;
but what I an, you cannot be ;
what you are, any one of the multitude may be.
I am, I own, and ever have been, poor, But yet a gentleman, and not obscure.
Spread through the world my writings and my name;
Few in the grave have reach'd my living fame.
You have a house on a vast colonnade;
More wealth than merchant ever gain'd in trade ;
Your farms in Evesham Vale rich harvests crown;
Many your flocks which feed on Bansted Down.
Such you and I:
like me you cannot be;
Fortune may make a cobbler like to thee.

And so was ever ;

Graced with a knight's degree;
nor this alone, But through the world my verse is frequent sung;
And “ That is he!" sounds buzz'd from every tongue :
And what to few, when dust, the fates assign, In bloom and freshness of my days is mine.
Thy ceilings on a hundred columns rest;
Wealth, as of upstart freemen, bursts thy chest;
Nile flows in fatness o'er thy ample fields ;
Cisalpine Gaul thy silky fleeces yields.
Lo!
such thou art, and such am I:
like me, Callistratus, thou canst not hope to be;
A hundred of the crowd resemble thee.

Nanneius, having been always accustomed to sit in the front row, at the time when anybody was allowed to take a place, moved his quarters, after being twice or thrice requested to do so, yet still seated himself on the benches of the knights, almost immediately behind Caius and Lucius.
Thence for awhile, with his head shrouded in a hood, he re­ mains a spectator of the games;
ungracefully peeping with but one eye.
Being again ejected, the unhappy wight crossed to the standing way, and, leaning over the end of a seat, halt kneeling, he endeavoured to make it appear to the knights that he was sitting, and to Leitus that he was standing.
Nanneius used in the first rank to sit, While so the sleeping edict did permit:
But, that revived, thrice routed, up he truss’d
His camp, and to the lowest seat was thrust, Ev'n behind Caius, Lucius, straitly pent:
Where, wrapping up his head, and there content Ill-favour'dly to see but with one eye, The lictor did the wretch no sooner spy, But thence he chased him to the farthest space, Between the cells ;
where, taking up his place, Half standing, and half leaning 'gainst the end Of the knights’ form, which did his stress befriend, Free from exceptions here on ev'ry hand, To some he boasts to sit;
to some, to stand.

Augustus, of my sportive effusions, and no one complains of having been injured by my verse.
But many a reader rejoices in an honoured name, to whom lasting fame is secured by my gift. "
And yet of what use are these trifles, however much they respect personal character ? "
Granted that they are of no use to many, still they amuse me.
This is the fifth book of my drolling Muse, Yet none complain my verses them abuse;
But many given they have a noble name, Who by my pen enjoy immortal fame.
What profits this, some say, though so it be ?
If none it profits, yet it pleases me.

That, although I could write on serious, I prefer to write on amusing topics, is your fault, kind reader, who read and repeat my verses all over Rome.
But you do not know how much your favour costs me.
If I were to plead causes at the temple of the scythe-bearing god,1 and to sell my words to persons trembling under accusation, many a seaman whom I had defended would send me jars of Spanish wine, and the lap of my toga would be stained with all sorts of coin.
But, as it is, my book is merely a guest and sharer of revels, and my page affords amusement for which I receive no pay.
Not even the poets of old were content with empty praise;
in those days the smallest present made to the immortal bard (Virgil) was Alexis. "
You write charmingly," you say, "and we will reward you with praises for ever.”
—Do you pretend not to understand my hints ?
You will, I suspect, make me a lawyer.
That I, who could be serious, thus doe write, Deare reader, 't is for your, not my delight, Who my lines thro’ the towne reade and repeate:
But what I lose by this you know not yet.
For would I plead for prisoners waiting death, Or unto careful clients sell my breath, That many a piece of Spanish wine would yield, And with much gold my bosome would be fill'd.
But now I and my bookes are only guests, And gratis make you merry at your feasts.
But former poets were not pay'd with prayse ;
Alexis was least meed for Virgil's layes.
Now you cry, “Good.”
That's all.
Nay then I see You not conceive me.
I must lawyer bee.

16th CentWhile you were telling us of your ancestors, and their ancestors, and the great names of your family, while you looked down on our equestrian order as a mean rank, and while you were asserting that you would marry no one who did not wear the broad border of the senator, you married, Gellia, a porter.
Of rank, descent, and title proud, Mere gentry Lady Susan could not bear;
She'd wed but with a duke, she vow'd—
And so absconded with a player.

Since, in this month of December,' in which napkins, and elegant shoe-fastenings,2 and wax-tapers, and tablets, and tapering vases filled with old Damascene plums, fly about in all directions, I have sent you nothing but my little books, the offspring of my study, I may seem to you stingy or rude.
But I hate the crafty and mischievous arts of pre­ sents.
Gifts are like fish-hooks ;
for who does not know that the greedy char is deceived by the fly which he swal­ lows ?
Whenever the poor man abstains from making pre­ sents to his rich friend, Quintianus, he shows a liberal spirit.
Now in December that the napkins fly About, spoons, candles, paper, plums, that I Only my home-born books a present make, For rude or covetous thou may'st me take.
But, know, I hate the vile ensnaring trade, By which a gift a baited hook is made;
Which is not cast to feed the hungry fish, But for a prey to fill the fisher's dish.
Then, Quinctianus, to his wealthy friend, A poor man's liberal when he nought does send.
Anon. 1695.
If any reliance is to be placed on true report.
no age, Cæsar, can be preferred to yours.
When have men had the privilege of beholding triumphs better deserved ?
When have the Palatine gods done more to merit our gratitude ?
Under what ruler has Mars's Rome shown herself fairer or greater?
Under what prince was there ever so much liberty ?
This vice, however, exists, and not a small one, although it be but one, that the poor man cultivates friends who simply treat him with ingratitude.
Who bestows any portion of his wealth upon his old and faithful friend, or whose train is accompanied by a knight whom he has helped to create ?
To have sent at the time of the Saturnalia a silver spoon of small weight, or a gaudy toga worth ten scruples, is extravagant liberality;
and our proud patrons call such things presents.
Perhaps there may be one, who will chink out a few gold pieces.
But since these men are not our friends, be thou, Cæsar, a friend to us;
no virtue in a prince can be more pleasing than generosity.
But be­ fore you have read thus far, Germanicus, you will have been laughing at me to yourself for giving you advice which a for my own benefit.
If truth make e'er her mandates heard, No times to thine can be preferred.
Great Cæsar, who could triumphs see Equal to those display'd by thee?
Or can the period be assigned, That boasted palace-gods more kind?
More great or glorious, under whom Effulged, high air, imperial Rome ?
And under what auspicious reign Had liberty so large domain ?
Yet one defect I must confess;
Nor can I cloak or make it less.
The widgeon, in dependent state, Must oft th’ ungrateful cultivate.
Who to an old and faithful friend
Will now his faculties extend ?
Or where is now the patron knowa, Attended by a knight his own ?
To send a ladle of six ounces, Amid the Saturnalian flounces ;
Or, in the hope of high renown, Ten scruples' worth of flaming gown
This is a lux'ry worthy kings, Who princely hold so paltry things.
An oddity may be so school'd, As down to chink some bits of gold Still, as such instances are rare, Be bounty, Cæsar, more thy care.
No virtue can more sweetly shine, Or in a prince be more divine.
But now I see Germanic stint
The smile:
and so I drop the hint.

If you and I, dear Martialis, might enjoy our days to­ gether free from care,—if it rested with us to dispose of our leisure time, and to spend in each other's company a life of true ease,—we should know no halls or mansions of lordly patrons, nor vexatious lawsuits and troubles of courts, nor proud family busts;
but carriage airings, conversation, read­ ing, the Campus Martius, the shady porticoes, the Virgin water,1 the warm baths;
—such places would be our constant resorts, and such our daily occupation.
As it is, neither of us lives for himself, but sees his good days flee from him and vanish ;
days which are ever being lost to us, and set down to our account.
Should any one, then, delay to live, when he knows how ?
If, dearest friend, it my good fate might be T’ enjoy at once a quiet life and thee, If we for happiness could leisure find, And wand'ring time into a method bind, We should not, sure, the great men's favour need, Nor on long hopes, the courts thin diet, feed;
We should not patience find to daily hear
The calumnies and flatteries spoken there;
We should not the lords' tables humbly use, Or talk in ladies' chambers love and news;
But books and wise discourse, gardens and fields,
And all the joys that unmixt Nature yields.
Thick summer shades, where winter still does lie, Bright winter fires that summer's part supply.
Sleep not controll'd by cares confin'd to night, Or bound in any rule but appetite.
Free, but not savage or ungracious mirth, Rich wines to give it free and easy birth.
A few companions, which ourselves should choose;
A gentle mistress, and a gentler muse.
Such, dearest friend, such, without doubt, should be Our place, our business, and our company.
Now to himself, alas!
does neither live, But see good suns, of which we are to give A strict account, set and march thick away.
Knows a man how to live, and does he stay?
Cowley
The rhetorician Apollodotus, Regulus, used formerly to salute Decimus by the name of Quintus;
Crassus, by that ot Macer.1
Now he returns the salutation of each by his own name.
How much can care and labour effect!
He had written the names down, and learned them by heart.
Instead of Decimus thou didst Quintus greet, And Macrus name when thou didst Crassus meet;
What wonders we to labour may impute ;
Writing and conning, thou canst both salute !

If I did not wish, as well as deserve, to find you at home this morning, may your Esquiline mansion, Paulus, be re­ moved still farther from me !
But I live close to the Ti­ burtine column, near the spot where rustic Flora looks upon ancient Jove.
I must surmount the steep path of the Suburran hill, and the pavement dirty with footsteps never dry;
while it is scarcely possible to get clear of the long trains of mules, and the blocks of marble which you see dragged along by a multitude of ropes.
Worse than all this is it, that, after a thousand toils, your porter tells me, fa­ tigued as I am, that you are not at home.
This is the end of my useless labour and dripping toga:
even to have seen Paulus at home in the morning was scarcely worth so much.
The most attentive client always meets with most neglect from his friends.
Unless you sleep longer in the morning,2 you cannot be my patron.
Thee at home, honoured Paul, in the morn, If I wished not, and earn'd not, to see;
Be my glory debased to my scorn, And thine Esquiline farther from me.
Fast by Tibur's famed pillar I rhyme, Where rude Flora contemplates old Jove;
Then the steepy Suburra must climb, And the rocks never dry must I rove.
Of the mules I must break the long train, And of marbles bedragg'd foi the dome.
Worst of all, after labour so vain,
Thy gruff porter denies thee at home.
This I pay, the great Paulus to miss :
This atones both the rain and the wind.
Let me die, if a price such as this I 'd afford, the best patron to find.
Thus the drudges of duty may weep, And protectors extol as divine.
But, my Paul, if thou canst never sleep, Thou canst ne'er be a sov'reign of mine.

You used to wear garments of the colour of grassy Bassus, while the laws concerning the seats in the theatre were a dead letter.
But since the care of a discreet censor has bid them revive, and the knight, more certain of his position, obeys the directions of Oceanus,3 you shine forth in a garb dyed either with saffron-colour or vermilion, and think you deceive others by such a dress.
No cloak, Bassus, is worth four hundred thousand sesterces,4 or, before all men, my friend Cordus would have been a knight.
5
In the hue of fair nature plain Bassus was dress'd, While the statutes theatnc continued at rest.
But, the moment the censor benign bade them wake, And the knight ascertained heard an Ocean that spake, Only scarlet and purple betinctured thy clothes.
Thus thou fanciest, shrewd Bassus, on fools to impose.
But no robes evei four hundred thousand have cost:
Else my Cordus a steed, before all, had emboss'd.

Hermes is the pride of his age in martial contests;
Hermes is skilled in all kinds of arms;
Hermes is a gladiator and a master of gladiators;
Hermes is the terror and awe of his whole school;
Hermes is he of whom alone Helius is afraid;
Hermes is he to whom alone Advolans submits ;
Hermes is skilled in conquering without a blow;
Hermes is his own body of reserve;
1 Hermes makes the fortunes of the letters of seats;
Hermes is the object of care and anxiety to the actresses;
Hermes walks proudly with the warlike spear;
Hermes threatens with Neptune's trident;
Hermes is terrible with the helmet shading the face;
Hermes s the glory of Mars in every way ;
Hermes is everything in himself, and thrice a man.
2Hermes, the martial glory of the age, Skilful in all the combats of the stage ;
Hermes, master of fence, and fencer too;
The cock and terror of the sword-men's crew;
Hermes, whom Helius fears, but fears alone, Advolans yields to, yet to him but one;
Hermes, that knows to conquer without blows, The second to himself against all foes;
Hermes, the stage's mint and endless gain, The love and strife of all their female train ;
Hermes, that proudly shakes the warlike spear, And fiercely threat'ning does the trident bear;
Hermes, when casked for the blindfold fight, When moped and drooping seems, does then affright;
Hermes engrosses all men's gifts in one, And Trismegistus' name deserves alone.

Does any one call him back, and restore him to the seat he is leaving ?
Does any patron offer him a share of his lordly riches P
Is there such person whose name we may commit in verse to fame and the applause of the people.
Where is he, who does not wish to sink in obscurity to the waters of Styx ?
Would not such ge­ nerosity, I ask, be better than to sprinkle the stage with a rufous cloud,1 and to be drenched with a shower of saf­ fron-water ?
Or than to spend four hundred thousand ses­ terces upon a horse which will not appreciate it;
or that the nose of Scorpus2 may glisten everywhere in gold ?
0 rich man, rich to no purpose, and faithless to thy friend, dost thou read and approve these verses ?
What glory dost thou allow to escape thee!
Wanting a knight's estate, you want the style;
The lictor comes:
" Stand up, void, stay a while.
"Does any the degraded knight call back ?
O noble deed!
Is any friend not slack
Out of vast wealth his title to restore, Not lost by any vice, but being poor ?
His gen'rous name we will commit to verse, Which all succeeding ages shall rehearse!
Who'it thus resolved his better part to save, And not descend entire into the grave ?
And were 't not nobler so great wealth bestow, Than on a vain, ambitious, public show ?
On brass unfeeling statues it expend, Although the artifice the charge commend ?
O rich in vain!
0 falsely seeming wise!
Who read, approve, and yet true fame despise.

If in calling you lately, Cordus, in one of my jocose effu­ sions, the alpha of Cloaks, the expression happened to move your indignation, you may call me in return the beta of Togas.

By no excellence of character, Aulus, could you induce Mamercus to think or speak well of you, even though you sur­ passed the two Curtii in piety, the Nervae in inoffensiveness, the Rusones in courtesy, the Macri in probity, the Maurici in equity, the Reguli in eloquence, the Pauli in wit.
Mamer­ cus gnaws everything with his foul teeth.
Perhaps you think him envious;
I may think him, whom no one can please, a wretch.
Mamercus' good conceit or word to gain,
The best endeavours, Aulus, are in vain.
Excel the Curii in a pious fame, 'Bove Nerva, Rufus, get a courteous name, In justice Macros, Mauricus outdo;
Renowned Regulus and Paulus too For mirth and eloquence :
yet all he bites With cankered teeth, and to asperse delights.
You judge, perhaps, that envy's his disease ;
— I think unhappiness, whom none does please.

Benevolent as Berkeley, were there one;
Upright as Holt, polite as Addison ;

Or could to one all these endowments fall, Still would he snarl, traduce, and censure aL.
Seems he to you satirical at worst ?
I think that man, whom none can please, is cursed.

Varro, whom the tragic muse of Sophocles would not re­ fuse to recognise, and who are not less admirable in Calabrian lays, put aside your work, and let not the scene of the elo­ quent Catullus 2 detain you, or Elegy with her graceful locks.

See with what hardihood yon troop of children spring upon the quiet bulls, and how the gentle animals delight in their burdens.
One hangs upon the tips of the horns;
another runs at pleasure along the back, and brandishes his arms over the whole body.
But their savageness is un­ aroused and at rest;
the arena would not be safer;
a plane surface might even be more dangerous.
Nor do the gestures of the children betray any trepidation;
but each of them appears sure of gaining the victory, and each of the bulls seems to be anxious not to prevent it.
See how th’ adventurous boys insult secure, While the mild bulls their weight and sport endure:
One hangs upon a horn, while others run O’er their broad backs, skirmish, assault, and shun lach other's blows :
the bulls, as frozen, stand ;
Combat they could not firmer on the land.
The children strive for th’ palm, without all fear;
The bulls, alone, solicitous appear.

To thee, 0 Pronto my father, and to thee, 0 Floccilla 2 my mother, I commend this child, the little Erotion, my joy and my delight, that she may not be terrified at the dark shades and at the monstrous mouth of the dog of Tartarus.
She would just have passed the cold of a sixth winter, had she lived but six days longer.
Between protectors so venerable may she sport and play, and with lisping speech babble my name.
Let no rude turf cover her tender bones, and press not heavy on her, 0 earth ;
she pressed but lightly on thee.
Ye parents Pronto and Floccilla here, To you I do commend my girl, my dear, Lest pale Erotion tremble at the shades, And the foul dog of hell's prodigious heads.
Her age fulfilling just six winters was, Had she but known so many days to pass.
’Mongst you, old patrons, may she sport and play, And with her lisping tongue my name oft say.
May the smooth turf her soft bones hide, and be, O earth, as light to her as she to thee !

While Euclides, clad in purple robes, was exclaiming that his income from each of his farms at Patras was two hundred thousand sesterces, and from his property near Corinth still more, and while he was tracing down his long pedigree from the beautiful Leda, and resisting Leitus, who was trying to make him leave his seat,1 suddenly there dropped from the ioga of this knight, so proud, so noble, so rich, a large key Never, Fabullus, was a key a worse friend.
2
While Euclid, clad in purple, loud did brawl, And near together by the ears did fall With Leitus.
bidding him his seat to leave, Protesting proudly, that he did receive Two thousand yearly patrimonial rent, And more, which his Corinthian manor sent;
Produced an ancient goodly pedigree, Derived from Leda, by which all might see He was in truth a knight, rich, potent, great;
A huge foul key, the badge of slaves, i’ th’ heat Unfortunately from his bosom fell.

W. S. B.Child, more sweet to me than the song of aged swans, more tender than a lamb of Phalantine Galæsus,2 more delicate than a shell of the Lucrine lake ;
thou to whom no one could prefer the pearls of the Indian Ocean, or the newly polished tooth of the Indian elephant, or the newly fallen snow, or the untouched lily ;
whose hair surpassed the fleece of the Spanish flock, the knotted tresses of the dwellers on the Rhine, and the golden-coloured field-mouse;
3 whose breath was redolent with odours which rivalled the rose-beds of Pæstum, or the new honey of Attic combs, or amber just rubbed in the hand;
compared to whom the peacock was ugly, the squirrel unattractive, the phoenix a common object;
0 Erotion, thy funeral pyre is yet warm.
The cruel In,,- of the inexorable Fates has carried thee off, my love, my delight, my plaything, in thy sixth winter yet incomplete.
Yet my friend Pætus forbids me to be sad, although he smites his own breast and tears his hair equally with myself.
"Are you not ashamed (says he) to bewail the death of a little slave?
I have buried a wife,-a wife distinguished, haughty, noble, rich, and yet am alive."
What fortitude can be greater than that of my friend Pætus (-He inherits (by the death of his wife) twenty millions of sesterces, and yet can live.
The girl that was to ear and sight More soft of tone, of skin more white, Than plumaged swans, that vield in death
The sweetest murmur of their breath ;
Smooth as Galæsus’ soft-fleeced flocks;
Dainty as shells on Lucrine rocks ;
As Red-sea pearls;
bright ivory's glow;
Unsullied lilies ;
virgin snow;
Whose locks were tipped with ruddy gold, Like wool that clothes the Bætic fold;
Like braided hair of girls of Rhine ;
As tawny field-mouse sleek and fine;
Whose vermeil mouth breathed Pæstum’s rose, Or balm fresh honey-combs disclose;
Or amber yielding odour sweet From the chafing hand's soft heat;
By whom the peacock was not fair;
Nor squirrels, pets ;
nor phoenix, rare:
Erotion crumbles in her urn ;
Warm from the pile her ashes burn:
Ere yet had closed her sixteenth year, The Fates accursed have spread her bier;
And with her all I doated on, My loves, my joys, my sports, are gone.
Yet Pætus, who, like me distress’d, Is fain to beat his mourning breast, And tear his hair beside a grave, Asks, “ Blush you .. to mourn a slave P I mourn a high, rich, noble wife ;
And yet I bear my lot of life."
Thy fortitude exceeds all bounds:
Thou hast two hundred thousand pounds:
Thou bear'st, 't is true, thy lot of fife ;
Thou bear'st the jointure of thy wife.
Elton.Calliodorus, friend Sextus, possesses (who does not know it ?) the fortune of a knight;
but Calliodorus has also a brother.
He who divides four hundred thousand sesterces would halve a fig.
Do you think that two men can sit on one horse ?
What want you with a brother, a troublesome Pollux ?
if you bad not this Pollux, you would be a Castor.
1
While you are one, you require, Calliodorus, two seats.
You are com­ mitting a solecism, Calliodorus.
Rise, or else imitate the sons of Leda, and, as you cannot sit along with your brother, Calliodorus, occupy the seat by turns.
Calliodor has a knight's estate, all know, The mischief is, he has a brother too, Who claims one half, the fig in twain does split, And on one horse two knights are fain to sit.
How can thy brother's aim and thine agree ?
No Pollux hadst thou, thou might'st Castor be;
But being one, as two if you take place, A solecism's plainly in the case.
Leda's kind offspring imitate you may, Sit knights by turns, not both on the same day.

Thirty times in this one year, Charinus, while you have been arranging to make your will, have I sent you cheese- cakes dripping with Hyblæan thyme.
I am ruined:
have pity on me at length, Charinus.
Make your will less often, or do that once for all, for which your cough is ever falsely lead­ ing us to hope.
I have emptied my coffers and my purse.
Had I been richer than Crœsus, Charinus, I should become poorer than Irus, if you so frequently devoured my poor repast.
'
Bove thirty wills a year thou dost subscribe, Oft'ner I send thee junkets for a bribe:
I am exhaust, Charinus, pity me;
The bottom of the chest and purse I see.
Delude no more, make thy will once and die, To show thy cough was real, not a lie.
Though I in wealth like Croesus did abound, Than Irus I should yet be poorer found, Should'st thou, I say not tarts, daily devour, But of vile beans and pompions such a pow'r.

Though you are more enervated than a languid eunuch, and weaker than the Celænean minion of the mother of the gods, to whom the mutilated priests of that inspiring goddess howl, you prate of theatres, and rows of seats, and edicts,' and purple robes, and Ides2 and buckles,3 and equestrian incomes ;
and, with a hand polished with pumice-stone, point out the poor.
I shall see, Didymus, whether you are en­ titled to sit on the benches allotted to the knights ;
you cer­ tainly are not to sit on those of the married men.
You, than emasculate, still less a man;
Soft, as the Celenean boy, we scan ;
Whom the mad mother's maimlings mourn the most
Of theatres, degrees, and laws you boast;
Of flowing robes, and brilliant broaches tell, Of Ides renown'd and valuations fell:
And for yon poor, your wealth to ascertain, Your pumiced hand displays the due disdain.
If, 'mid the knights, your seat we soon shall see;
'Mid husbands, Didymus, you cannot be.

A cunning thief may burst open your coffers, and steal your coin ;
an impious fire may lay waste your ancestral home ;
your debtor may refuse you both principal and interest;
your corn-field may prove barren, and not repay the seed you have scattered upon it;
a crafty mistress may rob your steward;
the waves may ingulf your ships laden with mer­ chandise.
But what is bestowed on your friends is beyond the reach of fortune;
the riches you give away are the only riches you will possess for ever.
,Thieves may break locks, and with your cash retire ;
Your ancient seat may be consumed by fire:
Debtors refuse to pay you what they owe;
Or your ungrateful field the seed you sow;
You may be plunder'd by a jilting whore ;
Your ships may sink at sea with all their store:
Who gives to friends, so much from fate secures;
That is the only wealth for ever yours.

The only wealth you '11 always have Is that you've lent to heaven.

How has it come about, I ask, how has it so suddenly come about, Dento, that though I have asked you to dinner four times, you have (who would believe it ?) constantly pre­ sumed to refuse me ?
You not only avoid looking back when I call, but you flee from me as I follow you,—me whom you so lately used to hunt for at the baths, at the theatres, and at every place of resort ?
The reason is, that you have been captivated by a more delicate table, and that a richer kitchen has attracted you like a dog.
But very soon, when your rich host shall have found you out, and left you in disgust, you will come back to the bones of your old dinner with me.
What is the cause ?
what new thing’s fallen out P That Dento, oft invited, is so stout, (Beyond belief) my table to refuse ?
He, who through all the porticos did use, The baths, the theatres, to hunt me out, Flies, when I call, and will not turn about.

To what does not love compel us ?
Encolpus has shorn his locks, against the wish of his master, who aid not even for­ bid him.
Pudens permitted, though lamenting it.
Just so did the father, foreboding evil, give up the reins to the rash Phaeton.
Just so did the stolen Hylas, and the discovered Achilles, part with their locks, the latter gladly, though to the grief of his mother.
But may thy beard be in no haste to come, or presume on thy shorn hair;
but may it be late in appearing, in return for so great a sacrifice.
Whither will not all-duteous love compel!
His vow obtain'd, Encolpus' honours fell.
While thus the thankful boy religion kept, Though not forbidding, feeling Pudens wept.
So Phoebus yielded erst th’ willing rein
To the rash youth, whom he forbade in vain.
So ravish'd Hylas laid his glory down:
So caught Achilles kindled for renown, When he denied his graceful locks to flow, And triumphed impious in a mother's woe.
But make no haste, nor trust the votive hair;
And late, thou beard, for such a boon repair.

When I happened to see you a while ago, Labienus, sitting alone, I thought you were three persons.
The number of the divisions of your bald head deceived me.
You have on each side locks of hair, which might grace even a youth.
In the middle, your head is bare, and not a single hair is to be remarked in the whole of that extensive area.
This illusion was of advantage to you in December, when the emperor distri­ buted the presents of the Saturnalia;
you returned home with three baskets of provisions.
I fancy that Geryon must have resembled you.
Avoid, I advise you, the portico of Philippus;
if Hercules sees you, it is all over with you.
1
When, Labiene, by chance I thee did see Sitting alone, I thought thou hadst been three.
The number of thy baldness me deceived, For here and there thy hairs I then retrieved, Which a boy's bead will hardly well become;
Upon thy crown lies a large vacant room, A floor wherein no hair's observed to be.
Yet this December's error yields to thee, That when the emp'ror keeps his solemn day, Thou carry'st three shares of his alms away.
Geryon, I suppose, was such a one:
But when thou seest Philippus' porch, begone ;
If Hercules shall spy thee, th’ art undone.
Fletcher.
I saw thee lately sitting all alone, And that thou hadst been three I durst have sworn, Thy seeming num’rous heads so me deceived, Thy pate here locked, and there of hair bereaved;
Not with love-locks, which beauteous boys do wear, But some parts tufted were, much broader bare.
Thy various baldness stood thee late in stead, When Cæsar doled the people meat and bread ;
For thou bor'st home what did belong to three:
The fam'd Geryon, sure, was such as thee.
Philippus' portico
I advise thee fly :
If Hercules spy thee, thou art sure to die.

Whenever
I dine at home, Charopinus, and do not invite you, your anger forthwith exceeds all bounds;
you are ready to run me through with a drawn sword, if you discover that my kitchen fire has been lighted without a view to your en­ tertainment.
What then, shall I not be allowed for once to defraud you of a dinner?
Nothing is more shameless, Cha­ ropinus, than that throat of yours.
Cease at length, I pray you, to watch my kitchen, and allow my hearth sometimes to disappoint you.
If I e'er sup at home, and not chance to invite, My poor Charopine fills, not with food, but with spite.
Nay, his rage draws the whinyard to whip my lungs through, When he learns that my hearth dared to heat without you.
Is my ev'ry such theft an infringement of law ?
Surely nought is more impudent than such a maw.
Cease, I pray, to attend to my culinar chimes ;
And let my cunning cook put upon you sometimes.

That person yonder, who has his left arm heavily laden with manuscripts, who is closely pressed by a beardless band of short-hand writers, who fixes a grave look on papers and letters, which people bring him from various quarters, as­ suming a demeanour like that of Cato, or Cicero, or Brutus, that person, I say, Rufus, even should torture try to compel him, cannot properly utter " good morning," either in Latin or in Greek.
If you think I am joking, let us go and address him.
He whose left arm loaden with books you see, And throng'd with busy clerks to that degree, Whose face composed attentively does hear Causes and suits pour'd in at either ear, Most like a Cato, Tully, or a Brute, If put upon the rack, could not salute In Latin, Ave, or χαι̃ϱε in the Greek :
And, if thou doubt the truth, let's to him speak.

YoLr services to me I remember, and shall never forget.
Why then am I silent about them, Postumus P Because you yourself talk of them.
Whenever I begin to speak to any one of your favours, he immediately exclaims, " He has told me of them himself.”
There are certain things which cannot be well done by two people;
one is enough in this case.
If you wish me to speak, keep silence yourself.
Believe me, Postumus, gifts, however great, are deprived of their value by garrulity on the part of the donor.
What thou conferr'st on me I do Remember, and shall think on too.
Why therefore do I hold my tongue P Cause, Posthumus, thou ne'er hast done.
As often as I go to treat
Of these thy gifts to them I meet, ᾽Τ is presently replied, " Forbear, He whisper’d it into my ear."
Two men some things cannot do well:
One person may suffice to tell, And do this work:
if it may please
That I shall speak, then hold thy peace.
For prithee, Postumus, believe, Though that thy gifts are great to give All thanks must perish, and are lost, When authors their own actions boast.
Fletcher.
Your favours to me I remember well;
But do not mention them;
because you tell.
Whenever I begin, I 'm answer'd straight, " I heard from his own mouth what you relate."
Two ill become the business but of one;
Be you but silent, I will speak alone.
Great are your gifts;
but when proclaimed around, The obligation dies upon the sound.

Why, my good sir, do you write about the Colchian queen ?
why about Thyestes ?
what have you to do, Bassus, with Niobe, or Andromache ?
The attest subject for your pen is Deucalion, or, if he does not please you, Phaeton.
My Bassus, why ?
why dost thou write Thyestes' feast ?
Medea's flight ?
What hast to do with Niobe ?
Or Troy's remains, Andromache ?
Deucalion’s feat's a theme more fit, Or Phaëthon’s, to share thy wit.

Why dost thou, Bassus, of Thyestes write ?
Niobe's tears, or of Medea's flight P A fitter subject of thy verse by far, Phaëthon’s burning, or the Deluge, were.

"Say, queen of birds, whom hast thou there ?

To what master to intrust your son, Lupus, has been an anxious object of consideration with you for some time.
Avoid, I advise you, all the grammarians and rhetoricians;
let him have nothing to do with the books of Cicero or Virgil;
let him leave Tutilius 1 to his fame.
If he makes verses, give him no encouragement to be a poet;
if he wishes to study lucrative arts, make him learn to play on the guitar or flute.
If he seems to be of a dull disposition, make him an auctioneer or an architect.
Whene'er I meet you, still you cry, " What shall I do with Bob my boy ? ”
Since this affair you'd have me treat on, Ne'er send the lad to Paul's or Eton.
The Muses let him not confide in, But leave those jilts to fate or Dryden.
If with damn'd rhimes he racks his wits, Send him to Mevis or St Kit's.
Would you with wealth his pockets store well?
Teach him to pimp or bolt a door well:
If he 'as a head not worth a stiver, Make him a curate or hog-driver.
Tom Brown.
You on one great concern your thoughts employ;
Still asking how to educate your boy.
First, carefully avoid, if you are wise, All Greek and Latin masters, I advise.
Let him both Cicero and Virgil shun, Unless you wish him to be quite undone.
Then, of a lad you never can have hope, Who verses makes, or reads a line in Pope.
If he in gainful business would engage, Teach him to sing or play upon the stage.
Or if he is too dull to be a player, Teach him to job, and he may die a mayor.

How far is that to-morrow off?

Although you bark at me for ever and ever, and weary me with your shameless invectives, I am determined to persist in denying you that fame which you have been so long seeking, namely, that you, such as you are, .may be read of in my works throughout the whole world.

You may remain in my gardens, my guests, as long as you please, if you can submit to lie upon the bare ground, or if plenty of furniture is brought in for your use along with you;
for as to mine, it has already suffered sufficiently from former guests.
Not one cushion, even emptied of its feathers, remains to cover my broken couches, the sacking of which lies rotting with the cords all severed.
Let us share the premises, however, between us.
I have bought the gardens;

do you furnish them;
that is the less.
Stay your owne time, and what my house affords
Take as your owne;

Or will bring with you your own furniture, For mine, o'er-worne, longer will not endure :
Of quilts to my patched bedds I have no store, The bedd-cords broake, the ticks lie on the floore:
But if to live in common you think fitt, I’ve bought the house;

The subjugation of the Nemean lion and the Arcadian wild-boar,-and of the athlete of the Libyan plain,-the con­ quest of the dread Eryx amid Sicilian dust,—the destruc­ tion of Cacus the terror of the woods, who, with stealthy cunning used to draw oxen by their tails to his cave,— secured to Alcides, notwithstanding the opposition of his stepmother, a place in heaven among the stars.
But how small are such achievements, Cæsar, compared to what are per­ formed on thy arena !
There each new morning exhibits to us greater contests.
How many monsters fall, more terrible than that of Nemea!
How many Maenalian boars does thy spear I stretch on the ground!
Were the thrice-conquered Iberian shepherd, Geryon, to be restored to life, thou hast a champion, Cæsar, that would conquer even him.
And though the hydra of Grecian Lerna be often celebrated for the number of its heads, what is that monster compared to the crocodiles of the Nile P For such exploits, Augustus, the gods awarded early immortality to Alcides ;
to thee they will award it iate.
While fain the envious stepdame would preclude
The meed of merit, in a vengeful mood;
To Hercules gave heaven, in various lore, A Nemea's terror, and Arcadia's boar;

Hot Eryx laid in dust Sicilian cool;
The forest's panic, all unknown till then, Who backward drew the heifers to his den What portion these, dread Cæsar, of thy sand ?
Superior combats does each morn command.
What huger than the Nemean monster fall!
And what Menalians does thy spear appal!
The threefold fight of the Iberian swam, Returning, would renew a Geryon slain.

Yet what ’s a hydra to the births of Nile ?
Soon gave just gods Alcides heaven to see ;

When the Attic birds, after their custom, were seeking their winter retreats, one of them remained in her nest.
The other birds, returning at the approach of spring, dis­ covered the crime, and tore the deserter in pieces.
Her punishment came late;

1When the Athenian birds explored their way To the blest climes that know no winter's day, One hapless twitt'rer, who disdained the rest, Outbraved the rigours in the fenceful nest:

Antony, thou canst cast no reproach upon the Egyp­ tian Pothinus,3 thou who didst more injury by the mur- der of Cicero, than by all your proscription lists.
Why did you draw the sword, madman, against the mouth of Rome ?
Such a crime not even Catiline himself would have com mitted.
An impious soldier was corrupted by your accursed gold, and for so much money procured you the silence of a single tongue.
But of what avail to you is the dearly-bought suppression of that sacred eloquence ?
On behalf of Cicere the whole world will speak.
So black, Mark Antony, so foul 'a thy name, That ev'n Pothinus' guilt thou dar'st not blame:
In TuRfs gore alone more deeply dyed, Than all the sea of blood thou shedd’st beside.
How durst thou, madman, sheath thy impious blade In Rome's own throat ?-in Tully's life invade
The commonwealth's?
A crime that put a stand To Cat'line's soul, and damp'd his daring hand.
Thou hir'dst a villain with accursed gold
To gag the tongue that did thy life unfold ;
What boots it thee, to silence, at such price, One divine tongue ?
Think'st so to hide thy vice ?
For virtue now, and murder'd Tully's sake, All tongues inveigh, and all philippics make.

If you are suffering from dread of a melancholy dinner at home, Toranius, you may come and fast with me.
If you are in the habit of taking a preparatory whet, you will experience no want of common Cappadocian lettuces and strong leeks.
The tunny will lurk under slices of egg;
a cauliflower hot enough to burn your fingers, and which has but just left the cool garden, will be served fresh and green on a black platter;
while sausages will float on snow-white porridge, and the pale bean will accompany the red-streaked bacon.
If you would know the riches of the second course, raisins will be set before you.
and pears which pass for Syrian, and chestnuts to which learned Naples gave birth, roasted at a slow fire.
The wine you will prove in drinking it.'
After all this, if Bacchus perchance, as is his wont, produce a craving, excellent olives, which Picenian branches recently bore, will come to your relief, with the hot vetch and the tepid lupine.

The dinner is small;
who can deny it (-but you will not have to invent falsehoods, or hear them invented;
you will recline at ease, and with your own natural look;
the host will not read aloud a bulky volume of his own compositions, nor will licentious girls from shameless Cadiz be there to gratify you with wanton atti­ tudes ;
but (and I hope it will not be unpleasant or distaste­ ful to you) the small reed-pipe will be heard.
Such is my little dinner.
You will follow Claudia, whom you earnestly wish should be with me before yourself.
To supp alone if grievous bee, At your own home, come fast with me:
Your stomach to prepare, you shall Have lettice and strong leekes with all;
A piece of ling with eggs, and greene Coleworts with oil, shall there be scene
In platter brown, new gathered From the cold garden where't was bredd;
Pudding or sausage shall not faile, And bacon redd, with beanes more pale.
I f second course you do affect, Dried latter-grapes you may expect;
The pleasant boasted Syrian peares ;
And chestnutts which learned Naples beares, Roasted i’ th' embers, shall attend;
The wine your drinking will commend.
After which if you hungry grow LAs many cupps will make men doe), Rich olives we will you allow, Fresh gather'd from the Picene bough ;
Or scalded lupines, or parch'd peas:
A slender supper, I confess, But yet unforced;
where you may bea
In your discourse and garb most free;
Nor tedious vo umes forced to hear ;
Nor wanton Spanish wenches there, Wriggling with heat of lust, shall make Their practised limbs all postures take:
The small pipe's notes shall then rebound, But with no harsh unpleasing sound;
And the nice Claudia there shall bee, Whom you would rather have than mee.

The boy now sadly leaves his playthings, and returns at the call of his loud-voiced preceptor;
and the drunken gamester, betrayed by the rattling of his seductive dice­ box, is imploring mercy of the magistrate, having, but a little while before, been dragged from some obscure tavern.
The Saturnalia are quite at an end, and you have sent me, Galla, neither the little nor the lesser gifts, which you used to send.
Well, let my December pass thus.
You know very well, I suppose, that your Saturnalia, in March,1 will soon be here.
I will then make you a return, Galla, for what you have given me.
Now the sad schoolboy crawls from play, Call'd by his awful lord away;
And now, by his dear box betray'd, Dragg'd from a tippling hole dismay'd,
The gambler, reeling on his legs, The Ædile's gracious pardon begs.
OUT joys are o'er, thou must confess;
Nor greater presents thou, nor less, Host sent to cheer the social ember;
But so let drawl our dull December.
Thou, Galla, know'st a feast a-coming, And doutless ev'ry hour art summing, Nor do I, more than thou, abhor The Calends of the god of war.
Then, Galla, will I pay, with reason, The love thou show dst our festal season.
Elphinston,To you, MARTIALIS, especially dear to me, I send my sixth book;
which if it should be polished with your exact taste, may venture, with little anxiety or apprehension, into the august presence of Cæsar.

If it shall pass approved thy learned ear, When 't is in Cæsar's hand, I less shall fear.

It used to be a common sport to violate the sacred rites of marriage ;
a common sport to mutilate innocent males.
You now forbid both, Cæsar, and promote future generations, whom you desire to be born without illegitimacy.
Hence­ forth, under your rule, there will be no such thing as a eunuch or an adulterer ;
while before, oh sad state of morals !
the two were combined in one.
They sported, erst, with wedlock's holy flame, And innocence t' unman, they held no shame.
Both, Cæsar, thou forbid'st with generous scorn;
And sayst:
0 coming age, be guiltless born.
No castrate or suborner shall there be:
Erewhile the castrate was the debauchee.

Spring into light, 0 child promised to the Trojan Iulus,1 true scion of the gods;
spring into light, illustrious child!
May thy father, after a long series of years, put into thy hands the reins of empire, to hold for ever;
and mayst thou rule the world, thyself an old man, in concert with thy still more aged sire.
For thee shall Julia herself,2 with her snow- white thumb, draw out the golden threads of life, and spin the whole fleece of Phrixus' ram.
Come, promised name;
Iulus' race adorn.
True offspring of the gods!

To whom thy sire, when many an age has roll'd, May give th eternal reins with him to hold.
The golden threads shall Julia's fingers draw, And Phrixus' fleece the willing world shall awe.

I have bought a farm in the country for a great sum of money;
I ask you, Cæcilianus, to lend me a hundred thou­ sand sesterces.

It is for that reason, Cæcilianus, that I ask you.

Cecilian, lend me, pray, a hundred pound.
Dost say, I ne'er will pay ?
And thereon pause ?
To speak the truth, I borrow for that cause.

From the time when the Julian law, Faustinus, was re­ vived, and modesty was ordered to enter Roman homes, it is now either less, or certainly not more, than the thirtieth day, and Telesilla is already marrying her tenth husband.
She who marries so often cannot be said to marry at all ;
the is an adulteress under cover of the law.
An avowed prostitute offends me less.
Faustinus, from the hour the Julian law Revived, and chastity began to draw By public edict into every house, Scarce thirty days have pass'd, Since Thelesine was ask'd, And ten times over hath been made a spouse.
She that doth wed so oft, weds not at all;
But rather her we may more truly call A mere legitimate adulteress:
A simple arrant wench offends me less.

A little while ago, when I happened to ask of Jupiter a few thousand sesterces, he replied, " He will give them to you, who has given temples to me."
Temples indeed he has given to Jupiter, but to me no thousands at all.
I am asham­ ed, alas !
of having asked too little of our Jupiter.
Yet how kindly, how undisturbed with anger, and with how placid a countenance, did he read my request!
With such did he restore their diadems to the suppliant Dacians, with such does he go and come along the way to the Capitol.
0 Virgin,2 confidant of our Jupiter, tell me, I pray thee, if he refuses with such a look as this, with what sort is he wont to grant P
Thus J besought Pallas, and thus she, laying aside her Gorgon, briefly replied:

"I late of Jove a thousand crowns did crave;
“ He'll give 't," says he, " who me a temple gave."
That he, 't is true, a temple gave to thee, But yet no thousand crowns bestows on me.
I backward was our Jove this way t’ engage:
But how serene !
How free from cloudy rage
He read my suit !
With such a placid brow To conquer'd kings their crowns he does allow;
And from the Capitol returns and goes.
0 Virgin!

If with such looks he does our suits reject, Say, with what mien he does them then accept.

Do you wonder, Marcus, that a Pylades and an Orestes are not to be found in the present day ?
Pylades, Marcus, used to drink the same wine as Orestes;
and before Orestes was not set a better kind of bread or a fatter thrush, but there was one and the same entertainment for both.
You devour Lucrine oysters;
I feed upon those from the waters of Pe­ loris;
and yet my taste is not less nice than yours, Marcus.
You are clothed from Cadmean Tyre;
I, in the coarse gar­ ments of Gaul.
Do you expect me, clad in a common soldier's cloak, to love you who are resplendent in purple ?
If I am to play Pylades, let some one play Orestes to file;
and this is not to be done by words, Marcus.
To be loved, show love yourself.
Where is there now a Pylades ?
you cry :
Act you Orestes' part, and he am I.
Their cup was common ;
and it is averred,
They never supped, but each man had his bird.
You feast on turbot, whilst I eat poor-jack :
I like, as well as you, a glass of sack.
Can I love you, in uncut velvet neat,
In an old coat that comes from Monmouth-street P Be you a friend, if you a friend would prove :
Fine words are vain;
love is the price of love.

Who would not suppose thee, Julia, to have been fashioned by the chisel of Phidias, or to be the offspring of the art of Pallas herself?
The white Lygdian marble seems to answer in the speaking image, and a life-like gloss beams on thy placid countenance.
Thy hand plays, not ungracefully, with the cestus of the Acidalian goddess, stolen from the neck of little Cupid.
To revive the love of Mars and of the supreme Thunderer, let Juno and Venus herself ask of thee thy cestu8.
Who would not think this piece by Phidias wrought ?
Or to perfection by Minerva brought ?
The snow-white marble seemeth ev'n to speak, Such life and grace does from the countenance break.
It sporting holds Love's girdle in its hand, And 'bove the god of love does love command.
When Venus would in Mars lost flames renew, Here for the charming cestus she must sue.

My suit has nothing to do with assault, or battery, or poisoning, but is about three goats, which, I complain, have been stolen by my neighbour.
This the judge desires to have proved to him ;
but you, with swelling words and ex­ travagant gestures, dilate on the Battle of Cannæ, the Mith­ ridatic war, and the perjuries of the insensate Carthaginians, the Syllæ, the Marii, and the Mucii.
It is time, Postumus, to say something about my three goats.
My cause concerns nor battery nor treason;
I sue my neighbour for this only reason, That late three sheep of mine to pound he drove:
This is the point the court would have you prove.
Concerning Magna Charta you run on, And all the perjuries of old King John;
Then of the Edwards and Black Prince you rant, And talk of John o' Stiles and John o' Gaunt:
With voice and hand a mighty pother keep.

In uniting for ever Ianthis to the poet Stella, Venus gaily said to him, " I could not give you more."
This sabe said before his mistress;
but added maliciously in his ear, " Be careful, rash man, not to be guilty of any folly.
Often have I, in a rage, beaten the dissolute Mars for his wandering propensities before he was fairly united to me.
But now he is my own, he has never wronged me with a rival.
Juno would be happy to find Jupiter as well conducted."
She spoke, and struck the poet's breast with her mysterious cestus.
The blow was sweet:
but now, 0 goddess, spare thy votary.
'When erst the joyous queen of love Ianthis made a Stella's dove!
She said:
" I could not more bestow."
The lady heard, and rev'renced low.
Now Venus whispered in his ear:
Beware thou do not sin, my dear.
How oft the god of war I smote, And bid him change his rambling note, Before I deign'd the bluff to wed As lawful inmate of my bed!
But, after mine the god became, He burnt with no illicit flame;
Great Juno well could wish her Jove, As loyally averse to rove.
With this she closed her secret song, And thwack'd him with her pleasing thong.
But mutual, goddess, make the oath, And smack the bride and bridegroom both.

Let them who are devoid of reason wish for war and savage Mars ;

Thick sculls are best against a sabre:

O Nepos, who art doubly my neighbour (for thou, like myself, inhabitest a dwelling next to the Temple of Flora, as well as the ancient Ficeliæ),3 to thee has been born a daugh­ ter, whose face is stamped with the likeness of her father, evidence of her mothers fidelity.
Spare not too much, how­ ever, the old Falernian, and leave behind you casks filled with money rather than with wine.
May thy daughter be affectionate and rich, but let her drink new wine;

The Cæcuban vintage must not be the drink of those only who have no children;
fathers of families, believe me, can also enjoy life.
Let me exhort you, who my neighbour are, As well in Yorkshire as in Grosvenor-square ;
And have a girl, your picture to the life, Whose likeness is an honour to your wife;
Broach your best Burgundy, and never spare it;
Leave her a cask of guineas, not of claret:
Or should she, rich and virtuous, take a cup, Let it be wine of her own nursing up.
I never can agree in any sort, That bachelors drink claret, and you port.
Hay,Glaucias, the well-known freedman of Melior, at whose death all Rome wept, the short-lived delight of his affection­ ate patron, reposes beneath this marble sepulchre close to the Flaminian Way.
He was a youth of pure morals, of simple modesty, of ready wit, and of rare beauty.
To twice six harvests completed, the youth was just adding another year.
Traveller, who lamentest his fate, mayst thou never have ought else to lament!
That lovely youth, hee so well known,
Whose death all Rome did so bemoane, His lord's too short delight, though deare, Under this stone interr d lies here, Near the Flaminian Way.
So chaste
In his behaviour, so shamefaced And innocent, so quick of witt, Lovely in shape and features, yett So young was seldom ever scene ;
He scarcely had attayn'd thirteene.
Who, passing by, weeps o'er this grave, May hee ne'er other sorrows have !
Old MS. 16th Century.
Glaucia was not of the lower class of house slaves, nor of such as are sold in the common market:
but he was a youth worthy of the tender affection of his master, and, before he could as yet appreciate the kindness of his patron, he was already made the freedman of Melior.
This was the reward of his morals and his beauty.
Who was more attractive than he ?
or whose face more resembled that of Apollo ?
Short is the life of those who possess uncommon endowments, and rarely do they reach old age.
Whatever you love, pray that you may not love it too much.
Less by his birth than by his merit known, A favourite lamented by the town, Of friends the exquisite but short-lived joy, Amongst the great interr'd, here lies a boy :

An early judgment, and a cherub's face.
But soon, alas!
too soon his race was run !
Scarce had he seen a thirteenth summer's sun!
Ne'er may he grieve again, who drops a tear!
Worth is short-lived;

If you had given me six thousand sesterces forthwith, when you said to me, " Take them, and carry them away, I make you a present of them," I should have felt as much indebted to you, Pætus, as if you had given me two hundred thousand.
But now, when you have given them to me after a long delay,-after seven, I believe, or nine months,—I can tell you (shall I ?) something as true as truth itself:
you have lost all thanks, Pætus, for the six thousand sesterces.

While Bellona yet hesitated as to the result of the civil war, and the gentle Otho had still a chance of gaining the day, he looked with horror on a contest which would cost great bloodshed, and with resolute hand plunged the sword into his breast.
Grant that Cato, in life, was even greater the Cæsar ;
was he greater in death than Otho ?
Whilst doubtful was the chance of civil war, And victory for Otho might declare;
That no more Roman blood for him might flow, He gave his breast the great decisive blow.

Was he so great as Otho in his fall ?

Count the bees that on Hybla are playing;
Count the flowers that enamel its fields;
Count the flocks that on Tempe are straying;
Or the grain that rich Sicily yields.
Go, number the stars in the heaven ;
Count how many sands on the shore ;
When so many kisses you *ve given, I still shall be craving for more.
To a heart full of love let me hold thee, To a heart, which, dear Chloe, is thine ;
With my arms I '11 for ever enfold thee, And twist round thy limbs like a vine.
What joy can be greater than this is ?
My life on thy lips shall be spent;
But the wretch that can number his kisses, With few will be ever content.

Do you see how the little Regulus, who has not yet com- pleted his third year, praises his father whenever he hears his name mentioned ?
and how he leaves his mother's lap when he sees his father, and feels that his father's glory is his own ?
The applause, and the court of the Centumviri, and the closely packed surrounding crowd, and the Julian temple,' form the child's delight.
Thus the scion of the noble horse delights in the dusty expanse of the plain;
thus the steer with tender forehead longs for the combat.
Ye gods, preserve, I entreat, to the mother and father the object of their prayers, that Re­ gulus may have the pleasure of listening to his son, and his wife to both.
See Regulus, not aged three, aspire
To fan the fuel of a father's fire ;
From his fond mother's arms behold him flown, To catch applauses, which he feels his own.
The judges' glories, and the people's noise, The Julian temples prove the infant's joys.
Thus the keen offspring of the gen'rous steed Already pants to paw the sounding mead.
Thus the young bull, with harmless front, will play The embryo battles of another day.

So crown the father, mother, child, and me, That he may feel his son's attemper'd fire, And she may hear the rival son and sire.

This, who runs towards us so like a Moor, with his crisped hair, avows himself the offspring of the cook Santra;

The wrestler Pannicus his picture were ;
Dama, the third, who that did e'er him see, Knows not the blear-eyed baker's son to be ?
The fourth, a sweet-faced boy, with wanton mien, Was got by Lygdus, thy hee-concubine:
Use him so too;
thou need'st no incest feare :
But this, with taper head and his long care, Which like an ass's moves, who can deny
To be the idiot Cyrrha's progeny ?

If the Lacedæmonian customs please you, you may, after being gratified with dry heat, plunge into the Virgin or Martian waters ;

But you are not attending, and have all the while been listening to me with a deaf ear.

Not Phœbus' foards, or Baise, best Of waters.
No place is so blest With cleere fayre weather;

Fat onyxes there panting sweate, And flaming ophites burne with heate.
If the Laconian mode you crave, Dry stones to sweate in there you 'll have.
In cold and Virgin streams you may There bathe, so pure, so cleere, are they, The marble pavement dry you'd sweare, Not once suspecting water there.

16th CentWhile happy Baiæ, Castricus, is showering its favours upon you, and its fair nymph receives you to swim in her sulphureous waters, I am strengthened by the repose of my Nomentan farm, in a cottage which gives me no trouble with its numerous acres.
Here is my Baian sunshine and the sweet Lucrine lake;
here have I, Castricus, all such riches as you are enjoying Time was when I betook myself at pleasure to any of the far-famed watering-places, and felt no apprehension of long journeys.
Now spots near town, aud retreats of easy access, are my delight;
and I am content if permitted to be idle.
While you at Bath indulge each happy day, In bathing, drinking, dancing, or at play;
I at Barn Elms a villa have of late, Healthy, and not too large for my estate.
And here am I as rich as you can be;
'T is Bath, 't is Tunbridge, everything to me.
Once every public place was my abode;
Nor was I better pleased than on the road.
Now like a house, to which with ease I go;
And to be idle, find enough to do.

You imagine, Calliodorus, that your jesting is witty, and that you above all others overflow with an abundance of Attic salt.
You smile at all, you utter pleasantries upon all, and you think that by so doing you will please at the dinner table.
But I will tell you something, not very nice, but very true.
No one will invite you, Calliodorus, to drink out of his glass.
1Wond'rous witty Calliodore!
Salt has sprinkled thee all o'er Tickling, with respective zest, Thou must be a pleasant guest.
Yet the truth, if blunt, may be:
Not a soul will drink with thee.

You have had your diversion ;

You, who have lived so freely, are married, and now only chaste pleasure is allowed you.
But is there any chaste pleasure, when Lætoria is married to Lygdus ?
She will be worse as a wife than she recently was as a mistress.
Ye've play'd enough, lascivious cronies, wed ;
No lust is lawful but in marriage bed.
Is this love chaste ?

Thou household nymph of ray friend Stella, who glidest.
with pure stream, beneath the gemmed halls of thy lord, whether the consort of Numa has sent thee from the caves of the triple goddess, or whether thou comest as the ninth of the band of Muses, Marcus releases himself from his vows to thee by sacrificing this virgin pig, because, when ill, he drank furtively of thy waters.
Do thou, reconciled to me at length by this expiation, grant me the peaceful delights of thy fountain;
and let my draughts be always attended with health.
Pellucid daughter of perennial spring, Who giv'st my Stella s gemmy dome to ring;
Did Numa's goddess glide thee from the cave, Where the chaste Trivia wont her limbs to lave ?
Or, origin as thou must own divine, Perhaps the ninth thou issu'st of the Nine.
If with the virgin porket I have paid, And streaming eyes, the theft a sickling made;
My crime atoned, accept the suppliant strain!
Indulge thy joys, nor let me pant in vain.

I am not carved out of the fragile elm, and this column, which rises so straight and so firm, is not made of wood taken at random, but is produced from the evergreen cypress, which fears neither hundreds of centuries nor the decay of a long-protracted old age.
Fear it, evil-doer, whoever you may be;
for if you injure with rapacious hand even the smallest cluster on this vine, this cypress shall ingraft upon your body, however much you may struggle against it, a fig-tree which will bear fruit.
1
No brittle elm my substance gave;
Nor is this firm uplifted stave Hewn from a common wayside block, But ever-living cypress' stock —
That tree which fears not canker's bite, Nor centuries' devastating flight.
Thief!
of the garden-god beware!
For if with greedy hand thou dare
The smallest cluster hence to take, This cypress-slave on thee shall make (Howe'er thou struggle to get free) Agraft that will bear fruit to thee.
W. S. B.While Telesinus was poor, and cultivated virtuous and honest friends, he used to wander about in sorry guise, clad in a chilly little toga.
But since he has begun to pay court to persons of licentious character, he can buy himself plate, table services, and farms.
Do you wish to become rich, Bithynicus ?
Become a panderer to vice;
virtuous courses will gain you nothing, or very little.
Whilst he did none but honest friends observe, In thredd-bare cloake he walked, and like to starve:
Since he's the wanton gallants' nabber growne, He farmes good fayre, and coyne has of his owne.
Would'st thou be rich, then thou must share the crimes, Else not the wealth, of these licentious times.

In this tomb reposes Pantagathus, the object of his master's auction and regret, snatched away in the prime of youth.
Well skilled was he in clipping stray hairs with scissors that gently touched them, and in trimming bristly cheeks.

thou canst not be lighter than was the artist's hand.
Snatcht hence, yet scarce a youth, under this stone Lyes hee, his master's joy once, now his moane:

Do you ask, Faustinus, the cause of a death so sudden ?

namely, that Sextilianus is fallen in love with his "so great" and " so great."
1Because you are always redolent of lavender and cinnamon, and stained1 with the spoils from the nest of the proud phoenix, exhale the odour of Nicerotius's 2 leaden vases, you smile with contempt, Coracinus, on us, who smell of nothing.
I would rather smell of nothing than of scents.
Of richest spices thou do'st ever scent, Nor is the phœnix' nest more redolent.
Despisest us, who do n't in sweets excel:
Of nought't is better than of odours smell.

You manufacture, with the aid of unguents, a false head of hair, and your bald and dirty skull is covered with dyed locks.
There is no need to have a hairdresser for your head.
A sponge, Phœbus, would do the business better.

And o'er his scalp a painted border wears:
Thou need'st no barber to correct thy pate, Phœbus, a sponge would better do the feat.

Whilst you, Aulus, delight in a near view of the Arcadian bear, and with enduring the climate of northern skies, oh how nearly had I, your friend, been carried off to the waters of Styx, and seen the dusky clouds of the Elysian plain !
My eyes, weak as they were, continually looked round for your countenance, and the name of Pudens was perpetu ally on my cold tongue.
If the wool-spinning sisters do not weave the threads of my life black, and my voice does not address inattentive deities, you will return safe to the cities of Latium to see your friend safe, and, as a deserving knight, be rewarded with the rank of first centurion.
While thou didst joy to eye the sluggish Wain, And in thy prospect either Bear to gain;
How nearly ravish'd to the Stygian shore, Up to Elysium's awful dawn I bore!
On thee my heavy eyeballs hov'ring hung, And Pudens falter'd on my stiff'ning tongue.
Yet, if no sable thread the sisters draw, And, if those deign to hear, whom late I saw, My pow'rs restored shall hail thee safe and sound, In Latian climes, with knightly honors crown'd.

How much simpler and honester would it be for you to wear your fur cloaks even in the month of August.
Thy chest such store of winter-garments hold, Thou griev'st, and oft complain'st, for want of cold;
Wished dark days and short, sharp winds and snow, And hates the season, if it milder grow.
Didst thou the worse for my thin gown e'er fare, Borne from my back by ev'ry puff of air ?
How much more humane, more sincere, 't were done, Should'st thou in August winter-cloths put on ?

Pompullus has accomplished his end, Faustinus;
he will be rend, and his name be spread through the whole world!
So may the inconstant race of the yellow-haired Germans flour­ ish, and whoever loves
Dot the rule of Rome!
Yet the writ­ ings of Pompullus are said to be ingenious;
but for fame, believe me, that is not enough.
How many eloquent writers are there, who afford food for mites and worms, and whose learned verses are bought only by cooks!
Something more is wanting to confer immortality on writings.
A book des­ tined to live must have genius.
Hee 's made, for one, the people cry, " Loud Fame Through the whole world shall Pompullus' name!
Such bee th' inconstant yellow Germans' fate!
So prosper all who Roman empire hate!
Yet are his lines, you '11 say, ingenious :
That's not enough ;
fame is not gotten thus:
For mothes and wormes how many learned bookes Prove food, or else waste paper for the cookes!
There's somewhat more in 't.
To make lines to live, A constant veine of wit you must them give.

Rome, city of my affections, praises, loves, and recites my compositions;
I am in every lap, and in every hand.
But see, yon gentleman grows red and pale by turns, looks amazed, yawns, and, in fact, hates me.

my writings now please me.

There 's one yet lowers, disdains, is ill at ease:

you know that he who courts you is a covetous fellow;

and yet you name him in your will, foolish man, as your heir, and destine him, as if you were out of your mind, to take your place. "
But he has sent me, you say, large presents."
True, but they are a baited hook;

Will this pretend­ er bewail your death with real sorrow ?
If you desire him to weep, Marianus, give him nothing.

And yet, mad foole, him for theine heire thou tak'st;
And to thy will executor thou mak'st.

Although you are neither sprung from the austere race of the Fabii, nor are such as he whom the wife of Curius Dentatus brought forth when seized with her pains beneath a shady oak, as she was carrying her husband his dinner at the plough;
but are the son of a father who plucked the hair from his face at a looking-glass, and of a mother con­ demned to wear the toga in public;
1 and are one whom your wife might call wife ;
2 you allow yourself to find fault with my books, which are known to fame, and to carp at my best jokes,—jokes to which the chief men of the city and of the courts do not disdain to lend an attentive ear,—jokes which the immortal Silius deigns to receive in his library, which the eloquent Regulus so frequently repeats, and which win the praises of Sura, the neighbour of the Aventine Diana, who beholds at less distance than others the con­ tests of the great circus.

Even Cæsar himself, the lord of all, the supporter of so great a weight of empire, does not think it beneath him to read my jests two or three times.
But you, perhaps, have more genius;
you have, by the polishing of Minerva, an understanding more acute;
and the subtle Athens has formed your taste.
May I die, if there is not far more understanding in the heart of the animal which, with entrails hanging down, and large foot, lungs coloured with congealed blood,-an object to be feared by all noses,—is carried by the cruel butcher from street to street.
You have the audacity, too, to write verses, which no one will read, and to waste your miserable paper upon me.
But if the heat of my wrath should burn a mark upon you, it will live, and remain, and will be noted all through the city;
nor will even Cinnamus, with all his cunning, efface the stigma.
But have pity upon yourself, and do not, like a furious dog, provoke with rabid mouth the fuming nostrils of a living bear.
However calm he may be, and however gently he may lick your fingers and hands, he will, if resent­ ment and bile and just anger excite him, prove a true bear.
Let me advise you, therefore, to exercise your teeth on an empty hide, and to seek for carrion which you may bite with impunity.
When sprung of Fabius' race you no way are, Nor Curius, who himself to's plough-men bare
Their dinner;
whose rough wife her child-bed made
Under the covert of an oak's thick shade:
But of a father born, trimm'd by a glass, A mother for a courtesan does pass;
And so effeminate you yourself withal, Your wife, though nice she be, you wife may call;
For you to dare my much-famed verse detract!
The Momus, on my approved toys to act!
My toys, I say, all Rome attentive hear, To which both learn'd and noble lend an ear;
Which deathless Silius with regard does treat;
And Regulus' fluent tongue deigns to repeat;
Which to revolve, Cæsar a time does spare, Amidst the weight of all the public care.
But you know more, your wise discerning heart Pallas has framed by the Athenian art.
May I not live, if th' heart and paunch we meet, The garbage, guts, and the great dangling feet, Which loaded butchers carry through the street, With no small terror unto ev'ry nose, Do not a sharper wit than thine disclose.
Yet, with the waste of paper, against me Verses you write, such as none read or see :
But if my chafed choler thee shall brand, The work will live, be read in ev'ry land;
'T is not thy barbers soap can cleanse the stain.
Take heed the outrage be not thine own bane, To urge a living bear, cease to presume, Until his rage forth at his nostrils fume.
Though calm, he 'll lick the hand, and strokings bear;
Roused and provoked, you 'll find him still a bear.
Thy teeth then fasten in some empty hide, Or beast that's dead, and will the wrong abide.
Anon. 1695."You write epigrams in hexameters,” is what Tucca, I know, is saying.
There are, Tucca, precedents for it;
in a word, Tucca, it is allowable. "
But this one, you say, is very long."
There are precedents for its length also, Tucca, and it is allowable.
If you approve of shorter ones, read only my distichs.
Let us agree, Tucca, that I shall be at liberty to write long epigrams, and you be at liberty not to read them.
What ?
in long verse write epigrams ?
say you.
I say, 't is usual, and 't is lawful too.
Then, they are long.
This too is law and use:
If you like short, do you the distichs chuse.
Let us agree ;
the bargain does no hurt;
I may write long;
and you may read the short Hay.
The crier Gellianus was lately offering for sale a young lady of not over-good reputation, such as sit in the middle of the Suburra.
1
When she had been for some time standing at a small price, the seller, desiring to prove her purity to all around, drew her towards him, and, while she feigned resistance, kissed her two, three, and four times.
Do you ask the result he produced by his kisses ?
It was, that he who had just offered six hundred sesterces, withdrew his bidding.
Gellian the crier brought a lass
To market, of small fame to pass, Such as in ill-fam'd taverns sate:
Whiles she stood long at a small rate, He to approve her sound and good,' Drew her near to him as she stood, And kiss'd her three or four times o'er:
But wouldst thou know what fruit these bore ?
Why he that bade six hundred pieces for her, Upon this score did utterly abhor her.

Do you ask, Pannicus, why your wife Cælia has about her only priests of Cybele ?

To sport
She loves, and pay no suffering for't.

Bewail your crime, ye Naiads, bewail it through the whole Lucrine lake, and may Thetis herself hear your mourning!
Eutychus, your sweet inseparable companion, Castricus, has been snatched away from you, and has perished amid the waters of Baiæ.
He was the partner and kind consoler of all your cares:
he was the delight, the Alexis, of our poet.
Was it that the amorous nymph saw thy charms exposed beneath the crystal waves, and thought that she was sending back Hylas to Hercules ?
Or has Salmacis at length left her effeminate Hermaphroditus, attracted by the embrace of a tender but vigorous youth ?
Whatever it may be, whatever the cause of a bereavement so sudden, may the earth and the water, I pray, be propitious to thee.
You wat'ry nymphs weepe for your dire mishap, But with whole floods pour'd into Thetis lapp.
That lovely youth in Baian streames is drown'd,
Whom by your side so oft you sweetely found, I)eare Castricus:
companion of your care
And sweete hearts-ease, your love, your minion fayre.
Thee naked i'th' cleare waves when shee did see, Did the nymph leave her Hylas and seize thee;
Or Salmacis her loved Hermaphrodit With this soft youth's embraces tempted quitt ?
Whatever the cause o' th' sudden rapyne be, May earth and water gently cover thee!

Sixty summers, Marcianus, and, I think, two more have been completed by Cotta, and he does not remember ever to have felt the weariness of a bed of sickness even for a single day.
With resolute, nay uncourteous gesture, he bids the doctors Alcon, Dasius, and Symmachus keep at a distance.
If our years were accurately counted, and if the amount subtracted from them by cruel fevers, or oppres­ sive languor, or painful maladies, were separated from the happier portion of our lives, we should be found in reality but infants, though we seem to be old men.
He who thinks that the lives of Priam and of Nestor were long is much deceived and mistaken.
Life consists not in living, but in enjoying health.
Cotta has passed his threescore years and two,
And ne'er remembers that he had to do With sickness, or yet once laid down his head;
For a distemper felt a tedious bed:
But at physicians he durst point with scorn, At Dasius and Alcontus make a horn.
If, like wise men, we do our years compute, Raze or subtract the days that did not suit With happy life, such as in pain are spent, Gouts, fevers sharp, and the mind's discontent.
We should but children be, that aged seem,
And hugely they :
re imposed on, who do deem Priam and Nestor many years have told:
Not who live long, but happily, are old.
Anon. 1695.
If I judge right, our good old friend, Sir John, Next spring is sixty-three, or thereupon.
Yet it was never known, I've heard it said, That in his life he one day kept his bed ;
Nor ever, but in joke, herd out his pulse, To Sloane, to Mead, to Wilmot, or to Hulse.
If from our life's account we should strike out The hours we lose by fevers or the gout, By spleen, by head-ache, every other ill;
Though we seem old, we are but children still.
If any think Priam or Nestor old, Though o'er the last three centuries had roll'd,
They re much deceived ;
for sense and reason tell, That life is only life when we are well Hay.
Telethusa, skilled in displaying attractive gestures to the sound of her Spanish castanets, and in dancing the sportive dances of Cadiz;
Telethusa, capable of exciting the decrepit Pelias, and of moving the husband of Hecuba at the tomb of Hector;
Telethusa inflames and tortures her former master.
He sold her a slave, he now buys her back a mis­ tress.

She in Gadish gambols bounds;
She a Pelias might beguile, Or the sire at Hector's pile.
For love her former master dies;
Maid he sold her, mistress buys.

A Cilician, a thief of but too notorious rapacity, wished to rob a certain garden ;
but in the whole grounds, large as they were, Fabullus, there was nothing save a marble Priapus.
As he did not wish to return empty-handed, the Cilician stole Priapus himself.

For joyous Cere's foremost yeoman, The wealthy, witty, jolly freeman, Sole tenant of the high and low, Exults mine honest face to show.
Spectator, scan my frame entire;
Nor deem me destined to the fire :
Well mingled with immortals, I In deathless cypress, time defy.
But chief, my beard, thou manly part!
Still bristle, as by Phidian art.

And eye your guardian-god with awe.

We may confess this, Fortune, that that stone now fears not the threats of enemies ;
the Dacian has received our proud yoke with sub­ dued neck, and the victorious shade of Fuscus reposes in a grove which he had made his own.

Lord of th' imperial camp, in luckless hour Here Fuscus lies.
Dread fortune this must own,
No hostile threats can agitate a stone:
Nor vainly with fell Dacia vengeance strove :

When you are poorer than even the wretched Irus, more vigorous than even Parthenopæus,2 stronger than even Artemidorus3 in his prime, why do you delight to be carried by six Cappadocian slaves?
You are laughed at, Afer, and derided much more than you would be were you to walk unattired in the middle of the Forum.
Just so do people point at the dwarf Atlas on his dwarf mule, and the black elephant carrying its Libyan driver of similar hue.
Do you wish to know why your litter brings you into so much ridicule ?
You ought not to be carried, even when dead, on a bier borne by six persons.
5
When poorer yet than Irus thou art deem'd, Than Parthenopæus younger much esteemed, Stronger than wrestlers in their prime and might, Why to be borne by six dost thou delight ?
'T were a less jest, shouldst thou in public go Naked, afoot, than with this pageant show.
The state thou tak'st does more absurd appear
Than if six slaves a seventh, in pomp, should bear:
A Moor upon an elephant of like hue, Would move less laughter 'mong the vulgar crew;
So on a mule as little as himself Mounted, we see, some pigmy little elf.
Wouldst know what scorn thy pride to thee has bred ?
Men grudge that six should bear thee, wert thou dead.

Phryx, a famous drinker, Aulus, was blind of one eye, and purblind of the other.
His doctor Heras said to him, " Be­ ware of drinking;
if you driuk wine, you will not see at all."
Phryx, laughing, said to his eye, " I must bid you tare­ well !" and forthwith ordered cups to be mixed for him in copious succession.
Do you ask the result ?
While Phryx drank wine, his eye drank poison.
Phryx, a stout drinker, who no goblet fear'd,
Though one eye he had lost, and t' other bleer'd:
Who, when physicians bid of wine beware, And threatened blindness, if he had not care, Deriding, said, “ farewell, my other eye;
”
And ten large cups bid fill him by-and-by, And more than once.
Wouldst know the end o' th' prank Phryx soak'd good wine, but his eye poison drank.

Anxious to pay her court to thee, the land of the Nile had sent to thee, Cæsar, as new gifts, some winter roses.
The Memphian sailor felt little respect for the gardens of Egypt, after he had crossed the threshold of your city;
such was the splendour of the spring, and the beauty of balmy Flora;
and such the glory of the Pæstan rose-beds.
So brightly, too, wherever he directed his steps or his looks, did every path shine forth with garlands of flowers.
But do thou, 0 Nile, since thou art compelled to yield to Roman winters, send us thy harvests, and receive our roses.
Egypt did proudly winter roses boast, As the sole product of her fertile coast:
But now at Rome her merchants are surprised To see such store, the Memphian are despised:
Where'er they look, where'er they take their way, Hedges of blushing roses do display.
So does this glory of the spring excel, Not Pestan rosaries more fragrant smell;
Even goddess Flora seems in Rome to dwell.
Let not thy winters, Nile, then vie with ours, Go plough, and send us corn;
we '11 send thee flow'rs.
Anon. 1695.A man, the other day, Rufus, after having diligently contemplated me just as a buyer of slaves or a trainer of gladiators might do, and after having examined me with eye and hand, said, " Are you, are you really, that Martial, whose lively sallies and jests are known to every one who has not a downright Dutchman's ear ?”
I smiled faintly, and with a careless nod admitted that I was the person he supposed. "
Why then," said he, " have you so bad a cloak ? "
I an­ swered, 11 Because I am a bad poet."
That this, Rufus, may not happen again to your poet, send me a good cloak.
Ev'n now one looking on me wistly, and Trying, as butchers doe, with eye and hand, The wares they are to buy, " Art thou," quoth Lee, “That Martiall, whose wanton drollery Is so well known, and valued too so much, By all whose eares are not dull dreary Dutch ?” I smild a little, and with gentle nod Seem'd to confess I was the man.
“ Good God!"
Quoth he, “why are you then so meanly cladd P " " Because," quoth I, " my poetry is badd."
That men your poet may not still thus jeere, Send him, good Rufus, better cloathes to weare.

As much as the fortune of the father of Etruscus I owes to the solicitations of the son, so much, most powerful of princes, do both owe to you ;
for you have recalled the thunderbolt launched by your right hand;
I could wish that the fires of Jupiter were of a similar character.
Would that the all-powerful Thunderer had your feelings, Cæsar;
his hand would then rarely apply its full force to the thunderbolt.
From your clemency Etruscus acknowledges that he has re­ ceived the double boon of being allowed to accompany his father when he went into exile, and when he returned from it.
Whate'er parental love to filial owes, That, chief of chiefs, thy grace on both bestows.
The bolts emitted, thou forbad'st to rove:
Oh, for such temper to the bolts of Jove!
Oh !
did the Thunderer like Cæsar feel, Rare would his hand her total vengeance deal.
Thy double boon Etruscus must admire;
That crown' th' associate, when it call'd the sire.

My sixth book is published without thee, Rufus Camonius, for a patron, and cannot hope to have thee, my friend, for a reader.
The impious land of the Cappadocians, beheld by thee under a malignant star, restores only thy ashes and boned to thy father.
Pour forth, bereaved Bononia, thy tears for thy Rufus, and let the voice of thy wailing be heard throughout the Æmilian Way.
Alas!
how sweet an affection, alas !
how short a life, has departed !
He had seen but just five times the award of prizes at the Olympian games.
0 Rufus, thou who wast wont to read through my trifles with careful attention, and to retain my jests in thy memory, receive this short strain with the tears of thy sorrowful friend, and regard them as incense offered by him who is far removed from thee.
In th' absence, Rufus, my sixth book is out, But thou her reader -lie cloth sadly doubt, Base Cappadocia by a fate unjust Gives to thy friends thy bones, to thee thy dust.
Widow'd Bononia bathe my friend in tears,
While that Æmilia thy griefs echo bears.
How pious !
but how short-lived did he fall!
Five bare Olympiads he had seen in all.

Our sports, and them in memory to find, Accept this sad verse which I send, As the sweet incense of my absent friend.

O wine of Setia, 0 excellent snow, 0 goblets constantly refilled, when am I to drink you with no doctor to prevent me ?

Senseless to a boon so rare, Fool, that would forego the joy, To be golden Midas' heir!

Panaretus, full of wine, called with eloquent finger,2 just at midnight, for a vessel necessary for a certain purpose.
A Spoletan wine-jar was brought to him;
one which he had himself drained to the dregs, but which had not been enough for him, though drinking alone.
Most faithfully measuring back to the jar its former contents, he restored the full quantity of wine to its receptacle.
Are you astonished that the jar held all that he had drunk ?
Cease to be astonished, Rufus ;
he drunk it neat.
When Panaret, maudlin, with snap of the thumb, At midnight commanded the needful to come;
A spoletine came, which himself had just drain'd:
Nor had it sufficed that the flagon contain'd.
With utmost good faith redecanting his store, He crown'd the vast vessel as high as before.
Capacious, you wonder, the pot as the cask!
This pure had imbibed;
which accounts for the task.

Thais smells worse than an old jar of a covetous fuller just broken in the middle of the street;
worse than a goat after an amorous encounter ;
than the belch of a lion;
than a hide torn from a dog on the banks of the Tiber;
than chick rotting in an abortive egg;
than a jar fetid with spoilt pickle.
Cunningly wishing to exchange this disagreeable odour for some other, she, on laying aside her garments to enter the bath, makes herself green with a depilatory, or con­ ceals herself beneath a daubing of chalk dissolved in acid, or covers herself with three or four layers of rich bean-un­ guent.
When by a thousand artifices she thinks she has succeeded in making herself safe, Thais, after all, smells of Thais.
Worse than a fuller's tubb doth Thais stink, Broke in the streets, and leaking through each chink;
Or lion's belch ;
or lustfull reeking goats;
Or skin of dogg that dead o' th' bankside floats;
Or half-hatch d chicken from broke rotten eggs,
Or taynted jarrs of stinking mackrell dreggs :
This vile rank smell with perfumes to disguise, Whene'er she's in the bath, she doth devise ;
She's with pomatum smugg'd, or paint good store, Or oyle of bean-flow'r varnish'd o'er and o'er:
A thousand waves shee tries to make all well;
In vayne, still Thais doth of Thais smell.

RECEIVE the terrible breastplate of the warlike Minerva, which even the anger of the snaky-locked Medusa dreads.
When you do not wear it, Cæsar, it may be called a breast- plate;
when it sits upon your sacred breast, it will be an ægis.
1Cæsar, thy dread Palladian breastplate wear, Which ev'n the Gorgon seems itself to fear:
When on thee buckled, all the ægis know;
But when unarm'd, it doth plain armour show.
Anon, 1695.
Breast late of our lord and master, impenetrable to the arrows of the Sarmatians, and a greater defence than the hide worn by Mars among the Getæ;
breastplate formed of the polished hoofs of innumerable wild hoarse which de­ fies the blows even of an Ætolian spear;
happy is thy lot, to be permitted to touch that sacred breast, and to be warmed with the genius of our god.
Go, accompany him, and mayst thou, uninjured, earn noble triumphs, and soon restore our leader to the palm-decked toga.

Nor fear to rival Mars's Getic hide.
Mail'd with the slipp'ry claws of many a boar, Thee never point of fell Ætolian tore.
Hail, happy cuirass!

To gird a god, and glow with soul divine!
Go, glean, unhurt, thy triumphs o'er the globe;
And soon restore the hero to the robe.

If, Cæsar, you regard the wishes of your people and senate, and the real happiness of the inhabitants of Rome, restore our deity to our urgent prayers.
Rome is envious of the foe that detains him, although many a laurelled letter reaches her.
That foe beholds the lord of the earth nearer than we;
and with thy countenance, Cæsar, the barbarian it as much delighted as awed.
If with thee, Cesar, the desires take place
Of people, senate, all the Roman race, Thy presence graciously to them afford, At their impatient suit, return their lord.
Rome her foes envies, that they thee detain,
Though many laurels she thereby doth gain ;
That barb'rous nations see her prince so near, Enjoy that face which they do so much fear.
Anon. 1695.
Is there then any truth in the report that Cæsar, quitting the northern climes, is at length preparing to return to Ausonia ?
Certain intelligence is wanting, but every tongue repeats this news.
I believe thee, Fame;
thou art wont to tell the truth.
Letters announcing victory confirm the public joy;
the javelins of Mars have their points green with laurel.
Again, rejoice!
Rome proclaims aloud your great triumphs;
and your name, Cæsar, even though it be against your will, resounds throughout your city.
But now, that our joy may have greater grounds for certainty, come your­ self ;
and be your own messenger of your victory over the Sarmatians.
Hark!
from hyperborean shores, Cæsar now his route explores.
Fame, the harbinger of praise, Glads the great Ausonian ways.
What though none assure the bliss ?
Ev'ry voice announces this.
Fame, upon thy lips I dwell;
Truth as thou art wont to tell.
Victor-letters speak the joy:
Martial weapons quell annoy, With their laurel'd point serene:
All is glad, and all is green.
Ios bid thy Rome rebound:
Matchless Cæsar is the sound.
But, the bliss that nought gainsay, Bring thyself the Sarmat bay.

Though the wintry Northern Bear, the barbarous Peuce,1 the Danube warmed by the trampling of horses' feet, and the Rhine, with its presumptuous horn already thrice broken, may withhold thee from us, 0 sovereign ruler of the earth, and father of the world, whilst thou art subduing the realms of a perfidious race, yet thou canst not be absent from our prayers.
Even there, Cæsar, our eyes and minds are with thee;
and so fully dost thou occupy the thoughts of all, that the very crowd in the great Circus know not whether Pas­ serinus is running or Tigris.
2Mid polar ice and Peucian snows, Where with the hoof hard Ister glows;
And rebel Rhine, with broken horn, Still bids thee awe, and still adorn, The kingdoms of a faithless race, That spurn thy guidance and thy grace;
O earth's controller unconfined, Propitious parent of mankind!
Far from our vows thou canst not be:
Our heads and hearts are full of thee.
Nay, all our eyes thou boldest so, That not the vasty Circus know What paragons pretend to shine, A Tigris or a Passerine.

Happy art thou, 0 December, in thy lot;
thou mightest have assumed equality with January, hadst thou given us the joy which he will give us.
The crowned soldier will sport in festal railleries,1 as he walks in procession amid the laurelled steeds.
It is not unbecoming even in thee, 0 Cæsar, to listen to jests and trivial verses;
since the triumphal cele­ bration itself gives a license to amusement.
Now sport, if e'er, ye Muses, with my vein!
From the north world the god returns again.
December first brings forth the people's vote, 'T is just we cry, He comes, with open throat.
Blest in thy chance, from Janus share the day, Since what he'd give, thou givest to us, our joy.
Let the crown'd soldier play his solemn sport, While he attends the bays-invested court;
IT is right, great Cesar, our light jokes to hear, Since that thy triumph them doth love and bear.

As fame I love not at the odious rate Of others' blushes.

she has lost her pet, her delight;
not such as Lesbia, the mistress of the tender Catullus, bewailed, when she was bereaved of her amorous sparrow;
nor such as the dove, sung by my friend Stella, which Iantbis lamented, and whose dark shade now flits in elysium.
My fair one is not capti­ vated by trifles, or objects of affection such as those ;
nor do such losses affect the heart of my mistress.
She has lost a young friend numbering twice six years, whose powers had not yet reached maturity.
What dire disaster gave, alas!
the knell To Delia's joy, I will my Aulus tell.
Her playmate, and her darling, has she lost.
Far other curse the lambent Lesbia cross'd, When of her charmer's killing rogueries reft, Which just Catullus has immortal left.
Other my Stella sang Ianthis' sighs, For the dear dove that in Elysium flies.
My minion ne'er was smit with shafts so mean:
No trivial losses could dismay my queen.
Him, who told years twice ten, does Delia mourn, Whose down was never mow'd, or youthful honours shorn.

This fragment, which you think a common and useless piece of wood, was a portion of the first ship that ventured on un­ known seas, a ship which neither the Cyanean rocks, so fer­ tile in shipwrecks, nor the still more dangerous rage of the Scythian ocean, could formerly destroy.
Time has overcome it;
but, though it has yielded to years, this little plank in more sabred than an entire ship.
This piece thou sees't of rotten, useless wood, Was the first ship that ever ploughed the flood:

Of old could wreck, or Scythian worse than theses Age conquered it;

One plant 's more sacred than the vessel sound.

1695,No one is more pitiable, no one more gluttonous, than Sautra, when he is invited and hurries off to a regular supper to which he has fished for an invitation many days and nights:
he asks three times for boar's neck, four times for the loin, and for the two hips and both shoulders of a hare nor does he blush at lying for a thrush, or filching even the livid beards of oysters.
Sweet cheese-cakes stain his dirty napkin;
in which also potted grapes are wrapped, with a few pomegranates, the unsightly skin of an excavated sow's udder, moist figs, and shrivelled mushrooms.
And when the napkin is bursting with a thousand thefts, he hides in the reeking fold of his dress gnawed fish-bones, and a turtle-dove deprived of its head.
He thinks it not disgrace­ ful, too, to gather up with greedy hand whatever the waiter and the dogs have left.
Nor does solid booty alone satisfy his gluttony;
at his feet he fills a flagon with mingled wines.
These things be carries home with him, up some two hundred steps;
and locks himself carefully in his garret and bars it;
and the next day the rapacious fellow sells them.
When Sanctra long had rioted in dreams, And fed his waking mind with future steams;
To the still panted, pray'd, pursued repast, Him the dear invitation bless'd at last.
But oh !
poor Sanctra, wast thou bless'd or cursed, When on the gorgeous board thine eyeballs burst PThe kernels of the boar he thrice demands:
The loin he four times hints he understands.
To the hare's either hip his spirit springs :
And flutters now to fly on both the wings.
His soul be perjures for a glorious thrush:
He beards the oysters, but he will not crush.
With comfits next behold his napkin graced:
In the same hoard the potted grapes are placed.
Here a few grains of Punic apples lie ;
And there a akin, just scoop'd from out a sty.
Nor is the blear-eyed fig herself forgot;
Nor here forgets the mushroom mash'd to rot.
When the rack'd cloth, by many a hundred rents, Bewrays a thousand thefts, a thousand scents ;
The half-gnaw'd bones he fosters in his breast, Where not the headless dove disdains to rest.
Nor does his dextrous hand abhor the theft
Of the last offals that the dogs have left.
But lo !
he fills, sufficed not thus to eat, With mingled wine the flagon at his feet.
When all ten-score of stairs he home has raised, And ev'ry pow'r, that lent him pow'r, has praised, His treasure he unlocks;
and, strange to tell!
Next morn he condescends-the whole to sell.

Perfidious tongue, that wouldst embroil me with my dear friend Juvenal, what wilt thou not have the audacity to say ?
With thee to coin scandalous stories, Orestes would have bated Pylades;

This I imprecate upon thee, 0 tongue, as a just re­ ward for thy doings and thy audacious attempts, that thou mayst continue to do what I believe thou dost already.
'Perfidious tongue, that wouldst embroil My Juvenal and me!
What faith so pure to stand the soil
Of venom shed by thee ?
At thy surmise, his Pylades Orestes soon would hate ;
For Theseus would, by slow degrees, Pirithous' love abate.
Sicilian brothers thou 'dst divide, Or Atrean, greater name :

nor is a face pleasing, which shows no dimples.
Give children your honey-apples and luscious figs ;
the Chian fig, which has sharpness, pleases my taste.
Since all your lines are only sweet and fine, As is the skinn which with white wash doth shine, Butt nott a come of salt, or dropp of gall, In them;
yett, foole, thou 'dst have me reade them alL Meate has no gust without sharpe sawce ;
no face Without a smiling dimple has a grace:
For children sweete insipid fruits are best;
The quick and poynant only me can feast.
Old MS. 16th CentIn all the epigrams you write we trace
The sweetness and the candour of your face.
Think you, a reader will for verses call, Without one grain of salt, or drop of gall ?
’T is vinegar gives relish to our food :
A face that cannot smile is never good.
Smooth tales, like sweetmeats, are for children fit:
High-season’d, like my dishes, be my wit.
Hay-Go, my Scazons, and pay your respects to Apollinaris;
and, if he be disengaged (for you must not importune him), present him with this collection, whatever may be its worth, a collection in which he himself has a shared May his re­ fined ear grant my verses an audience.
If you find your­ selves welcomed with open brow, you will ask him to support you with his usual favour.
You know his passionate liking for my trifles;
not even I myself could love them more.
If you wish to be safe against detractors, go, my Scazons, and pay your respects to Apollinaris.
Season, to my Apollinaris come;
If hee's not busy (be not troublesome), These frolic lines, wherein himself much shares, Offer t’ th' judgment of his critick ears.
If he receive thee not with a half-looke, With his known favour pray him owne my hooker
Thou know'st how much my trifles he does love ;
I cannot ev'n myself them more approve.
If thou malignant censurers wouldst shunn, Scazon, to my Apollinaris runn.

A wild boar, a devourer of Tuscan acorns, and heavy with the fruit of many an oak, second in fame only to the monster of AEtolia, a boar which my friend Dexter pierced with glitter­ ing spear, lies an envied prey for my kitchen fire.
Let my Penates fatten and exude with the pleasing steam, and my kitchen, festally adorned, blaze with a whole mountain of felled wood.
But, ah!
my cook will consume a vast heap of pepper, and will have to add Falernian wine to the mysterious sauce.
No;
return to your master, ruinous wild-boar:
my kitchen fire is not for such as you;
I hunger for less costly delicacies.
Surely, Sir John, you must have been in liquor, To send a buck unto a country vicar:
The fattest, too, that you have shot this season.
It crowds my kitchen up beyond all reason.
To dress it, I should build my chimney new:
Without a cook, should borrow one of you.
It would consume almost a cord of wood :
Much wine and spice, to make the pasty good.
If I invite my parish;
without doubt, They would confound a hogshead of my stout.
Then take it back ;
for here it can't be drest :
And it is Ember-week,-to fast is best.

So may your grove at Tivoli, consecrated to Diana, grow unceasingly, and your wood, though often cut, hasten to recruit itself;
so may not your olives, fruit of Pallas, be excelled by the presses of Spain ;
so may your vast wine-coolers sup­ ply you with good wine ;
so may the courts of law admire and the palace praise you, and many a palm decorate your fold­ ing doors,1 as, while the middle of December affords you a short vacation, you correct with unerring judgment these trifles which you are now reading.
“Do you wish to hear the truth ?-it is a trying task."
But you can say, Fuscus, what you would wish to be said to yourself.
Soon may your new-cut coppices revive, And your new-planted grove and garden thrive;
May laughing Ceres dance around your fields,
And your press flow with gifts Pomona yields ;
May you a fee receive in every cause, And hall and houses hear you with applause ;
If, in the time the long vacations lend, You read my jokes, and censure as a friend.
I want the truth, still backward to appear:
Tell me, what you yourself would freely hear.

Thestylus, sweet torment of Victor Voconius, thou than whom no youth is better known in the whole city, so mayst thou still, though thy long hair has been cut, retain thy beauty and the affection of thy master, and so may no maiden find favour in the eyes of thy poet-lord, as thou now layest aside for a while his learned compositions, whilst I read to him a few humble verses.
Even by Mæcenas while Virgil sang of his Alexis, the brown Melænis of Marsus was not disregarded.
O thou, Voconius’ painful joy, Thou o'er the globe renowned boy!
So be thou still thy Victor's pride, E'en when thou lay'st thy locks aside;
Nor ministration of the fair With thy complaisance tempt compare:
Such, Thestyl, be thy just reward ;
As thou the labours of thy lord Shalt slily set one moment by, While in his ear some strains I try.
Though Maro, with Alexis smooth, Knew well his patron's soul to soothe;
Mæcenas could a Marsus own, Nor dusk Melænis held unknown.

You grant your favours, Cælia, to Parthians, to Germans, to Dacians;
and despise not the homage of Cilicians and Cappadocians.
To you journeys the Egyptian gallant from the city of Alexandria, and the swarthy Indian from the waters of the Eastern Ocean ;
nor do you shun the embraces of circumcised Jews;
nor does the Alan, on his Sannatic steed, pass by you.
How comes it that, though a Roman girl, no attention on the part of a Roman citizen is agreeable to you?
For Parthians, Germans, thou thy nets wilt spread ;
Wilt Cappadocian or Cilician wed ;
From Memphis comes a whipster unto thee, And a black Indian from the Red Sea;
Nor dost thou fly the circumcised Jew, Nor can the Muscovite once pass by you;
Why being a Roman lass dost do thus ?
tell, Is't 'cause no Roman knack can please so well ?

These shrill-voiced denizens of the hen-coop, these eggs o' the matron hens, these Chian figs made yellow by a moderate heat, this young offspring of a plaintive she-goat, these olives yet too tender to bear the cold, and these vegetables hoary with the cold frosts, do you imagine that they are sent from my country-house?
Oh, how intentionally you mis­ take, Regulus!
my fields bear nothing but myself.
What­ ever your Umbrian bailiff or husbandman, or the Etruscan, or the people at Tusculum, or your country-house three miles from Rome, send to you, is all produced for me in the middle of the Suburra.
If I by chance a pullet have with egg, Of Christmas-lamb if I produce a leg, With winter pease or 'sparagus I treat, You think them sent me from my country-seat.
But you 're deceived;
for you must understand, I am my only stock upon my land.
What Dorking sends, in Leadenhall I found;
In Covent-garden more than Chelsea ground.
Hay,O Atticus, who revives!
the fame of a family renowned for eloquence, and sufferest not a mighty house to fall into ob­ livion, thou art accompanied by the pious votaries of the Cecropian Minerva, thou art pleased with calm retirement, and beloved by every philosopher, whilst other young men are instructed in boxing by a pugilist at the expense of wounded ears, and the greasy anointer carries off their mo­ ney, which he little deserves.
No ball, no bladder, no feather- stuffed plaything prepares thee for the warm baths, nor the harmless blows dealt upon the defenceless wooden image.'
Neither dost thou square thy arms drenched in stiff wrest­ ler's oil;
nor seize at full speed the dusty hand-ball.
Thou only runnest near the glistening Virgin watery and where the bull shows his affection for the Sidonian maiden.
3
For a young man who can run, to indulge in the various sports that every arena presents, is mere idleness.
O Atticus!
who dost thy name attest, Nor lett'st thy mighty house in silence rest!
Thee the Cecropian train must still pursue:
Bland wisdom love thee, and indulgence woo:
While the rough rector batters either ear, Of thine each brave, and each beloved compeer;
Whom the mean dauber lubricates to learn, And riches ravishes he ne'er could earn.
Thee neither ball nor post for bath prepares, Nor the soft liniment for bruising bares
But to the virgin-stream wilt thou retire, Or, where the bull confessed Sidonian fire.
Of all the sports, whatever the ground or growth, To play, when thou canst run, is very sloth.

When your toga, Cinna, is dirtier than mud, and your shoe whiter than the new-born snow, why, foolish man, do you let your garment hang down over your feet ?
Gather up your toga, Cinna;
or your shoe will be quite spoilt.
When in a sordid gown thou lov'st to go, But shoes as white as the new-fallen snow, Why 'bout thy feet thy gown to wear dost use ?
Fool, tuck it up, or it will foul thy shoes.

Do you ask, Severus, how it could come to pass that Cha­ rinus, the very worst of men, has done one thing well ?
I will tell you at once.
Who was ever worse than Nero?
Yet what can be better than Nero's warm baths?
But hark, there is not wanting some ill-natured individual to say, immediately, in a sour tone, " What, do you prefer the baths of Nero to the munificent structures of Domitian, our lord and master ? ”
I prefer the warm baths of Nero to the baths of the debauch.
Is Charinus.
It passes my Severus' ken, How Charm, vilest much of men, Should e'er to praise or profit bring
The greatest or the smallest thing.
What's worse than Nero P brief my terms.
Or better what than Nero's therms ?
Lo! sudden one of malice' tribe Croaks from his putrid mouth his gibe, Preferr'st the bath of an abhorred, To all the bounties of our lord ?
I do prefer, and nothing fights, A Nero's to a catamite's.

When my crazy farm-house, unable to resist the rain and dropping skies, was inundated by the winter floods, there came to me.
sent by your kindness, a supply of tiles, suffi­ cient for a defence against any sudden shower.
Hark!
in.
clement December is roaring with the blast of Boreas;
Stella, you cover the farm-house, and forget to cover the fanner.
1When my crazed house heav’n’s show’rs could not sustain.
But floated with vast deluges of rain, Thou shingles, Stella, seasonably didst send, Which from th' impetuous storms did me defend:
Now fierce loud-sounding Boreas rocks does cleave, Dost clothe the farm, and farmer naked leave ?
Anon. 1695.
Do you know, Castricus, the quaestoris sign of condemna­ tion to death ?
It is worth your while to learn the new Theta.!
He had given orders that every time he blew his nose dropping with cold, the act should be a fatal sign for death.
One day, when furious December was blowing with dripping jaws, an unsightly icicle was hanging from his odious nose.
His colleagues held his hands.
What further do you ask ?
The wretched man, Castricus, was not allowed to blow his nose.
Dost thou know the deadly sign,
That a quæstor could divine ?
It is, Castric, worth thy while, Though the Theta make thee smile.
When the judge his nostrils blew, By the sound a man he slew.
In December's frost and snow, When the floods forgot to flow, From the fatal trump depended Mischief, if not timely mended.
But his colleagues interpose;
Nor can Nosy blow his nose.

O Polyphemus, slave of my friend Severus, you are of such a size and such a form that the Cyclops himself might wonder at you.
Nor is Scylla inferior to you in these respects.
If you bring face to face the awful monstrosities of the two, either will be a terror to the other.
So hewn, and so huge, is Severed Polypheme, A Cyclop with wonder would glare.
Nor Scylla less fell:
did they mutually gleam, The monsters would mutually scare.

Cælius, unable any longer to endure with patience the con­ stant running from place to place, the morning calls, and the pride and cold salutations of the great, began to pretend that he had the gout.
But, while he was over-eager to prove his disease real, and was plastering and bandaging his sound feet, and walking with laboured step (such is the efficacy of care and art in feigned pain) he ceased to feign.
The many runnings to and fro, the paynes
Of morning visitts, waytings on the braynes
Of the proud great ones, Cælius to forbeare Resolves, and take his ease.
Butt yett for feare 0' th’ worst, hee suttly feigns to have the gout ;
Which too much labouring to putt out of doubt, While he swathes up and plasters his sound feet, And with much grelfe pretends to goe or sitt, (To see how well the care and art may speed Of seeming payn'd!) hee's got the gout indeed.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
His lordship’s mornings were in hurry spent, What with a levee, news, and compliment;
That his good lordship was quite wearied out!
And for his ease gave out he had the gout.
'T is fit a man of honour should say true :
To show he did, what did his lordship do ?
His foot, not founder* d, he in flannels bound;
Limp'd on a crutch ;
nor touched with toe the ground.
What may not man with care and art obtain!
By feigning long, his londship did not feign.

Here lies that old man, well known at the court of the emperor, whose favour and whose anger he endured with no mean spirit.
The affection of his children has laid him with the hallowed ashes of his consort;
the Elysian grove holds both.
She died first, defrauded of her youthful prime.
He lived nearly eighteen Olympiads.
But whoever beheld thy tears, Etruscus, thought that he had been snatched from thee prematurely.
Here lyes that good old man in court well knowne For'8 equall temper in both fortunes showne.
His sacred bones here with his wife’s are mixt
By filiall care ;

Near ninety yeeres the Fates unto him lent.
Yett him in haste snatch'd hence all would believe, Who knew how much the world did for him greive.

If any person, Castricus, should wish to rival you in making presents, let him attempt to do so also in making verses.
I am but of small resources in either way, and al­ ways ready to own myself beaten;
hence ease and undis­ turbed quiet charm me.
Do you ask, then, why I have offered you such bad verses ?
I ask you in return, do you imagine that no one ever offered apples to Alcinous ?
If any in rich gifts with thee dare vie, His skill with thee in verse, too, let him try ;
I, poor in both, prepared am to yield, And find much ease by quitting of the field.
Why then ill verses do I thee present P Dost think none e'er Alcinous apples sent ?
Anon. 1695.
The greatest favour that you can do me, Cinna, if I ask anything of you, is to give it me;
the next, Cinna, to refuse it at once.
I love one who gives, Cinna;
I do not hate one who refuses;
but you, Cinna, neither give, nor refuse.
The kindest thing of all is to comply;
The next kind thing is quickly to deny I love performance;
nor denial hate:
Your " Shall I, Shall I ? ” is the cursed state.

This, Quintus Ovidius, is your friend Maximus Cæsonius,1 whose lineaments the living wax still preserves.
Him Nero condemned;
but you dared to condemn Nero, and to follow the fortunes of the exile instead of your own.
You went through the waters of Scylla, a noble companion of his exile;
you who, but a little while before, were unwilling to go with him when he was consul.
If names that I commit to paper are to live, and destiny wills that I should survive my tomb;
present and future generations shall know that you were to im what he was to his friend Seneca.
2
See your great friend Cæsonius, who is gone !
His likeness seems to animate the stone !
Whom Nero censured, spite of tyrant’s hate, You dared acquit, and dared to share his fate.
You, who refused a consul to attend, Attend through dangerous seas an exiled friend.
If any names shall in my writings live, Or if my own my ashes shall survive, Let it in every future age be said, His love to Seneca, that you repaid.
Hay.
This is that Maximus, the powerful friend of the eloquent Seneca, next in his affection to Cams, or more dear to him than Serenus, and whom he salutes with many a charming letter.
You, Ovidius, in whose praise no tongue should be silent, followed him through the Sicilian waves, setting at nought the wrath of a furious tyrant.
Let antiquity ad­ mire her Pylades, who adhered to one exiled by his mother's fury.
Who could compare the dangers defied by the two P You adhered to one exiled by Nero.
Sweet-speaking Seneca's great friend (whom hee More than Serene, next Carus, loved) here see, That Maximus, whose frequent happy name His learn'd epistles recommend to fame.
Him thou, deare Ovid, didst so highly prize
As raging Nero's fury to despise, And him through stormy seas accompany;
Which fame shall speak to all posterity.
Lett old times Pylaaes a wonder make, Who stuck to 's friend banish'd for’s parents' sake:
Who will compare the dangers of these two ?
You Nero's banish'd did stick close unto.

While you are wishing to enhance your present to me by verses,1 Priscus, and endeavouring to speak more eloquently than the mouth of Homer ever spoke, you torture both me and yourself for many days, and still your muse says nothing about what concerns me.
You may send poetry and sounding verses to the rich ;
to poor men give substantial presents.
I understand, to send me you design A present of fine verses, with your wine.
Why will you crack your brain, and break my rest, And make of me your idle Clio's jest ?
Send rhymes to peers;
to poor men send your treasure:
They may, I cannot, wait the Muse'a leisure.

O Licinius Sura, most celebrated of learned men, whose eloquence, savouring of antiquity, reminds us of our mighty ancestors, you are—(oh, by what kindness of the Fates!)— restored to us ;
sent back after having almost tasted the water of Lethe.
Our prayers had lost their fear;
2 our sadness wept without relief;
and it appeared from our tears that you were quite lost.
But the ruler of the silent Avernus feared our displeasure, and has himself restored to the Fates the dis­ taff already snatched from their hands.
Thus you know, then, what lamentations the false report of your death caused amongst your fellow-creatures, and you enjoy what will be said of you by posterity.
Live as though you were stolen from death, and seize fleeting joys, and thus your recovered life will not have lost a single day.0 doctor, leaned as ever fill'd a chair, Whose doctrine's primitive, and life is fair;
What an amazing Providence did save, And thus recall you from the opening grave!
We cease to pray ;
despairing we deplore;
Our tears burst out;
we cry, " He is no more!”
Kind Heaven relented ere it was too late, And sent an angel to retard your fate.
Conscious what sorrow from this rumour came, You now inherit your own future fame.
Lose not one day, that was so kindly given :
Employ each well, in gratitude to Heaven.

Annius has some two hundred tables, and servants for every table.
Dishes run hither and thither, and plates fly about.
Such entertainments as these keep to yourselves, ye pompous ;
I am ill pleased with a supper that walks.

Rich men, take to yourselves these feasts and stir;
I care not for your walking supper, sir.

Is it that he keeps watch over the amorous nymphs, whose manners he so well knows, to prevent so many Hylases from being carried off at once ?
IImperial fountain, fair tanthis’ joy, Thou purest glory of th' enchanted spot!
When thy mild margin beams with many a boy, And thy bright wave beams back the beauteous knot:
Why stands A idea sacred in the grove ?
Why forms the tutelar so close a fence ?
Is it to guard, lest many a nymph should rove ;
And so should ravish many a Hylas hence ?

If you are unwilling, Urbicus, to purchase my trifles, and yet desire to have a knowledge of my sportive verses, go find Pompeius Auctus.
Perhaps you know him ;
he sits in the porch of the temple of Mars the Avenger.
Though deeply imbued with law, and versed in the various usages of civil life, he is not only my reader, Urbicus, but my book itself.
He so faithfully remembers and repeats his absent friend's compositions, that not a single letter of my pages is lost.
In a word, if he had chosen, he might have made himself appear the author;
but he prefers to assist in spreading my reputation.
You may apply to him after the tenth hour 2 of the day, for before that time he will not be sufficiently disengaged;
his little dinner will accommodate two.
He will read ;
you may drink ;
he will recite whether you like it or not:
and after you have said "
Hold, en )ugh!" he will still continue to recite.
If you desire my sportive books to know, Yet care not for them money to bestow, Pompeius Auctus (unknown) from me greet, In Mars Revenger's temple him you '11 meet;
Skill’d in all law and courts:
on him I look, Not as my reader, but my very book.
By heart he has so perfect ev’ry line, That not a tittle can be lost that's mine.
So that the author he might claim to be, Did he not favour both my fame and me.
You may yourself to him, at ten, invite;
From business he is never free till night.
His little supper will admit of two.
He '11 read;
to eat, is all you have to do :
And when you say, Enough, he’ll still go on ;
Nay, though you 're tired, he will not yet have done.
Anon. 1695.
I am delighted, Auctus, that you read my effusions to Celer ;
I mean, if Celer is also pleased with what you read.
He has been governor of my countrymen and the Celtic Iberians, and never was purer integrity seen in our region.
The profound reverence I entertain for him fills me with awe ;
and I regard his ears as those not of an auditor, but of a judge.
Reading my books to Celer pleases me, If what thou read’st to him as pleasing be.
O'er Spain, my native soil, he does preside ;
Such justice in that world did ne'er reside.
So great a man my reverence does excite ;
Not to a reader, but a judge, I write.
Anon. 1695.
You have sent me as a present for the Saturnalia, Umber, everything which you have received during the past five days ;
twelve note-books of three tablets each, seven tooth-picks ;
together with which came a sponge, a table-cloth, a wine­ cup, a half-bushel of beans, a basket of Picenian olives, and a black jar of Laletanian wine.
There came also some small Syrian figs, some candied plums, and a heavy pot of figs from Libya.
They were a present worth, I believe, scarcely thirty small coins altogether;
and they were brought by eight tall Syrian slaves.
How much more convenient would it have been for one slave to have brought me, as be might without trouble, five pounds' weight of silver!
The five days' presents which were given to thee In the Saturnal feasts thou send'st to me.
Twelve three-foot tables, and seven tooth-pickers A sponge, a napkin, and a cup with ears, Two pecks of beans, of olives one small twig, A bottle of coarse Spanish wine to swig.
Small Syrian figs with musty damsins came, A nd a huge cask of Libyan figs o' th' same:
Thy gifts were worth scarce five shillings in an, Which to me sail'd on thy eight Syrians tall.
With how much ease might'at thou have sent, in short, Me five pounds by thy boy, and ne'er sweat for ’t.

Every morning you recount to me your idle dreams about myself, such as may move and alarm my mind.
All my wine of last vintage has been exhausted to the dregs, and even that of the present is failing, while the wise woman is exorcising for me the effects of your nocturnal visions.
I have consumed heaps of salted meal and mountains of frank­ incense ;
my flocks, by the frequent sacrifices of lambs, have altogether dwindled away.
Not a pig, not a fowl of the hencoop, not an egg have I left.
Either lie awake, Naai­ dienus, or sleep and dream for yourself.
There's not a mom that me thou dost not vex
With idle dreams, that may my thoughts perplex:
Which while to expiate thou dost pretend, The wine of two years' vintage to an end Is brought;
salt, meal, whole heaps of gums are spent
And from my dwindling flocks my lambs are sent:
A pig, a hen, an egg, I cannot keep.
Watch, with a pox, or at thine own charge sleep.

The audacious shopkeepers had appropriated to them­ selves the whole city, and a man's own threshold was not his own.
You, Germanicus,1 bade the narrow streets grow wide;
and what but just before was a pathway became a high­ way.
No column is now girt at the bottom with chained wine­ flagons ;
nor is the Prætor compelled to walk in the midst of the mud.
Nor, again, is the barber's razor drawn blindly in the middle of a crowd, nor does the smutty cookshop project over every street.
The barber, the vintner, the cook, the butcher, keep their own places.
The city is now Rome;
recently it was a great shop.
Presumptuous traders did all Rome possess, No bounds did set to such their mad excess:
Caesar the pestered streets did open lay, Where only was a path he made a way;
Ground for their huts or vessels none might hire, To cause the Prætor tread o'er shoes i' th' mire :
And rogues encouraged street arms to bear;
Cooks, barbers, victuallers, all restrained are:
Thy edicts, Cæsar, their encroachments stop;
Rome's Rome again;
't was lately one great shop.
Anon. 1695.
You, who read the imperishable volumes of the ever-living Silius and his verses, worthy of the Roman toga, do you think that Pierian retreats, and ivy chaplets, like those of Bacchus binding the hair of the Aonian Virgins, alone gave pleasure to the poet ?
No!
he did not approach the mysteries of the lofty Virgil until he had accomplished the course pursued by the great Cicero.
The grave centumviral court of the judges still remembers him with admiration;
and many a client speaks of him with grateful lips.
After ruling with the twelve fasces the ever-memorable year which was consecrated by the liberation of the world,1 he devoted his remaining days to the Muses and Phœbus, and now, instead of the forum, cultivates Helicon.
You that read Silius' workes, whose great renown.
Shall ever live, worthy the Latian gowne, Thiak you the poet's was the only prayse Pleased him, and crownes made of the Muses bayes ?
Hee to bee compleat orator attayn'd, Before the sacred busking fame hee gain'd.
Him yet the grave centumviri admire, Him gratefull clients prayse, him yett desire.
His consulship once done, that yeare which free Did sett the world from Nero's tyrannic, From business to the Muses he resorts, And prizes Helicon instead of courts.

16th CentYou, Cinnamus, who were a barber well known over all the city, and afterwards, by the kindness of your mis­ tress, made a knight, have taken refuge among the cities of Sicily and the regions of Ætna, fleeing from the stern justice of the forum.
By what art will you now, useless log, sustain your years ?
How is your unhappy and fleeting tranquillity to employ itself ?
You cannot be a rhetorician, a grammarian, a school-master, a Cynic, or Stoic philosopher, nor can you sell your voice to the people of Sicily, or your applause to theatres of Rome.
All that remains for you, Cinnamus, is to become a barber again.
Thou wast a barber through the city known,
Though by thy mistress raised to the gown Of Knighthood (Cinnamus);
when thou shalt fly
The judgment of the court to Sicily, What art shall then sustain thy useless age P How will thy fugitive rest foot the stage?
Thou canst not be grammarian, rhetorician, Fencer, nor Cynic on any condition, Nor yet a Stoic, nor canst sell thy tongue
Or thy applause in the Sicilian throng:
What then (my Cinnamus) doth yet remain?
Why thou must e'en turn shaver once again.

One suit carried through the three courts,' Gargilianus, is wearing you out, now numbering, as you do, the colds of twenty winters since its commencement.
Wretched, in­ fatuated man!
does any one continue at law for twenty years, Gargilianus, who has the option of losing his suit ?
For twice ten years you to the hall resort;
And now pursue your cause in the third court.
Would any madman let a process last
For twenty years, who sooner could be cast ?

Be cautious, I pray you, Instantius Rufus, it commending the effusions of my muse to your father-in-law;
perhaps he likes serious compositions.
But should he welcome my sport­ ive writings, I may then venture to read them even to Curiua and Fabricius.
My book, to show thy father, friend, forbear;
Perhaps he only likes those serious are :
My wanton verse, if they with him succeed, I dare to Curius and Fabricius read.

This is that Theophila, Canius, who is betrothed to you, and whose mind overflows with Attic learning.
The Athe­ nian garden of the great old man 1 might justly claim her for its own, and the Stoic sect would with equal pleasure call her theirs.
Every work will live that you submit to her judgment before publication, so far is her taste above that of her sex, and of the common herd.
Your favourite Pan­ tænis, however well known to the Pierian choir, should not claim too much precedence of her.
The amorous Sappho would have praised her verses;
Theophila is more chaste than Sappho, and Sappho had not more genius than Theophila.
This,
Canius, is that spouse of thine, from whose Wise breast Cecropian learning sweetely flowes:
Her Epicurus' gardens might have bread, Or Stoick schooles for scholler challenged.
'Twill live whate'er her critick eares doth pass, So little vulgar, womanish, shee has.
Let not Pantsenis too much before her, To th' Muses though well knowne, herself prefer.
The amorous Sappho's self her lines would prize;
This chaster is, and that was ne'er more wise.

The wife is affected withficus;
the husband is affected the daughter, the son-in-law, and the grandson are alike af­ fected.
Nor is the steward, or the farm bailiff, free from the disgusting ulcer;
nor even the sturdy digger or the plough­ man.
When thus young and old alike are affected with this disease, it is a marvellous circumstance that not a single plot of their land produces figs.
1So may December be pleasing to you, Paulus, and so may there come to you neither valueless tablets, nor table-cloths too short, nor half-pounds of incense light in weight:
but may some influential client, or powerful friend, bring you chargers or goblets that belonged to his ancestors, or whatever delights and fascinates you most;
so may you beat Novius and Publius at chess, shutting up their glass men in their squares ;
so may the impartial judgment of the well-oiled crowd of athletes award you the palm in the warm triangular game at ball, and not bestow greater praise on the left-handed strokes of Polybus :
as, if any malignant person shall pronounce verses dripping with black venom to be mine, you lend your voice in my favour, and maintain, with all your might and without remission, "my friend Martial did not write those.
"So, Paulus, may December please, Nor table-books nor toilets tease ;
Nor half-a-pound of incense vain Thine approbation burn to gain :
But potent friend, or client school'd, Present the plates and cups of gold:
Or, when thou aimest archer shafts, So vanquish each adept at drafts:
Of naked fives the manly meed Be thine, so by the judge decreed ;
That not a dext'rous left.

You have a mansion on the Esquiline hill, and a mansion on the hill of Diana;
and another rears its head in the Pa­ tricians' quarter.

From one of your dwellings you behold the temple of the widowed Cybele,2. from another that of Vesta ;
from others you look on the old and the new Capitol.
Tell me where I may meet you;

a man who lives everywhere, Maximus, lives nowhere.
Thou hast a house on the Aventine hill, Another where Diana's worshipped still, In the Patrician street more of them stand, Hence thou beholdst within thine eyes, command The widdowed Cybells, thence Vesta with all, There either Jove earth'd in the Capitol.

O glory of Cyllene and of the skies, eloquent minister of Jove, whose golden wand is wreathed with twisted snakes, so may an opportunity for some fond intrigue never fail thee, whether the Paphian goddess, or Ganymede, be the object of thy affection ;
and so may ther mother'is Ides be adorned with sacred garlands, and thy old grandfather be pressed with but a light burden, as Norbana.
shall ever joyfully keep with her husband Carpus the anniversary of this day on which they first came together in wedlock.
He, as thy pious vo­ tary, consecrates his gifts to wisdom;
he invokes thee with incense, but is faithful at the same time to our Jove.3Cyllene's glory and Olympus' crown, Melodious minister of men and gods!
Whose golden wand, bright emblem of renown, With blooming dragons still connubial nods.
So thee no surreptitious fountain fail, Whether the Paphian or the nymph endear:
So verdant still thy parent's Ides prevail, Nor e'er thy grandsire's load become severe.
Still, with Norbana Carpus hail the day, This day, that ratified the holy bands.
He wisdom's rites her pious priest shall pay:
Thine incense he, while true to Jove he stands.

Though the great hurry you off to their banquets, and walks in the porticoes, and to the theatres;
and though they are delighted, whenever you meet them, to make you share their litters, and to bathe with you, do not be too vain of such attentions.
You entertain them, Philomusus ;
you are not an object of their regard.
When dukes in town ask thee to dine, To rule their roast, and smack their wine, Or take thee to their country-seat, To make their dogs, and bless their meat, Ah!

Thou 'rt not their friend, but their buffoon.

While upon your own table is placed only the tail of a poor Saxetan fish,1 and, when you dine luxuriously, cabbage drenched with oil;
you make presents of sow's udders, wild boar, hare, mushrooms, oysters, mullets.
You have neither sense, Papilus, nor taste.

I have just drunk some consular wine.

It was bottled in the consul's own year;

Inasmuch as Rome now leaves in peace the Getic clime and the hoarse clarions are hushed, you will be able, Fausti­ nus, to send this book to Marcellinus:
now he has leisure for books and for amusement.
And if you wish to enhance your friend's trifling present, let a young slave carry my verses;
not such a one as, fed with the milk of a Getic heifer, plays with Sarmatian hoop upon frozen rivers, but a rosy youth, bought of a Mitylenean dealer, or one from Lace­ dæmon not yet whipped by his mother's order.
My messenger to you will be a slave from the subdued Danube, only fit to tend sheep at Tivoli.
Now Roman peace becalms th' Odrysian shore, Where the shrill trumpet's voice is heard no mOle, To Marcelline my lay, dear Faustin, send ;
An ear to jocund lays the youth may lend.
Yet, fully to ensure my muse's care, The humble boon a modest stripling bear:
Not he, whose cheek the Getic heifer dves ;
Who, on the ice, his hoop Sarmatic plies;
But one of Mitylene's rosy breed;
Or Spartan, by his mother doomed to bleed.
From haughty Ister's now obsequious rocks, A cub shall crawl to tend thy Tibur's flocks.

In this whole book there are thirty bad epigrams;
if there are as many good ones, Lausus, the book is good.
Whilst the barber Eutrapelus is going the round of Luper­ cus's face, and carefully smoothing his cheeks, another beard springs up.
While that the barber went to trim And shave Lupercus' chops and chin, He was so tedious on the face, Another beard grew in the place.

While my portrait is being taken for Cæcilius Secundus,1 ana the picture, painted by a skilful hand, seems to breathe, go, my book, to the Getic Pence 2 and the submissive Danube;
this is his post, among the conquered people.
You will be a little gift to my dear friend, but acceptable:
my countenance will be more truly read in my verse than in the picture.
Here it will live, indestructible by accidents or lapse of years, wheu the work of Apelles shall be no more.
While my Cæcilius to the world would leave
My picture;
and the rare piece seems to breathe;
My book, to Peuce and still Ister go, Held by Secundus from the conquer'd foe.
To him a small, but pleasing, gift thou'lt be, And in my verse, my perfect face he '11 see :
Which neither chance nor pow'r of time can rase, Ev'n when Apelles' works they shall deface.

For sometimes writing quatrains which are not devoid of humour, Sabellus, and for composing a few distichs prettily, I commend you;
but I am not astonished at you.
It is easy to write a few epigrams prettily ;
but to write a book of them is difficult.
That some tetrasticks not amiss you write, Or some few disticks prettyly indite, I like, but not admire.

I used to be invited to your birth-day feasts, before I had become your intimate friend, Sextus.
How has it come to pass, I ask, how has it so suddenly come to pass, that, after so many pledges of affection on my part, and after the lapse of so many years, I, old friend as I am, am not included in your invitations.
But I know the reason ;
I have not sent you a pound of refined silver, or a fine toga, or a warm cloak.
The sportula which is made a matter of traffic, is a sportula no longer.
3
You feed presents, Sextus, and not friends.
But you will now tell me, " I will punish the sla ve omitting to deliver my invitations.
"When but a stranger, to thy birth-day feast I ever, Sextus, was a constant guest.
What 's fallen out ?
What did thy anger move, After so many years and proofs of love, That I, thy ancient friend, am passed by ?
But I myself can tell the reason why.
I sent no plate, no gift to thee I made ;
For thou call'st that a treat, in truth's a trade;
Profit thou seek'st;
thou seek'st not, Sextus, friends. " My man forgot," thou say'st, " his stripes shall make amends.

If my friend Flaccus delights in a long-eared lagolopex ;

if a mischievous ichneumon forms the gratification of Marius ;
if a talkative magpie pleases you, Lausus;
if Glaucilla twines an icy snake round her neck ;
if Telesina has bestowed a tomb on a nightingale;
why shoul d not the face of Labycas, worthy of Cupid himself, be an object of love to him who sees that things so strange furnish pleasure to his betters ?
If Flaccus in an homed owl delight, And Canius in an Ethiope, black as night;
If Publius much a little bitch does love, And Cronius does an ape no less approve;
If Marius a vile Indian mouse affects, If, Lausus, thou a pratling pye respect'st;
Glacilla wreaths about her neck a snake, Another for her bird a tomb does make;
Why may not I admire a lovely face, When monsters, like to these, the others grace ?

It is reported (if fame says true) that the beautiful town of Vienna counts the perusal of my works among its pleasures.
I am read there by every old man, every youth, and every boy, and by the chaste young matron in presence of her grave husband.
This triumph affords me more 1 leasure than if my verses were recited by those who drink the Nile at its very source, or than if my own Tagus loaded me with Spanish gold, or Hybla and Hymettus fed my bees.
I am then really something, and not deceived by the interested smoothness of flattery's tongue.
I shall henceforth, I think, believe you, Lausu.1Vienna fair delights to con my lays:
Nor can we doubt what honest rumour says.
There am I read by ancient, youth, and boy;
By the chaste dame, before her jealous joy.
This gives the Rhone and me more rapid course, Than if they quaff'd who quaff the Nilian source;
Than if my Tagus pour'd his golden bed, My bees if Hybla or Hymettus fed.
Some little then are we;
nor us deceive
The pow'rs of song :

If you want anything, you know it is not necessary to solicit my assistance," is what you tell me two or three times every day.
The stern Secundus calls upon me with harsh voice to repay him.
You hear, Baccara, but do not know what I want.
My rent is demanded of me, loudly and openly, in your very presence:

I complain of my worn-out cloak, that will not protect me from the cold:
you hear, Baccara, but do not know what I want.
I will tell you then what I want;
it is that you may become dumb by a sudden stroke of paralysis, and so be unable to talk to me of what I want.
If need thou hast, thou need'st not me intreat, Baccar, these words thou often dost repeat.

It is winter, and rude December is stiff with ice;
yet you dare, Linus, to stop every one who meets you, on this side and on that, with your freezing kiss, and to kiss, indeed, the whole of Rome.
What could you do more severe or more cruel, if you were assaulted and beaten ?
I would not have a wife kiss me in such cold as this, or the affectionate lips of an innocent daughter.
But you are more polite, more refined, you, from whose dog-like nose depends a livid icicle, and whose beard is as stiff as that of a Cinyphian he-goat,1 which the Cilician barber clips with shears.
I prefer meeting a hundred of the vilest characters, and I have less fear of a recently consecrated priest of Cybele.
If, therefore, Linus, you have any sense or decency, defer, I pray you, your winter salutations till the month of April.
'T is winter, and December's horrid cold Makes all things stark;
yet, Linus, thou lay'st hold On all thou meet'st;
none can thy clutches miss;
But with thy frozen mouth all Rome dost kiss.
What could'st more spightful do, or more severe, Had'st thou a blow o' th' face, or box o' th' ear ?
My wife, this time, to kiss me does forbear, My daughter too, however debonaire.
But thou more trim and sweeter art.
No doubt, Th' icicles, hanging at thy dog-like snout, The congeal'd snivel dangling on thy beard, Ranker than th' oldest goat of all the herd.
The nasty'st mouth it th' town 1 'd rather greet, Than with thy flowing frozen nostrils meet.
If therefore thou hast either shame or sense, Till April comes no kisses more dispense.

Here
I, the child Urbicus, to whom the mighty city of Rome gave both birth and name, repose;
an object of mourning to Bassus.
Six months were wanting to complete my third year, when the stern goddesses broke my fatal thread.
What did my beauty, my prattle, my tender years avail me ?
Thou who readest the inscription before thee, drop a tear upon my tomb.
So may be, whom thou shalt desire to survive thyself, be preserved from the waters of Lethe till he has reached an age greater than that of Nestor.
My parents' grief I here lie in this tomb, Who had my birth and name from mighty Rome :
Six months I wanted of three years to me, When my life's thread was cut by destiny.
What grace shall age, or tongue, or beauty have ?
Thou that read'st this, shed some tears on my grave.
So he that thou wouldst have thyself survive, Shall longer than decrepit Nestor live.

So, Crispinus, may you always see the Thunderer's 2 face, looking serene, and so may Rome love you not less than your own Memphis, as my verses shall be read in the Parrhasian palace;

Take courage to say of me, as a candid reader, " This poet adds something to the glory of thy age, nor is he very much inferior to Marsus and the learned Ca­ tullus."
That is sufficient;
the rest I leave to the god himself.
May'st thou the prince still gracious to thee find, And Rome, no less than Egypt, ever kind;
If, when in court, my verses thou dost hear (For sometimes Cæsar deigns to them an ear), Thou me afford'st this free and candid praise, This man's a glory, Cæsar, to thy days, Yields not to Marsus, Pedo, or the best.

Anon. 1695.ALL my books,
Sire, to which you shave given renown, that is, life, are dedicated to you;
and will for that reason, I doubt not, be read.
This, however, which is the eighth of my col­ lection, has furnished more frequent opportunities of show­ ing my devotion to you.
I had consequently less occasion to produce from my own invention, for the matter supplied the place of thought;
yet I have occasionally attempted to produce variety by the admixture of a little pleasantry, that every verse might not inflict on your divine modesty praises more likely to fatigue you than to satisfy me.
And though epigrams, addressed even to the gravest persons and to those of the highest rank, are usually written in such a manner that they seem to assume a theatrical licence of speech, I have nevertheless not permitted these to speak with any such freedom.
Since, too, the larger and better part of the book is devoted to the majesty of your sacred name, it has to re­ member that it ought not to approach the temples of gods without religious purification.
That my readers also may know that I consider myself bound by this obligation, I have determined to make a declaration to that effect at the com­ mencement of the book in a short epigram:
My book, as you are about to enter the laurel-wreathed palace of the lord of the world, learn to speak with modesty, and in a reverent tone.
Retire, unblushing Venus;
this book is not for thee.
Come thou to me, Pallas, thou whom Cæsar adores.
To th' Took, laurell'd court, seeing thou'rt to go, Learn, book, a chaste and modest speech to know.
No place is left for wanton Venus there;
Pallas.
Cæsarean Pallas, rule does bear.

Janus, the author and parent of our annals, when he re­ cently beheld the conqueror of the Danube, thought it not enough to have several faces,1 and wished that he had more eyes;
then, speaking at once with his different tongues, he promised the lord of earth and divinity of the empire an old age four times as long as that of Nestor.
We pray thee, father Janus, that thou wouldst give the promised term in addition to thine own immortality.
2
When Janus, lord of times, beheld of late Th' imperial victor in triumphant state, Though faces he had two, he thought them few, And wish'd that yet more eyes he had to view.
With both his tongues he said unto our lord, Nestor's four ages I 'II to thee afford.
O father Janus!
thine own also give, That he not long, but may for ever, live.

Five books had been enough;
six or seven are surely too many:
why, Muse, do you delight still to sport on ?
Be mod­ est and make an end.
Fame can now give me nothing more:
my book is in every hand.
And when the stone sepulchre of Messala shall lie ruined by time, and the vast marble tomb of Licinus shall be reduced to dust, I shall still be read, and many a stranger will carry my verses with him to his ancestral home."
Thus had I concluded, when the ninth 5 of the sisters, her hair and dress streaming with per­ fumes, made this reply:
Canst thou then, ungrateful, lay aside thy pleasant trilling ?
Canst thou employ thy leisure, tell me, in any better way ?
Dost thou wish to relinquish my sock for the tragic buskin, or to thunder of savage wars in heroic verse, that the pompous pedant may read thee with hoarse voice to his class, and that the grown-up maiden and ingenuous youth may detest thee?
Let such poems be written by those who are most grave and singularly severe, whose wretched toilings the lamp witnesses at mid­ night.
But do thou season books for the Romans with racy salt;
in thee let human nature read and recognise its own manners.
Although thou mayst seem to be playing on but a slender reed, that reed will be better heard than the trum­ pets of many.
Five had sufficed;
six books or seven do cloy, Why dost as yet delight, my muse, to toy P Give o'er, for shame:
Fame has not more to grace
My verse, the business made in ev'ry place.
And when proud tombs, in which for fame men trust, O'erthrown and broken lie reduc'd to dust, I shall be read, strangers will make 't their care, Unto their several soils my works to bear.
She of the sacred nine (when I had spoke), Whose locks with odours drop, thus silence broke:
And wilt thou then thy pleasant verse forsake ?
What better choice, ungrateful, canst thou make ?
Exchange thy mirthful for a tragic vein;
Thunder harsh wars in an heroic strain;
Which strutting pedants, till they're hoarse, may rant, While the ripe youth detest to hear the cant:
Let the o'er-sour and dull that way delight, Whose lamps at midnight see the wretches write.
But season thou thy lines with sharpest wit, That all may read their vices smartly hit.
Altho' thou seem'st to play but on a reed, Thy slender pipe the trumpet does exceed.
Anon. 1695.
What a world of people, ye gods, is collected at the Roman altars, offering up prayer and vows for its ruler!
These, Germanicus, are not the joys of men only ;
it seems to me that the gods themselves are celebrating a festival.
At Latian altars see conglob'd mankind, Joint vows and Io's for its lord to pay.
Such joys to man alone were ne'er assigned:
The gods themselves do sacrifice to-day.

Hay-There is nothing more hateful than the antique vases of old Euctus.
I prefer cups made of Saguntine clay.
When the garrulous old man boasts the pedigrees of his smoky silver vessels, he makes even the wiue seem musty with his talk. "
These cups belonged to the table of Laomedon;
to obtain which Apollo raised the walls of Troy by the sound of his lyre.
With this goblet fierce Rhoecus rushed to battle with the Lapithæ;
you see that the work has suffered in the struggle.
This double vase is celebrated for having belonged to the aged Nestor;
the doves upon it have been worn bright by the thumb of the hero of Pylos.
This is the tankard in which Achilles ordered wine to be pre­ pared for his friends with more than ordinary copiousness and strength.
In this bowl the beauteous Dido drank the health of Bitias, at the entertainment given to the Phrygian hero."

In leathern jack to drink much less I hate, Than in Sir William's antique set of plate.
He tells the gasconading pedigree, Till the wine turns insipid too as he.
"
This tumbler, in the world the oldest toy,” Says he, “ was brought by Brute himself from Troy.
That handled cup, and which is larger far, A present to my father from the Czar:
See how 't is bruis'd, and the work broken off;
’T was when he flung it at Prince Menzikoff.
The other with the cover, which is less, Was once the property of good Queen Bess:
In it she pledg d duke d'Alençon, then gave it To Drake, my wife's great uncle:
so we have it.
The bowl, the tankard, flagon, and the beaker, Were my great-grandfather's, when he was Speaker."
What pity 't is, that plate so old and fine Should correspond no better with the wine.

Although, Janus, thou givest birth to the swiftly-rolling years, and recallest with thy presence centuries long past ;
and although thou art the first to be celebrated with pious in­ cense, saluted with vows, and adorned with the auspicious purple and with every honour;
yet thou preferrest the glory, which has just befallen our city, of beholding its god return in thy own month.
Dread guardian of the infant year, That opens, but in act to fly ;
Who bidd'st us still the last revere, And keep it in reflexive eye:
Though thee the primal incense hail, Though thee invoke the early vow ;
Glad purple fan thee with her gale, To thee each honour awful bow:
It more bespoke thy gracious nod, As blessing more the Latian town, To see thy month bring back a god, Who could the wish of nations crown.

The Rhine now knows that you have arrived in your own city;
for he too hears the acclamations of your people.
Even the Sarmatian tribes, and the Danube, and the Gets, have been startled by the loudness of our recent exultations.
While the prolonged expressions of joy in the sacred circus greeted you, no one perceived that the horses had started and run four times.
No ruler, Cæsar, has Rome ever so loved before, and she could not love you more, even were she to desire it.
That Cæsar's come to Rome the Rhine does know, So far, so fast, the people's voices go ;
Their iterated shouts the Scythians fright, All nations, whom their joy does not delight.
While in the cirque their Salve's welcome thee, The races they regard not, though they see.
No prince, thyself, was e'er so lov'd before ;
Rome, if she would, she could not love thee more.

Do you ask why I am unwilling to marry a rich wife P
It is because I am unwilling to be taken to husband by my wife.
The mistress of the house should be subordinate to her hus- band, for in no other way, Priscus', will the wife and husband be on an equality.
Dost ask why I'd not marry a rich wife ?
I ’ll not be subject in that double strife.
Let matrons to their heads inferior be, Else man and wife have no equality.

But to me a cell is assigned with un­ glazed windows, in which not even Boreas himself would like to dwell.
Is it thus, cruel man, that you would have your old friend live ?
I should be better sheltered as the com­ panion of your trees.
Your oranges and myrtles, with what cost, You guard against the nipping winds and frost!
The absent sun the constant stoves repair:
Windows admit his beams without the air.
My garret too hath windows, but not glasses;
Where Boreas never stays, but often passes.
For shame!

While the newly-acquired glory of the Pannonian campaign is the universal theme of conversation, and while every altar is offering propitious sacrifices to our Jupiter on his return, the people, the grateful knights, the senate, offer incense;
and largesses from you for the third time enrich the Roman tribes.
These modest triumphs, too, Rome will celebrate;
nor will your laurels gained in peace be less glorious than your former triumphs in war, inasmuch as you feel assured of the sacred affection of your people.
It is a prince's greatest virtue to know his own subjects.
While the Pannonian war new glory sends, And ev*ry altar coming Jove attends;
The people, knights, and fathers, blend the song;
And the third boons enrich the Latian throng.

If, Cirinius, you were to publish your epigrams, you might be my equal, or even my superior, in the estimation of the reading public;
but such is the respect you entertain for your old friend, that his reputation is dearer to you than your own.
Just so did Virgil abstain from the style of the Cala­ brian Horace, although he was well able to excel even the odes of Pindar, and so too did he resign to Varius the praise of the Roman buskin, although he could have declaimed with more tragic power.
Gold, and wealth, and estates, many a friend will bestow;
one who consents to yield the palm in genius, is rare.
So smooth your numbers, friend, your verse so sweet, So sharp the jest, and yet the tone so neat, That with her Martial Rome would place Cirine, Rome would prefer your sense and tnought to mine.
Yet modest you decline the public stage, To fix your friend alone amid th’ applauding age.
So Maro did ;
the mighty Maro sings
In vast heroic notes of vast heroic things,
And leaves the ode to dance upon his Flaccus' stringi.
He scorn'd to daunt the dear Horatian lyre, Though his brave genius flash'd Pindaric fire, And at his will could silence all the lyric quire.
So to his Varius he resign'd the praise
Of the proud buskin and the tragic bays, When he could thunder with a loftier vein, And sing of gods and heroes in a bolder strain.
A handsome treat, a piece of gold, or so, And compliments, will every friend bestow:
Rarely a Virgil, a Cirine we meet, Who lays his laurels at inferior feet, And yields the tenderest point of honour, wit.
Dr. Watts, Hota Lyricæ
In epigram so happy is your strain, You might be read, and I might write in vain:
But your regard to friendship so sincere, Your own applause, than mine, you bold less dear.
So Maro left to Flaccus Pindar's flight, Able himself to soar a nobler height:
And, warm'd with a superior tragic rage, To Vanus gave the honour of the stage.
Friends oft to friends in other points submit ;
Few yield the glory of the field in wiL Hay-Cinna wishes to seem poor, and is poor.

Phosphorus (Morning Star), bring back the day;
why dost thou delay our joys?
When Cæsar is about to return, Phos­ phorus, bring back the day.
Rome implores thee.
Is it that the sluggish wain of the tame Bootes is carrying thee, that thou corner with axle so slow P
Thou shouldst rather snatch Cyllarus from Leda's twins;
Castor himself would to-day lend thee his horse.
Why dost thou detain the impatient Titan?
Already Xanthus and Æthon long for the bit, and the benign parent of Memnon is up and ready.
Yet the lingering stars refuse to retreat before the shining light, and the moon is eager to behold the Ausonian ruler.
Come,

although the stars stand still, day will not be absent from thy people when thou comest.
Phosphor, bring light;
why dost our joys delay?
Cæsar ’s to come;
Phosphor, bring on the day.
Rome begs it.
Art drawn in Bootes' team, Thou mov'st so slowly with a lazy beam ?
Castor will not refuse that thou should’st mount
His swift-foot Cyllaros on this account.
Impatient Titan why dost thou detain ?
Xanthus and Æthon both desire the rein;
Aurora waits;

If I chance in my timid and slender book to make any request of thee, grant it, unless my pages are too presump­ tuous.
Or, if thou dost not grant it, Cæsar, still permit it to be made;

It is not he who fashions divine images in gold or marble, that makes them gods, but he who offers supplications to them.
If I in fear chance to petition thee, If I'm not impudent, vouchsafe it me.

The huntsman on the banks of the Ganges, looking pale as he fled on his Hyrcanian steed, never stood in fear, amid the Eastern fields, of so many tigers as thy Rome, 0 Ger­ manicus, has lately beheld.
She could not even count the objects of her delight.
Your arena, Cæsar, has surpassed the triumphs of Bacchus among the Indians, and the wealth and magnificence of the conquering deity;
for Bacchus, when he led the Indians captive after his chariot, was content with a single pair of tigers.
On Ganges' banks, who spoils the wood or mead, And paly flies on the Hyrcanian steed, Ne'er saw, Germanic, as thy Rome, such sights :
Nor can she number all her new delights.
The Erythrean triumphs yield to thine;
The pow'r terrestrial and the wealth divine ;
For, when the car the captive Indians trod, A brace of tigers drew the victor-god.

Say, toga, rich present from my eloquent friend, of what flock wert thou the ornament and the glory ?
Did the grass of Apulia and Ledæan Phalantus1 spring up for thee, where Galæsus irrigates the fields with waters from Calabria ?
Or did the Tartessian Guadalquivir, the nourisher of the Iberian fold, wash thee, when on the back of a lamb of Hesperia ?
Or has thy wool counted the mouths of the divided Timavus, 2 of which the affectionate Cyllarus, now numbered with the stars, once drank?
Thee it neither befitted to be stained with Amyclæan dye, nor was Miletus worthy to receive thy fleece.
Thou surpasses!

The swan of Sparta and the doves of Paphos must yield to thee;
and even the pearl fished from the Indian seas.
But though this be a present that vies with new-born snows, it is not more pure than its giver Parthenius.
I would not prefer to it the embroidered stuffs of proud Babylon, de­ corated with the needle of Semiramis;
I should not admire myself more if dressed in the golden robe of Athamas, could Phrixus give me his Æolian fleece..
But oh what laughter will my worn-out ragged cloak excite, when seen in company with this regal toga !
Say, grateful gift of mine ingenious friend, What happy flock shall to thy fleece pretend ?
For thee did herb of fam'd Phalantus blow, Where glad Oalesus bids his waters flow ?
Or did Tartessian Bætis also lave Thy matchless woof, in his Hesperian wave?
Did thy wool number streamlets more than seven, Of him who slak'd the warrior-horse of heaven ?
Amyclæ's bane ne'er harrow'd up thy hair :
Miletus never boasted fleece so fair.
To thee the lily fades, the privet 's pale ;
And all the blanching pow rs of Tibur fail.
The Spartan swan the Paphian doves deplore, The pearls their hue on Erythrean shore.
But, though the boon leave new-fall'nsnows behind.
It in not fairer than the donor's mind.
A Babylonish vest I'd ne'er pursue, A vest the Semiramian pencil drew;
Old Athamas's gold 1 d proudly mock, Would Phrixus give me an Æolian flock.

My threadbare cloak upon th' imperia gown!

The spectacle which is now presented to us on Cæsar's arena, was the great glory of the days of Brutus.
See how bravely the hand bears the flames.
It even enjoys the punishment, and reigns in the astonished fire!
Scævola himself appears as a spectator of his own act, and applauds the noble destruction of his right hand, which seems to luxuriate in the sacrificial fire;
and unless the means of suffering had been taken away from it against its will, the left hand was still more boldly preparing to meet the van­ quished flames.
I am unwilling, after so glorious an action, to inquire what he had done before;
it is sufficient for me to lave witnessed the fate of his hand.

A gentle dove, gliding down through the silent air, settled in the very lap of Aretulla as she was sitting.
This might have seemed the mere sport of chance, had it not rested there, although undetained, and refused to depart, even when the liberty of flight was granted it.
If it is permitted to the affectionate sister to hope for better things, and if prayers can avail to move the lord of the world, this bird is perhaps come to thee from the dwelling of the exile in Sardmia, to announce the speedy return of thy brother.

You send me, Paulus, a leaf from a Prætor’s crown, and give it the name of a wine-cup.
Some toy of the stage has perhaps recently been covered with this thin substance, and a dash of pale saffron-water washed it off.
Or is it rather a piece of gilding scraped off (as I think it may be) by the nail of a cunning servant from the leg of your couch ?
Why, it is moved by a gnat flying at a distance, and is shaken by the wing of the tiniest butterfly.
The flame of the smallest lamp makes it flit about, and it would be broken by the least quantity of wine poured into it.

The god of day looks upon nothing in the whole world more splendid.
Its seven towers seem to rise together like seven mountains;
Ossa was less lofty surmounted by the Thessalian Pelion.
It so penetrates the heavens, that its pinnacle, encircled by the glittering stars, is undisturbed by thunder from the clouds below, and receives the rays of Phœbus before the nether world illumined, and before even Circe beholds the face of her rising father.
Yet though this Palace, Augustus, whose summit touches the stars, rivals heaven, it is not so great as its lord.

Oh fie, ma'am, Venus, end this rout Commit them to the Fleet, And grant they may be carried out, Both buried with one sheet Rev. Mr. Scott, 1773.
I admonish you, TituRius, enjoy life;
it is already late to do so;
it is late, even to begin under the schoolmaster.
But you, miserable Titullus, are not even enjoying life in your old age, but wear out every threshold with morning calls, and all the forenoon are covered with perspiration, and slobbered with the kisses of the whole city.
You wander through the three forums,1 in face of all the equestrians, the temple of Mars, and the colossus of Augustus;
you are run­ ning about everywhere from the third to the fifth hour.
2 Grasp, accumulate, spare, and hoard as you will, you must leave all behind you.
Though the splendid coffer be pale3 with closely packed silver coins, though a hundred pages of kalends4 be filled with your debtors' names, yet your heir will swear that you have left nothing, and, whilst you are ly­ ing upon your bier or on the stones, while the pyre stuffed with papyrus is rising for you, he will insolently patronize your weeping eunuchs;
and your sorrowing son, whether you like it or not, will caress your favourite the very first night after your funeral.
'Tis late:
begin to live, old gentleman:
It would be late, if you at school began.
You a long race of misery have run;
But have not yet the race of life begun.
Your every morning is in labour spent, This man to dun, or that to compliment.
With dirty stockings you to Hall resort, A well-known party now in every court.
Through every quarter of the town you range, Guild-hall, the Bank, the Custom-house, the ’Change.
Heap, scrape, oppress, use every fraudful art;
Oh!
dismal thought!
your wealth and you must part
Of cash and mortgages though nuge your store
Your graceless son will wonder 'tis no more.
And when the plumes shall o'er your coffin wave, And Sable's venal train attend your grave, Chief mourner he, and heir to your embrace, Shall with your whore that night supply your place.
HayPriscus Terentius, my dear Flaccus, is restored to me from the coast of Sicily;
let a milk-white gem mark this day.
Let the contents of this amphora, diminished by the lapse of a hundred consulships,1 flow forth, and let it grow brighter, turbid as it now is, strained through the purifying linen.
2
When will a night so auspicious cheer my board ?
When will it be mine to be warmed with wine so fitly quaffed ?
When Cytherean Cyprus shall restore you, Flaccus, to me, I shall have equally good reason for such indulgence.
My Priscus, lo !
retum'd from Ætna’s height!
The gem, that marks this day, be purest white.
Flow, fining cask, from out the deep recess:
The hundredth consul has just made it less.
When shall with such a joy my table shine P
When feel the fervours of so fair a wine P When Cyprus thee, my Flaccus, shall restore, Wise luxury again shall have her lore.

How great is thy innocent simplicity, how great the childish beauty of thy form, youthful Cestus, more chaste than the young Hippolytus!
Diana might covet thy society, and Doris desire to bathe with thee:
Cybele would prefer to have thee all to herself instead of her Phrygian Atys.
Thou mightest have succeeded to the couch of Ganymede, but thou, cruel boy, wouldest have given kisses only to thy lord Happy the bride who shall move the heart of so tender a husband, and the damsel who shall first make thee feel that thou art a man !
How great ’s thy virtue, and thy form how rare!
Theseus' chaste son cannot with thee compare.
For all the glory of her virgin name, To bathe with thee, Diana, would not shame.
And whom might Cybele alone enjoy, She would prefer before her Phrygian boy.
Ganymede's place didst thou to Jove supply, Juno thou would'st redeem from jealousy.
Happy ’s the maid shall thy soft breast inflame, And give thee first a man's and husband's name.
Anon. 1695.
Part of your face is clipped, part shaven, part has the bair pulled out.
Who would think that you have but one head P Part of thy hair is shorn, part shaved to thee, Part pull'a:

While your cheeks are part shav'd, scrap'd, and part pluck'd away, Who the devil can think you've but one head, I pray P Rev. Mr Scott, 1773.
Crispinus does not know to whom he gave his Tyrian mantle, when he changed his dress at the bath, and put on his toga.
Whoever thou art that hast it, restore to his 4 shoulders, I pray thee, their honours;
it is not Crispinus, but his cloak, that makes this request.
It is not for every one to wear garments steeped in purple dye;
that colour is suited only to opulence.
If booty and the vicious craving after dishonourable gain possess you, take the toga, for that will be less likely to betray you.
When at the bath Crispinus did undress, To whom he gave his robe he cannot guess.
Restore the spoil, whoever has it, pray.
Not this Crispinus, but the robe, does say.
A scarlet gown is not for all men's wear, Who are not noble, this rich dye forbear.
If theft delights thee, a dishonest prize, Avoid what will betray thee, if thou 'rt wise.
Anon. 1696.
Asper loves a damsel;
she is handsome certainly, but he is blind.

Blind Asper loves a lass that beauteous is, And, as it seems, he loves more than he sees.

Great as is reported to have been the feast at the triumph over the giants, and glorious as was to all the gods that night on which the kind father sat at table with the inferior deities, and the Fauns were permitted to ask wine from Jove;
so grand are the festivals that celebrate thy victories, O Cæsar;
and our joys enliven the gods themselves.
All the knights, the people, and the senate, feast with you, and Rome partakes of ambrosial repasts with her ruler.
Thou promisedst much;
but how much more hast thou given!
Only a sportula was promised, but thou hast set before us a splendid supper.
As was that ovant feast, night swell’d with joy, After that Jove the giants did destroy, And vulgar gods, together with the great, Benignly at his heavenly table treat;
And Fauns and Satyrs were allow'd to call Freely for nectar i' th' Olympian hall Such was that genial feast, triumphant state, When Caesar did his laurel consecrate, And gods, as well as men, exhilarate.
Patricians, people, knights, all Rome, did eat With their great lord of his ambrosian meat;
Great things thou promised, greater didat bestow;
Not for a dole, but royal feast we owe.
Anon. 1695.
Whose workmanship is displayed in this cup ?
Is it that of the skilful Mys, or of Myron P Is this the handiwork of Mentor, or thine, Polycletus?
No tarnish blemishes its brightness, its unalloyed metal is proof against the fire of the assayer.
Pure amber radiates a less bright yellow than its metal;
and the fineness of its chasing surpasses the carving on snowy ivory.
For the work is not inferior to the material;
it surrounds the cup, as the moon surrounds the earth, when she shines at the full with all her light.
Em­ bossed on it is a goat adorned with the Æolian fleece of the Theban Phrixus;
1 a goat on which his sister would have pre­ ferred to ride;
a goat which the Cinyphian shearer would not despoil of his hair, and which Bacchus himself would al­ low to browse on his vine.
On the back of the animal sits a Cupid fluttering his golden wings;
and a Palladian flute made of the lotus seems to resound from his delicate lips.
Thus did the dolphin, delighted with the Methymnæan Arion, convey his melodious rider through the tranquil waves.
Let this splendid gift be filled for me with nectar worthy of it, not by the hand of a common slave, but by that of Cestus.
Cestus, ornament of my table, mix the Setine wine;
the lovely boy and the goat that carries him both seem to be thirsty.
Let the letters in the name of Instantius Rufus determine the number of the cups that I am to drink;
for be is the donor of this noble present.
If Telethusa comes and proffers me her promised entertainment, I shall confine myself, Rufus, for the sake of my mistress, to the third part of the letters in your name;
3 if she delays, I shall indulge in seven cups;
if she disappoints me altogether, I shall, to drown my vexation, drain as many cups as there are letters in both your name and hers.
What paynes, what skill, did this cupp's forme command ?
Was't Myos', Myron's, or bold Mentor's hand ?
Cleare and untarnished no pale cloud it bears,
The metal no fyre's searching tryall feares.
The yellow gold pure amber doth outvie, The embossed silver whitest ivory.
The skill equalls the stuff;
such orbes combines
As when the moone in her full lustre shines.
There Phryxus’ goat with 's golden fleece doth swim
So lively, Helle d choose to ride on him;
So trim, no hair a barber needes, and thou, Bacchus, wouldst lett him browze on thy vine-bough.
Cupid, with golden wings, sitting on's back, With pipe in's pretty mouth dot musick make:
With harp and voice so did Anon please
The dolphin bearing him through toylsome seas With richest nectar, worthy such a cup, Nott by a common hand, butt thine, fill’d up, Give't mee, deare Cestus, lovely boy;
meethinks Both goate and Cupid thirst for Setian drinks.
To every letter of his name who gave Mee this so precious bowle, a round wee’ll have.
If Telethusa come, I must reserve Myself for those sweet joyes;
then five shall serve:
If shee bee doubtful, sev'n;
if shee fayle quite, To drown my griefes, I'll drink both names outright.
Old MS. 16th Cent.Cædicianus, I lent my barber (a young man, but skilled in his art even beyond Nero's Thalamus, whose lot it was to clip the beards of the Drusi) to Rufus, at his request, to make his cheeks smooth for once.
But, at Rufus's orders, he was so long occupied in going over the same hairs again and again, consulting the mirror that guided his hand, cleaning the skin, and making a tedious second attack on the locks previously shorn, that my barber at last returned to me with his own beard full grown.
A boy, of so consummate art, When call'd to play the barber's part, As had not for a rival fear’d
The trimmer of a Nero's beard ;
To smug the cheek of Rufus, once I lent;
nor deem'd myself a dunce.
While o'er and o'er each hair he glides, A faithful glass his fingers guides;
And now he gives the skin to glow, While far and wide he draws the mow;
Behold a wondrous thing, and new!
The shaver's down a harvest grew.

Most beautiful of all women that are or have been, but most worthless of all that are or have been, oh!

Although you make so many liberal donations, and promise even to exceed them, 0 conqueror of many leaders, as well as conqueror of yourself, you are not loved of the people, Cæsar, for the sake of your bounties, but your bounties are loved by the people for your sake.

The people love thee not cause they partake
Thy blessings;

Loud as are the roarings heard through the trackless regions of Massylia, when the forest is filled with innumerable raging lions, and when the pale shepherd recalls his astonished bulls and terrified flock to his Punic huts, so loud were ter­ rific roarings lately heard in the Roman arena.
Who would not have thought they proceeded from a whole herd ?
There was, however, only one lion, but one whose authority the lions them­ f'elves would have respected with trembling, and to whom Numidia, abounding in variegated marble, would have given the palm.
Oh what majesty sat upon his neck, what beauty did the golden shade of his arched neck display as it bristled!
How apt for large hunting spears was his broad chest, and what joy did he feel in so illustrious a death!
Whence, Libya, came so noble an ornament to thy woods ?
From the car of Cybele?
Or, rather, did thy brother, Germanicus, or thy father himself, send down the mighty animal from the con­ stellation of Hercules ? 1
Like the amazing terrors which resound In Libyan pastures, and adjoining ground, When herds of lions rage in forests nigh, And make the fiercest bulls and shepherds fly Home to their holds, ready through fear to die:
Such was the roaring late i' th' place of game;
A troop of lions seem'd to make the same;
It was but one, but one all else did dread, And paid subjection to his crowned head.
Oh, what a horrid grace his neck did show!
Down to his feet his curled mane did flow:
His large-spread breast for largest spears did call;
Great was the fear and triumph at his fall Like glory Libyan coasts ne'er sent before, Nor Ida ever saw in all her store:
Was't not the same t' Alcides gave renown, And by thy father from the stars sent down ?
Anon. 1695.
As the age of our ancestors yields to our own, and as Homo has grown greater with her ruler, you wonder that genius like that of the divine Virgil is nowhere found among us, and that no poet thunders of wars with so powerful a clarion.
Let there be Mæcenases, Flaccus, and there will be no want of Virgils;
even your own farm may furnish you with a Maro.
Tityrus had lost several acres in the neighbourhood of poor Cremona, and was sadly mourning over the loss of his sheep.
The Tuscan knight 1 smiled on him, repelled harsh poverty from his door, and bade it quickly take to flight.
" Accept," said he, “ a portion of my wealth, and be the greatest of bards;
nay, thou mayst even love my Alexis."
That most beautiful of youths used to stand at his master's feasts, pouring the dark Falernian with hand white as marble, and to present him the cup just sipped with his rosy lips;
lips which might have attracted the admiration of Jupiter himself.
The plump Ga­ latea, and Thestylis, with her ruddy cheeks burnt by the har­ vest sun, vanished from the memory of the inspired bard.
Forthwith he sang of Italy, and Arms and the man,”—he, whose inexperienced strain had scarcely sufficed to lament a gnat.
2
Why need I mention the Varii 3 and Marsi,4 and other poets who have been enriched, and to enumerate whom would be a long task P Shall I, then, be a Virgil, if you give me such gifts as Mæcenas gave him ?
I shall not be Virgil;
but I shall be a Marsus.5
Since never was an age so happy yet;
So great the nation or the prince so great;
You wonder that no Addisons remain, No bard to sing a fortunate campaign.
Let but Mæcenas, Virgil will, revive:
Ev'n your own villa may a Virgil give.
When Tityrus bewail'd his flocks so dear;
And to Cremona farms, alas!
too near ;
Benevolently smil'd the Tuscan knight, And put malignant poverty to flight.
A poet be, and take my purse, he said;
Take what you like;
take ev*n my favourite mail:
Attendant at his board the damsel stands;
And fills his claret with her lily hands;
Sips it with rosy lips, which might inspire With wanton thoughts the virtue of a friar.
Fat Galatea haunts his soul no more;
Nor Thestylis, his sun-burnt country whore.
He, who once humble themes pursued, then sung “ Arms and the man whence Roman grandeur sprung."
'Twere endless to recount each laurel'd shade Rich and immortal by such bounty made.
I '11 Virgil be, might I like favours hope:
No:
'tis not Virgil I will be, but Pope.

Picens had three teeth, which he coughed out all together one day, as he was sitting at the place destined for his tomb.
He collected in his robe the last fragments of his decayed jaw, and buried them under a heap of earth.
His heir need not collect his bones after his death;
Picens has already per­ formed that office for himself.
Old Picens had three teeth which from him come
As he sat coughing hard over his tomb:
Which fragments he took up into his breast, Dropp'd from his mouth:
then laid his bones to rest.
Lest that his heir should not them safely see Interred, he did himself the curtesy.

Do you see this fellow, who has but one eye, and under whose scowling forehead yawns a blind cavity for the other ?
Do not despise that head;
none was ever more acquisitive;
nor were even the fingers of Autolycus more sticky.
Be cautious how you make him your guest, and watch him closely, for on such occasions he makes one eye do the duty of two.
The anxious servants lose cups and spoons;
and many a napkin is warmed in the secret folds of his dress.
He knows how to catch a cloak as it falls from the arm of a neigh­ hour, and often leaves the table doubly clad.
He even feels no remorse in robbing the slumbering slave of his lighted lamp.
If he fails to lay hands on anything belonging to others, he will exercise his thievish propensity on his own servant, and steal his slippers from him.
See you that fellow, with a hardened front, One eye with patch, and one with knave upon 't P Revere in him the captain of the band Once ruled by Wild ;
more gluey is his hand.
At table with him take care what you do, His eye will be more watchful than your two.
He '11 make the servants hunt for spoons;
and clap
His napkin in his breeches, not his lap.
Whip up a handkerchief, that 's fallen down, Or slip another joseph on his own.
His own portmanteau carry off unseen, And charge it on the master of the inn.

Charinus is pale and bursting with envy;
he rages, weeps, and is looking for a high branch on which to hang himself;
not, as formerly, because I am repeated and read by everybody, or because I am circulated with elegant bosses, and anointed with oil of cedar, through all the nations that Rome holds in subjection ;
but because I possess in the suburbs a summer country-house, and ride on mules which are not, as of old, hired.
What evil shall I imprecate on him, Severus, for his envy ?
This is my wish:
that he may have mules and a country-house.
Vipers ne'er cease to gnaw Carinus' breast, Anguish and grief his quiet to molest;
His envy rages to that nigh degree, To hang himself he only wants a tree.
Not 'cause my book 's now richly gilt and bound, Myself and verse through all the world renown'd:
But I've a house near Rome, and on the score, I 'm drawn with mules, not hired, as heretofore.
What shall I wish, th' envious to repay ?
I wish, on him that Fortune also may A farm bestow near town, and men may tell
That mules he drives, and roots and herbs does sell.

Aulua loves Thestylus, and yet he is not less fond of Alexis;
perhaps he is also growing fond of my Hyacinthus.
Go, now, and resolve me whether my friend Aulus loves poets them­ selves, when he loves what the poets hold dearest.
On Thestylus, nor on Alexis less;
Nay, on our Hyacinth he dotes beyond.
Who for the bards can Aulus' love express, When of their fav'rites Aulus proves so fond ?

For the purpose of asking and exacting presents, Clytus, your birth-day falls eight times in one year;
and you count, I think, only three or four first days of months that are not an.
niversaries of your coming into the world.
Though your face is smoother than the polished stones of the dry shore;
though your hair is blacker than the mulberry ready to fall;
though the soft delicacy of your flesh surpasses the feathers of the dove, or a mass of milk just curdled;
and though your breast is as full as that which a virgin reserves for her husband you already, Clytus, seem to me to be an old man;
for who would believe that Priam and Nestor had as many birth-days as you P Have some sense of moderation, and let there be some limit to your rapacity;
for if you still carry on your joke, and if it is not enough for you to be born once a year, I shall not, Clytus, consider you born at all.
More gifts more clearly still to crave, Each yeere eight birth-dayes you will have ;
And of twelve months scarce four, or three, Wherein you were not born there bee.
Though your downe chin be smoother far Than on dry beach worne pebbles are;
More black than mulberrys your hayre;
Than feathers trembling in the ayre Your breasts more soft, than curds and cream.
More swell'd and plump, or more than them To husband's bedd greene virgins bring, You are an old man in your spring.
For who'd believe Priam, or old Nestor, so many birth-dayes told ?
For shame, at length your greedy minde Stint;
for if still theise tricks we finde, And once a yeere suffice not you, We 'll think none of your birth-dales true.

Here, where the temple dedicated to returning Fortune glistens resplendent far and wide, was formerly a spot of ground of great celebrity.
Here Domitian, graced with the dust of the Sarmatian1 war, halted, his countenance radiating with glory.
Here, with locks wreathed with bays, and in white garb, Rome saluted her general with voice and gesture.
The great merits of the spot are attested by the other monuments with which it has been honoured;
a sacred arch is there erected in memory of our triumphs over subdued nations.
Hero two chariots 2 number many an elephant yoked to them;
the prince himself, cast in gold, guides alone the mighty team.
This gate, Germanicus, is worthy of thy triumphs;
such an entrance it is fit the city of Mars should possess.
Where to returning Fortune now we build Vast glittering temples, lately was that field
Where, lovely in the dust of warr, such grace, Such lustre shin'd from Cæsar's ruddy face;
Where in white roabes, their heads with lawrel crown'd, Rome welcomed him with hands' and voyces' sound.
There, for that place's greater worth and glory, On arch triumphant stands that conquest's story;
Where Cæsar, all in gold, on chariotts rides, And the huge elephants that draw them guides.
Such conquests meritt such a noble roome, And such gates Mars's city best become.

Give to the emperor, ye Muses, sacred incense and victims on behalf of your favourite Silius.
See, the prince bids the twelve fasces return to him in the consulship of his son, and the Castalian abode of the poet resound with the rod of power knocking at his door.
0 Cæsar, chief and only stay of the empire, still one thing is wanting to the wishes of the rejoic­ ing father,—the happy purple and a third consul in his family.
Although the senate gave these sacred honours to Pompey, and Augustus to his son-in-law,1 whose names the pacific Ja­ nus thrice ennobled,2 Silius prefers to count successive con­ sulships in the persons of his sons.
To Cesar let your incense rise, To him your victims fall:
Ye Nine, salute th' auspicious skies;
And let us carol all.
The twice six bundles bids the god Upon the son rebound;
And, with the welcome awful rod, The dome Castalian sound.
Augustus, thou supreme of things;
Their primal, single stay!
To thee thine own Thalia flings Th' unmeditated lay.
While thou enjoy'st to crown my joy, A twofold wish remains:
For bliss upon th' empurpled boy, And for a third the reins.
To Pompey though the Fathers gave, And Cæsar to his son, The honours of the wise and brave, Which they alone have won;
Though peaceful Janus three times threw A glory round each name;
My Silius would acquire, in two, A higher threefold fame.

He who has seen the orchards of the king of Corcyra, will prefer the garden of your country-house, Entellus.
That the malicious frost may not nip the purple clusters, and the icy cold destroy the gifts of Bacchus, the vintage lives protected under transparent stone;
4 carefully covered, yet not con- cealed.
Thus does female beauty shine through silken folds;
thus are pebbles visible in the pellucid waters.
What is not nature willing to grant to genius ?
Barren winter is forced to produce the fruits of autumn.
He who hath seen the gardens at Versailles, When he sees yours, will think their beauty fails.
Here, lest the purple branch be scorch'd by frost, And Bacchus' gifts by cold devouring lost, Shut in the glass the living vintage lies, Securely cloath'd, yet naked to the eyes.
Through finest lace so female graces beam;
Pebbles are counted in the lucid stream.
What will not nature yield to human skill ?
When sterile winter shall be autumn still.

Great as is the placidity, equally great is the eloquence of the quiet Nerva;
but his modesty restrains his powers and his genius.
When he might with large draughts have drained the sacred fountain of the muses, he preferred to keep his thirst within bounds;
he was content to bind his inspired brow with a modest chaplet, and not to crowd all sail for fame.
But whoever is acquainted with the verses of the learned Nero, knows that Nerva is the Tibullus of our day.
Of spirit gentle, as of genius strong, His modesty alone can do him wrong.
When all Permessis his one draft might drain, He bids his thirst, however keen, refrain.
Content with slender wreath to bind his brow, He will not to his fame her sail allow.
Yet him the sweet Tibullus of our days Each critic owns, who honours Nero's lays.

Ten years ago, Postumianus, you sent me at the time of the winter solstice 1 four pounds of silver.
Next year, when I hoped for a larger present (for presents ought either to stand at the same point or to grow larger), there came two pounds, more or less.
The third and fourth years brought still less.
The fifth year produced a pound, it is true, but only a Septician pound.
2
In the sixth year it fell off to a small cup of eight unciæ ;
* next year came half a pound of silver scrapings in a little cup.
The eighth year brought me a ladle of scarcely two ounces;
the ninth presented me a little spoon, weighing less than a needle.
The tenth year can have nothing less to send me;
return, therefore, Postu­ mianus, to the four pounds.
Four pounds of fine silver you sent, To heighten the solstician glee.
The boon ten years since gave content, And spoke you, Postumian, to me.
Next year I depended on more, As bounties should never grow less:
And what came to strengthen my store P Just half the four pounds, I profess.
The third and the fourth lessened still, The fifth brought a pitiful pound:
A dish of eight ounces to fill, The sixth generosity crown'd.
And now half a pound in a cup;
A ladle then, less than two ounces:
A spoonlet now gave me to sup, Though light as the feather that flounces.
Nought has the tenth twelvemonth to send:
To see her endeavour I burn.
Postumian, my counsel attend, To four honest pounders return.

My little book, though not yet adorned with the purple, or polished with the keen filing of pumice, you are in haste to follow Arcanus, whom beautiful Narbo, the native town of the learned Votienus, 1 recalls to uphold her laws and the annual magistracy;
and, what should equally be an object of your wishes, that delightful spot, and the friendship of Arcanus, will at once be yours.
How I could wish to be my book!
Nor yet empurpled, nor polite, From the dry pumice' grating bite, Thou hi'st Arcanus to attend;
For whom bright Narbo deigns to send, T' enforce the justice of the gods, And prop the laws with equal rods.
Hail, Narbo, hail!
supremely blest, Of such a progeny possess'd!
Arcanus, born to think and say, Learn'd Votienus, for the lay.
Go then, my child;
thy wishes crown, In such a friend, and such a town.
How just a joy would light my look, Could I but now become my book!

Instantius, than whom no one is reputed more sincere in heart, or more eminent for unsullied simplicity, if you wish to give strength and spirit to my muse, and desire of me verses which shall live, give me something to love.
Cynthia made sportive Propertius a poet;
the fair Lycoris was the genius of Gallus.
The beautiful Nemesis gave fame to the wit of Tibullus;
while Lesbia inspired the learned Catullus.
Neither the Pelignians, nor the Mantuans, will refuse me the name of a bard, if I meet with a Corinna or an Alexis.
Instantius, whose sincerer ne'er was known,
The snow unsoil'd of simpleness thine own!
Would'st my Thalia crown with pleasing pow'r,
And hope for lays that fear no final hour ?
Would'st place me ev'ry blame or praise above?
Give who shall light me with the torch of love.
Thee, gay Propertius, Cynthia earn'd a name;
The fair Lycoris prov'd a Gallus' flame;
'Twas Nemesis attun'd Tibullus' lyre;
And Lesbia set Catullus' soul on fire.

A Lingonian Gaul, fresh arrived, returning late at night to his lodging, through the Covered and Flaminian ways, struck his toe violently against some obstacle, dislocated his ankle, and fell at full length on the pavement.
What was the Gaul to do, how was he to get up ?
The huge fellow had with him but one little slave, so thin that he could scarcely carry a little lamp.
Accident came to the poor fellow's assistance.
Four branded slaves were carrying a common corpse, such as poor men's pyres receive by thousands.
To them the feeble attendant, in a humble tone, addressed his prayer, entreat­ ing that they would carry the dead body of his master whithersoever they pleased.
The load was changed, and the heavy burden crammed into the narrow shell, and raised on their shoulders.
This gentleman, Lucanus, seems to me one out of many of whom we may justly say, " Mortue Galle,” 1 Tom about one was from the tavern come, And with his load through Fleet-street reeling home |
Striking his toe against the Lord knows what, Into the kennel he directly shot.
What must Tom do ?
he could not stir or speak:
One only lad he had!
and he so weak,
He scarce could bear his cloak;
and wanted might To set the fallen monument upright.
But Tom's kind stars did present help supply:
By chance an empty hearse was passing by:
The lad screams out, " Good gentlemen, I pray One moment stop, and take a corpse away.
There's no great ceremony with the dead :
They squeeze him in, no matter, heels or head.
Thus Fortune, in gay humour, did contrive To make of Tom the best dead man alive.

“Tell me, Marcus, tell me the truth, I pray;
there is nothing to which I shall listen with greater pleasure."
Such if your constant prayer and request to me, Gallicus, both when you recite your compositions, and when you are plead­ ing the cause of a client.
It is hard for me to deny your re­ quest :
hear then what is as true as truth itself.
You do not hear truth with pleasure, Gallicus.
Tell me, say you, and tell me without fear
The truth, the thing I most desire to hear.
This is your language, when your works you quote:
And when you plead, this is your constant note.
'Tis most inhuman longer to deny
What you so often press so earnestly.
To the great truth of all then lend an ear— "
You are uneasy when the truth you hear."

Liber, dearest object of care to all tby friends;
Liber, worthy to live in ever-blooming roses;
if thou art wise, let thy hair ever glisten with Assyrian balsam, and let garlands of flowers surround thy head;
let thy pure crystal cups be darkened with old Falernian, and thy soft couch be warm with the caresses of love.
He who has so lived, even to a middle age, has made life longer than was bestowed on him.
Liber, of all thy friends thou sweetest care, Thou worthy in eternal flow'r to fare, If thou beest wise, with Tyrian oil let shine Thy locks, and rosy garlands crown thy head;
Dark ti.y clear glass with old Falernian wine, And heat with softest love thy softer bed.
He that but living half his days dies such, Makes his life longer than 't was given him, much.
Ben Jonson.
Liber, thou joy of all thy friends, Worthy to live in endless pleasure:
While knaves and fools pursue their ends, Let mirth and freedom be thy treasure.
Be still well dress'd, as now thou art, Gay, and on charming objects thinking;
Let easy beauty warm thy heart, And fill thy bed when thou leav'st drinking.
Delay no pressing appetite, And sometimes stir up lazy nature;
Of age the envious censure slight, What pleasure's made of, 'tis no matter.
He that lives so but to his prime, Wisely doubles his short time.

Games, such as the victory gained over the giants in the Phlegræan plains, such as thy Indian triumph, 0 Bacchus, would have deserved, Stella has exhibited in celebration of the triumph over the Sarmatians;
and such is his modesty, such his affection, he thinks these too insignificant.
Hermus,.
turbid with gold cast up from its depths, or Tagus which murmurs in the Hesperian regions, would not be sufficient for him.
Every day brings its own gifts;
there is no cessation to the rich series of largesses, and many a prize falls to the lot of the people.
Sometimes playful coins come down in sudden showers;
sometimes a liberal ticket bestows on them the animals which they have beheld in the arena.
Sometimes a bird delights to fill your bosom unexpectedly, or, without having been exhibited, obtains a master by lot, that it may not be torn to pieces.
Why should I enumerate the chariots, and the thirty prizes of victory, which are more than even both the Consuls generally give?
But all is surpassed, Cæ­ sar, by the great honour, that thy own triumph has thee for a spectator.
What games might make Phlegræan triumphs shine, What India's pomp might wish, Lyæus, thine;
The high enhancer of the northern day Does, and still thinks he nothing does, display.
In him how modesty and duty strove!
Twas all inferior to terrestrial Jove.
Him not suffices Hermus' sordid stream, Whose wave, disturb'd, yet gave the gold to gleam |
Him not ricn Tagus, flood no less sublime, Th' unrivall'd glory of the western clime.
Each day profuses boons;
nor fails the chain
Of wealth, or to the people rapine's rain.
Now wanton coin descends in copious show'r;
Now the large token bids the prey devour:
The bird into the breast secure is borne, And catches now her lord lest she be torn.
Why tell the cars, or palms unnumbered show, Which neither consul, or not both, bestow.
Yet, all outdone, ne'er thine outdoing cloys ;
Thy presence, Cæsar, since thy bay enjoys.

All your female friends are either old or ugly;
Day, more ugly than old women usually are.
These you lead about in your train, and drag with you to feasts, porticoes, and theatres.
Thus,
Fabulla, you seem handsome, thus you seem young.
All thy companions aged beldames are, Or more deform'd than age makes any, far:
These cattle at thy heels thou trail'st always To public walks, to suppers, and to plays.
'Cause when with such alone we thee compare, Thou canst be said, Fabulla, young or fair.

Thou revivest among us, Cæsar, the wonders of our vener­ able forefathers, and sufferest not ancient customs to expire, for the games of the Latian arena are renewed, and valour oontends with the natural weapon, the hand.
Thus, under thy rule, the respect for the ancient temples is preserved, and the fane where Jupiter was worshipped of old, is still honoured by thee.
Thus, while thou inventest new things, thou restorest the old:
and we owe to thee, Augustus, both the present and the past.
Our fathers' deeds, Cesar, thou dost revive, Preserve the grayest ages still alive;
The antiquated Latian games renew, The fight with simple fists, thy sands do show ;
Temples, though old, their honour thou maintain'st, The mean, for th' sake of richer, not disdain'st.
Thus while thou new dost build, the old restore, We owe thee for thy own, and all before.

Gellia swears, not by the mystic rites of Cybele, nor by the bull that loved the heifer of Egypt, nor indeed by any of our gods and goddesses, but by her pearls.
These she em­ braces;
these she covers with kisses;
these she calls her brothers and sisters;
these sibe loves more ardently than her two children.
If she should chance to lose these, she declares she could not live even an hour.
Ah !
how excellently, Papirianus, might the hand of Annæus Serenus 1 be turned to account!
What do you think is Lady Betty's oath ?
Tis neither split me, dem me, faith, nor troth:
Not by heaven's powers, or those of her own face:
But her dear drop, and dearer Brussels lace.
She calls them her dear creatures, hugs, and kisses, And loves them better than both little misses.
Protests, if they were ravished from her power, She could not possibly survive that hour.
Then grant, kind heaven, when next she sees the play, Some hand, like Peny's, snatch them both away.

While the crowd presents to thee, Augustus, its humble supplications, we too, in offering to our ruler our poor verses, know that the divinity can find time equally for public af­ fairs and the Muses, and that our garlands also please thee.
Uphold thy poets, Augustus;
we are thy pleasing glory, thy chief care and delight.
It is not the oaKs alone that be­ comes thee, nor the laurel a of Phcebus;
we will wreathe for thee a civic crown of ivy.
While plaintive mobs, Augustus, ask redress We to our bounteous lord our bliss confess.
We know that, from intending human-kind, He with the muses can his refuge find.
Accept thy various bards, their various lay;
Thy grace, thy glory, thy delight are they.
Nor oak, nor laurel, proves thy sole renown:
Be thine, of ivy, too, a civic crown.

—"
I am he, second to none in reputation for composing trifles, whom, reader, you do not admire, but rather, I suspect, love.
Let greater men devote their powers to higher subjects:
I am content to talk of small topics, and to come frequently into your hands."
Though thy leam'd breast, great poet, is to me known,
And that thy verse will raise me 'bove mine own;
Yet this short title on my statue place, Which 'mong no common authors thou dost grace.

In vaster works vast uncouth things are said, My glory is, that I am often read.

Hail, my beloved Toranius, dear to me as a brother.
The preceding epigram, which is not included in the pages of my book, I addressed to the illustrious Stertinius, who has re­ solved to place my bust in his library.
I thought it well to write to you on the subject, that you might not be ignor­ ant who Avitus really is.
Farewell, and prepare to re­ ceive me.
As long as Janus shall give the years their winters, Domi­ tian1 their autumns, and Augustus their summers;
as long as the glorious day of the Germanic kalends 2 shall recall the mighty name of the subdued Rhine;
as long as the Tarpeian temple of the chief of the gods shall stand;
as long as the Roman matron, with suppliant voice and incense, shall propiti­ ate the sweet divinity of Julia;
3 so long shall the lofty glory of the Flavian family remain, enduring like the sun, and the stars, and the splendour of Rome.
Whatever Domitian's un­ conquered hand has erected, is imperishable as heaven.
While summers, autumns, winters shall abide, Imperial names shall o'er the months preside;
While great December's bright and glorious day Shall boast Domitian made the Rhine obey;
While the Tarpeian rock shall fix'd remain, And Jove within the Capitol shall reign;
While Roman matrons Julia shall adore, With frankincense the goddess mild implore;
The lofty temple of the Flavian race Shall flourish with divine immortal grace;
Like sun and moon, e'en like Rome's empire, stand, A heaven is built by a victorious hand.

Although you are poor to your friends, Lupus, you are not so to your mistress, and your libidinous desires cannot complain of want of indulgence.

Setine wine, cooled in snow, is placed before your mistress;
we drink the black poison of Corsica out of the cask.
A small portion of her favours you purchase with your hereditary estates:
while your neglected friend is left to plough lands not his own.
Your mistress shines resplendent with Erythræan pearls;
your client, whilst you are immersed in pleasure, is abandoned to his creditor and dragged to prison.
A litter, supported by eight Syrian slaves, is provided for your mistress;

If you, 0 Cæsar, were to assume the rights of a creditor, and to demand payment for all that you have given to the gods and to heaven, Atlas, even though a great auction were to take place in Olympus, and the deities were compelled to sell all they have, would be bankrupt, and the father of the gods would be obliged to compound with you in a very small dividend.
For what could he pay you for the temple on the Capitol ?
What for the honour of the glorious Capitoline games ?
What could the spouse of the Thunderer pay for her two temples ?
Of Minerva I say nothing;
your interests are hers.
But what shall I say of the temples to Hercules and Apollo, and the affectionate Lacedæmonian twins ?
1
What of the Flavian temple which towers to the Roman sky P You must needs be patient and suspend your claims, for Jove'a treasury does not contain sufficient to pay you.
If thou shouldst challenge what is due to thee From heaven, and its creditor wouldst be;
If public sale should be cried through the spheres, And th' gods sell all to satisfy arrears, Atlas will bankrupt prove, nor one ounce be Reserved for Jupiter to treat with thee.
What canst thou for the Capitol receive P Or for the honour of the laurel-wreath ?
Or what will Juno give thee for her shrine?
Pallas I pass, she waits on thee and thine.
Alcides, Phoebus, Pollux
I slip by, And Flavia's temple neighboring on the sky.
Cæsar, thou must forbear, and trust the heaven:
Jove's chest has not enough to make all even.
Fletcher If, Cæsar, thou shouldst from great love reclaim
All thou hast lent to dignify his name;
Should a fair auction rend Olympus' hall, And the just gods be forced to sell their all, The bankrupt Atlas not a twelfth could pay To meet thy claims upon the reckoning day;

Do not oblige great Jove, then, to compound, Who could not pay thee sixpence in the pound.

When Galla will grant you her favours for two gold pieces, and what you please for as many more, why is she presented with ten gold pieces on each of your visits, Æschylus ?
She does not estimate her utmost favours at so high a price:
why then do you give her so much ?
To stop her mouth P
When for two guilders Galla thou might'st have, And bring her to do aught, if four thou gave, Why, Æschylus, gav'st thou ten ?
Was it, in sooth, To tie her tongue ?
Or, rather, gain her mouth ?

To thee, chaste prince, mighty conqueror of the Rhine, and father of the world, cities present their thanks:
they will henceforth have population;
it is now no longer a crime to bring infants into the world.
The boy is no longer muti­ lated by the art of the greedy dealer, to mourn the loss of his manly rights;
nor does the wretched mother give to her prostituted child the price paid by a contemptuous pander.
That modesty, which, before your reign, did not prevail even on the marriage couch, begins, by your influence, to be felt even in the haunts of licentiousness.
1
O thou, who couldst the Rhine restore, Dread guardian of mankind ;
Meek modesty, with blushing lore, Was to thy care consigned.
To thee their everlasting praise Let town and country pay ;
Who fairly may their offspring raise, To people and obey.
By avarice no more beguil'd, Virility shall mourn:
Nor shall the prostituted child Be from the mother torn.
Shame, though, before thy blest decree, The bridal bed's disdain;
Now, sanctified again by thee, Ubiquitous must reign.

As if it were but a trifling crime for our sex to bargain away our male children to public lust, the very cradle had become the prey of the pander, so that the child, snatched from its mother's bosom, seemed to demand, by its wailing, the disgraceful pay.
Infants born but yesterday suffered scandalous outrage.
The father of Italy, who but recently brought help to tender adolescence, to prevent savage lust from condemning it to a manhood of sterility, could not endure such horrors.
Before this, Cæsar, you were loved by boys, anc. youths, and old men;
now Infants also love you.
As tho' the vilest wrong were right refin'd, To traffic it with prostitute mankind;
The cradle proved the pander's who could buy The finest victim, from the feeblest cry.
Against poor innocents such arts conspire
As shock sweet nature, and th' Ausonian sire:
That sire, who to the aid of youth had flown, Lest savage lust should blight the hero grown.
The boy, the youth, the sage did love, applaud:
Now smiling infants lisp their Cæsar's laud.

A name born among violets and the roses, a name which is that of the most pleasant part of the year;
1 a name which savors of Hybla and Attic flowers, and which exhales a per­ fume like that of the nest of the superb phoenix;
a name sweeter than the nectar of the gods, and which the boy, be­ loved of Cybele, as well as he who mixes the cups for the Thunderer, would have preferred to his own;
a name which, if even breathed in the Imperial palace, would be responded to by every Venus and Cupid;
a name so noble, soft, and deli­ cate, I wished to utter in not inelegant verse.
But you, ob­ stinate syllable, 1 rebel!
Yet some poets say Eiarinos;
but then they are Greek poets, to whom every license is permit­ ted, and with whom it is lawful to pronounce the word Ares2 long or short just as they please.
We Romans, who court severer muses, dare not take such liberties.
With the roses and violets sprung, In the season most joyously sung;
That sips Hybla and Attical flowers, To the Phoenix fum'd eyry that towers;
Oh the name than the nectar more sweet!
That to music's own ear were a treat;
That, whom Cybele lov'd, would cajole;
Or, who tempers the Thunderer'a bowl.
In the Palatine-hall if it sigh, All the Loves and the Graces reply.
Little name noble, delicate, soft!
Thee in smoothest of lays wish I oft, But the train of short vowels proves cross:
Yet the bards can tune Eiarinos:
The bold Greeks, whom can nothing confound, And who ' Αρες ' Αρες can resound.
Such fair freedoms our language refuses, Which obeys more despotical muses.
Other tongues, wisely free as the Greek, Can with equal variety speak:
Nor the privilege need they decline, Of Earinus, or Earine.

You have a name, which designates the season of the new- born year, when the Cecropian bees plunder the short-lived vernal flowers;
a name, which deserves to be written with Cupid's arrow, and which Cytherea would delight in tracing with her needle:
a name, worthy of being traced in letters of Erythræan pearls, or gems polished by the fingers of the He­ liades, I a name which the cranes flying to the skies might de­ scribe with their wings,2 and which is fit only for Cæsar's palace.
Thy name the sweetest season in does bring, (Joy of the plundering bees) the flow'ry spring;
Which to decypher Venus may delight, Or Cupid, with a plume from 's own wing, write;
Which those, that amber chafe, should only note, Or be upon, or with a jewel wrote;
A name the cranes do figure as they fly, And boast to Jove, as they approach the sky:
A name that does with no place else comport, But where 'tis fix'd, only in Cæsar's court.

I possess, and pray that I may long continue to possess, under thy guardianship, Cæsar, a small country seat;
I have also a modest dwelling in the city.
But a winding machine has to draw, with laborious effort, water for my thirsting garden from a small valley;
while my dry house complains that it is not refreshed even by the slightest shower, although the Marcian fount 1 babbles close by.
The water, which thou wilt grant, Augustus, to my premises, will be for me as the water of Castalia or as showers from Jupiter.
A petty farm, and humble gods in town, By thee, and may they long, my wishes crown.
But, Cæsar, from the vale, to slake the grass, A painful pump must win the wave to pass:
And then the house complains no fountain cheers;
When, babbling by, the Marcian rill she hears.
The stream Augustus on our gods shall pour, Will prove Castalian, or the Thund'rer's show'r.

This piece of land, which lies so open to all, and is covered with marble and gold, witnessed the birth of the infant lord of the world.
Happy land, that resounded with the cries of so illustrious an infant, and saw and felt his little hands spreading over it!
Here stood the venerable mansion, which gave to the earth that which Rhodes, 1 and pious Crete, gave to the starry heaven.
The Curetes protected Jupiter by the rattling of their arms, such as Phrygian eunuchs were able to bear.
But thee, Cæsar, the sire of the Immortals protected, and the thunderbolt and ægis were thy spear and buckler.
On this grand spot, which gold and marble crown, Smil'd first the infant-lord of her renown.
What joy was hers, to hear th' auspicious cry, And teach the sprawling hands to hail the sky.
Here stood the awful dome, that brought mankind What Rhodes, what pious Crete, to heav'n assign'd.
The fam'd Curetes well might clang their arms:
Half-men could guard a little god from harms.
But, Cæsar, thee the sire of gods conceal'd:
The bolt and Ægis proved thy spear and shield.

ElphinstonYou think, perhaps, Pastor, that I ask riches with the same motive with which the vulgar and ignorant herd ask them;
that the soil of Setia may be tilled with my ploughshares, and our Tuscan land resound with the innumerable fetters of my slaves;
that I may own a hundred tables of Maureta­ nian marble supported on pedestals of Libyan ivory, and that ornaments of gold may jingle on my couches ;
that my lips may press only large cups of crystal, and that my Falernian wine may darken the snow in which it is cooled;
that Syrian slaves, clad in Canusian wool, may perspire under the weight of my litter, while it is surrounded by a crowd of fashionable clients;
that my guests, full of wine, may envy me the posses­ sion of a cupbearer, whom I would not change even for Gany­ mede;
that I may ride a prancing mule to bespatter my Tyrian cloak;
or goad with the whip a steed from Marseilles.
It is not, I call the gods and the heavens to witness, for any such objects.
For what, then ?
That I may bestow gifts, Pastor and build houses.
Perhaps you think more riches I desire, From motives which the vulgar herd inspire.
That the bright plough share shine upon my lands
And that my farm employ a hundred hands.
My tables from carv'd frames derive an air;
From gilt ones my settee or elbow-chair.
That the huge massy golden cup be mine;
Or ice look crimson d by my cooling wine.
That two tall Irishmen my chair support;
Or at my levee beaux may pay their court.
Or when my mellow guest is put to bed, He may admire the beauty of my maid.
In harness gay my set of greys advance;
Or that my pad at Foubert's learn to dance.

Not one of all those things have I in view.
Building my passion is, and to extend Alms to the poor, and presents to a friend.

O thou, whose head with golden glory glow*d, Say, where my friend the virgin-boon bestow'd?
In marble fix'd th' imperial features view:
The crown, spontaneous, round the honours flew.
With envy may the oak the olive eye, That this should now th' unvanquish'd wreath supply.
Elphinston.
What sculptor, imitating the lineaments of the imperial bust, has surpassed in Roman marble the ivory of Phidias ?
This is the face that rules the world;
these are the features of Jove in his calm majesty;
such is the god when be hurls his thunder in a cloudless sky.
Pallas has given thee, Carus, not only her crown, but the image of thy lord, which thou hast thus honoured.
What noble artist has such glory won ?
In taking Cæsar's face, Phidias out-done P Whose polish'd iv'ry is no way so fair, As with the Latian marble to compare.
Such, with delight, we see heav'n's face, and wonder '
When, without clouds, serene, we hear it thunder.
Pallas not only gave thee th' olive wreath, But her own work, this statue, did bequeath.
Anon. 1695.
Whenever
I glance at your Hyllus as he pours out my wine, Afer, you fix upon me an eye full of mistrust.
What harm is there, I ask, in admiring a pretty attendant?
We gaze at the sun, the stars, the temples, the gods.
Am I to turn away my head and hide my eyes and countenance, as though a Gorgon were handing me the cups?
Alcides was severe;
yet he permitted Hylas to be looked at;
and Mercury is allowed to play with Ganymede.
If you do not wish your guests, Afer, to look at your youthful attendants, you should invite only such as Phineus and Œdipus.
1
As oft as we thy Hyllus do behold Filling thy wine, thy brows do seem to scold;
What crime is 't, I would know, to view thy boy P We look upon the gods, the stars, the day.
Shall I fling back as when a Gorgon lies Steep'd in the cup ?
and hide my face and eyes ?
Great Hercules was fierce in cruelty, Yet we might see his pretty Hylas free:
Nor would great Jove have aught in wrath to say If Mercury with Ganymede did play.
(Afer) if then we must not view thy loose Soft ministers that serve thee in thy house, Invite such men as Phineus to be Thy guests, or CEdipus, that ne'er could see.

He who ventures to send verses to the eloquent Nerva, will present common perfumes to Cosmus,3 violets and privet to the inhabitant of Pæstum, and Corsican honey to the bees of Hybla.
Yet there is some attraction in even a humble muse;
the cheap olive is relished even when costly dainties are on the table.
Be not surprised, however, that, conscious of the mediocrity of her poet, my Muse fears your judgment.
Nero himself is said to have dreaded your criticism, when, in his youth, he read to you his sportive effusions.
Who lines to witty Nerva dares present, As well might perfumes to th' Exchange have sent;
To Pæstum flow'rs, to th' country privet send, Or Hybla's hives with Corsick honey mend:
Yet may a slender muse some gust afford;
'Mong choycest fare sowre olives come to th' board.
Nor wonder that our Muse, being conscious
Of her meane worth, should dread thy judgment thus:
Nero himself, with's wanton straines, did feare
In youth, 't is sayd, t' approach thy critick care.
Old MS. 16th Cent.I, that lie here, am Latinus, the pleasing ornament of the stage, the honour of the games, the object of your ap­ plause, and your delight;
who could have fixed even Cato himself as a spectator, and have relaxed the gravity of the Curii and Fabricii.
But my life took no colour from the stage, and I was known as an actor only in my profession.
Nor could I have been acceptable to the emperor without strict morality.
He, like a god, looks into the inmost re­ cesses of the mind.
Call me, if you please, the slave of laurel-crowned Phœbus, provided Rome knows that I was the servant of her Jupiter.
The charming grace, the glory of the stage.
Th' applause, the darling pastime of the age;
Latin lies here, whom Cato would have made His fix'd spectator, sourness have allay'd In rough Fabricius.
His strict life ne'er drew
The stage's vice, its arts he only knew.
Dear to his lord, he must, by virtue, be, His lord, whose eyes the inward mind do see.
Him, Phœbus' parasite, cease, Rome, to name, To be thy Joves domestic, he did claim.
Anon. 1695.
I'm that arch fellow Foote, the delight of his age, The fame and applause of the droll mimic stage;
'T is I who, by muscles quite chang'd and grimace, Could the deep lurking laugh of great senators trace, And quite shorten the length of Sir Thomas's face.
'T is I who the various powers have shown
Of changing the face by a secret unknown :
The feign'd laugh, ogling smile, and the wide vacant stare, That has made the spectators all loudly declare
They never saw anything like it, they swear.
Thus, during my life-time, my house was still showing
That by my sole art I could keep the scenes going.
But what will become of it after I'm dead The Lord knows, but fear 't will lie low as my head!
I've taken off others till quite out of breath, And now I m taken off by that fell serjeant, Death.

After having lived through a period as long as the age of Nestor, are you then so suddenly carried off, Philænis, to Pluto's streams below P You had not yet counted the long years of the Cumæan Sibyl;
she was older by three months.
Alas!
what a tongue is silent!
a tongue that not a thousand cages full of slaves, nor the crowd of the votaries of Serapia, nor the schoolmaster's curly-headed troop hurrying to their lessons in the morning, nor the bank resounding with flocks of Strymonian cranes, could overpower.
Who will hence­ forth know how to draw down the moon with Thessalian circle ? 1
Who will display such skill in managing an amorous intrigue for money ?
May the earth lie lightly on you, and may you be pressed with a thin covering of sand, that the dogs may not be prevented from rooting up your bones!
Philænis, old as Nestor, must thou take So soone thy passage to th' infernal!
lake P
Thou hadst not reached the Sibyll's age;
her count, Alas!
does thine yet full three months surmount.
Ah!
what a tongue 's now silenced, which no cry Of Isis' priests, or gaole-birds, could outvie;
Or in a morning a full schoole of boyes, Or flock of screaming wylde-geese, e'er outnoyse.
Who now shall char me the moone with magic whirle P
What bawd know how to sell this or that girle P May gentle earth, and light dust, cover thee, Lest thy bones unscratch'd up by dogs should bee!

16th CentAntistius Rusticus has perished on the barbarian frontiers of the Cappadocians, land guilty of a lamentable crime!
Ni­ grina brought back in her bosom the bones of her dear hus­ band, and complained that the way was not sufficiently long;
1 and, when she was confiding the sacred urn to the tomb, which she envied, she seemed to herself to lose her husband a second time.
When late his Grace at Naples did expire (A place we now may curse, and not admire),
The pious wife brought home the dear remains;
And of the journey short, too short, complains.
Envies the tomb that robs her of his urn;
A loss which she, as widow'd twice, doth mourn.

Velim, while accompanying Cæsar on his northern expe­ dition, vowed, for the safety of his leader, to immolate a goose2 to Mars.
The moon had not fully completed eight revolu­ tions,3 when the god demanded fulfilment of his vow.
The goose itself hastened willingly to the altar, and fell a humble victim on the sacred hearth.
Do you see those eight me­ dals hanging from the broad beak of the bird ?
4
They were recently hidden in its entrails.
6
The victim which offers pro- pitious sacrifices for thee, Cæsar, with silver instead of blood, teaches us that we have no longer need of steel (the sword).
In northern climes, amid sublime alarms, This bird a Velius vow'd for Cæsar's arms.
Not twice four times her course did Luna stray, When Mars his vot'ry call'd his vow to pay.
The gander joyous peal'd his fun'ral knell, And on the sacred fire spontaneous fell.
Eight wondrous coins he dropt from out his bill:
These from his bowels be did late distil.
Who now with silver, not with blood, atones;
The happy unavail of iron owns.

I prefer one who is free and easy, and who goes about clad in a loose robe;

Jupiter, when he saw the Flavian temple rising under the sky of Rome, laughed at the fabulous tomb erected to himself on Mount Ida, and, having drunk abundantly of nectar at table, exclaimed, as he was handing the cup to his son Mars, and addressing himself at the same time to Apollo and Diana, with whom were seated Hercules and the pious Arcos, “ You gave me a monument in Crete;
see how much better a thing it is to be the father of Cæsar!”
When Jove great Cæsar's Flavian temple ey'd, His fabulous Cretan tombe be did deride.
And when at table he did freely supp Nectar, and gave to Mars, his sonne, the cupp, Looking on Phœbus, and bright Phœbe, where Faire Maia's sonne and great Alcides were, “ You rais'd me Cretan monuments," quoth he, How much more Cæsar's father 'tis to be!"

These are the contrivances, Philomusus, by which you are constantly trying to secure a dinner;
inventing numbers of fictions, and retailing them as true.
You are informed of the counsels of Pacorus at the court of Parthia;
you can tell the exact numbers of the German and Sarmatian armies.
You reveal the unopened despatches of the Dacian general;
you see a laurelled letter, announcing a victory, before its arrival.
You know how often dusky Syene has been watered by Egyp­ tian floods;
you know how many ships have sailed from the shores of Africa;
you know for whose head the Julian olives grow, and for whom the Father of Heaven1 destines his triumphal crowns.
A truce to your arts;
you shall dine with me to-day, but only on this condition, Philomusus, that you tell me no news.
By these stale arts a dinner you pursue;
You trump up any tale and tell as true.
Know how the councils at the Hague incline ;
What troops in Italy and on the Rhine.
A letter from the general produce, Before the officers could have the news.
Know to an inch the rising of the Nile :
What ships are coming from each sugar isle:
What we expect from this year's preparation:
Who shall command the forces of the nation.
Leave off these tricks;
and with me if you choose
To dine to-day, do so;
but then, no news.

When the Phrygian youth, the well-known favourite of the other Jupiter, had seen the Ausonian attendant2 with his hair just shaved off, " 0 sovereign ruler," said he, " concede to thy youth what thy Cæsar has granted to his.
The first dowo upon my chin is now succeeded by longer hairs;
thy Juno now laughs at me and calls me a man."
To whom the Fa­ ther of Heaven answered, " Oh, sweetest boy, not I, but ne­ cessity, denies your request.
Our Cæsar has a thousand cup­ bearers like you ;
and his palace, large as it is, scarcely holds the brilliant troop.
But if your hair be shaved, and give you a man's visage, what other youth will be found to mix my nectar for me?”
When late the Phrygian youth espied Th' Ausonian, with his locks laid down;
To Jupiter he humbly cried, On my desire, oh!
do not frown.
What privilege thy Cæsar deign'd, To bid his stripling fond enjoy, Of thee, great ruler, be obtained, To bless thine ever grateful boy.
The down, with which my cheek is clad, Beneath my waving honours plays. "
Thou now art quite a man, my lad," To me thy smiling consort says.
To whom the sire:
“ My sweetest boy, Thou seem'st not yet maturely wise.
Thou know'st I would indulge thy joy:
But thee the thing itself denies.
A thousand ministers, like thee, Adorn my dear Augustus' hall:
Her vast expanse, whatever it be, Can hardly hope to hold them all.
Should the rich harvest of thy hair Upon thy looks implant the man;
To mix my nectar, tell me where I could supply another Gan ? " Elphinston.
Though, while you yourself, Galla, are at home, you are being dressed out in the middle of the Suburra, and your locks are prepared for you at a distance;
though you lay aside your teeth at night with your silk garments, and lie stowed away in a hundred boxes;
though even your face does not sleep with you, and you ogle me from under eyebrows which are brought to you in the morning;
though no consi­ deration of your faded charms, which belong to a past gener­ ation, moves you;
though all this is the case, you offer me six hundred sesterces.
But nature revolts, and, blind though she be,1 she sees very well what you are.
When, thou at home and absent, borrowed hayre
And tyres for thee the shops doe still prepare;
When teeth, an cloaths, at sleeping times ayd by, Thy face at night doth never with thee lye;
Lock'd up in hundred boxes;
whence i' th' morne, That looke they bring thee out is next day worne ;
Yet, without rev'rence to thy locks (as old As grand-dame's), thou to Cupide offer'st gold;
But Cupid's deafe;

Old MS. 16th CentThough, Agathinus, you play dangerous tricks with the utmost nimbleness, you still cannot contrive to let your shield fall.
It seems to follow you, even against your will, and, returning through the thin air, seats itself either on your foot, or your back, or your hair, or your finger.
However slippery the stage may be with showers of saf­ fron, and however the violent south winds may tear the canvass opposed to its fury, the shield, without apparent guidance, freely traverses your limbs, unimpeded by either wind or water.
Even though you wished to fail, whatever your endeavours, you could not;
and the fall of your shield would be the greatest proof of your art.
Little nimble Agathine, What consummate art is thine!
Play thy postures, one and all;
Never will the target fall.
Thee she follows everywhere:
Stooping through the easy air, To thy hand or foot she flies, On thy back or buttock lies.
Slipp'ry footing proves no dread, Though the show'r Corycian shed ;
Though the rapid southern gales Strive to rend theatric vails.
Still secure, the careless bov Flings from limb to limb the toy;
And the artist well may bravo
All the force of wind and wave.
Little dextrous Agathine, To eschew should'st thou incline, Poor thy chance, alone of this:
Who still hits, can never miss.
Thou must change thy postures all$
Else the target ne'er will fall.

This is the anniversary of the first day on which the Pala­ tine Thunderer1 saw light, a day on which Cybele might have desired to give birth to Jove.
On this day, too, the chaste Cæsonia was born, the daughter of my friend Rufus;
no maiden owes more than she to her mother.
The husband re­ joices in the double good fortune which awaits his prayers, and that it has fallen to his lot to have two reasons for lov­ ing this day.
This was our earthly Jove's first happy morn, Rhea oft wished her Jove upon it born, Which day first light did to Cæsonia show, No daughter e'er t' a mother more did owe;
Two mighty joys the day in Rufus moves, Which for his prince, and for his wife, he loves.
Anon. 1695.
When Diodorus left Pharos for Rome, to win the Tar­ peian crowns,2 his Philænis made a vow for his safe return, that a young girl, such as even the chastest woman might love, should prepare her for his embraces.
The ship being destroyed by a terrible storm, Diodorus, submerged and overwhelmed in the deep, escaped by swimming, through the influence of the vow.
Oh husband too tardy and too sluggish!
If my mistress had made such a vow for me upon the shore, I should have returned at once.
Against the high Tarpeian time, When garlands render heads sublime ;
To Rome returning, Diodore The canvass spread from Pharos' shore.
Philænis for her lord's return, Fanning the flame that bid her burn, Vow'd that the purest maid should meet What Sabine dames not blush to greet.
The vessel wreck'd in the profound, Poor Diodore was just not drown'd.
He swims through each opposing storm, The vow all pious to perform.
Yet kinder than deserv'd his fate 'T was well he came, nor came too late.
I, so devoted by my dove, Would By upon the wings of love.

So mayst thou ever be rich, Apollo, in thy sea-girt plains;
so mayst thou ever have delight in thy ancient swans;
so may the learned sisters ever serve thee, and thy Delphic oracles never speak falsely;
so may the palace of Cæsar wor­ ship and love thee;
as the kind Domitian shall speedily grant and accord to Stella, at my request, the twelve fasces.
Happy then shall I be, and, as thy debtor for the fulfilment of my prayer, will lead to the rustic altar a young steer with golden horns, as a sacrifice to thee.
The victim is already born, Phœbus;
why dost thou delay ?
So may thy temples, Phoebus, honoured be;
Prophetic swans held sacred unto thee;
The muses glory to make up thy train, The Delphic oracles prove never vain;
The palace divine worship to thee pay, As Cæsar (thou inspiring him) shall say, The grace thou ask'st, to Stella I will show, Consular ensigns upon him bestow.
Thy happy debtor then, a steer I '11 bring, With gilded horns, for my glad offering;
This vow upon my rural altar pay ;
The victim's ready, Phœbus, why dost stay ?

This great deity, represented by a small bronze image, who mitigates the hardness of the rocks on which he sits by spreading over them his lion's skin;
who, with upraised countenance, gazes on the heaven which he once supported:
whose left band is engaged with his club, and his right with a cup of wine, is not a new-born celebrity, or a glory of our own sculptor's art.
You behold the noble work of Lysippus, which he presented to Alexander the Great.
This divinity adorned the table of the monarch of Pella, so soon laid in the earth which he had subdued.
By this god, Hannibal, when a child, took his oath at the Libyan altar;
this god bade the cruel Sulla lay down his kingly power.
Offended by the proud despotism of various courts, he now delights to inhabit a private house;
and, as he was formerly the guest of the benevolent Molorchus, so he desires now to be the god of the learned Vindex.
On stone, with softer lyon's skinn o'erlayd, This mighty god, that sits in brass pourtray'd, Looking to th' starrs, sustayn'd once by his might, Whose left hand his clubb warmes, and wine his right, Is no new piece of which our gravers boast;
Wee to Lysippus owe this paynes and cost.
This once the Macedonian youth possess'd, Who soone the whole world conquer'd, soone deceas'd ;
Then Hannibal to Libyan coasts translated;
Who Sylla's sterne commanding power abated.
Brooking no longer swelling tyrants' courts, T a private dwelling hee at length resorts;
And, as he once was kind Molorchus' guest, So with learn'd Vindex now this god will rest.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
I lately asked Vindex to whose happy toil and workman­ ship his Hercules owed his existence.
He smiled, as is his wont, and, with a slight inclination of bead, " Pray," said be, " my dear poet, can you not read Greek ?
The pedestal bears an inscription which tells you the name."
I read the word Lysippus, I thought it bad been the work of Phidias.
When late Alcides' self I saw A Vindex' guest, I gaz'd with awe;
Yet humbly of the god inquired, What human art he had inspired, To bid his image stand confessed.
His godship scarce his smile suppress'd;
And, nodding bland, thus deign'd to speak:
Poor bardling, dost thou know no Greek ?
Behold the base, and learn to spell:
Thence wonder and inquiry quell.
I, blushing, there ΛΥΣΙΠΠΟΥ scann'd ;
But thought it had been Phidias' hand.

You are now about to set out, Marcellinus, as a soldier to the northern climes, to brave the sluggish constellations ot the Getic sky:
there the Promethean rocks and the fabled mountains, to which you must now go, will be close to your eyes!
When you have beheld the rocks, the confidants of the mighty plaints of old Prometheus, you will say, " He was more enduring than they."
And you may add, “ He who was able to bear such sufferings, was well qualified to fashion the race of mortals."
Now thou bear'st arms under the northern pole, Near which the constellations slowly roll;
With thy approaching eyes thou may'st behold Prometheus' rock, the fabulous scene of old, Where th' aged hero fill'd both earth and skies
With hideous exclamations and loud cries, The tortures proving, which he there sustain'd, The rock less hard to which his limbs were chain'd.
Who can men's hardships or hard hearts admire, When they, the offspring, are of such a sire ?

Genius is always building;
sometimes he is laying down thresholds, sometimes fitting keys to doors, and buying locks;
sometimes he is changing or replacing windows.
He does anything to be engaged in building, and all this that he may be able to say to any friend who asks him for a loan, 1 building."
He still is building:
patches up a door, Alters a lock, or key;
and nothing more:
Removes a window ;
puts it in repair :
So he but build, no matter what th' affair;

HoAs you swore to me, Garricus, by your gods and by your head, that I was to inherit the fourth of your estate, I be­ lieved you, (for who would willingly disbelieve what he de­ sires ?) and nursed my hopes by continually giving you ore­ A sents;
among which I sent you a Laurentian boar of extra­ ordinary weight;
one that you might have supposed to be from Ætolian Calydon.
But you forthwith invited the people and the senators;
and glutted Rome is not yet free from the taste of my boar.
I myself (who would believe it ?) was not present even as the humblest of your guests;
not a rib, not even the tail, was sent me.
How am I to expect from you a fourth part of your estate, Garricus, when not even a welfth part of my own boar came to me ?
By all that's good and sacred you do swear, To make me of a quarter part your heir.
I think, you would not gratis go to hell;
Nor would I starve a humour I like well.

Though founder I, and not the meanest guest, You gave me not one morsel with the rest.

This is that toga much celebrated in my little books, that toga so well known and loved by my readers.
It was a present from Parthenius;
a memorable present to his poet long ago;
in it, while it was new, while it shone brilliantly with glistening wool, and while it was worthy the name of its giver, I walked proudly conspicuous as a Roman knight.
Now it is grown old, and is scarce worth the acceptance of shivering poverty;
and you may well call it snowy.
2
What does not time in the course of years destroy ?
This toga is no longer Parthenius's;
it is mine.
This is that coat, so often by me sung, Upon whose praise the raptur'd reader hung.
His lordship's once;
a gift for poet meet;
In which I walk'd respected in the street.
New, and with all its glossy honours on, Worthy its donor, it divinely shone.
Now old, a hangman scorns it for his fees:
And if it shines at all, it shines with grease.
All things by time, and length of years, dechne:
Is this his lordship's coat ?
for shame!
'tis mine.

You pretend to consider my talent as small, Gaurus, be­ cause I write poems which please by being brief.
I confess that it is so;
while you, who write the grand wars of Priam in twelve books, are doubtless a great man.
I paint the favourite of Brutus, and Langon,2 to the life.
You, great artist, fashion a giant in clay.
Gaurus approves my wit but slenderly, 'Cause I write verse that please for brevity:
But he in twenty volumes drives a trade Of Priam's wars.
Oh, he's a mighty blade!
We give an elegant young pigmy birth, He makes a dirty giant all of earth.
Fletcher.
I am no genius, you affirm:
and why ?
Because my verses please by brevity.

Of mighty battles, are a man of might.

Yours like the dirty giants in Guildhall.

That which you constantly asked of the gods, Lucanus, has, in spite of your brother's remonstrances, fallen to your lot;
it has been your fate to die before him.
Tullus envies you the privilege ;
for he desired, though the younger, to go first to the Stygian waters.
You are now an inhabitant of the Elysian fields, and, dwelling in the charming grove, are content, for the first time, to be separated from your brother;
and if Castor in his turn now comes from the brilliant stars, you, as another Pollux, exhort him not to return to them.
To weary heaven, while gen'rous brothers vie, Thou, Lucan, earlier hast obtained to die.
Nor seek'st unenvied thou the shades below:
Tullus, thy younger, glad would elder go.
Blest tenant of the bland Elysian grove, N ow first would'st thou without thy brother rove.
Would Castor leave the light, to pay thy love, A Pollux thou would'st bid him stay above.

If you but believe me, Quintus Ovidius, I love, as you de­ serve, the first of April, your natal day, as much as I love my own first of March.
Happy is either morn!
and may both days be marked by us with the whitest of stones!
The one gave me life, but the other a friend.
Yours, Quintus, gave me more than my own.
Believing hear, what you deserve to hear:
Your birth-day, as my own, to me is dear.
Blest and distinguished days!
which we should prize
The first, the kindest bounty of the skies.
But yours gives most;
for mine did only lend Me to the world;
yours gave to me a friend.
Hay.
On your birth-day, Quintus, I wished to make you a small present:
you forbade me;
you are imperious.
I must obey your injunction:
let that be done which we both desire, and which will please us both.
Do you, Quintus, make me a present.
When I would send such trifles as I can, You stop me short!
you arbitrary man !
But I submit.
Both may our orders give;
And do what both like best:
let me receive.

If I had thrushes fattened on Picenian olives, or if a Sa­ bine wood were covered with my nets;
or if the finny prey were dragged on shore by my extended rod, or my branches, thickly limed, held fast the fettered birds ;
I should offer you, Carus, as an esteemed relative, the usual presents, and neither a brother nor a grandfather would have the preference over you.
As it is, my fields resound only with paltry starlings and the plaints of linnets, and usher in the spring with the voice of the shrill sparrow.
On one side, the ploughman re­ turns the salutation of the magpie;
on the other, the rapaci­ ous kite soars towards the distant stars.
So I send you small presents from my hencoop;
and if you accept such, you will often be my relative.
If a mew'd quail by accident I had;
Or snipe or woodcock taken in my glade;
Could Ia trout now with my angle get;
Or cover a young partridge with my net;
You, cousin, should have it sooner than another, As soon as my own father, or my brother.
But now the fields with chattering magpies ring;
Sparrows and swallows now proclaim the spring:
Now to the cuckow shepherd boys reply:
The thieving kite now skims along the sky.
So that I nothing but a fowl could send;
Which, if you like, you're always welcome, friend.
Hay.
On the day sacred to relatives,1 on which many a fowl is sent as a present, there throngs around me, while I am pre­ paring some thrushes for Stella, and some for you, Flaccus, an immense and troublesome crowd, of which each individual thinks that he ought to be the first in my affections.
My desire was to show my regard for two;
to offend a number is scarcely safe;
while to send presents to all would be ex­ pensive.
I will secure their pardon in the only way that remains to me;
I will neither send thrushes to Stella nor to you, Flaccus.
When Christmas turkeys round in presents flew, One I design'd for Ned, and one for you.
But most unluckily on this occasion, Fat turkeys make me friend to half the nation.
Two I would fain oblige;
and none offend:
But to give every one there is no end.
I then determine, after counsel heard, That Ned and you must go without your bird.

Spendophorus, the armour-bearer of our sovereign lord, is setting out for the cities of Libya.
Prepare weapons, Cupid, to bestow on the boy;
the arrows with which you strike youths and tender maids.
Let there be also, however, a smooth spear in his delicate hand.
Omit the coat of mail, the shield, and the helmet;
and that he may enter the battle in safety, let him go uncovered;
Parthenopæus2 was hurt by no dart, no sword, no arrow, whilst he was unencumbered with a head-piece.
Whoever shall be wounded by Spendo­ phorus, will die of love.
Happy is he whom a death so for­ tunate awaits!
But return while thou art still a boy, and while thy face retains its youthful bloom, and let thy Rome, and not Libya, make a man of thee.
To Libya goes Spendophorus to warre.
Cupid, thy shafts for this faire
Boy prepare,
Those shafts, which youths and tender virgins wound;
Light let thy speare in his soft hand be found.
The breast-plate, helme, and shield I leave to thee;
To fight in safety, naked led him bee.
No arrow, sword, nor dart could hurt in warre Parthenopæus, whilst his face was bare.
He whom this youth shall wound, will dye of love, And happy too so sweet a fate to prove.
Whilst yet thy chin is smooth, fair boy, come home;
Grow not a man in Affricke, but at home.

Nymph, queen of the Sacred Lake, to whom Sabinus, with pious munificence, dedicates an enduring temple;
receive with kindness, I pray thee, (so may mountainous Umbria ever worship thy source, and thy town of Sassina never prefer the waters of Baiæ !) my anxious compositions which I offer thee.
Thou wilt be to my muse the fountain of Pegasus.
Whoever presents his poems to the temple of the Nymphs, indicates of himself what should be done with them.
Queen of the lake, whose temples soar the skies, That my Sabinus' bounty gave to rise!
So may high Umbria in thy fountain lave, Nor Sassina prefer the Baian wave:
Receive the anxious boon my muses bring, And duly prove their Pegasean spring.
Who lays, ye nymphs, his labours in your fanes, Just intimates the merit of his strains.

Mamurra, after having walked long and anxiously in the squares, where golden Rome ostentatiously displays her richeR, viewed the tender young slaves, and devoured them with his eves;
not those exposed in the open shops, but those which are kept for the select in private apartments, and are not seen by the people, or such as I am.
Satiated with this inspection, he uncovers the tables square and round;
and asks to see some rich ivory ornaments which were displayed on the upper shelves.
Then, having four times measured a dinner-couch for six, wrought with tortoise-shell, he sorrowfully regretted that it was not large enough for his citron table.
He con­ sulted his nose whether the bronzes bad the true Corinthian aroma, and criticised the statues of Polyclitus!
Next, com­ plaining that some crystal vases had been spoiled by an ad­ mixture of glass, he marked and set aside ten myrrh ine cups.
He weighed ancient bowls, and inquired for goblets that had been ennobled by the hand of Mentor.
He counted emeralds set in chased gold, and examined the largest pearl ear-pendants.
He sought on every counter for real sardo­ nyxes, and cheapened some large jaspers.
At last, when forced by fatigue to retire at the eleventh hour, he bought two cups for one small coin, and carried them home himself.
Mamurra many hours does vagrant tell I' th' shops, where Rome her richest ware does sell Behold fair boys, devours them with his eyes, Not those of common note, one first espies;
But which in inner rooms they closely mew, Removed from mine, and from the people's view.
Glutted with these, choice tables he uncases, Others of ivory, set high, displaces.
Rich tortoise beds he measures four times o'er, Sighs, they fit not, and leaves them on that score Consults the statues of Corinthian brass
By the scent;
and not without blame lets pass
Thy pieces, Polyclet.
He next complains
Of crystals mix'd with glass, and them disdains.
Marks porcelain cups, sets ten of them apart:
Weighs antique plate (of Mentors noble art If any be);
counts, it th’ enamell'd gold, The gems that stand.
Rich pendants does behold :
For the sardonyx makes a search most nice, And of the biggest jaspers beats the price.
Tir'd now at last, after eleven hours' stay, Two farthing pots he bought, and himself bore away.
Anon. 1695.
Vainlove the live-long day strolls up and down, To view the choicest rarities in town.
Ravish'd admires a Ganymede's soft mien;
Not such as is at common auctions seen ;
But an old painting, capital, and rare;
Shown to the curious, and preserv'd with care.
Then takes an inlaid table from its case:
Searches a china jar, or marble vase.
A Turkey carpet measures ten times o'er;
And grieves it is too little for his floor.
Of right japan then judges by his nose:
In statues dares Sir Andrew's taste expose:
Finds the French ware too much to glass allied ;
The Dresden therefore marks, and sets aside.
Baskets of filligrane he then takes up ;
By Kent ennobled weighs a golden cup.
Numbers the jewels that a ring may bear;
And wants a pendant for a lady's ear;
Looks till he diamonds of true water meets, And cheapens them, though half as big as Pitt's.
At length fatigued, the hour of dinner come, He buys and bears two glass decanters home.

Whether thou wast produced in the fields of Pæstum or of Tivoli, or whether the plains of Tusculum were decked with thy flowers;

Did Pæstum’s gales, or Tibur’s, bid thee blow P Or Tusculum elicit all thy glow ?

In the regions about the Tartessus, where the rich lands of Cordova are watered by placid Bætis, where the yellow flocks shine with the gold of the river, and living metal decks the fleece of Hesperian sheep, stands a well-known mansion, and in the midst of its courts, overshadowing the whole of the surrounding buildings, rises the plane-tree of Cæsar, with its thick foliage, which was planted by the auspicious right hand of that invincible guest, and tended by it while yet a sapling.
This tree seems to acknowledge by its vigour its parent and lord;
so richly does it flourish, and lift its branches towards the stars.
Often, under this tree, have the playful Fauna sported with their midnight music, and the pipe has startled tne quiet homestead;
often has the woodland Dryad, while flying from the nocturnal marauder Pan across the solitary fields, sought shelter beneath it;
and often have the house­ hold gods retained the odour of the Bacchanalian banquets, which by their libations have developed its luxuriance.
The turf has been strewed and vermilioned with the chaplets of yesterday, and no man could distinguish the roses that had belonged to his own.
0 tree, favourite of the gods, tree of the great Cæsar, fear not the axe nor the impious fire.
Thou mayst hope for the glory of an ever-verdant foliage;
thou wast not planted by Pompeian hands.
A well-known house doth in that country stand Where Bætis waters Corduba's rich land, Where wools their native mettal's colour keepe, And growing goldfoile gilds the Spanish sheepe.
In midst of th house, her gods ore-shadowing, Does Cæsar’s plaine-tree prosperously spring, Planted by that victorious guest, from whose Imperiall hand the tender twigg arose;
Which now it seems her lord and founder knowes, She spreads so fast her sky-aspiring bowes.
Under that shade the rusticke Dryades And wanton Fauns themselves with sporting please ;
And oft, as she by night from Pan doth fly, This silent house doth Syrinx terrific.
There oft hath Bacchus kept his revelling, When wine has made the tree more richly spring.
There roses grow t' adorne the drinking crowne;
And none can say those roses are his owne.
Great Cæsar’s tree, to all the gods most deare, No sacrilegious fire, nor hatchets feare;
Still mayst thou hope honoured with leaves to bee;
’Twas no Pompeian hand that planted thee.

If Philænis wears all day and night garments dyed with Tyrian purple, it is not that she is extravagant or proud;
it is the odour that pleases her,1 not the colour.
That Tyrian tinge, both night and day, Philænis in her trappings uses;
Nor pomp, nor pride, bespeaks th' array:
The odour, not the hue, she chooses.

2Cæsar, having deigned to assume the form of the mighty Hercules, adds a new temple to the Latian way, at the spot , where the traveller, who visits the grove of Diana, reads the inscription on the eighth milestone from the Queen of Cities.
Formerly, 0 Romans, you used to worship Hercules, as the superior, with prayers and abundant blood of victims, now Hercules, as the inferior, worships Domitian.
We address our more important prayers, some for wealth, others for hon­ ours, to Domitian, who, unsolicitous about inferior requests, leaves the fulfilment of these to Hercules.
Into august Alcides' form Augustus deigned to descend:
Sublimer strengths than his to storm, And temples to the Latian lend.
Where, while the wand'rer's weary feet Explore fair Trivia's woodland scene, Marble the eighth he joys to meet, Sequestered from the city-queen.
With copious blood, and pious vows, Alcides whilom was address’d:
But lo!
his greater he allows;
And bends, obsequious, with the rest.
To one for wealth this suppliant sues, For honour that submiss applies;
While fearless, with inferior views, They plague the hero of the skies.
Elphinston.
O Hercules, whom the Latian Jupiter must now recognise, since thou hast assumed the glorious features of the divine Cæsar, if thou hadst borne those lineaments and that air when the wild beasts yielded to thy prowess, nations would not have beheld thee a slave to the Argive tyrant, and submitting to his cruel rule;
but thou wouldst have issued orders to Eurys­ theus, and the deceiver Lichas would not have brought thee the perfidious gift of Nessus.
Saved from the torment of the funeral pyre upon mount Œta, thou would have ascended to the heaven of thy father above, free from all care, that heaven to which thy labours entitled thee.
Nor wouldst thou have twirled the Lydian spindles of a proud mistress, or have looked upon Styx and the dog of Tartarus.
Now Juno is favourable to thee, now thy Hebe indeed loves thee;
now, if the nymph that carried off thy Hylas were to see thy majestic appearance, she would send him back to thee.
Thee must the Latian Thund'rer gladly own, Where Cæsar’s godlike lineaments are known.
Had then thy guise and aspect been the same, When thy hands rendered savage monsters tame, Mankind had ne'er with due disdain beheld
The tyrant honoured, and the hero quell'd;
Or in Argolic thraldom seen the brave;
But seen Eurystheus prove Alcides’ slave.
Nor had sly Lichas made thy blood to boil, With the dire present of the Centaur's spoil.
Free from the tasks of pow'r, or goads of guile, Free from the torments of th' CEtean pile, Thou hadst securely climb'd thy sire's domain, Nor storm'd its summits by the strength of pain.
From hands heroic none had dancing seen The Lydian spindles of the haughty queen.
Ne'er hadst thou visited the shades below, Nor the Tartarean dog couldst ever know.
Now Juno smiles;
fair Hebe now adores;
And Amphydacia Hylas' self restores.

When you have a wife, handsome, chaste, and young, Fa­ bullus, why should you supplicate for the rights of a father of three children ?

That which you ask of our ruler and deity, you will obtain from yourself if you deserve the name of a man.

What right have you to disturb me, abominable school­ master, object abhorred alike by boys and girls ?
Before the crested cocks have broken silence, you begin to roar out your savage scoldings and blows.
Not with louder noise does the metal resound on the struck anvil, when the workman is fitting a lawyer on his horse;
1 nor is the noise so great in the large amphitheatre, when the conquering gladiator is ap­ plauded by his partisans.
We, your neighbours, do not ask you to allow us to sleep for the whole night, for it is but a small matter to be occasionally awakened;
but to be kept awake all night is a heavy affliction.
Dismiss your scholars, brawler, and take as much for keeping quiet as you receive for making a noise.
Despiteful pedant, why dost me pursue, Thou hated head by all the younger crew ?
Before the cock proclaims the day is near, Thy direful threats and lashes stun mine ear;
The anvil ring ..ot out a shriller sound, When massy hammers the hot irons pound ;
Statues of brass with lesser din are made, Than thou dost carry on the grammar trade;
Shouts in the race and theatre are less, When factions for their parties zeal express
Whole nights, I ask not, in repose to keep;
To wake ’s not grievous, but 'tis, ne'er to sleep.
Wilt leave thy school, thy bawling lectures cease?
Thy gain shall greater be to hold thy peace.
Anon. 1695.“ O times! 0 manners!" was of old the cry of Cicero, when Catiline was contriving his impious plot;
when father-in-law and son-in-law were engaging in fierce war, and the sad soil of Italy was soaked with civil bloodshed.
But why do you, Cæcilianus, now exclaim " 0 times!
0 manners ? "
What is it that displeases you ?
We have no cruel leaders, no mad­ dening warfare, but may enjoy settled peace and happiness.
It is not our morals, Cæcilianus, that disgrace the age of which you complain, but your own.
Oh!
the degenerate age!
great Tully cried, When Catiline design d his parricide:
When kindred chiefs join'd battle on the plain, Which moum'd in tears of blood the subject slain.
Oh!
the degenerate age!
you loudly chatter:
What is the matter, Sir, what is the matter ?
No civil discord now:
no tyrant's power:
Peaceful and blissful passes every hour.
If you esteem the age so wicked grown, Blame not our morals for it, but your own.
Hay. “ O times!
0 manners!"
Tully cried of old, When Catiline in impious plots grew bold;
When in full arms the son and father stood, And the sad earth reek'd red with civil blood:
Why now, why now, “ 0 times!
0 manners!" cry ?
What is it now that shocks thy purity ?
No sword now maddens, and no chiefs destroy, But all is peace, security, and joy.
These times, these manners, that so vile are grown, Prythee, Cæcilian, are they not thy own P Elton.
It is astonishing with what attachment this lion, the glory of the Massylian mountains and this husband of the fleecy flock, are united.
Behold with your own eyes;
they dwell in one stall, and take their social meals in company.
Nor do they delight to feed on the brood of forests, or the tender grass;
but a small lamb satisfies their joint appetites.
What were the merits of the terror of Nemea,1 or the betrayer of Heller that they should shine among brilliant constellations in the high heaven ?
If cattle and wild beasts are worthy of a place in the heavens, this ram and this lion deserve to become stars.
O Liber, whose brows are adorned with the Spartan crown, and whose Roman hand strikes blows worthy of Greece, when you send me a dinner, why does the wicker basket, in which it is conveyed, contain no wine-flask as an accompaniment ?
If you mean to make presents worthy of your name,3 you are aware, I suppose, what you ought to have sent me.
O thou, whose forehead boasts Amyclæ’s band, Who deal'st the Grecian blows with Latian hand!
My nooning why didst bid the wicker bear, Nor with the wattles bid the flask repair P Worthy thy name hadst thou the boons bestow'd, My Liber knows what on his friend had flow'd.

You, whose business it once was to stretch old skins with your teeth, and to bite old soles of shoes besmeared with mud, now enjoy the lands of your deluded patron at Præneste, where you are not worthy to occupy even a stall.
Intox­ icated with strong Falernian wine, too, you dash in pieces the crystal cups, and plunge yourself in debauchery with your patron's favourite.
As for me, my foolish parents taught me letters.
What did I want with grammarians and rhetorici­ ans ?
Break up, my muse, your flowing pen, and tear up your books, if a shoe can secure such enjoyments to a cobbler.
Who with your teeth the stretching leather drew, To patch a hole in an old dirty shoe;
To you your cheated lord's possessions fall, In which you scarce deserve to have a stall.
In amorous fits succeeding to his lasses;
And in your drunken frolics breaking glasses.
My learning only proves my father fool:
Why would he send me to a grammar school ?
Ah !
cease, my muse!
your works consign to fire!
If an old shoe may serve to raise us higher.
He,!.This picture preserves the likeness of Camonus as a child ;
it is only his early features, when he was an infant, that re­ main to us.
The affectionate father has kept no likeness of his countenance in the bloom of manhood, dreading to look on so fine a face deprived of animation.
Here, as in happy infancy he smiled, Behold Camonus—painted as a child;
For on his face as seen in manhood's days, His sorrowing father would not dare to gaze.
W. S. B.Tucca has not constructed his bath of hard flint, or of quarry stone, or of baked bricks, with which Semiramis en­ circled great Babylon, but of the spoils of the forest and masses of pine planks, so that he may sail in his bath.
The same magnificent personage has built splendid warm baths of every kind of marble;
that which Carystos produces;
that which Phrygian Synnas,1 and African Numidia, sends us;
and that which the Eurotas has washed with its verdant stream.
But there is no wood in it;
put your wooden bath, therefore, Tucca.
beneath your warm baths.
No stubborn flint, by cement bound, Or that the queen could rear around Her haughty town, made Tucca's bath:
But murder'd groves, and mortised pines, Exalted Tucca's grand designs;
That he might swim in cooling lath.
A hot bath next he built, sublime, Of marble hewn in every clime, Carystos, Synnas, Nomas send :
Or that the green Eurotas laves.
But wood was wanting to the waves:
Then to the hot the cold-bath lend.

The features you here see are those of my Camonus;
such was his face and figure in early youth.
That counten­ ance had grown more manly in the course of twenty years;
a beard seemed delighted to shade his cheeks;
and, once clip­ ped, had scattered its ruddy hair from the points of the scis­ sors.
One of the three sisters looked with malice on such beauty, and cut the thread of his life before it was fully spun.
An urn conveyed his ashes to his father from a far distant pyre;
but that the picture may not alone speak of the youth, there shall be a more impressive description in my page.
This which you see is my Camonus' face;
Such his young looks, such his first beauty was.
His countenance grew stronger twice ten years, Till a beard cream'd his cheeks with downy hairs.
The offer'd purple once his shoulders spread, But one of the three sisters wished him dead, And thence his hastened thread of life did cut, Which to his father, in a sad urn put, Came from his absent pile :
but lest alone
This picture should present his beauty gone, His image yet more sweetly drawn shall be In never-dying papers writ by me.

The eloquent page of Priscus considers “ what is the best kind of feast?" and offers many suggestions with grace, many with force, and all with learning.
Do you ask me, what is the best kind of feast ?
That at which no flute-player is present.
1 Priscus with art in many leaves disputes,
What requisites a sumptuous feast best suits ;
Many sublime and witty things be brings, All from a learn’d and noble art which springs.
What makes a feast, shall I in one line say P Absence of scurrilous jests and fiddlers' play.

Before thy reign, Rome hated the crowd attendant on the emperors, and the haughtiness of the court;
but now, such is our love, Augustus, for all that belongs to thee, that every one makes the care of his own family of but secondary consider­ ation ;
so sweet are the tempers of thy courtiers, so consi­ derate are they towards us, so much of quiet good-feeling do they display, and so much modesty is there in their bearing.
Indeed, no servant of Cæsar (such is the influence of a power­ ful court) wears his own character-but that of his master.
Cæsar, our former princes' courtly state, And throngs of haughty servants, Rome did hate;
But of your house all now so tender are, That each man's own is but his second care :
Such gentle mindes, such reverence of you, Such quietness, such modesty, all shew, As proves (which is the nature of great courts)
Each to his princess guise his own comports.

My readers and hearers, Aulus, approve of my composi­ tions ;

I am not much concerned at his censure;

But what care I ? for when I make a least, I would my guests should praise it, not the cooks.

An astrologer declared, Munna, that you would soon come to an end ;
and I believe he spoke the truth.
For, through fear of leaving anything behind you, you have squandered your inheritance in luxuries;
your two millions have dwindled away in less than a year.
Tell me, Munna, is not this com ing soon to an end ?
True spoke the conjurer, when he foretold Your end, before that twice six moons had roll’d.
You took the hint;
spent your estate with care, For fear of being bubbled by your heir.
Twice ten years' income spent at once;

Among the numberless wonders of your arena, Cæsar, which surpasses the splendid shows of the old emperors, our eyes confess that they owe you much, but our ears more ;
inasmuch as those who used to recite upon the stage are now only spectators.

When your affectionate fidelity, Norbanus, was standing in defence of Cæsar against the raging of sacrilegious fury, 1, the well-known cultivator of your friendship, was amusing myself with the composition of these verses, in the calm security of Pierian retreats.
The Rhætian spoke of me to you on the borders of Vindelicia, nor was the Northern Bear ignorant of my name.
Oh how often, not renouncing your old friend, did you exclaim, "It is my poet, my own!"
All my compo- sitions, which for six whole years your reader has recited to you, their author will now present to you in a body.
While thee, to quell the sacrilegious rage, Fair loyalty would for thy lord engage;
Safe wanton'd in the sweet Pierian shade, Who Norban's friendship held his primal aid.
My death to Vindelician shores had flown;
Nor was my name to northern climes unknown.
Thine ancient friend thou never didst deny:
My bard!

While Silius, whose powers have been displayed in more than one department of Roman literature,1 was lamenting the premature death of his friend Severus, I expressed my sym­ pathy with him to the Pierian choir and to Phœbus:
“ I too," said Apollo, " wept for my Linus;
” and, looking round at Calliope, who stood next to her brother, he added:
“ You nlso have your own sorrow.
1 Behold the Tarpeian and the Palatine Thunderer;
Lachesis has audaciously presumed to wound both Jupiters.

When you see the divinities exposed to the harsh rule of destiny, you may acquit the gods of in­ justice.
Thee, Silius, not one way renown'd, Thy rapt Severe in sorrow drown'd;
Each muse, nay Phœbus, mourned with me:
I wept my Linus too, said he.
Calliope then caught his eye:
" Sweet sister, thou hast had thy sigh Palatine and Tarpeian Jove;
'Gainst both bold Lachesis has strove.
If fate with us can be at odds, No more let envy load the gods.

So, reclining upon the flowery meads, where rolling pebbles sparkle in the brook, its winding banks glowing on every side, may you break the ice into the goblet of dark wine, far removed from all cares, and your brow wreathed with chaplets of roses;
so may you enjoy alone the caresses of a favourite, and the pleasures of a chaste love, as you keep on your guard, I warn and pray you, Flaccus, against the climate of Cyprus, too well known for its excessive heat, when the threshing-floor receives the crackling harvest, and the mane of the tawny lion glows in its fierceness.
And do thou, goddess of Paphoa, send back the youth, send him back unharmed, to my prayers.
So may the kalends of March be ever consecrated to thee, and may many a slice of cake, with incense, and wine, and offerings, be laid upon thy fair altars.
So stretched on the flowery grass, Where o'er the moved pebbles pass Pure streames, with waves curling about, Farr thence all troubled thoughts cast out:
With coole ice may your cuppa abound, Your browes with rosy garlands crown'd;
So may your mistress, and your boy, To you be kind, to others coy, As you of your own health take care, In Cyprus's too sultry ayre, When the ripe come is layd i' th' floore, And Leo's scorching rage boyles o'er.
So, Venus, may much wine and spice, On altars pure in sacrifice, On Mars's calends offer d bee, With many a piece of cake, to thee!

If two messengers were to invite me to dine in different heavens, the one in that of Cæsar, the other in that of Ju­ piter, I should, even if the stars were nearer, and the palace at the greater distance, return this answer:
"Seek some other who would prefer to be the guest of the Thunderer;
my own Jupiter detains me upon earth."
If that a diverse invitation came
At once in Jove's and in great Cesar's name, Though that the stars were near, Rome more remote, The gods in answer should have this my vote, " Go, seek another that Jove's guest would be, My Jupiter on earth hath fettered me."

Of the troubles of a master, and the pleasures of a slave, Condylus, you are ignorant, when you lament that you have been a slave so long.
A common rug gives you sleep free from all anxiety;
Caius lies awake all night on his bed of down.
Caius, from the first dawn of day, salutes with trembling a number of patrons;
you, Condylus, salute not even your master.
"
Caius, pay what you owe me," cries Phœbus on the one side, and Cinnamus on the other;
no one makes such a demand on you, Condylus.
Do you fear the torturer P Caius is a martyr to the gout in his hands and feet, and would rather suffer a thousand floggings than endure its pains.
You indulge neither gluttonous nor licentious propensities.
Is not this preferable to being three times a Caius ?
More ease than masters' servants' lives afford:
Think on that, Tom;
nor wish to be your lord.

Deep sunk in down he counts each sleepless hour;
Anxious betimes to every statesman low He bows;
much lower than to him you bow.
Behold him with a dun at either ear, "Pay, pay," the word ;
a word you never hear.
Fear you a cudgel ?
view his gouty state;
Which he would change for many a broken pate.
You know no morning qualm, no costly whore:

Athenagoras was once Alphius;
now, since he has taken a wife, he has begun to call himself Olphius.
Do you believe, Callistratus, that his real name is Athenagoras ?
May I die if I know who Athenagoras is!

if I call him otherwise, it is not I who am in fault, but your friend Athenagoras himself.

A certain person, my dearest Julius, is bursting with envy because Rome reads me;
he is bursting, I say, with envy.
He is bursting with envy, too, bursting with envy, be­ cause in every assembly I am pointed out by the finger of admiration.
He is bursting with envy, bursting with envy, because both Cæsars 1 accorded me the rights of a father of three children.
He is bursting with envy, bursting with envy, because I have an agreeable suburban villa and a small house in town.
He is bursting with envy, bursting with envy, because I am dear to my friends, and because I am their fre­ quent guest.
He is bursting with envy, because I am loved and praised.
Whoever is bursting with envy, let him burst Bursting with envy is a wretch unknown, Because my works have taken with the town.
With envy bursting, that the admiring throng Point to their poet as they pass along.
With envy bursting, that by royal grace, Under my sovereign I enjoy a place.
With envy bursting, at my house in town,
And at my little box on Bansted Down.
Bursting with envy, that I am caress'd
By all my friends, to all a welcome guest.
From love, and from esteem, if envy springs, May he e'en fret his guts to fiddle-strings.

My toga is threadbare, shabby, and even ragged;

O Appian way, which Cæsar consecrates under the form of Hercules,2 and renders the most celebrated of Italian roads, if thou desirest to learn the deeds of the ancient Hercules, listen to me.
lie subdued the Libyan giant;
he carried off the golden apples;
he disarmed the Amazonian queen of her shield, though secured by a Scythian girdle;
by feat of arms he added the lion's skin to that of the Arcadian boar;
be delivered the forest from the brazen-footed stag and the lakes of Arcadia from the Stymphalian birds;
he brought from the waters of Styx the infernal dog Cerberus;
he prevented the fruitful Hydra from renewing its heads after they bad been cut off;
he plunged the horned bulls of Hesperia in the Tus­ can Tiber.
Such were the achievements of the ancient and lesser Hercules.
Listen now to the deeds of the greater Hercules, whom the sixth milestone from the citadel of Alba celebrates.
He freed the palace from the thraldom of a bad rule.
His first wars, as a boy, were waged in defence of his patron Jupiter.
1
When already in sole possession of the Cæsarean reins of government, he resigned them to his father, contenting himself to become the third citizen in his own world.
2
Thrice he broke the perfidious horns of the Sarmatian Danube;
thrice he cooled his sweating steed in the Getic snows.
Foi bearing to accept the honours of a triumph, and often re­ fusing them, he acquired a title, as a conqueror, from the Northern climes.
He gave temples to the gods, morals to his people, rest to the sword, heaven to his family,1 constel­ lations to the skies, garlands to Jupiter.
The divinity of a Hercules is not sufficient for acts so great;
our deity should be represented under the form of Tarpeian Jupiter.
O Appian!
who thine awful shall display ?
Thou peerless glory of th' Ausonian way !
To Ctesar sacred, in Herculean guise, Thy feet on earth, thy fame is in the skies.
Would'st thou admire the first Alcides' deeds, And then compare Alcides who succeeds ?
One tamed the Libyan, and the dragon tore:
The victor-god the golden apples bore.
How hard was buckler'd Menalippe's lot!
He bid the fair unloose the Scythian knot.
What need I sing the lion whom he slew;
Or scared Arcadia's boar he overthrew?
From woods he drove the brazen-footed hind, The birds Stymphalian from the waves and wind.
Safe he return'd, from out the Stygian bogf Unquitted, but unworried by the dig.
The Hydra he forbade to spring by blood.
And cows Hesperian lav'd in Tuscan flood.
Such were the toils of Hercules the less ;
The glory of his greater now confess:
Whose majesty is worshipp'd, and whose pow'r, By the sixth marble from the Alban tow'r.
'Twas his, fell usurpation to destroy;
And for his Jove he warfar'd, yet a boy.
When now he held the Julian reins alone, He sat but third upon the human throne.
The treach'rous horns of Ister thrice he broke, In Getic snow thrice quenched his charger's smoke.
To conquer ardent, and to triumph shy, Fair vict'rv nam'd him from the polar sky.
Fanes to the gods, to men he manners gave;
Rest to the sword, and respite to the brave ;
Stars to his own, constellants to th' alcove, And wreaths refreshing to immortal Jove.
So high could ne'er Herculean pow'r aspire:
The god should lend his looks to the Tarpeian fire.

You give me back, Phoebus, my bond for four hundred thousand sesterces;
lend me rather a hundred thousand more.
Seek some one else to whom you may vaunt your empty present:

What new Leda has produced you these attendants so like each other?
What fair Spartan has been captivated by another swan ?
Pollux has given his face to Hierus, Castor his to Asil­ lus ;
and in the countenance of each gleams the beauty of their Tyndarean sister (Helen).
Had these beautiful figures been in Therapnaean Amyelse, when the inferior present prevailed over those of the two other goddesses, 1 Helen would have remained at Sparta, and Trojan Paris have returned to Phry­ gian Ida with two Ganymedes.
Whence so much likeness, so much sweetness, grew P To bear these twins did Leda brood a-new ?
If this is Pollux, that is Castoris face :
In both alike there shines the sister's grace.
When rivals yielded to the Cyprian queen ;
At Sparta's court had so much beauty been, The Phrygian Paris had reversed his deed;
And, leaving Helen, stole each Ganymede.

Whoever, despising the matron and the noble, whom he ought to respect, has injured them with impious verse;
may he wander through town after town, an outcast on bridge and hill, and lowest among craving mendicants, may he entreat for mouthfuls of the spoilt bread reserved for the dogs.
May December be dreary to him, and the dripping winter and close cell prolong the cheerless cold.
May he call those blessed, and pronounce them happy, who are borne past him upon the funeral bier.
And when the thread of his last hour is spun, and the day of death, which has seem­ ed too slow, has arrived, may he hear around him the howling of dogs for his body, and have to drive off the birds of prey by shaking his rags.
Nor may the punishment of the abject wretch end with his death;
but, sometimes lashed with the thongs of the severe Æacus, sometimes burthened with the mountain- stone of unresting Sisyphus, sometimes thirsting amid the waters of the babbling old Tantalus, may he exhaust all the fabled torments of the poets;
and when the Furies shall have compelled him to confess the truth, may he exclaim, betrayed by his conscience, " I wrote those verses."
Whoso by impious verse in all the town Scandals the senator's or matron's gown, Which rather ought be worshipped, let him be Banished through all the seats of beggary;
And let him from the dogs bespeak their meat;
Be his December long, his winter wet;
Let his shut vault prolong the frost most sad;
And let him cry such happy that are dead, On hellish-bedsteds carried to their grave;
And when his last threads their fulfilling have, And the slow day shall come, oh, let him see Himself the strife of dogs, and his limbs be The prey of rav'nous birds, nor let his paint End in the simple crack of his heart's veins, But feeling the strict doom of Æacus, One while let him relieve old Sisyphus, Then scorch in Tantalus his dry desire, And all the fables of the poets tire;
And when the truth the Furies shall demand, May his false conscience cry, This was the hand.

What do you leave to me, Pau­ lus, who am sprung from Numa’s people, and am simply one of the plebeian crowd ?
Shall I salute as lord and king every one who honours me with a look ?
This you do yourself, and oh!
with what superior grace!
Shall I follow somebody's litter, or chair ?
You are not above this office yourself, and you even struggle for the distinction of walking foremost through the midst of the mud.
Shall I frequently rise to applaud a poet who recites his verses ?
You remain standing all the time, with both hands stretched out towards the author.
What is a poor man to do, when he cannot even be a client ?
Your purple has supplanted our plain togas.
When thou of consular rank think'st it no scorn A hundred to salute by early morn ;
What office, Paulus, leav'st thou unto me, And to Home's numerous throng of low degree ?
Who stoops himself, shall I call lord and king?
Crouch to one acts the fawning underling ?
Shall I attend his chair, who does not shun Others to bear, through 'thick and thin to run ?
To praise men's verse, what boots it oft to rise, When thou, to show applause, dost not despise Always to stand, with hands stretched to the skies ?
What shall mean men do, clients when no more ?
If those are great, share duties with the poor ?

When I asked for a loan of five thousand sesterces, you refused me, though your overstocked cash-box could not contain your hoards.
When did you give me a bushel of beans or grain, though you have lands ploughed by Egyptian husbandmen?
When was even a scanty toga sent me in the cold winter season ?
When did half a pound of silver find its way to me ?
I see nothing to make me look upon you as a friend, Crispus, but your habit of putting yourself quite at ease in my presence.
You say, I have no better friend than you:
What do you do, to make me think it true P I wanted but five pounds, which you deny;
Though you have useless thousands lying by.
From all the fertile harvests of your plain, When did v q send to me one single grain?
When a short cloak, to guard me from the cold ?
To line my purse, when a small piece of gold ?
I see no mark of friendship on your part;
But, before me, you are free enough to Hay.

He hears no more my flippant strains.

There you will see a glittering statue of Orpheus on the top of a perfume-sprinkled theatre, surrounded by beasts wondering at his music ;
and among them the royal bird which carried off Ganymede for the Thunderer.
Near it is the humble house of your friend Pcdo, surmounted by an eagle with smaller wings.
But take care lest, in a moment of indiscretion, you knock at the learned Pliny's door at au inauspicious time.
He devotes his whole days to the severe Minerva, while preparing for the ears of the centumviri that which our own age and posterity may compare even with the eloquent pages of Cicero.
You will go with the best chance of success when the evening lamps are lighted.
That hour is for you the best when the god of wine reigns, when the rose holds its sway, and the hair is moistened with perfumes.
Then even rigid Catos read me.

from whence, thou Orpheus (set on high, Dash'd by the theatre) plainly shalt descry;
The wond'ring beasts, the king of birds and air, Which the young Phrygian to the Thund'rer bear :
There thy friend Pedo ’s house stands also by, Showing a lesser eagle carv'd on high.
But to learn'd Pliny make not thy address Wanton, but when time suits for thy access;
He in severer studies spends the day, 4 How he the Hundred Judges best may away Studies, which ours, nor no age, will forbear, With Tully's noblest labours to compare.
Thou'lt safeli’st go when it is candle-light;
This is the hour when Bacchus mads the night ;
When odours reign, when roses crown the head, By rigid Cato then thou may'st be read.

and yet a sweeter air No country yields, or may with Spain compare.
But, wert with thee, I Scythia could enjoy, Nor would the sands of Africk me annoy.
If mutual love thou bear'fit and a like mind, Rome we shall both in ev'ry climate find.
Anon. 1695.
Why, I ask, Sextus, is it your delight to produce com­ positions which even Modestus himself, or Claranus, could scarcely understand ?
Your books require, not a reader, but an Apollo.
In your judgment Cinna was a greater poet than Virgil.
May your works receive similar praise!
As for mine, I am content that they please the Grammarians, provided they please others without the aid of Grammarians.
What pleasure is it, that your writings are Almost too hard for Bentley or for Hare?
You write not to be read, but criticis’d :
Persius you follow ;
Virgil is despis'd.
This be your praise:
but may my every line, Or with a comment, or without it, shine.

Do you ask, Philæmis, why I often come abroad with plaister on my chin, or with my lips covered with salve when nothing ails them ?
I do not wish to kiss you.
Why on my chin a plaster clapped;
Besalv'd my lips, that are not chapped:
Philænis, why ?
The cause is this:
Philænis, thee I will not kiss.

The happy Antonius Primus now numbers fifteen Olym­ piads (75 years) passed in tranquillity;
he looks back upon the days that are gone, and the whole of his past years, with­ out fearing the waters of Lethe to which he daily draws nearer.
Not one day of his brings remorse or an unpleasant reflection;
there is none which he would be unwilling to re­ call.
A good man lengthens his term of existence;
to be able to enjoy our past life is to live twice.
At length, my friend (while time with still career Wafts on his gentle wing this eightieth year), Sees his past days safe out of Fortune's pow'r, Nor dreads approaching fate's uncertain hour;
Reviews his life, and, in the strict survey, Finds not one moment he could wish away, Pleas'd with the series of each happy day.
Such, such a man extends his life's short space, And from the goal again renews the race:
For he lives twice who can at once employ
The present well, and e'en the past enjoy.
Pope.O Kalends of March, anniversary of my birth, day more charming to me than any other kalends, day on which even maidens send me presents, I place upon the hearth, in honour of you, these cakes, and this censer, for the fifty-seventh time.
To these years (provided it be for my good) add at my en treaty, I beseech you, twice nine more, so that I may de­ scend to the groves of the Elysian queen while still undis­ abled with protracted old age, yet having accomplished the three stages of life.
After such a Nestor's existence, I will not ask for a single day more.
Mars’s calends, ne'er outshin'd I Fairest of the calend-kind!
When to me the maids present Fifty cakes for half a cent:
With the fifty, truth requires Censer seventh, upon your fires.
Still to these, if so be best, Add twice nine, I meek obtest;
That, not yet quite spent with age, Though thrice trod the youthful stage, I may seek Elysian groves:
Earthly wish no wider roves.

If that Mucius, whom we lately beheld in the arena in the morning, and who thrust his band into the blazing fire, appears to you to be a man of patience, fortitude, and endurance, you have no more sense than the people of Abdera;
for when a man is commanded, with the alternative of the pitched shirt before his eyes, to burn his hand, it would be more courage­ ous to say, " I will not burn it!
"
Who Mucius acted on the stages sand, So promptly thrust into the flame his hand;
If brave and bold for this thou him dost deem, Thyself of some dull clime I must esteem :
To save his life by this means was his case;
’Twere braver far to have refused the grace.
Anon. 1695.
O Varus, thou who wast but lately a Roman officer of rank among the Parætonian cities, and a distinguished leader of a hundred men, art now reposing, a strange shade, on the Egyp­ tian shore;
your return is vainly expected by the Ausonian Quirinus.
It was not permitted us to moisten thy parching lips with our tears, nor to place rich incense on thy sad pyre.
But an enduring tribute shall be given thee in immortal verse.
Wouldst thou, perfidious Nile, also deprive us of thie P Varus, who as Rome's Tribune didst Command An hundred men, renowned in Egypt’s land.
Now as a stranger ghost thou dost remaine On Nilus’ shore, promised to Rome in vaine.
We could not dew with teares thy dying face, Nor thy sad funerall flames with odours grace , Yet in my verse eterniz’d shalt thou bee:
Of that false Ægypt cannot cousen thee.

On your birth-day, Diodorus, the senate and a great many knights sit as guests at your table;
and your sportula is a largess of no less than thirty sesterces to each person.
And yet, Diodorus, no one regards you as a man of birth.
The senate did thy birth-day celebrate;
Many knights also at thy table sat:
Largess thou gav'st;
yet still thou'rt all men's scorn;
None will believe that ever thou wert born.

O most honoured father of years, and of this glorious uni­ verse, to whom first of all the gods the public vows and pray­ ers are addressed, thou wert formerly wont to dwell in a small temple, open to all, and through which the busy crowd of Rome wore their constant way.
Now thy threshold is sur­ rounded with tokens of the munificence of Cæsar, and thou numberest, Janus, as many forums as thou hast faces.
But do thou, venerable father, in gratitude for such a boon, secure thy iron gates with a perpetual bolt.
1 Father of years, and of each beauteous round;
Whom first our vows invoke, our thanks resound!
Pervious and scanty was thy late abode, Where many a Roman beat a barb'rous road.
Now gifts Cesarean thy glad thresholds grace, And thou a square enjoy'st for every face.
For these, 0 sacred fire!

To lock thy cloisters with perpetual key.

The dish which you were wont to present to me, Sextilianus, at the Saturnalia, you have bestowed on your mistress:
and with the price of my toga, which you used to give me on the first of March, you have bought her a green dinner robe.
Your mistresses now begin to cost you nothing;
you enjoy them at my expense.
In the days of old Saturn you dol'd me a dish, Which you now throw your damsel, like bait to a fish.
On the calends of March you enlarged my renown ;
Now you buy the green vest with the price of my gown.
The fair fav'rites, Sextilian, you render so gay, Are, by my presents only, enroll'd in your pay.

O delightful shore of salubrious Formiæ ;
Apollinaris, when he Sees from the city of stern Mars, and wearied lays aside his anxious cares, prefers thee to every other spot.
The charming Tivoli, the birth-place of his virtuous wife, is not to him so attractive, neither are the retreats of Tusculum, or Algidus, or Præneste, or Antium.
He pines not after the bland Circe, or Trojan Caieta, or Marica, or Liris, or the fountain of Salmacis, which feeds the Lucrine lake.
At Formiæ the surface of the ocean is but gently crisped by the breeze;
and though tranquil, is ever in motion, and bears along the painted skiff under the influence of a gale as gentle as that wafted by a maiden's fan when she is distressed by heat.
Nor has the fishing-line to seek its victim far out at sea;
but the fish may be seen beneath the pellucid waters, seizing the line as it drops from the chamber or the couch.
Were AEolus ever to send a storm, the table, still sure of its provision, might laugh at his railings;
for the native fish-pool protects the turbot and the pike ;
delicate lampreys swim up to their master;
delicious mullet obey the call of the keeper, and the old carp come forth at the sound of his voice.
But when does Rome permit him to partake of these enjoy­ ments P
How many days at Formiæ does the year allot to him, closely chained as he is to the pursuits of the city ?
Happy gate-keepers and bailiffs!
These gratifications pro­ vided for your masters, are enjoyed by you.
O Bay of Formiæ, temperate and fair!
Which, when Apollinaris, tir'd with care, Flies from the toilsome business of the town, Than pleasant Tybur holds in more renown, His chaste wife's soil:
prefers to th' sweet recess Of Tusculane, Præneste, Lucrine;
less Esteems Cajeta, or what men more admire.
Rais’d by their fancy or by fiction higher.
A gentle air here glides o'er Thetis' face, Such as the fans of Virgine make, to chase Summer's ungrateful heat.
The sea is smooth, Not torpid dead, but a soft gale does soothe
The active calm;
and painted gallies move.
For fish you need not launch into the deep, These you may take, and yet your chamber keep, Out at your window cast your line and lead, And draw the dangling prey up to your bed.
And when the waves by winter winds arise, From your safe board you may the storm despise.
Gardens no less, and fresh springs Formiæ grace, Fountains are seen to flow in ev'ry place ;
Fish-ponds the stranger trout and mullet feed, The home-bred pike, which call’d, does come with speed Fat carps here know their names, and to you make, And all a pastime is, no pains, to take.
But to the owners when does Rome give leave, But a few days these pleasures to receive ?
Fruition's lost, while they to business cleave.
These sweets (0 hinds and gard'ners, happy crew!)
Were for your lords prepar’d, but are enjoy'd by you.
Anon. 1693
In vain rude Æolus deforms Old Ocean's brow with rising storms;
Thy splendid board, secure, defies
The angry main and threatening skies.
Within thy ample bason see Each nobler fish that swims the sea;
The stately sturgeon, ocean's pride, The mugil, fond in sands to hide, The turbot, and the mullet old, Are pastured in the liquid fold.
Trained to the summons, lo!
they all Rise at the feeders well-known call.

You sold a slave yesterday for the sum of thirteen hundred sesterces, in order, Calliodorus, that you might dine well once in your life.
Nevertheless you did not dine well;
a mullet of four pounds' weight, which you purchased, was the chief dish, the very crown of your repast.
I feel inclined to exclaim, " It was not a fish, shameless fellow, it was a man, a veritable man, Calliodorus, that you ate."
Thy servant thou for a great sum didst sell, That but once, Callidore, thou might'st fare welL Nor far'd'st thou well:
a mullet of four pound Was the bead dish, which the whole table crown’d.
May we not, wretch, exclaim 'gainst this thy treat P Say, 'twas a man, not fish, that thou didst eat.

Do you ask, Cædicianus, whose lineaments are traced in this picture, which I am adorning with roses and violets ?
Such was Marcus Antonius Primus in the prime of life;
in this portrait the old man sees himself in his youth.
Would that art could have painted his character and his mind!
There would then be no fairer portrait in the whole world.
This picture see!
on which no cost I spare;
But set in gold, and in my snuff-box wear.

Munatius Gallus, more simple in manners than the Sabines of old, more virtuous than the Atbenian sage (Socrates), so may the chaste Venus bless your union, and give you to inherit the noble mansion of your father-in-law, as you exculpate me from having written any verses, tinged with foul malice, which malevolence may have attributed to me;
and as in insist that no poet, who is read, composes such verses.
In all my writings my rule has ever been to lash vices without per­ sonality.
Blest with the morals of a former age, In goodness passing the Athenian sage, May your fair daughter's virtues fix her spouse, And his allies, fast friends unto your house, If when you meet a malice-tinctur'd line, And slandering fame report that it is mine, You vindicate your friend;
and boldly plead, I ne'er compose what 'tis a shame to read :
For in my writings 'tis my constant care To lash the vices, but the persons spare.

May the gods grant thee, 0 Trajan our prince, whatsoever thou deservest, and may they ratify in perpetuity whatsoever they grant;
thou who restorest to the patron the right of which he had been deprived.
He will no longer be regarded by his freedmen as an exile.
Thou art worthy and able to protect the whole body of citizens, and if occasion serves thou wilt prove the truth of my words.
Whatever thou hast deserv'd, may heav'n bestow:
And ratify whatever it gave below!
Who, with their rights restored, sett'st patrons free ;
Nor to their freedmen bidd'st them exiles be.

Let all maidens, who would please only one husband, read Sulpicia.
Let all husbands, who would please only one wife, read Sulpicia.
She does not describe the fury of Medea, or paint the feast of the accursed Thyestes;
nor does she be­ lievein the existence of Scylla or Byblis;
but she tells of chaste and affectionate loves, of pure sports, gratifications, and amusements.
He who shall properly estimate her poems, will say that no one is more modest, no one more loving.
Such I should suppose were the endearments of Egeria in the cool grotto of Numa.
With Sulpicia as fellow-student, or as an instructress, Sappho might have been more learned, and more chaste;
and had cruel Phaon seen both at the same time, he would rather have fallen in love with Sul­ picia.
But in vain;
for she would not sacrifice Calenus to become either the queen of the Thunderer, or the beloved of Bacchus or Apollo.
Let all chaste Virgins, that would wed One man alone, Sulpitia read.
Let all good men, that love the bed
Of one chaste spouse, Sulpitia read.
She sings not of Medea's spells, Nor dire Thyestes’ banquet tells.
Scylla and Byblis stories lies
She counts;
pure loves, and chastities, Sweet sports, and harmeless she relates.
Her verse whoe'er well æstimates, Will say that none are holier.
Such jests, I thinke, Ægeria’s were In that moist cave to Numa's ear.
Brought up with her, or taught by her, Chaste, and more learn'd, had Sappho beene.
But flinty Phao, had he scene
Them both, had lov'd Sulpitia sure, (Although in vaine,) for she, more pure, Would not exchange Calenus' love For Bacchus, Phœbus, or great Jove.

Whatever the dishonest wine vaults of Marseilles contain, whatever cask has assumed age by the help of the flame, comes to us, Munna, from you:
to your unfortunate friends you send, across seas and by circuitous paths, cruel poisons;
nor do you supply them on moderate terms, but at a price for which wine from Falernum, or Setia, so esteemed for their cellars, would be sufficient.
Your reason for not coming to Rome during so long a period is, I suspect, lest you should have to drink your own wine.
All the worst cyder Hereford could make, Mix'd up, and boil'd, for taste and colour's sake, A hundred miles you by the carrier send:
Have you a mind to poison every friend P
And make us pay such monstrous prices for’t, It dearer comes than Malaga or Port.
Perhaps you now have staid so long from town, For fear of drinking cyder, once your own.

O Maternus, most scrupulous observer of law and equity, you who rule the Roman forum by your convincing eloquence, have you any commands for the Spanish Main to send by your fellow-townsman and old friend ?
Or do you imagine it better to catch hideous frogs on the shores of the Tiber, and to angle for poor stickle-backs, than to be able to throw back to its rocky bed the captured mullet because less than three pounds' weight ?
And to feast, at your principal meal, upon a stale crab or a dish of periwinkles, rather than upon oysters which may compare with those of Bairn, and which even the servants are permitted by their master to eat P At Rome you hunt with much ado a stinking fox into your toils, and the filthy captive wounds your dogs.
There (at Bilbilis) the wet fishing nets scarcely drawn up from the depths full of fish, entangle the hares.
While I am speaking, see, your fisher­ man returns with empty creel, and your huntsman comes home proud of having caught a badger;
your every feast comes from the city market to the coast.
Have you any commands for the Spanish main ?
Thou reverend searcher of our equall law, From whose sure mouth Rome's courts their dictates draw, Your cytyzen, and old companion, mee Please you aught to command to th' Spanish sea ?
Whether is't better on Laurentum’s shoare
To catch foule froggs, or little minnow's stoare ?
Or mullets, caught among the rocks in Spayne, Not three pound weight, streight to throw in agayne P Insipid winckles topp of all your feast To make, or little thin-shell'd shrimps at best ?
Rather than oysters, (Baiæ ne'er did yield Better, with which our servants there are fill’d ?
Here the rank foxe, that bites your doggs, you drive With clamorous noyse into your netts alive:
Your fisbing-draggs, scarce drawn from sea, will there, Yett well spread on the shoare, streight catch a hare:

Here see the fisherman returnes with nought, The huntsman’s proud that has a weezel caught:

Your shoares with fish from marketts fumish’d bee.
Please you command me aught to th' Spanish sea ?

Oh how delicious have been the fifteen years of married bliss, Calenus, which the deities have lavished, in full mea­ sure, on thee and thy Sulpicia!
Oh happy nights and hours, how joyfully has each been marked with the precious pearls of the Indian sbore!
1
Oh what contests, what voluptuous strife between you, has the happy couch, and the lamp drip­ ping with Niceronian perfume, witnessed!
Thou hast lived, Ca­ lerus, three lustra, and the whole term is placed to thy ac­ count, but thou countest only thy days of married life.
Were Apropos, at thy urgent request, to bring back to thee but one of those days, thou wouldst prefer it to the long life of Nestor quadrupled.
Twice seven years, and one above it, You have been yoked with Mrs Loveit.
A heavenly blessing such a wife!
You must have led a charming life!
Oh!
happy days!
in which no hour
You can forget in twenty-four.
What nights !
still spent in curtain-lecture!
What struggling, who should be director!
What blest debates!
which oft have lasted Until the candle quite was wasted.
The number of your years, I ween, Don't even now exceed fifteen:
I count not those, which time did give;
But those, you felt yourself alive.
And if, like these, Fate add one more;
That one may-seem to you fourscore.

Why do you swear, Lesbia, that you were born in the consulship of Brutus P You say falsely, Lesbia, you were corn in the reign of Numa.
Should you even admit that, you would seem to say falsely;
for, judging by your decrepi­ tude, you must have been formed by the hand of Prometheus.
Why do you swear that you were born
In good Queen Anna's reign ?
You're out, for by your face forlorn In James's it is plain:
Nay, here you're out;
for sure your age Does show, as one may say, That you were form'd, and in a rage, Of the Promethean clay.

As I was constantly told that my mistress Polla indulged in improper connection with a young libertine, I surprised them, and found they were as proper as my own.

Was she free ?

AOn the return of January you desert your old husband, Proculeia, and force him to consent to a separation of pro­ perty.
What, I ask, has happened ?
Why this sudden dis­ content ?
You answer not ?
I will tell you then:
He was elected Prætor;
his Megalesian purple robe would have cost you a hundred thousand sesterces, even if you had given shows of the most economical kind:
and the public festivities would have cost twenty thousand more.
This is not a divorce, Pro­ culeia:
it is an artifice to save money.
On Michaelmas' eve, it is said, Lady Jane From your husband that you did elope, And tell him that he was the cause of your pain, So bade him go e'en take a rope!
I ask what's the matter, the cause of your sorrow, But nothing you answer again :
I'll tell you, that he'll be lord-mayor to-morrow;
So now your disorder is plain.
Feasts at Easter, Old Bailey, and grave Judges' shows, And many gay generous treats,- But you grudge every farthing of money that goes
In making him fit for such feats:
This is not what alarm'd Lime-street Ward at the first, So to them I'll the true cause explain:
You pine and are famish'd with " gold's sacred thirst," And all your concern then is gain.
Rev. Mr Scott, 1773.
So light is the down upon your cheeks, and so soft, that a breath, or the beat of the sun, or a light breeze, would dis­ perse it.
They are clothed like young quinces which are de­ prived of their bloom, and become smooth by the touch of a maiden's thumb.
Were I to kiss you rather eagerly five times or so, I should become bearded, Dindymus, from the spoil of your lips.
So light upon your cheeks the down, By subtlest breeze it may be blown;
’Tis like that which on quinces comes, Which shine when brush'd by maiden's thumbs;
I kiss you thrice, your lips are clear'd,
And mine have caught a second beard.

You, Quintus Ovidius, who are about to visit the Cale­ donian Britons, and the green Tethys, and father Ocean;
will you then resign Numa's hills, and the comfort of Nomentan retreats P and does the country, and your own fireside, fail to retain you in your old age ?
You defer enjoyment, but Atro­ pos does not at the same time lay aside her spindle, and every passing hour is placed to your account.
You show by per­ forming a kindness to a dear friend (and who would not praise such conduct ?), that a sacred regard to your word is dearer to you than life.
But may you at length be restored to your Sabine estate, long to remain there, and remember yourself among your friends!
Do you an India voyage then design ?
And twice to cross the Tropic and the Line ?
In your old age quit Paul's and Harrow spire ?
A cheerful house, and comfortable fire?
Postpone not life:
life still is posting on:
And makes you debtor for each moment gone.
A noble proof of friendship you afford, Who hold your life less sacred than your word.
Soon to your friends return!
and in your breast Leave for yourself a place amongst the rest.

If my little books contain anything gentle and graceful, if my page teems with pleasing terms of eulogy, you think them insipid;
and when I offer you the choicest bits of a Laurentian boar, you prefer to gnaw the bones.

my spread is not for your stomach.
If in my books aught sweet and gentle sound, Aught celebrating famous acts is found.
Witless thou 't deem'st;

If rancorous spleen be thy belov'd disease, My candid vein shall ne'er thy malice please.

The things that make life happy, dearest Martial, are these:
wealth not gained by labour, but inherited ;
lands that make no in return ;
a hearth always warm ;
freedom from litigation ;
little need of business costume;
a quiet mind;
a vigorous frame;
a healthy constitution;
prudence without cunning;
friends among our equals, and social intercourse;
a table spread without luxury;
nights, not of drunkenness, yet of freedom from care;
a bed, not void of connubial pleasures, yet chaste;
sleep, such as makes the darkness seem short;
contentment with our lot, and no wish for change;
and neither to fear death nor seek it.
What makes the happiest life below, A few plain rules, my friend, will show.
A good estate, not earn'd with toil, But left by will, or giv'n by fate ;
A land of no ungrateful soil, A constant fire within your grate:
No law;
few cares;
a quiet mind;
Strength unimpaired, a healthful frame;
Wisdom with innocence combined;
Friends equal both in years and fame;
Your living easy, and your board With food, but not with luxury stored A bed, though chaste, not solitary ;
Sound sleep, to shorten night's dull reign ;
Wish nothing that is yours to vary;
Think all enjoyments that remain;
And for the inevitable hour, Nor hope it nigh, nor dread its power.
Merivale.
Martial, the things that do attain
The happy life, be these, I find:
The riches left, not got with pain;
The fruitful ground, the quiet mind:
The equal friend, no grudge, no strife;
No charge of rule, nor governance;
Without disease, the healthful life;
The household of continuance:
The mean diet, no delicate fare;
True wisdom join'd with simpleness;
The night discharged of all care, Where wine the wit may not oppress:
The faithful wife, without debate;
Such sleeps as may beguile the night.
Contented with thine own estate;
Ne wish for Death, ne fear his might.
Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey.
The things that make a life to please (Sweetest Martial), they are these:
Estate inherited, not got:
A thankful field, hearth always hot:
City seldom, law-suits never:
Equal friends agreeing ever:
Health of body, peace of mind:
Sleeps that till the morning bind:
Wise simplicity, plain fare :
Not drunken nights, yet loosed from care:
A sober, not a sullen spouse:
Clean strength, not such as his that plows ;
Wish only what thou art, to be;
Death neither wish, nor fear to see.

My bailiff's wife has brought me mallows, to aid digestion, and other treasures of the garden;

nor is mint, the antidote to flatulence, or stimulant elecam­ pane, wanting.
Slices of egg shall crown anchovies dressed with rue;
and there shall be sow's teats swimming in tunny- sauce.
These will serve as whets for the appetite.
My little dinner will all be placed on table at once;
there will be a kid snatched from the jaws of the rapacious wolf;
there will be tid-bits such as have no need of a carver;
there will be haricot beans, and young cabbage sprouts.
To these will be added a chicken;
and a ham which has already ap­ peared at table three times.
For dessert I.will give ripe fruits;
wine from a Nomentan flagon which was filled in the second consulship of Frontinus.
All shall be seasoned with pleasantry free from bitterness;
there shall be no licence of speech that brings repentance on the morrow, and nothing said that we should wish unsaid.
But my guests may speak of the rival factions in the circus, and my cups shall make no man guilty.

That makes us six;
I have one place to spare ;
Bring Ned;
and listen to your bill of fare.
A wholesome salad will adorn the board, Luxurious, as my garden will afford.
The lettuce cooling;
leeks that claim the knife ;
Mint good for wine;
and rocket for the wife:
Parsneps with eggs shall hide a salted fish;
Delicious pickled pork, another dish.
Lamb, which perhaps you'll think is better meat;
A morsel Reynard had a mind to eat.
Cutlets, which want no carving till they're cold;
The youngest sprouts, and beans that are too old.
Fowl, and a ham that thrice appear'd before;
Ripe nonpareils for those who wish for more.

Who would have leaden wine in a golden cup P When rich Opimian wine thyself dost quaff, Turn th' amethystine glasses often off, Thou vile Sabinum ofler'st unto me, And say'st, " Wilt drink in gold? " to show thou'rt free.
Who cares (thy sordid nature to unfold) For leaden wine, though in a cup of gold?
Anon. 1695.
Let Victory in sadness break her Idumæan palms;
0 Fa­ vour, strike thy bare breast with unsparing hand.
Let Hon­ our change her garb for that of mourning;
and make thy crowned locks, 0 disconsolate Glory, an offering to the cruel flames.
Oh!
sad misfortune!
that thou, Scorpus, should be cut off in the flower of thy youth, and be called so prema­ turely to harness the dusky steeds of Pluto.
The chariot-race was always shortened by your rapid driving;
but 0 why should your own race have been so speedily run P Boast, Victory, no more Idume's land:
Beat, Favour, thy bare breast, with barb'rous hand.
Change, weeping Honour, change thy glad attire:
Feed, groaning Glory, feed the fun'ral fire With the nich honours from thy temples torn:
There be no more the wonted garlands worn.
Of youth bereft, amid thy glorious deeds, How soon thou, Scorpus, join'st thy sable steeds!
Ah!
why so rapid was thy car's career ?
And why thy goal of vital course so near P Elphinston.

Of what bright days at Ravenna does Rome deprive you, Faustinus!
0 ye suns!
0 retired ease in the simple tunic!
0 groves!

0 sandy shores moist but firm!
0 rocky Anxur, towering in splendour above the azure surface!
and the couch, which commands the view of more than one water, beholding on one side the ships of the river, on the other those of the sea!
But there are no theatres of Marcellus or of Pompey, no triple baths, no four forums;
nor the lofty temple of Capitoline Jove;
nor other glittering temples that almost reach the heaven to which they are consecrated.
How often do I imagine I hear you, when thoroughly wearied, saying to the Founder of Rome:
“Keep what is yours, and restore me what is mine."
Now that the vernal constellations chase
The winter's rage.
and earth renews her face;
Now the fields smile, and trees fresh verdures take, And Philomel her charming plaints does make;
What days, what joys, does Rome from thee withhol i!
What ease from city toil, not to be told!
O woods!
0 founts!
0 Anxur's pleasant strand!
Where rolling waves wash o'er the glitt'ring sand.
Where ev'n from bed you divers waters see, Here boats on rivers glide, there on the sea.
But Rome will urge, you do not here behold The Capitol, the temples rich with gold Embellish'd, which in gorgeousness draw nigh
The heav'ns they represent, and with them vie ;
Rome s august baths, nor theatres, are here, Her grandeur does not in the least appear.
Before you both advantages I lay;
And now, I fancy, I do hear you say,— As men, when with ill wives they can't agree,­ " Roma, take what's thine, render what's mine tc me."

Now the gay hours to meet the Pleiads run, And winter flies before the vernal sun ;
Now smiles new-clad the woodland and the plain, And plaintive Philomel renews her strain;
What happy days the town now steals from Kent!
There in pure air and ease unformal spent!
Think on your groves, your fountains, Dover's strands, And o'er the waves her high commanding lands;
Which to your bed a double view afford, Of ships at sea, and ships in harbour moor'd.
'What, though there be no crowded theatre;
No senate, and no courts of justice there;
No palace, where our honoured monarch lies;
No Paul's with gilded cross invade the skies;
I seem to bear you thus reproach the town :
“Keep to yourself your things;
give me my own.”

O
Rome, I am Scorpus, the glory of thy noisy circus, the object of thy applause, thy short-lived favourite.

Hermes inveterate ruptures will insure:

Whilst
I frequented, Frontinus, the calm retreats of Anxur on the sea, and the neighbouring Baiæ, with its villas on the shore, the groves free from the troublesome cicadæ in the heats of July, and the freshwater lakes, I then was at leisure, in company with you, to cultivate the learned muses;
but now mighty Rome exhausts me.
Here, when is a day my own ?
Iam tossed about in the vortex of the city;
and my life is wasted in laborious nothingness;
meantime I cul­ tivate some wretched acres of a suburban farm, and keep my homestead near thy temple, 0 sacred Romulus.
But love is not testified solely by day and night attendance on a patron;
nor does such waste of time become a poet.
By the sacred Muses and by all the gods I swear that I love you, though I fail to exercise the officiousness of a mere client.
On the cool shore, near Baia's gentle seats, I lay retired in Anxur's soft retreats;
Whose silver lakes, with verdant shadows crown'd, Disperse a grateful coolness all around.
The grasshopper avoids th' untainted air, Nor, in the heat of summer, ventures there.
Whilst I the brackish Anxur's sweet retreats, And on the shore the nearer Baian seats Haunted;
those springing lakes and woods wherein I' th' summer grasshoppers ne'er made a dinn;
I leisure had the Muses to admire With thee:
Great Rome now both of us doth tire.
What day is now our own ?
wee're lost it th' mayne
O' th' towne, and waste our lives in fruitless payne;
Whilst barren suburb grounds wee to manure About our seats, neare Home, ourselves enure.
Yet those may love that do not night and day (Which not becomes a poet) visits pay.
By th' sacred Muses and the gods above, I you in truth, not like a courtier, love.

If one subject occupies a whole page, you pass over it;
short epigrams, rather than good ones, seem to please you.
A rich repast, consisting of every species of dish, is set be­ fore you, but only dainty bits gratify your taste.
I do not covet a reader with such an over-nice palate;
I want one that is not content to make a meal without bread.
If one sole epigram takes up a page, You turn it o'er, and will not there engage :
Consulting not its worth, but your dear ease;
And not what's good, but what is short, does please.
I serve a feast with all the richest fare
The market yields;
for tarts you only care.
My books not framed such liq'rish guests to treat, But such as relish bread, and solid meat.

Here reposes Erotion in the shade of the tomb that too early closed around her, snatched away by relentless Fate in her sixth winter.
Whoever thou art that, after me, shalt rule over these lands, render annual presents to her gentle shade.
So, with undisturbed possession, so, with thy family ever in health, may this stone be the only one of a mournful description on thy domain.
Underneath this greedy stone Lies little sweet Erotion ;
Whom the Fates, with hearts as cold, Nipp'd away at six years old.
Thou, whoever thou mayst be, That hast this small field after me, Let the yearly rites be paid To her little slender shade ;
So shall no disease or jar Hurt thy house, or chill thy Iar ;
But this tomb be here alone
The only melancholy stone.

Schoolmaster, be indulgent to your simple scholars ;
if you would have many a long-haired youth resort to your lectures, and the class seated round your critical table love you.
So may no teacher of arithmetic, or of swift writing, be surrounded oy a greater ring of pupils.
The days are bright, and glow under the flaming constellation of the Lion, and fervid July is ripening the teeming harvest.
Let the Scythian scourge with its formidable thongs, such as flogged Marsyas of Ce­ lænæ, and the terrible cane, the schoolmaster's sceptre, be laid aside, and sleep until the Ides of October.
In summer, if boys preserve their health, they do enough.
Thou monarch of eight parts of speech, Who sweep'st with birch a youngster's breech, Oh!

So may the trembling crop-hair'd band Around your desk attentive hear, And pay you love instead of fear :
So may yours ever be as full, As writing or as dancing school.
The scorching dog-day is begun ;
The harvest roasting in the sun:

To use the lash, is too much tir'd.
Let ferula and rod together Lie dormant, till the frosty weather.

Who miss a fever in this season.

Small though the tomb, traveller, on which you read these lines, it yields not in interest to the sepulchres of Mausolus or the Pyramids.
I have lived long enough to be twice a spectator of the Secular Games;
and my life lost nothing of happiness before my funeral pyre.
Juno gave me five sons, and as many daughters;
and their hands closed my dying eyes.
Rare conjugal glory, too, was mine;
my chaste love knew but one husband.
By this small stone as great remains are hid, As sleep in an Egyptian pyramid.
Here lies a matron, for her years rever'd;
Who through them all with spotless honour steer'd.
Five sons, as many daughters, nature gave, Who dropp'd their pious tears into her grave.
Nor her least glory, though top rarely known;
One man she held most dear, and one alone.

To thy chaste ears explore her dubious way;

Who, while his trump sublime blows savage wars, Not still the strains of guiltless mirth abhors;

Whilst you vaunt yourself, Carmenion, a citizen of Corinth, and no one questions your assertion, why do you call me brother;
I, who was born amongst the Iberians and Celts, a native of the banks of the Tagus ?
Is it that we seem alike in countenance ?
You walk about with shining wavy tresses;
I with my Spanish crop stubborn and bristling.
You are perfectly smooth from the daily use of depilatories;
I am rough-haired both in limb and face.
You have lisping lips and a feeble tongue;
my infant daughter speaks with more force than you.
Not more unlike is the dove to the eagle, the timid gazelle to the fierce lion, than vou to me.
Cease then, Carmenion, to call me brother, Jest 1 call you sister.
Boasting yourself a cytyzen Of Corinth, (which all grant,) why then Mee born in Spayne, within the wall Of Bilboa, doe you brother call P Are we in count'nance like at all ?
Soft neately curled locks you weare:
I've stubborn bristles like a beare.
You with a pummice-stone are sleekt Dayly:
I'm hayry-thigh'd and cheekt.

Who, I ask, was so unfeeling, who so barbarous as to make you, Theopompus, a cook ?
Has any one the heart to defile a face such as this with the smut of a kitchen ?
Can any one pollute such locks with greasy soot ?
Who could better present cups, or crystal goblets ?
Out of what hand would the Falernian come with more relish ?
If this is the destiny of youth of such brilliant beauty, let Jupiter at once make a cook of Ganymede.
Who could so cruel, who so brutish be, For a cook, Theopomp, to destine thee P Could any soil that face so sweetly fair ?
Condemn to soot and grease that lovely hair P None worthier with the crystal glass to stand, And praise the wine with his more crystal hand.
For such a fate, if beauteous boys must look, Next news we hear, Jove doats upon a cook.

Though, Lælia, your home is not Ephesus, or Rhodes, or Mitylene, but a house in a patrician street at Rome;
and though you had a mother from the swarthy Etruscans, who never painted her face in her life, and a sturdy father from the plains of Aricia;
yet you (oh shame!) a countrywoman of Hersilia and Egena, are perpetually repeating, in volup­ tuous Greek phrase, " My life, my soul."
Such expressions should be reserved for the couch, and not even for every couch, but only that which is prepared by a mistress for a wanton lover.
You pretend forsooth a wish to know how to speak as a chaste matron, but your lascivious movements would be­ tray you.
Though you were to learn all that Corinth can teach, Lælia, and practise it, you would never become a perfect Lais.
When thee nor Ephesus nor Rhodes will own, When Mitylene's name thou scarce hast known ;
Though Grecian main or isle could ne'er complete
The upstart native of Patrician-street:
Thy mother tinged but by Etruscan brown ;
Thy sire a stalker of Aricia's down :
Presumest thou to lisp, without control, Zωὴ καὶ ψυχὴ !
for, my life and soul ?
Oh shame!
a daughter of Hersilia thou ?
Thee shall Egeria of her clan avow ?
Such strains thy couch, nor ev'ry couch, should hear:
Such wit keeps Lewdness for her lover's ear.
Thou studiest style that suits a matron's use :
More luscious cannot burning lust produce.
All Corinth should she con, and bid us see, A Lælia ne'er will quite a Lais be.

Because I produce scarcely one book in a whole year, I in­ cur from you, learned Potitus, the censure of idleness.
But with how much more justice might you wonder that I produce even one, seeing how frequently my whole day is frittered away!
Sometimes I receive friends in the evening, to re­ turn my morning calls;
others I have to congratulate on pre­ ferments, though no one has to congratulate me.
Sometimes I am required to seal some document at the temple of the lustrous Diana on Mount Aventin;
sometimes the first, some­ times the fifth hour, claims me for its occupations.
Some­ times the consul detains me, or the prætor, or the dancers as they return;
frequently, listening to a poet's recitation oc­ cupies the entire day.
Nor can I fairly refuse a few minutes to a pleader, or a rhetorician, or a grammarian, should they make the request.
After the tenth hour, I go fatigued to the bath, and to get my hundred farthings.

What time have I, Potitus, for writing a book ?
That scarce a piece I publish in a year, Idle perhaps to you I may appear.
But rather, that I write at all, admire, When I am often robb'd of days entire.
Now with my friends the evening I must spend:
To those preferred my compliments must send.
Now at the witnessing a will make one:
Hurried from this to that, my morning's gone.
Some office must attend;
or else some ball;
Or else my lawyer's summons to the hall.
Now a rehearsal, now a concert hear;
And now a Latin play at Westminster.
Home after ten return, quite tir'd and dos'd.
When is the piece, you want, to be compos'd ?

Whoever thou art that desires!
for thy parents a long and happy life, regard with sympathy the short inscription upon this marble tomb :
—"
Here Rabirius consigned two dear de­ parted ones to the earth;
no aged couple ever died under happier circumstances.
Sixty years of married life were gently closed in one and the same night;
a single pyre sufficed for both funerals.
It Yet Rabirius mourns them as though they had been snatched from him in the flower of their youth;
nothing can be more unjustifiable than such la­ mentations.
Thou that dost wish thy parents' lives should prove Both long and blest, this tomb's short title love.
Wherein Rabirius' dead deare parents rest.
No age with happier fate was ever blest.

And in one funerall flame both bodies wynes.

I am not about to celebrate a Lord or a God;
there is now no longer any abode for you in this city.
Go far away to the turbaned Parthians, and, with base and servile supplications, kiss the feet of their pageant kings.
Here there is no lord, but an emperor;
as senator, the most just of all the senate;
one through whose efforts Truth, simple and unadorned, has been recovered from the Stygian realm.
Under this prince, Rome, if thou art discreet, beware of speaking in the language used to his predecessors.
In vain, 0 wretched Flattery, With bare-worn lips thou com'st to me, To call me falsely Lord and God.
Away;
for thee here's no abode;
To Parthia's mitred Monarchs goe;
There falling prostrate, basely low, The gaudy King’s proud feet adore.
This is no Lord, but Emperor, Of all the justest Senator.
By whom from Stygian shades, the plain And rustic truth's brought back again.
Thou dar'st not, Rome, this Emperor To flatter as thou didst before.

In vain, mean flatteries, ye try To gnaw the lip, and fall the eye1 No man or god or lord I name:

A letter front my eloquent friend has brought with it a pleasing token of his friendship, an imposing present of a Roman toga;
a toga not such as Fabricius, but as Apicius, would have been glad to wear;
or as the knight Mæcenas, the friend of Augustus, might have chosen.
It would have been of less value in my estimation had any other person been the giver;
it is not by every hand that a propitious sacri­ fice may be offered.
Coming from you it is grateful to me;
but even had I not loved your gift, Marcus, I must naturally love my own name.
1
But more valuable than the gift, and more pleasing than even the name, is the kind attention and favour of so learned a man.
A missive pledge, whence pledges bring renown, Brought the grave present of th' Ausonian gown;
Which, not Fabricius, would Apicius bear;
And which th' Augustan knight were proud to wear.
This from elsewhere might less acceptance gain:
Not ev'ry hand can hallow victims slain.
From thine the boon must yield supreme delight:
The very name might selfish love excite.
But, far more grateful than the boon or name, From learning's hand, and friendship’s heart, it came.

Have pity at length, Rome, upon the weary congratulator, the weary client:
How long shall I be a dangler at levees, among crowds of anxious clients and toga-clad dependents, earning a hundred paltry coins 2 with a whole day's work, while Scorpus 3 triumphantly carries off in a single hour fifteen heavy bags of shining gold ?
I ask not as the reward of my little books (for what indeed are they worth ?) the plains of Apulia, or Hybla, or the spice-bearing Nile, or the tender vines which, from the brow of the Setian hill, look down on the Pomptine marshes.
What then do I desire, you ask ?—

Once upon a time Galla's demand was twenty thousand sesterces ;
and I admit she was not much too dear at the price.
A year passed by:
"I am yours," she said, "for ten thousand sesterces."
This seemed to me more than she had asked before.
Six months afterwards, when she came down to two thousand, I offered one thousand, which she refused.
About two or three months later, so far from refusing this sum, she herself lowered her demand to four gold pieces.
I declined to give it, and then she asked me to give her a hundred sesterces;
but even this sum seemed greatly too much.
A miserable sportula of a hundred farthings would then have brought us together;
that is, she proposed to accept it;
but I told her I had bestowed it on my slave.
Could she descend lower than this ?
She did;
she now offers herself for nothing;
but I decline.
Galla, times past, ask'd me an hundred pound:
And 'twas not much, where such a form was found.
After one year, fifty was her demand:
Methought she now was at a dearer hand.
Some time laps'd:
says she, Twenty you'll bestow Ten I shall gladly:
but she answer'd, No.
Two or three months, I know not which, pass'd more:
Then she ask'd nobles, and of them, but four, And I refus'd.
Well, send a hundred pence:
But this seem'd then too much, and I went thence.
She next my poor dry sportula did crave.
Good truth, said I, that to my boy I gave.
Was 't possible that she should lower go ?
Yes:
Gratis herself she offer’d ;
I said, No. Anon. 1696.
Does this seem just to you, Fortune ?
A man who is not a native of Syria or of Parthia, not a knight from Cappar docian slave-cages, but one of the people of Remus, and a born subject of Numa, a man of agreeable manners, upright, and virtuous, a trustworthy friend, learned in the Greek and Roman languages, a man whose only fault (but that a great one) is, that he is a poet ;

You are going, Macer, to the shores of Salona.
Rare in­ tegrity and the love of justice will accompany you, and mo­ desty follow in the train.
A just governor always returns poorer than he went.
0 happy husbandman of the gold-pro­ ducing country, thou wilt send back thy ruler with his purse empty;
thou wilt deplore his return, 0 Dalmatian, and escort him on his departure with mixed feelings of gratitude and sorrow.
I, Macer, shall go among the Celts and the fierce Iberians, with deep regret for the loss of your companionship.
But every page of mine that shall be circulated there, written with a pen made from the reeds of the fish-abounding Tagus, will record the name of Macer.
So may I be read among old poets, and rank in your esteem as inferior to none but Catullus.
My Macer seeks Salona's shore :
Rare honour will his steps attend;
Nice rectitude the route explore, With modesty her bosom-friend.
Mending the subjects of their toil, The gen'rous may themselves impair:
Blest tenant of the golden soil, Thou home wilt send thy ruler bare.
Thou, Dalmat, wise wilt wish delay, And his prolonged dominion woo:
Hin, when he can no longer stay, Thou shalt with weeping joy pursue.
'Mong Celts and rude Iberians we Shall soon retrace our native seat;
Where, Macer, the regret of thee Must harass our belov’d retreat.
But thence, whatever page of ours Expand from teeming Tagus’ reed, Shall prop with Macer's name her pow’rs ;
So to eternity decreed.
'Mid ancient bards shall I be read, When with his chaste perusal crown'd;
And, of the living or the dead, Catullus only greater found.

Near the fourth milestone from the city, Torquatus has a princely mansion:
near the fourth milestone, Otacilius pur­ chases a little country-house.
Torquatus has built splendid warm baths of variegated marble;
Otacilius erects a basin.
Torquatus has laid out a plantation of laurels on his land;
Otacilius sows a hundred chestnuts.
When Torquatus was consul, Otacilius was chief magistrate of the village, and, proud of such a dignity, did not imagine himself a less per­ sonage than Torquatus.
As, of old, the large ox made the small frog burst, so, I suspect, Torquatus will burst Otacilius.

Eros weeps whenever he casts his eye on beautiful vases of mottled myrrha, or on young slaves, or choice specimens of citron-wood;
and he sighs from the very bottom of his heart, because, unhappy mortal, he cannot buy them all and carry them home with him.
How many persons do the same as Eros, but with dry eyes!
The greater portion of mankind laugh at such tears, and yet at heart are like him.
At Chenevix' poor little master cries, When boxes, seals, and rings, and dolls he spies;
And from his soul sincerest sorrows come, That he can't buy the room, and bear it home.

I pray, to your fatigued client, and excuse him from such bootless toils, which are of no advantage to you, Gallus, and are painful to me.
If your affairs my diligence could mend, Early and late I ready would attend:
Expos'd to storms, when angry winds do blow;
And on my breast receive the driving snow.
But if you not one farthing happier are By my fatigue, and by my generous care ;
Spare one worn out, oh!
spare a labour vain,
Which helps not you, but gives me real pain.

You collect your straggling hairs on each side, Marinus, endeavouring to conceal the vast expanse of your shining bald pate by the locks which still grow on your temples.
But the hairs disperse, and return to their own place with every gust of wind;
flanking your bare pole on either side with crude tufts.
We might imagine we saw Hermeros of Cydas standing between Spendophorus and Telesphorus.
Why not confess yourself an old man P Be content to seem what you really are, and let the barber shave off the rest ot your hair.
There is nothing more contemptible than a bald man who pretends to have hair.
Your thin-sown hairs on any side
With dextrous care you cull;
And rob your temples of their pride, To thatch your shining scull.
Repell’d by ev'ry puff of wind,
They take their former stand, And then your desert poll they bind, With locks on either hand.
So, 'twixt two tuzzy youthful pates, One Halmyrotes sees.
Throw ridicule no more such baits:
The bare old-man will please.
But, that at length you may seem one, The shaver quick be call'd;
And let him o'er the remnant run:
Belock'd!
oh shame!
and bald!

Do you wonder, Cædicianus, why Afer does not retire to rest P You see with whom he has to share his couch.

Anon.Ladon, a boatman on the Tiber, bought himself, when grown old, a bit of land on the banks of his beloved stream.
But as the overflowing Tiber often invaded it with raging floods, breaking into his ploughed fields, converting them in winter into a lake, he filled his worn-out boat, which was drawn up on the beach, with stones, making it a barrier against the floods.
By this means he repelled the inundation.
Who would have believed it?
An unseaworthy boat was the safe-guard of the boatman.
A worn-out sailor, charmed with Deptford strand, Close to the river bought a piece of land.
The winter tides prevail'd against the mound;
And in strong torrents overflow’d his ground.
His cast-off bark, which luckily lay near, He fill'd with stones, converted to a pier, And stopp'd the breach:
and, who would have believ’d P That a sunk ship a tar’s affairs retriev'd.

Let Rome gratefully celebrate the first of October, the natal day of the eloquent Restitutus.
Let us all join in solemn and pious orisons to celebrate tby anniversary.
A truce to litigation;
let wax tapers, cheap tablets, and little table-napkins, propitatory gifts of the poor client, be deferred until the saturnalia of icy December.
Let rich men now vie in the munificence of their offerings.
Let the swelling mer­ chant of the portico of Agrippa bring cloaks from the city of Cadmus.
Let him who has been charged with drunkenness and midnight brawling present a dinner-robe to his defender.
Has a maiden triumphed over the slanderer of her fair fame, let her, with her own hands, bring pure sardonyxes.
Let the antiquary present you with a work from the chisel of Phidias.
Let the hunter bring a hare, the farmer a kid, the fisherman a prey from the waters.
If every one sends you his own pe­ culiar gift, what do you think, Restitutus, that a poet ought to send you P With festal rites, let pious Rome, In guise the antipode of gloom, October's Calends hail:
With solemn vows, and silent awe, Approach to greet the man of law, And softly tread the vale.
Quiescent lie judicial fray;
The orator was born to-day :
Ye votaries, bring no trash.
Let tapers, tablets, toilets fine, Their jokes to jocund days consign, And tempt December lash.
Let all the heirs of thy success, To crown the hero of redress, In grateful tokens vie.
To thee the swelling son of trade Shall bid the robes be all display'd, That boast Cadmean dye.
Of riot and assault arraign'd, The wight, so innocent maintained, A revel-vest may render:
The youthful and the injur'd dame, Who clear evinced her lord to blame, True sardonyx will tender.
The hoary peer, em power'd by thee To carry up his pedigree, Must burn to pay his debt:
The mode alone he studious seeks, And deeply versant in antiques, Presents a Phidian set.
The jolly hunter brings a hare, The honest hind a kid will bear
The fisher robs the sea:
If ev'ry client send his own, Who know'st so much, hast thou yet known
What may be sent by me ?

This Juno, Polycletus, your happy workmanship and masterpiece, which would do honour to the hand of Phidias, displays such beauty, that, had she thus appeared on Mount Ida, the judge would have felt no hesitation in preferring her to the other goddesses.
If Jupiter had not loved his sister Juno, he might, Polycletus, have fallen in love with your Juno.
Thy Juno, Polyclet, (most matchless piece!)
May well contest the proudest hand of Greece.
Had but the goddess shone with such a grace
In Ida, both her rivals had given place.
Though his own Juno Jove did ne’er approve, Before his brightest strumpets thine he'd love.

To you, Marius, the admirer of a tranquil life, you who shared mine with me, you the glory of the ancient town of Atina, I commend these twin pines, the pride of a rustic grove, these holm oaks sacred to the Fauns, and these altars dedicated to the Thunderer and the shaggy Silvanus, erected by the unpractised hand of my bailiff;
altars which the blood of a lamb or a kid has frequently stained.
I intrust to you also the virgin goddess, the patroness of this sacred temple;
him, too, whom you see the guest of his chaste sister, Mars, my patron saint;
and the laurel grove of the tender Flora, into which she fled for refuge from the pursuit of Priapus.
When­ ever you propitiate these kind divinities of my little pro­ perty, whether with blood or with incense, you will remem­ ber to say to them, "Behold the right hand of your absent votary, wherever he may be, unites with mine in offering this sacrifice.
Imagine him present, and grant to both what.
soever either shall pray for."
Of the sequester’d scene, thou social friend, Atina's boast!
I to thy faith commend
These twinling pines, the glory of the grove;
These oakling clumps, where Fauns delight to rove These altars, that a rustic hand has rear'd, Or to the Silvan lov'd, or Thund'rer fear’d• Which lambkin 8 oft, or kidling's, blood has soil’d
While duty chid the horror that recoil'd.
Dear delegate, with pious awe sustain
The virgin-goddess of the hallow'd fane;
And him the modest sister joys to see, The champion of my Calends and of me.
Still dress the laurel-grove, that Flora knew, When from the brutal ravisher she flew.
Hail, guardian-group of my beloved spot!
One'er forgetting, ne'er to be forgot!
Or you, in arduous task, or thankful ease, Let bloodshed honour, or let incense please ;
Where'er your Martial be, his friend will say, He ministers with me your rites to-day.
Absent, alas!
impute him still at hand,
And grant to both what either may demand.

If, demons, you see the Euganean coast of Helicaou, and the fields varied with vine-clad hills, before me, present to your wife Sabina, to whom Atesta gave birth, these verses not yet published, but just stitched up in a purple cover.
As a rose which is newly plucked delights us, so a new book, not yet soiled with the beards of readers, gives us pleasure.
Should'st thou see sooner Helicaon's reign, Where viny ridges paint the pregnant plain;
To Sabine Atestina bear with awe Some strains empurpled that the world ne'er saw.
As a fair rose delights, when pluck'd in prime, So virgin-stanzas and unsullied rhyme.

No Libyan dragon guards my orchards, no royal plantations of Alcinous serve me;
but my garden flourishes in security with Nomentan trees, and my common fruits do not tempt the robber.
I send you here, therefore, some of my rosy au­ tumnal apples, gathered in the midst of the Suburra.
No snake of Massylia my orchards defends:
No soil of Alcinous my wishes attends.

You are astonished, A vitus, that I, who have grown old in the capital of Latium, should so often speak of countries afar off;
that I should thirst for the gold-bearing Tagus, and my native Salo;
and that I should long to return to the rude fields around my well-furnished cottage.
But that land wins my affection, in which a small income is sufficient for happi­ ness, and a slender estate affords even luxuries.
Here we must nourish our fields :
there the fields nourish us.
Here the hearth is warmed by a half-starved fire;
there it burns with unstinted brilliancy.
Here to be hungry is an expensive gratification, and the market ruins us;
there the table is cov­ ered with the riches of its own neighbourhood.
Here four togas or more are worn out in a summer;
there one suffices for four autumns.
Go then and pay your court to patrons, while a spot exists which offers you everything that a pro­ tector refuses you.
Me, who have lived so long among the great, You wonder to hear talk of a retreat, And a retreat so distant as may show No thoughts of a return when once I go.
Give me a country, how remote soe'er, Where happiness a moderate rate doth bear;
Where poverty itself in plenty flows, And all the solid use of riches knows.
The ground about the house maintains it there ;
The house maintains the ground about it here.
Here even hunger's dear, and a full board Devours the vital substance of the lord.
The land itself does there the feast bestow, The land itself must here to market go.
Tnree or four suits one winter here does waste ;
One suit does there three or four winters last.
Here every frugal man must oft be cold, And little luke-warm fires to you sold :
There fire's an element as cheap and free Almost as any other of the three.
Stay you then here, and live among the great, Attend their sports, and at their table eat;
When all the bounties here of men you score, The place's bounty there will give you more.

While the lightly-piled funeral pyre was being supplied with paper to kindle it;
while the desolate wife was buying myrrh and lavender;
when the grave, the bier, the corpse­ anointer, were all ready, Numa made me his heir, and forth­ with recovered.
While they the funeral charge prepare
Which in the paper piles placed are, And Numa's weeping wife now buys Sweet perfumes for his obsequies, His grave and bier being ready made, And one to wash his body dead, And me left heir by his own pen, Pox on him!

When my Cæcuban wine is poured out for me by an attendant of yours, more delicate than the Idæan Ganymede, than whom neither your daughter, nor your wife, nor your mother, nor your sister, recline more elegantly attired at table, would you have me rather look at your dress, and your old citron-wood furniture, and your Indian ivories ?
However that I may not, while your guest, incur your suspicions, let me be served by the son of some rank swineherd, or coarse fellow from a mean village, with bristling hair, rough, rude, and ill-grown.
Your pretended modesty will betray you;
you cannot have at the same time, Publius, such morals as you wish us to suppose, and such beautiful minions.
When a looser lad, forsooth, Than was e'er th' Idean youth, Ministers Cecubian juice;
Than thy daughter's self more spruce, Than thy mate, or mother fine.
Or thy sister can recline:
Must I more thy trappings twang, Citron old, or Indian fang ?
Yet, offenceless that I lean, That I thee, like me, serene;
From the herd, or sordid cot, Let the homely train be got;
Crept and bristling, rude, and small;
Rankest swineherd's children all.
Thus, my friend, beware undoing :
Blushes may bewray thy ruin.
But thou canst not those I see, Publius, keep, and blushing be.

Fellow townsmen, born upon the steep slope of Augustan Bilbilis, which Salo encompasses with its rapid waters, does the poetical glory of your bard afford you any pleasure ?
For my honour, and renown, and fame, are yours;
nor does Verona, who would willingly number me among her sons, owe more to her tender Catullus.
It is now thirty-four years that you have presented your rural offerings to Ceres without me;
meanwhile I have been dwelling within the beautiful walls of imperial Rome, and the Italian clime has changed the colour of my hair.
If you will receive me cordially, I come to join you;
if your hearts are frigid, I shall quickly leave you.
My friends, who round Mount Cabum do abide, Drink Lewes' stream, or o'er her carpet ride;
Are you not anxious for your poet's fame P His honours yours, and yours his deathless name.

Go, my little book, go;
accompany my Flaccus across the wide, but propitious, waters of the deep, and with unob­ structed course, and favouring winds, reach the towers of Hispanian Tarragona.
Thence a chariot will take you, and, carried swiftly along, you will see the lofty Bilbilis, and your dear Salo, after the fifth change of carriages.
Do you ask what are my commissions for you ?
That, the moment you arrive, you offer my respects to a few but old friends, whom I have not seen for four and thirty years, and that you then request my friend Flaccus to procure me a retreat, pleasant and commodious, at a moderate price;
a retreat in which your author may enjoy his ease.

O'er gentle waves may winds propitious blow.
Having made all thine own, the heavenly powers;
Explore the friendly Tarraconian tow'rs.
Thence mount thy car, and joyous skim the land, Where fond Hispania waves her hailing hand.
The fifth blest stage may haply give to ring
My lofty Bilbilis, and bid thy Salo sing.
Thou askest my commands ?
Make no delay, Nor seek a respite from the weary way, Till thou salute my ancient friends -how few!
Whom, twice seventeen long winters since, I knew.
Instant our best beloved Flaccus tell
To trace me out a sweet sequestered cell, Benign of aspect, of salubrious breeze, Where thy worn parent may retire to ease.

WHITHER, my book, whither are yoc going so much at your ease, clad in a holiday dress of fine linen ?
Is it to see Parthenius ?1 certainly.
Go, then, and return unopened;

nor has he time for the muses, or he would have time for his own.
Or do you esteem yourself sufficiently happy, if you fall into hands of less note ?
In that case, repair to the neighbouring portico of Romulus;
that of Pompeius does not contain a more idle crowd, nor does that of Agenor's daughter,2 or that of the inconstant captain * of the first ship.

More to his own, perhaps, than mine.

It is not the idle people of the city only that delight in my Muse, nor is it alone to listless ears that these verses are addressed, but my book is thumbed amid Getic frosts, near martial standards, by the stern centurion;

Yet of what advantage is it to me?
My purse benefits nought by my reputation.
What immortal pages have could I not have written and what wars could I not havesung to the Pierian trumpet, if, when the kind deities gave a second Augustus to the earth, they had likewise given to thee, 0 Rome, a second Mæcenas.

What deathless numbers from my pen would flow ?
What wars would my Pierian Trumpet blow ?

Ye sacred altars, and Phrygian Lares, whom the Tro­ jan hero preferred to snatch from the flames,rather than pos­ sess the wealth of Laomedon ;
thou, 0 Jupiter, now first re­ presented in imperishable gold;
thou, his sister, and thou, bis daughter, the offspring solely of the supreme Father;
thou, too, Janus, who now repeatest the name of Nerva for the third time in the purple Fasti, I offer to you this prayer with pious lips:
" Preserve, all of you, this our emperor;
preserve the senate;
and may the senators exhibit in their lives the morals of their prince, the prince his own."
The Phrygian gods and sacred rites to save, Up to the flames the Trojan hero gave Troy's wealth ;
Jove, Juno, whom we now behold, With Pallas, first engraved in purest gold, And Janus, who records the happy day Of Numa's reign.
To all I pious pray, The senate may be safe, the prince s throne, By his example all may live, he by his own.

You have as much reverence for justice and equity, Cæsar, as Numa had;
but Numa was poor.
It is an arduous task to preserve morality from the corruption of riches, and to be a Numa after surpassing so many Crœsuses.
If the great names of old, our ancient progenitors, were to return to life, and liberty were granted them to leave the Elysian groves, unconquered Camillus would worship you as Liberty her­ self;
Fabricius would consent to receive money if you were to offer it;
Brutus would rejoice in having you for his emperor;
to you the blood-thirsty Sylla would offer his power when about to resign it;
Pompey, in concord with Cæsar, as a private citizen, would love you;
Crassus would bestow upon you all his wealth ;
and even Cato himself, were he recalled from the infernal shades of Pluto, and restored to the earth, would join the party of Cæsar.
Thy love of right and justice, Cæsar, 's more Than Numa's was, and Numa yet was poor.
'Tis rare, when riches cannot taint the mind, In Crcesus' wealth, a Numa's soul to find.
If our old Romans of renowned name (Dispensed with in Elisium) hither came, Camillus, thee t' obey, would think it free;
Fabricius would take gold, if giv'n by thee;
In such a king Brutus would take delight;
Sylla, to thee resign th’ imperial right;
Cæsar and Pompey private men would live I And Crassus his loved treasure to thee give 3 Cato himself, if Fates would set him free, Returned to earth, would a Caesarean be.

Ye pallid cares, far hence begone, I 'll speak whate'er I think upon, Sans any studied delay ;
So fill me out three cups, my boy, Such as Pithagoras did give To Nero when he here did live ;
But, Dindymus, fill faster too, For sober I can nothing do.
When I am drunk up to the height Full fifteen poets seize me straight.
Now give me kisses, such as were Catullus his, and if they are So numerous as his are said to be, I will Catullus' sparrow give to thee.

Your husband will attach himself as escort to his lady.

The fragrance of balsam extracted from aromatic trees;
the ripe odour yielded by the teeming saffron;

or of the flowery meadows in the vernal season;
or of silken robes of the Empress from her Palatine wardrobes;
of amber warmed by the hand of a maiden;
of a jar of dark Falernian wine, broken and scented from a distance;

of the alabaster jars of Cosmus, and the altars of the gods;
of the chaplet just fallen from the brow of the luxurious;

I will only tell you of the kisses.
You swear to be secret.
You want to know too much, Sabinus.
Like balsams chard by some exotick fayre:
Or from a saffron field fresh gliding ayre:
In winter chests like apples ripening, Or grounds o'erspread with budding trees in spring:
Like silken robes in royal presses:
and Gumms suppled by a virgin's soft white hand:
As broken jars of Falerne wines do smell Far off:
or flow'ry gardens where bees dwell:
Perfumers potts, burnt incense tost in the ayre:
Chaplets new fall'n from rich perfumed hayre:
What more ?
All's not enough :

I'll nought but kisses tell:

O ye heirs, bury not the dwarf husbandman, for the least quantity of earth will lie heavy on him.
There are some of my writings which may be read by the wife of a Cato, and the most austere of Sabine women.
But I wish the present little book to laugh from one end to the other, and to be more free in its language than any of my books;
to be redolent of wine, and not ashamed of being greased with the rich unguents of Cosmus;
a book to make sport for boys, and to make love to girls;
and to speak, with­ out disguise, of that by respecting which men are ge­ nerated, the parent indeed of all;
which the pious Numa used to call by its simple name.
Remember, however, Apol­ linaris, that these verses are for the Saturnalia, and not to be taken as a picture of my morals.
I have such papers that grim Cato's wife May read, and strictest Sabines in their life.
I will this book should laugh throughout and jest, And be more wicked than are all the rest, And sweat with wine, and with rich unguents flow, And sport with boys, and with the wenches too;
Nor by periphrasis describe that thing, That common parent whence we all do spring;
Which sacred Numa once by 't's name did call.

O my Apollinaris, this my book Has no dissembled manners, no feign'd look.
Fletcher,Reader, if you are exceedingly staid, you may shut up my book whenever you please;
I write now for the idlers of the city;
my verses are devoted to the god of Lampsacus, and my hand shakes the castanet, as briskly as a dancing-girl of Cadiz.
Oh !
how often will you feel your desires aroused, even though you were more frigid than Curius and Fabricius.
Thou too, young damsel, wilt read the gay and sportive sallies of my book not without emotion, even though thou shouldst be a native of Patavium.
Lucretia blushes, and lays my book aside;
but Brutus is present.
Let Brutus retire, and she will read.
It is not every page in my book that is intended to be read at night;
you will find something also, Sabinus, to read in the morning.
Not all ray verse for Night's loose hours are writ, Many you'll find the sober morning fit.
Anon. 1696.
You have given me, Lupus, an estate in the suburbs, but I have a larger estate on my window-sill.
Can you say that this is an estate,-can you call this, I say, an estate, where a sprig of rue makes a grove for Diana;
which the wing of the chirping grasshopper is sufficient to cover;
which an ant could lay waste in a single day ;
for which the leaf of a rose­ bud would serve as a canopy;
in which herbage is not more easily found than Cosmus's perfumes,.
or green pepper:
in which a cucumber cannot lie straight, or a snake uncoil itself.
As a garden, it would scarcely feed a single cater­ pillar ;
a gnat would eat up its willow bed and starve ;
a mole would serve for digger and ploughman.
The mushroom can­ not expand in it, the fig cannot bloom, the violet cannot open.
A mouse would destroy the whole territory, and is as much an object of terror as the Calydonian boar.
My crop is car­ ried off by the claws of a flying Progne, and deposited in a swallow's nest;
and there is not room even for the half of a Priapus, though he be without his scythe and sceptre.
The harvest, when gathered in, scarcely fills a snail-shell;
and the wine may be stored up in a nut-shell stopped with resin.
You have made a mistake, Lupus, though only in one letter;
instead of giving me apraedium, I would rather you had given me a prandium?
Lupus, a farm near town you gave to me ;
A larger plot I in my window see ;
Such scrap of earth a farm 'twere hard to prove, When one small rue-plant makes Diana's grove.
This, which a locust's wing might overlay!
Whose crops would feed an ant one single day!
This, which a folded rose-leaf might have crown's
Where not a herb can any more be found
Than eastern scents or fragrant spices rare, To please the palate or perfume the hair;
Where e'en a cucumber must crooked lie ;
A snake to coil its tail would vainly try.
Such garden scarce one caterpillar feeds ;
The willow-bed no second insect breeds ;
The mole alone my farm does plough and dig;
No mushroom here can gape ;
no early fig, Nor smiling violet, here has room to grow;
The devastated land a mouse lays low, More dreaded by the owner than of yore Was that huge beast the Calydonian boar.
Aloft my crops are carried in the straw, Caught by the flying swallow's slender claw.
Priapus here can scarce find room to stand, Though half his size, and reft of wooden brand.
One snail-shell holds our yearly grain, and more;
In one pitch'd nut-shell all the wine we store.
Lupus, your kindness by one letter err'd;
To call such gift a favour was absurd:
Take back your farm ;
more grateful far to me
The savour that your kitchen yields, would be.

Do you ask, Galla, why I am unwilling to marry you?
You are a prude;
and my passions frequently commit sole­ cisms.
Galla, dost ask why I'll not marry thee ?
Galla, thou are too learned far for me.
A consort so correct I cannot take:
For I, as husband, oft shall solecisms make.

Anon.
O captious reader, who perusest with stern countenance certain Latin verses of mine, read six amorous lines of Au­ gustus Cæsar:
—"Because Antonius kisses GlaphYra, Fulvia wishes me in revenge to kiss her.
I kiss Fulvia!
What if Manius were to make a similar request!!
Should I grant it?
I should think not, if I were in my senses.
Either kiss me, says she, or fight me.
Nay, my purity is dearer to me than life, therefore let the trumpet sound for battle!
" —
Truly, Augustus, you acquit my sportive sallies of licentiousness, when you give such examples of Roman simplicity.
'Cause Anthony is fir'd with Glaphire's charms, Fain would his Fulvia tempt me to her arms:
If Anthony be false, what then ?
must I Be slave to Fulvia's lustful tyranny ?
Then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives Swarm to my bed like bees into their hives.
Declare for Love or War, she said, and frown'd.
No love I'll grant:
to arms bid trumpets sound.
Montaigne (by Cotton), B. ii. ch. IS.
Sila is ready to become my wife at any price;
but I am unwilling at any price to make Sila my wife.
As she insisted, however, I said, " You shall bring me a million of sesterces in gold as a dowry "-What less could I take? " Nor, although I become your husband, will I associate with you even on the first night, or at any time share a couch with you.
I will also embrace my mistress without restraint;
and you shall send me, if I require her, your own maid.
Any favourite, whether my own or yours, shall be at liberty to give me amorous salutes even while you are looking on.
You shall come to my table, but our seats shall be so far apart, that my garments be not touched by yours.
You shall salute me but rarely, never without invitation ;
and then not in the manner of a wife, but in that of a grandmother.
Il you can submit to this, and if there is nothing that you re­ fuse to endure, you will find in me a gentleman, Sila, ready to take you to wife.
Sila on any termes would me faine wed;
But I on all conditions fly her bed.
When still she press'd, " fen thousand pounds I crave," Sayd I, " for portion ;
how can I less have ?
Nor will
It no not the first night, board thee ;
Nor shall one bed e'er common to us bee.
My wench I'll have too, ne'er by you gainsayed Nay, when I bid, you shall send your own mayd.
In wanton kisses with the boy I'll twine;
You looking on, too, bee hee yours or mine.
You shall eate with mee, but at distance, such
As our loose roabes may not each other touch:
Seldome shall kiss me, nor unbid ;
so cold, Too, that, not like a wife, but matron old.
If all this you can beare ;
if nought refuse, Here you can find one you for wife may choose.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
While I am attending you about, and escorting you home, while lending my ear to your chattering, and praising what­ ever you say and do, how many verses of mine, Labullus, might have seen the light!
Does it seem nothing to you, that what Rome reads, what the foreigner seeks, what the knight willingly accepts, what the senator stores up, what the bar­ rister praises, and rival poets abuse, are lost through your fault ?
Is this right, Labullus ?
Can any one endure, that while you thus augment the number of your wretched clients, you proportionately diminish the number of my books ?
In the last thirty days, or thereabouts, I have scarcely finished one page.
See what befalls a poet who does not dine at home.
While I attend thy steps early and late, Afford an ear unto thy idle prate, Applaud whate'er by thee is done or said, How many excellent verses might be made!
This thou account'st no loss, although that Rome Reads them with joy, far nations bear them home ;
Knights and patricians make them their delight, Lawyers admire, and poets also spight.
And can I this digest ?
That for thy sake, Only thy train more numerous to make, My books should fewer be ?
So to engage, That scarce in thirty days I write one page ?
But thus it is, for cheer when poets rome, And will not be content to sup at home.
Anon. 1695.
Charm of my life, Telesphorus, sweet object of my cares, whose like never before lay in my arms, give me, fair one, kisses redolent of the fragrance of old Falernian, give me goblets of which thy lips have first partaken.
If, in addition to this, you grant me the pleasure of true affection, I shall say that Jove is not more happy at the side of Ganymede.
You must have an iron resolution, Flaccus, if you can bestow your affection on a woman, who values herself at no more than half a dozen jars of pickle, or a couple of slices of tunny fish, or a paltry sea-lizard;
who does not think herself worth a bunch of raisins;
who makes only one mouth­ ful of a red herring, which a servant maid fetches in an earthenware dish;
or who, with a brazen face and lost to shame, lowers her demand to five skins for a cloak.
Why!
my mistress asks of me a pound of the most precious perfume, or a pair of green emeralds, or sardonyxes;
and will have no dress except of the very best silks from the Tuscan street;
nay, she would ask me for a hundred gold pieces with as little concern as if they were brass.
Do you think that I wish to make such presents to a mistress ?
No, I do not:
but I wish my mistress to be worthy of such presents.
Thou'rt iron, Flaccus, if to such a dame, Who begs vile gifts, thou can'st keep up a flame;
Cuw-heels does ask, tripes, sprats, and scraps of fish, And a whole pompion holds too much to wish :
To whom her maid, joyful t' have got, does pour Cheap pulse, which greedily she does devour:
And when she's bold, and will all shame depose, Begs yarn enough to knit a pair of hose.
My wench perfumes exacts, both rich and rare, Rubies and pearls, and those must also pair;
Choice Naples silk, with her, will only pass, An hundred crowns in gold she begs like brass.
Give I such gifts, dost say, a miss to please ?
No:
but I'd have her merit such as these.
Anon. 1695.
Os malè causidicis et diets olere poet is :

Cæcilius, a very Atreus of gourds, tears and cuts them into a thousand pieces, just as if they were the children of Thyestes.
Some of these pieces will be placed before you to begin with as a relish;
they will appear again as a second course;
then again as a third course.
From some be will contrive a dessert;
from others the baker will make mawk­ ish patties, cakes of every form, and dates such as are sold at the theatres.
By the art of the cook they are metamor­ phosed into all sorts of mincemeat, so that you would fancy you saw lentils and beans on the table ;
they are also made to imitate mushrooms and sausages, tails of tunnies and anchovies.
This dextrous cook exhausts the powers of art to disguise them in every way, sometimes by means of Capellian rue.'
Thus he fills his dishes, and side dishes, and polished plates, and tureens, and congratulates himself upon his skill in furnishing so many dishes at the cost of a penny.
Thou Atreus of a cucumber, Which, like Thyestes' sons, you tear, And in ten thousand pieces slice ;
And in ten thousand ways disguise.
This in your soup at first you use :
And this in every course produce.
Hence your confectioner still takes
His jellies, sweetmeats, and his cakes ;
Decking his dishes in a row Of high-raised pyramids for show.
Your cook from this hath found the means
To furnish us with pease and beans;
And by his magic art create A mushroom, sausage, cod, or scate.
Your house-keeper, as far as can go Her seasoning art, turns this to mango.
Thus you, who fill by this device
Your dishes of all sorts and size, Would modest and polite be thought By serving up one single groat.

You have neither a toga, nor a hearth, nor a bed infested with vermin, nor a patched rug of marsh reeds, nor a slave young or old, nor a maid, nor a child, nor a lock, nor a key, nor a house-do , nor a wine-cup.
Yet, Nestor, you desire to be thought and called a poor man, and wish to be counted as such among the people.
You are a deceiver, and do your­ self too much idle honour.
To have nothing is not poverty.
2

Thou liest:
thou soothest thyself with vanity;

O mark this day for me with a white stone, Caius Julius having been restored (how delightful!) to my prayers.
I re­ joice to have despaired as though the threads of the sisters had already been snapped asunder;
that joy is but little where there has been no fear.
Hypnus, why do you loiter ?
Pour out the immortal Falernian;
such fulfilment of my prayers demands an old cask.
Let us drink five, six, and eight cups, answering to the letters in the names Caius, Julius, and Proculus.
1 Hail, happy day!
my Julius, hail, restored!
Hail, gracious heav'n, who heard'st when I implored!
Despair proves hope, the fatal scissors near :
The less they know of joy who knew no fear.
Hypnus, why loiter'st ?
pour Falernian wine:
Such blessings pour'd demand a cask divine.
Five, six, and eight fair brimmers shall be crowned, And Caius Julius Proculus go round.

Zoilus, why do you delight in using a whole pound weight of gold for the setting of a stone, and thus burying your poor sardonyx ?
Such rings are more suited to your legs;

When late a slave, this ring thy leg might wear, But such a weight thy finger cannot bear.

3You, Charidemus, rocked my cradle;
you were the guardian and constant companion of my childhood.
Now my beard, when shaved, blackens the barber's napkins, and my mistress complains of being pricked by my bristly lips.
But in your eyes I am no older;
you are my bailifFs dread;
my steward and all the household fear you.
You neither allow me to play nor to make love;
nothing is permitted to me, yet everything to yourself.
You rebuke me, you watch me, you complain of me, and sigh at my conduct, and your ire is with difficulty restrained from using the cane.
If I put on a Tyrian robe, or anoint my hair, you exclaim, " Your father never did such things."
You count my cups of wine with contracted brow, as if they came from a cask in your own cellar.
Cease this conduct:
I cannot abide a Cato in a freedman.
My mistress will tell you that I am now a man.
You were for ever by my infant side;
My guardian, my companion, and my guide.
The razor now grows blunt against my beard.
And every girl complains that it is hard.
With you I am but little master still:
And all my servants tremble at your will.
To game or to intrigue I must not dare:
All things to you, to me none, lawful are.
You check, remark, complain, and cry " Good God !"
And in your passion scarce forbear the rod.
If my toupee or velvet I put on;
You say, Oh!
how unlike your father gone!
You count each bumper with a serious look;
As if from your own vault the wine I took.
Such censure I no longer suffer can:
Pray, ask my maid if I am not a man.

Lupercus loves the fair Glycera;
he possesses her all to himself, and is her sole commander.
Once, when he was com plaining to Ælianus, in a sad tone, that he had not caressed her for a whole month, and wished to give the reason to his auditor, who asked for it, he told him that Glycera had the tooth-ache.
While the swineherd Amyntas was over-anxiously feeding his flock, proud of its renown for high condition, his weight proved too much for the yielding branch of an oak which he had ascended, and he was precipitated to the ground in the midst of a shower of acorns, which he had shaken down.
His father would not allow the fatal tree to survive the cruel death of his son, and condemned it to the flames.

Motto to the 10st No. of the RamblevFletcher has given a complete translation of these lines, and so have several of the French editors, but we think them better omitted here.
You are childless and rich, and were born in the consulship of Brutus;
do you imagine that you have any real friends?
You have true friends, but they are those which you made when young and poor.
Your new friends desire only your death.
Now thou are childless, rich, 'bove measure old, The love profess'd to thee, sincere dost hold ?
True love I have found.
Yes, when young and poor;
Who loved thee now, do love thy death much more.
Anon. 1695.
What! old, and rich, and childless too, And yet believe your friends are true P Truth might perhaps of old belong
To those who loved you poor and young;
But, trust me, for the friends you have, They'll love you dearly-in your grave.
F. Lewis, Motto to the 162nd Rambler Childless, and rich, and born in Charles's reign, Can you expect that cordial friends remain ?
If such;
they are, whom young and poor you found:
The new will love you only under ground.

Why does Lattara avoid all the baths which are frequented by women ?
That he may not be exposed to temptation.
Why does he neither promenade in the shade of Pompey'a portico, nor seek the temple of the daughter of Inachus ?
That he may not be exposed to temptation.
Why does he bathe in the cold Virgin water, and anoint himself with Spartan wrestler's oil ?
That he may not be exposed to temptation.
Seeing that Lattara thus avoids all temptation of the female sex, what can be his meaning ?
Silius, who possesses the lands that once belonged to the eloquent Cicero, celebrates funeral obsequies at the tomb of the great Virgil.
There is no one that either Virgil or Cicero would have preferred for his heir, or as guardian of his tomb and lands.
There remained but one man, and he a poor one,1 to honour the nearly deserted ashes, and revered name, of Virgil.
Silius determined to succour the cherished shade;
Silius, a poet, not inferior2 to Virgil himself, consecrated the glory of the bard.
To honour Maro's dust, and sacred shade, One swain remained, deserted, poor, alone.
Till Silius came his pious toils to aid, In homage to a name scarce greater than his own.

Not an hour of the day, Phyllis, passes that you do not plunder me, such is the infatuation of my love for you, so great your cunning in the art of robbery.
Sometimes your artful maid bewails the loss of your mirror, or a ring drops off your finger, or a precious stone from your ear.
Sometimes contraband silk dresses are to be had cheap sometimes a scent casket is brought to me empty.
At one time I am asked for an amphora of old Falernian, to reward the chattering wise-woman who explains your dreams;
at another, your rich friend has invited herself to sup with you, and I must buy you a great pike or a mullet of two pounds' weight.
Have some sense of decency, I entreat you, and some respect for right and justice.
I deny you nothing, Phyllis:
deny me, Phyllis, nothing.
There's not an hour, my Phyllis, in the day, But you contrive to make my fondness pay.
Your maid, an artful slut, now cries, " Alas!
What shall I do ?
I've broke my lady's glass!”
Then Phyllis comes herself, in tears, poor thing!
And tells me she has lost her favourite ring, Or dropp'd perchance, a diamond from her locket :
—
Then, a new piece of silk must pick my pocket.
Behold her next her essence box produce, Which wants some rich perfume, or eau-de-luce, Now an old hag, pretending to divine, And solve her dreams, must have some old tent-wine, I then for fish the market must explore, Some demirep will dine with us at four.
But, prythee, Phyllis, pay some small regard To justice, and my generous flame reward:
Since I refuse you nothing, how can you Thus pick my pocket, and refuse me too ?

You may have a good dinner, Julius Cerealis, with me;
if you have no better engagement, come.
You may keep your own hour, the eighth ;
2 we will go to the bat.
i together;
you know how near the baths of Stephanus are to my house.
Lettuce will first be set before you, a plant useful as a laxative, and leeks cut into shreds;
next tunny-fish, full grown, and larger than the slender eel, which will be garn­ ished with egg and leaves of rue.
Nor will there be wanting eggs lightly poached, and cheese hardened on a Velabrian hearth;
2 nor olives which have experienced the cold of a Picenian winter.
These ought to be sufficient to whet the appetite.
Do you want to know what is to follow ?
I will play the braggart, to tempt you to come:
There will be Fish, oysters, sow's teats, well-fattened tame and wild-fowl;
dain­ ties which not even Stellar except on rare occasions, is used to place before his guests.
I promise you still more :
I will recite no verses to you;
while you shall be at liberty to read to me again your "War of the Giants," or your Georges, second only to those of the immortal Yirgil.
Trimly to sup, Julius, I thee invite:
If better be not offer'd, come to-night.
We'll bathe together;
at six o'clock be here, Nero's baths, to my house, you know, are near.
Melons and figs, for ante-past, I'll serve, Other ragalios which are deem'd to have
The grateful properties health to preserve, And quicken appetite.
If you ask, what more ?
Fit lie, to make you come.
Oysters, wild boar, Choice fatted fowl ta'en from the coop or pens;
Those nobler yet, that range the woods and fens:
Such as ev'n Stella rarely does afford, Though altogether princely is his board.
I'll promise more, no verses I'll recite:
To hear yours read I'll dedicate the night, Your giant's war, your art of tilling fields, Which not in worth t' immortal Virgil's yields.

Although born among the blue-eyed Britons, how fully has Claudia Rufina the intelligence of the Roman people!
What beauty is hers !
The matrons of Italy might take her for a Roman ;
those of Attica for an Athenian.
The gods have kindly ordered that she proves fruitful to her revered husband, and that, while yet young, she may hope for sons­ in-law and daughters-in-law !
May heaven grant her ever to rejoice in one single husband, and to exult in being the mother of three children.
Though British skies first beamed on Claudia's face, Her beauty far outvies the Latin race:
E'en Grecian nymphs her form cannot excel, Or Roman matrons play the queen so well.
Ye powers, how bless'd must her possessor be!
What progeny will climb the mother's knee !
Kind heaven, grant her constant love to share, And may three boys reward her tender care.

Empty your pockets, rascally Zoilus, of those perfumes, and that lavender, and myrrh redolent of funerals, and half­ burned frankincense, snatched from the midst of pyres, and cinnamon stolen from Stygian biers.
It is from your feet, I suppose, that your hands have learned to be knavish.
I do not wonder at a fellow being a thief, who was a runaway slavedWhen Lupus exhorts you, Urbicus, to become a father, do not believe that he means what he says ;
there is nothing that he desires less.
It is part of the art of flattery to seem to wish what you do not wish.
He earnestly desires that you may not do what he begs you to do.
Were your Cosconia but to say that she is pregnant, Lupus would grow paler than a woman when her hour is come.

When you extol death in such extravagant terms, Stoic Chæremon, you wish me to admire and respect your spirit.
Such magnanimity arises from your possession of only a pitcher with a broken handle, a cheerless hearth, warmed with no fire, a mat, plenty of fleas, a bare bedstead, and a short toga that serves you both night and day.
How great a man you are, that can think of abandoning dregs of red vinegar, and straw, and black bread.
But let your cushions swell with Leuconian wool, and soft purple covers adorn your couches;
and let a favourite share your couch, who, when mixing the Cæcuban wine for your guests, tortures them with the ruddiest of lips, how earnestly then will you desire to live thrice as long as Nestor;
and study to lose no part of a single day!
In adversity it is easy to despise life;
the truly brave man is he who can endure to be miserable.
That thou, Cheremon, death dost oft desire
Thou would'st have us thy stoic mind admire.
This high resolve comes from an earelesse pot, A chimney without fire to keep it hot, A bedsted eat with wormes, rugs coarse and light, One short bare gown to weare both day and night.
How brave a man art thou canst leave such geere
As straw, coarse bread, and lees of vinegar!
But if a woven purple coverled, And fine french lawne adorn'd thy downy bed, Hadst thou a girl, whose rosie lips would fire, As wine she fills the lustfull guests desire:
Then thou to live thrice N estor's years would'st pray, And would'st not lose an houre of any day.
In poore estate 'tis easie scorning death;
Valiant is he dares draw a wretched breath.

Six hundred people are invited to dine with you, Justinus, to celebrate the day on which you first saw the light;
and amongst these, I remember, I used once not to be the last;
nor was my position attended with envy.
But your intention now is to offer me the honours of your festive board to-morrow;
to-day you have a birth-day for the hundreds, to-morrow you will have one for me.
Justin, upon thy solemn birth-day feast, No fewer than six hundred were thy guest:
Among the which, times past, I had the grace To hold, unenvy'd, no inferior place:
But now, to th' relics of the second day, If so I like, to be thy guest I may.
Unto six hundred born, to-day, then be, To-morrow first thou shalt be born to me.

You are an informer, a calumniator, a forger, a secret agent, a slave to the unclean, and a trainer of gladiators.
I wonder, Vacerra, why you have no money.
Thou art a slanderer and delator, False dealer, pimp, and fornicator:
Where such rare parts and trades are found, I wonder much, thy purse does not abound.

If thou art not indeed tum'd arrant an, Thou know'st what I desire to come to pass.

You ask but small favours of your great friends;
yet your great friends refuse you even small favours.
That you may feel less ashamed, Matho, ask great favours.
An ensign's post you ask;
and that's denied:
Ask for a colonel's ;
less 'twill hurt your pride.

N urtured among the trainers of the amphitheatre, bred up for the chace, fierce in the forest, gentle in the house, I was called Lydia, a most faithful attendant upon my master Dexter, who would not have preferred to me the hound of Erigone, or the dog which followed Cephalus from the land of Crete, and was translated with him to the stars of the light-bringing goddess.
I died, not of length of years, nor of useless old age, as was the fate of the hound of Ulysses ;
I was killed by the fiery tooth of a foaming boar, as huge as that of Calydon or that of Erymanthus.
Nor do I complain, though thus prematurely hurried to the shades below;
I could not have died a nobler death.
I trained was, by masters of the game, r the field no hound more fierce, i' the house more tame;
Lydia my name, my owner's right hand held, Erigone's dog not me in faith excell'd, Nor Lelaps yet, for whose great truth 'tis told, By Jove among the stars he was enrolled.
Like Argus a long life I did not spend
In sloth, by useless age brought to my end :
But the fierce tusks of an enraged boar, Like that of Calydon, my entrails tore.
Nor of my early death do I complain, A nobler fate I could no way sustain.

Can you, Tucca, sell these slaves whom you bought for a hundred thousand sesterces a-piece ?
Can you sell the weeping despots of your affections, Tucca ?
Do neither their caresses nor their words and untutored lamentations move you ?1
If a quantity of hard cash is your object, sell your plate, your tables, your myrrhine vases, your estate, your house.
Sell your old slaves, sell too your hereditary lands ;
sell everything, wretched man, to avoid selling your young favourites.
It was extravagance to buy them ;
who denies or doubts it ?-but it is far greater extravagance to sell them.

You oblige me to pay you eighty pounds, Pactus, because Bucco has occasioned you the loss of sixteen hundred.
Let me not, I pray you, suffer for faults not my own.
It is rather for you, who can support the loss of sixteen hundred, to submit to that of eighty.
Ten pounds, I owe, you call for in a pet, Because Tom broke two hundred in your debt.
Hard!
I should bear the faults of other men ;
You, who could lose two hundred, pray lose ten.

For arriving only at the first milestone after nine hours' travelling, I am charged with idleness and inactivity.
The fault is not mine, I assure you, but your own, in sending me such mules, Paetus.

Though,
Flaccus, I were to praise Baiæ, golden shore of the blessed Venus, Baiæ, kind gift of Nature who is proud of it, in a thousand verses, yet would not Baiæ be praised as it deserves.
But, Flaccus, I prefer Martial1 to Baiæ.
To wish for both at once would be presumptuous.
But if, by the kindness of the gods, that blessing were granted you, what happiness would it be to enjoy Martial's powers and the climate of Baiæ at the same time!
Philostratus, returning to his lodging late at night, from a feast at Sinuessa, famed for its waters, very nearly lost his life, imitating Elpenor1 in his cruel fate, by rolling headlong down the whole length of a flight of stairs.
He would not, ye nymphs of Sinuessa, have incurred so great a danger, had he in preference drunk of your waters.
2 At Bristol, Tom from the mayors feast was led :
And home return'd, was going up to bed:
From the stair-head be like Elpenor fell;
And, like Elpenor, almost dropp'd to hell.
My sober friend!

How safe are you who drink but Bristol water!

Let him who does not wish yet to descend to the waters of Styx, avoid, if he be wise, the barber Antiochus.
The knives with which, when the maddened troop of Cybele's priests rage to the sound of Phrygian measures, their white arms are lacerated, are less cruel than the razor of Antiochus.
More gently does Alcon cut a strangulated hernia, and hew broken bones with his rude hand.
Antiochus should deal with needy Cynics, and the beards of Stoics, and denude the necks of horses of their dusty manes.
If he were to shave Prometheus under the Scythian rock, the Titan would again, with bared breast, demand his executioner the vulture.
Pentheus would flee to his mother, Orpheus to the priestesses of Bacchus, were they to hear but a sound from the bar­ barous weapon of Antiochus.
All these scars, that you count upon my chin, like those that sit upon the brow of an aged boxer, were not produced by the nails of an enraged wife, but by the steel and cursed hand of Antiochus.
Of all animals the goat alone has any sense;
he wears his beard, that he may not risk himself under the hands of Antiochus.
You, who wish not to die before your hour, Trust not your face to barber Scrapeill's power.
A soldier's skin is less severely rent, Who runs the gantlope through his regiment.
Hawkins by far cuts easier for the stone;
And any surgeon sets a broken bone.
A barber, fit for beggars in a lane ;
To dock a horse's tail, or cut his mane.
A felon, martyr'd by such hands as these, Would call upon the hangman's hand for ease.
Debtors for refuge would to bailiffs fly, And tars to press-gangs, when his razor's nigh.
Look on these scars !
how movingly they speak!
And seem as I were burnt in either cheek!
Not of an angry wife they records stand ;
But Scrapeill's razor, and his bungling hand.
A goat is wisest of the brutish herd ;
Who, to avoid a Scrapeill, wears his beard.

To relieve your throat, Parthenopæus, which is incessantly inflamed by a severe cough, your doctor prescribes honey, and nuts, and sweet cakes, and everything that is given to chil­ dren to prevent them from being unruly.
But you do not give over coughing all day long.
A cough is not your malady, Parthenopæus;
it is gluttony.
Your cough the doctor and your sharp Rhumis rage
Which your chopps dayly vexes to asswadge, Prescribes you honey, pine-nutts, and sweate pastes, And what e'er pleases children's liquorish tastes.
To cough all day for this you do not cease :
No cough, but gluttony, is your disease.

You approve of no verses that run with a smooth cadence, but of those only that vault as it were over hills and crags;
and a line such as this, Luceilei columella heic situ' Metrophan' est, " Lucilius's right hand, Metrophanes, lies here," is of more value in your eyes than a poem of Homer;

1Canace, one of the daughters of Æolis, lies buried in this tomb, a little child whose seventh winter was her last. " 0 shame!
0 dire fate !" why are you in haste, traveller, to weep ?
We do not here complain of the shortness of life;
sadder than death itself was the manner of it;
a horrid disease destroyed her face, and seized upon her delicate mouth.
The cruel foe devoured her very lips, nor was her body consigned entire to the funeral pile.
If the fates intended to fall on her with such headlong violence, they should have come in some other form.
But death hastened to close the passage of her sweet voice, lest her tongue should dissuade the stern goddesses from their purpose.
Within this tombe faire Canace is plac't, To whom her seventh winter was her last.
O dire mischance !
Reader, why weepest thou there P 'Tis not her short life that demands thy teare.
Deaths manner's worse than death ;
the dire disease Beset her face, her tender mouth did seize.
The monster sickenesse striv'd a kisse to have.
Her faire lips went not wholly to the grave.
If fates so soone had meant to stop her breath, They should have come some other way.
But death Made haste her tongues sweet musicke to prevent, Lest that should make the fiintie fates relent.

As for the fact that you are exceedingly envious and every­ where carping at my writings, I pardon you, circumcised poet;

Nor am I at all concerned that, while carping at my verses, you steal them ;
for this too, circumcised poet, you have your reasons.

It is the Martian fountain,2 and not the Rhine, that rises nere, German.

Barbarian, a fountain belonging to the conquerors should not allay the thirst of a captive slave, to the exclusion of a citizen.
It is impossible, Flaccus, to avoid the kissers.
They press upon you, they delay you, they pursue you, they run against you, on all sides, from every direction, and in every place.
No malignant ulcer will protect you from them, no inflamed pimples, or diseased chin, or ugly tetter, or lips smeared with oily cerate, or drop at the cold nose.
They kiss you when you are hot and when you are cold;
they kiss you when you are reserving your kiss for your wife.
To envelope your head in a hood will not avail you;
nor to secure your litter with skins and curtains, nor will a chair closed again and again be any defence to you ;
the kisser will find an entrance through every chink.
Not the consul.
ship itself, nor the tribunate, nor the six fasces,1 nor the proud rod of the noisy lictor, will drive off the kisser.
Though you be sitting on the lofty tribunal, and laying down the law to nations from the curule chair, the kisser will climb up to either place ;
he will kiss you in a fever or in tears;
he will kiss you while you are yawning and swimming;
he will kiss you when you are at stool.
The sole remedy for the evil is, to make him, whom you would not wish to kiss, your friend.
There are no means the kissing tribe to shun, They meet you, stop you, after you they run, Press you before, behind, to each side cleave, No place, no time, no men, exempted leave;
A dropping nose, salved lips, can none reprieve, Gangrenes, foul running sores, no one relieve;
They kiss you in a sweat, or starved with cold, Lovers their mistress' kisses cannot hold ;
A chair is no defence, with curtains guarded, With door and windows shut, and closely warded, The kissers, through a chink will find a way, Presume the tribune, consul's self, to stay;
Nor can the awful rods, or Lictor's mace, His stounding voice away these kissers chace, But they'll ascend the Rostra, curule chair, The judges kiss, while they give sentence there.
Those laugh they kiss, and those that sigh and weep;
'Tis all the same whether you laugh or weep;
Those who do bathe, or recreate in pool, Who are withdrawn to ease themselves at stool.
Against this plague I know no fence, but this:
Make him thy friend whom thou abhorr'st to kiss.
Anon.
I have no fancy, Flaccus, for a mistress extraordinarily thin, who can make my rings serve her for bracelets;
who scrapes me with her hips and pricks me with her knees;
whose loins are rough as a saw, or sharp as a lance.
Yet I have no taste for a mistress weighing a thousand pounds;
I am a lover of flesh, but not of fat.
My mistress I'd not have so thin, A ring her armes might compass in;
Whose haunch or knee my sides might weare, Her back a saw, her rump a speare;
Yet her a cart-loade I'd not have ;
'Tis solid flesh, not fatt, I crave.
Old MS. 16th Cent.
And have you been able, Flaccus, to see the slender Thais P Then, Flaccus, I suspect you can see what is invisible.
He told no untruth, Lydia, who informed me that you have a handsome face, but devoid of expression.
It is so;
your face would always look handsome, if you would but be silent, and st as mute as a waxen image, or a picture.
But whenever you speak, Lydia, all your beauty flies, and no tongue does more damage to its owner than yours.
Have a care lest the ædile see and hear you;
it is portentous when a statue speaks.
He lied not, Lydia, who pronounced thee fair, For flesh and blood none may with thee compare.
This is most true while thou dost silent stand, Like some rare piece of a great master's hand.
But when thou speak'st, e en such thy beauty's gone, And their own tongue none ever so did wrong.
Let not the Ædile hear thee silence break:
It is a portent if an image speak.

I KNOW that I owe some apology for my obstinate three years' indolence;
though, indeed, it could by no apology have been excused, even amid the engagements of the city, engagements in which we more easily succeed in making ourselves appear troublesome than serviceable to our friends , and much less is it defensible in this country solitude, where, unless a person studies even to excess, his retreat is at once without consolation and without excuse.
Listen then to my reasons ;
among which the first and principal is this, that 1 miss the audience to which I had grown accustomed at Rome, and seem like an advocate pleading in a strange court;
for if there be anything pleasing in my books it is due to my auditors.
That penetration of judgment, that fertility of invention, the libraries, the theatres, the social meet­ ings, in which pleasure does not perceive that it is studying;
everything, in a word, which we left behind us in satiety, we regret as though utterly deserted.
Add to this the back biting of the provincials, envy usurping the place of criticism, and one or two ill-disposed persons, who, in a small society, are a host ;
circumstances under which it is difficult to be always in the best of humours.
Do not wonder then that I have abandoned in disgust occupa­ tions in which I used to employ myself with delight.
Not to meet you, however, with a refusal on your arrival from town, and when you ask me for what I have done (you, towards whom I should not show a proper feeling of grati­ tude, if I did not exert myself for you to the utmost of my power), I have forced myself to do that which I was once in the habit of doing with pleasure, and have set apart a few days for study, in order to regale your friendly ears with the repast suited to them after their journey.
Be pleased to weigh considerately the offering, which is intrusted without apprehension to you, and do not think it too much labour to examine it;
and, what you may find most difficult, judge of my trifles without scrupulous regard to elegance, lest, if you are too exacting, I send you to Rome a book not merely written in Spain, but in Spanish.
While nets lie unemployed, and Melossian hounds are silent, and while the woods no longer reëcho to shouts in pursuit of the boar, you will be able, Priscus, to accord a portion of your leisure to a short book.

you give me the means of enjoying a not ignoble indolence.
What unto Flaccus, and to Maro thee Mecenas was of royal pedigree Most noble Priscus, that thou art to me.

The palace of Rome has the honour of receiving Nerva, the mildest of princes;

Perfect equity, humane clemency, discreet power, now return;
long-continued alarms have disappeared.
For thee, O affectionate Rome, thy people, and the nations subject to thy empire, utter this prayer:
May such a ruler be ever thine, and may this one especially long reign over thee!
Blessings be upon thy spirit, which is such as few have, and upon thy character, which is such as Numa, or a cheerful Cato,1 might have owned.
Now thou mayst, and it is right that thou shouldst, make presents, display thy beneficence, enlarge the slender incomes of the poor, and grant blessings such as the indulgent gods could scarcely exceed.
For even under a severe prince and in bad times, thou hadst the courage to be good.
Nerva, the gentlest prince, now rules our court ;
We freely may to Helicon resort.
Just faith, and cheerfull mildness, now dwell here, And well-weigh'd power, which banishes all feare.
Rome's provinces and people pray that hee Long may their chief, and long their chiefs such bee.
Goe on, rare prince, whose manners Numa grave, Or Cato (were he less severe) might have.
To bee just, bounty full, enrich the poore, And give so frankly, heav'n could give no more, Is lawfull, now you reign ;
who boldly durst Bee good when times were bad, and the prince curst.

As she so famed a captain did behold, And yet a soldier stout, young, martial, bold, Proud of her prince, thus vauhtingly she spoke:
Parthians, Britains, submit unto my yoke;
Thracians, Scythians, I've a Cæsar now, Come pay your tribute, to my eagles bow.

for who drinks more largely from the Aonian fountain ?
Whose lyre comes forth more ennobled from the cave of the muses P
Whom among all his Pierian followers does Phœbus love more ?
And if by chance (but for this we must scarcely hope) he shall have a moment to spare, beg him to present with his own hands our verses to the emperor;
and to recommend this little book, so humble and so small, with merely four words :
"This your Rome reads."
All health to my and thy Parthenius bring, My muse ;
for who in the Aonian spring E er deeper drank ?
From the Pimplean cave, Whose harp a sweeter, nobler sound e'er gave?
Who of the inspired and immortal choir, Does Phœbus' self more love or more admire ?
Request when he the prince does vacant know (Which hardly can be hoped), my book to show, With these few words my humble verse to speed:
This man, dread Cæsar, all thy Rome does read.

Use more sparingly, I advise you, the gallopping hunter, Priscus, and ride not so furiously after the hare.
The sportsman has often made atonement to the prey, and fallen, never to rise again, from the spirited horse.
The very plain, too, has its dangers;
even though there be no ditch, no mound, no rocky places, yet the level ground is apt to deceive.
There will not be wanting some rider to exhibit to you a spectacle such as this;
but his fall would excite less repining at Fate than yours.
If the excitement of danger attract you, let us spread toils for the wild boars of Tuscany;
courage in that pursuit is safer.
Why do such break-neck steeds delight you ?
They much oftener succeed in killing the rider than the hare.
Dear squire, take my advice;
your hunter spare:
Nor with such violence pursue a hare.
The sportsman often does the prey become;
And from his horse receive his final doom.
No ground is safe :
if ditch nor bar remain, Nor pit, your horse may stumble on a plain ;
There are enough, at distance to divert, And break their neck, who have not your desert.
If manly exercise such pleasure yields, Safer and nobler seek in Belgic fields.
Why ride at all, and madly fate defy ?

But very lately (and with shame, yes, with shame I confess it) we were all poor as well as Jupiter.
Whatever shined in the Parrhasian hall Is to our eyes and to our gods giv'n all ;
Jupiter stands and wonders to behold Himself in Scythian flames of sparkling gold;
Great Cæsar's pleasant pride, and vast expense.
These cups may suit with Jove's magnificence, Such as may well become the Phrygian boy, Now all with Jove are rich and clad wit'i joy.
It shames, it shames me to confess of yore
How all of us with Jove were very poor.
Fletcher,You have made away, Labienus, with three of your farms;
you have purchased, Labienus, three favourites:
you are making three farms, Labienus, the object of your love.
You inquire, Lentinus, why your fever does not leave you for so many days, and you complain bitterly on the subject.
It is carried about with you in your lifter;
it bathes with you;
it feeds upon mushrooms, oysters, sow's paps, and wild boar, with you.
It is often inebriated with Setine, and often with Falernian wine;
nor does it quaff Cæcuban unless it be mixed with snow water.
It reclines with you, decked with roses, and darkened with amomum ;
and sleeps with you on down, and on a purple bed.
Seeing that your fever is so well treated, and lives so comfortably in your society, do you expect it to transfer itself in preference to Dama ?
Your fever still attends you, though you grieve;
Though you complain, will not one moment leave.
With you it travels in a chariot;
dines
With you, on truffles, oysters, sweetbreads, chines:
Drinks hock ;
in Burgundy is very nice;
Nor will taste claret, till 'tis cool'd in ice ;
Reclines at ease;
and smells to some perfume;
Lodges on down, in a well-furnished room.
Think you, a fever, which you treat so well, Will with a porter or a cobler dwell ?
Say.
Whilst you, my Juvenal, are perhaps wandering restless in the noisy Suburra or pacing the hill of the goddess Diana:
whilst your toga, in which you perspire at the thresholds of your influential friends, is fanning you as you go, and the greater and lesser Cælian hills fatigue you in your wan­ derings ;
my own Bilbilis, revisited after many winters, has received me, and made me a country gentleman;
Bilbilis, proud of its gold and its iron!
Here we indolently cultivate with agreeable labour Boterduna and Platea;
these are the some­ what rude names of Celtiberian localities.
I enjoy profound and extraordinary sleep, which is frequently unbroken, even at nine in the morning;
and I am now indemnifying myself fully for all the interruptions to sleep that I endured for thirty years.
The toga here is unknown, but the nearest dress is given me, when I ask for it, from an old press.
When I rise, a hearth, heaped up with faggots from a neighbour­ ing oak grove, welcomes me;
a hearth which the bailiff's wife crowns with many a pot.
Then comes the housemaid, such a one as you would envy me.
A close-shorn bailiff issues the orders to my boy attendants, and begs that they may be obliged to lay aside their long hair.'
Thus I delight to live, and thus I hope to die.
While you perhaps now crowd thro'
Temple-bar, Stunn'd with the din of rattling coach and car Or towards Paul's are mounting Ludgate-street ;
Or running to the levee of the great;
Or in your lawyer's gown, are driving hard;
Either through great or little Palace-yard ;
My native Sussex, and her favourite shore, Of golden harvests proud, and iron ore, Me, her too long absenting renegade, Again revives, and hath a farmer made.
Busy but plens'd, and idly taking pains, Here Lewes Downs I till, and Ringmer plains;
Names which to each South Saxon are well known, Though they sound harsh to powder'd beaux in town.
None can enjoy a sounder sleep than mine;
I often do not wake till after nine;
And midnight hours with interest repay, For years in town diversions thrown away.
Stranger to finery, myself I dress,
In the first coat from an old broken press.
My fire, as soon as I am up, I see Bright with the ruins of some neighbouring tree ;
And early by a country cook-wench crown'd With boiling pots and skillets all around.
Next comes my dairy-maid;
and such a one, As Pan himself might wish to meet alone.
My boys, whose heads rough as a filly's grow Are summoned by my bailiff to the plough.
Such is my life.
a life of liberty :
So would I wish to live, and so to die.
HayAt the warm baths Aemilius takes lettuces, eggs, and anchovies,1 and then says that he does not dine out.
Do you ask, Fabullus, why Themison has not a wife ?
He has a sister.
You lately were inquiring.
why Silvester Has not yet got a wife ?
-He has a sister.
Hay.
Who would imagine, Marcella, that you dwelt upon the banks of the iron-hardening Salo,2 and were born in our regions ?
So rare, so sweet is your disposition!
The court of Cæsar will say, should it but once hear your voice, that you belong to itself.
Nor can any woman born in the midst of the Suburra, nor any native of the Capitoline Hill, vie with you.
Nor will any glorious foreign offspring more fit to be a daughter of Rome soon smile upon its mother.
You cause my longing for the Queen of Cities to be more sup­ portable ;
you alone are a Rome to file.
That you were born, and ever since have lived, In Derby Peak, is scarce to be conceived.
Wit so uncommon, and diverting too, Courts might admire, and challenge as their due.
No Pall Mall lady can with you compare;
None who sees company in Grosvenor-square.
Nor soon again will shine in tracts unknown, One, who would be an ornament to town.
You for the lost metropolis atone ;
And London I enjoy in you alone.
Hay.
Do you wish me, Fabullus, to tell you in few words how ugly Philænis is with her one eye ?
Philænis would be better looking with no eye at all.
You wear bought teeth, and bought hair, Tallia, without a blush.
What will you do for an eye ?
You cannot buy that.
Your hair and teeth you're not asham'd to buy.
What will you do, should'st lose the other eye ?
Hay.
Your teeth from Hemmett, and your hair from Bolney :
Was not an eye to be procured for money ?
Dr. Hoadley.
O carriage, that affordest a sweet solitude!
-Gift of ray eloquent friend AElianus, more pleasant than open curricle or chariot!
Here, Juvatus, you may say to me whatever comes into your head.
No black driver of a Libyan horse, no well­ girt running footman in front of us, no muleteer alongside;
and the horses will not babble.
Would that Avitus were here with us ;
I should not tear his third pair of ears.
Thus how charmingly would the whole day pass!
How pleasant is this one-horse chair!
In which alone I take the air:
'Tis Pleadwell's present:
for my age, There is no better equipage.
Now with thy master, Ball, be free;
And say whatever you please to me.
No master of the horse have I, Or groom or running footman by.
And though your curb and harness rattle, The devil's in it, if they tattle.
Would that my honest friend Ned Hearty
Were here but with us of the party !
I should not fear, that he would tell:
We three might pass the day full well.
Hay.
When I ask you for a loan without offering you security, you say, " I have no money."
Yet, if my farm stands pledged for me, you have money.
What you refuse, Telesinus, to lend me, your old friend, you are willing to lend to my acres and my trees.
But see !
Carus1 has accused you before the magistrate;
let my farm undertake your defence.
Or if you look for a companion when you go intc exile;
let mj farm attend you.
If I want money;
you have none, you cry:
But lend it, if my field's security.
With what you would not trust your ancient friend, That to my acres and my trees you lend.
Are you indicted for a breach of laws ?
Go to my field.
and let him plead your cause.
Want you a friend your banishment to ease ?
Let my field travel with you, if he please.
Hay.
When you, a senator, go about knocking at sixty doors every morning, I appear in your estimation but a slothful knight, for not running all over the city from the first dawn of day, and bringing home, fatigued and worn out, some thousand kisses.
1
But you do all this, that you may add a new name to the Fasti, or that you may be sent as governor to the Numidians or Cappadocians;
while, as to me, whom you persuade to break my slumbers unseasonably, and en­ dure the morning mud, what have I to expect ?
When my foot bursts out from my torn shoe, when a pelting shower of rain has suddenly drenched me, and when, on taking off my outer-coat, no servant answers my call, your slave comes up to my chilly ear, and says, " Lætorius requests your company at dinner."
What, at a dinner of which my share is worth twenty sesterces ?
Not I.
I prefer my own scanty fare, rather than have a dinner for my reward, while yours is a province;
rather than that while our labour is the same, our gains should be so different.
When in your borough you yourself bestir, I do appear to you an idle cur;
That by day-break I run not up and down,
And kiss each voter's wife throughout the town
By this you may gain credit in the nation ;
Or be made governor of some plantation.
But as for me, what end can I obtain ?
Whom you compel to break my rest in vain,
And early march along a dirty street, With scarce a shoe entire upon my feet:
And if a sudden heavy shower descends, Without a boy, who with a cloak attends.
Your servant whispers to me in this plight, ' His honour begs you'll sup with him to-night!
Had I not rather by myself keep Lent ?
Let not our pains and pay be different!
Is it not hard, that this should be the case ?
1 but a supper get, and you a place.
You say, Senia, that you were violated by robbers, but the robbers deny it.
She ravished was by highwaymen, she cries:
Flatly the fact each highwayman denies.
HaVe
The size of the cups, Cinna, from which I drink, and that of those from which you drink, are in the proportion of seven to eleven;
and yet you complain that we do not drink the same sort of wine.
I drink a pint;
a gallon you :
for shame!
Can you complain, the wine is not the same ?
Hay.
Hermogenes, it seems to me, Ponticus, is as great a thief of napkins as Massa was of money.
Even though you watch his right hand, and hold his left, be will find means to ab­ stract your napkin.
With like subtilty does the breath of the stag draw out the cold snake;
1 and the rainbow exhale the waters from the clouds.
Lately, while a respite was im­ plored for Myrinus,2 who had been wounded in a conflict, Hermogenes contrived to filch four napkins.
Just as the prætor was going to drop his white napkin, to start the horses in the circus, Hermogenes stole it.
When at last nobody brought a napkin with him, for fear of thefts, Hermogenes stole the cloth from the table.
And should there be nothing of this kind to steal, Hermogenes does not hesitate to detach the ornaments from the couches,3 or the feet from the tables.
However immoderate may be the heat in the theatres, the awnings are withdrawn when Hermogenes makes his appear­ ance.
The sailors, in trembling haste, proceed to furl their sails whenever Hermogenes shows himself in the harbour.
The bareheaded priests of Isis, clad in linen vestments, and the choristers who play the sistrum, betake themselves to flight when Hermogenes comes to worship.
Hermogenes never took a napkin to dinner;
Hermogenes never came away from a dinner without one.
Aper is abstemious and sober.
What is that to me ?
For such a quality I praise my slave, not my friend.
Tom never drinks :
that I should much commend In Tom my coachman, but not Tom my friend.
Hay.
This grove, these fountains, this interwoven shade of the spreading vine ;
this meandering stream of gurgling water ;
these meadows, and these rosaries which will not yield to the twice-bearing Pæstum;
these vegetables which bloom in the month of January, and feel not the cold;
these eels that swim domestic in the enclosed waters ;
this white tower which affords an asylum for doves like itself in colour ;
all these are the gift of my mistress;
Marcella gave me this retreat, this little kingdom, on my return to my native home after thirty-five years of absence.
Had Nausicaa offered me the gardens of her sire, 1 should have said to Alcinous, " I prefer my own."
This grove ;
these fountains ;
tonsile Linden's shade;
Refreshing streams, by ductile waters made ;
These flowering meadows, still like Eden gay;
These pot-herbs green, that dare the coldest day;
This eel, which swims familiar to the sight;
This towering dove-house, cover'd with its flight;
I to my wife, after long absence, owe:
'Tis she this house, this kingdom, did bestow :
Could I with the first fair have paradise, Blest as I am, the boon I would despise Hay.
Oh disgrace of the Calends of July, I saw, Vaccrra, I saw Your chattels, which, refused by the landlord in discharge of two years' rent, were carried away by your wife, distinguish­ able by her seven carroty hairs, your hoary-headed mother, and your giantess of a sister.
I thought at first they were Furies emerging from the shades of Pluto.
They went be­ fore, while you, wasted with cold and hunger, and paler than a piece of old box-wood, the very Irus of your day, followed.
People might have thought that the Aricine Hill was migrate ing.
There went in procession a three-legged bed, a two footed table, a lamp, a horn cup, and a cracked chamber­ pot, leaking through its side.
Close to these was a rusty stove, the neck of a wine-vessel, and ajar, which its disgust­ ing smell proved to have contained pilchards and decayed herrings, a smell like that wafted by the breeze from a pond of stagnant water.
Nor was there wanting a slice of Toulouse cheese;
a garland, four years old, of black pennyroyal;
a rope of bald' garlic and onions ;
or a pot belonging to your mother, full of offensive resin, which the easy dames of the Suburra use at their toilette.
Why are you looking about for a house and deluding agents,2 when you may live for nothing, Vacerra?
This pompous train of baggage just suits the bridged O jest and shame of such as households move, When July comes, and do new dwellings prove!
I saw thy stuff, Vacer, thy stuff I saw, Which, for thy rent, not seized on by law, Thy landlord rather glad such trash to spare, Thy red-faced wife, with seven red hairs, did bear, Helped by thy giant sister, and thy mother;
Men thought the furies there were got together;
For such their number was, and such their faces, That Pluto seem'd to have lent thee his three graces.
The Irus of thy age, thou these didst follow, Thy skin, like seasoned box, distain'd and yellow ;
With cold and hunger, also dry'd and parched:
All beggars-bush, the people thought, had march'd.
A two-legg'd table, and a three-legg'd bed There went;
a pan with fire, on thine own head.
A sconce and goblet all of massy horn;
A jorden, itself pissing, as 'twas borne ;
Stale sprats and pilchards could not be concealed, Their obscene scent their presence there reveal'd.
Nor did there want to go in state with these, A cantle of unsav'ry Toulouse cheese ;
A wisp of penyroyal, four years old;
A rope, which onions had, but pick'd, and bald ;
A pot of turpentine, thy mother's care, The brothel dames with such fetch off their hair.
Why mock'at thou landlords, and dost houses see, When gratis, Vacer, may thy dwelling be ?
Such pomp of goods, such household stuff pertains
To highways, hedges, bridges, and to lanes.
Anoss.
Four-and-thirty years, Julius, if I remember right, I passed in your society ;
have shared your friendship, the delights of which were not unmixed with pain, but the pleasures prepon­ derated.
And if all the stones of different colours, that mark the several days, were placed in juxtaposition, the white would far exceed the black.
Would you avoid many griefs, and escape heart-readings, make of no one too dear a friend.
You will have less joy, but your sorrow will be less.
Julius, 'twas foure-and-thirty year That thou and I together were.
Sweeter days were mix'd with soure, But yet the pleasanter were more.
And if we should divide the time With a diverse-coloured line, The white would over-vie the black.
If thou wouldst shun the bitter smack, And stinging tortures of the mind, No man to thee do too much bind, Or too much in thy friend believe:
Thou shalt joy less, and less shalt grieve.
Fletcher,
We two, in fair and in foul weather.
Thirty-four years have pass'd together.
Nor sweet nor sour our cup did want;
Yet sweet hath been predominant:
And, bring life's chequer'd board to light, Fewer the spots of black than white.
Would you sibun many things to curse, And guard against the mind's remorse, With none too intimately live ;
Less you'll rejoice, and less will grieve.
Hay.
O Callistrato, gUsto come se tu fossi meco sincerissimo, suoli sovvente dirmi che set stato precise.
Non sei poi tanto sincere, quanto vuoi, o Callistrato, esser creduto;
imperocchè, chiunque dice tali cose, ne tace le più.
Graglia.
Open and frank you would to me appear, And tell some little fault, to seem sincere;
But your sincerity's not deep I feel:
You tell a little, but you much conceal.
Anon.
Free from reserve you would to me appear, And tell me, you 're diseased, to seem sincere.
But with a friend this is not dealing well;
For he must more conceal, who this could tell.

Because no one but yourself, Labullus, gives a friend two or three pounds, a thin toga, and a scanty cloak, sometimes a few gold pieces, which you chink in your hand, and which are to last for a couple of months, you are not for that reason, believe me, a good man.
What then ?
To speak the truth, the best of bad ones.
Give us back our Pisos, and our Senecas, our Memmi and our Crispi, I mean those of old time, and you will forthwith become the last of good men.
Do you wish to boast of your running, and swiftness of foot ?
Outstrip Tigris and the fleet Passerinus.
1
There is no glory in outstripping asses.
Though you bestow upon a man of worth, A jacket, joseph, dinner, or so forth ;
A piece or two in hand, which soon must fail, And save but two months longer from a jail ;
And though scarce one besides yourself dota thus I Believe me, air, you are not generous.
What am I then ?
say you.
Why truly, I, sir, Think you at best a better sort of miser.
Recall to mind the Pisos, Senecas;
Bounty, which is not now, but such as was;
Compared with them, how much are you surpass'd!
Of all the generous men you are the last.
If for Newmarket plate you would contend;
'Tis strength, 'tis swiftness, that must recommend.
The glory is, from the best horse to gain;
Not to o ertake an ass upon the plain.
Hay.
You wish to be regarded as having an extremely good nose.
I like a man with a good nose, but object to one with a polypus.
1,You have no reason to fear yon person, Candid us, who, strut­ ting about night and day, is well known throughout the city to the litters of the ladies, whose hair shines so brightly, and is darkened with unguents;
who is radiant in purple, of delicate feature, broad chest, and smooth limbs, and who con. stantly follows your wife with importunities.
Fear him not, Candidus, he does not meddle in your department.
I hate you, Prettyman, because you are always acting the pretty fellow.
A pretty fellow is a contemptible thing, and so is Prettyman.
I prefer a manly man to Prettyman.
May you wither away prettily, Prettyman.
I hate your prettiness, Sabellus:
'Tis little, so are you, Sabellus.
I like a manly mien, Sabellus :
But you live prettily, Sabellus,— Mayst thou die prettily, Sabellus.

You utter all sorts of falsehoods, Pontilianus;
I assent to them.
You recite bad verses;
I praise them.
You sing ;
1 do the same.
You drink, Pontilianus ;
I drink also.
You are rude;
I pretend not to perceive it.
You wish to play at chess ;
I allow myself to be beaten.
There is one thing only which you do without me, and I hold my tongue on the sub­ ject.
Yet you never make me the slightest present. "
When I die," say you, " I shall remember you handsomely."
I do not look for anything;
but die.
I praise your doggerel verse:
believe your lye:
You sing, I sing:
you drink, and so do I.
You bet, I lose:
we play, you win the game:
One thing, you do without me, I don't name.
And yet you nothing give me:
when you die, You promise much:
—but one more wish have I. Hay.
You are not content, Tucca, to be a glutton.
You long to be called and to appear a glutton.
'Tis not sufficient that thou drunk hast been, But thou desir'st so to be call'd and seen.

The bearded Callistratus has been taken in marriage by the lusty Afer, in the same way as a virgin is usually taken in marriage by her husband.
The torches shone forth, the flame- coloured veil concealed the bride's countenance, and the lan­ guage heard at bridals was not wanting.
Even the dowry was settled.
Does not this seem yet enough to you, Rome ?
Do you expect that the bride should present the spouse with pledges of affection ?
Unicus, name connected with me by ties of blood, and attached to me by similarity of pursuit;
while the verses which you write yield the palm only to those of your brother, you are not inferior to him in ability, and are superior to him in affection.
Lesbia would have shared her love for the ten­ der Catullus with you, sweet Corinna would have followed you next to her Ovid.
Nor would the Zephyrs have refused their assistance, had you been pleased to spread wide your sails, but you prefer the shore.
This too is a peculiarity which you have from your brother.
We both in name and blood allyed are, And to like studies like affection bear:
Thy brother's verse when thine thou set'st before, Thy art's not less, but piety is more :
When thee Corinna, Lesbia would admire, Equal to those they did themselves inspire:
When, if thou'dst spread thy wings, a brisker air, And loftier numbers none e'er higher bear:
Thou flag'st thy plumes, restrain'st thy soaring vein, And shew'st thyself a brother here again.
Anon. 1695.
It was not without wit, Phœbus, that a person said of you, when you covered your bald pate and temples with a kid's skin, that your head was well shod.

Goldsmith's RetaliationIf you put on table before me mushrooms and wild boar as common fare, and do not presume that such dishes are the object of my prayers, it is well;
but if you imagine that by them I am made happy, and expect to get yourself inscribed in my will, as my heir, in return for some half-dozen Lucrine oysters, good-bye to you.
Yet your dinner is a handsome one, I admit, most handsome, but to-morrow nothing of it will re­ main ;
nay, this very day, in fact this very moment, there is nothing of it but what a common sponge at the end of a mop-stick, or a famished dog, or any street convenience can take away.
Of mullets and hares and sow's teats, the result is cadaverous complexion and gouty feet.
In my estimation, no Alban revolt no feasts in the Capitol, nor banquets of the chief priests, would be worth so much.

Seek other guests, Sir Host, who may be caught by the regal sumptuousness of your table ;
as for me, I prefer a friendly invitation to a hastily arranged little dinner :
it is such a re­ past as I can return that pleases me.
As common fare, when sausages and chine You place before me, I with pleasure dine.
But if you think to please me ;
or conceive
By soups to be my heir;
I take my leave.
Your dinner's nice, extremely nice, I own;
Yet it is nought the moment it is down.
Perchance, it to a dirty mop may fall, A hungry dog, close-stool, or urinal.
In what ends mullet, hare, and seasoned meat P In ashy countenance, and gouty feet.
Dear at that rate the most delicious cheer:
A coronation feast by much too dear!
Think you, when you your Burgundy do pour, You honour me ?
the thought will turn it sour.
Proud entertainer, seek another guest
To praise the regal splendour of your feast.
Me let a friend to a chance scrap receive:
I like a dinner such as I can give.

O Linus, preceptor of the long-haired troop, whom the rich Postumilla calls the lord of her fortune, and to whom she intrusts gems, gold, plate, wines, favourites:
so may your patroness prefer you to all others, having made proof of your lasting fidelity, as you grant to my prayer the indulgence of my wretched desires, and keep at times but a negligent watch over those objects which have taken possession of my heart, which in my longing I pray day and night to clasp as my own-beautiful, snow-white, equal in size, twins, large-­ not slaves, but pearls.

And eager on my breast infold:

You are distinguished for possessing laurel-groves, avenues of plane-trees, towering cypresses, and most capacious bath.
Your lofty portico stands on a hundred columns, and is paved with polished marble.
The swift-footed horse makes your dusty hippodrome resound with his hoofs, and the mur­ mur of fountains is heard on every side.
Your halls are spacious and extensive ;
but there are no chambers either for dining or for sleep.
How pleasantly you do not live!
None equal you in trees for ever green:
Your bathes the most majestic can be seen:
Your colonnade is lofty, spacious, fine :
And under-foot your marble pavements shine :
Round your wide park the fleeting courser bounds:
Many cascades salute us with their sounds :
Apartments grand:
no place to eat or sleep!
What a most noble house you do not keep.
Hay.
So thick your planes and laurels spread, And cypress groves so near the head High in the air;
your baths so wide Expand their stream on every side, They'd shade and bathe full half the town ;
Yet shades and baths are all your own.
Your porch an hundred columns soars ;
You tread on alabaster floors ;
The race-horse beats your dusty ring;
Fountains, with ever-wasting spring, Fall on the ear with gliding sound, And spacious courts are opening round.
Tis all so grand and go complete, There is no room to sleep or eat:
How excellently lodged, air, here In this no-lodging you appear!

Here, Sempronia, lies your late husband Rufus, whose brows were wreathed with Pierian chaplets, and whose elo­ quence in defence of dejected criminals was renowned;
his very ashes burn with love for you.
You are the theme of admiration in the Elysian fields, and Helen herself marvels at the story of your abduction.
You are superior to her, as you deserted him who overcame you, and returned, but sibe would not follow her husband, even when he sought to regain her.
Menelaus smiles, and listens to these new Trojan-like amours;
the violence done to you excuses the Phrygian Paris.
When the joyful asylum of the pious shall one day receive you, there will be no shade in the Stygian abodes better known than yourself.
Proserpina does not look with aversion upon fair ones that have been carried off, but loves them.
Your amour will gain you the queen's favour.
He that his brows deck'd with the muses' crown, Whose voice to guilty men no less was known, Sempronia, here thy Rufus, here is laid, Whose dust even with thy love still drives a trade.
'Mongst the blest shades thy story he doth bear, And Helen's self thy rape admires to hear:
Thou better from thy spoiler didst return, She, though redeem d, did after Troy still burn.
Menelaus laughs and hears the Ilian loves, Thy rape old Paris' guilt forgives, removes.
And when thee those bless'd mansions shall receive
No shade greater acquaintance there shall have.
Proserpina loves although she cannot see Such rapes, that love shall make her kind to thee.

Although you possess abundance of money and wealth.
Paternus, such as but few other citizens possess, you never make any present, and brood over your hoard like the great dragon, which the poets sing of as the guardian of the Scythian grove.
The cause, as you yourself allege and boast, is the dire rapacity of your son.
Pray are you looking for fools and novices to beguile and delude P
To this vice you have ever been a father.
When thou hast so much coin and wealth with thee That seldom citizens or fathers see.
Yet are not liberal, but thy heaps hang'st o'er Like the great dragon, whom the bards of yore Feign'd to be keeper of the Scythian grove, But the base cause of this thy muck-worm love, Thou brag'st and dost pretend thy son to be:
Why dOlt delude us with this foolery, As though we blocks or idiots bad been ?

You ask why I so often go to my small domain at arid Momentum and the humble household at my farm ?
There is no place in town, Sparsus, where a poor man can either think or rest.
One cannot live for schoolmasters in the morning, corn grinders at night, and braziers' hammers all day and night.
Here the money-changer indolently rattles piles of Nero's rough coins on his dirty counter;
there a beater of Spanish gold1 belabours his worn stone with shining mallet.
N or does the fanatic rabble of Bellona cease from its clamour, nor the gabbling sailor with his piece of wreck hung over his shoulder;
nor the Jew boy, brought up to begging by his mother, nor the blear-eyed huckster of matches.
Who can enumerate the various interruptions to sleep at Rome ?
As well might you tell how many hands in the city strike the cymbals, when the moon under eclipse is assailed with the sound of the Colchian magic rhomb.

You, Sparsus, are ignorant of such things, living, as you do, in luxurious ease on your Petilian domain ;
3 whose mansion, though on a level plane, overlooks the lofty hills which surround it;
who enjoy the country in the city.

Within your own premises is a retired carriage drive;
in your deep recesses sleep and repose are unbroken by the noise of tongues:
and no daylight penetrates unless purposely admitted.
But I am awakened by the laughter of the passing crowd ;
and all Rome is at my bed-side.
When- ever, overcome with weariness, I long for repose, I repair to my country-house.
Why to a homely cottage I retire, On a dry spot, not far from Harrow spire P Because a man, so poor as It may creep Round town;
nor find a hole to think of sleep.
Is it to live ?
to lodge as in a mill:
] Disturb'd each morn by chimney-sweepers shrill:
With pewterers' hammers tinkling in one's ears:
With alley jobbers crying bulls and bears.
Here Irish bog-trotters, now paviors grown, Ram with loud hems and thump the shining stone.
There soldiers marching to their duty come, With trumpets sounding, and with beat of drum.
Dunn'd by a sailor with a wooden leg;
Or little Palatine brought up to beg.
Stunn'd by a train of ragged dirty wretches, Hawking a Grub-street paper, or card matches.
The ways to lose one's sleep whoever tells, Might count the changes on St. Martin's bells.
But you, my lord, know none of all this ill, Whose palace looks o'er Constitution Hill.
Your rus in urbe delicately yields A prospect fair o'er Chelsea s twice-mow'd fields.
Within your gate a yard to turn a coach:
Your chamber safe from noise and day's approach.
No passing mob with idle jokes to noise it ;
Nor lodging-room with London for its closet.
Fatigued with all this hubbub, far we fly it, To pass in country cot the night in quiet.

Rome gives, on one's return after fifteen years' absence, such a number of kisses.
as exceeds those given by Lesbia to Catullus.
Every neighbour, every hairy-faced farmer, presses on you with a strongly-scented kiss.
Here the weaver assails you, there the fuller and the cobbler, who has just been kiss­ mg leather;
here the owner of a filthy beard, and a one-eyed gentleman;
there one with bleared eyes, and fellows whose mouths are defiled with all manner of abominations.

O day, nursling of Mars,1 on which I first beheld the rosy light of Aurora, and the broad face of the sun, shouldst thou feel shame at being celebrated in the country, and at an altar of turf, who usedst to be celebrated by me in the city of Rome, be indulgent, if I am unwilling to be a slave upon my own birthday, and if I wish to live, 2 on the day on which I received life.
Hail, Taffi's day!
on which my race begun:
On which I first beheld the glorious sun.
That day I now in rural ease will spend;
In banquet whilom pass'd with many a friend.
No longer slave to forms, I will contrive, Upon that day, which gave me life, to live.
Is it to keep the day ? in pain to sup, About Sir Harry's hock, and Ned's spice-cup;
Anxious the punch well zested be, and bright:
The tables, dishes, company placed right.
Rising each moment during the whole feast;
And catching cold to compliment each guest.
Were this commanded, we should not comply:
Why therefore choose such formal slavery.

To be the burden of a song:

And that thy beneficence and favour for these deserts may be greater, it is both a father and a careful man that thus magni­ ficently celebrates thy festival.

During a whole night of pleasure, the beauteous Phyllis had shown herself kind to me in every way;
and, as I was thinking in the morning what present to make her, whether a pound of Cosmus' or Niceros' perfumes, or a piece of fine Spanish wool, or ten yellow coins of Domitian, she threw her arms round my neck, and caressing me with a long kiss, like those of amorous doves, proceeded to ask me for-a jar of wine.
To charming Cælia's arms I flew, And there all night I feasted ;
No god such transports ever knew, No mortal ever tasted.
Lost in the sweet tumultuous joy, And pleas'd beyond expressing, How can your slave, my fair, said I, Reward so great a blessing ?
The whole creation's wealth survey;
Through both the Indies wander;
Ask what brib'd senates give away, And fighting monarchs squander.

The rifled ocean's treasure;

She blushing cried, my life, my dear, Since Cælia thus you fancy, Give her, but 'tis too much, I fear, A rundlet of right Nancy.
Tom Brown With me fair Phyllis pass'd the night And strove to please with new delight:
An at the dawn I musing lay How all her favours to repay, In china ware, or tea, or snuff, Or in some gaudy piece of stuff;

Though your house cost you a hundred thousand sesterces, you pretend to be willing to sell it for even a smaller sum.
But you are seeking, Amœnus, to over-reach your purchaser by art and cunning, for your house is hidden amid the rich furniture with which it is gorgeously adorned.
Couches gemmed with tortoise-shell, and valuable solid furniture of citron-wood from Africa, glitter at the entrance ;
silver and gold vases are supported upon a Delphic table of extra­ ordinary beauty, and slaves stand by whom I would will­ ingly pray to be my masters.
Then you talk of two hundred thousand sesterces, and say that it cannot be had for less.
You offer a house so exquisitely furnished, Amœnus, at a low price.

When recently a miserable bow-legged slave used to carry Aper's linen to the bath for him, and a one-eyed old woman sat on his paltry toga to guard it, while a herniose bathing man supplied him with his drop of oil, he used to be a severe and unsparing censor of drunkards.
" Break your cups, and throw away your Falernian," he would exclaim to any knight who drank anything on leaving the bath.
But since three hundred thousand sesterces came to him from his old uncle, he cannot go home from the warm baths sober.
Oh what power have!
jewelled cups and a retinue of five long-haired servants ave!
Aper, as long as he was a poor man, did not suffer from thirst.
Tom had a lad lame with a broken thigh ;
And an old housekeeper with but one eye:
On greasy steaks from chop-house did regale;
And against drunkards most devoutly rail.
Did you for bottles after dinner call;
He damn'd the bottles, glasses, wine, and all.
Now an estate is from an uncle come ;
He from the tavern ne'er goes sober home;
Such the effect of plate and lacqueys five!
When poor, Tom was the soberest man alive.

Although the Nile vessels bring you goblets of crystal, yet accept some cups from the Flaminian circus.
Are these cups the more audacious, or those who send such presents ?
But there is a double advantage in the use of these common vessels;
no thief is allured, Flaccus, by such specimens of art, and they are not cracked by over-heated water.
Nay more, the guest drinks without disturbing the peace of the attendant, and trembling bauds have no fear lest they should fall.
This too is something, that if, after a toast, you must break your cup, Flaccus, you will propose it in one of these vessels.
Though ships from China bring you cup and jar;
Accept this mug of homely Lambeth ware.
Bold is the man, who such a present sends;
Though a cheap pot may answer several ends.
A thief for this will hardly risk his neck:
Nor easily will scalding water break.
The servant brings it in no pain at all, Nor have you any, lest you let it fall.
You pledge not him, you think has a disease, But drop the cup, and break it, if you please.

If you bring linen with you,1 he will declare it whiter than snow, even though it be dirtier than a child's bib.
If you comb your scanty hair with the toothed ivory, he will say that you have arranged your tresses like those of Achilles.

it not so big as his nose.
Do not dishonour such large gold dishes with an insigni­ ficant mullet;
it ought, at least, to weigh two pounds.
We warn you not to look with too much contempt on Arretine vases ;
Porsena's splendid service was of Etruscan pottery.

If you have visited the country of the learned Catullus, you have drunk Rhætian wine from my earthenware.
Though mushrooms (boleti) have given me so noble a name, I am used, I am ashamed to say it, for cabbages.
Accept these cups formed of no common clay, but the polished work of a Surrentine potter's wheel.
Temper your cups of Setine wine, I advise you, with snow put into me.
You may use linen strainers for inferior wines.
Our coarse linen, too, will clarify snow-water, which does not gush any colder from your fine strainer.
Let cold water not be wanting, and the warm will be at command ;

Here is presented to you a red pitcher with twisted handle;
the Stoic Fronto used to fetch his water in this vessel.
The Satyr loves us;
Bacchus loves us ;
and so too the intoxicated tigress, whom we have taught to lick the feet of her master.
Accept these cups, fashioned of Saguntine clay, which your servant may take and handle without anxiety.
See how the gold, begemmed with Scythian emeralds, glistens !
How many fingers does this cup deprive of jewels !
2Here is a gemmed cup, which bears the name of Cosmus;

You break crystal cups in your anxiety to avoid breaking them ;

Careless and carefull hands like faults commit.

The nimbus that comes from Jupiter will supply you with abundance of water to mix with your wine ;
this nimbus will give you wine itself.
1If you drink your wine warm, a Myrrhine cup is best for hot Falernian ;
and the flavour of the wine is improved by it.
This plate of red Cumæan earth is sent you by the chaste Sibyl.
It is a native of the same place with herself.
Behold the talent of the Nile.
Alas!

This is Egyptian work.
How oft does taste, Aiming too high, its toilsome efforts waste IF.
S. B.You drink Spoletine wine, or that which has been stored in Marsian cellars.
Of what use to you is the noble luxury of iced water ?
To drink not snow, but water iced with snow, is the device of ingenious thirst.
Do not, my slave, mix the smoky wine of Marseilles with iced water, lest the water cost you more than the wine.
Massilia's smoke forbear with snow to blend:
Nor more on water, than on wine, expend.

When I have been called for by a snap of my master's fingers, and the attendant has loitered, oh how often has the cushion been my rival!
Though knights and senators call me ligula, I am called lingula by ignorant grammarians.
1I am suitable for shell-fish, but not less so for eggs.
Pray can you tell why the one has given me a name rather than the other ?
In old times we were frequently, but now we are rarely, presented to a friend.

If I could, I should have been glad to send you a whole suit;
as it is I send you only a covering for your head.
My wool is not deceitful, nor do I change my colour in the dying vat.
Tyrian wool may please by such means;
my colour is that of the sheep I clothed.
My wool has never known the arts of Tyre, The sheep that bore it was its only dyer.

On mine a dish may be placed without doing any harm.
You did not know, simpleton, how to suit your cloak to me.

You may bury your foot in this hairy covering.
While your toga enjoys a rest of five days,3 you may, if you please, make use of this vestment.
If, witL the intention of reciting, I happen to present to you a little book, let this muffler defend your ears.
The Patavian triple tissue is composed of many fleeces;

Chance has given you this sponge, useful for wiping tables, when it is slightly distended with the water which it imbibes.
Such is my whiteness, such the beauty of my long hair, that you would like to wear me even in the midst of harvest.
Rub your hair with the nard of Cosmus, and your pillow will smell of it.
When your hair has lost the perfume, the pillow retains it.
Your woolly coverlet is radiant with purple trimmings ;

Parma for those of the second.
The sheep whose wool is of the third quality distinguishes Altinum.
I was the present of the shepherd-prince to his Spartan mistress.
Her mother Leda's purple robe was inferior to me.
The territory of Pollentia is accustomed to give us, not only wool of a dark colour, but also cups.
I am, it is true, a sad-coloured wool;

Is the sacking3 uncomfortably close to your pillow ?
Take this wool plucked from Leuconian4 blankets.
The marsh-reed, when cut up, is called circus-stuffing, and is what the poor man buys instead of Leuconian stuffing.
When fatigued, you may recline upon Amyclæan feathers, which the swan's inner coat provides for you.

A wheel must be protected (with a tire).
You make me a useful present.
It will be a hoop to children, but to me a tire for my wheel.

Rise;
the baker is already selling breakfasts to the chil­ dren ;
and the crested birds of dawn are crowing on all sidesWHEN asked what are my employments while living in the country, I answer briefly thus:
At dawn I address my prayer to the gods;
I visit my slaves and my fields, and allot to my people each his due portion of work.
Then I read, and invoke Phœbus, and solicit the Muses.
Next I anoint myself with olive oil, and take gentle exercise in the palæstra;
at peace in mind, and free from interest-bearing debts.
Then I dine, drink, sing, play, bathe, sup, and go to bed;
while my little lamp consumes its modicum of oil, and furnishes these trifles elaborated by the aid of the muses at night.
When to my farm retired, how I do live
If any ask, this short account I give:
The gods at the first light I do adore;
And place this care, all other cares before.
My grounds I visit then, and servants call, And their just tasks I do impose on all.
I study next, rouse my poetic vein, My body then anoint, and gently strain With some meet exercise;
exult in mind
At every turn, myself both free to find From crimes and debts:
last, I bathe, sup, laugh, drink Jest, sing, rest, and on all that passes, think.
A little lamp the while sends forth a ray, Which to my nightly studies makes a day.

Varus happened lately to ask me to supper;
the appoint­ ments were splendid, the supper itself was paltry.
The table was laden with golden dishes, not with meats ;
the servants placed before us plenty to delight the eye, but very little to satisfy the appetite.
I then observed:
" I came to feed, not my eyes, but my stomach ;
either place food before me, Varus, or take away your rich service.
"
Varus did lately me to supper call,
The table sumptuous was, the supper small;
Loaden it was with weight of gold, not meat;
Much to be seen was served, little to eat;
Varus, our mouths, not eyes, to feast we're here;
Take hence thy plate, or fill’t with better cheer.
Anon. 1695With lace bedizen'd comes her man,

With your voice, Ponticus, you could have moved adamant, it sounds sweetly, Ponticus, you are a sweet man.
Thus is it you deceive others, Ponticus, thus it is you deceive even yourself.
Will you have me say the truth, Ponticus P You are no man at all.
You are pleasing, when felt;
you are pleasing, when heard;
if not seen, you are altogether pleasing;
if seen, you please in no way whatever.

He is hungry and thirsty, though surrounded with gold and clad in stately robes of purple, he is nevertheless hungry and thirsty.

I now know, Gallus, why you avoid the society of ladies, your purse is full of wind, not of coin.
But if your flesh does not sin, your mind, my friend, defiles itself;
your de­ votion to the pleasures of the table is sufficient to con­ vict you of want of self-control.
Your stomach, I sup­ pose, has resolved to empty your purse ;
under its influence you will always be a poor man.
Yet in this way, Gallus, you may certainly secure peaceful slumbers, and set thieves at defiance.
Your stomach takes care of all your money.
You have a horse that wants barley, Glaucus, a slave that wants clothes, and a house that wants a broom.
Your hack is dirty and thin, and your servants' bones are stiff;
