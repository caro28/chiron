MADAM, I BEG leave to return all imagin­ able thanks to your Ladyship, for permitting me to adorn, with your illuftrious name, the enduing translation, made by two young per­ sons, whole happinefs is of infinite concern to me;
and who present their their most humble duty, and most profound respects to your Ladyship.
I was particularly encouraged to request this great honour, from a reflection, that your noble progeni­ tors, while they fignalized them­ felves, both in the cabinet and in the field, indulged the most ge­ nerous protection to the Mufes.
On this occafion, the late Dutchefs of Somerset, your Ladyship's mo­ ther, shines with peculiar lustre:
Her Grace having been not only a most bountiful patroness to every genius:
But alfo infpiring them to excel, by by the models she herfelf produced for their imitation.
The Greek original was written a great many centuries ago, and found but of late years.
Being an elegant performance, it is prefumed that it may prove a subject of cu­ riofity to people of taRe;
and give them as much pleasure, as would the discovery of a beautiful antique flatue, or a groop of figure.
It is well known, that the Greeks are the most perfect fources, of all things great and excellent, in every fpecies Species of literature, and the polite arts.
The word ROMANCE, is apt to prejudice many againft all works under that title;
as supposing them to be a meer rhapfody of incredible events;
treating of puerile loves, and written in an inflated and unna­ tural style.
But the present offering has much the appearance of a true story;
it containing a great variety of incidents, all well prepared ;
and very artfully interwoven;
with scarce any thing improbable or improper;
and and the whole drawn up with a gra­ vity of ftile becoming an hiftorian.
Chæreas and Callirrhoe are extreme­ ly unfortunate, but then they are virtuous :
Circumftances which muft endear their characters to a perfon of the COUNTESS of NORTHUMBER­ LAND'S distinguished humanity.
Your Ladyship, after having add­ ed radiance to a court, and been the delight of one kingdom, will loon accompany your noble LORD to another:
the government where­ of, our gracious SOVEREIGN has conferred on him;
and thereby given given a conspicuous proof, of his royal regard and attention to the happinefs of Ireland.
How glo­ rious an opportunity now offers, for his EXCELLENCY to immortalize himfelf;
by continuing the exercife of the moft exalted of all passions, (a passion fo familiar to him) that of DOING GOOD!
How vastly extensive will be his circle on that auguft occasion !
Methinks I hear the people of Ireland blessing his delegated fway;
and praying, that he might preside over them, for ever.
But as this would be impossible, me­ thinks I fee them attending his de­ parture, parture, from them, with fighs;
imploring Heaven to grant him a prosperous voyage, and a fpeedy re­ turn.
-What tranfports muft your Ladyship feel, when sharing all there true, thefe permanent honours with a confort, who fo juslly merits the nobleft a grateful people could be­ ftow !
The idea is exceedingly delight­ ful to my felf;
as is every thing which adds felicity and fplendor to the houfe of NORTHUMBERLAND:
and that it may continue with glory, to to the lateR:
ages, is the unfeigned wish of, Madam, Your Ladyship's most humble, most obedient, most devoted Servant,The EDITOR.
I CHARITON of Aphrodifios, A­ manuenfis to Athenagoras the Rhe­ torician, will relate the Love ad­ adventures of two Syracusians.
—Hermocra­ tes, prætor of Syracufe, he who conquered the Athenians, had a daughter, Callirrhoe by name;
a wonderful maiden, and the or- nament nament of all Sicily.
Her exquifite beauty did not referable that of a mortal, of a Ne­ reid, or of a mountain-nymph;
but ibone lovely as that of Venus, when in her virgin state.
The fame of Callirrhoe's peerless charms fpread far around;
fo that not only the fons of many Sicilian princes, as well as private gentlemen;
but also a multitude of others, from Italy, Epirus, and from all the adjacent iflands, came to pay their court to her.
The God of love having assembled thefe fuitors, gave here a fignal proof of his mighty power :
for there was a moft engaging youth, named Chæreas, who, as Achilles is described in Homer, or, like Alcibiades, surpassed all other men in beauty.
Ariston, his father, was next in rank at Syracufe to Hermocrates.
'An obstinate hatred, arising from the administration of affairs, had long fobfifted between them;
whence they opposed cach other on every occasion, both- public and pri­ private.
Cupid, who delights in novelty;
and whore greater pleasure is the working of miracles, fought for an opportunity like to that which follows.
It was the festival of Ve­ nus, at which feafon all the youths of both fexes went to the temple.
The procession being ended, Callirrhoe came out from the fane;
when the people would have adored her as a goddess.
Chæreas having left the Gymnasium, or school of bodily exercifes, 'rent, bright as a star, into the temple.
His vigorous exertions had added beauty to his limbs;
and raCy health glowed in his countenance *.
Now it happened, that Chæreas and Callirrhoe came to the fame part of the temple, the son of Venus having ordained this meeting ;
and as this goddefs had projected an amour, their hearts were reciprocally inflamed.
Chæreas re­ returned home, deeply wounded, but man­ fully concealed the conquer made over him;
lie appearing ashamed of his weakness.
But the maiden, prostrating herself at the feet of Venus, and kissing them, cried thus :
—Ah!
why didst thou bring fo lovely a youth before mine eyes in thy fane ?
Their affection increasing, it tortured them exceedingly;
when night coming on, Callirrhoe blufhed at the thoughts of her having difclofed her paf­ sion;
and Chæreas, though pining with love, had yet resolution enough to confefs to his parents, that he was deeply Smitten;
and that were not Callirrhoe given to him in marriage, it would be impoffible for him to live.
Ari­ ston, his father, venting a deep figh, faid to him:
-O L my son, thou art an undone youth;
since it is certain, that Hermocrates will never bellow his only daughter on thee;
when there are fo many fuitors, fo greatly thy superiors superiors both in rank and power.
This ought not to be even attempted, except thou wouldeft chufe to become the object of public ridicule.
In this manner did Arisen en­ deavour to confole his son, whore malady in­ creased daily;
infomuch that he discontinued his accustomed exercises and amufements.
The Gymnasium was very near become a de­ fart, for want of Chæreas;
all the young people being very fond of him.
On making a strict enquiry, they discovered the caufe of his malady;
and all were moved to pity, on reflecting that fo lovely a youth was in danger of lofing his life through fo noble a passion.
It was one of thofe Hated days on which the people ufed to assemble;
who being feated, they made this first and most ardent requeft, crying aloud Excellent Hermocrates!
mighty captain!
fave!
O rave Chæreas !
This will be thy moft illustrious trophy.-
The whole city demands thefe nuptials, worthy of both Para parties.--.!--
Who could duly describe this assembly, summoned together, and difpofed by Cupid ?
Hermocrates having the warmer affection for his fellow citizens, could not re­ fuse their petition, fo earnestly implored;
and he, having complied with their request, all the people, rifing up on a Sudden in the theatre, the young men flew to Chæreas ;
and the senators, with the chief magistrate, follow­ ed Hermocrates.
The Syracufian women came likewise in crouds, to conduct Callirrhoe to the bridegroom's houfe.
Every quarter of the city refounded with Epithalamiums.
The squares and streets were filled with chaplets and lighted torches.
Ointments and wine were poured on the thresholds ;
and the Sy­ racusians were more joyful this day, than on that when they triumphed over the Athenians.
The virgin, being ignorant of all thefe mat­ ters, lay in bed fadly weeping, fient, and her head veiled.
The nurfe approaching her, faid — said:
-Arise, my child;
!
this is the day more ardently wished for, by us, than any other.
The city bestows thee in marriage.
-Instantly,
Her heart, her knees, were with a trembling seiz'd :
Callirrhoe not knowing to whom she was to be efpoufed.
She was immediately struck fpeechlefs;
her eyes were veiled in darkness;
and she almoft died away, which was con­ fidered by the spectators as the effect of mo­ desty.
But fo foon as her waiting-maids had dressed and adorned her;
the parents, leav­ ing the croud at the door, introduced, the bridegroom to the bride.
Chæreas flying to the virgin, gave her a thoufand kisses :
when Callirrhoe perceiving him to be the man the loved, shone forth with greater beauty ;
as a lamp whore dying flame receives new fplendor by pouring in fresh oil.
When she after­ wards appeared in public, the multitude in gene­ general were feized with astonishment, and a Sacred kind of horror;
like as when Diana is fuddenly perceived by the hunters, in the deep Solitude of a foreft.
Many then pre­ fent worshipped her;
and all being charmed with Chæreas, they pronounced Callirrhoe thrice happy.
In like manner, (according to the poets) were the nuptials of Thetis cele­ brated on mount Pelion.
Nevertheless fome envious Deity intruded here ;
as it is related, that Difcord was prefent at that marriage.
II.
For the various suitors, being thus baulked in their expectations, were fired with grief and rage.
Though they had hitherto been enemies, they now joined as friends ;
and, upon this union, each looking upon himself as injured, they met together.
Envy prompted them to make war on Chæreas :
when a certain Italian youth, fon to the prince of Rhegium, rising first, fpake thus ,-Had any of of us obtained Callirrhoe;
it would not have raifed my indignation;
as one of the cam-.
batants, in the Gymnastic exercifes, mull ne­ cessarily bear away the prize.
But for us to be fupplanted, by a man who never under­ went the least fatigue, in order to win Cal­ lirrhoe, is an infult I can no ways brook.
We were amufed, were incessantly on the watch at her door;
were careffing her nurfes and waiting-maids ;
and making rich presents to her other attendants.
How long have we been her Haves !
but the word circumstance is, the hatred which it has excited among us, who are rivals.
Who cart bear the thoughts that a pathic, a beggar, a worthless wretch, should be the conqueror ;
at a time when princes contended for the victory ?
ani that he, without even risking the dangers of battle, should bear away the prize ?
Yet Chareas shall not reap any advantage from it;
and this marriage shall prove fatal to him.
The whole whole assembly applauded this speech, (the prince of Agrigentum excepted) who object­ ed to the proposal;
but this not out of re­ gard to Chæreas.
I differ (faid he) from you in opinion, with respect to what is now offered ;
but will lay before you a much fafer plan.
Call to mind that Hermocrates, being very powerful, is not to be contemned;
and therefore, should you attack him openly, it will be to no purpose.
We had better have recourse to ftratagem ;
for even a principality is won by artifice fooner than by violence.
Elect me, unanimoufly, your captain, in the war you are now declaring against Chæreas ;
and I will engage to dissolve this marriage.
J wilt inflame his breaft with jealoufy ;
which being enforced by love, will excite him to revenge this injury.
Callirrhoe poUcHes great strength of mind ;
and is free from evil fuf­ picions:
but as Chæreas was brought up in the Gymnafium, and consequently is, no stranger to to the wild sallies of youth ;
he may eafiJy (his fufpicion being raifed) be fired with jea­ lousy, fo natural to young men.
Nor will it be difficult to get accefs, or to fpeak to him.—
Scarce had he finished his harangue, when the unanimous voice of the assembly declared, how greatly they approved of his propofal.
They thereupon left the whole management of the affair to this prince ;
thinking him per­ fectly well qualified to execute the most wily enterprize.
He thereupon put his plan in execution in manner following.in.
One evening, a messenger brought word to Chæreas, that Arisen his father, then at his country feat, had fallen down flairs ;
and that there were little hopes of his life.
The instant Chaereas heard this news, though he was extremely fond of his father, he yet re­ gretted his being obliged to go alone;
as he could not yet, with decency, take his bride with with him.
No one had had the boldnefs to bring openly before the nuptial houfe, the * riotous banquet that night;
but the wooers coming thither privately, left behind them the indications of fuch banquet.
They adorned the doors with chaplets, and poured oint­ ments.
Libations of wine flowed along the ground ;
and torches, half burnt, were feat­ tered about.
Day light being returned, every one who passed by stopt ;
agreeably to the illaudable curiosity of mankind, ever fond of prying into the affairs of others.
Chæreas finding his father Somewhat recovered, went back to Callirhoe with the utmost speed.
And now, feeing a vail croud of people at the door, he was all amazement at firft ;
but being told the caufe, he rufhed forward like like one distracted.
Finding the chamber­ door shut, he knocked violently;
upon which the Servant let him in.
Flying inflantly to Callirrhoe, his indignation softened into grief;
when tearing his garments, he wept bitterly.
Being afked what misfortune had befallen him, he remained speechless;
for it was not in his power to disbelieve his eyes;
though he yet was unwilling to credit what was fo repug­ nant to his defires.
While he continued thus perplexed, and trembled in every limb, Callirrhoe, who knew nothing of what had happened;
humbly besought him to tell her what it was that offended him.
To this he replied, (his eyes darting fire) and being grieved to the foul at the fuppofed transactions of the past night.-
I bewail, (faid he) my unhappiness in reflecting, that so fhort a fpace of time should have blotted me from thy memory :
——and then reproached her with the nocturnal rioting.
But Callirrhoe, exasperated at so unjust an accufation, thus answered, with a fpirit becoming the daugh­ ter of the proctor :
No one has feared before my father's houfe this night.
This door may, very poffibly, be accustomed to fuch kind of revelry;
and thy marrying me, is a mortal wound to thy rivals Saying this, she turned from him ;
and drawing her veil over her face, wept bitterly.
But lovers are eafily reconciled $ and willingly admit of their mutual excufes.
Chaereas's foul being then foftened, he tenderly embraced his bride, who was presently fatisfied with his repentance.
Thefe difputes ferved only to increafe their passion :
and both their parents thought them­ felves fupremely happy, in finding fuch con­ cord between their children.
IV.
But now the prince of Agrigentum having failed in his firft stratagem, refolved to to put in execution a still deeper plot.
He had, among his dependants, a parasite of a facetious disposition, and possessed of every winning grace.
The prince ordered this man to act the lover.
And now this latter, mak­ ing his addresses to Callirrhoe's firft waiting.
woman, he, by his passionate and repeated intreaties, stole insensibly into her heart.
It was indeed with very great difficulty that he could prevail on her to listen to him;
but the, at -lift, was gained by presents;
and by his protesting, that he would certainly hang him­ felf, in cafe the did not indulge his ardent wishes.
A woman is easily won by a man whom she fuppofes to be fond of her.
Mat­ ters being thus prepared, the author of this project fixed on another actor, who, though not so handfome as the parafite, was master of the deepest cunning;
and of fo fmooth and subtle a tongue, that his fimulated can­ dor gained him the confidence of every hearer.
Having Having instructed this perfon previously in all he was to fay or do;
he fent him, (though not known) to Chæreas, whom he met walk­ ing at leifure, about the Palæstra, or place for bodily exercifes, when the man in question thus accosted him.
—I once had a fon of your age;
who, so long as he lived, greatly ad­ mired and efteemed you.
Now he being dead, I look upon you as my offspring :
and fo excellent is your conduct, that I confider you as a common good to Sicily.
Give me then your whole attention, and I will inform you of things of the utmoft importance to your future life.
This wretch having, by his artful Speeches, excited in Chæreas the various paffions of hope and fear, toge­ ther with a violent curiosity ;
Chæreas, COIl­ juring him to proceed, he shuffled ;
and Scarce a word more could be got from him;
be faying, in faultering accents:
That this was not a proper time;
the business he was a come come upon requiring a conference, and more leisure -Hereupon Chæreas grew more preying;
he expecting to hear fome vastly dis­ agreeable particulars.
And now this vile sy­ cophant taking him by the hand, led him to a folitary place;
when knitting his brows, and affecting an air of borrow, he shed a few tears, saying :
——
Oh!
Chæreas, it is with the utmost reluaance I disclose to you a most deteftable affair, which I long attempted to.
reveal;
yet could not, till now, prevail upon myself to break it to you.
But since you are publickly laughed at, and your misfortune is become the topic of every conversation;
I having a natural antipathy to vice, and the highest regard for you, could be silent no longer.
Know then, that your wife is false to you ;
and if you will not believe me, I am ready to fet the adulterer, and the abominable fcene, before your eyes.
He Hespake:
when sudden a dark cloud of grief O’erspread fad Chæreas’ cheek ;
who scooping up, With both his hands, black ashes;
o'er his bead Hesprinkledthem, and quite dorm’d hisface.
He then lay motionlefs for a considerable time, being unable to lift up his head or his eyes.
But having recovered (not his natural voice, but one weak and faint;
) he faid :
—I im­ plore of thee a shocking favour, which is, to make me an eye-witnefs to mine own wretch­ ednefs.
Set before me, the adulterer, in what manner foever thou mayeft think fit;
in order that I may have a more just reafon to By this place;
for, as to Callirrhoe, though the fhould have injured me, by violating her nuptial vow, I yet would forgive her.
The other re­ plied :
—Pretend Pretend that you are going into the country.
About mid-night be upon the waich at your own houfe, and you will fee the adul­ adulterer enter it.
-Matters being thus fettled.
Chæreas, unable to bear the prefence of Cal­ lirrhoe, fent her word, that he was going out of town.
In the mean time this disturber of harmony, this black villain, prepared every thing for his abominable purpose.
Night being come, Chæreas went to his post ;
while the man who had corrupted Callirrhoe's waiting woman, hid himfelf in a narrow paf­ sage;
acting as one, who attempting a dark work, endeavoured to conceal himfelf;
though, at the fame time he did all he could to be feen.
The ringlets of his hair shone, they being perfumed with fragrant ointments ;
his eyes were painted;
his garments gay and effeminate, and his pumps thin.
As his weighty rings were deep in colour, they glittered on his fingers, though it was dark.
Looking then very carefully round, he drew near the door ;
and knocking gently, gave the the usual fignal.
The waiting woman, who­ also was fearful, opened the door Softly;
when taking turn by the hand, she led him into the houfc.
Chæreas feeing this, could no longer retrain his fury;
but ran to stab the adulterer in the act.
The latter, after standing a little at the entry- door, disappear­ ed.
Callirrhoe was fitting on the bed-fide, wifhing for her Chæreas ;
and so deep was her melancholy, that she had not even permitted her lamp to be lighted.
At the found of feet, she heard her hufband breathe;
and thereupon flew joyfully to meet him.
Chæ­ reas had now no voice left to upbraid her;
but being overcome by rage, he, as she ap­ proached him, gave her an unhappy blow with his heel on the stomach;
which stopping her breath, she fell on the floor, and was carried to bed by the fervants.
Callirrhoe lying thus fetched out, and speechless, was sup­ supposed to be dead by every one who Jaw her.V. Fame, that Speedy messenger, soon spread the news of this fad diMer over the whole city.
Sighs and wailings echoed from street to street, till they reached the fea- shore.
The lamentations were as great, and as universal, as if the city had been taken by the enemy.
Chæreas,
Hill fired with anger, shut himfelf up;
and, during the whole night, put his female fervants to the torture, by fire and fword.
Callirrhoe's waiting-woman was the first and last who suffered on this occasion;
and, by this means, he finally extorted the truth;
when being moved to companion, for his (imagined) dear, deceafed bride ;
he would have killed himfelf, had he not been prevented by Poly­ charmus his bofom friend;
fuch as Homer describes Patroclus to have been with regard to to Achilles.
Next morning the chief magi­ crates arraigned the fuppofed murtherer;
they being refolved to prosecute Chæreas, out of respect to Hermocrates.
The populace ran in crouds to the public Square, or court of justice;
and were greatly divided in opi­ nion ;
fome crying one thing, fome another.
The difappointed fuitors inflamed them;
and especially the prince of Agrigentum, who stalking up and down, felt a fecret pride, at his having accomplished a defign, which every one else would have thought impracticable.
Now there happened an incident, till then unheard of in a court of justice ;
which was, that the indictment being read, the culprit, to whom a certain time was allowed for making his defence;
instead of pleading Not guilty, accused himself very Wrongly;
and was the first to pronounce his own condemna­ tion.
He did not even alledge any thing to alleviate alleviate the charge;
neither calumny, jea­ loufy, nor accident;
but fpake thus to the people:
Stone me, (I befeech ye!) with your own hands, by a public decree.
I have bereaved the people of their crown, their glory ;
and it would be treating me with too much lenity, should I be delivered over to the executioner.
I mull:
have deferved the most cruel punishment, had I only killed a she-slave of Hermocrates.
Invent then some new kind of torture;
for I have been guilty of a crime worfe than facrilege or parricide.
Do not give me burial;
let not the earth be polluted with my impious body, but throw it into the sea.
—These words were no fooner uttered, than a general moan broke forth;
and the whole assembly, forgetting the de­ ceased, testified the utmoft grief for the fur­ vivor.
Hermocrates was the firft who de­ fended Chæreas.—
I know (faid he) that tht the blow must have been involuntary.
I ob­ serve yonder fome people who arelayingsnares for us;
but they shall not have the satisfac­ lion to fee two funerals;
nor will I heighten the affliction of my deceased daughter, whom I have often heard declare, that Chæreas’s life was dearer to her than her own.
Let us then give over this needless trial, and go and prepare the requisite obfequies.
Let us not permit the corps of Callirrhoe to be preyed upon by time;
as this would lessen her beauty.
Let us lay her in the sepulchre, while thus lovely.
—The judges thereupon pronounced him not guilty.
VI.
But Chæreas could by no means discul­ pate himfelf;
on the contrary, being desi­ rous of dying, he fought every method to put an end to his life.
Polycharmus finding that there was.
but one way left to fave him, fpake fpake thus
Thou traitor to thy wife !
wilt thou not live till thou fhalt have paid the laft honours due to her memory ?
and wilt thou truft her body to orange hands ?
Now is the time for thee to attend to the sepulchral rites, and to Solemnize them with royal splen­ dor.
—These words having made an impref­ lion on Chæreas;
he exerted his utmoft en­ deavours, in order to haften the interment.
But what pencil could draw, in its due co­ lours, this magnificent funeral?
Callirrhoe Jay extended, in her bridal robes, on a bed of folid gold.
She appeared more charming than ever;
and all the spectators compared her to the lleeping Ariadne.
Firft marched the Syracufian cavalry;
themfelves and their horfes richly caparifoned;
and they preced­ ed immediately the bier.
Then followed the infantry, bearing the trophies of the victo­ lies gained by Hermocrates.
Next came the senate ;
senate;
and afterwards Hermocrates furround­ ed by thousands of people.
Arisen was car­ ried, though in a very languishing condi­ tion ;
he often calling Callirrhoe, his daughter and mistress.
Then proceeded the wives of the citizens in fable vestments.
Next were feen the sepulchral riches, all of them worthy of kings ;
the first of which was Callirrhoe's dower, in gold and filver:
then exquisitely beautiful garments, and other female orna­ ments;
and Hermocrates had fent thither many of the enemy's fpoils.
Here likewise were fecn the presents made by her relations and friends;
lastly, came the wealth of Cho­ reas, who would gladly have burnt his whole possessions with Callirrhoe's body.
The bier or bed was carried by Syracusian youths;
and the proceffion was clofed by a promifcuous multitude of people;
among whom Chæreas was heard to vent the most bitter wrailings.
Near
Near the fea-fhore flood a magnificent fepul­ chre, belonging to Hermocrates;
which was plainly feen at a great distance by thofe who were out at fea.
Such vaft wealth was brought to this Mausolæum, that when the whole was deported therein, it feemed a treasury.
But now the honours which were thus paid to the deceased Callirrhoe, gave rife to inci­ dents of a more extraordinary nature.
VII.
There was a certain pyra'e, a wicked man, Theron by name, who frequented the seas from an unjust Spirit of gain ;
and who kept many watchful spies about the ports.
This man had a band of pyrates always ready at hand, under the title of a Society of pilots.
Theron, having been present at the inter­ ment, call a wishful eye on the riches of it ;
and at night, when in bed, he could not sleep for thinking on them;
he saying thus to to himself:
—Shall I live in perpetual danger;
struggling for ever with the waves, and mur­ thering the living for a meer pittance;
when I now have an opportunity of making my fortune, by one dead person ?
I mutt make an attempt.
This booty shall not efcape me.
Whom then shall I make choice of for my companions, on this occasion ?
Consider well, (Theron) among thy brave fellows, who is fit for this enter prize.
Zenophanes of Thu­ rium is sagacious, but then he is fearful.
Meno of Messene is bold, but treacherous.—
Thus did he run over, in imagination, all the pyrates;
weighing their respective abilities, in like manner as a banker does his money ;
rejecting many pieces ;
but, at laft, approv­ ing fome as fit for his purpose.
Early next morning, he ran from the ship to the port, to feek for them fingly:
when he found part
At the brothel, and others at the tavern ;
all fit fit comrades for fuch a captain.
Then say­ ing, that he had fame necessary bufinefs to, communicate ;
he took them behind the har­ bour, and fpake thus :
—I, having found a treafure, have chofen you to share it with me;
it being too great a booty for one man.
The acquiring it will not cost you much pains;
and one night’s work may enrich us all.
We are not unacquainted with certain arts, which, though held in defecation by fools, are yet found of the higher utility to men of judgment.
The pyrates, immedi­ ately fuppofing that he hinted at a robbery ;
the breaking into a sepulchre, or fome fa­ crilegious act, cried ;
-there need no more arguments;
what you have faid is sufficient.
Only point out the affair, and let us not lofe time.
Theron, continued thus:
You faw the gold and filver which belonged to the deceased Callirrhoe ;
but surely we, who are are living, have a more just title to it.
Hence I am refolved to break open the Mausolæum this night;
then, feizing the treafure, we will put it on board a vessel;
and afterwards fail to what ever foreign country the winds may drive us, and there fell the cargo.
This propofal meeting with universal ap­ plause, their captain said:
Return now to your rendezvous, and your ufual occupa­ tions, and at midnight go all on board the vessel;
every one taking the proper tools, with whatever elfe may be necessary:
and they did fo.VIlI.
Callirrhoe, in the mean time, received a fecond birth, as it were ;
for her breath having not quite left her, the found fome fymptoms of hunger ;
and revived by insen­ fible degrees.
She afterwards began to move in every limb;
when opening her eyes, Ohe per­ perceived a fenfation like to that felt by per­ sons, juft waking from a deep sleep;
when imagining Chæreas to lay by her, she called him by his name.
But as neither her huf­ band, nor her waiting-women, heard her;
and all was solitude and darknefs, she, tremb­ ling like an afpen leaf, was Seized with hor­ ror ;
being quite unable to conjecture where she was.
Having raised herself with difficul­ ty, she felt gently the coronets and fillets, which, by their tinkling, feemed of gold and silver.
There also was a vaft heap of aro­ matics, on and about the bier, which called to her remembrance the sad blow the had re­ ceived ;
and how the fainted away.
CaJlir­ rhoe, recovering from her trance, and being grieved to the foul, now found the was in a sepulchre.
She thereupon screamed, as loud as poffible :
— Alas !
I am buried alive.
Help, 0 help me !
But not receiving any benefit benefit from her repeated moans, the quite defpaired of succour;
when reclining her head on her knees, she thus broke forth into lamenta­ tions.
Ah !
wretched Cure am I, to be thus interred alive, when guilty of no crime;
and to die of a dreadfully-lingering death!
I am in health, while my fad relations are be­ wailing my loss.
How will it be possible for me to inform them, that I still live !
0 unjuft Chæreas!
I do not accufe thee, for having attempted to kill me ;
but becaufe thou didft drive me away fo fuddenly out of thy houfe.
Thou shouldest not have buried Callirrhoe so hastily, she not being really dead ;
but thou art, perhaps, already thinking of another bride.
IX.
Now while she thus vented her grief in the most doleful accents;
Theron, finding it was midnight, advanced towards the Mau­ solæum, solæum, without making the least noise;
the oars, for that purpofe, lightly skimming the waves.
His men then going ashore, be sta­ tioned them in manner following.
He font out four, to fpy if any perfons came near to the sepulchre;
with orders to kill them :
but in cafe this was not practicable, then to make known, by a signal agreed among themselves, that such persons were approaching.
Theron himself (being the fifth) went towards the tomb.
The rest (they being fixteen in all) were commanded to remain on board the vef­ fel, and to hold their oars in readinefs ;
in order that they, in cafe of any sudden acci­ dent, might immediately carry off thofe who were on flere, and fail away.
Callirrhoe, now hearing them at work with their iron crows ;
and a mighty stroke burfling open the sepulchre;
her foul was instantly feized with the various passions of fear, joy, grief, sur­ fut prize, hope and distrust.
—From whence (faid she to herfelf) can this noife proceed ?
Perhaps fome infernal spirit, purfuant to the law enjoyned the dead, is come to vifit wretch­ ed me.
This is not a meer noife, but the shrill voice of fome daemon, which calls me hence;
or it is rather a noife made by thieves, who are forcing open the Maufolæm ;
for, to add to my mifery, I was buried here with riches which can be of no- ufe to the dead.—
While Callirrhoe was ruminating on thefe things, one of the pyrates thruft forward his head;
and, at laft, got in his whole body.
And now Callirrhoe, falling on her knees, would have implored his compassion ;
but the robber, greatly terrified, leaped back again ;
and, with trembling accents, faid to his com­ panions :
Let us fly this place;
for fome genius guards the treasures here entombed, and will not permit us to enter.
—
—Theron laugh­ laughing, called him coward;
and faid :
Thou art as lifeless as the dead woman!
He thereupon commanded another to go in ;
but as none of them had courage to do this, he himfelf rushed in, with his drawn sword, the glitter of which made Callirrhoe afraid the should be murthered ;
when linking to the ground, in a corner, she, with a low voice, thus conjured him:
Whoever thou art, bestow that pity on me, which I have not met with either from my husband, or from j my parents.
Do not kill a woman whom thou hast rather saved.
—Theron fummoned up all his fpirits;
and being naturally Saga­ cious, and of great pretence of mind, he im­ mediately guessed the whole affair.
But he was doubtful, at firft, whether it would not be beft for him to kill Callirrhoe ;
as the pre­ ferving of her life might be an obstacle to every part of his enterprize.
However, views of of interest foon made him change his mind, when he fpake thus to himfelf:
Let this woman form part of the sepulchral riches.
Great treafures, of gold and filver, are here buried ;
but the beauty of this female is more precious than them all.
Then taking Cal­ lirrhoe by the hand, he led her forth;
and-calling to his companion:
Behold, (faid he) the genius who to greatly alarmed you.
A fine pyrate, indeed, to be afraid of a woman !
Do you then take her in charge, for I will restore her to her parents.
Let us­ carry off the Several articles here deposited;
they being no longer guarded by a dead woman.X.
After they had loaded the vessel with the fpoils, Theron ordered him, who had the care of Callirrhoe, to retire with her at fome little diftance.
They then held a conference with with regard to her;
and were greatly divided in opinion.
The first saying:
—O my com­ panions !
we came hither with quite different views;
and the booty which fortune has thrown in our way, far exceeds our most fan­ guine expectations.
Let us make a proper ufe of it:
becaufe it is in our power, fpite of what we have done, to come off with impu­ nity.
I therefore think that it will be bell for us to leave every article, in the Mauso­ læum, as we found it;
and restore Callirrhoe to her hufband, and to her father.
We then may declare that, pursuant to the custom of fishermen, we ran our vessel ashore near to the sepulchre ;
and that having heard a voice, humanity prompted us to break open the tomb;
to preserve the life of the perfon who was shut up in it.
Let us compel the wo­ man, by an oath, to bear testimony to all we have done ;
to which she will readily con- rent, Cent, out of gratitude to us her benefactors, who snatched her from the jaws of death.
What joy shall we then Spread through all Sicily?
What a number of rich prefents shall we receive ?
Consider that, in doing this, we shall act justly with regard to men, and pi­ oufly with respect to the gods.
He had no sooner ended, but another contradicted him faying :
What a troublesome fool art thou !
Is this a time to moralize ?
Doll:
thou imagine, that our having broke open a fe­ pulchre has improved our honefty ?
And Shall we have mercy on a woman whofe hufband, to far from being moved to pity, attempted to kill her ?
You will fay, that she has not done us any injury:
True:
but this would be doing ourselves an infinitely great one.
In the firft place, fhould we restore the woman to her parents, it is uncertain what construction they might put upon that action ;
action;
and it would be impossible for them not to suspect the true motive of our going to the sepulchre.
But fuppofe her relations should be fo very generous as to forgive us;
yet the chief magnates, and the people, would not release men who had forced open a Mausolæum;
and brought from it, and boldly fet before their eyes, fo valuable a trea­ fare.
Possibly fume will fay;
that it were more profitable for us, to fell the woman, as her beauty may fetch a high price:
but this alfq would be dangerous :
for gold is dumb, and filver could not blab the place from whence we had it.
Farther :
in the latter cate, we might invent many fictions;
but how would it be possible for us to conceal a cargo, furnished with eyes, ears, and a tongue ?
Moreover, as Callirrhoe's charms are more than human;
did we say that (he is a slave, we should certainly be treated as impostors;
for what what person who beheld her, could believe that the had ever been in fuch an abject ftate ?
——Let us then kill her upon the spot;
and not carry our accuser up and down with us.
-Many contented to this proposal, but Theron objected to both :
—For, thou, faid he, (turning to the first) wouldest plunge us into imminent danger:
and thou (turning to the other) wouldeft bereave us of our profit.
I will Sooner difpofe of the woman than kill her;
because she, while felling, will be a­ fraid of discovering her quality :
but when fold, let her accufe us, if fhe pleafes;
as we then shall be far removed from her.
The life we lead is exposed to dangers.
Away then on board.
Let us fet fail, for day-light is at hand.
XI.
Hereupon they weighed anchor ;
and the weather being very fine, the ship foon got got into the main ;
where they had neither advert winds nor waves to contend with, the vessel not being bound to any particular port;
fo that every gale was favourable to them, and blew right a-stern.
Theron endeavoured to console the afflicted Callirrhoe, by employ­ ing every deceitful amusement in his power.
At the fame time (he guessed the evil he was meditating;
and did not doubt but that he intended to fell her.
However, she feigned not to fee through his villainy, but to believe all he faid;
the being afraid that he would murther her, should (he fhow the leaft disgust.
Thereupon, laying that (he was lick, the co­ vered her head ;
and weeping, fpake thus to herself:
——O my father !
Thou wert victo­ nous on this very sea, and didst destroy a fleet of Athenians consisting of three hundred ships;
and now that a vile galley robs thee of thy daughter, thou doll:
not fuccour her.
I am I am hurried away to a orange land:
and though of noble birth, mull become a Gave ;
and, perhaps, Come Athenian master may pur­ chafe the daughter of Hermocrates.
How much better had it been for me, to have re­ mained dead in the sepulchre !
My dearest Chæreas would surely, one day or other, have laid by my fide;
but now we are feparated, living and dead.
-—While Callirrhoe was thus bewailing her Mad fate, the pyrates passed by many inconsiderable issands ;
their cargo being a purchafe for the rich, not for poor people.
And now they took shelter under a bank, against which the rea beat, oppofite to Attica, and there cast anchor.
In this place was a copious Spring, whence a transparent rivulet flowed.
They then conducted Callirrhoe to a flowery meadow ;
and after she was washed, they requested her to be chearful, and to re­ cover herfelf a little from the fatigues of the ocean, ocean, they being very defirous to preserve her beauty.
And now the ruffians, consult­ ing together apart, with regard to the courfe they should fleer, one of them faid :
——We are near to Athens, a great and opulent city.
We shall there meet with a very considerable number of merchants and wealthy men ;
A­ thens being fo exceedingly populous, that the inhabitants of all other cities feem assem­ bled in it It was therefore the general opinion that they should fail for Athens.
But Theron objected to this;
the Athenians being naturally too curious and inquifitive for his purpofe.
You only (faid he) have not heard, how limply and impertinently they delight in prying into the affairs of other men.
They are a chattering people, and fond of wrangling.
Their ports are crowded with sharpers and informers.
Thefe will not fail to enquire who we are;
and how we came by this this cargo;
and they will certainly suspect fome evil defign.
We should immediately be examined by the Areopagus, and by the chief magistrates, more cruel even than ty­ rants.
The Syracusians are less to be dread­ ed than the Athenians.
Ionia is the country to anfwer our purpofe;
many of its inhabi­ tants being as wealthy as princes, by the riches they draw from upper Afia.
The Ionians are a very luxurious and indolent people, who hate law-fuits;
and I hope to meet with fame of my acquaintance among them.
——Having then taken in water, and got provifions out of certain trading vessels lying in the har­ bour ;
they failed directly for Miletus.
The third day they came to a bay, about eighty furlongs from the city;
a place formed by na­ ture as a Secure shelter for fhips.
Here The­ ron commanded them to lay up their oars ;
and throw up the most commodious houfe they they could for Callirrhoe;
he being resolved to treat her as voluptuoufly as poffible.
This behaviour did not arife from humanity, but from a thirst of gain;
he acting as a merchant, rather than as a pyrate.
XII.
Theron then hasted to the city, tak­ ing with him two of his trusly companions.
He would not feek publickly a purchaser, nor Spread abroad his intentions;
but endeavour­ ed to fell Callirrhoe privately, and for ready money.
However, he found it very difficult to do this.
She was too rich a purchase for many ;
and no inconsiderable person was able to buy her.
Her price could be paid only by there possessed of vast wealth, or by kings ;
but fuch Theron was afraid of, and therefore would not approach them.
Tired then with delay, he resolved to be no longer in suspence.
The night afforded him no sleep, he spake thus thus to himfelf:
——What a fool art thou, to have left without a guard, during fo many days, and in a folitary place, fuch great fums in gold and livet, as though thou Wert the only pyrate !
Knowest thou not, that there are other pyrates like thyfelf, who fcour the ocean and art thou fure that thine own peo­ ple will not abandon thee, and run away with the (hip ?
The companions thou haft made choice of, fo far from being honest, or likely to prove true to thee, are the moft wicked wretches thou art acquainted with.
Take therefore thy sleep, as nature now calls for repofe :
then, when morning approaches, fly to the ship, and throw this woman, who is now fo very incommodious, into the fea ;
and be no longer encumbered with a cargo, for which thou canst find fo few buyers.
—The­ ron then falling afleep, faw, in a dream, the door of the houfe shut against him;
which made made him resolve to flay in this place all that day -.
Not long after, being wrapt in thought, he fat himfelf down in a shop, great­ ly disturbed in mind.
In this situation, he perceived a long train of people, both free and bonds-men, passing by;
in the midft of whom was a middle aged man, clad in mourn­ ing, and with a most forrowful countenance.
At this fight, Theron rofe from his feat:
and with the curiosity natural to mankind, afked one of the attendants, who that perfon was ? ——
The attendant replied :
—— You Purely must be a foreigner, or returned from tome far-distant country, not to know Diony­ sius ;
the noblest, the richer, and the wifeft of all the Ionians;
and whom the great king king - ranks among his friends.
But why in a fable habit ?
Because he has loft his wife, whom he tenderly loved.
Theron was the more felicitous in his enquiries, as he had, at last, met with an opulent person, and a lover of women.
And now Theron would not permit this attendant to leave him ;
but afked what office he held under Dionyfius?—
The other replied :
———I aiD his chief slew­ ard ;
and intruded with the care of his in­ sant daughter, whofe hapless mother was thatched from her immaturcly.
Pray, what may be your name?
Theron.
——And yours ——Leonas.
How lucky am I (cried the former) 0 Leonas!
in meeting with you.
I am a merchant, and juli arrived from Italy ;
and to am wholly unacquainted with the af­ fairs of Ionia.
A lady of Sybaris, the richer in all that country, having a favourite waiting- Woman of exquisite beauty of whom fhe afterwards asterwards grew jealous, fold her to me.
Do you then be the gainer.
You may either keep her as a nurfe to the child (she having been extremely well educated) or oblige your Lord with her.
It will be to your advantage for him to purchase a bonds-woman;
fince this may prevent his bringing into your family, a mother-in-law to your infant charge.——
Leonas listened with great pleasure to this difcourfe ;
and faid :
-Surely fome propiti­ ous Deity rent you hither;
for you represent to me, in clear day-light, what I faw in a dream.
Come then to my houfe, and be my friend and my gueft.
After feeing the wo­ man, I shall be the better able to judge, whe­ ther fle will be worthy of my Lord, or only fit for me.
XIII.
When they were got home, Theron was struck with wonder, at the splendor of the furniture, and the fpacioufnefs of the palace;
palace;
which was prepared for the recep­ tion of the great king.
The first thing Leo­ nas did, was to defire Theron to wait for him, till he should have transacted fome bu­ finefs with his Lord.
He afterwards conduct­ ed him to his own apartments, which teemed every way fit for a gentleman.
He then gave orders for the table to be fpread ;
when The­ ron, being an artful man who could full himfelf to all times and circumstances, eat and drank very freely with Leonas, to pre­ vent his being suspected ;
and still more, to show how proud he should be of his friend­ ship.
While they were thus at dinner, they bad a long conference concerning the wo­ man.
Theron made greater encomiums on the beauties of her mind, than on thofe of her perfon;
well knowing, that what is not feen requires praife;
but that what we do fee, recommends itself.
—Come, (faid Leo­ nas) nas) let us go;
let me fee her.
She is not here, (replied the other) we having avoid­ ed the city for fear of the farmers of the customs ;
and our ship lies at anchor, eighty furlongs from hence.
—Theron then defcribed the place.
Your vessel (faid Leonas) is moored upon our estate.
—So much the better (replied the former) fortune having conduct­ ed us to Dionysius.
Let us therefore go into the country (added Leonas) in order that you may recover yourfelf, from the fatigues of the sea ;
for Dionyfius's noble Villa is near to where your ship lies.
Theron was great­ ly rejoiced at this ;
be imagining, that he should more eafily difpofe of his prize in a solitude, than in a public market.—
We will go. (faid he) early to-morrow morning;
you to the country feat, and I to the ship ;
whence I will bring the woman to you.
Mat­ ters being thus adjusted, they shook hands and apd parted.
The Succeeding night appear­ ed vaftly long to both ;
the one being eager to buy, the other to fell.
Next day Leonas, parting along the fea-coaft in a fmall vessel, arrived at the Villa ;
he having brought with him the money, in order to be ready for the merchant.
During this interval, Theron came unawares upon his companions, who were on the strand, and very impatient to fee him ;
when telling them his fuccefs, he em­ braced Callirrhoe, and fpake thus:
I in­ tended (my child !) to have restored you im­ mediately to your parents;
but contrary winds prevent my doing this.
You know the infinite care I have taken of you;
and above all, that I have not made the lead attempt on your chastity.
Chæreas will re­ ceive you from the sepulchre (you having been preserved by our means) as unviolated as on the bridal night.
We are now obliged to fail to to Lycia.
—But why afflict yourfelf to no pur­ pofe;
you who are fo lick at fea ?
I shall leave you here with fome faithful friends ;
and, at my return, will take you on board ;
'and conduct you to Syracufe, with the utmoft regard and attention.
Take then whatever you think fit, of your clothes and other things ;
and we will keep the rest for you.—
Callirrhoe now Smiled within herfelf, though her heart was oppressed with borrow.
She looked upon Theron as very filly, in imagin­ ing that the could believe him;
well know­ ing that she was fold.
Nevertheless she was to extremely defirous of being freed from the py­ rates, that she thought the should be more hap­ py, though a nave, than when free, and enjoy­ ing the fplendor of her birth.—O ! my father, (faid she) I return you a multitude of thanks, for your great humanity to me ;
and may the gods reward you all accordingly!
but to ac­ cept cept of any thing which was interred with me, I should look upon as an evil omen.
Do you therefore preserve them carefully for me.
All I would take, is a little ring, which was buried with me.
She then drew the veil over her face, faying:
Theron !
carry me whitherfoever you pleafe;
for any place would be preferable to the sepulchre, or to the fea.
XIV, As foon as Theron was got near to the Villa, he made ufe of the following arti­ fice.
Unveiling Callirrhoe, and untying her hair, fo that it flowed negligently over her (houlders ;
he then opened the door, and or­ dered her to enter first.
Leonas, and thofe in the room with him, feeing fo exquifite a beauty appear on a fudden, were all amaze­ ment.
Some thought that a goddefs flood before them, as Venus was strongly reported to to reveal herfelf, Sometimes, in thofe Chades.
All prefent were Seized with surprize ;
when Theron, following clofe behind, accosted Leonas with thefe words.
—Rise, and pre­ pare to receive the woman ;
for this is she whom thou art defirous to purchase. —
At this declaration the beholders were struck with joy and wonder.
Callirrhoe being then put to bed, in a moft fplendid room, they left her ;
grief, fatigue, and fear, calling for repofe.
Theron then taking Leonas by the hand, faid :
—I have acquitted myfelf faith- fully of all I promised.
Do you now take possession of the woman.
You furely are my friend.
Come to the city;
get a writing drawn;
and then give me what price you may think proper.
But Leonas being re­ solved to vie with him in courier faid :
—I will truft you with the money, before the instrument is executed ;
and thereu pon pressed him him to accept of the turn, left he fhould after­ wards go from the agreement;
Leonas know­ ing that many
In the city, would gladly pur­ chafe Callirrhoe.
Leonas now offering him a talent of filver, conjured him to take it ;
which the pyrate, with a multitude of words, pretended to refuse ;
but afterwards accepted, though feemingly with infinite reluctance.
Leonas intreated his guest to fup with him, as it was late;
but Theron faid :
I will fail for the city this very night:
and to mor­ row we will compleat the contract, in the port.
—The appointment being thus made, they feparated.
Theron being got on board his vessel, ordered his people to weigh an­ char ;
and fet fail with all poffible expedi­ lion, to prevent their being discovered.
Now while the pyrates were flying whithersoever the winds might carry them ;
Callirrhoe being left alone, and at full liberty to bewail her sad fad misfortunes, cried thus:
- Behold me now shut up, by Theron, in a sepulchre, still more lonely than the other:
for to that my father and mother would have come;
and Chaereas had bedewed it with his tears ;
of which, I, though dead *, fhould have been tenable.
But who can I here invoke ?
Thou knowest (0 envious Fortune !) that thou art not yet satisfied with perfecuting the wretch­ ed Callirrhoe, both by sea and land.
Firft, thou didft induce my lover to kill me.
That very Chæreas who never beat a flave, gave me, who loved him to distraction, a deadly blow.
Thou didst afterwards deliver me up to robbers of tombs;
and, from the Mausolæum, didft drag me to the ocean, where where I was under the yoke of pyrates, more tremendous than even the billows.
Was I then fo greatly celebrated for beauty, only that Theron, the pyrate, might receive an extraordinary price for it ?
I was fold in a folitary place ;
and not taken, like other things of that kind, to the city.
Thou didst fear (0 Fortune !) that had any one feen me, I fhould have been fuppofed a perfon of noble birth and liberal education.
For this I have been fold, like a mute ;
like a blind and in­ fenfible piece of furniture, to I know not whom:
whether to Greeks, to Barbarians, or again to pyrates, I cannot say.
Then beating her breaft, the faw, in her ring, the picture of her dear hufband;
when kissing it, the cried:
O my Chæreas !
Thpu art utterly lost, fince fo dire a cataftrophe has fevered us.
Thou now doll weep ;
doll re­ pent;
and fitteft in the empty monument;
doing doing juftice, after my death, to my virtue :
while I, the daughter of Hermocrates and thy wife, have this day been fold.
Amid there moanings, she, with great difficulty, fell asleep.
END OF THE FIRST BOOK.
THEI.
L EONAS having ordered Phocas, the deputy steward, to take all pos­ fible care of the woman;
he, though it was night, fet out for Miletus, with the utmost fpeed ;
being impatient to inform his Lord of the good news, with regard to the slave he he had purchased ;
and imagining that this might alleviate his grief.
Leonas found Dio­ nyfius in bed;
he being oppressed with fuch a variety of woe, that he could feldom be pre­ vailed upon to go abroad, though his coun­ try stood in great need of his advance.
On the contrary, he confined himself to the nup­ tial chamber, as if his wife had been there.
The moment he raw Leonas, he cried :
—
This has been the only pleafant night I have enjoyed, fince the death of my dear, haplefs wife;
for I faw her very vifibly, in a dream, more beautiful, more charming than ever ;
and she cohabited with me, as when awake.
Methought it was our nuptial day;
that I was conducing my bride home,.
through my grounds, along the beach ;
and that you was singing our Epithalamium.
Dionyfius had no fooner done fpeaking, than Leonas cried O my Lord!
Thou art fortunate both sleep­ ing ing and waking.
I will now interpret what thou haft feen :
upon which he began thus.
—I hap­ pened to meet with a merchant who had a female, of wonderful beauty, to difpofe of;
but he being afraid of.
the farmers of the customs, his people ran their vessel a shore at fome distance from the city, near to your estate.
Then the merchant and I went, ac­ cording to appointment, to the Villa ;
where fettling the conditions of fale, I gave him a talent of filver;
and am now come to exe­ cute the central pursuant to the laws.
Dionyfius listened, with great pleasure, to the inchanting picture which Leonas drew of this woman ;
he being a lover of the fair­ fex, except of fuch as were in bonds;
for having the spirit of a king, and being the firft man both in rank and knowlcge, of all Ionia, he fcorned to bed with a Have It is impossible, 0 Leonas !
(faid he) that any one one
Ihould be exquisitely handfome who is not born free *.
Haft thou not learnt, from the poets, that the offspring of the gods are beautiful;
and, still more fo, the children of perfons of rank.
This woman pleaded you in a Solitary place, while you compared her to the peasants round you.
However, as you have purchased her, go to the market;
and there Adraflus, who is perfectly well skilled in the laws, will draw up a proper in­ strument, and fee it executed.
—
Leonas was overjoyed that Dionyfius did not believe the account he gave of Callirrhoe ;
he imagining, that the fight of fuch unexpected beauty would strike him the more forcibly.
He then went to all the ports of Miletus ;
to every banker's;
and over the whole city;
yet no Theron could bp found.
He next enquired very very diligently (to as little purpose however) of the merchants, and ship-masters ;
but none of them knew any fuch perfon.
In this per­ plexity he took a galley, and rowing along the sea-coast, landed and went to the Villa ;
Hill unable to find the man he wanted, who, by this time, was roving over the ocean.
Hereupon Leonas returned flowly and de­ jected to his Lord, who perceiving the melancholy which overspread his counte­ nance, afked what had befallen him ?
The former replied :
O my Lord !
I have loft you a talent.
This misfortune (faid Dionyfius) will make you more cautious for the future.
But tell me what has happen­ ed ;
has not our new-bought slave made her efcape ?
—No, my Lord (answered Leonas) but he who fold her is fled.
This fellow (added Dionyfius) muft therefore be a man­ stealer, who having run away with fome- body's body's slave, thought it prudent to fell her to you, in an unfrequented place where were no witnesses.
—Of what country did he fay the is ?
Of Sybaris in Italy (answered Leonas ;
) to which he added, that he had pur­ chafed her of her jealous mistrefs.
Diony­ fius then ordered his fteward to enquire, if there were any Sybarites in the city;
bidding him leave, in the mean time, the woman at the Villa.
Leonas quitted the room with an air of forrow ;
imagining that he had not Succeeded in this bufinefs.
He nevertheless watched carefully for an, opportunity, to per­ fuade his Lord to go to his country-feat;
the only hopes now left him, being in Dionyfius's having a fight of Callirrhoe.
II.
In the mean time the country-women flocked to Callirrhoe, to whom they paid their duty;
and deemed as fond of her as if the had .
had been their mistress.
Plangon, wife to the under steward, being a fenfible woman, and who knew the world, thus addressed her :
-
My child!
You doubtless are in fearch of your parents and relations;
but be assured, t that.
you will find fuch here;
for Dionyfius, our Lord, is a good man, and of a most be­ nevolent difpofition.
God has moft propi­ tiously conduced you to an excellent family;
where you may live as happily as in your na­ tive country.
Wash therefore away the un­ cleanness contracted by your having been so long at fca.
The maids attend here for that purpose.——
Callirrhoe would fcarce confent to this;
fo that it was with much difficulty they got her to the bath.
The women enter­ ing, anointed, washed, and wiped her with the utmoft care.
When they faw her naked, they were infinitely more furprized.
Her face charmed them while she had her clothes on;
on ;
but now there were thrown afide, she appeared to them as a goddefs.
Rays of silver, like the refulgent lightning, feemed to dart from Callirrhoe's fnowy skin.
Her flesh was so vastly delicate, that they were afraid the most gentle touch of their fingers would hurt her, by making a deep impref­ sion ;
upon which they thus whifpered one another —Our late mistress was justly ce­ lebrated for her beauty ;
but she might have past for this woman's slave.
—
—These en­ comiums were very disgustful to Callirrhoe, who easily guessed what was to follow.
Thus lovely in their eyes, they bound up her di­ shevelled locks, and brought her fplendid veflments;
but she urged, that such finery did no ways fuit a newly-purchased slave.—
Give me (faid she) ruflic, fervile weeds, for you are my fuperiors.
Callirrhoe then put on mean attire 3 but even this became her;
it it appearing, now irradiated by her beauty, as a rich habit.
So fOOD as the women had dined, Plangon faid to her:
Now haste to Venus, and address her in prayer.
The goddefs reveals herself in this- country ;
and not only thofe in the neighbourhood, but alfo multitudes from the city, come and offer up sacrifices to her.
The goddefs has always been remarkably propitious to our master ;
who never passes by her shrine, without bow­ ing to it.
All the peasants present boafted the appearance of the goddefs;
when a wo­ man, of more Simplicity than the reft, cried :
-
Think that thou, in beholding Venus, wilt fee thine own image.
Callirrhoe, at there.
words, burst into tears, and thus whimpered herfelf:
Alas!
wretched creature that I am !
In this place likewise is Venus the caufe of all my woes.
I yet will go to her;
and having a thousand things to complain of, will a- expostulate with her The temple flood near the Villa, in the high-road.
Callirrhoe prostrating herself at the feet of the goddefs, and embracing them, cried:
Thou didst first prefent Chæreas to my eyes;
but, after having joined a lovely pair, didst feparate them ;
although we ever paid thee, with all poffible veneration, due homage.
But sincc thou hast thus ordained, I have one only boon to request, which is that, after Chaereas, I may pleafe no other man.—
At there words Venus made a sign in the Negative, fle being the mother of Cupid;
not to, mention that fhe had already meditated new Hymeneal bands, which also were to be dissolved.
Callirrhoe being freed from the dread of pyrates, and the dangers of the ocean, recovered her former beauty;
so that the peafants were much surprized at her daily-increafing charms.
III AndIII.
And now Leonas, finding a proper opportunity, fpake thus to Dionyfius :
My Lord, it is a long time fince you vidited your edtate on the dea-coadt, and your affairs require your presence.
It is necessary that you view and enquire into your herds and plantations ;
and you will please to recollect, that the feafon for reaping the corn, and ga­ thering the fruits, is at hand.
Occupy at laft, (my Lord) the houses which we, by your command, have built and furnished magni­ ficently.
Amufed by there various employ­ ments, and delighted with the rural beau­ ties round, you then will be the better able to fupport your late grievous lofs.
When­ ever you (hall think fit to praise fome herds­ man or shepherd, you then may give him the new Have in marriage.
—Dionysius was pleafed with this proposal;
and gave orders for fet­ ting out on a certain day.
Hereupon his coach- men men got ready the equipages, his grooms the hordes, and his mariners the barges.
His friends were invited to accompany him in the journey, as also his whole tribe of freedmen ;
Dionyfius being naturally fond of fplendor.
When every thing was ready, he ordered his attendants, with the baggage, to go by sea ;
and his coaches to follow him, after himfelf
Should be fet out;
as a vast retinue would no­ ways become one in mourning.
Next morning at day-break Dionyfius, unperceived by most of his Servants or the country people, mounted his horfe, accompanied by four friends, one of whom was Leonas ;
and then proceeded on the journey towards his Villa.
And now Cal­ lirrhoe having feen Venus the fame night, re­ folved to go and worship her.
At the time she was standing, and offering up her prayers in the temple, Dionyfius, alighting from his horfe, went in first.
Callirrhoe, hearing the found found of feet, turned towards Dionyfius, when he perceiving her, cried aloud :
—O Venus !
be propitious to me ;
and do now appear to me for my good.
Then going to fall pro­ strate before her, Leonas withheld him, fay­ ing :
Be not troubled :
This (my Lord) is the newly-purchafed Have.
Do thou, (O woman !) approach thy mafter.
—At the word Master, Callirrhoe, bowing down her head, and being unable to forget her former free­ dom, the burft into a flood of tears.
But Dionyfius, striking his reward, faid :
—Im­ pious wretch that thou art !
to fpeak to di­ vinities as thou wouldest to mortals.
Thou fayeft that this woman was purchased by thee, for money ;
and that thou canft not find the perfon, who fold her to thee.
Haft thou not read Homer *, who informs us, that Oft Ost deities will from the fries descend, And, in the guise of pilgrims, visit mortals ;
To pry into their deeds, or good or evil.
Ceafe therefore there opprobrious expressions, and make ufe of others more fuitable to god­ desses, or I will drive thee hence.
—Callirrhoe then fpake as follows:
—Ah!
do not mock my woe, by imagining me to be a goddefs ;
fince I am not even a fortunate woman.
While file uttered there words, her voice feemed divine to the ear of Dionyfius;
for it was remarkably melodious, and fweet as the accents of the lyre.
Being now confufed, and ashamed to converfe any longer with the woman, Dionyfius, already inflamed by love, went to the Villa.
His great croud of atten­ dants and equipages arrived there, from the city, not long after;
and the adventure of Callirrhoe was foon Spread round.
Immedi­ ately ately all hafted to fee the woman, though upon pretence of worshipping Venus.
Cal­ lirrhoe was in fuch confufion, on obferving fo vaft a concourse of people, that she knew not how to behave;
all being quite Grangers to her;
and she not feeing her confidante Plangon, who was then employed in receiving her Lord.
The appointed hour being past;
and none of Dionyfius's people returning to the Villa (all of them fitting or standing in the temple,) Leonas reflected what this mull be owing to ;
upon which he went to it, and conduced Callirrhoe out of that place of wor­ ship.
It was then feen, that kings are born kings, as in a bee-hive;
for all followed Cal­ lirrhoe, whofe beauty had proclaimed and elected her their mistress.
She then returned to her former residence.
IV.
Dionyfius had received a wound, which he endeavoured carefully to qonceal.
Having had had an excellent education, and adhering strictly to the dilates of the purest virtue;
he was loth to appear contemptible in the eyes of his domestics, or puerile and lafcivious in thofe of his friends.
He therefore struggled all that night;
hoping, by this means, to conceal his paffion, which yet his filence (though unperceived by himfelf) betrayed.
Taking then part of the fupper :
Let this (cried he) be carried to our Granger.
How­ ever, do not fay that it comes from her matter, but from Dionyfius.
He continued carouz­ ing longer than ufual, knowing that it would be impoffible for him to fleep;
and therefore wished to fpend the night with his friends.
Neverthelefs, when it was far advanced, he broke up from the company, and went to bed ;
but found sleep a stranger to his eyes.
Fancy then carried him into the temple of Ve­ nus ;
and recalled to his memory every cir­ cumflance cumftance relative to Calhrrhoe ;
her face, her flowing tresses, her air, her voice, her glance, her drefs, her difcourfe;
but what inflamed him, was her tears.
Then might be feen the confflict betwixt love and reafon ;
for though Dionyfius was deeply fmitten, he yet had too much wifdom and strength of mind not to oppofe his passion ;
and thereupon, like one who lifts his head above the waves, he cried:
—O Dionyfius !
thou who art the firft man for virtue and for glory, in Ionia, whom kings, governors, and cities admire;
doft thou not blush to act like a child ?
Shall a tranfient view caufe thee to love that female fo violent ly;
and ere thou haft expiated the shade of thy haplefs contort ?
Doll thou, Hill clad in mourn.
ing, retire into the country to celebrate the facred nuptial rites with a Have;
and perhaps with another manIs wife, as thou had ft not any instrument or contract with her her?-
The amo­ amorous god took a delight in perplexing Dionyfius, while he argued fo wifely with himself;
Cupid considering this moderation as an infult to his power ;
and as Dionyfius moralized thus philosophically in love, he therefore inflamed him still more.
Our Ionian being no longer able to bear this felf-converfe, rent for Leonas;
who coming in, and gueffing the caufe of this message, though he feigned not to know it;
fpake thus in a feeding con­ fufion:
-Whence is it (my Lord !) that flumbers fly your eyelids ?
Are your forrows, for the lofs of your departed lady, renew­ ed ? 1 grieve (faid Dionyfius) for a wo­ man, but not for the deceased.
Thy affec­ tion and fidelity will not permit me to conceal a fingle fecret from thee.
Thou haft undone me (0 Leonas!) and art the caufe of all my present anguish.
Thou haft fet my houfe on­ fire ;
or rather my heart.
It disturbs me alfo.
also, that I am rot able to discover who this nave is ?
Thou teller me an idle tale of a winged merchant, who came from, thou canst not fay where ;
and is fled thou knowefl not whither ?
And where is the man, who pof­ fessed of fuch a miracle in beauty, would have fold her to me, in an unfrequented place, for a talent;
when she is worth the treafures of the great king ?
Some of the gods muft cer­ tainly have impofed upon thee.
Do thou then recoiled every circumstance relating to this affair.
Whom didft thou fee?
With what people didst thou difcourfe ?
Tell me the whole truth.
Thou hadft not a fight of the fhip ?1 had not, my Lord (replied Leo­ nas) but I heard it mentioned.
The very thing (faid Dionyfius) I suspected and fore­ told :
One of the nymphs, or nereids, is risen from the feat
The genii are, at certain fea­ sons, compelled by the fates, to converse with with mortals, and to dwell upon earth.
This we are told by poets and profe writers Dionyfius would willingly have perfuaded his steward to extol Callirrhoe's charms, and her conversation, which deemed greatly to surpass that of mortals.
Leonas being defirous of pleating his master, faid :
-Let us not per­ plex ourselves too much, in enquiring who this woman is, I will now conduct her to you, unlefs this fhould be thought improper.
Be not thus dejeted;
nor despair of success in your paffion, since every thing is in your own power.
1 will not have her brought (re­ fumed Dionyfius) till I first know who she is, and whence she came.
We will enquire the truth to-morrow, from her own lips.
I will fend for her, but not to this houfe, that (he may not suspect any violence.
We will hold our conference under the eye and aufpiccs of Venus, in whofe temple I first faw her.
V. ThisV.
This being refolved, the next day Dio­ nysius went to the temple;
taking with him his friends, his freedmen, and the moft faith­ ful among his domestics;
in order that they might be as witnesses.
He did not go care-
Jelly attired, but fet off with fuch ornaments as were most:
advantageous to his perfon ;
and as one going to converge with the miftrefs of his affections.
Dionyfius was naturally hand­ fome;
tall;
and remarkably venerable in his afpeft.
Leonas, accompanied by Plangon, and by thofe waiting-women who were moft familiar with Callirrhoe, went to her apart­ ment, and thus addreft her :
Dionyfius is a man of the strictest justice, and an exaft ob­ server of the laws.
He is now gone to the temple, where thou (O woman !) mull:
declare, at last, who thou art;
and then thou wilt not fail of meeting with every assistance that justice may require.
Thou needed but speak to to him frankly, and without concealing a fingle circumstance of the truth ;
and by this means thou wilt excite, Hill more, his good will towards thee.
Callirrhoe consented to go, though with the utmost reluctance.
However, she assumed more confidence when the reflected that the temple was to be the scene of their conference.
Being entered it, all the spectators were still more inchanted with her beauty ;
and Dionyfius, loft in wonder, was struck dumb.
After a long filence, he, at last, but with the greater difficulty, broke into the following words;
—Thou haft been informed (0 woman !) of the whole state of my affairs.
I am Dionyfius, the first man in Mi­ letus, and of almoft all Ionia;
and renown­ ed for my piety towards the gods, and my humanity towards men.
It is juft that thou, on,the other hand, do give me a faithful ac­ count of thy felf;
for thofe who difpofed of thee, thee, faid, that thou art of Sybaris;
and wert fold by a mistress who was jealous of thee.—
Here a blufh overspread Callirrhoe's cheek;
when turning her eyes to the ground, the fpake thus :
1 never was fold till now ;
nor have I once feen Sybaris.
1 told thee, (faid Dionyfius, looking at his steward) that she was not a Have ;
and I even imagine her to be of noble birth.
Inform me (0 woman !) of every thing relative to thy felf;
but first tell me thy name.
Callirrhoe (anfwered she.)
—Her very name was pleating to Diony­ sius ;
and this was all she then revealed.
But he, being still very urgent, and employing the warmed prayers and entreaties :
The only favour (cried she, my Lord) I humbly requefl is, that I may be permitted to conceal my ftory.
The paft appears all like a dream or as a fa­ ble:
and I now am what cruel Fortune de­ stined me to be, a slave and an exile Say- ing ing this, she endeavoured to wave making any farther anfwer;
when the tears trickling fi­ lently down her cheeks ;
Dionysius, and all the reft of the spectators, could not for­ bear fympathizing with her ;
while fome imagined that they beheld the sorrowing Ve­ nus.
Dionyfius, whore curiofity was the more enflamed, adding further intreaties, continued thus :
O Callirrhoe !
the first boon I have to request of thee is, that thou wouldeft inform me of thy pall:
misfortunes.
Thou wilt not difclofe them to a Granger ;
for there is a fimilitude in our minds.
Be not afraid ;
even though thou shouldest have committed fome wicked crime ?
There words excited Callirrhoe's indignation:
Alas ! (faid (he) fpeak not thus injuriously to me.
My conscience does not upbraid me with guilt of any kind :
But as my birth and for­ tune were infinitely more illuftrious than my prefent prefent condition;
I would not be thought a vain boaster, nor relate particulars, which must appear incredible to all who might be unacquainted with them.
The recollection of my former happy state would be of no ad­ vantage to me now.
Dionyfius, admiring the woman's noble Spirit, faid :
I under­ hand thee, though thou speakest not, fo emphatical is thy silence.
Yet tell me all;
though all thou couldest fay, of thyfelf, would fall far fhort of what we now behold ;
and every circumstance, how shining foever, which thou mighteft relate, would be faint in com­ parifon of thy felf.
At laR Callirrhoe thus began, but with great reluctance, her story.— I am daughter to Hermocrates, Prætor of Sy­ racufe.
A fudden fall, on the ground, hav­ ing left me speechlefs ;
my parents buried me at a vast expence, and with great funeral pomp.
Certain pyrates, being afterwards allured allured by the treasures deported in the sepul­ chre, broke into it;
and there found me;
who, by that time, had recovered my breath, They then brought me hither ;
and Theron delivered me to Leonas, in this folitude.
She then told him every thing (except what related -to Chæreas) and went on thus:
I befeech thee (0 Dionyfius) as thou art a Greek;
as thou art the inhabitant of a city where humanity flourishes;
and art enlighten­ ed by a liberal education, not to imitate thofe sepulchral robbers, by depriving me of my country and of my relations.
Rich as thou art, in flaves, the difmiffing of one would be a trifle to thee.
Thou wilt not be a lofer by restoring me to my father :
for Hermo­ crates is no ways ungrateful.
All men praife and love Alcinous, because he font back the fuppliant Ulysses to his native country.
I alfo implore thee, to save a loft woman, who is Is made a captive, and in the hands of ene­ mies.
If I may not live in a manner Suitable to my birth, let me die free.
Dionyfius, at hearing thefe words, teemed to weep for Callirrhoe's misfortunes;
but in reality he bewailed his own ;
as be now perceived, that be fhould not obtain what he fo ardently wished.
—Do not defpond (faid he) 0 Callir­ rhoe!
but arm thy felf with courage, for every desire of thine shall be gratified;
and may Venus, in whofe pretence we now stand, bear witnefs to this declaration !
In the mean time, thou shalt be treated here like a mi­ stress, rather than as a slave.——
Callirrhoe left the temple, with a firm perfuafion, that she should not be made to fuffer any thing re­ pugnant to her inclinations.
VI, Dionyfius returned home in great af­ fliction ;
when calling Leonas to him in pri- vate, vate, be fpake thus:
I am unfortunate in all things !
The God of Love is my inveterate foe.
I have buried my wife;
and the woman lately purchased despises me;
though I had hoped, that fhe was a gift bellowed upon me by Venus;
and thence figured to my self a life far happier than that led by Menelaus, husband to the Spartan Dame ;
for surely He­ len was not so beautiful as Callirrhoe.
The goddefs of perfuafion fits upon her lips.
My life is at an end.
The day that Callirrhoe departs from hence, will be my laft.
Here Leonas cried aloud :
—No (my good Lord) do not commit violence on thy felf.
I am her master;
to that thou mayeft ufe thy plea­ fure with Callirrhoe, be this agreeable to her or not;
I having paid a talent for her.—
How, wretch ! (cried Dionyfius) haft thou purchased a woman of noble birth, and pof­ fessed of the fineft accomplishments ?
Haft thou thou not heard of Hermocrates, Prætor of the greater part of Sicily;
efteemed and beloved by the king of Perfia ;
that monarch ranking him among thofe who deferve well of the em­ pire ;
and fending him prefents annually;
for his having difcomfitted, in a naval engage­ ment, the Athenians, enemies to the Per­ sians?
And fhall I, (tyrant-like) cruelly in­ jure a free-born maid?
Shall Dionyfius, famed for his continence, be fo infolently wicked as to violate a woman, whom even Theron the pyrate did not presume to touch ?
It was thus Dionyfius fpake to Leonas;
and yet he did not defpair of winning Callirrhoe's affec­ tion by in treaties;
love naturally Inspiring hope;
and Dionyfius not doubting, but that he should obtain his withes by kindnefs and affiduity.
Then fending for Plangon :
Thou haft hitherto (faid he) given me proofs sufficient of thy care.
I now recommend, I now deliver up to thee, in charge, the most pre­ precious, the most dear part of my riches;
the lovely Granger.
I command that fhe want for nothing;
but, on the contrary, that she be entertained even to luxury.
Look upon her as thy mistress;
wait on her ;
reverence her;
deck her splendidly;
and do all thou canft to win me her affection.
Praise me fre­ quently before Callirrhoe;
and represent me, to her, fuch as thou knowest Dionyfius to be;
but beware of calling me her master.
Plangon immediately underwood this com­ mand ;
the being an artful, shrewd woman, who, without faying much, comprehended an affair in an Infant;
and thereupon made it her whole study to perfect it.
Going then to Callirrhoe, the did not declare that any di­ rections had been given her on this occafion :
but behaved with the ut most complacency and Kindnefs ;
in order that Callirrhoe might re­ pose all possible confidence in her, whenever fhe she should be defirous of insinuating her felf into her good graces, and of offering ad.
vice.
VII.
In the mean time the following incl­ dent happened.
Dionyfius did not leave his Villa;
he now feigning one excufe, then another;
but the true and only rear on was, he could not tear himself, from Callirrhoe;
nor yet would he take her with him to the, city.
He was sensible that (he, if once feen there, would foon be celebrated ;
that her wonderful beauty muft enslave all Ionia ;
and that the fame of it could not but reach the ear of the great king.
Now it happened that Dionyfius, having examined very accurately into the general state of his rural affairs ;
found caufe to cenfure Phocas, his under steward, on account of a certain article.
The reproof, however, went no farther than words:
but Plangon, feizing this opportunity.
flew all trembling trembling to Callirrhoe;
when tearing her hair, and clafping her knees;
;
-Good Lady (faid she) fave us, I befeech you !
Dionyfius is highly exafperated at my hufband.
My Lord is naturally very paffionate;
and yet is distinguished for his humanity.
Thou only canst rescue us from this impending danger.
Dionyfius, if thou but afk him, will willing­ ly grant thee this thy firft requeft.
Callir­ rhoe was afraid of waiting upon Dionyfius ;
and yet she would not venture to refute Plan­ gon's urgent intreaties and earned prayer;
as she was bound to her by so many fignal obli­ gations.
That she therefore might not ap­ pear ungrateful, the faid thus :
I albo am a servant, and have not the confidence to fpeak;
but if thou Imagined, that I may have any influence, I am ready to add my suppli­ cations to thine;
and may the gods give a happy issue to our endeavours!
Being come to to Dionyfius's apartment, Plangon bid the door-keeper inform his Lord, that Callirrhoc attended.
—Dionysius was then lying down;
pale, funk in grief, and half dead.
Hearing that Callirrhoe was at the door, he was struck dumb;
and a cloud seemed to overspread his mind at this unexpected event, fo that he could Scarce draw his breath ;
but recovering it at last, he cried :
Let her come in !—
Callirrhoe advancing near him with downcast eyes ;
her cheeks were instantly covered with blufhes, when fhe, with confuted accents, afterwards spake in manner following:
I owe this favour to Plangon ;
for she loves me as though I were her child.
I therefore befeech thee (my Lord) not to be angry with her hufband;
but to pardon him, at my humble intercession.
She would have said more, but her voice forfook her.
Dionyfius, who immediately faw through Plangon's ftra­ tagem, tagem, said :
I am extremely offended y and no perfon living fhould have faved Phocas and Plangon, from the most rigorous punifh­ ment, after the crimes they have dared to commit.
I yet will pardon them willingly at thy requeft.
Then turning to Plangon :
Do thou ( faid he) remember, that ye were forgiven at Callirrhoe's defire.
Plangon foiling at her Lord's feet:
—Rather prostrate your self (said he) before Callirrhoe, for it was she who saved you.
Plangon obferv­ ing joy to Sparkle in Callirrhoe's eyes ;
and the vast pleafure she felt, now she had obtained her suit :
Do thou (faid she) return our most dutiful, and most grateful thanks to Dionyfius;
at which words, (he pushed her forward.
Callirrhoe happening to flip, fell on Dionyfius's arm;
who, at the fame time that he teemed to scorn to lend her his hand to rife, drew her towards himself ;
when he gave gave her a kifs;
but immediately let her go ;
in order that the artifice, employed by him, might not create fufpicion.
VIII.
The women then went away;
but the kifs, which Dionysius had feized, glided like poifon through his veins, so that he could neither fee nor hear.
The god of Love as­ failed and triumphed over him on every side ;
and he was unable to find a cure to his paf­ fion.
Dionysius, when he restected on the greatnefs of Callirrhae's foul, was perfuaded that gifts could never win her:
and, on the other hand, that threats muft be equally in­ effectual;
he knowing, that she would die rather than fubmit to violence.
Imagining now that his hopes lay in Plangon only, lie fent for her, and fpake thus :
Thou did it hit upon the firft delightful stratagem ;
and I thank thee for the kifs, which has either formed formed my felicity, or will deftroy me.
Do thou then, who art a woman, try how far thou (assisted by me in the contest) can a over­ reach, and defeat, one of thine own sex.
Know that liberty will be thy recompence ;
and, what I am certain is still dearer to thee than liberty, the life of Dionyfius.
Plangon having received there commands, had recourse to every experiment and every artifice;
but all in vain ;
Callirrhoe being invincible, and true to Chæreas only.
Yet was she conquered by the infidious wiles of fortune, which baffle all the exertions of human rcafon :
for For­ tune is a very contentious goddess, from whom every thing, how unaccountable soever, may be exposed.
It is therefore not to be wondered at, that she then brought to matu­ rity an affair, that was wholly unthought of, and Seemingly impoffible.
The manner in which this was compassed is highly worthy of of out notice.
Fortune spread a snare to Callirrhoe's chaRity.
Chæreas and .the, on the night of their nuptials, had given each other fuch ardent proofs -of their reciprocal love, that it was not without fruit.
She con­ ceived, a little before the fatal blow was given her by Chæreas;
but was prevented from observing it, by the many dangers to which fhe had been exposed, and the fad.
misfortunes fubfequent to them.
It!
the beginning of the third month, Callirrhoe gave fymptoms that the was pregnant;
a circumstance which Plangon (who was well skilled in there mat­ ters) difcovered in the bath.
However, fle took no notice of it then, as many female at­ tendants were present;
but, towards the evening, Plangon being at leisure, and find­ ing a convenient opportunity, she feated her­ felf by the bed-fide, and fpake thus:
- Knowest thou (my child) that thou art breed- — ing ?
leg —Callirrhoe, at thefe words, groaned and wept;
then tearing her hair, she cried as follows :
Thou (0 Fortune !) to my other fad sufferings, doft add that of my bringing a flave into the world.
And now, (con­ tinued she, Smiting her breast)
Thou art wretched, even before thou comeft into the world.
Thou waft given to the sepulchre, and delivered into the hands of pyrates.
In how miserable a state of life wilt thou be born ?
To what hopes do I bear thee ?
Fa­ therlefs, an exile, and a nave.
Die, die be­ fore thy birth !——Plangon, retraining Cal­ lirrhoe's cruel hands, promifed to provide her, the next day, with the means of procuring, more eafily, an abortion.
IX.
Thefe two.
women,
Separating after­ wards, made their feveral reflexions.
Plan­ gon imagining, as she knew Callirrhoe was preg­ pregnant, that then was a fit time for giving succefs to her mailer's paffion:
I now (faid Plangon, in her own mind) have hit upon an argument which furely muff weigh with Callirrhoe:
viz. that maternal piety ought to triumph over conjugal continence.—
Plangon applauded herfelf for this lucky thought (for fuch she considered it*:
) but Callirrhoe refolved within herfelf, at first, to destroy her fruit ;
the reasoning thus:
— Shall I bring forth, to one whore slave I am, the grand-fon of Hermocrates ?
Shall I give birth to an infant whore father no perfon can point point out?
Perhaps tome calumniator may tauntingly fay, that Callirrhoe conceived while among' pyrates.
Suffice it that I only be wretched.
Wherefore (0 my child !)
Should I bring thee into a life of mifery;
from which thou, when born, oughteft to fly ?
Depart then in freedom ;
unacquainted with for­ rows:
and hear not the fad relation of thy mother's woes.
She then again relented, and compaffion pleaded in favour of the bur­ then within her.
Thou dont meditate (faid she) to deftroy thine infant (0 moftimpious of thy sex !) and to act like Medea.
Nay,
Thou feemeft even more inhuman than that Scythian woman ;
for her hufband was her enemy;
whereas thou art preparing to flay the fon of Chaereas;
and not to leave the least traces of his fo greatly celebrated nuptials.
But fuppofe thou shouldest be delivered of a male ?
Suppose he fhould refemble his fa­ ther ;
and be more fortunate than thee ?
Shalt
Shalt thou, who art his mother, kill him who had efcaped from the sepulchre and from py­ rates ?
Do we not know, that many fans of gods, and of kings, though born in flavery, yet rescued themselves from it, and afterwards rofe to all the fplendor of their progenitors, as Amphion, Zethus, and Cyrus ?
Thou (my son !) wilt fail to Sicily;
wilt reek thy fa­ ther, and grand-fire ;
and relate to them thy mother's fufferings.
Thou wilt fend out a fleet from thence, to my aid, and reftore thy parents to each other.
Revolving there.
things the whole night, the at last fell asleep, when the image of Chæreas flood before her:
Alike in flature, and alike in face;
His sparkling eyes;
his rosy cheeks;
his mien :
His well-known garments —All proclaim'd him Chartas.
Wife!
Wife! (cried he) I commit my fon (sweet pledge!) in trust to thee:
—When he, going to fay more, Callirrhoe Parted from her slum­ bers, and flew to embrace him.
She now was firmly resolved to preferve and bring up her infant;
as imagining that fuch was her husband's counsel.X.
The next day Plangon coming to Cal­ lirrhoe, the latter acquainted her with her refolution, which Plangon did not think fea­ fonable, fo would not approve of it.
—Wo­ man (faid she) it will be impoffible for thee to bring up thy fon in this houfe.
My Lord has a fincere love for thee ;
and is too hu­ mane, too modest, to employ forcible me­ thods, in order to bring thee to his will:
but, on the other hand, he is too jealous to let thee nurfe thy child here.
He would look upon this as injurious to himself;
as though thou thou thoughteft very affectionately and ho­ nourably of him when abfent, but contempt­ ibly when present.
I therefore think that thou hadft better destroy the infant before its birth, than when born ;
fince thou, by this means, wilt efcape the inconveniencies at­ tending on pregnancy, and the pains of child- birth.
It is my affection for thee, that prompts me to give this falutary advice.——
Callirrhoe was not pleated at what she now heard;
when throwing herfelf at Plangent feet;
I conjure thee (faid Callirrhoe) to join with me, in contriving fome method by which I may be enabled to preferve and bring up the child.—
But Plangon, after many denials, faid she would give her an answer in two or three days.
Callirrhoe growing still more carneA in her intreaties, which in­ creafed Plangon's confidence and authority;
the latter began by making Callirrhoe swear, not not to mention one tingle word, to any per­ fon, of an artifice she meditated.
Then knitting her brows, and wringing her hands, like to persons in the deeper affliction :
My dear woman (cried she) great things can­ not be atchieved without attempting greatly ;
and I, from the love I bear thee, will impose upon ray Lord.
Know then, that one of there two things must come to pass ;
either the child muft be destroyed ;
or be born heir to the richer man, and of the most il­ lustrious family, in all Ionia;
and thus make thee a perfectly happy mother.
I now leave thee to thy choice.
——What woman (replied Callirrhoe) could be fo mad, as to prefer the murthering of her infant, to felicity ?
What thou now teller me feems incredible and impossible;
and therefore explain thy­ felf more clearly.
How long (faid Plan­ gon) haft thou been pregnant ?
Callirrhoe re­ replied About two months. —
That time (faid the former) will be of very great service to us;
as it may be supposed, that thou broughtest a child, to Dionyfius, at feven months end.
At thefe words Cal­ lirrhoe cried aloud :
O rather let it pe­ rish!
—Plangon then employing dissimula­ tion :
Woman (faid she) thou judged wifely, in chufing rather to destroy thy fruit.
Let this be done, as it will be less dangerous than to impofe -upon my matter.
Eraze then, from thy memory, all thoughts of thy nobi­ lity ;
and entertain no farther hopes of ever returning to thy native country.
Suit thy self to.
thy present mean condition, and be truly a Have.
While Plangon was thus employ­ ing all the powers of persuasion ;
the young Callirrhoe, being ingenuous and unacquaint­ ed with the mean wiles of Servants, did not entertain the least fufpicion.
But the more urgent urgent Plangon was, for Callirrhoe to make away with her infant, the more it raifed the future mother's compassion.
—Give me (faid she) time to deliberate;
as I must chufe be­ tween two mighty things, viz.
either my chastity, or my child.
—Plangon again corn­ mended her, for not making her option rashly ;
as equal reasons might be given, in favour, of either resolution;
fince the one pleaded for conjugal fidelity, and the other for maternal love.
However, (added she) there is no time for delay;
thou mull:
abso­ lutely determine, one way or other, by to- morrow at farthest, and before thy preg­ nancy shall be discovered.
Having thus settled matters, they parted.
XI.
Callirrhoe then retired to an upper apartment, when Shutting the door, she laid Chæreas's picture upon her bofom, and said— We We are now three;
hufband, wife and child.
Let us deliberate on our common welfare.
In the mean time I will firft declare my opi­ nion, and that is, to die the wife of Chæ­ rcas only.
The having no commerce with any other man, will be dearer to me than my parents, my country, or my child.
And now, (my fweet babe f) what is thy choice ?
To die by poifon, and not behold the fun;
to be caft out with thy mother;
and, per­ haps, not to be allowed even a grave:
or, on the other hand, to live, and be the child of two fathers;
the one prince of Sicily, the other of Ionia ?
Being afterwards arrived at manhood, thou wilt eafily be known by thy parents and kindred;
for firmly perfuaded I am, that thou, when born, wilt refemble thy father.
Thou wilt fail to thy native coun­ try with fplendor, in a Milefian (hip.
Her­ mocrates will joyfully receive his grand-Ion;
by by that time qualified to command on the ocean.
Thy determination (0 my child !) is contrary to mine;
and docs not permit me to die.
Let us now hear and consult also thy father.
But he has already given his opinion ;
for, standing before me in a dream, he faid :
I give (0 wife !) my boy in truft to thee.
I call thee (0 Chæreas !) to witnefs, that it is thou who leaded me to wed Diony­ fins.
Callirrhoe passed that day and the following night in fuch reflexions;
and re­ solved at last to live ;
not for her own fake, but for that of her Child.
Plangon coming to her next morning, fat down at firft with an air of melancholy, and as one who would condole her:
when both remained silent for a long time;
but, at last, Plangon fpake thus :
What hast thou refolved upon ?
How are we to act ?
We have no time to lofe.
Callirrhoe could not immediately re­ turn tUfa an answer;
her tears, and her grief, retraining her tongue ;
but, at laft, the foL­ lowing words burft from her.
My child betrays me againft my will.
Do whatever thou thinker may be befit
But I fear, that fhould I yield to Dionysius's defires he yet would contemn my abject condition;
and looking upon me as his harlot, rather than as his wife, will not therefore bring up an­ other man's son.
Thus might I facrifice my continence without reaping the leaft bene­ fit.
Having faid there words, Plangon in­ terrupted her:
—I have reflected, (faid she) on this affair long before thee, and taken the proper meafures.
I love thee more than I do my Lord.
Trust then to Dionyfius's humanity.
He is an excellent man:
but though he is my matter, I yet will extort an oath from him.
It is necessary that we act with the utmoft caution;
and do thou (my child!) in the mean time, confide in me.
I will now go, and carry thy mef­ fage.
END OF THE SECOND BOOK.
THEI.
D IONYSIUS, now imagining that he was repulfed by his darling Cal­ lirrhoe;
and his patience being exhausted, he refolved to starve himself.
He then made his will, in which he gave directions for his funeral ;
and conjured Callirrhoe to vifit him, though though he were dead.
Now Plangon was going into her Lord's apartment, when a fer­ vant, who had received orders not to admit any one, stopt her.
Dionyfius heard a noife and quarrelling at the door, when enquiring about it;
and the Servant telling him that Plangon was there :
She is come (faid the master) at an unfeafonable time he not caring to fee any object which might remind him of his passion -However, call in Plan­ gon, (faid Dionyfius :
) upon which she open­ ed the door, and fpake as follows.
Why doft thou (my Lord!) thus torture thy self, and pine away with forrow, as though thou wert disdained ;
since Callirrhoe invites thee to join with her in the bands of hymen.
Drefs thy felf then in splendid attire ;
offer up sacrifices and give feastings, and receive thy much-loved bride.
—Dionysius was all amazement at this unexpected news;
and his eyes, eyes, as well as mind, were veiled in darkness.
Being wafted through falling, he appeared like one dead ;
whe,n Plangon making bitter moan, alarmed the whole family, who ran up and down, and bewailed their matter as though he had been dead.
Callirrhoe her felf could not refrain from tears on this me­ lancholy occasion:
and fo piercing was her grief, that she could not forbear deploring Dionyfius's lots, as though he had been her hufband.
A little time after, Dionyfius re­ covering himfelf, though with great diffi­ culty ;
What deity (said he, in a feeble tone) now deceives me, and would draw me from my fixt resolution ?
Heard I thofe things dreaming or waking :
and will Callir­ rhoe be my bride;
she who even shuns my fight?
Plangon Handing by him :
Ceafe (my Lord !) faid she, to afflict thy self.
Be not diffident with regard to thy own hap- piness.
piness.
I do not impofe upon my master :
ses Callirrhoe has rent me to fpeak to thee con­ cerning the nuptials.
—Do thou then (faid Dionysius) deliver the message.
Repeat her very words without the lead addition or di­ minution ;
consequently exactly as she fpake them.
-Hereupon Plangon went on thus:
- Callirrhoe faid ;
the houfe I Sprung from is the lirA in all Sicily.
Though I have been unhappy, I yet preserve the greatnefs of foul which I inherited.
Fortune forced me from my native country, and my parents;
but could not rob me of the fplendor of my birth.
If Dionyfius intends me for his concubine, merely to fatiate his luft;
I will kill my self, rather than Submit to fo flavifh, fo fhameful a prostitution.
If, on the other hand, he intends to make me his lawful wife, I then a will gladly become a mother, in order to give idue to the houfe of Hermocrates.
Let Dio­ nysius nyfius deliberate on this, not merely in his own mind, nor hastily, but with his kindred and friends;
that no one may afterwards re­ proach him, by faying:
Thou didst nur­ ture children whom thou hadst by a Gave, and art a difgrace to thy family.
If he will not be a father, let him not be a husband.—
Thefe words inflamed Dionyfius Mill more ;
and gave him fome little glimmerings of hope, that Callirrhoe might possibly return him love for love.
Then lifting up his hands to­ wards the skies:
Grant me (faid he) 0 Jupiter ! 0 Phoebus !
a fon by Callirrhoe.
This being indulged, I shall think my felf more happy than the great king.
Let us now go to her ;
and do thou (Plangon !) whofe affection for thy master is fo strong, be my guide.
II.
They then went swistly to the upper apartment, when Dionyfius going, at first, to to fall hastily at Callirrhoe's feet, restrained himfelf;
and fitting down with the gravity becoming a man of high rank, he fpake thus:
-I am come (my fair one !) to return thee thanks for having faved my life;
for I should never have employed force, hadst thou opposed my wishes;
but was refolved to die, had I been disappointed in my hopes.
Thou haft restored me to existence;
and though I owe thee infinite obligations, I yet must blame thee in one particular, viz.
for not thinking that I would make thee my bride purfuant to the laws of Greece, in order for us to have legitimate children.
Did I not love thee, I should never have wished for fuch nuptials.
But thou (methinks) must look upon me as out of my senses, to imagine, that I would treat a woman nobly born, as a slave;
or to conclude that it were derogatory to me, to have a child who should be the grand- grand-Ion of Hermocrates.
Thou defireft me to deliberate upon this.
I have done that already.
Thou art afraid of my friends;
thou, whom I prize above them all.
Who will presume to hint, that a fon of mine, whore grandfire is more illustrious than his father, is unworthy of me ?
Saying there words, which tears interrupted, he drew nearer to Callirrhoe, who blushing, gave him a gentle kifs, and faid :
Dionysius !
I do, indeed, truft to thee, but I cannot trust to Fortune ;
because the lately tore me from the enjoyment of the chief terrestrial bIer.
sings:
and I am afraid she will not be fincerely reconciled to me for the future.
Do thou then, as a man of the strictest honour and juftice, call the gods to witness ;
not for thy­ felf, but for thy citizens and kindred ;
in or­ der that no one may be induced to form any malicious attempt againft me hereaster;
when they they that!
be told of the oath thou haft taken.
A woman without friends, and a foreigner, is much exposed to contempt and ill usage.—
By what Deity (cried Dionysius) wouldest thou have me fwear ?
I am ready (were this poffible) to soar to the fkies, and there, clafp­ ing the knees of Jupiter, to fwear by him.— Swear (faid Callirrhoe) by Neptune, because he brought me hither;
by Venus, who first pointed me out to thee ;
and by Cupid, who leadeth me to thee as thy bride.
This pleated Dionyfius, and he immediately took the oath.
Cupid was now overjoyed to add to the number of his triumphs.
Dionyfius's love increasing, he could not bear the thoughts of delaying his marriage ;
it being extremely difficult for man to check the gratifying of his defires.
But Dionyfius, who had received an excellent education, felt a temper in his breast, and his foul was much funk.
He yet struggled struggled with all his might, against the bit.
lows (as it were) of his paffion;
to prevent his being shipwrecked by its violence.
He then made the following reflections, by which he endeavoured to fix his reliefs mind.-
Shall I wed, in a folitude, and without wit­ nesses, a woman whom money purchased ?
It would argue the utmoft meannefs in me not to celebrate my nuptials, with Callirrhoe, in the most folemn manner.
In the first place, I ought to pay every honour to this woman, as it will insure my future felicity.
Fame is the fleeteft and most prying of all messen­ gers ;
and wings the air with a rapid and un­ checked progress.
From her, things, if ever fo orange, cannot be concealed.
She already flies to Sicily with the following news ;
Cal­ lirrhoe is still living.
Robbers, having broke open the sepulchre, stole her from thence, and fold her in Miletus.
Hither will arrive a fleet a fleet of Syracufian gallies, under Hermo­ crates, to demand his daughter.
What (hall I then fay ?
Theron fold her to me.
But where is Theron to be found?
Supposing that my words were credited, it then would appear that I had given shelter to a pyrate.
Reflect (0 Dionyfius !) on this affair;
which thou, perhaps, mayeft be obliged to debate before the great king.
It will therefore be best for me to be able to fay thus :
Being informed that a woman of birth was, by I know not what accident, brought to this place;
I afterwards efpoufed her, with her own content pursuant to the laws.
By this conduct I shall persuade my father in law, that I am not unworthy of his alliance.
Be stedfast (my foul!) fome little time more ;
in order that thou mayeft enjoy the longer, and with greater fecurity, all thy pleasure.
I then shall have more influence at the trial, by appear­ appearing as a hufband, not as a master.—
Having thus determined, he called Leonas, and faid to him :
Go to the city, and pre­ pare the nuptials with as much magnificence as thou mayest think necessary.
Let herds and flocks be brought thither, as albo corn and wine both by fea and land ;
for I am refolved to invite the whole city to feast at my wed­ ding.
—Having carefully given directions for every thing, he himfelf fet out for the city, next day, in a chariot;
ordering Callirrhoe, whom he would not show publickly yet, to be conveyed, about the evening, in a barge, to his houfe which flood near the harbour called Docimos.
Now the first thing done by Callirrhoe (who was delivered to the care of Plangon) before file left the country, was to offer up prayers to Venus;
when entering her temple, and causing every one to depart from it, she thus addressed that Deity:
- Ought Ought I (0 Venus ! my goddefs) to be of­ fended with, or to return thee thanks ?
Thou didst give me in marriage, when a virgin, to Chæreas:
and thou wilt now bestow me, in wedlock, upon another man.
However, I Should not have been compelled to this, (I swear by thee, and by thy son) had not my infant betrayed me:
Saying which she pointed to her bofom.
I fupplicate thee for his fake, not for my own.
Grant that my ar­ tifices may impose upon Dionyfius :
and since my babe has no real father, grant that he may be thought the child of Dionyfius;
for, when arrived at years of maturity, he will find out his father.
Callirrhoe being come from the temple to the fea-shore, the mari­ ners gazed with astonishment;
and were no less charmed than if Venus herself had been going on board.
Crouds flocked round, and all were eager to worship her.
The rowers exerted exerted uncommon vigour;
fo that the barge arrived, quick as thought, at the port.
By day-break next morning the whole city wore chaplets;
when every one offered up victims, not only in the temples, but before their own doors.
Various were the conjectures who the bride could be.
The lower fort of people struck with her exquifite beauty, and not knowing who fle was, were perfuaded that one of the nereids was rifen out of the ocean ;
or that the goddess herself was come from Dionyfius's fylvan Scenes ;
the mariners hav­ ing fpread a report, that she revealed herfelf in them.
The whole city had but one wish, which was, to fee Callirrhoe;
and the mul­ titdde crouded to the temple of Concord, where, pursuant to the Milefian custom, the bridegroom was to receive his bride.
Cal­ lirrhoe now, for the firft time fince her bu­ rial, appeared in fplendid veftments:
for having having till then'formed a resolution never to marry again, she imagined that her country, and her high rank, would ferve her inftead of beauty.
Being then clad in a flowing Mi­ lefian robe, and adorned with the bridal crown, fhe turned towards the people, when they all cried aloud :
These are the ef­ poufals of Venus!
Purple carpets were fpread upon the ground;
rofes, and violets were brewed ;
and ointments poured forth, all the way fhe part.
No one ftaid at home.
Old people and children came from their dwellings;
the port was quite a defart;
and many, by reafon of the vail crouds, climbed to the tops of houses.
But fome envious
God beheld that day, with inauspicious eyes, as I will foon relate;
after giving an account of what passed, about the fame time, in Sy- Tacufe.
III.
TheIII.
The robbers of the sepulchre had do­ fed it very carelesly, as it was night, and as they were in great haste to get away:
and Chaereas, fo Coon as it was day-break, went thither ;
upon pretence of carrying crowns or chaplets and libations * ;
but, in reality, with a resolution to kill himself.
As he was unable to bear his reparation from Callirrhoe, he thought that death only could heal his an­ guish.
Being come to the Mausolæum, he found the stones of it had been moved, and that the entrance was open.
Chæreas was terrified at the fight;
and infinitely perplexed, as he did not know how to account for what he raw.
Fame, that fwift-winged messenger, foon fpread through Syracufe the news of this unexpected event;
whereupon the whole city ran to the sepulchre;
though no one durft enter it, without an order from Hermocrates.
At At laft, a perfon going in, and making an exact report of what he had feen;
no one would believe that the dead body was not there.
Upon this Chæreas himfelf was de­ termined to enter, from an ardent desire he had to fee again his dear Callirrhoe, though dead;
but searching every part of the tomb, he could not find the leaft traces of her.
Many not believing that this could be possible, they themselves refolved to go in;
and doing fo, all were confounded, as not knowing what had happened.
One of the spectators then landing up, cried aloud:
The su­ nereal treasures depofited here are stolen, which must have been the horrid work of robbers.
But where is the dead body ?
-The populace formed a great variety of conjectures on this occasion ;
when Chæreas, lifting up his hands towards heaven:
---What God (cried he) now become my rival, has fnatch­ ed ed away Callirrhoe;
and by the fuperiority of his power, withholds my ftruggling bride?
She was carried off instantly, that she might not feel the stroke of death.
Thus did Bac­ chus rob Thefeus of Ariadne;
and thus Jove Hole Semele.
But I knew not that my wife was a goddess;
and worthy the bed of the immortals only.
However, it was not necef­ fary for her to have left the world fo suddenly as she did, nor for fuch a caufe.
Thetis alfo was a goddess, and yet she continued true to Peleus, and even had a fon by him.
But I was abandoned in the very flower, the height of my passion.
What shall I do?
What will become of wretched me ?
Shall I lay violent hands on my self ?
But with whom shall I be buried?
for, in the midft of my calamities, this single hope consoled me, viz. that though I did not long enjoy the hyme­ neal delights with Callirrhoe, yet that one sepulchre sepulchre would have held us both.
I here account to thee, (sweet creature!) for my spotless conduct;
for it is thou who doft force me to live.
But feek thee I will, both by fea and by land;
and, were this poffible, even in the skies.
The only boon (my dear wife !) I crave, is, that thou wouldeft not (hun me.—
At thefe words the whole assembly burft into tears;
and they now were as deeply afflicted, as before for Callirrhoe.
Immediately the ships put to fea;
and it was agreed that they should take different courses.
Hermo­ crates undertook to fearch Sicily;
Chæreas went for Lybia ;
while fome were difpatched to Italy ;
and others had orders to crofs the Ionian sea.
Yet all thefe human efforts were vain;
but Fortune, without whore aid nothing can be perfected, brought the whole truth to light;
as will appear in the fequel of then:
events.
The impious pyratcs having fold the the woman (a merchandize not easily difpofed of,) they left Miletus, and failed towards Crete, knowing that this was a large, rich island ;
whence they hoped, that they fhould easily fell the rest of their cargo in it.
But a furious wind arifing, it drove them from their intended courfe, into the Ionian fea, (that unfrequented ocean,) whereon they, fad and forlorn, were long tossed.
There dreadful ftorms of thunder, lightning, and a long, long night, difmayed thofe wretches;
providence manifestly evincing, that it was for Callirrhoe's fake only that they, till then, had been favoured with fo prosperous a voyage.
Thefe pyrates teemed at the gates of death every moment;
but God prolonged the temper in order that they might not be freed from their terrors and come to a fatal end.
The earth re­ jected there miscreants :
for after having been long tofled about the ocean, they, at laft, were were in want of every necessary, particularly drink.
Their wicked wealth was not then of the lean:
advantage to them;
on the con­ trary, they perifhed, fatiated with gold.
But now they repented, though late, of their enormous crimes;
reproaching each other to no purpofe.
The whole crew, (Theron ex­ cepted) died of thirst :
he, even in this ex­ tremity of distress, not forgetting his wonted detestable cunning;
which prompted him to steal, clandestinely, the liquor that his com­ panions ought to have (hared ;
an action he gloried in, as in all others of that fort.
Here behold the anger and indignation of for­ tune *, who referved this wretch for tortures, and for the crofs.
The fhip where Chæreas was on board, failing at random, came up with Theron's vessel;
and at firft fheered off, imagining that the was a pyrate :
but obferv­ ing ing that she flew at the mercy of the waves, and had no pilot;
one from Chæreas's fhip cried aloud :
-
There is not a foul on board !
Let us not be afraid ;
but going forward, let us examine what portent lies concealed in her.
The pilot approved of the advice;
for Chæreas, having covered his head, had left the deck, and was laid down.
Being now come up with the vessel, they hailed her, and asked who was on board ?
But no anfwer being returned, one of the crew, jumping from the ship into the vessel, found nothing in her but dead bodies and gold.
This being made known to the failors, they rejoiced ex­ ceedingly ;
and thought themselves extremely fortunate, in having found a treafure in the midst of the ocean.
Chæreas hearing an up­ roar, enquired the caufe of it;
which being told, he himself was very defirous of exa­ mining into this novelty.
But now knowing again, again, immediately, the several sepulchral (poils, he tore his clothes ;
and in the louder and the most piercing accents, cried thus :
— Alas!
Callirrhoe:
thefe things belong to thee:
This is the crown I placed upon thy head :
That thy father gave thee ;
that thy mother ;
and there lies the nuptial robe.
A ship has been thy grave.
I fee the things be­ longing to thee, but where art thou ?
Of the Several articles lodged in the Mausolæum, the deceased only is wanting.
Theron, struck at there unexpected words, was bloodless;
and lay extended like the dead bodies of his companions.
Although he, after much re­ flection, had formed a refolution, not to utter a single word, nor to move ever so little (well knowing what would be his fate fhould he be discovered ;
) yet, as man is in­ finitely fond of life;
and does not despair, even in the extremes of mifery, of a change for for the better;
(God, the Creator of the world, having inspired all human Beings with there fage thoughts, in order that they might not free themfelves from a wretched life :
)
Theron, who was parched with thirst, burft forth thefe words
Give me drink !——
After liquor had been brought, all imaginable care was taken of him ;
when Chæreas, sit­ ting down by him, fpake thus :
Who art thou, and whither art thou bound ?
Whence hadft thou thefe things ?
and what haft thou done with the mistress of them ?
——Theron not forgetting his ufual guile, and having recourse to wicked artifice, replied ;
Crete is my native country.
I was failing for Ionia, to feek after my brother, who is a soldier in that island ;
when I was suddenly abandoned, in the harbour of Cephalonia, by the passengers.
I then went on board this little vessel, which, very luckily for me, hap- pened pened to fail that way.
We next were drove by furious winds into this sea ;
and being afterwards long becalmed, all the crew died of thirty except myself, who was preferved for my piety.
——Chæreas having heard this, ordered the vessel to be towed by their fhip, till they should arrive at fome of the ports of Syracufe.
IV.
Fame, naturally swist, flew then with unufual rapidity, to Spread many wonderful tidings.
Every one crouded to the sea fhore;
and all were agitated by different passions.
Some wept, while others wondered;
fame asked questions, and others were in doubt;
but all were struck with the strangeness of the incident.
Callirrhoe's mother, at the fight of the various articles which had been lodged in the sepulchre with her daughter, finding them entire, as she counted them over ;
she vented vented a flood of tears, and cried:
—My child !
Thou only art wanting !
What new kind of robbery is this;
to steal only my daughter, and preserve the vestments and gold I fee ?—
The chores and harbours echoed with the wailings of women;
and both fea and land were filled with lamentations.
Hermocrates, who had borne the higher offices in the flare, -and was a man of consummate experience, faid :
-It were needlefs for us to make an en­ quiry here, in a tumultuous manner.
This must be done regularly, and with legal so­ lemnity.
Who knows but that this affair may require the pretence of the judges ?—
While he fpake, the theatre was crouded.
Great numbers of women came thither like­ wise.
And now all the people, big with expectation, were heated :
when Chæreas en­ tered frA, clad in deep mourning, pale and dismal in aspect;
and fucb as he appeared, when when he followed his dear Callirrhoe to the grave.
He would not afcend the roftrum or pulpit, but Handing on the ground, firft wept bitterly a long time ;
and then, strongly en­ deavouring to fpeak, words could not find utterance.
At laft, the multitude bidding him go up, and begin;
Chæreas with great difficulty lifted up his eyes, and said :
——
This is not a time to declaim, but to moan :
and yet I, compelled by dire necessity, do fpeak;
and will live till I find the wretch who has robbed me of my Callirrhoe.
For this purpose I fet out from this place, in a galley:
but whether my voyage has been pro­ pitious, or otherwise, I cannot fay.
For I spied a vend sailing beneath a cloudlefs sky, and in a stark calm;
but all temper within, and near foundering, though the ocean was quite fmooth.
Surprized at this, we came up with the vessel;
when, methought I be- I beheld the sepulchre of my poor, haplefs wife, and every thing that had been buried with her;
and fhe only miffing.
There alfo were many dead bodies (which is no ways our concern) but, among them, a man al­ most expiring was found ;
and him I have preserved, with the utmost care, for your ex­ amination.
Hereupon the lictors, or fer­ jeants of the court, led Theron, (hackled as a criminal, into the theatre, followed by a Suitable retinue, viz. the wheel and catapult;
fire, and scourges:
Providence now going to reward him for his paft abominable exploits.
Being brought before the Archontes, or chief magistrates, one of them interrogated him thus :
Who art thou ?
——My name (re­ plied he) is Demetrius.
Of what coun­ try ?——Of Crete.
What canst thou fay for thyfelf?
Sailing cried (he,) to­ wards Ionia, to vifit my brother;
I was aban­ doned doned by the ship's company.
I thereupon was obliged to go on board a fmall vessel, which was paffing that way ;
the crews where­ of I fuppofed to be merchants, but now find they were robbers of sepulchres.
Having been long toil on the fea, and our provifions sailing, the crew were starved to death ;
and I only have been preferved, as a reward for my never having committed, to my knowlege, a fingle crime.
0 Syracufians !
Ye who are renowned for humanity, be not more cruel to me than the ocean and thirft have been.-
He uttered thefe accents fo very dolefully, that most of the assembly were moved to pity ;
and his words would, possibly, have foon made so strong an impression on his auditors, as to induce them to acquit, and bestow upon him provisions;
had not fome Deity, to revenge the wrongs of Callirrhoe, intervened;
justly offended at Theron, for his having employed fuch fuch persuasive eloquence, in to abominable a caufe:
since, had his words prevailed, a moPe shocking circumstance muft have hap­ pened, viz.
that the Syracufians would have thought a wretch had been preserved, merely as a reward for his piety, who was most for­ tunately faved, on no other account, than that he might be pumped with greater feverity than any of his companions.
A fisherman, who was fitting among the croud, happened to know him;
and thus whifpered the people near him:
——I lately faw this fellow loiter­ log about our port.
Thefe words were foon Spread round, upon which one cried aloud:
The culprit tells a falshood.——
And now the whole people took the alarm;
when the man, who first faid that he knew the prisoner, was ordered to leave his seat, and advance into the middle of the theatre.
Theron,
Aill affirming that he was not the person ;
perfon;
the fisherman persisted, yet more strongly, in his first asseveration.
The chief magistrates then calling in the executioners, thefe fcourged the impious wretch ;
who long bore, with fuch undaunted refolution, the tortures, both by fire and fword, that he al­ most rofe fuperior to them all.
But sharp are the flings of conference in every man;
and truth conquers all things:
for Theron made, at last, a full confeffion, though with great difficulty and by flow degrees;
he Speaking as follows:
Happening to fpy riches depofiting in a Mausolæum, I got toge­ ther a band of robbers.
We then broke open the sepulchre, and therein found a living wo­ man who was fuppofed to be dead.
We after­ wards took out every article from the tomb ;
and putting the whole on board a vessel, failed for Miletus, where we fold the woman only ;
and were carrying the- reft of the cargo to Crete;
Crete;
but being driven by the winds, into the Ionian fea, yourselves have been eye wit­ nefles to our sufferings ——
He then difclofed every particular, except the name of the pur­ chafer of Callirrhoe.
After this declaration joy and grief filled the breasts of all the spec­ tators :
joy, becaufe Callirrhoe was still liv­ ing ;
grief, because fhe had been fold.
The­ ron was then fentenced to die;
but Chæreas intreated that a reprieve might be granted him, for a short time;
in order (faid Chæ­ reas) that he may inform me who has bought Callirrhoe.
Behold (added he) to what a fad neceffity I am reduced ;
thus forced to fue for the villain who fold my wife ——
Her­ mocrates, however, oppofcd this requeft, faying:
That it were better they should be at more pains and trouble, in feeking his daughter, than to violate the laws.
——I be­ feech you, 0 Syracufians!
(fubjoined he) to call call to mind my paft fervices on board your fleets, and the trophies I have won;
and to reward my daughter for them.
Be fo kind as to fend an embassy for her;
and let us bring her back a free woman.
Thefe words were fcarce uttered, when the people cried aloud-
We will, every one of us, go in fearch of Callirrhoe, if necessary;
and most of the fenators readily offered the like.
Hereupon Hermocrates said:
—Accept all of my warm­ est thanks, for the honour you intend me :
but two of the fenators, and two from a- , mong the people, will be embassadors fuffi­ cient ;
and Chæreas may make the fifth.
This resolution pleated universally, and was affected to, upon which the court broke up.
Theron was then led to execution, through vast crouds of people ;
when being fastened to a crofs, before the entrance of Callirrhoe's sepulchre ;
he thence faw the fea, over which he he had carried, as a slave, the daughter of Hermocrates, whom the Athenians could never take prisoner.
V.
All the rest were of opinion, that it would be prudent to wait till the sea fhould be open, and not venture out till Spring ;
it being then the depth of winter, at which season the Ionian ocean was judged impaf­ sible But Chæreas, fired by love, was al­ ready prepared ;
and fitting out a ship with -amazing expedition, was impatient to give himself up to the winds, and waves;
a dan­ ger no one elfe dared to run.
Hereupon the embassadors, excited by the example of Chæ­ reas, and especially of Hermocrates, would delay no longer, but immediately took mea­ fures for their departure.
The Syracufians, to add fplendor to this embassy, sent it forth in the name, and at the expence, of the pub- lie ;
lie ;
and put to fea the admiral's ship, which still bore the enfigns of victory.
The day fixed for their failing being come, the people flocked to the sea -shore;
not only men, but alfo women and children.
Then were blend­ ed prayers, tears, groans, consolation, fear, trust, hope and defpair.
Arisen, father to Chæreas, though in the extremes of decrepi­ tude, and bowed down with forrow, would yet be carried thither ;
when clasping his son’s .neck, and hanging upon it, he (weeping bitterly) cried :
To whom, my fon !
doft thou abandon wretched me ;
worn out with age, and half dead ?
for I shall never behold thee more.
Put off thy voyage for fome few days, that I may die in thy arms.
Bury me, and then fet out.
-His mother, clasping his knees, cried — O my fon !
Leave me not here, fad and inconsolable, I conjure thee;
but take me on board thy shipfor light is my weight ;
weight ;
but should I prove too heavy, then throw me into the fea which thou art going over.
Saying thefe words, she beat her breasts, and taking them forth, she cried ;
Cast thine eyes hither, and take pity on ne;
If e’er, to op thy tears, to foot he thy heart, I gave thee suck, and lull’d thee soft to rest.
Chæreas, overcome by the in treaties of his pa­ rents, threw himfelf from the ship into the fea;
that he might not be prevented from going in Search of Callirrhoe, nor torture any longer his father and mother.
The fai­ lors leapt in immediately after Chæreas, and drew him forth with much difficulty.
Her­ mocrates, feeing the multitude dispersed, or­ dered the pilot to weigh anchor forthwith ;
when a new incident happened, which exhi­ bited an act of the most generous friendship.
Poly- Polycharmus, a friend of 'haereas, had not appeared abroad, while all thefe preparations were making;
but had faid to his parents-
Chæreas is indeed my friend;
yet not to fuch a degree, as to induce me to follow him in the extremes of danger;
I therefore will conceal my felf, till he fhall fet fail.-
Now when the tide had carried the ship at a con­ siderable distance from shore, Polycharmus, showing himfelf from the stern, bid farewell to his parents;
as it would not then be in their power to withhold him.
Chæreas being got out of the harbour, and gazing on the fea, cried — Dothou (great ocean !) direct me the fame course as thou didft Callirrhoe.
And grant, (0 Neptune!) either that I may bring her back ;
or my felf never, never re­ turn ;
for I had much rather be enflaved with my wife, than not recover her.
VI.
TheVI.
The wind proved favourable to their ship ;
which purfuing almost the fame track with that of the pyrate-vessel ;
arrived, in the like number of days, in Ionia, on the beach near to Dionyfius's estate.
Now most of the people on board, being greatly fa­ tigued, went a-shore, in order to refresh and recover themselves.
Immediately they fet up tents, and brought out provisions.
But Chæ­ reas and Polycharmus roving about, and ex­ amining every thing:
the former faid:
How will it be possible for us to find Callir­ rhoe ?
for I am above all things apprehensive that Theron mull have amufed us with fal­ sities ;
and that the dear, ill-fated creature is dead ere this time.
And though she were really fold ;
who could inform us in what country ?
Asia is of a vaft extent.
While they were thus wandering, They came to the temple of Venus;
when thinking it their duty duty to pay adoration to that Deity;
Chæreas fell at her feet, and cried :
-
Thou (0 god­ defs !) didft firft blefs me, on thy festival, with the fight of Callirrhoe.
Restore to me the beauteous gift, which I before owed to thy fpecial grace and favour.
And now having ended his prayer, lie rofe;
when lifting up his eyes, he faw, on one fide of the goddess,.a golden statue of Callirrhoe ;
the offering of Dionyfius.
Infant, a tremar seizd his heart, and knees.
Chæreas now growing dizzy, he fainted away, which the priestess or woman who had the care of the temple perceiving, she brought water.
Chæreas being fprinkled therewith, and recovering, she said:
Be comforted (my son !) the goddefs has struck many others in like manner:
for the is much renowned, and and reveals herfelf in the most conspicuous manner.
But this is a very happy omen.
Doft thou fee that golden statue ?
The wo­ man whom it represents was once a Have ;
but Venus has made her mistress over us all.-
And who is she ? (resumed Chæreas.)—
She is (faid the priestess) the lady of all there lands ;
and wife to Dionyfius the firft man in all Ionia.
Chæreas was going on, when he was interrupted by Polycharmus, who being master of great coolness, prudence, and forefight, would not permit him to utter a word more;
but taking him by the arm, forced him’out of the temple ;
he not being willing to have it known, who they were, till they fhould have fully weighed this mat­ ter ;
and taken every necessary precaution.
Chæreas, while he was with the priestess, had retrained his tongue, though with infinite difficulty;
and yet he could not check fame falling falling tears;
but when he, and Polycharmus, were got far from the temple, and alone;
Chæreas, throwing himself on the ground, thus cried aloud :
—O too kind ocean !
why didst thou preserve me ?
Was it in order that I, after having been indulged a profperous voyage, might behold Callirrhoe in the em­ braces of another hufband ?
This I could pever have expected, even after the haplefs Chæreas should be no more.
Ah !
wretched me !
how shall I act ?
I fondly hoped to have brought thee from thy master:
and did not doubt but that thy purchaser, allured by the large fum I should offer him, would glad­ ly have restored thee to me ;
but now I have found thee rich ;
and perhaps a queen.
How much happier should I have been, had I even feen thee an adulterefs!
Shall I now go to Dionyfius, and fay to him;
Restore me my wife ?
But I could not accoft thee, though though we were to meet in the streets :
and what is Hill more grievous, I should not be permitted to falute thee as my country wo­ man ;
a pleafure that would be refufed to me only.
Perhaps too, I might run the hazard of perishing by being fuppofed an adulterer, with regard to my own wife.
-While he thus poured forth his lamentations, Polychar­ mus ufed his utmoft endeavours to console him.
VII.
In the mean time Phocas, under-ste­ ward to Dionyfius, Spying a ship of force, was not a little alarmed on that account;
when Showing much kindnefs to one of the bailors, he learnt, from him, who the perfons on board were, and the motive of their voyage.
He then reflected, that the arrival of this ship must be of fatal consequence to his Lord;
imagining, that were Callirrhoe to be taken from from him, he could not poffibly furvive the loss.
Bearing a great love to his master, he was extremely desirous of putting a flop to the impending evil;
and of preventing a war ;
not a mighty one, indeed, nor of a public nature, but pearly affecting Dionyfius's fa­ mily.
For this purpofe, he rode, with the swiftest fpeed, to a fortrefs, garrifoned by fome Barbarians, and fpake thus to them A ship of force has put in here, and lies hild under the ramparts, which look on the sea ;
but whether fle be a fpy, or comes in hopes of a booty, I cannot tell:
but surely it will be much for the king’s interest, that we take and plunder her, to prevent her doing mif­ chief.
Phocas prevailed with the Barba­ rians, by his fallacious arguments, to go;
and he himfelf led them in regular order.
The Barbarians then fell upon the fhip's company, who were quite unprepared for such an an attack, in the dead of night;
and throw­ ing fire into the vessel, they burnt her ;
after which they bound in chains fuch of the peo­ ple as they found alive, and imprifoned them in the fortrefs.
A partition being then made of the naves;
Chæreas and Polycharmus moli earnestly befought the victors, that they might be fold to one and the fame matter.
In compliance with this request, the purcha­ fer of both fold them in Caria ;
where drag­ ging heavy fetters, there ill fated men tilled the lands of Mithridates.
Now it happened that Callirrhoe had a dream, in which the faw Chæreas in irons ;
who would feign have approached her, but could not.
Immediately she, venting a loud, fad figh in her sleep, cried Comehither, 0 my Chæreas!—
This being the first time that Dionyfius had heard his frighted wife pronounce the name of Chæreas ;
he afked her, who that person was was whom she called upon ?
Her tears betraying her, and being quite unable to con­ ceal her distress, her anguifh burst into there words:
-Alas!
I did addrefs my hufband, he who possessed me a virgin-bride.
0 un­ happy man!
miserable even in dreams.
I faw him loaded with irons.
But thou, (most unfortunate of mortals !) didst lose thy life in fearching after me ;
for thefe chains fadly de­ note that thou art dead;
while I Rill furvive, and riot in the moft luxurious delights.
I now repofe, with another hufband, in a bed glittering with gold ;
yet I, ere long, will hasten to thee ;
for fince we could not enjoy each other, when living ;
we will join toge­ ther in death.
Dionyfius on hearing thefe words, made a variety of reflexions.
He was fired with jealousy, as Callirrhoe discovered a love for Chæreas, although dead.
He like­ wise was afraid that (he would make away with with herfelf.
On the other hand, he enter­ tamed hopes, as she seemed to fuppofe her first hufband was no more;
that the therefore would not forsake him who then enjoyed her.
In the mean time, Dionyfius strove to com­ fort, by every means poffible, his afflicted wife;
and watched her narrowly, during many days, for fear she should destroy her­ felf.
The hopes Callirrhoe entertained, that Chæreas might, perhaps, be still living ;
and that her dream was mere illufion, foftened her grief;
but chiefly her pregnancy.
She feven months after their nuptials, being de­ livered of a fon, who was fuppofed to be the offspring of Dionyfius, though Choreas was the real father.
Vast rejoicings were made, throughout the city, on this occasion.
Embassadors came from all parts, to Miletus, to congratulate Dionyfius on the aufpicious increase of his family :
and fo great was his delight, delight, that he yielded to every thing which might pleafe his wife.
He declared her mo­ ther of a family;
crouded the temples with offerings;
and after a folemn facrifice, enter­ tained the whole city at a magnificent ban­ quet.-
VIII.
Callirrhoe, being afraid that Plangon would one day discover the fecret, was there­ fore very defirous that she might be made free ;
this woman being the only perfon who knew that Callirrhoe was pregnant, the first night the cohabited with Dionyfius.
It was not merely from a principle of gratitude, that Callirrhoe requested this favour;
but alfo be­ caufe of the aufpicious change which had been wrought in her fortune.
I would willingly (faid Dionyfius, on this occafion) reward Plangon, for the ready assistance she gave to our amour:
but we were unjust, should should we honour a Have, and not offer up due thanks to Venus ;
in whofe temple we first faw each other.
I wish for this, (faid Callirrhoe) more than thou doll, I having still greater obligations to that goddefs;
but as I am yet in child-bed, let us continue here a few days longer;
and then we may retire with lets hazard into the country.
Callir­ rhoe foon recovered from the inconveniencies and pains of child birth.
Her beauty in­ creased with her strength ;
her virgin vigour being now improved to that of a mother.
When they were arrived at the villa, they found that Phocas had prepared fplendid feasts;
as a great number of people, from the city, attended them.
And now Dionyfius, the libation being made, began to offer up the Hecatomb, when he fpake thus:
—O Venus ! (my Deity!)
To thee I owe all the bleffings I enjoy:
to thee I am indebted for Callirrhoe :
to thee for my fon:
by thee P am am a husband ;
by thee a father.
I should have been contented with Callirrhoe only, she being dearer to me than my country, or my parents :
but yet I love my fon, as I thereby Secure to my felf the affection of his mother ;
and possess the sweetest pledge of her fond­ nefs for me.
I therefore befeech thee, (O goddefs!) to preserve Callirrhoe for my fake;
and the infant for her's
The croud round them accompanied this prayer with good wifhes, and joyful acclamations;
when fome Scattered rofes over them;
fome violefs ;
and others entire chaplets;
insomuch that the temple was firewed with flowers.
Dio­ nyfius had offered up his prayers with a loud voice, and fo was heard by all the people;
but Callirrhoe would address Venus in pri­ vate.
She thereupon first put her fon into the arms of the goddefs ;
when behold a groop, more exquisitely beautiful then ever painters painters drew, fculptors carved, or poets feigned :
for none of thofe artists ever repre­ sented Diana, or Minerva, holding an infant in her arms.
This spectacle drew tears of joy from Dionyfius, while he was deprecating Nemefis in filence.
Having then ordered Plangon only, to continue with her ;
he Cent back all the reft to the villa.
After the people had left the temple, Callirrhoe ad­ vancing nearer to Venus, and holding forth the child, faid :
For this infant (0 god­ dess !)
I return thee thanks, but not for my­ felf:
which I yet should certainly have done, hadst thou preferved me my Chæreas.
Thou indeed hast given me the image of that dearly beloved hufband;
and not deprived me to­ tally of him.
0 grant that this babe may be more happy than his parents, and resemble his grand- sire !
May he shine in the navy;
and being victorious on the ocean, may the public, public, exulting, cry:
The grand-fon of Hermocrates fur panes him in valour, and is a greater man.
My father will be overjoyed, in beholding a successor to his heroifm ;
and this will administer pleafure to his parents, though no longer ranked among the living.
I conjure thee, (0 Venus!) to be propitious to me, henceforward.
My fufferings have already been very great.
I have been dead to all appearance, and restored to life.
I have been in the vile hands of robbers;
have been lost to my country;
been fold ;
and a Have ;
and, what I look upon as still more grievous than all the reft, am joined to another hufband.
But, to compensate fully for all there evils, I intreat thee, and all the other Deities through thy mediation, to preserve me this haplefs orphan.
She would fain have added more, but was inter­ rupted by her tears.
IX.
Cal-IX.
Callirrhoe, after a little paufe, called the priestess, who entering faid:
(O my daughter!) why weepest thou in the midft of fo much felicity, and when even strangers worship thee as a goddefs ?
Two beautiful youths came hither, not long fince, from on board a ship which was failing this way ;
when one of them, at the fight of thy image, almost died away;
to illustrious has Venus made thee.
—These words pierced Callirrhoe to the heart;
when fle, like one distracted ;
looking aghast and with her eyes fixed, cried aloud :
—
Who were thofe strangers ?
Whence came they ?
What did they fay to thee ?
The priestess was fo terribly frighted that the, at first, remained fpeechlefs ;
but at last (he, with great difficulty, uttered there words :
— I only faw thofe youths, but did not hear them fpeak.
Of what country (faid Cal­ lirrhoe) dost thou fuppofe them, from their dress, drefs, to be ?
Call to mind their features and their mien.
The old woman then gave a description of their perfons, though not a very exact one.
However, Callirrhoe guessed who both were;
as we easily believe what we earnestly desire.
And now turning to Plan­ gon :
——Ah !
(faid she,) Should the wretched Chæreas have wandered hither!
Let us in­ stantly feek for him, but with the utmoft fe­ crecy.
—Callirrhoe going back to Dionyfius;
she acquainted him with no more than what had been told her by the priestess ;
well knowing that love is naturally over curious;
and that Dionyfius would, for his own sake, enquire very minutely into this whole affair, and fo it fell out:
He being fired with jea­ loufy, the moment he heard thefe particulars.
He indeed entertained no fufpicion with re­ gard to Chæreas ;
but was apprehenfive that fome adulterer, in order to disturb his peace, would fpread fnares in that solitude.
Cal- Callrrihoe's exquifite beauty made him suspect and fear every thing;
insomuch that he not only dreaded the artifices of men ;
but even fancied that some god would, perhaps, de­ fcend from the skies, in order to be his rival.
Dionyfius thereupon sending for Phocas:
Who (said he very earnestly) are thofe young men, and whence came they ?
Are they rich ?
are they handsome ?
Why did they worship my Venus ?
Who informed them of her being here ?
Who encouraged them to addrefs her ?
——But Phocas, standing in great awe of Dionyfius ;
and fearing that, fhould Cal­ lirrhoe be made acquainted with this affair, the would certainly ruin him, and his whole family;
he, for that reafon, concealed the real fact.
—Having then Wrongly persisted, in declaring that no foreigners had landed there :
Dionyfius began to suspect, that still deeper plots were forcing against him.
Being now inflamed.
inflamed with rage, he commanded the fcour­ ges and the rack to be brought, in order to put Phocas to the torture;
and not only him, but he likewife fent for all the peasants ;
being firmly persuaded, that fome adulterer would be discovered by means of this en­ quiry.
Phocas finding that he fhould be in danger, whether he revealed, or suppressed the fecret, faid:
(O my Lord!) to thee only I will difclofe the truth.- Thereupon Dionyfius, having commanded all the reft to withdraw ;
We now (faid he) are alone.
Take strict care that thou tell me no falfity ;
but declare the whole truth, though ever fo inauspicious.
——My Lord (replied the ste­ ward) I bring no evil tidings, but great and good news.
However,
Should the narrative, in the opening of it, be found disagreeable;
yet let not that furprize or afflict thee, but wait till thou haft heard it through ;
for it will will end happily.
Dionyfius, being all attention at thefe words, cried :
Do not delay;
but relate at once all thou haft to fay.
Phocas then began as follows :
——
A ship is just arrived here from Sicily, bring­ ing Syracufian embassadors, in order to de­ mand Callirrhoe of thee.
Dionyfius was ready to die at hearing there words, and a dark cloud overspread his eyes;
he imagin­ ing, that Chæreas was then present, and come to force Callirrhoe from him.
Now pale and livid, he lay extended like one dead ;
which threw Phocas into the utmoft conster­ nation, he not knowing how to act ;
and therefore did not dare to call for assist­ ance, left their fecret should be found out.
Dionyfius afterwards recovering, though with the utmoft difficulty, his fainting fpirits;
—— Be comforted, my Lord, (faid Phocas ;
) Cho­ reas is no more ;
the ship is destroyed ;
and all an our fears are dispelled.
—These words gave new life to Dionyfius, when reviving, he enquired very minutely into every circum­ stance.
Phocas then told him of the ma­ riner, from whom he had learnt whence the fhip came ;
who the strangers on board were, and the motive of their voyage.
Likewise the stratagem employed by him, in conjunc­ tion with the Barbarians.
He related the se­ veral transactions of that night;
fuch as their burning the vessel ;
the shipwreck ;
with their killing part of the people, and throwing the rest in chains.
This narrative difperfed the clouds and darknefs which fecmed to hang over Dionyfius's mind ;
when embracing Pho­ cas :
—Thou (faid he) art my benefactor ;
thou the true, the most faithful guardian of my fecrets, which ought never to be revealed.
To thee I owe Callirrhoe ;
to thee I owe my fon.
I did not command thee to difpatch Chæ- Chæreas ;
yet shouldest thou have given the fatal stroke, I shall not condemn thee, since thou muft have perpetrated that deed, purely out of affection to thy Lord.
-In one thing only thou haft fhewn negligence;
I mean, thy not enquiring very strictly, whether Chæreas was slain, or only caft in chains.
If thou wert certain (added Dionyfius) that he is dead;
then care must be taken of his body;
then Should it receive due funeral honours ;
and then should I recover my peace of mind ;
whereas I cannot now be perfectly happy ;
but shall suspect that he is among the prifo­ ners, we not knowing to what countries they were fold.
X.
Dionyfius having ordered Phocas to publish thefe feveral particulars (his firata­ gem, and that fome people on board the ship were still living, excepted ;
) he then went, with with a forrowful countenance, to Callirrhoe.
He afterwards assembled the peasants, whom Phocas had already prepared;
in order that whenever Callirrhoe should examine them, concerning this affair, their answers might be fuch, as would make her defpair of ever feeing Chæreas again.
The country people flocking to Callirrhoe, informed her of every circumstance, as things already perfectly well known, viz that a band of robbers (Barba­ rians) but whence they knew not, had come in the dead of night, and burnt the Sicilian ship, which had put in there the day before;
and that they faw, on the morrow, the ocean tinged with blood, and dead bodies floating on it.
Callirrhoe hearing this dismal talc, tore her garments ;
and striking her eyes and checks, she i'an up to the inner apartment, whither she had been carried when firft fold.
Dionyfius gave her an opportunity to vent fully fully her grief;
he imagining that it would augment it, Should he appear suddenly before her.
In the mean time he gave orders that every one should withdraw, Plangon except­ ed;
he thinking her pretence necessary, to prevent his wife's destroying herfelf.
But Callirrhoe, retiring to a corner, threw her­ self on the floor;
when Scattering ashes on her head, and tearing her dishevelled hair, the thus repeated her fad moan :
——It was my earned defire ( 0 Chæreas !) to die before thee, or at least to have accompanied thee to the sepulchre :
but I, as thou art no longer among the living, thai!
be forced to follow thee in death ;
for what have I to hope, or to live for ?
I was wont to foothc my sorrows with the following reflections :
——I shall one day again behold my Chæreas ;
and relate, to him, the numberlefs woes I have suffered his fake.
These will endear me still more to him.
How will he leap for joy at the fight of of his fon ?
But all there thoughts are now vain ;
and my dearer babe is a burthen to me.
Being an orphan, he but adds to my other evils.
Thou only (0 unjust Venus !)
Thou only didft fee my darling Chaereas;
yet wouldest not show him to me when prefent, and -after his undertaking fo long a voyage.
Thou next didft deliver up my lovely Chæreas into the hands of robbers.
Thou hadst no companion of the man, who, for thy fake, braved the dangers of the ocean.
What per­ fon will henceforward addrefs in prayer a god­ dess, who, herfelf, slew her humble fuppliant ?
Thou didst not fuccour, in that night of hor­ ror, a moft beautiful youth, full of affection, when murthering in thy fight.
Thou haft robbed me of my cotemporary;
my fellow­ citizen ;
my lover, on whom I doated ;
my husband.
Though he be dead, yet restore his body to me!
Suppofing that we were doomed doomed to be the most wretched of all mor­ tals ;
yet what crime against thee, could the ship, that was burnt by the Barbarians, have committed ;
that (hip which the Athenians themselves could never take ?
Our parents are now fetting on the beach, expocting our ar­ rival ;
and whenever they fpy a vessel, at a distance, they cry aloud:
See there Chæ­ reas returning, and with him his darling Cal­ lirrhoe !
They are preparing for us the nup­ tial bed ;
and adorning the bridal chamber, for him who is not allowed a grave.
0 de­ testable ocean !
Thou broughtest Chæreas to Miletus, for him to fall by the fword ;
and me, that I might be fold as a Have.
THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK.
I. c ALLIRRHOE passed that night in tears;
fhe bewailing Chæreas as dead, though he was still living.
Afterwards numbering a little, she faw, in a dream, the barbarous ruffians, running with lighted torches ;
setting fire to the ship ;
and herself herfelf fuccouring her darling Chæreas.
Now Dionyfius felt the deeper anguish at behold­ ing his wife's fad aspect;
he being afraid, that her profound melancholy would diminish the lustre of her charms, and thereby pre­ judice his affection.
He yet thought it would be of advantage to him, for Callirrhoe to ut­ terly despair of ever feeing again her first husband.
Defiling, however, to give her a proof of the violence of his paffion, and his greatness of foul, he fpake thus :
Rise (my deareft Callirrhoe !) and prepare a sepulchre for that ill-fated man.
Why doft thou eagerly purfue things impossible, and neglect fuch as are necessary ?
Imagine him to Hand before thee, and to utter thefe words
Bury mespeesily, that I may go Thro' Pluto's gates ;
and join the shudes beliw.
ThoughThough the corps of the haplefs Chæreas be not found, it is the cuftom (from an antient law of the Greeks) to honour, with a sepul­ chre, thofe whofe bodies may He elsewhere.—
Callirrhoe was eafily perfuaded, as this coun­ fel was pleasing in itfelf.
Having now an oc­ cupation, it soothed her sorrow;
when rifing from her bed, she looked about for a fpot whereon to erect the Mausolæum;
and would have fixed it near the temple of Venus, in order that fhe might raife a fecond monument of her love.
But Dionyfius envied Choreas a- place fo near to the fane;
he reserving it for himfelf;
and being desirous that she should still continue this employment.
—Let us (faid he) my dearer Callirrhoe, return to the city;
and there raise, before the walls, an empty sepulchre, fo lofty and confpicuous ;
That mariners, who view it from osar, May, by its form attracted, st p and gaze.
TheThe ports of Miletus (added he) are very fafe and commodious;
whence thy country-men, the Syracufians, frequently touch at them ;
and this ambition, to fet up a Splendid Mau­ solæum, will increase thy fame among thy fellow-Citizens.
——Callirrhoe, pleafed at what the heard, fufpended, for the prefent, her de­ sign of building the tomb.
Being afterwards returned to the city, she began to erect, upon an eminence near the fea-coaft, the sepulchre, refembling exactly her own in Syracuse, as to . form, dimenfions, and magnificence;
and built, like the other, in honour of a person who was still living.
As no expence was fpared, and a vail number of hands were employed, the edifice was foon completed ;
and the funeral obsequies were to be like thofe performed in Syracufe.
The day for this pious folemnity was publickly proclaimed.
Not only all the Milefians, but likewise moft of of the tonians, flocked in prodigious crouds to the sepulchre.
Two men of high rank happened to refide, at that time, in Miletus;
Mithridates governor of Caria, and Pharnaces governor of Lydia.
The pretence of their coming to Miletus, was to shew their respect and veneration for Dionyfius;
but their real motive was, to get a fight of Callirrhoe.
Her name was renowned, not only throughout all Afia Minor;
but it had likewise reached the ear of the great king;
an honour which neither Ariadne, nor Leda, had attained.
It was now Callirrhoe appeared more beautiful than imagination had framed her.
She came forth, clad in mourning;
her tresses flowing;
with lightning in her eyes :
And her almost naked arms feemed more lovely than thofe of the goddesses, the fnowy lustre of whofe hands, and the beauty of whofe feet, are fo highly celebrated by Homer.
No one pre- rent fent could bear the splendors which darted from her face.
Some were forced to turn afide their heads, as from a flashing fun-beam.
Many, falling prostrate, worshipped her ;
and even the little boys felt a kind of passion for Callirrhoe.
But Mithridates, governor of Caria, fell speechless on the ground, Like one, whom suddenly a stone assails, Hurl'd, from asling, by an athletic arm.
When his chief domestics, listing him up, carried him off with great difficulty.
The proceffion opened with the image of Chæreas, copied from the Intaglio in the ring;
which figure, though extremely beautiful, yet pall unheed­ ed, as Callirrhoe was present:
the only, by a kind of fafcination, attracting the eye of every spectator.
Now who could paint, in due colours, the clofe of this folemn procef­ non !
Being come near to the Mausolæum, thofe thofe who carried the funeral bed, fet it down ;
when Callirrhoe afcending it, threw her felf along on Chæreas's image, and kiss­ ing it a thousand times :
Thou (faid she) didft firft bury me in Syracufe;
and I, in re­ turn, now inter thee in Miletus.
The woes we have furred are not only very grievous, but even astonishing and almost incredible.
We have entombed each other, and yet neither of us is possessed even of the other's corps.
O envious Fortune!
Thy extreme hatred would not permit us, when deceased, to be co. vered with the fame earth ;
but ordained, that our very bodies fhould be exiles.
The whole multitude burft into wailings, and every one pitied Chæreas;
not because he was fup­ pofed dead, but because he had been robbed of so inchanting a wife.
II.
WhileII.
While Callirrhoe was thus burying Chæreas in Miletus, he, with irons on his feet, was tilling the ground in Caria.
There his body was foon emaciated, owing to the variety of his sufferings ;
to his prodigious toils ;
to his neglect of himself;
to his chains:
but much more than all there,.
to his love.
He would gladly have died then, had not fome glimmerings of hope, viz. that he might, perhaps, fec Callirrhoe once again, kept up his fainting fpirits.
His friend Polycharmus, who was his fellow slave, feeing that Chæreas, by his not being able to labour, was therefore moft (hamefully beat and abufed, fpake thus to the overfeer —Assign us a piece of ground apart, in order that we may not be blamed for the idlenefs of all the rest of the Haves;
and we then will completely plough, by an appointed day, the portion allotted us.
The overfeer granted his requeft, and marked out out a fpot accordingly.
Now Polycharmus, being very healthy and robuft, and no ways a captive to that most cruel of all tyrants, Love;
cultivated, alma!!
fingly, the ground allotted to both;
he, with the higher joy, taking this toil upon himfelf, to fave the life of his friend.
While Chasreas and Polychar­ mus were thus struggling with ill Fortune, it was exceedingly difficult for them to forget their once happy Hate of liberty.
In the mean time, Mithridates the governor return­ ed to Caria ;
not chearful and florid as when be left it, in order to go to Miletus ;
but pale and thin, like one whose heart had received a deep, though pleafing wound.
His passion for Callirrhoe thus consuming him;
he would certainly have died, had he not met with the following consolation.
Some of the slaves, who were chained with Chæreas (there being fifteen shut up in a dark dungeon) having got got off their irons, in the dead of night, and murthered their keeper ;
had attempted to make their escape, but were prevented by the barking of dogs, placed there to watch.
Being thus catched in the fact, they were all loaded, that night, with heavier irons.
In the morning, the steward informed his lord of there Several things;
when he, without either feeing them, or hearing their defence, inftantly gave orders for the crucifixion of all the Sixteen who were Imprisoned together, and charged with the fame crime.
They then were brought forth, with chains about their necks and feet;
every one carrying his crofs.
The ministers of the torture heighten­ ed the necessary punishment with all this ap­ paratus of horror, to strike the stronger ter­ ror into the reft of the naves.
Chæreas being now dragged to execution, was filent;
but Polycharmus, who bore his crofs, burn into the the following exclamation:
—— To thee (O Callirrhoe !) we owe all there fufferings.
Thou art the caufe of all our woe.
The fleward, hearing there words, imagined that fome woman was an accomplice in their at­ tempt.
In order, therefore, that she might be punished, and the contriver of there plots difcovered;
Polycharmus was imme­ diately looted from the common chain, and carried before Mithridates.
He was then in one of his pleasure-gardens ;
reliefs in body ;
greatly disturbed in mind ;
and recalling, to his memory, Callirrhoe ;
fuch as he faw her, when overwhelmed with farrow.
His foul being now full of this idea, he was offended at his Servant for coming in ;
and thereupon cried;
Why doft thou disturb me ?
My Lord !
(replied the steward) necessity forces me to it.
I having found the author of this horrid murther ;
and the abominable wretch, wretch, now brought before thee, is acquaint­ ed with the wicked woman, who was an abettor of that execrable deed.
Mithrida­ tes, hearing this, knit his brows ;
and, with a dreadful frown, fpake thus:
Inform us of the woman, who is privy to, and partner in thy guilt.
Polycharmus denied, to the Jast, his knowing any thing of that affair;
and solemnly protested, that he had no man­ ner of concern in it.
Scourges, fire, and cords were then ordered to be brought in ;
when one of the executioners, laying hold of Polycharmus:
Tell us (faid he) the name of the woman, whom thou didft here confess to be the caufe of all thy woes, —— To this Polycharmus replied :
Callirrhoe.
This name struck Mithridates ;
he imagining it bore an aufpicious resemblance to that of the Milefian fair-one.
He yet did not think it prudent to be over strict in his enquiry ;
left lest he Should thereby bring difgrace on so loved a name.
But as his friends and ac­ quaintance pressed him to fearch farther into this affair:
Let Callirrhoe (cried he) be immediately produced.-
The executioners then torturing Polycharmus:
——Who is this woman (said they:
) where is she to be found ?
-The wretched Polycharmus, being in fuch agonies that he did not know what to fay, yet unwilling to accufe any woman falsely Wherefore (cried he) do you thus torment me to no purpose;
fince you are en­ quiring for one who is not here ?
The per­ son I fpake of is Callirrhoe the Syracusian ;
daughter to Hermocrates the Prætor.
At these words a blush covered the cheeks of Mithridates, and he was all over in a sweat.
He even shed involuntary tears;
which Po­ lycharmus obferving, he faid no more;
and all the spectators continued filent, and in fuf­ pence;
pence;
they not knowing what to think on this occasion.
Mithridates recovering at last his Spirits, though with extreme difficulty
What haft thou (said he) to do with that Callirrhoe ?
And why didst thou, when ready to expire, mention her name ?—My Lord (replied Polycharmus,) the story would be long, and of no advantage to me.
Besides, I would not now trouble you with unfeafon­ able, or superfluous words;
and am afraid that my friend, who is now fixed to the crofs, will be dead before me;
and I would gladly accompany him to the shades be­ low.——
The anger of the auditors vanished in an instant;
and their animofity melted into companion.
Mithridates, efpecially, being greatly confuted, faid :
——Fear not;
thou wilt not tire me by thy narrative ;
for I am naturally humane and benevolent.
Thou mayest fafely fet forth, to me, the whole truth, truth, without omitting a single circumstance.
Tell me then who thou art, and thy coun­ try;
how thou cameft to Caria;
and by what chance thou art here in chains, tilling the ground.
But, above all, inform me con­ cerning Callirrhoe, and who thy friend is.
III.
Polycharmus began his story thus Both of us, now in fetters, were born in Syracuse.
My companion is the firft youth, in all Sicily, for rank and wealth;
and once remarkable for the beauty of his perfon.
I am of mean extraction, and yet his compa­ nion and friend.
We left our parents, and our native country, and put to fea:
I out of regard to him;
and he for the fake of his wife, named Callirrhoe;
whom Chæreas, fuppofing her dead, had interred with great funeral pomp.
After this, fome facrilegious wretches, breaking open the tomb, found her alive;
alive ;
and carrying her to Ionia, they there fold her.
Theron, who was the robber, being put publickly to the torture, confessed all there particulars.
Hereupon the Syracu­ sian commonwealth fent out a ship of war, having embassadors on board, with orders to feek Callirrhoe.
This fhip, when lying quietly at anchor near Miletus, fome barba­ rians burnt in the night;
and killed most of the crew;
after which, throwing myself, and my friend, into irons, they brought us hither, and fold us for Haves.
We bore our mif­ fortunes with fortitude and moderation ;
when fome of the captives imprisoned with us, (but who we know not) having broke their chains;
they committed the murder, for which we, by thy command, were all led to the crofs.
My companion, even when going to die, did not accuse his wife ;
but I, (alas !) overcome by the intolerable pangs, named her ;
and de­ clared dared her to have been the caufe of all our evils;
as it was for her fake, only, that we had undertaken this voyage.
He had not done speaking, when Mithridates cried aloud.
Thou meaner Chæreas !——Yes, (replied Polycharmus ;
) Chæreas my friend.
I now befcech thee (my Lord !) to order the executioner not to Separate our crosses.——
To this fad relation, tears and groans fucceed­ ed ;
when Mithridates instantly difpatched all the people towards Chæreas, to countermand his execution.
They found him just going to afcend his crofs;
all the reft having been put to death.
Thofe who were running, burft into different cries at a distance;
they roaring out, to the executioner:
Hold!
Come down !
Strike not!
Leave him !——
And now the executioner stopt his hand ;
when Chæreas, who wifhed to be freed from a wretched life, and an it!
fated paffion, de­ fended tended reluctantly from the crofs.
As the croud were bringing him along, Mithridates ran forward, and embracing him, said:
— My brother, and my friend !
Thy fullen and unfeafonable filence had like to have proved fatal to thee;
by alluring me, as it were, to the commission of an impious act.
——He instantly commanded his Servants to conduit the young men to the bath ;
next to refreth, and afterwards clothe each of them in a rich Grecian robe.
Mithridates then invited all his friends to a banquet;
and offered up a facrifice, for Chæreas's escape from death.
The guests carouzed during many hours;
their reception was very friendly;
and no­ thing was wanting to compleat their festivity.
During the course of this mirthful enter­ tainment, Mithridates, being heated by love and wine, fpake thus:
I do not (0 Chæreas !) pity thee on account of thy chains, chains, or for thy being fentenced to the cross;
but because thou waft torn from fo beautiful a wife.
Chæreas, thunder-struck at thefe words, cried :
——Where didst thou fee my Callirrhoe ?
—She is no longer thine, (replied Mithridates) but the lawful wife of Dionyfius, of Miletus;
and they have already a fon.
Chæreas, unable to contain himfelf, fell at Mithridates's feet, and cried My Lord !
Return me to my crofs.
The forcing me to live, after fo dreadful a rela­ tion, would be a still greater punishment.
0 faithless Callirrhoe !
0 most wicked of wo­ men !
For thee I was fold ;
for thee plough­ ed the ground;
for thee bore the crofs ;
for thee given up to the vile hands of the execu­ tioner :
and, while thou wert rioting luxuri- QUay, and celebrating thy nuptials, the wretched Chæreas was groaning in chains.
It It was not enough that thou (houldeft marry another man, during Chæreas's life-time, but thou alfo must become a mother.
The whole assembly began to weep, and the festi­ val was changed to a scene of borrow:
but Mithridates, only, was pleased at hearing all there particulars:
he fondly hoping, that he should thereby have an opportunity of fpeaking and acting freely, with regard to Callirrhoe, upon pretence of assisting his friend.
——It is now (faid he) night.
Let us go.
To-morrow we will talk over all thefe matters, when our heads shall be clear;
to weighty an affair requiring more leisure.
Saying thefe words,
Mithridates role from table;
when the company breaking up, he went to his ufual place of reft;
after having allotted an apartment for the Syracufian youths, and ordered servants to wait upon them.
IV.
ThereIV.
Thefe three passed the Succeeding night in deep reflexions, and not one of them could sleep.
Chæreas was exafperated, and Polycharmus soothed his anguifh ;
but Mith­ ridates was overjoyed, from the hopes that, like as in the gymnaftic exercifes, after Chæ­ reas and Dionyfius should have quite fpent themselves in wrestling together;
he, their rival, might rush in between the two com­ batants;
and, without contending, make the inchanting Callirrhoe his prize.
On the mor­ row, every one being ordered to give his opi­ nion ;
Chæreas declared,- That he was for going directly to Miletus;
and there demand Callirrhoe :
He fondly imagining that she, the Infant she faw him, would no longer con­ tinue with Dionyfius.
Mithridates faid :
Go then (Chæreas !) I would not flop thee;
and only with that thou hadst not been se­ parated, even a single day, from thy wife.
Would Would to the Gods that thou hadft never left Sicily!
but since Chance, or Fortune, who ever delights in novelty, has doomed thee to act so tragical a part;
thou must weigh things more maturely;
and conduct thyfelf with greater wifdom for the future.
The hurry thou art now in, arifes lefs from reafon than from paffion;
which blinds thee with regard to things to come;
and prevents thy acting with due precaution.
Thou art going alone, and a Granger, to a great city;
there to force away, from a perfonage of immenfe wealth, and the first in all Ionia, a wife united to him, purfuant to the most facred laws, and by the most folemn ties.
What man, how rich, how mighty foever he may be, can affift thee ?
Hermocrates and Mithridates, thy only two powerful friends, are at a great distance from thee;
and fo circumstanced, as to be able only to bewail thy misfortune, not to give thee thee fuccour.
Befides, I am afraid that a place, where thou hast undergone fuch a va­ ricty of fufferings, could not but be still in­ aufpicious;
and that infinitely greater evils would then await thee :
for though thou waft bound in chains in Miletus, yet thy life was Spared ;
and though fold for a slave, it was I who became thy matter.
But Should Dio­ nyfius hear, that thou art laying snares, in order to take his wife from him, what Deity could then fhield thee from his fury ?
Thou mightest be delivered up to the tyrant;
on which occafion no one would (perhaps) be­ lieve thee to be Chaereas ;
and even, fuppo­ ling this poffible, thou wouldest be expofed to yet greater danger, on that very account.'
Thou only art ignorant of the nature of Love;
that God delighting in artifice and fraud.
I therefore would adviCe thee, firft to found thy wife by letter;
to know whether she she has not banilhed thee from her memory, and would quit Dionyfius ;
or rather, Increase the house of the illustrious man, To whom she's join'd in Hymen'j rosy bands.
Write (I fay,) to her.
Let her grieve:
let her rejoice:
Let her seek thee:
Let her call thee.
I will take care that thy letter be Safely delivered.
Go then and write.
——Chæreas being afterwards alone, he, in compliance with Mithridates's advice, was going to pour forth his grief;
but was prevented by his faft-flowing tears, and the tremor of his hand.
At laft, after bemoaning his fad fate, he began his letter as follows :
Chæreas to Callirrhoe, greeting.
——I live, and owe my life to Mithridates, my patron, my bene­ factor ;
and thine (I hope,) alfo.
I was fold in Caria, by Barbarians;
who burnt the noble ship ship (the admiral's) which thy father com­ manded.
With regard to the reft of my fel­ low citizens, I know not what is become of them.
Myself, and Polycharmus my friend, were going to execution, when both were snatched from the jaws of death, by the mercy of our matter.
Mithridates, who la­ vished every kindnefs upon me, afterwards struck a poniard into my heart, when he in­ formed me of thy fecond nuptials.
Being born a mortal, I naturally expected to die;
but could never have imagined, that thou wouldeft have given thyfelf to a fecond hufband.
Re­ pent, and change thy mind, I conjure thee on my knees;
I now bedewing this letter with my tears, and killing it a thousand times.
I am thy Chaereas;
he whom thou didst be­ hold when a virgin, and going to the temple of Venus ;
the man for whore fake thou didft pafs fo many sleepless nights.
Call to mind the the bridal chamber ;
and that mystical night when we gave each other the strongest testimo-
Dies of chaste and inviolate love.
I indeed have been guilty of jealoufy.
This is natural to lovers;
but then I have attoned for it by my fufferings.
I have been fold ;
I have groaned in captivity ;
I have dragged the ignominious chain.
Do not then treafure up too tena­ ciously in thy memory, the hafty and most unfortunate blow I heedlesly gave thee ;
fince I have been exposed, for thy fake, to the hor­ rors of the crofs, without once accusing thee.
If Chæreas is not yet blotted from thy me­ mory, all my fufferings will be as nothing:
but Should I be forgot, this must prove, to me, as a Sentence of death.V.
Mithridates delivered this letter to Hy­ ginus, his most faithful fervant, and the fuper­ intendant over all his possessions in Caria ;
and to to him he difclofed his fecret paffion for Callir­ rhoe.
Mithridates himfelf wrote a letter to her, fetting forth his regard for, and the at­ tention he had shown her, in preserving Cho­ reas for her fake.
He advifed her not to flight her sirft hufband;
offering to march an army to Miletus, in order that herfelf, and Chaereas, might be happily revered to each other, in cafe this met with her appro­ bation.
He difpatched three other fervants with Hyginus ;
they carrying precious gifts, and a great fum of money.
The three do­ mestics were told, (to prevent their suspect­ ing, or being suspected) that Mithridates had rent thofe presents to Dionyfius.
Hyginus, on his arrival at Priene *, was commanded to leave his companions there;
when himfelf was to go to Miletus, under the character of an Ionian, as he was a perfect master of the Greek Greek language;
and, after acting there as a fpy, and getting all the information possible, for his better conducing the affair;
he then was to fetch the other three, from Priene to Miletus.
Hyginus fet out, and acted pur­ suant to his orders.
However, Fortune would not permit this fcheme to be executed, in the manner it had been projected;
but gave rife to incidents, still more important.
Hyginus, being gone to Miletus, the servants whom he had left in Priene, having now no director, and gold at command, they began to live in the most profufe manner.
In a fmall city (Priene) abounding with Grecian curiosity;
this Perfian-like luxury, of the servants, could not but draw every eye upon them i and strangers, who thus pampered themselves, were naturally confidered as robbers, at leaft as fugitive Haves.
The governor coming to their inn, found, after the most strict search, a great a great quantity of gold ;
and abundance of very precious trinkets, and other female orna­ ments;
when he, fuppofing them to be Hole, asked the fervants ;
who they were, and where they had got all thofe things ?
The men, dreading the torture, declared that Mi­ thridates, governor of Caria, had rent thofe feveral articles as prefents to Dionyfius;
and then shewed him the letters.
The governor did not break them open, they being fealed ;
but delivering them to the ferjeants, with the gifts and the Servants, he fent them all to Dionyfius;
thinking he should thereby give him the strongest restimony of his friendship.
Dionyfius had then, at his table, the most noble citizens ;
and the banquet was vastly splendid.
Mufic, both vocal and instrumen­ tal, was heard;
when a Servant delivered to him the letter, whofe purport was as fol­ lows:
— —Blas, governor of Priene, to Dio­ nysius nysius his friend, greeting:
The gifts and letters feat thee from Mithridates, governor of Caria, were going to be defiroyed, by the wicked fervants intruded with them;
for which reason I Seized, and Cent them to thee.
——Dionysius read this letter aloud in the midst of the company;
he being delight­ ed with the presents, which were worthy of a king.
He then ordered the other letters to be broke open, and would have read them ;
when perceiving these words,—Chæreas to Callirrhoe.
I live:
Instant his knees were with a tremblingseiz'd:
Dimm'd were his eyes, and icy-cold his heart.
And though ready to faint, he yet held faft the letters, for fear fome other perfon should read them.
The fright which the family and the guefts were in, occasioned by this melan­ choly accident;
and the noife they made in hurry­ hurrying up and down, brought Dionyfius to himfelf;
when being fenfible of his fad perturbation of mind, he ordered his fer­ vants to carry him to another room ;
that he might be alone and undiflurbed.
Upon this, the company broke up in the utmoft confu­ sion >
they fuppofing that he had been Seized with an apoplectic fit.
Dionyfius being at last recovered, read over the letters again and again;
during which his foul was agitated by different passions;
he raging one moment and defponding the next:
now oppressed with fear;
now not believing;
for he could no ways imagine that Chæreas was still living, the bare supposition of which would have been death to him :
but he suspected, that the whole was an adulterous artifice employed by Mithridates, in order for him to seduce Callirrhoe.
VI.
Here-VI.
Hereupon Dionyfius caufed his wife to be more strictly watched, in the day-time ;
to prevent any one from approaching, or bringing her the lead tidings from Caria.
He now meditated the following revenge.
There happened very luckily to be then, in Miletus, Pharnaces governor of Lydia and of Ionia;
who was considered as the chief of thofe whom the king of Persia intrusted with the fway of the provinces of Alia Minor.
Dionyfius went to Pharnaces, he being his friend, and defired a Secret conference with him.
Being alone:
——My Lord, (faid he,) I befeech thee to aid no lets thyself than me.
Mithridates the worft of men, and who en­ vies thee, having lately been my guest;
now trampling on the laws of hospitality, is laying fnares to disturb my conjugal felicity, by send­ ing a letter, and a large fum of gold, to my wife, with a view to corrupt her.
——Dio­ nyfius nyfius then drew forth the letter, and reading it, informed him of the whole stratagem.
Pharnaces listened with pleafure to this dif­ course;
and, poffibly the more fo, on account of Mithridates ;
they being at variance, and having frequently quarrelled, occasioned by the vicinity of their provinces;
but much more, becaufe they were rivals in love :
for Pharnaces alfo was Wrongly enamoured with Callirrhoe;
and, for her fake, would go very often to Miletus;
and there entertain Dio­ nysius and his wife in banquets.
Pharnaces promised to assist him with all his might;
and then wrote the following letter in cypher —
Pharnaces, governor of Lydia and of Ionia, to Artaxerxes his fovereign Lord, greeting:
Dionyfius of Miletus, who, with his whole family, have ever been thy faithful subjects, and most zealoufly attached to thee and to thy house;
declared to me, with tears, that Mi- Mithridates governor of Caria, whom Dio­ nysius had hospitably entertained, now at­ tempts to deduce Callirrhoe his wife.
This conduit reflects dishonour on, or rather is highly prejudicial to thy interest, as every injustice, in a governor, is blame-worthy;
but efpecially the deed here complained of.
Dionyfius is the most powerful man in all Ionia ;
and the beauty of his wife is fo exceed­ ingly renowned, that it will be impossible for such an outrage to be kept fecret.
This letter being brought, the king read it to his friends;
and commanded them to give their several opinions upon it ;
which being taken, they were found to vary very much.
Thofe who bore ill-will to, and envied Mithridates, or wanted his government, declared ;
that a man who endeavoured to draw away, by the most insidious arts, the wife of a perfon of the first rank, ought by no means to be fpared.
spared.
But others of a more humane dispo­ sition, and who respected Mithridates (and there were numerous and powersul) oppofed the removal, by calumny, of a man of strict honour.
As therefore the opinions were di­ rectly opposite, the king did not then deter­ mine;
but referred the matter to a future day.
Night being come, Artaxerxes reflected with indignation, on the conduct of a man, whofe duty it was to maintain the honour of his fovereign.
He alfo revolved, with pain, an action, which, Should it pars unnoticed, would fhow that Mithridates might difobey the royal orders with impunity.
The mo­ narch was thereupon for fummoning Mithri­ dates -to take his trial;
but another passion prompted him to command the appearance of the beautiful woman at the fame time.
Love, and the Shades of night, were his only coun­ sellors in thofe lonely hours:
and brought strongly strongly to his remembrance, that part of the.
letter which expatiated on the wonderful charms of the fair one.
The report which had long prevailed, at court, of there being, in Ionia, an exquifitc beauty called Callirihoe, inflamed the king Hill more;
and he only blamed Pharnaces for not having mentioned her name in his letter.
Yet being in doubt, whether there might not be a female, Hill more lovely than her who was so highly ex­ tolled :
he therefore judged proper to sum­ mon her, at all events, likewise.
The king thereupon wrote thus to Pharnaces:
Send Dionyfius the Milefian, my fervant, to me.—
And in manner following to Mithridates:
—— Appear :
and prove that thou haft not employ­ ed ,artifices, to seduce the wife of Dionyfius.
VII.
Mithridates was thunder struck at the order, and could not conceive what might t have have given rife to this accusation;
when Hy­ ginus returning, told him all that had be.
fallen the Servants.
Mithridates now finding that he had been discovered by his letters, re­ solved, after the moft ferious reflexions, not to go to the king;
whore anger, and the virulence of calumny, he equally dreaded.
He therefore determined to feize upon Mile­ tus ;
to kill Dionyfius, who had caufed his fummons ;
to carry off Callirrhoe;
and laflly, to rebel against his fovereign.
But where­ fore (faid he) should I fly, to give up my liberty into the hands of Artaxerxes >
Per­ haps I may conquer all thefe difficulties, by flaying at home:
for the king is at a great distance.
But then he may fend out his ge­ nerals, to oppose me.
Befides, should he bring any other charge against me, I could not fuffer more than I now do.
Be this as it will, I muft not, in the mean time, give up up two important articles;
my love, and the government of my province.
The title of prince, is pompous on a Mausolæum ;
and it were fweet to die with Callirrhoe.—
While he was thus debating within himself, and preparing to rife up in arms againft Artaxerxes, he received advice, that Dionyfius was gone from Miletus, and had taken Callirrhoe with him.
Mithridates was more deeply afflicted at this news, than at the fummons for him to take his trial.
Bewailing then his wretch­ ed fate —With what hopes (cried he) do I continue here ?
Fortune is my enemy whi­ therfoever I go.
Perhaps Artaxerxes, as am innocent, will have compaffion on me.
But should I be fentenced to die, I then shall again behold Callirrhoe;
and Chæreas, with Polycharmus, will not only be my advocates, but alfo my witnesses, at the trial.
Hav­ ing commanded his retinue to attend him, he he left Carla with the most pleating hopes;
from a consciousness of his not having injured any one.
And now the Carians accompanied him, not with tears, but with victims and a fplendid train.
Such was the proceffion Cu­ pid fent from Caria.
But that which he dif­ patched from Ionia, was still more auguft;
it being heightened by inchanting beauty.
Fame flew before, founding forth to the world the approach of Callirrhoe;
that univerfally extolled name;
that renowned mafter-piece of nature To golden Venus like, or bright Diana.
The rumour of the trial rendered her still more famous.
Whole cities went forth to meet her;
the ftreets, wherever she passed, were crouded with spectators ;
and she ap­ peared still more beautiful than imagination or fame had painted her.
Yet all there ap- plauses, plaufes, and invidious praifes, ferved only to torture Dionyfius;
and his Supreme felicity Served but to fill him with still greater appro­ hensions.
Being a man of learning, he knew the ficklenefs of the amorous God, who ever delights in novelty;
for which reason poets and fculptors afcribe to him darts and flames both there being the lightest things in nature, and ever volatile.
He alfo recalled every ancient story ;
with the fate, and the many vicissitudes to which beauties have been fub­ ject.
There reflections terrified Dionyfius.
He looked upon all men as his rivals;
not only his adversary, but likewife his judge.
Hence he repented his having communicated the accufation, fo precipitately, to Pharnaces;
as he otherwife might have lived undisturbed, in the embraces of his darling wife:
and have kept her much more eafily to himfelf, in Mi­ letus, than when roving up and down Alia.
He He yet did not discover, to the laft, this Se­ cret to any perfon;
nor inform, even his wife, of the motive of their journey;
but pretended, that the king had rent for him, to confult him upon the affairs of Ionia.
In the mean time Callirrhoe was grieved, to travel at fo great a distance from the Grecian fea ;
for, while the harbour of Miletus con­ tinued in fight, she imagined herself near to Syracufe:
not to mention, that the fight of Chæreas's sepulchre was a great consolation to her.
