These notices are introduced incidentally and in no ostentatious manner.
They come in quite natur­ ally, and without offence to good taste.
From them we learn that Horace's father was a libertinus, or freed slave, a member of the Horatia tribus in Apulia, as is supposed-hence the name.
The future poet was born in 65 B.C. at Venusia, now Venosa, in Apulia, on the confines of Lucania, and so he says of himself " Lucanus an Appulus anceps."
Why he was called Flaccus is not known.
As his father gained his freedom before the boy's birth, young Horace was an ingenuus, or freeborn Roman citizen.
His father was a coactor, that is, either a collector of taxes for the state, or one who took the payments at auction sales.
Whatever his occupation may have been, he seems to have early laid past a little money, which enabled him to buy a small property at Venusia, and to give his son the education of a Roman gentleman.
1
We know nothing of his mother individually.
She had probably died when he was very young.
At all events he makes no reference to her, except as one of his parents, with whom he was quite content, and whom he would not have changed for greater and richer ones if he had had the choice.
2
She may have been to him the type of that Apulian woman whom he praises in Epode ii.
39, sqq.Horace's early education was conducted at Rome under Orbilius Pupillus of "thrashing notoriety," with whom he studied grammar and some of the old Latin authors.
He also read Homer with the same master, and acquired with various teachers some of the modern accomplishments" of those days, such as music and rhetoric.
But Horace's father was not content that his son should finish his education under Orbilius.
Athens was in those days the University of the world, and to Athens accord­ ingly the lad was sent, when he was about twenty years of age, to study philosophy and literature, and to improve himself in Greek.
There he met many young men belonging to the best families in Rome, pursuing their higher education as he was, and with some of them he formed a lifelong friendship.
There, also, the tenor of his life was suddenly changed by the events that followed on the assassination of Julius Cæsar.
Brutus and Cassius called at Athens on their way to the Eastern Provinces which had been assigned them, and while Cassius went on to Syria, Brutus loitered for a time in the city ostensibly to hear the lectures of some of the philosophers, but really, it would seem, to enlist on the re­ publican side as many as possible of the " young bloods" of Rome then "in residence."
It was here that Horace received his appointment as Military Tribune, for which he was by no means fit.
But his soldier life was of short duration.
The battle of Philippi took place in 42 B.C., and there he was obliged to run for his life, like others, and leave his shield behind, as he tells us in apparent soberness, though it may be a mere joke against himself.
He is the only authority for the occurrence of the un­ soldierly act.
Before he was called off with Brutus to the war he is said to have visited many parts of Greece, to which he has made some passing references in his writings.
When Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Octavianus and Antony, and the Republican party were thoroughly discredited, and the men of law and order came into power, an amnesty was proclaimed, and under its kindly leave Horace among many others returned to Rome.
But he came back penniless and fatherless, as his property at Venusia had been confiscated, and his good old father had passed away, probably during his absence.
But curiously enough he does not refer to the sad event, as we should have expected.
For some time after his return to Rome he seems to have supported himself by " writing, for the booksellers," pieces of a satirical kind which made him many enemies.
But ere long he gained the post of Scribe or Quæstor's clerk, either by purchase or by the interest of friends.
Greater prosperity, however, was in store for him.
He was intro­ duced to Maecenas by Virgil and Varius, probably about 40 B.C.1
It was nine months, he tells us, before Maecenas invited him to his house, but when he once became a guest, he made his way to the heart of the Minister almost imme­ diately, and from that time forth the friends were all in all to each other till death separated them.
During the next year after this he formed one of the party which made the famous "Journey to Brundusium," the events of which are duly recorded in Sat., I. v.Horace had a house in Rome, and a moderate 11 establish­ ment " in which he could receive friends, even Maecenas, with suitable appointments.
But he much preferred a country life, and so spent a large part of the year away from the city.
To this change of residence we owe his beautiful and touching descriptions of scenery, and of honest country people and their simple ways (Epode ii., &c.).
On the other hand, he takes no pains to conceal his dislike of the din and bustle of mighty Rome, and of the vice and frivolity of life in the city as compared with the purity of morals and staidness of character of the peasantry (Ode iii. 6).
The passages in which he treats of the worries of town life and the joys of the country are among the most charming in his writings.
It was about 33 or 32 B.C. that Maecenas gave Horace a present of the small Sabine estate, or farm, to which he so often makes reference.
It lay mostly in the valley of Ustica, about 30 miles from Rome, 12 from Tibur, and 4 from Varia, the nearest small town or village.
Its quiet seclusion had a great attraction for the poet, whom it always if set up " again when wearied with society in Rome, and with all the turmoils and interruptions of the busy town.
There he seems to have spent the happiest days of his life.
1
On the farm he had a steward, eight slaves, and five resident families.
His style of living both in Rome and at his Sabine farm was simple, frugal, and temperate.
In the country he employed his time in reading, writing, strolling about and enjoying the hills, the streams, the woods, and doing a little on his farm or in his garden.
He revels in the pleasures of the place, and speaks with deep affection of the fountain of Bandusia, the stream Digentia, the rocks, the glens, the lowing oxen, and the browsing goats.
He was a lover of nature in all her aspects, and he had a kindly heart for man and for beast.
Praeneste, Tibur, and Baiæ were favourite places with him for a temporary residence.
See his own description of his life in the city in Sat., I. vi. 112, sqq.
In one of his touching Odes (Bk. II. xvii.) he declares that when Maecenas dies he will not remain behind­ they will take the last journey together;
and so it came to pass that Horace died only a few weeks after his faithful friend and patron, to whom he delighted to address ode after ode.
They were buried near one another on the Esquiline Hill.
Maecenas introduced Horace to Augustus, and with him also the poet became a favourite.
It was at the request of the Emperor that Horace composed the Carmen Saeculare for the celebration of the games of 17 B.C.
Of this duty he was,, no doubt, justly proud.
Augustus wished him to become his private secretary, but he declined on the ground of health.
In person he was small of size, and in advancing years rather stout.
In youth his hair was black, but he became early grey:
his eyes were weak and liable to inflammation.
As a young man he was attentive to his appearance, Quern tenues decuere togæ nitidique capilli, but grew rather careless as life advanced.
His temper, by his own account, was hasty, but he was easily appeased.
He had his faults and failings, but even these still leaned to virtue's side.
In some of the Odes he seems to represent himself as a libertine, but these are thought to be mere imitations of his Greek models, and not applicable to his own life.
He never married.
Horace does not pose as a man superior to his neigh­ bours, though he says 11 Odi profanum vulgus," in a special application :
nor does he bore us with his own affairs, but gives us only so much that we should like to hear more.
He often refers to his humble origin, and also to his being the friend of the rich and great, but never in such a way as that we should be inclined to dub him either a " bully of humility," on the one hand, or a tuft-hunter and a snob, on the other.
He is a plain, unsophisticated, sensible man, who gains our confidence by the simple, quiet way in which he refers to himself, his life, and his friends.
The two or three occasions on which he speaks of him­ self somewhat egotistically, as in Ode xx.
Book II., and Ode xxx. Book III., do not outweigh the general and consistent character which he maintains for modest humility.
The former Ode seems to have been a mock heroic reply to an invitation from Maecenas;
and the latter a humorous imitation of similar self-laudations by Sappho and Ennius.
It has been stated in the Life of Horace that after his schoolboy days were over he went to Athens to pursue higher studies in philosophy, and to cultivate a more thorough knowledge of Greek Literature.
In following out the latter object, he seems to have read much of that Lyric poetry of which Alcæus and Sappho were leading repre­ sentatives, and which, it would appear, had a special charm for him.
This, as it turned out, gained him his lasting fame.
When the desire took hold of him to adapt the strains of Italy to the Æolian Muse we know not, as he has not told us;
but it would seem that he had written much after his return to Rome before he began to transfer the metres and subjects of the Greek Lyricists into Latin Odes.
The improvement in his style of writing, which arose from his great practice in satiric composition, induced him, it is said, to put forth all his powers in Lyric poetry, as suiting his taste, and as being a novelty in Rome.
This he did for seven years.
In the first six he sent forth the first three books of the Odes.
A fourth followed soon afterwards.
These Odes, being the product of his riper years, are generally considered to be the most perfect and most polished of his writings, in the matter of form at least.
They give proof of maturity of mind and judgment, of a keen insight into life and its important conditions and relationships, rather than of poetic inspiration of the highest type, or of exuberant imagination.
In the Odes the language is generally polished, the thoughts lucid in conception, the diction terse, and the metres remarkable for beauty and harmony.
But occasion­ ally we meet with phrases and sentences of a prosaic kind, and with extravagances inconsistent with Horace's usual good taste.
When Horace speaks from the heart and with his natural fire, as he does in Odes of a national and patriotic kind, such as the second of the First Book, he rises to real beauty and even to grandeur;
but if his subject has been proposed to him, and he is expected to write " to order," the result is very different:
—and naturally so, as common sense and experience will readily admit it must be.
Horace's first attempts would necessarily be translations, or at least mere imitations, of his Greek models.
Others are independent compositions in Greek fashion, and others again original subjects from the public life of Rome and Italy, or on the private affairs of his friends.
The Odes may be classified as follows:
(i) national and patriotic;
(2) friendly;
(3) amatory.
There are many others of a miscellaneous kind, dealing with the beauties of the country;
with virtues, personal and social, with old Roman character and heroism, and with ancient legends of gods and men.
It is in the first of these that Horace appears to most advantage.
In them he breathes forth in words of fire his ardent love of fatherland and home;
he proclaims with honest pride the past glories of the state;
and with un­ bounded admiration he recalls the uprightness and the honesty of the good old days.
On the other hand, he deprecates in sad and warning tones the defection from ancient standards which he sees is taking place, the decay in morals and in military spirit, and the deterioration of his fellow-citizens in all those qualities which went in olden times to form a Roman of the highest type.
But he is little less happy when he dwells on the charms of rural life and scenes, as in the second Epode, of modera­ tion, of contentment, of the shortness and uncertainty of life, and the inevitable foot of Death, " which knocks alike at poor man's hut and prince's hall."
He felt what he said, and the genuine feeling of a right-thinking man must always show itself to advantage in what he writes.
The teaching and the practice of his excellent father had much to do with the creation in the poet of that respect for goodness and that contempt for tinsel and sham which Horace so powerfully expresses.
His love for the country, his inter­ course with the simple-minded, self-reliant, and pure-living peasantry of the Sabine hills, fostered and intensified in him that spirit of sturdy independence and of admiration for the good and noble which characterises his best poems.
On the other hand, the tendency which that spirit has always shown to degenerate into vulgarity, rudeness, and bluster, was kept down in him by his kindly nature, by his rational common sense, and by the refined society of that literary circle in which he moved at Rome.
His amatory verses, though pretty and graceful, and sometimes exquisite in thought and expression, are wanting in depth of fervour, of devotion, and of high moral feeling.
This is no doubt largely owing to the fact that they are, for the most part, mere adaptations of Greek poems, and did not spontaneously flow out from his own head or heart to any real person towards whom he had the honourable and sincere feeling of love.
A few (a very few) of them, again, are offensive, both in tone and wording.
In Odes to friends, however, Horace is more at home than in those just referred to.
These have the true ring of genuine affection and heartiness of feeling.
As an example of this, the Ode to Varus (II. vii.) may be instanced.
In it there is no reserve in his joyous welcome, no halting in his words of friendly greeting, and no stint or grudge in the offer of his cask of wine.
His whole soul is filled with the earnest desire to receive his old companion in arms with the warmest hospitality, and to do him every honour.
He is even prepared " to play the fool a bit" at this happy meeting.
His Odes to Maecenas, Virgil, Varius, and others of his intimate friends, are equally hearty and sincere.
In such as these his lovable nature shines brightly out in every line.
No less apparent is the master hand when he descants on Nature in her soft and gentle form, or in her wilder moods of storm by land or sea.
He speaks with rapture of Bandusia and its icy draughts;
of brooks that hurry down their tortuous course with babbling noise;
of meadows with their velvet sward and new-blown flowers;
of cool and winding glens where goats have shelter from the Dog-Star heat;
of lovely Tibur with its woods and wimpling rills;
of soft Tarentum and its climate's charms;
and of Galæsus' peaceful stream, "dear to the coated sheep."
He speaks, too, of Garganus' oaks lashed by the eastern gale ;
of restless Hadria and its mountain waves to fury roused by tyrant Auster and his boisterous squalls;
of the torrent river with destructive flood;
of Mount Soracte and its snow-clad peak;
and of Caucasus, whose cliffs and frosts and snows repel the foot of man.
Whatever be his subject, Horace is natural, moderate in tone, graphic in description.
It is little to be wondered at that Horace is a favourite with all his readers, and that his memory is cherished as that of one whom we have intimately known, and whom we still fondly love.
His works are a storehouse of maxims for everyday life, and of quotations fitted for use in almost every department and every phase of human action.
Maecenas, scion of a race of kings, my guardian patron and my cherished pride, some glory in the course to raise Olympic dust in clouds, and them the goal,1 scarce shunned by glowing wheels, and the ennobling palm, raise to the heavens as very lords of earth.
Others are proud of heart if fickle Romans haste to the polls, to vote them honours manifold:
others, if in their barns they hoard whatever is swept from Libyan floors.
Him who is pleased to cultivate his father's fields with hoe or spade, you never will induce by wealth of Attalus to leave his farm, turn sailor, and in ever-present fear to plough Myrtoan seas with Cyprian keel.
The trader, when in alarm he sees the south wind battling with Icarian waves, commends his native village and its quiet plains;
but anon his shattered bark refits, unschooled to bear the pinch of stinted means.
Some scorn not cups of Massic wine, nor do they grudge to steal a portion of the busy day, now stretched at length beneath an arbute green, now by some fountain's gently bubbling spring.
Life in the camp has charms for many, and the trumpets blare, mixed with the clarion's note, and wars to mothers hateful.
Ne'er thinking of his gentle wife the hunter braves the chilly air the livelong night, if by his trusty hounds a stag is spied, or Marsian boar has burst his well-made toils.
Me the ivy crown, badge of the learned brow, admits to converse of the gods:

But if you place my name among the lyric bards, I'll strike the lofty sky with towering head.
Enough of snow, enough of direful hail has Jove sent down, and smiting with his red right-hand " temple and tower," has terrified the city and the tribes of men lest Pyrrha's baleful Age should come again, strange portents to deplore, when Proteus led his herds to visit mountain tops, and fish of every kind on highest elms were caught, where once the doves had made their nests;
and timid does swam on the surging seas.
The yellow Tiber we have seen, with waves hurled back from Tuscan shores, rushing in fury to bear down old Numa's kingly monuments and Vesta's holy shrine:

Our youth, now thinn'd through parents' crimes, shall hear that citizens 'gainst citizens have whetted swords, by which 'twere better the dread Parthian died.
Which of the gods shall we invoke to save the fortunes of the falling state?

To whom shall Jove assign the task to expiate our guilt?0, come at length, we pray, Augur Apollo, thy beauteous form in robe of vapour clad :
or if thou wish it rather "laughter-loving" Venus come, round whom at all times Mirth and Cupid flit:

That man had heart encased in oak and brass of triple folds who first committed to the savage deep his brittle bark, nor feared the squally sou-west battling with the north, nor yet the gloomy Hyades, and raging force of Notus, than whom no sterner tyrant lords it over Hadria's waves, whether he wills to raise or lull by calm, the narrow seas.
In what shape would he fear grim death's approach, who, with a tearless eye, was wont to view the hideous forms of floating monsters and gaze upon the heaving deep, and those Ceraunian rocks of ill-repute ?
In vain did heaven's care dissever land from land by ocean's churlish flood, if yet those godless ships bound madly in contempt o'er channels not allowed.
Mankind, for ever bold all hardships to exhaust, run headlong through forbidden crimes.
Old Japhet's daring race brought fire to men by fatal theft.
Soon as the fire from heaven was filched, wasting decline and unknown hosts of fevers dire brooded on earth, and Death inevitable, before far off and slow of gait, quickened his pace.
Daedalus, with wings denied to man, essayed the airy void:

Nought is too hard for man :
in our folly we assail the very heavens, nor by our crimes do we permit great Jove to lay aside his bolts of wrath.
Now is sharp winters grasp relaxed by grateful change to spring and zephyrs, and now the rollers draw to sea the dried-up hulls, and neither do the kine delight in stalls nor ploughmen in the fire:
nor are the meadows white with hoary frost.
Now Venus of Cythera freely trains her choirs, the silver moon overhead, and lovely Graces, hand in hand with Nymphs, beat earth in time with rhythmic feet, while Vulcan, in his eager zeal, makes all the heavy forges1 blaze.
Now is it meet to deck the well-trimmed head with leafy myrtle, or with the flowers which loosened earth supplies.

Pyrrha, what slender youth, bedewed with liquid scent, plies thee with love beneath some charming grot, midst many a rose ?

For whom dost thou, in simple elegance of dress, bind up thy golden hair ?
How oft, alas !
shall he bewail thy broken faith and his changed lot, and unused to guile shall gaze with wonder upon seas, ruffled by darken­ ing winds, who, too confiding, now enjoys thee, all golden in his eyes :
who, ignorant of the changing breeze, hopes thou wilt still be his alone, ever lovely, ever free.

The temple's sacred wall by votive tablet shows I've given my dripping garments to the god who rules the sea.
By Varius, a poet of Mæonian strain, thou shalt be sung as brave thyself, as conqueror of thy foes in every action which thy gallant corps, when led by thee, have fought by sea or land:

I whether fancy free, or touched by love, in lightsome mood of banquets sing;
and of maidens battling 'gainst their swains, with nails well pared.
Others may praise the sunny Rhodes, or Ephesus, or Corinth with its double sea, or Thebes by Bacchus made renowned, or Delphi by Apollo famed, or Tempe, sweet Thessalian vale.

In Juno's honour many a one will tell of Argos for its chargers known, and of Mycenae with its hoards of gold:
me not patient Lacedaemon nor Larissa's fertile plain has smitten with such charm as sweet Albunea's echoing home, and Anio in his headlong course, and Tibur's grove, and orchards watered by the flowing rills.
As Notus often from the darkened sky sweeps off the clouds and does not always pour down rain, so if you're wise, fail not to banish sadness, and by mellow wine beguile the toils of life, my Plancus, whether the camp bright with its banners hold you, or your loved Tibur's darkling shades.
When Teucer fled from Salamis and from his father's house, 'tis said he bound his temples, wine bedewed, with poplar wreath, and thus addressed his downcast friends :
Wherever Fortune, than my sire more kind, shall guide our way, we go, my partners and my comrades;
despair not while your Teucer leads and Teucer's star is guide :
for Phoebus, ever true, has said that in another land shall rise another Salamis of dubious name.
Brave men who oft with me endured far worse than this, dispel your cares with wine:

Pray tell me, Lydia, in heaven's name, why haste you by your love to ruin Sybaris ?
Why does he fly the sunny Campus, well able to endure the toil and heat ?
Why rides he not, as soldier should, among his peers, to train his Gallic steed with barb-armed bit ?
Why does he dread to touch the yellow Tiber ?
Why shuns he oil more carefully than viper's blood, and why does he fail to show us arms made black and blue by weapons' use, he, once so famed for discus and for spear cast far beyond the mark !
why skulks he out of sight, as once they say did Thetis' son on eve of Troy's sad bloodshed, lest man's attire should drag him forth to slaughter and to face the Lycian bands ?
You see how Mount Soracte soars in view, all white with deep laid snow, and how no longer do the wearied woods bear up their load, and how by piercing frost the rivers stay their course.
Dispel the cold with plenteous logs laid on the hearth, and from the Sabine cask, friend Thaliarchus, more freely draw the wine, now four years old.
All else leave to the gods, for soon as they have lulled the wind's fierce struggling on the seething deep, the cypress shakes no more, nor yet the aged ash.
What the morrow in its course shall bring, forbear to ask, and all the days that fate may grant set down as gain, and in your youth shun not the sweets of love, nor pleasures of the dance, so long as peevish age still spares your bloom.
Now let the Campus and the Square be sought at night's approach, and gentle whispers at the trysted hour:
now, from the secret comer let the tittering laugh be drawn which tells of hiding maid, and let the forfeit from her arm be snatched or from her finger, coyly loath.
O
Mercury of fluent speech, fair Maia's son, who, by the use of words and by the graceful gymnast's art, did'st mould the savage ways of early men, thee will I sing as messenger of mighty Jove and first inventor of the curved lyre, clever to hide in sportive theft whatever pleased thy whim.
Once when Apollo sought by threatening voice to terrify thy boyish mind, if thou did'st not restore the cattle ta'en by stealth,-finding his quiver gone he laughed himself.
And Priam too, thy guidance given, left Ilium with a load of wealth, and passed unseen the ruthless sons of Atreus, the warder-fires of Thessaly, and all the camp on Troy's destruction bent.
In the abodes of bliss thou lay'st to rest the spirits of the just, and with thy golden wand dost gather-in the airy crowd-dear as thou art to gods above and gods below.
Leuconoe, oh ask it not-thou may'st not know-what term of life the gods allot to me, and what to thee, and Chaldee tables scorn to touch.
How much by far 'tis better to endure whatever betides.
Whether great Jove more winters gives, or this, the last, which on confronting rocks exhausts the force of Tuscan seas, be wise, and strain the wine, and by the thought of life's brief span curtail the hope of lengthened days.
Even while we're speaking, churlish time is gone:
enjoy the present hour, trusting but little in to-morrow.
What man now living, or what hero gone, dost thou elect, O Clio, to sing of on the lyre, or the shrill-toned pipe?
What deity?
Whose name shall sportive echo call in shady bounds of Helicon, on Pindus' heights, or on the icy Haemus?
Whence the woods in random course followed the tuneful Orpheus, as by his mother's art he stayed the rapid flow of streams and flight of winds;
sweetly per­ suasive, too, to lead along, by his melodious lyre, the listening oaks.
What should I sing before the wonted praises of great Father Jove, who guides the affairs of men and gods, who sea and land and sky by change of seasons rules?
From whom nought is produced greater than he, and nought exists equal in might, or holding second place:
Pallas, however, has gained the honours next to his.
Nor shall I pass thee by in silence, Bacchus, brave in battle, nor thee, 0 virgin goddess, foe of savage beasts, nor thee, 0 Phoebus, dreaded for unerring shaft.
Alcides, too, I'll sing, and Leda's sons-this for his horses known, that for his boxing famed:
when once their kindly star has shone with brightness on the sailor's path, the foaming water back from the rocks descends, the winds are lulled, the clouds disperse and threatening waves lie mantling on the deep, because they so have willed.
I know not whether, after these, I first should tell of Romulus, or Numa's peaceful reign, or Tarquin's tyrant rule, or Cato's noble death.
Of Regulus I'll speak with grateful heart, and of the Scauri with especial praise, of Paulus lavish of his manly soul, that day of Punic victory­ and of Fabricius brave.
Him and Curius with locks unkempt, mighty in war, and great Camillus too, did cruel poverty bring up, and a paternal farm with house to suit.
As grows the tree, by lapse of time unmarked, so grows Marcellus' fame:
The Julian star shines out conspicuous as does the moon among the lesser fires of night.
Father and guardian of the human race, thou son of Saturn, to thee has been assigned by fate great Cæsar's weal:
still may'st thou be our sovereign lord, with Caesar next in power.
He, under thee, shall rule the spacious world with equity, whether he lead in " triumph just" the humbled Parthians, or the Seres and the Indians, who skirt the land that hails the rising sun.
Thou with thy thundering car shalt shake Olympus :
thou shalt hurl thy angry bolts against the groves, the haunts of orgies vile.
When you admire the lustrous neck and snow-white arms of Telephus, ah, Lydia, my heated liver swells with bile, so hard to treat.
Ah, then my mind is ill at ease­ my changing colour comes and goes, and o'er my cheeks the teardrops flow, proving by what a torturing fire my soul is slow consumed.
I burn with rage, should brawls by wine made fierce have marred your snow-white shoulders, or some impassioned swain have with his tooth left on your pretty mouth a lasting mark.
If you give heed to me, you must not hope that he will be a constant friend, who with his boorish rudeness wounds those sweetest lips, which Venus has imbued with her own nectar's better parts.
Thrice happy they, and more than thrice, whom an un­ broken bond of love unites, and whose affection, unruffled by the curse of strife, shall ne'er be broken till their latest day.
a ship of State, fresh billows are about to bear you back to sea!
Oh, pray, what mean you ?
Boldly take the port.
See you not your side is stript of oars, your mast and yards are moaning, smitten by the fierce south­ west, your hull, without a girding rope, can scarce withstand the too imperious sea?
Your sails are not entire, nor are your gods unharmed, whom you may call on when by disaster threatened once again.
Good pine of Pontus though you be, and daughter of a noble wood, you boast your race and name in vain:
the sailor in his fear puts not his trust in gaudy poops:
unless you're bound to be the sport of winds, be on your guard.
You who were late to me a source of vexing grief, but now of fond regard and no light care, avoid, I pray, the shoals which lie among the Cyclades, that shine so fair to view.
As o'er the deep the faithless shepherd bore his hostess Helen, in ships on Ida hewn, old Nereus lulled the rapid winds in an unwelcome calm that he might tell stern fate's decrees.
With evil omen to your home you bring a guest whom men of Greece with numerous hosts shall seek again in compact sworn to burst your nuptial bonds, and break in pieces Priam's ancient realm.
Alas !
alas !
what toil to horses, what to men is looming near at hand !
What scenes of death do you prepare for all the Dardan race ?
Already Pallas tries her helmet and her aegis and her car, and whets her martial rage.
In vain self-confident in Venus' guard you'll curl your locks and on unwarlike harp troll songs which women love to hear:
in vain in private chamber you shall try to shun the heavy spears and shafts of Gnosian reed, and battle's din, and Ajax swift to pursue:
but yet at last you shall defile in dust the locks of an adulterer.
See you not Laërtes' son, the ruin of your race, and see you not the Pylian Nestor?
Fearless warriors press upon you—Teucer of Salamis, and Sthenelus well- skilled in war, or, if need demands, a charioteer of spirit keen:
Meriones you shall as surely know.
Lo, fierce Tydides, brave father's braver son, madly scours the ranks to find you out, whom you in cowardice shall fly from with panting loud, as does a stag, regardless of its grass, from wolf when seen far off in yonder vale—that's not the promise to your darling given.
Achilles' sulking fleet shall stay the hour of doom for Ilium, and for Phrygian matrons:
after the destined years Achæan fire shall burn the homes of Troy.
O daughter, than fair mother fairer still, if you will, and as you will, bring my accusing verses to an end, either by fire or in the waves of Hadria.
Nor Cybele, nor Pythian Apollo, dwelling in his priests, can in the sacred shrine so agitate the mind as gloomy anger does:
not Bacchus, not the Corybantes, when with redoubled blows they beat their cymbals shrill:
it neither Noric sword dismays nor ocean's wrecking storm, nor lightning's wrath­ ful flash, nor Jove himself when bursting upon earth in crashing peal.
Prometheus, it is said, being forced to mingle with our primal clay a morsel drawn from every source, added-on the lion's fury to our temper's heat.
Angry passions whelmed Thyestes in a grievous thrall, and proved the first and the abiding cause why lofty cities perished to their base, and why triumphant hosts drove deep the ploughshare through their ancient walls.
Re­ strain your passion;
me too in happy youth did anger's glow assail and madly urge to quick Iambics.
But now I seek to change the bitter for the sweet, provided that, my taunts withdrawn, you once again become my friend and set my mind at ease.
Faunus in rapid flight oft leaves Lycæus for Lucretilis with all its charms, and ever from my goats wards off the fiery heat and rainy winds.
Straying throughout the sheltered groves the she-goats seek unharmed the hiding arbute and the fragrant thyme, nor do the kidlings fear the lively!
snakes or wolves of Mars, so soon, my Tyndaris, as the valleys and smooth rocks of sloping 2 Ustica have echoed with the dulcet pipe.
Me do the gods protect;
my deep devotion and my song are pleasing to the gods.
Here Plenty, rich in all bounties of the field, shall stream for you from Fortune's teeming horn.
Here in some winding vale you shall avoid the dog-star heat, and on your Teian lyre sing of Penelope, and beauteous Circe,—two on one hero bent.
Here you shall quaff beneath the shade the harmless cups of Lesbian wine, nor shall the son of Semele, great Bacchus, engage in conflict with the god of war, nor shall you, through his jealous thoughts, fear rudeness from the wanton Cyrus, lest on your weaker frame he lay his hands in violence, and tear the chaplets clinging to your hair, and rend your dress not meriting his wrath.
Varus, around the walls of Catilus and in Tibur's genial soil, see that you plant no tree before the sacred vine.
Those who abstain from wine deem hard all tasks and trials sent by Heaven, and by nought but wine are gnawing cares dispelled.
Who after plenteous wine-cups prates of war as toilsome, of poverty as grievous ?
Who, father Bacchus, does not rather speak of thee-of thee, too, lovely Venus ?
But that we pass not moderation in our draughts, the con­ flicts of the Centaurs and the Lapithae, fought over wine, give warning:
the heavy hand which Evius on the Thracians laid gives warning too,-when in their greedy thirst they sever right from wrong by the thin line of their own selfish lusts.
Thee, Bassareus, 11 ever fair and ever young," I will not 'gainst thy wish disturb, nor will I drag to light what lies concealed by leaves of many kinds.
Stay the harsh cymbals and Berecynthian horn, which blind self-love attends and foolish Vanity that holds too high by far her empty head, and Faith that blabs her secrets, transparent more than glass.
The imperious mother of the Cupids, the son of Theban Semele, and wanton Freedom bid me turn my mind again to loves I had given o'er.
The brilliant beauty of fair Glycera who shines more bright than Parian marble con­ sumes my soul:
her charming forwardness inflames my heart and her face too dangerous to gaze on.
Venus, rushing on me in all her might, has quitted Cyprus, and will not let me sing of Scythians and of Parthians fiercely brave on flying steeds, or of other things which bear not on my themes.
Bring here, my lads, some fresh cut turf, some vervain and frankincense, with a bowl of wine, now two years old;
a victim slain, the goddess will with gentler influence come.
From unpretending goblets you shall drink plain Sabine wine, which laid in store in Grecian jar mine own hand sealed, dear knight Mæcenas, that day when in the theatre you were received with cheers so loud that your .
ancestral stream from all its banks, and sportive echo of Mount Vatican gave back your praise.
Drink, if you will (at home) prime Cæcuban and vintage pressed in vats of Cales;
(but) no Falernian vines nor Formian hills impart a flavour to my cups.
Ye tender maidens, sing Diana's praise, ye boys sing Cynthius ever young,1 and Leto, fondly loved by Jove supreme.
Ye maidens sing of her who in the streams delights and in the foliage of the groves whatever they be that show to view on chilly Algidus, in Erymanthus' dusky woods or Cragus, ever green.
Ye boys extol with equal praise sweet Tempers vale, and Delos, birthplace of Apollo ;
sing of his shoulder with a quiver decked, and with his brother's lyre.
'Tis he that by your prayers moved will from our people and great Caesar drive away to Persians and to Britons, all tearful war, and famine's scourge, and direful plague.
Fuscus, the man " whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure," needs neither Moorish javelin nor bow nor quiver filled with venomed shafts, whether he means to stray o'er Afric's burning sands, or o'er the heights of savage Caucasus, or through those parts which great Hydaspes, with his storied wonders, laves.
For while all free from care I stroll in Sabine wood beyond my wonted bounds, and sing the praises of my Lalage, a wolf fled from me though unarmed -such monster as not Daunia, in war renowned, ere reared among its groves of oak, nor such does Juba's land pro­ duce, that arid nurse of lions' brood.
Place me in dreary plains where not a tree is roused to life by summer's breeze -what part of earth dense fogs and an unhealthy sky afflict;
place me beneath the sun-God's car too near to earth, in lands denied to man's abode, yet still my Lalage's sweet smile, sweet prattle, I shall ever love.
You shun me, Chloe, like some little fawn that in the pathless mountains seeks its anxious dam, not free from groundless fear of breezes and of woods.
For whether spring has by the rustling leaves noted her advent, or lizards green have moved aside the brake, she trembles both in knees and heart.
And yet I follow not like savage tigress or Gætulian lion to rend you limb from limb.
For marriage duties fully ripe, now cease at length your mother to attend.
In grief for loss of one so loved why should we spare our tears or blush that they should flow ?
Teach me the strains of woe, Melpomene, to whom thy father Jove has given a clear and tuneful voice and harpist's skill.
Ah!
then, a never-ending sleep o'erpowers Quintilius;
and when shall modest Worth, unsullied Honour, sister of Justice, and candid Truth his equal ever find?
He's dead!
by many good men wept;
by none more truly wept than by yourself, 0 Virgil.
You, alas !
with vain affection ask from the gods Quintilius not lent you on such terms.
But could you with more potent melody than Thracian Orpheus did, attune that lyre to which the trees gave heed, the blood would never to the empty shade return, which Mercury, deaf to all prayers to open wide the doors of Fate, has with his dismal wand once forced to mingle with the gloomy throng ?
'Tis hard:
but patience mitigates what heaven forbids to change.
Now wanton youths more rarely shake your bolted windows with repeated blows, nor do they rob you of your sleep, and your door which once with greatest ease its hinges moved, now to the threshold clings :
now, less and less, you hear the plaint, " Sleep you, Lydia, while I, your gallant, pine away the livelong dreary night ?"
You, in your turn, when old and slighted, shall in some lonely alley wail the insolence of saucy rakes, when northern blasts more fiercely whistle at the change of moon :
whilst burning passion and the lust which maddens mares shall rage around your fevered liver, not without complaints because the youth take more delight in verdant ivy and the darkling myrtle, and commit the withered leaves to Hebrus, Winter's fitting mate.
Sadness and fear will I, the Muses' friend, entrust to wanton winds to bear away to Cretan seas, caring nought by whom the king of that cold region at the Pole is feared, or what now proves a source of dread to Tiridates.
Pimplea sweet, who in fresh springs1 hast thy delight, wreathe sunny flowers and weave a chaplet for my Lamia.
The honours paid by me, apart from thee, avail not:
thee and thy sister Muses it becomes to sound his praises on the Lesbian lyre in strains unheard before.
To fight with cups contrived for pleasure's use is fit for Thracians only :
begone the savage play and save the modest Bacchus from all bloody broils.
With wine and lamps how ill accords a Persian sword !
Repress, my friends, those shouts profane, and on your elbows rest.
Do you wish that I too take a share of harsh Falernian ?
Let the brother of Opuntian Megilla say by what wound and by what shaft he dies a happy death.
Do you hesitate to tell ?
On other terms I will not drink.
Whatever fair one wins your heart she lights a flame for which you need not blush,—you always show your failing in a freeborn love.
Whatever it be, confide it to my faithful ears.
Ah, wretched youth, deserving of a better flame, in what a whirlpool do you labour still ?
What witch, what wizard with Thessalian drugs, what deity himself can save you?
Bound as you are to triple-form Chimaera scarce Pegasus himself will set you free.
Archytas, you who measured earth and sea and sands that know not number, the lack of tiny doles of dust detains on the Matinian shore, nor does it aught avail that, death- doomed as you were, you soared to heaven's gates and scanned in thought the circle of the globe.
The guest of gods, great Pelops' sire, has died, and old Tithonus to the skies transferred, and Minos, confidant of Jove:
the nether world the son of Panthous holds, a second time sent down to Orcus, although-his share in Trojan war being proved by shield re-claimed,-he nought had given to gruesome death but skin and flesh, no mean authority, as you admit, on physical and moral truth.
But Night, one and the same, awaits us all, and Death's dread avenue must once be trod.
Some do the Furies fling to Mars' grim sport:
the greedy sea becomes the sailor's grave:
the funerals of young and old crowd thick on one another:
no head has ever Proserpine the stern let slip.
Me too has Notus, fleet comrade of Orion in his downward course, overwhelmed amidst Illyrian waves.
But, sailor, grudge not, in churlish mood, to cast upon my bones and still unburied head some trifling portion of the shifting sands, and if you do, whatever storm the east wind threatens to the western waves, I pray that forests of Venusia be lashed, while you are safe, and that rich blessings may descend on you in plenty from friendly Jove, from whom by right they come, and from great Neptune, guardian of Tarentum's sacred walls.
Think you lightly of a crime entailing penalties in after days on guilt­ less sons ?
A well-earned punishment and retribution stern may overtake yourself:
1 I shan't be left with curses un­ fulfilled, and you no offerings will release.
Though hastening on, throw dust three times, it won't take long, then you may go your way.
And is it true, friend Iccius, that you look with envious eyes on wealth of Araby, and that you meditate a bloody war against Sabæan kings, as yet unconquered, and are forging chains to bind the savage Mede?
What damsel of barbarian birth, her lover slain, shall be your servile mate ?
What courtly page with perfumed hair, well-skilled in aiming Seric arrows from his father's bow, shall bear your wine cups ?
Who now shall say that rapid rivers from the heights come down cannot flow back to mountain tops, and that the Tiber is unable to reverse his course, when you who promised better things are bent on changing for Iberian mail the treasured works of great Panætius, and Socrates' whole school ?
O Venus, Queen of Cnidus and of Paphos, beloved Cyprus for a time desert, and migrate to the beauteous home of Glycera, inviting thee with plenteous incense.
And with thee bring without delay the glowing boy, thy son, the Graces and the Nymphs with loosened zones, and Mercury, and Youth but little pleasing when apart from thee.
What favour does the poet from Apollo beg on this the dedication day ?
What asks he, as from the bowl he pours the new-made wine ?
Not teeming corn-lands in Sardinia's fertile soil, not sleek and healthy herds in warm Calabrian glades, not gold or Indian ivory, nor meads which Liris, peaceful stream, with quiet waters eats away.
Let those to whom the vine by Fortune has been given, check it by prun­ ing with Calenian knife, and let the wealthy merchant drain from cups of gold the wine he barters for rich Syrian wares -surely beloved by very gods, since thrice and four times in the year he braves in safety the Atlantic main.
My food is olives, endives and the wholesome mallows.
Son of Latona, grant me to enjoy the goods I have, with health and strength of body and of mind, and that I be not doomed to pass old age unhonoured, or unsolaced by the lyre.
We are called on for a strain.
If ever 'neath the shade in hour of leisure I have sung with thee a sportive lay which may survive for this year and for more, come, my lyre, now sing a Latin song, thou first by Lesbian citizen attuned;
who keen in war, yet in the heat of arms, or had he moored his storm-tossed ship on wave-lashed shore, sang Bacchus and the Muses too, and Venus, and the youth who's ever at her side, and Lycus, for beauty known, with eyes of darkest hue and hair of " glossy black."
0 Lyre, glory of Phoebus, favourite at board of Jove supreme, sweet solace of men's toils, give ear, be kind to me whenever I duly call.
O Albius, grieve not too much at thought of heartless Glycera, and pour not forth your piteous plaints, because, despite of plighted faith a younger swain outshines you in her eyes.
Lycoris of the narrow brow is fired with love of Cyrus, while Cyrus turns aside to Pholoë hard of heart.
But sooner shall she-goats mate with Daunian wolves than Pholoë give ear to base admirer.
So Venus sees it good, who loves in cruel irony to join beneath her brazen yoke those ill-assorted both in body and in mind.
Even me myself, though sought by maid of nobler rank, the slave-born Myrtale held fast in pleasing bonds, more powerful than waves of Hadria that moulds in curving bays Calabria's shores.
While led by " witless wisdom's " cant I wandered from the track of right, and served the gods with rare and churlish dues;
now I am forced to change my course and tread again the path I left :
for Jove whose wont it is to cleave heaven's misty veil with flash of fire, has driven through a cloudless sky his thundering steeds and flying car:
by which dull earth, and lively streams are shaken, and Styx, and dreaded home of hateful Taenarus, and Atlas, limit of the world.
The Deity can raise the low to high estate, can bring the great to nought, and magnify the humble.
From one with piercing cry and rapid swoop
Fortune removes the kingly crown, and takes delight to place it on another.
Goddess, who rulest Antium dear, able with instant power to raise frail mortal man from lowest state, or turn proud triumphs into funeral pomps;
thee, the poor tiller of the soil implores with anxious prayer:
thee, all who tempt in a Bithynian ship the dangers of Carpathian waves adore as ruler of the main.
Of thee the savage Dacian stands in awe, of thee the Nomad-Scythian, cities too and tribes of men, and warlike Latium, mothers of foreign kings, and princes in their pride of purple, lest with destroying foot thou overthrow their settled state, and lest the crowding mobs should rouse the passive and should raise the cry, " to arms, to arms ";
and end their term of power.
Thee ever stern Necessity precedes, and in her iron hand she bears huge nails and wedges, nor is there lack of griping clamp and molten lead.
Thee Hope attends, and Faith, so rare, in veil of white, nor does she cease to be thy escort, although in changed attire thou leav'st in wrath the mansions of the great.
But fickle crowds and faithless hirelings slink away, and when the casks have to the dregs been drained even friends are off, not true enough to share another's woe.
O save our Caesar as he goes against the Britons at earth's utmost end and shield the bands of new made warriors, a terror to the East and to the Indian Sea.
Ah!
woe our scars, our guilt, our brothers slain !
What do we shrink from now, hardhearted men ?
What have we left untouched, in our impiety ?
From what, through any fear of gods, have Roman hands refrained ?
What altars have they spared ?
Oh that on anvil, new and fresh, thou wouldst re-forge our swords, for war with the Massagetæ and Arab tribes!
With incense now and with the lute and with the promised blood of votive steer 'tis a delight to thank the guardian gods of Numida, who safe from far Hesperia come, deals many greetings to his comrades dear, but more to none than to his much loved Lamia, in memory of their schoolboy times with the same master passed, and of the toga which they donned together.
Let the auspicious day not want its mark of white, and let no stint be placed on opened jar, no slacking of the dance in Salian form;
and let not Damalis who loves her cups beat Bassus in a Thracian draught, and let not roses fail the feast, nor lasting parsley, nor the lily soon to die.
All will turn on Damalis their gloating eyes, but Damalis will not be parted from her newest swain, clinging more closely than the wanton ivy.
Now must we drink, now must we beat the floor with tripping foot;
this was the time, my comrades, to load the temples of the gods with sumptuous repasts.
Before, it was an impious act to bring from our ancestral bins the good old Caecuban, while yet a foreign queen devised mad schemes of ruin for the city, and death to our sovereign sway, with a vile herd of followers, loathsome with disease, (she) wild enough to hope for anything, and drunken with sweet Fortune's draught.
But one ship only from the flames preserved her frenzy tamed, and Cæsar brought to real fear her mind by wine of Marea distraught, pursuing her in ships while far from Italy she fled (as hawk pursues the timid dove, as nimble hunter tracks the hare in snowy plains of Thrace), that to chains he might commit the fatal1 monster.
But seeking by a nobler death to die she neither feared the sword, as woman might, nor made in rapid sail for coasts remote.
She even dared with countenance un­ moved to see again her ruined halls, and boldly handle angry snakes that in her frame she might imbibe fell poison's draught, emboldened by a stern resolve to die, disdaining to be led " unqueen'd" in haughty triumph in Liburnian ships-a woman she of no mean dignity.
All Eastern show I hate, my boy;
chaplets with linden bound are not my taste:
seek not the spot where roses linger late.
To the myrtle's simple grace I will not that with zealous care you add a single spray:
You it befits attending me;
me it becomes as underneath a tiny bower my wine I sip.
The civil strife which with Metellus rose, the causes of the war, its follies and its crimes, its phases and the freaks of Fortune :
the fatal leagues of chiefs, and arms besmeared with streams of blood, not yet atoned,—(such themes) you handle, a work which swarms with dangerous risks, and you tread on fires by deceptive ashes hid.
Let the Muse of stately tragedy for once desert the stage.
Thereafter, when you have set in order due events of public life you shall resume your tragic buskin, and your noble task, 0 Pollio, the well-known help of sorrowing clients, and of the senate in its anxious debates—you, for whom the laurels in Dalmatian triumph won have earned immortal fame.
Even now with threatening noise of horns you stun our ears, now the clarions bray, and now the flash of armour scares the war­ horse to the point of flight and on the face of riders paints dismay.
Even now I seem to hear of great commanders stained with no ignoble dust, and every part of earth subdued-but not stern Cato's will.
Juno, and all the gods who, friendly to Libya, had fled from Afric soil, unable to avenge her wrongs, have slain as victims on Jugurtha's grave the grandsons of his victors.
What plain enriched by Latin blood, fails by its mounds to show our impious battles, and bears not witness to the fall of Italy, which even the distant Parthians heard ?
What gulfs, what rivers know not of our mournful strife ?
What sea has not been dyed by Daunian gore ?
What shore is left unstained by Roman blood ?
But, froward Muse, leave not thy sportive themes, nor stir again the notes of Cean dirge:
nay, rather seek with me the measures of a lighter strain beneath some grot to Venus dear.
Crispus Sallustius, foe to wealth that gains not lustre by well-ordered use, silver when hidden in the niggard earth is void of beauty.
Proculeius, famed for a fathers kindness to his brothers shown, shall live beyond the term of life:
him shall a lasting fame bear upward on a wing that dare not droop.
If you suppress the thought of greed, your sway shall have a farther reach than should you join all Libya to distant Gades, and both Phœnicias obey you as their only lord.
Dire dropsy grows apace by self-indulgence, nor is the thirst dispelled, unless the evil's cause flee from the veins, and from the pallid frame the languor, of the water born.
True wisdom, which sides not with the common herd, exempts Phraates from the roll of blest, and teaches man no more to use unmeaning words, assigning crown and kingdom and a lasting bay to him alone who views great piles of gold without a " lingering look behind.
"Forget not in adversity to keep an even mind, as well as one restrained in prosperous days from vaunting joy, 0 Dellius, bound as you are to die, whether you've spent your life in constant grief, or resting in some grassy nook have blessed yourself in festive times with riper jars of old Falernian.
Why do the lofty pine and silver poplar join in fond sympathy their friendly shade?
Why does the fleeting stream toil ever on in bustling haste adown its tortuous bed ?
Bid wine be brought and ointment, and the grateful rose's flower so soon to die, while means allow, and age, and the sisters' dismal threads.
From pastures bought, from city home, and from your country house by yellow Tiber washed, you must depart:
depart you shall, and then your heir shall gain your riches, now piled up so high.
It matters not if born to wealth, a son of ancient Inachus, or if a pauper and of lowest grade you dwell beneath the open sky,—'tis all the same, you are a victim doomed to unrelenting Orcus.
To that same fold we all are gathered;
the lots of all are shaken in the urn, bound to come forth, belt soon or late, and place us in the bark for an exile whence "no traveller returns.
"Xanthias, show not a blush of shame because you love a handmaid.
Before your day the slave Briseis by her beauteous face moved proud Achilles' heart to love.
By Tecmessa's captive form the soul of Ajax, son of Telamon, her lord, was stirred.
Atrides in the height of triumph was fired to passion by a maiden, spoil of war, what time the barbarous troops before Achilles fell, and Hector's death gave over to the wearied Greeks the walls of Troy an easier prey.
It may be that the noble sires of Phyllis with the auburn locks shall do vou honour as their son:
no doubt she wails some royal race and gods estranged.
Think not that one beloved by you has from the worthless commons sprung, or that she, so loyal, so averse to gain, could from a mother come of low degree.
By her charms untouched I praise her arms, her features, and her well-turned limbs:
suspect not one whose age now hastens to complete his forty years.
She cannot yet, her neck untamed, endure the marriage yoke, nor share a partner's toils, nor take a mate bent on the joys of love.
The heifer's mind is busied with the grassy meads, now soothing in the streams the scorching heat, now charmed to frisk and frolic with the calves among the willows of the marsh.
Check your desire for grapes unripe.
Soon shall the autumn by its changeful heat clothe the rich clusters with a purple bloom.
Soon she shall seek you of her own free will.
For time uncurbed runs on, and will accord to her those years she takes from you:
and soon with brow all unabashed shall Lalage a husband court:
beloved by you—not coyish Pholoë so much, nor Chloris, with shoulders white as when the moon without a cloud shines forth upon the midnight sea;
or even as Cnidian Gyges, whom if you place in maidens' choir, the difference, concealed by flowing locks and girlish mien, would cheat in wondrous way the sharpest guest.
Septimius, ready to come with me to Gades, and the tribes of Spain, untaught as yet to bear our yoke, or to the savage Syrtes where the Moorish waters ever seethe:
may Tibur, by Argive settlers built of old, become the home of my old age, the limit of my weary wanderings by sea and land, and in the tented field.
But if the cruel Fates forbid that spot, then shall I seek Galæsus' stream, dear to the coated sheep, and fields that own Phalanthus' sway, from far Laconia driven.
Of all the lands of earth that nook has sweetest charms for me, whose honey yields not to Hymettus' combs, whose olives vie with those of green Venafrum:
where Jove vouchsafes to man mild winters and long springs, and Aulon, friendly to the fruitful vine, needs not to envy the Falernian grapes.
That plain and those delightful heights invite both you and me;
there you shall wet with tear-drops due the still warm ashes of your poet friend.
Pompeius dear, of all my comrades first and best, oft brought with me to dire extremity when Brutus was our leader in the war, who has restored you to your country's gods and skies of Italy, a man of peace once more ?
In company of whom I often killed with wine the lingering hours, my hair bedecked with garlands and with Syrian per­ fume bright and sleek.
In company with you I felt Philippi and its headlong flight, and left behind my tiny shield­ 'twas not a warrior's act-when Valour's self was crushed, and even the boldest were compelled to touch the earth with grovelling chin.
But me in terror and concealed in clouds the son of Maia bore aloft through thickest of the fight, while you retreating waves drew back to war in boiling surf.
Then render to great
Jove the offerings vowed, and underneath my bay tree's shade recline your body wearied by the toils of war :
and see you spare not casks, laid past for your return.
Fill to the brim the polished cups with Massic juice that care dispels, and on your head pour ointment from capacious conchs.
Whose task is it to weave in haste some chaplets of the myrtle green, or celery fresh pulled ?
Whom shall the Venus-cast proclaim as chairman of our rout ?
I shall revel in my joy, wild as any Thracian can :
my friend regained, it does me good to lose my head.
If punishment for broken oaths, Barine, had ever done you harm :
had you become more plain from tooth or nail by speck deformed, I could believe your word.
But soon as you have bound by vows your traitor head, out you flash again in beauty fairer than before, and sally forth, the common toast of all the men.
It serves your purpose well, it seems, to swear what's false by buried ashes of your mother dear, and by the silent stars of night and all the host of heaven, and by the gods who never know cold death.
Venus herself, I vouch, but laughs at it, the guileless nymphs but laugh, and Cupid pitiless as is wont, still whetting fiery darts upon the stone all red with blood.
Nay more, our youths are growing up to be your prey;
another band of slaves is coming on ;
nor do your former lovers threatening oft, desert their heartless despot's roof.
All matrons dread you for their sons:
all old men, jealous of their hoards, abhor you;
and women newly wed are wretched lest the breeze 1 which favours you should turn their lords aside.
Rain pours not always from the clouds upon the squalid!
fields, nor do the gusty winds for ever lash the Caspian sea, nor in Armenian lands, friend Valgius, does the ice inactive stay through all the live-long months, nor do Garganus' oaks for ever groan 'neath northern blasts, nor is the ash at all times of its leaves bereft.
You always wail in mournful strains your Mystes from you torn, nor do you cease your fond regrets when Vesper comes, nor when he flies the striding sun.
Yet that old man, who lived three ages through, deplored not all his days his loved Antilochus, nor did his parents and his Phrygian sisters for ever mourn the boy Troilus.
Then cease, I pray, soft-hearted plaints, and rather let us sing our Cæsar's new-won trophies;
sing of Niphates bound by frost;
and how the river of the Medes, just added to the conquered tribes, rolls onward with its lessening waves;
how the Geloni, in their narrowed plains, range only in the bounds we set.
Licinius, more safely shall you guide your life by neither pressing out to sea, nor always hugging close, in dread of storm, the dangerous shore.
The man who loves the golden mean escapes2 the squalor of a crazy hut, and wisely shuns a courtly hall which nought but envy brings.
Oftenest is the tallest pine tossed by the winds, and lofty towers fall with a heavier crash, and lightning smites the highest peaks.
A mind well-balanced hopes in adversity for better times, and in prosperity it fears reverse.
'Tis Jove who hideous winters brings again;
'tis he too who removes them.
If we fare ill to-day, it will not always be so:
sometimes Apollo with his lyre wakes up the silent Muse, nor does he always bend his bow.
Approve yourself in straits a man of spirit and of pluck :
and wisely too take in your bulging sails, filled by too fair a breeze.
What warlike Spaniard plots, what the Scythian with Hadria's flood to keep him back, intends, stay not Hirpinus to inquire, nor worry for the wants of life that little needs.
Sleek youth and beauty fly away, while sapless age expels our sportive loves and ready sleep.
The vernal flowers present not always equal hues, nor does the moon for ever shine with blushing face :
Why do you strain your mind which cannot grasp the counsels of eternity ?
Why don't we rather, while we can, lying at random thus beneath some lofty plane or fir, indulge in wine, our whitening locks with roses fragrant and with Syrian perfumes wet ?
Bacchus dispels all gnawing cares.
What slave will quickly cool the cups of strong Falernian in the passing stream?
Who to our retreat will coax the wanton Lyde ?
Come, bid her hasten with her ivory lyre :
and bind her hair like Spartan maid in plain and simple knot.
Seek not, I pray, that to my harp's soft strains I should adapt the wars of fierce Numantia, or of stubborn Hannibal, or the Sicilian main, purple with Punic blood;
or savage Lapithæ, Hylæus over-charged with wine, or those subdued by mighty arm of Hercules, Earth's giant sons, whose dangerous charge caused Saturn's glittering halls to tremble to their base :
but you, Mæcenas, will tell in prose great Cæsar's wars, and better will describe how necks of threatening kings were led in triumph through the streets of Rome.
The Muse has willed that I should celebrate Licymnia's sweet songs, your mistress dear, her brightly sparkling eyes, and faithful heart with true and mutual love, who condescends to bear her foot with grace into the dance, and on Diana's day to join in sportive mirth, and playfully encircle with her arms the maidens in their holiday attire.
One lock of fair Licymnia's hair you would not change, I ween, for all that rich Achaemenes possessed, or Mygdon's fabled wealth in fertile Phrygia, or Arab homes with treasure stored;
while to your kisses warm she turns her neck, or with coy cruelty declines :
who is more pleased that they be ta'en than even he who claims them, and who at times is first to snatch them quickly ?
'Twas an unlucky day he planted you, whoever did it first, and 'twas with unholy hands he reared you up to be the ruin of posterity, and to disgrace the countryside.
That man, I verily believe, would readily have broke his fathers neck, and smeared with blood of guests his holy shrines:
he dealt with Colchian poisons and with every crime which villany conceives, who set you up, and in my very garden too, ill-omened trunk, to fall upon your masters un­ offending head.
Man never is forewarned enough from hour to hour what danger he should shun.
The Punic sailor dreads the Bosphorus, and fears not sudden fate from other source:
the soldier dreads the Parthian's arrow and his rapid flight:
the Parthian, a Roman prison and its iron chains;
but some unthought of stroke of death has swept away the tribes of men and still will sweep away.
How nearly did I see the realms of swarthy Proserpine, and Æacus in judgment seated, and the abodes for good men set apart, and Sappho wailing on Æolian lyre the cold­ ness of her country's maids, and you, Alcaeus, sounding more loudly with your golden quill the hardships of the sea, the grievous ills of exile, the woeful deeds of war:
the Shades admire them while they sing of things which claim a sacred silence;
but with greater eagerness the mob in serried crowds drink in with greedy ear the tales of battles and of banished kings.
What wonder, when that monster of the hundred heads, dazed by their songs, hangs down his sable ears;
and snakes entwined in Furies' locks are lulled to rest.
Aye, e'en Prometheus, and Pelops' father too, are from their ills beguiled by the sweet sounds :
nor longer does Orion care to chase the lion and the timid lynx.
Alas !
alas !
dear Postumus, the fleeting years are speed­ ing quickly by, and piety itself shall bring no stay to wrinkles and advancing age and Death whom none can foil:
not though, my friend, with countless bulls for every passing day you would appease relentless Pluto, who confines the monster Geryon of triple shape and size, and Tityos, with his dismal stream-a stream that must be crossed by all who on Earth's bounties feed, whether we be rich and great, or poor and needy hinds.
'Twill be in vain to shun the bloody fight, and broken billows of hoarse Hadria's shores, and vain to guard against the south wind, baleful to men in autumn time.
The black Cocytus we are doomed to see as in sluggish stream he winds along, and Danaus' race of evil name, and Sisyphus, own son of Æolus, to ceaseless toil condemned.
Earth must be left, and home and winsome wife;
and of the trees you fondly tend not one shall follow to the tomb its short-lived lord, except the hated cypress.
An heir more worthy than yourself shall quaff your cask of Cæcuban, by hundred keys secured, and stain the polished floor with lordly wine which shames the Pontiffs' feasts.
Soon princely halls shall leave few acres for the plough:
on every side great fish-ponds shall be seen more spacious than the Lucrine lake, and the unwedded plane shall oust the elm :
then beds of violets and myrtle groves, and every flower of sweeter scent, shall spread their fragrance over olive grounds which yielded profit to their former lord:
then shall the matted branches of the bay ward off the burning sunbeams.
It was not thus laid down in days of Romulus and frugal1 Cato, and in our fathers' simple ways.
Their private income was but scant, the public revenue was great:
no porticoes by private standard ruled, ten feet in length, received the cooling northern shade, nor did the law permit that they should spurn the cottage built of chance cut turf, bidding them to deck their towns by public funds, and with fresh-hewn stones to build them noble temples for their gods.
The man who in a storm is caught in the Ægean main implores the gods for rest, soon as the scowling cloud has hid the moon from view, and when the stars shine with a fitful light to those upon the sea.
Thrace, furious in war, implores repose ;
the Medes, with gorgeous quiver, Grosphus, seek repose, which diamonds cannot buy, nor gold nor purple robes.
For neither hoarded wealth nor Consul's henchman can remove the racking tumults of the mind, and vexing cares that flit around e'en panelled roofs.
That man lives happily on frugal means, upon whose modest board there shines the salt bowl which his fathers used, and whom nor fear nor niggard greed deprives of peaceful sleep.
Why aim we, short-lived men, at many things with eager zeal?
Why seek we lands warmed by another sun ?
What man that flies his father­ land can from himself escape ?
Morbid cares ascend the brass-prowed galleys, nor do they leave the troops of horse, swifter than stags or than the eastern breeze that drives the clouds away.
Let not the mind with present lot content be anxious for things beyond, but mitigate life's crosses with a placid smile :
there's nothing happy on its every side.
An early death bore hence the famed Achilles in his prime;
age, protracted long, wasted Tithonus' powers, and time perchance will grant to me some favour he denies to you.
Round you there bleat an hundred flocks of sheep, and cows in Sicily their welcome low :
to you the harnessed steeds their greetings neigh :
you wool twice dipped in Afric dye with choicest garments clothes :
to me did Fate, who never errs, assign a tiny farm and subtle vein of Grecian song, and courage to despise the envious crowd.
Why take my life away by your complaints :
It is not Heaven's will nor mine, Mæcenas, that you should die before me, great glory of my life and prop of all my weal.
Alas!
if some untimely stroke should take you hence, a portion of my very soul, why should the other stay behind, to me not half so dear, and but in part alive ?
That fatal day shall ruin bring to both.
'Tis not a hollow oath I swear:
we'll go, we'll go, whenever you lead on, prepared to take that latest journey side by side.
Nor fiery Chimæra's breath, nor Gyas with his hundred hands, were he to rise again, shall tear me from you :
so 'tis decreed by mighty Justice and the sister Fates.
Whether 'tis Libra or the dreaded Scorpion, my natal hour's more stormy part, that rules my fate, or Capricornus lording it o'er Western seas, our horoscopes agree with strange accord.
Jove's counteracting light saved you from Saturn's baleful glare, and slowed the speed of Fate's swift wings when in the crowded theatre the people raised three times the shout of joy:
a tree-stem falling on my head had surely been my death, had not good Faunus eased the blow with present help-that kindly guardian of the merchant guild.
1
The promised sacrifice forget not, and the shrine you vowed :
for my part, I will slay a lowly lamb.
Nor ivory couch 2 nor gilded roof shows bright in my abode, nor do Hymettus' slabs on columns rest, hewn from the rocks of distant Africa, nor have I, as an unknown heir, dwelt in the halls of Attalus, nor do noble matrons spin for me Laconian purple:
but honesty I have, and generous vein of poet's wit, and poor as I am the rich man pays me court:
I weary not the gods for more, nor from my friend in power do I a greater boon demand,—my single Sabine farm contents me quite.
Day treads on heels of day, and infant moons make haste to wane.
You, on the very brink of death, contract for hewing marble blocks, and never thinking of your grave you houses build, and hasten to remove still farther back the margin of the sea that breaks on Baiæ's coast with noisy surge, not rich enough with main- land shore.
What means it that you forcibly remove the landmarks which your neighbour set, and in your greed o'erleap your client's fence ?
Husband and wife are turned adrift, bearing in their arms their squalid sons and fathers' gods.
And yet no hall more certainly awaits its wealthy lord than the " appointed House" of Orcus greedy as himself.
What seek you farther ?
Earth opens with impartial mouth for pauper and for prince;
nor did Hell's ferryman for golden lure bear back to upper Earth the great Prometheus with his many wiles.
Orcus confines the haughty Tantalus and all his race:
he attends, invoked or not, to free the poor man when his task is done.
Bacchus have I seen amid sequestered rocks teaching his strains-doubt it not, posterity-and listening nymphs, and pointed ears of Satyrs with the feet of goats.
Evoe, my spirit quakes with fear still fresh, and in my bosom full of Bacchus tumults of joy prevail.
Evoe, spare me, 0 Liber, spare, feared for thy dreadful thyrsus.
'Tis no impiety to sing untiring Bacchantes, and the springs of wine, and plenteous rills of milk, and again to tell of honey dropping from the hollow stem :
'tis no impiety to celebrate thy blessed spouse's crown placed midst the stars, and Pen­ theus' palace, by no slight ruin rent, and Thracian Lycurgus' death.
Thou turnest streams aside, thou rul'st the Indian sea;
mellowed with wine, thou on the lonely heights dost bind the Bacchantes' locks-no harm to them-with twisted vipers:
and when the impious giants tried through upper air to scale the palace of thy father Jove, thou Rhœtus did'st hurl back with lion's claws, and dreadful jaw;
though better fitted, as 'twas said, for dance and mirth, thou wast reputed as nowise equal to the toils of fight;
but, all the same, thou wast the arbiter of peace and war.
1 Cerberus, in harmless mood, gazed at thee with thy golden horn equipped, and gently wagged his tail, and with his triple tongue he licked thy feet and legs on thy return.
A bard of double form, I shall be borne aloft through liquid air upon no common and no feeble wing, nor longer shall I stay on earth, and soaring above envy's range I shall desert the busy haunts of men.
Sprung though I be from humble stock, I, whom thou call'st " dear friend," Maecenas, shall never die, nor shall I be confined by Stygian flood.
Now, even now, the roughening skin is settling on my limbs, and in my upper parts I now assume the white bird's form;
and downy plumage grows upon my fingers and my back.
Now as a bird of tuneful song I shall behold the shores of moan­ ing Bosphorus and the Gætulian Syrtes and the northern plains, more famed2 than Icarus, that crafty son of Daedalus.
Me the Colchian and the Dacian too shall know, who seeks to hide his fear of Marsian bands, and the remote Geloni;
me shall the skilled Iberian learn, the German, and the Gaul.
Let not a dirge be heard around my empty bier, nor squalid sign of grief, nor useless plaints:
the "fare­ well " cry restrain, and leave undone the needless honours of the tomb.
The common herd of men I hate, and hold them far at bay.
A sacred silence keep:
the Muses' priest, I sing to maidens and to youths strains never heard before.
The sway of dreaded kings can only vassals reach:
the sway of Jove, by rout of giants famed, is over kings themselves-of Jove who shakes all Nature by a nod.
'Tis true, no doubt, that one o'er wider range in trenches plants the trees which prop his vines:
that one of nobler birth in search of office to the Campus hies:
another better in morals and repute asserts his claims:
a third has clients many more:
but stern Necessity, from bias free, allots the fate of high and low :
her ample urn shakes every name.
For him above whose guilty head there hangs a naked sword, Sicilian dainties will not " force sweet appetite ";
nor will the song of birds or strains of harp restore his sleep.
Calm slumber scorns not the cottage home of rustic men, nor shady bank, nor Tempe fanned by western breeze.
That man who seeks what's just enough-no more-the troubled sea does not disturb, nor fury of Arcturus as he sets, nor of the rising Kids, nor vineyards beaten down by hail, nor farms betray­ ing hope, when trees now blame the heavy rains, and now the dogstar heat that burns the fields, and now unfriendly winters.
The fishes find their sea curtailed by masses to the depths flung down ;
here the contractor 1 with his crowd of men, the master, too, with household slaves pour in the rubble, disdaining Nature's bounds.
But fear and Con­ science' threats mount by the ladder which the owner climbs, and gloomy care leaves not the brass-prowed ship—aye, even firmly sits behind the Knight.
But if nor Phrygian stone nor purple robe brighter than stars, nor strong Falernian wine, nor Persian nard, compose the mind when ill at ease, why should I rear a lofty Hall in modern style, with pillars court­ ing envy's grudge ?
Why should I change my Sabine Vale for splendour with its greater toils ?
Let Roman youth, made strong by active war, learn to endure privation in a happy mood;
let him as horseman bold with dreaded spear harass the daring Mede, and spend his life in open air, and midst alarms of foes.
Let wife and daughter of the warring king, as from the hostile walls they look, heave many a sigh, alas !
lest princely spouse, untried in war, provoke the lion, dangerous to stir, whom blood-thirst anger hurries on through thickest of the fight.
A pleasant and a noble thing it is to die for father­ land :
Death hunts to doom the man who flies, nor does he spare the trembling knees and back of coward youth.
True worth that knows not base defeat, shines with a halo bright, nor does it take or lay aside the axe of Power at changing whim of fickle mobs.
Worth, that opens heaven to men who should not die, directs her course by ways from others hid, and on her fleeting pinion spurns the vulgar crowd and damp and foggy Earth.
For faithful silence, too, there is a sure reward:
the man who would divulge the sacred rites of holy Ceres I should forbid to stay beneath the roof that covers me, or to unmoor with me a fragile bark:
often has Jove, by slight enraged, in penalties con­ joined impure and pure :
Vengeance, with her halting foot, has rarely failed to catch the wicked, though he gains the start.
Him who defends the Right and is in purpose firm, nor perverse zeal of citizens in passing laws unjust, nor frown of threatening tyrant shakes in his fixed resolve, nor Auster, boisterous ruler of the restless Hadria, nor the mighty hand of Jove with thunder armed:
should shattered heaven fall about his ears, the crash will strike him dauntless still.
Thus Pollux and the roaming Hercules striving upward reached the starry heights, and in their midst reclining Caesar im­ bibes the nectar with empurpled mouth.
For such deserts O Bacchus, did thy tigers bear thee up, drawing thy car with untrained necks:
by means of this did Romulus fly Acheron on steeds of Mars, when Juno spoke what pleased the gods in council seated :
Ilium, Ilium,1 a doom-fraught and polluted judge, and paramour from foreign land, have turned to ashes-consigned for punishment to chaste Minerva and to me, with people and with cheating king, ever since that day when false Laomedon deprived the gods of promised hire.
No longer now that ill-famed guest decks out his form for Spartan dame, and Priam's perjured house no more retards the onset of the valiant Greeks by Hector's might, and war prolonged by our disputes is over now.
Henceforth I will forego my bitter grudge, and will forgive, for sake of Mars, my hated grandson, whom Trojan priestess bore :
him will I allow to reach these realms of light, to drink the juice of nectar, and to be enrolled among the peaceful ranks of gods.
So long as wide and stormy seas shall roll 'twixt Ilium and Rome let exiled sons of Troy reign prosperous where'er they please:
so long as cattle tread on Priam's and on Paris' tomb, and wild beasts there in safety hide their young, let the proud Capitol stand forth in glittering pomp, and let the martial Rome give laws to conquered Medes.
Let her, a dreaded power, extend her fame to those far-distant coasts, where the dividing flood parts Europe from the Afric shore, where swollen Nile o'erflows the plains;
braver in scorning gold un-mined-so is it better placed when hid in Earth-than in turning it to human needs with sacrilegious hands that nothing sacred spare.
Whatever bounds have to the world been set, these shall she reach in arms, eager to see those parts where blazing heat revels unchecked, where clouds prevail, and soaking rains.
But to Quirites, famed in war, their fate I tell on these my terms, that in excess of love, and over­ confident in strength, they seek not to rebuild th' ancestral walls of Troy.
Troy's fortunes, born again with evil omen, shall be repeated in disaster bitter as before, I, sister and spouse of Jove heading my conquering bands.
Thrice were a wall of brass to rise by Phoebus' aid, thrice should it fall, by Argives levelled to the ground;
thrice should the captive wife lament her husband and her children slain.
This will not suit the sportive lyre :
Muse, whither dost thou haste ?
Cease to relate the gods' discourse with froward will, and bv thy humble strains debase such lofty themes.
O Queen Calliope, from heaven come down and on thy pipe pour forth a long and stately strain or, if thou wish it rather, with clear and tuneful voice, or on the strings of Phoebus' lyre.
Do you hear it, friends, or does a fond delusion mock my brain ?
Methinks I hear her, and I seem to wander through the hallowed groves, where charming waters glide and gentle breezes blow.
Me, when a child, worn out by play, and overcome by sleep, the woodland doves of storied fame covered with leaves on Voltur's slope, beyond Apulia's bounds, my early home-a wondrous sight to all who dwell in lofty Acherontia's home, and Bantia's woods and fertile fields of low Forentum !
how I could sleep secure from deadly snakes, and grizzly bears, and how my limbs were heaped with sacred bay and myrtle duly culled -a child inspired with strength from Heaven.
Your care, O Muses, yours I say, I'm borne to lofty Sabine hills, or, be't my choice, to cold Præneste, or Tibur's slopes, or Baiæ's sea-washed shore.
Me welcome at your foun­ tains and your choirs, not Philippi's rout, nor cursed tree could kill, nor Palinurus in Sicilian seas.
Since you shall be at hand, as sailor shall I brave the raging Bosphorus, and, as a traveller, Assyria's burning sands.
With you I'll visit Britain, to the stranger fierce, and the Concanian who delights in horses' blood.
With you in safety I shall see the quiver-armed Geloni and the Scythian Don.
'Tis you that in Pierian cave regale exalted Cæsar eager to complete his toils, so soon as he has placed in towns his war-worn troops.
You, deities benign, both peaceful counsels prompt, and joy in those you give.
We know how he who rules the sluggish earth and calms the storm-swept sea, and cities too and realms of gloom, and with a righteous sway governs both gods and mortal men, slew with descending bolt the Titans and the giant host.
That band of youths of horrid form had caused to Jove great dread, relying on their strength of arm, and the fell brothers too, who sought to place Mount Pelion on Olympus with its shady woods.
But what could bold Typhœus do, and sturdy Mimas ?
or what, Porphyrion in attitude of fight?
what could Rhcetus, and Enceladus,—a daring spearman with whole trunks up-torn,-avail against the sounding shield of Pallas ?
Here Vulcan stood, for battle keen :
there mother Juno stayed, and he who never will lay down his bow, Apollo, god of Delos and of Patara, who in Castalia's crystal dew is wont to bathe his flowing locks;
who haunts the groves of Lycia and his native woods.
Force void of judgment falls by inherent weight:
force, duly tempered, the deities advance to greater power:
but they detest that strength which all impiety contrives.
Gyas of the hundred hands attests my sentiments, and Orion, noted tempter of the chaste Diana, slain by the Virgin's shaft.
Earth grieves, on her own monsters flung;
and wails her offspring hurled to lurid Orcus by the bolt of Jove :
nor does the scorching flame consume Mount Aetna laid upon them, nor does the vulture ever quit the liver of the lustful Tityus, assigned as vengeful warder of the guilty wretch:
the amorous Pirithoüs three hundred chains confine.
From his thunder we believe that Jupiter in heaven is king.
Augustus shall be deemed a Deity on earth when Britons and dread Parthians are added to his sway.
What ! have Crassus' soldiers deigned to live degraded husbands of barbarian wives?
and,-shame on the Senate and our altered ways !-has Marsian or Apulian brave, for­ getting sacred shields and Roman name and dress, and Vesta's never-dying flame, grown old in pay of marriage kin1 under a Persian king, while Rome is safe, and Jove's great temple too ?
This had the wary mind of Regulus foreseen when he refused the proffered terms, vile in themselves and fraught with mischief for the time to come, unless the captive youth, with none to pity, died.
I've seen, he said, the Roman eagles hung in Punic shrines, and weapons from our soldiers wrung without a blow:
I've seen the arms of citizen bound fast behind a freeman's back, and gates2 thrown open wide, and fields our arms once spoiled now tilled again!
A soldier ransomed by gold will return, forsooth, a braver man !
You only add the loss of money to the foul disgrace:
as wool when stained with dye will ne'er regain the colour lost, so sterling worth when ousted once cares not to take its place in baser breast.
When stags set free from tangled nets show fight, then he'll be brave who once has yielded to the treacherous foe, and in a second war that man shall crush the Punic hosts, who on his pinioned arms " has felt the thongs, the coward!
and has feared to die."
He, knowing not how life to win, has mixed up peace with war.
1
Oh, shame!
0 Carthage!
higher raised by Italy's base fall!
'Tis said he (i.e., Regulus) put aside his wife's chaste kiss and little sons' good-bye, as being a Roman citizen no more, and with his purpose stern, fixed on the ground a hero's gaze, while striving to confirm the Senate's wavering mind by counsel never given before, and hasting forth to noble exile from the midst of weeping friends.
And yet he knew full well what cruelties the torturer prepared:
but still he moved aside opposing kin and throngs who barred his going, just as if he'd judged a case and leaving clients' weary suits were hurrying off to Venafrum, or to Taren­ turn, that Laconian town.
Roman, though innocent, you shall atone your fathers' sins, till you repair the temples and the mouldering shrines of all the gods, and their statues blackened by the grimy smoke.
You hold unbounded sway, because you give sub­ mission to the gods :
from them all emanates, to them ascribe all ends and issues.
The gods, through our neglect, on sore-tried Italy have brought her many woes.
Already have Monæses' and Pacorus' bands twice crushed our ill-starred onsets, and gleam with pride that to their scanty ornaments they added spoils of Rome.
The Dacian and Egyptian hosts had well-nigh sacked the town, given up to civil broils,-the latter dreaded for his fleet, the former better with his missile shafts.
The ages " big with crime," first stained the mar- riage bond, and family and home;
misfortune hence derived has swept like torrent-flood o'er fatherland and people.
The grown-up maiden loves to learn the Ionic dance, and trains herself in all coquettish arts, and from her very cradle medi­ tates unholy loves :
then by and bye she -seeks for younger suitors at her husband's board, nor does she pick and choose the man to whom to grant a hurried and forbidden joy, when lights are out:
but when she's called she rises up before her partner's face and with his full consent, whether it be a bagman that invites her, or the captain of some Spanish ship-the costly buyer of her foul disgrace.
It was not youths from parents such as these that dyed the sea with Punic blood and slew the great Antiochus and Pyrrhus too, and dreaded Hannibal:
but the manly sons of rustic soldiers, inured to trench the soil with Sabine spades, and cut and carry fagots till their rigid mother said "enough," what time the sun reversed the mountain shades, and loosed the yoke from wearied kine, bringing sweet even­ tide with parting car.
What does not wasting time make worse ?
Our fathers' age, worse than their sires', has brought forth us still worse than they-soon to produce an offspring baser still.
Asterie, why for Gyges weep, a youth of trusted con­ stancy, whom kindly zephyrs will bring back in early spring, rich with Bithynian wares ?
Driven by southern winds to Oricum, after wild Capra's rise, sleepless he spends the chilly nights not without many a tear.
And yet the agent of his love-sick hostess slyly tempts him in a thousand ways, —" that Chloë sighs for him," and that " in wretchedness she is consumed by love for you."
He tells how once a treacherous dame by groundless charges urged the simple Proetus to prepare an early death for chaste Bellerophon :
how Peleus was all but sent to Tartarus, while with chaste resolve he fled Hippolyte's Thessalian charms:
and the deceiver calls to mind each tale that tempts to err:
in vain -for still unscathed, and deafer than the rocks of Icarus,1 he hears his words.
But take you care lest fair Enipeus, who lives hard by your home, may please you overmuch:
though on the Campus sward no other man is seen to wheel his steed with equal skill, and none with equal speed can swim the Tuscan stream in downward course.
At early night shut up your house, and look not down into the street at sound of plaintive pipe, and though he call you, " hard of hearty remain unmoved.
Mæcenas, skilled in lore of Greece and Rome, you wonder, doubtless, what I, a bachelor, intend to do on this the first of March:
what mean these flowers, and censer with frankincense filled, and coals laid down on fresh­ cut turf?
To Bacchus I had vowed a dainty feast, and snow-white goat, when almost done to death by stroke of falling tree.
This day, a holiday, in each returning year shall draw the well-pitched cork out from the cask, which first was taught to drink-in smoke in Tullus' consulship.
Maecenas, take a hundred cups in honour of your friend preserved, and prolong till dawn the watchful lamps:
let revel-noise and angry words be far away.
Dismiss your thoughts for Rome and her affairs.
The host of Dacian Cotiso has perished :
the Medes in deadly feud contend among themselves in doleful war:
the Cantabri, our enemy of old on coast of Spain, are now subdued, reduced to tardy bondage :
and now the Scythian, with bow unstrung, prepares to fly and leave our plains.
For once lay cares aside, and as a private citizen cease to be worried, lest the public suffer aught:
take joyfully the blessings of the present hour, and leave to others grave concerns.
HOR.
So long as I was dear to you, and no more favoured youth was wont to throw his arms around your snowy neck, I lived more happy than a Persian king.
LYD.
So long as you were not more fond of other maid, nor was Chloë to your Lydia preferred, I Lydia, of famous name, lived more renowned than Roman Ilia.
HOR.
The Thracian Chloë sways me now, skilled in sweet strains, and mistress of the lyre, for whom I should not fear to die, if Fate would spare her, my surviving life.
LYD.
Calais, the son of Thurian Ornytus, inflames me with a mutual fire, for whom I twice would bear to die, if Fate would save my darling boy.
HOR.
What if our former love returns and binds us with a brazen yoke, though parted now, if fair-haired Chloë be dislodged, and for the slighted Lydia the door again be free?
LYD.
Though he is brighter than a star, you lighter than a cork, more wrathful than the fretful Hadria—for all, with you I'd love to live, with you I'd gladly die.
Lyce, if you dwelt on banks of far-off Don, bound to some savage lord, yet would you grieve to see me stretched before your cruel gate, exposed to native north winds' cutting blasts.
Do you perceive with what a noise the gate, with what a noise the trees within your fair abode send back responsive meanings to the winds :
how Jove by power of cloudless sky hardens to ice the fallen snows ?
Discard all haughtiness, which Venus hates, lest rope and wheel run back together.
You're no Penelope, from Tuscan father sprung, to suitors deaf.
Oh!
though neither gifts nor prayers, nor lovers' sallow looks, nor husband smitten by Pierian maid can bend your will, spare your suppliants I pray, though not more pliable than rigid oak, nor gentler in your heart than Moorish snakes.
This frame of mine will not for ever stand your stony threshold and the rain.
Hermes, for under thee as master, with quickest wit Amphion made the stones move on by song;
and thou, sweet lyre, that know'st so well to send forth sound from seven strings, in olden times not tuneful nor in favour, but now a welcome guest at tables of the rich and at the temple feasts, sing strains to which fair Lyde may incline her stub­ born ear, who like a " three-year-old" sports in the fields with bounding step, and shrinks from touch of man, not knowing marriage joys, and yet unripe in age.
Thou hast power to lead the tigers and the woods in company;
thou canst stop the course of rapid streams:
by reason of thy soothing strains, did Cerberus, the sentinel of that Infernal hall, give way, although a hundred serpents guard the monster's head, and fetid breath and bloody gore flow from his three-tongued mouth.
Nay, Tityus and Ixion smiled against their will;
the urn stood for a moment dry, while thou didst soothe the Danaids with a grateful song.
Let Lyde hear the maiden's crime and well-known punishment, and tell her of the cask emptied of water, which ever from the bottom flows, and of the after-fates which wait upon misdeeds of men, even in the home of Orcus.
Of all affec­ tion void-for what more heinous could they do ?
heartless themselves they still had heart to slay their husbands with the cruel sword !
One of the many, worthy of the marriage torch, was to her perjured father gloriously false­ a maiden famed to every future age-who to her youthful husband said, " Arise, arise, lest an eternal sleep be given thee from a hand thou fearest not:
by flight escape my father and my wicked sisters, who like lions midst a herd of calves, are rending, ah me, each her own!
I, gentler of heart than they, will neither strike nor keep thee in restraint.
My father with his horrid chains may load my limbs because in mercy I have spared a wretched spouse:
or send me over sea to far Numidian plains.
Go, where'er thy feet or breezes of the sea now bear thee, while night and Venus favour thy escape, go with happy omen, and on my tomb inscribe a mournful verse in memory of me.
"Unhappy maidens cannot humour love, nor can they drown their woes in pleasant wine, or (if they do) they live half dead, fearing the lashes of an uncle's tongue.
Cytherea's winged son flies off with work-box and with work, and Neobūle fair, young Hebrus, new from Lipara, with beauty fresh and bright, bears clean away your distaff and your web, and all your zeal for good Minerva's Arts, soon as he bathes in Tiber's stream his shoulders rubbed with oil:
a horseman he, e'en better than Bellerophon himself, and never vanquished in the " ring" or in the race;
skilful too to strike with well-aimed spear the stags that scour the open in bewildered herds, and quick of eye and hand to intercept the boar that in deep thicket lurking lies.
O Fountain of Bandusia, than crystal clearer still, worthy art thou of sweetest wine and flowers in plenty;
to- morrow thou shalt have as offering a kid, whose forehead, swelling with its budding horns, foretells both love and war -in vain;
for the issue of the wanton flock shall tinge with scarlet blood thy icy streams.
Thee the fierce season of the blazing Dogstar fails to touch :
thou giv'st a cool, delightful drink to oxen wearied with the plough, and to the roaming herds.
Thou too shalt be in after-days one of the far-famed Wells, I singing of the oak above the rocks from which thy waters leap with babbling noise !
O
Roman people, your Cæsar, who, it was lately said, had sought, like Hercules, the laurel gained only at risk of life, revisits his domestic gods, coming as victor from the shores of Spain.
Let the wife, rejoicing in her peerless lord, come forth and make an offering to the righteous gods:
and let the sister of our glorious leader come;
and mothers of the new-made wives and of the soldiers, late preserved from death, come forth, adorned with suppliant wreaths.
Ye youths and maidens newly wed, abstain from all ill-omened words.
This day, a real festival to me, shall banish gloomy cares:
Nor sudden risings shall I fear, nor death by violence, while Caesar rules the land.
Away, my boy, seek perfume, chaplets too, and get a cask of wine that saw the Marsian war, if any jar perchance escaped the roving Spartacus.
And bid Neæra of the silver voice make haste to trim and bind her hair fragrant with myrrh:
if through the hated porter any trouble rise, be off at once.
Whitening hair is wont to mellow hearts that erst were fond of strife and wanton brawl:
this I should not have stood in days of heated youth when Plancus was our Consul.
You, wife of humble Ibycus, at length set bounds to your incontinence and to your deeds of ill-repute.
Now near a timely death forbear among the girls to sport, and on those brilliant stars to cast a cloud.
What's seemly for young Pholoé becomes not aged Chloris too.
Your daughter it would more befit the young men's homes to storm, as Bacchante roused to frenzy by the beaten drum.
Her love for Nothus makes her frisk about just like a wanton goat.
Wool shorn at famed Luceria suits you now, when old and wizened,­ not harps, not roses' purple blush, nor casks drunk to the very dregs.
A tower of brass and doors of, oak, and surly watch of wakeful dogs had safely guarded Danaë from nightly swains, had not Jupiter and Venus too befooled Acrisius, timid keeper of the hidden maid:
for well they knew that if the god were changed to gold the way would prove at once secure and free.
Gold loves to pass midst many guards, and break through walls of stone, more powerful than light­ ning's bolt.
For lucre's sake the Argive augurs house, in ruin whelmed, was utterly destroyed:
by bribes the man of Macedon burst open cities' gates, and undermined all rival kings:
even rough sea captains are ensnared by bribes.
Anxiety attends on growing wealth, and greed for greater things.
Mæcenas, glory of the Roman knights, justly have I feared to raise my head that all may see.
The more a man denies himself, the more will he from heaven receive :
stripped as I am of Fortune's gifts I seek the camp of those who covet nought, and gladly leave the task of wealth-pursuit, more famed as owner of my slighted means, than if 'twere said that in my barns I stored the fruits of all Apulia's active hinds-midst heaps of riches, pauper stillA stream of water, clear and pure, a wood few acres wide, a certainty of crop-this is a lot unknown to him, and happier than his, who over Afric's fertile plains in glittering splendour reigns.
Though neither do Calabrian bees for me their honey bring, nor for me does wine in Laestrygonian cask mature, nor fleeces grow to richness in my Gallic parks, yet craving poverty is far away.
Nor if I wanted more, would you refuse to give.
I shall be better able to increase my little means by curbing my desires, than if I joined in one the realms of Alyattes and Mygdonian plains ;
to those who much demand, that much too often fails:
'tis well with him to whom the deity has given with sparing hand what meets his daily wants.
Ælius, noble scion of the ancient Lamus—since, as 'tis said, the former Lamiæ were named from him, and all succeeding sons through trusty records:
your origin you draw from him as founder of the house, who first, 'tis said, had held in wide-extended sway the town of Formiae, and Liris flowing through Marica's coasts ;
-a storm to-morrow, from the East come down, shall strew the grove with many leaves, the shore with useless weed, unless the aged raven, prophetess of rain, deceives me.
Pile up the well-dried wood, while yet you may:
to-morrow you shall treat your genius to wine and to a hog of two months old, along with your household from their work set free.
Faunus, lover of the flying nymphs, go kindly through my bounds and sunny fields, and onward take your way pro­ pitious to the younglings of the flock, if at the end of every year a tender kid is slain for thee, and wine in plenty fails not in the cup, which Venus claims as mate, and if the ancient altar smokes with odours plentiful.
The cattle all in verdant plains disport, whene'er December's Nones bring round thy festival;
in the grassy meads the villagers make holiday for thee, with ox unyoked.
The wolf moves up and down among the fearless lambs.
For thee the woods a leafy carpet spread:
the delver feels delight that in thine honour he has danced upon the hated ground with triple beat.
You tell us well what space of time there was from ancient Inachus to Codrus, who feared not for his native land to die:
you tell us of the race of Æacus, and of the battles fought beneath the walls of sacred Troy ;
you tell us not the price at which to buy a cask of Chian wine ;
who shall the water heat;
who shall afford us house-room;
and at what hour I may get quit of this Pelignian cold.
1
Bring quickly, boy, a cup in honour of New Moon, one for Midnight, too, and one to toast Murena, augur dear.
The cups are mixed with glasses three or nine to suit the taste of each.
Th'enraptured bard who loves the " Muses Nine " will call for glasses three times three.
The sister Graces, with their light attire, prohibit more than three,1 in dread of brawls.
For me, I like to lose my head at times :
why does the Phrygian horn withhold its blast ?
Why do the lyre and the flute hang silent thus ?
Niggard hands I can't abide:
strew roses :
let churlish Lycus hear the boisterous din, and she, our youthful neighbour, ill suited to the dotard Lycus.
Rhode, just of ripe age, seeks you, 0 Telephus, your cluster­ ing hair shining with unguent;
—you, radiant as Hesperus at the close of day.
Me, the lasting love of my own Glycera consumes.
See you not, Pyrrhus, at what risk you steal away from Afric lioness her tiny cubs ?
Soon a faint-hearted thief you'll shun the dangerous fight, when she shall march through groups of rival youths to claim Nearchus of distinguished mien-a noble contest, which shall rather win the prize.
Meantime, while you take forth your winged arrows, and while she whets her dreaded teeth, the umpire of the fight, they say, has placed beneath his naked foot the palm of victory, and fans with gentle breeze his shoulder covered by his perfumed hair, beautiful as Nireus was, or such as Ganymede, from many-fountained Ida borne away.
O genial cask, old as myself, and filled when Manlius was consul, whether you hold the seeds of discord or of mirth, or brawl and maddened love, or gentle sleep-for whatsoever end you keep the chosen Massic, well worthy to be broached on an auspicious day-down from your bin descend, for good Corvinus bids me draw a mellower wine.
Although he's steeped in deep Socratic lore, he will not in a cynic mood refuse your cheer.
Old Cato, it is said, stern as he was in morals, was often warmed with wine.
You lend a gentle stimulus to minds 'tis hard to stir, you reveal by cheering wine the cares and secrets of the wise :
to minds perplexed you hope restore, and to the poor man give both strength and power, for after you he fears not threatening crests of angry kings, nor soldiers' arms.
Bacchus, and Venus if with good will she comes, and Graces loath to loose the bond of Harmony, and wakeful lights shall lengthen out your sway whilst Phoebus with returning beams puts all the stars to flight.
O Virgin, guardian of the hills and groves, goddess of triple form, who thrice invoked dost lend an ear and save from death young mothers in their labour pangs, let the pine which shades my house to thee be sacred, so that as each year ends its course, I joyfully may offer it the blood of boar, now practising his sidelong strokes.
My rustic Phidyle, if at new moon you raise to heaven your suppliant hands, and with frankincense please the gods with first fruits of the year, and with a ravening pig, neither shall your fertile vine the noxious sou-west feel;
nor the corn, the blighting smut;
nor the dear issue of the flock, the sickly time when fruits are gathered in.
The sacred victim, now grazing amidst oaks and holms on chilly Algidus, or fattening on Alba's meads, shall with its lifers blood stain the pontiffs axe;
there is no need for you to coax your tiny gods with slaughtered sheep, if you but garland them with rosemary and tender myrtle.
If your hand without a gift 1 has touched the altar, it has appeased th' offended gods with pious offering of meal and crackling salt, and could not please them more by costly victim.
Though you possess more wealth than may be found in Arab or in Indian stores, as yet untouched, though with your buildings you o'ercrowd the Tuscan and Apulian seas, if cruel Fate fix in your gable-tops her nails of adamant, you shall not free your mind from dread nor head from bonds of death.
A better life the nomad Scythians lead, whose wag­ gons drag their shifting homes from place to place, as is their wont;
and the Getae, too, by hardships tried, whose lands unmeasured by the rule bear fruits of earth for common use,2 and no one tills the soil for longer than a year, but when his toils are done another takes his place on like condi­ tions.
There the wife, of guilty thoughts devoid, withholds her hands from step-sons of their mother reft, nor does the spouse by dower made bold, her husband rule, nor in a sleek adulterer put trust.
The dower they bring is parents' worth, and chastity, based on the marriage bond, which shrinks from other men;
" they dare not sin, or if they sin they die."
Oh, will some leader strive to end unholy carnage and the madness of the State ;
if he should wish that " Father of the City" on his statues be inscribed, let him with fear­ less hand restrain unbridled wickedness, and gain 'mong future men an honoured name.
Since, oh impiety, in envious mood we living virtue slight, and with grudges yearn for it in vain when taken hence.
What use in bitter plaints if sin is not repressed by punishment?
of what avail are legal Acts if moral habits fail to aid ?
if neither parts of earth fenced in by scorching heat, nor that which borders on the North and snows hard-frozen to the ground, repel the trader;
if skilful mariners overcome the stormy seas;
if poverty, a great disgrace, impels us both to do and suffer all, and leaves the path of virtue, hard to climb?
Then let us cast our gems of every kind and useless gold, the source of greatest ills, into the Capitol, where shout of kindly citizens in crowds invites us, or plunge them in the nearest sea, if in truth we sorrow for our crimes.
The very elements of greed must be erased, and minds too yielding must be trained by studies more severe.
The noble boy, untaught to ride, knows not the way to sit his horse, and fears to join the chase, more skilled in playing with the Grecian hoop, if so you wish, or if you prefer, with dice, forbidden by the laws;
while his father's perjured oath strives to deceive his partner and his guest, and hastes to hoard up money for unworthy heirs:
in fine, riches increase, persistent still,1 and the unfinished pile is always lacking somewhat more.
Whither dost thou rush me, Bacchus, full of thee ?
Into what groves and grottos am I driven, by some strange impulse hurried on ?
In what lone caves shall I be heard planning to set great Cæsar's glory midst the stars for aye, and at the Council Board of Jove ?
A new and noble strain I'll sing, unsung as yet by other lips.
Just as the sleepless Bacchante stands astonied on the heights, gazing on Hebrus and on Thrace all white with snow, and Rhodope traversed by men of savage mood, so, too, it pleases me, stray­ ing I know not where, to look with wonder on the river banks and the unpeopled woods.
Lord of the Naiads, and of Bacchantes, who by their strength of arm can over­ throw the giant ash, nothing little, nothing lowly, nothing of mortal utterance will I sing.
0 Lenæus, sweet is the peril to attend the god who with the verdant vine-leaf wreathes his brows.
I've spent my life, till lately fitting gallant for the fair, and have waged the wars of love and had my triumphs too :
but now this wall which guards the sea-born Venus on the left, shall have my weapons and my lute whose warfare's o'er.
Here, lay here, the brilliant torches and the bars and bows that threatened stubborn doors.
0 goddess who in blissful Cyprus hast thy seat, in Memphis too, where Thracian snows can never come, 0 Queen of love, with thy uplifted lash touch once, and only once, the haughty Chloe.
May the dire omen of the hooting owl attend the wicked on his way, or pregnant dog, or tawny wolf descending from Lanuvian fields, or new whelped fox.
May serpent break his journey just begun, if darting o'er his path like arrow- shaft he terrifies his steeds:
for one for whom my fears shall rise, watchful augur will I from the east by prayers invite the prophet crow, before the bird that tells impending showers returns again to stagnant pools.
Happy may you be where'er you go, my Galatea, and may you live with still a thought for me, and may no magpie on the left or straying rook forbid your route.
But yet you see with what tur­ moil Orion hastens on his downward path.
I know what Hadria's Gulf is when the sky is black, and how deceitful is Iapyx when serene.
Let wives and children of our foes feel the blind tumults of the rising south, and roar of darkened main, and the beach when shaken by the lashing surge.
So did Europa trust her snow-white side to the deceitful bull, and, bold before, she now grew pale, to see the deep swarming with monsters, and dangers all around.
But lately in the meads on flowers intent, and weaving for the nymphs a promised wreath, now in a dusky night she nothing saw but stars and waves.
Then soon as she arrived in Crete, in countless cities strong :
11 Father," she said, " 0 name of daughter left behind, and filial love by madness crushed !
Whence, whither have I come ?
A single death is far too little for a virgin's sin!
In waking thoughts do I bewail a foul offence, or does some empty phantom, which fleeting from the ivory gate brings dreams, mock me still free from stain of guilt?
Was it a more inviting course to cross a wide expanse of sea, or pluck the new-blown flowers ?
If one would give me in my wrath that horrid bull, I would endeavour with the steel to cut him limb from limb, and smash the monster's horns, lately so loved.
Shameless
I have left my father's home, shameless do I delay the dues of Orcus.
Ye gods, if any of you hear me now, would I might stray defenceless amongst lions !
Before some wasting blight should seize my comely cheeks, and ere the sap should from the tender prey descend,1 I seek while blooming still for tigers to be food.
And thus my father in his distant home urges his wish:
0 base Europa, why do you delay to die ?
With maiden's belt, so luckily brought forth, you may disjoint your neck hung from this very ash.
Or if the rocks and cliffs, all edged for death, delight you more, come, to the whirlwind blast commit yourself, unless, a maid of royal blood, you would prefer to card your mistress' wool, and be the handmaid of some foreign dame.
"Here Venus, with a roguish smile, stood by the wailing maid, and Cupid too, with bow unstrung.
Then, when of mirth she had enough, "Refrain," she said, "from rage and pettish wrath, for soon the hated bull will offer you his horns to rend.
You know not you've become the bride of Jove omnipotent!
From sobs desist, and learn to bear with dignity your great estate :
half of the globe shall one day bear your name.
"What could I better do on Neptune's festal day ?
Lyde bestir yourself and bring from inner bin the well-stored Cæcuban, and violence apply to guarded prudence.
You see that noon declines, and as if the fleeting day would halt, you linger from the store to take the loitering cask of consul Bibulus.
We shall sing in turn of Neptune and the Nereids with their locks of green:
you on the curved lyre shall sing in answering strain Latona, and the darts of Cynthia, swift of foot;
and to end the song she shall be sung who rules o'er Cnidos and the shining Cyclades, and visits Paphos on her harnessed swans.
Night too shall have her well-earned hymn.
Maecenas, sprung from Tuscan kings, long have I had in store for you a cask of mellow wine, ne'er " tipped " before, and blossoms of the rose for wreaths, and for your hair unguent expressly made for you.
Tear yourself from all delay:
and gaze not for ever on Tibur and its rills,1 and slopes of Aesula and ridges of Telegonus, the slayer of his sire.
Leave for a time a plenty palling to the taste, and your mansion towering to the clouds :
Cease to admire the smoke and wealth and din of blessed Rome.
Changes are wont to please the rich;
and cleanly meals beneath a poor man's roof, without the hangings and the purple couch, have oft removed the wrinkles from the anxious brow.
And now the father of Andromeda the fair shows bright the orb he erst had hid;
now Procyon flames with fiery heat, and the furious Lion's scorching star, as Sol brings round again the days of drought.
And now the shepherd, tired and worn, makes for the stream and shade with languid flock, and for the tangled thickets of the rough Silvanus:
and the quiet bank is still unswept by wandering winds.
You deeply think with zealous care what policy may best befit the State, and anxious for the City's weal you dread what schemes the Seres may devise, and Bactra once by Cyrus ruled, and Tanais with quarrels rife.
The Deity in wisdom hides in thickest night the issues of the years to come, and smiles if man is worried overmuch.
Forget not to control the present with a mind composed:
all else is carried onward like a stream, now gliding calmly in its central bed down to the Tuscan sea, now whirling in one seething flood the severed rocks and uptorn trees, and flocks -of sheep, and homes of men, with no small din of mountains' roar and of the neighbouring woods, when the wild deluge in its mad career rouses to fury peaceful streams.
He spends his life with self-command and happy mind who day by day can say, 11 I've life enjoyed :
to-morrow Father Jove may hide the sky with pitchy clouds or light it with a brilliant sun;
but yet he cannot render vain what's past, nor alter or undo what fleeting time has once brought round."
Delighting in her cruel work, and ever keen to play the tyrant's game, Fortune with changing whim her honours, never sure, bestows-to me now kind, now to another.
I praise her while she's with me, but if she moves her rapid wings I pay her back all that she gave, and in my virtue wrap myself, and as my bride seek honest poverty without a dower.
If the mast should moan by southern winds, it's not my way to have recourse to abject prayers, and by vows to bargain that my goods from Cyprus and from Tyre should not add treasures to the greedy sea.
At such a time the breeze and Pollux with his brother twin shall bear me through Ægean swells, safe in the keeping of a two-oared skiff.
A monument I've reared more durable than brass, and loftier than the princely structure of the pyramids, which neither biting rain can overthrow, nor fierce north wind nor lapse of countless years and flight of time.
I shall not wholly die, and all my better part shall Libitina shun :
I shall increase in after-fame with glory ever fresh, long as the priest shall mount the Capitol with silent vestal.
Where Aufidus roars loudly down his bed, and where king Daunus on a thirsty soil ruled over rustic tribes, I, raised to fame from humble place, shall be pronounced the first 1 that fitted Aeolia's lyric songs to strains of Italy.
Take as thine own, Melpornene, the pride my merit claims, and of thy grace my head entwine with Delphic bay.
Venus, do you again stir up the wars, long broken off?
Spare me, I pray, I pray.
I'm not the man I was beneath the sway of gentle Cinara.
Imperious mother of sweet Loves, oh cease by silken reins to guide and wheel a steed now hard of mouth and close on fifty years.
Go where the coaxing prayers of youth invite you to return.
Borne on the wings of lustrous swans thou'lt hasten to the home of Maximus, and revel there more fitly, if thou seek'st to fire a breast open to ardent love;
for he, a youth of noble birth and graceful form, and eloquent for clients in distress, and with an hundred arts endowed, shall bear afar thy warfare's flag;
and when, victorious o'er his rival's lavish gifts, he laughs with glee, he shall erect a marble bust of thee beneath a citron dome by Alba's lake.
There shalt thou inhale sweet odours plentiful, and shalt delight thyself with mingled strains of lyre and Phrygian pipe and flageolet.
There twice a day shall youths and maidens fair in Salian fashion beat the earth in triple time with snow-white feet, and praise thy power divine.
But me, nor maid, nor youth, nor too fond hope of mutual love can now delight, nor care I to contend in wine-carouse, nor bind my temples with the new pluckt flowers.
But Ligurinus !
why, oh why, do tear­ drops now and then course down my cheeks ?
Why fails my fluent tongue at every word, with silence scarcely meet?
Thee in my dreams by night I clasp in my embrace :
thee in swift flight I follow o'er the Campus' sward, thee, hard of heart, through yielding waters I pursue.
Julus, the man who aims to rival Pindar poises himself in air on waxen wings secured by art of Daedalus, destined ere long to give the glassy deep a noted name.
Just as a river rushes down the mountain's side, swollen by rains above its wonted banks, even so doth Pindar boil and onward rush with vast, unfathomable tide of song, worthy to be gifted with Apollo's bays, whether in daring dithyrambs he tumbles down strange words, or hurries on in verses free from rule:
or sings of gods, and kings, the seed of gods, by whom the Centaurs fell in death deserved, by whom was quenched the dread Chimaera's flame :
or if he speaks of those whom victory on Elis' plain brings to their homes as very gods on earth, athlete or steed, and bestows a boon more prized than countless statues;
or if he wails some youth torn from his weeping bride and to the stars extols his strength, his courage, and his morals pure as gold, and grudges gloomy Orcus such a prize.
A strong and swelling breeze lifts Dirce's Swan aloft whene'er, Antonius, he soars to higher regions of the sky.
But I, in habit and in manner a Matinian bee, which gathers with much toil the pleasing thyme, make laboured verses with my humble wit, around the woods and banks of Tibur and its many rills.
A poet thou of higher strain shalt sing of Caesar, when with the well-earned laurel deck'd he drags the fierce Sygambri up the sacred steep;
­ than whom the Fates and blessed Gods have given to earth no greater and no better gift, nor will they give, even though our times return to golden years of old.
Of festal days, too, shalt thou sing and public games, for valiant Caesar's safe return, in answer to our prayers, and for the courts, from lawsuits free.
Then if aught I speak a hearing claims, my voice with hearty note1 shall join the general applause, and in delight that Caesar's come again, thee I shall sing of, glorious Day, 0 worthy to be praised, and whilst thou, Triumph-God, on in procession mov'st, not once but often shall the city shout with one accord, " Io Triumphe," and we shall offer incense to the bounteous gods.
Thee from thy vows ten bulls, ten cows shall free, me a young steer shall loose, which in wide pastures, having left his dam, now to a bull matures, to pay my vow;
whose horns are like the moon when three days old;
snowwhite to view where he has got a mark, but tan in other parts.
What man thou, at his birth, Melpomene, hast once beheld with favouring eye, the Isthmian toil shall not make famous in the "ring," nor shall high-mettled steed return him victor in a Grecian car, nor shall the deeds of battle show him to the Capitol, adorned with Delian bays, because he crushed the boastful threats of kings:
but the streams that flow by fertile Tibur and the woods' dense foliage shall make him famed for Lyric verse.
The sons of Rome, first of all cities, see good to place me in the sacred roll of bards, and now I'm less assailed by envy's tooth.
0
Muse that rul'st the golden lyre's sweet sounds, 0 thou that to the speechless fish canst at thy pleasure give the swan's sweet note, 'tis to thy bounty due that by the finger of the passer-by I'm pointed out as minstrel of the Roman lyre :
that I have breath of poet, and that I please, if please I do, is thine.
Just as at first the fire of youth and native force from the nest urged forth, still ignorant of life, the bird that bears Jove's bolts-to whom the King of Gods has given dominion o'er the fowls of air, having proved him trusty in his charge of Ganymede of golden locks-whom next the winds of spring (the winter storms now past) have taught, though timid still, unwonted efforts of the wing, and whom a lightning swoop soon hurls on sheepfolds as a deadly foe, but whom again the love of feast and fight has now against the wriggling serpents forced:
or as a lion, fresh from the udder of his tawny dam and of his milk deprived, whom the goat on joyous herbage bent has just caught sight of when on the point of falling victim to his virgin tooth :
such as him, the Rhaetian Vindelici saw Drusus as he warred beneath the Alpine heights;
whose custom-whence it came I failed to ask, nor is it right that all things we should know-equips their hands against the foe through every age with Amazonian axe:
but their hosts, for many years, on many fields, victo­ rious, conquered in turn by youthful hero's skill, felt what in­ tellect could do, what talents fostered in a happy home, what Caesar's love, warm as a father's to the Neros, could effect.
From brave and good the brave and good are sprung :
the merits of their sires survive in steers, survive in horses too, nor do the eagles, bold and fierce, bring forth the timorous doves;
but learning quickens inborn power, and honest culture nerves the heart.
As soon as public morals fail vices degrade fair nature's worth.
What debt you, Romans, to the Neros owe, Metaurus river testifies, and Hasdrubal o'erthrown, and that great day for Latium bright, the gloom dispelled, which was the first to smile with blessed victory, ever since the dreaded African rushed through Italian towns as fire through pines, or Eurus o'er Sicilian waves.
Thereafter Roman youth grew more successful in their bold exploits, and temples wasted by impious Punic raids, again received their gods erect, and then at length the faithless Hannibal thus spoke;
as stags, the prey of ravening wolves, we needlessly pursue the men whom to elude by flight is triumph rare.
That race which tossed on Tuscan seas bore bravely on to Italy from flaming Troy their gods, their sons, and aged sires, like oak lopped by the sturdy axe in Algidus where dusky leaves abound, through losses and through wounds derives new strength and spirit from the very steel.
Not sounder did the Hydra, cut in twain, grow ever and anon 'gainst Hercules, who brooked not to be foiled, nor did the Colchians, or Echion's Thebes produce a greater wonder.
Plunge it in the depths, it comes forth brighter than before;
strive with it, amidst great applause it will overthrow the victor, fresh and strong, and will wage wars, for wives to speak of.
No more, now, shall I send to Carthage boastful news;
fallen, fallen, are all the hope and fortune of our name with fall of Hasdrubal.
There's nothing that the Claudian line cannot effect, which Jupiter himself with power benign defends, and Caesar's forethought safely steers through all anxieties of war.
Best guardian of the Roman race, born when the gods were kind, you stay away, now far too long ;
a quick return you promised to the Fathers' Sacred " House";
oh, then, at once come back.
Kind leader, to your country now restore its light and hope;
for like the spring, when-soe'er your countenance has shone with brightness on our path, the day goes happier and the sunlight seems more pure.
As with omens, vows, and prayers a mother seeks her son's return­ whom Notus with his surly blasts from his dear home detains, kept longer than his annual stay beyond Carpathian waves-nor turns she from the winding shore her steady gaze;
so, smitten with sincere regrets his country longs for Caesar.
When you are here the ox in safety walks the meads :
Ceres and bounteous
Plenty still richer make the fields:
the sailors scud securely o'er a peaceful 1 sea :
Faith shrinks from thought of blame :
by no intrigues are honest homes defiled :
habits and laws have stamped out every taint of crime :
mothers are praised for children like their sire :
and punishment, a close attendant, treads on the heels of crime.
Who, while Caesar lives, would dread the Parthian or frost-chilled Scythian, who, the brood which rugged Germans rear ?
Who would regard the war of savage Spain ?
Each citizen concludes the day midst hills he calls his own, and to the widowed elm-trees trains his vines :
and then in joy of heart he to his wine returns, and at the second course invokes you as a god.
You with many a prayer, you with wine from goblets poured he worships, and with the Lares joins your name, like Greece in pious memory of Castor and of mighty Hercules.
0 gracious prince, would that to Italy you would vouchsafe long holidays !
At early morn, while day is fresh, in sober mood we pray this prayer.
At eve we pray it, flushed with wine, when Sol beneath the ocean sinks.
O Deity, whom, as avenger of a vaunting tongue, the seed of Niobe were doomed to feel, and Tityus, the lustful ravisher, and brave Achilles, Phthia's son, well-nigh the conqueror of lofty Troy, mightier than others but for you less than a match, though, warrior bold, the son of sea-born Thetis shook with awful spear the Dardan towers.
He like a pine felled by the biting steel, or as a cypress by strength of Eurus whelmed, " lay large and long," and bent his neck in Trojan dust.
Prisoned in the horse that basely feigned Minerva's sacred gift, he would have spurned to fall by stealth upon the Trojans in their ill-timed holiday, and on Priam's house all-joyous in the dance;
but openly to cap­ tives merciless, woe's me !
woe's me!
what awful deed, he would have burned in Grecian fires the speechless child, even him still lying in his mother's womb:
had not the Father of the Gods, by your entreaties and by those of Venus swayed, granted to Æneas' fortunes other walls with better omens reared.
Phoebus, god of the lyre, who taught the Muse Thalia silver tones, who in Xanthus' stream dost bathe thy locks, youthful Agyieus, defend the honour of the Roman Muse.
Me Phoebus has inspired, to me has Phoebus given the name of poet and the art of song;
maidens of highest rank, and youths from noble fathers sprung, Diana's special care, who with her bow checks in their flight the stag and lynx, preserve the Lesbian measure and observe with care the beat my thumb directs, singing in order due Latona's son, in order due the moon with crescent light, ripener of crops, and swift in rolling on the hasting months.
Some day you'll say, when now a bride;
" when the revolving year brought on the festal times, I sang a hymn which pleased the gods, well trained in strains of Horace, poet dear.
"The snows have fled, the grass now to the plains returns, and foliage to the trees;
the land its changes undergoes, and the rivers course within their banks with lessening streams.
The Graces with the Nymphs now dare to lead abroad their choirs in light array.
The passing year, and flight of time which hurries on the blessed day, give warning that we must not hope for things that perish not.
The cold is mollified by western winds;
the summer, destined itself to die, tramples on spring, as soon as fruitful autumn sheds its yield, and winter soon returns again with all its want of life.
But yet the swift recurring moons repair the losses of the skies;
while we, when once we sink where sire Æneas sank and Ancus and rich Tullus too, are nought but dust and shadow.
Who knows if heavenly gods are adding to our morrow's hours the total of to-day?
All that to pleasure you shall give shall 'scape the clutch of greedy heirs.
When once, Torquatus, you are dead, and Minos shall have passed on you his lordly doom, nor rank, nor eloquence, nor piety shall give you back to earth;
for not Diana's self frees from infernal gloom the chaste Hippolytus, nor from his dear Pirithous has Theseus power to wrench Lethean bonds.
To comrades, Censorinus, would I goblets give with right good will, and works in bronze, to suit their taste, and tripods too, rewards of valiant Greeks, nor those the meanest gifts that you should gain, were I but rich in gems of art, like those which Scopas and Parrhasius made-he skilled to form in stone, and he in liquid tints, a mortal man or even a god.
But I have not the means, nor does your wealth or taste such dainties seek.
In poems you delight:
poems I can give and name their value, too.
Not marble carved by order of the State, in which both soul and life return to heroes after death, nor hurried flight and braggart threats of Hannibal, on Hannibal flung back, nor fires of impious Carthage, can tell more clearly than Calabrian Muse, the fame of him who gained from conquered Africa a lasting name;
nor if the written page should fail to tell your deeds well done, would you receive a due reward.
What now would be the son of Ilia and of Mars, if jealous silence hid the meeds of Romulus ?
His merits, and the public voice, and words of mighty bards wrest Æacus from Stygian waves, and make for him a lasting home in Islands of the blest.
The Muse forbids that he who praise deserves should ever die.
The Muse secures his happiness by gift of heaven.
And thus it is that Hercules of restless might enjoys the envied feasts of Jove, and so it is that sons of Tyndarus, a constellation bright, rescue from lowest depths the shattered ship:
and so, too, Bacchus, his temples decked with vine leaf, brings to a happy issue faithful prayers.
Lest haply you should think the words are doom'd to die, which I, born on the banks of roaring Aufidus, adapt to music of the lyre by arts unknown before ;
-though Homer of Maeonian stock obtains the foremost place, yet the Pindaric and the Cean Muse, and strains of bold Alcaeus, which threatened tyrant kings, and stately lines of old Stesichorus retain their fame:
nor has Time destroyed Anacreon's sportive lays of long ago :
-love still breathes fresh, and passions live still warm, confided to the lyre of the Aeolian maid.
To love not Argive Helen only was inflamed by gallant's well-trimmed locks, and gold be­ spangled robes, and by array of royal pomp;
nor was Teucer first to aim his arrows from Cydonian bow;
nor was a Troy but once besieged.
Idomeneus, in battle strong, and Sthenelus the brave, were not the only chiefs who fought great battles worthy to be sung;
nor was the fearless Hector or Deiphobus of mettle keen, the first to feel a fatal wound for children and for faithful wife.
Before King Agamemnon's day brave men were found in plenty, but all are whelmed in endless night, unwept, unknown, because they lacked a sacred bard.
Valour concealed scarce differs aught from cowardice en­ tombed.
Lollius, I will not pass you by in silence, un­ honoured in my verse, nor lightly bear that the neglect, of envy bred, should mar the credit of your many toils.
You have a mind well-skilled in life's affairs, and of unshaken nerve in weal or woe, swift to punish greed and wrong, and proof 'gainst gold that all things to itself attracts;
consul too you stand, not of one year alone, but oft, as like a good and faithful judge,1 it prefers honour to gain, and with con­ temptuous looks rejects the bribes of guilty men, and bears its arms victorious through opposing hosts.
You would not rightly call him happy who possesses much:
far better does he claim the name of 11 happy man " who knows to use with wisdom heaven's gifts, and how to bear the pinch of poverty;
who dreads dishonour more than death, who's not afraid to die for well-loved friends and fatherland.
Still hard of heart and strong in Venus' gifts, when down shall come, unwished for, on your pride, and when the locks which on your shoulders float have fallen to the barber's clip, and the complexion, richer than the bloom of blush­ ing rose, shall by its change have altered Ligurinus to a stubbly face, as off as in the mirror you behold yourself, another man, you thus will say:
" Why had I not in boy­ hood's days that mind I now possess, or why with present feelings do not beardless cheeks return ?
I have a cask of Alban wine, of nine years old and more;
and in my garden, Phyllis, parsley grows for weaving chaplets;
of ivy there is plenteous store, with which, when you have bound your hair, you look so bright;
the house all glitters with the polished plate;
the altar with the sacred vervain deck'd longs to be sprinkled with the blood of slaughtered lamb;
all hands are hurrying on the work;
the boys and girls rush about from place to place;
the flames in bustling haste whirl up the grimy smoke in wreathing coil.
But yet, to let you know the joys to which you're called,-the Ides are to be kept by you, the day that cuts in two the month of April, dear to the sea-born Venus-a day observed by me, more sacred almost than the one that gave me birth, because 'tis from this day my loved Maecenas counts successive years.
Telephus, at whom you aim, a youth above your rank, a rich and sprightly girl has won, and holds him hard and fast in pleasing chains.
Scorched Phaëthon deters from soaring hopes;
and winged Pegasus, who scorned to bear Bellerophon, a knight of earth, affords a solemn proof that you should seek what best befits your state, and an unequal match avoid, by deeming it a sin to hope for what you may not have.
Come, then, the very last of all my loves,-for henceforth none shall fire my heart-some measures learn with me which you may render with your charming voice :
your songs shall lessen gloomy cares.
Now Thracian winds which wait on spring and calm the sea, begin to swell the sails;
now neither are the meadows stiff with frost, nor do the rivers brawl, swollen by melting of the winter snows.
The hapless bird now builds her nest, which piteously laments the fate of Itys, and is a lasting blot on Cecrop's house, because she cruelly avenged the brutal lusts of Kings.
The shepherds midst the young fresh grass play tunes upon the pipe and charm the god who takes delight in flocks and in Arcadia's dusky hills.
Virgil, the season of the year brings thirst;
but if you choose to quaff the vintage pressed at Cales, client as you are of noble youths, you shall deserve your wine by gift of spike­ nard.
A tiny box of nard will easily draw forth a goodly cask, now lying in Sulpicius' stores, fully fit new hopes to raise, and warranted to banish bitter cares.
Then if for joys like those you're keen, come quickly with your share:
I don't intend that free of cost you'll mellow on my cups, as though I were a wealthy man in well-filled house.
But put aside delays and eager haste for gain :
and mindful of the funeral fires, mix short-lived folly, while you may, with graver plans.
To play the fool is pleasant, at a time.
Lyce, the gods have heard my prayer, the gods have heard me, Lyce.
You're getting old and yet you wish to figure as a belle, and with a shameless face you sport and drink, and when "well-drunk" you call on laggard Love with quavering voice.
On blooming Chia's pretty cheeks, skilled as she is in song, he vigil keeps.
For with provok­ ing slight he passes by the withered oaks, and at sight of you recoils, because your blackened teeth, your wrinkles, and your snowy head make you a fright indeed.
Now neither robes of Coan tint, nor gems of brilliant hue, restore to you the days which fleeting Time has put aside and lodged in musty Calendars.
Where has your beauty fled?
Where your complexion?
Where your graceful movements ?
What is there now of Lyce left, that charm­ ing Lyce, who breathed forth love, who stole my heart and soul away and made me quite beside myself "-once a form with beauty blessed, next Cinara herself, well known to all, and graced with every winning way ?
But to Cinara the Fates gave years both few and brief, to keep alive long while old Lyce, matching the record of the dotard crow;
that ardent youths might see, with laughter loud, the once bright torch to ashes wasted quite.
Augustus, greatest of chiefs where'er the sun lights up the habitable globe, what zealous care of Senate or of Roman people can ever hope by honours adequate to hand your virtues down to distant times, by carvings on memorial stone or lasting annals of the State ?
Your might in war Vindelic hosts, free heretofore from Latin rule, have lately learned to feel.
For valiant Drusus with your veterans has crushed the bold Genauni, savage race, and Breuni swift in flight, and levelled to the ground their castles perched on giddy Alpine heights, with slaughter more than double what they dealt:
then, later on, the elder Nero fought a stubborn fight, and, with your fortune's star, subdued the giant Raeti—a wondrous sight to see, with what destruction in the fray of Mars he over­ came those hearts that to a freeman's death were pledged :
just such as when the south winds lash the " tameless " waves, -the Pleiads shining through the riven clouds :
untiring he to scourge the foe's brigades and through the midst of fires to urge his furious steed :
so rolls the bull-formed Aufidus, which drains the kingdom of Apulian Daunus, when it roars in flood and threatens devastation, vast and wide, to the well­ cultured fields, as Claudius destroyed the steel-clad lines of the barbarian host with mighty shock, and mowing down from front to rear he strewed the ground with dead, victor with little loss, you giving troops and counsel and your favouring gods.
For just three lustra after Alexandria had humbly opened wide to you her harbours and her empty halls, kind Fortune brought a happy issue to the war, and to your past campaigns has added glory, and the wished-for wreath.
You the Cantabrian, never tamed before, the Mede, the Indian and the Nomad Scyth, regard with awe, 0 Gracious Guard of Italy and Sovereign Rome.
The Nile who hides his foun­ tain head, the Danube and the Tigris, swift as arrow's speed, obey you:
and the sea, of monsters full, which roars on coasts of Britain, far away:
the men of Gaul that dread not death, the hardy Spaniard, and the Sygambri, who delight in blood, have sheathed the sword and pay you homage due.
When on my lyre I wished to tell of battles fought and cities sacked, Apollo sternly warned me not to spread my sails on the Etruscan main.
Your Age, 0 Caesar, has to our land brought back abundant crops and to our Jove restored the standards wrenched from haughty Parthian fanes :
and closed the doors of Roman Janus, free from war, and curbed the licence which exceeds due bounds, and stamped out crime, and brought again the virtues of the good old days, by which the Latin name and power of Italy have grown so great, and the Empire's fame and glory spread to rising of the sun from where he sets.
While Caesar guards the State, no civil broil nor violence shall banish our repose, nor passion's rage which forges swords, and, to their misery, sets cities by the ears.
Not those who drink from Danube's depths shall break the Julian laws;
not Getae, nor the Seric hordes, nor faithless Parthians, nor those reared up on banks of Scythian Don.
Then let us, both on common and on festal days, amidst the gifts of mirthful Bacchus, with children and with wife pray to the gods, and as our fathers did, in strains joined to the notes of Lydian flute sing of our chiefs who lived their lives like men";
of Troy, too, and Anchises, and the seed of bounteous Venus.
The Ludi Seculares were not held at the end of each century, as the name would imply, but at irregular in­ tervals, on the occurrence of some great event, or for the purpose of marking an extraordinary epoch.
The hymn sung on such occasions was called the " Carmen Seculare."
Horace was chosen by Augustus as the " Poet Laureate " at the celebration of the Ludi in B.C. 17 :
and his poem is not unworthy of the great Lyrist, or of the choice made by the Emperor.
These games seem to have been called the Ludi Taren­ tini, or Terentini, or Taurii, in republican times, but during the Empire the name was changed to Ludi Seculares, or " Century Games."
Their origin is by some ascribed to Valerius Publicola, in 509-8 B.C.
It is said that they were instituted to avert a plague, and that they were held in honour of Dis and Proserpina.
From the time of Valerius Publicola down to Augustus they were held only three times, but there are no data to prove in what year or on what occasion these celebrations took place.
No doubt they were held at this time to give eclat and a sort of national sanction to the move which Caesar had recently made in assuming supreme power, for a second period.
But this celebration by Augustus was very different from those of republican times.
Dis and Proserpine who in former days were the chief Deities were now relegated to the very end of the list of those to whom sacrifices were offered.
The festival was held in summer and continued for three days and three nights.
On the first day, games were held in the Tarentum, a part of the Campus Martius, which, as it was said, had belonged to Tarquinius Superbus, and sacrifices were offered to many of the gods.
The Emperor himself began the solemn part of the proceedings at the second hour of the night by offering three lambs to the Parcae, on three altars specially erected.
The blood of the victims was sprinkled on these and the carcases were burned.
A sort of theatre was constructed in the Tarentum in which festive hymns were sung, and other ceremonies performed, including theatrical pieces. "
During the morn­ ing of the first day the people went to the Capitol to offer sacrifices to Jupiter;
thence they returned to the Tarentum to sing choruses in honour of Diana and Apollo.
On the second day the noblest matrons assembled on the Capitol, performed supplications, sang hymns to the gods, and visited the altar of Juno.
The Emperor, and the Quindecemviri (who kept the Sibylline books, and who had ordered this celebration) offered sacrifices, which had been before vowed, to the great Divinities.
On the third day Greek and Latin choruses were sung in the sanctuary of Apollo, by three times nine boys and as many maidens of great beauty whose parents were still alive."
These hymns implored the favour of the gods for all the interests of the empire.
One of these at the games of 17 B.C. was the Carmen Seculare of Horace.
In later times there were celebrations in the reigns of Claudius and of Domitian.
The last was that of Philippus, A.D. 248.
The term Epode designated, in later times, a poem in which a shorter verse followed a longer one;
strictly it meant the shorter line only, which was a sort of ἐπῳδός or echo of the longer one.
It is thus applied to any of the odes included in this " Liber Epodon," or Liber v. of the Odes.
Horace himself calls these Odes not Epodes but Iambi.
The Epodes seem to have been written when Horace was comparatively young, and about the same time as his earliest Satires.
They have certain characteristics in common with the Satires, such as acerbity and animosity ;
but they do not deal in generalities like the Satires, they delight rather in personalities, as in X. against Maevius, and in IV.
against some man of low birth and upbringing who gave himself airs:
and against Canidia and horrid rites.
No. XI. in praise of country life, and XVI.
deploring the misfortune and the sin of civil war, are of a totally different type.
Most of them would seem to have been written between the battle of Philippi and that off Actium.
O Phoebus, and Diana, sovereign of the woods, bright ornament of heaven, adored and still to be adored, 0 grant what at this sacred time we ask, a time at which the Sibyl's verses have advised that youths and maidens, choice and pure, should sing a hymn in honour of the gods with whom the Seven Hills have favour found.
O bounteous Sun, who with thy glittering car dost usher in the light and hide it too, and who from day to day com'st forth afresh-another, yet the same, nought may'st thou ever see more glorious than Rome.
0 Ilithyia, kind to make way for timely births, preserve all mothers, whether thou prefer'st Lucina as thy name, or wishest Genitalis.
0 God­ dess, rear up for us a race of manly men, and with their aid support the Senate's laws for female wedlock and for marriage rites teeming with offspring, so that a perfect cycle, ten times eleven years, may again bring round the hymns, and again renew the sports with thronging crowds for three bright days and three as pleasing nights.
And you, 0 Fates, truthful to tell what once has been decreed, and what the changeless end confirms, join happy destinies to those already past.
Let Earth, which yields both fruits and flocks, gift Ceres with a wreath of corn, and may refresh­ ing rain and healthful breeze from upper air nourish the produce of the fields.
Apollo, mild and gentle with arrow laid aside, hear thou the suppliant youths!
0 Moon, two-horned queen of stars, the maidens hear!
If Rome's your handiwork, and if the bands of Troy gained footing on Etruscan shores-that remnant bid to change, with safe career, their city and their homes-for whom the good Æneas, saved from his country's fall, secured an open way through burning Troy, unscathed both he and they, to give them more than they had left behind.
Ye Gods, give upright morals to our willing youth, give peace and quiet to their calm old age:
give to the race of Romulus prosperity, and offspring, and every honour.
And what the noble son of Venus and Anchises prays you for to-day with snow-white bulls, let him obtain, in fight superior, but gentle to the prostrate foe.
The Parthian now fears our armies powerful by land and sea, and to our Alban fasces pays respect.
And now the Scythian and the Indian, lately proud, beg in humility to know our sovereign will.
Now Faith, and Peace, and Glory, and Purity of early days, and Virtue, long in disrepute, dare to return, and Plenty happy with her well-filled horn appears.
May Phœbus as our seer, decked with his glittering bow, by the nine Muses loved, who by his healing art relieves the body's wearied limbs, if with a kindly eye he views the altars of the Palatine, prolong the Roman State and Latium's weal for yet another lustrum and an ever happier age.
And may Diana hear, who in Mount Aventine and Algidus holds sway, who heeds the Quindecemvirs' prayers, and to the supplications of the young accords a friendly ear.
We, the choir, taught to sing the praise of Phoebus and Diana both, bear to our homes a sure and certain hope that Jove and all the Gods with one consent approve our earnest prayers.
O dear Maecenas, you mean to venture in Liburnian craft among the towering Men-of-War, ready to face all Cæsar's dangers at peril of your life.
And what of me, to whom, if you survive, existence is a joy,—if otherwise, a load?
Shall I, then, as you bid, pursue an easy life to give no pleasure save with you—or shall I brave this toil with that resolve which all but cowards ought ?
I'll brave it, and with a dauntless heart will follow you o'er Alpine heights;
or over savage Caucasus;
or even to the farthest bay of western shores.
You well may ask how I can aid your labours by my own, unwarlike as I am and void of strength?
When by your side I shall feel less the dread which haunts the absent with more potent force :
just as a bird when waiting on her tiny brood fears more for them, when left, the serpents' trail, not that were she near she present help could lend.
Right gladly will I serve in this and every war for surer hope to gain your favour,-not that my plough may strive and strain, when yoked to more and stronger steers, or that my flocks before the Dog-Star heat may change Apulian for Lucanian 11 runs ” nor that my country house may stand in glittering show by lofty Tusculum's Circaean walls.
Enough and more your bounty has enriched me;
forbid it, heaven, that I should hoard what as a niggard Chremes I might bury in the earth, or wildly squander as a spendthrift rake.
Happy is he, who far from business cares, like men in early days, tills with his steers his fathers' fields, from every usurer free:
nor as a soldier is he startled by the brawling trumpet note ;
nor as a trader does he dread an angry sea;
he shuns the Courts of Law, and the proud portals of citizens in power.
And so he either weds the lofty poplar to the saplings of the vine ;
or in sequestered Vale surveys his herds of cattle as they roam :
or lopping with his knife the useless boughs inserts more thriving grafts ;
or in clean jars he stores the honey from the combs withdrawn;
or shears the gentle sheep:
or when the Autumn has from the soil put forth its head with mellow fruit adorned, how he delights to pluck the pears he grafted, and cull the grape that rivals purple dye, with which your service to reward, Priapus, and yours, father Silvanus, who the sacred land­ marks guard.
Sometimes he's pleased to lie beneath an aged holm, sometimes upon the soft and matted grass.
Meanwhile the water in deep channels flows:
in the woods the birds send forth their varied cries, and fountains murmur with their welling rills, which light and gentle slumber may invite.
But when the winter time of thundering Jove collects its snows and showers, either with many a dog on this side and on that he drives the furious boars to the opposing toils, or sets his wide-meshed nets with polished poles, snares for the greedy thrush;
or catches in his gin the timid hare and cranes from over sea, a welcome prey.
What man is there who midst pursuits like these forgets not worrying cares which love brings forth?
But if a chaste and loving wife on her part keeps the house and rears sweet children up, like Sabine dame or sunburnt spouse of brisk Apulian, piling the sacred hearth with seasoned wood against her wearied lord's return, and shutting in the osier pen her healthy flock exhausts their swelling teats:
and drawing from the well-cleansed cask the wine of this year's growth, prepares a homely meal:
no shell-fish from the Lucrine lake would please me more, nor scar nor turbot, if a tempest howling over eastern waves brings any to our sea:
I would not eat with more delight the guinea fowl, nor heathcock from Ionian moor, than olives plucked from richest boughs or sorrel plant that loves the meads, and mallows good for sickly frames, or lamb at Terminalia slain, or kid just rescued from the ravening wolf.
Amidst these feasts how nice it is to see the pastured sheep all hurrying home:
the wearied oxen dragging with their languid necks th' inverted share, and the menials seated round the glistening Lares, proof of a wealthy home ?
When Alfius the usurer had spoken thus, intending all at once to be a country squire, he called in all his money on the Ides-but on the Kalends he seeks again to put it out on loan.
If ever man should strangle with an impious hand his aged sire, let him be fed on garlic, than hemlock deadlier far.
What iron stomachs must our reapers have!
What drug is this that on my vitals wreaks its hate ?
Has vipers' blood among these herbs been mixed, unknown to me?
Or did Canidia dress the deadly dish ?
Medea, when she loved their noble chief 'bove all the Argo's crew, with this anointed Jason as he went to bind the bulls with yokes, till then unknown.
By presents smeared with this she on her rival took revenge,-then fled away on serpents' wings.
Nor ever did such misty heat from flaming stars brood on Apulia's arid plains:
nor did the fatal gift more fiercely burn on strong Alcides' frame.
But, friend Maecenas, you who love your joke, if you ever covet aught like this, I hope your Love may with her hand prevent your kiss and lay her down at farthest corner of the couch.
Such enmity as falls by nature to the lot of wolves and lambs, so great is mine to you—you whose back is wealed by Spanish lash, whose legs by hard unyielding fetters have been galled.
Although you walk with purse-proud step, your fortune does not change your race.
Do you not see that as you pace the Sacred Street in robe twice three ells broad, the unrestrained disgust of those that come and go turns on you every scoffing eye ?
This wretch (they say) cut by the lash of triumvirs even till the crier wearied, now farms a thousand acres of Falernian land, and with his steeds wears down the Appian Way, and in despite of Otho sits in the foremost rows, a mighty knight!
What good is it that beak-bowed ships of massive size are sent 'gainst pirates and 'gainst bands of slaves, if he or such as he is Military Tribune?
But, 0 ye gods, who rule in heaven the earth and human kind, what does this tumult mean ?
And why are all their eyes turned fierce on me alone ?
You by your children I adjure, if e'er Lucina when invoked was present at a real birth, by this bootless purple robe I pray, by Jove who will condemn all this, why do you gaze at me with step­ dame's glare, or as a wild beast by the spear assailed ?
When the boy had thus complained with trembling lips, and in the midst of these stood still, his marks of rank stripped off-a tender frame, such as might touch the savage Thracian heart,—Canidia, her hair and unkempt head entwined with tiny snakes, orders that wild-fig stems up-torn from dead men's graves, the funeral cypress, eggs of the nightly screech-owl, and plumage too, besmeared with blood of loathsome toad, and plants which Iolcos, and Hiberia fruitful in poisons, send, and bones snatched from the mouth of famished dog, should all be burned in magic fires.
But Sagana with kilted dress, sprinkling through all the house Avernian water, bristles up with hair on end, like the sea urchin's spines, or as the mane of running boar.
Veia, nowise deterred by conscious guilt, dug up the ground with sturdy spade-groaning o'er the toil in which the boy immured might pine and waste at sight of food, changed often in the tedious day, whilst he projected with his face as far as swimmer's body overtops the water, as if sus­ pended by the chin ;
that his marrow and his liver parched and dry might be cut out and then become a lover's potion, soon as e'er his eyeballs, fixed on the food debarred, had been dissolved.
Both Naples, lounge of idlers, and every village near, believed that Folia of Ariminum, a hag of keenest lust, failed not to act her part,—she who draws down the stars from heaven and even the moon by magic voice.
Here fell Canidia, gnawing her unpared nail with livid tooth;
what said she ?
or what said she not ?
0 trusty witnesses to all I do, 0 Night and thou Diana, who Silence rul'st when secret rites are done, now, now attend-now turn your anger and your power against the houses of our foes.
While the wild beasts in the dreaded woods lie hid, listless through pleasing sleep, may Subura's dogs bark at the aged rake-a sight, the sport of all-scented with nard of such a power that even my cunning hands could never make a better.
What has befallen ?
Why have my direful drugs of barbarous Medea's kind lost their effect ?
with which she took revenge upon her haughty rival, great Creon's child,­ then fled;
when the cloak, a gift with poison soaked, took off the bride by fiery heat.
And yet, nor blade nor root in scrub and thickets hid has leaped my search.
He sleeps on beds touched with forgetfulness of all his harlot dames.
Ah!
ah !
he walks at will, set free by spell of some more potent witch.
0 Varus, doomed to many tears, 'tis by no common draught that you shall hurry back to me, nor is it by Marsian spells your heart shall turn again:
a stronger philtre will I mix, a stronger cup will I prepare to quell your proud disdain, and sooner shall the heaven sink beneath the sea, with earth spread out above, than that you fail to burn with love for me as now this pitch is by the sooty flames con­ sumed.
On this the boy no longer tried to move the fiendish hags by soothing words but doubtful how he'd best the silence break he hurled at them Thyestes' prayers:
“Your magic may transform the mighty laws of right and wrong, but not man's retribution;
with curses I'll pursue you all:
for execration dread no victim shall atone.
Nay rather, when doomed to death by you I shall have breathed my last, as a Fury I will haunt you in the night, and as a shade, with crooked talons I will tear your face, such is the Manes' power, and seated on your troubled breast, by terrors I will chase your sleep away.
From street to street the mob assailing you on every side with stones shall crush you filthy hags :
then after that the wolves and vultures of the Esquiline shall carry far and wide your still unburied limbs.
Nor shall this sight escape my parents, who shall, alas !
survive me.
"Why do you as a cur at harmless strangers snarl, a very coward when confronting wolves?
Why don't you rather, if you can, turn here your windy threats and make for me who'll bite you back again ?
For like a tawny Spartan or Molossian hound, the shepherds' sturdy friend, with ear erect I'll follow on through deepest snows the game that is in front, whate'er it be.
But you, when you have filled the grove with threatening bark, sniff at the food flung down to you.
Beware!
I say, beware!
for very savage 'gainst the bad I raise my ready horn, like him whom as a son-in-law the false Lycambes spurned, or him who was to Bupalus a bitter foe.
What!
if one assail me with envenomed tooth, shall I without revenge just blubber like a boy?
Where rush you ?
Where, on bloody deeds intent ?
Or why are swords but lately sheathed again by right hands grasped ?
Has there too little of the Latin blood been shed on land and sea ?
Not that the Roman might by fire consume the towers of Carthage, jealous of our might, or that the Briton, still a freeman, might in chains descend the Sacred Way, but that this city, as the Parthians wish, might perish by its own right hand.
And yet this custom never held 'twixt wolves and lions, which show their hate to none but alien kind.
Is it blind frenzy, or some stronger power that hounds you on ?
Or former guilt ?
Give some reply :
—
They answer not, and sickly pallor overspreads the face, and minds are smitten dumb.
And, so it is :
relentless fates and guilt of brother's death pursue the Romans, ever since the blood of guiltless Remus streamed to the ground, a curse to later sons.
O blest Maecenas !
When shall I by Cæsar's victory made glad, join you beneath your lofty roof-so Jove has willed -in quaffing cups of Caecuban for happy feasts reserved, the lyre meantime, with flutes combined, emitting strains, that in the Dorian, these in the Phrygian mode ?
As late we did, when the Neptunian chief,-his ships all burnt,­ swept from the strait, took flight, threatening the City with the chains which he had taken, as a friend, off treacherous slaves.
A Roman citizen, alas !—you later sons will scarce believe-slave to a woman, as a soldier carries stakes and arms, and stoops to serve e'en wrinkled eunuchs;
and amidst Rome's eagles bold the Sun vile curtains sees.
Chafing at such a sight, two thousand Gauls wheeled round their steeds and bid great Cæsar hail, and the sterns of hostile ships, urged quickly to the left, lie safely in the harbour lodged.
Hail, God of Triumph!
Dost
Thou delay the golden chariots and the heifers never yoked?
Hail, God of Triumph !
Not from Jugurthine war didst thou bring back a leader such as this, not Africanus even, whose valour raised a tomb for him on fallen Carthage.
The foe overcome by land and sea exchanged his purple robe for garb of woe.
And now he either makes for Crete, by hundred cities famed, with adverse winds to strive, or seeks the Syrtes by stormy Notus vexed, or floats at random on some sea, without an aim.
Bring here, my boy, still larger cups, some Chian or some Lesbian wine, or fill me up some Cæcuban to check my rising qualm.
It does me good, by pleasant wine to dissipate my cares, and banish every fear for Caesar's lasting weal.
With evil luck unmoored the ship sets sail that bears on board ill-odoured Maevius.
Forget not, Auster, to lash her with your dreaded waves on this side and on that.
May black and stormy Eurus scatter wide her cordage and her broken oars upon the upheaved sea !
May North wind rise, as high as when it breaks the quivering oaks on mountain* heights, and let not friendly star appear that dismal night on which the fell Orion sets :
and let her not be borne on calmer seas than was the band of Grecian victors when Pallas turned her wrath from new-burnt Troy against the ship of wicked Ajax.
Oh, what a toil's before your crew, what sallow paleness waits yourself, and those unmanly wails and prayers to angry Jove, when the Ionian sea roaring beneath the blasts of watery South shall burst your hull.
But if the dainty prey stretched on the winding shore shall give the cormorants delight, a lustful he-goat and a lamb in honour of the storms shall die.
Pettius, no longer does it please me as of old to write my verselets, sore smitten as I am with love which seeks me out above the rest to set my heart aflame for tender youths and maidens too.
This third December now is shaking from the woods their leafy honours since I gave o'er my frenzied passion for Inachia dear.
Ah me!—for I'm ashamed of such disgrace-what a talk I was through all the town !
Those jovial feasts too I regret in which my listless ways, my silence, and my long-drawn sighs betrayed the lover.
Is't true that matched 'gainst gold the poor man's honest heart can nought avail ?
Thus wailing in your ear I made complaint, soon as the god who shame removes had driven from their hiding place my secret thoughts, as I grew warm with stronger wine.
But, should my anger once boil forth without restraint, and scatter to the winds those useless remedies which nowise ease my grievous ills, my modesty displaced shall cease to strive with those so far beneath me.
When sternly firm I had before you praised my purpose, though urged to seek my home, I yet was borne, with wavering steps, to doors, to me, alas!
not kind, to thresholds against which, woe's me !
I bruised my loins and sides.
. . .
.
A dismal storm has caused the heavens to frown, and showers of rain and snow bring down the upper air.
The sea now moans, and now the woods, by force of northern blasts;
let us embrace, my friends, the chance this day presents, and while our limbs are strong, and it becomes our years, let sadness from the clouded brow be sent adrift.
Do you (mine host) produce the wine the press gave forth in con­ sulship of dear Torquatus.
Speak not of other things :
the deity, perhaps, will by a gracious change bring all these right as once they were.
Now 'tis a pleasure to anoint our hair with Persian nard, and by the lyre to ease our minds of dreaded cares.
As once the famous Centaur sang to his noble ward :
"
Hero of unconquered might, thou mortal son of Thetis the Divine, the Trojan land's in store for thee, which Xanthus' cold and tiny stream, and easy flowing Simois divide, return from which the Fates have barred by destined length of thread, nor shall thy mother, nymph of ocean, e'er bear thee home again.
There lighten every ill of life by music and by wine.
those sweets consolers of depressing grief.
"Maecenas, honest friend, you wound me when you often ask why easy indolence has spread so deep oblivion o'er my deepest powers, as if with greedy throat I quaffed the cups which bring Lethean sleep;
for Love, the god of L ove, forbids me to complete the verses promised long, the lyric strains I had begun.
Just so, they say, Anacreon of Teos was fired by Samian Bathyllus, and often on his hollow lyre bemoaned his love in measures free from rules.
You know yourself what 'tis to waste away with fires of love, but if no brighter flame set Troy ablaze when close besieged, be happy in your lot.
Phryne consumes my heart, freedwoman though she is, and with one lover not content.
'
Twas night, and in a cloudless sky the moon shone forth among the lesser stars, while you, prepared to slight the sacred honour of the mighty gods, swore in the words I gave, clasping me with clinging arms more tightly than the lofty oak is by the ivy bound,—“ That long as wolves should be the foes of sheep, long as Orion, sailor's bane, should stir the wintry sea, long as Apollo's youthful locks should in the breezes float, so long true love should last 'tween you and me."
Neaera, you shall deeply sorrow for my firm resolve !
For if a spark of manly pride abides in Flaccus, he will not bear that you devote your every night to one more loved, and in anger he will seek a kindred soul, and if well founded hate should in his heart find place, his steadfast mind shall not give way to beauty once disliked.
But you, whoe'er you are that strut about more fortunate than I, and proud from my ill-luck, though you be rich in flocks and land in plenty, and though Pactolus rush on you in flood of gold, and though the secrets of Pythagoras, once and again revived, escape you not, and though in beauty you surpass the lovely Nireus, you shall, alas!
bewail her love transferred elsewhere;
but I, on my part, shall enjoy my laugh in turn.
A second age is now being wasted by our civil wars, and Rome is tottering to her fall by forces from within.
That city which nor Marsian borderers had power to sack, nor Porsena's Etruscan hordes, with all his threats, nor Capua's rival might, nor Spartacus the bold, nor the Gauls, in revolution false, could take, nor warlike Germany subdue with blue eyed hosts, nor Hannibal, by parents hated­ that city we shall ourselves destroy, an impious race of cursed blood, and once again her site shall be the wild beasts' home.
A foreign conqueror, alas!
shall on her ashes tread, the trooper with his charger's echoing hoof shall make the city ring, and in flush of pride shall toss about the bones of Romulus (a sight of shame !), which heretofore have never known the wind or sun.
Perhaps you all with one accord, at least the better part, inquire what's need­ ful to relieve you from your dreadful ills:
let no resolve prevail o'er this, to go where'er our feet shall bear us, where'er the South or stormy Africus shall call us over seas;
as the Phocaean State by oath of imprecation bound, fled from their fathers' fields and homes, and left the holy shrines to be possessed by boars and ravening wolves.
Is it agreed ?
Or can another better counsel give ?
Why do we hesitate to take to ship in happy hours ?
But let us swear to this :
soon as the stones raised from the waters' depths shall to the surface float let it not be wrong to come again;
and let us not be loath to turn our sails for home, soon as the swollen
Po has washed Matinian heights, or lofty Apennine has run to sea, and a strange desire has by a novel lust made monstrous unions, so that the tigers may delight to mate with stags, and the gentle dove to couple with the kite;
and that the herds, made trustful, may no longer fear the tawny lions, and that the he-goat, now grown smooth, may love the briny sea.
Let all of us free citizens, or those above the untaught herd, depart, when we by imprecations dire have bound ourselves to this and all that can cut off a sweet return :
let those that fear and cannot hope still press ill- omened beds.
But you that bear a manly soul, away with woman's grief and haste beyond Etruscan shores.
The ocean stream that girds the world awaits us:
let's seek the lands, the happy lands, those islands of the blest, where earth untilled returns each year rich crops of corn, and vines unpruned still flourish ever on, and the olive boughs that never fail send forth their buds, and the dusky fig adorns its native tree :
from the hollow oaks honey in plenty flows, and lightly the water from the mountain heights descends with rippling stream.
There goats unbidden to the milking come, and the flocks for love bring home their swollen teats:
nor does the bear at even growl around the fold, nor does the soil swell to its depth with deadly snakes.
More too we, happy, shall with wonder see :
how neither watery
Eurus sweeps the fields with torrent­ rain, nor are the rich and fertile seeds burnt up by sapless clods, for heaven's King checks each extreme.
No ship with Argo's crew came ever here;
nor here did a shameless Colchian plant her foot:
hither no Syrian traders bent their sail-yards, nor toiling rowers of Ulysses' fleet.
Here no infection harms the flock, no furious dog-star's rage scorches the cattle with its heat.
When Jupiter debased the Golden Age with brass, he set apart these coasts for men of pious race :
with brass and then with iron he made the Ages harder still, escape from which by this my oracle is to the pious given.
HORACE.
—Now, now I yield to your most potent skill, and as a suppliant beg you by realms of Proserpine and by Diana's deity that may not be provoked, and by the books of magic spells which from the sky can draw the stars and bring them down.
Canidia, spare, I pray, your mystic words, and loose, oh, loose the wheel and spin it quickly back!
Telephus to pity moved the great Achilles, 'gainst whom he had in pride arrayed the Mysian bands, and at whom he had discharged his whetted darts.
Manslaying Hector, doomed to birds and dogs of prey, Troy's matrons yet anointed, when Priam left the walls and flung himself at feet of dread Achilles, obstinate of will.
At Circe's beck the rowers of Ulysses, man of many toils, laid down the shapes of swine with bristles on their hardened skins.
Then sense and voice returned, and to their looks the wonted dignity of man.
I've paid you penalties enough and more,—you, by sailors and by pedlars beloved.
Youth and the blush of health have left my bones, now clad in livid skin:
my hair is whitened by your scented drugs:
no rest relieves me after toil:
night treads on day, and day on night, nor have I power by taking breath to ease my sore-strained lungs.
Then, to my grief, I'm forced to credit what I once denied, that Sabine spells ring through the heart, and that the head is split in twain by Marsian songs.
What wish you more ?
O sea, 0 earth!
I'm all on fire, more than was Hercules, with blood of Nessus smeared, aye more than flames of Sicily, in boiling Ætna, ever fresh and fierce.
You're always heated up, a very factory of magic drugs, till as dry ash I'm borne off upon the noxious winds.
What end of torment or what indemnity awaits me?
Speak out:
with honour I shall fully pay the penalty imposed, prepared to make amends whether you ask a hundred bulls, or rather wish the praise of a mendacious lute.
Of spotless chastity, of morals pure, you'll proudly move, a brilliant light among the stars.
Castor and the brother of Great Castor, though hurt in mind because of slandered Helen, being moved by prayer, returned the bard his eyesight lost.
And you, too, for you can, release me from this frenzied mind,—you who are not disgraced by parents' mean estate, and are not skilled in throwing ninth-day ashes upon the paupers' graves.
You have a kindly heart and hands un­ stained with blood;
....
You're a veritable mother;
Pactumeius is your son;
and with wondrous speed did you recover health and strength.
CANIDIA.
—Why do you pour your prayers on ears close- sealed ?
The winter's sea beats not with swelling surge on rocks more deaf to shipwrecked crews.
To think that with­ out penalty you should divulge and ridicule Cotyttian mysteries, the sacred orgy of unbridled love, and as High Priest of the Esquilian rites, should make the town re-echo with my name !
What profit did it bring to me to have enriched Pelignian hags, and to have mixed a speedier potion ?
But slower fates than those you wish await you ;
unwelcome life must be spun out by you in misery, with this intent, that to the end you may remain a fitting object for new toils.
Tantalus, father of the faithless Pelops, longs for rest;
Tantalus who ever wants the bounteous feast;
Prometheus, to the greedy bird exposed in bonds, desires it too;
Sisy­ phus for ever strives to place on mountain heights the heavy stone, but Jove's decrees forbid.
Sometimes you'll long to leap from lofty towers, some­ times to rend your breast with Noric sword ;
in vain you'll tie a noose around your throat, saddened by grief that loathes to live.
Then shall I ride on neck of foes, and to my haughty triumph Earth shall bow.
Shall I, who to the waxen forms give feeling, as you by prying know, and by my spells can tear the moon from heaven, can from their ashes raise the dead, and duly mix a draught of fond desire-shall I lament the issue of my art, all powerless 'gainst you alone ?
Of the several derivations which have been suggested for the term " Satira," the most feasible is that which refers it to the adjective Satur, and especially to its use in the phrase lanx satura, a dish filled with various first-fruits offered to the gods.
Hence, as applied to literary composition it meant afarrago or medley-a gossipy talk on men and matters.
It is supposed to have had its origin in the humours of the rude "
Harvest Home " of the Italian peasants, at which they indulged in off-hand jests and rough by-play, at the expense of their neighbours.
In course of time this rustic sport was displaced by a regular poem, with singing and dialogue, and so gradually developed into an After-Piece of a farcical kind, called Exodium, acted in later years, as a separate perform­ ance, after Tragedies.
The Romans claimed Satire as " all their own."
They had no Greek model to go by, and no Greek Satiric Poems to translate:
but there is no doubt that the earliest writers of Satire drew largely from the old Greek Comedy.
Didactic Satire is said to be due to Ennius.
Lucilius, how­ ever, improved upon Ennius so much in every way that he was called the "Inventor" of it.
There were four chief writers of Roman Satire—Lucilius and Horace, and their imitators, Juvenal and Persius, but it is with Horace only that we have to deal.
Horace was by nature and by choice a Satirist, and he possessed many qualities which fitted him eminently for that function.
He had a wide knowledge of human nature in its sober and also in its comic aspects:
he was shrewd and observant:
he was possessed of strong common sense, great penetration, clear discernment, and sound judgment.
He had a keen perception of the ludicrous and employed it most effectively to ridicule the weaknesses of his fellow men, as well as their faults and their follies.
He took broad and reasonable views of men and of things, and was free from crotchets and prejudices.
He saw even his own defects, and did not shrink from bringing some of them, at least, before his readers, through the mouth of his slave, Davus, in the seventh Satire of the second Book,-one of the most humorous and most amusing of the whole collection of these “ Sermones," or " Satirae.
"It has been already stated1 that after the defeat of the Republican Party at Philippi, Horace on his return to Rome supported himself by writing, for the booksellers, pieces of a Satirical kind, which unfortunately made him many enemies.
Following his great model, Lucilius, he began by being very severe on his victims.
But he soon had cause to feel that he had taken a false step, and he was wise enough to change his methods in time.
He became more genial and more humorous, and sketched men and their ways with a lighter touch.
His choice of Satiric Composition was a dangerous one for a man who had belonged to the defeated Party of Brutus and Cassius.
Horace could not afford to speak with severity of the leaders of the Imperialists;
and thus no political Satire is found in his writings.
Social and literary topics are his only subjects.
His Satiric powers were directed mainly against the eccentricities and the vices of his countrymen, and the corruptions of taste and of morals which crept in with the increase of wealth.
Avarice and money-grubbing, extrava­ gance of living, profligacy, ostentation, pride, superstition, witchcraft, legacy-hunting, and other phases of a degenerate Age, as seen in a great and wealthy city, came freely under his lash.
But his lash is not too cutting and too personal.
His Satires are placed on an ethical basis :
and he tries to convince his readers, not by invective against the objects of his censure, but rather by good-humoured raillery, and by the ridicule of things stupid and perverse.
Like his excellent and prudent father he points out the true path of duty to all by quoting examples of those who strayed from the right track and came to ruin.
His own gentle nature, together with motives of policy, inclined him strongly to adopt a moderate and even lenient tone in dealing with the blemishes and the vices of his fellow-men.
He is willing to look at things in the best light and in the most indulgent spirit- loath to wound, and willing to be pleased if possible.
None of the old Satirists were so genial and so measured in their words as he.
He was essentially kind-hearted and humane, and did not wish to wound the feelings or the pride of any living man.
In this he was much assisted by the simple method of not introducing the names of men known in Rome in his own day, and of adopting, instead, those already used by Lucilius.
He also coined a few names whose etymology might in some cases suggest the indi­ vidual at whom his shafts were aimed, such as Porcius, the "piggish feeder";
Philodemus the "People's Friend":
Pantolabus, the "Grab-all.
"In some of the so-called Satires there is no censure what­ ever.
The " Journey to Brundusium " indulges in no ridi­ cule, unless it be in regard to the fussy Praetor of Fundi, and the superstition of the simple people of Egnatia.
No. IX.
of Book I. is simply a jocular and cleverly told story of the poet's sufferings from the intrusion of an intolerable bore.
This, in the opinion of most readers, is the gem of the whole collection.
Again Satire VI. of Book II.
is a laudation of the quiet and happiness of a country life as contrasted with the rush and bustle and worries of a residence in Rome.
Hence the title of " Sermones " which Horace applies to the Epistles as well as the Satires is certainly a more appropriate one than Satires.
It is equal to "Dis­ courses," "Talk," "Prose Writings."The First Book of the " Sermones," or Satires, was given to the public about 3 5 B.C., and seems to have brought much undeserved odium on the poet.
He started badly with Satire II.
of Book I., which is very bitter in tone.
Many men for whom it was not intended fancied that they were aimed at.
They felt that the cap fitted, and they put it on, though the author had no intention of singling them out for reproof.
They, in turn, taunted him with his low origin as a freedman's son.
But this experience, as already said, did him much good, and led to his after success.
In Book I.
Horace speaks mainly in his own person, but in II.
he expresses his views through selected characters, such as Ulysses, Tiresias, Ofellus and others;
a device which gives more variety and more dramatic interest to the several Pieces.
For similar purposes he introduces fables, stories, and other illustrative matter, which rest the mind of the reader and relieve it from the strain of contemplat­ ing without interruption, the childish follies and the insane excesses of others :
and which at the same time give point and piquancy to the poet's criticisms.
Thus to illustrate his remarks on the respective merits of the city and the country, he relates the well known fable of the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse, with an elegance of ex­ pression and a choice of diction almost perfect.
Again, referring to his boyhood days, he pays a noble tribute to his good old father for the unwearying care he took to form his mind on right principles, and for the bold resolve he made with regard to his education.
Few things in ancient literature are more grand or more touching than this deserved acknowledgment by a grateful son to a far­ seeing and unselfish parent.
Book II., published probably about 30 B.C., shows more of the work of a master hand than Book I.
The judgment is more mature, the tone more vivacious;
the finish more perfect, and clearness of statement more apparent.
There is also an air of greater dignity, and an evident conscious­ ness of success, and of an assured position in literature.
The moralist will find in Horace, and especially in the " Sermones " a wondrous store of gems of practical wisdom and maxims for the guidance of conduct:
and the man of the world may fill his capacious note-book with telling quotations applicable to the affairs of everyday life in all its phases.
The works of Horace are a " possession for all time," and will remain in favour with thoughtful and good men through every age.
A distinguished critic thus wrote many years ago :
—“
The Satires of Horace contain more real good sense, sound morality, and true philosophy, than perhaps any single work of heathen antiquity."

Maecenas, how comes it, pray, that no one lives contented with the lot which sober reason chose, or chance presented, but each commends, instead, the men who follow other paths ?
0 lucky trader!
says the soldier, burdened with years and broken down in body by his many toils.
The trader, when the south winds toss his bark, exclaims, War's risks are better far.
For why ?
They close in battle-shock!
In one brief hour's space death quickly comes or joyous victory.
The man well-skilled in equity and statute law praises a country life, when, ere the cock has crowed, some client raps him, up.
Another, who has sureties given, when dragged from farm to town, declares that city men alone are blessed.
Cases like these, so many are they, would weary out long­ winded Fabius.
But, to be brief, just hear, I pray, to what a test I'll bring the thing.
If any god should say, lo—here!
At once I'll do1 whatever you wish:
you late a soldier shall a trader be:
you late a lawyer shall a farmer turn :
to this side you be gone, to that side you, and change your parts.
Quick !
Why stand you still ?
They wouldn't:
2 and yet they may be happy if they wish !
Why should not Jove in wrath blow out his cheeks at them, as they deserve, and plainly say that henceforth he will never be so weak as lend their prayers an ear ?
Besides, not to pass lightly on, as those who deal in jest-though what prevents a man to speak the truth in jest, as kindly teachers give their boys at times small pastry sweets that they may learn the Elements with willing mind ?-but yet, joking apart, let us with gravity the subject treat.
The man who with the sturdy plough upturns the heavy soil:
this cheating vintner, soldiers, and sailors too who boldly scud o'er every sea, confess they hardships bear with this intent, that in old age they may retire to ease secure, when they have gained enough for life's support:
just as the tiny ant of mighty toil-for she's their model- drags with her mouth whatever she can, and adds it to the heap she piles, not unaware and not unmindful of the time to come.
Who, soon as Aquarius veils with his clouds the year now turned, creeps nowhere forth, and wisely uses former gains.
But not so you, whom neither burning heat can from your greedy earning move, nor winter's cold, nor fire, nor sea, nor sword, nor aught in short withstands till no one else is richer than yourself.
What good is it to you, thief like, to dig the earth and hide in it great hoards of silver and of gold in trembling fear ?
But if you break on it, 'twould dwindle down, you say, aye, to a paltry as.
Still if you do not so, what beauty has a pile amassed ?
Your floor may thrash out corn in bushels, thou­ sands told, but yet1 your stomach will not hold a morsel more than mine;
just as if you bore a sack of bread upon your loaded back among the slaves, you would receive no more than he who carried none.
Or tell me, pray, in case of him who guides his life by Nature's bounds, what matter is it if he tills a thousand acres or five score ?
Ah!
but 'tis a pleasure in itself to draw from great supplies whatever you need!
While you consent that from my little heap I take as much as you from yours, why do you laud your granaries above my scanty store?
As if you need a pail of water only, or a glass, and were to say, Had I the choice, I'd rather take the same amount from some great stream than from this paltry well.
And so it comes to pass, that those who take delight in more than measure just, the rapid Aufidus still carries down, swept with the bank away.
But whoso wishes merely what his little needs require, he is not bound to draw the water mixed with mud, nor does he lose his life among the waves.
But the greater part of men, led by mistaken greed, declare that Nothing is enough, because the more you have the more you're prized."
What can you do with such a one?
Wish him joy that he is wretched, since he is so willingly:
as at Athens once a mean and wealthy man was wont to flout the people's talk—Men hiss me, but I applaud myself at home when in the chest my coins I see.
Tantalus strains for the water fleeing from his lips.
Why laugh ?
Just change the name and you're the man :
you sleep with stupid stare on bags of gold hoarded from any source, and yet must spare them as devoted things, or by your eye enjoy them as you do a painting!
Know you not what money's for, what purposes it serves ?
It serves to buy your bread, your cabbage and your pint of wine, and other things for want of which man's nature sorely grieves.
To lie awake half-dead with fear, to live in terror of those horrid thieves by night and day, of fires too, and of your slaves lest they rob you and run off-is that a pleasure?
In goods like these for my part I should like to be the poorest of the poor.
But if your body, caught by chill, begins to ache in every part, or if some other ailment keeps you to your bed, you have a loving one to sit beside you, prepare your fomentations, and beg the doctor to raise you up, and give you back restored in health to children and dear friends.
Your wife and son don't wish you well again;
your neighbours and acquaintances, and even the boys and girls in the streets, detest you.
Do you wonder then, since you give gold the foremost place, that no one shows affection which you do not earn ?
or that you lose your labour, wretched man,—as one who trains a donkey for the race,­ if you should wish to keep the love of kinsmen whom Nature gives without your help, and to retain the other friends1 you've made ?
In a word, set limits to your gains, and when you more have earned, fear poverty the less, and having reached the sum you sought, begin to cease from "toil and moil," lest that befall you which befell a man Ummidius—the story is not long-so rich that by a measure he would tell his gold, so mean that as a slave he dressed, and dreaded to his dying day that want of food would end him.
But him a female slave with axe-stroke cleft in twain-the bravest she of the Tyndarid blood.
What then do you advise?
That I should live as Maenius or as Nomentanus?
There you go, placing side by side two things as fiercely opposite as fighting bulls.
When I dissuade you from a misers life I do not ask you to become a sot or scamp.
There is a difference 'twixt Tanais and the father of Visel­ lius' wife.
There's a medium in all things :
in fine, there are due limits fixed, on this and that side which The Right cannot find place.
I now return to that from which I started-how comes it that no one, as the miser does,1 approves his own pursuits, but praises those who follow other paths, and pines through envy that another's goat should bear a heavier udder than does his, and fails to regard the throng of poorer men, but strives to pass first one and then another?
To one who hastens thus a richer man still bars the way, just as when the horses sweep from the post the started cars, the driver presses on steeds before his own, despising him,2 that he has passed, now going midst the ruck.
Hence is it that rarely do we find a man who says that he has spent a happy life, and satisfied with years gone by, from the world retires, like sated guest.
Enough.
I will not add another word, lest you should think I've robbed the bookcase of blear-eyed Crispinus.
The guilds of flutists, quacks and beggars, of clowns and parasites and all that class, are sore distressed that death has slain Tigellius the singer.
No doubt he was a generous soul.
But again, another, lest men should deem him prodigal of means, would never give a needy friend the wherewithal to drive away the pinching cold and hunger's crave.
If of a third you ask why with ungrateful maw he wastes ancestral wealth, buying all dainties with a borrowed fund, he answers that he scorns to be a man of mean and niggard mind.
By some he's praised, by others blamed.
Fufidius dreads the names of sot and scamp, rich as he is in land, rich in invested gold.
Sixty per cent.
he for his loan exacts, and the deeper sunk the debtor is, the harder does he press.
The names of youths who've just assumed the " manly gown," but still in rigid parents' care, he searches out.
Who, when he hears of this, does not exclaim, “Al­ mighty Jove, oh!
how is this ?
But, just as he gains, so on himself he spends.
You scarce can credit the extent to which he shows himself his greatest foe, so that the father, whom the Play of Terence paints as living wretched for his banished son, did not torment himself more cruelly than he.
If one should now enquire, What is the point of this, I'd thus reply, When fools shun faults, they run to opposite extremes.
With singers 'tis a common fault that they never are induced to sing, when asked, ’mongst friends-unasked, they never cease.
This was a way Tigellius had, who from Sardinia came.
Caesar, who could compel consent, would not prevail the least if for his father's sake or for his own he begged :
but if his fancy bade, from egg to apple of the feast he'd shout, 0 Bacchus, hail !
now in the deepest voice, then in that note which sounds the shrillest of the tetra­ chord.
That fellow never had a particle of ballast:
one time he'd run as if he fled a foe;
he'd often stalk as one who bore gieat Juno's sacred trays ;
he often kept two hundred slaves, and often ten ;
one time he'd talk of kings and tetrarchs as his dearest friends, and speak of all things big:
again he'd say, Give me a three-legged table and a shell to hold my salt and keep it clean, and a robe, however coarse, if it but serve to drive away the cold.
Though to this paragon of thrift, pleased with a little, you gave ten thousand pounds,1 within a week you would not find a copper in his chests.
Night upon night he'd lie awake till early dawn, then sleep and snore the livelong day.
Nothing on earth was ever so at variance with itself.
Some one now may say to me—What of yourself?
Have you no faults ?
Yea verily, of different kind-less in degree perhaps.
When Maenius was reviling 2 absent Novius, Hark you, says one, do you not know yourself, or do you think that, as unknown, you can impose on us ?
I for myself can find excuse, quoth Maenius.
Self-love like this is silly, and overweening, and worthy to be branded by the censor's mark.
When you with eyes inflamed and newly smeared inspect your “beams with purblind look, why do you scrutinise the “motes ” of friends, keen as an eagle or an Argive snake ?1 But, on the other hand, it you befalls that they in turn your sins and foibles closely scan.
Some friend is rather testy in his way, and little suited for the cutting banter of our modern wits.
He may provoke a smile because his hair's ill trimmed, his toga hangs awry, his shoes, by far too loose, scarce stick upon his feet.
But yet he is a worthy man—none better:
he's your friend, and under that exterior, rough as it is, a giant mind lies hid.
In fine, ransack your heart to find if Nature, long ago, or evil habit, has implanted in you any seeds of vice:
the fern, for nought but burning fit, grows in neglected fields.
Now let us first take heed to this, that dear ones' base defects are hid from blinded lovers, or even these impart delight, as Hagna's wen does to Balbinus.
I could wish that among friends we sinned like this, and that on errors such as these good sense had stamped an honourable name.
But as a father does not loathe a son's defects, so ought we not to loathe a friend's, if fault he has :
the father says his squinting son has got a " Venus cast of eye":
the boy who's very small, as dwarfish Sisyphus of old, he sur­ names " Little Chick ":
him with distorted legs he fondly names " his Varus";
11 his Scaurus " him whose weakly ankles scarce support his weight.
Say then a friend there is who lives with niggard stint-let him be " frugal " called.
Another shows a want of tact and is to boasting rather prone,-he wishes to appear to friends a witty man.
But if he's very gruff, and free beyond all bounds in speech, let him be deemed sincere and frank:
he is hot-headed-­ let him be ranked among the men of spirit.
This kind of thing, in my opinion, both links true friends and keeps them linked.
But even virtues we turn upside down, and wish to foul a vessel clean and sweet.
In our midst there lives a man, upright and unassuming in his ways,­ him we pronounce both dull and stupid.
Another shuns all snares, and to the ill-disposed ne'er shows an open flank, since 'tis our lot to live in times when bitter envy reigns and calumny is rife—him we dub hypocrite and cunning knave, and not, a man of good sound sense and prudent caution.
One is rather artless, such as I have often shown myself to you Mæcenas;
and ne'er had cause to rue it,1 so that-the bore—he’d worry with his random talk one reading, haply, or deeply sunk in silent thought;
of such we say, he plainly wants the social sense !2 Alas !
how rashly we approve a law that tells against ourselves.
No man is born without defects:
he is the best who is beset with least.
Let pleasant friends weigh, as they ought, my good points 'gainst the bad;
to the former which are most (if most indeed they are) let them incline, if they themselves wish to be loved.
On this condition they shall be weighed in the same balance as myself.
He who expects not to disgust his friend by wens will readily forgive the other's warts :
'tis only fair that he who seeks indulgence should give it in return.
In fine, since vice of temper, like other faults in fools innate, cannot be wholly rooted out, why does not Reason use true weights and measures of her own, and according to each case by penalties restrain offence ?
If any one should on the cross impale a slave, who bidden to remove a plate, should gobble up the fish-remains and half-cold sauce, would he not, 'mong men of sober mind, be deemed a madder fool than Labeo ?
How much a madder and more grievous fault is this !
A friend has made a little slip, which if you don't excuse you may be thought a churlish prig:
you hate him bitterly and avoid him as the debtor shuns stern Ruso, for when the doleful Kalends come, unless he muster up by hook or crook the interest or the debt, poor wretch, he's forced to hear as captive slave with neck exposed1 those dreary, weary 2 tales.
When tipsy he has soiled my bed, or from the table swept a dish well thumbed a by King Evander's hands, or when hungry pounced on a chicken, placed in front of me upon the dιμsh,4—on this account, I say, should he become less pleasant as a friend ?
What shall I do if he commits a theft, or confidence betrays, or bond disowns ?
Those who regard all faults as much alike, are in a strait when to the test of real life they come :
—man’s feelings and his practice reject the thought, and expediency itself, the parent as it were, of justice and of right.
When human kind, like animals, crawled forth upon the primal earth, a speechless and a grovelling herd, for acorns and for lairs they fought with nails and fists, and then with clubs, and later on with arms which need had forged, till they invented words and names by which to voice their sounds, and tell their thoughts:
thereafter they began to cease from war, to build their towns, and make their laws -that no one thieve or rob or take his neighbour's wife.
For long ere Grecian Helen lived, lust was a vilest cause of war, but those were carried off by deaths unknown, whom, seizing lawless love like beasts, the man of greater strength subdued, just as the bull does in the herd of kine.
We must confess that laws were made through fear of wrong, if you unroll the dates and records of the world.
Nor can Nature separate unjust from just, as she divides good from its opposite, things to be sought from those we ought to shun :
nor will Reason prove that he is guilty, in like man­ ner and degree, who breaks his neighbour's colewort, and he who steals by night the sacred vessels of the gods.
Let some fixed rule exist which shall assign fair punishments to faults, so that you do not mangle with the horrid scourge him who is only worthy of the " strap."
I have no fear that you will punish with the cane him who deserves a greater lash, since you declare that thefts and robberies are on a par, and threaten that with self-same knife you will cut down the great faults and the small, if men will let you have your way.
If he who is wise is rich, and good at cobbling too, and alone the handsome man, and king to boot, why do you wish for what you have?
You know not then what old Chrysippus says—
“The wise man never made his slippers or his shoes, but yet the wise man is a cobbler."
How so ?
Just as Hermogenes, though silent, is the best of singers, and composers too:
just as Alfenus, crafty wight, when he had shut his shop and cast away his tools, remained a barber still;
so the wise man is alone the best artificer in every trade, and so too is he king.
The tricky boys are pulling at your beard :
and if you fail to check them with your stick, you're hustled by a pressing crowd, and burst with rage, and howl,-of mighty kings the mightiest thou !
To cut it short:
—whilst you, a king, go to your farthing bath, and no one in your retinue is seen except Crispinus, silly fool, my friends will me forgive, if like a fool I err, and I, in turn, will gladly bear their faults, and in my privacy shall live a happier life than you, a fancied king!
Eupolis, Cratinus, Aristophanes, all poets true, and other fearless men, who made the older Comedy their own, re­ buked without restraint him who seemed worthy to be branded villain, thief, adulterer, or cut-throat, or otherwise of ill repute.
From these Lucilius wholly draws his springs, them he follows close, with nought but feet and metre changed:
witty he was, in penetration keen, but harsh withal in form of verse.
In this respect he was in fault that as a feat he'd frequently dash off two hundred lines an hour without an effort.
1
As he flowed on in muddy stream there was a something you could wish removed :
wordy he was, and loath to bear the strain of writing­ that is, of writing well,-as to amount, I heed it not.
But, lo !
Crispinus seeks a wager at the longest odds.
Take tablets, if you please, says he, and so shall I:
let place and time and umpires be arranged, and let us see which of us two shall write the most.
The gods did well in that they made me of a barren and a timid mind, which seldom speaks and little says:
but you, as you prefer it so, be like the air that is in goatskin bellows pent, until the fire makes soft the iron.
Fannius is happy, when at his own desire, his bust and case of books are carried down the town;
2 while no one reads my writings since I fear in public to recite, as there are those who care not for satiric verse, because the greater part of men are open to its lash.
Take any one at random from a crowd-he suffers, be't from avarice or other wretched aim.
One dotes on matrons, one on youths :
the sheen of silver dazzles one :
by works of art is Albius crazed :
one barters wares from east to west, all o'er the world :
nay, he is hurried on through risks as dust by whirlwind swept, in fear that any of his hoard be lost, or that he fail to swell his gains.
All such fear verses, and detest the makers.
A wisp of hay is on his horn, they say-keep far aloof:
if for himself he only gains a laugh he will not spare a single friend, and what he once has scribbled on his sheets he'll take delight that all who come from bakery or bath shall know, both boys and aged crones.
Come then, a little in reply receive:
and first of all I will exclude myself from list of those to whom I'd give the name of poet.
'Tis not enough, you'd say, to make a verse with feet and metre right;
nor if one wrote, as I, what's nearer prose than verse, would you allow that he's a poet true.
To that man would you give the honoured name, who shows the fire of genius, a soul that's nearer heaven's mould, and a mouth that will with dignity give forth both great and noble thoughts.
On this account it is that some have asked if Comedy be prose or verse;
because the vivid glow and force are felt neither in diction nor in thought.
'Tis merely prose save that it differs in stated metre and in feet.
But an excited father towers with rage because his vicious son, madly fond of harlot friend, declines a wife with noble dower, and drunken walks about with torches ere the night falls down-a great disgrace indeed.
Would Pomponius, if his father lived, hear lighter words than these?
'Tis not enough then to complete a verse with plain and simple words, which disarrange, and then another may express his wrath just as the father in the play.
If from the verses which I write, and those Lucilius wrote of old, you take away fixed quantities and rhythm, and put behind what was before, and what was last make first, you would not find the limbs of the dismembered bard, as you would in this even if you broke it up—So much for this:
another time I shall enquire if Satire is a poem, strictly called;
but now this only will I ask if it deserves, or not, suspicion in your eyes.
Keen-scented Sulcius walks about, and Caprius with evil croak, and with their notes, each a great dread to robbers ;
but whoso lives an honest life, with hands unstained, may bid defiance to them both.
Suppose you're like the robbers Cælius and Birrius, I need not be a Caprius or a Sulcius :
why do you fear me ?
Let neither shop nor stall 2 possess my little books on which Tigellius and the common herd may lay their clammy hands.
Nor do I read aloud to any but to friends, and that when forced,-not everywhere, nor yet to every one.
Many there are who read aloud in middle of the Forum, and many in the baths:
a place enclosed gives pleasing echo to the voice.
This flatters empty heads, which never ask themselves if they do this without a sense of fitness, or at an adverse time.
You love to wound, quoth one, and this you do with right good will, crank as you are.
Where got you this, which in my face you fling ?
In fine, have you authority for this from any one with whom I ever lived ?
He who maligns an absent friend:
who fails to take his part when others blame:
who courts the silly laugh of men, and would be called a “wit”;
who speaks of things, as seen, he never saw;
who cannot secrets keep;
that's a black-hearted wretch :
you, Roman true, beware him !
On the triclinium you oft may see the guests arranged in fours, of whom there's always one who takes delight to besmirch with foul abuse all but the man who heads the feast:
1 and him as well when, later on, he's drunk, when truthful Bacchus tells aloud the secrets of the heart.
To you who malice 2 hate, he courtly seems, polite, and frank.
Do I appear to you a spiteful and a snarling man, if I have laughed because Rufillus, silly fool, of comfits smells, Gorgonius of the goat ?
If in your presence any word be said of Petillius and his thefts from Jove upon the Capitol, you'd thus defend him as you're wont:
11 He of the Capitol has treated me as guest and friend even from my boyhood days, and many things has done for me, at my request;
and I'm very glad he's now allowed to live at Rome, free from arrest;
but yet I wonder how from that charge he managed to escape."
This is the essence of the blackest bile, this is envy, pure and simple:
a fault which from my books, and first from my mind, I promise you, shall far be distant, if for myself I anything can truly vouch.
If aught I shall have said with too much freedom, too broad mirth, you will grant the right, and pardon too.
My worthy father taught me this, in branding, by examples given, the vices one by one, that I might shun them.
When urging me to live with thrift and care, and satisfied with that which he himself had made for me, (he'd say), " Do you not see how wretchedly the son of Albius lives, and what a beggar Baius is ?
A weighty lesson this, that none should wish to waste his fathers means."
When he wished to keep me free from harlots' baser love—“ Don't you be like Scetanus."
When he begged me no adultery to seek, when I might live in wedlock chaste, he used to say, " 'Tis not a pretty name Trebonius got, caught in the act.
Philosophers will reason give to prove what's best to seek, what to avoid:
for me it is enough if I preserve the morals by our fathers taught, and keep your life and name unstained, while still you need a guide.
So soon as time has seasoned well your body and your mind, you then will swim without the aid of cork."
Thus with his words he used to shape my boyish heart:
and whether he advised me to do a thing he'd say—“ you have authority for doing this " :
-then he'd hold up to me one of the special Judges :
or if he dissuaded me, "Can you doubt that it is contrary to honour and advantage so to do, when this and the other one have honour blighted by some vile report?"
A neighbour's funeral alarms the sick who lack control in food and drink, and forces them by fear of death to stint themselves:
so the disgrace of others oft withholds the young from crime.
In consequence of this,1 saved from those sins which certain ruin bring, I am possessed by faults, moderate in kind and in degree, and such as you can well forgive;
and even these, it may be, lapse of time, a candid friend, and calm reflection, may have lessened much;
for when the lounging couch or portico receives me, I do not fail in duty to myself:
I say, " This is a better plan;
by doing this I shall lead a better and a happier life :
by this means I shall meet my friends agreeably:
that was not pretty which a certain person did:
shall I, some day, in thoughtless moment, do the like ? "
These things I ponder with myself in silence:
when any leisure's left, I amuse myself by writing.
This is one of those my minor sins:
to which if you’d refuse your grace, the poets in large force would come to help me (for we are by far more numerous), and like the Jews we should compel you to come along and join our set.
When I had started on my way from mighty Rome, Aricia gave me welcome in a humble inn;
Heliodorus, for rhetoric renowned, went with me, than all the Greeks more learned by far.
Next halt was Appii Forum, with sailors and with cheating vintners filled.
This stage we took as two, in easy mood, though only one to travellers in greater haste.
1 The Appian Way is less severe on those who go more slowly.
The water here was of the very worst, and so I open war proclaim against my stomach, waiting with no easy mind until my fellow guests had supped.
And now pale Night prepared to draw her veil o'er Earth, and spangle heaven with stars.
And then the slaves began to " chaff" the boatmen, and the boatmen chaffed the slaves.
"Shove her in here!"
"You're putting hundreds in :
oh, that's enough."
Whilst fares are paid and mules are yoked an hour at least is spent.
The vile mosquitoes and the filthy 2 frogs warn sleep away, while the boatman, drenched with vapid wine, and eke a passenger sing loud in rival praise of absent loves.
At length the wearied passenger drops off to sleep, and the lazy boatman ties to a stone the halter of the mule set free to graze, and laid on his back he snores amain.
And now the dawn was near, when we perceive the boat's not making way, till one in passion leaps ashore, and with a willow sapling beats the head and loins of boatman and of mule.
At length with much ado we get ashore when three good hours had gone,1 and in your limpid stream, Feronia, we lave both hands and face.
Then having lunched we crawl along three dreary miles and come to Anxur built upon rocks that show from far.
Maecenas was to meet us here, and good Cocceius, worthiest of men, both sent as deputies on high affairs of State, used as they were to bring together friends estranged.
As for myself, I here was forced to touch my eyes with black and cooling salve.
Meantime Mæcenas comes, Cocceius too, and Fonteius Capito, a polished gentleman, and Antony's most steadfast friend.
Fundi we leave without a pang, Aufidius Luscus being its proctor then, amused at the badges of the silly clerk 2 -the purple robe, the laticlave, and censer with its coal.
Wearied we stop and rest in famed Mamurra's town Murena's guests for room, and Capito's for food.
The next day dawns, most welcome of them all, for at Sinuessa we are joined by Plotius, Varius and Virgil—souls purer than whom earth ne'er produced, nor ones to which can any man be more attached than I.
Oh, what embraces, and what joy there was!
Nought with a pleasant friend could I compare, so long as sense is left me.
The hamlet nearest the Campanian bridge afforded shelter,-the purveyors sent us wood and salt, as they are bound to do.
Starting thence the mules lay down their packs at Capua, quite up to time.
Maecenas goes to play at ball, Virgil and I to sleep, for a game at ball is hurtful to the bleared, and the dyspeptic.
Then next Cocceius' well-stocked-house, beyond the inns of Caudium, receives us.
And now, 0 Muse, I wish you briefly to record the contest of buffoon Sarmentus with Messius Cicirrhus, and from what father sprung each joined in fight.
The Osci are the noble sires of Messius:
she who owned Sarmentus as her slave is still alive.
Of such dis­ tinguished lineage come, to battle they went forth.
And first Sarmentus says :
11 I do declare, you're like a unicorn."
We laugh, and Messius replies, " Well, be it so,” and moves his head.
1 " But had your forehead not its horn cut out," says he, " what would you do, when even now all reft of horn you threaten so ? "
For, you must know, that on the left an ugly hole had marred the aspect of his shaggy brow.
When he had quizzed him much on his Campanian plague 2 and on his face, he begged that he would dance the Shepherd Cyclops—“ no need he'd have for mask or tragic boot.
"To taunts like these Cicirrhus many hits returned :
he begged to ask if to the Lares he had yet his chain given o'er, as he had vowed :
because he was a lawyer's clerk, his owner's claim was none the less.
He asked, in fine, why he had run away for whom one pound 3 of corn sufficed, so slender was he and so tiny formed.
This supper we protract, with pleasure, longer than our wont.
From this we go right on to Beneventum ;
and there the bustling host had almost burned his house whilst on the coaly hearth he turns the thrushes small and lean ;
for, as the Fire-god stalks abroad throughout the kitchen, old and frail, the flame was hastening on to catch the roof.
Then you could see the hungry guests, and slaves in fright, rescue the supper, and all eager in haste to quench the fire.
Then next1 my own Apulia begins to show the hills I knew so well, scorched by the dry Sirocco's blast, which we should ne'er have climbed had not the villa near Trivicum given as shelter, not without smoke that drew forth tears, for the stove consumed green branches and their leaves.
From this we bowl along in carriages for four and twenty miles, meaning at a little town to spend the night, whose name my verse will not admit:
by certain marks it's easy known 2 :
here water is for sale, of all things cheapest:
the bread is very fine, so that the knowing ones convey it farther on in shoulder loads, for at Canusium it's gritty, nor is the town more rich in water, by a single urn3:
this place was built in olden times by Diomede the brave.
Here Varius with sorrow parts from sorrowing friends.
Thereafter we reach Rubi, weary and worn as traversing a road, long in itself and made more rough and rutty by the rain.
Next day brought clearer skies :
the road was worse even to the walls of Barium, that town of fish.
And then Egnatia, built when the water-nymphs were wroth, affords us scope for jokes and mirth, as they would have us think that incense on the sacred threshold melts without the aid of fire.
The Jew Apella may believe such stuff-not I;
for I have learned that gods enjoy untroubled life, and if Nature aught of wonder brings to pass, they do not, with ill will to men, despatch it straight from heaven's lofty dome.
Brundusium brings our journey, and my story, to an end.
Mæcenas, although there's none more nobly born than you, of all the Lydian race who ever dwelt in Tuscan bounds, or because your ancient sires by father's and by mother's side commanded mighty hosts,1 you don't despise on that account, as many do, those lowly born, like me myself, from freedman father sprung.
When you declare it matters not what parentage one has, provided he's himself freeborn, you're clear on this, that long ere Tullius rose to power and held plebeian sway, it often chanced that many lived in good repute, and were advanced to highest place, though come of sires obscure:
but that Lævinus, of Valerius' seed, by whom Proud Tarquin was to exile driven, was ne'er esteemed at higher value than an as, the people, whom you know, being judge, who oft, to the worthless office give and, of wit devoid, bow down to names;
who stand agape at pedigrees and busts.
Then what ought we2 to do, far and away removed from feelings of the crowd ?
For grant it that the people choose their honours on Lævinus to bestow rather than on a Decius, a self-made man, and that a censor Appius would from the Senate's lists erase my name, were I not come of freeborn sires, and justly too, because I had not been content with my own proper skin.
3
But Glory drags along, bound to her gilded car, not less the men of noble than of meaner birth.
Of what advantage is't to you, 0 Tillius, to resume the robe any knight or senator would have his children taught.
Those who saw my dress and slaves behind me, as in a great community was fit, would think that the expense was drawn from means inherited of old.
He attended me him­ self to all my teachers, a guardian above distrust.
But why enlarge?
He kept me pure, and this is virtue's highest praise, not only from a taint of sin, but from all scandal too.
Nor did he fear that any one in days to come should lay it to his charge if, as an auctioneer, or as Collector like himself, I followed humble walks.
Nor should I have complained the least:
but, as it is, the greater praise is due to him, the greater thanks from me.
While sense and reason last I cannot feel ashamed of father such as this, and so I'll not defend myself as many do, who say they're not to blame because their sires were neither high born nor renowned.
My words and feelings differ far from that:
for if Nature gave us leave to live our lives again from any date, and any other parents choose, each might elect to please his pride, I, quite content with mine, would ne'er consent to take those dignified by fasces and by curule chairs,-a fool may be, in judgment of the mob, but wise, perhaps, in yours,-because I should be loath to bear an irksome load to which I ne'er was used.
For forthwith I must greater means provide, must larger levees hold, take out with me a friend or two, so that I could never move alone to country or abroad.
More grooms and horses must be kept, more four horse chariots led in train.
Now I can go, even to Tarentum if I wish, upon my little mule, whose ribs the saddle bags may gall, the rider stress his front.
No man can taunt me with the meanness they ascribe to you, 0 Tillius, when on the road to Tibur five slaves attend you with commode and cellarette.
In this and thousand other ways I live more comfortably than you, 0 noble Senator!
Where'er my fancy bids I walk alone :
I ask the price of cabbage and of corn :
I often saunter through the Circus, haunt of cheats, and through the Forum, in the evening hours :
I stand to hear Diviners' tales:
then I betake me home to sup on omelette with leeks and pulse:
three slaves wait on me at my meal:
a marble slab supports two beakers and a glass:
close by there stands an urchin-bowl, a saucer and a cruet, both of Campanian ware.
Then after that I go to sleep, not in a fret that I must rise betimes to visit 1 Marsyas, who says he cannot bear the sight of younger Novius.
I lie abed2 till ten o'clock 8:
then after that I stroll abroad, or having read or written4 to beguile my quiet hours, I rub myself with oil, not of the kind which filthy Natta takes, cheating the lamps.
But when the hotter sun has warned me, tired as I am, to go and bathe, I shun the Campus and the game of ball.
Having lunched, not heartily, but eating just as much as that I go not fasting all the day, I stay at home and take my ease.
Such is the life of those free from the " pains and burden of ambition ":
I console myself that by these means I'll live a happier life than if I'd had both father, uncle, and grandsire upon the Quaestor's Seat.
5To all the eyesore and the barber class 'tis known, I think, how mongrel Persius took revenge for gall and venom of Rupilius, "that outlawed King."
This Persius was rich, and at Clazomenae he drove a thriving trade:
he also had with King a tedious plea;
a stubborn man he was, and one who in his hate could King surpass ;
audacious and bluster­ ing and in speech so cutting that " far and away ” 1 he could outstrip all the Sisennae and the Barri in abuse.
Now I come to King.
When no agreement can be made (for all, 'twixt whom an open war occurs, are bitter and un­ yielding in proportion as they're brave :
with Hector, Priam's son, and Achilles of resentment fierce, the strife was mortal, so that nought else but death could part the two-for this and only this that highest valour dwelt in both.
If a dispute arise between two cowards, or if open war break forth, in case of those ill-matched, as Diomede and Lycian Glaucus, the weaker leaves the field and proffers gifts)—well, when Brutus as Prætor fertile Asia ruled, the fight takes place between Rupilius and Persius, a pair as fairly matched as Bacchius with Bithus.
Both rush into Court, keen for the strife, and both a sight to see.
Persius explains the case :
a laugh is raised by all in Court:
he praises Brutus and he lauds his Staff:
Brutus he calls the Sun of Asia, and his retinue, all healthful stars, excepting King :
that Dog, he said had come, a constellation which the farmers hate.
He still rushed on like winter stream, where woodman's axe but rarely comes.
Then upon him of cutting wit, and glib of tongue, the Prænestine hurls his taunts, from language of the vineyard drawn, a sturdy pruner of the vine whom none could beat at slang, to whom the passer-by had often given in, while calling in his loudest voice, " Cuckoo.
"When with Italian vinegar he has been drenched from top to toe, the Grecian Persius exclaims, 0 Brutus, since 'tis your wont to make away with kings, by the great Gods I pray, why don't you rid us of this King of ours ?
This, believe me, is a duty truly yours.
Once I was a fig-tree stem, a good-for-nothing log, when the craftsman, doubting if he'd make me a Priapus or a bench, at last resolved that I should be a god.
And so a god I am, the greatest dread of thieves and birds :
for them my hand restrains, and the red-painted pole which from my waist projects :
besides, a twig fixed on my head alarms the greedy birds, and dares them to settle in the new-made grounds.
Hither in former days dead bodies of the slaves, flung out from narrow cells, were borne for burial on wretched biers, contracted for by fellow-slaves.
This was the usual 1 sepulchre for poorest plebs, for the buffoon Pantolabus and spendthrift Nomentanus.
A pillar here assigned a thousand feet in front, in depth three hundred, and noted that the sepulchre should never pass to heirs.
Now we can live on Esquiline, a healthy spot, and walk at large upon the sunny slope, which lately made us sad to see all foul with bleaching bones.
But yet to me the thieves and beasts of prey which wont to haunt the place are not so much concern and pain as are the hags which rack men's minds by verses and by drugs.
These I'm unable to destroy by any means, or even stop, soon as the wandering moon has shown to view her beauteous face, from gathering bones and noxious herbs.
With my own eyes I've seen Canidia, her dingy robe tucked up, walking about with naked feet and hair in disarray, and howling with the elder Sagana.
A deadly pallor made them both most hideous to behold.
Then they began with their own nails to dig a hollow in the earth, and with their teeth to tear in bits a black ewe-lamb.
The blood was poured by both of them into the trench that thence 1 they might evoke the Manes, spirits that would answer give.
An image, too, there was of wool, and a second made of wax :
the one of wool was larger, that it might by punishment control the small:
the waxen one as suppliant stood, soon like a slave to die.
One Hecate invokes, the other dread Tisiphone:
then serpents you could see and hellhounds roving near, and the blushing moon hiding behind huge tombs, that to such horrid rites she might not witness be.
But why give all details ?
how the Shades, when answer­ ing Sagana spoke in a mournful squeak, and how the hags hid stealthily in earth the beard of wolf and teeth of spotted snake, and how the fire burned greater from the wax;
how I, a witness, not un'venged, was terrified by those two Furies' words and deeds :
for I made a sound, loud as bladder burst by sudden blow :
but to the city off they fled:
with hearty laughter and with mirth you then could see Canidia's teeth and Sagana's false hair drop down;
and herbs and enchanted love knots fall from their hands and arms.
One day it chanced I took a stroll along the Sacred Way, as is my wont, conning o'er some trifling ode, and all ab­ sorbed in that.
A man runs up to me, unknown to me except by name, and seizing my hand he says, " How are you, dearest friend in all the world ? " 11 Pretty well, just now," I say, "and always at your service." 1
When he kept following me, before he could begin, I said " I can't do more for you,2 now can I ?
"But he replies "You surely know me,3 I'm a literary man.""
On that account," I say, " you will be more esteemed by me."
Painfully eager to get off, I sometimes walked more quickly:
again, I stopped, and whispered something to my slave, while to my very ankle-bones the sweat flowed down.
" 0 Bolanus, happy in thy testy brain," I muttered inwardly :
while he still chattered on of anything and every­ thing, and praised the city and its streets.
When I made no reply he says, " You're very anxious to be off, I've seen that long ago ;
but it's no use :
I'll stick to you right on:
wherever you are going now I will attend you."11 There's no necessity at all for you to go the rounds with me :
I wish to see a friend not known to you:
he's ill in bed a long way 'cross the Tiber, close to Caesar's gardens." " I've nought to do, and I am nowise lazy :
I'll follow you even there.
"I droop my ears, like an impatient ass when on his back he feels too great a load.
Then he begins "
If I don't overrate myself, you will not value Viscus more, or Varius, as friends :
for who can write more verses, or with greater speed than I ?
What man can move his limbs more gracefully ?
I sing so well as even to move Hermogenes to envy.
"Here was an opportunity of interrupting him :
"
Have you a mother, have you friends who wish you well ? ”" I haven't one:
I've laid them all to rest.""
Happy they !
now I am left;
despatch me too :
for a sad fate awaits me, which an old Sabellian hag with shake of her divining urn, foretold me in boyhood:
him nor poison dread, nor sword of foe will carry off, nor pleurisy, nor cough, nor crippling gout:
some day a chatterbox will be his death :
if he be wise let him eschew all such, when he's grown up.
"We now had come to Vesta's shrine, a quarter of the day being gone, and as it chanced, he was obliged just then to answer to a bail1;
and if he failed appearance, he was bound to lose his suit.
"As you love me," says he, "come here a little.""
May I die if I can stand 2 in Court, or if I know the civil law :
and I am hurrying on to where you know.""
I'm doubtful what to do," says he, " whether to leave the suit or you.""
Me I beseech you."" I won't," he says, and on he goes.
I follow, as it's hard to fight against your victor.
-Here­ upon he starts afresh."
How does Maecenas stand with you ? ”" He is a man of few friends, and of very sound judgment."
1" No one has turned his luck to better account than you.
You would have a powerful helper to back you up if you cared to introduce me to him :
may I die if you wouldn't supplant them all."11 We don't live there as you suppose;
no house is purer nor more a stranger to such evil ways.
It's no drawback to me, I say, if one is richer or more learn'd :
each one has his proper place.""
What you state is very strange-scarce credible, indeed.""
And yet it's quite the case.
"
“You fire my soul so that I'm still more eager to be his nearest friend.""
You've but to wish it:
such is your merit, you will take him by storm:
and he is one who can be captured and therefore he guards his outworks well."
3" I shall not fail in duty to myself :
I'll bribe his slaves :
If I'm denied to-day, I'll not give up:
I'll seek for fitting times :
I'll meet him in the street, and see him home.
To mortals life has given nought without great toil"While he is thus going on Aristius Fuscus meets us, a friend of mine, and one who knew him well:
we stop. “
Whence come you ?
and where for ? " he asks and answers.
I began to pluck his toga, and with my hand to pinch his most impassive arms, nodding, turning my eyes from side to side, that he would relieve me.
Smiling with malicious fun he pretended not to take me up :
anger set my liver all ablaze."
You surely said you wished to talk with me of something quite in private.""
I remember well, but I'll tell you at some fitter time:
To-day's a thirtieth Sabbath :
would you have me to insult the circumcised Jews ? "" No superstition, I reply, affects my conscience there!""
But it does me :
I am a little weaker in the mind:
one of the many:
you'll forgive me;
I'll talk to you some other time.
"Oh!
that this day has dawned so black to me!
The rogue makes off and leaves me to the knife.
As it chanced the plaintiff meets him;
and in loud voice exclaims :
—
"Where are you off to, basest fellow?" and to me he says, "Will you be witness?" I readily present my ear.
He hurries him to court:
there's shouting on both sides and a rush from every point.
Thanks to Apollo, I got off.
No doubt I said Lucilius' lines run on in halting rhythm.
And who so stupidly admires Lucilius as not to say so too ?
But in the self-same piece he's praised because he gave the city many a rub with pungent wit.
And yet though this I grant I would not grant all else:
for then I should admire Laberius' mimes as works of high poetic art.
And thus, you see, 'tis not enough to cause an audience to laugh with open mouth;
though that has its merit too :
there's need of brevity, so that the stream of thought may flow on clear and free, and may not mar its course by words that load and tire the ear:
we want a style, now grave, yet oft­ times gay, that plays the part of orator and poet now, and now of polished wit who spares his strength and " draws it fine " on purpose.
In great affairs the comic often cuts the knot with edge more bold and keen than the severe.
Those sturdy men, who made Old Comedy their forte, on this their footing gained-in this our imitation claim :
whom Hermo­ genes, the fop, ne'er reads, nor yet that ape who nought can sing but Calvus and Catullus.
But yet he did a wondrous feat in that he mixed up Greek with Latin words.
0 laggard wits, who think—is’t really so ?-that that is hard and strange which fell to Pitholeon, him of Rhodes, to do.
But verses happily made up of Greek and Latin words are sweeter to the taste, you say, e'en as if a cask of strong Falernian brand were mixed with wine of Chian growth.
Is it only then, I put it to yourself, when you your verses write, or also when you're called to plead the thorny cause of some accused Petilius ?
When Pedius Publicola and Corvinus with toilsome effort urge their pleas in Latin tongue, would you, forsooth, forgetting fatherland and father, prefer to interlard your native speech with foreign words like double- tongued Canusian ?
And so when I essayed Greek verselets to compose, born as I was this side the sea, Quirinus in vision seen past midnight, when all dreams are true, forbade me thus:
“’Twould not be more insane for you to carry timber to the woods than if you wished to swell the crowded bands of Grecian bards."
When Alpinus in his turgid style “murders” the hero Memnon and “gives his Rhine a headpiece of brown mud," I amuse myself with trifles such as these, not that they may echo in the temple, competing for a prize, with Tarpa as the judge, nor to the stage return to be again and yet again reviewed.
Fundanius, you alone of living men are able to compose with courtly grace in pleasing style, " light chatty plays of easy talk," how Davus and a cunning wench deceive an aged Chremes:
Pollio sings the deeds of kings in trimeter iambics :
Varius " with a vigour none can reach " the manly Epic moulds :
the Muses who the country love have given to Virgil smoothness and elegance of verse.
Satire like this it was which, tried in vain by Varro, on the Atax born, and others too, I yet could write better than they, though not to match the inventor:
nor should I dare to tear away the wreath which with great glory to his head adheres.
But I alleged that he flows on in turbid vein, oft bearing in his stream more to be removed than left:
come now, pray tell me, are you not learned enough to find a fault in mighty Homer ?
Does Lucilius, gracious as he is, suggest no change on Tragic Accius ?
Does he not deride old Ennius' lines as wanting dignity, though speaking of himself not as a greater man than those he blames.
And as I read Lucilius' words why should I not enquire if natural defect, or hard­ ness of the theme denied him verses better formed or flowing on more smoothly, than if a man content with this alone, to finish something in six feet, should strive to write two hundred verses ere he supped, as many when he'd done;
such was the talent of Cassius the Etruscan, more surging than a torrent stream, who on his funeral pyre, as fame records, by his own books and book-case was consumed.
Be it allowed, I say, that Lucilius was in manner gracious and in wit refined;
that he was more polished than one could hope for in the creator of this new kind of poetry, untouched by the Greeks, and than the great mass of older poets:
still had he been reserved by fate for this our age, he would now erase much that he wrote, would prune off all that was spun out beyond what made a finished line, and as he wrote would often scratch his head and to the very quick would bite his nails.
If you're to write what's worthy to be read a second time, oft turn your stylus, and pleased with readers, few and choice, do not be anxious that the mob should praise you.
Would you, like a fool, prefer your poems to be read aloud in common schools ?
Not I:
for me it is enough if Knights applaud, as, in contempt of all besides, the bold Arbuscula declared, when forced by hisses from the stage.
Should that bug Pantilius stir my wrath, or should it worry me that Demetrius should revile me when my back is turned, or if the silly Fannius, messmate of Hermogenes Tigellius, assail me.
Let Plotius and Varius, Mæcenas and Virgil, Valgius and Octavius, and Fuscus, best of men, approve my works, and both the Visci too.
Mere love to please being far removed, you, Pollio, I may name, and you, Messala, and your brother, and likewise you, Bibulus and Servius, and you along with these, good honest Furnius ;
and many more, whom, learned men, and friends.
I wittingly omit;
with whom I hope my verses, whatever their worth may be, shall favour find, since I shall sorely grieve if they afford less pleasure than I hope.
Demetrius, and you, Tigellius, I bid go whine among your female pupils' chairs.
Go boy,1 and to my booklet quickly add these lines.
HORATIUS.
Some think my satires too severe, and say I strain the work beyond due bounds;
another set allege that what I write is pithless, and that a thousand lines like mine could in a single day be spun.
Trebatius, advise me what to do.
TREBATIUS.
Stop.HOR.
Not write at all, you say ?
TREE.
Exactly, so I say.
HOR.
May I die, if it wouldn't be the better plan :
but I cannot sleep.
TREB.
Let those who need deep sleep anoint with oil, and swim the Tiber thrice, and towards night soak well their frame with draughts of good strong wine;
or if such a craze for writing seize you, be bold and celebrate the deeds of matchless Cæsar, and you will gain a meet reward for all your toil.
HOR.
Good sir, that's what I long to do :
but the power fails me:
it is not everyone who can depict the squadrons bristling with darts, or Gauls expiring with the broken lance, or wounds of Parthian falling from his horse.
TREB.
But yet you might describe him just and brave, as Lucilius was wise enough to speak of Scipio.
HOR.
I shall not fail, when circumstances prompt:
unless at fitting time the words of Flaccus will not gain the ear of Cæsar, who, if you unwisely pat him, kicks out at once, guarded on every side (like wary steed).
TREE.
Much better this than to attack in bitter verse Pantolabus, the clown, and roue Nomentanus, when each, though unassailed, fears for himself and hates you.
HOR.
What am I to do ?
Milonius dances, soon as excite­ ment stirs his wine-touched head, and lamps seem double.
Castor in horses takes delight:
he from the same egg hatched in boxing joys;
so many as the men who live, so many their pursuits :
my hobby is to range my words in feet, as old Luci­ lius did-a better man than you or I.
In ancient days he would entrust his secrets to his books, as faithful friends, and whether things went well with him or ill, to none besides had he recourse;
and so the life of him of olden days is clear displayed to view, as if on votive tablet drawn.
Him I follow, doubtful if I be Lucanian or Apulian :
for Venusia's hinds till fields on border line, for this one purpose sent, when the Sabelli were deforced, as the old story is, that through the empty space no enemy might raid the Roman lands, should the Apulian or the wild Lucanian a sudden inroad make.
But this good pen of mine shall never, if I'm not provoked, attack a living man, and will be my defence, as sword in scabbard hid;
and why from hostile brigands safe should I attempt to draw it forth ?
0 Father and Sovereign Jove, let my blade be laid aside and utterly consumed by rust, and let no one harm me, eager for peace.
But he who rouses me (Hands off I cry) shall rue it, and be lampooned till he's well known o'er all the town.
Cervius, when in wrath, holds out as threats the laws and urn;
Canidia, the poison of Albucius to those she hates;
Turius a great calamity, if you have any case when he is judge.
To this conclusion come with me that each one scares his foes by means in which he's strong, and that almighty Nature so directs :
the wolf his tooth, the bull his horn employs:
how's this unless by instinct shown ?
To spendthrift Scaeva trust his long-lived mother;
his dutiful right hand will do no crime :
strange, is it not, how neither with his heels does wolf attack, nor with his teeth the ox!
but the deadly hemlock in the honeyed mead will take away the crone.
Not to be tedious-whether calm old age awaits me or Death is hovering round with dismal wings-whether rich or poor, at Rome, or, if chance so order, an exile-what­ ever the complexion of my life may be, write I will and must.
TREB.
My son, I fear your life will not be long;
and I dread lest some of your greater friends may smite you with a chilling blight.
HOR.
How so ?
When Lucilius, as inventor, dared to write in strains like this, and to tear off the skin in which each forth in public walked, fair to the view, but foul within, was Lælius, or he who gained an honoured name from fall of Carthage, hurt by his wit, or were they sorry that Metellus was attacked or Lupus overwhelmed by his lampoons?
Yet he arraigned the people's chiefs, the people, too, in all their tribes, to nought but virtue kind and virtue's friends.
But when the valiant Scipio and wise and gentle Laelius from the throng and show of public life withdrew, they were wont to 11 fool" with him and playfully disport in free and easy mood until the cabbage boiled.
Whatever I am, though 'neath Lucilius both in rank and wit, yet this much envy will allow, unwilling though she be, that I have lived in converse with the great, and trying to imprint her tooth in matter soft and frail, she'll bring it sharply down on something hard and firm;
unless, 0 learned Trebatius, you disagree in any point.
TREE.
Indeed, I can't gainsay your words, but yet be warned and carefully beware lest ignorance of our sacred laws may plunge you into trouble:
if one has made bad verses on another, there is the court and right of action.
HOR.
No doubt, if bad:
but if good, and he be praised by Cæsar as his judge ?
If one whose life is spotless has snarled at him who obloquy deserves?
TREE.
The prosecution will break down in mirth;
you will get off Scot free.
What merit and how great it is, good friends, to live on little (now these are not my words, but what Ofellus taught, a man of simple life, a sage to no creed bound, but blessed with homely mother-wit), learn, not among glittering plates and polished boards, when eyes are dazed with senseless glare, and when the mind, prone to be caught by hollow show, the better part declines-but here, before we dine, discuss with me.
Why so ?
I'll tell you, if I can.
Every man whose judgment's warped is in bad case to weigh the truth.
Having hunted hares, or been worn out by an unbroken horse-or if Roman sports fatigue you accustomed to the Greek, whether the flying ball attracts you, play at ball, your eagerness gently beguiling the arduous toil, or if you prefer the quoit, smite with the quoit the yielding air -when exercise has banished dainty qualms, when racked with thirst and hunger, spurn if you can, plain wholesome food;
drink nought but honey of Hymettus mixed with Falernian wine.
The steward is from home and the dark stormy sea protects the fish :
bread with salt will do quite well to soothe your howling appetite."
Whence or how, do you think, is this procured ?
The height of pleasure is not in the smell of costly cookery, but in yourself.
Seek relishes by sweating toil:
the man who's bloated by excess, and pale, nor scar, nor oyster, nor foreign bird will aid.
Yet when a peacock is served up, I scarcely shall restrain you, misled by empty show, from the wish to gratify your throat with it in preference to fowl, because the rarity costs gold to buy, and with its gaudy tail displays to view a beauteous sight;
as if that can touch the matter in the least.
Do you eat that plumage which you praise?
Has it an equal beauty when it's cooked.
Yet though they differ nought in flesh, you that prefer to this, being led astray by changed exteriors !
Be it so:
but how do you come to know whether the pike, with open mouth, was caught in Tiber, or at sea, whether it was tossed between the bridges or at the mouth of Tuscan Tiber?
0 senseless man, you praise a three-pound mullet which you must serve in several helps.
The appear­ ance takes you, I perceive;
what is the point, then, in disliking monster pike?
Because, no doubt, Nature has given the one1 a larger size, the other lighter weight.
A stomach rarely hungry despises common food.
I should like to see a “great big" fish laid out at length upon a " great big " plate, says the gullet worthy the greedy Harpies.
But come, ye South Winds, and with potent influence cook their dainties for them,-although the fresh caught turbot and the boar seem fetid when surfeit galls the sickly stomach, when laden it longs for radishes and bitter herbs.
And yet all humble fare has not been banished from the tables of the great:
for nowadays a place is found for common eggs and dusky olives of the poor.
Not very long ago Gallonius, of auction fame, rendered his board notorious by serving up a sturgeon to his guests.
What ?
Did the seas at that time fewer turbots rear ?
The turbot then was safe, the stork, too, in her nest, till one with Prætor’s rank improved your tastes.
And thus if one should now his edict give that divers broiled are sweet and good, the Roman youth, too easy to be led, will yield consent.
A mean will from a frugal diet differ far, Ofellus thinks;
for vain it is one fault to shun if to another you perversely turn.
Avidienus, to whom the name of "Dog" adheres, from real nature drawn, eats olives five years old and cornels growing wild, and ne'er draws off his wine till it is sour;
and though, all clothed in white, he celebrates a marriage feast, birthday or other fête, he from a two pound horn will on his cabbage drop some oil the smell of which you could not bear-not niggard of his long kept vinegar.
What style of life, then, shall the wise man choose, and which of these is he to follow ?
This side the wolf besets, that side the dog, as people say.
The wise man will be refined, so far as not to give offence by meanness, nor weakly to lean to either style of living.
He neither will to slaves be harsh, like old Albucius, when he assigns their tasks;
nor will he, -as the heedless Nævius, give greasy water to his guests:
this also is a grievous fault.
Hear now what blessings, and how great, a frugal diet brings.
And first of all you'll be in health :
for you can see how hurtful to a man variety will prove, when of that food you think, which once, in simple form, agreed so well:
but soon as you have mingled roast with boiled, shell-fish with fowl, the sweet will bile become, and the tough phlegm will quite upset your stomach.
See you how every one arises pale from a distracting meal?
1 Nay, the body too, by yesterday's excess o'erladen, weighs down with it the soul as well, and rivets to earth that " vital spark of heavenly flame."
The other, when sooner than said he has refreshed himself and gone to sleep, rises all hale to his appointed tasks.
But yet he can at times to better fare resort, should the revolving year bring round a festal day, or should he wish to invig­ orate his wasted frame;
or when his years advance and feebleness demands more generous cheer:
but should ill­ health or crippling age fall to its lot, what can you add to that indulgence, which young and strong you take before the time ?
The ancients praised a rancid boar, not because they failed in power of nose, but with this intent, I think, that strangers coming late might eat it with more zest when " high," than greedy host, when fresh.
Would that the new- made world had given me birth among those noble men !
You make account of public talk, I hope, which sweeter than poet's lays attracts the ears of men :
great turbots and great plates bring with them great disgrace and loss.
Add to this an angry uncle, your neighbours and yourself ill-pleased with you :
and though you long for death, 'tis vain, as not a copper have you left to buy a rope.
Trausius, one says, is rightly chid by these your words;
but I have lordly revenues, and means enough to satisfy three kings.
Is there then no better way in which you can expend your extra wealth?
Why is there any one in need who ought not so to be, while you are rich ?
Why do the ancient temples of the gods to ruin fall ?
Why do you not, ungrateful man, mete out a part of such a hoard to much-loved fatherland ?
With you alone, forsooth, things will go well for ever!
oh, what a laughing- stock to foes hereafter !
Which will on better grounds have trust in self 'gainst troublous days ?
he who accustoms pam­ pered mind and frame to many lusts, or he who pleased with little things and mindful of his future years, in times of peace prepares, as wise men ought, things requisite for war ?
To give more credence to my words, I testify that when a little boy I knew Ofellus used his means, when unimpaired, with no more freedom than now when scant.
You may see him in his scheduled1 farm, with cattle and with sons, a sturdy tenant at a rent, discoursing thus :
—I was not apt to eat on working days aught but my cabbage and smoked ham.
And whether a friend long absent, or a neigh­ bour as a welcome guest had come upon me free from labour on some rainy day, we made a hearty meal-not upon fish brought from the town, but upon kid and chicken of our own.
Then nuts and raisins with split figs adorned the second course.
Thereafter 'twas our sport to drink, a forfeit being our only check, and Ceres addressed with this prayer, 11 so might she rise " with lofty stalk, smoothed off by wine the careworn sadness of the wrinkled brow.
Let Fortune frown and new commotions raise:
how much will she from present comforts take ?
How much less sleek and healthy have we been, my lads, since this new settler came ?
For neither him, nor me, nor any one, has Nature made the Master of the soil in proper right:
us he has driven out:
him either lavish waste, or ignorance of subtle law, or last of all an heir of longer life will certainly eject.
The land now in Umbrenus' name, but lately of Ofellus called, will be the lasting right of none, but now will fall to me, to use, now to another.
Wherefore spend life, still stout of heart, and to adversity present a dauntless heart.
DAMASIPPUS.
So seldom do you write, that not four times a year do you for parchment ask, recasting all you write, with self ill-pleased, because, too fond of wine and sleep, you make no poems that become the public talk.
What will be done ?
And yet in Saturnalia times, you say, you have sought refuge here.
Well, temperate now, pen something that befits your great intents :
begin.
There's no result:
the pens are blamed in vain:
the wall, built under frowns of poets and of gods, is beaten sore, though free from fault.
And yet you had the look of one who loudly promised many things, and noble too, soon as your cottage home received you, free from worry, neath its cozy roof.
What was the use of crushing Plato by Menander's tomes, or taking out Archilochus with Eupolis, so bulky1 friends.
Would you odium appease by leaving virtue's cause ?
You, wretched man, shall earn contempt.
That vicious siren, Sloth, you must avoid, or cast aside, with easy mind, what name you gained in better days.
HORATIUS.
0 Damasippus, may the gods and goddesses, provide you with a barber for your true advice.
But how pray, know you me so well ?
DAM.
Since at Mid-Janus all my means were wrecked, of others' business only I take heed, from my own set loose.
For in former days I loved to seek some dish of bronze in which the crafty Sisyphus had washed his feet;
whatever was rudely chiselled ;
and what was stiffly cast;
with all the skill of connoisseur I put a hundred thousand 1 on statues, this or that:
gardens and splendid mansions I alone could buy at profitable rate :
and hence the crowded streets nick­ named me ' Mercury.
'HOR.
I know it all, and wonder how you're cured of that disease.
DAM.
And yet the new one has dispelled the old in manner strange, as when the pain of aching side, or head, straight to the stomach flies, like yonder man when from his drowsy sleep he starts and plies the doctor with his fists.
HOR.
So long as you don't treat me so, be it as you will.
DAM.
Good friend, that you may not deceive yourself, you too are mad, and so, it may be said, is every fool, if there's any truth in what Stertinius prates, from whom, I, apt to learn, wrote down these wondrous precepts, when solacing my grief he bid me grow the beard of a philosopher, and from Fabricius' bridge return, my sadness gone :
for when having lost my all I was about to jump into the stream with covered head, he stood beside me on the right 2 and said, See you do nothing to disgrace yourself:
false shame, I see, afflicts you, who 'midst a world of madmen dread to be reckoned mad.
For first I shall inquire, what madness is:
if this is found in you alone I will not add a word to hinder you from dying like a man.
Him whom vicious folly, and him too whom ignorance of truth drives blindly on, Chry­ sippus' Porch and School denounce as mad.
This formula includes whole nations, mighty kings, the philosopher alone exempt.
Now, hear why all who call you mad are just as mad them­ selves.
As in the forest, where an error leads men to wander from the proper path, one veers to left, and one to right:
both make the same mistake but it baffles them on different sides:
to this extent then think yourself insane, that he who laughs at you, not one whit wiser, behind him draws a tail.
2
One kind of fool there is, who dreads things noways to be feared, so that he cries that fires, and rocks and rivers confront him in the plain:
another kind of folly, and different from this and nothing wiser, is that of him who rushes madly through midst of fires and streams.
Though mother, sister, father, wife and all his kin call out—there’s a deep ditch, there's a huge cliff, take care—he’d hear no more than once did drunken Fufius, when acting Ilione, he sleeps all through his part, though twelve hundred Catieni shouted loud, " Mother, on you I call."
I'll prove to you that most of men a similar mania show.
Damasippus has the craze to buy up statues, antique in style;
is that man sane in mind who lends to Damasippus ?
Grant it, for the present!
If I should say, Here, take a loan which you need ne'er repay, shall you be deemed in­ sane if you accept?
or rather, senseless, if you refuse the boon which Mercury in kindness gives.
Draw up ten bonds after the form of Nerius3:
'tis not enough:
a hundred add, with all Cicuta's quirks — aye, a thousand obligations, if you will;
yet this accursed Proteus will wriggle out from all your fetters.
When you shall hurry him to court laughing with jaws not his, he will become a boar and then a bird, again, a stone, and when he wills, a tree.
If to mismanage one's affairs proves him a fool;
if on the other hand to guide them well stamps him a man of sense;
much more addled, trust me, is Perellius' brain, who lends what you can ne'er repay.
I bid all those to listen and their robes adjust,1 who suffer from depraved ambition or the love of wealth, who are inflamed by luxury, superstition fell or other mental ill;
come nearer me in order, while I prove that all are mad.
By far the largest dose of hellebore to misers must be given:
I rather think that common sense would grant to them Anticyra and all its stores.
Staberius' heirs wrote on his tomb the total sum he left:
bound, if they did it not, to give, in public show, a hundred pairs of fencers, and a funeral feast to suit the taste of Arrius, and corn as much as fertile Africa reaps.
Whether my wish be right or wrong, he said, be not unkind2 to me.
This,3 I believe, Staberius' wary mind foresaw.
What, think you, then, was his intent when he desired his heirs to carve upon his tomb the total sum he left ?
Poverty he deemed a grievous sin his whole life through, and nothing did he guard against more keenly;
so that had he chanced to die one farthing poorer, he would have thought himself a more immoral man :
for all things human and divine, virtue, renown, and honour, to noble riches bow :
and who has these amassed shall be illustrious, brave, and just.
And wise, as well ?
even so;
and king and whatsoe'er he wish.
This, as if by virtue gained, he hoped would bring him great and worthy praise.
What did the Grecian Aristippus do like this ?
who in midst of Libya bid his slaves fling down their gold, because they marched too slowly, by their load kept back.
Which of the two is more insane?
An instance nothing proves which by starting a doubt a doubt resolves.
If one buys lyres, and after buying stores them in a heap, though given neither to the lyre nor any kind of song;
if one who's not a cobbler gathers knives and lasts ;
if one averse to merchants life invests in sails for ships :
he would on all hands be esteemed deranged and mad, and rightly so.
How differs he from these who hoards his silver and his gold and cannot use them when they're stored, and dreads to touch them, as if sacred things ?
If any one stretched at full length on a great heap of corn should always keep a watch, long cudgel in his hands, nor should he, though its owner, and hungry too, dare to touch a single grain, but should rather, as a miser, live on bitter leaves ;
if while a thousand casks of old Falernian or of Chian wine lie in his stores—that's nothing, three hundred thousand-he drinks sharp vinegar;
nay, if besides, he would lie on hard straw pallet, when eighty years, save one, while rich and costly coverlets waste in his chests, the food of grubs and moths :
no doubt he would seem mad to few, because the greater part of men are troubled by the same disease.
O god-forsaken dotard, do you guard these things, in order that a son or freedman as your heir may squander all on drink ?
surely it cannot be lest you yourself should come to want ?
For what a trifle will each day from all your hoard deduct, if you begin to pour on your cabbage better oil, and to anoint your head, foul with unheeded scurf?
If any­ thing's enough, why do you swindle, and purloin, and rob, and plunder everywhere ?
Are you sane at such a time ?
If you began to pelt with stones the people as they pass, and to abuse your slaves whom with your gold you bought, the boys and girls every one would cry aloud that you were mad:
when with a rope you kill your wife, your mother with a drug, are you then quite sound in mind ?
1
Why ?
Neither at Argos nor with the sword do you commit the deed, as Orestes slew his mother when by madness roused.
Do you suppose that he grew mad after he slew his mother, and that he was not driven so by " naughty Furies " before that in a parent's throat he warmed his whetted blade ?
But from the time Orestes was esteemed unsound in mind, he certainly did nothing which you could condemn.
At Pylades no stroke he aimed, nor sister Electra did he dare to wound:
he merely rated both, calling her a Fury, him something else which lordly rage 2 called forth.
A poor man was Opimius though gold and silver were in store at home;
he was wont to drink Veientine wine at festal times from Capuan earthen ware, and vapid wine on common days :
he once by heavy lethargy was seized, so that his heir bustled around his coffers and his keys, in buoyant joy.
Him the doctor, prompt in resource and faithful to his trust, stirred up as follows :
-he ordered that a table be set forth, and on it emptied out some bags of gold, and bade some men advance and count the coin :
thus he roused the man;
this too he adds;
unless you guard your property with care, at once your eager heir will carry all away.
While I still live ?
That you may live then, keep awake:
make this your business.
What do you mean ?
Your strength will sink for want of nourishment, unless some food and great support be given to your failing stomach:
do you hesitate ?
Come now, take this small cup of rice.
How much did it cost ?
A trifle.
How much then ?
Eight pence.
Alas!
what matters it, whether I perish by disease, or by theft and vile extortion ?
Who then is sane ?
He who is not a fool.
What of the avaricious man ?
He's fool and madman both.
What ?
if any one is not a miser, is he then and there quite sound in mind ?
By no means.
Why, 0 Stoic ?
I will tell you.
Suppose that Craterus had said, this patient has no stomach­ ill :
is he therefore well, and shall he rise ?
He will say, No, because his lungs or kidneys are attacked by sharp disease.
He is not perjured, nor niggard in his ways :
let him sacrifice a hog to the propitious Lares:
but he is ambi­ tious, and bold in design ;
let him sail for Anticyra right off.
For what is the difference, whether you fling in a pit all you possess, or never use what you've acquired ?
Servius Oppidius, a wealthy man, as things were reckoned then, left to his sons, 'tis said, two farms hard by Canusium, and thus spoke to the lads called to his dying bed.
Aulus, when I saw that in your toga's open folds, you carried dice and nuts, gave them away and gambled:
that you, Tiberius, counted and hid them in holes with saddened look, I feared lest madness of different sorts might actuate your life,-that you should copy Nomentanus' waste, and you, Cicuta's greed.
So by your family gods I both implore—you that you lessen not, you that you do not swell, that which your father deems enough and Nature checks.
Moreover, lest ambition should allure your minds, I'll bind you both by solemn bond­ whichever shall become an Aedile or a Praetor, let him be an " outlawed and accursed " man.
You would waste your means on vetches, beans, and lupines, that in the Circus you may stalk about in ample robe, and as a brazen figure stand, stript of your lands, stript of your fathers means, you fool;
forsooth, that you may win the plaudits which Agrippa gets-the cunning fox aping the king of beasts.
Atrides, you forbid that any one should rites of sepulture to Ajax give, and why ?
I am king.
A common man, I ask no more.
The thing that I command is fair:
if to any I may seem not just, I give him leave to speak his mind with neither pain nor penalty.
Mightiest of kings !
Heaven grant that you may conquer Troy and safely bring again your fleet!
Then, am I free to ask advice, and give it you, in turn.
Yes, ask.
Why do the bones of Ajax moulder above ground-a hero, next to Achilles' self, and one so often famed for sons of Greece preserved,-is it that Priam, and Priam's people too, may glory o'er the unburied dead, through whom so many youths ne'er joined their fathers in the grave ?
In his maddened rage he did to death a thousand sheep, calling loudly that he was slaying famed Ulysses, Menelaus, and myself as well.
When you at Aulis place your darling child, in heifer's stead, before the altar-hearth, and sprinkle on her head the salted grain, are you then right in mind, you wicked man ?
What is the drift of this ?
For what did " madman "
Ajax do, when with his sword he slew the flock?
From wife and son he violence with­ held:
he heaped on the Atridae many curses, but neither Teucer nor even Ulysses, did he harm.
But I, in order to release my ships from the unfriendly shore, of purpose set appeased the gods with blood.
Aye, with your own, you raving madman !
My own, but I'm no raving madman.
He who shall take false views of what is real, what is crime, which in the whirl of passion are confused, shall be esteemed deranged in mind, and it will matter not a whit whether he err from lack of judgment or through anger's heat.
When Ajax slays the harmless lambs, he is insane :
when you knowingly commit a crime for vain renown, are you of stable mind?
And when your heart's puffed up with pride, at such time, say is it free from taint of madness ?
If one should take delight to carry in his chair a clean and dainty lamb, should buy it dress, as for a girl, should get it maids, and trinkets rare, should call it Rufa or Posilla, should mark it out as wife for gallant knight, from such a one the Proctor would by decree withdraw all right of property, and the charge of him would on sane friends devolve.
What ?
If any one devote his daughter for a speechless lamb, is he untouched in brain?
Say not so.
And thus where sinful folly is, then there is the greatest madness.
He whom the glare of fame has caught, Bellona, who in bloody deeds delights, has maddened by her thun­ der's roar.
Come now, arraign with me the spendthrift Nomentanus and his wanton waste.
Common sense will show that foolish prodigals are mad.
For soon as he got the twenty talents which his father left, he straightway gave it forth that those who dealt in fish and fruit and game, and perfumes, and all the rabble crowd of Tuscan Street, the sausage maker with buffoons, all the market and Velabrum too, should come next morning to his house.
What then?
They came in crowds.
The pander speaks for all:
What- ever I or any here have at our homes, regard it yours, to-day demand it or to-morrow.
Hear the considerate youth's reply:
In Lucanian snow you sleep with leggings on, that I may dine on boar:
you from a wintry sea with sweep-net drag my fish.
I am an idler, unworthy to possess so much:
take it, here's a million 1 for your share :
the same for you;
three times as much for you, whose wife at midnight hurries to my call.
The son of Æsop dissolved in vinegar a famous pearl which he had taken from Metella's ear, that he might quaff a million at a draught:
how was he less mad than if he threw that same into a sewer or a torrent stream ?
The sons of Quintus Arrius, a pretty pair of brothers, twins in debauchery and silly tastes, and love of all that's bad, were wont to lunch on nightingales, bought at a fancy price-into which class are they to go ?
Marked with chalk as sane, or the reverse with coal ?
If to a bearded man it gives delight to build toy-huts, to yoke to a little cart mouse paired with mouse, to play at odd and even, to gallop on a stick, madness must turn his head.
If sober reason proves that love's more childish still, and that it matters not whether in the sand you play your game, as when a three-year-old, or whine, tormented by some harlot's love, would you do, I ask, what Polemo, reformed, did long ago ?
Would you remove the tokens of disease, the stockings, elbow-rests, and scarfs, as he, when drunk, with stealthy movement snatched from his neck the wreath, being smitten by the language of the Master, fasting still ?
If you offer apples to a boy when angry, he declines them.
Take them, you little dog;
he says he won't:
if you don't give them, he would long for them:
how does the lover, turned adrift, differ from this, when he inwardly debates whether he is to go or not where he was about to go again without being called, and loiters still beside the hated doors ?
Shall I not, even now, approach when of her own accord she calls?
or rather resolve to put an end to all my worry ?
She shut me out:
she calls me back:
am I to return ?
No, not though she implore me.
Here's what the slave says, not a little wiser than his Master:
Master, things which have neither limit nor reason, by limit or reason cannot be treated.
In love there are these draw­ backs, war, then peace again ;
these things which chop and change like storms, and come and go by blinded chance, if any one should strive to render regular and fixed, he would no more succeed 1 than if he tried to be insane on certain principles and rules.
What, are you sane in mind 2 when picking apple pips you are rejoiced if perchance you hit the roof?
What, when with your aged mouth 3 you lisp your words of love how are you more sane than he who builds his baby-huts ?
Add blood to folly, and poke the fire with a sword.
4
Just now, I say, when Marius, after slaying Hellas, jumped headlong to his doom, was he crack-brained, or will you free him of the charge of madness and condemn him of the crime, applying kindred words to things, as nowadays is often done?
There was once a freedman, who when old was wont at early morn to run from street to street 1 with hands well laved, and ere he tasted food or drink, and thus he used to pray;
save me alone-not much I ask you, is it ?-save me alone from death, for that is easy to the gods !
in ears and eyes he was quite sound :
the mind his Master would except if he was put to sale, unless he wished to court a law­ suit.
This crowd too will Chrysippus place in the pro­ line ranks of the Menenian gens.

Jupiter, who sendest and removest aches, says the mother of the boy for five long months confined to bed, if the quartan chill shall leave the lad, that morning when your feast's proclaimed, he shall stand in Tiber, all unclad.
Should Chance or doctor lift the patient from the brink of death, the frenzied mother will her son destroy by planting him upon the chilly bank and will renew the fever:
by what sad malady in mind distraught ?
By superstition.
Such arms did Stertinius, eighth of the sages, give to me his friend, that henceforth I should never with impunity be hailed as mad.
Whoever shall so call me shall be as often called the same, and shall learn to look on that which from his back depends, unknown to him.
HOR.
0 Stoic, answer me, and so I pray that after loss you may sell all at higher gain, what kind of madness,-for there's more than one,-do you think that I'm possessed of?
For to myself I seem quite sane.
DAM.
What, when Agave holds in her hands the severed head of her ill-fated son, does she believe she's raving mad ?
HOR.
I confess that I am foolish-one must grant what's true-and mad as well.
This only plainly say, with which defect of mind do you suppose that I'm affected ?
DAM.
Hear:
first of all, you build, that is, you ape the great—you who from head to foot, take all your height, do not exceed a two-foot rule, and yet you ridicule the air and gait of Turbo when equipped, as for his size of body far too great:
how are you less ridiculous than he ?
Whatever Maecenas does is't right that you, so different in position, should do the same, and so unable to compete with him ?
Young frogs, in absence of their dam, were trampled by a calf, but one escaping tells his mother how a monster beast has crushed his kin.
She asked how big it was?
blowing herself out, she said, it couldn't have been so big, now could it ?
Half as big again.
Surely not as big as this?
When she puffed out still more and more, the frogling said, you wouldn't be so big, says she, if you would burst yourself.
This little picture is not far from fitting you.
Then add your poetry,-that is, throw oil upon the fire;
and if any sane man ever made it, you are in your senses when you make it too.
Of your horrid temper I do not need to speak.
HOR.
Now stop.
DAM.
Of your style of living, far beyond your means.
HOR.
Damasippus, mind your own affairs.
DAM.
Your thousand love intrigues.
HOR.
0 greater madman, spare, I pray, one less insane.
HORATIUS.
Whence, and whither, Catius ?
CATIUS.
I have not a moment, being eager to commit to writing novel precepts, such as surpass Pythagoras and Socrates and learned Plato.
HOR.
My error I confess for stopping you at such an awkward time;
but, in your goodness, pardon me, I pray.
For if anything has now escaped your mind, you will soon recall it;
whether your gift of memory is natural or acquired,2 you are wonderful in both.
CAT.
Nay, that was just my thought, how I should retain them all, since the points are subtle, and in subtle language couched.
HOR.
Tell me the man's name, and if he be a Roman or a stranger.
CAT.
The precepts I will reveal as memory serves:
the author's name I will withhold.
Remember that you serve up eggs of oblong shape, being better in flavour and whiter than the round:
for the white being firm contains a male-bird yolk.
The cabbage of the drier fields surpasses that grown round the city:
there's nothing more insipid than the pro­ duce of much watered plots.
Should a guest at eventide come on you unawares, that the fowl may not be tough and disappoint his taste, you will show your skill by plunging it, while still alive, in fresh Falernian must:
and this will make it tender.
Mushrooms of the meadows are in quality the best:
others you cannot safely trust.
That man will spend his summers in a healthy state, who shall end his mid-day meal with dusky mulberries plucked from the tree before the sun is hot.
Aufidius was wont to mix with honey strong Falernian wine,-wrongly so, for nought but what is mild should be infused in empty veins;
with mead that's mild more safely will you wet your stomach's coats.
If sluggish bowels fail to act, mussels and common shell­ fish will remove the block, and the blade of humble sorrel, but not without white Coan wine.
The slippery shellfish are enlarged by waxing moons, but every sea is not produc­ tive of the better kinds.
Peloris from the Lucrine Lake, is finer than the Baian murex :
at Circeii oysters are raised and urchins at Misenum:
luxurious Tarentum prides itself on ample scallops.
Not every one can lightly claim the art of giving dinners, till he has studied out the subtle theory of tastes.
Nor is't enough to sweep away the fish from an expen­ sive stall, while ignorant what it is best to stew, and for what when broiled, the tired guest will rest again at once upon his elbow.
1An Umbrian boar, fed on the acorns of the oak, bends by its weight the dishes of the man who shuns all flesh devoid of flavour :
for the Laurentian hog is worthless, fattened upon sedge and reeds.
The vineyard does not always give such roes as one can eat.
The philosopher 2 will seek the shoulders of a prolific hare.
Though men have sought to know what are the special qualities and age for fish and birds, no palate before mine the secret found.
Some there are whose intellect invents new kinds of cakes and nothing else.
It's not enough by any means to use up all your thoughts on one thing only :
as if a man should care for this alone that his wine be not below the mark, ne'er thinking of the oil he pours upon his fish.
If you expose your Massic wine beneath a cloudless sky, all that is thick in it will disappear beneath the breeze of night, and the fumes hurtful to the nerves will pass away, but if it's strained through linen cloth, its genuine flavour's lost.
He who with cunning skill mixes Surrentine wine with dregs of Falernian casks, easily collects the sediment with pigeons' eggs, since the yolk falls to the bottom, drawing with it foreign matter.
With roasted shrimps and Afric snails, you will recruit the jaded drinker, for lettuce floats on the stomach, which when acid after wine, seeks to be roused, when hunger-bitten, rather by sausages and ham :
nay, it would prefer whatever comes piping-hot from filthy cook shops.
It is worth your while fully to know the quality of double sauce.
The simple kind consists of sweet oil olive :
and this it will be right to mix with richer wine, and brine of which Byzantine jars are wont to reek.
When this, mixed up, has boiled, the herbs being chopped, and has stood a while, sprinkled with Corycian saffron, you will add besides, for compound sauce, that which the berry of Venafrum yields when pressed.
The apples of Tibur must for flavour to Picenum give the palm, for in appearance they excel.
The grape, Venucula, suits for preserves1:
the Alban you had better dry in smoke.
You will find that I'm the first to place around the board on spotless plates this kind of grape, with apples, lees, too, and brine, and white pepper with black salt sifted in.
It is a huge mistake to give three thousand in the market and then coop up the roving fish upon a narrow plate.
It causes to the stomach great offence, if a slave have touched a cup with hands made greasy while he gobbled up the stolen scraps:
or if thick sediment still sticks to an ancient bowl.
On napkin, sawdust, and cheap broom, how little need be spent ?
When they're neglected 'tis a great disgrace.
Would you propose to scrub your inlaid floors with dirty brooms, and over Tyrian cushions throw your covers all unwashed, forgetting that the less these need expense and care, so much more justly may the want of them be blamed, than of those which can't be found save at a rich man's feasts ?
HOR.
0 learned Catius, I entreat you by our friendship and the gods, forget not to take me with you, where'er you go, to hear the man.
For though you rehearse it all to me with retentive mind, yet as reporter you cannot give the same delight.
Then add his looks and attitude, which you, blessed by a sight of him, lay little stress upon because you've had it:
but I, for one, have no small thirst to mount to distant springs and be able to drink in the wondrous precepts of a happy life.
ULYSSES.
Besides what you've already said, Tiresias, pray answer this I ask, by what devices and what means can I regain the wealth I lost:
why do you smile ?
TIRESIAS.
Is't not enough for crafty man like you to sail again to Ithaca and see once more his fathers' gods ?
ULYSSES.
0 you who ne'er to mortal man spoke false, you see how poor and naked I to my house return, as you foretell, and find that there nor herd nor store by suitors has been spared ;
and yet both family and worth are valueless as wrack, without the purse.
TIRESIAS.
Since it is poverty you dread, to use no roundabout, learn by what means you may again be rich.
Should thrush or other dainty to yourself be given, let it haste on rapid wing to where great wealth is seen, the owner old and frail:
let Dives, than the Lares holier still, before them taste sweet apples, and the glories which your cultured homestead yields :
and though he be a man forsworn, with­ out a gens to name, with brother's blood defiled, aye e'en a runaway, don't you refuse to go a walk if he should wish, and take the outer side.
ULYSSES.
(Do you mean) that I should guard some filthy Dama's side?
It was not thus I bore myself at Troy, but always with my betters strove.
TIRESIAS.
Well, then, you'll be a pauper still.
ULYSSES.
I'll bid my valiant soul to brook even this :
besides, I suffered worse in olden days.
0 seer, tell me farther, pray, how riches I can gain and piles of wealth amass.
TIRESIAS.
I've told you, and tell you once again:
with cunning craft, at every turn fish for the wills of aged men;
and should a knowing one, or two, eat off the bait and 'scape your snare, neither abandon hope, nor, baffled once, give up the art.
Should a lawsuit, great or less, be ever in the Forum tried, whichever party of the two shall live in wealthy state, without a child, be he unscrupulous enough boldly to summon into court, without a ground for suit, one better than himself, be you that man's defender:
the citizen with better name and case spurn with contempt, if there be at home a soil or fruitful wife.
" Quintus," suppose, or "Publius " (ears re­ fined delight in surnames), " your worth has made me friend indeed :
I'm versed in subtle law, all causes I can plead :
one will sooner tear my eyes out than scorn and rob you of an empty nut:
this is my great concern that you no money lose, nor be a butt for jests."
Advise him to go home, and nurse himself;
take you his case in charge;
persist and persevere, whether the fiery dogstar rends the speechless statues, or Furius, stuffed with juicy tripe, be-spits the wintry Alps with hoary snow.
Do you not see one nudging his nearest mate, will say, how amiable he is, to friends obliging, how keen and active ?
More tunnies will swim in and your preserves will fill.
Moreover, if a sickly son is reared as heir to great estates, lest barefaced court of childless men should show your aim, by attentions, close but unmarked, creep slowly to the hope that you may be inscribed as second heir, and if some chance should send the youth to Orcus, that you may come into his place:
this hazard very seldom fails.
When any one shall show his will for you to read, forget not to refuse, and push the deed away, but so that by a side­ long glance you find what the first page may mean upon its second line :
scan with a rapid eye, if you are heir alone or a co-heir with many.
A notary, from Quinquevir recast,1 will, most times, mock the gaping crow, and Nasica as he fortunes hunts will give Coranus many a laugh.
ULYSSES.
Are you frenzied, or do you mock me pur­ posely by words obscure ?
TIRESIAS.
Son of Laertes, whatso'er I say will come to pass, or else it won't:
for great Apollo grants me the power to divine.
ULYSSES.
Yet tell me, if you may, what means that tale of yours ?
TIRESIAS.
What time a youth, the Parthians' dread, a scion sprung from great Æneas, shall be a mighty prince by land and sea, the stalwart daughter of Nasica, who wishes not to pay his full amount, will join herself in wedlock to the brave Coranus.
The son-in-law will then do this :
he'll give his sire-in-law the will and beg that he would read it through:
Nasica will at last accept the tablets oft refused, and silently will read, and then will find that nought is left to him and his but to bewail their lot.
This farther I advise:
if perchance some crafty woman or freed slave manage an oldish doting man, attach your­ self to them as partner in the work:
praise them to him that you in absence may be praised.
This also helps :
but it is better far to storm the citadel itself at first.
If he is mad enough to write vile poems, commend him to the full.
In my old age what I'm about to tell took place :
a horrid crone was buried thus at Thebes, according to her will:
the heir on his naked shoulders bore the corpse besmeared with oil in plenty, to try, forsooth, if even in death she could elude his grasp;
because, I fancy, he had been too insistent while she lived.
With caution make approaches :
and neither fail in duty, nor overdo your zeal.
The man who talks too much will give offence to peevish and to moody men;
still be not over-silent.
Be Davus in the play, and stand with head down-bent, and very like to one in awe.
Make your advances with a fawning care:
if the breeze has freshened, warn him to cover up his precious head for caution's sake :
relieve him from the crowd by shoving with your shoulders;
and if he's talkative lend him still a ready ear.
1
Has he an inordinate love of praise, ply him with it till he shall lift his hands to heaven, and cry, hold, that's enough :
blow up the swelling bladder with your vaunting words.
When he has freed you by his death from tedious bondage and from care, and wide awake you hear without a doubt, " Let Ulysses have the fourth of my estate," now and then let fall such words, "Ah, then, is Dama, dear companion, now no more ?
Where shall I find another friend so sted­ fast and so true ?
and if you can, shed a few tears :
'tis easy to conceal your face, a tell-tale of your joy.
His tomb, if left to your discretion, erect with no mean stint:
let the neighbours praise a funeral, handsomely conducted.
Should any of your older fellow-heirs be found to suffer from a racking cough, say to him that if he wishes to be­ come the buyer of a farm or of a house from your share of the estate, you will gladly make it over to him for a sesterce.
But Proserpine, whose will is law, now drags me hence.
Farewell;
long life to you.
This was a wish of mine;
—a piece of land, not very large, in which there was a garden, and near the house a spring of never-failing water, and, over and above, a little wood.
The gods have dealt by me more liberally, and better than I hoped.
I am content.
No more I ask, 0 son of Maia, but that you make these things my own for life.
If hitherto I've not increased my goods by wicked arts, nor am about to make them less by vice or negligence;
if I offer up no foolish prayer like this :
0 that to my farm were joined that tiny nook which mars just now its shapely form!
0 if some lucky chance would show to me a pot of money, as once it did to him, who working on a farm for hire, bought with the treasure-trove, and tilled as his own, that self-same land-thanks to kind Hercules, a rich man now.
If what I have contents my mind and makes it grateful, I entreat you, with this prayer, "For the owner make heavy 1 both his flocks and herds and all things else except his mind, and as you're wont be ever near me as my surest guard.
"So when from the city I have moved out to my fortress and my hills, what should I sooner 2 celebrate in these my satires and poetic prose?
Neither does base ambition hurt me, nor sirocco with depressing air, nor deadly autumn, the harvest time of heartless Libitina.
O Iather, God of the Dawn, or Janus, if you'd rather so be named, from whom men enter on the early toils of life and work,-so it has pleased the gods,-be you first topic of my verse.
At Rome you drag me out to bail a friend:
" Ho!
hurry on, lest another do the kindness ere you come!"
Should north wind scourge the earth, or winter lead the snowy day in shorter course,1 I'm bound to go.
Then having uttered in clear tones and in set form what some day afterwards may prove my hurt, I'm forced to struggle through the crowd and jostle those who won't move on.
"
What do you mean, you madman, and what are you about ? " and then he follows up, the surly dog, with imprecations full of wrath:
"You would knock everything about that's in your way, if you are hasting to Maecenas with a mind that ne'er forgets that treat."
This2 pleases me, and is sweet as honey to my taste;
I'll not deny it.
But soon as I reach Esquiliae with its gloomy past, a hundred cares of others patter on my head and ears, round front and flank:
" Roscius requested that you would meet him at the Puteal3 before the second hour."
"Quintus, the writers begged that you'd remember to come back about that new affair which interests all." " See to it, that Maecenas duly seals these documents."
Should you say, I'll try:
you can, if you wish, he adds, and urges you.
The seventh year, now nearing eighth, will soon be gone since Mæcenas first began to have me in the number of his friends;
so far as this at least, as one whom he would take to ride beside him when going to drive, and with whom he could exchange such simple chat as this:
"
What o'clock is it ?
Is the Thracian Gallina a match for Syrus ?
The morning cold now nips one if he shows not caution;
" and such remarks as may be safely trusted to a leaky ear.
Through all this time “our friend has been exposed to envy more and more from day to day and hour to hour. "
He had sat beside him at the games," says one:
" He had played in a match with him in the Campus," says another :
" He's a lucky fellow," say they all.
A chilling rumour spreads from the Rostra through the streets;
whoever meets me asks me of it:
" Good Sir, for you must know since you have closer contact with the great, have you heard anything about the Dacians? ” " Not a word, I do assure you." " How you will always jeer your friends !" " But may all the gods confound me if I've heard a whisper of it."
“What?
is it in Sicily or Italy that Caesar is to give the soldiers promised farms?"
When I swear that I know nothing of it, they wonder at me as the one and only man of silence, strange and deep.
'
Midst such distractions the day is lost and I made wretched, not without many a wish :
0 country, when shall I look on you again ?
when shall I be free, now with the books of men of yore, now with sleep and hours of idleness, to quaff the draught that all life's worries drowns ?
0 when shall beans, kin to Pythagoras, be placed on my board, and with them cabbage well soaked with fat of bacon ?
0 nights and suppers of the gods!
in which at my own fireside my friends and I enjoy our meal, and then I feed the saucy slaves on dishes we've but tasted.
The guests, each as he wishes, drain cups of varying strength, free from all silly rules, whether one of stronger head takes fiery cups, or another wishes to grow mellow with those of moderate strength.
And so the talk begins, not of others' houses in country or in town, not whether Lepos dances well or ill;
but we dis­ cuss what it concerns us more to know, and what it is hurtful not to know,-whether the happiness of men depends on virtue or on wealth:
or what draws us into friendships— self-interest or worth :
what is the nature of the Good, and what's the highest Good.
Meantime my neighbour Cervius tells in his chatty way old women's stories bearing on some mooted point.
For if one praise Arellius and his wealth, not knowing all the care it brings, he thus begins.
Once on a time a Country Mouse, 'tis said, received a city kinsman in his humble cell-an ancient guest now welcoming an ancient friend.
Rough in his way he was, and careful of his stores, but still he could at times relax his narrow soul to hospitable calls.
Why enlarge ?
A mouse like that grudged neither choice chick-pea nor long oat-heads;
and carrying in his mouth raisins and nibbled scraps of pork he offered them, anxious by a varied fare to overcome his guest's disdain, who barely touched each viand with his saucy tooth:
while the host himself stretched at his length on this year's straw ate spelt and darnel, leaving untouched the daintier fare.
At length, the City Mouse says to his host:
—“ My friend, what pleasure can it give to live midst hardships on the slope of this steep wooded height ?
Surely you prefer men and the city to these savage woods ?
Trust yourself to me and come along and bear me company;
since earthly things have mortal lives, and neither for high nor low is there escape from death:
wherefore, good sir, live happy while you can in pleasure's walks;
enjoy your life, and ever think how short your span must be.
"When these few words convinced the Country Mouse he bounds out nimbly from his home, and both perform their purposed march, anxious to creep into the town while still ’twas dark.
And now Night held the middle space of heaven, when both set footsteps in the gorgeous mansion of a wealthy man, where coverlets, in scarlet dyed, glowed on the ivory couch, and many dishes left from last day's feast were packed hard by in baskets high piled up.
So when he placed his rustic friend, stretched at full length on purple rug, the host runs up and down, like waiter with his tunic tucked, and brings course after course without a break, and like a slave performs his every duty, licking beforehand all he serves.
The other as he lolls at ease joys in his altered lot, and acts the part of happy guest in midst of all things good;
when all at once loud banging of the doors roused both from off the couch.
They run in consternation through the whole saloon, and dead with fright they trembled still the more soon as the lofty house resounded with Molossian dogs.
Then says the Country Mouse:
" Of such a life I've had enough," says he, " and so good-bye:
my wood and cell from dangers free will satisfy my needs with humble vetch."
DAV.
I have been listening all this time, and anxious to say a word or two, being only a slave I fear to venture.
HOR.
Is it Davus ?DAV.
Yes,
Davus, a slave who loves his master, and is tolerably honest, that is, that you may think him likely to live.
1HOR.
Come then, employ December liberty, since our forefathers so have willed;
speak on.
DAV.
Many men delight in vicious ways without a halt, and cling to their settled plan :
some fluctuate, now following the right, now wholly prone to wrong.
Priscus was often seen to wear three rings at once, again he had the left hand bare:
he lived an inconsistent life, so that from hour to hour he changed his stripe:
2 emerging from a splendid house he suddenly would plunge into a den, from which a freedman of the better sort would be ashamed to come.
At one time he'd prefer to live a profligate at Rome, again at Athens as a learned man, born under anger of the Vertumni, however many they may be.
The buffoon Volanerius, after the well-earned gout crippled his joints, maintained a slave at daily pay to lift the dice and put them in the box:
the more persistently a man goes on in vice, the less will he be wretched, and superior to him who strains now with a tightened, now with a slackened rope.
HOR.
Are you not going to tell me all this day, you rascal, what is the drift of this unsavoury stuff ?
DAV.
It aims at you, I say.
HOR.
How SO, you scoundrel ?
DAY.
You laud the income and the morals of the plebs of old, and yet if any god should suddenly put them in your reach, you'd out and out refuse, either because you do not really feel that that is better which you clamour for, or because you do not with firm conviction champion the right, and stick in the mire, striving in vain to pluck your foot out of the mud.
When at Rome you long for the country;
when living in the country, with fickle will you praise to the skies the city far away.
If it chance that you're invited nowhere, you laud your quiet dish of cabbage, and just as though you went from home only when forced, you say that you are happy, and are delighted that you're not obliged to sup out anywhere.
Should Mæcenas bid you to his house, at lighting of the lamps, as a later guest:
“ Will nobody bring me the oil1 more quickly ?
Does anybody hear me ? " you sputter out with a loud noise, and off you rush.
2 Milvius and the parasites depart, after they've prayed some prayers for you, not meant to be reported.
11 For," suppose he (Milvius) said " I confess that I am weak, and led by my appetite;
I raise my nose 3 to catch a flavour:
I'm devoid of self control, I have no energy, and if you wish still more, I'm a glutton."
Sir, when you yourself are what I am and worse, perhaps, would you inveigh 'gainst me, as if you were a better man, and cover up your faults in specious words ?
What if you be found a greater fool than I, bought for five hundred drachmae.
(Horace threatens violence.)
Cease to frighten me by scowling looks ;
restrain your hand and temper till I tell you what Crispinus' porter taught me....
I'm not a profligate, you say, nor by Hercules am I a thief when I wisely pass your silver plate.
Away with the risk, at once will froward nature take the leap, the curbs removed.
Are you my master, subject to so many and so strong restraints of men and things, whom the prætor's rod once and again applied will never free from painful dread ?
Add, moreover, this which will not have less force than what I've said 1:
for whether he's a helper who obeys a slave, as your custom has it, or a fellow-slave, what am I to you?
Without a doubt you who lord it over me are in a wretched bondage to another, and like a puppet, are led on by strings outside yourself.
Who, then, is free ?
The philosopher who controls him­ self, whom neither poverty, nor death, nor bonds affright, brave to resist his passions, honours to despise, and self­ contained withal, both smooth and round so that no foreign matter can to his polished surface cling, 'gainst whom even Fortune rushes impotent, and maims herself.
Can you find any thing in this that fits yourself?
A mistress demands five talents from you, she duns you for it, and as she drives you from her door, gives you a pail of water on your head, then calls you back ;
from such base yoke withdraw your neck;
come, say the word, 11 I'm free, I'm free."
You cannot;
for a master 2 nowise mild, your spirit rules, and goads you sharply when you're weary, and when you're restive, whirls you round and round.
Or when, you fool, you stand entranced before a picture done by Pausias, how are you less culpable than I when I admire the fights of Fulvius and of Rutuba, or of Pacideianus with sinew on the strain,1 painted in chalk or charcoal, to the very life, as if the men in thorough earnest fight, and deal their blows, and move their arms to parry strokes?
Then Davus is a good-for-nothing and an idle scamp, while you are called a subtle and a knowing judge of the " old Masters'" works.
I am worthless if attracted by a smoking cake.
Does your great self-denial and your strength of mind resist rich dinners, and why does my obedience to appetite more hurtful prove to me ?
My back pays for it.
How will you be punished less, who hunt for dainties that can't be had for nought ?
2
No doubt great feasts sought after without end grow loathsome, and the feet befooled refuse to bear the bloated frame.
Does that slave sin who under shade of night parts with a stolen scraper for a bunch of grapes:
is not he a slave who sells his farm to please his stomach ?
Here's another fault of yours:
you cannot be an hour alone, you can't employ your leisure right, and you fly from yourself as runaway and truant, trying now with wine and now with sleep to baffle Care.
It's all in vain:
for your grim attendant holds you close and follows as you fly.
HOR.
Where shall I get a stone ?
DAV.
What do you want it for ?
HOR.
Where arrows ?
DAV.
The man is either mad or making verses.
HOR.
If you don't get out of this in double quick, you'll join the other eight, and be a drudge upon my Sabine farm.
HORATIUS.
How did you enjoy Nasidienus' feast, that pet of Fortune ?
For when I sought you yesterday to dine with me, 'twas said you had been at his house since early afternoon.
FUNDANIUS.
So well, that never in my life did I enjoy myself so much.
HOR.
Tell me, if it isn't irksome, what dainty first appeased the rage of appetite.
FUND.
First a Lucanian boar was served ;
it was caught, the host declared, when Auster gently blew;
the garnishings were pungent turnips, lettuce, and radishes, which stimulate the languid stomach, with skirret, pickle, and lees of Coan wine.
This course removed, a slave, high tucked, wiped clean the maple board with purple cloth, while a second cleared away whatever scraps still lay about, which might be offen­ sive to the guests :
then, like an Attic virgin with Ceres' sacred trays, in stalks a swarthy slave, by name Hydaspes, who brings the Cæcuban, and Alcon follows with the Chian, but not that mixed with brine.
1
On this the host explains:
" Maecenas, if you prefer an Alban or Falernian wine to those set on, we have them both."HOR.
0 miserable riches !
But now, Fundanius, I should like to know who formed the company with whom you fared so well.
FUND.
I was on the highest couch, and near me Viscus of Thurii, and below me Varius, if I remember right:
with Servius Balatro Vibidius came, whom Mæcenas brought as extra guests.
1
Nomentanus was above the host, and below him Porcius, who at one mouthful gulped whole cakes like a buffoon :
Nomentanus' duty was to show with his finger any dish which haply was unseen :
for the other guests, we, I mean, feast on fowl, on shell and other fish, which had a hidden flavour far different from the common:
as even at once was plain when he had handed me the liver of a plaice and of a turbot, which none had tasted.
2Thereafter he informed me that honey-apples are rosy when plucked beneath a waning moon.
What profit this may be you'll better learn from the connoisseur himself.
Then Vibidius says to Balatro:
" unless we drink both deep and hard we shall die without revenge " ;
and asks for larger cups.
On this paleness changes the purveyor's face, who dreaded nought so much as heavy drinkers, either because they make their rude remarks too freely, or because the stronger wines deaden the keenness of the taste.
Vibidius and Balatro, all following suit, empty whole flagons into Alifanian cups.
The guests of the lowest couch did little damage to their master's flasks.
A lamprey at its length upon a dish is now brought in midst floating shrimps.
On this the master says, " this fish was caught," says he, "before it spawned, after it spawned 'twould be inferior in the flesh."
The sauce is mixed with three ingredients,-with oil which Venafrum's first pressing gave:
with caviar, from Spanish mackerel made, with wine of five years old, but grown this side the sea,1 while it still boils;
—the boiling done, the Chian suits it so as none besides:
pepper add and vinegar made from Methymna's grapes when sour.
'Twas I that first showed how to boil in it green rockets with elecampane of better juice.
Curtillus proposed unwashed sea-urchins, as something better than the shell-fish yields.
Meantime the curtain-awning fell in a heap upon the dish, and brought more grimy dust than North wind raises on Campania's plains.
We feared some greater ill, but when we saw the danger past, our spirits rose.
Rufus with drooping head wept as if a son had died before his day.
What the upshot would have been (I know not) had not Nomentanus with ready tact thus cheered his friend.
" Ah!
Fortune, what deity is more unkind to us than you?
How you always take delight in making sport of human things!"
Varius could scarce contain his laughter with his napkin in his mouth.
Balatro, who sneers at everything, then said, such is the lot of life:
and so your fame will ne'er reward your toil.
To think that you should thus be racked by every care, that I may sumptuously dine:
to see the bread's not burned, the sauce not served ill-seasoned, that all the slaves attend well dressed and brushed.
Add besides mischances such as these, if the curtains tumble down as they have done just now:
if a groom should slip his foot and break a dish.
But the misfortunes of a host, as of a leader, are wont to call his genius forth, prosperity, to hide it.
Then said Nasi­ dienus in reply :
"
May the gods bestow on you all blessings which you ask:
so kind a man you are, and such a courteous guest."
Then he calls for his slippers.
And now on every couch you could observe how whispers buzzed about, breathed secretly in every ear.
HOR.
No play should I have rather seen than that.
But tell me, pray, those things which afterwards afforded mirth.
FUND.
Whilst Vibidius asked the slave if the flagon had been broken too, because no cups were given him when he called, and whilst we laugh on false pretexts, with Balatro as second,1 Nasidienus, you return with altered brow, mean­ ing to amend ill-luck by skill:
then followed slaves who carried on an ample tray the limbs of a crane, carved up and sprinkled well with salt and meal:
the liver too of a goose, all white, fattened on juicy figs, and wings of hares torn off, as sweeter far, than if one ate them with the loins;
next we beheld some blackbirds served, with breasts quite scorched, and pigeons with no rumps, all nice enough, if the host would only leave untold the cause, and nature of the things.
Him we thus took vengeance on and fled, that not an article we touched, as if on them Canidia, more fell than Afric snakes, had blown with tainted breath.
The Epistles are universally acknowledged to be the most perfect in diction, in metre, in style, and in polish, of all the writings of Horace.
Most of them, if not all, were written, it would seem, in his more mature years when his great practice in composition had prepared him for his highest effort.
The train of thought is that of a refined and educated man, conscious of his powers, and not afraid to declare his opinions, and submit them to the judgment of the world.
The Epistles abound in excellent matter, and are especially conspicuous for their high moral tone.
They have been called 11 the poetry of manner and society," and justly so.
They treat of difficult social and personal affairs with rare discrimination and consummate tact, and give token of greater seriousness and calmer reflection in coming to conclusions than his other works afford.
One sees throughout them the same Horatian characteristics as have been met with in the Odes, the Epodes, and the Satires­ his patriotism, his love of the country, his admiration of virtue, and his detestation of all that is mean, ignoble, or snobbish;
his advocacy of moderation in all things, and his condemnation of the follies, the extravagance, and the lusts and luxuries of his day, are clearly read between the lines" in his Epistles.
These Epistles are not Satires, but they serve an equally good purpose.
It has been said that while the Satires show what is wrong, the Epistles teach what is right.
Thus they are, in one sense, a continuation and a filling out of the Satires, but are more concerned with individual men, and special subjects and incidents.
The masculine good sense which is found in the Satires makes itself as conspicuous in the Epistles, and renders them as instructive and as appreciable to the reader of to-day as if they were written by a modern author not far removed from our times.
In fact, they are human and cosmopolitan.
They are more free than the Satires from obscure allusions, and their teaching goes at once to the understanding and the heart.
The poet is the same " dear old Horace " with whom, after two thousand years have held his ashes in the urn, we still can chat, and laugh, and sometimes almost weep with him in his more pathetic moods.
Horace had a soul for man, his joys, his cares, his woes.
His motto seems to have been—“
Homo sum ;
nil humani a me alienum puto.
”The term Epistulæ is not one given by the poet himself, though he uses the word once, Book II., ii, 22.
He ranks the so-called Epistulæ among his Sermones, or Prosaic poetry.
These, as was said of the Satires, are chatty, gossipy notes on men and things in a light, friendly, con­ versational style, such as a letter of the present day might exhibit.
In some cases they are letters proper, such as XV., in which the poet asks a friend as to the merits of some health-resorts;
No. V. is simply an invitation to dinner;
IX.
a letter of introduction for Septimius to Tiberius Nero;
XIV.
remonstrates with his steward at the Sabine farm in regard to his discontent with country life.
Some of them have a good deal of the Satiric in them, and some of them a touch of irony, but all of them display much of that bonhomie which marked Horace in all his dealings with his fellow man.
In the Epistles, more than in the Satires, Horace charms our imagination and wins our affec­ tions.
When he makes any reference to the faults or weak­ nesses of friends, he does it with a delicate good humour, full of sympathy and tenderness of feeling.
In the Second Book of the Epistles, the subjects are not moral and social, but literary and critical.
In the First, addressed to the Emperor Augustus, the author defends the Classical School of Latin Poetry," combats the idea that age and not real excellence should be the test of poetry, and predicts with confidence that in process of time the national literature would, slowly perhaps but certainly, attain the highest name.
The Second Epistle, to Florus, gives the poet's reasons for abandoning Lyric Composition.
The Third and most famous of these Literary Epistles is that addressed to the Pisos.
It is not known who gave it the title of " Ars Poetica ”—certainly not Horace himself.
Probably it was one of the Scholiasts or one of the early grammarians.
It was evidently not intended as a complete Treatise on the Art of Poetry, but simply as a friendly letter to Piso and his two sons, the elder of whom, it is supposed, was about to venture on the publication of some poetry he had composed.
Horace's " Ars Poetica " simply gives a brief sketch of the Greek Drama, and states the principles of criticism which should be applied to it.
It accords well in subject and treatment with the two Epistles which precede it.
Horace's remarks on some questions of an aesthetic character are marked by his usual independence of judgment and sound common sense.

THE POET'S REASONS FOR ABANDON­ ING LYRIC POETRY.
Theme of my earliest muse, theme worthiest of my last, you seek, Maecenas, to shut me up again within my former school,1 though I've been well approved, and already gifted with the foil.
2
My age is not what once it was, my inclina­ tion's gone.
Veianius to the temple door of great Alcides 3 nails his arms, and in the country hides himself from sight, lest from the margin of the sand he so often need to beg the people for discharge.
4
I have a monitor who of times rings it in my well rinsed ear—“
Unyoke in time, if you are wise, the steed now growing old, lest at the last he fail midst jeers, and strain his panting flanks."
1 So now I lay aside my verses and my other toys, and only study and enquire what's true in morals, what is fit, and in this I'm all en­ grossed :
I treasure up and duly range what, later on, I may bring forth for use.
And lest you ask beneath what chief, within what hornet I shelter seek,-to no one master do I fealty swear, but where'er the stress of weather drives me, there do I land and claim the rights of guest.
Now I become a man of action, and plunge in the waves of civil strife, true virtue's rigid and attendant guard.
Again the creed of Aristippus I stealthily embrace, and strive to subjugate all things to me, not me to things.
As the night seems long to him whose lover breaks her tryst-as the day seems long to him whose task is over­ due, and as the year goes slowly by to minors curbed by mothers' watchful care, just so the seasons move to me, tardy and irksome, which delay the hope and the intent of pur­ suing with an eager zeal what benefits the rich and poor alike, and the neglect of which will harm alike the old and young.
Then what remains is this, that by these Elements I regulate my life, and comfort seek.
With your eye you may not strain far as famed Lynceus could, but you'd not on that account neglect to salve your eyes when they are sore :
nor because you cannot hope for limbs like matchless Glycon's, would you neglect to guard your body from the knotty gout.
Up to a certain point you may advance, even if you cannot farther go.
Perhaps your mind is fevered by a greed of wealth or other miserable wish;
—in that case there are words and spells by which you can assuage that pain, and put away much of your disease.
If you're puffed up with love of fame, there are unfailing remedies which will restore you to a proper state, if you will only read the formulae three times with pure intent.
Be you jealous, irritable, given to sloth, to wine or love, no one is so savage that he can't be tamed, if he will only lend to culture an attentive ear.
In virtue 'tis the earliest step to keep from vice-in wisdom, to get quit of folly.
You see with what a pain of mind and risk of life you shun those evils which you think the chief-a stinted purse and base defeat.
You hasten with your merchandise to India's furthest bounds, fleeing from poverty o'er seas, o'er rocks, through fires,1—then wont you learn and listen with belief to better men, to save you from a care for that which now you foolishly admire and wish.
What athlete in the hamlets and the streets would fail to accept the great Olympic wreath, had he the hope, had he the offer, of the tempting palm without the dusty strife ?
Silver is less worth than gold, gold than virtue.
Citizens, O citizens, money must first be got;
after money, virtue.
This first and foremost rule Janus from end to end 2 pro­ claims :
this lesson boys repeat, and old men too, with slate and satchel o'er the left arm slung.
You've mental gifts, suppose, good character, and elo­ quence and name3—of the four hundred thousand4 which you need, you lack but six or seven,-then you'll still be a plebeian as you were.
But boys in play say thus—“ If you do right, you shall be king."
Ever be this your wall of brass.
“To keep a heart that knows no guile, a cheek no crime may pale.
”Which, then, pray tell me, is the better guide-the law of Roscius, or the children's rhyme which offers power to those who do " the right," chanted from age to age by such as Curius and Camillus, those men of mighty soul ?
Is his advice more sound who says, make money, make money, rightly if you can ;
if not, make money any way at all, that from a nearer point you may get a better view of Pupius' doleful plays;
or his who with an ever ready help exhorts and braces you to face proud Fortune's frowns like one who's free and holds his head erect ?
But if, perchance, the Roman people ask, why as I walk their porticos, I don't adopt their views, and neither follow nor avoid what they approve or hate, I will repeat what once the wary fox said to the lion in his feeble state;
" because those footprints frighten me, all looking towards you, but ne'er a one looks back again."
You are a mon­ strous beast of many heads.
For what shall I follow or whom obey ?
Some take delight to farm all public jobs,1 and some there are who hunt for greedy widows with tit bits 2 and with fruit, and catch old men to put in their preserves.
For many money grows by usury kept hid.
But be it so that different men are occupied by different pursuits and tastes, can the same man continue for an hour to have the same delight?
Suppose the rich man says, " No bay in all the world excels the charming Baiæ,” at once the lake and sea feel to their cost the ardour of the im­ patient lord ;
but if some silly whim should give a hint, to- morrow, workmen, to Teanum you shall move your tools.
If the marriage bed is in his hall, he says there's nought before, nought better than unwedded life :
if it's not, he swears that married men alone are blessed.
By what a knot shall I restrain this ever changing Proteus ?
What of the poor man ?
Have your laugh :
he changes garrets, beds and baths and barbers, and in his hired boat gets as sick as does the wealthy man who sails his private yacht.
Should I meet you with my hair just trimmed, the barber being uneven in his work, you laugh:
if it happen that a threadbare shirt is seen beneath a tunic with the nap still fresh, or if my toga sits upon me all awry, you laugh.
What do you do when my judgment wars against itself, now spurns what it has sought, then seeks again what it has lately left, sways to and fro, and is inconsistent through the whole tenor of my life;
pulls down, builds up, changes square for round and round for square?
You think I have just a common craze and so you do not laugh, nor do you think I need a doctor, nor a guardian, by the prætor named, though you take charge of my affairs, and are offended by the ill-pared nail of one who leans upon you, and regards you with respect.
To sum up:
the wise man is inferior to Jove alone, he's rich and free, honoured and handsome, and in a word he's king of kings :
and above all, he's sound,1 unless it be when phlegm is troublesome.
Dear Lollius Maximus,1 while you at Rome the art of speaking learn, at Praeneste I have read once more the poet of the Trojan war :
who shows more clearly and with more effect than Crantor and Chrysippus do, what's noble, what is base, what's useful, and what's not.
Why I believe so, hear me, unless some pressing business prevents you.
The story which relates how, all for Paris' love, Greece engaged in tedious war against barbarian hosts, sets forth the passion-tides of foolish kings and nations too.
An tenor wishes to cut short the cause of war :
but what says Paris ?
He declares he can't be forced, even though the terms should be a peaceful reign and happy life.
Nestor is eager to com­ pose the strife between Achilles and the son of Atreus.
Love stirs the one, and anger, both in common.
What­ ever follies kings commit the people 2 suffer for the fault:
by broils, by craft, by crimes, by lust and wrath, both in and beyond the walls of Troy they go astray.
Again, to show what manly spirit, and what wisdom can effect, he has given Ulysses as a worthy type, who after Troy's o'erthrow with wise intent explored the cities and the ways of many men, and while for his comrades and himself he seeks a safe return over the spacious sea, bore many hardships, not to be swamped in Fortune's adverse waves.
Of Siren songs and Circe's cups you know, for if in foolish greediness he like his friends had drunk of these, he would have been debased and void of soul under a wanton queen;
he would have lived like filthy dog or sow that loves the mire.
We are mere numbers,1 born to consume the fruits of earth, suitors of Penelope, worthless courtiers of Alcinous, too much given o'er to pamper and make sleek the flesh, who thought good to sleep till noon, and to lull their care to rest by the lyre's dulcet sounds.
Robbers rise up while still 'tis night to slay a man:
will you then not bestir yourself to save your life ?
Yet if you will not when you're well, you shall run when dropsy comes:
and unless you ask before the dawn your book and light, unless you give your mind to noble studies and pursuits, you will lie awake, tortured by jealousy or love.
For why are you eager to remove those things that hurt your eyes, if you for a year defer the cure of that which gnaws your mind ? "
Well begun is half ended."
Dare to be wise, begin.
He who puts off the time of guiding life aright, waits like the rustic till the stream runs by;
but it still runs, and as it runs, for ever will run on.
We seek for money, and a wife fruitful in bearing sons, and by the plough we tame the woodlands wild :
let him who has what serves his turn desire nothing more.
Nor house nor policies, nor heaps of gold and brass, are wont to drive the fever from the owner's sickly frame, nor from his mind its cares.
The owner must be strong and well if he means with comfort to enjoy his treasured wealth.
The man who's pressed by greed or dread,2 his house and farm delight no more than pictures do the purblind, or heated cloths the gout, or harp the stuffed up ears.
Unless the vessel's pure and clean, whatever you pour in turns foul.
Spurn pleasures :
pleasure gained by pain is hurtful.
The miser is always in a state of need:
find a fixed limit for your wish.
The envious grow lean at sight of others' wealth.
No torture greater than envy did Sicilian tyrants find.
He who will not passion check shall wish that that had ne'er been done which his vexation and his temper bid, while he hastens to avenge by force a grudge still unappeased.
Anger is a brief madness :
check your temper, which if not ruled, will sternly rule.
Hold it hard in with bit and rein.
The trainer moulds the colt, docile with tender neck, to go the way his rider guides :
the hound, in training ever since in the yard he bayed the deer's stuffed hide, at length sees service in the woods.
Now in boyhood when the heart is pure drink in my words, and now entrust yourself to wiser men.
The jar will long retain the scent with which 'twas first imbued.
But if you loiter or go too fast in front, I neither wait for laggards nor pursue those hurrying on.
Julius Florus, I am anxious to know in what regions of the globe Claudius, step-son of Augustus, is now employed in waging war.
Does
Thrace detain you, and Hebrus, bound by icy shackle, or the seas that run between the neighbouring towers,1 or the rich plains and hills of Asia ?
What literary labours does the learned suite devise ?
This too I wish to know.
Who undertakes to write great Cæsar's deeds ?
Who transmits to distant years his treaties and his wars ?
What's Titius about, so soon to come before the Roman world?
who has not feared to drink from the Pindaric spring, daring to spurn the lakes and open streams.
How is he ?
Has he a thought for me ?
Does he purpose, under guidance of the Muse, to suit to the Latin lyre the strains of Thebes ?
or does he storm and swell and soar!
in tragic style ?
And how's friend Celsus, tell me ?
warned and often to be warned, to employ his own rich stores and not to touch the books which Palatine Apollo has received, lest if perchance a flock of birds should one day come to seek their plumes, the jackdaw should provoke derision, stripped of his stolen hues.
What do you yourself attempt ?
Over what beds of thyme do you now flit with nimble wing ?
"Not small your wit, nor rugged, and unkempt."
Whether you train yourself for pleading suits, or mean to expound the civil law, or to com­ pose a charming strain, you shall carry off first honours of the ivy wreath which crowns the victor.
But could you only lay aside the chilling remedies1 of care, you would reach the heights where heavenly wisdom led.
This task,2 this aim, let all of us, both high and low, with eager­ ness pursue, if we wish to pass through life, loved by our country, loved by ourselves.
This, too, in your reply you ought to say, whether Munatius is as dear to you as it is right he should.
Does your friend­ ship, ill patched-up, refuse to heal, and asunder burst once more, and does the heat of blood or ignorance of life chafe you, both headstrong with your necks untamed.
Where'er you live, too good to break the bond of brotherhood, a votive steer is now being fed, to grace your coming.
Albius, candid judge of my prosaic muse, what shall I say that you're about in Pedum's rural bounds ?
That you are writ­ ing what may surpass the little 1 works of Cassius of Parma ?
Or, is it that you stroll in silent thought among the healthful woods, attending to whatever becomes the wise and upright man ?
You were not in olden days a body void of soul.
The gods have given you beauty, wealth enough, and skill to enjoy it.
What could kind nurse wish more for darling child who can already think, and tell its thoughts, and has, in plenty, favour, fame, and health, and well kept table, and a purse that never fails ?
Midst hopes and anxious thoughts, midst fears and keen regrets,2 think that each day has dawned for you the last;
the hour you don't expect will come with glad surprise.
Me, when you wish a laugh, you'll find both fat and sleek, with well cared hide, a very hog from Epicurus' sty.
If on an Archias'1 couch you can recline and not object to eat of omne olus2 from a modest plate, I shall expect you, dear Torquatus, at the setting of the sun.
You shall have wine to drink, drawn off in second consulship of Taurus, be­ tween Minturnae's fens and heights of Petrinus, in Sinu­ essa's bounds.
If you have better, send for it, or bear my lordship of the feast.
For you the hearth long since is polished bright, and furniture made clean and neat.
Dis­ miss vain hopes and rivalry for wealth, and Moschus' suit:
to-morrow, Caesar's birth-day feast, gives licence and a longer sleep :
the summer night we safely can prolong by friendly talk in plenty.
Of what avail to me are Fortune's gifts if I can't enjoy their use ?
He who is stingy on an heir's account, and niggard overmuch, is to a madman close allied.
I shall begin to drink and scatter flowers;
3 and shall consent to be esteemed a madcap.
What strange things does not drink effect?
It discloses secret thoughts, bids hopes be firm, impels the coward to the fight, takes off the load from minds distressed, and " teaches arts unknown."
Whom have inspiring cups not rendered eloquent ?
whom have they not set free from care midst pinch of poverty ?
I charge myself with this, being fit and nowise loath, to see that covers1 are not soiled, that napkins in a filthy state shall not offend the nose, that the tankard and the dish fail not to " serve as mirror while you sup," that among trusty friends there be not found a man to tell tales out of doors, that like may meet with like, and equal be with equal paired.
To meet you I shall Butra ask, Septicius too, and Sabinus, if a better feast detain him not, and a sweet-heart better still;
there is also room for extra guests :
but when a party's closely packed, a flock of goats seem nearer than you'd like.

Say in reply how many you wish asked and, business left, escape by the back, and shun the client who is waiting in the hall.
To overvalue nothing is well-nigh the one and only thing, Numicius, to make a mortal happy and to keep him so.
Some men regard, without a tinge of fear, yon sun, the planets, and the seasons, that with unerring movements pass.
What think you of the gifts of earth, what of those of ocean which make the far-off Arab and the Indian rich ?
What think you of the shows and games, the plaudits, and the honours by the friendly Romans given?
How must they be regarded­ with what feelings, think you, in what light?
He that fears the opposite of these,1 values them almost as much as he who seeks the things themselves:
in both2 the " flutter of excitement" is the thing that pains, so soon as an unlooked-for sight amazes one or other.
Whether he rejoice or grieve, desire or fear, what matters it, if with eyes intent he's paralysed in body and in mind, when what he sees is better than he hoped, or worse ?
Let the wise man bear the name of fool, the just of the unjust, if he seeks even Virtue's self beyond due bounds.
Go now, admire old silver plate, old marble statues too, bronzes and works of art, and gems and Tyrian hues :
rejoice because a thousand eyes gaze on you while you speak;
in the morning to the Forum hie with active step, and late at evening to your home, lest from his dowry-fields Mutus should reap more gain and (what's a shame, for he has come of meaner stock), lest he be more admired by you than you by him.
Whatever's hid beneath the earth time will bring forth to light;
and will hide and bury underground what now is bright and fresh.
Although Agrippa's colonnade has seen your well-known form, and the via Appia, too, still it remains for you to go where Numa and where Ancus have already gone.
If your side or kidneys suffer from a sharp attack, seek to escape the malady.
You wish to guide your life aright;
who does not ?
If Virtue only can this boon bestow, leave off your fancies, like a man, and give your strength to that.
You think that Virtue's merely words :
a sacred grove but logs;
see then that no one takes the port before you, lest you lose your trade at Cibyra and in Bithynian marts.
Let a good round thousand talents be obtained, and then a thousand more, and farther let a third succeed, and that which squares the heap.
Of course Queen Money gives a man a downed wife, and credit too, and friends, and lofty birth and handsome form, and Venus and Per­ suasion join to deck well-moneyed men.
The Cappadocian king, though rich in slaves, is poor in coin ;
see that you be not such.
Lucullus, as 'tis said, being asked if for the stage he could supply a hundred cloaks, replied, " How could I give so many?
but I will look and send as many as I have."
A little afterwards he writes that at home he has five thousand cloaks-let him take a part or all.
That house is ill supplied, in which there are not many things too much, which escape the owner's eye and only benefit the thieves.
Therefore, if wealth alone can make and keep a mortal happy, be first to seek this task, again and then again, the last to give it over.
If show and popularity alone afford true blessedness,2 let us hire a slave to tell us names, to nudge us on the left, and force us to stretch forth a hand to shake beyond all obstacles.

"This one can use much influence in the Fabian tribe:
that one in the Veline:
this third with dogged obstinacy2 will give or take away the fasces and the curule chair from whom he will."
Add “Father,” “Brother”;
as is the age of each, so blandly count him of your kin.
If he who dines well, lives well, let us start at dawn 8 where palate guides;
let us fish and hunt, as did Gargilius of old, who bade that in the morning all his slaves, with nets and spears, should cross the crowded forum and the throng, so that a single mule might in the people's sight bear back a purchased boar.
Dyspeptic and swollen let us go to bathe, forgetting what is seemly, what is not, worthy of Caere's register,4 a sin-debased and worthless crew of Ithacan Ulysses, to whom forbidden pleasure was dearer than their native land.
If, as Mimnermus thinks, there's nought enjoyable, unless with love and mirth, then spend your years in love and mirth.
Long life I wish you, and, farewell.
If you know any rules to beat the precepts I have given, candidly impart them;
if not, use these as I shall do.
Though I promised you to spend five days, not more, within my country home, false to my word, I've stayed away all through the month of August.
And yet if you desire that I should live in mind and body sound, you will give me, fearing to be sick, the same indulgence as when truly sick, while now the early fig and sultry heats deck out the undertaker with attendants clad in black, while every father and fond mother trembles for their sons;
and when the courtesies which duty calls, and Forum-work bring fever on, and break the seals of wills.
But when the winter scatters snows over the Alban heights, your bard will to the seaside hie, and of his health take care, and in retirement 1 will read and write;
you, dear friend, he'll see again, if you permit, when zephyrs blow, and when the swallows come.
You have not made me rich, as rustic 2 host invites a guest to eat his pears :
—H.
Eat I pray you.G. I have now enough.H.
But take away as many as you wish.G.
You're very kind.
3H.
You will take them home, and find them very welcome to your little boys.
G.
By your gift I am as much obliged as if I departed with a load.
H.
Well, just as you like, you will leave them for the pigs to eat to-day.
The man who's lavish and devoid of sense gives readily away what he himself dislikes and spurns:
land tilled like that has borne, and evermore will bear, nought but ungrate­ ful plants.
He that is liberal and discreet says he is ready to assist the men of worth, and yet he knows full well what difference there is 'tween coins and lupines.
To match my benefactor's fame I'll prove my worthiness.
1But if you do not wish that I go anywhere away from Rome, you must give back my healthy chest, replace black locks upon my narrow brow, restore my pleasant voice, my winning smile, and spirit to lament the flight of playful Cinara amidst our wine.
In happened that a tiny fox had crept by a narrow chink into a bin of corn, and having freely fed was vainly striving to get out again when full;
to which a weasel close at hand thus spoke :
"If you would escape from there," says she, seek when you're lank the narrow rent by which when lank you came."
If this is aimed at me, I everything resign;
sated with dainties to the full, I neither praise the people's sleep, nor do I change for wealth of Araby my leisure, free as air.
You often praised my modesty, and to your face you have been called by me my patron and my sire, and not one whit less sparingly behind your back.
See then if I can lay down contentedly all you have bestowed.
Not badly did Telemachus, much-tried Ulysses' son, reply:
" Ithaca is not a place for horses fit, as neither has it ample plains nor large supplies of grass:
with thanks, Atrides, I shall leave your gifts, more fitted for yourself."
Small things become the small;
'tis not Imperial Rome, but quiet Tibur, and soft Tarentum's bay, that please me now.
Philip, a man of energy and purpose firm, and as a pleader famed, when from his duties he returns one day at two o'clock, and as his years advance, complains that Carinæ is from the Courts too far removed, espied, they say, a man close shaven in a barber's empty stall, who pared his nails, quite at his ease, with penknife of his own.
" Demetrius- (this slave received his master's orders in no careless way),— go, ask and bring me word what is his native country, what his name, and rank of life, who is his father, who his patron."
He goes, returns, and tells that his name's Volteius Mena, an auctioneer, in income limited, of blameless char­ acter, known to be active at the proper time, and also to relax, to acquire means and spend them too, taking pleasure in his humble friends, and in his home, fond of the Circus, and of the Campus when his duty's done.
"I should like to ask the man himself all that you say :
tell him to come and dine."
Mena could not quite believe it, he wondered inwardly but did not speak.
Why enlarge?
"No, thank you," he replies.
"Is he to refuse me?" "The wretch refuses, and either slights or dreads you."
Next morning Philip comes on Volteius unawares, when selling odds and ends to the rabble of the blouse-clad plebs, and surprises him by saying first, "good day."
The other offered as excuse his heavy work and duties of a hired clerk, because he had not paid his morning call, and because he had not seen him first. "
Consider that I pardon you on condition that you come to dine with me to-day."
" As you please."
"Then come at three o'clock.
Now go;
with all your zeal increase your means.
"When he came to dinner, he talked on every subject, wise and not, and at length goes home to bed.
When he was often seen to hasten down, as fish to hidden hook, a morn­ ing client and a never-failing guest, he is bidden to attend his patron to his country seat during the Latin Feriæ.
Once in the carriage set, he ceases not to praise the Sabine country and the Sabine air.
Philip sees and smiles, and while he seeks respite from care, for mirth from every source, and while he gives him seven sestertia as a gift, and offers seven more on loan, he leads him on to buy a farm.
He buys it.
Not to weary you overmuch with tedious details,—from a spruce citizen he turns a rustic, and talks of nothing else but of his furrows and his groves of vines :
he makes elms ready to receive his plants :
he kills himself with eagerness, and ages fast through love of gain.
But when his sheep are stolen by thieves, his she-goats die of plague, his crops belie his hopes, his oxen are quite killed with work, staggered by his loss, when midnight's past, he quietly takes out his horse and in ill-humour 1 hastens to his patron's house.
And soon as Philip saw him squalid and untrimmed, he says:
"Volteius, you seem to me too hard a worker, and too intent on gain." " By Pollux, patron, you would call me I wretched man,' if you wished to give my proper name.
But by your genius and your faith, and by the household gods, I adjure and beg you to restore me to my former life.
"He who once has seen how much pursuits left off excel those keenly sought, let him retrace his steps in time, and seek again the things he left.
'Tis only right that each should gauge himself by his own rule and foot.
I ask you, muse, to wish much joy for me, and much success to Celsus Albinovanus, secretary and bosom friend of Nero.
If he asks what I'm about, say that while I make many and most wise resolves, yet still I live neither a perfect life, nor one to please myself;
not that the hail has lashed my vines, and that the fiery heat has nipped my olive groves, nor that my herds pine with disease in pastures far away;
but because less healthy in my mind than in my frame, I've no desire to hear or learn what may relieve me, sick at heart;
that with my trusty doctors I'm displeased, am angry with my friends because they haste to save me from the fatal sloth;
because I follow what does harm, and shun what I might think would do me good;
because with fickle will, at Rome I long for Tibur, and at Tibur long for Rome.
Then ask him how he is in health, how with his duty he gets on and with his own affairs, how stands he with the youthful prince, and how with all his staff.
If he shall say, " All Right," first wish him joy, and don't forget to drop in both his ears the warning note, just as you bear your fortune, Celsus, even so shall we bear you.
Claudius, no doubt Septimius understands, as no one else, how high I am in your esteem.
For when he asks and urges me with earnest prayer that I should recommend and introduce him to you as worthy of a Nero's character and household who chooses all that's honourable;
when he thinks I act the part of dearest friend, he sees and knows much better than myself what power I have.
On my part I gave him many reasons why I should get off and be excused;
but I feared that he should think I feigned my influence less, concealing my own power, and reserving it to benefit myself alone.
So in my wish to shun the greater fault, I have stooped to claim the privilege of city forward­ ness.
But if you think it right that modesty be laid aside at bidding of a friend, enrol him in your suite, and believe me he's a manly, honest fellow.
A lover of the country I salute our Fuscus, a lover of the town, differing far, no doubt, in this one point, but in every other almost twins ;
-with brotherly affection, what one denies the other too denies, — we nod assent together, like old and well-known doves.
You hug the nest:
I like the streams and moss-grown rocks and woods of the delightful country.
What seek you more?
I life enjoy, and am a king, so soon as I have left those things which you extol to heaven with favouring acclaim:
and like priest's deserting slave, sweet wafers I reject;
plain bread I want far better than your honeyed cakes.
If we must live conformably to nature's wish, and if a site must first be sought whereon to plant a house, do you know a place that's better than the country, blessed resort ?
Is there a place where winter is more mild, where a more grateful breeze tempers the Dog Star's rage and Lion's scorching days, when once he has received the piercing sun with madding sting ?
Is there a place where envious care is less diposed to break our sleep ?
Does the sward smell worse, or show less bright, than Libyan floors?
1 Does water of a purer vein strive in the streets to burst the lead, than that which hurries down its sloping bed with babbling noise ?
No doubt a grove is reared with care midst columns of a varied hue, and a house is highly prized which looks both far and wide into the fields.
Turn Nature with a pitchfork out, still she will ever come again, unseen, will dissipate all perverse taste-victor at last.
He who knows not how to compare with cunning skill, Sidonian purple and the fleece which drinks Aquinum's dye, shall not receive a loss more certain and more deeply felt, than he who cannot sever false from true.
Him whom prosperity delights too much by far, a change of Fortune will completely crush:
whatever you highly prize you will be loath to lay aside.
Avoid things grand :
although you live beneath a humble roof, you may outstrip in joys of life both kings and friends of kings.
A stag prevailing in the fight oft from their common pastures drove the horse, till the latter worsted in the tedious strife, called in the help of man and took the bridle rein, but when the victor now violent, of his foe got quit, he did not cast the rider from his back nor from his mouth the bit.
So whoe'er in dread of poverty parts with his freedom, better far than mines of gold, carries a master on his back for his persistent greed, and shall for ever be a slave because he'll never learn to do with little.
If each man's means don't suit his state, like the shoe of old, they'll trip him up, if overlarge, and pinch him if too small.
Aristius, like a wise man you will live, I know, contented with your lot, and will not let me off without rebuke, if I shall seem to hoard more than enough, and take no rest.
Gold amassed is lord or slave of each, worthy to follow, rather than to lead, the twisted rope.
These thing I jotted down behind Vacuna's mouldering fane, happy in all else save that you were not there.
Bullatius, what did you think of Chios, and of Lesbos known to fame?
What of Samos "trim and trig"?
What of Sardis, Croesus' royal town?
What of Smyrna and of Colophon?
Are they over or below1 their great repute?
Are they all inferior in your eyes to the Campus and to Tiber's stream ?
Does one of the towns of Attalus better suit your taste, or do you Lebedus commend, through dis­ like of travelling by sea and land ?
BULLATIUS.
—You know what sort of place is Lebedus,— a village more lone than Gabii or Fidenæ:
still, there I'd gladly spend my days, forgetting friends, of friends forgot, to view from shore old Neptune raging in storm far out to sea.
HOR.
—But neither will he who goes from Capua to Rome, though drenched, and splashed with mud, care in a tavern to live, nor does the man when chilled to the heart, commend the bakehouse and the bath as affording to the full a life of bliss.
So, neither if strong Austers' blast has tossed you on the deep, would you on that account sell off your ship beyond Ægean seas.
To one who's free from ills, Rhodes and Mitylene fair serve as a greatcoat in the summer's height, as running drawers in the frosty winds, as a Tiber-bath in winter time, a fire in August heats.
Whilst you can, and whilst Fortune wears a pleasant face, at Rome let Samos, Rhodes, and Chios have your praise, when far away.
Whatever time the Deity in favour grants, take you with grateful hand, and don't for a year defer the sweets of life, so that wherever you be, you still can say you've passed a pleasant time, for if reflection and good sense remove our cares, and not a place which dominates a wide expanse of main, they change the climate, not the mind, who hasten over sea.
An "active inactivity" keeps us employed:
in ships and cars we try to spend a happy life.
What you're looking for is here, it's at Ulubrae even, if a mind well balanced fails you not.
Iccius, if you use aright Agrippa's revenues which you collect in Sicily, it is not possible that a greater plenty can be given you by Jove himself.
Away with your frets, for he's not poor who has the full use of property.
1
If you are well in stomach, chest, and feet, princely wealth can give you nothing more.
If perchance in midst of dishes served you live abstemiously on potherbs and on nettles,2 so will you live right on, though Fortune's stream should straightway flow for you in gold :
either because riches cannot our nature change, or that you think all else inferior to virtue.
We wonder that his cattle browse on fields of Democritus and on his crops, while his mind, swift in its thoughts, is far abroad without the body, though you, amidst the itch and taint of gain, have tastes for nothing small, and still engage in lofty thoughts;
—what causes ocean's flow, what regulates the year, whether the stars stray from their path and roam at will or under law, what hides the moon in darkness, what brings her orb to view again, what is the purpose, what the effect, of the harmonious discord of the world;
whether Empedocles is wrong, or Stertinius of subtle mind.
But whether you eat fish or slaughter3 leeks and onions, take Grosphus as a friend, and whatever he asks grant readily:
Grosphus will seek nothing but what is right and fair.
The price of friends is cheap when good men some­ thing need.
1But that you may know in what state matters are at Rome, the Cantabri have fallen by Agrippa's might, the Armenians by that of Claudius Nero:
Phraates on his bended knee has owned the imperial sway of Cæsar:
golden Plenty pours rich crops on Italy from teeming horn.
Vinius, as I told you oft and long, at setting out, you will give my volumes to Augustus with seals secure,—if he's in good health and in a cheery mood, and, in a word, if he should ask them:
lest through your love for me you go too far and gain for my books ill-will, and in excessive zeal prove by far too keen a "help."
If perchance the heavy burden of my scrolls should chafe or gall you, rather fling it from you on the way than in temper dash down your pack at the appointed place, and turn your father's name of Asina into a joke, and be the public talk.
Hold on with all your might o'er hills and streams and fens.
When you have gained your object, and reached your journey's end, you will keep your burden so disposed that you may not haply seem to carry books beneath your arm, as a rustic does a lamb, as tippling Pyrrhia smuggles balls of stolen wool, as tribesman-guest conveys his slippers and felt hat.
Don't be telling all the world that you have sweated carrying some poems which may please the eyes and ears of Caesar;
—and now I pray you earnestly, push on and do your best.
Go, good-bye:
see that you do not trip, and break what's in your chargedSteward of my woodlands, and of my farm that makes me myself again, which you despise though it supports five yeomen and their homes, and sends to Varia five good and trusty councillors, let us try whether I from my mind, or you from the land, shall sooner1 pluck the prickly weeds;
and whether Horace or his fields be found in better trim.
Although my love and deep concern for Lamia, wailing his brother, keeps me here-for Lamia who grieves for a brother's sudden death, and will not be consoled-yet every feeling of my mind leads me strongly to that spot, and longs to burst the obstacles that bar the open way.
I call him happy who in the country lives, you him who dwells in town.
He who seeks another's lot of course dislikes his own.
Both in their folly wrongly blame the place, though free of blame:
the fault is in the mind which never from itself can fly.
You when a common drudge begged for the fields in silent prayer-now when a steward you prefer the town, the games, the baths.
You know that I'm con­ sistent, and that I go with heavy heart when any hated business drags me off to Rome.
Our tastes are not the same, and thus a difference exists between us, for what you con­ sider desert and inhospitable wilds, he who agrees with me deems charming haunts, and hates what you think fine.
The stews and greasy cook-shops give you a taste for town, I see, because that nook of mine will yield me spice and pepper sooner than grapes, and because no tavern is near which can supply your wine, nor any wanton flutist to whose music you may jump and stamp, on earth a bur­ den ;
and yet1 you're ever at the fields, now for a length of time untouched by any hoes, and tend the ox unyoked, and feed him with the leaves you've newly stript.
Should rain come down, the river gives you work, if you are lazy, for it must be taught by many a dyke to spare the sunny meads.
Come now and hear what mars our harmony.
Me whom fine2 togas once became and well-dressed locks, who, you know, without a gift was loved by grasping Cinara, whom, used to drink of clear Falernian from early afternoon, a simple meal now satisfies, and sleep on my streamlet's grassy bank.
I'm not ashamed I've had my sports, but that I do not bring them to an end.
There no one mars my comforts with an evil eye, and no one poisons with hidden venom or malicious bite.
My neighbours smile to see me as I turn the soil and move the stones.
You prefer to eat your city rations with the slaves:
in your wish you haste to join them:
the cunning city drudge envies you the use of gardens, logs, and flocks.
The ox for trappings longs, the nag desires to plough.
I advise that each should ply the art he knows, and be content.
Pray tell me,1 Vala, what sort of winter Velia has, what climate has Salemum, what kind are the inhabitants, and what the road is like:
Antonius Musa, I may say, declares that Baiæ's useless for my case, and yet he makes me hated by the people there, since I'm to bathe in water, cold, not warm, through winter's frosts.
The town laments, forsooth, its myrtle groves deserted, and vapour baths despised, though said to banish from the nerves the malady still lingering there, angry at patients who venture to expose the head and body to the Clusine springs, and hie to Gabii and cold inland parts.
I now must change my former haunts, and force my horse to pass his well-known inns:
—“Where are you going?
my road lies not to Cumæ or to Baiæ,” the rider will say, with angry tug of the left rein;
but the horse hears orders through his bitted mouth:
which town is best supplied with corn;
do they drink rain-water stored in tanks, or constant wells from ever-flowing springs;
(for as to the native wines I stay not to ask;
in my country home I can bear with anything and be content:
when I come to the sea I need a generous and mellow wine to drive away my cares, to flow into my veins and mind with hoard of hopes, to give me store of speech, to renew my youth and gain me favour in the eyes of the Lucanian maids.
Which district rears more hares and boars;
which sea contains more fish and urchins, so that from it I may go home both plump and fat-a Phaeacian out and out;
all this 'tis meet you write me, and 'tis only fair that I should trust to you.
When Msenius had gallantly consumed all that his father and his mother left, he gained the reputation of1 a wit,—a roving parasite, not one to haunt a special stall, one who when undined would never know a Roman from a foe, merci­ less to fling his false and foul abuse, no matter what, on any one, he cared not whom, the market's pest and whirlwind, and its bottomless abyss.
Whatever gain he'd make, he'd give it all to his voracious maw.
When he had nothing, or but little, got from those who favoured or who feared his vile attacks, he would dine off plate after plate of common tripe and cheapest lamb, enough to satisfy three bears;
that he, a Bestius reformed,2 might say (just think of it 3), that spendthrifts' stomachs should be branded with a heated iron.
He too, when into smoke and ashes he had turned whatever greater spoil he got, would say, "By Hercules I'm not surprised that some should eat up all their means, since there is nothing better than a fine fat thrush, and nothing grander than a huge sow's paunch."
In sooth I'm such a one;
for when my money fails, I praise what's sure and small, content enough with humble fare;
but when some­ thing better and more tasty comes, I say that you alone are wise and you alone live well, whose wealth laid out in charming country-seats has much to show.
Dear Quintius, best of friends, in case you ask about my farm, whether it keeps its owner by its crops of grain, or makes him rich by fruit of olive groves, by orchards or by meadow lands, or by the elms all clad with vines, I shall describe in full detail its character and form, and how it lies.
There's an unbroken range of hills all round save where 'tis parted by a wooded 1 vale, but so disposed that in early day the sun lights up its right hand slope, and as he downward goes in rapid car he warms the left.
The mild­ ness of the climate you would praise.
What should you think if brambles bear abundantly the ruddy cornel and the prune ?2
If the oak and holm delight the owner and his flock with.
fruit in plenty and with shade?
You would say that Tarentum with its leafy bloom was close at hand?
There is a fountain there, quite large enough to give the river name, and such it is that Hebrus does not wind through Thrace with colder or with clearer stream.
It goes on its course to benefit weak heads, weak stomachs cure.
These retreats, to me attractive, aye, lovely, if you will, render me hale for you even in September days.
You spend your life aright if you take care to be what you are said to be.
We all in Rome long since declare that you're a happy man :
but I fear that as regards your state you trust to others more than to yourself and that you think none other happy but the wise and good, and that though the people called you sound and strong day after day, you hide the secret fever up to the hour for food, till the trembling seize your greasy hands.
'Tis fools whose undressed sores false shame conceals.
If any one should tell you of your battles fought by land and sea, and should delight your open ears by words like these:
" May Jupiter, who seeks the city's good and yours as well, keep it in doubt whether the people wish your welfare more, or you the people's;
" in this you could discern the praises to Augustus due :
when you bear to be called both wise and faultless, pray, tell me, do you answer1 for yourself? "
No doubt that I as well as you am happy to be called a good and prudent man."
The men who gave this name to-day, to-morrow will withhold it, if they please, just as if they gave the consul's badge to one, not worthy of the trust, and yet anon withdraw it.
"Lay it down," they say, "it is mine."
I lay it down, and in sadness take my leave.
Should the same men give it forth that I'm a thief, that I am lost to shame, that with a noose I had compressed my father's neck, should I be stung by false reproach, and change my colour ?
Who but a man that's full of faults and needing to be cured is pleased by honours undeserved or scared by false and foul reports ?
Who's then the honest man?
2
He who the Senate's Acts observes, who by the laws and equity abides, by whom as arbiter suits great and many soon are closed, by whom as surety property is safe, whose testimony gains a case."
Yet all his household and the neighbours too behold him base within, but fair to view with comely skin.
Should a slave thus say to me,"I have never stolen, nor run away.
"
"You have your reward," I say.
"By the scourge you are not wealed.""
I've never killed a man.
"
"You will not on the cross be food for crows.""
I am good and honest.
"The Sabine farmer denies assent, and says :
No, not at all:
for the wary wolf is wont to dread the pit, the hawk the suspected snare, the pike the baited hook.
'Tis through their love of virtue good men hate to sin :
you will commit nothing to your hurt1 through fear of punishment:
but if a hope exists of shunning notice, you will confound all right and wrong:
:
2 for when from a thousand pecks of beans you steal but one, the loss is thus to me more light, not so the sin to you.
The good man 3 whom every market, every court respects, whenever he adores the gods with pig or ox, after he has said aloud “O Father Janus," and aloud has said, "0 Apollo," just moves his lips, lest he be heard, and prays, "0 fair Laverna, give me power to cheat, to seem an upright and a holy man, cast darkness o'er my sins, and o'er my frauds a cloud.
"
How is the miser better, how freer than a slave, when on the crossing of the street he stoops to lift an as, seen sticking in the mud, I do not see:
for he who shall be covetous, must likewise be the slave of dread:
and more, he who shall live in dread, shall never, as I think, be free.
That man has lost his arms, and virtue's post betrayed, who always is in eager haste and is overwhelmed in adding to his wealth.
Don't kill your captive, if he will but sell for gold:
he will serve you to advantage:
let him be a sturdy shepherd and let him plough your land, let him be a sailor, and as a trader spend the winter on the open sea:
let him improve our market, let him bring us grain and other stores.
He that is truly good and wise" will dare to say:
"Pentheus, ruler of Thebes,1 what will you force me inno­ cent to bear and to endure ? "" I'll deprive you of your goods.
"
"That is, my flocks, my property, my couches, and my plate :
you're free to take them.""
In manacles and shackles will I hold you under a cruel guard.
"
"The god himself will loose me, whensoe'er I wish.
"This is his sentiment, I think, "I'll die."
Of all the things of earth Death is the final bound.
Scæva, though you are able for yourself to judge, and though you know how it is best to treat the great, hear the opinion of your humble friend, himself still needing to be taught, as if a man that's blind should volunteer to show the way:
see if even I can tell you aught which you may care to turn to use.
Should you delight in peaceful rest and sleep till dawn of day, if dust and rumbling wheels disturb you, and the tavern with incessant din, I will bid you go your way to Ferentinum.
For pleasures fall not to the rich alone, nor has he spent his life amiss, whose birth and death no notice Claimed.
If you should wish to serve your own, and treat yourself to better fare, since you are poor, go join a wealthy man.1 " If Aristippus could well on cabbage dine, he would not cultivate his kings and queens." " If he who censures me knew how to cultivate his kings and queens, he would despise his cabbage."
2
Tell me of which of these do you approve the words and acts, or as you're younger, hear why the notion of Aristippus is better;
for thus he parried, as they say, the snarling Cynic :
"I play the fool to please myself, but you to please the people :
this way of mine is better far and more respectable.
I pay my court that I may ride a horse and live with kings;
you beg for worthless scraps, hum­ bling yourself to him who gives them, although you boast that you're in need of nothing.
1
Every complexion of life, every rank, and every grade of means, became Aristippus, who aimed at greater things, though usually content with what he had.
On the other hand I shall be astonished if a change in mode of life will suit for him whom endurance clothes with doubled rag.
The one won't stay to get his purple cloak, but clothed in anything, will walk through most frequented parts, and will support both characters 2 not awkwardly :
the other will avoid a cloak of Miletus make, as worse than dog or snake;
he'll die of cold if you won't give back his rag:
give it back, and let him live his silly life.
To finish war's exploits, and show to citizens their cap­ tured foes, comes near the throne of Jove, and aims at heavenly fame :
to have pleased the foremost men is not the least of merit.
It falls not to the lot of all to go to Corinth.
The man sits still who fears he shan't succeed.
Well!
has he who reached the goal acted with manly pluck ?
And yet in this if anywhere else we find the very thing we seek.
3
One dreads a burden, as too great for little soul and little frame;
another takes it up and bears it to the end.
Either virtue is an empty name, or the man of enter­ prise is right in seeking honour and reward.
He who ne'er speaks of poverty when his patron is at hand, is sure to bear off more than he who bluntly asks :
it differs much whether you modestly accept, or snatch with greedy hand.
And yet this was the fountain-head and source of the whole matter.
1 " I have a sister who has got no dower, a mother, a poor wretched thing, a farm that will not sell, and can't support us;
" the man who says so, cries aloud, " Give me food."
Another one whines in, " and me too."
The cake will be divided for a dole to each.
But if the crow could eat its prize in peace, it would have more of feast, much less of brawl and grudge.
He who, when taken to Brundusium as a guest, or to Surrentum, with its charming scenes, complains of ruts, the bitter cold and showers, or wails his broken trunk and pilfered goods, repeats the harlot's common tricks, who oft laments a chain or anklet stolen, so that ere long no faith is placed in real losses and regrets.
Nor will a man, once cheated, care to lift a vagrant in the streets, with fractured leg, though many a tear should flow, though he invoke Osiris' holy name, and say, " Believe me, I do not mock ;
unfeeling men, help a poor cripple up." " Seek one who does not know your tricks," the neighbours harshly cry.
My Lollius, frankest of men, if I have read you right, you'd scorn, in friendship's guise, to play the part of sneaking parasite.
Just as an honest matron will from a harlot differ far in character and hue, so will a friend from faithless parasite be distant as the poles.
To the latter vice there is an oppo­ site and perhaps a greater one-a clownish roughness, both inelegant and gross, which courts regard by stubbly skin and blackened teeth, anxious the while to be esteemed mere un-restraint, and virtue, properly so called.
Virtue is the mean of vices, apart from both extremes.
One, obsequious to a fault, a jester of the lowest couch, so dreads the lord­ ling's nod, so iterates his talk, and as they drop, catches his words, that you would think a schoolboy conned the task by some harsh master read, or that an actor played the second part.
The other often wrangles about the wool of goats, and fights for trifles, armed to the teeth :
"
To think," he says, " that my authority should not be deemed the best, and that I should not state with open mouth 1 what I sincerely think !
a second life is dear at such a price."
For what's in dispute ?
Whether Castor or Dolichos has greater skill:
for Brundusium is it well to take the Appian or Minucian road.
Whom love at ruin's cost, whom dice with headlong speed strips of his means, whom vanity both clothes and per­ fumes past his power to pay, whom hunger and thirst for wealth enthral, whom shame and dread of poverty engross, a rich friend, ten times more versed in vice, oft hates and dreads;
or if he does not hate, schools him, and like a kindly mother, wishes him to be wiser and more virtuous than himself, and says, what's pretty true :
11 Don't vie with me, my wealth allows my folly;
your means are very small, a narrow toga suits a prudent friend;
1 cease to contend with me."
To any one he wished to harm, Eutrapelus was wont to give a suit of costly clothes :
"
For now," said he, "in pride of heart, with handsome robes he'll conceive new notions and new hopes, will sleep till dawn2 of day, for a mistress will defer his rightful work, will bor­ row money,3 and at last turn Thracian,4 or drive a gardener's cart for hire.
"Into a patron's secrets you will never pry, and keep with special care one trusted to your faith, aye even when racked by wine and wrath;
nor will you praise your own pursuits or blame another's;
nor when he shall wish to hunt, will you insist on making verse.
By this means was the affection of the brothers Zethus and Amphion rent, until the lyre disliked by Zethus, stern in mind, was hushed and still Amphion, as is thought, yielded to his brother's mood;
so likewise you, yield to your patron's mild demands, and when to the fields he leads his dogs, and horses laden with Ætolian nets, get up at once, and lay aside the moroseness of the unsocial Muse, that you may sup with him on equal terms on viands gained by toil-a pastime 5 by all true Romans shared, good for your character, your health, your limbs, the more so when you're well, and can surpass the dog in speed, the boar in strength.
Add, that there is not one who with more grace can use his manly arms:
:
1 you know with what loud plaudits of the ring you take your part in Campus' sports;
in a word, in boyhood you underwent stern service and Cantabria's wars beneath the chief who even now is taking down the eagles from the Parthian shrines, and is adjudging to Italian arms whatever parts of earth are unsubdued.
And-lest you draw back, and from the hunt abstain without excuse-though you are careful to do nothing out of tune and time,”2 sometimes you do amuse yourself at your father's country-seat;
the crews divide the boats;
the Actian fight's rehearsed in hostile fashion by your slaves, with you as leader;
—your brother is your foe, the pond is Hadria,—till Victory crowns one or other with her leafy wreath.
He who believes that you have sympathy with his pursuits will favour and approve your sport with both his thumbs.
8
To warn you further, if indeed you need a monitor, often ponder what you say, concerning each, and to whom you say it.
Avoid the prying man, for he's a gossip too, and wide spread ears retain not faithfully the secret given, and the word once uttered wings its way and cannot be recalled.
Let neither youth nor maid within the marble threshold of your friend gain your affection, lest the owner of the fair boy or of the loved maiden should either bless you with a trifling gift, or churlishly refuse.
Consider well, again and yet again, what kind of man you recommend, lest afterwards another's faults should cause you shame.
We are apt to be deceived, and sometimes introduce the undeserving ;
and then if faults sink any one, I cease to defend him when you're once deceived, so that you I may watch and guard one fully known and trusting to your help, for if by slanders tongue he's bitterly assailed, don't you see that in a little time the risk will reach yourself?
For your property's at stake when the nearest wall's ablaze;
and fires neglected are wont to gain new strength.
To pay attention to the great is sweet to those un­ tried :
he who has tried it shrinks.
When your ship is out at sea, attend to this, that a change of wind bear you not back again.
The gloomy hate the cheerful, and the mirthful the morose;
the lively the sedate;
the sluggish do not like the active and the brisk:
those who drink deep of good Falernian about the midnight hour, dislike him who declines the proffered cups, although you swear you greatly fear the fevers1 of the night.
From your brow remove the cloud :
very often the retiring man assumes the look of the reserved and sly, the silent of the sour.
Throughout all this you'll take good care to read and ask of learned men by what means you can spend your life in calm and quiet bliss;
whether desire, always in want, excite and worry you, or fear and hope of outward things, but moderately good :
2 whether learning brings us virtue, or nature gives it free;
what lessens cares, what restores your inward calm 3 what gives you perfect peace-honours or dar­ ling gains, or the retired road and path of an unnoticed life.
As oft as cold Digentia's stream recruits me, which Mandela drinks, a village wrinkled by the cold, what do you suppose my feelings are ?
What do you think, dear friend, are subjects of my prayer ?
May I still possess what now I have and even less, and may I live all for myself 1 in what of life remains, if heaven wills that any should remain ;
let me have a good supply of books, and food for a year laid in, and may I not waver in suspense through hope of future time.
But ’tis enough to pray to Jove, who gives and takes away:
Let him but give me life and means, I for myself will find peaceful mind.
Mæcenas, learned friend, if in old Cratinus you put trust, no poems water-drinkers write can please or live for long.
Ever since Bacchus ranged the half cracked poets midst his Satyrs and his Fauns, the darling Muses have almost daily smelt of wine from early morn.
By his praise of drink 'tis proved that Homer loved his wine.
Sire Ennius himself ne'er bounded forth to sing of arms till stirred by wine.
" To Abstainers I commit the Forum and the Puteal of Libo;
the strictly sober I forbid to sing."
Soon as this edict I gave forth, the poets did not cease to vie in cups by night, to smell of wine by day.
What if one with fierce and scowling look, with feet all bare, with gown of scanty cut, should Cato ape, would he embody then the character and worth of Cato ?
Iarbitas burst, while in wit and fire of eloquence he strove to match Timagenes, with all his gifts.
A model, easy to imitate in faults, leads men astray;
why, if I showed pale by accident, they'd drink the blanching cumin.
0 imitators, servile herd, how often have your noisy efforts stirred my wrath, how oft my mirth.
I was the first to plant untrammelled footsteps on a virgin soil;
with foot of mine I never trod another's ground.
He who in himself confides will lead and rule the swarm.
I was the first to show to Latium the Parian Iambics, following Archilochus in numbers and in tone, not in the subject and the words which drove Lycambes mad.
And lest perhaps you should on this account bedeck me with a meaner wreath, because I did not care to change the measure and poetic form, Sappho, for poets quite a match, qualifies1 her verse by the metres of Archilochus;
Alcæus does the same, though quite unlike in subjects and in form,2 but he seeks not a father-in-law, whom to befoul with verses full of spite, nor will he twist, by his lampoons, a halter for his bride.
Alcæus, not sung before by other lips, I, a Latin lyrist, have made well-known;
'tis a pride to me that bringing forward things before untold, I'm read by free­ men's eyes and thumbed by freemen's hands.
You would wish to know perhaps why the thankless reader praises and likes my humble works at home, but when abroad unfairly runs them down.
Votes of the fickle mob I do not hunt for, at cost of feasts and gifts of cast off clothes;
I, who listen to our noble authors and pay them back in kind,3 do not demean myself by canvassing the platforms of the pædagogic tribes:
hence these tears.

If I have said, "I am ashamed to read aloud things not deserving of a crowded hall, and to add weight to trifles";
"you jest," one says, "and keep those gems of yours only for Augustus' 5 ears, for, in your own eyes spotless, you feel assured that you alone the poet's honey can distil."
Chafing at this I fear to sneer at them, and, lest I be torn by the sharp nail of my opponent, I call aloud, I do not like the ground,6 and I de­ mand an interval.
For contests in sport are wont to breed excited fights and heated wrath, and wrath breeds enmities and deadly war.
You seem, my book, to give a wistful glance to Janus and Vertumnus, that smoothed by pumice of the Sosii,l you may stand forth, forsooth, to public gaze.
You don't like locks and seals, which modest books desire;
you grieve that you are shown to few, and you prefer a social life, not so brought up.
Off then to the place to which you long to go.
Once gone forth you can't come back again.
"What have I done, wretch that I am?
what did I mean?" you'll say when one has roughly used you;
and you know that you are huddled into little space when your sated reader palls.
But if the seer errs not through dislike at the offender, you will be a favourite at Rome until your bloom departs:
when thumbed by vulgar hands you shall begin to have a dirty look, you will either be food for sluggish moths, with not a soul to read you,2 or you'll run away to Utica, or to Lerida be bundled off.
The Mentor you refused to hear will have his laugh, like him who, in a rage, pushed down the cliffs the disobedient ass;
for who would trouble to pre­ serve a man against his will ?
This too awaits you, that stammering age shall surprise you as you teach the Rudiments to boys in the suburban streets.
When the warm sun has brought you more to hear, tell them that I, of freedman father sprung and of but humble means, spread forth my wings beyond my nest, so that to my merits you may add, what from my birth you take away:
say that I have pleased the city's foremost men in peace and war:
that I'm a man of stature small, grey-haired before my time, for sunshine suited, in temper quick, yet so that I was soon appeased.
If any one should chance to ask my age, tell him that I spent my forty-fourth December in the year that Lollius had Lepidus as colleague.
Since state affairs you bear alone, so many and so great, guarding the Roman world by arms, adorning it by moral code, and bettering it by laws, I should transgress against the public good, did I waste your precious time by any long discourse, 0 Caesar.
Romulus and Father Bacchus, and Pollux too with Castor, after their glorious deeds gained entrance1 to the temples of the gods, but whilst they're striving to improve the face of earth and civilise mankind, to settle bloody wars, and lands allot, and cities found, lamented that the gratitude they hoped did not accord with their deserts.
He who fell Hydra crushed, and by his fated toils those well-known monsters tamed, found that by death alone is envy over­ come.
For he who weighs2 down the excellences that lie beneath him, consumes them by his brilliant light:
the same when dead shall be adored.
On you while still on earth betimes we honours shower, and altars raise on which by your divinity 3 to swear, confessing that nothing such shall e'er arise, or has as yet arisen.
But this your people, wise and just in setting you alone before our leaders and the men of Greece, by no means values other things on a like principle and plan, for they despise and hate all else save what they see removed from earth and done with time:
while they so much admire the ancient poets as to insist that on the Alban Mount the Tables which all crimes forbid, by the Decemvirs framed, the leagues of kings arranged with Gabii, or with the Sabines brave and stern, the Pontiffs books, and the seers' ancient rolls, fell from the Muses' lips.
If, because the oldest writings of the Greeks are also best, the Roman writers in like scales be weighed, there is no reason to say much:
there is nothing hard inside the olive, nothing hard outside the nut.
We have reached the pinnacle of Fortune:
we paint, we sing, we wrestle more skilfully than the oil-smeared Greeks.
If time makes poems better, as it does our wines, I should like to know how many years would on our writings stamp a price.
Is the writer who died a century ago to be ranked among the perfect and the old, or with the worthless and the new?
Let some limit bar disputes.
He is old and classic who has lived a hundred years.
With which must he be reckoned who has died less by a month or year?
among the ancient poets or with those whom both a present and a future age may spurn ?
Such a one indeed may fairly rank among the ancients who is younger by a brief month or an entire year.
Your concession I accept, and as the hairs of a horse's tail,' I pluck and remove first one and then another, until baffled he falls like tumbling heap who has recourse to annals, and judges virtue by years, and admires nothing but that which Libitina hallows.
Ennius, both wise and vigorous, a second Homer too, as critics say, seems to care little to what his promises and his Pythagorean dreams may come.
Is not Nævius now read and does he not cling to our memory, as almost fresh ?
So sacred is every poem of the olden days.
When the ques­ tion's raised which of the two is better, Pacuvius gains the fame of "learned sage," Accius of "lofty and sublime."
'Tis said that Afranius' mantle fitted Menander quite, that Plautus hurries on after the manner of Sicilian Epicharmus, that Csecilius excels in dignity, Terence in skilful plot.
These mighty Rome learns off by heart, and these she views, cramped up in close-packed theatres :
these she esteems and reckons poets, from the age of Livius down to these days of ours.
Sometimes the public see what's right, again, they go astray.
If they so admire and praise the ancient poets, as nought to prefer to them, nought to compare, they're wrong:
if they think that sometimes they're too archaic, many times, too harsh, and confess they're often very dull, they're wise and side with me, and judge with Jove's assent.
For my part I don't rail at them, and think the works of Livius should be destroyed, which I remember that Orbilius, of flogging fame, read out to me, a little boy;
but I wonder that they're faultless deemed and beautiful and very nearly perfect:
in which if perchance an elegant expression has cropped up, and if a verse or two are rather neatly turned, that merit brings the poem to the front1 and guarantees its sale.
It is a shame that anything be censured, not because it's coarsely or inelegantly composed, but because 'twas lately done:
and that it's not indulgence, but honour and re­ wards, that for the ancients should be asked.
If I should doubt whether a play of Atta's rightly treads the stage 1 or not, almost all the senators would exclaim that shame has left the earth, since I attempt to blame what dignified Æsopus, what well-trained Roscius, played :
either because they think there's nothing right except what pleases them, or that they deem it a disgrace to yield to juniors, and to confess when old that what they learned when young should now be blotted out.
Now, he who praises Numa's Salian hymn, and wishes to seem alone to know, what he as little knows as I, does not favour or commend departed genius, but attacks our writings and in his spite hates us and ours.
But if newness had been as hateful to the Greeks as it is to us, what ancient work would now exist, or what would the public have which it could read and thumb, each for himself?
As soon as Greece, her wars given o'er, began to turn to life's less serious things, and in prosperity to vice incline, she now was fired with zeal for athletes, now for horses;
she fancied works in marble, ivory, or brass, she riveted her face and mind on pictures, and took delight, now in flutists, now in actors:
what she eagerly sought she very soon gave up, quite sated, even playing with her toys, just as a little girl, still with her nurse, would do.
What is there pleasing or disliked which you would not think worthy to be changed ? "
Piping times of peace " had this result, and favouring gales of Fortune.
For long at Rome it was a pleasure, and a usual thing, to be early up, with open door, to expound the law to clients, to lend out money well secured on creditable names, to learn from seniors, and to juniors tell, how money may grow more, and ruinous indul­ gence less.
The fickle public now have changed their mind and are in a fever with the one desire of writing:
boys and rigid fathers, their hair with bay leaves wreathed, dictate their poems whilst they dine.
I myself, who stoutly allege that I no verses write, am found to be more false than a Parthian, and wide awake before the sun is up, I call for my pen and paper and my desk.
He fears to steer a ship who knows not how:
none but one who has been trained dares give a patient herbs:
1 doctors profess what doctors' duties are:
workmen handle workmen's tools:
learned or unlearned we all write poems everywhere.
But yet what great and worthy points this craze and this mild madness has, infer as follows :
-A poet's mind is rarely tinged with greed:
verses he loves;
this one thing only he pursues:
losses, flight of slaves, and fires he laughs at:
he never plans to cheat a partner or a youthful ward;
he lives on potherbs and brown bread;
though as a soldier he is slack and cuts a sorry figure, he's useful to the state, if this you grant, that even by small things are the great ones helped.
The poet forms the tender and the lisping mouth of youth, he turns its ear even now from words and language coarse, and afterwards he moulds the mind by useful rules for life;
he checks all rudeness, jealousy, and tides of passion:
he tells of noble deeds, and as generations rise, he teaches them by famed examples of the great and good, the poor man he consoles, and cheers the sick at heart.
From whom would the unwedded maid and pious boy learn prayerful hymns, had not the Muse a poet sent ?
The chorus begs for help, and feels the sacred influence nigh, it asks the rains of heaven, and wins the favour by the prayer it learned, it averts disease and dreaded perils drives away, it earns us peaceful times and seasons rich in crops.
By hymns the gods above are soothed, by hymns the gods below.
The husbandmen of ancient days, sturdy in frame, and pleased with humble fare, recruiting their bodies in festive time, after their corn was stored, and their minds as well which hardships bore in hope of rest, with the sharers of their toil, their sons and faithful wife, appeased the goddess Earth with swine, Silvanus, god of woods, with milk, with flowers and wine their Genius which ne'er forgets that life is short.
This custom brought about Fescennia's licence, which poured its rustic taunts in dialogue, and the liberty, still welcomed as each year came round, indulged in friendly sport, until the jest, now cutting, began to turn to undisguised abuse, and without restraint passed on through families of good repute, with threatening mien.
They suffered who were assailed with blood-stained tooth:
even the unassailed felt anxious for the public weal;
nay more, a law was passed with penalties attached, which forbade that any man be branded by abusive verse:
they changed their tone, by the bludgeon forced to use more civil speech, and even to give delight.
Captive Greece captured her rugged conqueror in turn, and to unpolished Latium gave her arts, and then that rough Saturnian verse soon ceased to flow, and grace and elegance banished offensive gall;
but yet for many a day traces of its rustic birth remained, and even now remain.
For the Roman was late in turning his native wit to writings of the Greeks, and now at peace, when Punic wars were done, began to search what useful matter Sophocles, and AEschylus, and Thespis could present.
This too he also tried, if he could worthily translate their works, and with his trial he was pleased, being uplifted and eager to succeed, for he fairly shows the tragic breath, and is happy in his ventures, but in his ignorance he deems erasure a disgrace, and fears to change.
'
Tis thought that Comedy, because it draws its subjects from our daily life, needs little toil to write, but just as there's less indulgence shown, the greater is the labour.
See how Plautus supports the part of love-sick youth, of stingy father, of deceitful pimp;
how great1 Dossenus is in greedy parasites, in what a slipshod style he bustles o'er the stage:
for his great delight is to drop a coin into his chest, regardless after that whether the play succeed or fail.
Him, whom glory in her airy car has borne on the stage, the listless hearer deadens, the attentive cheers, so slight, so small a thing is that which can cast down or raise again the man who covets praise.
Farewell the stage if by refusal of the palm I'm rendered lean, and if the gift of it sends me to my home both plump and full.
Often too this frightens and drives off the daring poet, that the majority, inferior in honour and in worth, unlearned and senseless and ready to show fight if a knight should disagree, call for a bear or boxers in the middle of the play;
for in such shows the lowest plebs delight.
But now the pleasure even of the knight has passed from ear to eyes that never rest, and unsubstantial joys.
For four long hours or more the curtain is kept down, while troops of horse and bands of foot pass quickly by:
then after that ill-fated kings, maybe, are dragged along with hands behind them tied, all kinds of waggons, aye, even ships are hurried past, and captive ivory with all the spoils of captive Corinth.
Democritus, were he on earth, would have a hearty laugh, should a camel and a leopard joined in one, or a white elephant attract the notice of the crowd;
he would gaze at the people with more amazement than at the show itself, as affording him more sights by far;
1 he would think that writers tell their tales to some deaf ass.
For what powers of voice can drown the sounds our theatres give forth?
You'd think it was the roar of all Garganus' woods or of the Tuscan sea, with so much din are shows and works of art beheld, and foreign wealth, bedecked with which the actor, when on the stage he stands, is cheered and clapped again and yet again.
Did he say anything as yet?
No, not a word.
What then affords the pleasing sight ?
The woollen robe that by Tarentine dye rivals the purple hue.
But lest you think that I praise grudgingly what I myself decline to do, while others treat it with success, the poet, I assure you, seems to me quite fit to walk the tightened rope, who racks my heart by mere illusion, who rouses or soothes my passions, and fills me with unreal fears, like a magician, and one time places me at Thebes, and then again at Athens.
But come and give brief heed to those who rather on the reader lean than bear the haughty hearer's whims, if you wish to fill with books your gift so worthy of Apollo's name and to the poets add a spur, that with a greater zeal they may seek Helicon and all its bloom.
We poets, doubtless, to ourselves do harm (to cut my own vineyard 2 down) by offering you a book when weary and worried, when we feel hurt if any friend has dared a single verse to censure;
when unasked we return to passages already read :
when we complain that our labours are not at once per­ ceived, and with how fine a thread we've spun our poems ;
when we hope that matters will come round to this, that as soon as you have heard that we are making poems, you will with obliging readiness call us, unasked, force us to write, and bid us not to want.
But yet it's well1 to know what kind of guardians your worth possesses, well proved in peace and war,—worth that should not be entrusted to bards unfit.
That noted Choerilus was pleasing to Alexander, called The Great," and owed to his rude and ill-made verse the Philips2 he received, a royal coin.
But just as ink, when touched, leaves blots and stains, so writers very often smear most brilliant deeds by wretched verse.
That self-same king who bought so dear with lavish purse a poem so absurd, forbade by edict that any save Apelles should his portrait paint, or any but Lysippus mould the brass which represents the features of the valiant prince.
But if to books and to the Muses' gifts you called that taste, so fine in works of art, you'd swear that 'midst Boeotia's heavy fogs 'twas born and bred.
But neither do Varius and Virgil, your poets well beloved, disgrace your estimate of them, nor yet the gifts which they received-to the giver's credit, all confess;
nor do busts in bronze more faithfully present the features of our famous men, than does the poet's work display their character and gifts of mind.
Nor should I rather write poetic prose that crawls along the ground, than in verse record war's great exploits, and sing of scenes and streams of foreign lands, and castles built on mountain heights, and savage realms, and wars, under your guidance brought to a happy end o'er all the world, and of the bars that prison Janus, guardian of peace, and of the Parthians' dread of Rome since you began to rule the State, if my powers were only equal to my wish.
But neither does your high estate permit a trifling lay, nor does my modesty essay a task my powers should fail to bear.
Officious zeal unwisely plies him whom it loves, the more so when it shows itself in numbers and their art;
for one more quickly learns and more readily recalls what men may laugh at, than what invites approval and respect.
I care not for attentions which annoy me, and I neither wish to be exposed for sale in wax, with features worse than mine, nor to be praised in verses, poor and ill­ composed, lest I blush for shame when the stupid gift is given me, and, stretched beside my author in a box, be carried to the street which deals in incense and in scents, in pepper and whatever else is wrapped in worthless books.
Florus, trusty friend to good and noble Nero, if any one perchance should wish to sell to you a slave at Tibur born or Gabii, and should treat with you like this:
"He is fair complexioned, well made from head to foot;
he will be yours to 'have and hold' for eighty pounds;
a home-born lad, ready for duty at his master's nod, with a smattering of Greek, and fitted for whatever you please ;
you'll shape him into anything, like clay, when moist;
besides he'll sing, untrained a bit, but nice enough when one's at wine;
many promises shake confidence, when he who wishes to palm off his wares praises too much the things for sale.
There's nothing pressing me:
I am poor enough, but not in debt.
No dealer but myself would give you such a chance;
it isn't everyone would get from me an offer such as this.
He once turned lazy, it is true, and as boys will do, he hid below the stairs, fearing the impending lash.
You would give your money, if the flight, his only fault, does not displease you."
The seller, without a penalty, would bear away the price, in my opinion.
With open eyes you bought a faulty slave ;
the terms were plainly told you ;
do you pursue him, however, and annoy him with vexatious suit ?
I told you as you started that I was indolent, I told you I was almost quite unfit for duties such as this, lest you should chide me harshly because no answer came from me.
What did I profit then if you attack the laws which side with me ?
Of this too you complain, that proving false, I do not send the odes you hoped.
When one of Lucullus' soldiers, exhausted by fatigue, was sound asleep by night, he lost to a farthing all the savings he had made by many toils.
Thereafter, like a ravening wolf, enraged with self and foe alike, by hungry teeth made fiercer, he from its post dislodged a royal garrison, 'tis said, highly fortified and rich in varied stores.
Being famed for this exploit, he is adorned with many gifts of honour, and gets in sesterces twenty thousand, over and above.
Just after this, as chance would have it so, the general wished to take by storm some fort or other, and so began to urge this man in words which might put soul into a coward:
"Go, my brave fellow, where your valour calls, go and all luck attend you, and you will gain a grand reward for your deserts.
Why do you hesitate ?"
Then the soldier, boorish though he was, with ready wit replied, "He will go, yes he who has lost his purse, will go where'er you please.
"It was my lot to be brought up at Rome, and to be taught what woes Achilles' wrath brought on the Greeks.
Kind Athens lent me a little further skill, to wit, that I might wish to know the right from wrong, and seek for truth 'mid groves of Academus.
But times of hardship forced me from the pleasant spot, and civil turmoils bore me, unskilled in war, to arms not doomed to match great Caesar's might.
Whence soon as Philippi sent me forth, "a poor plucked fledgeling," stripped of my father's house and farm, daring poverty drove me on to write in verse;
but now that I possess what meets my wants, what hemlock draughts will clear my madness out, if I do not choose to be at rest rather than scribble verse ?
Years as they pass deprive me of my pleasures, one by one:
already they have taken hence my mirthful glee, my gallantry, my social ways, my sports;
they are about to wrest from me my powers of poesy;
what think you should I do ?
In short, we do not all admire and like the same;
in Lyric lays you take delight, for a second friend Iambics have a charm;
a third, again, revels in satiric verse and biting wit.
Much like this three guests of mine appear to disagree, asking with varied tastes for things far different in kind.
What am I to give ?
What am I not to give ?
You refuse what a second asks:
what you request is quite dis­ tasteful and offensive to the other two.
Above all else, think you that at Rome I can write poetry amidst so many cares and calls ?
One asks me to go bail, another to leave my own affairs and listen to his works:
on the Quirinal one friend lies sick, on farthest part of Aventine, another, and I must visit both;
"nicely convenient" 1 as to distance, you observe.
But the streets are clear, you say, so that nothing interferes with those engaged in thought.
Yes.
Here the contractor in hot haste hurries on with mules and men;
a crane swings round now a great stone, and now a monster log;
sad funeral trains with heavy lorries strive;
here runs a rabid dog, and there a sow, all mud:
go now, con over, if you can, melodious lines.
The poets all with one accord rejoice in woodlands and the city shun, due followers of Bacchus who delights in sleep and shade:
do you really mean that I, 'midst noise by night and din by day, should verses sing and follow in the poets' narrow track?
The genius who has sought still Athens for his home, and to his studies seven years has given, and has grown old with books and their attendant cares, not seldom walks abroad2 more silent than a statue, and with laughter makes the people shake their sides;
and should I deem it right in such a place, amidst the city's billows and its storms, to string together words which shall awake the lyre to song ?
At Rome a rhetorician lived, a pleader's sworn twin, so much so that in common talk the one would nothing hear but praises of himself, to such extent that this to that was Gracchus, and that was Mucius to this.
In what way does this craze less exercise our tuneful bards ?
'Tis lyrics I compose;
another elegies indites.
"A work (says one) wondrous to behold, aye, graven by the Muses Nine."
See first with what an air of pride, with what importance we survey the temple free to Roman bards !
These afterwards, if haply you are idle, follow on, and at a distance hear what each recites, on what account each claims a wreath.
We are hit, and with as many blows we waste the foe, like Samnites in the listless fight, until the lights come in.
By vote of him I'm dubbed Alcaeus;
and what is he by mine ?
What, but Callimachus ?
And if he more demands, I hail him as Mimnermus, and all at once he swells in size, by the adopted name.
I much endure that I may soothe the testy race of bards, while I write poetry myself, and as a candidate, seek for the people's votes :
my studies ended and my sanity regained, I may with safety stop my open ears against them as they read.
Men laugh at those who worthless verses make, but they themselves feel happy as they write, and admire themselves, and if you do not speak, unasked they laud whatever they have written,-happy men !
But he who shall wish to write a poem by the laws of Art, will with his tablets take an honest critic's role;
all that he shall find devoid of noble­ ness and weight, all that is undignified, he will not scruple to displace, though with a grudge it goes, and lingers still in Vesta's holy shrine.
With good intent he will unearth and bring to light expressive names for things, long from the public hid, which, used of old by Cato and Cethegus, unsightly mould now hides, and lone antiquity:
he will enroll new words which " Parent Need n 1 shall have brought forth.
Strong and clear and like a limpid stream he will pour out his richest stores, and with a wealth of language will our Latium bless :
what's overgrowth he will restrain, what's rather rugged he will smooth with jealous care, what's void of merit he will quite remove, he'll assume the aspect of a man at play, and will turn and twist, as one who dances, now a Satyr, now a clumsy Cyclops.
Yet I'd rather be esteemed a silly and a pithless bard, provided only that my faults delight myself, or at least escape my ken, than to be over-wise and, like a Cynic, snarL At Argos once there lived a man of no mean rank in life, who used to fancy that he heard grand tragic actors all day long, and so sat happy in the empty House, and applauded might and main, though one who in a proper way observed all other social dues,-as a neighbour truly good, as host or guest most lovable, kind to his wife, able to forgive his slaves, one who wouldn't rave and rage over a broken seal,2 one who could avoid a rock or open well.
When he, recruited by the aid and care of friends, expelled the ailment and the bile by undiluted hellebore, and came to himself again, he says, "Good friends, by Pollux, you have slain, not saved me, for by your kindness you have wrenched a pleasure from me, and have removed by force a most delightful craze.
"
No doubt 'tis useful to study wisdom and all trifling 3 to eschew, and leave to boys the games that suit their age:
and not to search out words for Latin lyres to modulate, but to learn by heart the numbers and the measures of the true and real life.
Wherefore of these things to myself I speak, and con them over in my silent thought;
if water without stint would fail to quench your thirst, you would consult your doctor;
but when the more you've got, the more you seek, do you not dare to own the fact to any friend ?
If a wound were not made easier by a herb or root prescribed, you would decline to be treated by a root or herb which did no good.
You had heard (we'll say) that sinful folly quits the man to whom the gods give wealth;
and though you're nothing wiser from the time you've grown more rich, yet will you take the same advisers as before ?
But if wealth could make one wise, less covetous and less afraid, no doubt you'd be ashamed if on earth there lived a man more greedy than yourself.
If what one buys with scale and brass1 becomes his own, -to some things use gives title, if lawyers you can trust -the land that feeds you is your own, and Orbius' steward when harrowing the soil that soon will yield you corn, feels you're his master.
You give your money;
in return you get your grapes, your poultry, eggs, and cask of wine :
why, you see, in that way bit by bit you buy the land, which for three hundred thousand2 had perhaps been bought, or even more.
What does it matter whether you live on what you paid for recently, or long ago ?
The sometime-buyer of a farm, at Aricia or at Veil, say, on purchased potherbs sups, though he thinks not so, on purchased logs he boils his kettle in the chilly eve;
but he calls it all his own, up to where the poplar planted on the march, to make it plain, recoils from neigh­ bours' feuds;
as if a thing could be the lasting right of any, which in a fleeting hour's brief space may change its owner, and pass to other hands by favour, purchase, violence, or death, the final arbiter.
Thus because a right in perpetuity is given to none;
and heir succeeds another's heir as wave to wave succeeds, what do estates avail or granaries ?
and what do Lucanian pastures profit, to Calabrian joined, if Orcus gathers great and small, and can't be won by gold.
Gems, marble, ivory, Tuscan statuettes, paintings, silver plate, clothes with Afric purple dyed, some men there are who have, there's one, I know, who wishes-not to have.
Why of two brothers one should choose to idle, and to sport, in unguents to indulge, rather than enjoy the grand estate of Herod's palms;
while the other, rich and persistent in his work, from dawn till shades of night subdues the wooded uplands by fire and ox and plough, their Genius only knows, who ever close at hand, controls our natal star, god of man's nature, dying as each one dies, changeable in aspect, benign or adverse.
I will enjoy myself and from a modest store will take as much as need requires, nor shall I fear what any heir may think of me, because he has not found more than my will bequeaths him;
and yet I shall wish to keep in mind how much the simple and the jovial man differs from a waster, and what a gulf there is between the miser and the man of thrift.
For it matters much whether you squander lavishly, or neither grudge your outlay, nor labour to acquire a greater store, but rather with eagerness enjoy the brief and grateful time, just as the boy does, when on holiday in spring.
1
Let poverty and squalor2 be distant from my house;
whether I sail in great or little ship, I shall sail one and the same.
I am not borne on with sails by favouring North wind filled, and yet I do not pass my life under an adverse South;
in strength, in intellect, in display, in virtue, station, means, last of the van, but still before the rear.
You're not a miser then;
'tis well;
but, what ?
Have all your vices fled together with that one ?
Is your mind from vain ambition free ?
Is it free from fear of death and anger at his raids?
Do you laugh at dreams, at magic terrors, prodigies, and witches, at nightly ghosts and spells of Thessaly ? 8
Do you count your birth-days with a grate­ ful heart?
Do you forgive your friends?
Do you grow gentler and better as old age comes on ?
What does it profit you when you weed out but one of many thorns ?
If you know not how to live aright, make way for those who do.
Of sport you've had enough, of feasting and of drink :
'tis time for you to go, lest youth whom revel better suits should hoot and drive you from the feast, when you have drunk too much.
Should a painter take a whim to join to human head a horsed neck, and to clothe with motley feathers limbs derived from any bird or beast, so that a female bust, shapely and fair to see, should finish off in form of hideous1 fish, could you, my friends, admitted to a private view, restrain a laugh ?
Believe me, Pisos dear, a book would be a match for that, whose images, like sick man's dreams, should be so wildly cast that neither foot nor head could be assigned to any special form.
"Painters and poets," you will say, "have ever had an equal right of bold device."
I know, and so this leave I ask, and give it in return;
but not to this extent that the savage should be mated with the tame, that serpents with birds should pair and lambs with tigers join.
To efforts serious and of promise great a purple patch or two are often stitched, to shine afar, when one describes the grove and altar of Diana, or the winding of the stream that hurries on through charming scenes, or the river Rhine, or rainbow's arch.
But now there was no place for these.
Perhaps you can depict a cypress.
What good is this if he who's sketched has paid a fee to show a sailor swimming from his shattered ship without a hope ?
'Twas a wine jar that the potter meant to make:
why comes a pitcher from the running wheel ?
Let your aim be what it will, if it be a simple and consistent whole.
We bards, Sire Piso and your worthy sons, or most of us, at least, are led astray by visions of what's Right:
I strive to be brief—I become obscure :
when I seek to give polish-nerve and spirit fail;
one apes the grand, and ends in bombast-he crawls upon the ground who is too guarded and too fearful of the breeze;
he who strains to give unnatural variety to what is one and single, depicts a porpoise in the woods, a boar among the waves:
zeal to shun a fault leads to a vice, if a sense of art is wanting :
the lowest workman near Æmilius'
School will clearly show the nails in brass, and imitate the curve and flow of hair;
un­ successful in the main, because he'll not know how to represent a whole.
If I should wish to write a piece, I should not rather choose to be such a one as that, than I should like to pass through life with a misshapen nose, while much admired for blackness of my eyes and hair.
Ye authors, take subject matter equal to your powers, and ponder long, what your shoulders cannot bear, and what they can.
The man who shall a subject choose within his powers, neither rich choice of words will fail, nor clear arrangement.
Of arrangement this will be the merit and the charm, or I'm deceived, that one should say just now what should be said just now, should much postpone and for the present leave aside:
let the author of a long expected poem prefer one thing, despise another.
1Then, too, in combining words with subtle taste and well­ weighed thought, your expression will be happy if a skilful "setting" shall have given new force to well-known words.
If you need, perhaps, by new-made terms to designate things previously unknown, you will be free to coin fresh words not heard by old 2 Cethegi;
much liberty will be allowed, if wisely used.
Words strange and newly coined will gain acceptance, if from a Grecian source they flow, with small divergence from the parent stream.
1
But why will Romans grant to Plautus and Cæcilius what to Virgil and to Varius they denied?
Why should a grudge be shown to me if I some vocables can add, when the language of a Cato and an Ennius enriched their mother tongue, and introduced fresh names for things ?
It has been right and always will be so, to coin a word that 11 bears the mint-mark of the day.
"As when the woods their foliage change, as year by year rolls on, leaves first put forth are first to fall:
so perishes the older race of words, and like our youth those lately born soon flourish and grow strong.
Death has a right to us and ours:
whether the sea retiring inland shelters our navy from the northern blasts, a royal work2;
or the lake long barren and for rowing fit, supports the neigh­ bouring towns and feels the heavy plough;
or the stream led by a better route has changed its course, which erewhile was the ruin of the crops j all mortal work shall perish;
much less can language keep its honour and its charm to length of years.
Many things which have decayed shall come to life again, and words which now are in repute shall fall into disuse if custom will it so,-custom " to which belongs the rule, the law, the government of tongues.
"Homer has taught us in what metre we should write the deeds of captains and of kings, and tearful wars.
In coupled verses of unequal length first elegies were couched :
then afterwards, by it was shown men's gratitude for granted prayer:
yet the learned still dispute who first put forth these lesser elegies,l and the matter is as yet in doubt.
'
Twas rage of passion that armed Archilochus with his own Iambics;
this foot the sock 2 and the tall buskin chose, suited for dialogue, drowning the people's hum, and made by nature for the actor's use.
To the lyre the Muse has given to sing of gods, the sons of gods, the victor in the ring, the horse that wins the race, young lovers' cares and wine which drives them off.
If I have neither power nor skill to keep a part,3 as first defined, consistent in its every stage, and to maintain the general colour of my works, why am I hailed as poet ?
Why with false shame do I prefer to hug my ignorance, rather than to learn ?
A comic subject will decline to be set forth in tragic verse;
likewise Thyestes' supper scorns to be treated in the strains of common life, scarce worthy of the sock.
Let each kind, as it befits, retain the place it has acquired.
Yet sometimes Comedy uplifts her voice, and an angry Chremes vents his rage with scathing words, and in tragedy a Telephus and a Peleus wail in lowly prose, when each, poor and in exile, discards his paint-pots and his yard-long words, that is, if by his plaints he wish to touch the hearer's heart.
Nor is't enough that poems should be prettily composed:
let them be charming too, and let them lead the hearer's mind where'er they please.
As smile responds to smile, so kindly faces wait on those who weep.
If you wish that I should grieve, you first must grieve yourself;
then Telephus and Peleus, your ills shall touch me too:
if you utter wail- ings ill-conceived, you'll make me either sleep or laugh.
Sad words become a face that's sad, and threats befit an angry one;
sportive words a merry cheek, and sober ones a brow severe.
For Nature first adapts our inward state to For­ tuners every guise;
she makes us happy, or impels to wrath, or with heavy sorrow bows us to the ground and wrings our hearts ;
then afterwards reveals the mind's emotions through medium of the tongue.
If a speakers words are quite unsuited to his state, the Romans all, both high and low, would raise a loud guffaw.
It will vastly differ whether 'tis god or demigod who speaks, a man of years mature or one still glowing with the bloom of youth, the matron of authority, or bustling nurse, the roving trader or the tenant of a thriving farm, a Colchian or Assyrian, one reared in Argos or in Thebes.
Either let tradition be your guide, or frame new characters which with themselves shall well accord.
If perchance you bring once more upon the stage the famed Achilles, let him be restless, wrathful, obdurate and fierce ;
let him deny that laws were made for him;
let him claim all for arms.
Let Medea be savage and relentless, Ino tearful, Io a wanderer, Ixion perjured, Orestes melancholy-mad.
If on the stage you place an untried venture, and risk to cast your characters afresh, let each be kept up to the close the same as when it started first, and let it be consistent with itself throughout.
It is difficult to give things common an individual cast, and you do better if you divide Troy's story into acts, than if you were the first to bring out things before unknown and still unsung.
Matter that is common you will make your own, if you linger not upon the cheap and well known round, and do not render word for word, as some -close copyist, nor as an imitator jump into a narrow hole, from which your honour and the poem's law forbid escape.
Nor will you begin like Cyclic poets long ago ;
" Priam's fortunes I'm about to sing, and the war so famous."
What will this boaster bring worthy of such a mouth?
The mountain will with labour heave, and will produce a tiny mouse.
How much more wise is he who nought professes with a laboured show:
" Sing, Muse, the man, who after Troy was sacked, went forth to view the cities and the ways of many men."
He never tries to bring forth smoke from brilliant blaze, but from the smoke to give out light, that after that he may disclose to view things beautiful and strange,—Antiphates and Scylla, and Cyclops and Charybdis.
Nor does he trace brave Diomede's return, from Meleager's death, nor tell the story of the Trojan war from Leda's two­ yolked egg :
he always hastens to the main event, and lands his reader in the midst of things, as if he knew them all, and leaves those points to which he cannot hope to give eclat by treatment, and so invents, so mixes up the real and the feigned, that 'tis impossible to tell the opening from the middle, the middle from the end.
Hear now what I and Romans all desire;
if you wish a pleased spectator to await the curtain's rise and to remain until the actor says, "give your applause," the habits of each time must be observed, and something fitting must be given to varying tastes and years.
The boy who now can talk and mark the ground with steady tread, with mates delights to play, and readily flares up in wrath, as readily cools down, and changes moods from hour to hour.
The beardless youth, now from his tutor free, delights in horses and in dogs, and in the contests on the sunny plain, pliant as wax to mould to vice, gruff to those who counsel right, slow to provide what's needful, lavish of his gold, high spirited, and of keen desires, and quick to lay aside what he had loved before;
with tastes quite changed, of age and mind mature he now seeks wealth and friendships, to office is a slave, is cautious of doing aught which after­ wards he may desire to change.
The old man many ills surround, either because he follows gain, and grudgingly abstains from what he has amassed, and fears to take its use, or because he sets about all matters in a timid and a heartless way, a dawdler, patient in hope, wanting in energy, and eager for the future, morose, a grumbler, still praising the good old times when he was young, a reprover and reformer of younger men.
Years as they come bring with them many boons, and as they go they many blessings take.
Lest haply old men's words and acts be given to youths, and full grown men's to boys, we shall always dwell upon the features which best befit each stage of life.
Events either occur upon the stage, or are reported there as having taken place.
What enters through the ears less keenly stirs the mind than what's submitted to the trusty eyes, and what the spectator to himself imparts;
but yet you will not on the stage produce what's better done behind the scenes, and much will from the view withhold, which grace of eloquence will soon record before the House:
let not Medea slay her sons in the spectators' sight, nor openly let impious Atreus cook the human flesh, nor Procne be to a bird transformed, nor Cadmus to a snake.
Whatever you thus show to me I don't believe, but only loathe.
Let a play have just five acts, no more, no less, if 'tis meant to be called for, and when acted once to be performed again.
Bring in no god, unless a crisis comes which calls for such a help;
nor force one actor more than three to speak.
The chorus should perform an actor's part, and do the duty "like a man;
" and let not anything be sung between the acts, save what assists the plot and aptly fits the place.
Let it show favour to the good and give its kind advice, and check the wrathful, and cherish those who fear to sin:
let it praise the dishes of a frugal board, justice that's fair to all, and laws, and peace with open gates;
let it secrets keep, and let it pray and importune the gods, that fortune would to wretched men return, and would forsake the proud.
In days of old the flute, not bound, as now, with brass, nor rivalling the trumpet's roar, but slim and simple with few stops, was useful to accompany and aid the choirs, and with its breath to fill the seats not yet too densely crammed;
to which the people, as 'twas small, flocked on in moderate amount, temperate, devout, respectful.
Then, its conquests o'er, when it began to enlarge its bounds, and gird its cities with a wall of greater sweep, and at feasts to appease its Genius with wine by day, without a fear of penalty, a greater licence was allowed to rhythm and measure;
for what good taste could unlearned rustics have, when from their work set free, they mixed with townsmen, the base born with the high ?
Thus to the ancient art the flutist added movement of limb, and splendid dress, and as he strode the stage he drew a robe with sweeping train.
Thus, too, clear notes were added to the solemn lyre, and a headlong rush of words produced a burst of eloquence before unknown, and the utterance, full of useful saws, and presage of things to come, differed in nothing from the Delphic lots.
He who in tragic verse contended for a worthless goat soon brought upon the stage the naked Satyrs, and, rudely sarcastic, tried his jokes without the loss of dignity, for this reason that the spectator must be kept alive by some allure­ ment, and some novelties to please, since he had aided in the sacrifice, had freely drunk, and now defied all law.
But it will be fitting to commend the drollery and smartness of the Satyrs, to change from grave to gay, yet provided that, whatsoever god or hero shall be introduced, one lately conspicuous in royal gold and purple should not descend into low taverns with his vulgar talk, or whilst he shuns the ground, should never try to gain the clouds and empty void.
Tragedy, beneath whose role it is to babble forth some silly lines, will with the froward Satyrs mix, with some becoming modesty, just as an honest matron does when bid to dance on festal days.
O Pisos, should I ever come to write satyric plays, I shall not choose some trite and common words;
nor shall I strive to differ so from tragic style, that it should matter nought whether the speaker be a Davus, and a brazen Pythias who from deluded Simo a whole talent stole, or a Silenus, guardian and attendant of his heavenly ward.
My aim shall be a poem founded on a well-known theme, so that any one may hope to do the same, but when he has tried, may labour much, and find his toil in vain.
So great is the effect produced by arrangement and combination, so much dignity is added even to materials very mean.
Let the Fauns, brought from the woods to tread the stage, beware, as I advise, lest as if born in Rome's most busy part, and almost forum-bred, they either ape the youths too much in tender strains, or utter foul and shameful words;
for the knight, the freeborn, and the men of means, are thus in feelings hurt, nor though the crowds who1 live on peas and roasted nuts approve of anything, do they on that account receive it patiently, and gift the poet with a wreath.
To a short add on a long, and thus an Iamb form, a light and tripping foot;
whence also it bade the name of trim­ eter 1 to be given to Iambics, though it returned six beats, each foot the same from first to last:
2 not long ago, that it might come upon the ear with somewhat slower and more solemn step, it took the staid spondeus to its native rights, kind and obliging, but not so far, that from the second and the fourth it should retire, as partners mighty In Accius' noble trimeters this foot is seldom found;
and Ennius' verses, sent upon the stage with ponderous weight, it charges with the shameful fault of work too hurried and devoid of care, or else with ignorance of poetic art.
It is not every judge who sees false rhythms in verse, and thus unworthy licence is to Roman bards allowed.
Am I then to roam at will and write as fancy leads ?
or should I think that all will see my faults, and so keep safe and wary within reach of pardon ?
In short, I have avoided blame,—not praise deserved.
Ye Pisos, look to Greece, and con her models over night by night and day by day.
But your fathers praised the numbers and the wit of Plautus;
admiring both, too easy critics, not to say foolish, if, only, you and I can judge between what's coarse and what's refined in words, and can detect the proper cadence of a line by finger and by ear.
Thespis invented Tragedy, 'tis said, a kind of poetry unknown before, and in waggons carried round his Plays, which persons, their faces smeared with lees of wine, should sing and act.
Then Æschylus, deviser of the mask and seemly robe, taught actors lofty utterance and the buskin's stately tread.
After these the Older Comedy came in, not without its meed of praise, but liberty to licence turned, and to excess which called for law's restraints.
A law was passed, and the right of libel being removed, the chorus, to its shame, was dumb.
Nought have our poets left untried, and not least honour have they gained, when they have boldly swerved from foot­ steps of the Greeks, and sung our country's deeds, whether it was Tragedy or Comedy they showed in Roman dress.
Nor would our Latium be less renowned for letters than for bravery in arms, did not our poets, one and all, disdain to bear the tedious labour of the file.
1 0 you who come of Numa's blood, that poem hold at fault which many a day and many a blot have not restrained, and have not ten times tested by the close-cut nail.

Because Democritus believes that native talent far excels our wretched Art, and from Mount Helicon excludes those poets sound in mind, the greater part of them are careful not to pare their nails, nor trim their beard,-they seek retired spots, and shun the baths.
Each fancies he will gain a poet's worth and name, if to Licinus, who crops the sane in mind, he never trusts his head, which three Anticyras won't cure.
0 infatuate that I am, who clear away my bile as spring comes on.
No one else would better poems make.
But it's no great matter.
So, I shall act the whetstone's part, which, powerless itself to cut, makes sharp the steel.
Though I write nothing, I will show the poet's office and his duty too, whence he gains his rich supplies, what rears and moulds the poet true;
what is proper, what is not;
whither true Art directs your path, where false ideas bear you to.
Sound wisdom is the starting point and source of writing well;
the works of Socrates will matter give, and matter once supplied, words will follow with a ready flow.
He who has learned what to our country, what to our friends we owe, with what affection we should cherish parents, brothers, guests, what duty to a senator belongs, what to a judge, what part a general sent out to war should play, that man, without a doubt, knows how to give each character its own becoming traits.
I should advise the man who with cunning skill both men and things would paint, to regard with care a fitting type of manners and of life, and thence to draw the words that live and speak.
Sometimes a Play, devoid of beauty, "of solid value or artistic skill," if it have passages of showy moral saws, and characters well drawn, thrills the audience with more true delight, and holds them spell- bound with a surer grasp, than verses wanting substance, or trifles with a pleasing sound.
To the Greeks who nought but fame desire the Muse has given the native gift of poesy:
she has given the art of pure and finished speech.
The Roman boys learn to divide the as into a hundred parts, in lengthy sums."
Let the son of Albinus say, if an uncia is taken from a quincunx, what remains.

You might have said, "a triens""
Good!
you'll be able to guard your interests.
Reverse the process and add an uncia, what is the result ? " "A semis.
"When this canker, and this petty greed of pelf has once imbued their minds, can we still expect that poems can be made, worthy to be touched with cedar oil, or to be kept in well smoothed cypress case ?
Poets wish to profit or amuse, or to say what is at once agreeable, and of use in life.
Let what you enjoin be brief, that things said quickly may be retained by willing ears and faithful minds:
pour in too much, the vessel overflows.
Let fiction meant to please be near as possible to truth, and let no story claim belief for every thing it chooses to invent, and let it not draw forth a living child from Lamia's stomach, newly dined.

The elder knights2 drive from the stage a piece without a moral aim ;
the haughty "juniors " scout the tight-laced and the dry:
that poet carries every vote who blends the pleasant with the good, who charms the reader, and gives him counsel too;
such book is sure the coffers of the Sosii to fill;
it crosses ocean, and there is read, and to a distant age hands down the writer's well- known name.
Yet faults there are which may indulgence claim;
for neither does the string return the sound which hand and mind intend, but very often gives you back a sharp when you demand a fiat, nor will the bow at all times hit the object of your aim.
But when the beauties in a piece are more in number far, I shall not with the blots find fault, which either want of care has caused,1 or nature's weak­ ness failed to shun.
How then stands the case?
Just as a copyist no pardon finds, if ever and again he makes the same mistake, though often warned;
just as a jeer the harpist greets who always strikes the same false note;
so he who often fails, appears to me a second Chcerilus, at whom, when now and then he makes a hit, I wonder as I laugh;
though all the same I feel aggrieved if 'tis found that worthy Homer sometimes takes a nap:
and yet it's no great sin if o'er a lengthy poem sleep should steal at times.
As with a painting, so with a poem;
there is one which takes you more, if you are near, and one, if you are farther off;
one likes the shade, another will prefer to brave the open light, dreading not the critic's keenest skill;
this pleases once, this viewed ten times will please.
O elder son of Piso's house, though by your fathers words you're trained to right, and though your judgment is by nature true, take and make your own this word of mine­ to certain things a middling and a reasonable share of worth is rightly given.
Thus, the counsellor and advocate of fair abilities is far below the talent of the eloquent Messala, and of Cascellius Aulus' legal lore, but yet he is esteemed;
mediocrity to poets is denied by men and gods and bookstalls.
As at a pleasant feast jarring music gives offence, and unguents coarse, and poppy with Sardinian honey, because the banquet could be carried on without such helps ;
so a poem made and designed to please men's minds, if it descend the least from merits heights, sinks to the depths.
The man not versed in games abstains from Campus' sports, and one unskilled in ball, or quoit, or hoop, sits still, lest the crowded rings should find good cause to raise the laugh :
he who verses knows not, verses dares to make, and why should he not ?
He's free and free-born, and more than that, he's rated as a knight, and far removed from every taint of crime.
You, my friend, will nothing say and nothing do, which native wit forbids :
1 such is your judgment, such your purpose.
Yet if you some day write a piece, let it be read in private by Maecius as judge, by your father and by me, and let it be withheld for nine long years, your "copy" safely locked away;
what you've never published you can easily destroy :
a word sent forth ne'er finds its home again.
Orpheus, the priest, and mouth-piece of the gods, restrained from bloodshed savage men, and from their foul repasts, and hence 'twas said he tamed the tigers and the lions fierce;
'twas said too that Amphion, founder of the Theban fort, by his lyre's notes made stones to move, and led them where he willed by coaxing strains.
In days of old 'twas wisdom's task to draw a line betwixt the rights of men and states, twixt sacred and profane, to guard from stray concubinage, to lay down marriage rights, cities to found, and laws on wood engrave.
So honour and renown accrued to bards and strains of bards as if by heaven sent.
Famed after these old Homer and Tyrtaeus by their verses whetted manly souls to martial wars;
by means of verse were oracles declared ;
in verse the path of life was clearly shown;
and in Pierian strains were monarchs' favours sought;
amuse­ ment too was found to close the weary labours of the year:
all this I say, in order that the Muse, skilled in the lyre, and Apollo, god of song, may never chance to cause you blush of shame.
It has been asked whether it is by Art or nature's gift that poems, worthy of our praise, are made.
I, for my part, do not see of what avail would either study be without a true poetic vein, or what genius wanting culture could effect:
thus each demands the other's aid, and so in friendly union they combine.
He who is eager in the race to reach the wished-for goal, even while a boy has much endured and practised much, has borne extremes of heat and cold, has abstained from love and wine :
he who at the Pythian games plays on the flute has learned the art before, and borne a master's stern rebuke.
But now 'tis quite enough to say, "I make wondrous poems :
plague take the hindmost;
'tis a shame for me to stay behind and to confess, I really know not what I never learned.
"Just as the salesman draws a crowd to buy his wares, so the poet rich in land, rich in invested funds, invites his flatterers to come for gain.
But if he's one who can afford to serve in style a dainty meal, and bail the poor and needy, and free them from the fatal meshes of the law, I shall be astonished if, happy man, he shall come to know the lying, from the honest, friend.
If you, my friend, have given, or mean to give a gift to any one, bring him not, when full of joy, to verses made by you :
for he will exclaim, beautiful!
bravo!
well done!
over some he will no doubt grow pale, will even with loving eyes shed tears, with delight will dance, and stamp the floor.
As those who weep at funerals for hire make almost more lament and more ado than those who from the heart their wailings pour, so does the mocking flatterer show more emotion than the true admirer.
Tis said that kings ply hard with many cups, and put to the test by wine, him whose inner thoughts they wish to know, and see if he deserves their friendship;
if poems you compose, never let thoughts lurking beneath a cunning guise, deceive you.
Suppose that to Quintilius you read a piece, he'd say, " Correct this, I beseech you, and this;
" should you declare, you could not do it better, though you had tried again and yet again with no effect, he would bid you cancel it, and on the anvil place again the verses badly formed.
If, rather than amend the line you chose the blot to keep, he would not spend another word, or waste his efforts, but let you hug both self and work, without a rival and alone.
The man of honesty and sense will censure verses void of pith, will blame the harsh, the inelegant will cross and smear, will prune away all florid ornament, will bid you to make clear what is obscure, will challenge the equivocal, will mark what should be changed;
will become, in fact, an Aristarchus out and out:
he will not say, " Why should I hurt the feelings of a friend for trifles ? "
These trifles will bring to serious trouble him who has once been fooled, and with uncandid warmth received.
As all shun him whom a malignant itch affects, or jaundice, or frenzied craze, or moonstruck madness, so men of sense avoid, and even flee, the crackbrained bard;
the boys torment him, and follow on, heedless of risks.
While he with head in air, belches his verses forth, and strays about, if like a fowler, on his game intent, he falls into a well or pit, although he shout to reach afar, 11 ho citizens, come to my help," not one would care to take him out.
If any one does care to aid him and let down a rope, I should say, " How know .you if on purpose he jumped in, and would rather not be saved ?
and I will tell how the Sicilian bard, Empedocles, came by his death.
While wishing to be deemed a god, he leaped into burning Ætna, " calm and cool."
Let poets have the right and liberty to perish if they wish.
He who saves a man against his will, is just as bad as he who kills him.
For not once only has he acted thus, nor if you bring him back, will he at once become a reasonable man, and lay aside the love of a notorious death.
Nor does it quite appear why he should verses make:
whether he has defiled his father's grave, or impiously disturbed some cursed spot1 ;
at any rate, he's mad:
and like a bear, if he can burst the bars which guard his cell, this merciless reciter puts to flight learned and unlearned alike;
but if he catches one, he holds him fast, and by his reading kills,-a very leech that wont let go the flesh till he is filled with blood.
