473THE object of this dialogue is to inquire into the nature of Virtue in the abstract;
to ascertain whether it can or cannot be taught;
and to show that the knowledge we now possess is but the recollec­ tion of what the mind was conversant with at some former period.
On the first of these points Plato, as usual, arrives at no conclu­ sion.
For Socrates, who is merely Plato's mouth-piece, and not, as many imagine, the exponent of his own opinions, never pretended to know any thing in the abstract.
He was therefore content to show, that for the development of Virtue a correct moral conduct, founded on prudence, temperance, and justice, is all that is requisite.
With regard to the question, whether Virtue can or cannot be taught, we are told that, as Virtue is not a science, it cannot, like a science, be made the subject of teaching;
and that the virtuous person is such, rather by an act of the deity than by any efforts made by man.
Of the speakers, the principal is Meno, a Thessalian, who had been a pupil of Gorgias, and is supposed to be the person mentioned by Xenophon in the Anabasis, where his character is drawn in the darkest colours, and reflecting to the life the conduct of those, who had been taught by the Sophists of Greece :
— " quærenda pecunia primum;
Virtus post nummos."
Seek money first;
and virtue after coin.
Towards the latter part of the dialogue, Anytus, best known as one of the accusers of Socrates, is introduced, as taking accidentally a share in the conversation;
partly because he was Meno's host;
but more, perhaps, with the view of enabling Plato to show, that the answers which Anytus gives to questions on political subjects, were less sensible than those, given by his own slave on geometrical problems;
and this too, although the former had been under the cleverest masters, and the latter was merely self-taught.[1.]
MenD. CAN1 you tell me, Socrates, is virtue to be taught?
or is it to be not taught, but acquired by (mental) exercise ?2 or does it come to man neither by (mental) exer­ cise, nor teaching, but by nature, or some other means ?
Socrates.
The Thessalians, Meno, have been of old in great repute among the Grecians, and admired for their skill in horsemanship,3 and for their wealth;
and now, I think, (they are) no less so for their wisdom.
4
And not the least so, are the fellow-citizens of your friend Aristippus of Larissa.
Now of this Gorgias is the cause.
For when he came to the city (of Larissa), he so captivated the chiefs of the Aleuadæ,5 one of whom is your friend Aristippus, and those of the other Thessalian families, that they fell in love with him for his wisdom.
6
And in truth this custom has habituated you to answer fearlessly and with a high bearing, if any one asks a question;
as indeed becomes those who know a subject thoroughly.
Since he7 too offered himself for any of the Greeks to interrogate him on any matter he might think proper;
and there was not one, to whom he did not give an answer.
But here, friend Meno, the very reverse has occurred.
There is, as it were, a dearth of wisdom;
and there is a danger, that wisdom has departed from this country, and has fled to yours.
Should you then be willing to put this question to any one here, there is not a man who would not laugh and say, " I run the risk, stranger, of seeming to you to be one of the blessed,8 in know­ in,, whether virtue is to be taught, or comes by any other means whatever;
since I am so far from knowing whether it is to be taught or not, that I happen not to know what virtue is at all."
Now this, Meno, is my own case. [2.]
I am in the same poverty of knowledge as my fellow-citizens in this affair;
and I blame myself for being totally ignorant of virtue.
How then can I know the quality of that, of which I know nothing?
Or do you think it possible for a man, wholly ignorant, who Meno is, to know whether Meno is a handsome, or rich, or generous spirit, or the reverse of all these charac­ ters ?
[Do you think it possible ?] 9Meno.
I do not.
But in good sooth, Socrates, do you really not know what virtue is ?
and shall I send home this report of you ?
Soc.
Not only that, my friend, but this further-that I never met any where with any person who, as I think, (did know).
Meno.
Did you never then meet with Gorgias, when he was here ?
Soc.
I did.
Meno.
And did he not seem to you to know ?
Soc.
I do not perfectly remember, Meno;
so that I am not able to say at present what I then thought of him.
But per­ haps both he knew himself, and you too, what he said.
Do you then bring to my recollection what he said;
or, if you would rather, tell it in your own words ;
for surely you agree with him in opinion.
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
Let us then put him aside;
especially as he is absent.
But, by the gods, do you, Meno, tell me yourself what you assert virtue to be;
and do not grudge me (the knowledge of it), in order that I may have uttered a most fortunate untruth, should both you and Gorgias appear (to know), what I said I had never met with a person (who did know).[3.]
Meno.
Nay, Socrates, it is by no means difficult to telL
In the first place, if you wish (me to tell) the virtue of a man, it is easy (to say) that a man's virtue consists in his being competent to manage the affairs of the state, and, man­ aging them, to do good to its friends, evil to its enemies, and to take care that he suffers himself nothing of that kind.
Then, if you wish to know the virtue of a woman, it is not difficult to go through (the particulars):
that it is to manage well the affairs of her family, to keep safe the things in the house, and to hearken to her husband.
Another kind of virtue is that of a child, either a girl or boy;
and of a man advanced in years;
and, if you choose (to go on), of a free-man and of a slave.
Many more virtues are there, of all kinds;
so that there is no want of power to tell concerning virtue, what it is.
For in every action, and in every age of life, and for every kind of business, there is ( a peculiar) virtue to each per­ son :
and similarly, Socrates, I think, there is (a peculiar) vice.
Soc.
I think myself greatly indeed favoured by fortune, Meno.
For, when I was only in quest of one virtue, I have found, it seems, a whole swarm of virtues hiving with you.
But with regard to this simile, taken from bees, had I, Meno, asked you respecting the nature of a bee, and you had told me that bees were many and various, what answer would you have given me, had I demanded of you further-Do you call them many and various, and differing one from another, in respect of their being bees;
or do they differ not in this respect, but with regard to something else, as beauty, or size, or any other thing of a like kind ?
Tell me, what answer would you have made, had you been so questioned ?
Meno.
I (would have answered) thus;
that so far as they are bees, they differ not at all one from another.
Soc.
Had I then afterwards said-Tell me now, Meno, con­ corning this very thing, in respect of which they do not differ, but are all the same;
what say you is this ?
Would you have had any thing to say ?[4.]
Soc.
Just so it is with the virtues.
Although they are many indeed, and of various kinds, yet they all agree in one and the same idea, through which they are virtues;
and to which it is well for him to look, who by his answer would point out to the inquirer what virtue happens to be.
Do you not comprehend what I am saying ?
Meno.
I think I do.
But I do not grasp, as I could wish, the question.
Soc.
Do you think only after this manner concerning virtue, that the virtue of a man is one thing, the virtue of a woman another thing, and so of the other virtues, (that they are all different) ?
or have you the same way (of thinking) as regards health, size, and strength ?
Do you consider the health of a man to be one thing, the health of a woman to be another ?
or is the same kind (of health) every where, wherever health is, whether it be in a man, or in any other subject whatever?
Meno.
The health of a man and of a woman, I think, is the same thing.
Soc.
(The same then applies to) size and strength.
A woman, if she be strong, is strong according to the same idea, and with the same strength, (as applies to a strong man).
By the same strength I mean this.
That whether strength be in a man, or in a woman, as regards the existence of strength, there is no difference;
or do you think there is a difference ?
Meno.
I think there is not.
Soc.
Will there be any difference in virtue, with respect to its being virtue, whether it be in a child or in an aged person, in a woman or in a man ?
Meno.
This case, Socrates, seems to me somehow to be not quite similar to the other.
Soc.
Why ?
Did you not tell me that the virtue of a man consisted in his well managing a state, and that of a woman, in well managing a household ?
Meno.
I did.
Soc.
Is it, then, possible to manage well a state or household, or any thing else whatever, without justice and prudence.
MenD.
By no means.
Soc.
If then the management be just and prudent, will not the managers manage with justice and with prudence ?
Meno.
They will of necessity.
Soc.
Both of them, therefore, the woman and the man, have need of the same things, (namely,) justice and prudence, if they are about to be good (managers).
Meno.
It appears so.10Soc.
What then, can a child, or an old man, ever be good, if dissolute and dishonest ?
Meno.
By no means.
Soc.
But only if sober and honest ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
All persons, surely, are good in the same way;
for they are good by possessing the same qualities.
Meno.
It seems so.
Soc.
Now, if virtue were not the same in them (all), they surely would not be good in the same way.
Meno.
They would not.[5.]
Soc.
Since then the virtue is the same in them all, endeavour to recollect and tell11 me, what says Gorgias of it, and you with him.
Meno.
What else is it than to be able to govern men ?
If you are in search of one thing, applicable to all (persons).
Soc.
It is the very thing I am in search of.
But is this then the same virtue of a child, Meno, and of a slave, to be able 12 to govern their master ?
Do you think that he who rules would be still a slave ?
Meno.
I do not think he would, Socrates, at all.
Soc.
For it is not reasonable, my very good (friend).
Con­ sider this again.13
You say (it is virtue) to be able to govern.
Shall we not subjoin the (word) justly, but not, unjustly.
Meno.
I think so.
For justice, Socrates, is virtue.
Soc.
Is it, Meno, virtue, or some virtue ?
Meno.
How say you this ?
Soc.
As respecting any thing else whatever.
For instance, if you please, respecting roundness, I would say that it is a figure, and not thus absolutely that it is figure.
And I should say so for this reason, because there are other figures.
Meno.
You would thus speak rightly.
Since I too myself not only say that justice is a virtue, but that there are other virtues.
Soc.
Say what these other (virtues) are;
as I would, were you to bid me, tell you other figures beside the round.
Do you then likewise mention to me other virtues beside justice.
Meno.
Well then, courage, I think, is a virtue, and tem­ perance, and wisdom, and a lofty bearing, and a great many other (qualities).
Soc. Again, Meno, we have met with the same thing as before.
We have again found many virtues, while in search of only one, but in a different way from that just now:
but the one virtue, which pervades all these, we are not able to find.[6.]
Meno.
For I am not able as yet, Socrates, to lay hold of one such virtue as you are seeking, applicable to all, as in the other instances.
Soc.
Probably so;
but I will show a readiness to urge our­ selves onward, if I can.
Already you apprehend, in some measure, that thus matters stand as regards every thing.
For had any person asked you, what was figure, the thing I just now mentioned, and you had said it was roundness, had he then said to you, as I did, Is roundness figure, or a figure ?
you would surely have said, It is a figure.
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
And for this reason, because there are other figures ?
Meno.
For that very reason.
Soc.
And had he asked you further, of what sort those other figures were, you would have told them.
Soc.
And had he asked you in the same manner concern­ ing colour, what it is ?
If you had answered, It is whiteness ;
would not the interrogator have taken you immediately up with this question-Is whiteness colour, or a colour ?
and you would have said, A colour;
because there happen to be other colours.
Soc.
And if he had bidden you to enumerate such other colours, you would have mentioned those, which happen to be colours no less than white.
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
If then he had pursued the argument as I do, and said—We are always getting into a multitude.
Do not (speak) thus to me.
But since you call all this multitude by one name, and assert that there is none of them which is not figure;
and this too, notwithstanding they are contrary to one another;
14 what 15 is this thing which comprehends the round as well as the straight, this to which you give the name of figure ;
and yet you say that the round is figure not more than the straight ?
or do you not say this ?
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
When you speak thus, do you mean that the round is not more round than is the straight ?
and that the straight is not more straight than is the round?
Meno.
I do not mean this, Socrates.
Soc.
But you mean that the round is not more a figure than is the straight, nor is this than the other.
MenD.
You say what is true.[7.]
Soc.
Endeavour then to tell me—What is that thing which is called by the name of figure ?
Now if to an inquirer in this way concerning figure, or colour, you had said, I do not comprehend what it is you would have, man, nor do I know what it is you mean:
he perhaps would have wondered, and said, Do you not comprehend that I am inquiring what is the same in all these?
Would you have had nothing to say even after this, Meno, had one inquired-What is that applicable to the round, and to the straight, and to the other things which you call figures, being the same for all ?
Endea­ vour to tell me what it is, in order that you may be ready, by practice, to give a reply to the question respecting virtue.
Meno.
Not so, Socrates ;
but do you yourself rather say what figure is.
Soc.
Would you have me oblige you in this point?
Meno.
By all means.
Soc.
Shall you then be willing to tell me what virtue is ?
Soc.
Let me then show my readiness;
for the cause is worthy of it.
Soc.
Come then;
let us try if we can tell you what figure is.
See if you can accept it, as being this.
Let then figure be that which of all things is the only one, that always hap­ pens to accompany colour.
Does this suffice you ?
or do you seek for any thing further ?
For I should be thus content, if you would tell me virtue.
ISMeno.
But, Socrates, this surely is silly.
Soc.
How so ?
Meno.
According to your account, figure is that which always accompanies colour.
Soc.
Be it so.16[8.]
Meno.
But should any person assert, that he knew not what colour was, and was equally at a loss concerning colour and concerning figure, what answer do you think you would have given him?
Soc.
That I had answered with truth.
And if the questioner happened to be one of the wise men, fond of dispute and contention, I would tell him—“ I had spoken;
and that, if I had not spoken rightly, it was your business to take up the discourse, and to refute me."
But if two parties, such as you and I here, were inclined to have a discourse together, as friends, they ought to answer each other in a milder and more conversational manner.
Now it is perhaps more conversa­ tional to answer not only truthfully, but in terms which the party questioned confesses he understands.
17
Accordingly, I shall now attempt to make you such a kind of answer.
For tell .me;
do you call a certain thing by the name of end ?
I mean such a thing as bound or extreme ?
For by all these words I mean the same thing.
Prodicus, indeed, might pos­ sibly differ from us;
but you at least would say, that a thing has been bounded, or, has had an end.
This is what I mean to say;
nothing many-coloured.
Meno.
Well, I do call (something end):
and I think I un­ derstand what you mean.
Soc.
And do you not call something a superficies ?
and another thing a solid ?
such as are in geometry.
Meno.
Yes, I do.
Soc.
Now then, from these (premises) you can understand what I mean by figure.
For in every figure, that which bounds the solid, I say, is figure;
which (idea) I would con­ cisely express by saying that figure is the bound of solid.[9.]
Meno.
And what say you colour is ?
Soc.
You are a saucy fellow, Meno.
You impose upon an old man the task of answering;
yet are unwilling yourself to recollect and tell (me) what Gorgias said that virtue was.
Meno.
But I will tell, after you have told me this, (what colour is).
Soc.
A man with his eyes hoodwinked might perceive from your way of conversing, Meno, that you are handsome, and still have your admirers.
Soc.
Because you do nothing but command in conversation;
as foppish IS fellows do, as being lordlings, so long as they are in the prime of beauty;
and at the same time you have per­ haps convicted me, as being subdued by beauty.
I will there­ fore gratify you and give an answer.
Meno.
By all means do gratify me.
Soc.
Do you wish me to answer like Gorgias,19 so that you may most easily follow me ?
Meno.
I do wish it.
How not ?
Soc.
Do not you and Gorgias say, according to Empedo­ cles,20 that certain effluvia proceed from bodies ?
Meno.
We do so firmly.
Soc.
And that there are certain pores, to which and through which those effluvia pass ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
And that of those effluvia, some are fitted to some of these pores, but that others are less or greater ?
Meno.
It is so.
Soc.
And do you not call something sight ?
Meno.
I do.
Soc. From these (premises) "Understand," as Pindar has said, " what I am saying."
Colour then is the flowing off from figures, agreeing with the sight, and by it perceived.
21Meno.
In this answer, Socrates, I think you have spoken as well as possible.
Soc.
(You say so) perhaps because this has been said ac­ cording to your habits;
and because at the same time you per­ ceive, I imagine, that you are able from thence to state what is sound,22 and smell, and many other things of the like kind.
Meno.
It really is so.
Soc.
The answer, Meno, was tragical ;
23 and so it was more agreeable to you than that relating to figure.
Soc.
And yet, son of Alexidemus, I persuade myself, that not this,24 but that, was the better answer.
I conceive too, that you would not have thought thus, unless, as you said yes­ terday, there was necessity for you to go away before the mysteries.
But if you could stay and be initiated, * * * 25Meno.
But if you would tell me many such things, I would certainly stay.
Soc.
In my best endeavours to say such things I shall not be wanting, for my own sake as well as yours.
But (I fear) I shall not be able to say much in that way. [10.]
But come now, and try yourself to perform your promise, by speak­ ing of virtue, what it is in general:
and cease making many out of one;
as persons say perpetually, when bantering those, who pound any thing to pieces ;
26 but leaving virtue whole and entire, tell me what it is.
Patterns of such a definition you have had from me.
Meno.
I think then, Socrates, that virtue is, as the poet says, In what is fair, to feel a joy, And (o'er it) to have power — and this, I say, is virtue-for him who has a desire for beau­ tiful things, to be able to obtain them.
Soc.
Do you mean that the person, who desires beautiful things, has a desire for good things ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
Is it that there are some who have a desire for evil things, and others, who have a desire for good things ?
Do you not think, my good (friend), that all men desire good things?
Soc.
But that some desire evil things ?
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
Say you that these men desire evil things, conceiving them to be good ?
or, knowing them to be evil, do they still desire them ?
MenD.
Both these events, I think, occur.
Soc.
Is there any man, think you, who, knowing evil things to be evil, yet nevertheless desires them ?
Soc.
What do you mean, by desiring them ?
Is it not that he may have them ?
Meno.
To have them.
For what else (can I mean) ?
Soc.
Does he imagine that evil things profit the person who has them, or does he know that evil things are hurtful, to whomsoever they are present ?
MenD.
There are those who think that evil things are profitable;
and those who know them to be hurtful.
Soc.
Do you think that they know evil things to be evil, who imagine such evil things to be profitable ?
Meno.
By no means do I think that.
Soc.
Is it not then evident, that those who do not desire evil things know not the nature of the things (they desire);
but (rather), that they desire things which they imagine to be good, but which are in reality evil ?
So that they, who are igno­ rant of them, and imagine them to be good, do, it is plain, desire good things.
Do they not ?
MenD.
They seem to be.
Soc.
But they who desire evil things, as you say, conceiv­ ing at the same time that evil things are hurtful to the pos­ sessor, surely know that they will be harmed by those (evil things).
MenD.
This must be.
Soc.
But do they not think, that such as are harmed are in an evil plight, so far as they are harmed ?
Meno.
This also must be.
Soc.
And that those in evil plight are unhappy ?
Meno.
Assuredly.
Soc.
Is there a man, then, who wishes to be in evil plight,27 and to be unhappy ?
Meno.
I think not any, Socrates.
Soc.
No man then, Meno, wishes for evils;
unless he wishes to be such.
For what else is it to be unhappy, than to desire evil things, and to possess them ?
Meno.
You are saying, Socrates, what is nearly true.
For28 no man wishes evil things.[11.]
Soc.
Did you not say just now, that virtue consisted in the wishing for, and having a power over, good things ?
Meno.
I did say so.
Soc.
From what has been said,29 is not this a wish to all men?
and in this respect one man is not better than another ?
Meno.
It appears so.
Soc.
But it is clear, that if one man is better than another, he would be so in respect of his power.
Meno.
Undoubtedly.
Soc.
This then, as it seems, according to your account, is virtue, the power of obtaining good things.
Meno.
The case seems to me, Socrates, to be entirely so, as you now understand it.
Soc.
Let us see then if this too you say truly:
for perhaps you will say well.
You say, that to be able to gain good things is virtue.
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
Do you not call good things such as health and wealth ?
And I say,30 to possess gold and silver, and honours in the state, and magistracies ?
You do not speak of any other things as good, except things of this kind ?
Meno.
No other ;
I mean all such sort of things.
Soc.
Well then, to get money is virtue;
as Meno says, the hereditary guest of the great king.3t But do you add to this (idea of) getting, (the ideas of) honesty and holiness ?
or is this a matter of indifference to you ;
but that, even if a person acquires them unjustly, you call the act32 equally virtue?
Meno.
By no means, Socrates ;
but (I call the act) wicked­ ness.
Soc.
By all means then there ought, as it appears, to be added to the act of acquisition justice, or prudence, or sanctity, or some other part of virtue;
for otherwise, it will not be vir­ tue, notwithstanding it procures for us good things.
Meno.
For without those how could it be virtue ?
Soc.
And to not obtain gold and silver, whether for himself or others, when the act is not just, is not this non-attainment likewise virtue ?
Meno.
It appears so.
Soc.
The attainment then of these good things, is not more virtue than the non-attainment;
but, as it seems, that which is combined with honesty, is virtue;
and that which is separ­ ated from all such things, is wickedness.
Meno.
I think it must of necessity be as you say.[12.]
Soc.
Did we not say a little while since, that honesty, and prudence, and every thing of that kind, was a part of virtue ?
Meno.
We did.
Soc.
Then,
Meno, you are playing with me.
Soc.
Because, when I just now desired you not to break down nor split virtue into fractions, and gave you patterns, by which you ought to answer, you have paid no regard to them, but you tell me that virtue is the power of gaining good things with justice;
yet this, you say, is only a part of virtue.
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
It follows then, from what you confess yourself, that to do whatever one does with a part of virtue, this is virtue.
For you say that justice, and each of those things (above-men­ tioned) is a part of virtue.
Meno.
What then ?
granting that I say this.
33Soc. (Truly) that, having been requested to tell me what the whole of virtue is, you are far from stating what it is;
but you say, that every act is virtue, if it is performed with a part of virtue;
as though you had already told me what virtue was in the whole, and that I should now know it, when you split it into fractions.
You have need therefore, as it seems to me, of the same question again from the beginning, friend Meno—What is virtue?
Or34 can every act, accompanied with a part of virtue, be said to be virtue itself?
For it is to say this, when one says that every act accompanied with jus­ tice is virtue.
Or do you think there is no need to you of the same question;
but do you think that one may know a part of virtue, what it is, without knowing virtue itself?
Meno.
I think he cannot.
Soc.
For, if you remember, when I gave an answer just now respecting figure, we rejected such a kind of answer, as attempted to reply by terms still the subject of inquiry, and not as yet confessedly understood.
Meno.
And we did rightly reject, Socrates.
Soc.
Do not then imagine, my very good (friend), while we are as yet inquiring what virtue is in the whole, that, by answering in terms relating to its parts, you will show clearly to any one virtue itself;
or, by speaking of any thing else in this very same manner;
but that there will be still need again of the same question-Respecting virtue-as being what,35 do you speak, what you speak ?
Or do you think that I am saying nothing (to the purpose) ?
Meno.
I think you are speaking correctly.[13.]
Soc. Answer then again, (as) from the beginning,- What do you and your friend say that virtue is ?
Meno.
I heard, Socrates, before I came together with you, that you (do) nothing else than doubt yourself, and cause others to doubt.
And you seem to be now playing a wizard's tricks, and to drug me, and really use incantations so as to fill me with doubts.
And, if I too must banter a little, I think you resemble exactly, both in form and in other respects also, that broad sea-fish, called the torpedo;
for that too produces a numbness in the person whoever approaches and touches it.36
You seem to have done some such thing at present to me, [to benumb 37 me].
For in very truth I am benumbed, both in mind and mouth,38 and I have not what reply to give you.
And yet I have spoken very many discourses ten thousand times about virtue, and to many persons, and ex­ tremely well too, as I thought myself;
but now I have it not in my power at all to tell what (virtue) is.
I think that you have consulted well for yourself in never sailing out from hence nor travelling abroad.
For if you were as a stranger to act in this manner in another city, you would perhaps be driven thence39 as a wizard.
Soc.
You are full of craftiness, Meno, and you have nearly put a cheat upon me.
Meno.
How particularly so, Socrates ?
Soc.
I know why you brought a simile against me.
Meno.
Why think you ?
Soc.
That I might bring a simile against you in return.
For this I know respecting all handsome persons, that they love to have likenesses made of them.
For it is to their in­ terest ;
since of handsome persons the pictures too are hand­ some.
But I will not draw your likeness in return.
As to myself, if the torpedo be thus numb itself, and produces a numbness in others also, then am I like to it;
but if other­ wise, I am not.
For I do not, when not doubting myself, cause others to doubt;
but rather when I am in doubt myself, I in like manner cause others to doubt.
And now respect­ ing virtue, what it is, I know not:
you, however, knew it formerly;
perhaps, before you had touched me.
But now you are like one,40 who knows nothing of the matter.'
I am desirous, however, of looking into the matter with you, and of searching out jointly, what (virtue) is.[14.]
Meno.
But in what way, Socrates, will you search for a thing, which you do not know at all, what, it is?
For by placing before you what of the things, which you do not.
know, will you seek it ?
Or, if you should fall in with it, how will you know that this is the thing, of which you were ignorant ?
Soc.
I understand, Meno, what you mean to say.
See you, how captious a method of reasoning you introduce?
That it is impossible for a man to seek, either what he does know, or does not know.
For no man would seek what he knows;
because he knows it already;
and for such a person there is no need of seeking.
Nor (would any man seek) what he knows not;
because he does not know what he would seek.
Meno.
Do you then, Socrates, think that this way of reason­ ing is not fair ?
Soc.
I think it not (fair).
Meno.
Can you say in what way ?
Soc.
I can.
For I have heard men and women wise in divine matters-Meno.
Saying what ?
Soc.
Things,
I think, true and fair.
Meno.
What were they ?
and who said them ?
Soc.
They, who said them, were belonging to the priests and priestesses;
whose business it is, and who are able to give a reason for the things to which they put their hands.
Pindar, too, and many other of the poets, such as are divine, say them;
and what they say is this.
But do you consider whether you think they speak the truth.
For they say that the soul of man is immortal;
and at one time it ends, which they call dying;
and that another it exists again;
but is never de­ stroyed ;
and that for this reason we ought to live throughout our lives as holy as possible.
"
To them, from whom has Proserpine received the payment for an ancient act of grief, she in the ninth year does give back their souls to the upper sun;
and from them41 kings in splendour, and through their strength swift-footed, and in wisdom men mightiest increase, and heroes are called holy by mankind in future times."[15.]
The soul then, as being immortal, and born fre­ quently, and having seen both the things here, and those in Hades, and42 all things, there is nothing it has not learned;
so that it is no wonder that it is able to recollect, with regard to virtue and other things, what it formerly knew.
For the whole of nature being of one kindred, and the soul having heretofore known all things, there is nothing to prevent a person, who remembers-what men call learning-only one thing, from discovering again all the rest;
if he has but courage, and seeking faints not.
For to search and to learn is reminiscence all.
We must not, therefore, submit to that captious way of reasoning, for it would make us idle;
since to persons of a soft nature it is pleasant to hear it;
whereas this makes men active and inquiring ;
and which I believing to be true, I am willing with you to seek out what virtue is.
Meno.
With all my heart, Socrates.
But how43 say you this, that we do not learn, but that what we call learning is reminiscence ?
Have you it in your power to teach me that this is so ?
Soc.
Even just now I said, Meno, that you are very crafty.
Since now you ask me, if I have the power to teach you;
I, who say there is not teaching, but (only) remini­ scence ;
so that I may appear directly to contradict myself.
Meno.
Not so, Socrates, by Jupiter.
I did not say so with an eye to this;
but (merely) from habit.
But if any way you can prove to me that things are as you assert, prove it.
Soc.
This is no easy task.
However, for your sake, I am willing to show my readiness.
Call hither to me then one of your numerous attendants here, whomever you please, that through him I may give you the proof.
Meno.
Most readily.
Come hither, you.
Soc.
Is he a Greek, and speaks he Greek?44Meno.
Perfectly well, as he was born in the family.
Soc.
Now then pay attention, and (mark) whether be appears to recollect himself, or to learn from me.
Meno.
I will be attentive.[16.]
Soc.
Tell me, boy, do you know that a four-angled space is such as this ?45Boy.
I do.
Soc.
A four-angled space then has all these lines, being four equal.
Boy.
Certainly.
Soc.
Has it not also these lines through the middle of it equal ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
Could there be a space like this, larger and less ?
Boy.
Certainly.
Soc.
Now if this side were two feet, and this two, how many feet would there be in the whole ?
Consider it in this manner.
If, on46 this (side) the space were two feet, and on this only one foot, would the space be other than47 of two feet once (told) ?
Boy.
It would (not).
48Soc.
But since it is two feet on this side likewise, is it any other space than of twice two feet ?
Boy. No.Soc.
It is then (a space) of twice two feet ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
How many feet are twice two ?
reckon, and tell me.
Boy.
Four feet, Socrates.
Soc.
Cannot there be another space, the double of this (in size), but of the same kind, having, like this, all its sides equal ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
Of how many feet will it be ?
Boy.
Eight.
Soc.
Come now, endeavour to tell me, how long will each line of this (space) be ?
Now of this (space) the line is two feet.
What (will be) the length of the line of (the space) double the size ?
Boy.
It is plain, Socrates, that it (will be) double (the length).
Soc.
You see, Meno, that I teach this (boy)49 nothing, but only question him about all.
And now this boy thinks he knows of what length is the line from which a space of eight feet is produced.
Do you not think he does ?
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
And does he (really) know?
Meno.
Certainly not.
Soc.
But he thinks he does from (the idea of) a doubled (quantity).
Soc.
View him now recollecting in order (things) as he should recollect. [17.]
Now speak to me, (boy).
You say that from a line, double in length, there is produced a space double in size:
I mean a space of this kind;
not one side long, the other short;
but let it be equal on every side, like this, but twice the size of eight feet.
See now, whether you still think this will be from the doubled (line).
Boy.
I do.
Soc.
Does not this become the double of that, if we add another from this point ?
Boy.
Yes, surely.
Soc.
Now, from this (line), you say that there will be a space of eight feet, if there be four such lines ?
Boy.
I do.
Soc.
Let us then draw from it four equal lines.
Would this space be any other than that which you say is of eight feet ?
Boy.
Not at all.
Soc.
Are there not in this space these four spaces, each of which is equal to that of four feet ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
How large is become the whole space ?
Is it not four times as large ?
Boy.
How not ?
Soc.
Is that two-fold which is taken four times ?
Boy.
No, by Jupiter.
Soc.
How many fold ?
Boy.
Four-fold.
Soc.
From a line, therefore, double in length, there is pro­ duced a space, not two-fold, but four-fold.
Boy.
You say true.
Soc.
Four times four is sixteen:
is it not ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
But from what line is (to be drawn) a space of eight' (square) feet ?
Is it not from this four-fold ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
And from the half of this line (there is drawn) this space of four feet50 (square).
Boy.
There is.
Soc.
Well;
but is not that (square of) eight feet twice as large as this, and half as large as that ?
Boy.
Certainly.51Soc.
Will it not be from a line longer than this, and shorter than that ?
Boy.
So at least it appears to me.
Soc. (You say) correctly;
for answer only what appears to you.
And tell me this too.
Was not this line two feet, and that four?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
The line therefore of the eight-foot space must be greater than this of two feet, but less than that of four feet.
Boy.
It must be.
Soc.
Try now, and tell me how long you think it is.
Boy.
Three feet long.
Soc.
If then it be three feet, we will add the half of this (line), and now this will be three feet.
For these are two (feet), and this is one foot:
and in the same manner, these are two (feet), and this is one;
and this space becomes such as you say.
Boy.
It is so.
Soc.
If then this line here be three feet, and that here three feet, the whole space becomes thrice three feet.
Boy.
It appears so.
Soc.
And how many feet are thrice three ?
Boy.
Nine.
Soc.
But how many feet ought the doubled space (above mentioned) to be ?
Boy.
Eight.
Soc.
Hence from a line three feet (long) there is not (to be drawn) the space (above mentioned) of eight feet.
Boy.
There is not.
Soc.
But from how long a line?
Endeavour to tell me exactly.
Or, if you do not like to give it in numbers,52 at least point out from what line (it may be drawn).
Boy.
By Jove, Socrates, I do not know.[18.]
Soc.
Do you observe again, Meno, whither53 this boy is proceeding in (the road to) recollection ?
since at first he knew not what is the line of the (above-mentioned) space of eight feet;
as, indeed, he does not yet know;
but he then fancied he knew it, and answered boldly, as a knowing person would, nor did he think he should be at a loss.
•
But he now deems himself at a loss, and, as he knows not, does not even think he knows.
Meno.
You say what is true.
Soc.
Is he not then in a better state now as regards the matter of which he was ignorant ?
Meno.
This too appears to me.
Soc.
In causing him then to be at a loss, and to be be­ numbed, as is the torpedo, have we done him any harm ?
Meno.
None, I think.
Soc.
We have at least made some progress, as it seems, towards his finding out where he is.
For now, knowing no­ thing, he would readily search.
But he then fancied he could readily, before many persons and often, say respecting the (above-mentioned) doubled space, that it ought to have a line twice as long.
Meno.
So it seemed.
Soc.
Think you, then, that he would have attempted to seek or learn that, of which, though ignorant, he fancied he knew it, before he had fallen into a difficulty,54 by conceiving he did not know, and had felt a desire to know ?
Meno.
I do not think, Socrates, he would.
Soc.
He was benefited, then, by being benumbed.
Meno.
I think so.
Soc.
Now mark what, after this difficulty, he will discover by searching with me, (doing) nothing else but asking ques­ tions, and not teaching.
And watch me, if any where you can discover me teaching or telling him any thing, and not asking him rather his own opinions. [19.]
Now, boy, tell me, is not this space four feet ?
Do you comprehend ?
Boy.
I do.
Soc.
Now we will apply to it this other (space) equal to it.
Boy.
Well.
Soc.
And this a third (space) equal to either of these?
Boy.
Very well.
Soc.
What if we add this (space), likewise (equal),55 to fill up the corner here.
Boy.
Very well.
Soc.
Will these be any thing else than these four equal spaces ?
Boy. No.Soc.
Well then, how much larger is this whole space than that?
Boy.
Four times.
Soc.
But we wanted one only twice as large.
Or do you not remember ?
Boy. (I remember it) very well.
Soc.
Does not this line from corner to some56 corner, cut each of these spaces in half?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
Are not therefore these four lines equal, which en­ close this space ?
Boy.
They are.
Soc.
Consider then, how large is this space.
Boy.
I do not comprehend.
Soc.
Has not each (line) of each (space) cut off within it half of these four (spaces) ?
or not ?
Boy.
They have.
Soc.
How many such (spaces) then are there in this (figure) ?
Boy. Four.Soc.
And how many in this (figure) ?
Soc..
How much of two is four?
Boy.
Twice as much.
57Soc.
How many feet then does this (space) become ?
Boy.
Eight.
Soc.
Drawn from what line ?
Boy.
From this here.
Soc.
From the line reaching from corner to corner of the space of feet ?
Boy.
Yes.
Soc.
Now the sophists call such a line the diameter;
so that, if the diameter be its name,58 from the diameter, as you, Meno's boy, assert, there can be produced a space twice as large.
Boy.
Assuredly, Socrates.[20.]
Soc.
Well, what think you, Meno?
Is there an opi­ nion, which he has given in his answers, that is not his own ?
Meno.
None, but his own.
Soc.
And yet, as we said a little before, he knew nothing.
Soc.
Yet these very opinions existed in him.
Or did they not?
Meno.
They did.
Soc.
In a man, therefore, who is ignorant, there exist true opinions concerning those very things of which he is ignorant.
59Meno.
So it appears.
Soc.
These very opinions then have been lately stirred up afresh in him, as if it were a dream.
And should any one I put questions to him respecting these same matters at many times and in many places, be assured he will at length know them not less accurately than any man.
Meno.
It seems so.
Soc.
Will he not then, without any one having taught him, and by some one putting questions, recover, himself through himself, his (former) knowledge ?
Meno.
He will.
Soc.
Now for a person to recover knowledge, himself through himself, is not this to recollect ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
And this knowledge, which he now possesses, he has either at some time acquired, or has possessed it always ?
Soc.
If then he was always possessed of it, he was always a person of knowledge.
But if he acquired it at any time, he would not have got it in the present life;
or has some one taught him geometry?
For he will act in the very same manner with regard to the whole of geometry, and all other matters of learning.
Is there any one then who has taught the boy all this?
(I ask you);
for you ought to know, especially since he was born and bred up in your family.
Meno.
I know well that no person has ever taught him.
Soc.
And yet he entertains these very opinions;
does he not ?[21.]
Meno.
There appears, Socrates, the necessity.
6o Soc.
If, having got (this knowledge), not in this present life, he did not know this,60 it is plain that he possessed it in some other time and had learnt it.
Meno.
It appears so.
Soc.
And is not then that the time, when he was not a man ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
If then, during the time when be is, and during the time when he is not a man, true opinions exist in him, which, roused up by questioning, become knowledge, will not his soul have learnt through eternity ?
for it is plain, that during all time he either is, or is not a man.
Meno.
It appears so.
Soc.
If then the truth of things, that are, exists always in the soul, the soul would be immortal;
so that, whatever you happen now not to know, that is, not to remember, you ought to attempt with confidence to seek, and to recollect.
Meno.
You seem to me, Socrates, I know not how, to speak rightly.
Soc. And I (seem) to myself too, Meno.
And yet in other respects I would not contend very strenuously in defence of my argument;
but that in thinking we ought to seek the things which one does not know, we should become better and more manly, and less idle, than if we supposed it impos­ sible for us to find out, and that it did not behove us to inquire into what we know not;
for this I would, if I were able, violently contest both by word and deed.
Meno.
In this also, Socrates, you seem to me to say well.[22.]
Soc.
Since then we are of one mind, that a person ought to inquire after what he does not know, are you will­ ing for us to attempt jointly to inquire what is virtue ?
Meno.
By all means.
Not but that I should with the greatest pleasure take into consideration, and hear you on the question I first asked you, whether we must put our hand to the inquiry about virtue as a thing to be taught, or as com­ ino, by nature, or by some other means to man.
Soc.
Had I been master not only of myself, but of you too, Meno, we would not have considered whether virtue is a thing to be taught or not, before we had ascertained what is the first in­ quiry, what virtue is.
But since you do not even attempt to master yourself in order that you may be a free-man, and yet undertake to govern me, and actually do govern me, I shall yield to you.
For what must I do ?
We are to consider then, it seems, what belongs to a certain thing, whilst yet we know not what the thing is.
But do you relax if not some,61 yet a little, the strictness of your rule, and agree to consider by­ pothetically, whether virtue can be taught to a man, or how otherwise (it is to be attained).
I say hypothetically as geo­ metricians often do in treating a question;
when one asks them, as it were, about a spacer whether it is possible for this space to be placed 63 triangularly64 within this, a (geometrician) would answer,—I know not as yet, of what kind 65 the triangle is ;
but I think I have, as it were,66 an hypothesis, that may be of use for the matter (in hand) of this kind.
-If the space be of such a kind, as that by stretching 67 along the line given there, it would be deficient by such a space as would be the space itself stretched along, there would, I think, be one re­ suit ;
68 but another, if this (hypothesis) were impossible to oc­ cur.
Laying down then an hypothesis, I am willing to tell you what will happen respecting the placing of it ( the space) within the circle, whether it be impossible or not.—[23.]
And thus too concerning virtue, since we know not, either what it is, or what is its quality, we will lay down an hypothesis, and con­ sider whether it is to be taught or not, by stating the question thus.
If virtue be in its quality one of things, which belongs to the soul, is it to be taught, or not to be taught ?
In the first place, if it is either different from knowledge, or of the same kind with it, is virtue or is it not to be taught, or (as we said just now) to be recollected;
for whichever of these expressions we use, let it make no difference to us.
Is then virtue to be taught ?
Now is it not evident to every one, that a man is taught no other thing than knowledge ?
Meno.
To me it seems so.
Soc.
If then virtue be a kind of knowledge, it is evident that virtue is to be taught.
Soc.
From this question then we have been quickly re­ lieved, that, if virtue be such a kind of thing (as knowledge), it is to be taught;
but not, if it be not such a kind of thing.
Meno.
Very true.
Soc.
Next after this, it seems, we must consider whether virtue be knowledge or apart from knowledge.
Meno.
We must, I think, consider this in the next place.
Soc.
Well now;
say we that virtue is any thing else but a good;
and shall we abide by this hypothesis, that virtue is a good ?
Meno.
By all means.
Soc.
Now if there be also any other good apart from know­ ledge, then perhaps virtue may not be a kind of knowledge.
But if there be no good which knowledge does not compre­ hend, then in suspecting virtue to be a kind of knowledge we should suspect justly.
Meno.
It is so.
Soc.
And yet through virtue at least we are good.
MenD. Yes.
Soc.
And if good, then useful.
For all things that are good are useful:
are they not ?
Soc.
Virtue then is a thing useful.
Meno.
It must needs be, from what has been admitted.[24.]
Soc.
Now let us consider what sort of things, taking each by itself, are useful to us:
health, we say, and strength, and beauty, and wealth.
These things and others of a like kind we call useful:
do we not ?
Meno.
We do.
Soc.
And say we not that these very things are sometimes hurtful to us ?
or do you say otherwise ?
or thus ?
Meno. Not (otherwise) ;
but thus.
Soc.
Consider now, at what time is any one of each of these things, when it leads, useful to us;
and at what time is it hurtful.
Is it not, when a right use (leads), it is useful to us, but when not, it is hurtful ?
Meno.
Certainly so.
Soc.
Further then let us consider the things belonging to the soul.
You call something by the name of temperance, and of justice, and of fortitude, and of docility, and of memory, and of high bearing, and of all such things.
Meno.
I do.
Soc.
Now consider such of these things, as you think to be not knowledge, but apart from knowledge, whether they are not sometimes hurtful, and sometimes useful ?
for in­ stance, unless prudence is present, fortitude is only a kind of boldness.
Is not a man hurt, when he is bold without reason?
but when he is bold with reason, is he not bene­ fited ?69Soc.
Is it not so with temperance, and docility ?
Are not things learnt and prepared (for use) with understanding use­ ful, but without understanding hurtful ?
Meno.
Very much so.
Soc.
In a word, do not all the endeavours and endurings of the soul, when prudence leads, tend to happiness;
but if imprudence leads, to the reverse ?
Meno.
It seems so.
Soc.
If virtue then be one of those things belonging to the soul, and if it is necessary, as you say, for it to be useful, it must be prudence:
since all the things belonging to the soul are of themselves neither useful nor hurtful;
but imprudence or prudence being added, they become hurtful or useful.
Now according to this reasoning it must needs be that virtue, being useful, is a kind of prudence.
Meno.
So it seems to me.[25.]
Soc.
Now then as to the other things, which we said just now were sometimes beneficial and sometimes hurtful, both wealth and the things of that kind:
does not prudence, when leading the rest of the soul, make the things belonging to the soul useful, but imprudence hurtful?
and in like manner does not the soul, by rightly using and leading them, render them useful, but by (using) wrongly, hurtful ?
Meno.
Most certainly.
Soc.
And does not a prudent soul rightly lead, but an im­ prudent one, incorrectly ?
Meno.
Such is the fact.
Soc.
Thus then we may say universally, that in the case of man all the other things70 depend on his soul;
but the things belonging to the soul itself depend on prudence, if they are to be beneficial.
And by this reasoning prudence would be the useful.
But we said that virtue was useful.
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
We assert therefore that prudence is virtue, either wholly, or in part.
Meno.
What has been said seems to me, Socrates, to have been well said.
Soc.
If then it be so, the good are not good71 by nature.
Meno.
It seems to me, they are not.
Soc.
For then this too would follow.
If the good were good by nature we should have some where persons, who knew of our youths the naturally good;
over whom, when those had shown them to us, we should place a guard in the citadel, putting a seal on them, rather than on gold, so that no person might corrupt them, and that, when they, arrived at manhood, they might become useful to the state.
MenD.
It were reasonable (to do so), Socrates.[26.]
Soc.
Since then the good are not good by nature, are they by learning ?
Meno.
I think this is of necessity so.
And it is plain, Socrates, that if, according to the hypothesis, virtue is a science, it is to be taught.
Soc. Perhaps so, by Jove.
But did we admit that correctly ?
Meno.
And yet it lately seemed to be fairly said.
Soc.
But I suspect, it ought not only to have seemed lately to be said fairly, but to seem so at present, and hereafter too, if there be any thing sound in it.
Meno.
What is the matter now ?
looking to what are you dissatisfied with it ?
and why doubt that virtue is a science ?
Soc.
I will tell you, Meno.
That virtue is to be taught, if it be a science, is a position I do not retract,72 (so to say) that it has not been correctly asserted.
But consider whether I appear to reasonably doubt, that virtue is a science.
For tell me this.
If any thing is to be taught, not virtue only, must there not be of necessity both teachers and scholars ?
Meno.
I think there must.
Soc.
Hence, on the contrary, that, of which there are neither teachers nor scholars, should we conjecture rightly, in conjecturing it is not to be taught ?
Meno.
Such is the fact.
But do you not think that there are teachers of virtue ?
Soc.
After a lengthened inquiry, whether there were any teachers of virtue, I cannot, with all my efforts, discover any.
And yet do I make the search with many, and those, too, whom I think would be the most skilled in the matter.
And just now, Meno, in happy time has Anytus73 sat down here by us, to whom we can give a share in the search.
And with reason should we give him a share.
For, in the first place, he is the son of the wealthy and the wise Anthemion, a man who has become rich, not by accident, nor yet by a gift from any one, as Ismenias74 of Thebes has done, who has lately obtained the property of Polycrates, but having acquired his wealth by his own wisdom and carefulness;
and secondly, as regards his other qualities, he is a citizen deemed to be neither haughty nor puffed up, nor overbearing, but to conduct him­ self like a decent and well-behaved man;
and then, he has brought up and educated his son here very well, in the opinion of the Athenian multitude;
for they elect him to the highest offices in the state.
With such men it is right then to make a search after teachers of virtue, whether there are any or not, and who they are. [27.]
Do you then, Anytus, unite with me, and Meno here, your guest, in our search after this very thing, as to who are the teachers of it.
Now consider the matter in this way.
If we wished this Meno to become a good physician, to what teachers should we send him ?
Should we not send him to the physicians ?
Anytus.
By all means.
Soc.
And if we wished to make him a good currier, should we not send him to the curriers ?
Any.
To be sure.
Soc.
And so as regards the rest of subjects ?
Any.
Without doubt.
Soc.
But concerning the same things tell me again this.
In sending him to the physicians we say we should do well, if we wished to make him a good physician.
Now when we say this, do we not mean, that we should act with prudence in sending him to those, who make that art their profession, rather than to those who do not;
and who making for them­ selves a remuneration for this very thing, put themselves forth as the teachers of any one willing to go and learn.
Is it not from looking to these matters that we should do well in send­ ing him ?
Any.
Yes.
Soc.
Hence in the case of music, and the other (arts),.
the same things (take place).
And it is a great folly for us, if we wish to make any one a flute-player, to be willing to send him not to such as profess to teach the art, and to make money by it;
but, to give trouble to some other persons, and to look for his learning from those, who do not profess to be teachers, and have not one pupil in that branch of instruction, which we think proper that the person, whom we send, should learn.
Does not this seem to you to be very unreasonable ?
Any.
Yes, by Jupiter, and ignorance to boot.[28.]
Soc.
You say well.
Now then you may consult in common with me about this guest of yours, Meno here.
For he told me some while ago, Anytus, that he had a longing for that wisdom and virtue, through which men govern well both their household and the state, and pay attention to their pa­ rents, and know how to receive both their countrymen and foreigners, and to send them away in a manner worthy of a good man.
Consider then, to what persons (about to teach) 75 this virtue, should we in sending him correctly send.
Is it not clear that, according to the reasons (detailed) just now, (we should send him) to those who profess to be teachers of virtue, and publicly proffer themselves common to any one of the Greeks desirous to learn;
after fixing the price, and making it a matter of business.
Any.
Of what persons, Socrates, are you speaking ?
Soc.
You surely know that these are they whom men call sophists.
Any. 0 Hercules!
speak fair words, Socrates.
On none of my relations, or family, or friends, or fellow-citizens, or foreign guests, may ever such a madness seize, as to go and be spoiled by them.
For those fellows are clearly the bane and corruption of their associates.
Soc.
How say you, Anytus ?
Are they the only men among those who, so widely different from all the rest, profess the knowledge of doing something beneficial, and yet do not only not improve, as others do, what one puts into their hands, but on the contrary, spoil it ?
and do they think fit openly to make money for themselves for this ? [29.]
For my part, I know not how to believe you.
For I know that one man, Protagoras (by name), has acquired singly more wealth from this wisdom, than both 76 Phidias, who has produced works so conspicu­ ously beautiful, and ten other statuaries besides.
Indeed it is a prodigy you are telling me;
if when the menders of old shoes and the patchers of old clothes could not escape for thirty days from being publicly known, if they returned the clothes or shoes in a worse condition than they received them, and if they did so, they would soon perish by hunger ;
yet, that Pro­ tagoras should undiscovered corrupt the whole of Greece by sending away his associates even worse men than he received them, and this for above forty years.
For I think he was near seventy years of age when he died, after having passed forty in his profession.
And during all that time he never ceased being in high repute, even to this day;
and not only Protagoras (met with this success), but very many others, some born prior to him, and some still living.
Shall we then say, according to your account, that they knowingly deceived and corrupted the youth, or that they did so unconscious of it to themselves ?
Shall we deem those to be so much out of their senses, who, some say, were the wisest of mankind ?
Any.
They are far from being out of their senses, Socrates.
Much rather so are those youths, who give them money ;
and still more so than the youths are their relations in committing them to such men;
but most so of all are the states that suffer them to come thither, and do not drive out a person, whether foreigner or citizen, who endeavours to do any such thing.[30.]
Soc.
Has any of the sophists done you, Anytus, any injury?
or why are you so hard upon them?
Any.
I have never, by Jupiter, associated with one of them myself;
nor would I suffer any person who belonged to me to do so.
Soc.
You have no experience at all then of those men.
Any.
And never may I have.
Soc.
How then should you know, 0 happy man, respect­ ing this matter, whether it has any good or harm, when you have no experience of it at all ?
Any.
Easily enough.
For I know what sort 77 of fellows they are, whether I have any experience or not of them.
Soc.
Perhaps you are a prophet, Anytus.
Since how other­ wise you could know respecting them, I should, from what you say yourself much wonder.
But we were not inquiring, what the persons are, to whom Meno might go, and become a bad man.
For let these, if you will, be the sophists.
But now speak to us of those others;
and do an act of kindness to this hereditary friend of yours, by telling him to what per­ sons in this great city he may go and become worthy of note for that virtue which I was just now detailing.
Any.
But why did you not tell him yourself ?
Soc.
What persons I conceived to be the teachers of these things I have told already.
But I happen to have said no­ thing (to the purpose), as you inform me.
78 And perhaps there is something in what you say.
78 Now, therefore, do you in your turn tell him to whom of the Athenians he should go.
Mention the name of whomsoever you like.[31.]
Any.
What need is there of hearing the name of any one man ?
For whomsoever of the men of honour and virtue among the Athenians he may meet, there is not one of them who would not make him a better man, than the sophists would, if he will be but persuaded.
Soc.
But did these men of honour and virtue become such spontaneously, and without having learnt from any man (to be so) ?
and are they able to teach others, what they were never taught themselves ?
Any.
They, I presume, learnt from their predecessors, being men of honour and virtue.
Or think you that many excellent men have not been produced in this city ?
Soc.
I think, Anytus, that there are in this city men excel­ lent in political affairs, and that there have been still not less so than there are.
But were they good teachers of their own virtue ?
For it is this, about which our present discourse happens to be;
not whether good men are at present here or not;
nor whether such have been produced formerly;
but whether virtue is to be taught or not, we have been for a long time considering:
and in considering that question, we are come to consider this, whether those excellent men, either of the present or former (day), knew how to hand over to another that virtue, by which they themselves were good;
or whether this cannot be handed over to, or received by, one man from another.
This it is, which we have been long examining, I and Meno. [32.]
Consider then the question in this manner, according to your own argument.
Would you not say that Themistocles was a good man ?
Any.
Yes, the best of all.
Soc.
And would you not then (say), that, if ever any other man was the teacher of his own virtue, he was one ?
Any.
I suppose so, if he wished it.
Soc.
But would he not have wished, think you, for some others to become men of honour and virtue, and especially his own son ?
Or do you think that he envied his son, and did de­ signedly not band.
over to him that virtue, in which he himself was excellent?
Have you not heard that Themistocles caused79 his son Cleophantus to be taught to be 80 a good horseman ?
For example, he remained standing upright upon horses, and upright (too) upon horses he threw a javelin, and performed many other surprising feats, in which his father had caused him to be instructed;
and that he made him skilled in such accomplishments as are connected with the having good teachers ?
Have you not heard this from the elderly people ?
Any.
I have heard it.
Soc.
No one then would have accused his son of being of an evil nature.
Any.
Perhaps not.
Soc.
But what is this ?
That Cleophantus, the son of The­ mistocles, became a good and a wise man, as did his father, have you ever heard this from any person, either young or old ?
Any.
No indeed.
Soc.
Do we imagine then that he wished to bring up his own son in such studies, and yet, in the wisdom where he himself was wise, not to make his son at all better than his neighbours, if virtue could be taught ?
Any.
By Jove, perhaps not.[33.]
Soc.
Such a teacher of virtue then is this one of yours, whom you yourself acknowledge to have been amongst the best men of former times.
And now let us consider an­ other, Aristides, the son of Lysimachus.
Do you not confess that he was a good man ?
Any.
I do entirely.
Soc.
And did not he too give his son Lysimachus81 the best education at Athens, so far as depended on teachers?
and do you think he made him a better man than any one whatsoever?
For you have associated with him, and you see what sort of a man he is.82
But if you wish (another), you know that Pericles, a man of such lofty bearing and wisdom, bred up his two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus.
Any.
I do.
Soc.
These, as you know yourself, he taught to be horse­ men not inferior to any of the Athenians;
and he instructed them in music and gymnastics, and the rest of accomplish­ ments that depend on art, so as to be inferior to none.
But had he no wish to make them good men ?
I believe he had the wish;
but I suspect it to be impossible (to teach virtue).
And that you may not think that a few persons, and the most humble in means83 of the Athenians, were incompetent for such an affair, consider that Thucydides84 likewise brought up his two sons, Melesias and Stephanus, and educated them well in other respects, and particularly in wrestling the best of the Athenians.
For he intrusted one to Xanthias, and the other to Eudorus;
and these (two) were thought to be the best wrestlers of that time.
Do you not remember this ?
Any.
I do by hearsay.[34].
Soc.
Is it not plain then, that he would never have taught his children those things, in the teaching of which he must have been put to expense, and not have taught them to be good men, which would have required him to spend nothing, if such a thing could be taught?
But Thucydides perhaps was of very humble means, and had not very many friends among the Athenians and their allies.
(It was not so.)
For he was of a noble family, and had great influence in the city and in the other Grecian states;
so that if this could be taught, he might have found out a person, either one of his own countrymen or a foreigner, who might have made his sons virtuous, if, through his superintendence of the state, he had no leisure himself.
But I fear, friend Anytus, that virtue is a thing not to be taught.
Any.
You seem to me, Socrates, to speak ill of persons with great facility.
But I would advise you, if you are willing to hearken to me, to be on your guard.
For in another city too it is perhaps more easy to do a man mischief than good;
but in this it is especially so;
and I think you are sensible of it yourself.[35.]
Soc. Anytus seems to me to be angry, Meno.
And I am not at all surprised at it.
For, in the first place, he thinks I am speaking ill of those very persons;
and then he considers himself to be one of them.
But if he should ever know what it is to speak ill (of others), he will cease to be angry;
but at present he is ignorant of it.
Do you then tell me, are there not amongst us men of honour and virtue ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
And are these men willing to offer themselves to youths as teachers ?
and to confess both that they are teachers and that virtue is to be taught ?
Meno.
By Jupiter, Socrates, they do not.
But you may hear them (saying) at one time that it is to be taught, at another, not.
Soc.
Shall we say then that these men are teachers of that thing, about which they are not agreed ?
Meno.
I think not, Socrates.
Soc.
Well;
but do those sophists, who alone proclaim themselves teachers, appear to you to be so ?
Meno.
It is for this, Socrates, that I especially admire Gorgias, because you would never hear him making such professions.
On the contrary, he laughs at the others, when­ ever he hears them making such a promise;
and conceives that he ought to make men powerful in speaking.
Soc.
Do not then the sophists seem to you to be teachers ( of virtue) ?
Meno.
I know not, Socrates, what to say.
For I have suffered myself, what the many do.
Sometimes I think they are, and sometimes, not.
Soc.
But you know, that not only to yourself and the others versed in civil affairs, it seems at one time that this is to be taught, and at another, not;
and you know that the poet Theognis says the very same thing.[36.J
Soc.
In his Elegiacs ;
85 where he says, With some drink thou and eat, and with some sit, And pleasant be to those, whose power's far known:
Good from the good thou'lt learn;
but with the bad Mixing, thou'lt lose the good thoughts once thine own.
Do you perceive that in these (verses) he speaks of virtue as a thing to be taught ?
Meno.
So it appears.
Soc.
And yet in other verses he says, passing on a little further, that If wisdom could be made and placed in man, they, who could accomplish this, Many and great rewards would carry off;
and From a good sire no bad son e'er wOUld come, To words of wisdom listening;
but thou'lt ne'er
By teaching make the bad a virtuous man.
Do you observe, that in speaking upon the same subjects, he contradicts himself ?
Meno.
So it appears.
Soc.
Can you tell me then of any other thing whatever, of which they, who profess to be teachers, are not only not held by others to be teachers, but who (confess) to be ignorant of it themselves, and who act like knaves in that very thing, which they profess to teach ;
and where they, who are allowed to be men of honour and virtue themselves, at one time say it is to be taught, and at another, it is not ?
Those then, who are so tossed about in mind about any subject whatever, would you say are the master-teachers of it ?
Soc.
If then neither the sophists, nor they who are men of honour and virtue themselves, are teachers of this thing, it is plain there can be no others beside.
Meno.
I think there can be none.
Soc.
But if no teachers, then no scholars.
Meno.
I think the matter is as you say.
Soc.
But we have agreed that the thing, of which there are neither teachers nor scholars, is not to be taught.
Meno.
We have agreed.
Soc.
Of virtue then there appear no where any teachers.
Meno.
It is so.
Soc.
And if no teachers, then no scholars.
Meno.
It appears so.
Soc. Virtue therefore cannot be taught.
Meno.
It seems so, if we have considered the matter rightly ;
so that, Socrates, I am led to wonder whether there are any men really good;
and if there are, what can be the manner of producing good men.
Soc.
We are in danger, 0 Meno!
of being, both you and I, men of no mark;
and that Gorgias has not taught you sufficiently, nor Prodicus me.
Above all things therefore we ought to apply our minds to ourselves, and to seek a person, who by one way at least would make us better men.
I say this with an eye to the inquiry lately made ;
since it has escaped us ridiculously, that it is not only under the guidance of science, that affairs are administered by men rightly and well;
or, [if we should not grant that, (namely,) that it is not under the conduct of science only, but of some other thing also,]86 perhaps the knowledge of the means, by which men become good, has escaped us.
Meno.
How, Socrates, say you this ?[38.]
Soc.
In this way.
Because, since we have rightly agreed that good men must be useful to us, this87 cannot be otherwise.
Is it not so ?
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
And that they will be useful, should they conduct affairs rightly, did we not well admit this ?
Soc.
But are we like persons that have not rightly agreed, (in saying) that unless one is prudent, it is not possible to conduct (affairs) rightly ?
Meno.
How say you rightly ?
Soc.
I will tell you.
If a man, who knew the way to Larissa,88 or wherever else you please, were to walk, and act as a guide to others, would he not conduct them well and rightly ?
Soc.
What if one had only a correct opinion about the way, but had never gone'it himself, nor had any certain know­ ledge of it, would not he also conduct (others) rightly ?
Soc.
And so long as he had anyhow a correct opinion of things, of which the other man had a certain knowledge, he would not be at all a worse guide, though (only) surmising justly, and not knowing (clearly), than the other with his (perfect) knowledge ?
MenD.
Not at all (worse).
Soc. Correct opinion, therefore, with regard to correct action, is not at all a worse guide than (perfect) knowledge.
And this it is, which we omitted just now in considering of what kind is the nature of virtue, when we said that prudence only led to right action;
now this is correct opinion.
Meno.
It seems so.
Soc.
Correct opinion therefore is not at all less beneficial to man than (certain) knowledge.
Meno.
In this respect, however, Socrates, it is;
because he, who has a (perfect) knowledge, would always attain his object;
but he, who had only a correct opinion, would some­ times attain it, and sometimes not.[39.]
Soc.
How say you ?
would not the man who has al­ ways a correct opinion, always attain (his object) so long as he had a correct opinion ?
Meno.
It appears to me that he must;
so that, this being the case, I wonder, Socrates, on what account it is that science is so much more valuable than correct opinion ;
and in what respect it is that one is this thing, and the other another.
Soc.
Do you know why you wonder ?
or shall I tell you ?
Meno.
By all means tell me.
Soc.
It is because you never directed your mind to the images89 made by Dædalus.
But perhaps you have none of them amongst you.
Meno.
With what view do you say this ?
Soc.
Because, if they are not fastened, they run away and become fugitives;
but if they are fastened, they stay.
Soc.
To possess one of his works unfastened, is, like the possessing a runaway slave, a matter of little value, because it does not remain.
But fastened, it is of great value;
for indeed they are works of great beauty.
But why do I thus speak of them ?
It is with reference to true opinions.
For true opinions likewise, so long as they abide by us, are a valuable possession, and procure for us all good things ;
but they are not willing to abide a long time, for they run away from the soul of a man;
so that they are of little value, until one has fastened them down by the reasoning respecting their caused
And this, friend Meno, is reminiscence, as we before agreed.
But when they are fastened down, in the first place they be­ come (perfect) knowledge, and subsequently abiding.
Now it is on this very account that (perfect) knowledge is a thing more valuable than correct opinion;
and it is by this binding that (perfect)knowledge differs from correct opinion.
Meno.
By Jupiter, Socrates, it seems like to some such thing.91[40.]
Soc.
And yet I speak thus, not as one knowing, but only from conjecture.
But that correct opinion and science are two different things, this I seem to myself not to con­ jecture ;
but if I should say I knew any thing else, (and there are but few things I would say I know,) I would set down this as one of those I do know.
Meno.
And you say rightly, Socrates.
Soc.
What then, (say I) not rightly this too, that correct opinion, having the conduct of any work of action92 what­ ever, executes (her office) not at all worse than (perfect) knowledge ?
Meno.
And this too I think you say rightly.
Soc.
Correct opinion therefore is a thing not at all inferior to (perfect) knowledge, nor less beneficial with regard to action:
nor is the man, who has a correct opinion, (inferior) to the man of (perfect) knowledge.
Meno.
It is so.
Soc.
And it has been agreed, that a good man is useful.
Soc.
Since then it is not through (perfect) knowledge alone that men can be good and useful to their country, (if there are any such men,) but by correct opinion likewise;
and since neither of these exists to men by nature, [neither science nor correct opinion] ;
93 or94 do you think that either of them comes by nature ?
Soc.
Since then they are not by nature, neither is it by nature that men could have been virtuous.
Meno.
Certainly not.
Soc.
Since then (virtue comes) not by nature, we inquired, in the next place, whether it is to be taught.
Meno.
Just so.
Soc.
Did it not appear to us both, that it was to be taught, if virtue were wisdom ?
Meno.
It did.
Soc.
And that if it were to be taught, then (virtue) would be wisdom ?
Meno.
Very true.
Soc.
And that, if there were any teachers, it could be a thing to be taught;
otherwise, not ?
Meno.
Just so.
Soc.
But we have agreed that there are no teachers of it.
Meno.
It is so.
Soc.
We are agreed, therefore, that it is not to be taught, nor is it wisdom.
Meno.
Certainly.
Soc.
But we agreed besides, that it was something good.
Soc.
And that whatever conducted affairs rightly was a thing beneficial.
Meno.
We did clearly.
Soc.
And that affairs are conducted rightly by these two things only, correct opinion and (perfect) knowledge ;
by pos­ sessing which a man is a good guide.
For what comes from fortune is not the effect of human guidance.
But where a man is the guide to right, there are these two, correct opinion and (perfect) knowledge.
Meno.
I think so.[41.]
Soc. Now since (virtue) is not to be taught, it is not the effect of (perfect) knowledge.
Meno.
It appears it is not.
Soc.
Of the two things then, good and serviceable, one has been set loose, nor can (perfect) knowledge be a guide in the administration of civil affairs.
Meno.
I think it cannot.
Soc.
Not therefore as being wise in any wisdom, did such men take the lead in the state, as Themistocles, and the rest, of whom Anytus here has just now spoken.
And for this very reason they were not able to make others such as themselves;
because it was not through (perfect) knowledge they were such.
Meno.
The case, 0 Socrates, seems to be as you represent it.
Soc.
If then it is not by (perfect) knowledge, it follows it is by correct opinion ;
of which politicians making an use, re­ gulate states, being men not at all superior in wisdom to oracle- singers and divine prophets;
for these also utter many true sayings, but know nothing of what they utter.
Meno.
This seem to be very near the fact.
Soc.
Is it not meet then, 0 Meno, to call these men divine, who, without possessing a mind concerning what they do and say, direct many and great things aright ?
Meno.
By all means.
Soc.
Rightly then should we call those men divine, whom we just now mentioned, the oracle-singers and the prophets, and all poetical persons.
And not the least divine of such persons should we say that statesmen are, and no less enthu­ siasts, being inspired divinely, and possessed by the divinity, when in their speeches they direct aright many and great affairs, without knowing any thing of what they are saying.
Meno.
Certainly we should.
Soc.
And even women, Meno, call good men divine;
and the Lacedæmonians, when they celebrate with encomiums any brave man, say, " This is a divine man."95Meno.
And they appear, 0 Socrates, to speak justly too.
And yet, perhaps, Anytus here is offended at what you say.
Soc.
I care not. [42.]
With him, Meno, we shall have some discourse at another time.
But if we, during all this conversation, have inquired and spoken correctly, virtue can neither come by nature, nor yet be taught, but by a divine fate is present to those, with whom it is present, without intelligence;
unless amongst statesmen there be such a per­ son as is able to make another man a statesman;
and if there be, he might almost be said to be such among the living, as Homer tells us Tiresias is among the dead;
where, speak­ ing of him, he says, [Od. x. 495,] that he alone, of those in Hades, was intelligent;
but (the rest), like shadows, flitted.
The same thing would forthwith 96 such a man be, with respect to virtue, as a true thing is compared with shadows.
Meno.
You seem to me, Socrates, to speak most beautifully.
Soc.
From this reasoning then, Meno, it appears to us that to whom virtue is present, it is present by a divine fate.
But on this point we shall then know the truth, when, previous to our inquiries by what means is virtue present to men, we set about searching first, what virtue is by itself.
But it is now time for me to go some where else.
And do you, since you are persuaded yourself on these points, persuade also your guest Anytus here, in order that he may thus become more mild;
so that, should you persuade him, it is possible for you to do some service to the Athenians likewise.
PLATO, having proved in the Meno the impossibility of teaching virtue, in opposition to Gorgias, who boasted he could do it, has in this dialogue shown how equally incompetent were the Sophists of the schools of Protagoras and Prodicus to teach any of the arts and sciences, which they not only said they knew, but the knowledge of which they proclaimed they had the power to impart.
For, like some of the schoolmen of the middle ages, they were wont to speak " de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis," with the view of showing, as Horace has recorded, that a Sophist could with equal readiness become a cobbler or a king;
while to their vaunted universality of attainments may be applied the well-known lines of Juvenal in S. iii.
73—77, who drew his information partly from personal observa­ tion, and partly probably from the perusal of this dialogue of Plato, or the Clouds of Aristophanes;
between which there is a curious coincidence, as remarked by Winckelmann in the Prolegomena to the Euthydemus, p. xlv.
In genius quick, of desperate impudence, Ready in speech, and than Isseus dashing More torrent-like, what think you is he ?
say.
He with himself brings whomsoe'er you will, Grammarian, Orator, Geometrician, Painter, oiled Wrestler, Soothsayer, Ropedancer, Physician, Conjurer.
All things he knows.
With regard to the matter of the dialogue, its object is to show that the subtleties, on which the Sophists relied to prove and dis­ prove the same propositions, were in their hands only a play upon words;
and that, like all such displays of misplaced ingenuity, they could lead to no practical and useful results on questions relating to intellectual wisdom or political well-being;
on both of which con.
joined depends the happiness of man.
With respect, however, to the manner in which the subject is treated, Plato has here, as in the Ilippias Major, given up occasion­ ally the character of the serious philosopher and assumed that of the laughing one.
For, as Horace says- Ridiculum acri Fortius ac melius plerumque secat res—
A knotty point oft ridicule assails Strongest and best, where reason nought prevails­ a doctrine derived, it would seem, from Socrates, who says in Plato Legg. vii. p. 816, D., that without the aid of ridicule one cannot even in serious matters arrive at the truth.
Did, however, the ridiculous specimens of the subleties of the Sophists rest upon the testimony of Plato alone, we might perhaps have fancied, that to heighten the effect, he chose to draw rather a caricature than a portrait of the persons, whose pursuits he believed to be worse than useless, absolutely mischievous.
But we have the evidence of Aristotle to show that the picture is not overcharged.
For in his treatise "
On the Disproofs of Sophists," he has alluded to some of the instances produced by Plato;
which he would scarcely have done, had they not been known as facts rather than as fictions.
In truth, it may be said of the Sophists of Greece, in whose schools the orators learnt the rudiments of their art, what Gay has sung in his Fables respecting the barristers of more recent times-
I know you lawyers can with ease Twist words and meanings as you please;
And language, by your skill made pliant, Can bend to favour every client.
They, however, who wish to see even a greater abuse of the Sophists of Greece than is to be found in the dialogues of Plato, may turn to Mitchell's Preliminary Dissertation to his translation, or transformation rather, of Aristophanes;
where the writer's zeal has, as is often the case, outstripped his discretion.[1.]
WHO was he, Socrates, with whom you were con­ versing yesterday in the Lyceum ?
where 2 so great a crowd stood around you, that though I approached, desirous to hear, I could hear nothing clearly.
However, leaning over3I looked down, and it seemed to me that it was a stranger with whom you were conversing.
Who was he ?
Soc.
About which of them, Crito, are you Inquiring ?
for there was not one, but two.
Cri.
He whom I mean, sate the third from you on your right hand;
but in the midst of you was a youth,4 the son of Axiochus, who appeared to me, Socrates, to have made a great progress,5 and does not differ much in age from our Crito- bulus;
6 though that one is weazen-faced,8 but this one lanky but of a fair and engaging aspect.
Soc.
This is Euthydemus, Crito, about whom you are in­ quiring :
but he who sate by me, on my left hand, was his brother Dionysodorus, who also partook of the discoursc.[2.] 9 Cri. I know neither of them, Socrates.
Soc.
They are some new wisdom-mongers, as it appears.
Cri.
Whence do they come;
and what is their wisdom ?
Soc.
They are of a race some where hence, I think of Chius;
but they migrated to Thurii,10 and having fled from thence, are dwelling for many years about these parts.
But as to your inquiry (respecting) their wisdom, it is wonderful, Crito ;
they are indeed all-wise.
11 Since even I have not hither­ to known they were pancratiasts :
12 for they are skilled in every kind of contest;
not after the manner of the brother pancrati­ asts of Acarnania;
13 for these are able to contend with their body alone;
but those, in the first place, are most powerful in body, and excel in the contest, which consists in vanquishing all men.
For they arc very skilful themselves in contending with their weapons, and they know how to impart their skill to any other person who will pay them.
In the next place,­ they are most powerful in judicial contests, and are able both to contend themselves, and instruct others, to speak and write speeches suited for courts of justice. [3.]
Formerly they were terrible in these things alone ;
but now they have put a finish to their pancratiastic art;
for the kind of contest, which was left by them undone, they have now completed, so that no one is able to lift (a hand) against them;
so skilful have they become in verbal contests, and in confuting what­ ever happens to be said, whether it be true or false.
I have a mind therefore, Crito, to put myself under these men ;
for they say that in a short time they can make any other person whatever skilled in the very same things.
Cri.
But fear you not, Socrates, for your age, that you are already too old ?
Soc.
By no means, Crito, as I have a sufficient argument and consolation against fear.
For these very men, so to say, 14 have, though old, begun the study of this wisdom, which I am longing for, in the art of contending.
For last year, or the year before last, they were not wise in the least. [4.]
But of one thing only I am afraid, lest I should bring disgrace upon these strangers, as I do upon the harper Connus, the son of Metrobius, who teaches me even now to play on the harp.
The boys, therefore, who are my school-fellows, on seeing me, laugh, and call Connus the teacher of old men.
Lest therefore some one should reproach these strangers with the very same thing, and they, dreading this, should be unwilling to receive me, I have, Onto, persuaded other old men to go thither as my school-fellows;
and here also I will endeavour to persuade others;
and do you frequent the school with us.
15 Perhaps too, as an allurement, we may bring your sons to them ;
for having a hankering after them, they will, I know, instruct even us..
Cri.
There is nothing to hinder us, Socrates, if it seems good to you.
But first tell me what is the wisdom of these men, that I may know what it is we shall learn.
Soc.
You shall quickly hear, since I cannot say that I did not attend to them;
for I paid great attention, and very well remember what they said;
and I will endeavour to relate the whole to you from the beginning. [5.]
For, by some act of .a god, I had seated myself alone in the Apodyterium16 where you saw me:
and I had it just in my mind to rise up;
but as I was rising up, there was the accustomed signal of my Genius.
I therefore sat down again ;
and soon after those two, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, entered, and with them many others, disciples, it seemed to me;
and having entered, they sauntered about in the covered course (of the gymnasium).
But they had not yet gone two or three rounds, when Clinias entered, who you say, and say truly, has made a great pro­ gress.
Behind him there were many others his lovers, and Ctesippus too, a youth of the district of Pæanea,17 very beautiful and good naturally, except that he was saucy in consequence of his youth.
Clinias, therefore, seeing me from the entrance sitting alone, came straight towards me, and sate down on my right hand, as you say. [6.]
And Dionysodorus and Euthydemus perceiving him, at first stopped and con­ versed with each other, looking at us on this side and on that —for I beheld them very attentively-and then advancing, they sate down, Euthydemus by the youth, and the other (Dionysodorus) by me, on my left hand.
The rest seated themselves just as each happened to do.
These therefore I embraced, not having seen them for some time.
After this, I said to Clinias, These men, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, O Clinias, are wise not in small but in great things.
For they know every thing pertaining to war, (and) whatever he.
who would -be a good general, ought (to know , the arrange­ ment and management of encampments,18 and whatever is to be taught for engaging with weapons ;
18 and they know too how to render a person able to assist himself in courts of justice, when any one injures him. [7.]
For thus speaking, however, I was held in contempt by them ;
and both therefore laughed, looking at each other.
And Euthydemus said, We no longer engage in these matters as being serious, Socrates, but as of secondary moment.
And I being astonished said, Your (serious) studies must indeed be beautiful, if such great affairs are of secondary moment with you.
Now by the gods inform me, what is this beautiful study (of yours).
—We think, Socrates, said he, that we are able of all men to teach virtue in the best and quickest manner.—O Jupiter!
I re­ plied, what a mighty thing are you telling!
From whence did you get this windfall? ?19 I had hitherto conceived of you, for the most part, as I just now said, that you were very skil­ ful in this,20 to fight in arms ;
and this I have said respecting you.
For when you first tarried here, I remember, you publicly boasted of this.
But now, if in reality you possess this science, may you be propitious.
For I invoke you, as if you were gods, entreating you to pardon21 what I have before said.
But see, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, if you have boasted truly:
for it is by no means wonderful, from the magnitude of the boast, that a person should disbelieve.—[8.]
Rest assured, Socrates, that it is so, they replied.—I therefore consider you (said I) much more blessed in this possession, than is the great king22 in his empire.
But tell me thus much, whether you intend to exhibit this wisdom ?
or how have you determined ?
—We are here, Socrates, for this very purpose, as being about to exhibit and to teach, if any one is willing to learn.
But that all, who do not possess (wisdom), will be willing to learn, I am a guarantee:
first, I myself (am willing), and next, Clinias here;
and in addition to us, Ctesippus and all the rest here-and I pointed out to him the lovers of Clinias, who happened to be standing round us:
for Ctesippus at that time was sitting at a distance from Clinias.
And as it seemed to me,23 Euthydemus, while he was discours­ ing with me, did by his stooping forward darken Ctesippus's view of Clinias, who was seated in the middle of us. [9.]
Ctesippus therefore wishing to see his boy-love, and at the same time curious to hear, was the first to leap up, and stood directly opposite to me.
Thus too the rest, when they saw him do so, stood around us, both the lovers of Clinias, and the friends of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus.
I therefore, point­ ing them out to Euthydemus, informed him they were all ready to learn.
And Ctesippus and the rest very readily as­ sented;
and all of them in common exhorted him to exhibit the power of his wisdom.
I therefore said, Do, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, by all means gratify these persons, and ex­ hibit your wisdom for my sake.
Now to demonstrate the most of the things pertaining to this subject will, it is evident, be no small labour;
but tell me this, whether you are able to make him alone a good man, who is already persuaded that he ought to be instructed by you, or him also, who is not yet persuaded, through his not believing that virtue is a thing to be learnt, or that you are the teachers of it.
Come then, (say,) is it the business of the same art, to persuade a man thus affected, that virtue may be taught, and that you are the per­ sons from whom one could learn it the best;
or is it of another?—[10.]
It is (the business), Socrates, said Dionyso­ dorus, of the very same (art).
—You therefore, Dionysodorus, said I, can, the best of all men now existing, exhort to philo­ sophy and the study of virtue.
—We think we can, Socrates.
-Of other things put off, I said, for another time the exhibi­ tion, but show us this now.
Persuade this youth that he ought to philosophize, and study virtue;
and gratify me, and all these here.
For this has happened to him, that both I, and all these, are desirous for him to become the best (of men). -
Ho is the son of Axiochus, who is descended from the Alcibiades of olden times, and the cousin of now-living Alcibiades;
and his name is Clinias.
But he is still young, and we have a fear about him, as is reasonable in the case of a youth, lest some one should anticipate us, and by turning his mind to some other pursuit, corrupt it. [11.]
You are there­ fore come most opportunely;
and, if it makes no difference to you, make a trial of the youth and converse with him be­ fore us.
—When I had thus spoken nearly these very words, Euthydemus replied with courage, and even with confidence, It makes no difference, Socrates, if the youth is but willing to answer.
—Nay, I replied, he is accustomed to do this.
For frequently do these coming ask many questions of, and discourse much with him, so that he is sufficiently bold to answer.
24But how, 0 Onto, shall I narrate to you correctly what occurred after this ?
For it is no trifling labour to be able to take up and go through wisdom so boundless.
So that I am compelled, as poets are, in beginning the tale, to invoke the Muses and Mnemosyne.
Euthydemus, then, began, I think, after some such manner.- Whether, 0 Clinias, are the men who learn, the wise or the unwise? [12.]
But the youth, through the greatness of the question, blushed, and being at a loss, looked at me.
And I, perceiving he was flurried, said, Cheer up, Clinias, and answer boldly whatever seems good to you ;
for perhaps you will be benefited 25 to the greatest extent.
Whereupon Dionysodorus, bending a little towards my ear, and with a smile on his countenance, said, I tell you beforehand, Socrates, that in whatever manner the youth may answer, he will be confuted.
While he was thus speaking, Clinias happened to give an answer, so that it was not possible for me to exhort the youth to be on his guard.
And he answered, that the wise are those who learn.
Euthy­ demus, therefore, said, Do you call certain persons teachers, or not ?
-He admitted he did.—[13.]
Are not then teachers the teachers of those that learn ?
As, for instance, a harper and a grammarian were the teachers of you and other boys, and you were their disciples.
—He assented. —
When you learned, therefore, you did not know what you were learning.
—I did not.
—Were you then wise, when you were ignorant of these things ?-By no means.
-If then you were not wise, you were ignorant?—Entirely.
—You then, when learning what you did not know, learned them as being ignorant ?—
The youth nodded assent.
-The ignorant therefore learn,26 0 Clinias, and not the.
wise, as you think.
-On his saying this, the followers of Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, just like a chorus on a signal given by the ballet-master, made a great uproar and laughed.
And before the youth could recover his breath, Dionysodorus, taking him up, said well and cleverly 27 -But, Clinias, when the grammarian says any thing by word of mouth, are the boys who learn what he so gives out, the wise or the unwise?
—The wise, said Clinias.—[14.]
The wise therefore learn, and not the ignorant;
and you did not rightly just now answer Euthydemus.
—On this, the admirers of these men laughed very loudly and made an uproar, struck with their wisdom ;
but the rest of us were amazed and remained silent.
Euthydemus, therefore, perceiving our amazement, that we might yet still more wonder at him, did not let the lad go, but kept interrogating him ;
and, like skilful dancers, twisted his inquiries about the same thing in a double (maze),28 and said, Whether do learners learn what they know, or what they do not know ?
And again Dionysodorus said to me in a whisper, This also, Socrates, is just such another question as the former.—O Jupiter, said I, even the former question ap­ peared to be honourable to you.
—We always ask, said he, Socra­ tes, such-like questions, from which there is no escape.—[15.]
Hence you appear to me, said I, to be in high repute amongst your disciples.
In the mean time Clinias gave an answer to Euthydemus, that learners learn what they do not know.
And Euthydemus interrogated him in the same manner as before.
-Do you not, said he, know your letters ?—I do.
-Do you not then know all ?
-He acknowledged it.
—When therefore any one recites any thing, does he not recite letters ?
-He confessed it.
—Hence he recites, said he, something of what you know, if you know all (the letters).
—This also he ac­ knowledged.—
What then, said he, do you not learn that, which some one recites ?
-He assented.
29—But do you learn,30 not knowing your letters ?
—I do not, (said he,) but I learn, having known them.
31—Do you not therefore learn what you know, if you know all the letters ?
-He acknowledged it.- Hence, said he, you have not answered rightly.
—This had been spoken not violently32 by Euthydemus, when Dionysodorus, taking up the discourse, as if it had been a ball, again aimed at the lad as at a mark, and said, Euthydemus is deceiving you, Clinias. [16.]
For tell me, is it not to learn, to receive the science of that which any one learns ?
—Clinias assented.
-But, to know, said he, is it any thing else than to possess science ?
-He acknowledged (it was nothing else).
—To know not, then, is to not possess science.
-He assented to this.-
Whether then are the receivers of a thing, they who possess it already, or they who do not possess it ?-They who do not possess it.
—Have you not then confessed that they who do not know, are among those who do not possess ?
-He nodded assent.
-They that learn, then, belong to those that receive, and not to those that possess.
-He granted it.
-They there­ fore, Clinias, he said, learn, who know not;
and not they who know.
After this Euthydemus rushed to the third, as it were, wrestler-fall, being about to throw 33 down the youth.
But I, seeing the lad just sinking, and wishing to give him a res­ pite, lest he should exhibit cowardice before us,34 said, in order to console him, Do not wonder, Clinias, if these discourses ap­ pear to you to be unusual.35 [17.]
For perhaps you do not perceive what the two strangers are doing about you.
They are doing the same, that persons do in the initiation of the Corybantes, when they make an enthronement for him whom they are about to initiate;
for there takes place the leading out to dance and sports, (as I think you would understand)36 if you had been initiated in these mysteries.
And now these do nothing else but dance, and, as it were, sportively leap round, as if after this they would initiate you.
Now therefore think that you have heard the first part of the sacred rites of so­ phists.
For, in the first place, as Prodicus says, it is neces­ sary to learn the proper signification of words;
which these strangers exhibit to you, because you have not perceived that men apply "to learn " to a thing of this kind, when any one, having at first no knowledge respecting a thing, afterwards re­ ceives the knowledge of it;
and when any one, having this knowledge, does by this very knowledge look into the very same thing, either while being done or being said.
But they rather call this "to comprehend" than "to learn;
" although sometimes they call it " to learn."
But this, as they show, has lain hid from you, that the same word is applied to per­ sons affected in a contrary manner, both to him who knows, and to him who does not know. [18.]
Similar to this is that which was in the second question;
in which they asked you, whether men learn what they know, or what they do not.
These indeed are the playthings of learning.
Hence I say that these men are playing with you.
But I call these a play­ thing on this account;
because, although some one may learn many, or even all such particulars as these, yet he would not in any respect know better how things exist.
However, by the difference of words he may play with men, tripping up and overturning what they assert;
just as they do, who, drawing away the stools from under those, who are going to sit down, are delighted and laugh, when they see him whom they have overturned lying on his back.
Consider therefore what has happened to you from these men as fun.
But what is to follow, it is clear, they will exhibit to you as seri­ ous concerns;
and I will be their guide, that they may give what they promised me..
For they said they would .exhibit their exhortatory wisdom:
but now, it appears to me, they have thought it was requisite first to play with you.[19.]
Thus far therefore, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, let it have been made a sport by you;
and there is perhaps enough of it.
But in the next place exhort the lad, and show how he must pay attention to wisdom and virtue.
But first I will point out to you how I understand the matter, and what I desire to hear concerning it:
If, then, I shall appear to you to do this in a simple and ridiculous manner, do not laugh at me;
for, through a desire of hearing your wisdom, I will venture for a time to speak before you off-hand.
Endure therefore to hear me, both you and your disciples, without laughing :
but do you, 0 son of Axiochus, answer me.
—Do we not all then wish to do well ?
Or is this question one of the ridiculous, of which I was just now afraid?
For surely it is stupid to ask questions of this kind;
for who is there that does not wish to do well ?-
There is no one that does not, said Clinias.—[20.]
Be it so, said I.
—But in the next place, since we wish to do well, in what manner shall we do well ?
Shall we say, if we have many good things ?
Or is this an­ swer still more stupid than the former ?
for it is evident that this also must be the case.
-He assented.
-But come, what are the things, of those that exist, good for us ?
Or does it ap­ pear to be a thing neither difficult, nor belonging to a solemn person,37 to be at no loss 38 in this ?
For every one will tell us that it is good to be rich;
will they not ?-Certainly, said he.
-And is it not also (good) to be in health, to be beautiful, and to be sufficiently furnished with other things pertaining to the body ?
-So it appeared to him.
—But nobility also, power, and honours, in one's own country are plainly good.
-He ad- mitted it.
-What then, said I, yet remains for us among things good?
Is it to be temperate, just, and brave?
Whether, by Jupiter, Clinias, do you think that we shall put down these things properly, if we consider them as good ?
or if we do not ?
for perhaps this may be disputed by some one.
But how does it appear to you ?-That they are good, said Clinias. —[21.]
Be it so, said I;
but in what part of the chorus shall we place wisdom ?
among things good ?
or how say you ?—
Among things good.
-But consider lest among things good we omit what is worthy of mention.
-But, said Clinias, we ap­ pear (to have omitted) nothing.
-However, I recollecting said, But, by Jupiter, we appear to have nearly omitted the greatest of things good.
-What is that ?
said he.
-Felicity, Clinias ;
which all men, and even the very bad, say is the greatest good.
—What you say is true, said he.-And I again, correcting my­ self, said, We have nearly, both I and thou, son of Axiochus, rendered ourselves ridiculous to these strangers.
-How so ?
said he.
-Because, having placed felicity in the things we be­ fore enumerated, we now again speak of it.
-But why is this (improper) ?
-It is surely ridiculous to adduce that again, which was formerly proposed, and to say the same things twice.—[22.]
How do you mean ?
said he.
Wisdom, I re­ plied, is certainly felicity:
this even a boy knows.
-And he indeed was astonished, so young and simple is he.
And I, perceiving his astonishment, said, Do you not know, Clinias, that as regards the felicity of flute-playing, flute-players are the most happy?
—He admitted it.
-Are not then, said I, grammarians also (most happy) as regards (the felicity of) writing and reading ?-Certainly.
-But what, as regards the dangers of the sea, do you think that any one, so to say gener­ ally, are more happy than wise pilots ?-Certainly not.-Again,
With whom would you, when in the army, more readily share in danger and fortune ?
with a clever, or ignorant general ?
-With a wise one.
-And under whom would you, when you are dangerously ill, more readily be ?
under a clever or ignorant physician ?-Under a clever one.
-Is it not there­ fore, said I, because you think that you would do better, by acting with a wise person than an ignorant one ?
-He granted it.
-Wisdom, then, every where renders men happy ;
for surely no one can ever err through wisdom ;
but through this he must act rightly, and obtain (his end):
for otherwise it would not be wisdom.—[23.]
At length, I know not how, we summarily agreed that this was the case;
that, to whom wis­ dom is present, to him nothing of felicity is wanting.
After we had agreed on this point, I again asked him, how with regard to us would be what had been previously admit­ ted ?
For, said I, we admitted that if many good things were present with us, we should be happy and do well.
-He as­ sented to this.-
Should we then be happy through present good, if it did not benefit us, or if it did ?-If it benefited us, said he.
-Would then any thing benefit us, if we only pos­ sessed it, but did not use it ?
As, for instance, if we pos­ sessed much food, but did not eat it;
or drink, but did not drink it;
could we be benefited at all ?-Certainly not, said he.
-But if all artificers had every thing requisite prepared for them, each for his own work, but did not use them, when thus procured, would they do well [through the possession]39 merely, because they possessed every thing which an artificer ought to possess ?
Thus, if a carpenter had all kinds of in­ struments and wood prepared for him in sufficiency, but yet should fashion nothing, would he be benefited at all from the possession ?-By no means, said he.—[24.]
But what, should any one possess wealth, and all such things as we now de­ nominate good, and should not use them, would he be happy through the possession of these goods ?
-He certainly would not, Socrates.
—It is necessary then, said I, as it seems, that he, who is to be happy, should not only possess good things of this kind, but should likewise use them.
—You speak truly.
-Is not then, Clinias, the possession and the use of good sufficient to make any one happy ?
-It appears so to me.—
Whether, said I, if any one uses good things properly, or if he does not?
—If he uses them properly.
—You say correctly, said I, for I think the evil is greater if a person uses any thing whatever not correctly, than if he lets it alone.
For the former is wrong;
but the latter is neither right nor wrong;
or do we not say so ?-He assented.
—What then ?
In the workmanship and use of things pertaining to wood, is there any thing else that produces a right use than the science of a carpenter ?-Certainly not, said he.
-So too, in the work­ manship relating to vases, it is science which causes for them a right (use).
40—He admitted it--[25.]
Whether then, said I, with respect to the use of those goods which we first men­ tioned, wealth, health, and beauty, is it science, leading and directing properly action, which enables us to use every thing of this kind properly, or is it any thing else ?-
It is science, said he.
—Scienee, then, imparts to men in possession and action, not only happiness, but, as it seems, likewise the well­ doing.
-He confessed it.
Is there then, said I, by Jupiter, any advantage to be de­ rived from other possessions, without prudence and wisdom ?
Will a man be benefited, who, without intellect, possesses many things, and performs many actions ?
or, with intellect, possesses and performs a few ?
Consider it thus.
Will he not, by doing less, err less ?
and erring less, will he not act less improperly ?
And acting less improperly, will he not be less miserable ?-Entirely so, said he.-
Whether then will he perform fewer things being poor, than being rieh ?
-Being poor, said he.
-And whether being weak or strong ?
-Being weak. —
Whether also, being honoured or dishonoured ?—
Being dishonoured.
-And whether, being brave and temper­ ate,41 will he do less, or being timid ?-Being timid ?—[26.]
(Will not then this happen) if he is indolent rather than ac­ tive ?
-He admitted it.
-And if he is slow, rather than quick ?
and if he sees and hears dully, rather than quiekly ?
-In every thing of this kind we agreed with eaeh other.
-And to erown all, I said, it very nearly appears, Clinias, that, with respect to all the things whieh we first asserted to be good, the con­ clusion is not about this, that they are, taken by themselves, good naturally, but, as it seems, that they exist in this man­ ner ;
that if ignorance guides them, they are greater evils than their contraries, by how mueh the more capable they are of ministering to that evil leader;
but that if prudence and wisdom lead them, they are greater goods;
but that taken by themselves, neither of them is of any worth.
-It appears, said he, to be as you say.
—What then, from what has been said, takes place to us ?
Is it any thing else than this, that not one of the other things is either good or evil, but that of these, being two, wisdom is a good but ignorance an ill ?—
He assented.
Let us then, said I, consider further, what still remains.
Since we all of us are eager to be happy, and we appear to become such from using things, and from using them rightly, and science affords the correctness (of use)42 and felicity, it is requisite, as it seems, that every man should by all possible means endeavour to become most wise;
or is it not so ?-It is so, said he.—[27.]
And he ought to think43 that he receives this from his father, guardians, friends, and the rest, who pro­ fess themselves to be his lovers, much more than wealth ;
and to beg and pray strangers and fellow-citizens to impart wis­ dom, is in no respect base;
nor is it reprehensible, Clinias, for the sake of this, to act the minister and slave to a lover and to every man, and to willingly serve him in any honour­ able service whatever, through an ardent desire of becoming wise.
Or does it not appear so to you ?
said I.—You appear, said he, to me to speak very well.
—If, said I, Clinias, wisdom can indeed be taught, and does not exist of its own accord among men.
For this is yet to be considered by us, and has not yet been assented to by me and you.
—But to me, said he, Socrates, it appears that it can be taught.-And I, being de­ lighted, said, you speak beautifully, 0 best of men;
and you have done well in liberating me from a long inquiry about this very thing, whether wisdom can, or cannot be taught.44 [28.]
Now therefore since it appears to you that it can be taught, and that it is the only thing which can make a man happy and prosperous, would you say that any thing else is necessary than to philosophize ?
And have you a mind to do this ?-Entirely so, Socrates, said he, as much as possible.-
And I, delighted to hear this, said, My pattern, 0 Dionyso­ dorus and Euthydemus, of exhortatory discourses, such as I desired them to be, is of this kind, like a common person's perhaps, and stated at length with difficulty:
but let which­ ever of you is willing, do this very thing according to art, and exhibit it to us.
But if you are not willing to do this, show to the lad in order, from the point where I left off, whether he ought to get every science, or whether there is one, which, when he gets it, he will necessarily be a happy and good man ;
and what that science is.
For, as I said in the beginning, it is of great consequence to us that this youth should become wise and good.[29.]
This then, Crito, did I say;
and I paid.
very great attention to what followed, and considered after what manner they would handle the discourse, and whence they would begin, while they were exhorting the youth to study wisdom and virtue.
Dionysodorus then, who was the elder of them, first began the conference;
and all of us looked at him, as about to hear immediately some wonderful reasons;
which indeed happened to us.
For the man, Crito, commenced an admirable discourse, which it is proper for you to hear, as being an ex­ hortation to virtue.
Tell me, Socrates, said he, and the rest of you, who express a desire for this youth to become wise, whether you are jest­ ing when you make this assertion, or truly and seriously desire it ?-It was then I perceived, that they thought we had been previously jesting, when we exhorted them to con­ verse with the youth, and that on this account they too had been jesting, and had not been acting seriously by him.
Per­ ceiving this, I said still more strongly, that we were serious in a wonderful degree.
And Dionysodorus said, See, Socrates that you do not (hereafter) deny what you now assert.—I have considered this, said I:
for I shall never deny it.—[30.]
What is it then, said he ?
Say you that you wish him to be­ come wise ?-Certainly.
-But, said he, is Clinias now wise or not ?-He says, not yet at all, and he is no braggart.
-But do you, said he, wish him to become wise, and not be unlearned?
—We acknowledged it.
-Do you not then wish him to be­ come what he is not;
and to be no longer what he now is ?—
And I, on hearing this, was confused.
But he, on my being confused, taking up the discourse, said, Since you wish him to be no longer what he now is, you wish, as "it seems, for him to perish.
And yet such friends and lovers would cer­ tainly be of much worthy who should consider it a thing of great moment for their boy-loves to perish.
Ctesippus on hearing this was indignant, on account of his love for the youth ;
and said, 0 Thurian stranger, if it were not rather rude to say so, I would say, On your head be the evil ;
4G for knowing what do you falsely ascribe to me and the rest a thing of this kind, which I think it is unholy to assert, that I should be willing for this youth to perish.[31.]
But, said Euthydemus, does it appear to you, Ctesippus, that it is possible to speak falsely ?-By Jupiter, said he, it does, unless I am mad.
—Whether, when a person is asserting a thing about which there is a discourse, or when not asserting it.
-When asserting it.
-If then he asserts it, he does not say any thing else of things existing than what he asserts ?
-For how should he do otherwise, said Ctesippus ?-But of existing things that, of which he speaks, is one apart from the rest.
-Certainly.
-Does he then, when he speaks of that thing, not speak of that which has a being ?
—Yes.
—But he who speaks of that which is, and of existing beings, speaks the truth ;
so that if Dionysodorus speaks of beings, he speaks the truth, and utters nothing false against you.
—He does so, said he ;
but he, who says this, added Ctesippus, does not speak, Euthydemus, of beings.-
To this Euthydemus (replied), Are non-entities any thing else than things which are not ?-
They are not.-
Therefore, non-entities are beings no where.
-No where.
-Is it possible then for any one to do any thing about non-entities, so as to make them to exist no where ?
47—It does not appear to me, said Ctesippus, that he can.—[32.]
What then ?
When orators speak to the people, do they nothing ?-
They do something, he re­ plied.
—If, then, they do something, do they not also make something ?
Yes.
—To speak, then, is to do and to make.
43- He assented.
-But no one, said he, speaks of non-entities:
for he would make something;
but you have acknowledged that no one can make non-entities:
so that, according to your rea­ soning, no one can assert things which are false;
but if Diony­ sodorus speaks, he speaks things which are true, and he speaks of entities.
—By Jupiter, said Ctesippus, (it is so,) Euthydemus.
Yet he speaks of entities after a certain manner, though not as they subsist.
-How say you, Ctesippus ?
said Dionysodorus.
Are there some who speak of things as they are ?-
There are indeed, said he;
and these are men worthy and good, and who assert things which are true.
-What then ?
said he ;
are not good things, well, and things evil, ill-conditioned ?—[33.]
He conceded.
-And do you not acknowledge that the worthy and the good speak of things as they are ?
—I do.
-The good therefore, Ctesippus, said he, speak ill of evil things, if they speak of them as they are.
-Truly, said he, by Jupiter, they do very much so of bad men, for example ;
among whom, if you are persuaded by me, you will be careful not to be num­ bered, lest the good should speak ill of you;
because you well know that the good speak ill of the bad.
-Do they not also, said Euthydemus, speak in high terms of great men, and in warm terms of the fervent?
—Very much so indeed, said Cte­ sippus ;
of cold men therefore they speak coldly, and assert that they converse (frigidly).
49—You are abusive, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, you are abusive.
-Not I, by Jupiter, said he ;
for, Dionysodorus, I love you;
but I admonish you as my companion, and I endeavour to persuade you, never in my presence to so rudely assert, that I wish for the destruction of those on whom I set a great value.[34.]
I then, since they seemed to me to conduct themselves in a rather rude manner towards each other, bad some fun with Ctesippus, and said, It appears to me, Ctesippus, that we ought to receive from the strangers what they assert, if they are willing to give, and not to contend about a word.
For if they can destroy men in such a manner, as to make them, from being wicked and senseless, good and wise, and this too whether they have discovered themselves, or learnt from some other person a corruption and destruction of this kind, so that having destroyed him who is wicked, they might afterwards ex­ hibit him an honest man,—if they know how to effect this, and it is evident that they do know;
for they say that their new­ ly discovered art does make men good after being wicked,­ we must therefore50 consent to this.
Let them destroy the lad, and make him and all the rest of us wise.
But if you young men are afraid, let the trial be made on me, as if I were a Carian ;
51 since, though an elderly man, I am prepared to run the risk ;
and I deliver myself up to this Dionysodorus, as (Pelias52) did to [Medea] the Colchian (woman).
Let him destroy me, and, if he will, boil me, or do whatever (else) he pleases with me if he does but render me a good man. [35.]
And Ctesippus said, I also, Socrates, am prepared to deliver myself to these strangers, if they wish, for them to flay me more than they flay at present, provided my skin does not end in a bladder, like that of Marsyas, but in virtue.
Dionysodorus indeed here thinks that I am angry with him.
I am not, how­ ever, angry;
but I contradict what I think he has not well said against me.
But do not, said he, my noble Dionysodorus, call contradiction reviling;
for reviling is a different thing.
To- this Dionysodorus replied, Do you, Ctesippus, compose your discourse, as if contradiction existed?
—53Entirely, and very much so, said he;
or do you, Dionysodorus, think that there is not contradiction ?
You could not, said he, prove that at any time, since you have heard no one contradicting another.
53- True, said he;
but let us now hear, whether I can prove it to you by Ctesippus contradicting Dionysodorus.
Could you give a reason for this ?
54—By all means, said he.
-What then ?
said he;
are there words55 for each of the things that exist?- Certainly, said he.
—Whether, then, as each thing is, or as it is not ?
-As it is. [36.]
For if you remember, Ctesippus, said he, we have just now shown that no one speaks of a thing as it is not.
For no one is seen to speak of that which is not.
But why this ?
said Ctesippus.
Do you and I contradict the less ?-
Whether then, said he, shall we contradict, if we both of us pronounce 56 the word for the same thing, or shall we thus assert the same thing ?
-He admitted (we should).
—But, said lie, when neither of us gives the word for that thing, shall we then contradict ?
Or, (will it not follow,) that thus neither will have made any mention at all of the thing ?-And this too he granted.
-But, said he, when I pronounce the word for that thing, and you for some other thing, do we then contradict each other ?
Or do I then speak of that thing, but you do not speak of it in any respect whatever ?
And how can he, who does not speak of a thing, contradict him who does ?
And Ctesippus indeed was then silent.
But I, wondering at the reasoning, said, How say you, Dionysodorus?
For, though I have heard this reasoning often, and from many, yet I have always wondered at it.
For Protagoras and others still more ancient have made much use of it.
But to me it always appears to be wonderful, through its subverting the reasoning of others and itself too.
I think, however, that I shall learn its truth the best from you. [37.]57
Is the reason­ ing then other (than this), that it is not possible to assert things which are false ?
For this is the force of the argument.
Is it not?
And that the speaker asserts things which are true, or does not assert?57
He admitted it.
Whether, then, is it not possible to assert things which are false, but possible to form a false opinion ?-It is not possible, said he, to form even a false opinion.
—There is then, said I, no such thing as a false opinion at all.
-There is not, said he.
-Neither then is there ignorance, nor are there ignorant persons.
Or would not this be ignorance, if there were the power to speak falsely of things ?-Certainly, said he.
-But, said I, this is not possible.
-It is not, said he.
-Do you make this assertion, Dionysodorus, for the sake of talking, that you may say what is strange ?
or do you really think that no man is ignorant ?
-Confute, said he, the assertion.
Is it possible, according to your assertion, to confute when no man speaks falsely ?-It is not, said Euthydemus.
—Neither did I, said Dionysodorus, order you to confute.58
For how can any one order that, which does not exist ?—0 Euthydemus, I said, I do not clearly understand these clever and coherent assertions;
but I have somehow a muddled perception of them.
Perhaps then I shall ask something rather unpleasant;
but do you pardon me.
See then. [38.]
For if it is neither possible to speak falsely, nor to entertain a false opinion, nor to be ignorant, neither is it possible for any one to err, when he does any thing.
For the doer cannot err in what he does.
Do you not say so ?—
Just so, said he.
-This then, said I, is the unpleasant question.
For if we do not err, either acting, or speaking, or thinking, if this be the case, of what, by Jupiter, are ye come as the teachers ?
Did you not just now say, that you could, the best of all men, impart virtue to a person willing to learn ?-
Then said Dionysodorus, taking up the discourse, Are you such a crone,59 Socrates, as to remember now what we first said, and would even now remember any thing I said last year, yet do not know how to use what has been said at present ?
-For (the words), said I, are difficult (to understand), and very reasonably so;
for they are spoken by wise men ;
since it is very difficult to make use of the last words you are saying.
For what do you mean, Dionysodorus, by the expression, " I know not how to use"?
Does it not mean this, that I do not know how to confute it ?
Since,60 tell me, what other con­ ception do you form of these words, " I do not know how to use the words.”—[39.]
But what you say, said he, this is very difficult to use.
Since60 answer.—(What,) before you have answered Dionysodorus ?
said I.
—Will you not answer ?
said he.
-Is it just? (said I).
—It is certainly just, said he.-
For what reason ?
said I.
Or is it plain that it is for this ;
because you, a very wise person in words, have now come to us, and know when you ought to answer, and when not;
and now you will not answer a jot, as knowing that you ought not.
—You are a babbler, said he, and are careless in answer­ ing.
But, my good man, be obedient and answer;
since you acknowledge that I am a wise man.—I must yield then, said I, and, as it seems, to necessity;
for you are the ruler.
Ask, then.-
Whether then do things that have a soul understand ?
or soul-less things also ?-Those that have a soul.
-Do you know then, said he, any word that has a soul ?-Not I, by Jupiter.—[40.]
Why then did you just now ask me, what my word understood?
61—For what else, said I, than because I have erred through my stupidity:
or, did I not err, but rightly said this too, when I asserted that my words under­ stood ?
Whether then will you say that I did err, or I did not?
For if I have not erred, neither will you confute, although you are a wise man;
nor have you the power to make use of my assertion;
but if I have erred, neither thus do you speak rightly, in saying that it is not possible to err.
And I say this not in opposition to what you asserted last year.
But this discourse, said I, 0 Dionysodorus and Euthy­ demus, seems to remain in the same state, and still, as of old, having thrown down others, to fall itself;
nor for this not to happen has it been discovered even by your art, and this too so wonderful for the accuracy of reasoning.
—Ctesippus then said,
You certainly say wonderful things, 0 men of Thurii or Chios, or from whatever place you are, and by whatever name you delight to be called;
as you care not to talk wildly. —[41.]
And I, fearing lest reviling should take place, again softened down Ctesippus, and said, What I told Clinias just now, I say also, Ctesippus, to you, that you do not know the wisdom of these strangers how wonderful it is.
They are, however, unwilling to exhibit it to us seriously;
but are imi­ tating Proteus the Egyptian62 sophist, and deceive us by their sorcery.
Let us, therefore, imitate Menelaus,62 and not sepa­ rate ourselves from the men, till they have thoroughly shown us on what point they are serious ;
for I think that something of theirs very beautiful will appear, when they begin to be serious;
and let us beg and exhort and pray them to exhibit themselves thoroughly.
It seems then good to me to again point out in what man­ ner I prayed them to appear to me;
for I will endeavour, as far as I can, to go through all in order63 from where I then left off, that I may call them out to pity me ;
and that com­ miserating me on a tenter-hook and acting seriously, they may act seriously themselves.
But do you, Clinics, said I, enable me to recollect from what point we broke off. [42.]
As I think, we broke off some where there, when we acknowledged at last that we ought to philosophize;
did we not ?
—Yes, said he.
-But philosophy is a possession of knowledge;
is it not so?
said I.—Yes, said he.
-By possessing then what know­ ledge, shall we rightly possess it ?
Is not this the simple fact, that (it is by possessing) that (knowledge) which will benefit us ?-Certainly, said he.-
Would it then benefit us at all, if we knew to know64 by going about in what part of the earth the most gold had been dug?
—Perhaps so, said he.---:
But formerly, I replied, this was our decision, that we should gain nothing, even though, without labour, and without digging the earth, all the gold (that exists) should be ours.
So that if we knew how to make the rocks of gold,65 even this know­ ledge would be nothing worth:
for if we knew not how to use the gold, (its possession) would appear to be of no ad­ vantage.
Or do you not remember?
said I.—I remember very well, said he.
-Nor, as it seems, will any advantage be derived from any other science, either relating to money matters or to medicine, or to any other, by which a person knows how to make any thing, but does not (know) how to use what he makes.
Is it not so -?-He assented.
-Nor even if there were a science to make men immortal, without their knowing how to make use of such immortality, would there be, it seems, any advantage from it, if it is fair to infer any thing from what has been previously admitted.
-In all these points we both agreed.[43.]
There is a need then, 0 handsome youth, of some sci­ ence of such a kind, said I, as that there may concur in it both the power to make, and the knowledge how to use that which one makes.
-It appears so, said he.
—66We are far then, it seems, from being skilful lyre-makers, or from possessing any knowledge of that kind-;
for there the art that makes is on one side, and on the other the art that uses, (and there is a division about the same thing).66
For the lyre-making and the harp-making (arts) differ very much from each other.
Is it not so?
—He assented.
-Nor shall we, it is plain, require the flute-making art:
for this is another such-like art.
67—He was of that opinion.
-But, by the gods, said I, if we should learn the art of composing speeches, is this the art from the possession of which we should be happy ?—I think not, said Clinias, taking up the (discourse).
68—Of what proof, said I, do you make use ?
—I see, said he, some speech-makers, who do not know how to use their own speeches that they make themselves, just as lyre-makers do with their lyres;
69 but here are others able to use the speeches which those have made, although unable to make speeches themselves.
It is plain, then, that with respect to speeches, the art of making is separate from the art of using them.—[44.]
You appear to me, said I, to give a sufficient proof that the art of speech- makers is not that art, by the possession of which a person would be happy;
and yet I thought that here would appear the science, of which for a long time we have been in search.
For to me those very speech-makers, Clinias, appear to be vastly wise, when I am in their company ;
and this very art of theirs also appears to be something divine and elevated.
This, however, is by no means wonderful.
For it is a por­ tion of the art of charming, and is but a little inferior to it;
for the art of charming is that by which vipers,70 and pha­ langia,71 and scorpions, and other wild animals, and even diseases are charmed ;
but this happens to be the charming and soothing of judges, and of persons assembling at public meetings, and of other mobs.
Or are you of a different opinion ?
—I am not, said he;
but it appears to me as you say.
—Where then, said I, shall we yet turn ourselves ? to what art ?
—I do not well see the way, said he.
-But I think, said I, that I have discovered (the art).
—What is it ? said Clinias.
—The art of a general, said I, appears to me,' more than any other, to be that, by possessing which a person would be happy.
-It does not appear so to me.
—Why not ?
said I.-
This is certainly a man-hunting art.
-What then ? said I.- [45.]
No (part), said he, of the hunting art itself72 extends beyond hunting and getting into the hand;
but when persons have got into their hands what they have hunted, they are not able to use it;
but hunters and fishermen assign it to cooks.
But on the contrary, geometricians, astronomers, and those skilled in arithmetic-for these also are of the hunting art—for each of these73 do not make diagrams, but find out things existing.
As then not knowing how to use them, but only to hunt for them, they deliver up their inventions for those to make a bad use74 of in dialectics-such at least of them as are not very stupid.
-Be it so, I said, 0 most beautiful and most wise Clinias.
But is such the case ?-Certainly.
And thus in the same manner, said he, generals, when they have taken a city or camp, deliver it over to statesmen;
for they know not how to use the things they have taken;
just as, I think, the catchers of quails deliver them up to quail-feeders. [46.]
If then, he said, we are in want of that art which, whether making or hunting, knows itself how to use what it possesses, and is such an art as will render us happy, we must, said he, instead of the general's seek out some other art.
Cri.
What say you, Socrates ?
Did that lad talk thus ?
Soc.
Do you not think he did, Crito ?
Cri.
By Jupiter, I do not indeed.
For I think if he had spoken thus, he would not have wanted either Euthydemus or any other man for his instruction.
Soc.
But, by Jupiter, was it not Ctesippus that spoke thus ?
for I do not remember.
Cri. What, Ctesippus?
Soc.
This, however, I well know, that it was neither Eu­ thydemus nor Dionysodorus who spoke thus.
But, good Crito, was it not some divinity, who being present said these things ?
For I well know that I heard them.
Cri.
It is so, by Jupiter, Socrates;
and to me it appears very much so indeed, to have been some divinity.
But after this, did you still search out any art?'
And have you dis­ covered or not that, for the sake of which you made the search ? ,[47.]
Soc.
Whence, blessed man, did we discover it ?
But we were altogether a subject of laughter, like children that run after larks;
for we continually thought we should imme­ diately catch each of the sciences, but they were always flying secretly away.
Why therefore should I speak to you about the majority ?
But when we came to the regal art, and thoroughly considered whether it is that, which imparts and works out happiness, here falling, as it were, into a labyrinth, when we thought we were now at the end, we again turned round in our course, and appeared to be at the beginning of our inquiry, and we wanted just as much (of the mark), as when we were first making the search.
Cri.
But how did this happen, Socrates, to you ?
Soc.
I will tell you.'
For the art of the statesman and that of the king it has been determined by us are the same.
Soc.
To this art then, as alone knowing how to make a proper use of things, have the general's art and the other arts (determined)76 to give dominion over those works of which they are the mere artisans.
This then clearly appeared to us to be the art we were seeking, and the cause of good conduct in a city;
and really, according to the Iambic verse of Æschylus,77 that it alone is seated in the stern of the city, directing, as by the rudder, all things, and commanding all persons to do all things useful.
Cri.
Does not this then appear to you to be well said respecting this art ?
Soc.
You shall judge, Crito, if you are willing to hear what after this happened to us.
For we were considering again somehow thus.
Does that regal art, which rules over all, effect any thing for us or nothing?
We said to each other that it certainly will.
For would not you too assert this, Crito ?
Cri.
I would.
Soc.
What then would you say is its effect?
Just as if I should ask you, what effect does the physician's art produce in all the things over which it rules ?
Would you not say it is health ?[49.]
Soc.
And what does agriculture, your art, effect in all the things over which it rules ?
Would you not say that it affords us food from the earth ?
Cri.
I would.
Soc.
And what does the regal art effect, while it commands every tiling over which it rules ?
Perhaps you do not very well see your way.
Cri.
I do not, by Jupiter, Socrates.
Soc.
Nor do we, Onto.
But thus much at least you know, that if it is that art, which we are seeking, it ought to be useful.
Cri. Certainly.
Soc.
Ought it not, therefore, to impart to us a certain good?
Cri. Necessarily so, Socrates.
Soc.
But we have acknowledged to each other, I and Cli­ nias, that good is nothing else than a certain science.
Cri.
Yes, you did say so.
Soc.
The other works then, which one may say belong to the statesman's art-but these would be many-for example, to make the citizens rich, free, and free from sedition-do not they all appear to be neither evil nor good ?
But it is neces­ sary for this art to make men wise, and to impart knowledge, if it is to be that, which benefits and renders men happy.[50.]
Cri.
It is so:
and thus it was agreed upon by you, as you have narrated the discourse.
Soc.
Does then the regal art make men wise and good ?
Soc.
Does it then make all men so, and good in all respects ?
And is it the art which furnishes every science, that of the currier, of the carpenter, and all the other crafts ?
Cri.
I think not, Socrates.
Soc.
But what science (does it furnish) ?
To what pur­ pose do we employ it ?
For of no works, either good or evil, ought it to be the artificer, but to impart no other science than itself.
Let us then say what it is;
to what purpose we should use it.
Are you willing, Crito, we should say it is that, by which we make others good?
Cri. Entirely so.
Soc.
But in what will these be good, and to what purpose will they be useful ?
Or shall we still say that they will make others good, and that those others will make others so ?
How­ ever, they no where appear to us in what way they are good;
because we have held in no honour the works, which are said to belong to the statesman's science.
But in reality, there.
is, according to the proverb,78 Corinthus the son of Jupiter ;
and as I have said, we are still equally, or even more, wanting to­ wards knowing what the science is, which will make us happy.
Cri. By Jupiter, Socrates, you have come, it seems, to a great difficulty.[51.]
Soc.
I myself then, Crito, since I had fallen into this difficulty, sent forth every kind of cry and entreated the strangers, and called upon them, as if they were the Dioscuri,79 to save us, both me and the lad, from the triple waves of the discourse;
to be by all means serious, and seriously to show us what that science is, by the possession of which we may pass well through the remainder of life.
Cri.
And was then Euthydemus willing to show you any thing ?
Soc.
How not ?
And he began, my friend, the discourse very magnificently thus.
Whether, said he, Socrates, shall I teach you this science about which you formerly were at a loss, or show you that you possess it ?—0 blessed man, said I, are you able to effect this ?-Certainly, said he.
-Show me, then, by Jupiter, said I, that I possess it;
for this is much easier than for a man so old to learn.
—Come then, said he, answer me.
Is there any thing which you know ?-Certainly, said I;
many80 things, but trifling.—[52.]
It is sufficient, said he.
Does it then appear to you to be possible, that any thing which exists should not be what it is ?
-It does not, by Jupiter.
-Did you not say that you knew something ?—I did.
—Are you not then knowing, if you know ?-Certainly, in that very thing.
—It makes no difference.
But is it not necessary that you, being knowing, should know all things ?-It is not, by Jupiter, said I, since there are many other things which I do not know.
-If then you do not know a thing, you are not knowing ?-Of that thing, friend, said I.
—Are you not then, said he, less knowing ?
But you just now said, that you were knowing;
and thus you are the very same person that you are,81 and again not the same person, according to the same things, (and)82 at the same time.
-Be it so, I said, Euthydemus:
for, according to the saying, "You rattle indeed very pretty."83
How then do I know that science which we were seeking ?
since it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.
If I know one thing, do I know all things ?
For I cannot be knowing and not knowing at the same time.
And since I know all things, do I possess that knowledge likewise ?
Is this then what you say?
And is this that wise thing?
—You are, Socrates, said he, confuting yourself.—[53.]
But what, said I, Euthydemus, are you not suffering the very same thing ?
For whatever I may suffer together with you and Dionysodorus here, 0 beloved head, I shall not take much to heart.
Tell me, do you not know some things, and know not others ?
-By no means, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.
—How say you ?
said I.
Do you then know nothing ?
—Certainly,84 said he.
-Do you then know all things, said I, since you know any thing what­ ever ?
-All things, said he.
-And you too, if you know one thing, know all things.
—0 Jupiter!
I replied, how wonderful and mighty a good you tell me has appeared.
Do then all other men likewise know all things, or nothing ?-They surely, said he, do not know some things, but do not know others ;
85 and are at the same time knowing, and not knowing:
-But how is this ?
said I.—All men, he said, know all things, if they know one thing.—0, by the gods !
said I, Dionysodorus,—for it is now manifest to me that you are serious, though I with diffi­ culty invoked you to be so,-do you in reality know all things ?
For instance, the art of a carpenter and a cobbler ?-Certainly, said he.
-And are you also able to stitch shoes ?
—I ain, by Jupiter, said he, and also to mend them.
-Do you also know such things as these, the number of the stars and the sands ?86 —[54.]
Perfectly so, said he.
Think you, we should not confess that we do ?-And Ctesippus then, taking up (the dis­ course), said, By Jupiter, Dionysodorus, show me some proof of these things, that I may know that you are speaking the truth.-
What proof shall I show ?
said he.
-Do you know how many teeth87 Euthydemus has, and does Euthydemus know how many you have ?-Is it not enough, said he, for you, to hear that we know all things ?
-By no means, said he;
but only tell us this one thing more, and show that you speak the truth.
And if you tell how many teeth each of you have, and you appear on our counting them to have known this, we will then believe you in other things likewise.
They then, thinking they were mocked at, were unwilling (to comply), but acknowledged they knew all things, while they were questioned on each point singly by Ctesippus.
For there was nothing which Ctesippus did not ask them without conceal­ ment, and at last even if they knew the most indecent things.
And they, confessing that they did know, advanced most bravely against the questions, like wild boars pressing on against the blow;
[55.]
so that I too, Crito, was at length compelled myself through my incredulity to ask Euthydemus, whether Dionysodorus knew also how to dance ?
and he said, Perfectly so.
-However, said I, he surely does not know how to act the tumbler upon swords,88 and to be whirled on a wheel,88 being so old.
(Or,)89 so far (towards) wisdom has he come ?-
There is nothing, said he, which he does not know.
-But whether, said I, do you only now know all things, or have you always (known them)?
—Always, said he.
-And when you were children, and as soon as you were born, did you know ?
—All things, said both of them together.-
To us the thing appeared to be incredible.
But said Euthydemus, Do you disbelieve, Socrates ?-Except, I said, that it is likely you are wise men.
90—But, said he, if you are willing to give me answers, I will also show you, giving your assent to these wonderful things.
-Indeed, I shall91 most gladly, said I, be confuted on these points.
For if I am wise, not knowing it, and you demonstrate this that I know all things, and have al­ ways (known), what greater wind-fall than this could I find in all my life?
-Answer then, said he.—[56.]
Ask me, as one that will answer.-
Whether, then, Socrates, said he, do you know any thing or not ?—I do.
-Do you then know by that thing, through which you are knowing, or by any thing else ?
-By that by which I am knowing:
for I suppose you mean the soul.
Or do you not mean it ?-Are you not ashamed of yourself, Socrates ?
said he.
You ask a question when you are asked one.
-Be it so, said I;
but what shall I do ?
For I will do as you bid me.
(But) when I know not what it is you ask me, you nevertheless order me to answer and not to ask a question.
—You, doubtless, said he, understand what I say.—I do, said I.
—Now then answer to that which you do understand.
-What then, said I, if you ask a question, think­ ing in one way, and I understand it in another, and then I give an answer to it, is it enough for you, if I answer nothing to the purpose ?
-To me it would, said he, but not to you, I think.—I will not, by Jupiter, answer, said I, before I hear.92
—You will not answer, said he, to what you may happen to un­ derstand, because you are a trifler, and more of a silly old man than is becoming.-And I then perceived he was annoyed at me for defining precisely what was said, as he was desirous to make me his prey by placing his words around me (as a net).
I recollected, therefore,93 that Connus was always annoyed at me, when I did not yield to him, and that afterwards he paid less attention to me, as one that was ignorant. [57.]
But since I had determined to go as a scholar to those men, I thought I ought to yield, lest they should consider me a stupid fellow, and not receive me as a scholar.
Hence I said,
If it seems good for you to act thus, Euthydemus, let it be done:
for perhaps in every respect you, who possess the art, know better how to converse than I do, who am an unskilled indi­ vidual.
Question me then again from the beginning.
-Answer then again, said he, whether you know what you know by something or not.—I do, said I, by the souL-Again, said he, this man in his answer adds to the questions he is asked.
For I did not ask by what you know, but if you know by any thing.
-Again I said, I have answered more than was neces­ sary, through my want of instruction;
but pardon me.
For I will now answer simply, that I know always by something, what I know.
-But, said he, whether do you always know by the same thing ?
Or is it at one time by this thing and at an­ other time by another ?-Always by this, said I, when I know.
-Again, said he, will you not cease to speak beside (the ques­ tion) ?
-But (I fear, said I,) lest this " always " should trip us up.
—It will not us, said he;
but, if at all, it will you.
But answer me, Do you always know by this ?-Always, I said;
since I must take away the "when."—[58.]
You therefore always know by this.
And always knowing, whether do you know some things by that, by which you know, and other things by something else?
or do you know all things by that?
—All things, said I, which I know, by that.
-This has come, said he, the same by-answer.—I take away then, said I, the words " which I know.
"
—Take not away, said he, even one word;
for I make you no request.
94—But answer me, Would you be able to know all things, unless you could know all things ?
-This would be a prodigy, said I.
—Add now, said lie, whatever you like;
for you confess that you know all things.
—I appear to have done so, said I;
since the expres­ sion, " the things which I know," possess no power whatever;
[but I know all things].
95—Have you not then confessed that you always know by that thing by which you know ?
whe­ ther it be when you know, or in whatever way you please:
for you have confessed that you know always, and all things at the same time.
It is evident, therefore, that you knew when you was a boy, and when you was begotten, and when you was born;
and even before you was born, and before hea­ ven and earth were produced, you knew all things, if you always possessed knowledge;
and you,96 by Jupiter, said he, will know always, and all things, if I wish it.—[59.]
And may you wish it, much-honoured Euthydemus, said I, if you speak the truth in reality.
But I do not quite believe that you are sufficient for this, unless this your brother here, Dionysodorus, assist you with his counsel:
and thus perhaps you would be (sufficient).
97
But tell me, said I—for in other things I cannot contend against you, men of such portentous wisdom, (nor say) that I do not know all things, since you assert it-how, Euthydemus, shall I say that I know that good men are unjust ?
Come, tell me, do I know this, or do I not know it ?
—You certainly know it, said he.-
What, said I, (do I know) ?
-That good men are not unjust.
-This, I said, I perfectly knew a long time ago.
But I am not asking this ;
but where did I learn that good men are unjust ?
-No where, said Dionysodorus.—I do not there­ fore, said I, know it.
—Euthydemus then said to Dionysodorus,
You are destroying the reasoning;
and this man will appear to be not knowing, that he is at the same time both knowing and not knowing. [60.]
And Dionysodorus blushed.
But, Euthydemus, said I, how say you ?
Does not your brother, who knows all things, appear to you to speak correctly ?—
But am I the brother of Euthydemus ?
said Dionysodorus, hastily taking up the discourse.
-And I said, Leave me alone, my good man, till Euthydemus shall have taught me how I know that good men are unjust;
and do not begrudge me the lesson.
—You are flying away, Socrates, said Dionysodorus, and are unwilling to answer.
-And reasonably so, said I:
for I am inferior even to either one 98 of you ;
so that I have a great need to fly from the two.
For I am somehow far weaker than Hercules;
who was not able to contend with the Hydra-a sophist that did by her wisdom, if one head of the discourse was cut off, send up again many instead of one-and at the same time with the Crab,99 a certain other sophist, who, as it appears to me, had come recently from the sea;
and when it was annoying Hercules on the left hand by speaking to and biting him, he called upon Iolaus, the son of his brother, to aid him ;
and he gave him sufficient aid..
But if my Iolaus, Patrocles,100 were to come, he would rather produce mis­ chief.[61.]
Answer then, said Dionysodorus, since this tale has been sung by you, whether Iolaus was 'more the nephew of Hercules than of you.
—It is then best for me, Dionysodorus, said I, to answer you.
For you will not desist-of this I am pretty well certain-from asking questions, and grudging me (to learn), and hindering Euthydemus from teaching me that wise thing.
-Answer, however, said he.
—I will answer then, said I, that Iolaus was the nephew of Hercules, but, as it ap­ pears to me, mine not at all.
For my brother, Patrocles, was not his father;
but Iphicles, who nearly resembles him in name, was the brother of Hercules.
-But is Patrocles, said he, your brother -Certainly, said I;
for he had the same mother, though not the same father with myself.
—He is then your brother, and not your brother.—I said,
He was not from the same fa­ ther, 0 best of men:
for his father was Chæredemus, but mine Sophroniscus.
—But, said he, Sophroniscus was a father, and Chæredemus (likewise).
—Certainly, said I;
the former was my father, and the latter his.
—Was not then, said he, Chære­ demus different from a father?
—From my father, said I.—
Was he then (said he) a father, different from a father ?
Or are you the same thing as the 101 stone ?—[62.]
I fear, said I, lest under you I shall appear to be the same;
but I do not think so myself.
—Are you then, said he, different from the 101 stone ?
—Different, certainly.
-Being then something different from a stone, you are not a stone:
and being different from gold, you are not gold.
-It is so.
-Will not Chæredemus then, since he is different from a father, be not a father ?
-It seems, said I, he is not a father.
-For certainly, said Euthydemus, taking up the discourse, if Chæredemus is a father, and Sophro­ niscus, on the contrary, being different from a father, is not a fa­ ther, so that2 you, Socrates, are without a father.
-And then Ctesippus, taking up the discourse, said, Is not your father in the very same predicament ?
for he is different from my father.
-Very far from it, said Euthydemus.
—Is he then the same ?
he replied.
—Yes, the same.—I would not wish this.
But whether, Euthydemus, is he my father alone, or the father of other men likewise ?-Of other men likewise, said he.
Or do you think that the same person, being a father, is not'a father ?
-So I thought indeed, said Ctesippus.
—But what ?
said he, (do you think) that a thing being gold is not gold ? or (a person) being a man is not a man ?—[63.]
Say not so,3 said Ctesippus.
Accord­ ing to the proverb, you do not, Euthydemus, join thread with thread.
4
For you speak of a dreadful thing, if your father is the father of all.
-But he is, said he.
-Whether of men, said Cte­ sippus, or of horses too ?
or of all other animals likewise ?-Of all (animals), said he.
-Is your mother too the mother (of all) ?5 —Yes, the mother.-
Your mother then, said he, is the mother of sea-urchins.
—And yours too, said he.
-Hence then you are the brother of gudgeons, and puppies, and little pigs.
-And so are you, said he.
-And besides this, your father is a dog too.
-And so is yours, said he.
-But. said Dionysodorus, if you would answer me, you would forthwith acknowledge these things.
For tell me, have you a dog ?
—Yes, a very bad one, said Ctesippus.
—Has he then puppies ?
-He has indeed, said he, others very much of the same kind (as himself).
—Is not the dog then their father ?
-At least, I saw him having connexion with a bitch.
-What then ?
Is he not your dog ?—
Certainly, said he.
-Being a father then, is he not yours ?
So that the dog becomes your father, and you are the brother of puppies.—[64.]
And Dionysodorus again, quickly taking up the discourse, that Ctesippus might not get a word in before him, said, Answer me still in a small matter.
Do you strike this dog ?-And Ctesippus said, laughing, By the gods, I do ;
for I cannot (strike) you.
—You strike your father then, said he.
-Much more justly, said he, should I strike your father, who, having endured what, has begotten such wise sons.
But surely, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, your father and the father of the puppies has enjoyed many good things from this your wisdom.
But neither is he in want of many good things, Ctesippus, nor are you.
—Nor are you, Euthydemus, said he.
-Nor is any other man (said he) in want of them.
For tell me, Ctesippus, whether you think it good for a sick man to drink a medicine, or does it appear to you to be not good, when it is requisite;
or when any one is going to a battle, ought he rather to go armed, or unarmed ?
-To me, said he, (it appears);
6 although I think that you are about to say some of your beautiful things.—[65.]
You shall know the best, said he ;
but answer me.
For since you acknowledge that it is good for a man to drink medicine when it is requisite, is it not meet to drink as much as possible of this good, and will it not in this case be well there,7 if some one, bruising it, should mingle with it a cart-load of hellebore.-
And Ctesippus said, This would be very proper indeed, Euthydemus, if he who drank it were as large as the statue in Delphi.
8—As therefore, said he, it is also good to have arms in battle, is it not meet to have a great number of shields and spears, since it is a good thing ?-
Very much so, said Ctesippus.
But you are not of this opinion, Euthydemus;
for you think that one (shield)9 and one spear are sufficient.
Or do you not?—I do.
-Would you, said he, arm Geryones too and Briareus in this manner ?
But I thought you were more skilful (than to do so), as being one who fights with a soldier's arms, and so too was this your friend.
-And Euthy­ demus indeed was silent.
But Dionysodorus asked, in refer­ ence to what had been before answered by Ctesippus, Does it not then appear to you to be good likewise to possess gold ?—
Certainly, said Ctesippus, and this too in plenty.—[66.]
What then, does it not appear to you to be a good thing to possess riches always, and every where?
—Very much so, said he.-
Do you not then acknowledge gold likewise to be a good thing ?
—I have acknowledged it, said he.
-Is it not then meet to possess it always, and every where, and especially in one's self?
And would not a man be most happy, if he had three talents of gold in his belly, a talent in his skull, and a stater of gold in each of his eyes ?-
They say indeed, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, that those amongst the Scythians are the most happy and the best men, who have much gold in their own skulls, just as you lately spoke of the dog being your own father:
and, what is still more wonderful, they say, that they drink out of their own golden skulls, and look within them, having their own head in their hands.—[67.]
Whether, said Euthydemus, do the Scythians and other men see things which can be seen, or things which cannot be seen ?-Things, surely, which can be seen.
-Do you then (do so) likewise ?
said he.- I do.
-Do you then see our garments?
—Yes.
—Can then these things see ?-Beyond all measure, said Ctesippus.
—But what?
said he.
-Nothing.
But perhaps you think you do not see them, so facetious are you;
but to me you appear, Euthydemus, not sleeping to be asleep, and, if it were possi­ ble for a man, when speaking, to say nothing, to do this like­ wise.
-Is it not then possible, said Dionysodorus, for him who . is silent to speak ?-By no means, said Ctesippus.
—Is it also impossible for him, who speaks, to be silent ?-Still less so, said he.-
When therefore you speak of stones, and woods, and things of iron, do you not speak of things silent ?
—I do not, said he, if I run walking in braziers' shops ;
but the pieces of iron are speaking, and make the greatest noise, if any one touches them.
So that you know not that with (all) your wisdom you have said nothing.
But further still, explain to me the other assertion, how it is possible for one who speaks to be silent.
10—And Ctesippus appeared to me to be in great agony on account of his boy-love.—[68.]
When you are silent, said Euthydemus, are you not silent as to all things ?—
I am, said he.
-Are you not therefore silent as to things which speak, if things which speak11 are among the number of all things ?-But what, said Ctesippus, are not all things silent?
—Certainly not, said Euthydemus.
—Do then, thou best of men, all things speak ?
—The speaking things do.-
But, said he, I do not ask this;
but whether all things are silent, or speak ?-They do neither, and they do both, said Dionysodorus, hastily taking up the discourse.
For I well knew, that you would not have any thing to say to this answer.
-And Ctesippus, as was usual with him, laughing very loudly, said, Your brother, Euthydemus, has put his argument on both sides, and he has perished and is van­ quished.
12 And Clinias was very much delighted and laughed;
so that Ctesippus became ten times as great (as he was before).
But Ctesippus, as being very crafty, appeared to me to have heard these things on the sly from these very men.
For such kind of wisdom is not now possessed by any other persons. [69.
J And I said,
Why do you laugh, Clinias, at things so serious and beautiful?
—What, Socrates, have you ever seen a beautiful thing ?
said Dionysodorus.
—I have, said I, and many such, Dionysodorus.
—Were they then, said he, things different from the beautiful, or the same with the beautiful ?-And I then became perfectly involved in doubt, and thought I had suffered justly for having grunted out a word.
I said, however, they are.
different from the beautiful;
but a certain beauty is present with each of them.
13—If, then, said he, an ox is present with you, are you an ox ?
and be­ cause I now am present with you, are you Dionysodorus ?—
Say words of good omen, said I.
—But after what manner, said he, if even one thing is present with another, will that which is different be different ?-Are you then, said I, in a difficulty respecting this ?
For I have just now endeavoured to imitate the wisdom of the men,14 as being desirous of it.-
How should I not doubt, said he, both I and all other men, of that which is not ?-What do you say, said I, Dionysodorus ?
Is not the beautiful, beautiful, and the base, base ?-Provided, said he, it appears so to me.
—Does it then appear so to you?
-Entirely so, said he.
-Is not likewise the same, same ?
and is not the different, different?
For certainly the different is not the same.
And I thought that not even a boy would doubt this, that the different is not different. [70.]
But this, Dionysodorus, you have willingly passed by ;
15 since in other respects, like the artists, on whom it is incumbent to work out each part in detail, you seem to me to work out a discourse in a thoroughly beautiful manner.
-Do you know then, said he, what is proper for each artist?
In the first place, do you know to whom it belongs to work in copper ?
—I know that this belongs to copper-smiths.
-And to whom does it belong to fashion things in clay ?
-To a potter.
-And whose busi­ ness is it to cut a throat, to flay, and, cutting off small pieces of flesh, to boil and roast them ?
-It is the business of a cook, said I.
—If then, said he, a man does things which are proper, does he not act rightly ?-Perfectly.
-But it is proper, as you say, that a cook should cut a throat and flay.
Have you assented to this or not ?
—I have assented, I said ;
but pardon me.
16—It is evident, then, said he, that should any one cut the throat of the cook and chop him into small pieces, and boil and roast him, he would do what is proper;
and should any one work like a brazier on the copper-smith himself,17 and like a potter on the potter, he too would do what is proper.—[71.] 0 Neptune, said I, now you put the Colophon18 on your wisdom.
Will it then ever be present with me, so as to become familiar to me?
—You will know it, Socrates, said he, when it becomes familiar to you.
—This, said I, is evident, if you wish it.
-But what, said he, do you think you know your own things ?-Unless you say something else.
For I must begin from you, and end with Euthydemus here.-
Do you then, said he, consider those things yours, over which you have a power, and which you can use as you please, such as oxen and sheep?
do you think that those are yours which it is lawful for you to sell, and to give away, and to sacrifice to whatever god you please;
but that those, which are not so circumstanced, are not yours ?-And I, for I knew that from the questions something beautiful would peep out, and at the same time I was desirous to hear as quickly as possible, said, It is perfectly so;
things of this kind alone are mine.
-But what, said he, do you not call those things animals, which pos­ sess a soul ?
—Yes, I said.
-Do you acknowledge then, that those alone among animals are yours, to which you have the liberty of doing what I have just now mentioned?—I ac­ knowledge it.—[72.]
And he, pausing a while, as if reflecting upon something of great consequence, said with an assumed gravity, Tell me, Socrates, is there with you a paternal Ju- piter ?-And I suspecting that the discourse would come to the place where it ended, endeavoured to fly from a certain crafty turn, and now twisted myself as if caught in a net ;
and I said, There is not,20 Dionysodorus.
—You are therefore a miserable man;
nor are you an Athenian, since you have nei­ ther paternal gods, nor sacred rites, nor any thing else beau­ tiful and good.
-Hold, said I, Dionysodorus;
speak words of good omen, and do not instruct me harshly.
For there are to me altars and sacred rites, both domestic and belonging to my country, and the rest of the things of this kind as appertain to the Athenians.
—Then, said he, is there not a paternal Jupiter to the rest of the Athenians ?-
There is not, said I.
This appellation exists not to any one of the Ionians, nor to such as are colonized from this city, nor to us.
But Apollo is (our) paternal (god),21 through the race of Ion ;
and Jupiter is not called by us Paternal, but Herceus 22 and Phratrius ;
23 and Minerva too is called Phratria.—[73.]
This is sufficient, said Dionysodorus ;
for you have, as it seems, Apollo, Jupiter, and Minerva.
—Certainly, said I.—Will not these then, said he, be your gods ?-Progenitors, said I, and masters.
-To you then, said he, they will be so.
Or have you not confessed that they are yours?
—I have confessed it, said I.
For what could I do?
—Are not then, said he, these gods animals likewise?
For you have acknowledged that whatever have a soul are animals.
Or have not those gods a soul ?
-They have, said I.
—Are they not therefore also animals ?-Animals, said I.—But of animals, said he, you have acknowledged these to be yours, which you can give and sell, and sacrifice to any god you please.
—I have acknowledged it, said I.
For there is no backing out, Euthydemus.
—Come then, said he, and straight­ way tell me, since you acknowledge that Jupiter is yours and the other gods likewise, are you permitted to sell them, or give them, or to use them in any way you please, as you would do other animals ?
I then, 0 Crito, as if struck down by the argument, lay speechless ;
but Ctesippus, coming as it were to the rescue, Pyppax Hercules, said he, a beautiful dis­ course !
And then said Dionysodorus, Whether is Hercules Pyppax, or Pyppax Hercules?—[74.]
And Ctesippus said, 0 Neptune, what words of wisdom!
I retire;
the men are un­ conquerable.
Here indeed, friend Crito, there was not one of those pre­ sent who did not exceedingly praise the discourse;
and the two men were almost stretched at their length,24 laughing, clapping, and exulting.
For upon each (and25) all of the things (said) previously in a very beautiful manner, the admirers alone of Euthydemus made an uproar;
but here, al- most the pillars in the Lyceum made a clattering in favour of the two men, and were delighted.
I too felt disposed myself to acknowledge that I had never at any time seen men so wise;
and being perfectly enslaved by their wisdom, I turned myself to praising and passing encomiums on them;
and I said, 0 blessed ye for your wondrous genius, who have so rapidly, and in a short time, accomplished a thing of such magnitude ! [75.]
Your arguments indeed, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, contain many other beautiful things;
but this is the most magnificent thing in them, that you care nothing for the mass of mankind, nor for persons of solemn mien, and who think themselves something, but only for those who are like yourselves.
For I know well, that very few men similar to yourselves, would delight in these arguments;
while the rest are so ignorant of them, that, I am sure, they would be more ashamed to confute others with such arguments, than to be confuted themselves.
This too again is another popular and gentle character in your arguments, that when you say there is nothing either beautiful, or good, or white, or any thing else of this kind, and, in short, that one thing is not different from another, you in reality sew up the mouths of men, as in­ deed you assert you do;
and not only the mouths of others, but ye would appear (to sew up) your own.
(Now) this is a very gracious act, and removes whatever is oppressive in your arguments.
The greatest thing however is, that these arguments subsist in such a manner, and have been discovered by you with such skill, that any one may learn them in a very short time.
(For) I have perceived, by directing my atten­ tion to Ctesippus, how rapidly on the instant he has been able to imitate you. [76.]
The (wisdom) then of your practice, with respect to its being rapidly imparted to another, is beautiful;
but it is not adapted for discussion before men.26
But, if you will be persuaded by me, be careful not to speak before many, lest through their learning rapidly, they should give you no thanks for your instruction.
But especially con- verse amongst yourselves alone :
and if not, should you dis­ course in the presence of another, let it be before him alone, who gives you silver for what you say.
The same advice, if you are wise, you will give to your disciples likewise, never to discourse with any man, except with you and themselves.
For that which is rare, Euthydemus, is valuable ;
but water, although the best of things, as Pindar says, may be bought very cheap.
But lead on, said I, and receive Clinias here and myself (as your scholars) on the sly.
Having, Crito, spoken these words and a few others, we departed.
Consider therefore now, how you will accompany me to these men;
for they say they are able to teach any one who is willing to give them money;
and that they do not ex­ clude any natural disposition or age ;
and, what is especially proper for you to hear, they say that an attention to money- making does not hinder any one from easily receiving their wisdom.[77.]
Cri.
In good truth, Socrates, I am desirous of hear­ ing them, and would willingly learn something from them;
although I almost appear to be one of those, not like to Eu­ thydemus, but to those who, as you have just said, would more willingly be confuted by such arguments, than confute them.
It seems however to me to be ridiculous to give you advice;
nevertheless, I wish to relate to you what I have heard.
Know27 then, that as I was taking a walk, a man came to me from among those that had left you, and thinking him­ self to be very wise, as being one of those who are skilled in speeches suited for courts of justice, said to me—Crito, have you heard28 nothing of these wise men?
—By Jupiter, I have not, said I.
For, on account of the crowd, I was unable to stand close and hear.
—And yet, said he, it was worth while to hear them.
—Why ?
said I.—Because you would have heard men discoursing, who are the wisest of all those who at pre­ sent engage in such-like arguments.
-And I said, What then did they appear to you ?
—What else, said he, than that they are such as one will always hear from such-like triflers, who bestow unworthy attention on things of no worth.
For so did he say in very words.—[78.]
And I said, But certainly philosophy is an elegant thing.
-How, elegant, said he, 0 blessed man !
It is indeed a thing of no worth.
But if you had been present just now, I think you would have been ashamed of your associate.
He was so absurd, as willingly to put himself in the power of men, who pay no attention to what they say, but lay hold of every word.
And these men, as I just now said, are among the best of those that exist at present.
But indeed, Crito, said he, both the thing itself, and the men who are conversant with it, are worthless and ridiculous.
-But to me, Socrates, neither he appears to blame the thing with justice, nor would any one else blame it.29
To be willing, however, to discourse with these men in the pre­ sence of many appears to me to be an act that may be justly blamed.
Soc. Wonderful, Crito, are the men of this kind.
But I do not yet know what I am about to say.30
Of what class of men was he, who came to you, and blamed philosophy ?
Was he some pleader among those who are skilful in contending in courts of justice;
or was he one of those who introduce men of this description, (and) a maker of the speeches with which orators contend?[79.]
Cri.
The least of all was he, by Jupiter, an orator;
nor do I think that he ever ascended the platform in a court of justice;
but they say that he is knowing in the thing itself, by Jupiter, and likewise that he is a person of power and composes powerful speeches.
Soc.
I now understand;
and I was myself just now about to speak of those men.
For they are those, Crito, whom Prodicus says are on the confines of a philosopher and poli­ tician ;
and think themselves to be the wisest of all men ;
and in addition to their being such, they (fancy) they seem so to the many;
so that none others but the persons engaged in philosophy are an impediment to their gaining a reputation amongst all.
They think therefore, that if they can establish an opinion that philosophers are nothing worth, they shall, without a contest, carry off the prize of a reputation for wisdom amongst all mankind.
For they consider themselves to be in reality most wise;
but think that they are lessened by the followers of Euthydemus, when they are intercepted31 in their private discourses.
And yet they very reasonably think themselves wise men:
for to possess philosophy in moderation, and with moderation to engage in political con­ cerns, is very much according to reason;
for (this is) to partake of both, as far as is requisite, and to enjoy the fruits of wisdom, secure from dangers and contests.[80.]'
Cri.
What then, do they appear to you, Socrates, to say any thing ( of consequence) ?
Soc.
By no means.
32Cri.
Yet the discourse of the men possesses a certain speciousness.
Soc.
It has in reality, Crito, speciousness rather than truth.
For it is not easy to persuade them, that in the case of men and all other things, which subsist between two certain things, and partake of both, such as (are) from good and evil, become better than the one, and worse than the other;
but that such things as (are) from two goods, not (tending)33 to the same point, are worse than both, with respect to that, for which each of the things, of which they are composed, is useful;
and that such things as are composed of two evils, not tending to the same, are in the middle, these taken alone are better than each of those things, in both of which they take a part.
If then philosophy and political action are good, but each (tends) to something else, and these men, while they partake of both, are situated in the middle, they say nothing to the purpose ;
for they are viler than both.
But if (philosophy and political action) are both good and bad,34 these men are better than some and worse than others.
But if both are bad, they will thus assert something which is true;
but otherwise, not at all.35 [81.]
I do not therefore think they will acknowledge, either that both these are bad, or that the one is bad and the other good;
but partaking of both, they are in reality inferior to both, with respect to (the performing of) either, with a view to which both political science and philosophy are worthy of regard;
and though in reality they are the third, they endeavour to appear to be the first.
It is requisite, therefore, to pardon their desire, and not to be indignant at them;
but we should consider them to be such as they are:
for it is requisite to be content with whatever man says any thing bordering on intellect, and who courageously labours in going through36 (his task).
Cri.
And indeed,
Socrates, I too, as I am always saying to you, am in a difficulty respecting my children, how I ought to treat them.
The one indeed is still rather young, and little;
but Critobulus is already an adult, and requires some one to be a benefit to him.
When therefore I am associating with you, I feel disposed to think that it is mad­ ness to be, for the sake of children, so much concerned about many other things, such as marriage, that they may be born of a mother of high family, and about wealth, that they may become very rich, and yet to neglect their education.
But when I look at any one of those, who profess to instruct men, I am amazed;
and, to tell you the truth, every one of them appears to me, on reflection, to be unfit for the purpose;
so that I know not how to give the youth a turn for philosophy.[82.]
Soc.
Know you not, friend Crito, that in every pur- . suit, the bad are many and of no worth, but the good are few and worthy of all regard ?37 For does not the art of the gymnast, that of the money-scrivener, that of the rhetorician, and that of the general, appear to you to be beautiful ?
Cri.
To me in every respect.
Soc.
What then, in each of these do you not see that the many are to be ridiculed with respect to each of their doings ?
Cri. Yes, by Jupiter ;
and you speak with great truth.
Soc.
Would you then on this account avoid all those pur­ suits yourself, and not impose them on your son ?
Cri.
This surely, Socrates, would not be just.
Soc.
Do not then, Crito, do what you ought not;
but bidding farewell to those who study philosophy, whether they are good or bad, examine the thing itself, well and properly ;
and if it appear to you to be a vile thing, turn aside every man from it, and not your sons only;
but if it appear to you such as I think it is, boldly pursue and practise it, according to the saying, ‘ both you and your children'.
33AFTER producing in the Euthydemus some specimens of the ap­ parently clever but really absurd subtleties of which the Sophists of Greece were wont to make a display, and to gain the admiration of those, who could not detect a fallacy, and the contempt of those, who could, Plato has in this dialogue pointed out in what class of persons those must be placed, who professed to be on all questions of philosophy, politics, and science, equally competent to raise a doubt or to solve one.
In pursuing this inquiry, Plato has, like a keen sportsman, fol­ lowed the track of the animal, to which he compares the Sophist, until he arrives at the long-sought-for lair;
and he then discovers that, instead of the Sophist being the purveyor of intellectual food, he is occupied merely in the art of catching the many, and thus gaining a credit for talents which are not only of no use to himself and others, but are the bane of both.
During the course of the dialogue, he is led to examine the theory respecting the first element of all things, called τὸ ὂν or οὐσία, which I have rendered the existing" and "existence" respectively, and not, as others have done, " the being ” and " essence."
Of this ex­ istence, identified by some philosophers with " the one," and by others with " the whole," there were said to be an infinite number of parts, or species, all differing from each other, and yet producing what Horace calls " rerum concordia discors," through the proper­ ties of existence, connected respectively with the ideas of identity and difference, motion and rest.
From the fact of finding the same speakers in the Theætetus and Sophist, some have considered the latter dialogue to be only a continuation of the former;
while its similarity in the manner of subdividing a genus into different species, proves its still greater affinity with the Statesman—for such is the best English translation of the Greek Πολιτικὸς—and with the Cratylus, in its touching upon the phenomena of language, and with the Parmenides, as regards the doctrine of " the existing," and the forms it assumes in the mind of " the one."[1.]
ACCORDING to our agreement yesterday, both we our­ selves are come, Socrates, in due order, and we bring this our guest,1 an Elean by birth, and a friend of Parmenides and Zeno, and a great philosopher.
Soc.
Are you not, Theodorus, unconsciously bringing not a guest but some god, according to the language of Homer,2 who says in behalf of such mortals, as have a portion of due respect, both other gods, and especially the deity who presides over guests, become a follower and survey the insolent and the equitable conduct of men.
So that perhaps he, who now follows you, may be one of the better beings about to survey and confute us, when ill-conducting ourselves in a strife of words, through his being a kind of a disproving god.
Theo.
Such is not the manner of this stranger, Socrates ;
but he is more moderate than those that are studious of con­ tention ;
and the man appears to me, not to be a deity, but divine:
for such I denominate all philosophers.[2.]
Soc.
And you do well, my friend.
Although I fear this race (of philosophers) is scarcely more easy to distinguish, I may say, than that of the divinity.
For they, who are philosophers, not made up, but in reality, appear, through the ignorance of others, to be of a multiform kind, while they wander about cities, and behold from on high the life of those below them;
and to some they seem to be worthy of no honour, but to others of all;
and now they appear to be politicians;
and now sophists;
and sometimes there are those, to whom they give the idea that they are altogether mad.
I would, however, gladly hear from this our guest, if it is agreeable to him, what the people about the place there think of these things, and how they denominate them.
Soc.
The sophist, statesman, and philosopher.[3.]
Theo.
What, and of what kind, is the doubt about them, respecting which you have it in your mind to make an inquiry ?
Soc.
It is this.
Whether they consider all these as one or two ?
Or as there are three names, whether they distribute them into three kinds likewise, and attach to each singly a name ?
Theo.
He will not, I think, grudge to go through them.
Or how shall we say, guest ?
Guest.
Thus, Theodorus.
For I do not grudge, nor is it difficult to say, that they think them three kinds.
But to define clearly what each of them is, is not a small nor an easy task.
Theo.
You have by accident, Socrates, laid hold of questions similar to those, which we were asking this our guest, before we came hither.
But he then made the same pretence to us, as he just now did to you:
since he says that he had sum­ ciently heard, and did not forget.[4.]
Soc.
Do not then, stranger, deny us the first favour we ask.
But tell us thus much;
whether you are wont more readily to go through by yourself and to state in a long dis­ course whatever you wish to show forth, or by interroga­ tions?
such as I once heard Parmenides employing, and at the same time going through very beautiful arguments, when I was a young man and he very old at that time.
Guest.
With him who converses by answers, Socrates, with­ out pain, and (as it were) with a light rein, it is more easy thus with another;
but if not, by oneself.
3
Soc.
You are at liberty then to select whom you please of those present here :
for we shall all of us readily obey you.
You will however, if you take my advice, select some of the young men, either Theætetus here, or any of the rest, if such is your mind.[5.]
Guest.
A kind of shame has come upon me, Socrates, in that, conversing with you now for the first time, I have not carried on the intercourse in detail, word for word, but by drawing out a discourse to a great extent, either by myself or to another, I have as it were made a display.
For in reality, that which is now said is not (such) as a person would ex­ pect it to be, when interrogated about it;
4 for it requires a very long discussion.
But on the other hand, not to gratify you and these, especially since you have spoken as you have spoken,5 would, as it appears to me, be unlike a guest and boorish;
since, from what I have before said, and from what you now urge me, I receive Theætetus here to be the respondent.[6.]
Theæ.
Will you then, stranger, as Socrates said, gratify us all ?6Guest.
It nearly appears then, Theætetus, that nothing further must be said on this point.
And as it seems, the dis­ course must hereafter be addressed to you.
But if, wearied by the length of the discourse, you shall be somewhat annoyed, blame not me, but these your companions, as the cause.
Theæ.
But I think I shall not faint in this way for the present.
If, however, such a thing should take place, then I will take to myself as an ally Socrates, the namesake of Socrates here, who is of the same age with me, and my associate in gymnastic exercises, and not unaccustomed to labour in many things with me.
7Guest.
You say well.
Deliberate then about these things by yourself, as the discourse proceeds.
But now you must con­ sider in common with me, beginning in the first place, as it appears to me, from the sophist;
and searching out and show­ in-, forth by a reason, what thing lie is.
For now both you and I have only the name in common respecting this thing;
but as regards the thing by what name we call it, perhaps each of us have one peculiar to ourselves.
But it is always requi­ site respecting every thing, to agree rather through reasons as to the thing itself, than to the name alone without a reason. [7.]
However, with respect to the tribe which we now have it in our mind to investigate, it is not the easiest of all things to comprehend what a sophist is.
But whatever things of mo­ ment ought to be well and thoroughly laboured at, respecting these it has been decreed by all of old that we must practise them first in small and more easy matters, previous to those in the greatest.
Now then, Theætetus, I too recommend, since we conceive the genus of a sophist is difficult to hunt out, that we should in like manner practise the method in something more easy;
unless you are able to show some other and easier road.
Theæ.
But I am not able.
Guest.
Are you willing then to go after something of little value, and to endeavour to put it as the pattern of a greater?
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
What then if we propose a thing well known, and of trifling value, but possessing a subject for discourse not less than things greater?
as, for instance, a fisherman.
Is not this thing known to every one, and worthy of not very great and serious thought ?
Theæ.
It is so.
Guest.
And I suspect it has a method and reasoning not unsuited for us.[8.]
Theæ.
It would then answer well.
Guest.
Come then, let us begin from it thus;
and tell me, whether we shall put down a fisherman as skilled in some art, or unskilled in some art, but possessing another power.
Theæ.
By no means as unskilled in some art.
Guest.
But of all arts there are nearly two species.
Thecæ.
How so?
Guest.
Agriculture, and the care respecting every thing mortal, and that relating to the putting together and moulding what we call an utensil, and the imitative power, all these may be justly called by one name.
Theæ.
How so ?
and by what name ?
Guest.
When any one leads subsequently into existence that which was previously not in existence, then we say that he who leads, makes, and that the thing led, is made.
Thecæ.
Right.
Guest.
But all which we just now mentioned are wont to possess their own power (suited) to this.
Theæ.
They do.
Guest.
This then let us summarily call the making power.
Thece.
Be it so.[9.]
Guest.
After this the whole species of discipline and knowledge, and the species relating to money-making, and contending, and hunting, may be said to be clearly a certain acquiring power, through all their details;
since not one of these makes any thing, but gets hold of some things, which are and have been, through words and deeds, and does not give up to others who attempt to get hold 8 of them.
Thecæ.
Truly so;
for it would be proper.
Guest.
Since then all arts consist either in acquiring or in making, in which of these, Theætetus, shall we place the art of fishing ?
Theæ.
Doubtless in the art of acquiring.
Guest.
But are there not two species of the art of ac­ quiring ?
the one being an interchange between those that are willing, through the medium of gifts, wages, and purchase ?
but the other would be a getting hold, effected entirely either by deeds or words.
Theæ.
So it appears from what has been said.
Guest.
But must not the getting hold likewise receive a two-fold division ?
Theæ.
In what way ?
Guest.
The one being openly done, and wholly from a contest;
but the other secretly, and consisting wholly in hunting.
Theæ.
Yes.[10.]
Guest.
It is likewise irrational not to give hunting a two-fold division.
Theæ.
Say how.
Guest.
By making one relate to a race inanimate, and the other to an animated one.
Theæ.
How not ?
if there are both these.
Guest.
How should there not be ?
But we may pass by (the hunting of) inanimate things as being without a name, except as regards some portions of the art of diving, and other trifling things of this kind;
but call the other part, relating to the hunting of an animated race, animal-hunting.
Theæ.
Be it so.
Guest.
But is it not justly said, that of animal-hunting there is a twofold kind ?
one being the hunting of walking animals, which is distinguished by many species and names, but the other of swimming animals, and which is hunting in a liquid.
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But of the swimming division, we see that one kind is winged and the other aquatic.
Theæ.
Undoubtedly.
Guest.
But all the hunting of the winged tribe is called bird-catching.
Theæ.
It is so called.
Guest.
But that of nearly all the aquatic, sea-fishing.
Theæ.
Yes.[11.]
Guest.
But shall we not divide this hunting into two chief parts ?
Theæ.
What are they ?
Guest.
According as the one makes for itself a catch with nets, the other by a blow.
Theæ.
How say you ?
And how do you divide each ?
Guest.
Whatever by enclosing on all sides restrains any thing for the sake of an hinderance, it is reasonable to call a net.
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But do you call a net of twigs, of twine, of reeds, and a casting-net, any thing else than nets?
9
Theæ.
Nothing else.
Guest.
We must therefore say that this hunting with nets is a part of fishing, or something of this kind.
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
But that which takes place with hooks and three­ forked harpoons, by a blow,10 and which is different from the other kind, it will be requisite for us now to call by one word, by-a-blow-hunting.11
Or what would any one, These­ tetus, say better ?
Theæ.
Let us disregard the name;
for this is sufficient.[12.]
Guest.
Of by-a-blow-hunting then one kind is, I think, at night effected by the light of fire;
and it happens to be called the fire-kind 12 by those engaged in the hunting.
Thecæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But the other kind is by day, and is effected with rods13 and harpoons, having hooks at their extremities, and is wholly hook-fishing.
Theæ.
It is so called.
Guest.
Of hook-fishing, and by a blow, that which takes place (by darting) downwards the harpoons from on high, is I think called harpoon-fishing, on account of persons using the harpoons in that way.
Theæ.
So some persons say.
Guest.
There remains then only one kind, so to say.
Theæ.
What is that?
Guest.
That which is with a blow contrary to this, and effected with a hook, but not striking, as it may happen, upon any part of the body of fishes, as in the case of harpoons, but about the head and mouth of the fish caught on each occasion, and drawing it from below to the contrary up14 by rods and reeds;
to which fishing what name, Theaetetus, shall we say ought to be given ?
Thecæ.
[That of hook-fishing with rods];
15 and we now appear to have arrived at the end of that, which we proposed as being necessary to find out.[13.]
Guest.
Now then, you and I have not only agreed about a name for the fishing art, but we have likewise suffi­ ciently accepted the reason respecting the thing itself
For of the whole art, a half was in the acquiring;
and of the acquiring, a half was in the getting hold;
and of the getting hold, a half was in the hunting;
and of the hunting, (a half) was in the animal-bunting ;
and of the animal-hunting, (a half) was in the hunting in a liquid ;
and of the hunting in a liquid, the downward division was wholly sea-fishing;
and of the sea-fishing, (a half) was the fishing by a blow ;
and of the fishing by a blow, (a half) was by a hook;
and of this (a half) was about the blow drawing from below upwards ;
16 and that from the act itself (to which) the name has been made to resemble the fisherman’s art, having been now dis­ covered, is called by that appellation.
Theæ.
This, then, has been shown in every respect suffici­ ently.
Guest.
Come then, let us endeavour according to this ex­ ample to discover what a sophist is.
Theæ.
By all means.[14.]
Guest.
Now this was the first search in the pattern just adduced, whether we must put down a fisherman as an untaught individual, or as possessing some art.
Guest.
And now, Theætetus, shall we put down this per­ son as an untaught individual, or as truly a sophist in all things ?
17Theæ.
By no means as an untaught individual.
For I un­ derstand what you mean,18 that he who possesses the name, ought to be such.
But we must put him down as possessing some art.
Guest.
What is then the art?
By the gods, are we ig­ norant that one of these men is a relation of the other ?
Theæ.
Whom of whom ?
Guest.
The fisherman of the sophist.
Them.
In what way ?
Guest.
Both of them appear to me to be hunters.
Thecæ.
Of what prey is this (the hunter) ?
for we have spoken of the other,Guest.
We divided the whole of hunting into the swimming and the walking.•
Theæ.
We did.
Guest.
And we went through such a portion as related to the swimming part of the aquatic kind ?
but we left the walk­ ing undivided, having said that it was multiform.
Theæ.
Entirely so.[15.]
Guest.
Thus far then the sophist and the fisherman equally proceed from the art of acquiring.
Theæ.
They appear so.
Guest.
But they turn themselves from the animal hunting, one to the sea, and rivers, and lakes, and he catches animals in these.
Theæ.
Undoubtedly.
Guest.
But another (turns himself) to the land, and some other rivers, as if they were meadows of wealth and youth without stint, with the view of getting hold of the animals nourished in them.
Theæ.
How say you ?
Guest.
Of the hunting on foot, there are two chief parts.
Theæ.
Of what kind is each ?
Guest.
One is the hunting of tame animals, and the other of wild.
Thecæ.
Is there any hunting then of tame animals ?
Guest.
If indeed man is a tame animal.
But lay down in whatsoever way you like, either that no animal is tame, or that some other is tame, but that man is a wild one;
or you say 19 that man indeed is a tame animal, but you think 19 that there is no hunting of men.
Whichever of these suppo­ sitions you deem it agreeable to you to be stated, this do you define.
Thecæ.
I think, stranger, we are a tame animal, and I say that there is a hunting of men.[16.]
Guest.
Let us say then that tame-animal hunting is of two kinds.
Theæ.
Speaking according to what manner ?
Guest.
By defining the hunting by robbers, and that which makes slaves, and that by tyrants, to be one and all a hunting by force.
Theæ.
Very well.
Guest.
But by calling that which pertains to law-courts, popular assemblies, and (private) discourse, one and all a cer­ tain single persuasive art.
Theæ.
Right.
Guest.
Now of this persuasive art let us say there are two kinds.
Theæ.
What are they?
Guest.
One is, private, and the other public.
Theæ.
There are then these two species.
Guest.
Again, with respect to private hunting, one kind is (connected with) wages, and the other with gifts.
Theæ.
I do not understand.
Guest.
It seems you have never given your mind to the hunting of lovers.
Theæ.
Why say you so ?
Guest.
Because persons bestow even gifts in addition upon the caught.
Theæ.
You speak most truly.
Guest.
Let this then he a kind of the amatory art.
Theæ.
By all means.[17.]
Guest.
But as regards that connected with wages, that part of it which keeps up an intercourse through favour, and has in every way made a bait through pleasure, and bar­ gains for food for itself as its wages, this, I think, we should all of us call adulation, or20 a certain pleasure-giving art.
Theæ.
Undoubtedly.
Guest.
But the other part of it, which professes to keep up an intercourse for the sake of virtue, and bargains for coin as its wages, is it not worthy to call by another name ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But with what (name) ?
Try to tell me.
Theæ.
It is evident.
For we appear to me to have found the sophist;
and thus calling him, I think I should call him by a fitting name.
Guest.
According to the present reasoning, it seems, Theoetetus, the art of a sophist must be called 21 domestic hold-getting, [acquiring,] hunting, animal-hunting, [land­ hunting], on land, [tame-animal-hunting,] man-hunting, (by­ persuasion-hunting,) individual-hunting, [wages-hunting,] coin-selling, and insnaring rich and noble young men, through a false reputation for erudition, as the present reasoning now goes with us.21[18.]
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Let us consider further still in this way.
For the object of our present search does not participate in some con­ temptible art, but in a very clever one.
For from what has been before stated, an idea presents itself that it is not that kind of art, which we just now said, but some other kind.
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Of the art of acquiring, there was a two-fold kind, one.
consisting in the catching, and the other in the ex­ changing.
Theæ.
There was.
Guest.
Let us say then, that of the exchanging there are two kinds, the one consisting in giving, and the other in selling.
Thecæ.
Let it be so said.
Guest.
And again, we will say that the selling must have a two-fold division.
Theæ.
In what way ?Guest. 22 He who exposes his own works for sale is called a seller of his own (property);
but he who sells the works of others, an exchanger.
22Theæ.
Entirely so.[19.]
Guest.
But is not the exchange, which takes place in (the same) city, and which is nearly a half of the whole of the trade, called capelic?
23Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
And is not that which effects an exchange from one city to another, by buying and selling, (called) emporic ?23Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
And do we not perceive, in the case of the em­ poric,23 that the sale of the articles by which the body and soul are nourished, and which they use (respectively), becomes barter by means of coin ?
Theœ.
How say you this ?
Guest.
Of that part, which relates to the soul, we are perhaps ignorant:
but the other we understand.
Theœ.
We do.
Guest. 24 Let us say then as regards music in general, which is constantly purchased at one place, and, carried from city to city, is sold at another;
and as regards painting, wonder-working, and other things pertaining to the soul, which are imported and sold, some for the sake of amusement, others for graver pursuits, that the person, who imports and sells them, would give a handle to be called a merchant no less than by the sale of meats and drinks.24 [20.]
Theœ.
You speak most true.
Guest.
Will you not, then, call by the same name him who goes about from city to city to buy learning for money ?
Theœ.
Certainly.
Guest.
But of this soul-trafficking, would not one part be most justly called an exhibition;
but the other part, although no less ridiculous 25 than the former,26 still as being a selling of learning, there is a necessity to call it by a name the brother to the act.
Theœ.
Certainly.
Guest.
But in this learning-selling, the trade which relates to other arts must be called by one name, and that which re­ lates to virtue by another.
Theœ.
How not ?
Guest.
For as regards the others, the name " art-seller" would be fitting;
but as regards this, do you consider what name to call it.
Theœ.
And what other name, except that sought out now for the sophistic.
race, could one mention without an error ?
Guest.
No other.
Now then let us collect it together, by saying that by a second (search), the sophistic art appeared to consist in the acquiring, exchanging, buying, trafficking, soul-trafficking respecting discourses, and the selling the learning of virtue.[21.]
Theœ.
Just so.
Guest.
By a third (search), I think that you will call by no other name, than (we have done) just now, the person who, being settled in a city, partly buys and partly fabricates himself learning respecting these very same subjects, and by selling determines for himself to live by such a plan.
Theœ.
Why, indeed, should I not ?
Guest.
And that part too of the acquiring art, which consists in exchanging, purchasing, and selling in both ways, either ones own inventions, or those of others, you will ever call, as you seem, a sophistic kind, whatever may be the learning-selling respecting such things.
27Theœ.
Necessarily so.
For it is necessary to be the fol­ lower of reason.
Guest.
Let us still further consider, whether the kind, which has been now pursued, is similar to some such thing as this.
Theœ.
To what?
Guest.
Of the art of acquiring a certain part consisted in contesting.
Theœ.
It did.
Guest.
It will not then be from the purpose to divide it in­ to two.
Theœ.
Say into what parts ?
Guest.
By laying down one part as a contest (of friends), and the other as the fight of (foes).
Theœ.
It is so.[22.]
Guest.
Of the fighting part then, when a body comes in conflict with a body, it is nearly reasonable and becoming for persons, laying down28 a name, to pronounce it, as it were, violent.
Theœ.
It may.
Guest.
But in the case of reasons (coming in conflict) with reasons, what else, Theætetus, would any one call it but con­ tention ?
Theœ.
Nothing else.
Guest.
But as to contentions, we must lay down a twofold division.
Theœ.
In what way ?
Guest.
So far as (contention) takes place through prolix arguments against prolix arguments and about things just and unjust in a public matter it is judicial.
Theœ.
It is.
Guest.
But when it takes place in a private one, and is broken to minute parts, by questions to answers,29 are we ac­ customed to call it any thing else than contradiction.
Theœ.
Nothing else.
Guest.
But of contradiction, that part which respects (pri­ vate) contracts is made the subject of dispute, and is carried on carelessly and without art, we must place as a separate (kind) ;
since reason distinguishes it as being something dif­ ferent ;
but it has neither obtained an appellation from any of those of a former period, nor does it deserve to obtain one now from us.
Theœ.
True, for it is divided into parts extremely small and very various.[23.]
Guest.
But that which is according to art, and dis­ putes about things just and unjust, in the abstract, and uni­ versally about other matters, we are accustomed to call con­ tentious.
Theœ.
How not ?
Guest.
But of the contentious, one part destroys wealth, and the other makes it.
Theœ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Let us then endeavour to state by what name it is needful to call each of these.
Theœ.
It is proper to do so.
Guest.
I think then that the neglect of private affairs, which takes place through the delight in the practice of con­ tention, and through the telling to the majority of listeners what is not heard with pleasure, may be called, according to my notion, something not different from babbling.
30Theœ.
It is indeed called so.
Guest.
But do you now in your turn endeavour to tell the contrary name of him, who makes money through private quarrels.
Thecæ.
Would not any one err, in calling him by any other name than that of the wonderful sophist, who, after being pursued by us, has now come again for the fourth time (in our view) ?
Guest.
The sophist then, as it seems, is nothing else but that money-making genus, which is a part of the arts of quar­ .relling, contradiction, controversy, (hostile) fighting, (friendly) contest, and acquisition, as our reasoning has pointed out.
Theœ.
He is altogether so.[24.]
Guest.
You see, then, it is truly said, that this wild beast is a various animal, and that, according to the pro­ verb, he is not to be caught with the left hand.
Theœ.
It is necessary then (to use) both hands.
Guest.
It is necessary;
and we must to the utmost of our power do something of this kind, by running after its foot­ marks.
But tell me, have we not words relating to household affairs ?
Theœ.
Yes, many.
But about which of the many are you inquiring ?
Guest.
Such as when we say to pass through a cullender, to bolt through a bag, to pass through a sieve, [to separate.]
31Theœ.
How not ?
Guest.
And besides these, we know the words, to card (wool), to draw it down, to weave it, and ten thousand others of a like kind existing in the arts.
Do we not ?
Theœ.
What being desirous to point out respecting them, and to bring forward as a pattern, have you made this inquiry in general terms ?
Guest.
All the names that have been mentioned, are in a certain respect divisive.
Thecæ.
They are.
Guest.
According to my reasoning then we will think worthy of one name the art, which as regards them is one in them all.[25.]
Theœ.
What name calling it ?
Guest.
Discriminative.
Theœ.
Be it so.
Guest.
Consider again, whether we are able to perceive two kinds of it ?
Theœ.
You are imposing, for a person like me, a rapid consideration.
Guest.
In the discriminations mentioned above it was our business to separate the worse from the better, and the similar from the similar.
Thecæ.
It appears that it was nearly so said.
Guest.
Of the latter (discrimination) I cannot tell the name;
but I can of that which leaves the better and rejects the worse.
Theœ.
Inform me what it is.
Guest.
The whole of this discrimination, as I understand it, is called by all men a certain purification.
Thecæ.
It is so called.
Guest.
Would not then every one see that the purification is in kind twofold ?
Thecæ.
Yes, (looking at it) at leisure perhaps;
but I do not see it at present.[26.]
Guest.
It is proper then to comprehend in one name the many kinds of purifications appertaining to the body.
Theœ.
What (are they) ?
and by what name (do you call them) ?
Guest.
Whatever within the bodies of living animals is, after being properly separated by the arts of exercise and of medicine, purified, and whatever the bath-art supplies, re­ lating to things outside (the body) very vile to mention, and the things relating to inanimate bodies, of which the fuller's art, and the whole art of adorning the body, have the care in trifling matters, possess many and seemingly ridiculous names.
32Theœ.
Very much so.
Guest.
Entirely so,33 Theætetus.
But the method of rea­ soning cares not either much or little about the art of wip­ ing with a sponge or the drinking a medicine, whether the one benefits us little and the other much, by a purifica­ tion.
Since for the sake of the mind possessing something correctly,34 (science)35 endeavours to understand what is allied and what is not allied to all arts, and it honours all equally on this account;
and does not consider that some things are more ridiculous than others as regards their simili­ tude ;
nor has it held that he, who exhibits the hunting art in the character of a general, is at all more respectable than (he who does so) in that of a louse-catcher, but is for the most part more vain.36 [27.]
And now, indeed, which was what you asked, by what name shall we speak of all the powers together which are allotted for the purifying a body either animate or inanimate?
But it makes no difference what name may appear to be more becoming.
Let it be only separate from the purgations of the soul, and include (in it­ self) all such things as purify any thing else.
For (the method of reasoning) has just now endeavoured to separate the in­ tellect from the rest of things, if we understand what it means.
Theœ.
But I do understand, and I grant that there are two species of purification;
one species respecting the soul, and separate from that respecting the body.
Guest.
(You speak) in the most beautiful manner.
Listen then to me in what follows, and endeavour to give a two-fold division to what has been said.
Thecæ.
Wherever you may lead, I will endeavour to make a division with you.
Guest.
We say, then, that depravity in the soul is some­ thing different from virtue.
Guest.
And that to leave the one, and to cast out as far as may be the bad, was a purification.
Theœ.
It was so.
Guest.
Of the soul then, as far as we can discover a taking away of depravity, we shall, in calling it a purification, speak harmoniously.
Theœ.
Yes, very much so.
Guest.
As regards the soul, then, we must speak of two kinds of depravity.
Thes.
What are they?' Guest.
The one is like a disease in the body, but the other is like an inherent baseness.
Theœ.
I do not understand.
Guest.
Perhaps you have not thought that disease is the same with sedition.
Theœ.
Nor, again, have I what I ought to answer to this.
Guest.
Whether do you think sedition is any thing else than the difference from a natural alliance through a certain corruption.
Theœ.
It is nothing else.
Guest.
And is baseness any thing else than that kind of dissonance which exists37 every where disagreeable?
Theœ.
It is nothing else.[29.]
Guest.
What then, have we not perceived in the soul of those who conduct themselves ill, opinions at variance with desires, anger with pleasures, reason with pain, and all these with each other ?
Thecæ.
And very much so.
Guest.
And yet all (these) are necessarily allied to each other.
Theœ.
How not ?
Guest.
In calling then depravity a sedition and disease of the soul, we shall speak correctly.
Theœ.
Most correctly.
Guest.
But when such things as participate of motion, and propose to themselves a certain end, are, in attempting to reach it, carried according to each impulse beside it, and miss it, shall we say that they are affected thus through a con­ gruity towards each other, or, on the contrary, through an incongruity ?
Theœ.
It is evident through an incongruity.
Guest.
But we know that every soul is involuntarily ignorant of any thing.
Theœ.
Very much so.
Guest.
But ignorance is nothing else than a delirium of the soul, which, while it is impelled to truth, is carried away from a (correct) perception.
38Theœ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
We must consider, therefore, a soul without intelli­ gence as base and incongruous.
Theœ.
So it appears.[30.]
Guest.
It seems then there are these two kinds of evil in the soul ;
one, which is called by the multitude de­ pravity, and is most evidently its disease-Theœ.
It is.
Guest.
But the other (the multitude) call ignorance;
but they are unwilling to confess that it alone39 is a vice in the soul.
Theœ.
It must be readily granted, what, when you just now spoke of it, I doubted, that there are two kinds of vice in the soul;
and that we ought to consider cowardice, intem­ perance, injustice, all taken together as a disease in us;
but we must lay down the accident of ignorance great and of various kinds as a baseness.
Guest.
In the body then are there not two arts relating to these two accidents ?
Theœ.
What are they ?
Guest.
Relating to baseness, the gymnastic;
but to disease, the medical.
Theœ.
They seem so.
Guest.
As regards insolence, injustice, and cowardice, is not the chastising [justice]40 naturally the most fitting of all arts ?
Theœ.
It is likely, as I may say,41 according to human opinion.
Guest.
But can any one say that there is a more proper (remedy)42 for all ignorance than the teaching art.
Theœ.
There is none.[31.]
Guest.
Come then, must we say there is only one kind of the teaching art, or more ?
But take notice, that there are two greatest kinds of it.
43Theœ.
I do take notice.
Guest.
And it appears to me that we shall very quickly discover this.
Theœ.
In what way ?
Guest.
By perceiving whether ignorance has a division in the middle of it.
For being twofold, it is evident that it compels the teaching art to have two parts, one for each one of its own.
Theœ.
What then ?
Has the thing sought become visible ?
Guest.
I seem to see set apart a great and difficult kind of ignorance, which outweighs all its other parts.
Theœ.
Of what kind is it?
Guest.
When he, who does not know a thing, thinks he knows it;
through which it nearly happens that all those things, in which we are deceived by the imagination, take their rise in the case of all persons.
Theœ.
True.Guest.
And I think that to this (division) of ignorance alone the name of non-erudition should be given.
Theœ.
Entirely so.[32.]
Guest.
By what name then is to be mentioned that part of the teaching art which frees (a person) from this (ignorance) ?
Theœ.
I think, Guest, that the other part is called handi­ craft teaching, but that this is called here through us dis­ cipline.
44Guest.
It is so called, Theætetus, by nearly all the Greeks.
But this also must be considered by us, whether the whole of this is indivisible, or possesses a certain division worthy a name.
Theœ.
It is requisite to consider this.
Guest.
It appears then to me, that this may in some way be still further divided.
Theœ.
In what?
Guest.
Of the teaching art relating to discourses, one way appears to be more rough, but another part of it more smooth.
Theœ.
Of what kind shall we call each of these ?
Guest.
One, the old-fashioned, paternal, which persons for­ merly adopted, especially towards their children, and many use even now, when children do wrong, partly by severely re- reproving, and partly by mildly admonishing them.
Now the whole of this one may call most correctly admonition.
Theœ.
It is so.[33.]
Guest.
But the other45—since some seem, after giving themselves to reflection, to hold that all ignorance is involuntary, and that no one, who thinks himself wise, is will­ ing to learn those things in which he considers himself skilled, and that the admonitory kind of instruction, even with great labour, effects but little.
Theœ.
And they think right.
Guest.
They therefore direct their course to an outlet for their opinion by another mode.
Theœ.
By what mode ?
Guest.
They inquire into those matters, about which a man thinks he says something to the purpose, when he is saying nothing.
They then easily examine the opinions of persons as if they were in error, and bringing them together by a reasoning process to the same point, they place them by the side of each other;
and by so placing, they show that the opinions are at one and the same time contrary to themselves, about the same things, with reference to the same circum­ stances, and according to the same premises.
And they see­ ing46 are indignant with themselves, and become milder towards others;
and in this way are liberated from strong and harsh opinions ;
a liberation of all others the most pleasant to hear, and the most firm to the party suffering. [34.]
For they, my dear boy, who purify these, think as physicians do with respect to the body-that the body cannot enjoy food, which is brought to it, until some one casts out the impediments in it;
and in like manner the others think that the soul can derive no advantage from the learning brought to it, until some one, by confuting, places the party confuted in a state of shame, and by taking away the opinions, which are the impediments to learning, exhibits him purified, and thinking that he knows those things alone which he does know, and nothing more.
Theœ.
This is the best and the most temperate of habits.
Guest.
For all these reasons then, Theætetus, we must say, that confutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications;
and, we must think that he who is not confuted, even though he should be the great king himself, would be unpurified to the greatest degree, and become uninstructed and ugly with respect to those things, in which it is fit that he should be most pure and beautiful, who is to be in reality happy.[35.]
Theœ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But whom shall we say employ this art ?
For I fear to say the sophists.
Theœ.
Why so?
Guest.
Lest we should place on them a greater honour than is fitting.
Theœ.
But yet what has been just now said appears to be suited to some such character.
Guest.
So does a wolf (resemble) a do- a most savage animal one the most mild.
But he who wishes to be most of all free from stumbling, ought to keep ever a guard on simili­ tudes ;
for it is a most slippery race.
Let them however stand, for I think there will not be a dispute about trifling defini­ tions, at a time when persons are watching them sufficiently.
TheB.
It is not likely at least.
Guest.
Let then there be of the separating art one portion, the purifying;
of the purifying, let the part relating to the soul be divided off;
and of this let (a part) be the teaching art;
and of the teaching art, let instruction (be a part) ;
and of instruction, let that confutation, which takes place respect­ ing a vain opinion of wisdom, be called, through the reason now exhibited, nothing else than the sophistic art of a noble race.[36.]
Theœ.
Let it be so called.
But in consequence of so many things having just now presented themselves, I am doubtful what, as speaking the truth and urging it strenu­ ously, I ought to say the sophist really is.
Guest.
You are very properly in doubt.
And indeed one ought to think, that even a sophist himself will now very much doubt by what means he shall slip through the argu­ ment.
For the proverb rightly says, It is not easy to avoid all (traps).
Now therefore let us attack him with all our might.
TheB.
You speak well.
Guest.
But, in the first place, let us stand and as it were take breath;
and while stopping let us reason among ourselves.
Come then, in how many forms has the sophist appeared ?
For I think, he was found at first a hunter for wages of the youth­ ful and rich.
Theœ.
He was.
Guest.
Secondly, a certain trafficker in the learning of the soul.
Theœ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Thirdly, did he not appear as a chapman in the very same articles ?
Theœ.
He did.
And fourthly, he was the seller of his own inventions.
Guest.
You have properly reminded me of this;
and of the fifth (form) I will endeavour to remind you.
For he was a combatant in the contests of words, having been (so) defined from the art of contention.47[37.]
Theœ.
He was so.
Guest.
The sixth form is indeed ambiguous;
but neverthe­ less we laid it down and conceded to him,48 that a sophist is a purifier, as regards the soul, of such opinions as are an im­ pediment to learning.
Theœ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Do you then perceive, that, when any one seems to know many things, and is called by the name of one art, this it is not a healthful seeming;
but that he, who is thus affected with respect to any art, evidently cannot see that part of it to which all this learning tends ?
and hence he 49 calls the person possessing them by many names, instead of one.
Theœ.
This almost appears to be very natural.
Guest.
Let us not then suffer the same 50 thing in this search through indolence;
but let us in the first place take up again one of the things stated of the sophist;
for one of them appeared to me especially to indicate him.
Them.
Which of them ?
Guest.
We said that he was in a certain respect a contra­ dictor.
Theœ.
We did.
Guest.
And does he not also become a teacher of this to others ?
Thecæ.
How not ?[38.]
Guest.
Let us then consider about what such per­ sons say they make contradictions.
And let our consideration be from the beginning in this way.
With respect to divine things, which are non-apparent to the many, do sophists make them able to do this, (viz. to contradict) ?
Theœ.
This is indeed asserted of them.
Guest.
But with respect to the apparent things of earth and heaven, and what pertains to these ?
Theœ.
Why not?
Guest.
In private meetings at least, when any thing is asserted of generation and existence in general, we are con­ scious that the sophists are powerful in contradicting, and that they make others as powerful as themselves.
Theœ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But with respect to laws, and all political matters, do they not also promise to make men contentious in these ?
Theœ.
Not one, as I may say, would discourse with them unless they promised this.
Guest.
But writings relating to all the arts, and to each art singly, are made public and deposited by him, who wishes to learn what he ought to say against each handicraftsman.
Theœ.
You appear to me to speak of the writings of Pro­ tagoras about wrestling and the other arts.
Guest.
And to the writings of many others, 0 blessed man.
But does not the art of contradicting seem to be a power sufficient for controversy about all things, (to speak) sum­ marily ?
Thecæ.
It appears that scarcely not a thing would be wanting.[39.]
Guest.
But by the gods, 0 boy, do you think this is possible?
For perhaps you young men see more acutely, but we more dully, this thing.
Theœ.
What thing?
and at what are you particularly talking ?
For I do not understand at all the present ques­ tion.
Guest. (Consider,) if it be possible for any one man to know all things.
Thecæ.
If it were possible our race, 0 guest, would indeed be blessed.
Guest.
How then can any one without knowledge him­ self be able to urge any thing sound against him who pos­ sesses knowledge ?
Theœ.
Not at all.
Guest.
What then would be the wonder in the sophistic power ?
Theœ.
About what ?
Guest.
The manner by which sophists are able to get up an opinion amongst the young, that they are the wisest of all men in all things.
For it is evident that, if they nei­ ther contradicted rightly, nor appeared to the young to do so, and, when appearing to do so, unless they seemed to be more wise through their contentions, no one would, as far as your business is concerned, even at leisure,51 give them money, or be willing to become their scholar.
Thecæ.
Not even at leisure indeed.
Guest.
But now persons are willing.
Theœ.
And very much so.
Guest.
For the sophists appear I think to have a knowledge themselves of that against which they speak.
Thecæ.
How should they not ?
Guest.
But do they act so in all things ?
Say we it ?
Theœ.
Yes.
Guest.
They appear, then, to their disciples to be wise in all things.
Theœ.
How not ?
Guest.
But not being so in reality;
for this appeared to be impossible.
Theœ.
For how is it not impossible ?
Guest.
The sophist, then, has been shown to us to possess a certain kind of a reputation for knowledge about all things, but not according to the truth.
Theœ.
Entirely so.
And what has been now said respect­ ing sophists seems very nearly to be most rightly said.[40.]
Guest.
Let us therefore take a clearer pattern re­ specting them.
Thece.
What is that ?
Guest.
This.
But endeavour to answer by giving your mind very closely to what I am saying.
Theœ.
Of what kind is the pattern ?
Guest.
As if any one should say, that he knows not (the art of) asserting and contradicting, but of making and causing all things by one art.
Theœ.
How said you all ?
Guest.
Of the commencement of the discourse you are straightway ignorant;
for, as it seems, you do not understand the "all."Theœ.
I do not.
Guest.
I say then that you and I are in the number of all things, and besides us, there are other animals and trees.
Theœ.
How say you ?
Guest.
If any one should assert that he would make you and me, and all the rest of productions-Theœ.
Of what making do you speak?
For you are not speaking of a husbandman;
because you mentioned him as a maker of animals.
Guest.
I say, moreover, that he is the maker of the sea, the earth, the heavens, the gods, and all other things ;
and rapidly making each of these, he sells them for a small sum.
Theœ.
You are speaking in jest.
Guest.
What!
must we not consider that as a jest, when a man asserts that he knows all things, and can teach another all things, for a small sum of money, and in a short time ?
Theœ.
Entirely so.[41.]
Guest.
But have you any kind of jesting more arti­ ficial or agreeable than the imitative ?
Theœ.
I have not.
For you have mentioned a very large kind, and comprehended all things in one, and that one nearly the most varied.
Guest.
Do we not then know that he who undertakes to be able to make all things by one art, will, by fabricating imitations and homonyms82 of things, through the art of painting, be able, by showing the pictures at a distance, to lie concealed from the stupid amongst young men (and) boys, as being a person most competent to do whatever lie pleased ?
Thes.
How not?
Guest. 53
But as to discourses, do we not expect that there is such another art ?
or is it not possible to bewitch the young men, and those still standing far off from the truth of things, through words (spoken) in their ears, and by showing them images, as they are called, of every thing, so as to cause them to be said to seem true, and for the speaker to be the wisest of all men in all things?
53[42.]
Theœ.
Why should there not be another such art ?
Guest.
Is it not then necessary, Theætetus, that the ma­ jority of those, who were then hearing, should, after a suf­ ficient time has passed and they have themselves arrived at manhood, come near to things as they are, and be compelled through accidental circumstances to handle realities clearly, and to change their former opinions, so that things (once) great appear small, those (once) difficult, easy, and all the mere appearances produced by discourses, are entirely over­ thrown through works which occur in practice ?
TheB.
It appears so to me, as far as my age is capable of judging;
for I think that I too am one of those who are far distant (from the truth).
Guest.
All we then, who are present, will endeavour, and let us now endeavour,54 free from all accidental circumstances, to bring you as near as possible (to the truth).
With respect to a sophist then tell me this.
Is it clear, that he is one of enchanters, as being an imitator of things ?
or do we yet doubt, whether in the matters, respecting which he appears able to contradict, he possesses in reality the requisite science ?
Theœ.
But how, Guest, can we (doubt of this) ?
For it is nearly evident from what has been said, that he is one of those who take a part in jesting.
Guest.
We must put him down then as some enchanter and mimic.[43.J
Theœ.
How must we not so put him ?
Guest.
Come then, it is now our business not to let go the wild beast, for we have now nearly enclosed the sophist in a cast­ ing net, one of the instruments used in discourses about things of this kind,55 so that he cannot any longer escape from this.
Theœ.
From what ?
Guest.
That he is one of the wonder-workers.
Theœ.
This also is my opinion respecting him.
Guest.
It is decreed then, that we divide as quickly as pos­ sible the image-producing art, and, going down against it, seize upon the sophist, should he forthwith86 wait for us, ac­ cording to the royal mandate, and, delivering him up, exhibit our prey to him (the king).
But if he creeps into the parts of the imitative art, we are to follow him, always dividing the part which receives him, until he is caught.
For neither will he, nor any other genus, ever boast to escape the method of those, who are able to follow thus the points singly and universally.
Thecæ.
You speak well.
And in this manner, therefore, we must act.[44.]
Guest.
According to the preceding method of divi­ sion, I now seem to see two kinds of the imitative art;
but in which of these happens to be the idea of which we are in search, I do not now seem to be able to perceive.
Theæ.
But first tell me, and divide the two kinds of which you are speaking.
Guest.
I see that one is the assimilative art.
And this especially takes place, when any one according to the propor­ tions of the original, in length, breadth, and depth, and more­ over by adding fitting colours, works out the production of an imitation.
Thece.
What then, do not all imitators endeavour to do this ?
Guest.
Not such as mould or paint any great work.
For, if they would give the true proportion of beautiful things, you know that the upper parts would appear smaller than is fit­ ting, and the lower parts larger, through the former being seen by us at a distance, and the latter close at hand.
Thece.
Entirely so.[45.]
Guest.
Do not then the artists, bidding farewell to truth, now work out not real proportions, but such as will seem to be beautiful in their representations?
Theæ.
Entirely so.- Guest.
Is it not then just, as being at least probable,57 to call one an Image ?
Thes.
Yes.
Guest.
And we must call the part of the imitative art, sub­ sequent to this, as we said above, assimilative.
Theæ.
We must so call it.
Guest.
But what shall we call that, which appears indeed similar to the beautiful, 58 through the view taken from a fa­ vourable point,58 but which, (when seen by him 59) who has the power to look on such things sufficiently,60 is not like that to which it professes to be like ?
Must we not (call it) an appearance, since it appears to be, but is not like ?
Theæ.
Undoubtedly.
Guest.
Is not this part to be found abundantly in painting, and in the whole of the imitative art ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But may we not most correctly call that art, which produces an appearance, but not an image, phantastic ?
Theæ.
Very much so.
Guest.
Now I have already said that these were the two kinds of the image-producing art, the assimilative and phan­ tastic.
Theæ.
Correctly so.[46.]
Guest.
But that of which I doubted then, viz. in which of these kinds we must put the sophist, I am not at all able even now to see clearly.
For the man is truly wonderful;
and it is extremely difficult to get a view of him ;
since even now, very well and cleverly, he has fled into a species, where it is hard to track him out.
Theæ.
So it seems.
Guest.
Do you then assent to this through understanding it ?
or has a certain rush of reasoning carried you away to giving a rapid assent according to custom ?61Theæ.
How and for what do you say this ?
Guest.
We are, 0 blessed man, truly engaged in a specula­ tion thoroughly difficult.
For that this thing should appear both to seem to be, and yet not be;
and that a man should assert certain things, and yet not true,-all these things (were) always full of difficulty formerly, and are now.
For he, who thus 62 speaks, must either say or think that false things truly exist;
and thus speaking, Theætetus, it is extremely difficult for him not to be hampered by a self-contradiction.[47.]
Theæ.
Why so?
Guest.
(Because) such a mode of speaking dares to suggest that a nonentity exists;
for otherwise there would not be a falsehood, which exists.
And the great Parmenides, 0 boy, while we were yet boys, did from the first to the last testify to this.
For, both in prose and verse, he on every occasion thus speaks, " You must not (think)," says he, " non-entities exist;
but keep thy thoughts when searching from this road."
This then is both testified by him, and this discourse will the most of all point it out, if examined with moderation.
Let us then, if it makes no difference to you, consider this in the first place.
Theæ.
Put my business where you like.
But in what way the discourse will best proceed, do you consider yourself, and lead me along in that path.
Guest.
It will be proper so to do.
Tell me, then.
Dare we pronounce that which in no respect is ?
Theæ.
How not ?[48.]
Guest.
If then, not for the sake of contention nor of jesting, but in seriousness, it were necessary for any of the hearers to join with us in considering and stating to what point one ought to carry the word "non-entity," for what thing and of what kind do we think he would be able 63 to use it himself, and to show (its use) to a person inquiring?
Theæ.
You ask a difficult question, and to a person like my­ self utterly insurmountable.
Guest.
This however is evident, that to any one of entities the expression of non-entity cannot be referred.
Theæ.
For how could it ?
Guest.
Since then it cannot be referred to an entity, one cannot rightly refer it to any thing.
Theæ.
How could he ?
Guest.
And this too is evident to us, that we pronounce on each occasion this word "something" respecting an entity.
For it is impossible to pronounce it alone, as if it were naked and placed in a desert from all entities.
Theæ.
It is impossible.
Guest.
Thus considering, do you then agree with me, that he who pronounces the word "something," must necessarily mean some one thing ?
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
For you will say, that the word " something " is a sign of one thing, and that " somethings " is a sign of many things.
Thecæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But it is most necessary, as it appears, that he who speaks of that, which is not something, must speak entirely of nothing.
Theæ.
This is most necessary.
Guest.
Is not then this to be granted, that such a person speaks indeed, but speaks of nothing ?
But neither must we say that he speaks, who endeavours to enunciate non-entity?
64Theæ.
The discourse would have then an end of doubt.[49.]
Guest.
Do not as yet speak any big word.
For, 0 blessed man, the greatest and first of doubts still remain as re­ gards these things:
for it happens to be about the very com­ mencement of it (the discourse).
Theæ.
How say you ?
Speak, and do not hesitate.
Guest.
To that, which is, something else may be added of things that are.
Thecæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But to that, which is not, shall we say that something can be added of things that are ?
Thecæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Now we place number universally among things that are.
Theæ.
If indeed any thing else is to be placed as a thing that is.
Guest.
Let us then not attempt to attribute the many," nor " the one," to a non-entity.
Theæ.
We cannot it seems65 with propriety attempt it, as reason says.
Guest.
How then can any one enunciate by the mouth, or comprehend at all by intellect, non-entities, or a non-entity, apart from number ?
Thecæ.
Tell me why not.
Guest.
When we speak of non-entities, do we not endeavour to add " the many " of number ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
And (when we speak of) a non-entity, (do we) not (endeavour to adjoin) " the one " (of number) ?
Theæ.
Yes, most clearly.
Guest.
And yet we say, that it is neither just nor right to endeavour to add an entity to a non-entity.
Theæ.
You speak most truly.
Guest.
You perceive then, that it is not possible correctly to enunciate, or speak of, or think of, a non-entity itself by itself;
but that it is incomprehensible, unspeakable, unpronounceable, and irrational?
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Did I, then, just now speak falsely, when I said, that I would tell of the greatest doubt respecting it ?
Theæ.
What then, can we mention any (doubt) greater than this ?
Guest.
Do you not see, 0 wonderful youth, from what has been said, that non-entity leads him, who confutes it, into such a perplexity, that in the very attempt to confute it, he is com­ pelled to contradict himself?
Thecæ.
How say you ?
Speak yet clearer.
Guest.
For me there is no occasion to consider any thing clearer.
For, when I laid down the proposition, that non-en­ tity ought to participate neither of "the one," nor of "the many," both a little before and now, I said " the one " abstractedly.
For I was speaking of a non-entity;
you perceived this ?
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
And again, a little before, I said that a non-entity was unspeakable, ineffable, and irrational.
Do you follow me ?
Theæ.
I do follow in a certain way.
Guest.
When, therefore, I endeavoured to fit entity (to non­ entity), did I not say what is contrary to former (assertions) ?
Theæ.
You appear so.
Guest.
What then, did I not, when attributing this to it, speak to it 66 as to one thing ?
Thes.
Yes.
Guest.
And yet, while calling it irrational, ineffable, and unspeakable, did I not make the assertion as pertaining to one thing ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
For we say, that if any one correctly speaks of non­ entity, he ought to define it neither as one, nor many, nor give it any appellation whatever;
for it would be called al­ ready one thing, according to this appellation.67[51.]
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
What then will some one say of me ?
For, both for­ merly and now, he will find me overthrown respecting the proof of a non-entity.
So that, as I have already said, let us not think, in my speaking at least, of logical precision respect­ in- a non-entity.
But come, let us now consider this affair in your speaking.
TheB.
How say you ?
Guest.
Come, endeavour in a becoming and noble manner, as being a young man, and exerting yourself with all your might, pronounce something about non-entity, conformable to right reason, without adding to it either existence, or the one or the many of number.
Theæ.
The readiness of my attempt would be vastly absurd, were I, after seeing you suffer thus, to make it.
Guest.
But, if it seems good, let us dismiss both you and myself with a farewell;
and until we meet with some one who is able to do this, let us say that the sophist has, with a knavery greater than all, let himself down into a place from which there is no outlet.[52.]
Theæ.
So indeed it appears.
Guest.
If then we should say that he possessed a certain fan­ cy-effecting art, he would, from his use of words, easily lay hold of us, and turn the discourse to the very contrary point.
For when we call him a maker of images, he will immediately ask us, What do we assert an image to be universally.
It is meet then, Theætetus, to consider what answer to this question should one give to the young man.
Theæ.
It is evident that we shall say that things seen in water and mirrors are images, and moreover such things as are painted and fashioned and the rest of other things of this kind.
Guest.
It is evident, Theætetus, that you have never seen a sophist.
Theæ.
Why so ?
Guest.
He will appear to you to wink, or to have no eyes at all.
Thece.
How so ?
Guest.
When you give him this answer,68 should you speak of any thing (seen) in mirrors or mouldings, he will laugh at:
your reasons ;
when you speak to him as being able to see, he will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors, or water, or of sight at all, but will ask you of that, which depends on reason alone.
Thecæ.
What is that ?
Guest.
That, which in all those things you have mentioned, you, speaking of as many, think fit to call by one name, pro­ nouncing the word image as being in them all one thing.
Speak then and defend yourself, and yield nothing to the man.[53.]
Thece.
What then, 0 guest, can we say an image is, except that it is made to resemble -the truth, being another thing the counterpart ?
Guest.
Do you say that such other thing is truly so, or to what do you apply the expression, such other ?
Theæ.
It is by no means truly a such other, but only seems to be.
Guest.
Do you then call a truth a real entity ?
Theæ.
I do.
Guest.
But is not that, which is not true, contrary to truth ?
Thece.
How not ?Guest. 69 You say then that the seeming is not an entity, if you assert that it is not a truth.
It is however an entity.
Thecæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Do you not say then truly ?
Thece.
Certainly not, except a likeness in reality.
Guest.
That then which is not really a non-entity, is really that which we call a likeness.
69Theæ.
It nearly appears that non-entity is entwined by a certain connexion of this kind with entity;
and it is very strange.
Guest.
How is it possible it should not be strange?
You now therefore perceive that through this alternation, the many-headed sophist compels us unwillingly to confess that non-entity does somehow exist.
Theæ.
I see it, and very much so.[54.]
Guest.
How, then, shall we define his art, and yet be able to be consistent with ourselves ?
Theæ.
Why do you speak thus, and of what are you afraid ?
Guest.
When we say that he is a deceiver about an appear­ ance, and that his is a certain deceptive art, whether shall we say that our soul then has a false opinion, through his art ?
or what shall we say ?
Theæ.
This very thing.
For what else can we say ?
Guest.
But will false opinion be fancying things contrary to those that are ?
Theæ.
Contrary.
Guest.
You say then that false opinion fancies things that are not.
Theæ.
It does so of necessity.
Guest.
Whether does it fancy that non-entities do not exist, or that non-entities do exist in a certain way ?
Theæ.
If any one is ever deceived even a little, he must (fancy)70 that non-entities do exist in a certain way.
Guest.
And will not entities entirely be likewise fancied not to exist at all ?
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
And this too falsely ?
Theæ.
Yes, this too.
Guest.
And false reasoning will, I think, be deemed, in the same way, to assert that entities do not exist, and non-entities do exist.[55].
Theæ.
For how can it otherwise become such (viz. false) ?
Guest.
Nearly not at all.
But the sophist will not say so.
Or what device.
is there for any one of a sound mind to concede;
when 71 the things that have been granted before these71 have been admitted to be unspeakable, ineffable, irrational, and incomprehensible?
Do we understand what ( the sophist) says, Theætetus ?
Thecæ.
How is it possible we should not?
For he will assert that we are saying things contrary to the present, in having dared to assert that falsehoods exist in opinions and reasons ;
72 for that having been often compelled to unite entity to non-entity, we have just now acknowledged, that this is somehow the most impossible of all things.
Guest.
You have rightly recalled (me to the argument .
But it is now time to consult about what we ought to do respecting the sophist.
For, if we should attempt to search him out, by placing him in the art of falsehood-workers and enchanters, you see that his counter-graspings will be easy and (our) difficulties many.
Thecæ.
Very.
Guest.
We have then gone through only a small part of them;
since they are, as I may say, boundless.
Thecæ.
If such is the case, it would be impossible, it seems, to catch the sophist.[56.]
Guest.
What then, shall we now stand cowardly aloof ?
Thecæ.
I say we ought not, if we are able by ever so little to lay hold in some way of the man.
Guest.
You will then grant me pardon, and, as you just now said, be satisfied, if we can draw by some means even a little for ourselves out of such powerful reasoning.
Thecæ.
How shall I not ?
Guest.
This too I beg of you still further.
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
That you do not think I am become, as it were, a parricide.
Thecæ.
Why so ?
Guest.
Because it will be necessary for us, in self-defence, to put to the torture the reasoning of my father Parmenides, and to compel a nonentity to exist in some way, and again an entity in some way not to exist.
Thecæ.
It appears that we must battle in our reasonings for a thing of this kind.
Guest.
For how should this not be evident, as it is said, even to a blind man ?
For, while these things are neither confuted nor confessed, any one will be able to speak at lei­ sure about false assertions, or opinions respecting resemblances, or images, or imitations, or appearances, or of the arts con­ versant with these, without being ridiculous through his being compelled to contradict himself.
Theæ.
Most true.
Guest.
Hence we, mustdare to oppose my father's reason­ ing, or we must dismiss it altogether, if any sluggishness restrains us from doing so (viz. opposing it).
Theæ.
But let nothing by any means restrain us.
Guest.
I will now beg of you still a third and trifling request.
Thecæ.
Only mention it.
Guest.
I just now stated that I was always faint-hearted about the confutation of these points, and so I am now.
Theæ.
You did say so.
Guest.
I fear as regards what has been said, lest I seem to you to be insane, through my changing myself on the instant, up and down.
For we will throw ourselves on the confutation of the reasoning, for your sake, if indeed we happen to confute it.
Theæ.
As you will not then by any means appear to me to act improperly by advancing to the confutation and de­ monstration, on this account at least advance boldly.
Guest.
Come then, what beginning shall we make to this very danger-bringing discourse?
Now it appears, 0 boy, to be most necessary for us to turn to this road.[58.]
Theæ.
What?
Guest. 73
To consider first those things which now seem to be clear, lest we become flurried about them;
and that we without difficulty assent to each other, as if we were in a position to judge correctly.
73Theæ.
State more clearly what you mean.
Guest.
Both Parmenides and whoever else has rushed for­ ward to the trial respecting the defining the quantity and quality of entities, seems to me to have discussed the ques­ tion loosely.
74Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Each seem to me to have told a tale to us, as if we were boys.
One of them said that the entities are three;
75 but that some of them at one time are at war with each other in some manner;
and at another, becoming friends, are mar­ ried, bring forth, and furnish food to their offspring.
But another 76 said that the entities are only two, the moist and the dry, or the hot and the cold;
and these he unites in one house and gives them (in marriage) to each other.
But the Ele­ atic sect among us, which derives its origin from Xenophanes, and from others still prior to him, details in fables that what is called the all is really one.
But the Ionian,77 and subse­ quently some Sicilian 78 muses have thought it more safe to connect these with each other, and to say that entity is both many and one, but held together by enmity and friendship.
For that, which is separated, always comes together, say the more energetic 79 of the Muses.
But the more gentle 79 relax 79 (the doctrine by saying )80 that this takes place always as regards (the whole),80 but that the whole is in turn now one, and friendly (to itself),80 through Venus;
and now many, and hostile to itself, through a certain strife. [59.]
But whether any one has asserted all this truly or not,81 it is difficult and wrong to bring so great a reproach upon illustrious and ancient men.
81
This, however, I may without envy show forth.
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
That they greatly looked down upon, and held in little esteem, us the many.
For each of them finish their own work, without caring at all whether we follow them when speaking, or desert them.
Theæ.
How say you ?
Guest.
When any one of them asserts in his speech that­ many, or one or two, exist, or have been, or are in the course of production, and that the hot is mingled with the cold, (and) elsewhere lays down somehow discretions and concretions,— by the gods, Theætetus, do you understand what they are on each occasion asserting?
Indeed, when I was younger, I thought that when any one spoke of a non-entity I accurately understood that, which is now doubtful;
but now you see where we are in a difficulty respecting it.
Theæ.
I do see.[60.]
Guest.
Perhaps then, receiving in no less a degree the same feeling in our soul respecting an entity, we say we can easily understand it, when it is enunciated by any one ;
but not so, as regards the other, though similarly affected with re­ spect to both.
Theæ.
Perhaps so.
Guest.
And let this very same thing be said by us respect­ ing the other things before mentioned.
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
We will speculate then, after this, about the many things, if it seems good;
but let us now speculate about the greatest and first leading thing.
Theæ.
Of what are you speaking ?
Or is it plain that you assert that we ought in the first place to search after entity, and (see) what they, who speak of it, think they show.
Guest.
You understand me, Theætetus, on the instant.
For I say that we ought to adopt the same method, as if we were inquiring of them here present in this way.
Come, ye who assert that the hot and the cold, or any two such things, are the whole, what is it you affirm to subsist in both of these, when you say that both and each exist ?
What are we to understand by this term of yours " to exist" ?
Is it a third thing different from those two, and are we to lay down three things as the whole, and no longer two things, according to you ?
For, while you call one of the two an entity, you can­ not surely say that both are similarly an entity.
For in both ways there would nearly be one thing, and not two.
Thea.
You speak the truth.
Guest.
Are you then willing to call both of them an entity ?
Theæ.
Perhaps so.
Guest.
But, 0 friends, we shall say, you would thus most clearly call even the two things one.
Thecæ.
You speak most correctly.[61.]
Guest.
Since then we are thus in doubt, do you sufficiently explain to us what you wish to signify, when you pronounce (the word) entity ?
For it is evident that you are conversant with these things long ago ;
and we formerly thought (we knew them), but now we are in doubt.
Instruct us then, first in this very thing, that we may not fancy we un­ derstand what is asserted by you, when what is entirely contrary to this is taking place.
In speaking in this manner, and making this request, both to these, and to such others as assert that the all is more than one thing, shall we, 0 boy, do any wrong ?
Theæ.
By no means.
Guest.
But ought we not to inquire, to the utmost of our power, of those who assert that the all is one, what they call entity ?
Thece.
How not ?
Guest.
To this question then let them answer, Do you assert there is one thing alone ?
They will say, We do assert it.
Will they not ?
Thece.
Yes.
Guest.
What then, do you call entity a thing ?
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
Do you say, it is that which the one is, employing two names respecting the same thing ?
or how ?[62.]
Thece.
What answer will they have after this, 0 stranger ?
Guest.
It is evident, Theæetetus, that to him who lays down this hypothesis, it will not be the easiest thing of all to give an answer respecting the present question, or any other whatever.
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
To acknowledge that there are two names, while laying down that there is not but one thing, is surely ri­ diculous.
Thece.
How not?
Guest.
And to receive (the assertion) altogether from him, who says that a name is a thing possessing no value-82Thece.
In what manner ?
Guest.
He who lays down a name as different from a thing, speaks of two certain things.
Thecæ.
He does.
Guest.
And yet, if he lays down that the name is the same with the thing, he will be compelled to say, it is the name of nothing;
or, if he says it is the name of some­ thing, it will result that a name is only the name of a name, but of nothing else.
Thece.
It is so.
Guest.
And the one must be one entity alone of one, and not83 itself the entity of a name.
Thecæ.
It is necessary.
Guest.
But do they say that the whole is different from the one entity, or the same with it ?[63.]
Thecæ.
How will they not say it, and do say it ?84Guest.
If, then, a whole is, as Parmenides says, " Like the bulk of a sphere that is a perfect circle on all sides, and pos­ sessing equal powers on every part from the middle;
85 for there must needs be nothing greater or less on this side or on that;
" it is necessary for entity, being of such a kind, to have a middle and extremities;
and having these, there is every necessity for it to have parts.
Or how shall we say ?
Theæ.
Just so.
Guest.
But nothing prevents the divided from having in all its parts the accident of the one;
and in this way every entity and a whole would be one.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But is it not impossible that what suffers such acci­ dents should itself be the very one ?
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Surely according to right reason, that, which is truly the one, must be said to be entirely without parts.
Theæ.
It must indeed.
Guest.
But such a thing as consists of many parts would not harmonize with the one.
86Theæ.
I understand you.
Guest.
But whether will entity, having the accident of the one, be thus one, and whole ?
or must we by no means say that entity is a whole ?
Theæ.
You have proposed a difficult choice.
Guest.
You speak however most truly.
For entity having the accident to be in some way one, it does not appear to be the same as the one;
and the all will be more than one.
Is it not so ?
Theæ.
Yes.[64.]
Guest.
But yet if entity is not a whole, on account of its being subject to the accident belonging87 to the whole, and yet is the whole itself, it follows that entity is in want of itself.
88Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
And entity, according to this reasoning, being de­ prived of itself, will be a non-entity.
Theæ.
Just so.
Guest.
And thus again the all becomes more than one;
since both entity and the whole have obtained each their proper na­ ture, apart from the other.
Theæ.
True.
Guest.
And if the whole has not an existence at all, the very same things will take place with respect to entity ;
and in addition to its not having an existence, it would at no time have been produced.
Theæ.
Why so ?
Guest.
Whatever is produced is always produced as a whole.
So that he, who does not place amongst entities [the one or] 89 the whole, ought to speak neither of existence or production as an entity.
Theæ.
It appears that such is wholly the case.
Guest.
Moreover, that, which is not a whole, must not have the accident of any quantity whatever.
For, while it has the accident of quantity, whatever that may be, it must necessarily be a whole.[65.]
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Each (view) then will appear to have taken up ten thousand other endless doubts for him, who says that entity is either two or only one.
Theæ.
The light which is just now breaking almost shows (this).
For one thing is linked with another and brings with it a wandering (of the mind) greater and more dangerous respecting what has been from time to time asserted before.
Guest.
But we have not yet gone through the whole 90 of those, who have accurately discoursed about entity and non­ entity.
Let, however, (this) suffice.
And let us consider again those who speak.
inaccurately on these subjects, that we may perceive from all quarters, that it is in no respect more easy to say what entity is, than what non-entity is.
Theæ.
We must therefore march against them.
Guest.
Now, in truth, there appears to be among them, as it were, a kind of giants' war, through their conflicts with each other respecting existence.
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Some of them draw down to earth all things from heaven and the unseen region, unskilfully91 laying hold for this purpose of rocks and oaks.
For through their touching all such things as these, they strenuously contend that that alone exists, which affords impact and touch;
and they define body and existence to be the same.
But if any one says that of other things some have not a body, they thoroughly despise (the assertion), and are unwilling to hear another (word).
Theæ.
You have spoken of terrible men.
For I also have met with many such.[66.]
Guest.
Wherefore the opponents92 of these men very carefully defend themselves from on high, from the invisible re­ gion, and compel certain intelligible and incorporeal forms to be the true existence;
and breaking into small pieces the bodies of the others, and that, which is called by them truth, they do in their own discourses, instead of existence, talk of some produc­ tion carried on.
But between these, Theætetus, an immense contest has always existed respecting these matters.
Theæ.
True.
Guest.
Let us now, therefore, receive from both these races 93 an account in detail of the existence which they lay down.
Theæ.
But how shall we receive it ?
Guest.
From those that place existence in forms we may easily receive it;
for they are more mild ;
but from those who violently draw all things to body, with more difficulty.
And perhaps it will be nearly impossible.
It appears to me, however, that we ought to act with respect to them in this way.
Theæ.
In what ?
Guest.
Most of all to render them, if possible, better in deed;
but if we make no progress in this, let us render them so in word, by supposing them to answer more equitably than at pre­ sent they would be willing to do.
For that, which is assented to by better persons, possesses more authority than that (which is assented to) by worse.
However, we pay no attention to these things, but are seeking out the truth.
Theæ.
Most right.[67.]
Guest.
Order therefore those that have become bet­ ter to answer you, and to interpret what they assert.
Theæ.
Be it so.
Guest.
Let them say then whether they call a mortal ani­ mal a thing ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
And do they not acknowledge that this is an ani­ mated body ?
Theæ.
Certainly.
Guest.
Laying down that the soul is one of the things that exist.
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
But do they not say that one soul is just, and an­ other unjust;
and one prudent, and another imprudent?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But does not each soul become such through the habit and presence of justice, and the contrary (through the habit and presence) of the contraries ?
Theæ.
Yes;
to this likewise they assent.
Guest.
But will they say that what is able to be present to, and absent from, any thing, is' something ?
Theæ.
They say it.
Guest.
Since then justice and prudence, and the other vir­ tues, and their contraries, together with the soul in which they are implanted, exist, whether will they say that each of these is invisible and tangible, or that all of them are invisible ?
Theæ.
They will assert that nearly not one of them is visible.[68.]
Guest.
But what ?
Do they say that any one of such things has a body ?
Thecæ.
They do not give the same answer to the whole of this question;
but that the soul itself appears to them to pos­ sess a certain body;
but with respect to prudence, and each of the other things about which you just now inquired, they are ashamed to dare either to confess that they are not one of existing things, or to strenuously assert that all of them are bodies.
Guest.
The men, Theætetus, have clearly become better.
For such of them as are seed-sown,94 or earth-sprung,95 would not be ashamed to assert one of these points, but would con­ tend that whatever they cannot squeeze together with their hands, is altogether nothing.
Theæ.
You state very nearly what they think.
Guest.
Let us then again ask them.
For, if they are will­ ing to grant that even any trifling thing is incorporeal, it is, sufficient.
For they must say, with respect to these (incorpo­ real) and those (corporeal), which have a body born with them, what it is they look to, when they assert that both exist.[69.] 96 Theæ.
Perhaps, however, they would be in a dif­ ficulty.96 Guest.
But if they suffer any thing of this kind, consider whether, on our proposing the question, they would be willing to admit and confess that existence is a thing of this kind.
Theæ.
Of what kind ?
Speak, and we shall quickly know.
Guest.
I say then, that what possesses any power soever, whether of doing any thing naturally to another, or of suffering even the least thing from the vilest thing, although only once,­ every thing of this kind does really exist.
For I lay down a de­ finition by defining that existences are nothing else but power.
Theæ.
But since they cannot at present say any thing better than this, they receive it.
Guest.
It is well;
for perhaps hereafter both to us and them something different will appear.
Let this then here remain acknowledged by us on their account.
Theæ.
It shall remain.[70.]
Guest.
Let us now proceed to the others, the friends of forms.
And do you interpret to us what is said by them.
Theæ.
It shall be so.
Guest.
Do you then say that generation is one thing,97 and existence another, separating them in some way ?
Theæ.
We do.
Guest.
And that by body we communicate with generation, through sensation, but through reason by our soul with real existence, which you say is found for ever under the same circumstance in a similar manner, but that generation exists differently at different times ?
Theæ.
We do.
Guest.
But, ye best of men, what shall we say you mean by the communion between both ?
Is it not that which we just now mentioned?
Theæ.
What was that ?
Guest.
Passion or action arising from a certain power, from the concurrence of things with each other.
Perhaps,
Theætetus, you have not heard their answer to this question;
but I have, through my familiarity with them.
Theæ.
What answer then do they give ?[71.]
Guest.
They do not admit with us, what was just now said against the earth-born 98 respecting existence.
Theæ.
What was that ?
Guest.
We laid down as a sufficient definition of existence, (that it is) when the power is present to any thing, either of suffering or doing in the smallest point.
Theæ.
We did.
Guest.
To this they say, that a power of doing and suffer­ ing has a share with generation;
but that neither of these powers is adapted to existence.
Theæ.
Do they then not speak to the purpose ?
Guest.
To this we must say that we require to hear from them still more clearly, whether they acknowledge that the soul knows, and that existence is known.
Theæ.
They certainly say this.
Guest.
But do you say that to know, or to be krown, is action, or passion, or both ?
Or that passion is one thing, and (action) 99 another?
Or that neither of these has a share in any respect with the other?
Theæ.
It is evident that neither (has a share) with the other.
For, (if they admitted this,)100 they would contradict what they before asserted.
Guest.
I understand this at least, that if to know were to do something, it would necessarily happen that what is known would become passive.
And according to this reason­ ing, existence being known by knowledge, would, as far as it is known, be, through becoming passive, moved;
which we say cannot take place about the act of resting.
Theæ.
Rightly so.[72.]
Guest.
What then, by Zeus, shall we be easily per­ suaded that motion, life, soul, and prudence, are not truly present to that which is existing in perfection, and that it neither lives, nor thinks, but stands immovable, not possess­ ing an intellect as an object of respect and holy?
Theæ.
It would be a dreadful thing, 0 guest, to admit this.
Guest.
Shall we say then that it possesses intellect, but not life ?
Theæ.
And how ?
Guest.
But say we that both these reside in it, but shall we say that it does not possess these in soul at least ?
Theæ.
But after what other manner can it possess ?
Guest.
That it (possesses) 1 then at least intellect, life, and soul;
but that, though animated, it abides perfectly im­ movable ?
Thece.
All this appears to me at least to be irrational.
Guest.
We must therefore grant that both the moved and motion are existences.
Thecæ.
How not?
Guest.
It follows then, Theætetus, that intellect is never on any account in any way present to any one of things immovable.[73.]
Theæ.
It (follows) easily.
Guest.
And yet, if we grant that all things are borne along and moved, we shall by such an assertion take away this sameness from existences.
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Does it appear to you that what exists according to the same, and in a similar manner, and about the same, can ever exist without a standing ?
Theæ.
By no means.
Guest.
But do you perceive that intellect ever is or would be without these ?
Theæ.
Least (of all).
Guest.
And truly we should contend with every argu­ ment against him, who, causing science, or prudence, or intel­ lect to disappear, strenuously insists in behalf of any thing in any way whatever.
Thecæ.
And very much so.
Guest.
But there is every necessity, as it appears, for the philosopher, and him who honours these things the most on this account, not to listen at all to those, who, asserting that there is either one or many forms, admit that the whole stands still;
nor on the other hand, to those who are putting existence into motion by every means;
but to say, according to the prayer of boys, 2whatever are immovable, and have been moved, are both the being and the all.
2Theæ.
Most true.[74.]
Guest.
Do we not then appear to have now reason­ ably in our discourse comprehended existence ?
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Ho !
ho!
Theætetus, how do we now seem about to know the difficulty of the inquiry about it.
Thecæ.
How so ?
and why do you assert this ?
Guest.
Do you not perceive, 0 blessed man, that we are at present in the greatest ignorance respecting it ?
And yet we.
appear to ourselves to say something about it.
Theæ.
To myself at least.
But I do not very well under­ stand how we are unconsciously in this state.
Guest.
Consider more clearly, whether, by assenting to this, we should not be justly asked, as we have asked them, who said that the whole consisted of the hot and the cold.
Theæ.
Remind me what these questions were.
Guest.
By all means:
and I will endeavour to do this by asking you this, as I then asked them, that we may make some progress together.
Theæ.
Rightly so.[75.]
Guest.
Be it so.
Do you not say then, that motion and standing are contrary to each other ?
Thecæ.
How not ?
Guest.
And you surely say that both and each of them exist equally.
Theæ.
I do.
Guest.
Do you then say that both and each are moved, when you admit that they exist ?
Theæ.
By no means.
Guest.
But do you mean that they stand, when you say that both exist?
Guest.
Placing then existence, as a third thing, alongside these in your soul, and considering it as comprehending under itself standing and motion, and looking to their communion with existence, you have asserted that both of them exist.
Theæ.
We seem nearly to prophesy very truly that exist­ ence is a certain third thing, when we say that motion and standing exist.
Guest.
Existence then is not both motion and standing, but something different from them.
Theæ.
It appears so.
Guest.
Hence existence, according to its own nature, neither stands nor is moved.
Theæ.
It is nearly so.
Guest.
Whither then ought he to turn his thoughts, who wishes to fix in himself any clear conceptions respecting ex­ istence ?
Theæ.
Whither?
Guest.
To no point do I think it is yet easy for him (to turn).
For, if existence is not moved, why has it not stood still ?
Or on the other hand, why is that, which in no respect stands still, not moved?
But existence has just now appeared to us to be apart from both of these.
Is this, how­ ever, possible ?
Theæ.
It is the most impossible of all things.[76.]
Guest.
In the next place, then, it will be just to call to mind this.
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
That being asked what name non-entity ought to bear, we were hampered by the greatest difficulty.
Do you remember ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
Are we then in a less difficulty now respecting entity ?
Theæ.
We appear to be, 0 guest, if it be impossible to say so, in a greater.
Guest.
Let then this question of difficulty lie here.
But since both entity and non-entity have equally a share of diffi­ culty, there is now a hope that, if one of them shall appear more obscure, or more clear, the other will appear such likewise;
and on the other hand, if we should not be able to see either of them, (the other also will be in a similar state.)3
And thus we shall pursue,4 in the most becoming manner we can, the discourse respecting both of them together.
Theæ.
Very well.[77.]
Guest.
Let us state then after what manner we call on each occasion this same thing by many names.
Theæ.
Such as what ?
Give an example.
Guest.
In speaking of man we give him various appella­ tions, and attribute to him colour, figure, magnitude, vices, and virtues;
in all which, and ten thousand other particulars, we not only say that he is a man, but that he is good, and an infinity of other things:
and in the same manner we lay down other things, each as one, and we again call it many things, and by many names.
Theæ.
True.Guest.
Whence, I think, we have prepared a feast to young men, and to those old men who learn late in life.
5
For it is easy for every one immediately to lay hold (of the doctrine), that it is impossible for the many to be one, and the one many.
Hence they exult forsooth, not suffering us to say that a man is good, but that the good is a good, and the man a man.
For I think,
Theætetus, you have often met with those, who serious­ ly apply themselves to things of this kind, (and) sometimes (even)6 with rather elderly persons, who, through the poverty of their possessions with respect to wisdom, admire such things as these, and think they have discovered the very-wise thing itself.[78.]
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
That our discourse then may extend to all who have ever conversed at all respecting existence, let what will be now said in the way of interrogation, be for those and for the rest with whom we have before conversed.
Theæ.
What is this?
Guest.
Whether we should neither join existence to motion and standing, nor any thing else to any thing else;
but as if things were unmixed, and impossible to take a part with each other, we should place them thus (separate) in our dis­ course ?
Or whether we should bring all things to the same, as if they were able to take a part with each other ?
Or (only) some, and some not?
Which of these, Theætetus, shall we say they would prefer ?
Thece.
I indeed have nothing to answer to this on their behalf.
Why do you not, by answering each question, con­ sider what follows from each ?[79.]
Guest.
You say well;
and let us suppose them, if you please, to say, in the first place, that nothing has any power of communion with any thing for any thing.
Will not then motion and standing in no respect take a part of ex­ istence ?
Theæ.
They will not.
Guest.
But will either of them exist, not having a com­ munion with existence ?
Thece.
It will not.
Guest.
By this admission, all the doctrines, it seems, have become rapidly subverted, as well of those, who put all things in motion, as of those, who make (all things) stand like one, and of those, who assert that entities, according to forms, subsist ever under the same circumstances and in a similar manner.
For all these join existence at least (with their doctrines), some asserting that things are really moved, and others that they really stand.
Thece.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Moreover, such as at one time unite all things, and at another separate them, whether 7 dividing them into one and from one into infinite, or into finite elements, and composing from these,7 and whether they consider this as partially, or as always taking place,-in all these cases they will say nothing to the purpose, if there is in no respect a commin­ gling.[80.]
Thece.
Right.
Guest.
Further still, they will have gone through their dis­ course the most ridiculously of all men, who permitting no- thing to the communion of the accident of " different," (have thought proper) to use the appellation, " the other."
8Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
They are compelled somehow to employ about all things, "to be," and "apart," and "others," and by itself," and ten thousand other (expressions), from which being unable to abstain, and9 not to insert them in their discourses, they do not require others to confute them, but walk about, having, as the saying is, an enemy and an adversary at home, vocifer­ ating within, and always carrying, as it were, the absurd Eurycles 10 with them.
Theæ.
You really say what is similar and true.
11Guest.
But what if we permit all things to have the power of alternate communion with each other ?12 Thecæ.
This I myself am able to refute.
Guest.
How?
Theæ.
Because motion itself would entirely stand (still), and on the other hand, standing itself would be moved, if they were alternately mingled13 with each other.
Theæ.
But this indeed is impossible from the greatest necessity, for motion to stand still, and standing to be moved.
Theæ.
How not ?12 Guest.
The third thing therefore alone remains.
Theæ.
Yes.[81.]
Guest.
For one of these things is necessary;
either that all things should be commingled, or nothing;
or that some things should be willing to be commingled, and others not.
Theæ.
How not?
Guest.
Now it has been found that two cannot (be com­ mingled).
Theæ.
Just so.
Guest.
Every one therefore who wishes to answer rightly, will adopt that which remains of the three.
Theæ.
Very much so.
Guest.
But since some things are willing to do so, (be mingled,) and others not, they will be affected nearly in the same manner as letters.
For some of these do not fit with each other, but others do fit.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
For vowels being pre-eminently the bond, as it were, of the other (letters), it has come to pass, that without some one of them, it is impossible for any of the rest to fit one with the other.
Theæ.
And very much so.
Guest.
Does then every one know what letters will unite with what ?
or is there a need of art to him, who is about to do this sufficiently ?
Theæ.
Of art.
Guest.
What kind of art ?
Theæ.
The grammatic.[82.]
Guest.
What then, with respect to sharp and flat sounds, is not he, who has the art to know the sounds that are combined or not, a musician, but he who does not know, not a musician ?
Theæ.
It is so.
Guest.
And in other things of skill, and want of skill, we shall find other circumstances of such a kind.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
Since then we have acknowledged, that the genera (of things) have a mingling with each other, after the same manner, is it not necessary for him to proceed in his discourse with some science, who is about to show what kind of genera accord with what kind, and what do not receive each other ?
Likewise, whether these genera so hold together through all things as to be capable of being mutually mingled ?
And again in their divisions, whether there are other causes of division through wholes ?
Thecæ.
How is there not a need of science, and, perhaps, of nearly the greatest ?
Guest.
What then, Theætetus, shall we call this science ?
Or, by Jupiter, have we ignorantly fallen upon the science of freemen ?
And do we nearly appear, while searching after a sophist, to have found previously a philosopher ?[83.]
Thecæ.
How say you ?
Guest.
Shall we not say, that to divide according to genera, and neither to think the same species different, nor a different species the same, is the business of the dialectic science ?
Thecæ.
Yes, we will say so.
Guest.
He then who is able to do this, perceives sufficiently one idea every way extended through many things, of which each one lies apart, and many different from one another, ex­ ternally comprehended under one;
and on the other hand, one idea through many wholes conjoined in one, and.
many ideas, every way separated (from each other).
This is to know how to distinguish according to genus, in what point each can have a communion, and where they cannot.
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But you will not, I think, assign the dialectic art to any other than one, who philosophizes purely and justly.[84.]
Theæ.
For how should any one assign it to any other ?
Guest.
If we seek indeed, we shall find, both now and here­ after, a philosopher in a place of this kind, though difficult to see him clearly ;
but the difficulty in the.
case of a sophist and that of a philosopher is of a different kind.
Thece.
How so ?
Guest.
The one flying into the darkness of non-entity, and by rubbing touching it,12 is through the obscurity of the place hard to be perceived.
Is it not so ?
Theæ.
So it seems.
Guest.
But the philosopher, always lying, through reasoning, near the idea of entity, is, through the splendour of the region, by no means easily discerned.
For the eyes of the soul of the many are unable to endure the looking upon what is divine.
Theæ.
And this too it is likely is the case, no less than that.
Guest.
On this point, therefore, we shall shortly reflect more clearly, if it be permitted to us wishing it.
But with respect to the sophist, it is evident that we must not dismiss him, before we have sufficiently surveyed him.
Theo.
You speak well.[85.]
Guest.
Since then it is acknowledged by us, that some genera have a communion with each other, and some have not, and that nothing prevents some from having a communion with a few, others with many, and others through all and with all,-let us, in the next place, follow the reasoning, and in this way speculate, not about all species, lest we be con­ founded by their multitude,-but, selecting some of those called the greatest, let us first consider the qualities of each, and then what power of communion they possess with each other, in order that, although we may not be able to comprehend entity and non-entity with all clearness, we may at least not want for reasons respecting them, as far as the manner of the pre­ sent speculation admits, if perchance it be permitted us, when we assert that non-entity is in reality a non-entity, to escape unscathed.
Thecæ.
So must we do.[86.]
Guest.
Now the greatest of all the genera, which we have now mentioned, are, entity itself, standing, and motion.
Theæ.
Very much so.
Guest.
And we have said that the two (latter) are unmixed with each other.
Theæ.
Very much so.
Guest.
But entity is mixed with both;
for both do some­ how exist.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
These things then become three.
Theæ.
Certainly.
Guest.
Is not then each of these different from the other two, but the same with itself?
Theæ.
It is..
Guest.
What then have we now said of sameness and difference?
(Must we say that), as there are two genera different from the other three, but yet always mingled with them from necessity, we have to consider about five, and not three genera only ?
Or have we unconsciously denominated the same and the different, as something belonging to them ?13[87.]
Theæ.
Perhaps so.
Guest.
But surely motion and standing are neither the different nor the same ?
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
That which we in common call motion and stand­ ing can be neither of these.
Theæ.
Why?
Guest.
Because motion would be standing, and standing be motion.
For, with respect to both, either one becoming the other, would compel that other to change into the con­ trary to its nature, as participating in the contrary.
Theæ.
Very much so.
Guest.
But yet both participate of the same and the different.
Theæ.
They do.
Guest.
Let us then not assert that motion is either the same or the different, nor on the other hand (assert this), of standing.
Theæ.
Let us not.
Guest.
But must entity and the same be considered by us as one?
Theæ.
Perhaps so.
Guest.
But if entity and the same signify that which is in no respect different, when we again say that motion and standing both exist, we shall thus assert that they are the same, as things existing.
Theæ.
But this is surely impossible.
Guest.
It is impossible then for the same and entity to be one.
Theæ.
Nearly so.
Guest.
We must place then the same as a fourth species, in addition to the former three.
Theæ.
Entirely so. [88.]
Guest.
But must we say that the different is a fifth species ?
Or must we conceive that this and entity are some two names belonging to one genus ?
Theæ.
Perhaps so.
Guest.
But I think you will grant, that of existences, some always subsist themselves by themselves, but others in relation to each other.
14Theæ.
Why not ?
Guest.
But the different is always referred to the differ­ ent.
Is it not ?
Theæ.
It is.
Guest.
But this would not be, unless entity and the differ­ ent widely differed from each other.
But if the different participated of both species, as entity does, there would be something even of the different not different with reference to the different.
But now it happens from necessity that, whatever is really different, is so from its relation to that which is different.
ISTheæ.
You say, as the fact is.
Guest.
We must say then, that the nature of the different must be added as a fifth to the species, of which we have al­ ready spoken.
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
And we will say that it pervades through all these.
For each one is different from the others, not through its own nature, but through participating in the idea of the different.
Theæ.
And very much so.[89.]
Guest.
Let us say thus of the five genera, taking each singly.
Theæ.
How?
Guest.
In the first place, that motion is entirely different from standing.
Or how shall we say ?
Thes.
Thus.
Guest.
It is not then standing.
Theæ.
By no means.
Guest.
But it exists through its participating in entity.
Theæ.
It does.
Guest.
Again, motion is different from the same.
Theæ.
Nearly so.
Guest.
It is not therefore the same.
Theæ.
It is not.
Guest.
And yet it was the same, through its participating on the other hand in the same.
16Theæ.
And very much so.
Guest.
It must be confessed then that motion is both the same and not the same ;
nor must we be indignant at this.
For, when we say that it is both the same, and not the same, we do not speak of it in a similar manner;
but when (we say) 17 it is the same, we call it so, through the participation of the same with respect to itself;
but when (we say) it is not the same, (we call it so) through its communion with the different;
through which, being separated from the same, it becomes not the same, but the different;
so that it is again rightly said to be not the same.
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
If, then, motion itself18 has in any respect par­ ticipated in standing, there would be no absurdity in calling it stable.
Theæ.
Most truly, if we should acknowledge that some of the genera are willing to be mixed with each other, but others not.
Guest.
And yet we arrived at the proof of this prior to the present (remarks), by showing that it exists in this manner naturally.
Theæ.
How not ? [90.]
Guest.
Let us then say again (that) motion is a thing different from the different, just as it was from the same and standing.
Thece.
It must be so.
Guest.
It is then, in a certain respect, not different and different, according to the present reasoning.
Thece.
True.
Guest.
What then follows ?
Shall we say it is different from the three (genera), but not from the fourth ?
acknow­ ledging that there are five, about which, and in which, we propose to speculate ?
Thece.
And how so ?
for it is impossible to grant that the number is less than it now appears.
Guest.
We may, therefore, fearlessly contend that motion is different from entity.
Theæ.
We may most fearlessly.
Guest.
Clearly then motion is really a non-entity and an entity, since it participates of entity.
Theæ.
Most clearly.
Guest.
It is then of necessity that non-entity exists with respect to motion, and as regards all the genera.
For as regards all, the nature of the different, rendering them different from entity, makes each to be a non-entity.
Hence we rightly say, that all of them are, as regards the same, non-entities;
and again, because they participate in entity, that they exist and are entities.
19Thece.
It appears so.[91.]
Guest.
About each of the species then, the entity is many, but the non-entity is in multitude endless.
20Thece.
It appears so.
Guest.
Must not then entity itself be said to be different from the others ?
Theæ.
Of necessity.
Guest.
21 Entity then does not exist according to so many in number as the others;
for entity, being one itself, is not them ;
but the others, being infinite in number, are not entity.
21Theæ.
This is nearly the case.
Guest.
We ought not, then to be indignant at this, since the nature of the genera have a communion with each other.
But if some one does not admit this, let him, having per­ suaded 22 our former reasoning, in like manner persuade 22 the subsequent assertions.
Thecæ.
You speak most justly.
Guest.
Let us look at this likewise.
Theæ.
What ?
Guest.
When we say non-entity, we do not, as it appears, speak of any thing contrary to entity, but only as something different from it.
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
Just as when.
we say a thing is not great, do we then appear to you to point out by this word what is small rather than what is equal ?
Theæ.
How could you ?
Guest.
We must therefore admit that the contrary to a thing is not signified, when negation is spoken of;
but thus much only, that the (prohibitive) " not," and the (negative) " no," when prefixed, signify something relating to the words that follow, or rather to the things, respecting which are placed the words of the negation afterwards enunciated.
23Thecæ.
Entirely so.[92.]
Guest.
This also let us consider, if it seems good to you.
Theæ.
What is that ?
Guest.
The nature of the different appears to me to have been cut into fractional parts, in the same manner as science.
Theæ.
How?
Guest.
The (nature) is one;
but the portion of it that is attached to any thing does, when separated, possess individu­ ally its peculiar appellation;
on which account arts and sciences are said to be many.
Them.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Have not then the parts of the nature of the different, which is itself one thing, been affected in the very same way ?
Theæ.
Perhaps so.
But let us tell how this takes place.
Guest.
Is there any part of the different opposed to the beautiful ?
Theæ.
There is.
Guest.
Shall we say it is nameless, or that it has some appellation ?
Theæ.
That it has.
For that which we call on each occa­ sion not-beautiful, is not different from any thing else but the nature of the beautiful.
Guest.
Come, then, tell me this.[93.]
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
When any thing is separated from some kind of ex­ istences, and is again opposed to some kind of existences, does it happen that thus it is not beautiful ?24Theæ.
It does.
Guest.
But the opposition of entity to entity happens, as it seems, to be not-beautiful.
Theæ.
Most right.
Guest.
What then, according to this reasoning does the beautiful belong more to entities, and the non-beautiful, less ?
Theæ.
Not at all.
Guest.
We must say then, that the not-great and the great exist similarly.
Theæ.
Similarly.
Guest.
Hence too we must lay down respecting the just, in the same manner as of the not-just, that the one in no respect exists more than the other.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
And we will speak of other things in this way ;
since the nature of the different appears to be one of entities;
and as it exists, it is necessary for us to lay down the parts of it, as no less existing.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
The opposition then, it seems, of a part of the na­ ture of the different, and of entity25 opposed to each other,25 are no less existence, if it be lawful to say so, than existence itself;
nor do they signify what is contrary to existence, but only so much, what is different from it.
Theæ.
It is most clear.[94.]
Guest.
What then, shall we call it the (antithesis) ?
Theæ.
It is evident that non-entity, which we have been seeking on account of the sophist, is this very thing.
Guest.
Whether then, as you have said, is it no more de­ ficient of existence than the others ?
And ought we now boldly to say, that non-entity possesses its own nature firmly, in the same manner as the great was found to be great, and the beautiful beautiful, and the not-great to be (not-great),26 and the not-beautiful (not-beautiful) ?26 and that thus too non­ entity was and is non-entity, as being one species numbered amongst the many existing ?
Or must we still, Theætetus, have with regard to this some want of faith ?
Theæ.
None at all.
Guest.
Do you perceive then, how we have been with some prolixity disobedient to the prohibition of Parmenides ?
Theæ.
In what respect ?
Guest.
We have farther than he ordained 27 us to inquire, exhibited ourselves, still exploring onwards.
Them.
How?
Guest.
Because he says somewhere,—“ Non-beings never, and by no means are.
And from this path thy searching thought restrain.".
Thece.
And so he does say.
Guest.
But we have not only shown that non-entities exist, but we have demonstrated what kind of thing a non-entity is.
For, having proved that the nature of the different has an ex­ istence, and that it is cut up into fractions, (distributed) mutually through all things, we then dared to say, that each part of it, which is opposed to entity, is itself truly a non­ entity.
Thecæ.
And to me, 0 guest, we appear to have spoken with the greatest truth.[95.]
Guest.
Let no one then say, that we, having proved that non-entity is contrary to entity, dare to assert that it exists.
For we some time since did to something, contrary to it, bid a farewell, whether it exists or not, and possesses a certain reason, or is entirely irrational.
But, with respect to that which we now call non-entity, either let some one per­ suade (us) by showing that we speak not well;
or, as long as he is unable (to do this), he must also say, as we say, that the genera are mixed with each other, and that entity and the different pervading through all things, and through each other, the different, partaking of entity, does through this participation exist, not being that of which it participates, but something else;
and being different from entity, it clearly follows that it is necessarily non-entity.
And on the other hand entity, having partaken of the different, will be different from the other genera;
but being different from all of them, it is not any one of them, nor all the others, nor any thing besides itself.
So that incontestably entity is not ten thou­ sand things in ten thousand things:
and thus the rest taken singly and together exist in many forms, but do not exist in many forms.28[96.]
Thecæ.
True.
Guest.
Now if any one either does not believe in these contrarieties, let him reflect and produce something better than has been stated now;
29 or if, perceiving this to be a difficult speculation, he is pleased at drawing out his argu­ ments now on this side and now on that, he is engaged, as our present reasoning shows, in a pursuit not deserving very serious attention.
For this is neither a clever thing nor difficult to discover;
but that is at one and the same time difficult and honourable.
30Thecæ.
What?
Guest.
That which has been stated before ;
so that, omit­ ting these as possible, we may be able, by following up what has been said, each by itself, to confute a person, when he says that what is different is same, and what is the same different, 31 in the way and according to the circumstance by which he says either is affected.
31 For, to show that the same is different, and the different same, and the great small, and the similar dissimilar, and to be pleased in thus introducing con­ trarieties in discourse, is not a true confutation, but one evidently newly born of some one, who has recently laid hold of entities.
Thecæ.
Very much so.[97.]
Guest.
For, my good (friend), to endeavour to separate every thing from every thing, is inelegant in other respects, and the part too of one untaught and unphilosophical.
Theæ.
Why so ?
Guest.
To loosen each thing from all things, is the most perfect abolition of all discourse.
For discourse subsists through the conjunction of species with each other.
TheE.
True.
Guest.
Consider then, how opportunely we have now con­ tended with men of this kind, and compelled them to permit one thing to be mixed with another.
Theæ.
With a view to what ?
Guest.
To this, that discourse may be one certain thing belonging to the genera of existences.
For, if we are de­ prived of this, we shall, for the most part, be deprived of philosophy.
And further still, it is requisite at present that we agree about discourse what it is.
But if we take it away entirely from us, so as not to exist at all, we can no longer speak about any thing.
And we should take it away, if we admit that there is no mixing of any thing for any thing.[98.]
Theæ.
This is (said) quite rightly.
But I do not understand why we should agree about discourse.
Guest.
But, perhaps, you will most easily understand by following me in this way.
Theæ.
In what way ?
Guest.
Non-entity has appeared to us to be one of the rest of genera, and to be dispersed through all existences.
Theæ.
It has so.
Guest.
After this, therefore, we must consider whether it is mixed with opinion and discourse.
Theæ.
On what account ?
Guest.
Because, if it is not mixed with these, it must necessarily follow that all things are true;
but, if it is mixed with these, false opinion and (false)32 discourse is produced.
For to fancy or speak of non-entities, is a falsehood existing in the mind and in discourse.
TheB.
It is so.
Guest.
But, being falsehood, it is deception.
TheB.
It is.
Guest.
And deception existing, all things must necessarily be full of resemblances, images, and fancies.
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
But we have said that the sophist flew to (and stayed) in this place, while he denies that there is any such thing as falsehood ;
for (he says) that no one can either think or speak of a non-entity ;
because it in no respect partakes of existence.
Theæ.
It was (so) said.[99.]
Guest.
But now it has appeared to partake of entity;
so that in this respect perhaps he will no longer oppose us.
Perhaps, however, he will say, that of species some partake of non-entity, and others not;
and that discourse and opinion are amongst those things that do not partake of it.
So that he will again contend with us, that the image-making and fancy-producing art, in which we have said he is concealed, exists not at all;
since opinion and discourse have no com­ munion with non-entity ;
for that falsehood does not exist at all, if this communion of things takes place no where.
Hence we must search out discourse, opinion, and fancy, what they are, in order that we may perceive after their appearance their communion with non-entity;
and having perceived this, we may prove that falsehood exists ;
and having proved this, we may put the sophist into bonds, if he is guilty ;
or, setting him free, search for him in some other genus.[100.]
Theæ.
What was said, 0 guest, at first about the sophist, appears to be very true-that he is a genus difficult to hunt out.
For he appears to be full of fences ;
33 of which when he throws up one, it is necessary to take it by storm, before you can reach him himself.
And even now we have scarcely passed over the obstacle he had raised, that a non­ entity does not exist, when he immediately throws up another.
Hence it is requisite to show that falsehood does exist, both in discourse and opinion;
and after this perhaps something else, and another thing after that;
and, as it seems, no end will e'er appear.
34Guest.
He, Theætetus, should be bold, who is able to pro­ ceed, though only a little, continually onwards.
For what will he be able to do in other things who is faint-hearted in these, and is either effecting nothing in these, or is driven back again ?
Such a person will scarcely, according to the proverb, ever take a city.
But now, 0 good man, since this, as you say, has been passed through, the greatest wall will have been taken by us, and the rest will be more easy and of small account.
Theæ.
You say well.
Guest.
Let us then now in the first place take up, as we said, discourse and opinion, that we may more clearly cal- culate,35 whether non-being touches upon these, or whether both these are in every respect true, and neither of them at any time false.
Theæ.
Right.
Guest.
Come then, let us again speculate about nouns, in the same manner as we did about species and letters.
For the present inquiry appears36 somehow to lie in this road.
Theæ.
What then is to be heard forsooth about nouns ?
Guest.
Whether all of them fit together, or not;
or some are wont to do so, but others not.
Theæ.
This is evident, that some are wont and others not.
Guest.
Perhaps you mean some such thing as this;
that some being spoken in order and signifying something, do fit together ;
but that such as in continuity signify nothing, do not fit together.[102.]
Theæ.
Why, and how say you this ?
Guest.
What.
I thought you would understand and acknow­ ledge.
For there is a twofold kind of significations by the voice respecting existence.
Theæ.
How ?
Guest.
One called nouns, and the other verbs.
Theæ.
Speak of each.
Guest.
That which has a signification in the case of actions, is called a verb.
Theæ.
It is.
Guest.
But a sign of the voice, applied to the doers them­ selves of those actions, we call a noun.
Theæ.
Certainly.
Guest.
From nouns then alone, spoken in succession, there is not a discourse;
nor, on the other hand, from verbs spoken without nouns.
Theæ.
I have not learned this.
Guest.
Yet it is plain that you just now acknowledged " this, when looking to something else.
For this very thing I meant to say, that when these are spoken in succession, there is not a discourse.
Theæ.
How so ?
Guest.
As for instance, should any one say in succession "walks," "run?," "sleeps," and such other words as signify actions, he would not form a discourse at all.
Theæ.
For how could he ?[103.]
Guest.
Again then, when any one says, "lion," "stag," "horse," and such other nouns, as are named after those doing acts, no discourse is composed by such a con­ tinuity.
For the words spoken do not, 37 either in this way or that,37 signify action, or non-action, or the existence of a thing which is or is not, until one mixes verbs with nouns;
and then they fit (with each other), and a discourse is pro­ duced immediately, and their first connexion is nearly the first and shortest discourse.
Theæ.
How say you this ?
Guest.
When any one says, " Man learns," would you not say that this is the shortest and first discourse ?
Theæ.
I should.
Guest.
For he then points out something respecting things which exist, or are in the course of existing, or have been, or will be;
nor does he name a thing merely, but completes something by connecting verbs with nouns.
Hence we say that he speaks, and does not merely name a thing ;
and through this connexion we pronounce the noun "discourse."[104.]
Theæ.
Right.
Guest.
Thus too in the case of things, some did fit with each other, and others did not;
so likewise with respect to the signs of the voice, some do not fit, but others of them by fitting produce discourse.
Thecæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
There is still this trifling thing.
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
It is necessary for a discourse, when it takes place, to be a discourse about something;
for it is impossible to be about nothing.
Theæ.
It must.
Guest.
Ought it not then to be of some particular kind ?
Theæ.
How not ?
Guest.
Let us then pay attention to ourselves.
Thea.
For it is requisite.
Guest.
I will then pronounce you a discourse, having united a thing with an action, through a noun and a verb ;
and do you tell me of what it is the discourse.
Thea.
This shall be as far as I am able.
Guest.
Theætetus sits.-
This is not a long discourse.
Theæ.
No;
a moderate one.
Guest.
It is now your business to say about whom is the discourse, and whose it is.
Thea.
It is evident that it is about me and mine.
38Guest.
But what again is this ?
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
Theætetus, with whom I am now conversing, flies.
Theæ.
Respecting this also, no one can say but that it is mine,33 and of me.[105.]
Guest.
But we said it was necessary that every sentence should be of some particular kind.
Thea.
Yes.
Guest.
But of what kind must each of the sentences just now mentioned be ?
Thea.
One must be false and the other true.
Guest.
But of them the one which is true asserts things respecting you, as they are.
Thea.
How not ?
Guest.
But the one which is false (asserts) things respect­ in- you, different from what they are.
Thea.
It does.
Guest.
It speaks then of things which are not, as if they were.
Thea.
Nearly so.
Guest.
And it speaks of things about you different from the existing.
For we said that about each thing there are many things which exist, and many which do not.
Theæ.
Certainly.
Guest.
The discourse then which I last spoke about you, should, from what we have defined a discourse to be, of ne­ cessity be, in the first place, one of the shortest.
Theæ.
This we have just now acknowledged.
Guest.
In the next place, it is a discourse of some one.
Theæ.
It is so.
Guest.
But if it is not yours, it is not of any one else.
Theæ.
For how should it ?
Guest.
And if it is not about some thing, it cannot be a dis­ course at all.
For we have shown that it is (one) of things impossible, for a discourse to exist about nothing.
Theæ.
Most correctly.
Guest.
When therefore the different is asserted of you as if it were the same, and things not existing as if existing, such an arrangement of verbs and nouns altogether becomes, as it appears, a really and truly false discourse.
Theæ.
Most true.[106.]
Guest.
But what, is it not now evident, that all these genera, both false and true, such as thought, opinion, and fancy, are produced in our souls ?
Theæ.
How ?
Guest.
You will more easily understand it thus, if you first take,39 what each of them is, and in what they differ each from the other.
Thece.
Only give.
Guest.
Are not' then thought and discourse the same, ex­ cept that the former being within the soul a voiceless dialogue with itself, is called by us by the name of thought ?40Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But the stream of thought passing through the mouth with a sound is called discourse.
Theæ.
True.Guest.
We know of this too in discourse.
Theæ.
What?
Guest.
Affirmation and negation.
Theæ.
We do.
Guest.
When therefore this is generated in the soul accord­ ing to thought, accompanied with silence, can you call it any thing else than opinion ?
Theæ.
How can I ?Guest.
But when, again, some circumstance of this kind is present to any one, not according to itself,41 but through sens­ ation, is it possible to call it correctly any thing else than fancy ?
Theæ.
Nothing else.[107.]
Guest.
Since then discourse is both true and false, and it appears that thought is a dialogue of the soul with it­ self, but opinion the termination of thought, and what we mean by " it appears " is the mixture of sensation and opinion, it is necessary, that of these, being allied to discourse, some should be false and sometimes.
42Theæ.
How not?
Guest.
Do you perceive then, that opinion and discourse have been previously found to be false more easily, than according to our expectation ?
For 43 just now we were afraid, lest by searching into this matter we should throw ourselves upon a work perfectly impracticable.
Theæ.
I do perceive.
Guest.
Let us not then be faint-hearted as to what remains.
For since these have been made to appear, let us recall to our memory the previous divisions according to species.
Thece.
Of what kind were they ?
Guest.
We divided image-making into two species;
the one assimilative, and the other fanciful.
Theæ.
We did.
Guest.
And we said we were dubious in which of these we should place the sophist.
Thes.
It was so (said).
Guest.
And while we were doubting of this, a still greater dizziness was shed around us, through the assertion appearing a matter of doubt to all men, that there cannot be at all either a resemblance, or an image, or fancy;
because no falsehood exists by any means at any time or in any place.
Theæ.
You speak the truth.[108.]
Guest.
But now since discourse has made its ap­ pearance, and false opinion likewise, it is conceded that there are imitations of things existing;
and that from this disposi­ tion of things the art of deceiving is produced.
Theæ.
It is agreed.
Guest.
And yet was it not also acknowledged by us above, that the sophist is one of these ?
Theæ.
It was.
Guest.
Let us then again endeavour, by always bisecting the proposed genus, to proceed along the right hand44 of the section, and attend to its communion with the sophist, until, having cut off all his common properties, we leave the nature peculiar to himself, and exhibit it to ourselves especially, and afterwards to those also, who are naturally the nearest of kin to this method.
Theæ.
Right.[109.]
Guest.
Did we not then begin by dividing the making art and the acquiring art ?
Theæ.
Yes.
Guest.
And the acquiring art presented itself to us in hunting, contests, traffic, and in some such-like species.
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But now, since the imitative art comprehends the sophist, it is evident that the making art must first receive a twofold division.
For imitation is a certain kind of making.
We said, indeed, it was the making of images, and not of each themselves.45
Did we not ?
Theæ.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But, in the first place, let there be two parts of the making art.
Theæ.
What are they ?
Guest.
One divine, the other human.
Theæ.
I do not understand you.
Guest.
The making art, if we remember what was said at' first, we asserted to be every power, which might be the cause of things being produced subsequently, that did not previously exist.
Theæ.
We do remember.[110.]
Guest.
But, with respect to all living animals, and plants, which are produced in the earth from seeds and roots, together with such inanimate bodies as subsist on the earth, able to be liquefied or not, can we say that not existing pre­ viously they were subsequently produced by any other than some fabricating god?
Or making use of the opinion and assertion of the many—46Theæ.
What is that ?
Guest.
That nature generates these from some self-acting fortuitous cause, and without a generating intellect;
or (is it) with reason and divine science, originating from a god ?
Theæ.
I, perhaps, through my age, am often changing my opinions to both sides.
But at present looking to you, and apprehending that you think these things are produced accord­ ing to (the will of) a deity, I think so too.
Guest.
It is well, Theætetus.
And if we thought that you would be one of those, who at a future time would think dif­ ferently, we should now endeavour to make you acknowledge this by the force of reason, in conjunction with the persuasion of necessity.
But since I know your nature to be such, that, without any arguments from us, it will of itself arrive at that conclusion to which you say you are now drawn, I will leave the subject;
for the time47 would be superfluous.
But I will lay this down, that the things, which are said to be made by nature, are (made) by divine art;
but that the things, which are composed from these by men, are produced by human (art):
and that, according to this assertion, there are two kinds of the making art, one human, and the other divine.
Thecæ.
Right.[111.]
Guest.
But, since there are two kinds, bisect each of them.
Theæ.
How?
Guest.
Just as the whole of the making art was then divided, according to breadth, so now divide it according to length.
Theæ.
Let it be so divided.
Guest.
And thus all its parts will become four;
two of which, with reference to us, will be human ;
and two again, with reference to the gods, divine.
Thecæ.
They will.
Guest.
But with respect to these, as being again divided in a different manner, one part of each division is self-making, but the remaining parts may be nearly called image-making;
and in this way again, the making art is divided into two parts.
Theæ.
Tell me again how each is (to be divided).
Guest.
With respect to ourselves and other animals, and the things from which they naturally consist, fire and water, and the sisters of these, we know that all these productions are individually the offspring of a deity.
Or how ?
Theæ.
Thus.
Guest.
And that the images of each of these, and not the things themselves, follow, and these too produced by the artifice of some dæmon-like power.
Theæ.
Of what kind are these ?
Guest.
Fancies, which occur in dreams, and such as ap­ pear in the day, are called self-produced;
(as, for instance,) a shadow, 48when darkness is generated in fire:
48 but this is 49 twofold, when its own and foreign light meeting in one about shining and smooth bodies, effects by these means a species,49 producing a sensation of seeing contrary to accus­ tomed vision.
Theæ.
These works then of divine making are two, the things themselves, and the image which follows each.[112.].
Guest.
But what of our art?
Shall we not say that it does, by the art of house-building, make a dwelling, and has made by painting another (dwelling), which is, as it were, a dream made by man to persons awake ?
Thecæ.
Entirely so.Guest. 50 In this way then are the rest.
(Divided) into two parts are the works of our making power;
that which relates to the thing itself we call thing-itself-making, but that which relates to the image, image-making.
50Theæ.
I now understand you better;
and I lay down in two parts two kinds of the making art, the divine and human, according to one section;
and, according to the other, 51 one (a production) from themselves, and the other of certain re­ semblances.
51Guest.
Let us then recollect, that of the image-pro­ ducing art we said, one kind was about to be a likeness-pro­ ducing, and the other a fancy-producing, if it should appear that falsehood is in reality a falsehood, and one of things existing.
Thece.
It was so.
Guest.
There have then appeared, and we shall on this account enumerate ourselves,52 incontestably two species.
Thecæ.
Yes.[113.]
Guest.
Let us then again divide into two the fancy-producing species.
Thecæ.
In what way?;
Guest.
One produced through instruments, but 53the other, when he, who causes the fancied appearance, exhibits himself as the instrument of the thing.
53Thecæ.
How say you ?
Guest.
I think, when any one employing his own body, causes your figure to appear similar to (his own),54 or voice to voice, this is especially called an imitation belonging to the fancy-producing species.
Thecæ.
It is.
Guest.
Calling this then imitative, we will divide it;
but let us, now reduced to a jelly,55 dismiss all the rest, and we will permit some other person to collect (the facts) into one, and to give them a proper appellation.
Theæ.
Let one then be divided, and the other dismissed.
Guest.
And yet, Theætetus, it is fit to think that this also is twofold;
but take notice on what account.
Theæ.
Say on.
Guest.
Of those who imitate, some knowing what they imitate, do this, but others not knowing.
And yet what di­ vision can we make greater than that of ignorance and know­ ledge ?
Theæ.
Not one.
Guest.
Will not then that, which was just now mentioned, be an imitation by those, that are endued with knowledge ?
For a man by knowing you, would imitate your figure like­ wise.
Theæ.
How not ?[114.]
Guest.
But what shall we say respecting the figure of j ustice, and, in short, of the whole of virtue ? 56 Do not many, though ignorant, yet fancying they know it, vehemently en­ deavour to make it appear that, what seems to be (justice in them), is inherent in them, and that they are particularly de­ sirous of it, by imitating it in deeds and words.
56Thecæ.
Very many indeed.
Guest.
Do not then all fail in seeming to be just, by their not being just at all ?
Or does the contrary of this take place wholly ?
Thece.
Wholly.
Guest.
I think then we must say that the imitator, who is ignorant, is different from the other who knows.
Thece.
Yes.
Guest.
Whence, then, can any one of them obtain a name adapted to each ?
Or is it evident that it is difficult;
because a certain ancient cause of the division of genera into species was unknown 57 to our ancestors, so that none of them at­ tempted even to divide;
and on this account there was a ne­ cessity for them not to be very ready at names.
But at the same time, although it may be rather bold to be asserted, for the sake of distinction, let us call the imitation which subsists with opinion, the “opinion-mimicking," but that which sub­ sists in conjunction with science, a certain scientific58 imi­ tation.
Theæ.
Be it so.[115.]
Guest.
We must therefore make use of the other:
for a sophist was not among the scientific but the imitators.
Theæ.
And very much so.
Guest.
Let us then look into this opinion-mimic, as if he were a piece of iron, and (see) whether he is sound and whole, or contains in himself some layer doubled over.
Thecæ.
Let us consider.
Guest.
He has it indeed very thick.
For, of sophists, one is a simpleton, and thinks he knows what he (merely) fancies.
But the figure of another, through his tossing about in his discourse, carries with it much of suspicion and fear, that he is ignorant of what before others he pretends to know.
Theæ.
There are both these kinds of sophists, of whom you have spoken.
Guest.
We will therefore place one as a simple imitator, but the other as an ironical one.
Theæ.
It is proper (to do so).
Guest.
And again, shall we say that the genus of this is one or two ?
Theæ.
Do you look to it.
Guest.
I do consider;
and some two imitators appear before me.
One I behold able to employ irony in public, and in lengthened speeches before the masses;
but the other in private, and in short discourses, compelling the person who converses with him to contradict himself.
Theæ.
You speak most correctly.[116.]
Guest.
What then may we show the imitator to be, who employs lengthened discourses ?
A statesman, or a mob- orator ?
Theœ.
A mob-orator.Guest.
But what shall we call the other ?
a wise man, or wiseman-like?
Theœ.
To (call)59 him a wise man is impossible, since we ' have placed him as one who is ignorant;
but as he is an imitator of a wise man, it is plain lie must receive some similar appellation;
and I now nearly understand, that we ought truly to call this person the perfectly real sophist.
Guest.
Shall we not then bind together his name, as we did before, connecting (every thing)60 from the end to the be­ ginning?
Theœ.
Entirely so.Guest. 61 He, then, who is a portion of the art that makes a discourse to contradict itself, (and) a part of the ironic species, and of the opinion-mimicking, (and) of the fancy-pro­ ducing, (and) of that (proceeding) from the image-making, (and) separated from the making, not as a god but man, (and) in discourses is the wonder-working portion,61 whoever shall say that he is "of this race and blood"62 a real sophist, such a person will, as it appears, speak with the greatest truth.
Theœ.
Entirely so.OF this dialogue, which is feigned to have taken place on the same day as the Sophist, and may be considered both in manner and matter a continuation of it, although directed to a different subject, the argument may be comprised in a very few words.
Its object, as stated towards the close of it, is to show that the head of the state, who should be a king, ought to combine not only in his own person, but in that of the people over whom he rules, the two con­ flicting characters of manliness and moderation.
For by such an union alone is it possible to correct the mischiefs arising equally from the excess and deficiency of energy in all matters relating to the well-being of the state.
To arrive at this conclusion Plato has thought proper to give the rein to his imagination instead of curbing it;
and he has been com­ pelled in consequence to apologize for the prolixity of his discourse ;
where he was evidently carried away with the same desire to draw subtle distinctions in things apparently similar, as he has done in the Sophist.
For he was anxious, perhaps, to show his acquaintance with the minutiæ of some handicraft trades, instead of keeping rather the attention of the reader fixed to a few leading points, and putting down only Quod bene proposito conducat et hæreat apte.
What to the subject's fitted and sticks close.
In the midst, however, of this discursive matter, we meet with a curious digression, where Plato has in part anticipated the theory of the Geologists of the present day, respecting the changes which the earth has undergone at different periods, together with an allusion to a primæval state, not very unlike that recorded in Holy Writ;
although in neither case did he probably do more than put into his own words, what lie found in the writings of preceding philosophers.
This dialogue is remarkable, moreover, for the development of the notion, so contrary to that of modern times, that laws should be made not so much to chime in with the feelings of the people, as to oppose their prejudices, provided the object of such legislation be to improve their moral and physical condition.
But as this end could not be accomplished, where the ruling power rests with the masses, who, as Plato had seen at Athens, were alternately ferocious despots or fawning slaves, he suggested the propriety 0f establish­ ing in conjunction with a king, an aristocracy, composed of persons, not superior to their countrymen in wealth, but in virtue, and pos­ sessing, like the king, the qualities necessary for a real statesman;
who should be at once a shepherd, to look to the rearing of his charge, and a physician, to watch over their health, and a philoso­ pher, to superintend their mental and moral culture.
As this dialogue has been edited separately only by Stalbaum— for Fischer's publication is, like the rest of that scholars works, be­ neath even a passing notice-it presents not a few passages to exercise, and, as I have found, to baffle the ingenuity of emendatorv criticism;
to which Stalbaum should have resorted rather than have sought to support the nonsense of a corrupt text.
As regards, how­ ever, the matter of the dialogue, he has left little to desire in his Prolegomena of 132 8vo pages;
to which the reader is referred, who wishes to know something of what has been written by the more recent scholars of Germany on questions, that will, it is to be feared, remain for ever in their present obscurity.[1.]
I OWE you, Theodorus, surely many thanks for my acquaintance with Theætetus and this guest to boot.
The.
Perhaps,
Socrates, you will owe me thrice as many, when they shall have worked out for you a statesman and a philosopher.
Soc.
Be it so.
But shall we say we have thus heard this from you, the most powerful in calculations and geometry ?
The.
How, Socrates?
Soc.
As having put down each of these men of equal worth, who are in value more removed from each other than" accords with the analogy of your art.
The.
By our god Ammon,' Socrates, you have well and justly, and very rememberingly2 reproved me for my error in calculation.
But I will follow you up about this at a future time.
But do not you, 0 guest, in any respect be faint- hearted in gratifying us;
but select for us either first a statesman, or a philosopher;
and having selected go through (the discussion).
Guest.
This must be done, Theodorus ;
for since we have put our hand to this discussion, we must not stand aloof, till we arrive at the end of it.
But what must I do with Theæte­ tus here?
The.
As regards what ?
Guest.
Shall we suffer him to rest, and take in his stead Socrates here, his fellow-combatant ?
Or how do you advise?
The.
Take him, as you say, in his stead.
For, both being young men, they will after resting easily endure every labour.
Soc.
And indeed, 0 guest, both of them appear almost to have an affinity with me from some quarter.
For you say that one of them (Theætetus) seems to resemble me in the natural form of his face;
4 and the appellation of the other, being of the same name as myself, and his address5 furnish a kind of family connexion.
It is meet then for us to recognise always with readiness in conversation those of the same kin.
Now yesterday I mingled in a conversation with Theætetus,6 and I have now heard him answering ;
but neither (case applies) to Socrates (here).
It is meet, however, for us to con­ sider him likewise.
Let him then at some other time answer me, but at present you.
Guest.
Be it so.
Do you, Socrates (junior), hear this So­ crates ?
'Soc.jun.
I do.
Guest.
Do you then agree to what he says ?
Soc. jun.
Entirely.
Guest.
It appears then, that your affairs will not be an hinderance ;
and perhaps it is requisite for me to be much less .an hinderance.
But after the sophist7 it is necessary, as it appears to me, for us to seek out the statesman. [2.]
Tell me then, whether must we place this (character) too among the possessors of knowledge, or how ?
Soc. jun.
In this way.
8Guest.
We must then divide the sciences, as (we did) when we were inquiring into the former (character).
Soc. jun.
Perhaps so.
Guest.
But yet the division appears to me, Socrates, to be not after the same manner.
Soc. jun.
Why not?
Guest.
But after another.
Soc. jun.
It would seem so.
Guest.
Where then can one find the statesman's path ?
For find it we must;
and separating it from the rest, put on it the seal of one (general) form, and on the other deflections the mark of another species;
and thus cause our soul to conceive that all the sciences do in reality belong to two species.
Soc.jun.
I think, 0 guest, that this is your business, and not mine.
Guest.
But indeed, Socrates, it must needs be yours too, when it becomes apparent to us.
Soc. jun.
You speak well.
Guest.
Are not then arithmetic, and certain other sciences allied to this, divested of action;
and do they not afford a subject of thought alone ?
Soc. jun.
It is so.
Guest.
But those which pertain to carpenter's work, and the whole of handicraft trades, possess a science, as it were, innate in their operations, and at the same time complete the bodies produced by them, which had not an existence previ­ ously.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
In this manner then divide sciences in general, calling one practical and the other merely intellectual.
Soc. jun.
Let there be then of one whole science two species.
Guest.
Whether then shall we lay down the statesman, the king, the despot, and the head of a household, and call them all by one name ?
Or shall we say there are as many sciences as have been their mentioned names ?
Or rather follow me hither.
Soc. jun.
Whither ?

On this road.
If a private person is able to give advice sufficiently well to any of the public physicians,9 is it not necessary for him to be called by the name of the art, the same as he is, to whom he gives advice.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
What then, whatever private person is skilled in giving advice to the king of a country, shall we not say that he.
possesses the science, which the ruler himself ought to possess ?
Soc. jun.
We shall.
Guest.
But surely the science of a true king is a kingly (science).
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
And may not he, who possesses this science, whether he is a private man, or a king, be in every respect rightly called, according to this art, king-like.
Soc.jun.
Justly so.
Guest.
And are not the head of a household and a despot the same ?
Soc. jun.
How not?
Guest.
But what, will the size of an extensive household or the swollen form10 of a small state make any difference as regards the government ?
Soc. jun.
Not at all.
Guest.
It is evident then, what is indeed the thing we were just now inquiring, that there is one science respecting all these.
But whether any one calls it the science of a king, a statesman, or a family-man, let us not differ about it.
Soc. jun.
Why should we?[3.]
Guest.
This too is evident, that each individual11 king has in his hands, and the whole of his body, some little power towards retaining his rule, as compared with the intelligence and strength of his soul.
Soc. jun.
It is evident.
Guest.
Are you willing then for us to say that a king is more allied to intellectual than to manual and wholly practical science ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
We will then put together in the same (class) statesmanship and a statesman, kingship and a king, as being all one thing.
Soc. jun.
It is evident.
Guest.
Shall we not proceed then in an orderly manner, if after this we divide the intellectual science ?Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Attend, then, and inform me whether we can per­ ceive any point of union ?12Soc. jun.
Tell me of what kind.
Guest.
Of this kind.
We have a certain calculating art.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
And this I think entirely belongs to the intellectual arts.
Soc.jun.
How not?
Guest.
Shall we concede to the calculating art, that knows the difference in numbers, any thing more than that it dis­ tinguishes things, the subjects of intellect.
Soc. jun.
How should we ?
Guest.
For every architect is not a workman himself, but is the ruler over workmen.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
And he imparts indeed intellect, but not the work by hand.
Soc.jun.
Just so.
Guest.
He may justly then be said to have a share in in­ tellectual science.
Soc.jun. Entirely.
Guest.
And for him I think it is fitting, after he has passed a judgment, not to have an end, nor to be freed, as the calculator was freed (from doing more), but to command every workman (to do) that which is suited to him, until they shall have worked out what has been commanded.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
Are not then all such as these, and such as are con­ sequent upon the calculating art, intellectual?
And do not these two genera differ from each other in judgment and com­ mandment ?
Soc. jun.
They appear to do so.
Guest.
If then we should divide the whole of the intel­ lectual science into two parts, and call the one mandatory, and the other judicial, should we not say that we have made a careful division ?Soc.jun.
Yes, according to my mind.
Guest.
But for those, who do any thing in common, it is delightful to be of one mind.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
As far then as we participate 13 on this point, we must bid farewell to the opinions of others.[4.]
Soc. jun.
Why not ?
Guest.
Come, then, inform me in which of these arts we must place the kingly character.
Must we place him in the judicial art, as some spectator?
Or rather, shall we place him in the commanding art, as being a despot ?
Soc. jun.
How not rather in this ?
Guest.
We may consider again the commanding art, whether it stands in any way apart.
For it appears to me, that as the art of a huckster is separated from his, who sells his own goods,14 so is the genus of a king from the genus of public criers.
Soc. jun.
How so ?
Guest.
Hucksters, having received the previously sold works of others, afterwards sell them again themselves.
Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
The tribe of criers too, after receiving the thoughts of strangers, enjoins them again to others.
Soc. jun.
Most true.
Guest.
What then, shall we mix in the same (class) the king-art, and that of the interpreting, ordering, prophesying, and public-crying, and many other arts allied to these, all which have this in common that they command ?
Or are you willing that, as we just now instituted a resemblance (in things), we should make a resemblance in the name likewise ?
since the genus of those, who rule their own concerns, is nearly without a name;
and shall we so divide these, by placing the kingly genus among those, who command their own concerns, and by neglecting every thing else, leave any one to put another name on them?
For our method was (adopted) for the sake of a ruler, and not for its contrary.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.[5.]
Guest.
Since then this stands at a moderate distance apart from those, and is separated from that, which is foreign, into that which is domestic, it is necessary to divide this again, if we have yet any yielding15 section in this.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
And, indeed, it appears that we have.
But follow me and divide.
Soc. jun.
Whither?
Guest.
Shall we not find that all such as we conceive to be rulers, do, by making use of a command, give a command for the sake of producing something ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
And indeed it is not at all difficult for all things that are produced, to receive a twofold division.
Soc. jun.
In what way?
Guest.
Some among all of them are animated, and others are inanimate.
Soc. jun.
They are so.
Guest.
If we wish to cut the portion of intelligence, that has a commanding power over these very things, we will cut it.
Soc. jun.
According to what?
Guest.
By assigning one part over the generation of inani­ mate things, and the other over the generation of animated.
And thus the whole will be divided into two parts.
Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
One part then let us put aside, and take up again the other;
and after taking it up, divide the whole into two parts.
Soc. jun.
But which of these do you say is to be resumed ?
Guest.
By all means, that which has a command over ani­ mals.
For it is not the province of the kingly science to have a command over things inanimate, like the science of archi­ tecture ;
but, being of a more noble nature, over animals;
and it ever possesses a power relating to such very things.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
(With respect to) the generation and nurture of animals, a person may see the former as single-feeding, but the latter as the common-feeding of the nurslings in herds.
17Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
But we shall find that the statesman is not a breeder of his own property, like an ox-driver, or some horse-currier;
18 but is rather like the person who rears horses and oxen.
Soc.jun.
What has been just said seems to be the fact.
Guest.
Whether then (with respect to) the nurture of ani­ mals, shall we call the common-rearing of all together a herd- rearing, or a certain general-rearing.
Soc. jun.
Whichever may happen in the discourse.[6.]
Guest.
You (have said) well, Socrates.
And if you avoid paying too serious an attention to names, you will ap­ pear in old age to be more rich in prudence.
But now we must do as you recommended.
But do you understand how some one will, having divided the herd-rearing art into two, cause, what is now sought for in a double, to be sought for then in halves?
19Soc.jun. I shall be eager (to do so):
and it appears to me that there is one rearing of men, and another of beasts.
Guest.
You have divided in every respect most readily and courageously.
However, (we must be careful) to the utmost of our power not to suffer hereafter this.
Soc.jun.
What?
Guest.
That we do not take away one small part as appli­ cable to many and great parts, nor yet without a species;
but let it always have at the same time a species.
For it is very well to separate immediately the thing sought for from all the rest, if the separation be rightly made;
just as you did a little before, through conceiving the division to be rightly made, hasten on, seeing that the discourse was tending to man.
But, my friend, it is not safe to divide with subtlety;
20 but it is more safe to proceed in the middle21 by dividing (con­ tinually) ;
for thus will one more (readily)22 meet with forms (of existence).
But the whole of this relates23 to our in­ quiries.
Soc. jun.
How say you this, 0 guest?
Guest.
I must endeavour to speak yet more clearly, through a kind feeling towards your disposition,24 Socrates.
But it is impossible in the subject at hand to show what is now said in a manner wanting in nothing;
still we must endea­ vour, for the sake of perspicuity, to carry on the inquiry a little further.
Soc.jun.
In what respect then do you say we have, by dividing, just now not rightly done ?
Guest.
In this respect;
that, should any one attempt to give a twofold division to the human genus, he would divide, in the way that the majority here divide.
For by separating the Grecian genus, as one apart from all, they give to all the rest, who are innumerable, unmixt, and not speaking the same language with each other, one name, that of a Bar­ barian race;
and through this one name they fancy the race itself to be one;
or as if some one, thinking that number should be divided into two species, should, after cutting off ten thousand from all numbers, put it aside as one species, and, giving one name to all the rest, should think that, through that appellation, this genus will become separate and different from the other.
He however would make in a more beautiful manner, and more according to species, and a two-fold division, who should divide number into even and odd, and the human species into male and female;
and, after arranging the Lydians or Phrygians, or some other nations, should then separate them into wholes, when he is incapable of finding the genus, and at the same time the species of each of the divided portions.[7.]
Soc.jun.
Most right.
But (explain),26 0 guest, this very thing-How can any one rather clearly know that genus and species are not the same, but different from each other ?
Guest.
0 Socrates, thou best of men, thou commandest no trifling thing.
Already have we wandered further from our proposed discourse than is fitting;
and yet you order us to wander still further.
Now then let us, as is reasonable, turn back again;
and hereafter we will at leisure pursue this point, as having come upon the track.
Do not, however, by any means guard against this,27 that you have heard from me this point clearly determined.
Soc. jun.
What?
Guest.
That species and part are different from each other.
Soc. jun.
Why (say you) so ?
Guest.
When any thing is a species of some thing, it is necessary for it to be a part of the thing of which it is said to be the species:
but there is no necessity for a part to be a species.
Always consider me, therefore, Socrates, as assert­ ing this rather than that.
Soc. jun.
Be it so.
Guest.
But tell me that, which is after this.
Soc. jun.
What ?
Guest.
The point of the digression which has brought us hither.
For I think it was especially at that point, when, on your being asked how we must divide herd-rearing, you an­ swered very readily, that there were two kinds of animals, the one of man, and the other of brutes taken all together.
Soc. jun.
True.
Guest.
And you then appeared to me, after taking away a part, to think that you ought to leave28 the remainder as one genus of all (brutes), because you could give to them all the same name, by calling them brutes.
Soc.jun.
Such was the case.
Guest.
But this, 0 most courageous of men, is just as if some other prudent29 animal, such as seems to be the crane, or some other animal of a similar kind, should, in the same manner as you do, oppose the cranes, as one race, to all other animals, and make itself an object of respect;
and, putting all the rest together with men into one race, call them perhaps nothing else but brutes.
Let us then endeavour to avoid every thing whatsoever of this kind.
Soc. jun.
How?
Guest.
By not dividing every genus of animals, that we may suffer the less.
Soc.jun.
For there is no necessity.
Guest.
For we then erred in this way.
Soc.jun.
In what?
Guest.
Such part of intellectual science as related to com­ manding was (said) by us to be of the animal-rearing kind, as regards gregarious animals.
Was it not ?
Guest.
The whole animal genus, therefore, was even then divided into the tame and wild.
For those animals that have a nature to become gentle, are called tame;
but those that have not, are (called) wild.
Soc. jun.
Correctly.
Guest.
But the science, of which we are in the hunt, was and is in the case of tame animals, and is to be sought for among the gregarious rearlings.
Soc.jun.
Yes.
Guest.
Let us then not divide, as formerly, looking to all animals, nor with haste, so that we may quickly arrive at state-science.
For this has caused us to suffer even now according to the proverb—30Soc.
jun.
What?
Guest.
By not well dividing31 quietly, to complete (the task) more slowly.
Soc. jun.
And it has, 0 guest, properly caused (us to suffer).[8.]
Guest.
Be it so then.
But let us again from the beginning endeavour to divide the common-rearing (of ani­ mals).
For perhaps the discourse itself, being brought to a conclusion, will more clearly unfold what you desire.
But tell me-Soc.jun.
What?
Guest.
This;
if indeed you have frequently32 heard it from certain persons.
For I do not think you have met with the tame-fish places in the Nile, or in the royal lakes.
But perhaps you have seen the taming of these in (artificial) fountains.
Soc. jun.
I have seen these frequently, and I have heard of those from many.
Guest.
You have likewise heard and believe that geese and cranes are reared, though you have never wandered about the Thessalian plains.
Soc. jun.
How not?
Guest.
On this account I have asked you all these ques­ tions, because the rearing of herds of animals is partly of those moving33 in the water, and partly on dry land.
Soc. jun.
It is so.
Guest.
Does it not then.
appear to you likewise, that we ought to cut in two.
the common-rearing science, [distributing to each of them its own part,34] and call the one a rearing-in­ moisture, and the other a rearing-on-dry-land.Soc.jun.
(It does so appear) to me.
Guest.
But we will not in the same manner inquire to which of these arts king-science belongs.
For it is evident to every one.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
And every one can separate the dry-rearing portion of the herd-rearing.
Soc. jun.
How?
Guest.
Into the flying and walking-on-foot.
Soc. jun.
Most true.
Guest.
But what of state-science, must it be inquired whe­ ther it relates to the walking-on-foot ?
Or do you not think, that the most stupid person, so to say, would imagine so ?
Soc. jun.
I do.
Guest.
But it is requisite to show that the art of rearing foot-walking (animals) is, as number was just now, cut into two parts.
Soc.jun.
This is evident.
Guest.
And yet to the part, to which our discourse has led us on, there seem to be some two paths extending themselves ;
the one quicker, by being divided, a small part as compared with a large one ;
but the other longer, from preserving rather the precept, which we mentioned before, that we ought to cut as much as possible through the middle.
It is in our power then to proceed by either of the paths we may wish.
Soc. jun.
Is it then impossible to proceed by both ?
Guest.
What by both at once, 0 wonderful youth ?
Al­ ternately, however, it is plain the thing is possible.
Soc.jun.
I choose then both alternately.
Guest.
The thing is easy;
since short is the remainder (of the road).
In the beginning indeed and middle of our journey the command35 would have been difficult.
But now, since this seems good, let us first proceed by the longer road.
For, as we are fresh, we shall more easily journey through it.
But do you look to the division.[9.]
Soc.jun. Speak it.
Guest.
Of such tame animals as are gregarious, the foot- walking have been divided by us according to nature.
Soc. jun.
What (nature)?
Guest.
By some of their race being hornless and others homed.
Soc.jun.
So it appears.
Guest.
Divide then the art of rearing foot-walking animals, and assign to each part,36 making use of reason.
For should you wish to name them, the thing will become complicated more than is fitting.
Soc. jun.
How then must one speak (of them) ?
Guest.
Thus.
Of the science of rearing foot-walking animals, divided into two parts, let one portion be as­ signed to the horned part of the herd, but the other to the hornless.
Soc. jun.
Let this be so said:
for they have been suffi­ ciently shown to be so.
Guest.
Now then the king is evidently the shepherd over a flock of animals deprived of horns.
Soc. jun.
For how is he not evident?
Guest.
Breaking then this (herd) into portions, let pis en­ deavour to assign the result37 to him (the king).
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Whether then are you willing for us to divide it (the herd) by the cloven, or, what is called, the solid hoof?
Or by a common or individual generation ?
For you understand.
Soc.jun.
What?
Guest.
That the race of horses and asses naturally pro­ create with each other.
Soc. jun.
It does.
Guest.
But the other still remaining portion of the smooths 38-haired herd of tame animals, is unmixed in their generation with each other.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
But whether does the Statesman appear to take care of animals having a common, or individual generation ?
Soc. jun.
It is evident of the unmixed (generation).
Guest.
We must then, as it seems, divide this, as those be­ fore, into two parts.
Soc. jun.
Yes;
we must.
Guest.
But we have cut into minute portions nearly every tame and gregarious animal, except two genera.
For it is not fit to rank the genus of dogs39 among gregarious cattle.
Soc.jun.
It is not.
But in what manner shall we divide these two ?
Guest.
In that, by which it is just for you and Theætetus to divide them, since you are handling the science of geometry.
Soc. jun.
In what manner ?
Guest.
By the diameter, and again by the diameter of the diameter.
40Soc. jun.
How say you ?
Guest.
Is the nature, which the race of us men possesses, adapted to locomotion in any other way than as a diameter, which is two feet in power?
40Soc. jun.
In no other way.
Guest.
Moreover the nature of the remaining genus is again according to the power of our power, a diameter, if it naturally consists of twice two feet.
Soc. jun.
Undoubtedly.
And now I nearly understand what you wish to show.
Guest.
But in addition to these, do we perceive, Socrates, something else belonging to those having a reputation for laughter,41 which happened to us in making the former division ?
Soc. jun.
What is that ?
Guest.
This our human race, sharing the same lot and run­ ning the same course with a race the most generous42 and most handy of existing (animals).
Soc. jun.
I perceive it happening very absurdly too.
43Guest.
Is it not fit that the slowest things should arrive last of all ?44Soc. jun.
It is.
Guest.
But we do not perceive this, that a king appears still more ridiculous, when running together with the herd, 45and performing his course in conjunction with him, who is exercised in the best manner with respect to a tractable life.
45Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
For now, Socrates, that is more apparent, which was said by us in our search for a sophist.46Soc.jun.
What is that?
Guest.
That in such a method of discourse there is no greater care for what is venerable, than what is not, nor does it prefer the small to the great, but always accomplishes that which according to itself is most true.
Soc.jun.
It appears so.
Guest.
After this, that you may not anticipate me by ask­ ing what is the shorter road to the definition of a king, shall I traverse it the first ?
Soc. jun.
By all means.
Guest.
I say then, that we ought to have divided forthwith the foot-walking genus into the biped and quadruped;
and, seeing that the human race shared the same lot with the flying genus alone, we ought to have again divided the two- footed into the wingless and winged;
and this division having been made, and the art shown, which is the rearer of men, we ought to have brought forward and placed over it the statesman and kingly character, like a charioteer, and given him the reins of the city,47 in consequence of this science being peculiarly his own.
Soc.jun.
You have (spoken) beautifully, and given me an account, as it were, of a debt,48 and added a digression, by way of interest, and completed (the transaction).[10.]
Guest.
Come then, let us, going back to the be­ ginning, connect with the end the discourse concerning the name of the statesman's art.
Soc. jun.
By all means.
Guest.
One part then of intellectual science was at the beginning the commanding;
and the part assimilated to this was called the self-commanding.
Again, of the self-command­ ing, the rearing of animals was cut off, as not the smallest part of the genera;
and of the rearing of animals, the rear­ in- of herds was a species;
and of the rearing of herds, (a part) was the care of foot-walking animals;
and of the care of foot-walking animals, the science of rearing the hornless race was especially cut off.
But of this again, it is neces­ sary to connect a part, not less than the triple, if any one is desirous of bringing it under one name, by calling it the science of tending an unmixed genius.
But a section from this, which alone remains, and which rears men, as being a biped flock, is the part which has been just now explored, and is called, at one and the same time, the kingly and states- manly kind.
Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Do you then, Socrates, think that this has been, as you say, really done well ?Soc.jun.
What?
Guest.
That the thing proposed has been in every respect sufficiently discussed.
Or has our investigation been parti­ cularly deficient in this very thing, that the account has been given in words, but not in all respects worked out to the end ?
Soc. jun.
How say you ?
Guest.
I will endeavour to explain to ourselves more clearly what I am thinking of.Soc.jun.
Say it.
Guest.
There is then of many herdsmen’s arts, that have appeared to us, one, the statesman's, and the guardianship of some one herd.
Soc.jun.
There is.
Guest.
This our discourse has defined to be neither the rearer of horses, nor of other animals, but to be the science of rearing men in common.[11.]
Soc. jun.
It did so.
Guest.
Now let us see what is the difference between all herdsmen and kings.
Soc. jun.
What is it ?
Guest.
If any one of the rest,49 possessing the name of another art, says and pretends to be the rearer in common of the herd, (what should we say)?50Soc. jun.
How say you ?
Guest.
Just as if all merchants, and husbandmen, and pur­ veyors of food, and besides these, teachers of gymnastics, and the genus of physicians, should, you know that51 by their speeches oppose altogether the herdsmen of the human race, whom we have called statesmen, and assert that it is their care to rear men, and not only men herded together, but even the rulers themselves-Soc. jun.
Would they not rightly say?
Guest.
Perhaps so.
And we will consider this too.
We know that no one will contend with a herdsman about things of this kind ;
since he is himself the rearer, himself the physician, and himself, as it were, the bridesman (of the herd), and is alone skilled in the midwife's art respecting the birth and delivery of the produce.
52
No one, besides, is better able, by such sport and music as cattle can, by their nature, share in, to console and soothe, and render gentle, both with instruments and the naked mouth, handling in the best way the music of his flock.53
And the same may be said of other herdsmen.
Or may it not ?
Soc. jun.
Most right.
Guest.
How then will our discourse respecting a king ap­ pear to be right and entire, when we place him alone, as the herdsman and rearer of the human herd, selecting him alone out of ten thousand others contending with him ?
Soc. jun.
By no means.
Guest.
Did we not then a little before very properly fear, when we suspected, lest we should only speak of a certain figure of a king, and not perfectly work out the statesman, until by taking away those, who were diffused around him, and laid claim to a fellow-rearing, and, by separating him from them, we should exhibit him alone and pure ?
Soc. jun.
Most rightly (did we fear).
Guest.
This then, Socrates, must be done by us, unless we are about to bring disgrace upon our discourse at its end.
Soc. jun.
But this at least must by no means be done.12.] Guest.
We must then march by another road again from another beginning.
Soc. jun.
By what road?
Guest.
By mixing up almost some merriment.
For it is requisite to make use of the prolix portion of a long story, and, as regards what still remains, to take away, as we did before, always a part from a part, till we arrive at the summit of the inquiry.
Must we not do so ?
Soc. jun.
Certainly.
Guest.
Give then, as children do, entirely your attention to my story;
(for)54 you are not altogether flying from many years55 of merriment.
Soc. jun.
Relate it.
Guest.
Of the things then said of old, there have been, and will be still, many others (preserved), and the prodigy likewise relating to the reported contests between Atreus and Thyestes.
For you have surely heard and remember what is then said to have happened.
Soc. jun.
Perhaps you mean the prodigy respecting the golden ewe.
Guest.
By no means;
but respecting the change in the rising and setting of the sun, and of the other constellations, how that they set then at the very place from whence they now rise, and rose from the opposite one ;
56 and that the deity gave a testimony in favour of Atreus, and changed (the heavens)57 into the present figure.
Soc. jun.
This too is reported.
Guest.
And we have likewise heard from many of the kingdom over which Kronos (Saturn) ruled.
Soc. jun.
We have from very many.
Guest.
And that the men of former times were produced earth-born, and not begotten from each other ?58Soc.jun.
This too is one of the things said of old.
Guest.
All these things then arose from the same circum­ stance, and in addition to these ten thousand others, and still more wonderful.
But, through the length of time, some of them have become extinct, and others are told in a dispersed manner, separate from each other.
But that which is the cause of this to all these, no person has told as yet;
and it must be now told;
for being told it will be something con­ spicuous for showing forth the king.[13.]
Soc.jun.
You have spoken most beautifully.
Say on then, and omit nothing.
Guest.
Hear, then.
This universe the deity does at one time conduct himself, as it proceeds, and with it rolls on ;
but at another leaves it, when its revolutions shall have received the measure of the fitting time;
and it is then brought back again of its own accord to a contrary state, being a thing of life, and having a share of intelligence from him, who put it together at its outset.
Now this movement backwards has been of necessity implanted in it through this.
Soc. jun.
Through what ?
Guest.
To subsist always according to the same, and in a similar manner, and to be the same, belongs to the most divine of all things alone.
But the nature of body is not of this order.
But that, which we have called heaven and the world, has a share in many and blessed (gifts) from the producing (cause) ;
moreover,59 it has had a share of body;
from whence it cannot be entirely without a share of change;
nevertheless, according to its power it is moved as much as possible in the same, and according to the same, by one impetus.
Hence it is allotted a revolving movement, as being the smallest change in its mo­ tion.
But scarcely any thing is able to turn itself by itself, ex­ cept that which is the leader of all things that are moved.
And it is not lawful for this to move at one time in one way, and at another in a contrary way.
From all this then we must say, that the world does not always cause itself to revolve, nor that the whole is always made by the deity to revolve in two and contrary revolutions:
nor, again, that some two deities, whose thoughts are contrary to each other, cause it to revolve;
but what has been said just now, and remains alone, that at one time it is conducted by another divine cause, possessing the power to live again, and receiving an immortality prepared by the demiurgus;
but that at another time, when it is let loose, it proceeds itself by itself;
and, after being thus let loose for such60 a time as to perform back again many myriads of revolutions, it proceeds by its being of the greatest size, and most equally balanced, to move at the smallest foot.
61Soc.jun.
All that you have gone through appears to be said very reasonably indeed.[14.]
Guest.
Reasoning then from what has been said already, let us think together on the circumstance, which we stated was the cause of all these wonderful doings.
For it is this very thing.
Soc. jun.
What?
Guest.
That the movement of the universe is at one time carried on, as it is at present, in a circle, and at another time in the contrary direction.
Soc. jun.
How is this ?
Guest.
We must consider this change of motion to be the greatest and most perfect of all the revolutions, relating to the heavenly bodies.
Soc. jun.
It is likely.
Guest.
It is proper then to think that the greatest changes happen at that time to us, who are living within the universe.Soc.jun.
And this too is likely.
Guest.
But do we not know that the nature of animals sus­ tains with difficulty changes great, numerous, and of all kinds ?Soc.jun.
How not?
Guest.
Hence the greatest destruction of other animals necessarily takes place at that time, and that of the human race only some small portion remains.
And to these many other wonderful and novel circumstances happen at the same time;
but this is the greatest, and follows that revolution of the universe at that period, when a turn occurs contrary to the present state of things.
Soc. jun.
What?
Guest.
The period of life, which each animal then had, this was first arrested in all;
and all that was mortal ceased to be seen advancing to old age, but changing back to the contrary, grew, as it were, younger and more delicate.
The white hairs too of older people became black, and the cheeks of those that had beards becoming smooth, brought back each person to the past blooming period of life.
The bodies likewise of such as were in manhood's prime, becoming smoother and smaller each day and night, returned again to the nature of a newly-born child, and were assimilated to this nature, both in soul and body;
and thenceforth wasting away, disappeared in reality entirely ;
62 and the corpses of those, who died at that time through violence, did, through undergoing the self­ same fate, become in a manner unseen, and in a few days, quite putrid.62[15.]
Soc.jun.
But what was then, 0 guest, the gener­ ation of animals, and in what manner were they produced from each other?
Guest.
It is evident, Socrates, that at that time there was no generation of one thing from another;
but, it is said, there was once an earth-born race;
this was at that period restored back again from out the earth;
and the tradition of it was remembered by our first progenitors, who were close upon the revolution (that reached to) the period next in order, and were born at the beginning of the present state of things.
For they became the heralds to us of those accounts, which are at pre­ sent disbelieved improperly by the multitude.
For I think we ought to reflect together on the consequence.
For from the fact of old men coming to the nature of boys, it follows,63 64that of such as were dead, but (not) laid in the earth, the corpses would be put together and made to revive 64 by the turn of production revolving in a contrary direction ;
and that the earth-born race would, according to this method 65 being neces­ sarily produced, have their name and speech, except such as a deity conveyed (elsewhere), or invested with another fate.
66Soc. jun.
This really follows from what has been said above.
But with respect to the life, which you say was under the rule of Kronos (Saturn), did it subsist in those revolutions, or in these ?
For it is evident that the change in the position of the stars and the sun coincides with both these revolutions.
Guest.
You have followed well the discourse.
But, in answer to your question respecting all things being produced spontaneously for mankind, this by no means is the case in the present revolution;
but it occurred in the former.
For then the deity was at first the ruler and guardian of the whole revolving circle;
just as now the parts of the world are lo­ cally distributed by gods ruling in the very same way.
Divine dæmons, too, had a share, after the manner of shepherds, in animals according to genera and herds, each being sufficient for all things pertaining to the several particulars over which he presided;
so that there was nothing of a wild nature, no eating of each other, no war, nor sedition of any kind;
and ten thousand other things might be stated, which follow upon such an arrangement.
But what is said respecting the spon­ taneous life of these men, has been stated on this account.
The deity himself tended them, and was their protector;
just as men now, being an animal more divine than others,67 tend other races meaner than themselves;
and as he tended them, there were no forms of state or polity, nor a property in women and children;
for all these were restored to life from the earth, and had no recollection of former events.
68
But all such things were absent;
they had however fruit in abundance from oaks, and many other trees, not grown by land tilling, but given spontaneously by the earth.
They lived, too, for the most part naked, upon no strewed couch, and in the open air;
for the temperament of the seasons was not painful to them;
theirs were soft beds of grass, springing up without grudging from the earth.
And thus, Socrates, you hear what was the life of men under Kronos (Saturn) :
but you, being present yourself, perceive what is life now, which is said to be under Zeus (Jupiter).
But are you able and willing likewise to judge which of these is the happier ?
Soc. jun.
By no means.
Guest.
Do you wish then that I should, after a fashion, judge for you ?
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.[16.]
Guest.
If then those nurtured by Kronos (Saturn), when they had so much leisure and the power to converse not only with men, but with brutes likewise, had used all these means for the purposes of philosophy, associating with brutes and with each other, and inquiring of every nature which had a per­ ceptive power of its own, in what respect it differed from the rest for the collecting together of prudence, it is easy to judge that the men of that time were ten thousand-fold happier than those of the present.
But if, being filled to satiety with meats and drinks, they discoursed with each other, and with brutes, in fables69 such as are now told of them, it is easy, according to my opinion, to prove the very same70 thing.
Let us, however, dismiss this question, until some one shall appear sufficient to point out whether the men of that time had any desire for science and the need of discourse.
But let us now state for what reason we have raised up the fable, in order that we may after this proceed onwards.
71 For when the time of all these was completed, and it was necessary for a change to take place, and moreover when the whole race on earth was already consumed, 72and every soul had given up its generations, and as many seeds as were ordained for each soul, it having fallen on the earth,72—then did the governor of the universe, re­ leasing himself, as it were, from the handle of a rudder, depart to his own place of a look-out;
and then Fate and implanted De­ sire again caused the world to revolve.
All the gods then, who govern locally, in conjunction with the greatest divinity, know­ ing what was now taking place, again deprived the parts of the world of their providential care.
But the world having un­ dergone a change in its revolution, conflicting73 and rushing with the contrary impulse of a beginning and end, and pro­ ducing in itself a mighty concussion, worked out again another destruction of all kinds of animals.
After this, when a suf­ ficient time had gone on, the world ceasing from tumult, con­ fusion, and concussions, did, taking advantage of a calm, proceed, arranged most beautifully74 in its usual course, pos­ sessing a guardianship and dominion itself over the things in itself and belonging to itself;
(and) remembering, to the utmost of its power, the instructions of the demiurgus and father.
Now at the commencement it performed this duty more carefully, but at the end more obtusely.
But the cause of this is in the corporeal form of the temperature, which had grown up75 with its former nature;
since it partook of much disorder,76 before it arrived at its present orderly ar­ rangement.
For from him, who put it together, it obtained every good;
but from its previous habit, whatever harshness and injustice exist in heaven, these it does both possess itself from that former habit, and introduce likewise into animals.
In conjunction then with the ruler, the world, when nourishing the animals within it, brings forth evil of a small kind, but good of a large;
but separated from him, it con­ ducts all things beautifully during the time nearest to his departure;
but as time goes on, and oblivion comes on it, the circumstance of its former unfitness domineers with greater force;
and at the concluding period of time it bursts out into the full flower of wrong ;
77 and (producing) only a little good, but mingling much of the temperament of things contrary to good, it arrives at the danger of both its own destruction, and of the things within it.
Hence the god, who .
arranged the world, perceiving it in difficulties, and anxious lest, being thus tempest-tost, it should be thoroughly loosened by the hurly-burly, and be plunged into the infinite sea78 of dissimili­ tude, again seats himself at the helm ;
and whatever is labour­ ing and loosened 79 in its own former period, he having turned arranges, and by putting straight, renders the world free from death and old age.
This then is (one) end of the whole story.
But this is sufficient to show, from what has been said, the na­ ture of a king to such, as lay hold of the discourse.
For the world having been again turned to the present path of genera­ tion, its age was again stopped, and it imparted novel things, the contrary to what it had done formerly.
For animals, wanting but little to be through their small size annihilated, are increased;
and hoary bodies recently born from the earth, dying again, descend into the earth ;
and all other things are changed, imitating and following the condition of the universe.
The imitation, likewise, of conception, generation, and nourishing, followed all things from necessity.
For it was no longer possible for an animal to be produced in the earth, through the different things, which compose it;
but, as the world was or­ dained to be the absolute ruler of its own progress, so after the same manner its parts also were destined by a similar guid­ ance to spring forth,80 generate, and nourish, as far as they were able.
But we have now arrived at the very question for the sake of which the whole of our discourse has proceeded.
For, with respect to other beasts, many circumstances, and of a prolix nature, might be gone through;
such as, from what each is, and through what cause they have been changed;
but those relating to man are shorter, and more to our purpose.
For mankind having become destitute of the guardian care of the daemon, who possesses and tends us, while the majority of animals, that were naturally cruel, have on the other hand become savage, men, now weak, and with­ out a guard, were torn in pieces by such animals;
and, in those earliest times, they were without inventions and arts;
for after the earth had failed in its spontaneous food, they did not know how to procure it, through no want having previ­ ously compelled them (to get it).
From all these causes they were in the greatest difficulties.
Hence, the old-mentioned gifts were given us by gods, together with the necessary instruc­ tion and erudition ;
81 fire from Prometheus, and arts from He­ phæstus (Vulcan), and his fellow-artist (Pallas) ;
on the other hand, seeds and plants were given by others, and all such things as furnish a support for human life, were produced from these ;
since, as was stated just now, the guardian care of the gods had deserted mankind;
and it became requisite for men to have the conduct and care of themselves, in the same manner as the whole world;
in the imitating and following which, through all the revolutions of time, we live and are born, now in this way, and now in that.
Let this then be the end of the story.
But we will make it useful for discovering how far we have erred in defining the characters of a king and statesman in our previous discourse.[17.]
Soc.jun.
In what respect then, and how far, do you say has there been an error ?
Guest.
82Partly less, and partly in a very generous man­ ner, and in a greater degree, and more than before.82Soc.jun.
How?
Guest.
Because, when we were asked respecting a king and a statesman belonging to the present revolution and ge­ neration, we spoke of a person tending a human herd of the contrary period, and this too a god, and not a man.
In this then we transgressed very much.
But when we exhibited him as the ruler of the whole state, we did not say in what man­ ner (he was so);
and in this respect the truth was told, but not the whole (truth), nor was it clearly enunciated;
hence we erred less in this case than in that.
Soc. jun.
True.
Guest.
We ought then, it seems, to expect that the states­ man will have been completely described by us, when we shall have defined the manner of governing a state.
Soc.jun.
Very well.
Guest.
On this account we have brought forward the story, in order that (one)83 might show, with respect to the herd- tending, not only that all contend about it with the person now sought for;
but that we might more clearly perceive him, whom alone it is fitting, according to the pattern of shepherds and neat-herds, to have the tending of the human herd, and alone worthy to be called by that name.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
But I think, Socrates, that this figure of a divine shepherd is still greater than becomes a king;
and that the statesmen now existing here are much more like subjects in their nature, and take more nearly a share in discipline and nurture.
Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But they will have to be investigated neither more nor less, whether they are naturally in this position or in that.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
Let us then turn back again.
For we said, that there was a self-commanding art respecting animals, which took care of them, not privately, but in common;
and this art we then straightway called the herd-tending art.
Do you recollect ?Soc.jun.
Yes.
Guest.
In this then we erred.
For we have not by any means laid hold of the statesman, nor given him a name;
but as regards the appellation, it has lain hid from and escaped us.
Soc. jun.
How so ?
Guest.
To tend the several kinds of herds belongs to all other herdsmen;
but we have not given a fitting name to the statesman, it being requisite for him to bear one of those common to all.
Soc. jun.
You speak the truth, if indeed there happens to be (a common one).
84Guest.
But how is it not possible to apply the word healing, as something common to all, neither tending nor any other occupation being stated ?
and if 85it is lawful for persons giv­ in- a name (to an art) to wrap it up (in words like) herd-tend­ ing, or healing in any way, as being applicable generally, (it is lawful to wrap up) the word statesman likewise85 together with others, especially since reason shows that this should (be done) ?[18.]
Soc. jun.
Right.
But after this in what manner would the division be made ?
Guest.
In the same manner, as we before divided the herd-tending art for the walking and wingless86 tribes, and for the unmixed and hornless, in the very same manner by divid­ ing the herd-tending, we shall have comprehended both the present kingly rule and that in the time of Kronos (Saturn) similarly in our discourse.
Soc.jun.
It appears so.
But I am seeking what (will be) after this.
87Guest.
It is plain that if the word herd-tending had been thus spoken, no one would have contended with us that there is no idea whatever of attention in it;
as it was then justly contended, that there is no art amongst us which deserves the appellation of tending;
and that if there were, it belongs to many things prior and preferable to any thing pertaining to kings.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest. 88 But no other art would be willing to say that it is more and before kingly rule, as a careful tending of the whole of human fellowship, and of men taken generally.88Soc.jun.
You say rightly.
Guest.
But after this, Socrates, do you perceive that an error has been made frequently towards the very end ?
Soc. jun.
Of what kind ?
Guest.
In this, that though we have conceived that there is a certain rearing art of a biped herd, we ought not any more to have straightway called it, as if entirely complete, the art of the king and statesman.Soc.jun.
Why not?
Guest.
In the first place, as we said, we (ought) to have suited the name more to guardianship than to nutriment:
and in the next place, to make a division in this (guardianship).
For it will have no small divisions.
Soc. jun.
Of what kind ?
Guest.
In that we can surely place apart the divine shepherd, and the human guardian.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
And again it is necessary to cut into two the dis­ tributed89 guardianship.
Soc. jun.
Into what?
Guest.
Into the violent and the voluntary.
Soc. jun.
What then ?
Guest.
By erring before in this more stupidly than was fitting, we put down together a king and a tyrant as the same;
although they are most dissimilar both in themselves and in their form of government respectively.
Soc. jun.
True.
Guest.
Now therefore, again correcting ourselves, let us, as I have already said, divide human guardianship into the violent and the voluntary.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
And calling the guardianship by the violent tyran­ nic, but the voluntary, 90[and the herd-tending of voluntary biped animals,]90 statesmanship, let us show, that he who pos­ sesses this [art and]91 guardianship is truly a king and a statesman.[19.]
Soc.jun.
And thus the demonstration, 0 guest, re­ specting the statesman, is very like to appear to us as being perfect.
Guest.
This would be well for us, Socrates.
But it is requisite that this should appear not only to you, but likewise to me, in common with you.
At present, however, the king appears to me not to possess as yet a perfect figure;
but just as statuaries, who by hastening their work sometimes unsea­ sonably, do, through introducing more and greater things than are fitting, retard it;
so have we at present, in order that we might show both quickly and splendidly, that we erred in the former part of our digression, through thinking that great patterns should be employed in the case of a king, have brought in a marvellous mass of a myth, and been com­ pelled to use a greater portion of it than was proper.
On this account, we have made a rather prolix demonstration, and have not entirely finished the fable.
But our discourse really appears somewhat like an animal, to have its outline defined sufficiently, but to have not received the distinctness given by pigments, and the mixture of colours.
But it is more becom­ ing to exhibit every animal by a description, to such as are able to follow the account,92 than by painting, and all the work of hand;
but to other persons through works of the hand.
Soc.jun.
This indeed (is said rightly) :
but show me why you say you have not yet spoken sufficiently.
Guest.
It is difficult, 0 divine youth, to exhibit great things sufficiently, without using patterns.
For each of us appear to know all things as in a night-dream, and again to be ignorant of all things according to a day-dream.
93Soc. jun.
How said you this?
Guest.
We appear in the present case to have mooted very absurdly the circumstance relating to the knowledge (which is) in us.
Soc. jun.
How so ?
Guest.
The pattern, 0 blessed one, has required itself again a pattern.
Soc. jun.
What ?
Tell me, and do not, on my account at least, hesitate.[20.]
Guest.
I must speak, since you are ready to follow.
For we know, that children know their letters.
Soc.jun.
What?
Guest.
That they understand sufficiently each of the letters in the shortest and easiest syllables, and are able to speak the truth concerning them.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
But, being on the other hand doubtful about those in other syllables, they say what is false in idea and word.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Is it not then the easiest and the best thing to lead them thus to what is not yet known ?
Soc. jun.
How ?
Guest.
By first leading them back to those things, in which they had correct ideas respecting those very same matters;
and after leading them, to place before them things not yet known;
and by comparing them together, to show that there is the same likeness 94 and nature in both the combinations, till the things conceived, having been compared with all the unknown, are shown correctly;
and, after being shown and becoming thus patterns, cause each one of all the letters in all the syllables to be called one different, and another the same, as being always under the same circumstances, differ­ ent and the same (respectively).
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
This then we sufficiently comprehend, that the pro­ duction of a pattern then takes place, when that, which is the same, is, in the case of another thing placed apart, rightly con­ ceived by opinion, and being brought together to it, produces one true opinion respecting either, as it did about both.
Soc. jun.
It appears so.
Guest.
Shall we then wonder, if our soul, suffering naturally the same thing respecting the elements of all things, does at one time stand firm in certain points under the influence of truth respecting each individual thing, and at another time fluctuates in other points respecting all things ?
and that when, (as regards) some (elements) of comminglings, it thinks rightly, it should somehow or another again be ignorant of these very same things, when they are transferred to long and difficult syllable-like unions of things ?
95Soc. jun.
There is nothing wonderful in this.
Guest.
But 96 how, my friend, can any one, beginning from false opinion, arrive at even a small portion of truth, and thus acquire wisdom ?Soc.jun.
Nearly not at all.
Guest.
If then these things are naturally in this way, you and I shall not in any respect overdo it, if, by first endeavour­ ing to perceive the nature of the whole pattern in some other small and partial one, and after this,97 by transferring to the nature of a king, which is the greatest of all patterns, the same species, from lesser things from some quarter, we shall be about to endeavour again, through a pattern, to know by art the care of state affairs,97 so that there may be a day-dream instead of a night one.
Soc. jun.
Perfectly right.
Guest.
Again then let us take up the preceding reasoning, that since ten thousand persons contend with the kingly genus, respecting the guardianship of a state, it is requisite to separ­ ate all these, and to leave it by itself.
And for this purpose we said we have need of some pattern.
Soc. jun.
And very much so.[21.]
Guest.
By producing then what pattern, which em­ braces an occupation similar to statesmanship, 98 and is the smallest possible,98 could one sufficiently find the thing sought for?
Are you, Socrates, willing, by Zeus, unless we have something else at hand, for us to choose at least the weaving art ?
and this too not the whole, if it seems good;
for, per­ haps, the art relating to weaving of wool will suffice.
For it may happen, that even this portion being chosen will witness to what we want ( to show).
Soc.jun.
For why should it not ?
Guest.
Why then have we not, as we did before, after cut­ ting the parts, each of them separate, done the very same thing now in the case of the weaving art?
and why, after passing over all things to the best of our power in the short­ est manner possible, have we not come to what is useful at present ?
Soc. jun.
How say you?
Guest.
I will make the digression itself an answer.
Soc. jun.
You speak most excellently.
Guest.
Of all the things which we fabricate and possess, some are for the sake of our doing something, and others are defences against our not suffering.
And of these defences some are medicinal, both divine and human;
others are protective.
And of the protective, some are warlike implements, others (peaceful) defences.
And of the (peaceful) defences, some are veils, others are to ward off heat and cold.
And of those that ward off, some cover at a distance, others near.
And of the near, some are extended under, others around.
And of those extended around, some are cut as a whole piece, others put together.
And of those put together, soma are perfor­ ated, others are bound together, not perforated.
And of those that are not perforated, some are composed of the fibres of the plants of the earth, others are hairy.
And of the hairy, some are conglutinated by water and earth, others are connected themselves with themselves.
Now to these defences and cover­ ings, which are wrought from the things bound together, them­ selves with themselves, we give the name of dress.
And let us call the art, which is especially conversant with dresses, dress-making, from the thing itself;
in the same manner as we called above the art respecting a state, statesmanship.
And let us say too, that the weaving art, so far as it weaves for the most part garments, differs in nothing but the name from the dress-making art;
just as (we said) there, that the king-art (differed only nominally) from statesmanship.
Soc. jun.
Most correctly.
Guest.
After this let us reason (thus), that some one may perhaps think that the weaving art relating to dresses has been thus defined sufficiently, he being unable to perceive that it is not yet distinguished from its proximate co-operators, but is separated from many other things of a kindred nature.[22.]
Soc. jun.
Tell me what things of a kindred nature.
Guest.
You have not followed what has been said, as it seems.99
It appears, therefore, that we must return from the end to the beginning.
For, if you understand affinity, we have now separated this from that, by separating the com­ position of coverings into things put under, and around.
Soc. jun.
I understand you.
Guest.
We have likewise separated every kind of manufac­ ture from flax and hemp, and all such things as we just now described in the list of the fibres of plants.
We also defined the art of making a felt-like substance, and the putting together by means of perforation and sewing, which for the most part pertains to the cobler's art.Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
We have also separated the care 100 bestowed on the coblcr's art relating to coverings cut in the whole piece, and of such as are employed in building, and in the whole of the carpenter's art, and in all others that are employed in stop­ ping the flowing of water, and such arts too of (peaceful) defences as furnish works to be an impediment to thieving and to acts of violence, and which are employed about the production of obstacles and the fixing of doors, and are dis­ tributed as parts of the bolt-making art.
We have likewise divided the armour-making art, which is a section of the great and varied power of defence-making.
We also defined, in the very beginning, the whole art of quackery, which is con­ versant with medicines ;
and we left, so that we might seem (to be),' the very art defensive against storms, of which we are in search, and which produces woollen vestments, and is called the art of weaving.
Soc.jun.
It seems so.
Guest.
But this matter, 0 boy, has not been perfectly detailed.
For he, who first engaged in the making of garments, appeared to act in a manner directly contrary to weaving.
Soc.jun.
How so?
Guest.
For the work of weaving is a certain knitting to­ gether.
Soc. jun.
It is.
Guest.
But the work (of the garment-maker) consists in loosening things put together, and felted together.
Soc. jun.
What kind of work is this ?
Guest.
The work of the art of the wool-carder.
Or shall we dare to call the art of wool-carding the weaving art, and a wool-carder a weaver ?
Soc. jun.
By no means.
Guest.
But if any one should call the art of making the warp and woof the weaving art, would he not assert a para­ dox, and give it a false name ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
But whether shall we say that the whole of the fuller's and the mender's art contribute nothing to the attention to and care of garments ?
Or shall we call all these weaving arts ?
Soc. jun.
By no means.
Guest.
But all these contend with the power of the weaving art, respecting the care and the production of garments;
at­ tributing, indeed, to it the greatest part, but likewise assign­ in- to themselves great portions of the same art.Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Besides these, it further appears requisite, that the handicraft arts, relating to the instruments through which the works of the weaver are performed, should lay claim to be co-causes of all weaving.
Soc.jun.
Most right.
Guest.
Whether then will our discourse about the weaving art, a part of which we have chosen, be sufficiently defined, if we lay it down that it is the most beautiful and the greatest of all the arts, which are employed about woollen garments ?
Or shall we thus, indeed, speak something of the truth, but yet neither clcarly nor perfectly, till we have separated all these arts from it ?
Soc. jun. Correctly.[23.]
Guest.
Must we not then after this so act, that, what we say, may proceed in an orderly series ?Soc.jun.
How not ?
Guest.
In the first place then let us consider two arts, which exist about all things.
Soc. jun.
What are they ?
Guest.
One is the co-cause of generation, and the other is the cause itself.
Soc. jun.
How?
Guest.
Such arts, as do not fabricate the thing itself, but prepare instruments for the fabricating (arts), without the pre­ sence of which the proposed work could not be effected 2 by each of the arts,2 these are co-causes:
but those, which fabri­ cate the thing itself, are causes.3Soc.jun.
This is reasonable.
Guest.
In the next place, those arts which produce the dis­ taff, and the shuttle, and such other instruments as contribute to the making of garments, all these are co-causes :
4 but those which pay attention to and fabricate garments, causes.Soc.jun.
Most right.
Guest.
But of causes, it is reasonable to comprehend that portion of itS especially, which pertains to washing and mend­ ing, and all the caring about these, since the adorning art is abundant, and to denominate the whole the fuller's art.Soc.jun.
It will so.
Guest.
Moreover, the carding and spinning, and all that re­ lates to the making of the garment, of which we are detailing the parts, is one art, called by all persons the wool-working.
Soc.jun.
How not ?
Guest.
Of the wool-working there are two sections, and each of these are together naturally parts of two arts.
Soc.jun.
How ?
Guest.
The carding, and the half of that which uses the shuttle, and separates from each other whatever are placed together, all this in short is a part of the wool-working art;
and there were two great parts as regards the whole, one com­ mingling, and the other separating.
Soc.jun.
Yes.
Guest.
Of the separating then, both the carding and all those just now mentioned are a part.
For that, which in the case of the wool and thread is the separating art, takes place, after one manner with the shuttle, and after another with the hands, has the names which we have just now mentioned.
Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Again, let us take a part of the commingling, and of the wool-working contained in it;
but let us pass by all that was there relating to the separating, and let us bisect the wool-working (art) together into the commingling and se­ parating section.
Soc.jun.
Let it be so divided.
Guest.
We must then, Socrates, divide the commingling.
and at the same time the wool-working, if we are about to comprehend sufficiently the proposed weaving art.
Soc. jun.
It will be requisite.
Guest.
It will indeed ;
and let us say, that one part of it is twisting, and the other complicating.
Soc. jun.
Do I then understand you ?
For you appear to me to say that the working of the thread is twisting.
Guest.
Not the working of this only, but likewise of the woof.
6
Or shall we find any production of it which is not twisting ?Soc.jun.
By no means.
Guest.
Define also each of these :
for perhaps the definition will be suitable.
Soc. jun.
In what way ?
Guest.
In this.
We say that of the operations of wool- carding, that which has been drawn out into length and pos­ sesses breadth, is a certain filament.
Soc.jun.
We do.
Guest.
And of this, when it is turned by the spindle, and becomes a solid thread, do thou call a stamen;
but the art, which regulates it, let us say that this is stamen-weaving.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
But such fabrics as receive a loose twisting, and, by the infolding of the stamen through the dragging of the knap­ ping process, acquire a moderate softness, of these we call what is spun the woof, but the art itself which presides over these, woof-spinning.
Soc. jun.
Most right.
Guest.
And now that part of the weaving art, which we have brought forward, is obvious to every one.
For, with respect to a part of the commingling art in wool-working, when it accomplishes that, which is woven by a straight- knitting together of the woof and the thread, then the whole of the thing woven we call a woollen garment, but the art (presiding) over it, weaving.
Soc. jun.
Most right.[24.]
Guest.
Be it so.
But why then did we not immedi­ ately answer, that the weaving (art) is that which infolds the woof and the thread, instead of proceeding in a round-about way, and defining many things in vain ?
Soc. jun.
It does not appear to me, 0 guest, that of what has been said a single thing has been said in vain.
Guest.
This is not at all wonderful.
But perhaps, 0 blessed youth, it will appear so.
But against such a disorder, should it hereafter by chance7 come upon you—8 for nothing is wonderful8—hear a certain discourse, proper to be spoken about all such things as these.
Soc. jun.
Only relate it.
Guest.
Let us then in the first place look into the whole of excess and deficiency, in order that we may praise and blame according to reason whatever is said on each occasion at greater length, or the contrary, than is becoming in disputa­ tions of this kind.•
Soc. jun.
It will be proper so to do.
Guest.
Our discourse taking place on these points, would, I think, take place rightly.
Soc.jun.
About what things?
Guest.
About length and shortness, and the whole of ex­ cess and deficiency.
For the art of measuring is conversant with all these.
Soc. jun.
It is.
Guest.
Let us divide it then into two parts.
For it is necessary for that, to which we are hastening.
Soc. jun.
Inform me how this division (is to be made).
Guest.
Thus.
One part according to the ideas relating in common to great and little, but the other part according to the necessary existence of production.
Soc.jun.
How say you ?
Guest.
Does it not appear to you to be according to nature, that we ought to speak of the greater as being greater than nothing else but the lesser ?
and on the other hand of the lesser, as being lesser than the greater, but nothing else ?
Soc. jun.
To me it does.
Guest.
But what, must we not say that, what surpasses the nature of moderation, and is surpassed by it, whether in words or actions, is, when produced in reality, that by which the good and bad of us differ the most from each other ?Soc.jun.
It appears so.
Guest.
These twofold existences then and judgments re­ specting the great and the small we must lay down ;
but not, as we just now said, with reference to each other only;
but, as is just now said, we must speak of one as being referable9 to each other, but of the other (as referable) to moderation.
Are we however willing to learn on what account this is requisite ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
If any one admits the nature of the greater (to be referable)10 to nothing but the lesser, it will not be (refer­ able) to moderation.
Will it?
Soc. jun.
(It will be) thus.
Guest.
Shall' we not then destroy the arts themselves, and all their works, according to this reasoning ?
And shall we not cause to disappear entirely the statesman's science, which we are now investigating, and that which is called the weav­ ing art?
For all such things as these guard against that, which is more or less than moderation, not as if it had no existence, but as a thing of a difficult nature in practice;
and after this manner preserving moderation, they effect every thing beautiful and good.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
If then we cause to disappear the statesman's sci­ ence, will not our subsequent search of king-science be with­ out a road ?
Soc. jun.
Very much so.
Guest.
Whether then, as in the Sophist, we compelled non­ entity to exist, 11 after the discourse about it had fled from us in that direction, so now we shall compel the more and the less to become measured, not only with reference to each other, but likewise to the production of moderation ?
For no one can become indisputably a statesman, or be any person else, possessing a knowledge relating to actions, if this be not ac­ knowledged.
Soc. jun.
We ought then to do this even now as much as possible.[25.]
Guest.
This,
Socrates, is a still greater work than that;
although we remember how great was its prolixity.
But it is very just to put hypothetically something of this kind respecting them..Soc. jun.
Of what kind ?
Guest.
That there will be a need of what has been just stated, for the demonstration of what is accurate respecting it.
12
But as regards the present question, this reasoning is shown, well and sufficiently, it appears to me, to assist us in a conspicuous manner, so that' we must think all arts are to be measured according to something more and at the same time less, not only with reference to one another, but to the production likewise of moderation.
For when this exists, they exist also;
and when they exist, this exists also;
but when either of these does not exist, neither of those will exist.
Soc. jun.
This indeed is right.
But what is there after this ?
Guest.
It is evident that we should divide the art of mea­ suring, as has been said, into two parts;
placing as one of its parts all those arts, which measure number, and length, and depth, and breadth, and thickness, with reference to the contrary;
but placing as its other part, such arts as regard the moderate and the becoming, the seasonable and the fit, and all such as are separated from the extremes towards the middle (point).
Soc. jun.
Each of these sections is great, and they differ much from each other.
Guest.
That, Socrates, which many clever men, who think they are saying something wise, sometimes assert, when they say that the art of measuring is conversant with all generated natures, that very thing happens to be now asserted by us.
For all things of art do after a certain manner partake of measure;
but, in consequence of not being accustomed to divide according to species, these men immediately bring together to the same point things widely differing from each other, and consider them as similar;
and, on the other hand, they do the very contrary to this, by not dividing according to their parts things that are different;
although it is requisite that when any one first perceives the communion of many things, he should not desist till he perceives all the differences in it, which are placed in species;
and again, when the all-various dissimilitudes in multitudes are perceived, he should not be able, through a feeling of disgust, to desist *(from this un­ pleasant view),* till, having enclosed all such things as are allied in one similitude, he invests them with the existence of a certain genus.
And thus much may suffice respecting these particulars, and concerning defect and excess.
Let us only carefully observe, that two genera of the measuring art re­ specting these have been found out, and let us remember what we say they are.[26.]
Soc.jun.
We will remember.
Guest.
After this discussion, let us assume another re­ specting the objects of our search, and the whole mental ex­ ercise in discourses of this kind.
Soc. jun.
What is it?
Guest.
If any one should ask us respecting the assembling together14 of those that learn their letters, when one is asked of what letters does any word (consist), shall we say that the inquiry is then made for the sake of the one word proposed, rather than that of the party becoming more skilful as a gram­ marian, with respect to every thing placed before him.
Soc. jun.
Evidently as regards every thing (of grammar).
Guest.
Has the inquiry respecting a statesman been pro­ posed by us more for the sake of the statesman himself, than for ourselves to become more skilful dialecticians on every point?
Soc. jun.
This too is evident, that (it is for ourselves to become such) on every point.
Guest.
No one indeed endued with intellect would be will­ ing to hunt out the rationale of the art of weaving, for its own sake alone.
15 But I think it has lain hid from most men, that to some things, which are naturally easy to learn, there are certain similitudes to be perceived by the senses, which it is not difficult to make manifest, when any one wishes to point them out to some one inquiring a reason respecting a thing, not with trouble, but easily without a (long) speech.
15
But of things the greatest and the most honoured, there is not any image made clear for men, by which being shown, he who wishes to fill the soul of the inquirer, will fill it sufficiently by suiting it to one of the senses.
Hence it is requisite to practice oneself in being able to give and receive a reason for every thing.
For incorporeal natures, being the most beauti­ ful and the greatest, are exhibited by reason alone, and by nothing else;
and it is for this that all has been said now.
But the consideration of every particular occurs more easily in small things than in great.
Soc. jun.
You speak most beautifully.
Guest.
Let us then remember that all these things have been said by us on this account.
Soc. jun.
On what?
Guest.
Not the least on account of the disgust, which we have felt disgustingly 16 through the prolix discourse about the weaving art, and about the revolution of the universe, and that of the sophist about the existence of a non-entity, con­ ceiving it to have a rather (considerable) length.
And on all these accounts we reproached ourselves, fearing lest we should speak superfluously in conjunction with prolixity.
16
That we may not then suffer any thing of this kind again, think that on account of all these things our former remarks have been made.
Soc. jun.
Be it so.
Only say what is in order.
17Guest.
I say then, it is requisite that both you and I should be mindful of what we have now said, 18 and to give on each occasion blame and praise of brevity as well as prolixity 18 respecting what we may happen to be speaking, not judging of prolixities with reference to each other, but according to that part of the measuring art, which we then said we ought to remember relating to the becoming.
ISSoc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
But yet all things are not (to be referred) to this.
19 For we shall not be in need of prolixity, which, as regards pleasure, is not all fitting, unless as something of no import­ ance:
:
19 on the other hand, as regards the search of what has been proposed, in order that we may find it most easily, and quickly, reason bids us regard it as a secondary, not primary ob­ ject;
but to honour the most and in the first place, the method of being able20 to divide according to species;
and to pay a serious regard to a discourse, if when spoken at great length it renders the hearer more inventive;
and not to take it ill;
and in like manner, if it be shorter.
And still, in addition to this, (reason says) 21 that he who blames long discourses in meetings such as these, and who does not admit round-about periods, must not dismiss them altogether, rapidly, and immediately, by abusing merely what has been spoken at great length, but he must show moreover that he 22thinks that (words) being shorter22 would render persons coming together more fitted for dialectics, and more able to discover the demonstration by reason of exist­ in- things;
but of the praise and blame of others relating to any other subjects we need take no thought, nor appear to hear at all such words as these. [27.]
But of this there is enough, if so it seems likewise to you.
Let us then again re­ turn to the statesman, introducing the pattern of the above- mentioned weaving art.Soc.jun.
You speak well;
' and let us do as you say.
Guest.
Has not then the king been separated from the majority (of arts), as are fellow-tending, or rather from all that relate to herds ?
But the remaining, we say, (are those) that (belong to) the co-causes, and causes relating to the state itself, which we must separate from each other.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
You know then that it is difficult to bisect these;
and the reason will, I think, as we advance, be not the less apparent.
Soc.jun.
It will be then meet to do so.
Guest.
Let us then separate them like a victim piecemeal;
since we cannot do so by a bisection:
for it is always requisite to cut into the nearest number possible.
Soc.jun.
How then shall we do so at present ?
Guest.
Just as before;
for we laid down as co-causes what­ ever (arts) furnished instruments for weaving.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
The same thing therefore we must do now, and still more than then.
For such arts as fabricate, with regard to a state instrument, either small or large, we must lay down all of them as co-causes;
since without these a state could not exist, nor yet statesmanship.
But on the other hand we will not lay down any one of these as the work23 of kingship.
Soc. jun.
We will not.
Guest.
And yet we are attempting to do a difficult thing, in separating this genus from the rest.
24 For if it appears that he, who says that whatever exists is an instrument of some one thing, says what is credible, 25 still on the other hand let us say that there is this thing different from the possessions in a state.
Soc.jun.
What thing ?
Guest.
AS26 it is not having,this very power.
27For that thing is not put together like an instrument, as a cause of pro­ duction, but for the safety of that which is fabricated.
27Soc. jun.
What kind of thing ?
Guest.
That thing, which being worked up from materials dry and moist, 28and exposed to fire, and without fire,28 is a species of varied kind, which we call by one appellation, a vessel;
and though it is a numerous29 species, it does not I think belong30 at all to the science we are seeking.
Soc. jun.
How not?
Guest.
Of these possessions, there is another and third species very numerous to be looked into, being on land and in the water, and much-wandering and not-wandering, and honourable and dishonourable;
but possessing one name, be­ cause the whole of it exists for the sake of a certain sitting, as becoming always a seat for something.
Soc. jun.
What kind of thing is it ?
Guest.
We call it a vehicle, a thing not at all the work of the statesman's science, but rather more of the carpenter, potter, and brass-founder.
Guest.
What of the fourth (species) ?
Must we speak of one different from these, in which the most of the things for­ merly mentioned are contained;
every kind of dress, the greater part of arms, and all walls, such as are thrown round, of earth or stone, and ten thousand other things.
And since all these are constructed for the sake of a protection, the whole may most justly be called a defence;
and may, for the most part, be considered much more the work of the architect, and more rightly31 of the weaver, than of the statesman.Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Are we willing to rank in the fifth place the arts of adorning and painting, and such as making use of it (painting) and music, finish as imitations, fabricated for our pleasure, and which may be justly comprehended in one name ?
Soc. jun.
In what name?
Guest.
They may be surely denominated amusement.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
"Guest.
This one name then will suit, when pronounced, with all these:
for not one of these things is done through seriousness, but all for the sake of amusement.
Soc.jun.
This too I nearly understand.
Guest.
But that, which prepares for all these materials bodies, out of which and in which, whatever arts have now been mentioned, manufacture (something),32 shall we not place as a sixth all-various species, the offspring of many other arts.
Soc.jun.
Of what (art) are you speaking ?
Guest. 33 That (which furnishes) gold and silver, and other substances found as metals, and whatever the art of felling trees, and the whole of the clipping art, furnishes to the car­ penter, and the knitting art, and still further that which barks trees, and takes off the skins of living animals, [the currier's art,]34 and all such (arts) as are conversant with things of this kind, and such as working on corks, and papyrus-reeds, and withies, furnish the means of manufacturing from genera, not put together, species that are put together.
The whole of this let us call the first-born possession of man, without any putting together, and by no means the work of the science of kingship.
Soc.jun.
Right.
Guest.
The possession of nutriment, and of such things as when mingled with the body possess a certain power, by their parts, to be subservient to the parts of the body, we must rank in the seventh place, by calling it altogether our nurse, unless we have some other better name to give.
However, we will place the whole of this under agriculture, hunting, exercise, medicine, and cooking, and attribute it to these arts more properly than to the science of the statesman.[29.]
Soc. jun.
How not?
Guest.
Nearly then all, whatsoever is connected with posses­ sion, with the exception of tame animals, has I think been men­ tioned in these seven genera.
But consider.
For it was most just that the species (called) first-born should be placed first;
and after this, instrument, vessel, vehicle, protection, amuse­ ment, and cattle.35
But if any thing of no great consequence has escaped us, which it is possible to suit only (with diffi­ culty)36 to some one of these, we omit it;
such as the idea of coin, of seals, and of every thing bearing a mark.
For these things have not in themselves a genus much in common;
but some will agree as regards ornament, others as regards instru­ ments, drawn (into the discussion) indeed with violence, but nevertheless completely.
But the tending of herds, as pre­ viously divided, will appear to have comprehended the whole possession of tame animals with the exception of slaves.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
The genus of slaves and of all servants remains;
amongst whom I conjecture will become apparent those, who engaged in the very thing woven,37 contend with the king in the same manner as those above, that are engaged in knitting, and in wool-combing, and in such other arts as we then men­ tioned, did with the weavers.
But all the rest, spoken of as co-causes, have, together with the works just now mentioned, been done away with,38 and separated from the action of the king and statesman.Soc.jun.
So they seem.
Guest.
Come then, let us approach nearer, and consider the rest, that we may perceive them more firmly.
Soc.jun.
It is requisite (to do so).
Guest.
We shall find then that the greatest servants, so far as we can see from those here, are in a pursuit, and under circumstances the very contrary to what we have suspected.
Soc.jun.
Who are they?
Guest.
They who are purchased, and in this manner be­ come a property;
whom, beyond all controversy, we may call slaves and laying the least claim to the kingly science.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
But what shall we say of those free-born persons, who willingly put themselves to ministering to the parties39 men­ tioned just now, and by conveying the produce of agriculture, and of other arts, to each other, and 40 by equalizing the pos­ session and value of articles,40 do some at (home) markets, and others by going from state to state, by sea and land exchange coin against other things, or itself against itself, (whom we have called money-changers, ship-owners, and hucksters,) will these contend for any part of the statesman's science ?
Soc. jun.
Perhaps some of the foreign merchants will.
Guest.
And yet we shall never find those, who for wages most readily become servants to all persons, laying any claim to the science of a king.
Soc.jun.
For how should we?
Guest.
What then (shall we say) of those, that do such ministerings for us on each occasion.
Soc. jun.
Of what and whom are you speaking?
Guest.
I speak of the tribe of heralds,41 and of those who become accomplished in the art of writing,42 and often act as ministers, and certain other persons, who have very great talents for some other and many kinds of business connected with public offices.
What shall we say of these ?
Soc. jun.
What you have said just now, that they are min­ isters, but no rulers in states.
Guest.
But surely 43 I was not, I think, seeing a vision,43 when I said that in this way, perchance, would be seen those strenuously contending for the science of a statesman.
And yet it would seem to be very absurd to seek after these in any ministering portion.
Soc.jun.
Very much so, indeed.
Guest.
Let us then approach still nearer to those who have not been as yet examined.
Now these are such as possess a certain portion of ministering science relating to divination.
For they are held to be the interpreters of gods to men.
Soc. jun.
They are.
Guest.
The genus too of priests, as the law says, knows how gifts should be offered by us through sacrifices to the gods, agreeably to them;
and how we should request of them by prayer the possession of good things.
Now both these are parts of the ministering art.[30.]
Soc.jun.
So it appears.
Guest.
Now then we seem to me to touch, as it were, upon some foot-print of the object to which we are on the road.
For the figure of priests and prophets is replete with pru- dence, and obtains a reputation for respect through the great­ ness of the matters in their hands;
so that in Egypt it is not permitted for a king to govern without the sacerdotal science;
and should any one previously of another genus of men be­ come by violence (the king), he is afterwards compelled to be initiated in the mysteries of this genus.45
Further still among the Greeks, one may find in many places that the greatest sacrifices relating to matters of this kind are imposed upon the greatest offices;
and what I assert is shown particularly among you.
For to him who is chosen by lot the king here,46 they say that of all the ancient sacrifices, those held in the highest veneration and most peculiar to the country are assigned.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
We must then consider these kings chosen by lot, together with the priests, and their ministers, and a certain other very numerous crowd, which has just now become manifest to us, apart from those previously mentioned.
Soc. jun.
Of whom are you speaking ?
Guest.
Of certain very strange persons.
Soc. jun.
Why so ?
Guest.
As I was just now speculating, their genus appeared to me to be all kinds.
47For many men resemble lions and centaurs, and other things of this kind;
and very many are similar to satyrs, and to weak and versatile wild beasts.
They likewise rapidly change their forms and their power into each other.
47
And indeed, Socrates, I appear to myself to have just now perceived these men for the first time.
Soc. jun.
Speak;
for you seem to see something strange.
Guest.
I do;
for what is strange is the result of ignorance in the case of all.
48
And I myself just now suffered the very same thing:
for I was suddenly involved in doubt on seeing the dancing-troop 49 relating to state affairs.
Soc. jun.
Of what kind?
Guest.
The greatest wizard of all the wise, 50 and the most skilled in this art;
who must be separated from the really ex­ isting statesmen and kings, although it is very difficult so to separate him, if we are about to see clearly the object of our search.
Soc. jun.
We must not give up this, at least.
Guest.
Not, indeed, according to my opinion:
but tell me this.
Guest.
Is not a monarchy one of the forms of state-rule ?
Soc. jun.
It is.
Guest.
And after a monarchy one would, I think, speak of an oligarchy.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
But is not the rule of the many called by the name of a democracy, a third form of state-polity ?Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Do not these being three become after a manner five, by two producing from themselves two other names in addi­ tion to their own ?Soc.jun.
What ?
Guest.
They who look to the violent and the voluntary, to poverty and wealth, to law and lawlessness, which take place in them, give a twofold division to each one of the two, and call monarchy, as exhibiting two species, by two names, one tyranny, the other royalty.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
But the state ever governed by a few, (we call) an aristocracy and an oligarchy.
Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But of a democracy, whether the people govern the rich violently, or with their consent, and whether they strictly guard the laws or not, no one is ever accustomed to change the name at all.
Soc. jun.
True.
Guest.
What then ?
Do we think that any one of these state-polities is right, thus bounded by these definitions, such as by one, and a few, and a many, and by wealth and poverty, by the violent and the voluntary, 51 and happening to exist51 by statutes and without laws ?
Soc. jun.
What should hinder?
Guest.
Consider more attentively, following me by this road.Soc.jun.
What road?
Guest.
Shall we abide by what was asserted at first, or shall we dissent from it ?
Soc. jun.
To what assertion are you alluding ?
Guest.
I think we said that a regal government was one of the sciences.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
Yet not of those taken together as a whole;
but we selected it from the other sciences, as something judicial and presiding.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
And from the presiding science (we selected) one part, as belonging to inanimate acts, and the other as belong­ ing to animals.
And dividing after this fashion, we have arrived thus far, not forgetful of science, but unable to de­ termine with sufficient accuracy what science is.Soc.jun.
You say rightly.
Guest.
Do we then understand this very thing, that the definition must be respecting them, 52 not (as regards) the few, nor the many, nor the voluntary or involuntary, nor poverty or wealth, but (as regards) a certain science, if we follow what has been formerly detailed ?[32.]
Soc.jun.
It is impossible, indeed, not to do this.
Guest.
We must of necessity then consider now this;
in which of these does the science respecting the government of men happen to exist, being nearly 53the greatest and most difficult53 to obtain.
For it is requisite to inspect it, that we may perceive who are the parties we must take away from a prudent king, who lay claim to be statesmen, and persuade the multitude (of it), and yet are so not at all.
Soc.jun.
We must do so, as the reasoning has previously told us.
Guest.
Does it then appear to you that the mass in a city is able to acquire this science ?Soc.jun.
How can they?
Guest.
But in a city of a thousand men, is it possible for a hundred, or even fifty, to acquire it sufficiently ?
Soc. jun.
It would be then the most easy of all arts.
For we know that among a thousand men there could not be found so many tip-top draught-players as compared with those in the rest of Greece, much less kings.
For, according to our former reasoning, we must call him, who possesses the science of a king, whether he governs or not, a regal character.
Guest.
You have very properly reminded me.
And I think it follows from this, that a right government, when it exists rightly, ought to be investigated as about one person,54 or two, or54 altogether about a few.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
And we must hold, as we think now, that these exercise rule according to a certain art, whether they govern the willing or the unwilling, whether according to statutes or without statutes, and whether they are rich or poor.
For we have considered those as not the less physicians, whether they cure us, willing or unwilling, by cutting, or burning, or applying any other pain;
and whether according to written rules or not, and whether they are themselves poor or rich.
In all (these cases) we say that they are no less physicians, so long as they stand over (the patient)55 according to art,56 purg­ ing or some other way attenuating (the body), or in causing (it) to increase, and so long as, for the good of the body alone, they bring it from a worse to a better state, and by at­ tending preserve each57 (body) attended to.
After this man­ ner, and in no other, as I think, we will lay down that the definition of the medicinal or any other rule is rightly made.
Soc.jun.
And very much so.[33.]
Guest.
It is necessary then, as it seems, that of poli­ ties that must be pre-eminently correct, and the only polity, in which the governors are found to possess science truly, and not in appearance merely;
whether they rule according to laws or without laws, over the willing or the unwilling, and are themselves poor or rich.
For not one of these things must we consider at all, as regards any rectitude (of government).
Soc.jun. Beautifully (said).
IGuest.
And whether they purge the state to its good, by putting to death or banishing certain persons;
or by sending out colonies some where, like a swarm of bees, they reduce it to a less size;
or whether by introducing some others from abroad they make citizens of them, and thus increase its size, so long as by making use of science and justice, they preserve it, and cause it to the utmost of their power to pass from a worse condition to a better one, then, and according to such limits, must we speak of a polity as alone rightly existing.
But we must say that such others, as we have mentioned, are not genuine, nor do they in reality exist;
58but that those, which we call well- regulated, imitate this for the better, the others for the worse.
58Soc. jun.
The other points, 0 guest, appear to have been stated with moderation:
but that it is requisite59 to govern without laws, has been stated as a thing rather harsh to hear.
Guest.
You have anticipated me a little, Socrates, by your question.
For I was about to ask you, whether you admit all these points, or whether you find any difficulty in any matter that has been stated.
It is however evident, that we now wish to discuss the point respecting the rectitude of those, who govern without laws.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
After a certain manner it is evident that legislation is a part of the science of a king:
but it is best, not for the laws to prevail,60 but for a man, who has with prudence the power of a king.
Do you know in what way ?
Soc. jun.
In what way do you mean?
Guest.
Because the law cannot, by comprehending that which is the best and most accurately just in all cases, at the same time ordain what is the best.
For the inequalities of men and their actions, and the fact that not a single atom, so to say, of human affairs, enjoys a state of rest, do not permit any art whatever to exhibit in any case any thing simple (without exception) respecting all matters and through all time.
Shall we admit this ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
And yet we see the law tending nearly to this very point;
and, like a certain self-willed and ignorant man, it does not suffer any person to do anything contrary to its own orders, nor to put a question, not even should something new happen to be in some case 61 better as compared with the de­ crce61 it had ordained.
Soc. jun.
True.
For the law does really so, as you have just now said, to each of us.
Guest.
Is it not then impossible for that, which is under all cases simple, to do well in cases which are never at any time simple ?
Soc. jun.
It appears so nearly.[34.]
Guest.
Why then is it necessary to lay down laws ?
since law is not a thing of the greatest rectitude.
Of this we must inquire the cause.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
Are there not then amongst us, as in other cities likewise, certain exercises of men collected together for the sake of competition relating to running, or something else ?
Soc. jun.
Yes.
There are very many.
Guest.
Come then, let us again recall to our memory the orders of those, who practise scientifically exercises in meet­ ings 62 of this kind.
Soc. jun.
What is this ?
63Guest.
They do not conceive it is requisite to be very fine in ordering, according to each individual, what is suited to the body of each;
but think more stupidly,64 that they ought to make their arrangements of what benefits the body, suited to the majority of circumstances and persons.
Soc. jun.
Excellent.
Guest.
On which account assigning now65 equal labours to persons collected together, they urge them on together, and stop them together in the race, and wrestling, and all the labours of the body.
Soc. jun.
Such is the fact.
Guest.
Let us hold then, that the legislator who would pre­ side over his herds66 in matters of justice, and their contracts with each other, will never be sufficient for all collectively, by accurately enjoining upon each individual what is fitting.
Soc. jun.
This is likely.
Guest.
But I think he will establish laws suited to the majority of persons and circumstances, and somehow thus in a more stupid way for each, delivering them in writings, and in an unwritten (form),67 and legislating according to the customs of the country.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
Right indeed.
For how, Socrates, can any one be so all-sufficient as, by sitting near 68 through the whole of life, to enjoin accurately what is adapted to each ?
Since, although any one soever of those who possess the science of a king' could, I think, do this, he would scarcely impose on himself impediments, by writing down the so-called laws.
Soc.jun.
(So it appears,) 0 guest, from what has been now said.
Guest.
And still more, 0 thou best one, from what will be said.
Soc. jun.
What is that?
Guest.
Of this kind.
For let us thus say to ourselves.
Would not a physician, or any teacher of gymnastics, being about to travel, and to be absent as he fancied from those under his care for a long time, and thinking that those en­ gaged in exercises, or sick, would not remember his precepts, be willing to write something to refresh their memory ?
Or how (would he act) ?
Soc. jun.
In this way.
Guest.
But what, if the physician, having been abroad a less time than he expected, should come back, would he not dare to suggest certain other things besides those contained in his writings, other circumstances occurring more favourable for the sick, through winds, or any thing else of those that are wont to take place from Zeus (the air), contrary to expecta­ tion ?
Would he think that he ought to persevere in not going out of his old injunctions, and neither himself order other things, nor dare to do to the sick man things different from what had been written, as if these were medicinal and salubri­ ous, but those of a different kind noxious, and not according to art ?
Or rather, would not every thing of this kind, occur­ ring according to science and true art, in all matters become altogether the greatest ridicule of such injunctions?
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
But shall not he, who writes down what is just and unjust, beautiful and base, good and evil, and who establishes unwritten laws for the herds of human beings who live in cities, in each69 according to the laws of those who have written them,-whether he comes himself (back)70 after hav­ ing written (laws) contrary to art, or some other like him, be permitted to enjoin things different from these ?
Or, would not this interdiction appear to be in reality no less ridiculous than the former ?
Soc. jun.
How not?[35.]
Guest.
Do you know then the language spoken by the multitude respecting such a thing ?Soc.jun.
I have it not at present in my mind.
Guest.
And yet it is very specious.
For they say that, if any one knows of laws better than those of their ancestors, such a person should, after persuading his own state, become a legislator;
otherwise not.
Soc. jun.
Do they not then (say) rightly ?
Guest.
Perhaps so.
But if any one should, not by persua­ sion, force on the better, what would be the name of this violence ?
Do not however (say) a word, but previously re­ specting the former.
Soc. jun.
What do you mean ?
Guest.
Should some one, not by persuading a person under a physician, but by possessing his art correctly, compel a boy, or a man, or a woman, contrary to prescriptions, to do that which is better, what will be the name of this violence ?
Ought it not to be called rather any thing than some71 mis­ chievous transgression of art ?
And is it not for us to say, that every thing (has happened 72) to the compelled person, rather than that he has suffered any thing mischievous and without art from the compelling physicians ?
Soc. jun.
You speak most true.
Guest.
But what is that error called by us, which is con­ trary to the statesman's art ?
Must it not be the base, evil, and unjust?
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Of those, who have been forced to act contrary to the written precepts, and the customs of the country, more justly, better, and more beautifully than before, come, (tell me,) 73 (can any one), unless he is about to be the most ridiculous of all men, (pronounce) a disapprobation of such violence done to such persons?
Must it not be said 73 rather by him on each occasion, that they, who have been forced, have suffered at the hands of the forcing party every thing, except what is base, unjust, and evil ?
Soc. jun.
You speak most true.
Guest.
But if he who forces is rich, will the acts done forcibly by him be just, but, if he is poor, unjust?
Or, whether a person persuades or does not persuade, (whether) rich or poor, and (whether) according or contrary to written statutes, he does what is useful, must this be the definition the most true on all sides of the correct administration of a state, by which74 a wise and good man will (well) administer the interests of those under his charge;
just as a pilot watches over whatever happens to conduce to the welfare of the vessel and crew;
and not by laying down written orders, but by making his skill a law, he preserves his fellow-sailors.
And thus, 75[after this very same manner,]75 will an upright polity be produced by those who are able to govern thus, by ex­ hibiting a strength of skill superior to the laws.
And indeed in the case of prudent rulers there will be no error, let them do every thing;
as long as they observe this one great maxim, to distribute ever with intellect and art to those in the state what is the most j ust, to keep them such as they are, and to finish by rendering them, as far as possible, better instead of worse.
Soc. jun.
It is not possible to say the contrary to what has been now asserted.
Guest.
Nor yet against those to say even a word.[36.]
Soc. jun.
Of what are you speaking ?
Guest.
That no mob of any persons whatever can receive this kind of science, and be able to administer with intellect a state, but that we must seek for a correct polity amongst a small number, and a few, and one person ;
76 and that we must lay down other polities as imitations, as we observed a little before, some for the better, and some for the worse.
Soc. jun.
How and why say you this ?
For I did not under­ stand just now forsooth77 the remark respecting imitations.
Guest.
Truly it were not a stupid act for a person, after starting an argument of this kind, to lay it down there,78 and not, by going through it, to show the error which at present exists about it.
Soc. jun.
What error ?
Guest.
It is meet to search into a thing of such a kind as 79 is not very usual, nor easy to perceive;
but at the same time we must endeavour to apprehend it.
For, come, since the polity of which we have spoken is the only correct one, you know that other polities ought to be thus80 preserved, while they use the institutions of this, and do what was just now praised, though it is not most right ?
Soc. jun.
What is that ?
Guest.
That no one of those in the city dare to do any thing contrary to the laws ;
and that he who dares, shall pay the forfeit by death, and all the extreme of punishments.
81
This too is most right and beautiful, as a second thing;
82 after that some one shall have first changed the just now said.
82
But in what manner that, which we have called second, ex­ ists, let us proceed to state.
Shall we not ?
Soc. jun.
By all means.[37.]
Guest.
Let us then again return to the images, to which it is ever necessary to assimilate kingly rulers.
Soc. jun.
Of what kind ?
Guest.
The noble-minded pilot, and 83 the physician, who is of equal worth with many others.83
Let us then, after moulding from these (two) a certain figure, contemplate it.
Soc. jun.
Of what kind ?
Guest.
Such a one, as if we all conceived that we are suf­ fering the most dreadful things from them.
For such of us as either of them wish to save, they do equally save;
84 and such as they wish to injure, they injure by cutting and burn­ ing, at the same time ordering us to bring to them the means of expense, as a tribute, of which they spend on the sick little or even nothing,85 but they and their domestics make use of the rest.
And lastly, receiving money (as) wages,86 from either the kindred or some enemies of the sick man, they cause him to die.
They too who have the command of a ves­ sel, do ten thousand other things of this kind.
87 For after some plotting, when out at sea, they leave persons deserted, and, committing errors at sea, hurl them into the sea, and do them other mischief.
87
If then, reflecting on these matters, we should enter into some consultation respecting them, (so that)88 we should no longer permit either of those arts to have an absolute control over slaves or the free-born;
but that we should collect together an assembly consisting of ourselves or all the people, or the rich alone;
and that it should be lawful for private individuals, and the rest of the operatives, to bring together their opinions respecting sailing and diseases, as to what manner it is meet to use medicines, and medical in­ struments, for those that are ill;
and moreover, (how to use) both the vessels themselves and nautical instruments for the requirements of vessels in case of danger during the voyage from winds and the sea and the meeting with pirates, and, if requisite, in fighting with long ships89 against others of the like kind;
and that, what shall have been decreed by the mul­ titude on these points, by the advice of physicians and pilots, or of other so unskilled individuals, persons should inscribe in triangular tables91 and pillars, and laying down other un­ written regulations, as the customs of the country, it should be necessary to navigate vessels in all future times according to this method, and to administer remedies to the sick.
Soc. jun.
You have mentioned things really very absurd.
Guest.
Further, that rulers of the people should be ap­ pointed yearly, whoever may be chosen by lot from the rich or from all the people ;
and that the rulers so appointed should rule according to the written regulations, like pilots over vessels and physicians over the sick.
Soc. jun.
These things are still more harsh.[38.]
Guest.
Let us see now after this what follows.
For when the year of each governor shall have expired, it will be necessary to appoint92 tribunals of persons, taken either by a selection from the rich or from all the people by lot, and to bring the rulers before them and to pass their accounts, and for any one to accuse them for not having acted, during his year, the pilot, according to the written regulations, nor according to the old customs of their forefathers;
and for the very same things to take place in the case of those healing the sick;
and that whoever of them should be convicted, certain persons should fix what the party must suffer (in person) or pay (in purse).
Soc. jun.
Would not he, who is ready of his own accord to be a ruler under such circumstances, most justly suffer (in person) and pay (in purse) ?
Guest.
Further still, it will be necessary to make a law on all these points, that, if any one be proved to be seeking out the art relating to piloting and ships in general, or to health, and the truth of the physician's theory about winds, heat and cold, contrary to the written regulations,93 or devising94 any thing whatever about affairs of this kind, he shall, in the first place, be called neither as one skilled in physicking or piloting, but a talker of matters on high, or some babbler;
and that, in the next place, it shall be lawful for any one to write down an indictment against him for lawlessness,95 and to bring him before some court of justice, as corrupting the younger,96 and persuading the silly to.
put their hands to the arts of a pilot and a physician not according to the laws, and to rule self-willed over vessels and the sick;
and that if any one shall'be found persuading either young or old men, contrary to the laws, and the written regulations, (it shall be lawful) to punish him with the extreme (of punishments).
For no one97 ought to be wiser than the laws;
nor on the other hand,98 should any one be ignorant of the arts of medicine and of healing, nor of piloting and shipping, (according to) the written regulations and the customs laid down of the country;
for he who wishes may learn.
If then, Socrates, this should take place about the sciences we mentioned, and we should look into any portion of the general's art, and the whole of any kind of hunting, and of painting, or of imitation in general, and carpentry, and the formation in general of instruments of any kind, and of agriculture, and the art relating to plants in general;
or, again, into the care of breeding horses, according to written regulations,99 and herds of cattle of every kind, and prophecy, and all the portion that the ministering art embraces, the playing at games of dice, the whole of arithmetic, (whe­ ther) simple or (relating to) a plane, either in depth, or swift­ ness;
100 1(if) respecting all these things (it were) so done, what would appear produced according to written regulations, and not according to art?
1Soc. jun.
It is evident that all arts would be entirely sub­ verted, nor would they exist again, through such a law for­ bidding one to investigate.
So that life, which is now difficult, would at that time become utterly unable to be endured.[39.]
Guest.
But what (will you say) to this ?
If we should compel each of the above-mentioned to take place according to written regulations, and should appoint as the guardian of these statutes a man either chosen by suffrage, or chance, but who, giving no thought to them, either for the sake of a certain gain, or private pleasure, should endeavour, although knowing nothing, to act contrary to these statutes, would not this be a still greater evil than the former ?
Soc. jun.
Most truly so.
Guest.
For he, who should dare to act contrary to those laws, which have been laid down after much experience, (or) through certain advisers recommending each in a pleasant manner, and persuading the people to pass them, will commit an error many-fold greater than an error,2 and subvert every process much more than written statutes.
Soc. jun.
How is he not about (to do so) ?
Guest.
Hence there is a second sailing, as is said, for those that establish laws and statutes respecting any thing what­ ever, that is, not to suffer any one person, or the multitude, to do any thing of any kind at any time contrary to them.
Soc. jun.
Right.
Guest.
Will not these statutes then, written by men intel­ ligent as far as their power permits, be imitations of the truth of each of these ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
And yet, if we remember, we said that the man, who is in reality a statesman, would, being intelligent, do many things from art, in reference to his own course of action, without giving a thought to statutes, when other things seem to him better than what had been written by himself and enjoined upon some persons absent.
Soc. jun.
We did say so.
Guest.
Would not then any single man whatever, or any people whatever, by whom laws happen to be laid down, act in the same way as that true (statesman), should they endea­ vour to do to the utmost of their power contrary to them3 ( the laws) what is something different and better ?Soc.jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
If then they should without knowledge act in this manner, would they not attempt to imitate what is true ?
and yet they would imitate all badly;
but if with art, this is no longer an imitation, but is the very truth itself.
Soc. jun.
Altogether so..
Guest.
And yet it was before laid down as a thing acknow­ ledged by us, that the mob is incapable of receiving any art whatever.
Soc. jun.
It was so laid down.
Guest.
If then there is a certain kingly art, the mob of the rich, and the whole of the people, could never receive this science of the statesman.
Soc. jun.
For how can they ?
Guest.
It is requisite then, as it seems, that such-like polities, if they are about to imitate correctly, to the best of their power, the true polity under a single person ruling with art, must never, 4 the laws having been laid down by them,4 do any thing contrary to the written statutes and customs of the country.
Soc. jun.
You speak most beautifully.
Guest.
When therefore the rich imitate this polity, we then denominate such a polity an aristocracy;
but when they give no thought to the laws, an oligarchy.
Soc. jun.
So it nearly seems.
Guest.
And again, when one man rules according to the laws, imitating the person endued with science, we call him a king, not distinguishing by name the person ruling alone with science, or with opinion according to the laws.
Soc.jun.
We nearly appear to do so.
Guest.
If then a person possessing in reality science rules alone, he is called altogether by the same name, a king, and no other will be mentioned in addition:
through which 5 the five names of the polities just now mentioned become only one.
Soc. jun.
So it appears.
Guest.
But when one man rules neither according to the laws nor the customs of the country, but pretends, as the person possessing science, that the best is to be done, contrary to the written statutes, and there exist a certain desire and ignorance as the leaders of this imitation, must we not call each man of this kind a tyrant ?[40.]
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
Thus then we say has been produced a tyrant, a king, an oligarchy, an aristocracy, and a democracy, from mankind indignantly bearing with such a single monarch, and not be­ lieving that any one would ever be worthy of such an office, so as to be both willing and able to rule with virtue and science, and to distribute properly to all persons things just and holy;
6 but (disposed) to maim, and kill, and maltreat 7 whomsoever he might wish:
yet, if such a person should arise, as we have mentioned, he would be beloved and live at home happily,8 guiding throughout, like a pilot, alone a polity accurately correct.
Soc.jun.
How not?
Guest.
But now, as we truly say, since there is no such -king produced in states, as is produced by nature in a swarm of bees, excelling straightway alone in body and soul, we must, as it seems, come together and write down statutes, treading in the footsteps of a polity the most true.
Soc.jun.
It nearly appears so.
Guest.
And do we wonder then, Socrates, that in such- like polities evils, such as do happen, and will happen, are pro­ duced, when the foundation placed under them (exists) by statutes and customs, 9 and not with the foundation of science, which performs its actions in a different way than what a polity does, which, making use of imprudence, will be evident to every one, that it will destroy every thing produced by that (imprudence).
9
Or ought we not to wonder rather at this, how strong a thing a city naturally is ?
For, though cities have for time without end been suffering thus, yet some of them are still remaining, and are not overturned.
Many however sometimes, like sinking10 vessels, are perishing, have perished, and will perish,11 through the incorrect conduct of the pilots and sailors,12 who, having obtained the greatest ignorance re­ specting the greatest concerns, do still, although they know nothing about state affairs, think they have obtained this knowledge the most clearly of all.[41.]
Soc.jun.
Most true.
Guest.
Which then of these incorrect polities, where all are full of difficulties, is the least difficult to live in, and which the most oppressive, it is meet for us to look into a little;
although it is what is called a by-deed13 as regards our present inquiry;
yet, perhaps, on the whole, we all of us do all things for the sake of a thing of this kind.
14Soc. jun.
It is meet.
How not ?
Guest.
Of three things then, say that the same is remark­ ably difficult, and at the same time most easy.- Soc. jun.
How say you ?
Guest.
Not otherwise than, as I said before, that a mon­ archy, the government of a few, and of many, are those three polities mentioned by us at the commencement of the dis­ course, which has now flowed upon us.
Soc. jun.
They were.
Guest.
Bisecting then each of these, we shall produce six, separating from these the correct polity, as a seventh.
Soc. jun.
How so?
Guest.
Out of monarchy, there came, we said, the regal and the tyrannic;
and out of that (composed) not of the many, the well-omened aristocracy and oligarchy.
But out of that (composed) of the many, we then laid it down under the name of a simple democracy;
but we must now lay it down as two-fold.
Soc. jun.
How so ?
And after what manner do we make this division ?
Guest.
Not at all different from the others;
even although the name of this is now two-fold.
But to govern according to the laws, and contrary to them, is common both to this and the rest.
15Soc. jun.
It is so.
Guest.
Then indeed, when we were seeking a correct polity, this bisection was of no use, as we have shown above;
but since we have separated it from the others, and have con­ sidered the others as necessary, the being contrary or accord­ in- to law causes a bisection in each of these.
16Soc. jun.
So it appears from what has now been said.
Guest.
A monarchy then, yoked to correct writings, which we call laws, is the best of all the six polities;
but when it is without law, it is grievous, and most burthensome to live under.
Soc. jun.
It nearly appears so.
Guest.
But the polity of the not-many we have considered as a medium between both, as a few is a medium between one and many;
but on the other hand, the polity of the many, as being weak in all things, and unable, as compared with the others, to do any thing great, either for good or evil, through the offices in this polity being divided into small parts amongst many.
Hence, of all the polities acting according to law, this is the worst, but the best of all such as act contrary to law.
And where all are intemperate, it is the best to live in a democracy;
but where all are temperate, this polity is the worst to live in.
In the first polity is the first and best con­ dition (of life), with the exception of the seventh;
for we must separate this from all the other polities, as a god from men.
Soc. jun.
These things appear thus 17 to be produced 17 and happen;
and that must be done, which you mention.
Guest.
Ought we not then to take away the sharers in all these polities, with the exception of the scientific one, as being not truly statesman-like but seditious-like;
and as presiding over the greatest resemblances, and being such themselves;
and, as they are the greatest mimics and enchanters, to be called18 too the greatest sophists of sophists ?
Soc. jun.
This appellation seems nearly to be retorted most correctly on those called statesmen.
Guest.
Be it so.
This indeed is, as it were, a drama for us;
just as it was lately said, that we saw a certain dancing-troop of Centaurs and Satyrs, which was to be separated from the statesman's art;
and now this separation has been with so much difficulty effected.
Soc. jun.
So it appears.
Guest.
But another thing remains, still more difficult than this, through its being more allied to the kingly genus, and at the same time more difficult to understand.
And we ap- pear to me to be affected in a manner similar to those that wash gold.
Soc.jun.
How so?
Guest.
Those workmen first of all separate earth, stones, and many other things;
but after this there are left sub­ stances, allied to gold, mixed together and of value, and to be separated only by fire, such as brass and silver, and some­ times a diamond;
which19 being with difficulty separated by the experiments of fusion (in the crucible), suffer us to see itself by itself that which is called pure gold.
Soc.jun.
It is said that such things are so done.[42.]
Guest.
After the same manner then it seems that things different from, and such as are foreign and not friendly to, the statesman's science, have been separated by us;
but there have been left such as are of value and allied to it.
Now of these are the military and judicial arts, and that oratory, which has a share of the kingly science, and does, by persuading men to do justice, conjointly regulate affairs in states;
by separating (all) of which in a certain manner, most easily will a person show naked and alone by itself the charac­ ter of which we are now in search.
Soc.jun.
It is evident that we should endeavour to do this in some way.
Guest.
As far as experiment goes, it will be evident.
But let us endeavour to show it by means of music.
Tell me, then-Soc.jun.
What?
Guest.
Have we any teaching of music, and universally of the sciences, relating to handicraft trades ?
Soc. jun.
We have.
Guest.
But what, shall we say that there is this too, a cer­ tain science respecting those very things, 20( which teaches us)20 whether we ought to learn any one of them whatever or not ?
Or how shall we say ?Soc.jun.
"We will say that there is?
Guest.
Shall we not then confess, that this is different from the others ?
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
But whether must we say that not one of them ought to rule over the other ?
or the others over this ?
or that this, as a guardian, ought to rule over all the others ?Soc.jun.
That this science (ought to rule)21 over those;
(which teaches)21 whether it is requisite to learn, or not.
Guest.
You tell us then, that it ought to.
rule over both the taught and the teaching.
Soc.jun.
Very much so.
Guest.
And that the science (which decides)22 whether it is requisite to persuade or not, should rule over that which is able to persuade ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
To what science then shall we attribute that, which persuades the multitude and the crowd, through fable-talk­ ing,23 but not through teaching ?
Soc. jun.
I think it is evident that this is to be attributed to the science of the orator.
Guest.
But on what science, on the other hand, shall we impose this, (to decide)24 whether it is meet to do any thing whatever to any persons by persuasion, or violence, or to abstain 25 entirely.
Soc. jun.
To that, which rules over the arts of persuasion and discourse.
Guest.
But this, as I think, will not be any other than the power of the statesman.
Soc. jun.
You have spoken most beautifully.
Guest.
Thus then the science of the orator appears to have been very rapidly separated from that of the statesman, as being another species, but subservient to this.
Soc. jun. Yes.[43.]
Guest.
But what on the other hand must we con­ ceive respecting this power ?
Soc. jun.
What power?
Guest. (Respecting) that, by which we are to war with each of those against whom we may have chosen to war.
Whether shall we say that this power is without art or with art ?
Soc. jun.
And how can we conceive that power to be with­ out art, which the general's art and all warlike operations put into practice ?
Guest.
But must we consider that power, which is able and skilful in deliberating, whether we ought to engage in war, or separate peaceably, as different from this, or the same with it ?Soc.jun.
To those following26 the preceding (reasoning) it is of necessity different.
Guest.
Shall we not, then, assert that this (the art of de­ liberation) rules over that (which carries on war), if we understand in a manner similar to what has been advanced before ?
Soc. jun.
So I say.
Guest.
What power then shall we endeavour to show as the mistress of the whole art of war, so terrible and mighty, except the truly kingly science ?
Soc. jun.
None other.
Guest.
We must not then lay down the science of general­ ship as that of the statesman, of which the former is the min­ istering assistant.
Soc. jun.
It is not reasonable.
Guest.
But come, let us contemplate the power of judges, who judge rightly.
Soc. jun.
By all means.
Guest.
Is it then capable of doing any thing more than merely judging respecting compacts, when, having received from a king the lawgiver, whatever has been laid down as legal, and looking both to those, and to what has been ordained to be just and unjust, it exhibits its own peculiar virtue, of never being overcome by certain bribes, or fear, or pity, or any other27 hatred, or love, so as to be willing to settle mutual accusa­ tions contrary to the ordonnance of the legislator.
Soc. jun.
The employment of this power is nearly nothing else,28 than what you have mentioned.
Guest.
We find then, that the strength of judges is not kingly, but the guardianship of the laws, and ministering to the kingly science.
Soc.jun.
It appears so.
Guest.
This also must be understood by him, who looks into all the aforesaid sciences, that the statesman's science has not appeared to be one of them.
For it is not meet for the truly kingly science to act itself, but to rule over those able to act;
since it knows that the commencement and progress 29 of things of the greatest consequence in states depends on opportunity 29 and the want of it;
but it is the province of the other sciences to do as they are ordered.
Soc. jun.
Right ?
Guest.
Hence, since the sciences which we have just now discussed, neither rule over each other nor themselves, but that each is occupied with a certain proper employment of its own, they have justly obtained according to the.
peculiar­ ity of their actions a peculiar name.
Soc. jun.
So they seem.
Guest.
But we having, rightly comprehended its power under an appellation in common, should, it seems, most justly call that the science of the statesman, which rules over all these and takes care of the laws, and of every thing relating to the state, and weaves all things together most correctly.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.[44.]
Guest.
Are we then willing to go through this science at present, according to the pattern of the weaving art, since all the genera pertaining to a state have become manifest to us ?
Soc. jun.
And very much so.
Guest.
We must then, as it seems, define what is the kingly entwining, and what, after entwining, is the web it produces for us.
Soc. jun.
It is evident.
Guest.
It has become necessary, as it appears, to show forth a thing really difficult.
Soc. jun.
It must however be told by all means.
Guest.
For that a part of virtue differs in a certain man­ ner from a species of virtue, is a point that may be very easily attacked by those, who contend in discourses against the opin­ ions of the many.
Soc. jun.
I do not understand you.
Guest.
(Think) again in this way.30 For I suppose you consider fortitude to be one part of virtue.
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
And that temperance is different indeed from for­ titude, but that this is also a part of what that is likewise.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
On these points then we must dare to unfold a cer­ tain marvellous discourse.
Soc. jun.
Of what kind ?
Guest.
That they have after a certain manner very greatly an enmity with each other, and are of an opposite faction in many of the things that exist.
31Soc. jun.
How say you ?
Guest.
An assertion by no means usual.
For all the parts of virtue are said to be friendly to each other.
32Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
Let us consider then, applying very closely our mind, whether this is so without exception,33 or whether rather any part of them differs from their kindred.
Soc. jun.
Inform me how we are to consider.
Guest.
In all such things as we call beautiful, it is proper to investigate, but we refer them to two species contrary to each other.
35Soc. jun.
Speak more clearly.
Guest.
Of acuteness then and swiftness, either in bodies or mind, or of the throwing out the voice, when such things exist themselves or in their resemblances, such as music and paint­ in- by imitating exhibit, have you ever been a praiser yourself, or, being not present, have you heard another person prais­ ing any one of these'things ?
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
Do you likewise remember after what manner they do this in each of these cases ?
Soc. jun.
By no means.
Guest.
Shall I then be able to point out to you through words, as I have it in my mind ?Soc.jun.
Why not?
Guest.
You seem to think a thing of this kind easy.
Let us consider it then in genera somewhat contrary.
For in many actions, and oftentimes on each occasion,38 when we admire the swiftness, vehemence, and acuteness of thought, body, or voice, we praise them, and at the same time employ one of the appellations of manliness.
Soc.jun.
How so?
Guest.
We say it is acute and manly, swift and manly, and in a similar manner vehement:
39 and, universally, by applying the name which I say is common to all these natural qualities, we praise them.
Soc. jun.
Yes.
Guest.
But what, have we not often praised in many ac­ tions 40the species of quiet production?40Soc.jun.
And very much so.
Guest.
Do we not then, in saying the contrary to what (we did) about them, say this?41Soc.jun.
How so?
Guest.
As42 we speak on each occasion of things done quietly and moderately as regards the mind, and admire them;
and as regards actions, slowly and softly;
and further as re­ spects voice, smoothly and gravely, and of all rhythmical movement, and the whole of music which makes use of slow­ ness opportunely, do we not assign to all these the appellation of the moderate, and not of the manly ?
Soc. jun.
Most assuredly.
Guest.
But when, on the other hand, both these take place unseasonably,43 we then in turn blame each of them by their names, distributing (them) back to their opposites.
44Soc. jun.
How so ?
Guest.
By calling things that are and seem (to be) more acute, and quick, and harsh than is seasonable, by the names of insolent and mad;
but those that are more slow and soft, (by the names of) timid and slothful.
And for the most part nearly we find that these, and the moderate and manly natures, having like hostile species obtained by lot their respective stations45 opposite to each other, never mingle together in actions about things of this kind;
and still further we shall see, if we pursue (the inquiry) diligently,46 that they, who possess these in their souls, are at variance with each other.[45.]
Soc. jun.
Where do you say?
Guest.
In all the points which we have just now mentioned, and, it is likely, in many others.
For I think that, on ac­ count of their alliance with each,47 by praising some things as their own property, but blaming the things of those who differ, as being foreign, they stand in great enmity with each other and on account of many things.
Soc. jun.
They nearly appear to do so.
Guest.
This difference then between these species is a kind of sport.
But a disease the most baneful of all others hap­ pens to states about things of the greatest consequence.
Soc. jun.
About what things are you speaking ?
Guest.
About the whole form of living, as it is reasonable I should.
For they who are pre-eminently well-ordered are always prepared to live a quiet life, themselves by themselves, managing only48 their own concerns, and so associating with all at home, and being ready, in like manner, to be at peace, after a certain fashion, with foreign states;
and through this desire, more unseasonable than is fitting, when they are doing that which they wish, they become unconsciously unwar­ like, and affect the young men in a similar manner, and become ever the prey of parties attacking ;
of whom in not many years themselves, their children, and the whole city, often unconsciously, instead of being free, become the slaves.
Soc.jun.
You speak of a severe and terrible suffering.
Guest.
But what are they, who incline more to manliness ?
Do they not incite their own cities ever to some warfare, through a desire more vehement than is becoming of such a kind of life;
and thus standing in hostile array against many and powerful (nations), either entirely destroy their own country, or place it in slavery under the power of their foes ?
Soc. jun.
This too is the case.
Guest.
How then shall we not say, that in these cases both these genera have ever against each other the greatest enmity and array ?49Soc.jun.
It can never be that we should say no.
Guest.
Have we not then found out, what we were con­ sidering at the beginning, that certain parts of virtue differ not a little from each other naturally, and that they likewise cause those, who possess them, to do the same ?Soc.jun.
They nearly appear (to do so).
Guest.
Let us handle again this too.
Guest.
Whether any one of the sciences, that bring things together, does compose any act of its works,50 although it should be the vilest, willingly from things evil and useful?
Or docs every science always reject things evil to the utmost of its power, and receive such as are apt and useful ?
and that from these, both similar and dissimilar, it does, by collecting all into one, fabricate one certain power and form ?Soc.jun.
How not?
Guest.
The statesman's science, when it really exists ac­ cording to nature, will never willingly form a state composed of good and bad men;
but it is very evident, that it will first examine by means of play;
51 and, after the examination, it will hand over to such as are able to instruct and to minister to this very purpose, itself commanding and presiding, just as the weaving art presides over the wool-combers, 52and those who prepare the rest of the materials for weaving, and fol­ lowing them up, gives its orders and stands over them, point­ ing out to each to complete their work, such as it conceives to be fitted for its own putting together.
52Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
In the very same way the kingly science appears to me to keep to itself the power of the presiding art, and not to permit all, who instruct and rear up according to law, to practise aught, except what any one would, by working out a manner suited to its own temperament, effect;
and this alone it ex­ horts them to teach;
but those who are unable to communicate a manner manly and moderate, and whatever else tends to virtue, and through the force of a depraved nature are im­ pelled53 to ungodliness, and insolence, and injustice, it casts out, punishing them with death and exile and the greatest of dishonours.
Soc. jun.
This is said to be the case.
Guest.
But those who wallow in ignorance and have a very abject spirit, it yokes to the race of slaves.
Soc. jun.
Most right.
Guest.
With respect to the rest however, whose natures meeting with instruction are sufficient to reach 54 to what is high-minded, and to receive through art a commingling with each other, of these it considers such, as incline more to man­ liness, to have a firmness of conduct like the strong thread in the web;
55 but such (as incline) more to a well-ordered con - duct (it considers) as making use (of a thread) supple and soft, and, according to the simile (from weaving), suited to a thinner stuff;
55 and it endeavours to bind and weave together the natures inclining in a contrary direction from each other in some such manner-Soc. jun.
In what manner?
Guest. 56
In the first place, according to the alliance having fitted together the eternal part of their soul with a divine bond;
and after that the divine (portion) that produces life with human—56[47.]
Soc.jun.
Why again have you said this ?
Guest.
When an opinion really true exists with firmness in the soul, respecting the beautiful, and just, and good, and the contraries to these, I say that a god-like (opinion) is produced in a divine genus.
57Soc. jun.
It is proper it should.
Guest.
Do we not know that it befits the statesman and a good legislator alone to be able, with the discipline of the kingly science, to effect this very thing in those who take properly a share in instruction, and whom we have just now mentioned ?
Soc. jun.
This is reasonable.
Guest.
But the person, Socrates, who cannot accomplish a thing of this kind, we must by no means call by the names now sought for.Soc.jun.
Most right.
Guest.
What then ?
Is not a manly soul, when it lays hold of a truth of this kind, rendered mild ?
and would it not be willing in the highest degree to partake of things just?
But not sharing it, will it not incline rather to a certain savage nature ?Soc.jun.
How not?
Guest.
But what, does not that, which is a part of a well- ordered nature, after receiving these opinions, become truly moderate and prudent, at least in a polity ?
But when it has not partaken of the things we are speaking of, does it not ob­ tain most justly some disgraceful reputation for stupidity?
Soc. jun.
Entirely so.
Guest.
Must we not say that this entwining and binding together of the evil with themselves, and of the good with the evil, can never become stable, and that no science will ever employ it with any serious care on such as these ?
Soc. jun.
For how can it?
Guest.
But that in those alone, who have been born with noble manners from the first, and educated according to nature, this (bond) is naturally implanted through the laws ?
and for these too there is a remedy through art;
and, as we said before, that this is the more divine bond of the parts of virtue which are naturally58 dissimilar, and tending to con­ traries ?Soc.jun.
Most true.
Guest.
Since then this divine bond exists, there is scarcely any difficulty in either understanding the other bonds which are human, or for a person understanding to bring them to a completion.
Soc. jun.
How so?
And what are these bonds ?
Guest.
Those of intermarriages and of a communion of children, and those relating to private59 betrothals and espousals.
For the majority are in these matters not properly bound together for the purpose of begetting children.
Soc.jun.
Why?
Guest.
The pursuit of wealth and power on such occasions who would seriously blame, as being worthy of notice ?
60Soc. jun.
It is not.[48.]
Guest.
But it will be more just to speak of those, who make the genera61 the object of their care, should they do any thing not according to propriety.
Soc. jun.
It is at least reasonable.
Guest.
They do not indeed at all act from right reason, but pursue a life easy for the present;
and through their hugging those similar to themselves, and of not loving those that are dissimilar, they give up themselves for the greatest part to an unpleasant feeling.
Soc.jun.
How so?
Guest.
They that are well-ordered seek after manners like their own, and as far as they can marry from amongst such;
and on the other hand send away to them their own daughters to be married.
In the same manner acts the genus that de­ lights in manliness, while going in the pursuit of its own nature ;
whereas it is requisite for both the genera to do en­ tirely the contrary.
Soc.jun.
How, and on what account?
Guest.
Because manliness, having been propagated, un­ mixed for many generations with a temperate nature, is naturally at the beginning blooming with strength, but in the end bursts out altogether into madness.
Soc.jun.
It is likely.
Guest.
On the other hand, a soul very full of modesty, and unmixed with manly boldness, when it has been propagated in this manner for many generations, naturally becomes un­ seasonably sluggish, and at last perfectly mutilated.
Soc. jun.
And this also is likely to happen.
Guest.
I have said that it is not difficult to bind together these bonds,62 the fact being that both genera have one opinion respecting things beautiful and good.
For this is the one and entire work of kingly weaving, never to suffer moderate manners to subsist apart from such as are manly ;
but, placing both in the same shuttle, to bring out from them a web smooth, and, as it is said, well-woven, by means of similar opinions, and honours, and dishonours, and glories,63 and the interchange of pledges,64 and to commit over to these in com­ mon the offices in the state.
Soc. jun.
How?
Guest.
Wherever there happens to be a need of one governor, by choosing a president who possesses both these (manners);
but where (there is need) of more than one, by mingling a portion of both of them.
For the manners of temperate governors are very cautious, just, and conserva­ tive ;
but they are in want of a certain sourness, and a sharp and practical daring.
Soc.jun.
These things also appear so to me.
Guest.
On the other hand, manliness is with respect to justice and caution rather deficient in those virtues;
but it has pre-eminently in actions a daring.
65
It is however im­ possible for all things pertaining to states, both of a private and public nature, to well exist, unless both of these are present.
Soc. jun.
How not ?
Guest.
Let us say66 then that this is the end of the web of the statesman's doing, (so as for him) to weave with straight- weaving the manners of manly and temperate men, when the kingly science shall by bringing together their common life, through a similarity in sentiment and friendship, complete the most magnificent and excellent of all webs, 67 so as to be common,]67 and enveloping all the rest in the state, both slaves and free-men, shall hold them together by this texture, and, as far as it is fitting 68for a state to become prosperous, shall rule and preside over it, deficient68 in that point not one jot.
Soc. jun.
You have brought, 0 guest, most beautifully, on the other hand,69 the characters of the king and statesman to a finish.
PLATO having on various occasions, and especially in the Sophist and Statesman, applied some of the phenomena of language to the illustration of his argument on questions relating to Dialectics, and Moral and Political Philosophy, has in this Dialogue entered more at length on so much of the same subject, as is connected with the origin of words in the case of persons, acts, and things.
To this step he was probably led by finding that the Sophists, whom he every where opposes with reason and ridicule united, and whom he hunted down with all the ardour of a philosophical Nim­ rod, were generally the followers of the school of Parmenides or Heracleitus.
Of these, the former asserted that all the phenomena of existence could be explained on the principle, that all things are ever at rest;
the latter on the contrary principle, that every thing is in motion.
To prove then that both were equally wrong, Plato had recourse to the phenomena of language.
For as they formed a part of things in existence, the supporters of those theories ought to be able to explain, why certain names were given to certain per­ sons, acts, and things.
And so, it would seem, Protagoras did in reality attempt to do in that part of his work under the title of Ἀλήθεια (Truth), which was Περὶ τη̃ς τω̃ν ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος (On the propriety of names), as Stalbaum has suggested;
and so too, I suspect, did Euthyphron, in his philosophical poem called Μου̃σα φιλόσοφος, where the doctrines attributed to Orpheus were developed;
and from whence Proclus probably obtained the quotations from the Orphic poems, to be found in his Commentaries on the Cratylus and Parmenides.
For such was the elasticity of the Greek language, that subjects, apparently the least suited to verse, were treated in a metrical form;
as is shown by the fragments of Empedocles, Par­ menides, and of Epicharmus the philosopher.
But as the reasons, by which the Philosophical Etymologists arrived at their conclusions, were little satisfactory to Plato, he probably thought, that to prove the absurdity of their theories, it was only requisite to carry out their principles to the fullest extent.
He therefore amused himself with bringing forward some proper names, and nouns appellative, and a few verbs, which he pretends to explain on their own principles.
But this is done in a manner so utterly ridiculous, as to exhibit its own refutation on its very face;
but with an air so grave, that Payne Knight said it was difficult to decide whether Plato was in jest or in earnest.
So successfully indeed has the mystification been carried on, that, as stated by Stal­ baum, while Menage and Tiedemann believed Plato to be speaking seriously his real sentiments, Garnier and Tennemann perceived that he was playing his usual part of an ironical philosopher.
For the etymologies are not only at variance with all the well-ascer­ tained principles of the Greek language, but they are supported by arguments one can hardly believe to be other than, as in the case of the Hippias Major, the broadest caricature of those brought for­ ward by the persons, whom it was Plato's intention to ridicule.
To preserve however his assumed character the better, Plato pre­ tends to account for his ignorance of the origin of some words by saying, as probably did some of the Pseudo-philosophical Ety­ mologists of his day, and as their counterparts of the present time do certainly, that to the East we must look for the solution of many difficulties connected with this inquiry;
as if any person, acquainted with all the dead and living languages of the whole world, could arrive at the origin of words, unless he could tell-what, I suspect, Prodicus or some other of the philosophers, whom Plato had in mind, attempted to do-what was the origin of each letter, and why they had a certain form, and how that form was connected with the sound of each, and how they came to follow each other in a certain order.
It was not then without reason that Plato con­ cluded the Dialogue by saying, that the question was one of so intricate a nature, as to require much further consideration;
as it was impossible to prove in all cases that the names of persons, things, and acts were originally given with reference to the in­ herent nature of the objects represented by them, or from the caprice of one person, or the agreement of many.[1.]
ARE you willing then that we should communicate our discourse to Socrates here ?
Crat.
If it seems good to you.
Herm.
Cratylus here, 0 Socrates, says that there is a pro­ priety of appellation naturally subsisting for every thing that exists ;
and that this name is not, what certain persons conven­ tionally call it, while they articulate with a part of their speech ;
but that there is a certain propriety of names, naturally the same both among the Greeks and all Barbarians.
I ask him then whether Cratylus is his true name, or not.
He confesses it is.
What then is the (true name) of Socrates ?
He replies, So­ crates.
In the case of all other persons then, said I, is not that the name of each, by which we call him ?
Your name, says he, is not Hermogenes, although all men call you so.
1
And upon my putting a question, and being very desirous to know what he means, he does not state any thing dis­ tinctly, but uses dissimulation towards me, and a feint, as if he had some thoughts in his own mind, which, should he, as being conversant with the subject, be willing to state clearly, he would cause me to agree with him, and to say what he does himself. [2.]
If then you can by any means unfold by guessing this oracular language of Cratylus, I shall very gladly hear you;
or rather, if it is agreeable to you, I would much more gladly hear about the propriety of names, in what way the matter seems to stand to you.
Soc. 0 Hermogenes, son of Hipponicus,2 there is an old proverb, that beautiful things are somehow difficult to learn.
3
Now the learning relating to names happens to be no small affair.
If however I had heard that exhibition of Prodicus valued at fifty drachms,4 by which he who heard might have been instructed, as he himself says, on this very point, no­ thin- would have prevented you from knowing immediately the truth respecting the propriety of names.
But I never heard except the one for a single drachma
Hence I know not where the truth is on such-like points;
but am neverthe­ less prepared to seek it along with you and Cratylus. [3.]
But as to his telling you, that your name is not in reality Hermogenes, I suspect that in this he is, as it were,6 scoffing at you;
for he thinks, perhaps, that though covetous of wealth, you have failed on each occasion in acquiring it.
But, as I just now said, it is hard to know such-like matters ;
by placing however (the arguments) in common, it is meet to consider whether the fact is as you say, or as Cratylus.
Herm.
In good truth, Socrates, although I have frequently disputed with this person and many others, I cannot be per­ suaded that there is any other propriety of appellation, than through convention and common consent.
For to me it ap­ pears, that the name, which any one assigns to a thing, is the proper one;
and that, if he should even change it to another, and call it no longer by the previous one, the latter name will be no less right than the former ;
just as we are accustomed to change the names of our servants, 7 land the name so changed is not the less proper than the one previously given] ;
7 for to each thing there is no name naturally inhe­ rent, but only through the law and custom of those who are wont so to call them.
But, if the case is otherwise, I am ready both to learn and hear, not only from.
Cratylus, but from any other person whatever.[4.]
Soc. Perhaps, Hermogenes, you say something (to the purpose).
Let us then consider, Is that the name of a thing, which any one puts on each thing as its appellation?
Herm.
To me it appears so.
Soc.
And this, whether a private person so calls it, or a state ?
Herm.
So I say.
Soc.
What then, if I should give a name to whatever that exists, in such a manner, as to denominate that a horse, which we now call a man, and that a man, which we now call a horse, the name of man will, as regards the public, re­ main to the same (object);
but as regards the individual, the name of horse ?
and on the other hand, as regards the in­ dividual, the name of man, but as regards the public, the name of horse ?
Do you say so ?
Herm.
It appears so to me.
Soc.
Tell me then, do you say it is a thing, to speak true and false?
Herm.
I do.
Soc.
There will then be a discourse, one true but another false.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Will not that discourse then, which speaks of things as they are, be true;
but that which (speaks of them) as they are not, false?
Herm.
Yes.[5.]
Soc.
This then is possible,8 to speak in a discourse of things which are, and which are not.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Is the discourse, which is true, true as a whole, while its parts are not true ?
Herm.
No;
but the parts are true likewise.
Soc.
But are the greater portions true, and the smaller, not ?
or are they all (true) ?
Herm.
I think all.
Soc.
Is there any part of a discourse, of what you arc speaking, smaller than a name ?
Herm.
No.
This is the smallest of all.
Soc.
And the name is said to be a part of a true dis­ course ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
And it is, as you say, true.
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
But is not the part of a false discourse false ?
Herm.
I say so.
Soc.
It is then permitted to call a name true and false, since (we can call) a discourse so.
Herm.
How not ?
Soc.
Is that, which each person says is the name of a thing, the name of each thing ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
Will there be as many names to a thing, as any per­ son assigns to it ?
and at that time, when he assigns them ?[6.]
Herm.
I have no other propriety of appellation, So­ crates, than this;
that I should call a thing by one name, which I assign to it, and you by another, which you (assign) to it.
And after this manner, I see that by each state, names are assigned individually, sometimes9 to the same things, both by Greeks apart from10 the other Greeks, and by Greeks apart from Barbarians.
Soc.
Come, let us see, Hermogenes, whether things that are, appear to you to exist in such a manner, 11 with respect to the peculiar essence of each," as Protagoras said, when he asserted that-man was the measure of all things;
12 (and) 13 that things are to me, such as they appear to me;
and that, on the other hand, they are to you such, as (they appear) to you ;
or do some of these seem to you to possess a certain stability of existence ?
Herm.
Already, Socrates, I have, through doubting, been led to this, which Protagoras asserts ;
14 but yet this does not perfectly appear to me to be the case.[7.]
Soc.
But what, have you ever been led to this, so that it never seemed to you that a man existed perfectly evil ?
Herm.
Never, by Zeus!
But I have often had this feel­ ing, so as to think, that there are some men, and very many too, profoundly wicked.
Soc.
But what, have there never seemed to you to be men very good ?
Herm.
Very few, indeed.
Soc.
Yet they have seemed to be?
Herm.
Yes, to me.
Soc.
How, then, do you establish this?
Is it.thus?
That the very good are very prudent, and the very bad are very imprudent ?
Herm.
It appears so to me.
Soc.
Is it possible then, if Protagoras speaks the truth, and this is the truth itself that each16 thing is such, as it ap­ pears to each one to be, for some of us to be prudent, and some imprudent ?[8.]
Herm.
By no means.
Soc.
And this, as I think, appears perfectly evident to you, that, since prudence and imprudence exist, it is not possible for Protagoras to speak the truth entirely;
for one person will not in truth be more prudent than another, if that, which seems to each one, is to each one true.
Herm.
It is so.
Soc.
I think however you will not, according to the theory of Euthydemus,17 imagine that all things exist to all persons in a similar manner, and at the same time,18 and always;
for thus some persons would not be good, and others bad, if virtue and vice existed to all persons, and in a similar manner, and always inherent in all things.
Herm.
You speak the truth.
Soc.
If then neither all things exist similarly and at the same time, and always to all persons, 'nor each thing is what it seems to each person,19 it is evident that there are things, which possess themselves a certain firm existence of their own;
and this not as regards us, nor by being drawn up­ wards and downwards by us, through our imagination, 20 but possessing of themselves their own existence, which is natur­ ally theirs.
20Herm.
This appears to me, Socrates, to be the case.[9.]
Soc.
Will then the things themselves exist naturally in this manner, but their actions not in the same manner ?
or are not their actions themselves one species of things ?
Herm.
They are perfectly so.
Soc.
Actions too are performed then according to their own nature, (and) not according to our opinion.
As, for instance, if we should attempt to cut any of things existing, whether must each (particular) be cut as we please, and with what we please ?
or if we should desire to cut any thing, 21 according to its nature of being cut, and with the (instrument) of which it is the nature to cut,21 22 shall we both cut and will some­ thing more take place, and shall we do this rightly?
22
But if (we wish to act) contrary to nature, shall we (not) err, and effect nothing ?
Herm.
To me it appears so.
Soc.
If then we should attempt to burn any thing, we ought not to burn it, according to every opinion, but according to that which is the right one;
23and this is in the way, in which each thing is by nature to be burnt and burn, and with what it is by nature.
23Herm.
It is so.[10.]
Soc.
Are not thus too the rest of things?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Is not then to speak one of the things (called) actions ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
Whether then does he, who speaks in the way he thinks he ought to speak, correctly speak ?
24 or, should he speak in the way in which it is the nature of things to speak and be spoken of, and with the instrument,24 will he effect something and speak;
but if not, will he err and effect no­ thing ?
Herm.
It appears to me it is thus as you say.
Soc.
Is it not then a part of speaking to name a thing ?
25For they who name a thing, speak the discourses.
25Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Is it not then an action to name a thing?
since to speak about things was a certain action.
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
But actions have appeared as existing not with respect to us, but as having a certain proper nature of their own.
Herm.
They have so.
Soc.
We must then give names to things, in the way and by the instrument through which they exist in nature, 26[to name and be named,]26 and not as we please, if there is about to be an assent to what has been said before.
And thus we shall do something more, and give a name, but otherwise not.
Herm.
It appears so to me.[11.]
Soc.
Come then, say we that a thing which we ought to cut, we ought to cut with something ?
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
And that what we ought to weave, we ought to weave with something ?
And that what we ought to bore, we ought to bore with something ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
And what we ought to name, we ought to name by something ?
Herm.
It is so.
Soc.
Now what is that with which we ought to bore ?
Herm.
An auger.
Soc.
And what (is that) with which (we ought to weave)?
Herm.
A shuttle.27Soc.
And what (is that) by which (we ought) to name ?
Herm.
A name.
Soc.
You speak well.
The name then is a certain instru­ ment.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
If then I were to ask, What instrument is a shuttle ?
28(would you not answer,)28 It is that with which we weave?
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
But what do we perform with the shuttle ?
Do we not separate the warp and the woof, which have been mixed together ?
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
Would you not be able to speak in the same manner of an auger, and the other (instruments) ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Can you in like manner speak of a name?
Using the name as an instrument, what do we perform by naming ?
Herm.
I cannot tell.[12.]
Soc.
Do we teach one another something, and dis­ tinguish things as they are ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
A name then is a kind of instrument to teach and distinguish the (parts) of existence,29 as a shuttle (does those) of a web.
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
The shuttle is a weaving instrument ?
Herm.
How not ?
Soc.
He who weaves then will employ a shuttle well;
30 and by well, is meant in a weaver-like manner ;
and he who teaches (will employ) a name well, and by well, (is meant) in a teacher-like manner.
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
By the work of whom does the weaver employ pro­ perly the shuttle, when he uses it ?
Herm.
The carpenter.
Soc.
But is every one a carpenter, or he only who pos­ sesses that art ?
Herm.
He (who possesses) the art?
Soc.
By the work of whom does the borer properly use the auger, when he uses it ?
Herm.
The smith's.
Soc.
Is then every one a smith, or he only who possesses that art ?
Herm.
He (who possesses) the art.
Soc.
Well then, by the work of whom does the teacher employ a name, when he uses it ?
Herm.
Not even this can I tell.
31Soc.
Nor can you tell even this, who has handed down to us the names which we use ?
Herm.
Not I.Soc.
Does it not appear to you that custom32 has handed down these ?
Herm.
It does.[13.]
Soc.
He then who teaches, employs the work of the custom-introducer 33 when he uses a name.
Herm.
It appears so to me.
Soc.
But does every man appear to you to be a custom- introducer, or he only who possesses that art ?
Herm.
He (who possesses) that art.
Soc.
It is not then the province of every man, Hermo­ genes, to establish a name, but of a certain artificer of names;
and this, as it seems, is the custom-introducer,34 who is the most rare of artificers among men.
Herm.
So it appears.
Soc.
But come, consider, to what does the custom-intro­ ducer35 look when he establishes names;
and make the survey­ from the previous instances.
To what does the carpenter look, when he makes a shuttle ?
Is it not to some such thing as is weaving naturally ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
But if the shuttle should be broken by him while making it, would he make another, looking to the broken one, or to that form, according to which he was making the shuttle he had broken ?
Herm.
To that, it appears to me.
Soc. 36
Should we not therefore most justly call that very form the shuttle itself ?36Herm.
It appears so to me.[14.]
Soc.
When therefore it is requisite to make a shuttle, (adapted) to a thin or thick garment, either of thread or wool, or of any material whatever, it is necessary for all of them to have the form of the shuttle;
but to impart its nature to each kind of work according as it is naturally the best suited for it.
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
And the same method applies in the case of other instruments.
For he who has discovered an instrument naturally suited to each thing, must assign it to that work, from which he will make not what he pleases, but that which is natural (to the instrument).
37For as it seems, a person ought to know how to form of iron an auger naturally suited for each (work).
37Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
And of wood a shuttle naturally suited for each (work).
Herm.
It is so.
Soc.
For each shuttle, as it seems, is naturally suited to each kind of weaving;
and so are the other (instruments).
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
It is necessary then, 0 best (of men), for the custom- introducer38 to know how to form a name of sounds and syl­ lables ;
and looking to what is really a name,39 to frame and establish all names, if he is about to be the master-founder of names. [15.]
But if each founder of names does not form of the same syllables a name,40 we ought not to be ignorant of this.
41
For neither does every smith use the same iron, when making the same instrument for the sake of the same thing;
but as long as he gives it the same form, although from even42 a different kind of iron, the instrument is equally43 correctly made, whether one makes it here, or among the Barbarians.
Is not this the case ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Will you not therefore deem it right to say, that, so long as the founder of names,44 both here and among the Bar­ barians, assigns the form of a name accommodated to each thing, in any kind of syllables whatever, the founder of names here is not worse than the founder in any other place what­ ever ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Who then is likely to know whether the convenient form of a shuttle exists in any kind whatever of wood ?
Is it tie carpenter who made it, or the weaver who is to use it ?
Herm.
It is more probable he who is to use it, Socrates.[16.]
Soc.
Who is it then that uses the work of the lyre­ maker ?
Is it not he, who knows how best to superintend the maker;
and knows when it is made, whether it is properly made or not ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
But who is this ?
Herm.
The lyre-player.
Soc.
And who is it (that uses) the work of the ship­ wright ?
Herm.
The pilot.
Soc.
And who is he, that would superintend the best the work of the founder of names, and decide about it when finished, both here and among the Barbarians ?
Is it not he, who is to use it?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
And is not this person, one who knows how to in­ terrogate ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
And likewise to answer ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
But would you call him, who knows how to interro­ gate and answer, any thing else, than a dialectician ?
Herm.
No;
but this.
Soc.
It is the business then of the shipwright to make a rudder, while the pilot is superintending, if the rudder is about to be a good one.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
And (to make) a name (it is the business) of the name-founder, it seems, to have a dialectician as his superin.
tendent, if he is about to found names correctly.
Herm.
Such is the case.[17.]
Soc.
It nearly appears then, Hermogenes, that the imposition of names is not, as you'think it, an affair of no mo­ ment, nor for men of no mark, nor of such as may be met with any where.
And Cratylus speaks truly, when he says that names belong to things from nature;
and that every one is not the artificer of names, but he alone, who looks to that name, which is naturally suited to each thing, and who is able to mould its form into letters and syllables.
Herm.
I know not, Socrates, how I ought to oppose myself to what you are saying.
It is not however easy perhaps to be thus suddenly persuaded.
But I think I should be more easily persuaded by you, if you could show me what is that which you call a natural propriety of appellation.
Soc.
I myself, 0 blessed Hermogenes, say there is none.
But you have forgotten, what I said a short time previously, that I knew nothing, but would consider the matter together with you.
But now, to myself and you considering well the question together,45 thus much appears contrary to our former opinion, that the name possesses some natural propriety, and that it is not for every man to know how to give a name to any thing whatever correctly.
Or is it not so ?
Herm.
Entirely so.[18.]
Soc.
It is necessary then to inquire, if you desire to know it, after this, in what does the propriety of a name consist.
46Herm.
But I do desire to know it.
Soc. Consider then.
Herm.
How must I consider ?
Soc.
The most correct inquiry, my friend, (will be) with those, who know through your telling out money to them, and giving them thanks.
These are the sophists, to whom your brother Callias told out a mint of money, and (now) appears to be a wise man.
But, since you are not the master of your patrimony,48 you must earnestly entreat your brother, and be- of him to show you the.
propriety respecting things of this kind, which he has learned from Protagoras.
Herm.
But this request of mine would be absurd, Socrates, if, when I reject entirely The Truth "49 of Protagoras, I should embrace what is stated in such a truth,50 as things of any value.[19.]
Soc.
But if this does not please you, we must learn from Homer, and the other poets.
Herm.
And what says Homer, Socrates, about names;
and where ?
Soc.
In many places.
But those are the chief and most beautiful (passages), in which he distinguishes between the names, which men and gods assign to the same things.
Or do you not think that he says something great and wonderful in those passages relating to the propriety of names ?
For it is evident surely that the gods call things according to the propriety which names naturally possess.
Or do you not think so ?
Herm.
I well know, that if (the gods) call any thing by a name, they call it so correctly.
But of what passages are you speaking ?
Soc.
Do you not know, that when speaking of the river at Troy, which fought in a single combat with Hephæstos, (Vul­ can,) he says, (11. xx. 74,) Whom gods call Xanthus, but Scamander, men.
Herm.
I do.
What then?
51Soc..
Do you not think that this is something of high im­ port, to know in what way it is right to call that river Xanthus, rather than Scamander ? [20.]
Or, if you prefer it, in the case of the bird, which he says, (II. xx. 291,) Chalcis the gods, but men Kymindis call.
Do you think this is a trifling piece of learning, (to know) how much more proper it is to call the same bird Chalcis than Cymindis, or Myrine than Batiea;
52 and there are many other (passages), both in this poet and in others.
But these things are perhaps too great for me and you to discover.
But the names Scamandrius and Astyanax are, as it appears to me, more for a (common) man to investigate and more easy (to see), what is the propriety of the names, which, he says, were given to the son of Hector.
For you doubtless know the verses, in which are the names I am speaking of.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Which then of these names do you think Homer con­ sidered as more correctly given to the boy, Astyanax or Scamandrius ?
Herm.
I cannot tell.
Soc.
But reflect in this way.
If any one should ask you, whether you thought the more wise or the less wise would call things in the more correct manner ?
Herm.
It is manifest I should answer, the more wise.[21.]
Soc.
Whether then do women, or men, to speak of the whole (human) race, appear to you to be the wiser in cities ?53Herm.
The men.
Soc.
Do you not then know, that Homer says that the son of Hector was called by the men of Troy,54 Astyanax, but Scamandrius, 55it is plain,55 by the women ;
since the men' were wont to call him Astyanax.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
Do you not then conceive that Homer considered the men of Troy wiser than the women ?
Herm.
I think so.
Soc.
He therefore thought that the name Astyanax was more correctly given to the boy than Scamandrius.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
But let us consider why he did so.
Or does he not himself give the best explanation for the reason?
For he says, To throw a bulwark he alone was found, The city's gates57 and the long walls around.
On this account then, as it seems, it is proper to call the son of the saviour, Astyanax;
of that58 which, as Homer says, his father preserved.[22.]
Herm.
So it appears to me.
Soc.
But what is this?
For I do not myself understand this at all.
Do you understand it ?
Herm.
By Zeus, I do not.
Soc. But, my good (friend), Homer has himself given to Hector his name.
Herm.
Why so ?
Soc.
Because it appears to me that this name (of Hector)59 is something similar to Astyanax, 60and these names appear to be Greek;
for king and Hector signify nearly the same thing;
both the names to be royal.60
For over whatsoever one is a king, he is also doubtless a Hector over it;
since he evidently rules over it, 61 possesses and has it.
61
Or do I ap­ pear to you to say nothing to the purpose, but unconsciously (err), in thinking I have hit upon, as it were, the track of Homer's thoughts respecting the propriety of names ?
Herm.
By Zeus, not you indeed, as it seems to me;
but perhaps you have hit upon something.
Soc.
For it is just, as it appears to me, to call the offspring of a lion, a lion, and the offspring of a horse, a horse.
I do not mean, should something else than a horse be produced, like a monster, from a horse, but I speak of that which should be its offspring as a natural production.
For 62 if a horse should, contrary to nature, beget a calf, the produce of a cow by nature, we must call it not a colt, but a calf.62 63 Nor do I think that, if from a man an offspring should be produced not of a man, the progeny ought to be called a man;
but if it be the offspring.63
And similar is the case of trees, and all other things.
Or do you not agree with me ?
Herm.
I do agree.[23.]
Soc.
You speak well.
But take care lest I somehow cheat you.
For according to the same reasoning, the offspring of a king ought to be called a king.
Now it matters not whether the signification be the same in syllables different in one way or another;
nor if a letter be added or taken away, is even this any thing, so long as the existence of the thing is in force, and shown by the name.
Herm.
How say you this ?
Soc.
Nothing complex;
but as you know we pronounce the names of the elements, but not the elements themselves, except four, e and v, and o and w;
and placing round,64 you know, other letters, as well to the other vowels as to the non­ vowels, (consonants,) we form names, and pronounce them.
But, as long as we insert the exhibited power of the element, it is well to call it by the name which the element exhibits.
As, for instance, βη̃τα.
Here you see that, although the η and the r and the a have been added, there is nothing to pain65 us, so as not to exhibit by the whole name the nature of that element which its name-founder66 intended;
so well did he know how to give names to letters.
Herm.
You appear to me to speak the truth.[24.]
Soc.
Will not then the same reasoning take place respecting a king?
For a king will be produced from a king, both good from a good one, and beautiful from a beautiful one;
67 and so in the case of every thing else, from each genus another such is the progeny, unless something mon­ strous is produced, and they must be called by the same name.
But it is possible to vary (the names) by syllables, so that, to an unskilled person, what are the same would appear to be different from each other.
Just as the drugs of phy­ sicians, when varied by colours or smells, appear to us to be different, although really the same;
but to the physician, as one who looks to the power of the drugs, they appear to be the same, nor is he struck at all with astonishment by the additions to them.
In like manner, perhaps, he who is skilled in names looks to their value, and is not struck with astonish- ment if a letter is added, or changed, or taken away, or the same value of the name.
is found in the other letters taken all together. [25.]
As in the names of Astyanax and Hec­ tor, which we have just spoken of;
they do not possess any one of the same letters, except the r, and yet they signify the same thing.
And what has ἀρχέπολις (ruler of a city) in its letters common (with the two preceding names) ?68 and yet it means the same thing.
And there are many other words which signify nothing else than a king;
and others again (which signify) an army-leader, as 'Αγις, Πολέμαρχος, Εὐπό­ λεμος;
and others connected with medicine, as 'Ιατρκλη̃ς and 'Ακσίμζροτος.
And perhaps we could find many others dis­ agreeing in syllables and letters, but in their value speaking the same sense.
Does this appear to you to be the case, or not ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
And that to those, who exist according to nature, the same names should be assigned ?
Herm.
Perfectly so.
Soc.
What then, to those, who are born contrary to nature, and in the form of monsters, as when from a good and pious man an impious one is produced;
surely, as we said before, that if a horse should beget a progeny from a cow (the off­ spring)69 ought not to have the name of the begetter, but of the party that brought it forth? ?70Herm.
Entirely so.[26.]
Soc.
To the impious man, then, produced from the pious one, the name of his genus must be assigned ?
Herm.
Such is the case.
Soc. Not Theophilus, (god-loving,) nor Mnesi-theus, (god­ remembering,) nor any name of this kind, but something which signifies the contrary to these, 71(must we call such a son,)71 if names are to possess any propriety.
Herm.
By all means, Socrates.
Soc.
Just as, Hermogenes, the name of Orestes nearly ap­ pears to be correct;
whether a certain fortune assigned to him this appellation, or some poet, 72 pointing out by this name the savageness of his nature, and his wildness, and the (habits) of a mountaineer.
72Herm.
So it appears, Socrates.
Soc.
It seems also that the name of his father was accord­ ing to nature.
Herm.
It does so.
Soc.
For it nearly appears that Agamemnon was 73such a person as, with respect to whatever he had determined to labour through and endure, to put the finish to what he had determined on through valour.
73
And the proof of his patient endurance is his staying at Troy with so great a host.
74
That this man therefore is to be admired for his staying, and is de­ noted by the name Agamemnon.75 [27.]
Perhaps, too,
Atreus is correctly said;
for his murder of Chrysippus, and what he did so very cruelly to Thyestes, were all noxious and hurtful as regards virtue.
76
The appellation, therefore, of the name77 turns a little on one side, and conceals its meaning, so as not to show the nature of the man to all;
but to those who are skilled in names, Atreus sufficiently points out what it means.
For his name properly exists in every way with reference to what is not worn down, not fearing,78 and hurtful.
It appears also to me, that his name was properly given to Pelops:
for this name signifies one who sees things near;
and I think79 he is worthy of the appellation in some such way as this.
Herm.
How ?
Soc.
In such a way as this.
It is reported against this man, that in the murder of Myrtilus, he was neither able to think beforehand, nor perceive any of the things afar off relating to his whole race, with how great a calamity he would fill it;
but only to see80 what was near, and on the instant;
for such is the meaning of πέλας (near), when he desired to obtain, by all means, his marriage with Hippodamia.
81 (From whence the name of Pelops comes from πέλας, near, and ὄψις, sight).81 [28.]
To Tantalus, likewise, all would deem the name to have been properly and naturally assigned, if it be true what is told of him.
Herm.
What is it ?
Soc.
That, while he was yet living, many and terrible mis­ fortunes happened to him ;
of which82 at last his whole coun­ try was overthrown ;
83 and that, when he was dead, there was the vibration84 of the stone over his head in Hades, it being wonderfully in unison with his name;
for it really seems as if one, wishing to call him ταλάντατος (most miserable), did, 85concealing (that name), call him by the name of Tanta­ lus (instead of Talantatus).85
And it seems that the accident of the rumour 86 contributed to some such appellation.
But it appears that the name of him, who was called his father, was made in.
an all-beautiful manner.
It is however by no means easy to understand it.
For in reality the name of Zeus is, as it were, a sentence;
and persons dividing it into two parts, some of us make use of one part, and some of another;
for some call him Ζὴν, and some Δίς.
But these parts collected into one, exhibit the nature of the god;
which, as we have said, a name ought and should be able to do.
For there is no one, who is more the cause of living, both to us and every thing else, than he who is the ruler and king of all.87 [29.]
It follows therefore that this god is rightly named, through whom life is present to all living beings;
but the name, though one, is distributed, as I have said, into two parts, Dis and Zen.
Now he, who hears on a sudden that this god is the Son of Kronos, may perhaps think it an insulting asser­ tion.
But it is according to reason for Zeus to be the off­ spring of some great intellect.
Now Koros88 does not signify a boy, but the pure and unmixed nature of intellect.
Now he (Kronos) is the son of Ouranus (Heaven):
and the sight directed to things above has fairly a right to be called by this name, Ourania (heavenly), from beholding things on high.
From whence too, Hermogenes, they who discourse on sublime affairs, say that a pure intellect is present with him, and that the name of Ouranus90 is very properly given to him.
Indeed, if I had remembered Hesiod's genealogy of the gods, (and)91 whom he mentions as their still preceding progenitors, I should not have desisted from showing you how correctly their names have been laid down, until I had made trial of this wisdom, what it will effect, whether it faints or not, which has now recently come upon me so suddenly, I know not from whence.[30.]
Herm.
Indeed, Socrates, you really appear to me to speak oracles on a sudden, like those inspired by a god.
Soc.
And the reason I assign,92 Hermogenes, is, that this wisdom has come upon me through Euthyphron of the ward of Prospaltius:
93 for I was much with him in the morning, and I gave him my ears.
94
It nearly appears then, that, being divinely inspired, he has not only filled my ears with divine wisdom, but laid hold also of my very soul.
It appears therefore to me, that we ought to act in this way;
to make use of this wisdom to-day, and to contemplate what yet remains concerning the propriety of names;
but to-morrow, if it seems good to you, we will send it away (as a pollution), and purify ourselves from it, after finding out a person who is skilled in expiating things of this kind, whether he be one of the priests, or the sophists.
Herm.
I assent to this;
for I shall hear, with great plea­ sure, what remains (of the discussion) respecting names.
Soc.
But it is necessary to act thus.
From whence then do you wish us to begin the inquiry, since we have arrived at a certain form,95 that we may know whether the names them- selves will testify in our favour, that they were not entirely fabricated from chance, but possess a certain propriety? [31.]
Now the names that are mentioned of heroes and men would perhaps deceive us;
for many of these exist according to the appellations of their ancestors, and do not suit some persons,96 as we stated at the commencement.
But many assume them, as matters of boasting,97 such as Eutychides (the son of the fortunate), Sosias (the son of the saved), and Theophilus (the god beloved), and many others.
Such then as these, it appears to me, we ought to dismiss.
But it is most probable that we shall find names properly imposed, respecting things existing for ever, and naturally produced;
for in these it is especially fitting for the imposition of names to be a careful study.
But perhaps some of these have been given by a power more divine than that of man.
Herm.
You appear to me, Socrates, to speak well.
Soc.
Will it not then be just, to begin from the gods, when we are considering that very thing, why the gods are properly called by that name ?
Herm.
It will be reasonable.
Soc.
I suspect then it is of this kind.
It appears to me that the first men of those connected with Greece, considered those only as gods, whom many at present of the Barbarians do;
the sun, and the moon, and the earth, and the stars, and the heavens.
Now as they perceived all these moving and running round in a perpetual course, from this nature of run­ ning they called them gods;
98 but afterwards, perceiving that there were others, they called all of them by the same name.
Seems what I say to be like the truth, or not ?
Herm.
It seems very like.[32.]
Soc.
What then shall we consider after this ?
Is it not clear, (we ought to consider about) daemons, heroes, and men ?
Herm.
About daemons.
Soc.
Now in good truth, Hermogenes, what does the word dæmons mean ?
Consider whether I say aught to the purpose ?
Herm.
Only say what it is.
Soc.
Know you then whom Hesiod says are dæmons ?
Herm.
I do not understand.
Soc.
But know you not that he says, the golden race of men was first created ?
Herm.
This I know.
Soc.
He says, then, concerning it,99 But when concealed had Destiny this race, Daemons there were, called holy, upon earth Good, ill-averters, and of man the guard.
Herm.
What then ?
Soc.
I think he calls the race golden, not as being naturally of gold, but as being beautiful and good.
And I infer this, from his calling us an iron race.
Herm.
You speak the truth.
Soc.
Do you not then think, that if any one of those living now were good, Hesiod would say he was of that golden race ?
Herm.
Probably.
Soc.
But are the good any other than the prudent ?
Herm.
The prudent.[33.]
Soc.
On this account then, especially, as it appears to me, he speaks of them as daemons ;
because they were (dæmones) prudent and learned.
And, in our old language, this very name occurs.
Hence both lie, and many other poets, say well, who say that when a good man shall have reached his end, he receives a mighty destiny and honour, and becomes a daemon, according to the appellation of pru­ dence.
I therefore give (my vote)100 for this, that every1 daemon (learned) man, who is good, is daemon-like, both while living and when dead, and is properly called a daemon.
Herm.
And I, Socrates, seem to myself to give entirely the same vote with you on this point.
But what can the name of hero be ?
Soc.
This is by no means difficult to understand.
For their name is drawn aside a little, showing that its origin is from love.
Herm.
How is this ?
Soc.
Do you not know that heroes are demigods ?
Herm.
What then ?[34.]
Soc.
All of them were doubtless begotten either from a god falling in love with a mortal woman, or from a mortal man (falling in love) with a goddess.
If then you consider the matter according to the old Attic language, this too you will more clearly understand.
For it will show you that the word (hero) is slightly drawn aside, for the sake of the name,2 from the word love, through which the heroes were begotten.
And either this says the heroes,3 or because they were wise and rhetoricians, powerful and skilled in dialec­ tic, and all-sufficient to interrogate;
4 for εἴρειν is the same as to speak.
Hence, as we just now said, in the Attic language they, who are called heroes, coincide5 as certain rhetoricians, interrogators, and lovers:
6 so that the genus of rhetoricians and sophists becomes an heroic tribe.
This, indeed, is not difficult to understand;
but rather this respecting men, why they are called ἄνθϱωποι.
Can you tell the reason ?
Herm.
From whence, my good (man), can I ?
And in­ deed were I at all able to find this out, I shall not exert my­ self, through my thinking that you will more easily discover it than myself.
Soc.
You appear to me to rely on the inspiration of Euthy­ phron.
Herm.
Evidently so.
Soc.
And rightly relying.
For I now seem to myself to understand it in a clever manner;
and I shall run the risk, if I do not take care, of becoming to-day wiser than is fitting. [35.]
But consider what I am saying.
For this ought in the first place to be understood concerning names, that we often introduce letters, and (often)7 take some away, while we give names, as we please:
and (often)8 change the acute syllables.
As when we say Διἵ φίλος (a friend of Dis):
for, in order that there may be a noun instead of a verb, we take away the second ἰῶτα, and, instead of an acute syllable in the middle, we pronounce a grave one.
But on the contrary, in others we introduce letters, and others again, with a graver accent, we pronounce with a more acute one.
9
Herm.
You speak the truth.
Soc.
Of these things one, as it appears to me, takes place in the name ἄνθϱωπος (man):
for a noun is generated from a verb, one letter, a,.
being taken away,10 and the end of the word becoming more grave.
Herm.
How do you mean ?
Soc.
Thus.
This name (ἄνθϱωπος) indicates that other animals, who can see, neither consider, nor reason, nor contem­ plate ;
but that man sees-for such is the meaning of ὄπωπε— 11 and at the same time contemplates and reasons upon what he sees.
Hence man alone, of all animals, is rightly denominated aνθϱωπος,11 contemplating what he sees.[36.]
12 Herm.
What then, shall I ask you what follows after this, (and) which I would very gladly hear ?
Soc.
By all means.
Herm.
As then there appears to me to be something in order after these;
for we surely call the soul and body of man by some name.
13Soc.
How not ?
Herm.
Let us, then, endeavour to divide these too, as we did the former subjects.
Soc.
Do you say that you have considered14 first the soul, that it has with reason this name, and afterwards so has the body?
12Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
To speak then off-hand, I think that those, who called the soul by that name, understood some such thing as this;
that whenever it is present to the body, it is the cause of its life, giving it the power to breathe, and cooling it;
but as soon as the cooling power ceases, the body is dissolved and comes to an end.
From whence, as it appears to me, they called the soul (ψυχή).15 But, if you please, be quiet.
For I think I see something carrying more conviction than this to the followers of Euthyphron ;
for this, as it appears to me, they would despise, and consider it as farcical.
But consider whether this will please you.
Herm.
Only say it.[37.
J Soc.
What else but the soul do you think contains and carries the nature of the whole body, so that it lives and goes about.
Herm.
No other.
Soc.
But what, do you not believe with Anaxagoras, that in­ tellect and soul orders and holds the nature of every thing else ?
Herm.
I do.
Soc.
It will be proper then to give this name to that power which carries and holds nature, φυσέχην :
but it may be called more elegantly ψυχή.1617 Herm.
Entirely so ;
and this latter appellation appears to me to be more agreeable to art than the former.
Soc.
For it is certainly so.
It would however appear to be truly ridiculous, if it were named, as it is formed.
17Herm.
But what shall we next consider after this ?
Soc.
Are you speaking of the body ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
In many ways this appears to me, whether one causes it to deflect little or much.
18 For some say it is the sepulchre of the soul, as being buried19 at the present time;
and on the other hand, because whatever the soul marks out it marks out by the body;
on this account it is properly called a mark. [38.]
The followers however of Orpheus appear to me to have founded this name, especially since the soul suffers a punish­ ment on account of the things it suffers;
20 and that it may be preserved, it has this enclosure, the image of a prison ;
and that (the body), as it is called, is the saving of the soul, until it (the soul) shall have paid the penalty due;
and that there is no need of introducing21 a single letter.
Herm.
On this, it appears to me, Socrates, enough has been said.
But about the names of the gods, could we, in the same manner as you have just now spoken about Zeus, con­ sider by what propriety their names are laid down.
Soc. By Zeus, Hermogenes, if we possessed any mind, (we should have) 22 one the most beautiful method, (by confessing) that we know nothing of the gods either themselves or the names by which they call themselves;
for it is evident that they call themselves by correct names.
But the second mode of pro­ priety consists in our calling the gods by those names, by which there is a law for us to invoke them in our prayers, whatever they are, and by whatever name they like to be addressed, since we know of nothing else;
for this appears to me to have been beautifully ordained. [39.]
If you are willing, therefore, let us consider this point, having previously, as it were, de­ clared to the gods, that we shall speculate nothing about them-for we do not think ourselves worthy to do so-but about the men, what thoughts they had, when they gave the names ;
for this will not expose us to their wrath..
Serm.
You appear to me, Socrates, to speak with modera­ tion ;
let us therefore act in this manner.
Soc.
Ought we not then to begin, according to custom, from Hestia ?23Herm.
It is just what we should.
Soc.
What then shall we say the person intended, who gave the name of 'Εστία ?.Serm.
By Zeus, I do not think this is an easy thing.
24Soc.
The men, 0 good Hermogenes, who first founded names, seem almost to be no mean persons, but conversant with high subjects and discourses on them.
25Herm.
What then ?
Soc.
It seems to me that the founding of names was the work of some such men.
And indeed, if any one considers foreign names, what each means is not the less discovered. [40.]
For instance, in the case of that which we call Οὐσία, there are, who call it 'Εσία, 26and others again 'Ωσία.26
In the first place then, according to one of these names ('Εσία), the existence of things (Οὐσία) has a right to be called 'Εστία;
and again, because we call that which participates in exist­ ence by the name of 'Εστία, it would on this ground be pro­ perly called 'Εστία:
for we too seem of old to have pronounced Οὐσία, 'Εστία.27
Moreover, if any one bears in mind the busi­ ness of sacrifice, he will deem that this was in the thoughts of those who instituted (the names).
For it is likely, that they, who called Οὐσία (Ousia), the existence of all things, 'Εστία (Hestia), sacrificed to Hestia before all the gods.
But they who called it 'Ωσία (Osia), would nearly, according to Heraclitus, consider that all things move, and nothing is at rest.
The cause therefore and leader of things with them was τὸ ὠθου̃ν (the pushing on):
and hence they very properly called it 'Ωσία (Osia).
28
And thus much let it be said as if from those who know nothing.
29 But, after Hestia, it is just to speculate about Rhea and Kronos, although we have discussed already the name of Kronos.
But, perhaps, I say nothing to the purpose.[41.]
Herm.
Why so, Socrates?
Soc.
I perceive, (my) good man, a certain hive of wisdom.
Herm.
Of what kind is it ?
Soc.
It is almost ridiculous to mention it;
and yet I think it has some plausibility.
Herm.
What is this ?
Soc.
I seem to myself to see Heracleitus speaking artlessly31 some old wise saw about Kronos and Rhea, which Homer too asserts.
Herm.
How say you this ?
Soc.
Heracleitus says some where that all things move, and nothing is at rest;
and comparing things to the flowing of a river, observes that "
Thou canst not twice into the same stream go."
32Herm.
Such is the fact.
Soc.
What then, does he appear to you to think differently from Heracleitus, who gave the names of Rhea and Kronos to the progenitors of the other gods ?
And do you think that Heracleitus by chance assigned to both of them the names of flowing streams?33
As then34 Homer (II. xiv. 201) calls
Ocean the generation of the gods, and Tethys their mother, so I think the same is asserted by Hesiod.35 Likewise Orpheus says some where, Ocean with lovely streams did first begin Marriage, and wedded Tethys, sister-kin.
Consider then, how all these harmonize with each, and all tend to the doctrine of Heracleitus.[42.]
Herm.
You appear to me, Socrates, to say something to the purpose.
I do not however understand what the name Tethys means.
Soc.
Surely it nearly implies this of itself, that there is a name of a fountain concealed;
for that which is percolated,36 and strained through, is the representation of a fountain ;
and from both these names the name Tethys37 is composed.
Herm.
This,
Socrates, is elegant.
Soc.
How is not about to be?
38
But what is after this?
Of Zeus we have already spoken.
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
Let us then speak of his brothers, Poseidon and Pluto, and of that other name 39 by which he is called.
Herm.
By all means.
Soc.
The name then of Poseidon appears to me to have been given by40 the party first naming it, because the nature of the sea stopped him when walking, and did not permit him to proceed any further, but became as it were a chain to his feet.
He therefore denominated the ruler of this power Ποσειδω̃ν, as Ποσί-δεσμος ὣν being (a foot-chainer).
But the ε was perhaps added for the sake of elegance.
And perhaps too it would not mean this ;
but two XX were originally spoken instead of a ;
signifying that this god is much-knowing.
41 And perhaps likewise he was denominated ὀσείων (the shak­ ing), from σείειν (to shake), and 7r and δ were added.42 [43.]
But Πλούτων (Pluto) was so called from the gift of Πλου̃τος (wealth), because riches are dug out of the bowels of the earth.43
But by the appellation Αἶδης, the multitude appear to me to understand that τὸ ἀειδὲς44 was spoken of, and that, being terrified at this name, they call him Pluto.
Herm.
But how does it seem, Socrates, to you ?
Soc.
In many ways do men appear to me indeed to have erred about the power of this god, and to have a fear of him, who is not worthy of it.
For they fear that, when any one of us dies, he remains 45 there for ever, and that the soul, divested of the body, departs to him, 46this too they fear.46
But all these things, the empire of the god, and his name, appear to me to tend to something the same.
Herm.
How so ?
Soc.
I will tell you what appears to me.
For tell me, Which of these is the stronger bond to any animal whatever, so as to cause it to remain in any place whatever, necessity, or desire ?
Herm.
Desire, Socrates, is by far the superior.[44.]
Soc.
Do you not think that many would fly from Hades, unless it held those who go thither by the strongest bond?
Herm.
This is evident.
Soc.
It binds them then, as it appears, by a certain desire;
since it binds them with the greatest bond, and not with necessity.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
Now are there not many desires ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
It binds them therefore with the greatest of all desires, if it is about to bind them with the greatest of bonds.
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
Is there then any greater desire, than when any one, by associating with another, thinks that, through him, he shall become a better man ?
Hewn.
By Zeus, Socrates, there is not any whatever.
Soc.
On this account, Hermogenes, let us say, that not one of those there47 is willing to come hither, not even the Syrens themselves ;
48 but that both they, and all others, are en­ chanted ;
such beautiful discourses does Pluto, it seems, know how to utter.
And by this reasoning this god is both a perfect sophist, and a great benefactor to those with him;
and who sends up to those here such good things ;
so many things does he have in superfluity;
and from hence he has the name of Pluto. [45.]
And on the other hand, through49 his unwillingness to associate with men invested with bodies, but only to have an intercourse with them, when the soul be­ comes cleansed from all the evils and desires which were around the body, does he not appear to you to be a philoso­ pher,50 and to have well considered this, that he should thus detain them, by binding them with the desire for virtue;
but that if they possessed the flutterings and mad feelings 51 of the body, not even his father Kronos would be able to detain them with him, in those bonds with which he was said to be bound.
52Herm.
You nearly seem, Socrates, to speak something to the purpose.
Soc.
The name then, 0 Hermogenes, of 'Αἶδης, wants much of being called 'Αἶδης;
from 'Αειδὴς, "unseemly:
" but it is much rather from knowing all beautiful53 things, that 'Αἶδης was so called by the fabricator of names.
54Herm.
Be it so.
But what shall we say of Demeter, and Hera, and Apollo, and Athena, and Hephæstus, and Ares, and of the rest of the gods ?[46.]
Soc.
It appears that Δημήτηρ (Demeter) was so called from the gift of food, as being διδου̃σα μήτηρ, "a giving mother."
But "Hpa (Hera) from being 'Ερατὴ (beloved);
as if55 Zeus is said to have loved her, and had her (for a wife).56 Perhaps, also, the founder of this name, speculating upon things on high, denominated 'Αὴρ (air) "Hpa:
but, for the sake of con­ cealment, he placed the beginning at the end.57
And this you will be convinced of, if you frequently pronounce the name "Ηρα.58 But Φερρέφαττα (Proserpine) many are terrified at, and at 'Απόλλων (Apollo), through a want of skill, as it ap­ pears, in the propriety of names.
For by making a change, they think upon Φερσεφνη;
and this appears to them a thing of dread.59 But it (Φερρέφαττα) means, that the goddess is wise.
For while things are carried along, that which [touches upon],60 and handles, and is able to follow them, will be wisdom.
This goddess therefore may with great propriety be named Φερέπαφα, or something of this kind, on account of her wis­ dom, and contact of that which is borne along:
and hence the wise 'Αἶδης (Pluto) associates with her, because she too is such (i. e. wise).
But men now turn aside from this name, set­ ting more value upon a good pronunciation than truth, so as to call her Φερρέφαττα. [47.]
In like manner with respect to 'Απόλλων (Apollo), many, as I said before, are terrified at this name of the god, as if it signified something dreadful.
61
Or know you not this ?
Herm.
I (know it) very well;
and you speak the truth.
Soc.
But this name, as it appears to me, is most beautifully laid down, with respect to the power of the god.
Herm.
How?
Soc.
I will endeavour to tell you what the fact appears to me.
For there is no other name, which, although one, fits62 better with four powers of this god, so as to touch upon them all, and to show, in a certain manner, his art in music, prophecy, medicine, and archery.
Herm.
Tell me, then;
for you seem to me to speak of this name as something strange.
Soc.
This name then is well fitted, as belonging to a mu­ sical god.
For, in the first place, would not purgations and puri­ fications, both according to the arts of medicine and prophecy, and likewise the going round with torches steeped in drugs, ordered by medical men and prophets,63 and the lustrations on such occasions,64 and the sprinklings, would not (I say) all these be able (to do)65 one thing, (namely,) to render a man pure, both in body and soul ?.Serm.
Entirely so.[48.]
Soc.
Will not then the god who purifies, who washes, and who releases us from such evils, be of such ( a name) ?
Herm.
Perfectly so.
Soc.
According then to the releasings and washings which he affords, as being the physician in the case of such-like things, he will be properly called ’Απολούων (the washer).
But according to his prophetic power, and truth and simplicity, for these two are the same,66 he would most properly be called 'AirXovc (simple), as the Thessalians call him now 67 [for all the Thessalians call this god ‛Απλω̃ν].68
But, on account of his being ever mighty in shooting arrows by his skill in archery,69 he is ’Αεὶ-βάλλων (ever-darting).70
But with respect to his musical power, it is proper to understand that, as in the words ἀκόλουθος (a follower), and ἄκοιτις (a wife), a often signifies the same as together;
so here (a and πολέω signify)11 τὴν ὁμου̃ πολησιν (the rolling together), both about heaven, which men call πόλους72 (the poles);
and about the harmony existing in song, which is called symphony;
because all these, as the clever in music and astronomy assert, cause all things to roll together with a certain harmony.
73
Now this god presides over harmony, ὁμοπολω̃ν, (causing to roll) all these things together, both among gods and men. [49.]
As therefore we call ὁμόκελευθος (following together) and ὁμόκοιτις (lying together), ἀκόλουθος and ἄκοιτις, by changing o into a, so likewise we denominate ’Απόλλων, who was ὁμοπολω̃ν, by inserting another X, because it would have been 74 synonymous with the harsh name.75
And this some at the present day suspecting, in consequence of the value of this name not being rightly considered, are terrified at it, as if it signified some destruction.
But, as was just now stated, the much 76 is laid down, touching upon all the powers of the god, his simple, ever-darting, purifying, and together- rolling nature.
But the name of the Μου̃σαι (Muses), and of music universally, some one,77 as it seems, made from μω̃σθαι (to inquire), and from investigation and philosophy.
But Λητὼ (Latona), (is derived) from the mildness of the god­ dess, 78with reference to her being ἐθελήμων (willing), in what any one might request;
but perhaps, as foreigners call her;
for many call her Ληθώ.
It seems then that she was called Ληθὼ by those calling her by this name, with reference not to the roughness, but the gentleness and smoothness of her manner.78 [50.]
But Ἄϱτεμις (Diana) appears to be (so called) on account of her conduct being ἀϱτεμὲς,79 flawless and orderly through her desire of virginity.
80 Perhaps also the founder of her name so called her, as being cognizant of virtue.
81
And it may be, that hating the ἄροτον82 (ploughing) of man in a woman, or through some of these or all of them, the founder of the name gave it to the goddess.
Ilerm.
But what is Dionysus and Aphrodite ?
Soc.
You are asking about great things, 0 son of Hip­ ponicus.
But the manner of the appellations given to these divinities, has been said to be both serious and jocose.
Ask therefore others about the serious manner;
83 but nothing hinders us from relating the jocose;
for these deities are lovers of jesting and sport.
Now Διόνυσος (Dionysus) would be the giver of wine, and may be jocosely called Διδ-οίνυσος. And οἶνος (wine) may be most justly called οἰόνους, because it makes the majority of those who drink it to have wit, not having it (before).84 But, with respect to Aphrodite, it is not proper to contradict85 Hesiod, (Theog. 195,) but to allow that she was called Ἀφροδίτη, through her generation from ἀφρὸς (foam). I[51.]
Herm.
But, Socrates, as you are an Athenian, you will not forget either Athena, or Hephæstus, or Ares.
Soc.
For it is by no means reasonable.
Herm.
It is not.
Soc.
One of the names of her, (Athena,) it is not difficult to say why it was imposed.
Herm.
Which?
Soc.
We surely call her Pallas ?
Herm.
How not ?
Soc.
Considering then this name to have been formed from dancing in armour,86 we shall, as it appears to me, think properly;
for to lift up oneself or any thing else on high,­ either from the earth, or to shake or be shaken in the hands, we call it to make to 87 dance and to dance.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
The goddess therefore on this account (we call)83 Pallas.
Herm.
And properly so.
But what say you of her other name?
Soc.
That of Athena?
Herm.
Yes.[52.]
Soc.
This name, my friend, is of greater weight.
For the ancients appear to have considered Athena, as those of the present day do, who are skilled in the interpretation of Homer.
For the majority of these, in explaining the poet, say that by Athena he intended mind and intellect.
Now he who founded names seems to have understood some such thing as this respecting the goddess;
or expressing rather something yet greater, he speaks of her as the intelligence of a god ;
89 for that she is a θεοσνόη, (the god-mind,) employing after a foreign mode a instead of η, and taking away t and σ.
But perhaps it is not even in this way.
But he called her θεονόη, as she understood divine concerns better than all the rest.
Nor is it far off to say that he was willing to call intelligence in manner," [as being this deity,] 90 by the name of Ἠθονόη.
But either the founder himself, or some persons afterwards, turned the name aside to something more beautiful, as they thought, and called her Ἀθηνάα (Athena).
Herm.
But what will you say of Hephsestus ?
Soc.
Are you asking about the noble (deity) skilled in light ?
Herm.
I seem so.
Soc.
Is he not evident to all as being Φαι̃στος (luminous), having drawn to himself the η.91Herm.
It nearly appears so;
unless [as it seems] 92 it ap­ pears to you in some other way.
Soc. But, that it may not appear, ask about ῎Αϱης (Mars).
Herm.
I ask then.
Soc.
If you please, then, the name of ῎Αϱης shall be de­ rived from τὸ ἄρϱεν (the male), and τὸ ἀνδϱεῖον (the manly).
But if, on the other hand, (you wish it) from his harsh and not-to-be-turned nature, which is called ἄρϱατον,93 it will be proper for a god warlike every where, to be called by this name.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Let us then, by the gods, free ourselves from the gods;
for I fear to discourse about them.
But about some others, if you wish it, propose as questions, that you may see of what kind are the horses of Euthyphro.94Herm.
I will do what you say, after asking you one thing yet about ‛Ερμῆς (Hermes), since Cratylus says 95 that I am not Hermogenes.
Let us endeavour then to look into the name Hermes, that we may know whether he says any thing to the purpose.
Soc.
This name of Hermes96 does indeed seem to pertain somewhat to discourse, and to imply that with reference97 to his being an interpreter and a messenger, and to his stealing and deceiving in discourses and market-dealing,98 the whole of his business is connected with the power of speech. [54.] 99 As then we said before, (§ 34,) τὸ εἴρειν is the use of speech, and as Homer frequently says, ἐμήσατο, (he planned), [now this is to plan.]
From both of these then this god, planning to speak, and the speech-but εἴϱειν means to speak—just as if the name-founder gives his command to us, He, 0 men, who has planned the speaking, would be justly called Εἰρέμης.99
But we of the present times, thinking to give elegance to the name, denominate him ‘Εϱμῆς, Hermes.
100 [And Iris too it seems is so called, from εἴρειν, (to speak,) because she is a messenger.
]100Herm.
By Zeus, well does Cratylus seem to me to have said that I am Hermogenes.
I am not indeed a ready planner of a discourse.
Soc.
It is likewise probable, my friend, that Pan is the two-formed son of Hermes.
Herm.
How so ?
Soc.
You know that speech signifies the all,101 and circu­ lates and causes to roll perpetually;
and that it is two-fold, true and false.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Is not then the truth of it smooth and divine, and dwelling on high amongst the gods;
but that which is false (dwells) below amongst the mass of mankind, and is rough and goat-like ?
For from hence are the greatest number of fables, and the falsehoods connected with the goat-like life.2[55.]
HeM. Entirely so.
Soc.
Rightly then would he, who indicates every thing,3 and ever rolls, be Πὰν αἰπόλος, the biform son of Hermes;
who in his upper parts is smooth, but in his lower parts rough and goat-formed:
and Pan is either speech, or the brother of speech, since he is the son of Hermes.
But it is by no means wonderful that brother should be similar to brother.
However, as I just now said, 0 blessed man !
let us free ourselves from the gods.
Herm.
From gods of this kind, if you please, Socrates.
But what hinders you from discussing such divinities.
as ῞Ηλιος (sun), and Σελήνη (moon), and ῎Αστρα (stars), and Γῆ (earth), and Αἰθὴϱ (æther), and ᾽Αὴρ (air), and Πῦρ (fire), and ῞Υδωϱ (water), and ῟Ωϱ̇αι (seasons), and ᾽Ενιαυτὸς (year) ?
Soc.
You enjoin me many things;
still if it will gratify you, I am willing (to speak).
5
Herm.
You will indeed gratify me.[56.]
Soc.
What then do you wish the first ?
Or shall we discuss as you have enumerated, (first) the sun ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
It seems then that this would become more manifest, if one should use the Doric name:
for the Dorians call the sun ῞ Αλιος.
He will therefore be ῞Αλιος, from ἁλίζειν (collecting) men into one spot when he rises;
and he would be so, from always εἱλεῖν (revolving) while going round the earth.
And he would seem to be so, because in going he causes to be vari­ ous the productions of the earth.
Now the verbs ποικίλλειν and αἰολεῖν have the same meaning.
Soc.
This name seems to press upon Anaxagoras.
Herm.
Why?
Soc.
It seems to indicate something of a more ancient date than 6 what he lately stated, that the moon obtains her light from the sun.
Herm.
But how ?
Soc.
Σέλας is the same with φῶς (light).
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
Now this light about the moon is perpetually νέον (new), and ἔνον (old),7 if the Anaxagoreans say true;
for, perpetually revolving in a circle, she perpetually renews this light;
but the light of the former month becomes old.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
But, because it perpetually possesses new and old splendour, it may be more justly called σελα-ενο-νεο-άει-α, but compressed together it is called Σελαναία.[57.]
Herm.
This name, Socrates, is dithyrambic.
But what will you say of Μὴν (month), and῎Αστρα (stars)?
Soc. Μεὶς (month) would be properly called μεἷης, from μει­ οῦσθαι (to be diminished) ;
9 but ῎Αστρα (stars) appear to derive their name from ᾽Αστραπὴ (lightning).
Now ἀστϱαπὴ would be ἀναστρωπὴ, because it ὦπα ἀναστϱέφει (turns the eyes);
but being formed with elegance, it is now called ἀστϱαπή.
Herm.
But what (are) Πῦρ (fire) and ῞Υδωϱ (water) ?
Soc. About Πῦρ (fire) I am at a loss;
and it nearly appears, that either the Muse of Euthyphro has deserted me, or this word is very difficult.
Behold then the artifice which I in­ troduce in all such cases where I am at a loss.
Herm.
What is it ?
Soc.
I will tell you.
Answer me then.
Do you know on what account Πῦρ (fire) was so called ?
Herm.
By Zeus, not I.Soc.
Consider then what my suspicions are concerning it.
For I think that the Greeks, especially such as dwelt under the Barbarians, received many of their names from the Barbarians.
Herm.
What then ?[58.]
Soc.
Should any one then investigate how reasonably these names were given according to the Greek language, and not according to that from which the name happens to come, you know he would be at a loss.
Herm.
Very likely.
Soc. Consider then, whether this name, πῦρ (fire), is not of Barbaric origin.
For it is by no means easy to adapt this to the Greek language.
But the Phrygians are thus clearly call­ ing fire, with a trifling deviation, and the word ὕδωρ (water), and κύνες (dogs), 10 and many other names.
Herm.
They are so.
Soc.
It is not proper then to use violence with these words;
since any one can say about them."
On this account there­ fore I reject the words πῦϱ and ὕδωϱ.
But ᾽Αὴρ (air), Her­ mogenes, (is so called)12 because αἴϱει (it raises) things from13 the earth;
or because ἀεὶ ῥεῖ (it always flows);
or because, from its flowing, a breathing is produced:
for the poets14 call winds ἀῆται (breathings).
Perhaps then it means as if a person 15 should say πνευματόϱϱουν (a flowing breathing), or ἀητόϱϱουν (a flowing wind), 16 [from whence he wishes to call it thus, because it is ᾽Αήϱ].16
But I consider αἰθὴϱ (æther) in some way as this;
because ἀεὶ θεῖ περὶ τὸν ἀέϱα ῥέων (it always runs and flows about the air), it would be called ἀειθεήρ. [59.]
But Γῆ (earth), more plainly indicates its meaning, if any one calls it Γαῖα.
For γαῖα would be properly called γεννήτειρα (producer), as Homer says;
for he speaks of γεγάασι as γεγενῆσθαι (to have been produced).
Herm.
Be it so.
Soc.
What is there then for us after this ?
Soc. Now “Ωραι must be pronounced ("Οραι),18 as of old in the Attic dialect, if you wish to know what is reasonable.
For they are ὃραι, through their determining winters and summers and winds, and the fruits19 of the earth;
and as ὁρίζουϭαι (determining), they would be justly called ὃραι.
But ’Ενιαυτὸς and ” Ετος;
(year), nearly appear to be one thing, each in turn.
For that which brings to light the natural productions of the earth, and does, itself by itself, explore them, is ’Ενιαυτὸς (the year).
And as stated before, regard­ ing the name of Zeus, divided into two, some called the deity Zeus and some Dis, so here with respect to the year, it is called by some ’Ενιαυὸς, because it (explores) ἐν ἑαυτῳ̃;
(in it­ self);
but "Eroc, because ἐτάζει20 (it explores).
21 And the whole reasoning is for that, which explores in itself, to be called, being one, twofold;
21 so that two names are pro­ duced, ’Ενιαυτὸς;
and "Eroc, from one reason.
Herm.
But then,22 Socrates, you have made a great pro­ gress.[60.]
Soc.
I seem, indeed, to have driven a long way on the road to wisdom.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Perhaps you will speak something23 more.
Herm.
But after this species (of inquiry), I would most gladly contemplate those beautiful names relating to virtue, with what propriety φρόνηϭις (prudence), δύνεϭις (conscious­ ness), δικαιοϭύνη (justice), and all the rest of this kind are given.
Soc.
You raise up, my friend, no mean a genus of names.
But however, since I have put on the lion's skin,24 I must not act the coward;
but, as it seems, look into prudence, and in­ telligence, and thought, and knowledge, and all the other beautiful names of which you speak.
25Herm.
We ought by no means to stand apart previously.
Soc.
And indeed, by the dog,26 I seem to myself not to act the part of a prophet badly, about what I understand at pre­ sent, that those ancient men, who laid down names, did, like the majority of the wise men of the present period, through their frequently turning themselves round, while in search of the spot where existences are, become dizzy beyond all bounds;
and that subsequently a1l27 things appear to them to turn round28 and to be borne along on every side. [61.]
They do not however blame what they suffer within them- selves as the cause of this opinion, but that things are of themselves so formed by nature, (that) 29 nothing is abiding and firm, but that all things30 flow and are carried along, and are full of all kinds of generation and destruction.
31 I speak this, as having thought on the names just now (mentioned).
32Herm.
How is this, Socrates ?
Soc.
Perhaps you have not perceived that those lately mentioned were imposed upon things altogether borne along, flowing, and in a state of generation.
33Herm.
I do not altogether consider it.
Soc.
Now, in the first place, what we mentioned first is entirely something of this kind.
Herm.
Which is that ?
Soc. φρόνησις(prudence).
For it is the perception of a movement and flowing.
One may also understand by it the utility of movement.
34
But at least it is connected with the idea of being carried along.
35
But if you will, Γνω̃μη (thought) indicates altogether the looking-into and agitating (mentally) a begetting;
36 for the word νωμᾳ̃ν (to agitate) is the same as the word σκοπει̃ν37 (to look into).
Or if you will, νόησις (intelligence) is Γου̃ viov ε̃σις (the desire of a novelty);
since for existing things to be new, it indicates that they are perpetually in the course of being produced.
Hence he, who founded the word νεόεσιν, pointed out that the soul was desirous of this (novel­ ty) :
for it was not called νόησις anciently, but instead of η, it was necessary to pronounce ε twice,—νεόεσιν.38 [62.]
But Σωφροσύνη (temperance) is the σωτηρία39 (safety) of that φρό­ νησις (prudence) which we have just now considered.
’Επισ­ τήμη (science) moreover points out that the soul, which is worthy of notice, follows things hurried along, and is neither left behind them, nor goes before them.
Hence 40 by throwing out c, it ought to be called πιστήμη.40 But Σύνεσις (under­ standing), 41 on the other hand, would thus41 appear to be, as it were, a syllogism.
43For when it says 42 συνίεναι (to under­ stand), it follows that the same thing in every respect is meant as by the.
word ἐπίστασθαι (to know):
for συνιέναι means that the soul marches along with things.43 Σοφία (wisdom), how­ ever, means to touch upon movement.
This, however, is rather obscure and foreign.
But we should recollect, from out of the poets, that they often say, (when they happen to say) 44of a person from among those, who begin to go forward quickly, that ἐσύθη (he rushed forth) they say:
44 and a man of Lacedæmon, (one) of the famous, had the name of Σου̃ς 45 (rusher):
for by this appellation the Lacedæmonians denomin­ ate a rapid rush.
Of this hurried motion then Σοφία (wisdom) signifies ἐπαφὴν46 (the contact), as if things were continually carried along. [63.]
But the word ’Αγαθὸν (good) is wont to be imposed as the name for that portion of all nature which is ἀγαστὸν (to be admired):
for since all47 existences march on, there is in some swiftness, but in others slowness pre­ vails.
48 Every thing therefore is not swift, but there is a part of it ἀγαστὸν (to be admired).
To this portion, ἀγαστὸν (to be admired), is given the appellation ἀγαθὸν (good).48 But of Δικαιοσύνη (justice) it is easy to conjecture that its name was imposed on the perception of what is just.
But what is just in itself, it is difficult (to say) :
49 for it appears to be agreed upon by the multitude up to a certain point;
but be­ yond it to be disputed.
For indeed, such as think that the universe is on a march, conceive the greatest part of it to be of such a nature, that it does nothing but yield;
and that, on this account, there is something pervading the universe 50 by which all generated natures are produced;
and that this per­ vading thing is most swift and most attenuated:
for otherwise it would be unable to pass through every thing while going on, unless it were the most attenuated, so as to hold nothing;
and the most swift, 51 so as to make use of the other things as if in a state of rest.
51
Because therefore it governs all other things διαϊὸν (by going through), it is properly called δίκαιον, receiving the value of the letter κ for the sake of an elegant pronunciation. [64.]
And thus far, as we have just now stated, the multitude agree with us, that this is the meaning of the word δίκαιον (just).52
But I, Hermogenes, being eager on this point, have inquired about all these things, (and heard) 53 in the ’Απόρρητα (Mysteries to be unrevealed), that this is54 the just and the cause;
for that, through which a thing is generated, is the cause;
55 and some one has said privately, that it was on this account it was (said) so cor­ rectly.
But when, after hearing this, I nevertheless quietly ask them, What, 0 best of men, is the just, if this is (said) so correctly ?
I seem to inquire beyond what is becoming, and to leap, as it is said, over the lines dug out;
56 for they say I have sufficiently inquired and heard, and they endeavour, through the wish to satisfy me, to say, one one thing, and another another, and they no longer chime-in together.
For one says that the Sun is τὸ δίκαιον (the just);
for that by it alone, διαϊόντα (pervading) and καίοντα (burning), it becomes the guardian of all things.
But when, delighted, as having heard something beautiful, I mention57 this to another person, the hearer laughs at me,58 and asks me if I think there is nothing just amongst men, when the sun has set ? [65.]
Upon my begging then (to know) what the other means, he says it is fire itself.59
But this is by no means easy to understand.
But another person says, it is not fire itself, but the heat itself which exists in fire.
Another again says, that he laughs at all these opinions;
but that the just was that in­ tellect of which Anaxagoras speaks;
for he said that this pos­ sesses a power from itself, and is not mixed up with anything, but that it puts into order (all)60 things while pervading all things.
But here, my friend, I am in a much greater diffi­ culty than before I attempted to learn what justice is.
But61 at least this name, for the sake of which we have been making the inquiry,62 appears to have been given to it (justice) for these reasons.
Herm.
You appear to me, Socrates, to have heard these (notions) from some one, and not to improvize63 them yourself.
Soc.
But what of the rest ?
Herm.
Not entirely so.
Soc.
Hear then;
for perhaps I may deceive you in what remains, as if I had not heard (what)64 I am saying.
What then remains for us after justice? [66.]
I think we have not yet discussed ᾽Ανδρεία (fortitude);
for injustice is evi­ dently a real hinderance to the pervading power;
65 but 'Av­ δρεία (fortitude) signifies that it is so named from fortitude in fight.
66
Now a fight, if things flow in reality, is nothing else than a contrary flowing.
If then one takes away the δ from the name ἀνδρία, the name ᾽Ανρεία, which remains, points out the thing itself.67
Hence it is evident that not the flowing, which is contrary to every flowing, is 'Ανδρία (fortitude), but only that which flows contrary to what is just;
for (other­ wise)68 fortitude would not be praised.
In some similar man­ ner TO ἄρρεν ( the male) and ὁἀνὴρ (man) (derive their origin)69 from ἄνω ῥοή (an upward flowing).
But Γυνὴ (woman) ap­ pears to me to mean γονὴ (begetting);
and τὸ θη̃λυ (the fe­ male) seems to be so called from θηλὴ (the pap);
but θηλὴ, Hermogenes, from causing, as it were, things irrigated to germinate.
Herm.
It appears so, Socrates.
Soc.
But the word ϑάλλειν (to germinate) appears to me to represent the increase of younglings, because it takes place swiftly and suddenly.
Such then has he70 imitated by the name, having fitted it together from ϑει̃ν (to run) and ἄλλε­ σθαι (to leap).
But do you not perceive that I am carried, as it were, out of the course, since I have come upon a smooth (path) ?
But many words yet remain of those that seem worthy of attention.
Herm.
You speak the truth.[67.]
Soc.
One of these is Τέχνη (art), which we must look into (and see) what it means.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Does not then this signify ἕξιν vov (a habit of thought), by taking away r, and inserting o between χ and v, and be­ tween v and η ?
Herm.
And this in a very poor71 manner, Socrates.
Soc.
But do you not know, blessed man, that the names first formed, are now overlaid by those desirous of travestying them in a stilted style;
and who, for the sake of an elegant pronunciation, add and take away letters, and twist them in every way, partly through ornament, and partly through time ?
For in the word Κάτοπτρον (mirror), does it not appear to you that the p has been absurdly introduced ?
But such alterations some, I think, make, who care nothing for truth, but moulding (prettily)72 the mouth;
so that, after adding much to the first names, they at length rendered it impossi­ ble for a single man to understand what the name means;
as in the case of the Sphynx, which they call Σφίγξ instead of Φίγξ,73 and so in many others.
Herm.
Such is indeed the case, Socrates.[68.]
Soc. Indeed, should any one permit one to add to names, and take away from them whatever he wishes, there would be a very easy road;
and one might adapt every name to every thing.
Herm.
You speak the truth.
Soc.
The truth indeed.
But I think that you, who are a wise president, ought to keep a guard over what is moderate and the probable.
Herm.
I wish I could.
Soc.
And I too, Hermogenes, wish it with you.
But do not, 0 divine man, discuss too accurately, " lest you perfectly exhaust my force:
"74 for I shall ascend to the summit of what I have said, when, after τέχνην (art), I have considered μηχανὴν (artifice).
For Μηχανὴ (artifice) seems to me to mean τὸ ἄνειν (to complete a thing for the most part).
For μη̃κος signifies " length.”
From both of these, μη̃κος (length) and ἄνειν (to complete), is formed the word μηχανή.
But, as I just now said, it is proper to ascend to the summit of our discourse.
For we must inquire what the names of 'Aperi (virtue) and Κακία (vice) mean.
Now one of these I do not as yet see clearly;
but the other appears to me to be mani­ fest ;
for it chimes-in with all that has been said before.
For in consequence of all75 things moving on, whatever is κακω̃ς ἰὸν (moving on badly) will be κακία (bad-moving);
but this, when it subsists in the soul, through its badly moving on to her concerns, 76 most eminently possesses the appellation of the whole of depravity.76 [69.]
But that to move on badly, whatever it is, appears to me to show (itself) in Δειλία (timid­ ity), which we have not yet discussed, but have passed it over;
although it is proper to consider it, after fortitude.
And we likewise seem to have passed over many other names.
Now δελία (timidity) means, that the bond of the soul is strong:
for the word λίαν (vehemently) is (applied to) strength:
and hence the vehement and greatest bond of the soul will be timidity,77 just as ἀπορία (want) is an evil, and every thing, as it seems, which is an impediment to [going and] marching on.78
To go on badly, then, seems to signify the marching on in a restrained and shackled manner ;
which when the soul suffers,79 it becomes full of κακίας (evil).
But if to such things the name of vice is applicable, the contrary of this would be ἀρετὴ (virtue), signifying, in the first place, ease in marching;
and, in the next place, that τὴν ῥοὴν (the flowing) of a good soul is ever let loose;
so that what always flows unrestrained and unimpeded, very properly, as it seems, receives this appellation.
[It is right then to call it]80 ἀειϱείτη.
Perhaps also (some one81) may call it αìϱετὴ, as this is a habit the most eligible.
82
But the word is moulded together and called ἀϱετή.82 Perhaps, too, you will say again, that I feign;
but I assert, that if the name of vice is correct, as I have said above, this name of virtue is correct likewise.[70.]
Herm.
But what does Κακὸν (evil) mean, through which word you have explained many things previously ?83Soc.
It appears to me, by Zeus, something strange, and dif­ ficult to conjecture.
I bring therefore to this too that artifice.
Herm.
What is that ?
Soc.
To assert that this name too is something barbaric.
Herm.
And you seem to be like a person speaking cor­ rectly.
But, if it seems good, we will omit84 these;
and endeavour to see in what way the words Καλὸν (beautiful) and Aìσχϱὸν (base) are well said.
Soc. Aìσχϱὸν (base), then, seems to me just now85 to be very plain as to what it means.
For it corresponds with the preceding remarks.
For he who founded names, appears to me to have throughout found fault with that, which hinders and restrains things from their flowing;
and that he now assigned the name ἀεισχοϱ̓ϱ̓̕̕̕̕ουν to that which is ἀεὶ ἵσχον ϱ̔ου̃ν (ever restraining the flowing).
But at present they call it, by moulding the words together, αἰσχϱόν.
Herm.
But what is Καλόν (beautiful) ?
Soc.
This is more difficult to understand;
86although he says that it is a derived only by the harmony and length of the ov.86Herm.
But how ?
Soc.
It appears that this name is some appellation for in­ tellect.
Herm.
How say you ?[71.]
Soc.
What think you is the cause of each existing thing being called by some 87 name ?
Is it not that which gives names ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Will not then this (cause) be the intellect either of gods, or men, or of both ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
That then which calls things, and the beautiful, are the same, this88 intellect.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
Whatever things then mind and intellect effect, these are to be praised;
but what they do not, are to be blamed ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Now the medicinal business produces medical results;
and the carpenter's business carpentry results:
or how say you ?
Herm.
I (say) thus.
Soc.
And the beautiful produces things beautiful ?
Herm.
It must needs do so.
Soc.
But this, as we have said, is intellect.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
To καλόν (the beautiful) then will be properly the appellation of that φo̦όνησις (prudence) which produces such things as we call beautiful, and which we embrace.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
What then remains of such like names ?
Herm.
Those that are conversant with the ἀγαθόν (good), and the καλόν (beautiful), such as Συμφέϱοντα (things condu­ cive), and Λυσιτελου̃ντα (profitable), and Ωφέλαμα (advantage­ ous), and Κεϱδαλέα (gainful), and their contraries.[72.]
Soc.
You may then by reflecting find τό συμφέϱον (the conducive) from the previous remarks;
for it appears to be a kind of a brother to science.
For it exhibits nothing but the motion of the soul in conjunction with things ;
and that what results from some such a thing should be called συμφέϱοντα and σύμφοϱα (conducive), from συμπεϱιφέϱσθαι (to be carried round in conjunction), is reasonable.
89Herm.
It is reasonable.
Soc.
But κεϱδαλέον (gainful) is from κέϱδος (gain);
and to him, who puts a v instead of a δ in this name, it points out what it means:
for it thus gives, after another manner, the name for " good;
" for as it is mingled with 90 and pervades all things, he who assigned it this name expressed its power, and thus, by placing δ instead of ν, he pronounced it κέϱδος.91Herm.
But what is λυσιτελου̃ν (profitable) ?
Soc.
It seems,92 Hermogenes, not as hucksters use it, should any one 93 settle an expenditure, does it seem good to me to understand τό λυσιτελου̃ν (the profitable);
but being the swiftest94 thing in existence, it does not suffer things to stand still, nor the rushing-on to obtain an end of being borne along, and to stand still95 and to cease;
but always 96frees it, should any end attempt to be produced,96 and renders it un­ ceasing and immortal.
In this way it seems to me that λυσιτελου̃ν (the profitable) obtained the reputation of ἀγαθόν (the good);
for τό τη̃ς φοϱα̃ς Xvov τό τέλος (that which dis­ solves the end of rushing) was called λυσιτελου̃ν. [73.]
But 97 ’Ωφέλιμον (useful) is a foreign name which Homer himself often uses, τῳ̃ὀφέλλειν.97
But this is the appellation of in­ creasing and making.
93Herm.
But how stand the contraries of these ?
Soc.
Such of these as express a negation, there is no need, it appears to me, to go through.
Herm.
But what are they ?
Soc.
The non-conducive, and useless, and unprofitable, and the non-lucrative.
Herm.
You speak the truth.
Soc. But Βλαζεϱόν (hurtful), and Zημιω̃δες (noxious).
ferm.
Certainly.
Soc.
Now τό βλαζεϱόν (the hurtful), he says,99 is that which is βλπτόν τόν povv (hurting the flowing).
But βλάπτον means τό βουλόμενον α̃πτειν (that which wishes to bind) ;
and α̃πτειν (to bind), is the same as δει̃ν:
but this he blames100 every where.
He, therefore, who wishes ἅπτειν povv (to bind a flow­ ing), will be most properly called βουλαπτερου̃ν;
but it appears to me, that, being spoken elegantly, it (becomes) βλαβεϱόν.
Herm.
A variety of names come out, Socrates, to your view;
and you just now appeared to me to have played a pre­ lude with your mouth, as it were, of the melody belonging to Athena, while you pronounced this name βουλάπτεϱου̃ν.1Soc.
I am not, Hermogenes, the cause of this, but those who founded the name.[74.]
Herm.
You speak the truth ;
but what can the word ζημιω̃δες (noxious) be ?
Soc.
What can ζημιω̃δες (noxious) be?
Behold, Hermogenes, how I shall speak the truth by saying, that through adding and taking away letters, persons vary so very much the meanings of names, that by turning then aside sometimes only a little they cause words to have the very contrary meaning.
As in τὸ δέον (the needful).
For I understood, and called to mind just now, in consequence of what I am about to say to you, that2 this new speech of ours, itself the beautiful, has turned round τὸ δέον and ζημιω̃δες, (so as) to in­ dicate the contrary,2 and causing to disappear what they mean:
but the ancient speech points out what both these words mean.
Herm.
How say you ?
Soc.
I will tell you.
Our ancestors you know very fre­ quently used the ι and δ, and not the least the women, who particularly preserved the ancient tongue.
3
But now, instead of the i, they perversely use either ε or η, and ζ instead of o, as being more stately.
Herm.
But how?
Soc.
Just as, for instance, the most ancient men called ἡμέρα (day) ἱμέρα, and some of them ἑμέϱα;
but those of the present times ἡμέρα.[75.]
Herm.
This is so.
Soc.
You know then that this ancient name alone points out what was in the mind of the founder;
for, because light is wont to emerge from darkness upon men pleased with and desiring its beams,4 on this account they called day ἱμέρα.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
But as it is now spoken in high-flown language, you can by no means understand what ἡμέρα means;
although some think that day is called on this account ἡμέρα, because it renders things ἥμεϱα, gentle.
Herm.
So it appears to me.
Soc.
And you likewise know that the ancients called Ζυγὸν (a yoke) Δυγὸν.5Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Now ζυγὸν indicates nothing.
But that which exists for the two things together, for the sake of a binding, is j ustly called δυογόν.
But it is now ζυγόν.
And there are many others so circumstanced.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
In this way then at first the word δέον (binding), when it is thus spoken, signifies the contrary to all the names con­ nected with ἀγαθὸν (good).
For this name being a species of the good, appears to be a binding of, and hinderance to, a rushing-on, as being the brother of βλαβεϱὸν (noxious).[76.]
Herm.
It appears, Socrates, to be very much so.
Soc.
But not if you use the ancient name;
which it is likely was founded with much more propriety than the pre­ sent one.
And it will agree 6 with those former good names, if you substitute as of old L for ε ;
for διὸν7 and not δέον, signifies that good, which (the founder of names)8 praises.
And thus the founder of names will not contradict himself;
but the names δέον, ὠφέλιμον, λυσιτελου̃ν, κεϱδαλέον, ἀγαθὸν, συμφέϱον, εὔποϱον,9 (easily-going,) all appear the same;
signi­ fying by different names that 10 what adorns and pervades every where (is) praised,10 but that what detains and binds, is blamed.
And indeed, in the name ζημιω̃δες, if, according to the ancient speech, you substitute δ for ζ, it will appear to you that this name was applied to δου̃ντι τὸ lov (binding that which is going), and was called[77.]
Herm.
But, Socrates, what is ῾Ηδονὴ (pleasure), and Λύπη (pain), and ᾽Επιθυμία (desire), and such like names.
Soc.
They do not appear to me to be very difficult, Her­ mogenes.
For ἡδονὴ (pleasure) seems to have obtained this appellation as an action tending towards ὄνησις (enjoyment) ;
but the a was added, that it might be called ἡδονὴ instead of ἡονή.12 But λύπη (pain) seems to be so named from the διά­ λυσις (dissolution)13 of the body, which the body undergoes in that suffering :
and ᾽Ανία (grief), as impeding τὃ ἰέναι (going):
14 but ᾽Αλγηδὼν (torture) appears to me to be some foreign word, and to be so called from ἀλγεινὸς (torturing).15 But ᾽Οδύνη (anxiety) appears to be called from the ἔνδυσις (in­ gress of pain).
But ᾽Αχθηδὼν of heart) is clear even to all16 that it is a name assimilated to the heaviness of rush­ ing :
17 (for ἄχθος is " a burden," and ἰὸν " a thing moving ").17 But Χαρὰ (joy) seems to be called from the 18 διάχυσις (dif­ fusion) and Εὐπορία (easy going) of the flowing18 of the soul;
but Τέρψις (delight) was derived from τερπνὸν (pleasant);
but τερπνὸν was so called from being assimilated to πνοὴ (the breath), creeping through the soul;
it would be there­ fore justly called -νουν19 (mind-creeping), but in time it was deflected into τερπνόν. [78.]
But Εὐφροσύνη (hilarity) wants nothing to explain " the why" of its denomination;
for it is ob­ vious to all, that it received its name, εὐφεροσύνη, in strict justice from the soul being εὖ (well) συμφέϱεσθαι (borne along) with all things;
20 nevertheless we call it εὐφροσύνη.
Nor is ᾽Επιθυμία (desire) difficult:
21 for it is plain that this name was applied to a power going on to ϑυμὸς (anger).
But ϑυμὸς (an­ ger) would have its appellation from ϑύσεως (raging) and ζέσεως (boiling).
And again, ῞Ιμεϱος (desire) was so called from ῥου̃ς (a flowing) vehemently drawing the soul.
For because ἱέμενος ῥει̃ (it flows urged on), and is desirous of things, and thus strongly draws the soul through the sending-forth of its flowing, it is, from the whole of this power, called ἵμερος. Moreover Πόθος (regret) is so called signifying 22 that there is (something) of desire not present, and of a stream,22 but from that which is elsewhere, and absent.
23 From whence it is called πόθος (regret), a feeling which is then called ἵμερος (desire), when that is present, for which there is a wish.23 [79.]
But ῎Εϱως (love), because it flows inwardly from without,24 and because this flowing is not the property of him who possesses it, but is introduced through the eyes, was on this account called of old ἔσρος, from ἐσρεῑν (to flow towards) ;
but at present it is called ἔρως, through the change of to into o.25
But what say you 26 shall we still consider ?
Herm.
What does Δόξα (opinion), and such-like names, seem to you ( to signify).
Soc. Δόξα (opinion) was denominated either from δίωξις (pursuit), in which the soul proceeds, while pursuing its knowledge as to how things exist;
or else from τόξου βολη̄ (the darting of an arrow) ;
27 and to this it seems more like.28 Hence Οίησις (opinion) chimes in with this;
29for it seems to be like ἱέσις (a sending-forth) of the soul to all things, when it is showing to those in doubt what each is in reality.29 For 30 just as Βουλὴ (counsel) is to βολὴ (shooting), so βούλεσθαι (to wish), which signifies τὸ ἐφίεσθαι (to desire), is to βουλεύεσθαι (to consult).30 For 31 all these in following δόξα (opinion), appear to be certain resemblances of βολὴ (shooting);
32 just again as, on the contrary, 'Αβουλία (a want of counsel), appears to be the mishap 33of a person neither shooting, nor obtaining that at which he shot, and what he wished, and about what he deliberated, and what he desired.33[80.]
Herm. 34 You seem to me, Socrates, to have just now introduced these names rather thickly and rapidly.
Soc.
For I now wish an end.34 But I wish then still to go through 'Ανάγκην (necessity), which comes in order after those, and also 'Εκούσιον (voluntary).
34Soc.
Now τὸ έκούσιον (voluntary) signifies τὸ εἶκον (the yielding , and not the beating-against;
but, 35 as I say, εἶκον τῳ̃ ἰόντι (yielding to what is going on) would be shown by this name, which exists according to βούλησις (the will).3)
But τὸ ἀναγκαι̃ον (the necessary), and ἀντίτυπον (the beating- against), the being contrary to the will, would be connected with ἁμαρτία (error), and ἀμαθία (ignorance).36
But they are likened to a going along κατὰ ἄγκη (gorges);
because being difficult to pass, and rugged and thick (with bushes), they im­ pede a going-on.
And hence, perhaps, ἀνάγκη (necessity) was so called from its resemblance to a journey through a gorge.
But as long as our strength remains, let us not give up the journey.
Do not you then give up, but interrogate me.
jeria.
I ask then about things the greatest and most beau­ tiful, 'Αλήθεια (truth), and Ψεῡδος (falsehood);
and τὸ ’'Ον (enti­ ty) ;
and that very thing, about which is the subject of our present discourse, ’'Ονομα (name), why was it so called ?
Soc.
You say that μαίεσθαι means something.
Herm.
I say it means ζητεῑν (to inquire).[81.]
Soc. 37
It looks like a name moulded together from a discourse, which says that this name is an entity which an in­ quiry hits.
37
But you would know it rather in the word which we pronounce ὀνμαστὸν (to be named);
38 for there it clearly states 38 that that is ὂν (entity) of which there is μάσμα (an in- quiry).
39 But Ἀλήθεια (truth), this seems to have been moulded together39 like the rest;
for the divine rushing-on of entity appears to have been addressed by this name ἀλήθεια, as being ϑεία ἄλη (a divine wandering).
But ψευ̃δος (false­ hood is contrary to a rushing-on.
For here again returns that which is abused as being detained and is compelled to be at rest;
and (the name) is assimilated to those, who sleep ;
40 but the ψ being added conceals the meaning of the name.
But Ὂν (entity) and Οὐσία(existence) agree with ἀλήθεια (truth), by receiving the addition 41 of an t;
for then they sig­ nify ἰὸν(going), (and ἰουσία) 42 (the act of going).
And on the other hand οὐκ ὂν (non-being), as some also call it, οὐκ 43 ἰὸν (not-going.)
Herm.
You appear to me, Socrates, to have rattled through these questions in a very manly manner.
But should any one ask you, what propriety of appellation have the words Ιὸν (going), ‛Ρέον(flowing), and Δου̃ν (binding)—Soc.
Should I be able to answer him ?
you mean.
Is it not so ?[82.]
Herm.
Perfectly so.
Soc.
One thing I have just now got somehow, so that by answering I shall appear to say something to the purpose.
Herm.
What is it ?
Soc.
To say that what we know not is of Barbarian origin:
for perhaps this would be really the case with some;
and the first names would be inscrutable on account of their antiquity.
For through the names being twisted in every way, it would be not at all wonderful.
if the ancient speech, as compared with the present, differed in nothing from a Barbarian one.
Herm.
You speak nothing from the purpose.
Soc.
Nay, I speak what is reasonable.
But yet the con­ test does not appear to me to admit of excuses ;
44 but we must be ready to reflect upon these matters;
and let us consider, that, should any one always inquire into the verbs, through which a noun is spoken, and again those nouns through which verbs are enunciated, and should do this without ceasing, must not he, who answers such a one, fail at length in his replies ?
Herm.
It appears so to me.[83.]
Soc.
When therefore will he, who fails to answer, justly fail ?
Will it not be when he arrives at those names, which are, as it were, the elements both of other discourses and names ?
For these, if they are so circumstanced, can no longer justly appear to be composed from other names.
Just as we said above,45 that τό ἀγαθόν was composed from ἀγαστός (to be admired) and ϑοός (swift).
But ϑ
οός, we may perhaps say, is composed from other words, and these last again from others:
but if we ever lay hold of that, which is no longer composed from other names, we may justly say, that we have at length arrived at an element;
and that we ought no longer to refer this to other names.
Herm.
You seem to me to speak correctly.
Soc.
Are not then the names, about which you are asking, elements ?
And must we not consider in some other manner what is their propriety ?
Herm.
It is likely.
Soc.
It is likely indeed, Hermogenes.
All the former names, therefore, must come back to these.
And if this be the case, as it appears to me it is, consider again with me, lest I act like a silly person, while stating what the propriety of the first names ought to be.[84.]
Herm.
Only do but speak, and I will, to the utmost of my power, consider the matter with you.
Soc.
I think then you will agree with me in this, that there is one propriety in every name, both first and last;
and that none of them differ, so far as they are names.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
But the propriety of the names we have just now discussed, was such as to show of what kind is each of the things existing.
Herm.
How should it be not so ?
Soc.
This property then the prior names ought to possess no less than the posterior, if they are to be names.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
But the posterior names, as it appears, are able to effect this through the prior.
Herm.
It appears so.
Soc.
Be it so then.
46But after what manner will the first names, which no others precede,47 make, as much as they pos­ sibly can, the things existing clear to us, if they are about to be names ?46 But answer me this.
If we had neither voice nor tongue, and yet wished to point out things to one another, should we not, as the dumb do at present, endeavour to indi­ cate them by the hands, head, and the rest of the body?[85.]
Herm.
How could we otherwise, Socrates ?
Soc.
I think then that if we wished to indicate that which is (going)43 upwards and is light, we should raise our hands towards heaven and imitate the nature of the thing itself;
but if (to indicate) things (going) downwards and heavy, (we should point) to the earth.
And if we were desirous of in­ dicating a horse running, or any other animal, you know that we should make our bodies and gestures as like as possible to those things.
Herm.
It appears to me that the facts are necessarily as you say.
Soc.
For in this manner, I think, the indication of any thing is produced by the body imitating,49 as it seems, that which any one wishes to point out.
Herm.
Certainly.
Soc.
But since we wish to indicate a thing by our voice, and tongue, and mouth, will not an indication of each thing then take place through these, when an imitation of any thing whatever is produced through them ?
Herm.
It appears to me necessarily so.
Soc.
A name then is, as it seems, an imitation by the voice50 of that, which he who imitates, imitates and nomi­ nates by the voice what he imitates.
51Herm.
It appears so to me.
Soc. But, by Zeus, my friend, I do not think that I have yet spoken in a becoming manner.
Herm.
Why so ?
Soc.
Because we should be compelled to confess, that they who imitate sheep and cocks, and other animals, give names to the things which they imitate.
Herm.
You speak the truth.
Soc.
But do you think this is correct ?
Herm.
I do not.
But what imitation, Socrates, will the name be?[86.]
Soc. 52
In the first place, as it appears to me, not if, as we imitate things with music, we so imitate, although we then imitate with the voice:
and in the next place, if we imi­ tate what music imitates, we do not appear to me to make use of names.
52
But I assert something of this kind.
There is a certain voice, figure to each thing, and a colour to many.
Herm.
Entirely so.
Soc.
It appears then that although any one should imitate in this way, the name-giving art would not be conversant with these imitations;
for these are partly musical and partly painting.
Is it not so ?
Herm.
Yes.
Soc.
But what is this ?
Seems there not to you an exist­ ence to every thing, as well as colour, and the other things we just now mentioned ?
In the first place,53 is there not an existence to colour itself, and voice, and to all the rest, which are deemed deserving of the appellation of being ?
Herm.
It appears so to me.
Soc.
But what then, if any one is able to imitate this very thing, the existence of each thing,54 by letters and syllables, would he not indicate what each thing is ?
Herm.
Entirely so.
Sac.
And what would you call him who is able to do this, as you called, of the former characters, one conversant with, music, and the other with painting;
how (call you) this ?[87.]
Herm.
This name, Socrates, appears to me what we are for some time seeking.
For he would be a name-giver.55Soc.
If then this is true, as it appears to be, let us con­ sider those names about which you were inquiring;
about POT (flowing), and Ιέναι (to go), and Σχέσις56 (holding), whether in their letters and syllables a person lays hold57 of entity, so as to imitate existence or not.
Herm.
By all means.
Soc.
Come then, let us see whether these alone are a part of the first names, or whether there are many others.
Herm.
I think there are many others.
Soc.
For it is probable.
But what shall be the mode of division from whence the imitator begins to imitate ?
Is it not, since the imitation happens to be by syllables and letters, the most proper to distribute first the elements ?
just as those who put their hands to rhythms,58 distribute first the powers of the elements, and afterwards of the syllables, and thus at length come to consider the rhythms themselves, but pre­ viously not ?
Herm.
Yes.[88.]
Soc.
Ought we not then to divide thus the vowels, and afterwards the rest according to species, both consonants and mutes ?-for so say59 those who are skilled in these mat­ ters-and again, such as are not indeed vowels yet are not mutes ?
and of the vowels themselves, such as have a different species from each other ?
and after we have properly distributed all these [existences] 60 it is again requisite to impose names, and to consider, if there are certain things into which, as into elements, these may be referred;
and from which it is possi­ ble to see both them, and whether there are species in them in the same manner as in the elements;
60 (and) having well and thoroughly looked into all these points, (it behoves us)61 to know how to bring in each62 according to its likeness ;
whether it is necessary to bring in one to one, or to mix63 many with one;
just as painters do, when they wish to pro­ duce a resemblance, sometimes introduce only the oyster64 (a scarlet colour), and sometimes any other pigment whatever;
and sometimes again they mingle many colours together, as when they prepare the likeness of a man,65 or any thing else of this kind;
according as, I think, each picture seems to re­ quire each colour.
In the same manner we will bring the elements (of words) to things, and one to one, wherever it seems to be necessary, and many together, 66 making what per­ sons call syllables;
and again, combining those syllables to­ ,-ether, from which nouns and verbs are composed;
and again, from these nouns and verbs we will compose something great and beautiful and entire, and like the animal there (described) by the painter's art, discourse by the name-giving, or rhetorical, or whatever art it may be. [89.]
Or rather, we will not do it.67
But I have in speaking been carried out (of the course), for the ancients have put together the words in the way as they lie together.
But we must, if we know how to consider them artistically, to distinguish them thus, and to see whether the first and last names were laid down in a proper manner or not;
for to connect them otherwise (take care) lest it be wrong, my dear Hermogenes, and not in the road to reason.
Herm.
Perhaps so, by Zeus, Socrates.
Soc.
What then, can you trust yourself as being able to divide them in this manner ?
for I cannot.
Herm.
I want indeed much of doing this.
Soc.
Let us leave it then;
or are you willing we should undertake it as we best can, although we are able to look but very little into them;
by stating, as we said before,68 in the case of the gods, that, knowing nothing of the truth, we merely conjecture the dogmas of men concerning them;
so now, on the other hand, we should proceed69 in our own case by de­ claring that, 70 if these have been distributed in the best way either by us or by any other, they ought to have been so di­ vided ;
70 but now it will be requisite for us to be busy about them as it said,71 as best we may.
Or how say you ?[90.]
Herm.
It seems so to me.
Soc.
I think, Hermogenes, it will appear ridiculous for things to become manifest through being imitated by letters and syllables.
And yet it must be so.
For we have not any thing better than this, to which we can refer, touching the truth of the first names;
unless, indeed, as the writers of tra­ gedies, when they are in any difficulty, fly to their machinery and introduce the gods,72 so we shall be released by assert­ ing that the gods founded the first names, and that on this account they exist correctly.
Is not this the best of reasons ?
or the other, that we have got them from some Barbarians ?
-for the Barbarians are more ancient than us.
—Or that, through their antiquity it is impossible to perceive their meaning, as is the case with the Barbaric names ?
But all these would be the (not) 73 very clever evasions on the part of him who is not willing to give a reason for the right imposition of the first names;
although he who does not know the pro­ priety of the first names, is surely unable to know that of the subsequent, which must necessarily be made manifest from the former, of which he knows nothing.
But it is evident, that he who professes to be skilled in subsequent names ought to be able to explain the first, in the best 74 and clearest manner, or to be well convinced that, as regards the subsequent, he is a mere trifler.
Or does it appear otherwise to you ?[91.]
Herm.
Not otherwise, Socrates, in any respect what­ ever.
Soc.
What I formerly fancied about the first names, appear to me now very saucy and ridiculous.
If you wish it then, I will communicate them to you;
but if you have any thing better to obtain from any quarter, communicate it to me.
75Herm.
I will do so ;
but do you speak now boldly.
Soc.
In the first place then p appears to me to be, as it were, the organ of all motion;
although we have not yet stated why Κινηοζ has this name.
It is evident however that it implies Lεσlζ (going);
for n was not used formerly, but εl.
Its origin is from κιεlV (to go), which is a foreign name,76 and signifies ιευαl.
If then any one could find out its ancient name, when transferred to our tongue, it might be very pro­ perly called ιεσlζ.
But now from the foreign name Κιεlv, and the change of the n, together with the interposition of the v, it is called Κινησlζ, but it ought to be called 77 κlεlσlζ;
or ιεσlζ.77 But 78 Στασlζ (standing) is the negation of ιεvai (to go);
and for the sake of elegance is called στáσlζ.78 [92.]
The ele­ ment therefore p, as I said, appeared to the founder of names to be a beautiful instrument of motion, for the purpose of ex­ pressing a similitude to rushing on;
and hence he in many places employed it for this purpose.
And in the first place, the words 'Ρειv (to flow) and 'Poǹ) (flowing) imitate a rushing- on by this letter;
and in the next place, in the words Tpόμοζ (trembling) and TpαΧύζ (rough);
also in such verbs as Κϱούεlv, (to strike), θϱαν́aεlv (to break), 'Εϱειkξlv 79 (to pierce), θpύπτε (to fritter), Κεϱματιζεlv (to cut into small pieces), and 'Pvμβει̃v (to rumble):
in all these he made for the most part a re­ semblance to p '(to a rushing-on).8o
For he saw that the tongue remains quiet for the least time on this letter, but is moved the most;
and hence it appears to me that he employed this letter for those words, but the for all things attenuated, which especially go through all things.
And hence he imi­ tated, by the words ιεvαl (to go) and ιεσθσl 81 (to be sent), L, just as by φ, Ψ, σ, and ζ, because these letters are inflated, the name-giver imitated all such things as ψvχρόv (cold), Zέον (boiling), Σειεσθαι (to be shaken), and universally Σεlσμόv82 (a shaking).
And when the name-founder would imitate any thing inflated, he every where, for the most part, appears to have introduced such-like letters. [93.]
But he seems to have thought that the power of compression in δ and T, and the pushing the tongue (against the roof of the mouth),83 were useful for the imitation of the words Δεσμόζ (bond) and σΤασιζ (standing).
But perceiving, on the other hand, that the tongue moves glibly in X, by means of the resemblance he formed the names Λει̃α (smooth), and the very word Ολι­ σθαvεlv(to slide), Anrapov (oily), Κολλώδεζ;
(glue-like), and all other such-like words.
But where the power of y lays hold of the tongue, sliding through X, he imitated the Γλιχρόv (stickiness) in Γλνκv̀(sweet) and Γλοlω̃δεζ (viscous).
Per­ ceiving likewise that the sound of the v was within, he made the names 'Evδοv (the within) and Εντόζ (within), that he might assimilate the acts to the letters.
But he assigned a to Μὲγαζ (great) and η to Μη̃κοζ(length), because these letters are great.
84
But requiring for Γογγv̀λοζr;
(round) the sign of o, he mixed up o for the most part in that name.
And thus too the name-giver85 appears to have forced, as regards both letters and syllables, other circumstances to each of existing things, making both a mark and name;
and from these to have composed what still86 remains, by imitating in this way. [94.]
Such,
Hermogenes, appears to me to be the propriety in names, unless Cratylus here asserts any thing else.
Herm.
In truth, Socrates, Cratylus very often gives me much trouble, as I stated at the beginning, by his asserting that there is a propriety in names;
but he docs not clearly inform me what it is;
so that I am unable to know whether he thus obscurely speaks on each occasion willingly or un­ willingly.
Now then, Cratylus, state before Socrates, whe­ ther what Socrates says respecting names is pleasing to you, or whether you have any thing better to produce ?
and if you have, mention it, so that either you may learn from Socrates, or teach us both.
,Crat.
But what, Hermogenes, does it appear to you to be an easy matter to learn and teach any thing so suddenly, and much less that which seems to be amongst the greatest ?87Herm.
To me, by Zeus, it does not.
But the saying of Hesiod ('Epy. 359) appears to me well said, that, should one a little to a little add, there would be something done of mo­ ment. [95.]
If then you are able to do any thing at all, although but trifling, do not be faint-hearted, but benefit Socrates here, for83 you can, and me.
Soc.
I would not myself, Cratylus, confidently assert a single point of what I have said above.
But I have considered with Hermogenes in the way it seemed good to me;
so that, on this account at least, speak boldly, as I am ready to receive it, if you have any thing better to say than this.
Nor shall I wonder, if you have something to say better;
for you seem to me to have considered things of this kind yourself, and to have learnt them from others.
Should you then say any thing better, write me down as one of your disciples respect­ ing the propriety of names.
Crat.
And in truth, Socrates, I have, as you say, made this the subject of my meditations ;
and perhaps I shall cause you to become one of my disciples.
And yet I fear that the very contrary of all this will take place.
For somehow it comes into my mind to say to you, what Achilles did to Aias in that part of the poem called ΛιΤαι89 (supplications).
For he says, " Alas, of Telamon the son, and sprung From Zeus, and leader of the people, all To my own heart thou seem'st to hare well said.
"And you too, Socrates, seem to have acted 'the prophet in a reasonable manner according to my notions, whether you were inspired by Euthyphron, or whether some other muse has been existing in you in secret.90[96.]
Soc.
My good Cratylus, I have for a long time ago been wondering myself at my own wisdom;
and still do not believe it.
I think it therefore requisite for me to examine again what I am saying.
For to be deceived by one's own self is the most terrible of all things ;
for since the deceiver is never for a moment absent, but always present, how can it not be terrible ?
It is necessary then, as it seems, to turn ourselves frequently to what has been said before, and to en­ deavour, according to the saying of the poet,91 " to look at the same time before and behind."
Let us then now take a view of what has been asserted.
We said then, that the propriety of name is that which points out the quality of a thing.
Shall we say that this is sufficiently laid down ?
Crat.
To me, Socrates, it appears to be very much so.
Soc.
Names then are spoken for the sake of teaching ?
Crat.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Shall we not therefore say that this is an art, and that there are workmen of it.
Crat.
Perfectly so.
Soc.
But who are they ?
Crat.
Those name-givers92 which you spoke of at the be­ ginning.[97.]
Soc.
Shall we then say, that this art subsists in men, like other arts also, or not ?
I mean to say some such thing as this.
Painters are surely some worse, some better.
Crat.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Will not the better exhibit more beautiful pictures of animals as their productions;
but the worse, worse ? 93
And in like manner, do not builders erect some more beautiful dwellings, others more ugly ?
Soc.
And with respect to name-givers,94 will not some ex­ hibit their works more beautiful, others more ugly ?
Crat.
This does not appear to me.
Soc.
Does it not therefore appear to you, that some name­ workers 95 are better and others worse ?
Crat.
It certainly does not.
Soc.
And does not one name seem to you to be better laid down than another ?
Crat.
It does not.
Soc.
Are all names then correctly laid down ?
Crat.
As far as they are names.
Soc.
But what then shall we say to the name of Hermo­ genes here, which we spoke of before?
Shall we say that this name was not rightly given him, unless something of 'Epμοṽ γεvε̒σεωζ (of the generation of Hermes) belongs to him, or that it was indeed given him, but not correctly ?
Crat.
It seems to me, Socrates, to be not given to him, but only appears to be given;
but that this is the name of some other person, whose nature points out the name.96[91.]
Soc.
Will not then a person say false, who says that he is Hermogenes? 97 for (see), lest on the other hand even this be possible, to call this person Hermogenes,97 if he is not so.
Crat.
How say you ?
Soc.
Does your reasoning mean this, that it is impossible to speak a falsehood ? 98 For there are many, my dear Cratylus, who say this now, and (have said it) of old.
Crat.
How is it possible, Socrates, that, when any one speaks about any thing, he should speak about that which is not ?
Or is not this to speak a falsehood, to speak of things which are not?
Soc.
This reasoning, my friend, is more clever than suits me or my time of life.
But however tell me thus much.
Does it appear to you not possible to speak about a false­ hood, but (possible) to pronounce it ?
Crat.
It appears to me not possible even to pronounce it.
Soc.
Nor to speak of, nor to address you.
As, for in­ stance, if any one, meeting you, should, through his feeling as an host, take you by the hand, and say, All hail, Athenian guest, Hermogenes, son of Smicrion-would he 99 say this, or pronounce this, or speak of this,99 or thus address, not you, but Hermogenes here, or no one ?Crat.
It appears to me, Socrates, that he would pronounce .
these words in vain.[99.]
Soc.
With this then let us be contented.
But whether would he, who pronounced these words, pronounce that which is true or false ?
Or would a part be true, and a part false ?
for this last would be sufficient.
Crat.
I should say, that such a one would, moving himself in vain, make a noise, as the person would, who should move a piece of brass and strike it.
100Soc.
Come then, Cratylus, ( and see) since1 we are re­ conciled somehow, would you not say that the name is one thing, and that, of which it is the name, is another ?
Crat.
I would.
Soc.
And do you not confess, that the name is some imita­ tion of a thing ?
Soc.
And do you not say, that pictures are in some other manner imitations of certain things ?
Crat.
I do.
Soc.
Come then-for perhaps I do not understand sum­ ciently what you mean, although you are perhaps speaking correctly-is it possible to distribute and assign both these imitations, 2[the pictures and the names,]2 to the things, of which they are imitations, or not ?Crat.
It is possible.[100.]
Soc.
But consider this first.
Can any one assign the image of a man to a man, and that of a woman to a woman;
and so in other things ?
Crat.
Entirely so.
Soc.
And is it possible, on the contrary, to assign the image of a man to a woman, and that of a woman to a man ?
Crat.
This also is possible.
Soc.
Are then both these assignments correct;
or only one of them ?
Crat.
Only one of them.- Soc.
That, I think, which assigns to each, what is suited to it and similar ?
Crat.
It appears so to me.
Soc.
Lest then you and I, who are friends (in fact), should become foes in words, receive from me what I say.
For, my friend, I call such a distribution in the case of both imitations [pictures (of animals)2 and names] correct;
but in the case of names, in addition to its being correct, true likewise:
but I call the other, [the giving and introduction,]3 relating to the dissimilar, not correct;
and, when it takes place in names, false.
Crat. But (consider), Socrates, whether this may not be in the case of paintings, to make an incorrect distribution, but in the case of names, not so;
but that in this it is always necessarily correct.[101.]
Soc.
How say you?
In what does this differ from that ?
May not a person, on meeting a man, say to him, " This is your picture," and show him, it may be, his own likeness, or it may be, that of a woman ?
by showing, I mean, placing it before the sense of seeing.
Crat.
Entirely so.
Soc.
But what, may he not again, meeting with the same person, say to him, " This is your name ?" for a name, as well as a painting, is an imitation.
I mean this.
May he not say, " This is your name ?"
And after this, may he not present to the sense of hearing, it may be, an imitation of himself, by saying that it is a man;
and, it may be, an imitation of a female of the human species, by saying that it is a woman ?
Does it not appear to you, that it is possible for this to occur sometimes ?
Crat.
I am willing to concede it, Socrates;
and let it be so.
Soc.
You do well, my friend, if such be the state of the case;
for there is no need at present to contest much about it.
If, then, there is a distribution of this kind on this point4 (in names), we are willing to say5 that one of these speaks truly, but the other falsely. [102.]
And if this be the case, and it is possible to distribute nouns not correctly, and not to assign things adapted to each, 6 and (to assign) what is not adapted,6 it will be possible to do the very same thing with verbs.
And if it is possible to thus put down verbs and nouns, there is a necessity to do so with sentences likewise;
for sentences are, I think, but the putting together of those.
Or how say you, Cratylus ?
Crat.
Thus;
for you appear to me to speak beautifully.
Soc.
If then we assimilate the first names to letters, it is possible, as in the pictures of animals, to assign all the fitting colours and figures;
and on the other hand, not to assign all, but to leave some and to add others, more and greater.
7
Is it not so ?
Crat.
It is.
Soc.
Does not he then, who assigns every thing (proper),8 render beautiful both letters and resemblances;
but he, who adds or takes away, works out indeed letters and images, but such as are faulty ?
Crat.
Certainly.
Soc.
But what does the person imitating the essence of things through syllables and letters ?
Will not there be, ac­ cording to the same reasoning, a beautiful image, when he assigns every thing fitting ?
Now this is a name.
But if he is deficient even in small matters, or sometimes makes an addition, a resemblance will be produced, but not a beautiful one, so that some of the names will be beautifully formed, but others badly ?
Crat.
Perhaps so.[103.]
Soc.
Perhaps then the one will be a good artificer of names, but the other a bad one.
Crat. Certainly.
Soc.
Now was not the name of this person a name- founder ?
9Soc. Perhaps then, by Zeus, as in other arts, one name- founder is good and another bad, if we agree in what has been said before.
Crat.
It is so.
But you surely perceive, Socrates, that,10 when we assign the letters a and /3, and each of the elements to names, according to the grammatical art, if we take away, add, or change any thing, a name indeed is written by us, yet not properly;
or it is not written at all;
but there is immediately something else, if it suffers any thing of this kind.
Soc. (See), Cratylus, lest in viewing the matter in this way, we do not view it correctly.
Soc.
Perhaps such things as must necessarily be or not, when composed of a certain number, suffer what you say;
as in the case 11 of ten things, or whatever other number you will, if you take away or add aught, it immediately becomes some other number.
But (see) that there is not the same propriety in the case of any certain quality and of every resemblance, but a contrary one;
and that it is not necessary to assign to an image 12 all such as is that which one represents,12 if it is about to be a resemblance. [104.]
But consider if I say any thing to the purpose.
Would there not be two things, such as Cratylus and the resemblance of Cratylus, if any one of the gods should not only make a likeness of yourself in co­ lour and figure, as painters do, but should make all the inward parts such as yours are, and infuse into them the same soft­ ness, and warmth, and motion, and soul, and intellect, as is in you ;
and, in one word, fashion every thing as you have, and place such other things close to you,13 whether would there be one Cratylus, and a resemblance of Cratylus, or two Cratyluses ?
Crat.
It appears to me, Socrates, that there would be two.
Soc.
You see then, my friend, that it is necessary to seek after another propriety of a resemblance than what we just now spoke of;
and that there is no necessity, that, if any thing is taken away or added, for it to be any longer a re­ semblance.
Or do you not perceive how much resemblances want from being the same as their patterns ?
Crat.
I do.
Soc.
Those things then, 14 of which the names are names,14 would suffer a ridiculous fate through their names, if they were in every respect assimilated to them ;
for all things would be­ come double;
nor could one 15 tell of either of them, which was the thing itself and which the name.
Crat.
You speak the truth.[105.]
Soc.
Boldly then, my noble fellow, admit that one name is well imposed and another not;
nor compel it to have every letter, in order that it may be really such as is that, of which it is the name;
but suffer it to introduce a letter which is not fitting, and if (you suffer) a letter (to do so, suffer) like­ wise a noun in a discourse ;
and if a noun, (suffer) a sentence not suited to things to be introduced in a discourse, and not less a thing to be named and spoken of, so long as the type exists of the thing respecting which there is the discourse;
just as in the names of the elements, which, if you remember, I and Hermogenes just now discussed.
Crat.
I do remember.
Soc.
It is well.
For when this (the type)16 is there, al­ though it may not have all that is fitting, 17 yet the thing itself will be told 18 correctly, when all 19 (fitting) things (are there) ;
incorrectly, when only a few.17
But let us now, blessed man !
20 permit that the thing is spoken of,20 in order that we may not, like those who walk about late at night in Ægina, (owe a debt);
21 and thus appear to have arrived at the things by the truth itself, later than is becoming.
21
Or at least seek after όψιαίτερον του̃ δεόνος :
i. e.
Let us leave off conversing, I think, un­ some other propriety of name, and do not confess that an in­ dication by letters and syllables is a name :
for, if you admit both these assertions, you cannot be consistent with yourself[106.]
Crat.
But you appear to me, Socrates, to speak in a moderate manner;
and I so do put down (my vote).
22Soc.
Since then the same things23 seem good to us after these, let us consider this too.
24
We say, that if the name is about to be properly imposed, it ought to have fitting letters.
Soc.
And it ought (to have) the letters similar to things ?
Crat. Entirely so.
Soc.
Such then as are beautifully composed are composed in this manner.
But if any one is not correctly composed, it will, perhaps, for the most part, consist of fitting and similar letters, if it shall be a resemblance;
but it will have a portion not fitting, through which the name would be neither beauti­ ful nor beautifully formed..
Shall we speak 25 in this way, or otherwise ?
Crat.
There is no need, I think, to quarrel, Socrates;
al­ though it does not please me to say, that a name exists, and yet is not beautifully composed.
Soc.
Does this too not please you, that the name is an in­ dication of a thing ?
Crat.
It does please me.
Soc.
And does it not seem to you to be well said, that of names some are formed from the preceding, and others are themselves the first ?
Crat.
To me it seems so.[107.]
Soc.
But if the first names should be indications of certain things, have you any better method for their being indications than to make them as nearly as possible such as are the things which they ought to indicate ?
Or does the method which Hermogenes and many others speak of please you more, that names are conventional, and indicate (their meaning) to those who have agreed together and known beforehand the things (so named);
and that in this conventionality exists 26 the propriety of names;
and that it matters not whether any one agrees to call them, as they are at present imposed, or the con­ trary, (to call) that which is now 27 small o great w, and great ω small o?27
Which of these methods is agreeable to you?
Crat.
It is wholly and universally, Socrates, better to in­ dicate by a resemblance what one wishes to indicate, 28 but not by any chance 28 method.
Soc.
You speak well.
If then the name shall be similar to a thing, is it not necessary for the elements, from which a person shall have composed the first names, to be naturally similar to the things themselves ?
My meaning is this, Could any one put together a picture, which we have just now said is the resemblance of something existing, unless the pigments, from which the picture of living things is composed, were na­ turally similar to those which the art of painting imitates ?
Or is it impossible?
Crat. Impossible.[108.]
Soc.
In like manner then names would never become similar to any thing, unless the things, from which names are composed, possessed originally at first 29 some similitude to those of which the names are the imitations.
Now elements are the things from which names are to be composed.
Soc.
You therefore now take a share in the discourse which Hermogenes did a little before.
Come then, do we seem to you to have said correctly, or not, that the letter p is similar to a rushing-on, and to motion, and to hardness ?
Crat.
To me, correctly.
Soc.
And that the letter X (is similar) to the smooth and soft, and to what we just now mentioned?
Crat.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Do then both p and a seem to be similar to the same thing ?
and does that word indicate the same thing to them, ending with a p, as it does to us ending with a e ?
or does it indicate nothing to the others of us.30Crat.
It indicates one thing 31 to both.
Soc.
Whether in that p and ς are similar, or in that they are not?
Crat.
In that they are similar.
Soc.
Are they then similar in every way ?
Crat.
At least in indicating a rushing-on.
Soc.
But what as regards the inserted λ ?
Does it not in­ dicate the contrary of hardness ?[109.]
Crat.
Perhaps, Socrates, it is not correctly in­ serted;
just as in the names which you lately mentioned to Hermogenes, by taking away and adding letters where it was requisite.
And you then appeared to me (to act) 32 properly.
And now, perhaps, p ought to be inserted instead of X.Soc.
You say well.
What then, do we, as we are now speaking, mutually understand nothing, when one pronounces the (hard) word σκληρόν (hard) ?
And do you not under­ stand what I am saying ?
Crat.
I do, my very good friend, through custom.
Soc.
But in saying custom, do you think you are saying any thing different from convention ?
Or do you call custom any thing else than this, that when I pronounce this word, I understand it, and you know that I understand it?
Do you not mean this ?
Crat. Certainly.
Soc.
If then you know this, when I pronounce it, there is an indication (of something) 33 to you through me.
Crat. Certainly.
Soc.
From that which is dissimilar to what I have in mind, when I pronounce it, if \ is dissimilar34 to the σκληρότης, which you pronounce. [110.]
And if this is the case, what else is it, than that you have made a convention with yourself, and that the propriety of the name is a compact with your­ self;
since both similar and dissimilar letters, when meeting with custom and compact, indicate (the same thing)35 to you ?
But if custom is very far from being a compact, it will be no longer proper to say that similitude is an indication, but custom (rather):
for this, as it appears, indicates both by the similar and the dissimilar.
Since then, Cratylus, we agree in this­ for I will put down your silence as consent,36 it is surely necessary that compact and custom should contribute to the indication of what we have in mind and pronounce;
since if, 0 best of men!
you are willing to come to number, from whence do you think you will be able to attribute similar names to each number, if you do not permit this consent and compact of yours to possess some authority about the propriety of names ?
It pleases me, indeed, that names should be, as much as possible, similar to things;
but yet I fear, lest per- chance the attraction of this similitude be really very slight, according to the language of Hermogenes,37 and that it will be necessary for us to make use of that ridiculous thing, called compact, as regards a propriety of names;
since (words) 38 will be spoken perhaps in the most beautiful manner possible, when they shall be spoken (by letters) either entirely, or for the most part similar,38 that is, fitting;
but in the most ugly manner, when the contrary takes place.
But after these still tell me this.
What power do names possess with respect to us, and what beautiful effect must we say they produce ?[111.]
Crat.
To me, Socrates, they appear to teach;
and that it is without exception true, that he who knows the names, knows the things likewise.
Soc.
Perhaps,
Cratylus, you mean some such thing as this;
that when any one knows the quality of the name,-now it is of the same quality as the thing,-he then also knows the thing ;
since it is similar to the name ;
and that there is one and the same art in all things, which are similar to one another;
and in consequence of this you appear to me to assert, that he, who knows the names, knows also the things.
Crat.
You speak most truly.
Soc.
Come now, let us see what is this mode of teaching existing things, of which you are now speaking, and whether there is any other method, this however being the better;
39 or whether there is no other than this.
Which do you think is the case ?
Crat.
I think thus, that there is no other method;
but that this is the only one, and the best.
Soc.
But whether do you think that there is likewise the very same invention of things existing, (and)40 that he, who invented the names, invented also the things, of which there are the names ?
Or that it is necessary to seek and find another method, but to learn this ?
Crat.
Above all things to seek after and discover the very same method, as regards the same things.[112.]
Soc.
Come then, let us consider, 41Cratylus, if any one, while seeking after things, follows after names, and looks upon the quality of each, do you not consider41 that there is no small danger of his being deceived ?
Soc.
It is plain, that he, who first founded names, formed them, as we have said, such as he thought the things them­ selves were.
Is it not so ?
Crat.
Certainly.
Soc.
If then he did not think rightly, but formed them, as he fancied, 42what think you shall we suffer, who are his fol­ lowers ?42 Is it aught else, than for us to be deceived ?Crat. But (see), Socrates, lest this be not the case;
but that it is necessary for him, who founded the names, to have founded them knowingly;
for otherwise, as I before remarked, names would never have existed.
And let this be the greatest proof to you that he, who founded them, did not stumble from the truth.
For all things would not have thus chimed in with him.
Or, did you not perceive this yourself, when you were saying, that all names were composed 43according to the same, and for the same ?43[113.]
Soc.
But this apology, my worthy Cratylus, is of no weight.
For if the founder of names, after stumbling at first, forced the rest (of the words) to this point, and compelled them to chime in with himself, there is nothing strange ;
just as in the case of diagrams, in which sometimes the first mis­ take being trifling and unapparent, all the remaining parts, although very numerous, follow as they ought,44 and agree with each other.
There ought then at the beginning of every thing to be to every person much discussion and reflection, whether the principle is properly laid down or not;
and this being sufficiently examined, the rest, I say, will appear45 to follow it.
And yet I should not wonder if names chime in with each other.
For let us again consider, what we dis­ cussed before, that of the whole going on, and carried on, and flowing, the names signify to us, we say, the existence.
Do they seem to you to indicate any thing else than 46 in this way ?
Crat.
Very much so ;
and that they correctly signify this.[114.]
Soc.
Let us consider then again taking from out of them, in the first place, this name, 'Επιστήμη (science);
since it is doubtful, and seems to signify that ἵστησιν (it stops) our soul in acts, rather than that it is borne along with them;
and hence it is more proper to enunciate its beginning as now, 47 than by throwing out ε, πιστήμη, and to make an insertion in that of ι 47 in the place of that in ε. 43 In the next place, the word Βεβαιον (firm) is so called, because it is the imitation of a certain βάσις (basis), and στάσις (standing), but not of φορὰ (rushing-on).
Again, ‛Ιστορία (history) indicates surely that ἵστησι τὸν povv (it stops the flowing);
and the word (ΙΙιστὸν) (credible) indicates a thing ἱστα̃ν (causing to stand).48 Like­ wise Μνήμη (memory) indicates surely to every one, that there is a μονὴ (abiding) in the soul, but not a rushing-on.
And, if you will, 'Αμαρτία (error), and ∑νμΦορὰ (contingency), if any one follows them according to their name, will appear to be the same with the aforesaid 49 ∑ύνεσις (intelligence), and ’Επι­ στήμη (science), and all the other names connected with se­ rious matters. [115.]
Still further, ’Αμαθία (ignorance), and ’Ακολασια (intemperance), appear to be similar to these:
for α’μαθία (ignorance) appears to be the march of one going α̃μα θεᾦ (with a god);
but α’κολασία (intemperance) appears to be ἀκολουθία (a following) in all respects of things.
And thus, the names which we consider applicable to the basest things, would appear to be most similar to those applicable to the most beautiful.
And I think that any one would discover many others of this kind, if he busied himself about them;
from which he would imagine, that the founder of names did not indicate things going on and borne along, but such as have an abiding.
Crat.
And yet you see, Socrates, that he indicated many things by that (notion).
50Soc.
What is this, Cratylus ?
Shall we count the num­ ber of names as if they were (votes by) pebbles ?
And will their propriety consist in this, that the truth will be there, to which side soever the greater number of the names appear to point.
Crat.'
Is not this 51 reasonably?
Soc.
Not in the least, my friend.
But let us leave these points there,52 and consider whether you will agree or not with us in this. [116.]
Have we not lately acknowledged, that those who founded names on each occasion53 in cities, both Grecian and Barbarian, were name-founders, 54 and that the art, competent for this, is name-founding.
54Crat.
Entirely so.
Soc.
Tell me now, did they, who were the first name- founders, found the first names, while they knew the things to which they assigned their names, or did not know ?
Crat.
I think, Socrates, while they knew them.
Soc.
For surely, friend Cratylus, (they could not do so) while they did not know.
Crat.
It does not appear to me (that they could).
Soc.
Let us then return to the point from whence we digressed;
for you just now,55 in what has preceded, (stated,) if you recollect, that he, who founded names, must have previ­ ously known the things to which he assigned their names.
Are you then of this opinion still, or not ?
Soc.
Say you, that he who founded the first names, founded them knowing (the things) ?
Crat. Knowing them.
Soc.
From what names then did he either learn or find out the things, if the first names were not yet laid down ?
But, on the other hand, said we not, that it is impossible to learn and find out the things by any other way,56 than by learning or finding out ourselves the quality of names ?
Crat.
You appear to me, Socrates, to say something to the purpose.[117. ] Soc.
After what manner then shall we say that they knew ( the things) and founded their names ?
or that there were name-founders before any name whatever was laid down, and that they knew (the things),57 if indeed it is impossible to learn things otherwise than from names ?
Crat.
I think, Socrates, that the account respecting these matters is the most true, (which says) that a power greater than that of man assigned the first names to things, so that they must of necessity be in a correct state.
Soc.
Do you think then that he who laid down names, whether he was a certain daemon, or a god,58 would lay down things contrary to himself?
Or do we appear to you, to have just now said nothing to the purpose ?
Crat.
But (see) lest the other sort of these are not names.
Soc.
Which sort, thou best of men ?
those which lead to standing, or those to rushing-on ?
For, as we just now said, it will not be determined by their number.
Crat.
It is thus indeed just,59 Socrates.
Soc.
The names then being divided into factions, and some asserting that they are like the truth, and others that they are, how shall we decide ?
or to what (tribunal) go ?
For surely (we cannot go) to other names, different from these ;
60 for there are no others.
But it is plain that certain other things, besides names, must be sought after, which will show us, without names, which of these are true, after having pointed out, it is evident that,61 the truth of things.[118.]
Crat.
It appears so to me.
Soc.
It is possible, therefore, Cratylus, if such be the case, to learn, as it seems, existing things without names.
Crat.
It appears so.
Soc.
Through what else then do you expect to learn them ?
Is it through any thing else than what is reasonable and most just, through their communion with each other, if they are in any way mutually allied, and especially through themselves ?
For surely that, which is different from and foreign to these, would indicate something different and foreign,62 but not them ?
Crat.
You appear to me to speak the truth.
Soc.
But hold, by Zeus.
Have we not often confessed that names properly imposed are like the things, of which they are the names laid down, and are the resemblances of the things ?
Soc.
If then one may learn, as much as possible,63 the things through names, and likewise through themselves, which will be the best and clearest method of learning ?
To learn from a resemblance, both itself, whether it is a beautiful like­ ness, and likewise the truth, of which it is the resemblance ;
or from the truth, both itself, and whether its resemblance has been fashioned in a becoming manner ?
Crat.
There appears to me a necessity (to learn) from the truth.[119.]
Soc.
After what manner then one must learn, or find out existing things, is perhaps a greater task than for me and you to know;
and we must be content to confess this, that they are to be learned and sought for, not from the names, but much rather themselves from themselves ?
Crat.
It appears so, Socrates.
Soc.
Still further let us consider this;
that these many names tending to the same thing may not deceive us;
if,64 in reality, they who founded them considered all things as going-on ever and flowing—for they appear to me to have so considered-and if this were the case it would not thus (be well).65
But these men have fallen, as it were, into a certain vortex, and are themselves stirred about,66 and by dragging us along, hurl us into it.
For consider, 0 wondrous Cratylus, what I often dream about, whether we should say or not that there exists in the abstract the beautiful and the good, and each of the things existing.
Crat.
It appears to me, Socrates, that there does exist.
Soc.
Let us then consider that very thing, not as if a coun­ tenance or any thing of this kind were beautiful-for 67 all these appear to flow—but shall we say that beauty in the abstract is not always such as it is ?[120.]
Soc.
Can one then correctly say, if it is always secretly going away, first, that it is, and next, that it is of such a kind ?
Or is it necessary, while we are speaking about it, for it to become immediately something else, and to secretly withdraw itself, and to be such no longer.
Crat.
It is necessary.
Soc.
How then can that be any thing, which never subsists in a similar manner?
For if it ever subsists68 in a similar manner, during that time 69[when it subsists in a similar manner],69 it is evident that it does not change;
but, if it al­ ways subsists in a similar manner, and is the same, how can it change, or be moved, not having started out from its own form of existence ?
Crat.
By no means.
Soc.
But neither can it be known by any one.
For, as soon as that approaches which is about to know it, it becomes something else, and of a different kind, so that it cannot be known of what quality it is, or how it subsists.
Now surely no knowledge knows that, which it knows has no manner of subsistence.
Crat.
It is as you say.
Soc.
But neither, Cratylus, is it reasonable to say that knowledge exists, if all things change and fall away, and nothing abides.
For if this very thing [I mean know­ ledge]70 itself does not change and fall away, so as to be not knowledge, it would remain for ever [knowledge],71 and be knowledge;
but if the form itself of knowledge changes and falls away, it will at the same time change and fall away into a form different from knowledge, and will be knowledge no longer;
but if it always changes and falls away, it will always be not knowledge:
and by this reasoning there would be neither the thing about to know, nor that about to be known. [121.]
But if that always subsists which knows, then that which is known subsists, and the beautiful subsists, and the good subsists, and each single thing else of those ex­ isting;
71 nor do these appear to me to be really similar to the flowing, or rushing-on, of which we were speaking.
72
But whether these things subsist in this way, or in the way that the followers of Heraclitus and many others73 assert, (see) that it is by no means an easy subject of inquiry ;
nor is it the part of a person possessing much mind, to give himself up, and his own soul, to the study of names, (and) confiding74 in them and those that founded them, to make a bold assertion, as if he knew something, and to give a verdict against himself and existing things, as if nothing of any thing were sound,75 but that all things did, like (unsound)76 vessels of clay, let the water run through ;
and really, like persons labouring under a catarrh, fancy that things are so disposed, and 77 things are seized with a flowing and catarrh.77 [122.]
Perhaps then, Cratylus, this is the case, and perhaps not.
Hence it is proper to reflect upon this well and manfully,78 and not to receive any thing easily :
79 for as yet you are a young man, and possess the vigour of age ;
80 and if, after reflecting, you discover any thing, communicate it to me.
Crat.
And so I will do.
But rest assured, Socrates, that even now I am not without consideration;
but to me on re­ flection, and 81 having had trouble, it appears to be much more on that side81 as Heraclitus asserts.
Soc.
Do you then hereafter, my friend, when you return 82 hither, instruct me;
but now, as you have made preparations, proceed to the country;
and Hermogenes, here, will attend you.
Crat.
This shall be, Socrates;
and do you also endeavour to think upon these matters, as is meet.
83OF all the Dialogues of Plato the Parmenides is one of the most remarkable.
For not only does it turn upon questions relating to the most abstruse abstractions of metaphysics, but the manner too, in which the subject is handled, affords the best illustration of that “sapientiæ insanientis”—cleverness without sound sense-in the meshes of which Horace says he was at one time caught;
and to which he might have fairly applied his own graphic verse­ " Diruit, ædificat, mutat quadrata rotundis."
Pulls down, builds up, and changes squares for rounds.
By a chain of reasoning, where subtleties assume the garb of truths, conclusions are arrived at, so as to fully justify the fear, which So­ crates is here feigned to feel, that by pursuing metaphysical inqui­ ries, he would fall into the bottomless sea of trifling;
from which, as from Hades, according to Virgil, only they, " quos ardens evexit ad æthera virtus," Valour soul-burning to the skies hath borne, could hope to escape;
and, like Ulysses under the guidance of the goddess of wisdom, " Salvos se superas potuisse evadere ad auras."
In safety could to upper air return.
Such at least seems to have been the fate of every Commentator, who has ventured to enter the maze of mind, which Plato has with such art built up.
For neither Proclus and Damascius of the olden time, nor more recently Ficinus, nor, within the last hundred years, Taylor in England, Schleiermacher and others in Germany, nor Cousin in France, have been able to understand thoroughly them­ selves, and to explain satisfactorily to others, what is likely to re­ main for ever an intellectual puzzle.
It is then a fortunate circumstance for such as may be still dis­ posed to enter the labyrinth, that Stalbaum has furnished them with a clue, by prefixing to his edition of the Parmenides, published at Leipsig in 1848, four books of elaborate Prolegomena, running to 343 octavo pages.
For the reader will find there an ample and generally satisfactory discussion on various points connected with the doctrines promulgated in the dialogue.
Of these perhaps the most startling is the theory of Socher, who would have the world believe that the Parmenides was not written by Plato, but by some anonymous philosopher, to whom is to be attributed likewise the Sophist and Statesman.
In defence of this novel notion, which, says Stalbaum, Socher has been unable to support by a single argu­ ment of the least weight, Stalbaum himself has produced one, that Socher has omitted.
For according to Stalbaum, Aristotle has never made a direct allusion to the Parmenides ;
although there seem to be two indirect in Physic.
i. 3, and as many in Sophist.
El. c. ix.
But he might have added that, even if there were not a single one of any kind whatever, it is easy to understand why Aristotle would take no notice of Plato.
For the Stagirite could not have failed to perceive, that Plato was not so much giving expression to his own opinions, as putting into prose what Parmenides appears to have written in verse;
while, as regards the doctrines of Zeno, it was far better for Aristotle to draw them from the discourses of that phi­ losopher himself, than from the representations of a less faithful reporter.
With far greater reason have Schleiermacher and Ast imagined that the dialogue was left in an unfinished state.
Perhaps it would be safer to assert that it has come down to us ‘ shorn of its fair proportions.'
For it is hard to believe that Plato wanted either the power or inclination to put the finishing hand to a production, which exhibits the marks of no common mind.
Respecting the object of the Dialogue, Taylor, echoing, as usual, the sentiments of his favourite Proclus, fancies it was intended to exhibit a complete system of a philosophical theology;
and hence he has given it the title of " Parmenides, or on the Gods."
But here, as indeed through the whole of Plato, the two Neo-Platonists have preferred to float amidst the mists of mysticism, rather than breathe the generally clear empyreum of Plato's mind.
More correctly does Diogenes Laert., in ix. 13, entitle it Παρμενίδης ἢ περὶ ’Ιδεω̃ν, and, in iii. 50, class it with the Statesman, the Sophist, and Cratylus, as exhibiting proofs of the philosopher's powers as a dialectician.
Amongst the more recent translations of this Dialogue, is one in French by Schwalbé, Far. 1844, 12, where, in a note at the end of the argument, a reference is made to his " Parmenide, traduit et expliqué.”
But whether he has been able to overcome any of the difficulties arising from the corruptions of the text, I am unable to state, as I have never seen the work;
and a similar remark is applicable to the various publications quoted by Stalbaum, who has seldom taken the least notice of his countrymen's verbal criticism;
for, like Poppo in the case of Thucydides, he seems to think that the very words of the author have been miraculously preserved by a certain class of MSS.;
and that if they are not found there, it is merely labour in vain to endeavour to seek for them elsewhere;
and even in the Latin version of Ficinus, which was evidently made from a MS.
frequently superior to all that have been hitherto col­ lated by Bekker and others.
I suspect, however, that, like the ma­ jority of modern scholars in France, Schwalbé does not feel himself sufficiently strong in Greek to grapple with verbal difficulties;
which after all must be first successfully mastered, before a person pre­ sumes to talk of that, with which most readers are satisfied, the conventional sense of a passage which is felt to be difficult;
but which the genuine verbal critic knows to be difficult generally, only because it is corrupt.
As it is by no means easy, even with an attention constantly ex­ erted, to follow the subtleties that pervade the whole Dialogue, it will be perhaps not without its use to give Stalbaum's summary of the principal questions discussed, and of the conclusions to which they lead.
A.
If " the one " be supposed to exist-In the first place, it is necessary to consider it abstractedly by itself, and likewise in a double point of view, either as existing apart by itself, or united to " being;
" from whence there arise two con­ flicting propositions and conclusions-1.
If "the one" exists, it is nothing, p. 137, C.—142, B.2.
If " the one " exists, it is every thing, p. 142, B.—157, B.Secondly, we must consider the others;
" by which is meant every thing except the one" (p. 159, B. § 63);
and respecting these there arise two conflicting propositions and conclusions :
for,1.
If " the one" exists, “ the others" are all things, p. 157, B.- 159, B.2.
If "the one" exists, "the others" are nothing, p. 159, B.- 160, B.B. If " the not-one " be supposed to exist-In the first place, we must consider the not-one" abstractedly by itself, and likewise in a double point of view;
from whence there arise two conflicting propositions and conclusions-1.
If "the not-one" exists, and is understood in a relative sense with respect to "the others," it is by itself every thing, p. 160, B.—163, B.2.
If " the not-one " exists abstractedly, it is by itself nothing, p. 163, B.—164, B.So too we must consider " the others."
And hence there arise two conflicting propositions and conclusions-1.
If "the not-one" exists, "the others," as being freed from one-ness, are every thing, p. 164, B.—165, E.2.
If " the not-one" exists, " the others" are nothing, p. 165, E.Before, however, Parmenides, of whom Plato is the mouth-piece, entered upon these inquiries, there should have been given defini­ tions of the terms employed, or at any rate care should have been taken by Plato to use the same terms in always the same sense.
But so far is this from being the case, that, as remarked by Wytten­ bach, on Phædon.
p. 270, with whom Creuzer, on Plotinus Περὶ Κάλλους, p. 169 and 388, agrees, the same meaning is assigned to ἰδέαι and εἴδη ;
although Stalbaum, on Parmenid.
p. 128, E., at­ tempts to draw a nice distinction between them;
and so he does too in the case of ἄλλα and ἕτερα, in Prolegom.
p. 114, although he fairly confesses that those two words are sometimes used indis­ criminately.[1.]
WHEN we arrived at Athens from home, [from Clazo­ menæ,1] we happened to meet with Adeimantus and Glaucon2 in the place of assembly.
And Adeimantus, taking me by the hand, said, Hail, Cephalus ;
3 and if you are here in want of any thing over which we have any power, mention it to me.
Nay, I replied, I came for this very purpose, to beg of you a favour.
Will you then, says he, state your request ?
And I replied, What was the name of your brother by the same mother ?
for I do not remember it:
for he was a child when I first4 came here from Clazomenæ ;
and it is now a long time since then.
His father's name was, I think, Pyrilampes.5
Just so, says lie, and (his brother's) was Antipho.
But why do you especially ask ?,
These, my fellow-citizens, said I, are much given to philosophy, and have heard that this Antipho had frequently met with one Pythodorus,6 a friend of Zeno ;
and that having frequently7 heard from Pythodorus the conversa­ tions which Socrates,8 Zeno, and Parmenides held with each other, he had remembered them.
You speak the truth, says he.
These then, said I, we beg to hear.
This, says he, is no difficult matter.
For, although young, he has exercised himself greatly in them ;
since9 he now, after the example of his grand­ father, who is his namesake, applies himself much to equestrian affairs. [2.]
But, if it seems good,10 we will go to him:
for he is just gone home from hence;
and dwells hard by, in Melita.12
So saying, we went, and caught him at home, giving orders to a coppersmith to make him a bit.
But as soon as he was at liberty, and his brothers told him the cause of our coming, he recognised me through my previous sojourn at this place, and he embraced me;
and on our begging him to go through the conversations, he at first shrunk back, for he said it would be a troublesome task;
but afterwards, however, he detailed them.
Antipho then said that Pythodorus had told him that Zeno and Parmenides once came to the great Panathenæa ;
13 that Parmenides was then a rather old man, with very hoary locks, but of a handsome and noble aspect, and full sixty-five years of age ;
but that Zeno was nearly forty years old, very tall and graceful to behold, and was reported to have been the bosom friend of Parmenides ;
he said, too, that they lodged with Pythodorus, in the Cerameicus,14 beyond the walls;
whi­ ther also Socrates came, and many others with him, who were eager to hear the writings of Zeno ;
for then for the first time they had been brought by the (strangers);
but that Socrates was at that time very young. [3.]
That Zeno therefore himself read the writings to them;
and Pythodorus further related that Parmenides happened to be gone out;
and that of the discourses so read there remained only a very small portion, when he himself entered, and Parmenides with him and Aris­ totle,15 who was one of the Thirty (Tyrants);
and that he heard but a little at that time 16but that nevertheless he had (often) heard the (whole)16 discourse previously from Zeno.(He added) that Socrates, on hearing (the discourses), entreated him to read again the first hypothesis of his first discourse ;
and that, when it was read, Socrates said-How do you, Zeno, assert this, that if the things existing are many, the same things must be both similar and dissimilar ?
But that this is impossible.
For neither can things dissimilar be similar, nor things similar be dissimilar.
Is not this what you assert?
Zeno answered,
It is. [4.]
If then it is im­ possible for dissimilars to be similar, and similars dissimilar, it is impossible likewise for many things to exist ?
For if there were many, they would undergo impossibilities.
Is this what your discourses mean?
Is it any thing else than to contest, contrary17 to all that is (usually) asserted, that the many" does not exist?
And do you fancy that each of your discourses is a proof of this very doctrine ?
so that you conceive you have produced as many proofs as you have written dis­ courses, (to show) that "the many" does not exist?
say you thus, or do I not rightly understand you ?
No, said Zeno;
but you understand quite well the meaning of the whole work.
Then said Socrates, I perceive, Parmenides, that Zeno here wishes not only to be familiar with you in other bonds of friendship, but in your writings likewise.
For Zeno has, in a certain manner, written the same as yourself;
but by some change he endeavours to deceive us, as if asserting something different.
For you in your poems assert that the universe is "one;
" and you produce beautiful and excellent arguments in support of this opinion. [5.]
But Zeno says that " the many" does not exist, and he too produces very many and mighty proofs.
With regard then to the fact, that you assert that “ the one" exists, and he, that " the many" does not exist;
and that each of you speak so as to appear to have said not an atom of the same things, although you both assert nearly the same, it seems to me that what has been said by you is above us the rest.
18
It is so, Socrates, said Zeno.
But you do not per­ fectly comprehend the truth of my writings;
although, like the dogs of Laconia,19 you excellently pursue and track out what is there asserted.
But this in the first place lies hid from you, that this discourse is not in every respect of so solemn a cast, that it was written, as you say, with the set purpose20 of being concealed from mankind,21 as if effecting something great;
yet you have spoken something of what has happened;
and in truth, these writings are a kind of sup­ port to the doctrine of Parmenides against those who en­ deavour to ridicule it, (by saying) that if "one" exists, it would follow that such an assertion would suffer many things of a laughable kind, and contrary to itself.
This writing there­ fore contradicts those, who assert that " the many" exists;
and it gives in return these22 and many other reasons;
as it intends to show that the hypothesis, which (asserts) the ex­ istence of " the many," would suffer things still more laugh­ able than that, which says of 23if "many" exist, or of "one" existence,23 should a person go through the question sum­ ciently. [6.]
Through some such love of contention was this discourse composed by me, when a youth;
but some one stole it after it was written, so that it was out of my power to de­ liberate whether it should be brought out into the light or not.
24 Hence it lies hid from you, Socrates, that it was written by a young person through the love of contention, and not, as you fancy, by an older one, through the love of renown,24 since,25 as I have said, you have not made a bad guess.
I receive (the account), says Socrates;
and I think the case is as you have stated.
But tell me this too.
Do you not think there is a cer­ tain form of similitude, existing itself by itself?
and that another is contrary to this, which is dissimilar ?
and that you and me, and other things, which we call many, participate in these two ?
and that some things, participating in similitude, become similar in that respect and so far as they participate ?
but that others, (which participate) in dissimilitude, (become) dissimilar ?
and that those (which participate in) both (become) both ?
But if all things participate in both, which are contrary to each other, and that similar and dissimilar to each other exist through partici­ pating of both, what is the wonder ? [7.]
For, if any one should show that similars themselves become dissimilar, or dissimilars similar, I should think it would be a prodigy.
But if he shows'that such things, as participate in both of these, suffer likewise both these, it does not appear to me, Zeno, that there would be any thing absurd in the case;
nor again, if any one should show that all things are one, through their participat­ ing in " the one," and that very same things are many, through their participating in multitude.
But I should very much wonder if any one should show that what is one, is itself many, and on the other hand, that what are many is one;
and in a similar manner concerning all the rest.
It would indeed be worthy of wonder, if he should show that both the genera themselves and the species in them suffered these contrary affections.
But what is there wonderful, if any one should show that I am both one thing and many, by saying, that when he wishes to prove I am many, that the parts on the right hand of me are different from those on the left, the anterior from the posterior, and in like manner the upward from the downward parts—for I think that I participate in multitude-but when (he desires to show that) I am one, he will say, that, we being seven in number, I am one man, and participate in "the one"?
so that he would by this means prove both to be true.
If then any one should en- deavour to show that stones, wood, and all such things, are both many and one, we would say that he shows such things as are many and one, but not that the one" is many, nor the many" one;
and that he does not say any thing wonder­ ful, but what we should all confess. [8.]
But if any one should, in the first place, distribute the species of things, con­ cerning which I have just been speaking, separating them according to their very selves, such as similitude and dissimili­ tude, and multitude and the one, and standing and motion, and the rest of this kind, and should afterwards show that these things can in themselves be mixed and separated, I should, Zeno, says he, be marvellously astonished.
But it appears to me that you have very manfully made this your business;
yet I should be much more astonished if any one could solve this very same difficulty, which is involved on all sides in species themselves;
and, as you have gone through in the case of things sensible to the sight, so (should he go through) in the case of things comprehended by reason.
On Socrates saying this, Pythodorus observed that he thought that Parmenides and Zeno were at each remark an­ noyed;
26 but they gave the greatest attention to him, (Socrates,) and frequently looking at each other smiled, as wondering at Socrates.
Hence on his ceasing to speak, Parmenides said-
How worthy, Socrates, are you of admiration27 for your ardour in what relates to reasoning !
Tell me then, have you thus separated, as you say, certain species apart by themselves, and likewise those, that participate in them, apart ?
And does similitude itself appear to you to be separate from that simili­ tude which we possess,28 and "one" and "many," and all such other things as you have just now heard of from Zeno ?
To me, said Socrates, it does. [9.]
And does it appear to you, (said Parmenides,) that these things too exist, such as a species of justice, itself by itself, and of the beautiful and the good, and all things of such a kind ?
Yes, says he.
What, is there a species of man separate from us and all the things, such as we are, 29 some species itself of man,29 or of fire, or water ?
I have often, said (Socrates), been in doubt, Parmenides, on this point;
whe­ ther it is necessary to speak of these in the same manner as of those, or in a different manner.
And do you doubt, Socrates, whether it is necessary to say that of each individual thing, as may appear to be ridiculous, such as hair, clay, and filth, or any thing else the most worthless and vile, there is a species apart, as being different from those which we take into our hands?
By no means, said Socrates;
but (I think)30 that things are as we see them:
but (consider) lest it be not very absurd to think that there is a certain form of these ?
Al­ ready it has at some time disturbed me, lest there be some­ thing of the same kind in the case of every thing.
But afterwards, when I have been standing31 in this way, I rapidly .
take myself off, fearing lest, falling into an abyss of trifling,32 I should utterly perish and be lost.
But, returning from thence33 to what we have just now asserted as possessing species, I have passed my time in busying myself about them. [10.]
For, said Parmenides, you are as yet but a young man, Socrates, and Philosophy has not yet laid hold of you, as she will yet lay hold of you, according to my thinking, when you shall not despise any of these things:
but now, through your juvenile age, you still look to the opinions of men.
Tell me then this.
Does it appear to you, as you say, that there are certain species, of which these the rest34 participating retain their appellations;
as, for instance, that such things as participate in similitude are similars;
in great­ ness, are great;
and in beauty and justice, are beautiful and just?
Entirely so, said Socrates.
Does not every thing which participates, either participate in the whole species, or only in a part of it ?
Or can there be any other mode of participation besides these?
How can there be?
said (So­ crates).
Does it then appear to you that the whole species in each individual of many things is one ?
Or how ?
What, said Socrates, prevents it, Parmenides, from being so?35
Being, therefore, one and the same in things many and se­ parate from each other, it will be36 at the same time whole, and thus it will be separate itself from itself.
It would not be so, said (Socrates), if, just as the day, being one and the same, is present in many places at the same time, and yet is not the more separate from itself;
in the same manner,37 if every species may be at once one and the same in all. [11.]
Pleasantly indeed, said Parmenides, do you, Socrates, make one and the same thing to be in many places;
just as if, covering many men with a sail-cloth, you should say that there is one whole over many ;
or do you think that you would not assert something of this kind?
Perhaps so, said So­ crates.
Will then the whole sail-cloth be over each person, or one part of it over one person, and another over another ?
A part.
Then, said Parmenides, these species, Socrates, are divisible;
and that which participates in them, would par­ ticipate only in a part of them;
and there would no longer be in each a whole, but only a part of each.38
So it seems.
Are you then willing to assert that one species is in truth divided, and that it is still one?
By no means, said (So­ . crates).
For see, said (Parmenides), whether, if you should divide magnitude itself, and if each of the many things which are great, should be great by a part of magnitude, less than magnitude itself, it would not appear absurd.
Entirely so, said (Socrates).
What then ? 39 Will each little thing, by taking a part of the equal, have that, which, to a thing less than the equal itself, will be the thing having equal to some thing ?39 It is impossible. '40
But some one of us will possess a part of the small;
and the small itself will be greater than this, inasmuch as it is a part of itself;
and thus the small itself will be greater:
but that to which the part taken away shall be added, will become smaller, but not greater than before. [12.]
This, said Socrates, cannot be.40 After what manner then, Socrates, can the other things participate in species, if they are able to participate neither according to parts, nor according to wholes ?
It does not, said (Socrates), appear to me, by Zeus, to be at all an easy matter to define in a question of this kind.
What then ?
How stands the case with you in regard to this ?
To what ?
I think that you consider every species as one, on some such account as this.
When some things many in number seem to you to be great, there seems perhaps to be one and the same idea to you, who survey them all;
from whence you con­ sider the great to be one.
You speak the truth, said So­ crates ;
but what, as regards the great itself, and the other things which are great, if you look upon them all in like manner through the soul, will not, on the other hand, a cer­ tain one thing appear to you great, through which all these necessarily seem to be great ?
It seems so.
Another species of magnitude will then become apparent, besides magnitude itself and its participants:
and in addition to all these, another (species), through which all these become great;
each of your species will no longer be one, but infinite in number.
But, said Socrates, (Have a care,) Parmenides, lest each of these species be nothing more than a mental conception, and that it is not meet for it to exist any where but in souls.
For thus each would be one, nor would the consequences, just now mentioned, occur. [13.]
What then, said (Parmenides), is each of these mental conceptions one, and is there a mental conception of nothing ?
This, (said Socrates,) is impossible.
It is then of something ?
Yes.
Of a being or of a non-being ?
Of a being.
Is it not of some one thing, 41 which that mental conception understands as being a one certain idea over all things ?41 Yes.
Will not then that species, which is under­ stood to be one, be always the same over all things ?
This, on the other hand, seems to be necessary.
But what, said Par­ menides, Is it not necessary, since you say that the other things participate in species, either that each should seem to you to be from mental conceptions, and that all of them under­ stand, or that being mental conceptions, they understand nothing ?
But this, said Socrates, has no reason for it.
But this appears, Parmenides, to me to be for the most part the case.
That these species stand, as it were, patterns in nature;
but that the other things are similar to them, and are their resemblances:
and that this participation of species by the other things, is nothing more than an assi­ milation to them.
If then any thing, said (Parmenides), becomes similar to the species, can it be possible for that species not to be similar to the assimilated, so far as it is ren­ dered similar ?
Or is there any method by which the similar would not be similar to the similar ?
There is not.
Is there not, therefore, a great necessity for the similar to participate in one and the same form as the similar ?
There is a neces­ sity.
But will not that, through the participation of which the similars become similars, be species itself?
Entirely so. [14.]
It is not, therefore, posssible for a thing to be similar to the species, nor the species to another.
For otherwise an- other species will always appear by the side of the species;
and should this again become similar to another, another (would appear) ;
and a new species would never cease to be continually produced, if the species should be produced similar to its participant.
You speak most truly.
Hence, then, the other things do not participate in species through similitude;
but it is necessary to seek after something else, through which they do participate.
So it seems.
See you then, Socrates, said (Parmenides), how great is the difficulty, should any one define species as existing themselves by themselves ?
Very much so.
Know then well, said (Parme­ nides), that you do not apprehend at all, so to speak, how great is the difficulty, if, separating each of the things existing, you should lay down one species.
How so, said (Socrates) ?
There are many and other (doubts), said (Parmenides);
but this is the greatest.
Should any one assert that it is not proper for the species to be known, if they are such as we have said they ought to be, a person would not have it in his power to de­ monstrate to the party asserting this, that he is deceived ;
un­ less he who doubts is skilled in many thngs, and is of a good disposition, and willing to follow the demonstrator, while busied in many (proofs), and these far-fetched;
while he who holds, as a matter of necessity, that they are not to be known, will be unpersuaded. [15.]
In what way, Parmenides?
said Socrates.
Because, Socrates, I think that both you and (any)42 other person, who lays down that the essence of each species exists itself by itself, would allow, in the first place, that not one of them exists in us.
For, said Socrates, how could it still exist itself by itself?
You speak well, (Par­ menides) said.
But do not such ideas as are, with relation to each other, such as they are, possess also their essence with respect to themselves, and not with reference to things exist­ ing among us, whether they are resemblances, or in whatever manner a person may set them down;
by the names of each of which, while we participate in them, we are called ?
but the things existing among us, and which are synonymous to those, exist, on the other hand, with reference to themselves, and not with relation to the species;
and belong to themselves, but not to those which receive from them a common appel­ lation.
How say you ?
replied Socrates.
As if, said Parme­ nides, some one of us should be the master or slave of any one;
43 for a slave is surely not the slave of a master, who is ab­ stractedly speaking a master, nor is a master the master of a slave, who is abstractedly speaking a slave;
43 44 but being a man, both these are of a man ;
44 45but master itself is that, which it is from its relation to slavery itself;
and slavery itself is in a similar manner slavery with reference to mastery it­ self.
45
But what are in us do not possess any power, as regards those, nor those any, as regards us;
but they exist, as I say, from themselves, and with relation to themselves ;
and those by us in a similar manner with relation to themselves.
Or do you not understand what I am saying ?
I understand, said Socrates, perfectly. [16.]
46 Would not science itself, said (Parmenides), which is a thing science, be a science of that itself which is a thing truth.
46 Certainly.
But would each of the sciences which exists really, be the science of each of the things which exist really, or not ?
Yes, it would.
But would not the science which is among us be the science47 of the truth which is?
And again, would not each science that is among us, turn out to be the science of things existing among us ?
It is neces­ sary.
But, as you have admitted, we do not possess species themselves, nor is it possible for them to exist among us.
For it is not.
But each of the genera, which really exist, are surely known by the species itself of its proper science.
Yes.
But this species we do not possess.
For we do not.
No species therefore is known by us, since we do not participate in science itself?
It appears it is not.
Therefore the beauti­ ful itself, which exists really, and the good itself, and all the things which we have considered as being ideas, are unknown to us?
It nearly seems so. [17.]
Now look at this, which is yet still more dreadful.
What?
Would you say, or not,48 that, if there is a certain species itself of science, it would be49 much more accurate than the science which is among us ?
and beauty (itself),50 and every thing else in the same manner?
51 Certainly.
If then any thing else participates in science it­ self, would you not say that no one possesses the most accurate science more than a god ?
It is necessary (to say so).
But will a god, possessing science itself, be able to know the matters among us ?
Why not ?
Because, said Parmenides, it has been, Socrates, confessed by us, that those species do not possess the power, which they possess, in relation to those among us, nor those among us in relation to them;
but that each (possess their power) in relation to themselves.
It was so confessed.
If then there is this52 the most exact mastery with the deity, and this the most exact science, their53 mastery will not rule over us, nor will (their) science know us, nor aught of the things among us;
and similarly we do not rule54 over them by our rule, nor do we know aught of things di­ vine55 by our science. [18.]
56[And again, according to the same reasoning, they will neither, though gods, be our masters, nor have any knowledge of human affairs].56 But (have a care), said (Socrates), lest the reasoning be not very wonderful, should it deprive the deity of the power of knowing.
These, said Parmenides, and very many others, Socrates, in addition to these, it is necessary for the species to undergo, if there are these ideas of things existing, and if any one shall define each species, as being something itself;
so that the hearer may be in a difficulty, and, doubting, contend that such species do not exist;
or if they do exist ever so much, that there is a great necessity for them to be unknown by human nature;
and that he who says so, seems to say something to the pur­ pose ;
and to be, as we just now stated,57 a person wonderfully difficult to be persuaded, and that there is (need)58 of a person naturally clever to be able to perceive that there is a certain genus of each thing, and an essence existing itself by itself:
but of a person still more wonderful, who shall discover (him­ self),59 and be able to teach another to distinguish60 all these in a sufficient manner.
I agree with you, Parmenides, said Socrates, for you speak entirely to my mind.
But however, said Parmenides, If any one, Socrates, on the contrary, will not admit that there are species of ex­ isting things, looking to what has been now said, [and to other things of the same kind,61] 62 nor will define the species of each thing as being something itself he will not have where to turn his thoughts, while he does not permit the idea of each existing thing to be always the same;
and by this means he will entirely destroy the power of speaking logically.
Some such thing as this you seem to me to have perceived even more.
63 You speak the truth, Socrates said. [19.]
What then will you do with respect to philosophy ?
Where will you turn yourself, if these are unknown ?
Indeed I do not seem to myself to see clearly at present.
Before you exercised yourself, said (Parmenides), you endeavoured,64 Socrates, be­ times65 to define what is the beautiful, the just, and the good, and each of the other species:
for I lately perceived, and I heard you discoursing with this Aristotle here.
Beautiful and divine, be assured, is that ardour of yours, by which you rush onwards to rational conversations.
But draw yourself out,66 and exercise yourself (still) more while you are yet young, on account of (the ardour) appearing useless to the many, and being called by them a mere idle talking;
for if you do not, the truth will escape you completely.
What then, said (Socrates), is the method of the exercise, Parmenides ?
That, said (Parmenides), which you have heard from Zeno, except this,67 I admired you while asserting, con­ trary to Zeno,68 that you did not permit (a person) in the things seen (by the eye) to look into the aberration about them, but about those, which a person could especially lay hold of by reason, and would consider to be species.

For it appears to me, said (Socrates), that in this way it would be not difficult to prove that the things existing are both similar and dis­ similar, and suffering any other state whatever.
You speak well, said (Parmenides) :
but it is necessary for you to do this likewise;
not only to make a supposition, whether each thing exists, and to consider the consequences from the supposition, but also, if it does not exist, to suppose this same thing,70 if you wish to be more exercised (in this matter).
How say you, said (Socrates) ? [20.]
As if, said (Parmenides), you should wish to (exercise yourself) in the hypothesis which Zeno has laid down, that, " if there are many things," what must happen both to "the many," with respect to themselves, and to " the one;
" and to "the one " with respect to itself, and to "the many:
" and “ if many are not," to consider again what will happen both to " the one " and to " the many," with respect to themselves and to each other:
and again, if you made the supposition " if simi­ litude is," or " if it is not," what will on each supposition happen both to the things supposed and to the others, with respect to themselves and to each other;
and the same reasoning (must be) concerning " the dissimilar," and " motion ” and " standing," and "generation" and "destruction," and "entity" and " non­ entity and, in one word, concerning every thing which you suppose either to be or not'to be, or suffering any other state whatever, it is necessary to consider what will happen both to itself and to each individual of the other things, which you may select, and towards many, and towards all things in a similar manner ;
and again, how the other things are related to themselves, and to another, which you may select, whether you suppose that, which is the subject of your supposition, as existing or not existing;
if you are about to be exercised in a masterly manner, and to perceive thoroughly the truth.
You are speaking, Parmenides, of an impossible occupation, said Socrates, nor do I very well understand you.
But why do you not go through a certain supposition yourself, that I may learn the better?
You enjoin, Socrates, said (Parmenides), a great task upon a man so old as myself.
But why do not you then, Zeno, said Socrates, go through it for us ?
And then (Py­ thodorus) stated that Zeno laughing said—[21.]
Let us,
So­ crates, request Parmenides himself;
for (see) lest it be no trifling matter, as he says;
or do you not perceive how great a task you are enjoining ?
If then we were many it would not be pro­ per to make such a request;
for it is unbecoming, especially for a man of such an age, to speak things of this kind before many.
For the many are ignorant that, without this discur­ siveness and wandering through all things, it is impossible for the mind to meet with the truth, and to keep possession of it.
I,therefore, Parmenides, do, together with Socrates, make the request in order that I too may after a long time hear it.
On Zeno so saying, Antiphon said that Pythodorus related that he too, and Aristotle, and the rest, entreated Parmenides to de­ clare what he had said, and not to do otherwise.
There is a ne­ cessity then, said Parmenides, for me to comply;
although I seem to myself to suffer the fate of the horse of Ibycus, to whom as being a competitor and rather old, when about to contend in a chariot race, and fearing through his experience for the event, Ibycus71 compares himself by saying, " Thus I too, who am so old, am forced to the contests of love to go;
” so I, upon recollection, appear to myself to feel a great fear how I, at such an age, must swim through such and so great a sea 72 of words ;
73 yet I must gratify you, since, as Zeno says, we are by ourselves.
Whence then shall we begin ;
and what shall we first of all suppose? [22.]
Or are you willing, since it seems good to play a business-like game, for me to begin from myself, and my own hypothesis, by supposing, with respect to "the one itself," if one "is," or "is not," what must happen ?
By all means, said Zeno.
Who then, said (Parmenides), will answer me?
Will the youngest?
For he will have very little trouble ;
for he will answer what he thinks;
and his answer will be at the same time a resting-place for me.
I am prepared, said Aristotle, in this point,75 for you, Parmenides;
for you mean me, when speaking of the youngest.
Ask me then, as one who will an­ swer you.
Be it so, said (Parmenides).
If " one" is, is it not that " the one " will not be many ?
For how can it be?
There must then be of it neither a part nor a whole.
How so ?
Is not a part a part of a whole ?
Yes.
But what is a whole?
Would not that, to which no part is wanting, be a whole ?
Entirely so.
On both sides then " the one" would be (composed) of parts, as being a whole and having parts ?
It is necessary.
And so in both ways " the one " will be many, but not one.
True.
But it must be not many, but one.
It must.
Hence, it will neither be a whole, nor possess parts, if "the one" is one.
It will not. [23.]
If then it has no parts, it has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end;
for such as these would be its parts ?
Right.
But end and beginning are the bounds of each thing ?
How not ? "
The one " therefore is infinite, if it has neither beginning nor end ?
Infinite.
And therefore with­ out figure;
for it neither participates of the round nor the straight.
How so ?
For the round figure75 is that, the ex­ tremities of which are on all sides equally distant from the middle.
Yes.
And the straight is that, the middle of which is situated before both the extremes ?76 It is so.
Would not then “ the one " have parts, and be many, whether it par­ ticipates in a straight figure or a round ?
Entirely so.
It is therefore neither straight nor circular, since it has not parts.
Right.
And being such, it will be no where;
for it would be neither in another, nor in itself.
How so ?
Being in another, it would somehow be surrounded circularly by that, in which it might be, and it would be touched by many things in many places.
But it is impossible for " the one," being without parts, and not participating in a circle, to be touched in a circle in many places.
It is impossible. [24.]
But being itself in itself, it would be likewise surrounding itself;
since it is no other than itself, 77 if it were in itself :
77 for it is impossible for a thing to be in that, which does not surround it.
It is impossible. [24.]
Would not then that, which contains, be one thing, and that which is contained, another ? 78
For the same whole cannot at the same time suffer and do both these :
78 and thus “the one " would no longer be one, but two.
It certainly would not. " The one," therefore, is not any where, being neither in itself nor in another.
It is not.
But consider, whether, being in this state, it is possible for it to stand or be moved.
Why can it not ?
Because be­ ing moved it would be carried on or be changed ;
79 for these alone are the kinds of motion.
Certainly.
But the one" being changed from itself, it is impossible surely for it to be still one.
Impossible.
It is not then moved as regards a change.
It appears it is not.
But is it by being carried on ?
Perhaps so.
And yet if " the one" is carried on, it would be either carried round in the same circle, or it would change from one place to another.
Necessarily so.
But ought not that, which is carried round in a circle, to stand firm in the middle, and to have the other parts of itself carried about the middle ?
But what method is there for that, which has neither a middle nor parts, to be carried circularly about the middle ?
There is none.
But by changing its position it is some­ times here and other times there, and is moved ?
If in­ deed it (were moved).80
Has it not appeared to be impos­ sible for “ the one " to be in any thing ?
It has. [25.]
Is it not much more impossible for it to be in the act of being (in any thing) ?81 I do not understand how.
If any thing is in the act of being in any thing, is it not necessary for it to be not yet in it, since it is in the act of being;
nor yet entirely out of it, if it be already in the act of being ?
It is necessary.
If then any other thing suffers this state, that alone would suffer it, which possesses parts;
for one part of it would be in that thing, but another out of it;
but it will not be possible for that, which has no parts, to be by any means wholly within or without any thing.
It is true.
But is it not much more impossible for that, which neither has parts nor happens to be a whole, to be in the act of being in any thing;
since it can neither exist in the act of being according to parts, nor ac­ cording to a whole ?
So it appears.
Hence it does not change its place, neither by going any where, nor in the act of being in any thing, nor in being carried round in the same, nor in being changed.
It does not appear it does. " The one " there­ fore is immovable, according to every kind of motion.
Im­ movable.
But we have likewise asserted that it is impossible for the one" to be in any thing.
We have said so.
It can never therefore be in " the same."
Why so?
Because it would be already in that,83 in which it is (as if) in "the same."83 Entirely so.
But the- one itself84 can neither be in itself nor in another.
It cannot.
The one therefore is never in "the same."
It does not appear that is.
But that which is never in "the same," is neither at rest nor stands still.85
For it cannot. " The one," therefore, as it appears, neither stands still nor is it moved. [26.]
86It does not appear indeed.86
Nor will it be the same either with “different,”87 or with itself ;
nor again different either from itself or from "different."
How so ?
Being different from itself, it would surely be different from " one," and so would not be " one."
True.
And if it should be the same with " different," it would be that (" dif. ferent"), and would not be itself;
so that " one" would thus be not what it is, but different from " one."
It would not in­ deed.
88 It will then be not the same with “different” or different from itself ?
It will not.88
But it will not be dif­ ferent from "different," while it is "one."
For it does not belong to " one" to be different from any thing, but to be " dif­ ferent" alone, and to nothing else.
Right.
In consequence, then, of its being " one," it will not be “ different ;
” or do you think (it can) ?
Certainly not. 89 But if it is not (different) through this, neither will it be through itself.
89
But if not different in any way, it will be different from nothing.
Right.
Nor yet will it be the same with itself.
How not ? 90
The nature of “ the one" is surely this of " the same.
"90 How ?
Because, when any thing becomes the same with any thing, it does not become one.
But what then ?
That, which be­ comes the same with many things, must necessarily become many, and not one.
True. 91
But if "the one" and the same" differed91 in no respect, whenever any thing became "the same," it would always become "one," and whenever it (became) " the one " it ( would be) " the same."
Entirely so. [27.]
If then the one" shall be "the same" to itself, it will not be " one" to itself;
and thus " one" will not be " one."
But this indeed is impossible.
It is impossible, therefore, for " the one " to be either different from " different," or the same with itself.
Impossible.
And thus the one" would be neither different nor the same, either with respect to itself or different.
It would not.
But neither will it be similar to any thing, or dissimilar either to itself or to different.
Why so?
92Be­ cause the " similar " somehow has the accident of92 " same."
Certainly.
But it has been seen that "the same" is naturally separate from " the one."
It has been so seen.
But if " the one" should suffer any thing apart from being " the one," it would suffer the being more than one;
but this is im­ possible.
Certainly.
In no respect then can " the one" suf­ fer the being " the same," either with another or with itself.
It does not appear it can.
Nor can it therefore be similar either to another or to itself.
It seems it cannot.
Nor yet has "the one" suffered the being “different ;
” for thus it would suffer the being more than one.
For (it would) more.
But that which suffers the being different either from itself or from another, will be dissimilar either to itself or to another, if that which suffers the being the same is similar.
Right.
But " the one," as it appears, since it in no respect suffers the being " different," would in no respect be dissimilar either to itself or to another.
It would not. " The one," therefore, would be neither similar nor dissimilar, either to another or to itself.
It does not appear (that it would). [28.]
But since it is such, it will neither be equal nor unequal, either to itself or to another.
How so?
Being equal, it would be of the same measure as that to which it is equal.
Certainly.
But being greater or less than the things, with which it is com­ mensurate, it will have more measures than the less quanti­ ties, but fewer than the greater.
Certainly.
But of those, with which it is incommensurable, with respect to the one part, it will consist of lesser;
and with respect to the other, of greater measures.
How should it not ?
Is it not therefore impossible for that which does not participate in " the same," to consist either of the same measures, or of any thing else whatever the same ?
It is impossible.
•
It would therefore be equal neither to itself nor to another, if it does not consist of the same measures.
It appears not.
But if it consists of more or fewer measures, it will be of as many parts as there are measures;
and thus again it will no longer be " one," but as many as there are measures.
Right.
But even if it should be of one measure, it would become equal to that measure.
But it has been seen to be impossible for one (itself)93 to be equal to any thing.
It has been seen. [29.] " The one" therefore neither participates in one measure, nor in many, nor in a few, nor in any way participates in "the same," nor will it ever, as it seems, be equal to itself or to another;
nor, on the other hand, greater or less either than itself or " differ­ ent."
It is in every respect so.
But what,94 does the one " seem (to be) older or younger (than any thing), or to be of the same age (with any thing) ?
Why should it not ?
If it had in any respect the same age, either with itself or with another, it would participate in the similitude and equality of time, in which properties we have asserted "the one"95 does not participate 96 [either similitude or equality].96
We so as­ serted.
And this also we asserted, that it participates neither in dissimilitude nor inequality.
Entirely so.
How then, being such, can it be either older or younger (than any thing),97 or of the same age with any thing ?
By no means. " The one " therefore will be neither younger, nor older, nor of the same age, either with itself or with another.
It does not appear it would.
Would it not then be impossible for “ the one" to exist at all in time, if it be such ?
Or, is it not necessary that, if any thing exists in time, it should always become older than itself?
It is necessary.
But is not the older always older than the younger?
What then ?
That which is in the act of being older than itself, is at the same time in the act of being younger than itself, 98ifit is about to have that (through) which it is in the act of being older.98 [30.]
How say you ?
Thus.
It is requisite that nothing should exist in the act of being at variance one with an­ other, 99when it is already at variance;
99 but that being now at variance, to be so now;
and having been, to have been so (formerly), and being about to be, to be so (hereafter);
100but being in the act, to neither have been, nor to will be, nor to be at all at variance,100 but to be in the act, and not otherwise to exist.
It is necessary.
But the older is at variance with the younger, and with nothing else.
Certainly.
Hence, that which is in the act of being older than itself, must necessarily at the same time be in the act of being younger than itself
It seems so.
1But likewise to be in the act of being 1 for a time not longer than itself, nor shorter;
but for a time equal to itself to be in the act of being, and to be, and to have been, and to be about to be.'
For these are necessary.
It is necessary therefore, as it appears, for such things as are in time, and participate in some such thing, to be, each of them, [itself]2 the same age with itself, and to be in the act of being both older at the same time and younger than itself.
It nearly seems so.
But in none of these accidents is there any share for " the one."
There is no share.
Neither then has it any share of time, nor does it exist in any time. [31.]
It does not, indeed, as the reason­ ing holds.
What then, do not the terms " was," and " has been produced," and " was in the act of being," seem to sig­ nify a participation in what formerly existed.
3
Very much so.
And do not the terms " will be," and " will be in the act of being," and will be generated,"6 (signify a participation in time) that is about to be hereafter?
4 Yes.
And do not the terms " is," and “is in the act of being," (signify a par­ ticipation) in time that is now present?
5
Entirely so.
If then “ the one " participates not at all in any time, it never has been, nor has been in the act of being, nor was [ever]7 nor 8 [has it been now generated, nor]8 is it in the act of being, nor is, nor will be in the act of being hereafter, nor will be generated, nor will be.
It is most true.
Is it possible then for any thing to participate in being, except according to some one of these ?
It is not.
In no way then does “ the one"9 participate in being.
It appears not.
"The one" therefore in no way is.
It seems not.
Nor is it then in such a state as to be one ;
for it would be a being, and participate in being;
but, as it seems, the one neither is one, nor is it at all, if one must trust to reasoning of this kind.
It seems nearly so.
But to that which is not, can there be any thing either for itself or from itself?
How can there?
Hence there is not for it a name, or discourse, or any science, or perception, or opinion.
It appears not.
Hence it cannot either be named, or spoken of, or conceived by opinion, or known, nor does it perceive10 any thing of those really ex­ isting.
So it seems.
Is it possible then for this to be the case respecting " the one?"
It seems to me not possible.[32.]
Are you then willing for us to return again from the beginning to our supposition, if by chance any thing shall, appear to us, on returning, in a different light ?
I am very willing.
Did we not say then, that if " one is," whatever12 may be the consequences from that supposition, we must admit them.
Is it not so ?
Yes.
Consider now from the beginning.
If " one is," is it possible for it to be, and yet not participate in being ?
It is not.
Would not being then be a property of " the one," although not the same as “ the one ? " for, 13 (if it were the same,)13 it 14 would not be the being of it,14 nor would the one" participate in being;
but it would be all one to say "one is," and "one one."
But now our supposition is not, " if one (is) one," what must be the consequence, but " if one is."
Is it not so ?
Entirely so.
Is it not then that15 the term "is " means something different from the term “one?”
Necessarily.
If then a person sum­ marily asserts that " one is," would this be no other assertion than that the one participates in being.
Certainly.
Let us say then again, if " one is," what will be the consequence ?
Consider then, if it is not necessary for this supposition to signify that " one" is existing of such a kind as to possess parts?
How?
Thus.
If the term “ it is " is said of " the one being," and " the one " (said) of " the being which is one," and both being and the one are not16 the same, 17 but belong to that same thing which wc have supposed to be " the one,”17 is it not necessary that the whole being one should be it,18 but that its parts should be "one" and "being?"
It is ne­ cessary. [33.]
Whether then should we call each of these parts a part alone ?
19
Or must we call a part a part of the whole ?
Of the whole.19
Whatever then is one, is a whole, and possesses a part.
Entirely so.
What then, 20 of these parts of the one being both "one" and "being," do either desert each the other, so that " one" is wanting to “ being," and “being " wanting to " one ” ?20 It would not be.
Again, each of the parts contains both "one" and "being;
" 21 and the least part is composed of two parts;
21 and thus perpetually by the same reasoning, whatever becomes a part possesses these two parts perpetually;
for " one" always contains “ being," and " being, one ;
" 22 so that, two things being pro­ duced, one never is.
22 Entirely so.
Would not then the one ” existing thus become an infinite multitude.
So it seems.
Proceed still further by this road.
By what?
We have said that the one participates in " being," so far as it is being.
We have said so.
And on this account "one being'' appears to be " many."
It does so.
What then ?
If one itself, which we say participates in being, we receive mentally, alone by itself, and apart from that in which we say it participates, will it appear to be one alone ?
Or will this very thing be many ?
I think it will be one. [34.]
But let us likewise look to another thing.
23
It is necessary for its " being " to be one thing, and itself another, if "the one" itself is not be- ing;
" but as being one 24 it participated in " being."
It is ne­ cessary.
If then "being" is one thing, and "one" another, neither is " one " by its existence as one different from " being," nor " being " by its existence as " being " different from " one;
" but they are different from each other 25 through that which is different and another.
25 Entirely so.
So that "the different" is the same neither with "the one ” nor with the being."
How can it ?
What then, if we should select from them, whether if you will "the being" and “ the different," or "the being" and "the one," or "the one" and "the different," should we not, in each selection, select certain two things, which it is proper to denominate both ?
How so ?
Thus.
It is possible to speak of “ being."
It is.
And again, to speak of " one."
And this likewise.
Are not then either spoken of ?
Yes.
But what, when I say “being,” and "one," do I not pronounce both?
Entirely so.
And if I should say " being " and " different," or "different" and "one," should I not in each of these pro­ nounce both perfectly ?26 Yes.
But can those things which are properly denominated both, be both, and yet not two ?
They cannot.
And is there any method for each of things, that are two, not to be one ?
There is not.
Of these then, since each two exist together, each would be one.
It appears so. [35.]
But if each of them is one, and any one whatever is placed together with them, by any kind of union whatever, do not they all become three ?
Certainly..
But are not three odd, and two even ?
How should they not be ?
What then, being two, is it not necessary for twice to be ?
and being three, thrice;
since twice one exists in two, and thrice one in three ?
It is necessary.
But if there are two and twice, is it not necessary that there should be twice two ?
And if there are three and thrice, that there should be thrice three ?
How not ?
But what, if there are three and twice, and there are two and thrice, is it not necessary that there should be 27 twice three and thrice two ?27 Entirely so.
Hence, there would be the evenly even, and the oddly odd;
and the oddly even, and the evenly odd.
It is so.
If then this is the case, do you think that any number is left, which is not necessarily there ?
By no means.
If then “one” exists, it is necessary for number to exist likewise.
It is necessary.
But if number exists, the many would exist, and an infinite multitude of beings;
or is there not a number, infinite in multitude, and participating in "being?" .
There is, by all means.
If then every number participates in "being," would not each part also of number participate in “being?” Yes.
"Being" then has been distributed through all things, being many, and stands apart from nothing existing, whether the least or the greatest.
Or is it not absurd even to ask this question ?28 For how could "being" stand apart from any thing existing ?
By no means. [36.] " Being" then is cut up into fractions the smallest possible, and the greatest, and existing in every degree, 29 and is divided the most of all things,29 and the parts of "being" are infinite.
30 Such is the case.
Very many, therefore, are its parts.
Very many, indeed.30
What then, is there any one of these, which is a part of " being," and yet is not one part ?
But how can this be ?
But if it is, I think there must always be a necessity for it, as long as it exists, to be a certain one thing;
but that it cannot possibly be nothing.
There is a necessity.
31" The one," therefore, is present to all (and) each part of “being,”31 deficient in neither a less or a greater part, or in any thing else.
It is so.
Is then "one" a whole, existing in many places at the same time ?
Look into this.
I do look, and I see it is impossible.
It is divided then, since it is not a whole;
for it will not otherwise than in a divided state, be present to all the parts of " being."
Certainly.
But there is a great necessity for that, which is divisible, to be as many as are the parts.
There is a necessity. [37.]
We did not then just now say truly, when we said that "being" was distributed into very many parts.
For it is not divided into more parts than “one” itself,32 but into parts equal to those of " the one:
for neither is "being" wanting to “ the one," nor " the one " to " being ;
" but being two are always equalized through all things.
It appears to be entirely so. "
One it­ self," therefore, having been cut up into fractions by " being," becomes many and infinite in multitude.
So it appears.
Not only then is “ the being ”33 many, but it is likewise necessary for " the one," when distributed by " being," to be many.
Entirely so.
Moreover, because the parts are parts of a whole, " the one" will be finite according as it is a whole.
Or are not the- parts included in the whole ?
Necessarily so.
But that which includes would be a bound.
How not ? "
The one " therefore is somehow both one and many, whole and parts, finite and infinite in multitude.
It appears so.
As it is bounded then, has it not likewise extremes ?
Of necessity.
But what, if it be a whole, would it not have likewise a beginning, a middle, and an end ?
Or can there be any whole without these three ?
And if any one whatever of these be wanting34 to any thing, will that thing be willing to be any longer a whole ?
It will not. " The one " then, as it seems, would possess a beginning, and end, and a middle.
It would. [38.]
But the middle is equally distant from the ex­ tremes;
for it would not otherwise be the middle.
It would not.
And " the one " being such would, as it appears, partici­ pate in a certain figure, either straight or round, or mixed up of both.
It would so.
Will it then, being such, not exist itself in itself and in another ?
How ?
Each of the parts is surely in the whole, nor is any one out of the whole.
It is so.
But all the parts are surrounded by the whole.
Yes.
But " the one" is all the parts of itself;
and is neither more nor less than all.
Certainly.
Is not then the one the whole ?
How not ?
If then all the parts are in the whole, and all the parts are the one, and the whole itself and all the parts are surround­ ed by the whole, "the one" would be surrounded by "the one," and thus " the one " would be already in itself.
It appears so.
But on the other hand, the whole is not in the parts, neither in all, nor in any one.
For, if it were in all, it would'neces­ sarily be in one:
for, if it were not in some one, it would not be able to be in all.
But if this one is a portion of all the parts, and the whole is not in this, how can it be 35 any longer in all the parts ?
Not at all.
Nor yet in any of the parts.
For if the whole were in some of the parts, the greater would be in the lesser;
which is impossible.
It is impossible. [39.]
But since the whole is neither in many, nor in one, nor in all the parts, is it not necessary for it to be either in some other, or no where ?
It is necessary.
But if no where, will it not be nothing ?
And if it is a whole, since it is not in itself, is it not necessary for it to be in another ?
Entirely so.
So far therefore as "the one" is a whole, it is in another;
but so far as all things are its parts, and itself all the parts, it is in itself;
and thus the one will necessarily be in itself and in another.
Necessarily.
But as "the one" is naturally such, is it not necessary for it to be both moved and to stand still ?
How ?
It stands still, if it be in itself.
For being in one and not departing from this, it will be in the same, through being in itself.
It will.
But that which is always in the same must somehow neces­ sarily stand still always.
Entirely so.
What then, must not that, on the contrary, which is always in another, necessarily be never in the same ?
But if it be never in the same, can it ever stand still;
and if it does not stand still, must it not be moved ?
Certainly.
It is necessary therefore for " the one," being always in itself and in another, to be always moved and to stand still.
It appears so.
It ought moreover to be the same with itself, and different from itself;
and, in like manner, the same with and different from others, if it suffers what has been (mentioned) before. [40.]
How ?
Every thing somehow is in this state with rela­ tion to every thing.
It is either the same or different:
or if not the same or different, it will be a part of that, to which it is so related, or, it will be with respect to a part a whole.
It appears so.
Is then the one" a part of itself?
By no means.
36 It will not then with respect to a part of itself be a whole, nor with respect to itself a part.
36
For it cannot.
But is " one "'therefore different from “the one ?" By no means.
It will not then be different from itself.
Certainly not.
If then it is neither different, nor a whole, nor yet a part, with respect to itself, is it not necessary for it to be the same with itself?
It is necessary.
What then, is it not necessary for that, which is elsewhere than itself while existing in the same with itself, to be different from itself, if indeed it shall be elsewhere?38
It appears so to me.
In this state does the one" appear to be existing at the same time both in itself and in another.
So it seems.
In this way then it appears that " the one" will be different from itself.
It does so.
What then, if any thing39 is different from any thing, will it not be differ­ ent from that which is different ?
Necessarily so.
But are not all such things, as are not one, different from " the one?"
And is not " the one " (different from such things as) are not one ?
How not ? "
The one" therefore will be different from the rest.
Different.
See then, are not " the different" and " the same " contrary to each other.
How not ?
Is the same ever wont to be in the different, or the different in the same ?
It is not wont. [41.]
If therefore the different is never in the same, there is not one of existing things, in which the differ­ ent exists for any time;
for if it existed in any thing during any time'whatever, during that time the different would be in the same.
Is it not so ?
It is so.
But since it is never in the same, the different would never exist in any of existing things.
True.
Neither therefore would the different exist in things which are not one, nor in " the one."
It would not.
Through " the different" therefore the one will not be different from things which are not one, nor things which are not one be different from " the one."
Not indeed.
Nor through them­ selves will they be different from each other, since they do not participate in " the different."
For how can they ?
But if they are different neither through themselves, nor through " the different," would they not escape entirely from being different from each other ?
They would escape.
But neither do things, which are not one, participate in "the one:
" for they would be no longer not one, but in some way one.
True.
Nor would things, which are not one, be number;
for possess­ ing number, they would thus be altogether not one.
They would not.
But what, can things which are not one be parts of one ?
Or would not things, which are not one, in this way participate in “the one?”
They would participate.
If then this is entirely " one," but those not one, " the one" would not be a part of things, which are not one, 40nor a whole, as if they were a part;
40 nor, on the contrary, would things, which are not one, be parts of " the one," nor wholes 41 as if the one were a part.
41
They will not. [42.]
But we have said that things, which are neither parts, nor wholes, nor different from each other, will be the same with each other.
We have said so.
Shall we then assert that " the one," since it is in this state with respect to things which are not one, is the same with them ?
Let us say so. "
The one " then, as it ap­ pears, is both different from others and itself, and the same with them and with itself.
It appears very nearly so, at least from this reasoning.
But is it also similar and dissimilar to itself and others ?
Perhaps so.
Since then it appears to be different from the others, the others likewise will be somehow different from it.
But what then ?
Will it not then be different from the others in the same manner as the others from it ?
And this neither more nor less ?
For what should it be ?
If then neither more nor less, it (will be) similarly.
Certainly.
In the manner then through which the one ”42 suffers to become different from the others, and the others similarly from it, in that manner would the one be suffering similarly to the others, and the others (similarly) to the one ?
How say you ?
Thus.
Do not you apply each name to something ?
I do;
what then ?
Could you pronounce the same name often or once ?
I could.43
When therefore you pronounce (a name) once, do you speak of the thing, to which the name belongs ;
but not, if often ?
Or, is there not a great necessity for you always to speak of the same thing, whether you pronounce the same name once or often ?
What then ? [43.]
Is not " different" a name applied to some thing ?
Entirely so.
When therefore you pronounce it, whether once or often, you do not apply this name to any other thing,44 but that of which it is the name.
Necessarily so.
When we say then that the others" are different from the one," and “ the one " different from " the others," twice pronouncing the name " different," we do not at all apply the expression to any other nature but that of which it is the name.
Entirely so.
In the way then that " the one " is different from " the others," and the others" from the one," 45according to the very thing which " the different" has, " the one" would suffer nothing else than what the others do, but just the same :
45 but that which somehow suffers the same (is) similar.
Is it not ?
Yes.
But in the way that the one" suffers so as to be dif­ ferent from the others, according to that very way46 every thing would be similar to every thing;
for every thing is dif­ ferent from every thing.
It appears so.
Moreover the similar is contrary to the dissimilar.
It is.
Is not " the different" too contrary to "the same?”47 This also.
Moreover this like­ wise has been made apparent, that " the one" is the same with land different from48] "the others."
It has been made ap­ parent.
But to be the same with " others " is a contrary suffer­ ing to the being different from " the others."
Entirely so.
As far as it was different, it appeared to be similar.
Yes.
So far then as it is the same, it will be dissimilar according to its suffer­ in- the contrary to that suffering which produces the similar:
49but did the different produce the similar?49 Yes.
The same therefore will render something dissimilar;
or it will not be contrary to the different.
So it appears. [44.] “ The one" therefore will be both similar and dissimilar to " the others;
" so far as it is different it will be similar ;
but so far as it is the same, dissimilar.
49 It has, it seems, such reasoning.49
And it has this likewise.
What ?
So far as it suffers the same, it does not suffer what is of a different kind;
and not suffering what is of a different kind, it is not dissimilar;
and not being dissimilar, it is similar:
but so far as it suffers an­ other thing, it is of a different kind;
and being of a different kind, it is dissimilar.
You speak the truth.
Since then “the one " is both the same with and different from " the others," according to both and each of these cases, it will be similar and dissimilar to " the others."
Entirely so.
And will it not in a similar manner, since it has appeared to be both different from, and the same with, itself, appear, according to both these, and each, to be similar and dissimilar to itself?
Ne­ cessarily so.
But consider now how " the one " subsists with respect to touching and not touching itself and " the others."
I consider.
For " the one " has somehow appeared to be in itself a whole.
Right.
But is not " the one " in " the others " likewise ?
Yes.
So far then as "the one" is in " the others," it will touch the others ”but so far as it is in itself, it will be prevented from touching " the others;
" but being in itself it will touch itself.
So it appears.
And thus, indeed, "the one" will both touch itself and " the others."
It will touch.
But what (will it be) in this view ?
Must not every thing, which is about to touch any thing, lie close to that, which it is about to touch, and occupy that seat, 50which may be after that seat, in which that may lie, I which it touches ?50 It is necessary. "
The one," therefore, if it is about to touch itself, ought to lie close to itself, and occupy the place close to that in which it is.
It ought so. [45.]
Would not " the one," if it were two, do this, and be in two places at once ?
But as long as it is one, it will not be wont to do so.
It will not.
The same necessity therefore belongs to " the one," to be neither two nor to touch itself.
The same.
But neither will it touch the others.
Why?
Because we have said, that when any thing is about to touch any thing, which is separate from it, it ought to be placed close to that which it is about to touch ;
but that there must be no third in the middle of them.
True.
Two things therefore at the least are requisite, if contact is about to take place.
Certainly.
But if a third is added close upon the two terms,51 there will now be three, but the contacts two.
Certainly.
And thus one always being added, one contact will be likewise added ;
and the result is that the contacts will be less by one than the multitude of the numbers.
For by how much the two first things exceeded the contacts, 52 so as to be more in number than the contacts,]52 by just so much does all the following number exceed the multitude of the contacts.
For already hereafter53 one is added to the number, and one contact to the contacts.
Right.
As many then as are in number the things existing, (by so many,) less by one, are the contacts always.
True.
If then there is only one thing, and not a pair, there can be no contact.
How can there ?
Have we not said that the other things, different from the one," are neither one nor participate of it, since they are different ?
We have. [46.]
Number therefore is not in the others, since one is not in them.
How can it?
The others, therefore, are not one, or two, or 54any thing possessing the name of another number.54 No.
"The one," therefore, is one alone, and could not be two.
It appears not.
Contact, therefore, is not, when two are not.
It is not. " The one " therefore will neither touch " the others," nor will " the others" touch " the one," as there is no contact.
Certainly not.
On all these accounts, there­ fore, "the one" will both touch and not touch others and itself.
So it appears.
Is it not therefore equal and unequal to itself and "the others?"
How ?
If " the one " were greater or less than " the others," or "the others" greater or less than the one," would it not follow that by “the one " being one, and “ the others " dif­ ferent from " the one," they would be not an atom greater or an atom less than each other, by those very existences ?
But if, in addition to their being such as they are, each possessed equality, they would be equal to each other.
But if “ the one" possessed magnitude, and " the others " smallness, or “ the one " magnitude, but the others" smallness, would not that, to whatever species magnitude was present, be the greater;
and that, to whatever (species) smallness (was present), be the less.
Necessarily so.
Are there not therefore these two species, magnitude and smallness ?
For if they had no existence they surely could never be contrary to each other, and be inherent in things existing. [47. ]
How should they ?
If then small­ ness is inherent in " the one," it will either be inherent in the whole or in a part of it.
It is necessary.
But what if it be in­ herent in the whole?
Will it not either be extended on an equality through the whole of " the one," or surround " the one?"
Plainly so.
If smallness then is inherent on an equality in "the one," will it not be equal to " the one;
" but if it surrounds " the one," will it not be greater ?
How not ?
Can then smallness be equal to or greater than any thing, and produce the effects of magnitude and equality, but not on itself ?
It is impossible.
Smallness then will not be inherent in the whole of " the one;
" but, if at all, in a part.
Certainly.
Nor yet, on the other hand, in the whole part;
for if not, it would produce the same effect as in the case of the whole;
(for)65 it would either be equal to, or greater than, the part in which it is inherent.
It is necessary.
Smallness then will not be in any thing existing, being inherent in neither a part nor a whole;
nor will there be any thing small, except smallness itself.
It seems not.
56 Neither will magnitude be in it.
For there would be some other thing greater, and, besides magni­ tude itself, that in which magnitude is inherent, and this too, although it being not small, which it ought to exceed, if in­ deed it be great;
56 but which in this case is impossible, since smallness is not inherent in any thing existing.
True.
But magnitude itself is not greater than any thing else but small­ ness itself;
nor is smallness less than any thing else but mag­ nitude itself. [48.]
It is not.
Neither then would " the others ” be greater than " the one," nor less, since they possess neither magnitude nor smallness;
nor do these two possess any power either of exceeding or of being exceeded with respect to " the one," but only with respect to each other;
nor, on the con­ trary, will " the one " be either greater or less than these two, or "the others," as it possesses neither magnitude nor smallness.
So indeed it appears.
If then " the one " is neither greater nor less than " the others," is it not necessary for it to neither exceed nor be exceeded by them ?
It is necessary.
Is there not also a great necessity for that, which neither exceeds nor is exceeded, to be on an equality?
and if on an equality, to be equal ?
How not ? "
The one " therefore will be in this state with respect to itself.
Possessing neither magnitude nor smallness in itself, it would neither exceed nor be ex­ ceeded by itself;
but being on an equality, it would be equal to itself.
Entirely so. "
The one " therefore will be equal both to itself and " the others."
So it appears.
But being itself in itself, it would also be externally about itself;
and surrounding itself, it would be greater than itself;
but being surrounded, less than itself;
and thus " the one" would be both greater and less than itself.
It would so.
Is not this also necessary, that there is nothing beyond " the one " and "the others ?"
How should it be otherwise ?
But ought not that, which has a being, to be always some where ?
Yes.
And does not that, which exists in another, exist as the less in the greater?
For one thing cannot otherwise exist in another. [49.]
It cannot.
But since there is nothing else apart from " the one " and “the others," and it is necessary for these to be in something, is it not necessary for them to be in one another, 57 [the others in " the one," and " the one" in the others] ;
57 or that they should be no where ?
It appears so.
Because then the one ” is in "the others," "the others" will be greater than " the one," through surrounding it;
and " the one " will be less than "the others," by being surrounded.
But because " the others " are in " the one," " the one," by the same reasoning, would be greater than "the others;
" and "the others" less than " the one."
It appears so. " The one," therefore, is equal to, greater and less, than both itself and others.
It seems so.
But if it is greater, equal, and less, it will be of equal, more, and fewer measures, both than itself and " the others;
" and if of measures, also of the parts.
How should it not?
Being, therefore, of equal, more, and fewer mea­ sures, it will also in number be more and less than itself and “the others ;
” and also, for the same reason, equal to itself and “the others."
How ?
It would surely be of greater measures than are those things, than which it is greater;
and (it would be) of as many parts as measures ;
and in the same manner, (in the case of those) than which it is less;
and similarly (in the case of those) to which it is equal.
It is so.
Since then " the one" is both greater, less, and equal to itself, will it not also contain measures equal to, more, and fewer than itself?
And if of measures, will not this also be true of parts ?
How not ?
If then it contains equal parts with itself, it will be equal in multitude to itself;
but if more, more in multitude, and if fewer, less in multitude, than itself.
It appears so. [50.]
But will not " the one " be in a similar state as regards " the others?"
Because it appears to be greater in magnitude than them, is it not necessary for it to be more in number than " the others?" and, because less in magnitude, fewer in number?
and because equal in magnitude, equal likewise in multitude to "the others ?"
It is necessary.
And thus again, as it seems, " the one" will be equal, more, and less in number, both than itself and " the others."
It will so.
Does " the one," then, participate in time ?
And is it, and does it become, younger and older, itself than itself and " the others?"
And again,58 neither younger nor older than itself and the others, although participating of time ?
How ? "
To be " is surely its property, since it " is the one."
Certainly.
But what else is " to be " than a participation in “being " in conjunction with the present ?
Just as " it was" is a parti­ cipation in " being" in conjunction with the past, and " it will be " with the future ?
It is so.
It must participate then in time, if it participates in " being."
Entirely so.
Must it not therefore participate in time while progressing ?
Certainly.
It is always, therefore, in the act of being older than itself, if it proceeds according to time.
It is necessary.
Do we then remember that the older is (always)59 becoming older than that which is becoming younger ?60 We remember.
Would not then " the one," since it is becoming older than itself, become older than itself, while it is thus becoming younger?
Necessarily so.
It becomes then both younger and older than itself.
Certainly. [51.]
But is it not then older, when it is in the act of being according to the present time, which is between the "was" and the will be:
" for in proceeding from the "then" to " the hereafter," it will not pass over " the now ?"
It will not.
Will it not then stop in the act of being older, when it arrives at "the now," and is no longer in the act of being, but is already61 older ?
For as it proceeds it will never be laid hold of by "the now."
For that which is proceeding is in such a state as to touch both "the now” and "the hereafter," leaving hold of "the now," but laying hold of the hereafter," because it is in the act of being between "the hereafter" and the now.
" True.
But if it is necessary for whatever is in the act of being not to pass by "the now," when it arrives at that point, it always stops in the act of being, and "is" then whatever it may happen to become.
It appears so. " The one," then, when, in becoming older, it arrives at "the now," stops in the act of being, and then "is" older.
Entirely so.
"Is" it not then older than what it was becoming older?
And was it not becoming (older) than itself?
Certainly.
Now the older is older than the younger.
It is. " The one" then is younger than itself, when in becoming older, it arrives at " the now."
Of neces­ sity.
But the now" is always present with the one," through the whole of its being;
for it is always "now," as long as it "is."
How not ? "
The one," therefore.
always is, and is in the act of being younger and older than itself.
So it appears.
But " is the one," or is it in the act of being, 62for a time longer than or equal to itself?62
An equal time. [52.]
But that which either is in the act of being, or is for an equal time, has the same age.
How not ?
But that which has the same age is neither older nor younger.
It is neither.
"The one," therefore, since it is in the act of being, and is for a time equal to itself, neither is nor is in the act of being younger or older than itself.
It appears to me not.
But what of " the others ?"63 I have not what to say.
But this at least you have to say, that "the others," if they are different things from " the one,"64 and not a different thing, are more than “one.”
For that which is different would be one ;
but those that are different are more than one, and would possess multitude.
They would.
But being a multitude they would participate in a greater number than the one ?"
How not ?
What then ?
Shall we say that the things more in number are, or have been, generated prior, or the less ?
The less.
The least then is the first.
Now is not this " the one ?" Certainly. " The one," therefore, was generated the first of all things possessing number:
but all "the others" have number, if they are others and not another.
They have.
But that which was first generated was, I think, prior in existence:
but the others are posterior.
But such as have been gener­ ated posterior, are younger than that which was generated prior;
and thus the others" would be younger than the one," and the one" would be older than the others."
It would.
But what is this ?
Could the one" be generated contrary to its nature?
or is this impossible?
Impossible.
But the one has appeared to possess parts ;
and, if parts, a beginning, an end, and a middle.
Yes.
Is not then the beginning generated first of all, both of "the one" and of each of "the others ;
" and after the beginning all " the others," as far as the end ?
What then ? [53.]
We will say moreover, that all the others are parts of the whole and of one ;
but that "the one," together with the end, has been generated one and a whole.
We will say so.
Now the end, I think, is generated the last of all, but the one" is naturally generated together with this ;
so that, if it is necessary for the one " to be generated not contrary to nature, it would, having been generated together with the end, be naturally generated the last of" the others."
It appears so. " The one," therefore, is younger than " the others," but " the others" are older than the one."
So again it appears to me.
But what, must not the beginning or any other part whatever of "the one," or of any thing else, if it is a part, and not parts, be necessarily one, [sinee it is a part] ?65 Neces­ sarily.
"The one," therefore, would be generated together with the first (part), while in the act of being, and together with the second;
and is never wanting to any one of the other parts, while in the act of being, until, arriving at the extremity, it becomes one whole, having been left out neither from the middle, nor from the last.
nor the first, nor from any other (part) whatever in its generation.
True. " The one," there­ fore, will have the same age with " the others," so that, if it be not “the one" contrary to its own nature, it would be generated neither prior nor posterior to " the others," but together with them ;
and according to this reasoning, "the one" will neither be older nor younger than " the others," nor " the others" than "the one:
" but, according to the former reasoning, "the one" was both older and younger than " the others," and they in a similar manner than it.
Entirely so.[54.]
After this manner, then, "the one" is and has been generated.
But what again shall we say of its becoming older and younger than the others, and of the others than "the one;
" and again, that it neither becomes older nor younger ?
(As we said) respecting its being, (shall we say) in the same manner respecting its becoming to be ?
or other­ wise ?
I am not able to say.
But I am able (to say) this ;
that, although one thing is older than another, yet it cannot become still older, than by that difference of age which it possessed as soon as it was produced;
nor, on the other hand, can that which is younger become younger.
For, equal things being added to unequals, whether they are times or any thing else, always cause them to differ by the same degree as that, by which they were distant at first.
How not?
"That which is" therefore would never become older or younger than any being,66 if it is always different by an equal quantity from it in age:
but (this)67 is and was older, and that younger;
but is not becoming so.
True. "
The one " likewise will never become either older or younger than " the others," it being so already.
Never.
But see whether in this way (they) become younger and older.
68
In what way ?
The same as that through which " the one" was made to appear older than the others," and "the others " (older) than " the one." [55.]
What then ?
Since " the one " is older than " the others," it has been generated during a longer time than " the others."
Certainly.
Now consider again, if we add an equal time to a longer and shorter time, does the longer differ from the shorter by an equal or by a smaller part ?
By a smaller.
69 Will not then the one" differ from the others" by an age as great subsequently as it did at first?
but, receiving an equal time with " the others," it will differ always in age less than before.
69
Will it not be so?
Yes.
But would not that, which differs less in age, with respect to any thing, than it did before, become younger than before, with respect to those, than which it was before older ?
Younger.
But if that is younger, will not, on the other hand, " the others" be older with respect to "the one" than before?
Entirely so.
That, therefore, which was generated younger, would be in the act of becoming older, with respect to that which was before generated and is older;
but it never is older, but is always in the act of becoming older than it;
for the one ad­ vances to a younger, but the other to an older, state;
and on the other hand, that which is older is in the act of becoming younger in the same manner than the younger.
For both tending to that which is contrary to themselves, they are in the act of becoming contrary to each other;
the younger be­ coming older than the older, and the older younger than the younger.
But they would not be able to become so.
For should they become so, they would no longer be in the act of be­ coming, but would be (now).70
But now they are in the act of becoming younger and older than each other;
and " the one" indeed is in the act of becoming younger than "the others," because it has been made to appear to be older, and to have had a prior generation:
but the others" (have been made to appear to be) older than the one," because they have had a posterior generation. [56.]
According to the same reasoning, " the others " likewise are similarly related with respect to “ the one," since they were made to appear to be older and to have had a prior generation.
So indeed it appears.
So far then as neither becomes younger or older than the other, through their differing by an equal num­ ber from each other, "the one" will not become older or younger than " the others," nor the others than " the one."
But so far as it is necessary for the prior71 to differ 72by a part ever another 72 from the posterior, and the posterior from the prior, so far it is necessary for them to become older and younger than each other, and the others" than " the one," and "the one" than the others ?"
Entirely so.
On all these ac­ counts then " the one " is, and is in the act of becoming older and younger both than itself and " the others;
" and again, it neither is nor is in the act of " becoming " older or younger than itself and " the others."
It is perfectly so.
But since " the one" participates in time, and in the act of becoming older and younger, is it not necessary for it to participate in " the then," and " the hereafter," and " the now," if it participates in time ?
It is necessary. " The one," therefore, was, and will be, and is;
and has been in the act of becoming, and is in the act of becoming, and will be in the act of be­ coming.
What then?
And there would be something for it, and of it, and which was, and is, and will be..
Entirely so. [57.]
Now there would be the knowledge and opinion and perception of it, if we now 73do all these things73 re­ lating to it.
You speak rightly.
There is likewise for it a name and a discourse;
and it may be named and spoken of:
and whatever circumstances of such a kind take place with regard to " the others," take place with regard likewise to " the one."
Such is entirely the case.
Let us then speak of the third point.
If " the one " is such as we have discussed, is it not necessary, since it is both one and many, and again neither one nor many, and participating in time, that because it is one, it should participate at one time in " being;
" but that because it is not one, it should participate at no time in " being ?"
It is necessary.
Will it then be pos­ sible for it not to participate, when it does;
or to participate, when it does not ?
It will not be possible.
It participates then at one time, and does not participate at another;
for thus alone can it participate and not participate in the same.
Right.
Is not this then the time when it participates in "be­ ing," and again is freed from it ?
Or how is it possible for it to possess at one time the same thing, and at another time not, unless at some time it both receives and dismisses it ?
Not otherwise.
Do you not call the receiving of “being”by the term to be generated?
I do.
And to be freed from "being" (by the term) to be destroyed ?
Entirely so. "
The one " then, as it seems, by receiving and dismissing " being," is generated and destroyed.
Necessarily so. [58.]
But since it is one and many, and is generated and destroyed, when it becomes one, is not the being many destroyed, and when it becomes many, is not the being one destroyed ?
Entirely so.
But, when it becomes one and many, must it not be separated and united ?
It must.
And when it becomes unlike and like, must it not be made like and unlike ?
Certainly.
And when it be­ comes greater, less, and equal, must it not be increased, and wasted away,74 and equalized ?
It must so.
But when from being moved it stands still, and when from standing still it changes into being moved, 75 it is requisite surely for it to be not in one time.
75
How should it ?
But that which stood still be­ fore and is afterwards moved, and that which was moved before and afterwards stands still, cannot be thus affected without a change.
For how can it ?
But there is no time, in which any thing can at once be neither moved nor stand still.
There is not.
But it cannot change without a change.
It is probable not.
When, therefore, does it change ?
For it would change, neither while it stands still, nor while it is moved, nor while it is in time.
It would not.
Is there then that strange thing, in which it would be, when it changes ?
What thing ? "
The sudden.
"76 77 For " the sudden " seems to signify some such thing as 77 changing from it to either.
77
For there is no change from standing, while standing ;
nor a change from motion, while in motion;
but that wonderful nature " the sudden " is situated between motion and standing, and is in no time;
78 and into this and from this that, which is moved, changes for the purpose of standing still;
and that which stands, for the purpose of being moved.
It nearly appears so. [59.] " The one," therefore, if it stands still and is moved, must change into either;
for thus alone would it produce both these effects.
But in chang­ ing, it changes suddenly;
and when it changes, it would be in no time, and would neither stand still nor be moved.
It would not.
Is then the one" in this state also with respect to the other changes ?
and when it changes from being into being destroyed, or from non-being into the act of becoming, does it not then become a medium between certain movements and standings ?
and then it neither is nor is not, nor is in the act of becoming, nor is destroyed ?
It appears so.
And by the same reasoning, when it passes from one into many and from many into one, it is neither one nor many, nor is it se­ parated nor united;
and in passing from like to unlike, and from unlike to like, it is neither like nor unlike, nor is it made like nor unlike;
79and while it passes from small into great, and into equal and the contraries,79 it will be neither small nor great, nor unequal, nor increasing, nor wasting away, nor equalized.
It appears not.
But all these accidents " the one " would suffer, if it is.
How not ?
But must we not consider what it is meet for the others ” to suffer, if "one" exists ?
We must consider.
Shall we state then, if " one " exists, what " the other " must suffer from 80 "the one?"
Let us state.
Since then the others" are different from " the one," they are not " the one:
" for other­ wise they would not be different from " the one ?"
Right.
Nor yet are “ the others " entirely deprived of " the one," but somehow participate in it.
In what way ?
Because " the others," having parts, are different from " the one:
" for if they had not parts, they would be entirely one.
Right.
But parts, we have said,81 belong to that, which is a whole.
We said 81 so.
But it is necessary for a whole to be one (com­ posed) of many, of which one the parts are parts:
for each of the parts must not be a part of many, but of a whole.
How is this ? [60.]
If any thing should be a part of many, amongst which it is itself, it would surely be both a part of itself, which is impossible, and of each one of the others;
since it is a part of all.
For if it is not a part of one of these, it will be a part of the others, with the exception of this;
and thus it will not be a part of each one;
and not being a part of each, it will be a part of not one of the many;
and being a part of not one of these (the many), it is impossible for it to be any thing belonging to all those, of not one of which it is either 82a part, or82 any thing else.
So it appears.
A part, therefore, is neither a part of the many nor of all;
but of some one idea and of some one thing, which we call a whole, having become from all one thing complete.
83[Of this a part would be a part].83 En­ tirely so.
If therefore the others have parts, they too would participate in a whole and one.
Certainly.
One perfect whole then possessing parts, must necessarily be different84 from " the one."
It is necessary.
There is moreover the same reasoning respecting each of the parts:
for it is neces­ sary that this85 (each part) should participate in "the one."
For, if each of these is a part, the very being each signifies surely one thing, separated indeed from others, but existing by itself, if it shall be truly each.
Right.
But it would partici­ pate in "the one," as being evidently something else than "the one;
" for (otherwise)86 it would not have participated, but would have been " the one itself."
But now it is surely im­ possible for any thing to be " the one," except " the one itself."
Impossible. [61.]
But it is necessary for both the whole and the part to participate in "the one." 87 For the whole will be one thing87 of which the parts are parts;
but on the other hand each (part will be) a part of the whole,87 of whatever whole it may be a part.88
It is so.
Will not then those things, which participate in " the one," participate in it as being different from the one ?”89 How not?
But things different from the one," will surely be many.
For if the things different from the one" were neither one nor more than one, they would be nothing.
They would.
But since the things, which participate in the one part and in the one whole, are more than one, is it not necessary for those very things, which participate in " the one," to be infinite in multi­ tude ?
How ?
Let us look at the matter in this way.
Being neither one, nor participating in " the one," do they then not participate in it when they do participate?
Certainly.
Are not multitudes those in which the one" is not?
Multitudes, certainly.
What then, if we should be willing in imagination to take away from these the least quantity we can, must not this quantity so taken away, be a multitude, and not one, since it does not participate in "the one ?" It must.
To him then, who thus surveys ever the different nature of the species itself by itself, will not as much of it, as we may behold,91 be in­ finite in multitude ?
Entirely so.
And moreover, since each part becomes one part,92 (the parts)93 have a bound with re­ spect to each other, and to the whole;
and the whole with respect to the parts.
Perfectly so.
It results then, to the things different from "the one," as it seems, that, from the one " and themselves having a communion, something different is produced in themselves, which furnished them indeed a bound with respect to each other, but their own nature would be with respect to themselves infinity.94
It appears so. [62.]
Thus the things different from " the one," both as wholes and according to parts, are infinite and participate in bound.
Entirely so.
Are they not therefore similar and dissimilar, both to each other and to themselves ?
Why ?
Because, so far as all of them are somehow infinite, according to their own nature, they would all in this way suffer the same.
Entirely. 95
And so far as they all participate in a bound, they would in this way too suffer the same.
95
But so far as they suffer the being bounded and infinite, 96they suffer [these very] acci­ dents, [being accidents] contrary to each other.
Certainly.
But contrary things are as much as possible dissimilar.
96
What then ?
According to each accident they would be simi­ lar to themselves and to each other;
but according to both they are on both sides97 most contrary and dissimilar.
It nearly appears so.
And thus the others" themselves98 would be similar and dissimilar to themselves and to each other.
They would so.
And they (would be) the same to, and different from, each other, and be moved and stand still;
and we should without difficulty find the things different from the one," suffering all contrary accidents, since they have been shown to suffer these.
You speak rightly.[63.]
Shall we not then dismiss these things as evident, and again consider if " the one " is, whether the others differ- ent from " the one " are not likewise in this state, or after this manner alone ?
Entirely so.
Let us then say again as at the beginning, if “the one" is, what must the things different from " the one ” suffer.
Let us say it.
Is not then “ the one ” separate from the others," and are not the others separate from " the one ? "
Why ?
Because there is nothing else " differ­ ent" except these, (namely,) that which is different from " the one," and that which is "different" from the others ”for all is said, when the one" and the others are said.
All, in­ deed.
There is nothing else therefore except these, in which, as being the same, " the one " and " the others " would exist.
Nothing. " The one” and " the others” are therefore never in the same.
They are not.
Are they then separate ?
Yes.
We have said moreover that " the truly one " has not any parts.
For how can it ?
Neither therefore will the whole of "the one" nor its parts be in " the others," if it is separate from " the others," and has no parts.
How not ?
In no way then will " the others" participate in "the one;
" since they participate neither according to a certain part, nor according to the whole.
It seems not.
By no means then are the others" "one," nor have they any one in themselves. [64.]
They have not.
Neither, then, are " the others" many;
for, if they were many, each of them, as being a part of a whole, would be one;
but now the things different from " the one" are neither one nor many, nor a whole nor parts, since they in no respect participate in " the one."
Right. "
The others " then 99 are of themselves 99 neither two nor three, nor one in them, because they are en­ tirely deprived of "the one."
So it is.
"The others," therefore, are of themselves 100 neither similar nor dissimilar to " the one," nor are similitude and dissimilitude in them.
For if they were similar and dissimilar, or1 possessed in themselves similitude and dissimilitude, the things different from the one" would possess in themselves two species contrary to each other.
So it appears.
But it is impossible for those to participate in any two things, which do not participate even in one.
Im- possible.
"The others" therefore are neither similar nor dis­ similar, nor both.
For, if they were similar or dissimilar, they would participate in one species of the different;
and if they were both, they would participate in two contrary species :
but this has been shown to be impossible.
True.
They are therefore neither same nor different, nor moved, nor standing still, nor generated, nor destroyed, nor greater, nor less, nor equal, (nor unequal,)2 nor do they suffer any thing else of this kind.
For, if the others could endure to suffer any such acci­ dent, they would participate in one, and two, and three, and in even and odd;
in all which it has been shown it is impossible for them to participate;
since they are in every way and en­ tirely deprived of " the one."
Most true.
Hence, then, if " the one" exists, "the one" is all things and nothing, both as re­ gards itself, and as regards the others" 3in like manner.
3 Entirely so.[65.]
Be it so.
But if " the one " is not, must we not con­ sider after this what ought to happen ?
We must consider.
What then would be this supposition, if " one is not ?"
Does it differ from this, " If that, which is not one, is non-existing ?”
It does differ.
Does it differ merely from, or is the saying, " If that which is not one, is non-existing," entirely contrary (to the saying), "If the one is not?"
Entirely the contrary.
But what, should any one say, if magnitude is not, or if smallness is not, or any thing else of this kind, would he not show in each of these cases that he is speaking of that, which is not, as something different ?
Entirely so.
Would he not therefore now show that he is speaking of that which is not as some­ thing different from the others," when he says "if the one is not;
" and do we understand what he is saying?
We do un­ derstand.
In the first place then he speaks of something which may be known;
and next of something different from "the others," when he says “one;
” whether he adds to it the term of " being" or "not being;
" 4for that which is said not to be, is known none the less, and that it is different from " the others :
”4 is it not so ?
Necessarily so.
Let us then say (as) at the beginning, " If the one is not," what ought to occur.
In the first place then this, as it seems, ought to occur to it;
that either there should be a knowledge of it, or that nothing of what is said can be known, when any one says, " If one is non- existing."
True.
(Must not this too happen), either that "the others ” are different from it, or that even it cannot be said to be different from the others?"
Entirely so.
It has there­ fore diversity in addition to knowledge.
For he does not speak of the diversity of " the others," when he says that " the one" is different from " the others," but of the diversity of " the one."
It appears so.
And yet the one which is non-ex­ isting, participates in "that," and "some," and “this,”5 and " these," and every thing of this kind.
For neither could " the one" be spoken of, nor things different from the one," nor would there be any thing for it, or belonging to it, nor could it be called any thing, if it had no share in something, or in the other things of this kind.
6 Right. [66.]
But to be can­ not be present to " the one," if it non-exists ;
though nothing prevents it from participating in the many;
nay, it must (participate), if the one" is that, 7and not another thing is not existing.
7 8 If however it will not be either " the one" nor that, but the discourse about something else, it is meet to say nothing.
8
But if "the one" is supposed (as) that thing and not as another to non-exist, it is necessary for it to par­ ticipate in that and many other things.
Entirely so.
Dissimili­ tude, therefore, is present to it with respect to " the others for " the others," being different from " the one," will also be foreign (from it).
Certainly.
But are not things foreign various ?
How not ?
And are not things various dissimilars ?
Dissimilars.
If then they are dissimilars to " the one," it is evident they would be dissimilars to that which is dissimilar.
It is evident.
There would then be present to " the one " a dissimilitude with respect to which the others" are dissimilar to it.
It seems so.
But if there is to it a dissimilitude from the others," must there not be to it a similitude of itself?
How ?
If there be a dissimilitude of "the one" to "the one," no discourse would take place about a thing of such a kind as "the one;
" nor would the supposition be about "the one," but about something different from " the one."
Entirely so.
But it ought not.
Certainly.
There ought, then, to be a simili­ tude of itself to "the one."
There ought.
But neither is "the one" equal to " the others."
For, if it were equal, *it would be according to equality, similar to them ;
* but both these are impossible, if "the one" is not.
Impossible. [67.]
But since it is not equal to "the others," is it not necessary for "the others" also to be not equal to it?
It is necessary.
But are not things which are not equal unequal ?
Certainly.
And are not unequals unequal by that which is unequal ?
How not?
"The one," therefore, participates in the inequality, ac­ cording to which the others" are unequal to it.
It does par­ ticipate.
But magnitude and smallness belong to inequality.
They do.
Do magnitude and smallness then belong to one of this kind?
It nearly appears so.
But magnitude and smallness are always separated from each other.
Entirely so.
There is then always something between them.
Certainly.
Can you mention any thing else between these, except equality ?
Nothing else.
To whatever thing therefore there is magnitude and smallness, to this there is equality also as a medium between the two.
It appears so.
To " the one" then which is non-existing, equality, magnitude, and smallness, as it appears, belong.
So it seems.
But it ought likewise to participate in a certain way in "being."
How so ?
It ought to be in the state which we have mentioned ?
for, unless it be in that 'state, we should not speak the truth in saying that " the one" is not;
but if (we speak) the truth, it is evident that we have spoken of things that exist.
Is it not so ?
It is so.
But since we assert that we speak the truth, it is necessary for us to assert that we are speaking of things which exist.
It is necessary.
9"The one," therefore, which does not exist, as it appears, does exist;
for if it should non-exist while non- existing, but remit something of existence with respect to non-existence, it will immediately become existing.
9
Entirely so. [68.]
10It ought therefore to have, as the bond of non- existence, an existence not existing, if it is about to non-exist;
just as existence (ought) to have (as a bond of existence) a non-existence existing,10 in order that it may be perfectly to be.
11
For thus especially existence would exist, and non- existence not exist, 12participating (respectively) the former in existence (for the sake) of " being " existing;
but in non- existence (for the sake) of " non-being " existing, if it is about to exist completely;
the latter (participating) in non-existence (for the sake) of "non-being" not existing ;
but (participating) in existence for the sake of “being" existing;
if non-existence is to non-exist completely.
12
Most truly so.
Since then both to existence there is a share of non-existence, and to non- existence a share of existence, is it not necessary for the one" also, since it does not exist, to participate in existence for the purpose of non-existence ?
It is necessary.
Existence therefore appears to be "the one," if it does not exist.
So it seems.
And non-existence, if it does not exist.
How not ?
Can any thing then, which is in some state, be not in that state, when it does not change from that state ?
It cannot.
Every thing then of such a kind, which is and is not in such a state, indicates some change.
How not ?
Is change motion ?
or what shall we call it ?
It is motion.
But has not “ the one " ap­ peared to be both "being" and "not-being?"
Yes.
It appears then to be and not to be in such a state.
It seems so. "
The non-existing one " appears then to be moved, since it has a change from "being" into "not-being."
It appears so.
But if it be no where among beings, as it is not, since it is a not-being, it cannot change its place from any where to any where.
For it cannot.
It will not then be moved by changing its place.
For it will not.
Neither will it revolve in "the same for it will never touch " the same," since the same is "being."
But it is impossible for “not-being " to reside in any "being." Im­ possible. [69.]“
The one," therefore, "which is not," cannot revolve in that, in which it is not.
It cannot.
Neither will "the one " be altered from itself, either into " being " or " not-be­ ing :
” for our discourse would no longer be concerning the one, if it were altered from itself, but concerning something else.
Right.
But if it is neither altered, nor revolves in the same, nor changes its place, can it still be moved in any way ?
How can it?
But it is necessary for that, which is unmoved, to be at rest;
and for that, which is at rest, to stand still.13
It is necessary.
As it seems, therefore, " the one" which is not, both stands still and is moved.
It appears so.
And yet if it be moved, there is a great necessity for it to be altered;
for, so far as any thing is moved, it is no longer in the same state that it was, but in a different one.
So it is. " The one," therefore, since it is moved, is also altered.
Yes.
And yet being moved not at all, it would be not at all altered.
It would not.
So far then as " the one " which is not, is moved, it is altered;
but so far as it is not moved, it is not altered.
Certainly not. " The one," therefore, which is not, is both altered and not altered.
It appears so.
But is it not neces­ sary for any thing, when it is altered, to be in the act of being different from what it was before, and to die away from its former state;
but for a nature, which is not altered, to be neither in the act of being, nor of dying away ?
It is neces­ sary. " The one," therefore, which is not, by being altered, is in the act of being, and of dying away;
but at the same time, from its not being altered, it is not in the act of being or of dying away. [70.]
And thus “ the one," which is not, is in the act of being and of dying, and is neither in the act of being nor of dying away.
For it is not (otherwise).
But let us again return to the beginning, about to see whether these things will appear to us as they do now, or otherwise.
It is necessary.
Have we not already said, 14 " If ‛the one is not, what ought to happen concerning it ? " Cer- tainly.
But when we say " it is not," do we intend any thing else than the absence of "being" from that which we say is not ?
Nothing else.
Whether therefore, when we say that a thing " is not,” 14 do we say that in a certain respect it is not, and that in a certain respect it is ?
15 or does the term " is not " simply signify that, what is not, is no where at all, and that it does not in any way participate in " being," if it is not ?
It signifies this most distinctly.
Neither then can that, which is not, be, nor in any other way participate in " being."
It can­ not.
But are the terms "to be generated" and "to be de­ stroyed," any thing else than for one thing to participate in "being," and for another to lose "being?"
It is nothing else.
The thing therefore to which no atom of " being" is present, can neither receive nor lose it.
How can it ? "
The one" therefore, since it is not at all, can neither possess, be freed from, nor participate in " being," in any manner what­ ever.
This seems reasonable. " The one" which is not, is then neither destroyed nor in the act of being, if it par­ ticipates not at all in being.
It appears not.
Neither therefore is it at all altered ;
for if it thus suffered it would be in the act of being destroyed.
True.
But if it is not altered, is it not also necessary for it to be not moved ?
It is necessary.
But that, which in no respect is, we will say cannot stand still;
for that which stands still ought to be in some (spot) ever the same?
In the same;
16 for how not? [71.]
Thus then let us say, that "not-being" at no time either stands or is moved.
For it does not.
Moreover not any of things existing is present to it;
for participating in any of things existing17 it would participate in "being."
It is evident
It has therefore neither magnitude, nor smallness, nor equality.
It has not.
It has moreover neither similitude nor diversity, either with respect to itself or to others.
It appears not.
What then, is it possible for it to have the other things, if nothing must be present to it?
It is not possible.
To it then there are neither similars nor dissimilars, nor the same nor different.
There are not.
But what, will there be, re­ specting a thing that is not, the term " at it," or “ to it,”18 or " of this," or " to this," or " of another," or " to another," or “ formerly," or " hereafter," or " now," or " knowledge," or “ opinion," or " perception," or " discourse," or " a name," or any thing else belonging to things existing ?
There will not.
19 A not-one then is in this state.
What state?
Not being seems to be in no state.
In no state.
19But let us still (again)20 say, if " one" is not, what must "the others" suffer.
Let us say.
In a certain way "others" must exist themselves;
for, if "others" do not exist, there would be nothing21 said about "the others."
True.
But if there is the discourse about the others," "the others" will be differ­ ent:
or do you not apply to the same thing the word "other" and the word " different ? " I do.
But we surely say that 22 the “ different” is different from "different," and the other" is other than "other ?"22 Yes.
To “the others,” therefore, if there are about to be " others," there is something from which they will be " others."
It is necessary.
But what would this be ?
For they will not be different from " the one," since it is not.
They will not.
They are different therefore from each other;
for this alone remains to them, or to be23 different from no­ thing.
Right. [72.]
According to multitudes therefore, each is different from each other;
for they cannot be different ac­ cording to one, since “one” is not.
But each mass of them, as it appears, is infinite in multitude;
even although one should lay hold of that which appears to be the least, 24 like a dream in sleep, many appear on a sudden, instead of one seeming to be;
and instead of the smallest, a quantity very great as compared with the fractions formed out of it.
Most right.
Masses of such kind existing,25 others will be mutually different from one another, if " others " are, while " one " is not.
Completely so.
Will there not then be many masses, each appearing as one, but not being so, since " one " is not ?
There will.
There will likewise appear to be a number of them, if each is one, while there are many.
Entirely so.
But the even and odd among them will appear26 not truly, if "one" shall not exist.
They will not.
But likewise the small­ est, as we have said,27 will seem to be in them.
But this (the smallest) will appear to be many and 28 great, as compared with each of the many and small.
How not?
And each mass will be imagined to be equal to many and small quanti­ ties ;
for it will not appear to change from a greater to a less quantity, before it seems to arrive at something between them;
and this would be a fancied notion of equality.
It is likely.
Will it not also (appear) to have a bound with respect to another mass, having itself, with respect to itself, neither a beginning, nor a middle, nor an end ?
In what way ?
Because when a person takes hold by his intellect of some one of these, 29 [as being one of these,] 29 there will always, prior to the beginning, appear another beginning, and after the end an­ other end will be left behind;
but in the middle (there will be) other things more in the middle than the middle;
but smaller, on account of their not being able to take hold of each one of them, since " the one " is not.
This is most true. [73.]
But every thing which a person can lay hold of by his intellect, must, I think, be broken into small pieces;
for a mass would be (ever)30 laid hold of (mentally) without a one.
Entirely so.
But is it not necessary for such a mass to appear to him, who beholds it at a distance and with a dull eye, to be one;
but to him who surveys it near and with an acute mind, will not each appear to be infinite in multitude, if it is deprived of " the one," not existing.
It is most neces­ sary.
Thus then each of " the others " ought to appear in­ finite and bounded, and one and many, if one does not exist, and the others" (besides)31 "the one" do exist.
They ought.
Will they then appear also to be similars and dissimilars?
In what way?
Just as objects in a shaded picture appear all to be one to a person standing at a distance, (they will seem) to suffer the same accident, and to be similar.
En­ tirely so.
But to him, who approaches nearer, (they will appear) to be many and different, and different from and dis­ similar to themselves, through the fancied notion of diversity.
It is so.
It is therefore necessary for the masses to appear to be similar and dissimilar to themselves and to each other.
Entirely so.
And to be the same with, and different from, each other, and to touch and be apart32 from themselves, and be moved through all possible movements, and standing still every where, and be in the act of being and of destruction, and 33 neither of these, and all of this kind,33 which it were easy for us to go through, if, though one does not exist, many do exist ?
Most true.[74.]
Once more then, returning again to the beginning, let us say, "If one is not," but the things different from " the one," what ought to happen.
Let us say. " The others " then are not one.
How should they be ?
Nor yet are they many;
for in many there would be one likewise.
For if none of these is one, all are nothing;
so that there would be not even many.
True.
One therefore not being in the others, the others arp neither many nor one.
They are not.
Nor do they appear to be either one or many.
Why not ?
Be­ cause " the others " have not in any way any communication at all with any of the things which are not, nor is any one of the non-existing present to " the others;
" for there is no part 34 to non-beings.
True.
Neither therefore is there any opinion about that, which is not in "the others," nor any fancied notion ;
nor does that" which is not," become in any way the subject of opinion applicable to "the others."35
It does not.
If there­ fore one does not exist, not any of " the others " is conceived in opinion to be one or many;
for it is impossible to form an opinion of many without one.
It is impossible.
If one there­ fore does not exist, neither do " the others " exist;
nor is one or many conceived by opinion.
It seems not.
Neither there­ fore do similars or dissimilars exist.
They do not.
Nor the same nor different, nor things touching nor apart, 36nor such others, as we have already discussed, as appearing themselves ;
36 of these there neither is any one, nor do " the others " appear, if the one does not exist.
True.
If then we summarily say, that "if one is not, nothing is," shall we not rightly say?
Entirely so.
Let both this then be asserted by us, and this also, as is reasonable, that whether one is or is not, both itself, and the others, are, with respect'to themselves and to each other, all things entirely, and are not, and appear to be, and do not appear.
It is most true.
IF the beauty of a dialogue of Plato is to be estimated by the number of separate Editions to which it has given rise, and by the quantity of Annotations written upon it, the Banquet would be fairly deemed to be second only to the Phædo, if not superior to it.
For during the last seventy-four years it has been edited by Fischer, Wolf, Ast, Sommer, Dindorf, Reynders, Rückert, Hommel, twice by Stalbaum and the triumvirate of the Scholars at Zurich;
and it has been commented upon by Wyttenbach, Schütz, Bast, Heusde, Thiersch, Orelli, Creuzer, and Voegelin :
and to these must be added the pamphlets of Hartmann and C. F. Hermann, (of which I know nothing but the titles,) together with the Academical Dissertations of different Professors and embryo Critics in Germany, and the articles written in various periodicals of that country, devoted wholly or in part to classical literature.
Nor is this all;
for during the same period the dialogue has been translated twice into English, thrice into German, and once into French.
But even here it has been the misfortune of the philoso­ pher to have his ideas travestied, rather than transferred to modem tongues.
Such at least is the case in the miscalled versions of Syden­ ham and Shelley;
the latter of whom has never looked beyond the Latin of, Ficinus, reprinted by Bekker from the original edition ;
while the former, disdaining to follow as closely a generally faithful guide, has given a paraphrase rather than a translation;
and this to such an extent, that more than a third of what he has put down is the mere coinage of his own brain, and not a vestige of it is to be found in the original Greek.
Nor is it amongst the moderns alone that this dialogue has met with a marked attention.
For it seems to have been no less a fa­ vourite with the Moral Philosophers of the Pagan world, and the Fathers of the Christian Church, and of those too, who, like the Neo- Platonists, occupied the neutral ground between the rising and decaying forms of faith.
Of this the edition of Reynders affords abundant proof;
who has either collected himself, or found in the notes of Wyttenbach, perhaps all the references to this dialogue to be met with in the series of authors alluded to;
and after their united labours in this field, a very scanty gleaning has been left, I suspect, for such as may be disposed to go over the same ground.
Far different, however, is the case as regards the verbal difficulties of the text.
For there, after all the labours of the learned, I have found not a little to exercise my own ingenuity;
and where I have failed, others will, I hope, be led to try their hands;
for it is only by such continued efforts that we can expect to recover what has been lost, or to correct what has become corrupted, in one of the most fanciful, and, despite a portion of its matter, happily abhorrent from our finer feelings, one of the most beautiful dialogues of Plato.
With regard to the object which Plato had in view in writing the Banquet, they who are desirous of seeing the conflicting and equally untenable notions of some of the scholars of Germany, must turn to Stalbaum's Prolegomena, p. 35—39, where they will find a sensible rejection of the theory of Schleiermacher;
who with a perversity of judgment for which it is difficult to account, considered the Banquet as being closely connected with the Sophist and Statesman, with which it has not an atom in common, instead of being rather a com­ panion to the Phædrus, but written if not in a more chaste, at least a more chastened, style, than that misunderstood rhapsody.[1. ] 1 RESPECTING the matters, about which you are inquir­ ing,1 I think myself to be not unprepared.
For I happened yesterday to be coming up to the city from my house at Pha­ lērus ;
2 when one of my acquaintances, who was behind, see­ ing me at distance, called out to me;
and playing upon my name, said, at the same time, Hollo!
3 Apollodorus, you Pha­ lerean,4 will you not stop ?
Upon which I stopped, and waited for him.
He then said, Apollodorus, I was just now looking after you, being desirous of hearing fully about the meeting between Agatho, and Socrates, and Alcibiades, and the rest who were present at the supper, which took place then, when there were5 some speeches on the subject of love.
For another person narrated a part,6 having heard it from Phoenix, the son of Philip;
and he said that you knew (all):
but that he had it not in his power to state any thing clearly.
Do you then tell me;
for you have the best right to narrate the con­ versation of your friend.
But first, said he, tell me, were you present yourself at the meeting or not ?
-It appears, said I, that your informant has by no means given you a clear ac­ count, if you suppose that the meeting, about which you are asking, took place recently, so that I could be present at it.
—I (thought so), said he.
-How, Glauco, (could it be,) said I ?
-Know you not, that Agatho has not sojourned here for many years ?7 whereas, since I first passed my time with Socrates, and made it my care each day to know what he said and did, it is not yet three years.
Before that time, running about wherever chance led me, and fancying I was doing something, I was more wretched than any being whatever, and not less so than you are now in thinking that you must do every thing rather than philosophize.
-Do not scoff, said he, but tell me when the meeting took place.
—When we were still children, said I, it was that Agatho won the prize 8 with the first tragedy, and the day after that in which he and his performers in the Chorus had made the sacrifice for his victory.
-It is then, said he, a long time since, it seems;
but who was the relater ?
Was it Socrates himself ?-Not Socrates, by Zeus, replied I;
but he who told it to Phoenix.
It was one Aristodemus,9 a Cydathenæan, a man of small size, and who always went without sandals.10
He was present at the meeting, being, it seems to me, an admirer, the greatest amongst those then living, of Socrates.
Never­ theless,
I inquired of Socrates himself about some of the things I had heard from him (Aristodemus);
and he (So­ crates) confessed to all he had reported.
-Why then, said he, (Glauco,) do not you tell me ?
The road to the city is very convenient for persons, as they walk along, to speak and hear.
11 Proceeding in this way we entered into conversation together, so that I am now, as I said at the commencement, not quite un­ prepared.
If then I must relate these matters ( over again) to you, I must do so.
12 Besides, for in other respects, when I am either making myself or hearing from others, any discourse on philosophy, I feel, independent of considering myself bene­ fited, a delight beyond all bounds.
But when (I hear) some other conversation, and especially yours, who are wealthy, and engaged in money-making, I feel a weariness myself, and pity for you my friends, who fancy you are doing some­ thing, while you are in fact doing nothing.
But perhaps, on the other hand, you consider me possessed with an evil genius;
and I think that you think correctly.
I do not however think so of you;
but I know it full well.[2.]
Friend.
You are always the same man, Apollodorus, ever railing at yourself and others, and you seem to me as if you really thought all men, commencing from yourself, to be, with the exception of Socrates, miserable.
Now, from whence you acquired the surname of a madman,13 I know not;
14 for in your discourses, you are ever in such a mood, and are savage against yourself15 and all others, Socrates ex­ cepted.
Apol.
And is it,16 my dearest friend, evident then that by so thinking of myself, and you, I am mad and talk at random ?
17Friend.
It is not worth while, Apollodorus, to dispute about this now.
But as to what we have requested, do not do otherwise, but tell us what the speeches were.
Apol.
The speeches then were of some such kind as this.
But I will rather endeavour to relate, as he (Aristodemus) re­ lated to me (all)18 from the beginning.
For he told me that Socrates, having washed himself and put on his slippers, which he was wont to do very seldom,19 met him ;
and that he asked him, whither he was going, after he had made himself so smart;
when Socrates told him, he was going to Agatho's to supper;
for yesterday (said he) at the sacri- flee for the victory, I avoided him, for fear of the crowd;
but agreed to be with him to-day.
I have therefore made myself smart to go to a handsome man in a handsome manner.20
But how, said he, Aristodemus, have you the disposition to be willing to go with me,21 uninvited, to a supper ?-And I re­ plied, said (Aristodemus), that I will do as you may command.
-Follow me then, said (Socrates), that we may by a change pervert the proverb,22 that To the feasts of the good will go The good of their own accord.
Homer, however, nearly seems to have not merely perverted the proverb, but to have done violence to it.
For after de­ scribing Agamemnon as pre-eminently good in the affairs of war, and Menelaus as "a soft-hearted spearman, ”(in IX. P. 588,) yet, when Agamemnon had made a sacrifice and was feasting, he has introduced (in Ιλ. B. 408) Menelaus as coming to the feast uninvited, an inferior man to the banquet of his betters.
On hearing this, said (Aristodemus), Perhaps I too shall run a risk, not Socrates, as you say, but as in Homer, if I, a person of no parts, go to the banquet of a clever man uninvited.
Will you then make an apology for bringing me ?
for, as to myself, I will not confess that I came uninvited, but invited by you.
“ 23
We two together going will consult, The one for the other," 23 what we have to say, replied (Socrates).
But come, let us be going. [3.]
After conversing a little in this way, he said, on they went.
But on the way, Socrates, attending to something in his own mind, was left behind in the walk;
and that he, (Socrates,) bade him, (Aristodemus,) who was waiting, to go on ;
but that when he arrived at Agatho's dwelling he found the door open, and there, he said, happened a ludicrous incident.
For a servant from within, straightway meeting him, led him to where the rest were reclining (at the table);
and that Agatho, on seeing him, said immediately, Aristodemus, you are come very opportunely to sup with us ;
but if you are come for any other purpose, de­ fer it to another time ;
for (know that) I was looking about for you yesterday, that I might invite you, but I could not see you.
But how are you not bringing Socrates to us ?-And I, turning round, said he, saw no where Socrates following me.
I stated however that I had come with Socrates, having been invited hither by him to supper.
—You did well, said Agatho ;
but where is he himself ?
-He was coming behind me just now, said I;
and I too wonder where he can be.
—Boy, said Agatho to one of his servants, will you not make inquiry for Socrates, and bring him in ?
but do you, Aristodemus, said lie, recline near Eryximachus.
24
And he said that a servant washed him,24 that he might take his place upon the couch;
but that some other of the servants came and brought word, that this25 Socrates had withdrawn himself, and was standing in the porch of a neighbouring house;
and when I called to him,26 (said the boy,) he refused to come in.
-Absurd! said (Agatho), will you not call him ?
and do not leave him there.
-But (Aristo­ demus) told me, that he said, By no means ;
but let him alone ;
for he had such a habit of withdrawing himself.
He some­ times stands still, said he, wherever he may happen to be.
He will be here presently, as I guess.
Do not then disturb him, but let him alone.
Nay then, if you think it best, said (Agatho), so we must do.
But, slaves, said he, prepare the feast for us the rest.
By all means 27 put before us what you like;
since there is nobody to superintend-an act which I never do myself.
Conceiving then myself and the rest here to be invited by you to supper, entertain us so that we may commend you.—[4.]
After this, he said, they went to supper ;
but Socrates had not come in.
Agatho, therefore, gave fre­ quent orders to send for Socrates;
28 but he (Aristodemus) would not permit it.
That he (Socrates) therefore came, hav­ in- waited as usual, a not long time,28 but at furthest, when they were in the middle of supper.
Agatho then, who hap- pened to be lying on the couch at the lower (end of the table) alone, said, Come hither, Socrates, and lay yourself down by me;
in order 29 that, by touching you,29 I may enjoy that wise thought, which has occurred to you in the porch.
For it is plain that you have found out and possess it;
for you would not have previously stood aloof.
30—Socrates then, sitting down, observed, It would be well, Agatho, if wisdom were a thing of such a kind, as to flow from the party filled with it, to the one who is less so, when they touch each other;
like water in vessels running by means of a thread of wool31 from the fuller vessel into the emptier.
For if wisdom were in this state, I should value32 highly a reclining near you.
For I think I should be filled by you with wisdom abundant and beautiful.
For mine would be mean and questionable, being as it were a dream.
But yours is brilliant, and has a great (hope for an)32 increase, since already it has shone out from you so vehemently, and became conspicuous the day before yesterday, in the presence of more than thirty thousand33 Greeks, its witnesses.
You are saucy, Socrates, said Agatho.
But I and you will shortly afterwards try the question touch­ ing our wisdom, and Bacchus shall decide the cause, but for .the present turn yourself to the supper.
Upon this he told me that Socrates reclined himself, and took his supper, and so did the rest, and that they made libations, 34 and sung the praises of the god, and (after performing) the other rites,34 they turned themselves to drinking;
when Pausanias,35 he said, opened the conversation thus:
-Well then, gentlemen, said he, after what fashion shall we drink the easiest (and best) ?36 For my part, I confess to you that I really feel myself not very well from yesterday's de- bauch, and I have need of some respite, and so I think the most of you have;
for you were here yesterday.
Consider then in what way we may drink the easiest.
37—Aristophanes38 then said, You speak however39 well, Pausanias, on this point, that we should by all means procure for ourselves an easy method in our drinking.
For I am one of those, who were thoroughly drenched yesterday.
-Upon hearing this, Eryxi­ maehus,41 the son of Aeūmĕnus, said, Both of you say well:
but I want to hear from one of you, how does Agatho bear up with strength in drinking.
—I am by no means very strong, said (Agatho).
—It would be a god-send, said Eryximaehus, for us, both myself and Aristodemus, and Phædrus,42 and these here, if you, the stouter men at the bottle, have on the present occasion flinehed.
For we are at all times weak.
Soerates indeed I put out of the account;
for he is all-sufficient on both points,43 so that it matters not to him, whichsoever we may do.
Since then none of the persons present seem in­ elined to drink much wine, I may be perhaps the less dis­ agreeable, if I tell the truth about getting drunk.
For from the physieian's art, I conceive that this has become a matter quite evident to myself, that drunkenness is for men a very bad thing;
and I would neither willingly myself 44 be willing to drink far on,44 nor advise any other person (to do so), especially when still suffering with a head-ache from the night before.
-As for me, said Phædrus of Myrrhinous,45 taking up the discourse, I am accustomed to attend to you in other respects, and in whatever you say about the physician's art, and so would the rest here, if they are well-advised.46—[5.]
On hearing this, they all agreed not to make the present meeting a debauch;
but to drink thus47 as they pleased.-
Since then this has been decreed, said Eryximachus, that we are to drink as each one pleases, and that there is to be no compulsion, the next thing I have to propose is, to let the flute-playing damsel, who has just come in, go away and play to herself, or, if she pleases, to the women within;
but for us to mix with each other to-day in conversation:
and on what kind of conversation I am willing, if you wish it, to eXplain.
-This, they all said, they wished, and bade him ex­ plain accordingly.
Hereupon Eryximachus said,
The commencement then of my speech is in the style of the Melanippe of Euripides, The tale I have to tell is not my own,48 but from Phædrus here.
For Phædrus is on every occasion saying to me, with an air of indignation, Is it not a shocking thing, says he, Eryximachus, for hymns and pæans to be made by poets in honour of some other deities;
and yet not one amongst so many poets who have been born,49 has ever com­ posed a panegyric upon Love, who is a deity of such an age,50 and of such a power?
But if, on the other hand, you are willing to look carefully into the utilitarian51 sophists, (you will find that some)52 have composed encomiums in prose on Hercules, and other persons, as the best of them, Prodicus,53 has done.
This, however, is the less wonderful.
54
But I have lately met with a little book, by a wise man, in which salt has a wondrous praise for its utility;
and upon many other things of such a kind you may see encomiums.55 56(Strange) that about such subjects many should have be­ stowed great care,56 but that not a single person should ever to this day have dared to hymn Love worthily;
and thus has a deity so great been neglected.
Now, in all this, Phædrus seems to me to speak correctly.
I am desirous, therefore to bring at the same time my contribution to this subject, and to gratify him;
and at the same time it seems to me becom­ in- for the persons here on the present occasion to give glory to the god.
If then this seems good to you likewise, there will be a sufficient subject of discussion before us.
For I vote that each of us shall speak in praise of Love, an oration, the most beautiful he can, proceeding on the right-hand side;
and that Phædrus shall begin, as he is reclining at the top, and is;
moreover, the father of the discussion.
-Not a single person, Eryximachus, said Socratcs, will give a contrary vote.57
For neither would I say no, who say that I know nothing else than the matters relating to love;
nor would Agatho, nor Pau­ sanias,58 nor would, I ween,59 Aristophanes, whose whole occupation is relating to Dionysus and Aphrodité;
60 nor would any one else of these whom I see here.
And yet it is not fair and equal for us who are reclining the lowest down.
However, if those who are before us shall speak sufficiently and well, it will be enough for us.
Let Phædrus then, with fortune favouring, begin and make a panegyric upon Love. [6.]
To this all the rest assented, and bade him do, as So­ crates (had said).
Of all then which each person said, neither had Aristodemus a perfect recollection, nor have I of all that he told me:
but61 what was said, and by whom, that seemed to be 61 worth remembering on these points, I will detail the speech of each individual.
He told me then, as I say, that Phædrus first began some­ what after this way, and said-Love is a deity mighty and wonderful amongst men and gods, on many other accounts, and not the least as regards his origin.
For to be one of the oldest of the gods, is a thing (said he) 62 of honour.
And there is a proof of this.
For the parents of Love neither exist, nor are said by any individual63 or.
poet to exist.
64 Now Hesiod says, (in Theogon.
116,) Chaos was first produced;
Earth rose the next, Wide-bosomed, a firm seat for all;
then Love- 65 the poet says that next after Chaos were born these two, Earth and Love.65 And Parmenides says of 66 Generation, that it 66 Plann'd that of all the gods Love should be first.
65Acousilaus too agrees with Hesiod.
Thus on many sides it is confessed that Love is among the most ancient (of things).
And being the most ancient,67 he is the cause to us of the great­ est good.
67 For to a person 68 being now young,68 I cannot men­ tion what is a greater good than a useful lover, or69 to a lover than an object of affection.
For that, which should lead persons who are to live correctly through the whole of life, neither consanguinity70 is able to produce in us, nor honours, nor wealth, nor any thing else, so well as love;
711 mean some such thing as71 the shame for base acts, and the love of glory for honourable deeds.
For without these (two) it is not pos­ sible for a state or individual to accomplish any thing great or honourable.
I assert therefore that he, who loves, if he is found committing any base act, or suffering one from any body, and failing through cowardice to revenge himself, would not be in so much pain, when seen by his father and friends or any one else, as by the object of his affection.
In the very same manner, we see that the party loved is vehemently ashamed before the parties loving, if discovered doing any dis­ honourable act.
If then there could be any contrivance to form a city or an army of persons loving and loved, it is not possible for them to regulate 72 their own country better72 than by abstaining from every thing base, and having a desire to be honoured by one another (for what is noble);
;
73 and fight­ ing side by side, such persons, although few in number, would conquer, so to say, the whole world.
For a lover would less endure to be seen by his beloved, when deserting his post, or throwing away his arms, than by all the others;
and in pre­ ference to this, 74either to leave behind his beloved (when he has fallen,)74 or not to assist him when in danger, he would rather die many deaths.
There is not a man so much of a coward as that Love would not divinely inspire him to deeds of valour, and make him equal to the very best by birth. [7.]
And in good truth, what Homer says,75 that a god did into some heroes breathe a spirit, this, from himself produced, does Love to (all)76 lovers furnish.
Moreover, to die (for another)77 lovers alone are ready, not only men, but women too.
Of this Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, affords a sufficient proof amongst the Hellenes in behalf of this reasoning, in being alone willing to die for her husband, although his father and mother were then living;
whom she so much excelled in affec­ tion through love as to prove them to be aliens (in blood) to their own son, and relations only in name.
And having done this deed so noble, she was thought by not only men, but the gods likewise, to have effected that, although many had achieved many and noble acts, to only some,78 to be easily count­ ed, did the gods grant this as a gift, for the soul to return from Hades;
but79 they sent her back, struck with admiration of the deed.
Thus do even the gods especially honour the zeal bestowed on Love and valour.
But Orpheus, the son of Oeagrus, did the gods send back from Hades with his object unaccomplished, by showing him the phantom merely of his .wife, for whom he went, and not restoring her real self;
be­ cause he appeared to act the coward, as being a harper, and not daring, like Alcestis, to die for Love, but contriving to go alive to Hades.
Hence on this very account did the gods impose on him a punishment, and caused his death to take place at the hands of women.
Not so did they honour him, as they did Achilles, the son of Thetis, whom they sent even to the islands of the blest,80 because, having heard from his mother, that he would die himself, after he had slain Hector, but that if he slew not Hector, he would return home and die an old man, he dared to prefer, after aiding his lover Patroclus and avenging his fate, not only to die for him, but over him when dead.
From whence the gods, being amazingly struck with admiration, honoured him exceedingly, because he had valued so highly the person who had loved him.
For Æschylus 81 talks idly, in saying that Achilles was in love with Patroclus;
for Achilles was more handsome not only than Patroclus, but all the other heroes, and still beardless, and moreover, as Homer says,82 much younger.
But in reality the gods honour most the valour, which is shown in behalf of love :
they still feel a greater wonder and admiration, and act more kindly, when the person loved has an affection for the lover, than when the lover has for the loved.
For the lover is more of a godlike thing than the loved, as being in­ spired by a god.
On this account did (the gods) honour Achilles even more than Alcestis, by sending him to the islands of the blest.
Thus then do I assert that Love is the most ancient, and most honoured, and most- powerful of the gods, for the attainment of valour and happiness by man both during life and in the grave.[8.]
Some such speech as this, Aristodemus told me, did Phædrus pronounce.
But after Phædrus, there were somne others, which he did not well remember;
and omitting these, he repeated that of Pausanias, who said:
-
The subject, Phædrus, does not seem to me to have been fairly set before us, when it was simply proposed to make an encomium upon Love.
This would have been well had there been but one Love;
83but now it is not, for one there is not83
Since then one there is not, the better way is for it to be stated beforehand which kind of love we ought to praise.
I will endeavour then to put the question on a right footing, and to state first what Love we ought to praise;
and then to praise in a manner worthy of the god.
We all know that without Love Venus is not.
If then there were only one Venus, there would have been only one Love.
But since there are two, there must be likewise two Loves.
And how are there not two,84 one the elder, and who had no mother, a daughter of Uranus, (Heaven,) whom we name the celestial;
the other, younger, a daughter of Jupiter and Dione, whom we call the vulgar.
It is necessary then for the Love who works with the latter Venus to be called the vulgar, but the other, the celestial.
All the gods, indeed, we ought to praise;
but we must endeavour to state what each has obtained by lot.
For every action is in this state;
it is itself by itself neither honourable nor base;
as for instance, what we are now doing, either drinking, or singing, or discoursing, there is not one of these acts which is good, itself by itself, but it turns out such in the doing.
Rightly performed 85 [according as it may be done] 85 it is right and honourably ;
not rightly performed, it is dishonourable.
So in the case of loving, not every Love is honourable, and worthy to be highly praised, but that which impels to loving honourably.
The one then belonging to the vulgar Venus is a Love truly vulgar, and works out whatever may happen;
and this it is which inspires the worthless love;
and such persons in the first place love women not less than boys;
and next, of such as they love, (they love) the bodies rather than the minds;
86and then of persons the most silly that can be,86 through their looking only to the act of enjoyment, and disregarding the doing so honourably or not.
And hence it results that they do whatever they may have in their power,87 whether good or the reverse.
88 For there is even from the younger deity much than from the other, and partaking of the female and male in its generation.
88 But that from the celestial Venus, 89 in the first place, not partaking of the female, but only of the male, land this is the love of boys]:
next of the elder, and a not sharing in lust;
89 and hence they who are inspired by this love, turn themselves to the male, feeling an affection for that which is naturally of greater strength and possesses more of mind. [9.]
And any one would in the boy-love itself discover those sincerely impelled by this passion.
For they do not love boys, but (youths),90 when they are beginning to possess mind.
91 Now this is near the time of their obtaining a beard.
91
But they who begin from this date to love, are, I think, prepared, as if about to associate through the whole of life together, and to live in common, 92and not, after having obtained an object in an hour of imprudence, through cheating him as a youth, to go away, laughing at him, and to run to another one.
92
There ought then to be a law not to love a boy, in order that much care may not be wasted upon an uncertainty;
for it is uncertain to what end may come that relating to boys, whether of vice or virtue, as regards the body or soul.
Such a law do men of virtue indeed lay down, themselves for themselves, of their own accord ;
but we ought to compel in some such way as this those vulgar lovers;
just as we compel them, as -far as we can, not to fall in love with free-born women.
For it is such lovers as these who give rise to the reproach, that, as some dare to say, it is shameful to gratify a lover.
Now they say so with a view to lovers of this kind, from witness­ in- their conduct at once unseasonable and unjust.
For certainly no act done decently and lawfully can bring with it justly blame.
And indeed the law relating to love in other states is easy to be understood, for it has been defined with simplicity;
but that one here, and that at Sparta, are com­ plex.
For in Elis, and amongst the Bœotians, and wherever there are not persons clever in speaking, the law is laid down simply, that it is honourable to gratify a lover;
nor would any one there, either young or old, say that it is disgraceful, in order, I presume, that they who endeavour to persuade over the youths, may not be put to trouble, as being unskilled in speaking.
But by those 93 in Ionia, and many other places, 94 [where persons live under the barbarians,] 94 it is held to be dishonourable.
For through their tyrannical governments this, and the love of wisdom and of gymnastic exercises,95 (are considered) disgraceful.
For it is not, I conceive, to the interest of the rulers that high thoughts should be engendered in their subjects, nor strong friendships formed, nor societies in common;
all which96 those other things and love especially is wont to introduce.
And thus by experience learnt the tyrants here.
For the love of Aristogeiton and the firm friendship of Harmodius dissolved their power.97 [10.]
And thus, wherever it has been held disgraceful to gratify a lover, it has been so laid down through the depravity of the legis­ lators, and the desire of possession in the rulers, and the want of manliness in the ruled ;
but wherever it is simply enjoined, it is through the listlessness of soul in the legislators.
But here the law is placed upon a better footing;
although, as I said before, it is not easy to understand it.
For to a person considering98 that it is reputed more honourable to love openly than secretly, and especially the most nobly born and the best, even though they be uglier than others;
and on the other hand, that 99the exhortation to a lover from all parties is wonderful, as if he were not doing something disgraceful, and that it appears to be honourable to the party obtaining, but not obtaining disgraceful;
and that towards making the attempt to obtain, the law grants a permission to the lover, while doing wonderful 100 acts, to be commended, such acts as, should a person dare to do when pursuing any thing else whatever, and desirous to accomplish it, except this, he would obtain as the fruit of his doings, the greatest reproaches of philosophy.
1
For if with a desire either to obtain money from any one, or an office in the government, or a power of any other kind, a person would be willing to do what lovers do towards their boy-loves, by making supplications, and urgent requests [in their beggings],2 and swearing oaths, 3lying down down at their doors, and willingly enduring a servitude3 such as not even a slave would endure, he would be stopped from acting in this way both by friends and enemies;
the latter reproaching him for his fawning and want of spirit, and the former giving him advice, and feeling ashamed on his behalf.
But even a grace follows4 the lover when doing all this;
and he is allowed by the law to do so without reproach, as performing some very honourable act.
But the most terrible thing is what the multitude say, that there is to him alone, after swearing an oath, a pardon from the gods for transgressing it.
5"For an oath, they say, of Venus is no oath."5
Thus both gods and men give all kinds of licence to the lover, as says the law here.
In this way then a person would imagine that in this state it is held a very honourable thing both to love and to be the friend to a lover. [11.]
But when we see that parents, after appointing instructors over the loved, do not permit them to have any intercourse with their lovers, and that orders are given to this effect to the in­ structor, and when their equals in age and companions censure them, if they see any such thing taking place, and when the old folks do not stop the censurers, nor abuse them for speak­ ing not correctly, a person, looking to such acts, would imagine, on the contrary, that love of this kind is here held to be disgraceful.
But the case I conceive stands thus.
As it was stated at the beginning, (to love) is not a simple thing.
Taken itself by itself I conceive it to be6 neither honourable nor disgraceful;
but if carried on honourably, it is honour­ able;
if disgracefully, disgraceful.
Now to gratify a vicious person in a vicious manner is (to carry it on) disgracefully;
but ( to gratify) a virtuous person in a virtuous manner (is to carry it on) honourably.
The vicious lover is he of the vul­ gar kind, who is in love with the body rather than the mind.
For he is not a lasting lover, being in love with a thing which is not lasting;
since, with the decaying flower of the body, of which he is enamoured,7 he goes away on wing,8 putting to shame all his speeches and promises.
But he who is enamour­ ed of a virtuous character, abides a lover through life, as being closely united with what is itself abiding.
Now these our law is desirous to test well and truly, and (to permit)9 persons to gratify some, and to fly from others.
On this account therefore it exhorts some to pursue, but others to fly;
by appointing itself the judge in a contest, and testing of what kind is the lover, and of what the loved.
And thus 10by this very reason10 it is held by law to be disgraceful, in the first place, for a person to be cap­ tivated quickly;
in order that time may intervene, which seems to be of many things the fairest test;
in the next place, it is held disgraceful for a person to be caught by considerations of money or political power;
whether he crouch on being ill used and do not bear up manfully, or whether, being kindly treated as regards pecuniary and political transactions, he does not feel a contempt.
For none of these things appear to be firm and abiding, without a generous friendship being pro­ duced from them. [12.]
There is left then one only way for our law, if the object in view is to gratify honourably the lover.
For our law.
is, as it was in the case of lovers, that for a person willing to endure any servitude whatever for his beloved youth, it is not an act of fawning nor worthy of reproach.
11 Thus then there is left only one other willing servitude not worthy of reproach;
11 and this is that which relates to virtue.
For it is a settled law with us, that whoever wishes to pay court to any one, conceiving that through that person he shall be­ come better as regards wisdom, or any other part of virtue, such voluntary servitude again12 is neither disgraceful nor an act of fawning.
Now these two laws ought to come to the same point, and both the one relating to the love of youths, and the other relating to philosophy and the other parts of virtue, if indeed it is about to be agreed that it is honourable to gratify a lover.
For, when the lover and the beloved youth come to­ gether, each having their (respective) laws, the one in minister­ ing to the beloved youth, who is complying, 13would justly minister any thing whatever, and the other (being subservient to the person making him both wise and good, would on the other hand be justly subservient13 in any thing whatever.
For the one being able to make a collision14 for the attain­ ment of prudence and the other parts of virtue, and the other being desirous to acquire instruction15 and the.
other parts of wisdom, then only indeed while these two parties 16 come to the same spot,16 do (the matters relating to) the two laws fall to the same point, (so that) it is honourable for the boy to gratify a lover ?
And in this case it is no disgrace to be deceived;
17but in the others it brings on shame (equally) to, the party deceived or not.17
For if any one for the sake of.
money gratifies a lover as being wealthy, and is disappointed, and obtains no money, through the lover being found to be poor, the act is not at all the less disgraceful;
for such a person seems to lay open his character, and that for the sake of money he would minister in any thing to any person.
Now this is not honourable.
By parity of reasoning, should any one gratify a person, as if he were virtuous, and with the view of becoming himself better through the friendship of the lover, and be disappointed through his being found to be a bad man, and not possessed of virtue, the disappointment neverthe­ less is still honourable:
for on the other hand, this person too seems to have laid open his character, and that for the sake of virtue, and to be made better, he would be ready to (minister)18 in every thing to every one.,
Now this, on the other hand, is of all acts the most honourable.
So entirely honourable is it to gratify for the sake of virtue.
This is that love, the (co-worker) of the celestial Venus, (himself) 19 ce­ lestial, and of great value to both the state and individuals, through compelling, both the lover himself and the party beloved by him, to pay considerable attention to virtue;
but all the others belong to the other Venus, the vulgar.
Thus much, Phædrus, have I to contribute, said he, on the instant, upon the subject of love.[13.]
On Pausanias pausing,-for the wise teach me to talk thus in parities,20—Aristodemus told me, that Aristo­ phanes should have spoken:
but either from repletion, or some other cause, a fit of the hiccups happened to come upon him, and he became unable to speak;
and he said to the physician, Eryximachus, who was reclining lower, You are the proper person, Eryximachus, either to stop my hiccups, or to speak in my turn, until I cease from them myself.
-To which Eryximachus replied, I will do both.
I will speak in your turn, and when your hiccups are gone you shall speak in mine:
and while I am speaking, should the hiccups cease, through your keeping yourself without breathing for some time, (it is well,)21 but if not, gargle your throat with water;
and if they are very violent, take some such thing as this, with which you can tickle22 your nose and then sneeze;
and when you have done so once or twice the hiccups will cease,23 be they ever so violent.
—You will not say a word, says Aristophanes, before I do so.—Eryximachus then said-
Since then Pausanias, after setting out so well on the sub- ject has ended imperfectly, 24 it seems that I must of neces­ sity24 endeavour to put the finish to the speech.
In dis­ tinguishing Love into two kinds, he appears to me to have correctly divided.
And that the Love exists not only in the soul of man for beautiful persons, but for many other objects in other beings likewise, in the bodies of all animals as well as in the productions of the earth, and, so to speak, in all existing things I seem to myself to see clearly from my own healing art;
and how great land wonderful] 25 a god is Love, who ex­ tends his sway over all, as regards things human and divine.
And I will commence with the healing art in order that I may give the highest honours to my own profession. [14.]
Now the very nature of our bodies partakes of this twofold love.
For health and disease in the body are confessedly different and unlike.
Now the unlike longs for and loves the unlike.
The love in a healthy body is of one kind;
the love in a dis­ eased body is of another.
Now it is, as Pausanias just stated, honourable to gratify the good amongst men, but dishonour­ able the vicious;
so in the case of bodies themselves, to gratify the good and healthy parts of each is well and necessary, and this it is from which there is the name of the healing art.
But (to gratify) the bad and diseased is disgraceful;
and he who would act according to art, must deny the gratification.
26
For medical science, to speak summarily, is the knowledge of the feelings of love in the body relating to repletion and evacuation ;
27 and he, who in these appetites can distinguish the right love and wrong, is the best physician;
while he who causes a change, so as to obtain one in the place of the other, and knows how to infuse a love into those bodies in which it is not, but ought to be, and' how to expel a love which is there, but ought not to be, would be a skilful practitioner.
For he should be able to cause things in the body, that are most hostile, to be friendly and to love each other.
Now the -things most hostile are such as are the most contrary, as cold is to hot, [bitter to sweet,] 28 dry to moist, (and) 29 all things of that sort.
Into these things our ancestor Æsculapius, know­ in,, how to introduce love and concord, as say the poets here,30 and as I believe, put together our art.
And the present 31 art of healing is, as I state, entirely regulated by this very deity.
And in like manner 32 is the gymnastic art, .and agriculture.33
And it is evident to every one, who gives even a little attention to the subject, that music is in the same state as the others, as Heracleitus perhaps meant to say;
for he expresses himself not clearly in his language.
For he says that the one disagreeing with itself is carried on like the harmony of the bow and lyre.35
Now it is very irrational to say that harmony differs (from itself);
or that it exists from things that differ:
but perhaps he meant to say this;
that from a sharp and flat, different originally, (a harmony)36 is produced from their subsequent agreement through the art of musicians.
For harmony cannot assuredly consist of sharp and flat sounds, while still disagreeing;
because harmony is consonance, and consonance is a kind of agreement;
and it is impossible for any agreement to exist between things disa- greeing, so long as they disagree ;
37 [and on the other hand, it is impossible to fit a thing disagreeing and not agreeing] .37 So too rhythm38 is produced from notes quick and slow pre­ viously disagreeing, but subsequently agreeing.
As there the medical art, so here the musical art, introduces in all these39 an agreement, by affecting a love of and a concord with each other;
and thus music is the knowledge of amorous (unions) relating to harmony and rhythm. [15.]
Now in this com­ bination itself of harmony and rhythm, it is not at all difficult to know thoroughly the amorous (unions);
for the twofold love exists there not at all.
But when it shall be necessary to misuse40 rhythm and harmony, applied to mankind, by a person composing, what is called setting to music, or in making a right use of melodies and measure composed -already, which is called instruction, there indeed the thing is very difficult, and requires a skilful practitioner.
For here recurs the same reasoning (as before), that we must gratify the well-ordered, and those who would be, but are not as yet, better ordered, and we must guard their love.
For this is the honourable, the heavenly, the (co-worker with) the heavenly muse.
But the (co-worker with) Polyhymnia is the vulgar love, whom a person ought with caution41 to bring to whom he may bring it, in order that men may enjoy42 the pleasure from it, and that he may not introduce any intemperance;
just as in our own art it is a matter of moment to use correctly the appe­ tites relating to the confectioner's art, so that a person may enjoy the pleasure without detriment to health.
Thus, in mu­ sic, and in medicine, and in all other things, both human and divine, we must, as far as is permissible, watch each of those Loves:
for both exist.
Since even the constitution of the seasons of the year is full of both these ;
and when the hot and the cold, the dry and the moist, which I mentioned be­ fore, meet in opposition to each other, with a well-regulated love, and receive a temperate fitting-together and combina­ tion, they come bringing in their train a year of good seasons and health to men, and the rest of43 animals, and plants, and do no injury.
44
But when the love which is mixed up with ungovernable passion becomes rather violent as regards the seasons of the year, it destroys or injures many things.
For from such seasons are wont to be produced plagues and many other unequal45 disorders on wild beasts and plants.
For hoar-frosts, and hail-storms, and mildews are generated from the excessive and disorderly state of such feelings of love with respect to each other;
the knowledge of which, as re- gards the movements of the stars and the seasons of the year, is called astronomy.
46
Further still, all kinds of sacrifice, and the things over which the diviner's art presides-now these are the reciprocal intercourse between gods and men— are conversant about nothing else than the guardianship and the healing47 of Love.
For every kind of impiety is wont to be generated, if one does not gratify the well-ordered Love, and honour him, and hold him as the chief,—but serve43 rather the other,-in every act relating to parents living and dead, and to the gods,49 according as it has been ordained for the divining art to superintend the Loves and to heal them.49
And again, the divining art is the artificer, skilled (in promoting) friendship between gods and men, through knowing what things relating to Love amongst mortals tend to justice and impiety (respect­ ively).
So various and vast, or rather universal, a power does every kind, to speak in one word, of Love possess.
But that which is conversant about the good, and is effected in union with temperance and justice, both towards us and the gods, this is the one that has the greatest power, and procures for us every kind of happiness, so as50 to enable us to asso­ ciate with each other, and to be dear to beings superior to ourselves, [the gods].
51
It is possible, indeed, that I too, in praising Love, have omitted many things;
not, however, in­ tentionally.
But if I have left out aught, it is your business, Aristophanes, to fill it up;
or, if you have it in your mind to praise the god in any other way,52 praise him, now that your hiccups have ceased.[16.]
He said then that Aristophanes, taking up the dis­ course, observed that-the hiccups had very much53 ceased, not however before the sneezing was applied to them, so that I wonder how a well-ordered part of the body should be in love with such noises and ticklings, such as sneezing is:
for when I brought to it a sneezing it immediately ceased entirely.-
Upon this said Eryximachus, My good (friend) Aristophanes, consider what you are doing.
For being about to speak, you are acting the buffoon,54 and compel me to keep a watch over your speech,55 lest you say aught to excite a laugh, when you might speak in peace.
-To which Aristophanes, with a smile, replied, You have spoken correctly, Eryximachus;
and let what I said just now be considered as unsaid.
But do not watch me.
Since I have a fear of what is about to be said, lest I should say not what will be laughable-for that would be an advantage and indigenous to my muse-but to be laughed down.-
Having shot your bolt, Aristophanes, said Eryxima­ chus, think you to escape ?
But have a care, and so speak, as if about to give an account for it.
Perhaps, however, if it seem good to me, I shall dismiss you (unhurt).
56In good truth, Eryximachus, said Aristophanes, I have it in my mind to speak in some other way than you and Pausa­ nias have spoken.
For to me men appear to be utterly in­ sensible of the power of Love.
Since, being sensible of it, they would have instituted most important sacred rites, and (built) altars, and made to him the greatest sacrifices ;
57 nor, as now, would any thing of this kind have occurred, at a time when it ought to have occurred the least.
For he is, of all the gods, the most friendly to 58 man, the aider of man, and the healer of those (wounds)59 which, being healed, there would be the greatest happiness to the human 58 race.
I will, therefore, endeavour to explain to you his power, and you shall be the teacher of it to others.
But you must first learn the nature of man, and what sufferings it has undergone.
For our nature of old was not the same as it is now.
In the first place, there were three kinds of human beings, not as at present, only two, male and female;
but there was also a third common to both of those;
the name only of which now remains, it has itself disappeared.
It was then [one] 60 man- woman,61 whose form and name partook of and was common to both the male and the female.
But it is now nothing but a name, given by way of reproach.
In the next place, the entire form of every individual of the human race was round­ ed, having the back and sides as in a circle.
It had four hands, and legs equal in number to the hands;
and two faces upon the circular neck, alike in every way, and one head on both the faces placed opposite,62 and four ears, and two kinds of sexual organs, and from these it is easy to conjecture how all the other parts were (doubled).
63
They walked, as now, upright, whithersoever they pleased.
And when it made haste to run, it did, 64 in the manner of tumblers, who after turning their legs (upward) in a circle, place them accurately in an upright position,64 support itself on its eight limbs,65 and after­ wards turn itself over quickly in a circle.
Now these three and such kinds of beings existed on this account, 66 because the male kind was the produce originally of the sun, the female of the earth, and that which partook of the other two, of the moon;
66 for the moon partakes of both the others (the sun and the earth).
The bodies thus were round, and the man­ ner of their running was circular, through their being like their parents. [17.]
They were terrible in force and strength and had high aspirations, and they made an attempt against the gods;
and what Homer (in Οδ. X. 307) says of Ephi­ altus and Otus, was told of them likewise ;
that they attempt­ ed to ascend to heaven with the view of attacking the gods.
Upon which Jupiter and the other gods consulted together what they should do to them;
but they were in a difficulty.
They had not the mind to destroy them by making the race to disappear with the thunderbolt, as they did the giants ;
for then the honours and the holy rites paid them by that race would have been extinct,67 nor yet could they suffer them to act wan­ tonly.
At length Jupiter, on reflection, said, I seem to myself to have a plan, so that men may exist, and still be stopt by becom- ing weaker from their unbridled licentiousness.
For now, said he, I will divide each of them into two ;
and they will at the same time become weaker, and at the same time more useful to us, through their becoming more in number;
and they shall walk upright upon two legs;
but if they shall think fit to behave licentiously, and are not willing to keep quiet, I will again, said he, divide them, each into two, so that they shall go upon one leg, hopping.
So saying, he cut men into two parts, as people cut medlars68 when about to pickle them, or as they cut eggs with hairs.
But whomsoever he cut, he ordered Apollo 69to turn the face and the half of the neck to that part where the section had taken place, in order that the man might, on seeing the cutting off,69 be better behaved than before, and he ordered 70 him to heal the other parts.
And he (Apollo) turned the face;
and 71 pulling the skin together on every side like a contracted purse,71 over that which is now called the belly, he did, after making a single orifice, tie up (the skin) at the middle of the belly, now called the navel.
He then smoothed the greater part of the remainder of the wrinkles of the skin, and jointed the breast, having an instrument such as shoemakers use when they smooth wrinkles of the leather on the last.
But he left a few wrinkles on the belly and navel as a memorial of their original suffering.
Now when their nature had been bisected, each half perceived with a longing its other self;
72 and throwing their arms around each other and becoming entwined, they had a great desire to grow together, but they died through famine and idleness.
73
And when one of these halves died, and the other was left, the surviving half sought another, and was entwined with it, whether it met with the half - of a whole woman, (which half .we now call a woman,) or with (the half of a whole) man.
And thus they were in the act of perishing. [18.]
But Jupiter in pity de­ vised another plan, and placed the organs of generation in front,74 for 75hitherto they had been on the outside, and they begot and bred, not with one another, but with the earth;
like grasshoppers.
And therefore he changed them 76 to the front;
and by them he caused the generation to be with each other, from the female through the male, on this account, that should a male meet with a female, they might in the embrace at one time generate, and the race be thus propagated;
but if at another time a male met with a male, a surfeit might take place from the connexion, and that they might cease and turn themselves to their business, and attend to the other affairs of life.
From this77 (period) has been implanted by nature in mankind a mutual love, which is the bringer together of their ancient nature, and which endeavours to make one out of two, and to heal the nature 78 of man.
Each of us then is but the counterpart 79 of a human creature, as having been cut like the Psettæ80 from one into two.
Hence each one is in search of his counterpart.
As many men then as are sections of the form common to men, which was then called Man-Woman, are lovers of women;
and from this race are sprung the majority of adulterers:
and on the other hand, as many women as are addicted to the love of men, and are adulteresses, are sprung from the same81 race.
But such women as are sections of the female, do not pay much attention to men, but turn themselves rather to women;
and from this race are the (Lesbian) courtesans.
Such as are sections of the male form, follow the males:
and whilst they are young, being fragments of men, they love men and are delighted in being with them;
and these are the best of boys and youths, as being the most manly in their disposition.
Yet some say, indeed, they are shameless.
But in this they say false;
for it is not through shamelessness, but through assurance, and a manly temper and manly look, that they embrace what resembles themselves.
And of this there is a great proof.
For when they are full grown, such alone turn out men as regards political affairs:
but when they have be­ come men, they feel a love for young persons, and do not turn their thoughts to marriage and child-getting naturally, but are led by the force of custom and law,82 although it would be sufficient for them to continue to live unmarried. .
Altogether then such a person is both a lover of youths and a lover of those who love him, and ever embraces what is from the same race as himself. [19.]
Now, whenever 83the lover of youths, and every one else,83 meet with that very thing, the half of him­ self, they are both smitten with a friendship in a wondrous manner, and (attracted)84 by an intimacy and love, and are un­ willing to be separated from each other for even, so to say, a brief period.
And these are they, who continue to live together through life;
and yet they could not tell what they wish to take place to themselves from each other;
for it does not seem to be sexual intercourse, that the one should, for the sake of that, be delighted with the company of the other, and (seek it) with so much trouble;
but the soul of each being evidently de­ sirous of something else, which it is unable to tell, it divines what it wishes, and hints at it.85
And if while they are lying down in the same place, Vulcan were to stand over them with his tools in his hand, and ask them "
What is it do ye, mortals, desire to take place, the one by the other?" and if, finding them in a difficulty, were he to demand them again, “Do ye desire this, to be as much as possible in the same place with each other, so as never, by night or day, to be apart from each other ?
86 for if ye long for this, I am willing to melt you down together, and to mould you into the same mass, so that ye two may become one,86 and as long as ye live, may live both of you in common, as one person;
and when ye die, may, having died in common, 87remain for ever87 in Hades, one (soul) instead of two.
See then whether ye desire this, and it is sufficient for you, should ye obtain it."
On hearing this not a single person, I know that, would refuse, nor would he appear to wish for anything else ;
but (every one)88 would in reality conceive he had heard that which he had long ago wished for, and that having come into the company of, and be­ ing melted with, his beloved, he would out of two become one.
And of this89 the cause is, that this was our original nature.
We were once whole.
To the desire then and pursuit of this whole, the name of Love is given.
And we were, as I said, formerly one.
But now, for our iniquity, 90 we have been cut in twain90 by the deity, and have been made, like the Area­ dians by the Lacedæmonians, to dwell asunder.90
There is therefore a fear, that, unless we are well-behaved towards the gods, we shall be again cleft in twain, and go about with our noses split down, as those have, who are modelled on pillars in profile,91 and become, 92 as it were, pebbles cut through and rubbed smooth.
On this account then,92 it is meet to exhort every man to behave in all things piously towards the gods, that we may on the one hand escape from the ills, 93 and on the other obtain the good,93 to which Love is our guide and general;
to whom let no one act in opposition.
For he I who acts in opposition, is an enemy to the gods.
But by be­ coming friends and being reconciled to the god, we shall, what few of those now living do, find and meet with our beloved, the halves94 of ourselves.
And let not Eryximachus take me up, and ridicule my speech, as if I meant Pausanias and Agatho.
For perhaps they are amongst such, (the fortunate few,) and are both of them males in nature.95 I say then of all in general, both men and women, that the whole of our race would be happy, if we worked out Love perfectly;
and if each were to meet with his beloved, having returned96 to his original nature.
If this then be the best, it necessarily follows, that of the things now present, that which is nearest to this is the best;
and that is, to meet with youthful objects of love that are naturally suited to one's ideas.
In celebrating then the deity who is the cause of this fitness, we should justly celebrate Love;
who both at the present time benefits us the most, by leading us to our own;
and for hereafter gives us the greatest hopes, that, if we pay the debt of piety to the gods, he will restore us to our original nature, and, by healing us, render us happy.[20.]
Such, Eryximachus, said he, is my speech, in be­ half of Love, of a different kind from yours.
As then I requested, do not ridicule it, in order that we may hear what each of the rest will say;
or rather what both will;
for the rest are only Agatho and Socrates.
He stated then that Eryximachus said, I will be obedient;
for the speech has been spoken in a delightful manner;
and if I were not conscious that Socrates and Agatho were deeply versed in affairs of Love, I should have greatly feared they would be at a loss for reasons through there having been said so much, and of all kinds.
But now I have every confidence.
—(This,) said Socrates,(is all very well for you,) Eryximachus ;
since you have already gone through the ordeal yourself with honour.
But if you were, where I am now, or rather per­ haps where I shall be, when Agatho shall have spoken his speech cleverly,97 you would be in a very great fright, and in every (kind of heart-sinking),98 as I am now.
—You wish, So- crates, said Agatho, to drug me, in order that I may be con­ fused through thinking that the spectators have a great ex­ pectation of my.
being about to make a clever speech.—I should have been, Agatho, forgetful indeed, if, after witnessing your courage and high spirit, when you came upon the stage with the performers and looking so numerous an audience in the face, you were about to exhibit your compositions without being in the least daunted, I thought you could be now dis­ turbed on account of us, so few in number.
-Surely,
So­ crates, said Agatho, you do not think me so inflated by a theatrical audience,99 as not to know that to a man, who has any mind, a few persons of sense are more awful than a multitude of fools.
—I should be acting not at all correctly, said Socrates, if I thought there was any thing about you, Agatho, of a boor­ ish nature.
But I know very well, that if you met with any whom you considered wise, you would think more of them than of the multitude.
But I fear we are not such ;
for we were there likewise, and made a part of that multitude.
But if you had met with other wise men, you would perhaps have felt a shame before them, had you thought you were doing an act really100 disgraceful.
Is it not so ?
or how say you ?-It is true, said Agatho.
—But before the multitude, said Socrates, would you not feel a shame, if you thought you were doing any thing base ?-Hereupon Phædrus, taking up the discourse, said, If, dear Agatho, you will give Socrates an answer, it will be no manner of concern to him what becomes of any thing whatever here, or if he can only have somebody to converse with, and especially one who is handsome.
I confess I do with much pleasure hear Socrates conversing:
but it is ne­ cessary for me to take care of the panegyric upon Love, and to receive1 a speech from every one of you.
But do both of you pay1 thus your tribute to the god, and then converse.
You say well, Phædrus, (said Agatho);
and there is nothing to prevent me from beginning my speech.
For I shall have frequently the means of conversing again with Socrates.[21.]
I wish in the first place to state how I ought to speak;
and I will then so speak.
2
For all of those who have spoken before me, appear to me to have celebrated not the god, but to felicitate mankind upon the good, of which the god is the cause.
But what he is himself, who has bestow­ ed these gifts, not one of them has explained.
Now upon each subject of every panegyric, there is only one correct method ;
and that is, to detail in a rational way of how great things how great a cause is he, respecting whom the dis­ course may be.3
In this way then it is meet for us to make the encomium upon Love, (by showing,) first, how great he is, and afterwards his gifts.
I assert then, that of all the gods (in reality)4 blessed, Love is, if it is lawful to say so, and without calling down vengeance, the most blessed of all the gods, and at once5 the most beautiful and the best.
6But such he is, being the most beautiful.
6
In the first place, he is, Phædrus, the youngest of the gods.
Of this asser- tion he affords himself a powerful proof, by running away in haste from Old Age, who is quick-footed, it is plain, at least it approaches quicker than is necessary;
and which, indeed, Love naturally hates, nor does he come near to it within a great (distance);
7 but he is ever with the young, and is.
8
For, as the old proverb rightly has it, " Like always doth approach to like."9 Now, though I agree with Phæ­ drus in many other points, I do not agree in this, that Love is older than Saturn and Japetus ;
but of gods, I affirm, he is the youngest, and is ever young, and that the doings 10 of the olden time, which Hesiod and Parmenides detail, were pro­ duced, if indeed they say true, by the power of Necessity, and not Love.
For, had Love been with them, there had been no castrations,11 nor bindings,12 nor those many other acts of violence, but friendship and peace, as now, from the time when Love came to be the ruler of the gods.
Thus then he is young, and in addition to being young is a tender being.
But he wants a poet, such as Homer was, to express the ten- derness of the god.
Now Homer describes
Ate as a goddess, and of a tender frame.
At least he speaks of her feet as being tender:
Her feet are tender;
not on ground she stalks, But on the top 13 of human heads she walks.
The poet then seems to me to show by such a proof her ten.
derness;
because she walks not upon a hard place, but a soft one.
And the same proof we shall use respecting Love, that he too is tender.
For he neither walks on the ground, nor upon (human) skulls, which in truth are places not very soft;
but on the softest of all existing things, he walks and dwells there.
For he has fixed his abode in the dispositions and souls of gods and men :
14 and yet not in all souls indiscriminately:
but whenever he meets with a soul possessing a harsh dispo­ sition, away he goes, and takes up his abode with a tender one.
Since, then, he is ever touching with his feet, and in every way the softest parts in the softest persons, he must needs be extremely tender.
Thus then he is very young and very tender;
and in addition to these qualities he is of a flexible form.
For he would not be able to entwine himself around every thing, nor to pass through every soul, at first unperceived, and to go out (again),15 if he were of a hard substance.
And a great proof of his form being in proportion 16 and flexible, is in its gracefulness, which Love confessedly possesses in a man­ ner superior to all.
For between Ungracefulness and Love there is always a war.
His diet too on flowers points out the beauty of his colour.
17 For Love does not settle upon a body, or any other spot where flowers are not, or where they have fallen off;
but wherever is a spot flowery and fragrant, there he settles and fixes his abode.17 [22.]
As regards then the beauty of the god 18 thus much is sufficient;
although much still remains.18 I must speak after this on virtue of Love.
Now is the highest (praise);
that he does no injury to a god or man, nor by a god or man is he injured.
Nor, if he suffers aught, does he suffer by violence;
for violence touches not Love;
nor if he does aught, does he it with violence ;
19 for every one willingly ministers in every thing to Love.20
But whatever one party agrees (to do) of his own accord for an­ other party of his own accord, such acts the laws, that are the rulers in a state, say are justly done.
In addition to jus­ tice, Love has the greatest share of temperance.
For to be superior to pleasures and to passions, is every where confessed to be temperance.
But no pleasure is superior to Love.
If then they are inferior, they will be Love's subjects;
and he will be their master;
and being thus superior to pleasures and passions, lie will be pre-eminently temperate.
Moreover, as regards valour, not Ares (Mars) himself can stand up against Love.21 22 For it is not Ares that holds Love, but Love Ares, (the son,) as the saying is, of Aphrodite22 (Venus).
Now he who holds is superior to the party held;
and he who is the master of the party more valiant than all the rest, will be the most valiant.
Thus then have we spoken of the justice, and temperance, and valour of the god ;
and it is left (to speak) of his wisdom.
As far then as we can, we must endeavour to be in no way wanting.
And in the first place, that I too may do honour to my own art, as Eryximachus did to his, the god is so clever a poet, that he is able to make even another person one.
23
For each becomes a poet, though before
He was not musical, when Love touches him.
23This testimony it is fitting for us to use, (to prove) that the poet Love is excellent for all the creative power con­ nected with the Muse.
For that, which one has not, or does not know, he can not either give to another or teach.
Moreover who will gainsay (the assertion) that the making of all animals is through the wisdom of Love, by which all living things are generated and produced?
24
Then as re­ gards handicraft-skill in arts, know we not that he, whose teacher is the deity, turns out a person of repute and il­ lustrious ;
but he on whom Love does not lay his hands, re­ mains in obscurity?
The art of the archer, and of the physician, and of the prophet, did Apollo invent, 25 under the guidance of Love;
so that he would be disciple of Love;
and (through desire;
the Muses (became the inventors) of music, and Hephæstus (Vulcan), of brass-working, and Athena (Minerva), of weaving, and Zeus (Jupiter), of governing gods and men.25
From whence26 then were the affairs of the gods put into order ?
Through the birth, it is plain, of the love of beauty;
for Love does not follow27 ugliness.
For previously, as I stated at the commencement, many and terrible things befell, as they say, the gods, through the rule of necessity.28
But when this god was born, through his loving all things of beauty, "to gods and men did all good things arise."29—[23.]
Thus, Phædrus,
Love appears to me to be, in the first place,30 himself the most beautiful and best;
in the next, to be the cause of such like beautiful things31 in other beings.
And it comes into my mind to speak something in verse, because he it is, who produces Peace amongst men, upon the sea a calm ;
Stillness on winds,32 on joyless bed sweet sleep.33 after Μου̃σαι has dropt out ἦσαν, and after ἀνθϱώπων, ἑυϱέται.
For thus only can we get rid of all the difficulties of the passage, which Ast and Stalbaum have vainly attempted to soften down.
It is he who divests us of all feelings of alienation;
and fills us with those of intimacy;
who establishes all34 meetings such as these, and in festivals, in dances, (and) in sacrifices,35 he becomes the leader;
introducing mildness, and banishing a harshness of manners;
the friendly giver of good-will, the non-giver of enmity;
gracious to the good;
looked up to by the wise, admired by the gods;
envied by those who have no let in life, possessed by those who have;
the parent of luxury, of tenderness, of elegance, of grace, of desire, and regret;
careful of the good, regardless of the bad;
in labour, in fear, in wishes, and in speech,36 the pilot, the encourager,37 the by­ stander, and best saviour:
38 of gods and men, taken all to­ gether, the ornament;
a leader the most beautiful and best;
39 in whose train it is the duty of every one to follow, hymning well his praise, and bearing a part in that sweet song which he sings himself when soothing the mind of every god and man.
—Let this my speech be offered up, Phædrus, said he, to Love, partaking, as best I could, in some parts of what is gay, in others of what is grave.[24.]
When Agatho had done speaking, all present, said Aristodemus, roared out (applause), for he had spoken in a manner worthy of himself and the god.
—Upon which Socrates, looking at Eryximachus, said, Do I appear to you, son of Acū­ mĕnus, to have felt just now a fear that was no fear,40 when I spoke prophetically, what I asserted lately, that Agatho would speak marvellously well, and that I should be placed in a diffi­ culty ?-One portion, replied Eryximachus, you appear to have foretold truly, that Agatho would speak excellently, but the other, that you would be in a difficulty, I do not consider (true).
And how, 0 happy man, said Socrates, am I not likely to be in a difficulty, and any one else too, who is to speak after a speech so full of beauty and variety?
41 In other respects it was not equally admirable,41 but who, that heard the conclusion, would not have been struck with the beauty 42 of the nouns and verbs ?42 For when I consider how unable I shall be to say any thing beautiful approaching.
to this, I should run away for very shame, had I in any way the power.
For the speech put me in mind of Gorgias :
so that I suffered what is told in Ho­ mer.43
For I feared that Agatho would at last send in his speech the head of that formidable speaker Gorgias against my speech ;
and, through my inability to say a word, turn me into stone!
And I perceived how ridiculous I was then, when I agreed that I would in my turn after you make an encomium upon Love, and asserted that I had some skill in the matter of Love, yet knowing nothing of it, nor how it was necessary to praise any thing whatever.
For in my stupidity I thought one ought to speak truths respecting each subject praised, and that these were to be the substratum, and that selecting out of these very matters the most beautiful, to put them to­ gether in the most becoming manner.
And I had a great notion that I should speak well, as knowing well the truths relating to the praising of any thing whatever.
But this it seems is not the way to praise correctly, but (we must) attri­ bute to the subject qualities the greatest and the best possible, whether they are such or not;
and if the encomiums are un­ true, that is an affair quite immaterial.
For it was stated before, as it seems, that each of us 44 should appear to praise Love, and not merely to praise.
44
On this account, I suppose, you 45 turn over every topic and attribute to Love,45 and assert that he is of such a kind, and the cause of things so great, as to appear the most beautiful and best-to those it is clear who know him not-for he certainly would not (appear so) to those who did know him.
And thus the praise becomes fine and pompous.
But for my part, I know nothing of this kind of praise ;
and through not knowing, I agreed to compose myself in my turn a panegyric. "
But my tongue only46 promised, not my mind."
And so farewell to it.
For I should not be able (to say any thing), not I indeed.47
But I am ready to speak the truth according to my own notions, if you are willing ( to hear), but not by way of comparison with yours, in order that I may not pay the debt of laughter.
Do you then, Phædrus, consider, if indeed you are in want at all of such a speech, 48(whether you wish)48 to hear the truth spoken about Love with such an arrangement of nouns and verbs49 as may happen to come (into my mind).50 [25.]
Phædrus then, he said, and the rest requested him to speak in the manner which he thought he ought to speak.
Permit me, Phædrus, however, said Socrates, to ask Agatho still some trifling questions;
that, 51 after having obtained a confession from him, I may then speak 51 in this way.
I permit you, said Phædrus.
Question him.
Hereupon he said, that Socrates began somewhat after this fashion:
In good truth, friend Agatho, you seem to me to have begun your speech well, in saying that we ought in the first place to set forth what is the nature of Love, and afterwards his doings.
With this introduction I am quite delighted.
Come, then, touching this Love;
since you have gone through the other points in a beautiful and splendid manner, tell me this also.
Is Love a being of such a kind as to be (the love) of something or nothing ?
I do not ask, whether it is of some father or mother;
-for the question, whether love is the love of a father or mother, would be ridiculous-but as if I had asked this re­ specting a father, Is a father a father ;
and the father of some­ thing, or not ?
In this case you would surely have said, if you wished to answer correctly, that a father is the father of a son or daughter, would you not ?-Certainly, said Agatho.—
And is not a mother in the same predicament ?-To this too Agatho assented.
-Answer me still further, said Socrates, to a question a little larger, that you may the better apprehend my meaning.
If I had asked, What, then, of a brother- whatever that very thing may be-is he a brother of some person, or not ?—(Agatho) said, He is.
—Is he not of a brother or a sister ?—Agatho assented.
—Try then, said (Socrates), to tell me about love.
Is it the love of nothing, or of something ?—
Of something,52 by all means, (replied Agatho).
—This, there­ fore,53 said Socrates, keep to yourself, remembering what it is ;
but tell me so much as this.
Does love desire that very thing, of which it is the love, or does it not ?-Desires it, cer­ tainly.
—Whether, when possessing what it desires and loves, does it then desire and love it ?
or only when not possessing it ?
-It would seem, he replied, only when not possessing it.- [26.]
Instead of seeming,54 said Socrates, consider if it be not of necessity thus, that desire desires only that, of which it is in want;
and that it does not desire, if it be from want.
For to me, Agatho, this seems to be marvellously necessary.
But how does it to you ?-
To me too it seems, replied (Agatho).—
You say well, said (Socrates).
Would then a big man, being big already, wish to be big ?
or a man being strong, wish to be strong ?
-This is, from what has been just now stated, impossible (replied Agatho).
For, being so,55 he would not be wanting on those points.
-You say true, replied Socrates ;
for, if a person, being already strong, should wish to be strong, and being swift, (wish to be) swift, and (being) healthy, (wish to be) healthy,57 one might perhaps imagine 58that those who are such, as regards these and such-like points, and possess these, would desire those things which they already possess.
58
That we may not therefore be deceived, it is for this that I speak.
For if you consider the matter, Agatho, (you will see) that they, who possess at present any of those things, must possess them, whether they will or not;
and of such a thing, how can any one ever have a desire?
But when a person says thus—“ I, who am now in health, desire to be in health;
and I, who am now wealthy, desire to be wealthy;
and I long for those very things, which I possess we should say to him thus:
" You mean, my man, that you, who now possess wealth, and health, and strength, are desirous to pos­ sess those things for the time to come;
since at the present time you possess them, whether you will or not."
When you say, therefore, thus—“ I desire what is present," consider whether you are saying any thing else than this—“ I wish that what are now present may be present for the time to come."
Would aught else but this be acknowledged ?
59—Agatho agreed that it would not.-Go Is not this then, said Socrates, to love (to desire)60 that which is not at hand to him, and which he does not pos­ sess ;
and that what are now present should be preserved for him for the time to come.
-Certainly so, (replied Agatho).—
Both this man, therefore, (said Socrates,) and every one else who feels a desire, desires that which lies not at hand, and which is not present, and which he has not, and which he himself is not, and of which he is in want of;
such things only are those of which there is the desire and the love.-
Certainly, said he.—61 Come then, said Socrates, let us agree upon what has been said.
61 Is Love any thing else than, in the first place, the love of something ?
next, of those things of which there is a want ?-Clearly (not), replied Agatho.—
In addition to these, said Socratcs, recollect, of what things you asserted in your speech there was a Love.
But, if you wish it, I will remind you.
For, I think, you said something like this—“ that their affairs were put into order by the gods, through a love of things beautiful:
for that of things ugly there could be no love."
Did you not say some such thing ?
I did say so, answered Agatho.
—And you spoke reason­ ably, friend, replied Socrates.
Now, if such be the case, would Love be any thing else than the love of beauty, and not of ugliness ?
-He confessed it.
-And has it not been confessed, said Socrates, that a person loves that thing of which he is in want, and which he does not possess ?
—Yes, said (Agatho).
—Love then, (said Socrates,) is in want of, and does not possess, beauty.
-It is so of necessity, said (Agatho).
-What then, (said Socrates,) do you call that beautiful, to which beauty is wanting, and does not possess it at all?- Certainly not, (replied Agatho).
—Do you then, said Socrates, still confess that Love is beautiful, if such be the case ?-And Agatho then said, I seem nearly, Socrates, to know nothing of what I then asserted.
-And you have, Agatho, spoken fairly, said Socrates.
But tell me still one little thing.
Do not things good seem to you to be also beautiful ?-
They do, (said Agatho).
—If then, (said Socrates,) Love is in want of things beautiful, and if good things are beautiful, Love will be in want of good things likewise.
—I am not able, re­ plied (Agatho), to argue against you, Socrates ;
let then the case be as you say.
—You are not able, my beloved Agatho, said Socrates, to argue against the truth:
for (to argue) against Socrates is by no means difficult. [27.]
And now here I will leave you.
But as regards the discourse about Love, which I heard for merly from Diotima of Manti­ nea,62 who was a clever person on these and many other points­ for when the Athenians were making sacrifices on account of the plague,63 she effected its being put off for ten years—she it was who instructed even me in Love affairs.
The speech then which she spoke I will endeavour to go through before you on the principles agreed upon by myself and Agatho, (relying) as well as I can, myself upon myself.
64
It is then, Agatho, very meet to declare, first, as you have stated, who Love is, and of what kind, and then his doings.
Now it seems to me a thing the most easy to go through the subject, as the stranger went through it, while sifting myself.
For I spoke to her in other words, but on nearly such points as Agatho just now did to me, (by saying) that Love was a god of goodness,65 and was also (one) of things beautiful.66
But she refuted me with the same arguments67 as I did this person (Agatho);
(by showing) that, according to my own reasoning, Love was neither beautiful nor good.
How say you, Diotima ?
said I.
Is Love an ugly and an evil being ?—
Will you not speak words of good omen ?
she replied;
or do you imagine that every thing which is not beautiful, must of necessity be ugly ?-Most certainly.
-And is every thing that is not wise, ignorant?
Or do you not perceive, there is some­ thing between wisdom and ignorance ?-What is that ?-To think correctly, and without being able to give a reason, know you not, said she, is neither to know-for how can knowledge exist without a reason ?
68—nor yet is it ignorance;
for how can that which hits the truth be ignorance ?69
There is then some such thing as correct opinion between intelli­ gence and ignorance.
70—You say truly, said I.
—Do not then compel what is not beautiful to be ugly;
or what is not good to be evil.
And thus, since you have confessed that Love is neither good nor beautiful, do not fancy a whit the more that he is ugly and evil;
but something, she said, between those two.
-However, said I, he is acknowledged by all to be a god of might.
-By all who do not know him, said she, or by those who do likewise ?-By all universally. [28.]
And she said with a smile, How, Socrates, can he be acknowledged a god of might by those, who say he is no god at all ?-
Who are they ?
said I.
—You yourself, replied she, are one, and I am one.
-How say you this ?
I replied.
71—Easily, said she.
For tell me.
Say you not that all the gods are blest and beauti­ ful ?
or would you dare assert that any one of the gods is not beautiful and blest ?-Not I, indeed, by Zeus, said I.
—Say you not that those who possess things good and beautiful are happy ?-Certainly.-
But you have confessed that, through the want of things good and beautiful, Love has a desire for those very things of which he is in want.
—I have confessed.
-But how can he be a god, who has no share in things beau­ tiful and good ?
-It seems, by no means.
—You see then, said she, that even you do not consider Love as a god.
—What then, said I, is Love a mortal?
—Least of all.
-What then?—
As in the case before mentioned, she replied, between a mortal and immortal.
-What is this, Diotima ?-A great dæmon,72 Socrates.
For the whole daemon-kind is between a god and mortal.
—What power has it, said I ?-It interprets for, and transmits to, the gods what is sent from men;
and for and to men what (is sent) from the gods;
from men, their petitions and sacrifices;
from the gods, their commands 74 and returns for sacrifices;
74 and being in the middle space be­ tween both (gods and men)75 it fills up the whole.
So that by it all have been bound together into one.
75
Through them proceeds every kind of prophecy, and the priestly art relating to sacrifices, and initiations and incantations, and the whole of magic76 and sorcery.
For a god is not mixed up with man ;
but through that (middle nature) is carried on all intercourse and converse between gods and men,77 whether awake or asleep.
Now he who is wise in things of tIns kind is a doe­ mon-like man;
but he who is wise in any other matter, whe­ ther arts or handicrafts, is an operative merely.
But these daemons are many and various, and one of them is Love.- [29. ]
But, said I, from what father or mother is he?
—It is a rather long story, said she, to tell.
However, I will relate it.
When Venus was born 78 the gods had a feast, all the rest, and likewise Plenty, the son of Planning.
And when they had supped, Poverty came 79 to be,-,,, as there was good cheer 79 there, and she staid about the door.
Just then Plenty, intoxi­ cated with nectar,-for as yet wine was not,-went into the garden of Zeus, and being drowsy with liquor, fell asleep.
Poverty therefore laid a plot against him, so as to have a child by Plenty, and placed herself down by him, and became pregnant with Love.
Hence Love has become the follower of and attendant upon Venus, as having been begotten on the birth-day of that deity, and being also naturally fond of the beautiful and of Aphrodite,80 as being beautiful.
As Love then is the son of Plenty and of Poverty, he is in this state of fortune.
In the first place, he is always poor;
and so far from being either tender or fair, as the multitude fancy, he is rough and dirty, and shoeless, and houseless, ever stretched on the bare ground, and bedless, and lying at doors, and in the road under the sky alone;
(and) as par­ taking of his mother's nature, dwelling ever with indigence.
On the other hand, taking after his father, he is a plotter against the beautiful and good;
courageous and bold, and on the stretch81 (to act);
a skilful hunter, for ever weav­ ing some contrivance;
82 eagerly desirous of intellect, and finding a way for himself ;
82 acting the philosopher 83 through the whole of life;
84 a clever sorcerer and a drug-employer, and sophist ;
84 and naturally neither an immortal nor a mortal;
but at one time in the same day 83 he blooms and lives, when he is faring well;
and at another time he dies ;
85 but revives again through his father’s nature.
Whatever is furnished to him, is ever secretly flowing out;
so that Love is never either in want or in wealth.
He is likewise in a middle place between wisdom and ignorance.
For the case is this :
-No god philosophizes, or desires to become wise;
for they are so;
and if there is any other being who is wise, neither does he philosophize.
Nor yet are the ignorant philosophers, nor do they desire to become wise.
For on this very account,87 Ignor- ance is in a hard case, in that a person,88 being neither beau­ tiful, nor good, nor wise, still appears to himself to be all- sufficient.
Hence he who fancies himself to be not wanting, does not desire that, of which he fancies he is not in want.
-Who then, Diotima, said I, are they who philosophize ?
if they are neither the wise nor the ignorant ?
-This, said she, is surely clear even to a child, that they are those between both of these;
of whom Love too (is one).89
For of the things most beautiful is wisdom.
Now Love is conversant with the beautiful.
So that it is of necessity for Love to be a lover of wisdom, and for a lover of wisdom to be between the wise and the ignorant.
And of this too the cause is in his birth ;
for he is from a father wise and in abundance, but from a mother unwise and in want. [30.]
Such, my dear Socrates, is the nature of this daemon.
But as to whom you fancied to be Love, you have suffered nothing to be wondered at.
For you fancied, as it seems to me, making a guess from what you are saying, that Love is the thing loved, and not the loving;
and hence, I think, Love appeared to you to be all-beautiful.
For the thing loved is in reality beautiful and delicate and perfect and blest.
But the thing loving possesses another na­ ture, and such as I have described.
-Be it so, stranger lady, said I;
for you have spoken well.
But if Love be of such a nature, of what advantage is he to mankind ?-
This, Socrates, said she, I will subsequently endeavour to teach you.
Love then is of such a nature, and has been so begotten;
and he is, as you assert, the love of things beautiful.
Now should any one ask us,
What is, 0 Socrates and Diotima, the Love of things beautiful ?-:
-but I will speak more clearly.
in this way—What does the lover of things beautiful long for?-
For them to be his, said I.
—This answer, said she, seeks still such a question as this.
What will there be to that man, who shall possess things beautiful ?-To this question I said, I had it not in my power to give an answer very ready at hand.-
But, said she, should a person making a change, and putting good in the place of beautiful, inquire of you (by saying), Come (tell me), Socrates, what does the lover of good things long for ?-For them to be his, I answered.
-And what will there be to a man, who shall possess good things ?
-This, said I, is more easy to answer:
that he will be happy.—(Right,) said she;
for by the possession of good things the happy are happy, nor is there any need to ask, Why does he, who wishes to be happy, wish so;
but the answer appears to be conclu­ sive.
—You say true, I replied.
-Now do you conceive, said she, that this wishing and this longing is common to all men, and that all wish for good things to be in their possession always;
or how say you ?
—I think in this way, said I;
that it is common to all.
—Why then, Socrates, said she, do we not say that all men are in love, if all love the same things, and always ?
but say (rather),90 that some are in love, and some are not?—I too91 am in a wonderment, said I.
—Do not wonder, said she;
92for after we have taken away a certain species of love, we call it love, adding the name of the whole;
but as regards the rest, we make an improper use of other names.
92—As how, for example ?
said I.—As this, said she.
You know that creation is a thing of extensive meaning.
For that which is the cause of any thing coming out of non-existence into existence, is altogether a creation.
So that all the oper­ ations effected by all the arts, are creations;
and all the workers of them are creators.
—You say true, said I.
—And yet you know, continued she, they are not called creators, but have other names;
but from all kinds of creation one portion has been separated, relating to the musical art and to metres ;
and is called by the name belonging to the whole.
'For it alone is called poesy (i. e. making) ;
93 and they, who possess this portion of the creative power, are poets (i. e. makers):
-
You say true, said I.—[31.]
Just so it is with Love, said she.
Universally all long after good things ;
and a state of good fortune is to every one a Love 94 the greatest and deceitful.
94
But some persons, turning themselves towards him 95 in many and various ways,95 either through money-making, or a love of gymnastic exercises, or of wisdom, are neither (said) to be in love nor are called lovers;
while others who 96go, and are seriously occupied,96 according to one kind of love, have the name of the whole, and love, and are (said) to be in love, and are called lovers.
—You are very near the truth, said I.—97
There is a story told, she said, that they who are in love are in search of their other half.
97
But my doctrine is, that a person loves neither the half nor the whole of any thing, unless it happens, my friend, to be somehow a good.
Since men are willing to have their feet and hands cut off, if their own limbs are deemed to be an evil.
98
For each person does not hug his own, I fancy, unless he calls good his own property,99 but evil the property of another:
since there is nothing else of which men are in love, but good alone.
How do they seem to you ?-By Zeus, said I, to me at least not (otherwise).
—May we not then say simply, she replied, that men love the good ?
—Yes, said I.
—What, said she, must we, not add that they desire the good to be present to them ?—
This, said I, must be added.
-And not only, she said, to be present, but to be present always ?
-This too must be added.-
There is then, to speak comprehensively, said she, the desire that the good should be present to a person for ever.
—You speak most truly, said I.—Since then, said she, there is the love of this, (the good,) of those who pursue it in any manner,100 and by any act, the eagerness and the stretch for it would be called love.
'But can you state what this act would happen to be?
1-I should not however2 have wondered, Diotima, said I, at your wisdom, nor have frequented (your school) to learn these very things, (had I been able to tell.)
—Well then, said she, I will tell you.
The act is of breeding upon a beautiful thing, as regards both the body and soul.
—What you are saying, I re­ plied, has need of divination.
For I do not understand.—I, will speak then, said she, more clearly.
All human beings, So­ crates, said she, yearn, as regards the body and soul;
and when they arrive at maturity our nature longs to beget.
But it is unable to beget upon an ugly thing, but only upon a beautiful one.
3
For the begetting is through the connexion of a man and woman.
3
But this is a god-like act, and this 4 [the yearning and generation] 4 is in a mortal animal an immortal act.
But these it is impossible to take place in a thing unsuitable.
Now what is ugly is ill-suited to every thing that is divine ?
But what is beautiful is suited.
5 For Beauty is Fate and Eileithuia, who presides over child-birth.
5
Hence when what is yearning comes close to what is beautiful, it becomes joyous, and being de­ lighted it pours itself out and 6breeds and begets.
6
But when it ( comes close) to what is ugly, it assumes a sour look, and is vexed 7 and coils itself up, and turns away, and unrolls itself and does not beget, but restraining the swelling, it takes the matter grievously to heart.
Hence to the party yearning and swelling with desire, there is an excessive fluttering of mind respecting the beautiful;
on account of its being able to de­ liver him who has8 it from his great agony.
But, Socratcs, said she, this is not, as you fancied, the love of the beautiful.-
Of 9 what then is it ?
said I.
—It is the love, replied she, of ge­ neration land of begetting] 10 in a beautiful thing.
-Be it so, said I.
—By all means, she replied.
-But why, said I, of gener­ ation?-11 Because generation is a thing ever producing, and immortal, as far as it can be for a mortal.
12 Now from what has been agreed upon it is necessary to desire immortality with a good, if there is to Love the desire of the good being ever present to himself.
It is necessary then from this reasoning, that there is a love likewise of immortality.12[32.]
All this did Diotima teach me, when she was dis­ coursing upon love matters.
And once upon a time she asked me, What do you imagine, Socrates, to be the cause of that love and desire ?
Do you not perceive how vehemently all brute animals are affected, when they feel such a desire to breed, both beasts and birds ?
13how they are all sick and lov­ ingly disposed,13 in the first place, to have a connexion with each other;
and afterwards to rear their offspring;
and how ready in their behalf the weakest are to fight against the strongest, and to die for them, and though they are themselves pining away with hunger, 14 they do not faint in doing every thing, so as to bring them up.
14 Human beings indeed, she said, one might fancy, acted thus from reflection, but what reason is there for wild animals to be so lovingly disposed.
Can you state ?-And I said again that I did not know.
-And do you think, said she, ever to become a person of power in questions of love, if you do not understand this ?-It is for this very reason, said I, Diotima, as I just now stated, that I come to you, being well aware that I have need of teachers.
Do you then tell me the cause both of this and of all the rest relating to questions of love.-
If you believe then, said she, that there is naturally the love of that, which we have often con­ fessed, do not wonder.
For here, on the same ground as that, the mortal nature seeks as far as possible to be ever and immortal.
15
Now this it effects only by generation;
when it leaves another new thing in the place of the old;
since at the time when each individual animal 16 is said to live, and to be the same;
16 as for instance, a person is called the same from childhood, until he becomes an old man;
and though he never possesses the same things in himself, he is nevertheless called the same person, 17 being perpetually altered, (by obtaining some new things,) and losing (the old),17 as regards the hair and flesh, and bones and blood, and the whole body.
And not only as regards the body, but the soul likewise;
his manners, morals, opinions, de­ sires, pleasures, pains, fears, all these never remain the same to any man;
but some are produced, and some destroyed.
And there is something still more strange than this;
since not only are some sciences produced, and some lost by us, but we are never the same, not even as regards sciences in general;
but each single science suffers in a similar way.
For what we call to practise oneself is to act, as if a science were about to depart;
and indeed oblivion is the departure of science;
but practice, introducing again a fresh remembrance in the place of the departing one, preserves the science, so that it seems to be the same.
In this manner every thing mortal is preserved, not by its being in every respect the same for ever, as the deity is;
but by the thing that is departing and grow­ ing old, leaving another new thing, such as it was itself
By this contrivance, Socrates, said she, that which is mortal par­ takes of immortality, both body and all other things.
IS
But that which is immortal in another way.
IS
Do not then wonder that every thing 19 honours its own offspring.
For this earnest attention and love follows20 every thing for the sake of immortality.—[33.] 21 And I on hearing the discourse was amazed and said,21 Be this so, said I,22 thou most wise Dio­ tima;
since such is truly the case.
And she, like the perfect 23 sophists, replied, Rest assured,24 Socrates.
Since, if you are willing to turn your eyes-to the love of glory in mankind, you would wonder at your want of reason touching the points on which I have spoken, unless you bear in mind and consider how terribly they are affected25 with the desire to become renowned,26 And fame undying to lay up for ever.
-And for this they are ready to run the risk of all kinds of danger, even still more than for their children, and to ex­ pend their substance, and undergo labours of whatsoever kind, and for it to die.
Since do you fancy, said she, that Alcestis would have died for Admetus, or Achilles27 have died over the body of Patroclus, or your countryman Codrus to pre­ serve the kingdom for his children,28 29had they not thought that of their virtuous deeds the remembrance would never- dying live, as it actually does for ever, which we cherish to this day ?29-30Far from it, said I.
But I think, that in be­ half of undying virtue, and of a reputation glorious31 as this, all men perform all deeds, and so much the more, as they are the more excellent.30
For they have a yearning for immor­ tality.
—They then, said she, who have a yearning according to the body, turn themselves rather to women, and are in this way given to love affairs;
and by child-getting procure for themselves, as they fancy, immortality and a remembrance and happiness for the time to come.
32 33
But they (who have a yearning) according to the soul-Are there then, said I, they who yearn in their souls ?-Still more (said she) than in their bodies;
for which it is fitting for the soul to yearn and to bring forth.
What fitting (offspring) is this?
In­ tellect and every other excellence.33
Of which all poets are the generators, and such handy-craftsmen as are said to be in­ ventive.
But the greatest and most beautiful part of intellect is that, which is conversant in the well-ordering of cities and private dwellings, to which is given the name of temperance and justice.
With these when any one is teeming 34from his youth, as being divine in his soul, and when he has arrived at a mature age,34 he longs already 35to beget and breed;
35 36 and he seeks, I think, even he,36 going about, for the beau­ tiful thing, upon which he may generate:
for he never will generate on what is ugly;
and thus yearning, he takes to his arms handsome bodies rather than the ugly;
but if he meets with a soul beautiful and noble, and finely moulded, he ardent­ ly embraces both united;
and to such a person he immediately discourses copiously on virtue, and what a virtuous man ought to be, and what pursuits he should follow;
and he endeavours himself to act the teacher;
for laying hold, I think,37 of a beautiful thing, and associating with it, he breeds and begets that, with which he has been yearning of old, and has both present and absent borne in recollection;
and in common with the other party, he brings up what has been produced;
so that such persons have a communion of feeling towards each other much greater than what arises from (other)38 chil­ dren, and a friendship more firm;
inasmuch as they have a joint interest in children more lovely and more immortal.
39
Now every one would choose that such children should be born to him rather than those of a human kind.
And turn­ in- his thoughts to Homer, Hesiod, and the rest of the excel­ lent poets, he would envy40 them for having left such an issue of their own, as to obtain for them an undying glory and re­ membrance.
Or, if you prefer it, said she, (see) what chil­ dren Lycurgus left behind him at Lacedæmon, the saviours of their country,41 and, so to say, of the whole 42 of Greece.
Amongst yourselves, too, how honoured is Solon, for his be­ getting the laws!
and there are many43 other men elsewhere and in many places amongst both the Greeks and Barbarians, who have shown forth many and noble deeds, and begotten every kind of virtue.
And to them many holy rites44 have been paid on account of such their progeny;
but never to any man on account of his human offspring. [34.]
In such mysteries relating to Love even you, Socrates, would perhaps be initiated.45
But the consummation,46 on account of which the looking-on itself exists, if a person follows the rites cor­ rectly, 47 I know well you would not complete.
47
However, said she, I will tell you, and not be wanting in a readiness (to instruct you).
But do you endeavour to follow me, as long as you are able.
He then, said she, who would rightly arrive at this consummation, must begin when young to direct his steps to forms that are beautiful.
And if, in the first place, his leader conducts him rightly, he must feel a love for one of them, and there beget conversations full of beauty.
In the next place, he must have a due perception that the beauty, which exists in any form whatever, is the brother to that which is in a different form.
And if he must pursue48 the beauty, which is in a species, 49 there would be a great want of understanding 49 not to consider the beauty found in all bodies as one and the same.
50 And he, who thus considers, must 50 become a lover of all beautiful forms, 51 and relax the violence (of his love) for a -single form, and despise it, and hold it of no moment ;
51 and afterwards consider of greater value the beauty existing in the soul, than that existing in the body;
so that, if there be a person only reasonably beautiful52 in soul, 53and if he bears only a small flower,53 he should be satisfied to feel a love, and to tend with care, and to give birth to conversations of this kind, full of beauty, and to seek such as will make the young better, in order that he may, on the other hand,54 be compelled to behold the beauty existing in the employments of life,55 and the regulations of laws, and to see this, that all this has an affinity with itself, in order56 that he may consider as of little value the beauty that is around the body;
and after these (liberal) employments to lead him to sciences58 in order that he may see again the loveliness of science;
and looking upon beauty as being now manifold, he may no longer be the slave of that which exists in one form- 59 as a domestic is contentedly in love with the beauty of a little child, or of a man, or one employment59—and become a person of no mark, and of contracted notions;
but turning himself to the wide sea of beauty, and contemplating the many and beautiful and magnificent discourses, he may 60(there) give birth to conceptions in unstinting61 philoso­ phy, until being there (in philosophy) strengthened and in­ creased,62 he shall behold some single science of such a kind that it.
is conversant with so great and beautiful a thing.62 [35.]
But now try, said she, to give me all the attention you can.
Whoever then has been instructed thus far in the mysteries of Love, and has beheld in due order and correctly the things of beauty, he will, when he arrives at the consummation of the things of Love, see on a sudden some wondrous sight of na­ tural beauty, for the sake of which all his previous labours have been undertaken.
For in the first place, it exists for ever, being neither produced nor destroyed, and neither suffer­ ing increase nor decay.
In the next place, it is not beautiful only on this side, but ugly on that;
nor only at one time, but not so at another;
nor as regards one point beautiful, but as re­ gards another ugly;
nor as being beautiful in the eyes of some, but ugly in the eyes of others;
nor will its beauty be a mere out­ ward appearance, as if it were a face, or hands, or any thing else in which the body participates;
nor is it any discourse or science;
nor does it exist in any other being, such as an animal;
nor in the earth, nor in the heavens, nor 63 in any other part of the universe;
63 but it subsists by and with it­ self, and possesses a form eternally one;
while all the other things are beautiful through their participating in this, in some such manner, that whereas the rest are produced and destroyed, it becomes neither greater in aught, nor less, nor is exposed to any state of suffering.
And when ascending from these, through rightly loving the young, he begins to have a view of the beautiful, he will have nearly arrived at the consummation.
Now this is to march (by oneself)64 correctly to the affairs of Love, or to be led by another;
beginning from the things of beauty, to keep ascending, for the sake of the beautiful itself, by making use as it were of steps, from one beautiful object to two, and from two to all;
and from the beauty of bodies 65 (to the beauty of soul;
and from the beauty of soul) 65 to that of pursuits;
from the beauty of pursuits to that of doctrines;
until he arrives at length from the beauty of doctrines (generally), to that single one relating to nothing else than beauty in the abstract, 66 land he knows at last what is the beautiful itself.]
66 In this state of life, if any where, dear Socrates, said the stranger-prophetess,67 should a person live, contemplating beauty in the abstract;
which should he behold, it will appear to be not in a bit of gold, nor in dress, nor in beautiful boys or youths;
with the sight of which you are struck, and are ready both yourself and many others, if it were possible, to look upon your beloved and live with them for ever, and to neither eat nor drink, but 68 to feast yourselves with the view,68 and to be together.
69
What think you then, said she, would take place, if it were in the power of any person to behold beauty itself, clear as the light, pure and unmixed, but70 not polluted with human flesh and colour, and much of other kinds of mortal trash;
but be able to view the godlike71 beautiful in its singleness of form ?
Think you, said she, that the life of a man would be of little account who looks thither, and beholds it with what he ought,72 and is in its company ?
Perceive you not, said she, that there alone will it be in the power of him, who looks upon the beautiful with the eye by which it can be seen, to be­ get not the shadowy show of virtue-as not coming in contact with shadowy shows-but virtue in reality, as coming in con­ tact with a reality;
and that to a person, begetting virtue in real­ ity and bringing her up, it will happen for him to become god­ beloved, and, if ever man was, immortal.—[36.]
Thus, (friend) Phædrus and ye the rest here, spoke Diotima, and I am my­ self convinced, and being convinced, I am endeavouring to convince the rest, that no one would readily find a better assistant to human nature for the attainment of such a pos­ session than Love.
And hence I assert, that every man ought to hold Love in honour;
and I do myself pay all honours to the things of Love, and cultivate them particularly, and I exhort others likewise;
and both now and ever I cele­ brate, as far as I can, the power and the excellence of Love.73 —
Consider then, Phædrus, this speech as having been spoken in praise of Love, if you are so inclined;
but if not, giving it any other name, and taking it in any other sense, so call it.74[37.]
When Socrates had thus spoken, the rest praised the speech;
but Aristophanes endeavoured to say something, because Socrates had, when speaking, alluded75 to his speech.
On a sudden, however, the door of the porch was knocked at and it sent within a loud noise, so that there was heard the voice of revellers, and of a pipe-playing damsel.
Upon this Agatho said to the servants, Will you not see to the matter ?
and if there is any acquaintance, invite him in;
but if not, say that we are no longer drinking, and have already left off.
Not long afterwards, the voice of Alcibiades, who was very drunk, was heard in the court, bawling very loud, and ask­ ing—Where is Agatho ?
and ordering ( a slave) to lead him to Agatho.
The flute-player, therefore, and some others of his fol­ lowers, supported him towards Agatho, and he stood at the door crowned with a garland of ivy and violets, and having very many fillets on his head, and exclaiming, All hail, my friends !
Either receive as a fellow-tippler a man very drunk, or let us depart, after crowning Agatho alone, for which purpose we have come.
For I was not able, said he, to come yesterday;
but I am here now with fillets on my head, that, from my own, I may bind them on the head of the wisest76 and the most beautiful person.
77If I should say so, will you laugh77 at me, as being drunk ?
However, although you may laugh, I well know that I am speaking the truth.
But tell me imme­ diately, shall I come in or not on these conditions ?
Will you drink with me or not ?
Thereupon all the company was in an uproar, and ordered him to enter and recline on a couch, and Agatho too invited him.
And he (Alcibiades) came, led by his attendants;
and at the same time taking off the fillets, as if about to bind them (on Agatho), he did not see Socrates, who was before his eyes, but sate down by Agatho, and be­ tween him and Socrates:
for Socrates had made way for him that he might sit down;
and sitting down he embraced Agatho, and bound the fillet on him.
Thereupon said Agatho, Slaves, unloose the sandals of Alcibiades, that he may recline as the third among us.
By all means, said Alcibiades;
78 but, who is this third person our fellow-drinker ?
and at the same time turn­ in- round, he beheld Socrates;
and on seeing him, he started up, and exclaimed, 0 Hercules!
what is this ?
What ho Socrates ?
are you again sitting here in ambush against me, just as you are wont to do, and to appear suddenly, where I least expected you would be.
And why are you reclining here?
and79 not with Aristophanes, or any other person who is, and wishes to be a source of merriment?
But you have contrived to sit near the most beautiful of those within.80
Then said Socrates, See, Agatho, if you can assist me;
for the love of this man here is to me no trifling matter;
since from the time when I fell in love with him, I am no longer permitted either to look at, or speak to, any beautiful person;
or81 he is, through jealousy and envy, practising strange de­ vices, and abuses me, and scarcely keeps off his hands ?
See therefore that he does not do something now, but do you re­ concile us;
or, should he attempt to do any violence, do you assist me:
for I greatly fear the madness of this man, and his strong feeling of love.
-But, said Alcibiades, there shall be82 no reconciliation between you and me.
For I will by and by revenge myself upon you for this.
But for the pre­ sent, Agatho, said he, give me some of the fillets, that I may bind them on the wonderful head of this man, and he may not find fault with me, because I have bound the fillets on you, but not on him, who vanquishes all men in discourse, not only lately as you have done, but at all times, upon all subjects.
83
And at the same time, taking some of the fillets, he bound them upon Socrates, and laid himself down.
When he had laid himself down, he said, [38.]
84Let things be;
for you appear to me to be sober;
this you must not be allowed, but you must drink ;
84 for so it has been agreed.
I therefore elect myself the chairman85 until you have drunk enough.
But, Agatho, let some one bring a beaker, if there is a large one;
or rather, there is no need;
but bring hither, boy, said he, that wine cooler, which seems86 to hold more than eight kotylæ.
87 Having filled it, he first drank it off himself;
and afterwards ordered them to pour out of it for Socrates, and stated at the same time, This stratagem of mine, gentlemen, is of no avail against Socrates;
for, let him drink as much as any one may command, he will not be a bit the more intoxi­ cated.
88 Socrates then, when the boy had poured out the wine, drank it off.
And Eryximachus.
said,
What shall we do, Alcibiades ?
Shall we neither say nor sing over the cup, but drink really like those who are thirsty ?
To this Alci­ biades replied, Hail, Eryximachus !
thou best of men, sprung from the best and most temperate of fathers.
And hail89 thou too, said Eryximachus.
But what shall we do ?
Whatever you may order;
for you we must obey.
For A man of physic has 'gainst many others A worthyOrder then what you will.
Hear then, said Eryximachus.
Before you came in, it was determined that every one, beginning at the right hand, should in turn make a speech in praise of Love, to the best of his ability.
All the rest of us, therefore, have spoken ;
and it is just, since you have not spoken, but have been drinking, that you too should make a speech;
and, when you have spoken, order Socrates to do whatever you please, and he too order the person on his right hand, and so with respect to the rest.
Aleibiades then said, You say well, Eryximachus;
but it is not fair91 to compare a drunken man against a sober one in their speeches.
But, 0 happy man, does Socrates persuade you with respect to what he has just now said ?
Or do you know that every thing is the contrary to what he has said ?
For he it is, who, when I in his presence praise any one, ex­ cept himself, whether god or man, will not keep his hands from me.
Will you not speak fair words?92 said Socrates.
By Neptune, said Alcibiades, say nothing against this ;
for I will praise no other person, while you are present.
Do so then, said Eryximachus;
if you will, praise Socrates.
How say you ?
rejoined Aleibiades.
Does it seem good to you, Eryx­ imaehus, that I'should do so?
Must I fall upon 93 this man, and revenge myself before you ?
Ho, sir, said Socrates, what have you in mind ?
Will you praise me so as to make me ridieulous ?94 or what will you do ?
I will speak the truth.
But see whether you will permit me.
Nay, said Socrates, I both permit, and command you to speak the truth.
95 I will do it instantly, said Aleibiades.
But however do you act thus ;
95 if I assert any thing not true, lay hold of me while speaking if you will, and say that I am telling a falsehood;
for I shall not will­ ingly tell a lie.
And do not wonder if I speak as if recollecting one thing after another;
for it is not easy for a man in my state to enumerate readily, and in succession, your strange be­ haviour. [39.]
I will then endeavour, gentlemen, to praise Socrates in this way by means of images.
He indeed will per­ haps imagine that I am turning him into ridicule;
but the image will be for the sake of what is true, and not ridiculous.
I say, then, that Socrates is most like the figures of Silenus that are seated in the workshops of statuaries, which the artists have made, holding reeds or flutes;
but which, when they are opened down the middle, appear to contain within them statues of the gods.
And I again say, that he resembles the satyr Marsyas.97
Now that in your outward form, Socrates, you resemble these things, even you yourself will not deny;
but that you resemble them likewise in other points, hear in the next place.
You are saucy in deeds;
or are you not?
For, if you do not acknowledge it, I will bring witnesses to the fact.
Are you not also a piper much more wonderful than Marsyas ?
For98 he charmed men through instruments, by a power proceeding from the mouth;
and he (charms)99 even now, when any one plays his melodies.
For what Olympus 100 played, I call the melodies of Marsyas, who taught him.
Now his melodies, whether a good male flute-player plays them, or a bad female one, alone1 cause a person to be spell-bound, and point out, through their being divine, those that stand in need 2 of the gods and the mysteries;
but you in this respect alone differ from him, that you effect the very same thing by naked words without instruments.
We therefore, when we hear another person, although a good speaker himself, pronouncing the speeches of others, not a single hearer, so to say, pays any regard to them;
but when any one hears you, or your discourses spoken by another, although he is a wretched speaker, yet, whether a woman or a man or a lad is the auditor, we are astonished and spell-bound.
I therefore, gen­ tlemen, unless I seemed to be very much in liquor, would tell you upon oath what I have suffered by the discourses of this man, and am suffering even now.
For when I hear him, my heart leaps much more than that of the Corybantes;
3 and my tears flow forth through his discourses.
I see too many others suffering in the very same way.
But when I hear Pericles, and other excellent orators, I think indeed that they speak well, but I suffer nothing of this kind;
nor is my soul agitated with tumult, nor is it indignant, as if I were in a servile state.
But by this Marsyas here I am often so affected, that it appears to me I ought not to live, while I am in such a state.
You will not, Socrates, say that this is not true.
And even now I feel conscious that, were I willing to lend him my ears, I could not bear it, but should suffer in the very same way.
For lie would compel4 me to confess, that, being yet very deficient, I neglect my own affairs,5 but attend to those of the Athenians.
6 7By violence therefore restraining my­ self as to my ears,7 I depart from him, flying, as it were, from the Syrens, lest I should sit there by him until I grew old.
And towards him alone of all men, I suffer that, which no one would think to be in me, to be ashamed of any one.
8 [But I am abashed before him alone.]
8 For I feel conscious of my inability to deny that what he exhorts me to do ought not to be done;
but when I 'depart from him, I am (eonscious) of being overcome by the honour (I receive) from the multitude.
I therefore run away from and avoid him ;
and when I see him, I am ashamed for what I had consented to do.
And often, indeed, I would gladly see him no longer amongst men:
and yet again, if this should happen, I well know I should be afflicted still more;
so that I know not what to do with this man.
And from the melodies indeed of this Satyr in such a manner both I and many others have suffered.[40.]
Hear too from me on other points, how like he is to what I have compared him, and what a wonderful power he possesses.
For be well assured, that not one of you knows him;
but I will lay him open, since I have begun (to speak.) 9
You see then that he is 10 disposed in a very ama­ tory manner towards beautiful persons;
10 and that he is al­ ways about them and struck with them;
but on the other hand, 11 he is ignorant of every thing and knows nothing how his figure is.
Is not this Silenus-like ?11 For he is invested with this externally like a carved Silenus;
but when he is opened inwardly, with temperance how great, think you, fellow­ tipplers, is he filled ?
Know too, that if any person is beautiful, he regards him not, but despises him to such an extent as no one would suppose;
nor if he is wealthy, or possesses any other honour amongst those who are considered by the multitude as blessed ;
but he holds all these possessions to be nothing worth, and that we too are of no account.
12
He passes likewise the whole of life indulging in irony and jests against mankind ;
but when he is serious and is opened, I know not whether any one (of you) 13 has seen the images within;
but I once saw them, and they appeared to me to be so divine and golden, and all- beautiful and wonderful, that I (thought) 14 I must in a short time do whatever Socrates ordained.
Conceiving too that he paid great attention to my beauty, I considered this as a god-send, and a piece of wondrous good fortune for myself since by gratifying Socrates it would be in my power to hear from him all that he knew.
For I prided myself on my beauty marvellously.
With these thoughts in my head, al­ though I had previously been never accustomed to be in his company without an attendant, on that occasion I sent the page away and remained with him alone;
for I must state the whole truth, and do you give me your attention;
and if I am telling a falsehood, do you, Socrates, confute me.
I was, gentlemen, alone with him alone;
and I thought he would immediately converse with me in the way that lovers are wont to speak to their beloved in private ;
and15 I was (highly) delighted (with the expectation).15
Nothing however of this kind very much16 took place ;
but after conversing somewhat17 and passing the day with me as usual, he went away.
Then I challenged him to contend with me in the naked exercises, and I did contend as if about to effect something by this means.
He engaged therefore naked, and had a tussel fre­ quently against me, no one being present.
But why need I mention this ?
Nothing more took place.
But when I ac­ complished nothing at all by this means, I determined to attack the man with all my might, nor to let him off;
18since I had put my hand to the task.
IS
But you must now 19know what is the affair.
19 Accordingly I invited him to supper, artlessly20 laying a plot as a lover does against his beloved.
Even to this he did not quickly give ear.
In time, however, he was over-persuaded.
But when he came for the first time, he wished, as soon as he had supped, to go away;
and I, feeling ashamed, let him go.
Having laid however again a plot, after supper I had a conversation with him far into the night;
and when he wished to go away, I pretended it was late, and I compelled him to stay.
He reposed, there­ fore, in a couch close to mine, and on which he had supped;
and no other person besides us slept in the house. [41.]
Thus far in my story it would be well to state to any one;
but what is to come, you would not have heard me telling, unless, in the first place, according to the proverb,21 Wine, with children, or without, Does a tale of truth let out;
and in the second place, it seems to me to be unjust in him who comes to praise a person, to leave in obscurity a proud deed of Socrates.
Moreover, the suffering of him, who has been bitten by a viper, possesses likewise myself.
For they say that the per­ son so suffering is unwilling to tell what it is, except to those who have been bitten, as being alone about to know and to pardon him, should he dare to do and say every thing from excess of pain.
221 say it then, having been bitten by something still more painful.
For it is the most painful of all, by which a'person can be bitten, in heart or soul, or whatever else it is meet to call it, [bitten and wounded,] namely, by discourses in philosophy;
which are wont to give out something more acute than that from the viper, when they (the discourses) lay hold of a young person with a not badly-disposed soul, and cause him to do and say any thing whatever22.
And looking, moreover, at the Phædruses, Agathos, Eryximachuses, Pausaniase3, Aris­ todemuses, Aristophaneses.—23 But why need I say, Socrates himself, and whoever forms the rest (of the company ).23
For all of you have partaken with me of the madness and Bacchic fury of philosophy;
and on this account you shall all hear.
For you will pardon what was done then, and is said now.
But let the domestics, and if there is any other profane and rude person present, place upon their ears24 gates of very great size.
25
When therefore the lamp was extinguished, and the servants had gone out, it seemed to me that I ought not to employ words of many meanings towards him, but tell him freely what was in my thoughts.
And nudging him I said, Socrates, are you asleep ?
Not yet, he replied.
Do you know then on what I am determined?
What is it particularly?
said he.
You seem to me, said I, the only lover worthy of myself;
and yet you appear to feel a dread to have a recollec­ tion 26 towards me.
But, as I am thus affected, I think it very silly for me not to gratify you both in this point, and in any thing else of which you may be in want, whether it be my own property, or that of my friends:
for nothing is to me of greater moment than to become the best of men :
and for this I think there is no person a more competent assister than yourself;
and I should feel a much greater shame before the wise, in not gratifying such a man, than before the 27 [many and the] 27 unwise by gratifying him.
Socrates, having heard me, said, very ironically, and very much after his usual man­ ner, My dear Alcibiades, you seem to be in reality a man of no common mark, if what you say concerning me happens to be true, and there is in me a certain power, through which you can become better.
But what boundless beauty could you see in me, and vastly superior to the fine form in yourself, if, on beholding it, you endeavour to have dealings28 with me, and to exchange beauty for beauty.
You have surely an idea of possessing more than I do;
for you endeavour to obtain the truth of beautiful things instead of the reputation, and you conceive that you will in reality exchange brass for gold.29
But, 0 blessed man, think better of it, nor let me lie hid from you, as being nothing.
The power of intellectual vision be­ gins then to see acutely, when that of the eye loses its acmé.30
You however are still far off from this.
And I, having heard him, replied, As regards myself the facts are so;
of which not one has been stated otherwise than as I conceive myself.
But do you counsel me in what you may consider to be best both for you and me.
In this, said he, you say well:
for in the time to come let us consult together, and we will do what ap­ pears to be the best for us, both with respect to these and other matters. [42.]
Having thus heard and 31 spoken, and sent as it were arrows,31 I thought that he was wounded;
and I rose up, and not suffering him to speak any more, I wrapped myself round with this garment, (for it was winter,) and lying down under the old cloak of this man, I threw my arms around the truly divine and wonderful man, and lay there the whole night.
And in this again, Socrates, you will not say that I am telling a falsehood.
But though I acted in this manner, yet he was victorious, and despised, and jeered at, and even insulted my beauty.
And yet I fancied it was some­ thing, men and judges, for judges you are, of the haughtiness of Socrates.
For by the gods and goddesses, rest assured that I rose from Socrates no otherwise than if I had slept with my father, or my elder brother.
32
What feelings then do you fancy I had after this,32 on reflecting that I had been dishonoured, but yet admiring the nature, and the temperance and fortitude of this man, after I had met with a person such as I never thought I should meet with for prudence and self-control;
so that I neither had it in my power to be angry with him, nor though I was deprived of intercourse with him, had I any means of attach­ ing him to myself.
For I well knew that he would be on every side more invulnerable to money, than Ajax33 was to the sword;
and that he had escaped me, at the very time when I fancied he would be caught.
And thus I was reduced to my wits' ends, and went about, the slave of this man, as no one else was of any other.
For not only did all this occur to me formerly, but after this likewise, during a campaign common to both of us, took place against Potidæa, and there we messed together.
And here, in the first place, he not only surpassed myself, but all others, in the labours of the field.
But when we were left some where, and compelled, as happens in campaigns, to be greatly34 without food, the rest were nothing to him for the power of endurance.
On the other hand, at our jollifications, he was the only person who could enjoy them;
for though he was generally unwilling to drink, yet when forced to do so, he beat all the rest;
and what is the most wonderful of all, no one ever saw Socrates intoxicated.
But of this it appears to me there will be shortly a confutation.
Again, with respect to his endurance in winter, for the winters there are very severe,36 he performed wonders in other ways, and once also when the frost was most bitter, and all did not go out from their quarters, or if any did so, he clothed himself in wonderfully thick (cloaks),37 had his feet bound and wrapped in felt and sheep-skins, Socrates went out amongst them, wearing just the same clothing as he had been previously accustomed to wear, and marched through the ice without shoes, more easily than others with shoes;
and the soldiers had a suspicion that he held them in con­ tempt. [43.]
And thus much on these points.
"But what this patient man did do and dare,"38 during the campaign there, it is worth while to hear.
For while he was thinking of some question from himself he stood from the dawn investigating it;
and, as he did not succeed, he did not desist, but stood still investigating it.
It was mid-day, and some persons perceived him, and wondering said, one to the other, that Socrates had been standing from the morning think­ ing upon something.
At length some Ionian soldiers, when it was evening, having supped-for it was then summer­ brought out their ground-litters, and partly slept in the cold and partly kept watch, whether he would stand there all night.
And he did stand until the dawn appeared and the sun rose;
after which he departed, having first offered a prayer to the sun.40
And if you are willing (to hear), 41 what he was in battle, must not be passed by.
41
For it is surely just to pay him this tribute.
For when the battle took place, in which the generals assigned to myself the prize of superior good conduct, no other man rescued me but he, through his being unwilling to leave me when wounded;
and he preserved both my arms and myself.
And I indeed at that time urged the commanders to give you, Socrates, the prize of good conduct­ and for stating this, you will neither blame me, nor say that I am speaking falsely-but the generals, looking to my rank in life, and wishing to give me those rewards, you were more eager for me to receive them than for yourself.
Further still, gentlemen, it was well worth while to see Socrates when our army retreated from Delium ;
42 for I happened to be present with the cavalry, but Socrates was among the heavy-armed.
For when the troops were already scattered, both he and Laches retreated;
and I, meeting with and seeing the two, immediately exhorted them to take courage, and said that I would not abandon them.
Here then I had a better view of Socrates than at Potidæa;
for I was in less fear, because I was on horseback.
In the first place then, how greatly did he surpass Laches in his being cautious;
and in the next place, he seemed, according to your description, Aristophanes, to carry himself loftily,43 and to throw his eye on one side, to survey quietly both friends and foes ;
and it was manifest to every one, and even to a person at a distance, that whoever presumed to touch this man, would be very vigorously re­ pulsed.
Hence both he and the other departed in safety;
for scarcely any one, who thus conducts himself in war, is touched ;
but the pursuit is of those who turn and run away. [44.]
44 There are many other things for which a person would have it in his power to praise Socrates wondrously.
But of his other pursuits, some one may perhaps speak in this way even about another person;
44 but to be like not one, either of the ancients or moderns, this is a thing worthy of all wonder.
For such as Achilles was, one might conjecture was Brasidas45 and others:
and again, that, such as Pericles was, were An- tenor and Nestor.
And there are others likewise;
and the rest46 a person might compare after the same manner.
But such a strange character as is this man, both in himself and in his discourses, no one will by searching discover any man approaching near to him, either among those living now or in the olden time ;
unless indeed some one should compare him to no human being, but to what I have mentioned, Silenuses and Satyrs.
For I omitted to state this at first, that his dis­ courses too are.
very like the Silenuses when opened.
For should any one be willing to hear the discourses of Socrates, they will appear to be 47 very ridiculous at first ;
47 with such nouns and verbs do they envelop externally, 48 as it were, the hide of a Satyr.48
For he speaks of panniered asses,49 and of copper-smiths, and leather-cutters, and tanners, and he ap­ pears to be always saying the same things upon the same subjects ;
50 so that every man who has neither skill nor sense will laugh at his words.
But he who beholds his discourses when opened, and gets within them, will, in the first place, find that they alone of (all other) 51 discourses possess an in­ ternal meaning ;
and, in the next place, that they are most divine, and hold the most numerous82 images of virtue, and extend to the farthest point, or rather to every thing, which it is fitting for him to consider, who intends to become a man at once beautiful and good.
These then are the reasons, gentlemen, for which I praise Socrates;
but on the other hand, for what I blame him, I have mixed up in the recital of the insults he has heaped upon me.
Nor has he acted in this manner towards me alone, but.
also towards Charmides, the son of Glauco, Euthydemus, the son of Diodes, and very many others;
whom this man has deceived, as if he were their lover, when, instead of the loving, he is himself the beloved.
Hence,53 I caution you, Agatho, not to be deceived by this man;
but, taught by my sufferings, to have a care, and not, according to the proverb, By suffering, like a silly person, knowledge gain.
54When Alcibiades had thus spoken, there was a (general)55 laugh at his freedom of speech, because he appeared to be lovingly disposed towards Socrates;
who thereupon observed, You seem to me, Alcibiades, to be sober ;
for, otherwise, you would not have attempted in so elegant and circuitous a man­ ner to conceal that, for the sake of which you have said all this;
and, as if mentioning something of no consequence, you have cleverly placed at the end that you have said all this on this account, namely, to throw discord56 between me and Agatho, conceiving that I ought to love you and no other person, and that Agatho ought to be loved by you, and by no one else.
But you have not lain hid from me;
but this play of yours is plainly a Satyric one and Silenus-like.
But, my dear Agatho, let not any thing occur in his favour, but do you prepare yourself so that no one may set you and me at vari­ ance.
Whereupon said Agatho, You seem indeed, Socrates, to be speaking very nearly the truth, and I conjecture that he has been reclining between you and me, that he might keep us apart.
There will not, however, occur any thing in his favour from this ;
for I will come and recline by you.
By all means, said Socrates, come hither, and recline below me.
0 Zeus!
said Alcibiades, how greatly again do I suffer from this man !
He fancies he must surpass me in every thing;
but, 0 wonderful man, if nothing else, suffer at least Agatho to recline between us.
It is impossible, said Socrates:
for as you have praised me, it is now necessary for me to praise him, reclining at my right hand.
If, therefore, Agatho reclines below you, he will not surely again praise me, before he has been praised by me.
Cease, then, thou happy fellow, and do not grudge my being praised by the youth ;
for I have a great desire to pass an encomium on him.
Ho !
ho !
said Agatho to Alcibiades, there is no reason why I should remain here, but every reason rather that I should change my place, that I may be praised by Socrates.
This is, said Alcibiades, as usual.
When Socrates is present, it is impossible for any other to share the favours of the beautiful.
And now observe how easily he has discovered a persuasive language, so that this youth should recline at his side.
After this Agatho rose up, as if about to recline close to Socrates.
But on a sudden there came very many revellers to the gates, and, finding them open, in con­ sequence of some one having gone out in an opposite direction, they marched in, and threw themselves on the couches;
and the whole place was filled with uproar, and no longer in any order (every one)57 was compelled to drink a great quantity of wine.
Whereupon Eryximachus and Phædrus, and some others, said Aristodemus, went away,58 but that sleep laid hold of him ;
59 and that he slept for a very long time, as the nights were long, and rose at daybreak while the cocks were crowing;
and on getting up lie saw that the rest of the guests were asleep, or60 gone;
but that Agatho, Aristophanes, and Socrates were still awake, and drinking out of a great bowl, which they kept passing to the right hand,61 and that Socrates was discoursing with them;
but he did not recollect, said Aristodemus, what the discourse was in other respects, as he was not present at the beginning of it, and dozing ;
but the sum of it, he said, was this, that Socrates was compelling them to admit that it was the province of the same person to know how to write comedy and tragedy, and that he, who was by art a tragic poet, was also a comic one;
and that when they had been compelled (to admit) this, they began, as not very well following (the argument),62 to doze;
and that Aristo­ phanes fell asleep the first, and when it was now day, Agatho;
but that Socrates, having put them to sleep, got up and went away;
and that 63he, (Aristodemus,) as he was wont, followed;
and that he (Socrates) went to the Lyceum,63 and, having washed himself as at another time,64 passed the rest of the day ;
65 and having thus passed it till evening, he took his rest at home.
