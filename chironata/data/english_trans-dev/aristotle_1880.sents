IT is my design in the present work to give a more distinct, and, I flatter myself, a juster view, than has yet been exhibit­ ed, of the learning of an age, the most illustrious in history for great events and extraordinary revolutions, yet still more pre- eminent in speculation than it is renowned in action.
A cen­ tury before the reign of Alexander the Great, there sprang up and flourished in Greece a species of learning, or science, totally unlike to any thing before known in the world.
This science was carried to its highest perfection by Aristotle :
it decayed with the loss of his writings, and revived with their recovery.
But the imperfect and corrupt state of those writ­ ings rendered them peculiarly liable to be misinterpreted by ignorance, and misrepresented by envy;
his philosophy, there­ fore, has been less frequently inculcated or explained, than disguised, perverted, and calumniated.
It has not, certainly, since his own time, received any material improvement.
To the philosophical works of Cicero, though that illustrious Ro­ man professes to follow other guides, the world at large is more indebted for a familiar notion of several of Aristotle's most important doctrines, than to the labours of all his com­ mentators1 collectively.
But how loose and feeble, and often how erroneous, is the Roman transcript, when compared with the energetic precision of the Greek original !
Yet the works of Cicero are known universally to the whole literary world, while those of Aristotle (with the exception of a few short and popular treatises) are allowed to moulder away in the dust of our libraries, and condemned to a treatment little less ignominious than that which, as we shall have occasion to re­ late, befell them soon after their composition, when they were immured in a dungeon, and remained for near two centuries a prey to dampness and to worms.
It is time once more to release them from their second unmerited captivity;
to revive, and, if possible, to brighten the well-earned fame of an author, sometimes as preposterously admired, as at others unaccount­ ably neglected;
and whose fate with posterity is most sin- gular in this, not that his authority should have been most respected in the ages least qualified to appreciate his merit, but that philosophers should have despised his name almost exactly in proportion as they adopted his opinions.
The mul­ tiplied proofs of this assertion, which I shall have occasion to produce in examining his works, will not, it is presumed, ap­ pear uninteresting to men of letters.
Those who know some­ thing of Aristotle, must naturally be desirous of knowing all that can be told ;
and of seeing, comprised within a narrow compass, the life and writings of a man, whose intellectual magnitude ought to have preserved and shown him in his proper shape to the impartial eye of history, but whose pic­ ture, beyond that of all other great characters, has been most miserably mangled.
Aristotle, who flourished in Athens when Athens was the ornament of Greece, and Greece, under Alexander, the first country on earth, was born at Stagira towards the beginning of the 99th Olympiad, eighty-five years after the birth of Socrates,' and three hundred and eighty-four before the birth of Christ.
The city of Stagira2 stood on the coast of Thrace, in a district called the Chalcidic region, and near to the innermost recess of the Strymonic Gulf.3
It was origin­ ally built by the Andrians,4 afterwards enlarged by a colony from Eubœan Chalcis,l and long numbered among the Greek cities of Thrace, until the conquests of Philip of Macedon extended the name of his country far beyond the river Stry­ mon, to the confines of Mount Rhodope.
2 Stagira, as well as the neighbouring Greek cities, enjoyed the precarious dignity of independent government;
it was the ally of Athens in the Peloponnesian war, and, like other nominal allies, experienced the stern dominion of that tyrannical republic.
It afterwards became subject to the city and commonwealth of Olynthus ;
which, having subdued Stagira and the whole region of Chal­ cidicé, was itself besieged by Philip of Macedon ;
and, with all its dependencies, reduced by the arms or arts of that politic prince, in the first year of the 108th Olympiad, and 348 years before the Christian era.
3
That the resistance of Sta­ gira was obstinate, may be inferred from the severity of its punishment;
the conqueror rased it to the ground.
4
Aris­ totle, who was then in his thirty-seventh year, had been re­ moved from Stagira almost in his childhood;
and he appears not, in that long interval, to have ever resided in it, and even rarely to have visited it.
5
But the misfortunes which fell on that city gave him an opportunity of showing such ardent af­ fection for his birth-place, as is the indubitable proof of a feeling heart.
Through his influence with Alexander the Great, Stagira was rebuilt;
6 both its useful defences and its ornamental edifices were restored;
its wandering citizens were collected, and reinstated in their possessions ;
Aristotle him self regulated their government by wise laws;
and the Sta­ girites instituted a festival to commemorate the generosity of Alexander, their admired sovereign, and the patriotism of Aristotle, their illustrious townsman.
1
The city of Stagira indeed owes its celebrity wholly to Aristotle and his family;
and, if its name is still familiar to modern ears, this proceeds merely from its having communi­ cated to our philosopher the appellation of Stagirite.
2
His father, Nicomachus, who was the physician and friend3 of Amyntas, king of Macedon, is said to have derived his descent, through a long line of medical ancestors, from Æsculapius, the companion of the Argonauts, whose skill in the healing art had raised him to a seat among the gods.
4
Nicomachus improved a branch of knowledge, which was the inheritance of his family, by writing six books on natural philosophy and medicine.
5
To the same illustrious origin which distinguished Nicomachus, the testimony of one ancient biographer6 (but his only) traces up the blood of Phæstis, Aristotle's mother ;
who whatever was her parentage, certainly acknowledged for her country7 the middle district of Eubœa, which lies within twelve miles of the Attic coast.
Aristotle was deprived of his parents in early youth ;
8 yet it is an agreeable, and not altogether an unwarranted conjecture, that by his father, Ni­ comachus, he was inspired with that ardent love for the study of nature, which made him long be regarded as her best and chosen interpreter ;
1 while from his mother, Phæstis, he first imbibed that pure and sweet Atticism which every where pervades his writings.
Aristotle also inherited from his parents a large fortune;
and their early loss was supplied and compensated by the kind attentions of Proxenus, a citizen of Atarneus in Mysia, who received the young Stagirite into his family, and skilfully directed his education.
These important obligations our philosopher, in whose character gratitude appears to have been a prominent feature, amply repaid to Nicanor the son of Proxenus, whom he adopted, educated, and enriched.
3
At the age of seventeen, 4 the young Stagirite was attracted by the love of learning to Athens, and particularly by the desire of hearing Plato in the Academy, the best school of science as well as of morals then existing in the world;
and where the most assiduous student might find competitors worthy of ex­ citing his emulation and sharpening his diligence.
Plato early observed of him, that he required the rein rather than the spur.
5
His industry in perusing and copying manuscripts was unexampled, and almost incredible ;
he was named, by way of excellence, "the student or reader."
6 Plato often called him the " soul of his school;
” 7 and, when Aristotle happened to be absent from his prelections, often complained that he spoke to a deaf audience.
8
As the student advanced in years, his acuteness was as extraordinary in canvassing opinions, as his industry had been unrivalled in collecting them :
9 his capacious mind embraced the whole circle of sci­ ence ;
and, notwithstanding his pertinacity in rejecting every principle or tenet which he could not on reflection approve, his very singular merit failed not to recommend him to the discerning admiration of Plato, with whom he continued to reside twenty years, even to his master's death ;
alike careless of the honours of a court, to which the rank and connexions of his family might have opened to him the road in Macedon ;
and indifferent to the glory of a name, which his great abilities might early have attained, by establishing a separate school, and founding a new sect in philosophy.
lAt the same time that Aristotle applied so assiduously to the embellishment of his mind, he was not neglectful, we are told, of whatever might adorn his person.
His figure was not advantageous;
he was of a short stature, his eyes were remarkably small, his limbs were disproportionably slender, and he lisped or stammered in his speech.
2
For his ungra­ cious person Aristotle is said to have been anxious to coin­ pensate by the finery and elegance of his dress;
his mantle was splendid;
he wore rings of great value ;
and he was fop­ pish enough (such is the language of antiquity) to shave both his head and his face, while the other scholars of Plato kept their long hair and beards.
To some learned men, the omis­ sion of such particulars might appear unpardonable ;
yet, in a life of Aristotle, such particulars are totally unworthy of be­ ing told ;
since his love for ostentatious finery (probably much exaggerated by his enemies) was in him merely an accessory, which neither altered his character, nor weakened that ardent passion for knowledge which reigned sole mistress of his soul.
In men born for great intellectual achievements, this passion must, at some period of their lives, suppress and stifle every other;
and, while it continues to do so, their real happiness is probably at its highest pitch.
The pursuit of science in­ deed, not having any natural limitations, might be supposed to invigorate with manhood, to confirm itself through custom, and to opiate through life with unceasing or increasing energy.
But this delightful progress is liable to be inter­ rupted by other causes than the decline of health and the decay of curiosity ;
for great exertions are not more certainly rewarded by celebrity, than celebrity is punished with envy, which will sometimes rankle in secret malice, and sometimes vent itself in open reproach ;
wrongs will provoke resentment;
injuries will be offered and retorted;
and, a state of hostility being thus commenced, the philosopher, in defending his opi­ nions and his fame, becomes a prey to the wretched anxieties incident to the vulgar scrambles of sordid interest and sense­ less ambition.
Of this melancholy remark, both the life and the death of Aristotle, as we shall see hereafter, will afford very forcible illustrations.
Plato died in the first year of the 108th Olympiad, and 338 years before the Christian era.
He was succeeded in the Academy by Speusippus, the son of his sister Potona;
a man far inferior to the Stagirite in abilities ;
and however well he might be acquainted with the theory, not strongly confirmed in the practice, of moral virtue, since he was too often and too easily vanquished both by anger and pleasure.
1 Aristotle appears not to have taken offence that, in the succession to his admired master, the strong claim of merit should have been sacrificed to the partialities of blood.
In some of the latest of his writings, he speaks of Plato with a degree of re­ spect approaching to reverence.
Soon after that philosopher's decease, Aristotle wrote verses in his praise, and erected altars to his honour:
2 and the connexions which he himself had already formed with some of the most illustrious as well as the most extraordinary personages of his own or any age, might naturally inspire him with the design of leaving Athens, after he had lost the philosopher and friend whose fame had first drawn him thither, and whose instructive society had so long retained him in that celebrated city.
One of the memorable characters with whom Aristotle maintained a close and uninterrupted correspondence, was Hermeias, styled, in the language of those days, tyrant of Assus and Atarneus ;
a man whose life forcibly illustrates the Strange vicissitudes of fortune.
Hermeias is called a slave and a eunuch;
1 but he was a slave whose spirit was not to be broken, and a eunuch whose mind was not to be emasculated.
Through the bounty of a wealthy patron, he had been enabled early to gratify his natural taste for philosophy;
and, having become a fellow-student with Aristotle at Athens, soon united with him in the bands of affectionate esteem, which finally cemented into firm and unalterable friendship.
Aristotle through life pursued the calm and secure paths of science, but Hermeias ventured to climb the dangerous heights of ambi­ tion.
His enterprising spirit, seconded by good fortune, raised him to the sovereignty of Assus and Atarneus, Greek cities of Mysia, the former situate in the district of Troas, the latter in that of JEolis, and both of them, like most Grecian colonies on the Asiatic coast, but loosely dependent on the Persian empire.
Hermeias availed himself of the weakness or distance of the armies of Artaxerxes, and of the resources with which his own ambition was supplied by a wealthy banker, to gain possession of those strong-holds, with all their dependencies ;
and endeavoured to justify this bold usurpation of the sceptre, by the manly firmness with which he held it.
2
Upon the invitation of his royal friend, Aristotle, almost im­ mediately after Plato's death, revisited Atarneus, 3 the same city in which he had spent the happy years of his youth under the kind protection of Proxenus;
and might we indulge the conjecture that this worthy Atarnean still lived, our philoso­ pher's voyage to Æolis must have been strongly recommended by his desire of repaying the favours of a man whom his gratitude always regarded as a second father, and of thus propping, by his friendly aid, the declining age of his early guardian.
Aristotle found at Atarneus the wish of Plato realized;
lie beheld, in his friend Hermeias, philosophy seated on a throne.
In that city he resided near three years, enjoying the inex­ pressible happiness of seeing his enlightened political maxims illustrated in the virtuous reign of his fellow-student and sove­ reign.
But, to render his condition enviable, an essential requi­ site was wanting, namely, that of security.
Artaxerxes, whose success against the rebels in Egypt had exceeded his most san­ guine hopes, could no longer brook the dismemberment of the fair coast of Mysia, through the usurpation of a slave and a eunuch.
Mentor,l a Greek, and kinsman of Memnon the Rhodian, a general so famous in the Persian annals, had sig­ nalized his zeal and valour in the Egyptian war.
He was one of those crafty and unprincipled Greeks, whom the am­ bitious hopes of raising a splendid fortune often drew to a standard naturally hostile to their country;
and his recent merit with Artaxerxes recommended him as the fittest instru­ ment to be employed in chastising the Mysian usurper.
This employment he did not decline, although the man whom he was commissioned to destroy had formerly been numbered among his friends.
2 Mentor marched with a powerful army to the western coast.
He might have eitected his purpose by open force;
but to accomplish it by stratagem, was both more easy in itself, and more suitable to his character.
He had been connected with Hermeias by the sacred ties of hospi­ tality;
the sanctity of this connexion was revered by the greatest profligates of antiquity;
but the impious Mentor knew no religion but obedience to his master's commands.
He employed his former intimacy with Hermeias as the means of decoying that unwary prince to an interview:
Mentor seized his person, and sent him privately to Upper Asia, where, by order of Artaxerxes, he was banged as a traitor.
1
The cruel artifices of Mentor ended not with this tragedy.
Having possessed himself of the ring which the unfortunate Hermeias usually employed as his signet, he sealed with it his own despatches, and immediately sent them to the cities that acknowledged the sovereignty of a man, whose mild exercise of power tended, in the minds of his subjects, to justify the irregular means by which he had acquired it.
In these de­ spatches Mentor signified that, through his own intercession, Hermeias had obtained peace and pardon from the great king.
The magistrates of the revolted cities easily gave credit to intelligence most agreeable to their wishes ;
they opened their gates without suspicion to Mentor's soldiers, who instantly made themselves masters both of those Mysian strong-holds, which might have made a long and vigorous re­ sistance to the Persian arms, and of the powerful garrisons by which they were defended.
2
One further deception crowned the successful perfidy of Mentor.
He affected to treat the conquered places with unexampled moderation.
He was par­ ticularly careful to keep in their offices the same collectors of revenues and intendants who had been employed by Her­ meias.
Those officers, when they were first apprized of the danger which threatened their master, concealed their trea­ sures under ground, or deposited them with their friends;
but when they found themselves treated with so much unex­ pected generosity by the invader, they resumed their wonted confidence, and conveyed back into their own coffers their long accumulated wealth ;
of which circumstance Mentor was no sooner informed by his emissaries, than he seized both the effects and the persons of those too credulous collectors.
1
The veil of moderation which Mentor's policy had assumed in his first transactions at Atarneus, enabled Aristotle to avoid the punishment which too naturally fell on the ambi­ tion of his friend.
By a seasonable flight he escaped to Mity­ lone in the isle of Lesbos, in company with Pythias, the kinswoman and adopted heiress of the king of Assus and Atarneus, but now miserably fallen from the lofty expecta­ tions in which her youth had been educated.
But this sad reverse of fortune only endeared her the more to Aristotle, who married the fair companion of his flight in his thirty-seventh year ;
2 which is precisely that age pointed out by himself as the fittest, on the male side, for entering into wedlock.
3
Py­ thias died shortly afterwards, leaving an infant daughter, whom Aristotle named after a wife tenderly beloved, and who repaid his affection with the most tender sensibility.
It was her last request that, when Aristotle should die, her own bones might be disinterred, and carefully enclosed within the monument of her admired husband.
4
The Stagirite passed but a short time in the soft island of Lesbos, in the tender indulgence either of love or of melan­ choly.
During his residence in Athens, he had strengthened his hereditary friendship with Philip of Macedon, a prince one year younger than himself, who, having lived from the age of fifteen to that of two-and-twenty in Thebes and the neighbouring cities, ascended the throne of his ancestors in the twenty-third year of his age.
The busy scenes of war and negotiation in which Philip was immediately after his accession engaged by necessity, and in which lie continued to ' be involved during his whole reign by ambition, seem never to have interrupted his correspondence with the friends of his youth ;
with those who either possessed his affection, or who merited his admiration.
1
In the fifth year of his reign his son Alexander was born ;
an event which he notified to Aristotle in terms implying much previous communication between them :
"
Know that a son is born to us.
We thank the gods for their gift, but especially for bestowing it at the time when Aristotle lives ;
assuring ourselves that, educated by you, he will be worthy of us, and worthy of inheriting our kingdom.”
2
If this letter was written at the æra of Alexan­ der's birth, it must have found Aristotle at Athens in his twenty-ninth year, still a diligent student in the school of Plato.
But it is certain that the Stagirite did not assume the office of preceptor to the son of Philip till fourteen years afterwards, when the opening character of this young prince seemed as greatly to merit, as peculiarly to require, the as­ sistance of so able an instructor.
3
In the second year of the 109th Olympiad, Aristotle, probably in consequence of a new invitation from Philip, sailed from the isle of Lesbos, in which he had resided near two years, escaped the dangers of the Athenian fleet, which then carried on war against Macedon, and arrived at the court of Pella,4 to undertake one of the few employments not unworthy of an author qualified to in­ struct and benefit the latest ages of the world.
In the education of Alexander, the Stagirite spent near eight years;
1 during which long period, in an office of much delicacy, he enjoyed the rare advantage of giving the highest satisfaction to his employers, while he excited the warmest gratitude in his pupil.
2
The temper of Alexander, prone to every generous affection, loved and esteemed many;
but Aristotle is the only one of his friends whose superior genius he appears unceasingly to have viewed with undiminished admiration, and whom he seems to have treated through life with uniform and unalterable respect.
By Philip and his proud queen Olympias, our philosopher was honoured with every mark of distinction which greatness can bestow on illustrious merit.
Philip placed his statue near to his own :
he was admitted to the councils of his sovereign, where his advice was often useful, always honourable;
and where his kind intercession benefited many individuals, and many com­ munities.
3
On one occasion the Athenians rewarded his good services, by erecting his statue in the citadel :
4 and his letters, both to Philip and to Alexander, attested his unremitting ex­ ertions in the cause of his friends and of the public, as well as his manly freedom in admonishing kings of their duty.
5
But the ruling passions of Philip and Alexander, the interested policy of the one, and the lofty ambition of the other, were too strong and too ungovernable to be restrained by the power of reason, speaking through the voice of their admired philosopher.
The ambition of Alexander had early taken root;
and the peculiarities of his character had displayed themselves, in a very public and very important transaction, which happened several months before the Stagirite arrived at the court of Pella.
During Philip's Illyrian expedition, Macedon was honoured with an embassy from the great king.
In the absence of his father, Alexander, at that time scarcely fourteen years old, received the ambassadors;
and his conversation with those illustrious strangers, at a period in history when the public conferences of great personages consisted not merely in words of ceremony, afforded a just subject of praise and wonder.
Instead of admiring their ex­ ternal appearance, or asking them such superficial questions as corresponded with the unripeness of his years, he inquired into the nature of the Persian government ;
the character of Ochus, who then reigned;
the strength and composition of his armies;
the distance of his place of residence from the western coast;
the state of the intermediate country, and particularly of the high roads leading to the great capitals of Susa and Babylon.
1
To his premature love of aggrandize­ ment, Alexander already added singular dexterity and unex­ ampled boldness in his exercises, particularly in horsemanship ;
the most fervid affections, invincible courage, and unbending dignity.
2
In training such a youth, the Stagirite had a rich field to cultivate ;
but he could only hope to give a new direction to passions, which it was too late to moderate or control.
In his treatise on Politics, he has carefully delineated the plan of education best adapted to persons of the highest rank in society;
and in performing the task assigned to him by Philip, this plan was to be skilfully modified, by adjusting it to the peculiar circumstances and extraordinary character of his pupil.
Alexander's loftiness could not be conquered, but it might be made to combat on the side of virtue:
if he was angry, it was proved to him that anger was the effect of in­ sult, and the mark of inferiority.
3
His love for military glory, which, while it is the idol of the multitude, will always be the passion of the great, could neither be restrained nor moderated;
but, to rival this tyrant of the breast, still more exalted affections were inspired, which rendered Alexander as much superior to conquerors, as conquerors deem them­ selves superior to the lowest of the vulgar.
Agreeably to a maxim inculcated in that book of Aristotle's Politics which relates to education, the two years immediately following puberty constitute that important period of life, which is peculiarly adapted for improving and strengthening the bodily frame, and for acquiring that corporeal vigour which is one mainspring of mental energy.
During this interesting period of youth, with the proper management of which the future happiness of the whole of life is so intimately connected, Aristotle observes that the intellectual powers ought indeed to be kept in play, but not too strenuously exercised, since powerful exertions of the mind and body cannot be made at once, nor the habits of making them be simultaneously ac­ quired.
In conformity with this principle, Alexander was encouraged to proceed with alacrity in his exercises, till he acquired in them unrivalled proficiency;
after which, the whole bent of his mind was directed to the most profound principles of science.
It is the opinion of many, that a slight tincture of learning is sufficient for accomplishing a prince.
Both Philip and Aristotle thought otherwise;
and the ardent curiosity of Alexander himself was not to be satisfied with such superficial and meagre instructions as have been sometimes triumphantly published for the use of persons destined to reign.
The young Macedonian's mind was therefore to be sharpened by whatever was most nice in distinction, and to be exalted by whatever was most lofty in speculation;
1 that his faculties, by expanding and invigorating amidst objects of the highest intellection, might thereby be rendered capable of compre­ hending ordinary matters the more readily and the more perfectly.
1
This recondite philosophy, which was delivered by the Stagirite, first to his royal.
pupil, and afterwards to his hearers in the Lyceum, received the epithet of acroatic;
2 to distinguish those parts of his lectures which were confined to a select audience, from other parts called exoteric, be­ cause delivered to the public at large.
It has been sup­ posed that, in those two kinds of lectures, the Stagirite main­ tained contradictory doctrines on the subjects of religion and morality.
But the fact is far otherwise:
his practical tenets were uniformly the same in both ;
but his exoteric or popular treatises nearly resembled the philosophical dialogues of Plato or Cicero;
whereas his acroatic writings (which will be ex­ plained in the following chapter) contained, in a concise, energetic style peculiar to himself, those deep and broad prin­ ciples on which all solid science is built, and, independently of which, the most operose reasonings, and the most intricate com­ binations, are but matters of coarse mechanical practice.
3
The sublimity of this abstract and recondite philosophy admirably accorded with the loftiness of Alexander's mind ;
and how highly he continued to prize it, amidst the tumultuary occupa­ tions of war and government, appears from the following letter, written soon after the battle of Gaugamela, and while he was yet in pursuit of Darius:
" Alexander, wishing all happiness to Aristotle.
You have not done right in publish­ in, your acroatic works.
Wherein shall we be distinguished above others, if the learning, in which we were instructed, be communicated to the public.
I would rather surpass other men in knowledge than in power.
Farewell.”
1 Aristotle, not considering this letter as merely complimental, answered it as follows :
"
You wrote to me concerning my acroatic works, that they ought not to have been published.
Know that in one sense this still is the case, since they can be fully under­ stood by those only who have heard my lectures."
2
Of those much valued writings, the theological part, if at all published, was probably most involved in a sublime obscurity.
To have maintained, in plain and popular language, the unity and perfections of the Deity, must have excited against the Stagirite an earlier religious persecution than that which really overtook him.
Yet in this pure theology Alexander was carefully instructed;
as his preceptor reminded him in the midst of his unexampled victories and unbounded con­ quests, concluding a letter with this memorable admonition;
that “ those who entertain just notions of the Deity are better entitled to be high-minded, than those who subdue kingdoms.”
3Aristotle's love of philosophy did not, like that of Plato, set him at variance with poetry.
He frequently cites the poets, particularly Homer;
and he prepared for his pupil a correct copy of the Iliad, which that admirer of kindred heroes always carried with him in a casket, whence this transcript was called " the Iliad of the Casket.”
1 The Stagirite was not only the best critic in poetry, but himself a poet of the first eminence.
Few of his verses indeed have reached modern times ;
but the few which remain prove him worthy of sounding the lyre of Pindar ;
2 and it is not the least sin­ gularity attending this extraordinary man, that with the nicest and most suitable powers of discrimination and analysis, he united a vigorous and rich vein of poetic fancy.
Aristotle carefully instructed his pupil in ethics and politics.
He wrote to him, long afterwards, a treatise on government;
and exhorted him to adjust the measure of his authority to the various character of his subjects ;
agreeably to a doctrine which he frequently maintains in his political works, that dif­ ferent nations require different modes of government, respect­ ively adapted to their various turns of mind, and different habits of thinking.
3
From the ethical writings of Aristotle which still remain, and which are the most practically useful of any that pagan antiquity can boast, it is easy to detect that wicked calumny of his enemies, " that, for sordid and selfish purposes, he accommodated the tenets of his philosophy to the base morals of courts."
4
It may be safely affirmed, that if Alexander is distinguished above other princes for the love of knowledge5 and virtue, he was chiefly indebted for this ad­ vantage to his preceptor:
the seeds of his haughtiness and ambition were sown before Aristotle was called to direct his education;
his excellencies therefore may be ascribed to our philosopher;
1 his imperfections to himself, to Philip, above all to the intoxicating effects of unbounded prosperity.
This is the language of antiquity, and even of those writers who are the least partial to the fame of the Stagirite.
After the most intimate communication during the space of eight years,2 the pupil and the preceptor separated for ever.
to pursue, in a career of almost equal length, the most oppo­ site paths to the same immortal renown ;
the one by arms, the 1 other by philosophy;
the one by gratifying the most immo­ derate lust of power, the other by teaching to despise this and all similar gratifications.
During his eastern triumphs, ter­ minated in the course of ten years by his premature death, Alexander (as we shall have occasion to relate) gave many illustrious proofs of gratitude to the virtuous director of his youth.
One incident, and one only, seems to have occasioned some disgust between them.
At leaving the court of Pella.
Aristotle recommended, as worthy of accompanying Alex­ ander in his Persian expedition, his own kinsman Callisthenes, an Olynthian;
a learned and certainly an honest man, but of a morose, unaccommodating temper, pertinaciously attached to the old system of republicanism, which the father of Alex­ ander had overturned in Greece;
equally daring and inflexi­ ble in his purposes, and unseasonably bold in his speech.
3
Aristotle himself perceived and lamented his faults, and ad­ monished him in a line of Homer, " that his unbridled tongue might occasion his early death."
4
The prophecy was fulfilled.
Callisthenes, not reflecting that “ he who has once conde­ scended" (in the words of Arrian) "to be the attendant of a king, ought never to be wanting in due deference to his will," rudely and outrageously opposed Alexander's resolution of exacting the same marks of homage from the Greeks which were cheerfully paid to him by the Persians.
1
The manner of Callisthenes's punishment and death is related more vari­ ously2 than almost any historical event of such public noto­ riety ;
but most writers concur in opinion, that he met with the just reward of his rashness and arrogance.
This trans­ action, it is asserted, much estranged Alexander from his an­ cient preceptor.
The assertion however is not accompanied with any solid proofs and the absurd calumny, that Aris­ totle not only regarded this pretended displeasure as an injury, but even proceeded to the wickedness of joining in a con­ spiracy against Alexander's life, is warranted by nothing in history, but a hearsay preserved in Plutarch, and the affected credit given to the monstrous report by the monster Caracalla, for the unworthy purpose of justifying his own violence in destroying the schools of the Aristotelian philosophers in Alexandria, the burning their books, and depriving them of all those privileges and revenues which they enjoyed through the munificence of the Ptolemies, Alexander's Egyptian successors.
5Having taken leave of the Macedonian capital, Aristotle returned to his beloved Athens;
where he spent thirteen6 years, almost the whole remainder of his life, instructing his disciples, and improving the various branches of his philoso­ phy.
His acreage lectures were given in the morning to those who were his regular pupils.
7
A considerable part of them is still preserved in his works, which form an abstract or syllabus of treatises on the most important branches of philosophy.
His exoteric discourses were held after supper with occasional visitors, and formed the amusement of his evening walks;
1 for he thought “exercise peculiarly useful after table for animating and invigorating the natural heat and strength, which the too rapid succession ofsleep to food seem fitted to relax and encumber Before his arrival at Athens, Speusippus was dead;
and Xenocrates, whose dull gravity and rigid austerity a man of Aristotle's character could not much admire, had taken possession of the Academy.
3
The Stagirite, therefore, settled in a gymnasium in the suburbs, well shaded with trees, near to which the soldiers used to ex­ ercise, and adorned by the temple of Lycian Apollo, from whose peripaton, or walk, Aristotle and his followers were called Peripatetics.
4
It is reported that he opened his school, observing, " That it would be shameful for himself to be si­ lent while Xenocrates publicly taught."
5 Aristotle is not likely to have uttered such a presumptuous boast;
but if it was really made, even this arrogant speech was certainly very fully justified by the fame which the Lyceum speedily ac­ quired, which the Stagirite himself maintained unimpaired through life, and which was ably supported by his disciple and successor Theophrastus.
Such is the genuine history of Aristotle's life, in the most important passages of which all the ancient writers,6 who have expressly treated his biography, unitedly concur.
By arranging the subject, therefore, according to our present method, both my own labour will be abridged, and the reader's time will be saved;
for the calumnies against Aristotle will be no sooner mentioned than they will refute themselves, and they could not pass unnoticed, because they are perpetuated­ in the sarcasms of Lucian, 1 and the lying whispers of Athp­ næus, 2 which have been too often mistaken, even by the learned, for true history.
The absurd reports that Aristotle first served in the army, that he there dissipated his fortune by low profligacy, and then followed for bread the trade of an apothecary,3 may be confidently rejected by those who know, on unquestionable authority, that he became, at the early age of seventeen, a diligent student in the Academy at Athens, where he remained during the long period of twenty years.
The reader who has seen the testimonies of his gratitude to Plato, will not easily be persuaded that he could treat this revered master with the grossest brutality;
4 and let him who reads and meditates on the Ethics to Nicomachus ask his own heart, as well as under­ standing, whether it is likely that the author of such a treatise should, instead of restraining and correcting, have flattered5 and fomented the vices of Alexander.
Instead of further ex­ amining these wild fictions, which stand in direct contradiction to the matters of fact above related, it is of more importance to inquire whence such improbable tales could have originated;
especially as this inquiry will bring us to the events which immediately preceded our philosopher's death.
From innumerable passages in the moral and political works of which we have presumed to offer the translation to the public, it will appear that Aristotle regarded with equal con­ tempt vain pretenders to real science, and real professors of sciences which he deemed vain and frivolous.
His theologi­ cal opinions, also, were far too refined for the grossness of paganism.
He fought only for truth, and was careless of the obstacles which stood in his way to attaining it, whether they were found in the errors of philosophers, or in the prejudices of the vulgar.
Such a man, in such a city as Athens, where, since the days of Socrates, the learned taught publicly and conversed freely with all descriptions of persons, could not fail to have many rivals and many enemies.
Sophists and sciolists, soothsayers and satirists, and that worst of banes satirical historians,1 heaped obloquy on a character, the orna­ ment of his own age, and destined to be the great instructor of posterity.
But the name of Alexander, which then filled the world, was duly respected, even in the turbulent demo­ eracy of Athens;
and it was not till the year following the death of that incomparable prince, that the rancorous malig­ nity, which had been long suppressed, burst forth against Aristotle with irresistible violence.
He was accused of ir­ religion (ἀσεβείας) before the Areopagus by the hierophant Eurymedon, abetted by Demophilus, a man of weight in the republic;
and both of them were instigated to this cruel prosecution by our philosopher's declared enemies.
2
The heads of the accusation were, " that Aristotle had commemo­ rated the virtues both of his wife Pythias and of his friend Hermeias, with such ceremonies and honours as the piety of Athens justly reserved for the majesty of the gods."
To Hermeias, indeed, he erected a statue at Delphi;
he also wrote an ode in his praise.
Both the inscription and the ode have come down to modern times;
the former simply relating "the unworthy and treacherous death of Hermeias and the latter “extolling virtue above all earthly possessions ;
and especially that generous patriotism, for the sake of which the native of Atarneus, rivalling the merit of Hercules and Achilles, had willingly relinquished the light of the sun ;
whose fame there­ fore would never be forgotten by the Muses, daughters of memory ;
and as often as it was sung would redound to the glory of Hospitable Jove, and the honour of firm friendship.”
1 From the frivolousness of the accusation respecting Hermeias, which was considered as the chief article of the impeachment, we may warrantably conjecture that the reproach of worship­ ping Pythias with honours due to Eleusinian Ceres, was al­ together groundless:
but in a philosopher, whose intellectual rather than his moral virtues have been the object of panegy­ ric, we may remark with pleasure both the strength of his friendship, and the sincere tenderness of his love, since both affections must have been expressed with an amiable enthu­ siasm, to enable even the malice of his enemies to interpret them into the crime of idolatry.
It must not be dissembled that the accusation, and conse­ quent condemnation, of Aristotle by the Areopagus, has been ascribed to a different cause from that above assigned, and re­ ferred merely to the impiety of his tenets.
He is said by those who have carelessly examined his works, to have de­ nied a Providence, and thence to have inferred the inef­ ticacy of prayers and sacrifices :
doctrines, it is observed, which could not but enrage the priesthood, as totally subversive of its functions, establishments, and revenues.
1
But never was any accusation urged more falsely or more ignorantly.
Aris­ totle, as it will be shown hereafter, enumerates the priesthood among the functions or offices essentially requisite to the ex­ istence of every community.
In writing to Alexander he says, that those are not entitled to be high-minded who con­ quer kingdoms, but rather those who have learned to form just notions of the gods ;
2 and in his life, as well as in his works, he uniformly showed his veneration for religion in general, by treating with great tenderness,3 even that distorted image of it reflected from the puerile superstitions of his country.
4
He is said to have written his own defence,5 and to have inveighed, in a strong metaphor, against the increasing dege­ neracy of the Athenians.
6
His discourse, of which the bold­ ness would only have inflamed the blind zeal of his weak or wicked judges, was not delivered in court :
since he escaped his trial by seasonably quitting Athens for Cbalcis in Eubcea, saying, in allusion to the death of Socrates, that he was un­ willing to afford the Athenians a second opportunity of sin­ ning against philosophy.
7
He survived his retreat to the shores of the Euripus scarcely a twelvemonth ;
persecution and banishment having probably shortened his days.
8
His testament, preserved in Diogenes Laertius, accords with the circumstances related concerning his life, and prac­ tically illustrates the liberal maxims of his philosophy.
An­ tipater, the confidential minister of Philip, regent of Macedon both under Alexander and after his demise, is appointed the executor of this testament, with an authority paramount, as it should seem, to that of the other persons who are afterwards conjoined with him in the same trust.
To his wife Her­ pyllis, (for he had married a second time,) Aristotle, besides other property in money and slaves, leaves the choice of two houses, the one in Chalcis, the other his paternal mansion at Stagira;
and desires, that whichever of them she might pre­ fer, should be properly furnished for her reception.
He com­ mends her domestic virtues;
and requests his friends that, mindful of her behaviour towards him, they would distinguish her by the kindest attention ;
and should she again think of a husband, that they would be careful to provide for her a suitable marriage.
To Nicomachus, his son by this Herpyllis, and to Pythias, the daughter of his first wife, he bequeathed the remainder of his fortune, with the exception of his library and writings, which he left to his favourite scholar Theo­ phrastus.
1
He desires that his daughter, when she attained a marriageable age, should be given to Nicanor, the son of his ancient benefactor Proxenus;
and failing Nicanor, that his esteemed disciple Theophrastus should accept her hand and fortune.
The bones of his first wife, Pythias, he ordered to be disinterred, and again buried with his own, as she her­ self had requested.
None of his slaves are to be sold ;
they are all of them either emancipated by his will, or ordered to be manumitted by his heirs, whenever they seem worthy of liberty;
an injunction conformable to the maxims inculcated in his Politics, that slaves of all descriptions ought to be set free, whenever they merited freedom, and are qualified for enjoying it.
He concludes with a testimony of external de­ ference at least for the religion of his country, by ordering that the dedications which he had vowed for the safety of Nicanor, should be presented at Stagira to Jupiter and Mi­ nerva, the saviours.
Thus lived, and thus died, in his 63rd year, Aristotle the Stagirite.
His enlightened humanity was often seasoned by pleasantry.
Many strokes of genuine humour, little suspected by his commentators, will be found in his political writings.
His smart sayings and quick repartees were long remembered and admired by those who were incapable of appreciating his weightier merits.
Some of these sayings, though apparently not the most memorable, are preserved in Diogenes Laertius ;
of which the following may serve for a specimen.
Being asked,
What, of all things, soonest grows old ?—Gratitude.
What advantage have you reaped from study? —
That of doing through choice what others do through fear.
What is friendship?
—One soul in two bodies.
Why do we never tire of the company of the beautiful ?-The question of a blind man !
Such apophthegms would be unworthy of mention, had they not, by their perpetual recurrence in our philosopher's conversation, shown a mind free and unencumbered amidst the abstrusest studies ;
and, together with the most intense thought, a readiness of wit, which never failed to repel sneerers, and to abash arrogance.'
He exhibited a character as a man, worthy of his pre-eminence as a philosopher;
inhabit­ ing courts, without meanness and without selfishness ;
living in schools, without pride and without austerity;
2 cultivating with ardent affection every domestic and every social virtue, while with indefatigable industry he reared that wonderful edifice of science, the plan of which we are still enabled to delineate from his imperfect and mutilated writings.
The extraordinary and unmerited fate of these writings, while it excites the curiosity, must provoke the indignation of every friend to science.
Few of them were published in his life-time;
the greater part nearly perished through neglect;
and the remainder has been so grossly misapplied, that doubts have arisen whether its preservation ought to be regarded as a benefit.
Aristotle's manuscripts and library were bequeathed to Theophrastus, the most illustrious of his pupils.
Theo­ phrastus again bequeathed them to his own scholar Neleus, who, carrying them to Scepsis, a city of the ancient Troas, left them to his heirs in the undistinguished mass of his pro­ perty.
The heirs of Neleus, men ignorant of literature and careless of books,1 totally neglected the intellectual treasure that had most unworthily devolved to them, until they heard that the king of Pergamus, under whose dominion they lived, was employing'much attention and much research in collecting a'large library.
2
With the caution incident to the subjects of a despot, who often have recourse to concealment in order to avoid robbery, they hid their books under ground ;
and the writings of Aristotle, as well as the vast collection of materials from which they had been composed, thus remained in a subterranean mansion for many generations, a prey to dampness and to worms.
3
At length tliey'were released from their prison, or rather raised from the grave, and sold for a large sum, together with the works of Theophrastus, to Apellicon of Athens, a lover of books rather than a scholar ;
1 through whose labour and expense the work of restoring Aristotle's manuscripts, though performed in the same city in which they had been originally written, was very imperfectly executed.
To this, not only the ignorance of the editors, but both the condition and the nature of the writings themselves, did not a little contribute.
The most considerable part of his acroatic works, which are almost the whole of those now re­ maining, consist of little better than text books,- containing the detached heads of his discourses;
and, through want of connexion in the matter, peculiarly liable to corruption from transcribers, and highly unsusceptible of conjectural emend­ ation.
What became of Aristotle's original manuscript we are not informed ;
but the copy made for Apellicon was, together with his whole library, seized by Sylla, the Roman conqueror of Athens, and by him transmitted to Rome.
2* Aristotle's works excited the attention of Tyrannion, a native of Amysus in Pontus, who had been taken prisoner by Lucullus in the Mithridatic war, and insolently manumitted,3 as Plutarch says, by Muræna, Lucullus's lieutenant.
Tyrannion procured the manuscript by paying court to Sylla's librarian;
and commu­ nicated the use of it to Andronicus of Rhodes, who flourished as a philosopher at Rome, in the time of Cicero and Pom­ pey;
and who, having undertaken the task of arranging and correcting those long-injured writings, finally performed the duty of a skilful editor.
1
Though the works which formed the object of Andronicus's labours had suffered such injuries as the utmost diligence and sagacity could not completely repair,2 yet in consequence of those labours the Peripatetic philosophy began to resume the' lustre of which it had been deprived since the days of The­ ophrastus;
and the later adherents to that sect, as they became acquainted with the real tenets of their master, far surpassed the fame and merit of their ignorant and obscure predecessors.
3
From the æra of Andronicus's publication to that of the in­ vention of printing, a succession of respectable writers on civil and sacred subjects (not excepting the venerable fathers of the Christian church) confirm, by their citations and criti­ cisms, the authenticity of most of the treatises still bearing Aristotle's name;
and of more than ten thousand4 commen- tators, who have endeavoured to illustrate different parts of his works, there are incomparably fewer than might have been expected, whose vanity has courted the praise of su­ perior discernment by rejecting any considerable portion of them as spurious.
1
According to the most credible accounts, therefore, he composed above four hundred2 different trea­ tises, of which only forty-eight3 have been transmitted to the present age.4
But many of these last consist of several books, and the whole of his remains together still form a golden stream5 of Greek erudition, exceeding four times the col­ lective bulk of the Iliad and Odyssey.
THIS book embraces three subjects, the noblest and most interesting that civil science can boast:
the origin of society and government;
the distinction of ranks in a commonwealth ;
and a comparison of the best plans of political economy.
On each of these topics I shall offer a few remarks, not with the presumption of interposing my own judgment, but with the hope of justifying or illustrating the decisions of my author.
In explaining the origin of political society, Aristotle writes neither the satire nor the panegyric of human nature;
which, by writers of less wisdom than fancy, have been al­ ternately substituted for plain history.
In this, as in all other inquiries, his first question is, what are the phenomena ?
His second, what is the analogy of nature ?
Building on these foundations, he concludes that both society and government are as congenial to the nature of man, as it is natural for a plant to fix its roots in the earth, to extend its branches, and to scatter its seeds.
Neither the cunning, cowardly princi­ ples asserted by Hobbes and Mandeville, nor the benevolent moral affections espoused by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, ac­ cording to our author's notions, ought to be involved in the solution of the present question:
since the first political so­ cieties are as independent of human intelligence, and there­ fore of moral determination,.
as the instinctive actions of plants and insects, tending to the preservation of their respective kinds, are independent of any intelligence of their own ;
even when they move and operate conformably to the laws of the most consummate wisdom.
Government, then, is coeval with society, and society with men.
Both are the works of nature ;
and therefore, in ex­ plaining their origin, there cannot be the smallest ground for the fanciful supposition of engagements and contracts, inde­ pendently of which the great modern antagonist of Aristotle declares, in the following words, that no government can be lawful or binding:
" The original compact, which begins and actually constitutes any political society, is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority, to unite and to incorporate into such a society.
And this is that, and that only, which could give beginning to any lawful go­ vernment in the world.”
1 From this maxim, which is per­ petually inculcated in Locke's two treatises on government, is fairly deducible the inalienable right of mankind to be self- governed;
that is, to be their own legislators, and their own directors ;
or, if they find it inconvenient to assume the ad­ ministration of affairs in their own persons, to appoint repre­ sentatives who may exercise a delegated sovereignty, essen­ tially and inalienably inherent in the people at large.
Thence results the new inalienable right of all mankind to be fairly represented, a right with which each individual was invested from the commencement of the world, but of which, until very recently, no one knew the name, or had the least notion of the thing.
2
From this right to fair representation, there follows, by necessary consequence, the right of universal suffrage, universal eligibility, and the universal and just preponderancy of majorities in all cases whatever.
Such is the boasted and specious theory begun in the works of our Locke and our Molyneux,3 continued in those of our Price1 and our Priestley,2 and carried to the utmost extrava­ gance in those of (I wish not to say our) Rousseau,3 Paine,4 and the innumerable pamphleteers whose writings occasioned or accompanied the American and French revolutions.
Such works, co-operating with the peculiar circumstances of the times, have produced, and are still producing, the most extraordinary effects ;
by arming the passions of the multitude with a false principle, fortifying them by specious arguments, and thereby stirring into action those discordant elements which naturally lurk in the bosom of every community.
It is not consistent with my design, in defending the tenets of my author, to answer his political adversaries with declamation and obloquy,—(a rash and dangerous attempt!
since the voice of the multitude will always be the loudest and the strong­ est,)—but merely to examine whether the fundamental maxim of their great master, Locke, be itself founded in truth.
To prove that government is merely a matter of consent, he as­ sumes for a reality a wild fiction of the fancy;
what he calls a state of nature, which he defines to be " men living to­ gether according to reason, without a common superior on earth with authority to judge between them."
5
But he him­ self seems aware that this supposed natural state of man is a state in which man never yet was found ;
and in which, if by violence thrust into it, he could not remain for a single day.
Locke, I say, saw the difficulty;
which, instead of meeting, he only endeavours to elude. “
Where are there," he asks, " 01 ever were there, any men in such a state of nature?"
6
He answers, " that since all princes and rulers of independent governments, all through the world, are in the state of nature, it is plain the world never was, and never will be, without numbers of men in that state."
7
But this, I affirm, is not to answer the proposed question ;
for princes and rulers of inde­ pendent states do not live together, nor associate and " herd," as he himself expresses it, in the same society.
If they did so, they could not subsist without government:
for government and society are things absolutely inseparable;
they commence to­ gether ;
they grow up together;
they are both of them equally natural;
and so indissolubly united, that the destruction of the one is necessarily accompanied by the destruction of the other.
This is the true sense of Aristotle, as understood and expressed by an illustrious defender of just government and genuine liberty.
"
As we use and exercise our bodily mem­ bers, before we understand the ends and purposes of this ex­ ercise, so it is by nature herself that we are united and associated into political society.
”
1Locke, who so severely, and,. as I have endeavoured to prove, so unjustly arraigns what is called Aristotle's Meta­ physics, appears to have equally mistaken his Politics.
Had he understood2 the invaluable work to which he refers in terms of commendation, this idol of modern philosophers, and especially of modern politicians, would not probably (since he was a man of great worth as well as of great wisdom) have produced a theory of government totally impossible in practice;
a theory admirably fitted, indeed, for producing revolutions and sedition, but according to which, as is evinced by all history, no political fabric ever yet was reared;
or if it were to be reared, could ever possibly be preserved.
3
The neglect or misapprehension of some of the most important parts of Aristotle's writings is indeed most deeply to be la­ mented.
Of the many thousand authors who have copied or commented on his Logic, the far greater number omit his in­ teresting chapters on language;
deeming the consideration of words below the dignity of philosophers.
His profound ob servations concerning the nature and constitution of a family have been equally overlooked by his pretended followers in politics.
Yet as his analysis of language has been proved to be the sole foundation of logic, so his analysis of a family, and his explanation of the causes through which its elements na turally and regularly combine, can alone enable.
us clearly to discern the analogous principles—(principles continually in sisted on by himself)—which have raised and upheld the great edifice of civil society;
which is not a mass, but a sys­ tem, and which, like every system, implies a distinction of parts;
with many moral as well as physical differences, rela­ tive and reciprocal;
the powers and perfections of one part supplying the incapacities and defects of another.
To form a commonwealth from elements of equal value, or of equal dig­ nity, is an attempt not less absurd than that of composing a piece of music from one and the same note.
A difficult question follows, how far social inequality, whe­ ther civil or domestic, may be allowed to extend ?
It is with a trembling hand that I touch the delicate subject of slavery ;
an undertaking to which nothing could encourage me, but the utmost confidence in the humanity, as well as in the judg­ ment, of my author.
First of all, Aristotle expressly con­ demns the cruel practice, prevalent in his own days, of en­ slaving prisoners of war;
1 secondly, he declares, in the most explicit terms, all slaves fairly entitled to freedom, whenever it clearly appears that they are fitly qualified for enjoying it.
But the benefits conferred on men, he observes, must in all cases be limited by their capacities for receiving them;
and these capacities are themselves limited by the exigencies and necessities of our present imperfect condition.
The helpless­ ness of infancy and childhood, the infirmities of old age, and the urgencies attending mankind in every stage of their exist­ ence on earth, render it indispensably necessary that a great proportion of the species should be habitually employed in mere mechanical labour, in the strenuous exertions of pro­ ductive industry, and the petty tasks of domestic drudgery.
Nature, therefore, in whose plan and intention the system of society precedes and takes place of the parts of which it is composed, has variously organized and moulded the human character as well as the human frame, without setting other bounds to this variety, than are imposed by the good of the whole system, of which individuals are not independent units, but constituent elements.
According to this plan or inten­ tion, the Stagirite maintains, that there is room for the widest of all discriminations, and the lowest of all occupations, do­ mestic servitude, a species of labour not employed in produc­ tion, but totally consumed in use;
because solely, but not unprofitably, spent in promoting the ease and accommodation of life.
In the relation of master and servant, the good of the master may indeed be the primary object;
but the benefit of the servant or slave is also a necessary result, since he only is naturally and justly a slave, whose powers are competent to mere bodily labour;
who is capable of listening to reason, but incapable of exercising that sovereign faculty;
and whose weakness and short-sightedness are so great, that it is safer for him to be guided or governed through life by the pru­ dence of another.
But, let it always be remembered, that " one class of men ought to have the qualifications requisite for masters, before another can either fitly or usefully be em­ ployed as slaves."
Government, then, not only civil but do­ mestic, is a most serious duty, a most sacred trust;
a trust, the very nature of which is totally incompatible with the supposed inalienable rights of all men to be self-governed..
Those rights, and those only, are inalienable, which it is im­ possible for one person to exercise for another:
and to main tain those to be natural and inalienable rights, which the persons supposed to be invested with them can never possibly exercise, consistently either with their own safety, or with the good of the community, is to confound all notions of things, and to invert the whole order of nature ;
1 of which it is the primary and unalterable law, that forecast should direct improvidence, reason control passion, and wisdom command folly.
2
I now proceed to examine Aristotle's reflections on political economy, which are not less adverse than his long misunderstood and often mistated vindication of slavery itself, both to the theories formerly prevalent, and to others which have begun recently to prevail among the civilized nations of modern Europe.
The northern conquerors who invaded and desolated the Roman empire, disdained to produce by slow industry, what they gloried in ravishing by sudden violence.
War was their delight and their trade.
They subsisted by rapine ;
and therefore cared not how far they were excelled by others in peaceful and productive arts, while gold, and all that it could purchase, might be conquered by iron.
But the spoils of ra­ pacity having supplied them with the instruments of luxury, they began to relish the pleasures of repose ;
and instead of courting new dangers abroad, to imitate at home those objects and conveniences which, though they had not the genius to invent, they gradually acquired the taste to approve, the vanity to display, and the desire to accumulate.
Manufactures then were established :
navigation was exercised for the purpose not only of war, but of traffic:
an extensive commerce was in­ troduced ;
and colonies were planted.
The avowed purpose of all those operations was to augment in each country the quantity of gold and silver ;
since, with those precious metals, all other coveted objects might usually be procured.
The business of each individual merchant is to get money;
and commercial nations, it was thought, could not reasonably have any other end in view.
This false principle was regarded as the basis of all sound political arithmetic ;
and the most con­ clusive reasoning of Aristotle, in the book now before us, would not perhaps have sufficed to prove, that national wealth consisted not in gold and silver, had not the ruined state of Spain confirmed experimentally the same important truth.
For many years back, political writers have acknowledged, with our author, that the real wealth of nations consists in the productive powers of their land and labour.
They acknow­ ledge also, with him, that the precious metals, in contradis­ tinction to other useful commodities, have only the peculiar advantage of serving as the fittest instruments of exchange, and the most accurate measures of value ;
but that the quantity of number in which they ought to be desired or accumulated is, like the quantity and number of all other measures or in­ struments, naturally limited and fixed by the ends and oper­ ations which they are employed to answer or effect.
1
Yet, while they reason thus justly respecting gold and silver, the same writers have not sufficient enlargement of mind to ge­ neralize their assertion, and to perceive with our author that property itself is as much an instrument as money, though serving for a far more complicated purpose ;
and therefore, if it be collected in greater quantities than that purpose requires, the surplus will be at best useless, most commonly pernicious ;
will inflame desire, foment luxury, provoke rapacity, and pro­ duce that long train of disorders, which made our philosopher declare, " that the inhabitants of the Fortunate Isles, unless their virtue kept pace with their external prosperity, must inevitably become the most miserable of all mankind.”
1
In the fashionable systems of modern politicians, national wealth is considered as synonymous with national prosperity.
To the increase of productive industry and the augmentation of pub­ lie revenue, both health, education, and morals are sacrificed without apology and without remorse ;
since that trade is uni­ versally held to be the best, which produces most money with the least labour.
But according to Aristotle, it is not the quantity or the value of the work produced, that ought to form the main object of the statesman's care, but the effect which the producing of that work naturally creates on the mind and body of the workmen.
In the praises of agricul­ ture and a country life, our author's sentiments and expres­ sions have been faithfully and generally copied by the most judicious writers of antiquity;
many of whom mark with as much reprobation as Aristotle himself, that species of traffic which is cultivated, not for accommodation but for gain ;
since such a traffic, universally diffused among a people, has a tend­ ency to pervert their feelings, and to confound their princi­ ples ;
to make them value as ends, things only useful as means;
and to debase and corrupt every part of their charac­ ter ;
because wherever wealth is the primary object of pursuit, luxury will naturally afford the principal source of enjoyment.
In agriculture and pasturage, the energy of nature co-operates with the industry of man.
They are, of all occupations, the most beneficial and most necessary, as well as the most agree­ able and most salutary;
conducing, with peculiar efficacy, to the firmest and happiest temperament of the mind and body:
and the property acquired by them is intrinsically more valu­ able, because essentially more useful, than any other property whatever.
Our author likewise maintains, that those natural and primeval pursuits are of all the least likely to engender sloth, intemperance, avarice, and their concomitant vices;
and that nations of husbandmen, in particular, afford materials susceptible of the best political form, and the least disposed to disturb, by sedition, any moderately good government un­ der which it is their lot to live.
In consideration of so many advantages attending it, he concludes that rural labour ought to be the most favoured branch of national industry;
an opi­ nion which nothing but the intrepidity of ignorance, fortified by false system, could venture to contradict.
Yet, how far other methods of accumulating stock, beside those proposed by our author, ought to be admitted and encouraged, or dis­ couraged and rejected, must depend on circumstances and events, the force of which the philosopher's experience could not supply him with the means exactly to appreciate.
From the artifices and shifts which he explains,—(and he is the only writer that explains them,)—as practised by the repub­ lics and- princes of his own and preceding times, for the purpose of raising money, it was impossible for him to conjec­ ture that, in a future age of the world, monarchical govern­ ment should attain such stability as would render the public revenues a safe mortgage to creditors;
that the immense debts contracted through the facility of borrowing, would have a direct tendency, by interesting a great number of powerful individuals in the permanence of constituted author­ ities, to augment that facility itself, and thereby still further to accumulate the national debt;
for discharging the interest of which, heavy taxes must necessarily, but not altogether unprofitably, be levied, since they would in some measure re­ pity, in public security, the burdens which they impose on personal labour, or rather the sums which they withdraw from private property.
But taxes to a great amount cannot possi­ bly be raised, except in countries flourishing in such resources as agriculture and pasturage alone were never yet able to afford;
resources, which can only be acquired by war and rapine on the one hand, or obtained on the other, by the powers of national industry, assisted and multiplied by the most complicated machinery, and an endless subdivision of allotted tasks ;
each individual performing his part quickly and dexterously, because each has but one, and that a small part, to perform;
while the diligence of all is perpetually stimulated by the bait of gain, supplied from the exhaustless fund of an enlightened commercial spirit, as extensive as the world, and as enterprising as those renowned adventurers who discovered and explored its remotest regions.
It is in vain to inquire whether the plan of political economy pro­ posed by Aristotle be in itself preferable to that which some modern nations pursue.
Nations, circumstanced as they are, may derive armies chiefly from agriculture, but must princi­ pally depend for supplies on manufactures and commerce.
The option of their own or a better system is now no longer in their power:
the question of expediency has ceased:
they must obey necessity.
'This seems to me the only firm ground of defence for what is called the commercial system of economy;
a system which has often been defended by very inclusive arguments.
"
Pub­ lic wealth and prosperity," Mr. Hume observes, "is the end of all our wishes ;
” and this wealth or prosperity, both he and his follower, Dr. Smith, maintain, is only to be promoted by encouraging, with equal impartiality, all kinds of lawful in­ dustry ;
for though food be the great want of mankind, yet one man may produce as much food as will maintain many.
2
But this assertion is not true in the acceptation in which it must be taken, in order to recommend the commercial system above the agricultural.
In agriculture, as we above observed, nature operates in concert with man ;
and though one family co-operating with nature, may, in a given piece of ground, produce as much food as will serve six, yet six families la­ bouring the same ground, will not reap a proportional in­ crease ;
and twenty families labouring the same ground, may find it barely sufficient to supply their own nourishment.
The more that the land is laboured, it will be the more pro­ ductive ;
and the more fitly and fairly it is divided,' (other circumstances remaining the same,) it will be the more la­ boured ;
and the same country or island will thus maintain the greater proportion of inhabitants employed in that kind of work, which, according to Aristotle, is the most favourable to health, morals, good government, the development of intel­ lectual as well as corporeal powers, and the attainment of that measure of happiness which the general mass of mankind can ever in this world hope to reach.
INTRoDuCToRy.-Aristotle, in conformity with his usual custom, commences the first Book of his treatise with a prac­ tical inquiry into the parts or elements of which the state is composed;
and having laid down a brief outline of the first principles of man's social nature, and of domestic life in its various relations, he shows how these relations na­ turally combine into that form of social existence which is called a state.
But before entering theoretically into the nature of the best state, he gives, in Book II., a brief account of, and criticism upon, the various forms of government which have been devised by philsosophers and politicians.
In Book III.
he proceeds to discuss in detail the state, the citizen, and the government, with its various forms, and their respective perversions and corruptions.
In Book IV.
he gives a brief outline of his " Polity," or perfect republic, (πολιτεία,) with an enumeration of the magistrates necessary for carrying it out:
while Book V. enters philosophically into the causes which tend to overthrow it.
In Book VI.
he returns to the subject of democracy and oligarchy ;
while in the two con­ cluding books of his treatise—(which has evidently come down to us in a mutilated condition )-he enters into an ela­ borate discussion of the best regulations of government in his ideal polity, descending to the comparatively minute par­ ticulars of the sites necessary for towns and houses, and the laws requisite for regulating matrimony and the education of the young, with a special view to the interests of the com­ munity.
In Book VIII.
he commences his inquiry into the education of the young, which breaks off most abruptly just at the point where we should most earnestly have desired to see our author's opinions fully and fairly worked out, in the de­ velopment and practical application of those principles which he has so carefully laid down.
INTRoDUCTORY.- THE first book divides itself into three pacts. (1.) Chap. i. and ii., concerning the family (οἶκος) and village (κώμῃ), as integral parts of the state (πόλις). (2.) Chap. iii.—vii. and xii. xiii., concerning the three domestic relations, the herile, conjugal, and paternal. (3.) Chap. viii. —xi., concerning the getting of money (ἡ χρηματιστική).
CHAP.
I.—All society aims at some good end;
therefore its best and highest form will aim at the best end.
Monarchical and republican governments do not differ in number alone, but also in kind.
To ascertain the nature' of a state, we must first con­ template it in its component parts.
CHAP.
II.
—The first of domestic relations is the conjugal:
this is both natural and necessary;
the male being by nature formed and fitted to rule, the female to obey.
The second relation is the herile:
the slave formed by nature to obey.
Yet the wife and the slave differ, (except among barba­ rians).
From the former of these relations springs the paternal tie :
And the combination of these three ties forms the family (οἶκος).
The gradual development of the family described, and the consequent.
formation of the village (κώμη), which is defined.
The antiquity of monarchical rule deduced from the fact that families were originally under one head.
The formation of the state (πόλις);
and its definition ;
its test, αὐτάρκεια, (i. e. its power to supply its own wants).
The facts adduced here prove man to be a social creature, (πολιτικόν ζω̃ον,) and the founder of political life to be the greatest of benefactors to the human race.
CHAP.
III.
—In domestic rule, (οἰκονομία,) the three relations of the head as master, husband, and father, give the three kinds of government which it embraces.
These three relations further considered.
CHAP.
IV.—Possessions (κτήματα) are parts of a house;
and hence ἠ κτητική is part of the economic art.
Possessions are either animate (ἄψυχα) or inanimate, (ἔμψυχα,) and relate either to πόιησις or to πρα̃ξις.
A slave (δου̃λος) is a living instrument for practical pur­ poses, (ἔμψυχον ὄργανον τω̃ν πρὸς τὴν πρα̃ξιν,) and he is a part of his master, though separable (χωριστόν).
The description of the characteristics of a good slave.
CHAP.
V.—Some are slaves by nature and birth, (φύσει,) as others are free and born to rule.
This point established by sundry analogies, from the soul with regard to the body, from the male with regard to the female, etc., and from inanimate things.
We infer, then, that subjection is a law of nature ;
and as some men are born wholly inferior to others in mental and moral endowments, it is clear that it is not only expedient but just that they should be slaves.
Mental power and energy is the test of free birth ;
mere bodily efficiency marks the slave, whose whole excellence (ἀρετὴ) lies in mere bodily activity.
CHAP.
VI.
—There is also a second kind of slavery, which is not natural, but by compact and agreement, as for example, where prisoners taken in war are reduced to the rank of slaves.
Some persons think this slavery just, others unjust.
Aristotle attempts to reconcile the conflicting opinions by laying down, that while such slavery is abstractedly unjust, still to a certain extent it is defensible, because sanctioned by the common law of nations.
But it must be always unjust, when the war from which it results is unjust, or when persons of noble birth are enslaved.
Slaves and their masters can have an identity of interest, if they are such φύσει;
but nothing of the kind can exist between the conqueror and his captive, because that relation does not.
exist between them φύσει.
CHAP.
VII.—Despotic and civil (πολιτική) rule differ;
the former is over slaves, the latter over freemen.
The ruler of a household has monarchical or despotic power.
The test of political government is the alternation of power and office between the rulers and the ruled.
The science of ruling a household, so far as it relates to slaves, is of an inferior character.
CHAP.
VIII.
—Domestic rule is over, (1.) Persons;
as wife, children, and slaves. (2.) Possessions.
Having already explained the herile relation, Aristotle postpones (to chap. xii.) the further discussion of the domes­ tic rule over persons, and confines himself to that over pos­ sessions.
Money-getting (ἡ χρηματιστική) differs from the economic art, in that the work of the former is to provide, of the latter to use what has been already procured.
‛H χρηματιστική is divided into natural and artificial.
Its natural form divided " secundum vitæ, genera, et modos.”(1.) The pastoral life. (2.) The chase. (3.) Agriculture.
[The art of war (ἡ πολεμική) comes partially under the second of these heads ;
for it is just to hunt by war men who are born to be slaves.]
True wealth consists, not in money, but in the produc­ tions of nature.
Every possession has two possible uses:
the one proper, the other improper, as a shoe may be used either to cover the feet or for exchange.
In the family all things were held in common ;
but as families and villages increased into states, a system of ex­ change grew up of necessity;
and money was devised as the standard and common measure of this exchange.
The artificial form of ἡ χρηματιστική and the economic art differ in the fact that the former has no limit in its work of collecting money, whereas the latter is limited by the wants and necessities of man.
CHAP.
X.—The money-getting art is subservient to the eco­ nomic art, though not strictly a part of it.
But it is only in its natural form that this is true;
forIts artificial form (which is called ἡ καπηλική, traffic) does not directly contribute to the ends of nature ;
and besides,In its furthest development, usury, (τοκισμός,) it is to be abominated, as being entirely unnatural (παρὰ φύσιν).(1.) Natural, embracing (a.) agriculture and (β.) cattle.
Besides these two divisions, there is a third or mixed kind, which is concerned with mining (ἡ μεταλλευτική).
Division of labours into servile and noble.
The advantage of a practical knowledge of these matters shown by the example of the philosopher Thales.
CHAP.
XII.
—Aristotle here goes back to consider the conjugal and paternal relations.
In the former relation, the husband exercises political rule.
in the latter, the father exercises a despotic rule.
Where political rule prevails, the ruler for the time being is invested with external signs of dignity.
'HAP.
XIII.
—The master of a house should first regard the persons over whom he rules, next, the possessions.
He should strive to make each person perform his own ἔργον virtuously.
How a wife;
a child, and a slave differ in their respective virtues (ἀρεταί).
Slaves must be forced by punishments to perform their work voluntarily;
but wives and children must be vir­ tuously trained.
Hence the necessity of a system of education for the women and children in every republic.
(INTRODUCTORY.)
This book is divided into two parts;
(1.) chap. i.—viii., in which Aristotle discusses the ideal po­ lities of Plato and of others, and (2.) chap. ix.—xii., in which he treats of the existing constitutions of Sparta, Crete, and Carthage.
CHAP.
I.—In order to exhibit the best form of a state, we must examine the best existing states, and also the purely ideal state (h μάλιστσ Kar' εὐχήν).
It is necessary that there should be in every state (1.) a community of all things, or (2.) of some things only, or (3.) of nothing.
The last of these three alternatives is contradicted by the very idea of a state, as being a community, and sharing therefore in site, etc.
Ought then some things, or ought every thing, to be in common in a good state ?
In Plato's Republic all things are in common among the citizens, even their children and wives.
Should this be so or not ?
CHAP.
II.
—Plato's Republic discussed.
The opinion of Socrates and Plato as to the community of wives and children refuted.
Aristotle denies that a state is best in proportion as it is more entirely one ;
for, (1.) the very theory of a state excludes such a unity as Plato imagines;
and (2.) a state is overthrown by too complete a unity (προïου̃σα καὶ γιγνο­ μένη μία μα̃λλον οὄδε πόλις ἔσται).
A state is composed of persons differing in species (ἐξ εἴδει διαφερόντων) ;
and it is the just balance (τὸ ἴσον τὸ ἀντιπεπονθός) of the various elements which compose a state that preserves it.
Moreover a state must be self-dependent (ἀυτάρκης).
But all αὐτάρκεια would be destroyed by this Platonic unity.
CHAP.
III.
—But granting that this unity tends to preserve, and not to destroy a state ;
it does not follow that unity would be realized, though the citizens should call their pro­ perty common (ἐὰν πάντες ἄμα λέγωσι τὸ ἐμὸν καὶ τὸ μη ἐμόν).
For the word "all" (πάντες) is used in two senses;
1st, collectively, 2nd, distributively.
And as every thing, (as wives, children, etc.,) would be­ long to all the citizens collectively alone, and not distri­ butively, they would not be cared for, since what is every­ body's business is nobody's (ἥκιστα γὰϱ ἐπιμελείας τυγχάνει τὸ πλέιστων κοινόν).
Such a state of things, instead of binding families to­ gether, would do away with family affections, and so weaken the state.
CHAP.
IV.
—It would also give rise to incests and murders, which would be inexpiable.
Certain other difficulties and inconsistencies noticed in the Republic of PlatoHow far the community of wives should be extended.
Evils arising from the interchange of children, and from the fact that nature will defeat the end proposed by So­ crates, by the likeness of the children to individual citizens.
CHAP.
V.—As to community of property, instead of bringing about unity, it will be the parent of discord.
It will also cause neglect, for what is everybody's busi­ ness is nobody's.
It will deprive individuals of the pleasure derived from that which is TO ἴδιον καὶ τὸ ἀγαπητόν.
It will cut off opportunities of practising the virtues of temperance and liberality.
This too great unity, then, will destroy the very essence of a state, as harmony would be destroyed if all sounds were reduced to a single note.
A state then is not a mere individual, but a body com­ posed of dissimilar parts, (πλη̃θος ἐξ ἀνομοίων,) and its unity is to be drawn "ex dissimilium hominum consensu.
"The perpetuity of the magistrates in office, which flows as a consequence from the myth in Plato concerning the three classes of citizens, in whose natures gold, silver, and brass are blended, will be a further cause of strife.
It is also absurd to attempt to make the whole state happy, while its component parts are deprived of their proper happiness.
CHAP.
VI.—Plato's book of Laws discussed.
It omits all mention of many important points;
such as the discipline of the citizens.
It divides the citizens into two classes or castes, but says nothing of the lower class bearing arms.
It says nothing of the education of the lower class.
It confines itself to laws, and says little about govern­ ment.
Some discrepancies noticed between the " Laws " of Plato and his " Republic.”General character of the Socratic dialogues.
Absurdity of framing polities which cannot be realized ;
and of using vague terms ;
And of enforcing equality of property.
It is better to regulate the population.
Pheidon the Cor­ inthian.
Plato.
Plato's state tends to a perfect community of goods, but does not approach the true standard of excellence.
Great merits of the Spartan constitution;
it blends to­ gether a variety of forms.
The monarchical form has not justice done to it in the Republic of Plato.
Prevalence of the oligarchic principle in the election of senate.
CHAP.
VII.
—The ideal state of Phaleas ;
based on equality of property, as a guarantee against discord.
We object, first, that he limits the property, but not the number of the citizens ;
And further, that an equality of property does not suffice to suppress discords;
Because, if men do not contend about goods, they will for honour.
Other points are left undefined by Phaleas, as to military affairs and external policy.
CHAP.
VIII.
—The ideal state of Hippodamus consisted of 10,000 citizens, divided into three classes, artizans, hus­ bandmen, and soldiery.
IThe land of the state to be divided into three parts, sa­ cred, common, and private.
Three kinds of law-suits to be admitted, with one su­ preme tribunal of appeal;
and the amount of punishment to be settled by the sentence of the judges written on a tabletHonours and rewards to be given to those who have done good service to the state, and their children to be reared at the public expense.
The magistrates to be elected by the three classes of the people.
Objections of Aristotle against the system of Phaleas.(1.) He has done wrong in giving full rights of citizens to the second and third class, though he has deprived them of arms.(2.) The husbandmen till the land, not for themselves, but for the soldiery.(3.)
There is no class to till the public land, each being busied with its own duties.(4.) The office of the judge is confounded with that of an arbiter.(5.)
The system of rewards tends to produce calumnies and detractions, and thus a premium is offered for innova­ tions ;
but a change of laws and institutions is perilous in any state.
CHAP.
IX.
—In testing a constitution, we should ask, (1.) whether it is consistent with the idea of perfection or not ? and (2.) whether it is consistent with itself?
All political writers agree that citizens should be ex­ empted from illiberal arts and labours.
But they differ as to the means of effecting this end.
The Spartan constitution faulty, (1.) Because it allots the illiberal arts to strangers, and gives agriculture to the He­ lots.(2.) It does not enforce authority over the women.
Hence the women at Sparta, and indeed in all warlike states, grow licentious, owing to the long absence of the male population who are serving in arms.(3.) Too great a share of property is given to the women at Sparta.(4.) The choice of Ephors from the lower ranks is ob­ jectionable.(5.) The senators retain their office when they are too old and past their work.(6.) The common meals are open to objection as being defrayed by private and not public cost.(7.) The permanency of the post of admiral of the Spar­ tan fleet is objectionable.(8.) The end of the Spartan constitution and of the in­ stitutions of Lycurgus, namely, war, is a wrong end.
As was proved by fact:
for Sparta throve, as long as she was engaged in war and acquiring power;
but as soon as she had gained the summit of her ambition, she fell through luxury and licentiousness.
CHAP.
X.—The constitution of Crete is like that of Sparta, though less skilfully contrived.
How Lycurgus became acquainted with the legislation of Minos.
The natural advantages of the situation of Crete.
Analogy between the Spartan Helots and the Cretan serfs—common tables—the Ephors and Cosmi.
Objections against the constitution of the senates of Sparta and Crete, as irresponsible (ἀνυπεύθυνοι).
Practical evil consequences.
The insular position of Crete saves it from external at­ tacks, and keeps the serfs from revolting.
CHAP.
XI.
—The constitution of Carthage is like the two above mentioned:
but better;
for it has remained a long time un­ changed.
Common tables.
Council of the " hundred and four," answering to the Ephors and Cosmi.
The kings or suffetes at Carthage chosen on a better principle than at Sparta.
The ruling body chosen on a good principle.
Tendency of this state to pass into an oligarchy.
Advantages of placing political power in the hands of those only who have a competency.
Two points to be remarked in the constitution of Carthage ;
(1.)
Admixture of oligarchic and democratical principles.(2.) Pluralism, and its ill effects.
CHAP.
XII.
—Different writers on Politics, both statesmen and philosophers.
Various opinions concerning Solon.
Fusion of different elements in the Athenian system.
Aristocratical tendency of the Areopagus ;
this was gra­ dually diminished as the popular power increased after the Persian war.
Solon introduced a plutocracy.
His different ranks.
Other legislators.
THIS book naturally is divided into two parts. (1.) Chap. i.—v., in which the definition of a citizen and of a city or state is considered. (2.) Chap. vi.—xvii., which discuss succes­ sively the various forms of government.
CHAP.
I.—First question, "what is a state?
”It is a whole body or system made up of citizens.
What then is a citizen?
To answer this, let us first see who are not citizens.
Slaves, sojourners, children, degraded persons, (ἄτιμοι,) are not called citizens, because they have no share in the government.
It is this share which constitutes a man a citizen.
Ob­ jection answered.
But in different stages it is not always the same persons who will have the rights of citizens;
( e. g. in a tyranny the people have no share.)
Hence our definition of a citizen will only apply strictly to a democracy or polity;
for no one can be truly a citizen who is absolutely excluded from obtaining civil power.
CHAP.
II.
—The popular definition of a citizen, as a person who has one parent at least a citizen, considered.
Its absurdity shown by considering the case of the first founders of a state or a family.
The true test of citizenship is the actual right of holding office ;
whether justly or unjustly, it matters not.
CHAP.
III.
—The identity of a state is not altered, though its outward form is changed.
When may a state be said to be the same ?
Its identity does not consist in mere sameness of situation.
Is it then in containing the same inhabitants ;
as a river or fountain is still the same, though its waters are for ever changing ?
No, for the form of government may be changed, though its material part continues the same.
It consists therefore, in the same form of government being preserved.
CHAP.
IV.
—The good man and the good citizen are not ab­ stractedly (ἁπλω̃ς) the same ;
nor, consequently, is the virtue of the one and of the other the same.
For the virtue of a good man is always the same, since it is the union of all the moral virtues.
But that of a good citizen differs with the form of go­ vernment ;
and in the same state the virtue of some citizens differs from that of others.
The virtue of a ruler in a state, and of a good man, may possibly be the same;
and in the best ideal state, the good citizens must also be good men.
The peculiar virtue of a ruler is φϱόνησις, or prudence.
Servile occupations do not befit citizens.
In a political government, or that of equals, the citizen must learn how to obey and command;
and therefore, to some extent, the virtue of a good citizen and of a good man may be identical.
CHAP.
V.—Reasons for regarding mechanics as citizens, and also for excluding them from citizenship.
In the best state, mechanics and tradesmen will not be citizens.
They may be admitted, however, to civil rights in an oligarchy or democracy, especially if they become rich.
CHAP.
VI.
—Being about to speak concerning the various forms of government, Aristotle now proceeds to define a common­ wealth (πολιεία).
The government differs according to the number of hands in which the supreme power is lodged.
Man is a social being, and has a natural tendency to asso­ ciate with others, even apart from all consideration of per­ sonal wants and mutual benefits.
The rule of a master over his slave is primarily for the benefit of himself, and accidentally for that of his slave;
but • the master of a house rules over his wife and children for their common good as well as his own.
Just so, in states, the ruling body, be it composed of one or of many, may regard the interest of itself only, or that of the entire community.
All those forms of government which regard the common good, are right and proper forms.
And those which do not, are perversions or corrupt forms (παρεκβάσεις).
CIIAP.
VII.
—The various kinds of government.
There are three proper kinds, (1.) monarchy, (2.) aris­ tocracy, and (3.) a commonwealth.
Corresponding to which are their three respective per­ versions, (1.) tyranny, (2.) oligarchy, (3.) democracy.
The latter are distinguished from the former, by their regarding the interest, not of the community in general, but of the rulers only.
CHAP.
VIII.
—Tyranny is a despotic monarchy:
.
and the sub­ jects of a tyranny are analogous to slaves.
The state is an oligarchy when power is exclusively in the hands of the rich;
a democracy, when in the hands of the poor only;
whether they be few or many, in either case it matters not.
Still it seldom happens that the rich in an oligarchy are many in number, or that the poor in a democracy are few.
CHAP.
IX.
—The Athenians held that a democracy was just;
the Spartans thought in like manner of an oligarchy;
the former considering that every thing should be equal, as the citizens were all equal in liberty;
the latter, that things should be equal among those who were already equal in power and riches.
Now neither party are wholly right.
For firstly, individuals are bad judges in their own case.
And secondly, they are apt to confound what is relatively just with that which is so abstractedly.
Virtue and merit, not riches and liberty, ought to have supreme power in the state ;
and the best citizens are not the most wealthy or free, but those of the highest virtue.
This position proved from considering the end of a state ;
which is, not merely life, or mutual aid, or commercial in­ tercourse, but a perfect and happy life, sufficiently supplied with external goods, and which looks to virtue as its aim.
CHAP. x.
—In whose hands ought the supreme power of a state to be lodged ?
In the hands of one or of more ?
The different inconveniencies which arise under each form of government.
Under a democracy, there is danger of the poor laying violent hands on the property of the rich.
Under an oligarchy, there is danger lest the wealthy few should tyrannize over the poor.
Under an aristocracy, lest the many should be left ex­ eluded from honours and office.
Under a monarchy, lest all but the reigning sovereign should be excluded.
But if any one says that the law should be supreme, the difficulty remains the same;
for the law must be adminis­ tered by men, under any form of government, and must be accommodated to that form.
CHAP.
XI.
—It is better to lodge power in the hands of the many than of the few.
For collectively the citizens will unite many points of ex­ cellence which one individual could not possess.
It is not however safe to intrust the highest magistracies to a poor and ignorant multitude, nor yet wholly to exclude them from office.
They must therefore have a share in deliberative and judicial functions.
Thus Solon gave them at Athens the right of election and of scrutiny (εὐθύνη).
A fusion of the upper and lower classes is good for both and for the state.
Brief review of the constitution of Solon.
In the professors of the arts there are three grades;
the lowest grade executes practically, another prescribes, while the third and highest studies the theory;
and even the lowest grade, by mere experience, comes to be a fit judge of matters within its own sphere.
Just so in political matters, the multitude, even though they know nothing of the political science, and hold no ma­ gistracy, still can form a good practical judgment upon go­ vernment in general, and even a better one than those in office, who cannot see their own defects and errors.
The supreme power should rest with the laws, if they are just.
CHAP.
XII.
—Justice (τὸ δίκαιον) is the end of the political science.
But justice is a certain equality;
and equality is of two kinds, like justice itself.
In distribution of honours, mere equality or inequality of things is not to be regarded.
But the end and interest of the state itself must be taken into account.
CHAP.
XIII.
—If a state contains the rich, the noble, the good, and the multitude, to which of these classes shall the public honours be given ?
To answer this, let us first settle whether upright laws ought to regard the interest of the good, or of the multi­ tude.
Clearly they should refer to the common good:
and a citizen will be one who has a share both in governing and in being governed.
The citizen differs in each different form of government, etc.
As to men of pre-eminent and heroic virtue, if such be found, the supreme power should be given to them;
for they stand in the relation of gods to their fellow-men ;
and it is absurd to legislate for such individuals ;
for they are a law to themselves.
Great pre-eminence, however, in merit or civil power, is an object of suspicion among citizens.
Ostracism devised as a remedy against this evil in free states.
Corresponding methods adopted in other states.
The principle defended from the analogy of the arts.
Pre-eminence ofpolitical power not to be tolerated ;
but the man who is pre-eminent in virtue should be elected king, and receive perfect submission from all.
CHAP.
XIV.
—Discussion concerning particular forms of go­ vernment ;
firstly concerning the right forms, secondly con­ cerning their perversions.
Is monarchy better adapted for practical purposes than any other form ?
To answer this question, we distinguish the different kinds of monarchy.(1.) That established at Sparta ;
which is, in fact, a per­ petual generalship.(2.) Hereditary;
as among barbarians.(3.) Elective ;
called Æsymneteia in ancient Greece.(4.) Limited monarchy, such as that of the heroic times.
CHAP.
XV.
—These five kinds may be reduced to two, the ab­ solute and the Lacedæmonian forms.
Two questions proposed ;
(1.)
Is it for the interest of the state to have a perpetual monarchy established, as at Sparta ?
This question postponed.(2.) Is it better to be under an absolute king, or under the best of laws ?
The law does not enter into particular cases, but the king can do so in executing the law.
It is absurd, therefore, to go upon a mere written law.
On the other hand, the law is not affected by passion as a king is.
In the best state, the law and the king should conspire.
Is it better to leave the correction of the written law to one or to many ?
Three reasons in favour of the latter.
Monarchy, as compared with aristocracy, is free from fac­ tions ;
though if the members of an aristocracy be good, they can be as one man;
hence aristocracy is to be pre­ ferred.
Monarchy proved to be the more ancient form;
for it was easier to find one good man than many;
and it is only as good citizens increased, that aristocracies supplanted mon­ archies, and in turn were supplanted by democracies.
The love of wealth and gain next paved the way for oligarchies, which soon were turned into tyrannies, and these at length reverted to the form of democracies.
Two questions proposed ;
(1.)
Whether upon the suppo­ sition of a monarchy being the best form, it ought to be made hereditary ? (2.)
Whether a king has need of arms and soldiery to support him ?
The former question left unsolved:
it is bad to have as kings the degenerate sons of noble parents;
but it is na­ .
tural for a parent to bequeath his power to his son.
The second question solved:
the king ought to have a sufficient guard to enforce the laws.
CHAP.
XVI.
—An absolute monarchy not natural.
It is better that the law should be supreme, than any citizen.(1.) The citizens being all equal, it is unjust not to give them equal dignity.
(The law should be supreme, and the magistrates minis­ ters of the law.)(2.) The law is intellect free from all passions, and the supremacy of the law is but the supremacy of God under another name.
(The argument supported by the analogy of the medical art.)(3.)
Many eyes see better than one eye.(4.) Two good men are better than one.(5.) The policy of kings in power proves the superiority of aristocracy;
for they impart a share of their power to friends.
CHAP.
XVII.
—Men are not all fitted to one kind of govern­ ment ;
but some to a despotism, others to a political state.
Three kinds of government are natural;
monarchy, aris­ tocracy, and a republic ;
the others are unnatural..
In a true and well-constituted republic, all the citizens should have a share of rule.
Any person of pre-eminent merit ought to be chosen king ;
for any other arrangement will involve an inequality and absurdity.
The same course of education and training which make a good man, will also make a good citizen or king.
INTRODUCTORY. — THIS book contains three parts:
(1.) Chap. i.—iii., which treats of states in general. (2.) Chap. v.—xiii., of their different forms. (3.) Chap. xiv.—xvi., the component parts of a free state.
CHAP.
I.—The politician ought to be acquainted with four things;
(1.)
What is the best ideal and abstract polity.(2.) What is the best viewed practically.(3.) The nature of the constitution of his own state and its means of preservation.(4.) What government is best suited to all states.
Argument drawn from analogy of the arts and sciences.
The medical art ought to ascertain the best abstract bodily condition, the same viewed practically, and so forth.
The politician ought to study existing forms of govern­ ment, and existing laws.
CHAP.
II.
A repetition of what was said in the last book con­ cerning monarchy and aristocracy, and the division of governments into natural and unnatural.
We come now to consider a polity properly so called ;
and also to treat of oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny.
A tyranny is the worst perversion, as being the corrup­ tion of the best form.
And consequently a democracy is the least bad perversion.
An outline of our future method.
CHAP.
III.
—A variety of constituent parts causes a corre­ sponding variety in the forms of government.
The rich and the poor, the noble and ignoble, etc., con­ stitute these different parts.
The noble, too, may be so called, from their riches, or their birth, or their personal merit.
The error of those who reckon only two forms of govern­ ment, oligarchy and democracy.
CHAP.
IV.
—The test of a democracy is the supreme power being vested in its poor but free citizens, as superior in numbers to the rest.
That of an oligarchy in its being vested in the wealthy citizens, though inferior in numbers.
As the various genera of animals are distinguished by the varied composition of their bodily organs, so it is in polities.
And their different genera are subdivided into various minuter species.
The component parts of a state are eight different classes.
Plato censured for introducing into his state none but such as are employed in necessary matters of daily life, emitting such as belong to the liberal arts.
Five classes of democracies;
the last of which is tyran­ nical, because the laws are not supreme in it.
CHAP.
V.—Oligarchy distinguished into its four kinds.(1.) When its members are chosen from a high census.(2.) When its members are chosen from a low census, to supply vacancies.(4.) When the richest individual is chosen, without re­ gard to the law or merit.
This tyrannical, and called a dynasty.
CHAP.
VI.
—Democracy similarly distinguished into its four kinds.
In what cases the four kinds of oligarchy are respectively found.
CHAP.
VII.
—A polity, properly so called, very rarely found in existence.
There are three kinds of aristocracy, to be distinguished from each other.
CHAP.
VIII.
—A polity or republic.
It is an admixture or fusion together of oligarchy and democracy;
its offices being open, as in the former, to the rich, and to the poor, as in the latter.
And hence, it is called an aristocracy or a democracy, according as it tends to the one or the other of these extremes.
But the name of an aristocracy is not rightly given to it;
for an aristocracy and an oligarchy differ very widely.
CHAP.
IX.
—The origin of a polity considered.
It arises from a fusion of oligarchic and democratic prin­ ciples;
and this in three ways.(1.) Where a fine is laid on the rich, and pay is given to the poor.(2.) Where the standard is moderate for the admission of citizens to political power.(3.) Where an oligarchic principle (such as election by votes) is combined with a democratic principle (such as election of persons without an income).
The first test of a good admixture is, if you are able to call the same state by either name indiscriminately;
for each extreme should be recognised in the mean.
CHAP.
X.—Three kinds of tyranny. (1.) That among bar­ barians. (2.) The (Esymnetic.
These are not tyrannies, but monarchies, if exercised over willing subjects.
Upon this point, see above, book iii.(3.)
The last kind is that which is the most perfect coun­ terpart to monarchy;
viz.
where one individual is supreme and irresponsible, and consults his own interest, and not that of his subjects.
CHAP.
XI.
—The best practicable form of government and the happiest state is that in which the middle ranks are very numerous.
For the upper ranks, if many, become factious and de­ spotic :
the lower classes, if they preponderate, produce fraud and malice, and tend to servility.
The middle state safest and best.
This kind of republic is rarely found, because a large middle class is rare:
so democracies and oligarchies pre­ vail.
The best form of democracy, or of oligarchy, is that which most nearly approximates to this polity;
the worst, which departs furthest from it.
CHAP.
XII.
—The conservative element ought to have greater weight and authority in a state than the element which is given to change.
There are two things in a state, quality and quantity.
By quantity is meant numbers;
by quality, wealth, no­ bility, etc.
Sometimes the one party excels in quantity, and the other in quality.
A democracy is best where the popular party by its quan­ tity surpasses the quality of the nobler class ;
an oligarchy, where the contrary takes place.
The law to be especially directed to the interests of the middle class.
The mistakes of statesmen who seek to bend states towards aristocracy.
The riches of the wealthy more to be feared than the humble state of the poor;
for the people will easily rise against a wealthy nobility.
CHAP.
XIII.
—The tricks used by nobles against the poor, and by the poor against the nobles.(1.) The rich nobles cajole the lower orders in matters connected with the assembly, the magistracies, the law courts, the arms, the exercises.(2.)
On the contrary, the people have their own weapons of defence ;
in oligarchies they fine the rich, in democracies they pay the poor for attendance at the council.
In a polity, rightly so called, the chief power lies in the hands of the soldiery.
After the cessation of monarchy in Greece, the soldiery constituted the state;
first the cavalry, and second, the foot- soldiers.
CHAP.
XIV.
—There are three departments in every republic:
the deliberative, the executive, and the judicial.
The first of these is the chief.
A share in its deliber­ ations is either given to all citizens, (in which case it is de­ mocratic ;
) or else to a few only, (which renders it olig­ archic ;
) or such a share is given to all in certain matters only;
or to a select few in certain matters.
The tendency of the state affected by the mode of elec­ tion.
It will be aristocratic, if the election is by vote ;
de­ mocratic, if by lot.
Democratical and oligarchical precepts.
In democracies pay should be given to the poor for at­ tendance ;
the rich should be fined for absenting themselves.
Persons to be chosen from all ranks for deliberation.
In an oligarchy, some few members of the senate should be chosen by the people.
Power of deliberation to be given to all members of the state;
but of execution, only to the magistrates.
The power of pardon to be given to the many;
of con­ demnation, to the magistrates only.
CHAP.
XV.
—As to the magistracy, a question arises as to what and how many they should be, perpetual or not, and from what class they should be chosen.
A magistrate defined as one who has the right of deliber­ ation, of judging, and of ordaining, but especially the last right.
With respect to an union of more than one office in a single magistrate, it is laid down that in large states such an arrangement is not proper, but necessary in a small one.
Different magistracies are necessary in different govern­ ments.
Magistrates to inspect the behaviour of the youths and of the women.
CHAP.
XVI.
—As to the judicial department, there are eight different courts and tribunals.
Courts for civil matters.
Different modes of electing judges.
What method suits a democracy, oligarchy, or aristocracy.
INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book, (which, together with the fol­ lowing one, Gillies regards as supplemental to the rest, and therefore places last in order, as Books VII. and VIII.,) contains two parts:
(1.) Chap. i—iv.
On the causes of the preservation and overthrow of democratic states;
(2.) Chap. v.—xii.
On those of a monarchy or tyranny.
CHAP.
I.—The origin of all sedition lies in false views of equality.
Persons are apt to think that because they are equal in one point, they are equal in all.
And hence they desire complete equality.
Others, of higher rank, desire not equality, but superiority.
How changes of governments take place.(1.) When their form is changed into another.(2.) When the form remains, but the ruling body is changed.(3.)
When the form and the ruling body remaining, the government departs from its own theory, or carries out its own principles to a further length.
Democracy and oligarchy are practically the most com­ mon forms of government.
Governments generally fail through being based on a wrong principle at first.
An oligarchy is less safe than a democracy, because com­ posed of a larger number of individuals of the middle class.
CHAP.
II.
—The first cause of sedition is a false idea of equality, (see chap. i.,) when citizens forget that equality is not ab­ solute, but relative.
Another is the desire of gain and honours, with fear of their opposites.
Several other causes enumerated.
CHAP.
III.
—Further exposition of the eleven causes of se­ dition mentioned in the preceding chapter, illustrated by examples.
Origin of ostracism.
Difference of race, or of site, or of merit, tends to sedition.
Historical examples of seditions.
CHAP.
IV.
—Republics are sometimes disturbed by seditions on trifling matters ;
e. g. by love affairs.
Dissensions are the bane of all states.
The state suffers perversion by changes of party or of ranks in the state.
Two special methods of overthrowing a state ;
treachery and violence.
Different kinds under each method.
CHAP.
V.—Thus far as to the overthrow of governments in general:
now of particular kinds.
As to a democracy, it is overthrown by the petulance of mob orators.
It generally becomes changed into a tyranny, or an olig­ archy, or some better or worse form of democracy.
CHAP.
VI.
—As to an oligarchy;
it is overthrown by two especial causes:
Either by the violence of the nobles towards the lower orders;
orBy the internal dissensions of its rulers.
CHAP.
VII.
—An aristocracy is subverted by several causes.
By reason of the fewness of those who share in honours.
Through the nobles being partly rich and partly poor.
If one of the nobles is too pre-eminent;
for so he comes to aim at a tyranny.
Through a transgression of justice.
This cause is com­ mon also to a polity;
and it arises in either case from the fact that the constituent parts of each are not well blended together.
All states are mostly changed into that form towards which they naturally incline.
Sometimes, however, it is otherwise ;
e. g. an aristocracy changes into a democracy, when the popular party are not content with having crushed the nobles, but take the entire government into their own hands.
The same happens not only by internal causes, but also by the operation of external causes;
as through the prox­ imity of a hostile state, or the plots of a powerful enemy though distant.
CHAP.
VIII.
—The causes of a state's preservation.
The exact observance of the laws, and precautions against innovations.
The prudent conduct of the magistrates towards their subjects.
The vigilance and concord of the rulers.
The settlement of differences by a legislator, and not by chance hands.
A fair and equitable census.
Precaution against allow­ ing any individual to grow too powerful.
The creation of a magistrate to see that the citizens con­ duct themselves aright towards the state.
Care to keep the various parts of the state in due pro­ portion.
The prevention of persons from making a gain or traffic of government.
The good treatment of the ruled by their rulers.
Due regulation of property bequeathed.
If some advantages are bestowed on those who are not in office.
CHAP.
IX.
—The rulers in a state should be patriots, skilled in their duties, and virtuous.
To preserve states which are themselves deflexions, me­ diocrity must be observed, c. g. Into a democracy some anti-democratic principle should be infused.
Danger of an unmixed oligarchy and democracy.
In a democracy the demagogues should favour the power­ ful ;
the opposite in an oligarchy.
In every state, whether oligarchic or democratic, the citizens should be educated and trained in a matter suited to it.
CHAP.
X.—Monarchy, and the causes of its destruction.
Monarchies reduced to two kinds :
monarchy proper, and tyranny.
The same causes tend to overthrow a monarchy as other states ;
for a monarchy follows the form of an aristocracy, a tyranny that of an oligarchy.
Hence tyranny is the worst of all bad forms of govern­ ment.
Monarchy and tyranny have a different origin;
a king is chosen from the good, for protection ;
a tyrant from the commons, for oppression.
A tyranny and a monarchy are different in their ends, objects, and circumstances.
A tyranny and an oligarchy have in common the pursuit of riches.
A tyranny and a democracy have in common their hatred towards the chiefs and leaders of the state.
The same things as those above related are the causes of the overthrow and preservation of monarchies.
(See above, chap. ii. and iii.)To the above causes we may add φιλοτιμία, or ambition.
The external and internal causes of the overthrow of tyrannies and of monarchies are different.
The causes which tend to overthrow tyrannies are the same as those which subvert extreme oligarchies and demo­ cracies.
Monarchies are seldom destroyed by external causes, but by two internal ones;
viz. discord between the heirs to a throne, and the assumption of illegal powers.
CHAP.
XI.
—The means of preserving monarchies are the con­ traries to the means of their overthrow.
The first cause of preservation is due moderation.
A tyranny may be preserved by great cruelty, or by great indulgence.
(The object of a tyranny is to corrupt its subjects, and to cause them to distrust each other.)
A monarchy is rule over a willing, tyranny over an un­ unwilling, people.
A tyranny, in order to be stable, should assume, as far as possible, the appearance of a monarchy.
It should pretend to affability, moderation, and a regard for religion and virtue.
A tyrant should try to be neither exactly good nor bad, but ἡμιπονηϱὸς καὶ ἡμιχϱηστός, half good and half wicked.
CHAP.
XII.
—Of all forms of government, oligarchy and tyranny are the least stable.
Reason why such is the case.
Censure of the errors of Plato concerning the changes to which states are subject.
First, Plato assigns as a cause the general flux in which all things are, and explains the reason by his theory of harmonic numbers.
But numbers cannot be causes of such changes.
Some are by nature so bad that they cannot be made good by any means.
Secondly, Plato asserts that these changes take place in a fixed order and method ;
but states do not always change into the same kind of forms.
Thirdly,
He has laid down nothing concerning tyranny.
Fourthly,
He has made oligarchy not one form of govern­ ment, but two.
Lastly,
He asserts that an oligarchy always changes into a democracy.
INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book comprises three parts ;
(1.) Chap. i. Explanation of the method and matter contained. (2.) Chap. ii.—vi.
Further dissertations on democracy and oligarchy, which is a kind of appendix to Book IV. (3.) Chap. vii. viii.
Treating of the various kinds of magistrates.
CHAP.
I.—A brief repetition of what has been already laid down in books IV.
and V., concerning the senate, the ma­ gistrates, and the judicial body, as also concerning the cor­ ruption and preservation of states.
The union and fusion of the democratic and oligarchic forms of government.
Democracies are of various kinds-reasons why such is the case.
CHAP.
II.
—Liberty the end of democracy.
Two notes of liberty:
first, a share of governing and be­ ing governed alternately.
Second, the right of living at will.
Hence these two things are the concomitants of demo­ cracy.
The institutions of a democracy are,(1.) The election of magistrates from the whole body of citizens.(2.) That all shall have power over each and each over all(3.
The election of magistrates by lot.(4.) The absence of a fixed census as a qualification for office.(5.) That no office be held twice, (6.) nor for a perma­ nency.(7.) That all shall have the right of judging over all causes.(8.) The supremacy of the ecclesia, or popular assembly, over the βουλὴ, or senate.(9.)
Pay to be given to certain magistrates.
The βουλὴ will have greater power when no pay is offered to the people for their attendance in the ecclesia, or in the courts of justice.
CHAP.
III.
—The rights of the people in a democracy.
Is the decision of the majority, or of the leaders, or of the wealthy few, to be binding ?
That which is affirmed by the majority of both rich and poor should be deemed binding.
One rich man's vote should be equal to that of two poor men.
If the votes are equal, the matter must be decided by lot, or by some other way.
CHAP.
IV.
—Of the four kinds of democracies, the earliest or agricultural kind is the best.
The people should have conceded to them the right of electing their magistrates and of calling them to account.
It is bad to exclude any section of the community from office, as such a proceeding tends to foster seditions.
The best method of appointing and regulating the magis­ trates.
Agrarian regulations-share of land held by each person to be limited by law.
Of the other kinds, that which is composed of shepherds is best.
Other kinds of democracies-the last and worst-the reason why it is not apt to be permanent.
A democracy should be strengthened by taking care that the plebs out-number the rest;
by an increase in the tribes;
by confiscating private sacred rights ;
by a general fusion of all ranks and classes ;
and by giving general licence to in­ dulgence.
CHAP.
V.—Care to be taken not only in appointing, but also in preserving a state.
The property of the citizens not to be confiscated, but to be consecrated.
Trials to be as few as possible-so also meetings of the popular assembly.
The people not to be suffered to sink too deeply into poverty.
Five means of preserving the people from poverty enu­ merated.
CHAP.
VI.
—As to an oligarchy, the means of preserving it are to be inferred from what has been said upon the subject of democracy.
In the best and purest oligarchy, the highest magistracies should be given to those who have the highest census, the lesser to those who are poorer.
It is for the interest of an oligarchy to confer some lesser offices on men of slender means.
In the second kind of oligarchy a higher census is to be required, so that fewer persons may be in office.
The third and worst kind is most tyrannical, and requires the greatest attention.
A large number of citizens suits a democracy, a smaller number, if well ordered, suits an oligarchy.
CHAP.
VII.
—The commonalty divided into four classes suited to a peaceable life, and four warlike classes.
The worst kind of oligarchy will arise where the land is suited to cavalry.
The middle kind of oligarchy, where the land is suited to foot-soldiers.
Light-armed troops and seamen suit a democracy.
Light-armed troops to be mixed with the hoplites and cavalry.
Circumstances under which the plebeians in an oligarchy may be chosen for office.
The duty of rulers in oligarchies to give sumptuous " liturgies."CHAP.
VIII.
—Magistrates, civil, religious, and extraordinary.
What civil magistrates are indispensable to the existence of a state.
Six different offices enumerated.
Some other magistrates of a higher order enumerated.
Religious magistrates-priests.
Extraordinary magistrates—officers to superintend the women and children-the theatres and games—Nomo­ phylaces.
What magistrates are suited to each respective form of government.
INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book contains three parts. (1.) Chap. i.—iv.
Prefatory-concerning the best state and the best life. (2.) Chap. v.—xiii., containing certain principles as to the theoretic construction of a state. (3.) Chap. xiv.— xvii., in which Aristotle commences the practical considera­ tion of the education, training, matrimony, etc., of the citizens of the best state, which he continues throughout the next book, to the end of his treatise, at least as it exists in its pre­ sent state.
CHAP.
I.—The politician should have clear views of the best life, for this and the best form of government cannot be disjoined.
The happiest life is that which is based on virtue;
and our happiness is proportioned to our virtue.
That a life of virtue is best for a state, may be proved by the same arguments which prove it to be the best for individuals.
External goods come in as auxiliaries (χοϱηγία).
CHAP.
II.
—The chief good of the state is identical with that of the individual;
viz. happiness.
Those therefore who regard happiness as consisting in riches, make riches the end of a state;
and so forth.
So also with reference to virtue.
Two questions proposed:
first, Whether the philoso­ phical or political life is superior ?
Secondly, What is the best form of government ?
That is to be regarded as the best government, in which a man can live the best.
But as to the former question, a dispute is raised.
Some propose dominion over neighbours, as the end of states, and estimate virtue by warlike prowess.
Reasons why the latter end cannot be right, and why such a state cannot be perfect or happy.
War not to be regarded as an end, but as a means.
The duty of a politician is to consider the true interest and happiness of the citizens.
CHAP.
III.
—Is the political or contemplative life to be pre­ ferred ?
Reasons for preferring the latter—“the life of a citizen is servile.
"
Reasons for entertaining the contrary opinion—“ the contemplative life is indolent, and works no good.
"Aristotle answers that not all obedience to government is servile.
Reasons for preferring upon the whole the political and practical life.
Mistake of politicians as to the practical life.
There are higher kinds of actions even than the carrying out of the details of government.
Philosophers, in consulting and advising, follow this higher line of action.
Character of the actions of God.CHAP.
IV.
—The best and most perfect form of government requires certain external conditions, e. g. population, a fit site, climate, etc.
Only things practicable are to be desired.
Hence Plato's errors.
The real power of the citizens not to be reckoned by their mere numbers;
the best city will be the greatest.
Slaves, and low mechanics, etc., are not parts of the state in reality.
Too large a population not to be regarded as a sign of strength:
it is not easily managed by the law.
States, like every thing besides, should have a certain definite size-the best size is one such as can be controlled by the laws, while it makes the state independent, and en­ ables the citizens to become known to each other.
CHAP.
V.—The site of the city should possess various advan­ tages.
It should be self-sufficient in productiveness:
Inaccessible to enemies ;
easy of access to its own mem­ bers :
Commodious for sea and land traffic.
CHAP.
VI.
—Commerce by sea profitable to the state.
Advantages and dangers arising from commerce.
Too large a force of sailors not to be maintained in the best state.
CHAP.
VII.
—The citizens of this state ought to be ingenious and brave.
The particular merits of the European and northern na­ tions ;
their bravery.
Character of the Asiatics ;
the reasons of it.
The middle position of Greece ;
its advantages.
Influence of climate on national temperament.
Civil war most deadly in its character and results.
CHAP.
VIII.
—Many things necessary to a state, but not parts of it;
e. g. food.
Things necessary for a state.
CHAP.
IX.
—In a democracy, different offices may be combined in one individual.
Illiberal arts and trades forbidden to the citizens of the best state.
Military power to be intrusted to the young ;
political to the elder.
Some amount of wealth necessary for the citizens.
The priestly order to be chosen from the upper ranks.
CHAP.
X.—Things invented at the earliest date are most ne­ cessary.
The land should be partly public and partly private;
and each of these divided again into two portions.
The tillers of the land should be a servile race.
CHAP.
XI.
—In choosing a site, regard should be had to health, to security from attack, to a good supply of water, etc.
A lofty acropolis suits a monarchy or oligarchy;
a level plain suits a democracy;
a quantity of strong places suits an aristocracy.
Private houses how to be arranged.
CHAP.
XII.
—The public tables to be held on the ramparts.
Temples of the gods to be set apart from profane uses.
The gymnasia;
the forum;
syssities of the priests and magistrates.
Regulations for the country districts.
Temples to be consecrated to the gods and heroes.
CHAP.
XIII.
—To be happy, one must choose a good end and good means.
All seek happiness ;
but the good need fewer things than the bad in order to attain to it.
The test of a good state is the goodness of its citizens;
and men become good by nature, by habit, and by reason.
CHAP.
XIV.—Internal discipline.
Interchange of govern­ ment requisite, except where a person of heroic virtue is found.
Obedience the best stepping-stone towards command.
War to be sought for the sake of peace.
Hence the error of the Spartan constitution.
CHAP.
XV.—Philosophy more necessary in the time of peace.
Moral virtues required both in peace and in war.
The body to be taken care of before the soul in order of time ;
but only for the sake of the soul.
The passions to be disciplined for the sake of the in­ tellect.
CHAP.
XVI.
—The legislator should regulate the marriage of the citizens.
Age for marriage-time of year-state of health.
Abortion allowed as a check to population.
CHAP.
XVII.
—Early rearing of children-diet-manner of life.
Amusements-exercise-fables and stories.
Periods of life for a change in education;
at seven;
at fourteen ;
and at twenty-one.
Manhood.
INTRODUCTORY.—CONTAINS seven chapters, all on the in­ struction of the young;
comprising gymnastics, grammar, painting, and music.
The book, as well as the entire treatise, has come down to us in a mutilated form.
See observations above, p. xvii.CHAP.
I.—The legislator ought to take cognizance of the edu­ cation of the youth ;
this proved by expediency.
All education should be directed by the same pattern and to the same end.
And, as the part exists for the sake of the whole, this end should be the good of the state.
CHAP.
II.
—Children first to be taught such useful arts as are not illiberal and mean.
It is not illiberal to study the liberal arts to a certain point;
but they should not be studied to excess.
1To study them for their own sake, or for one's own sake, or for that of one's friends, is not illiberal, but to do so for money is mercenary.
CHAP, III,—The arts to be learned by youths are, (1.) Gram­ mar and painting.(2.) Gymnastics.(3.)
Music for recreation, rather than as a mere diversion.
Youths to be handed over when young to the wrestler and trainer.
CHAP.
IV.
—Gymnastics not to be enforced so far as to injure health, and so defeat their end.
Mistake of the Spartans.
Bravery not so often to be found in fierce as in gentler creatures.
The same true of men.
After the fourteenth year, should follow a space of three years spent in harder exercises.
The body and the mind not to be severely exercised at once.
CHAP.
V.—On what account should music be cultivated ?
For recreation, and for moral improvement.
The moral effects of music.
Moral effects produced by some paintings.
The Doric and Phrygian harmonies;
their opposite effects.
The Pythagorean and Platonic schools identify the soul with harmony.
1CHAP.
VI.
—Youths should learn music in order to practise it hereafter, as a source of amusement.
But not to an excess, nor on all instruments.
2CHAP.
VII.
—Three kinds of harmony:
the moral;
the prac­ tical ;
and the enthusiastic.
Various ends and objects of music :
purification of the affections.
(See Poetics.)
All harmonies to be used, but not in the same way.
The harmony to be suited to the hearer.
The Doric is of a moral kind, as between Lydian and Phrygian.
Different harmonies suit the old and the young.
3PREFATORY REMARKS.
—Like " Politics,” it is to be ob served that the term " Economics," in the language of ancient Greek philosophy, had a much wider signification than it now bears with us.
It is almost superfluous to remark that, in the language of Aristotle, it signifies the science or art (for it is both) of managing and providing for the well-being of a fa­ mily, (οἶκος,) the first natural combination to which man'a social nature disposes him.
See Politics, Book I. chaps, i. ii. viii. and xiii.
If the Politics of Aristotle have come down to us in an imperfect state, much more is this the case with his Eco­ nomics, which only just introduce the subject of domestic rule.
The relation in which the Economics stand to the whole sys­ tem of Aristotle's moral philosophy, as holding a middle post between his Ethics and Politics, has been already sufficiently touched upon in the introductory note, prefixed above, to the first book of the Politics (page xvii.).
It only remains for the editor to add, that while some critics have gone so far as to doubt the genuineness of the first book of the Economics, a much greater suspicion, in the opinion of all, hangs over the second book ;
and that it existed for many ages only in a Latin version, from which it was translated back again into Greek by Aretinus or Tusanus.
Sylburgius regards the whole of the second book as spurious, and in fact believes the chap­ ters of which it consists to have been "supposita ab Aretino, non conversa."
However, he follows Camerarius in admitting what is generally known as the first chapter, as standing on a somewhat different footing from the rest, and accordingly he prints it as belonging to Book I.
It should be observed, how­ ever, that Plutarch, in his Life of Aristotle, expressly attributes to Aristotle two books on the subject of the economic art.
We have, therefore, given the whole of the so-called second book in this edition ;
the translation of it is entirely original.
and it is believed that no attempt has hitherto been made to present the reader with an English version.

POLITICS, or the political science, (as has been observed in the Ana­ lytical Introduction to the Ethics,) was understood by Aristotle, and indeed by all the ancient philosophers, not in the narrow and restricted sense to which modern ideas have confined it, but as a science investi­ gating the subject of human good and the nature of man, not merely as an individual, but as a member of the family and of the state.
Hence it naturally divides itself into three corresponding parts ;
Ethics, which treat of man's nature and good, apart from the social relations;
and Economics and Politics, which view him under the social relations of the family (οἶκος) and the state (πόλις) respectively.
Occasionally, however, the word πολιτική is used in a wider, as well as in its nar­ rower, sense, both as embracing the two other branches, and as ex­ clusive of them.
In the last chapter of the Nicomachean Ethics, where Arist.
speaks of education, and shows that it is the duty of every state to educate its members, and that the study of legislation is necessary in order to qualify persons to undertake the education of others, he expresses his intention to write at length upon the subject of poli­ tics ;
and in the last words of the chapter, he even goes so far as to sketch out the three divisions of the present treatise, thus:
" Since ... all former authors have passed over without examination the subject of legis­ lation, it would be better perhaps for us to examine it ourselves, and, in short, the whole subject of politics, in order that the philosophy of human nature may, as far as in our power, be completed ......
Let us then make a commencement." (Eth. x. ch. 9.) The present treatise is that to which he here refers;
and it is divisible into three general parts, (1.) B. i. and ii. (2.) B. iii.—vi. (3.) B. vii. and viii.
The following table of the division of Philosophy in general, according to the Stoic and the Peripatetic schools respectively, will be useful.
It may be observed in passing that Cicero mainly follows the former of these di­ visions, Aristotle the latter.
All states aim at some good, and the highest at the highest good.
As we see that every state is a society, and that every society is established for the sake of some good end ;
1 (for an apparent good is the spring of all human actions;
) it is evident that all societies aim at some good or other :
and this is more especially true of that which aims at the highest possible end, and is itself the most excellent, and embraces all the rest.
2
Now this is that which is called a state, and forms a political Errors of for­ mer political writers.
society.
For those are greatly at fault, who think that the principles of a political, a regal, a domes­ tic, and a despotic government are the same;
in­ asmuch as they suppose that each of these differ merely in point of number, and not in kind:
so that with them a despotic government is one composed of a very few, a domes­ tic of more, a civil and a regal of still more, as if there were no difference between a large family and a small city;
and they hold that a regal and political government are the same things ;
only that in the one, a single person is continually at the head of affairs, while in the other, each individual in his turn becomes a magistrate and again a private person, ac­ cording to the rules of political science.
Now this is not true;
and what we say will be evident to any one who will consider this question after the approved method.
For as, in every other subject, it is necessary to se­ parate its component nature, till we arrive at its first elements,l which are the most minute parts thereof;
so by viewing the first elements of which A state or com­ munity to be considered first in its compo­ nent parts.
a state2 is composed, we shall see wherein states differ from each other, and whether it is possible to arrive at any sys­ tematic knowledge concerning each of the points above mentioned.
A state viewed in its begin­ nings.
Necessary re­ lations of (1.) man and wife, (2.) master and slave.
Now if any one would watch the parts of a state from the very first as they rise into existence, as in other matters, so here he would gain the truest view of the subject.
1
In the first place, then, it is requisite that those should be joined together, which cannot exist without each other, as the male and che female, for the business of propagation;
and this not through deliberate choice, but by that natural impulse which acts both in plants and in animals, namely, the desire of leaving behind them others like themselves.
By nature too some beings command, and others obey, for the sake of mutual safety;
for a being endowed with discernment and forethought is by nature the superior and governor;
whereas he who is merely able to execute by bodily labour, is the in­ ferior and a natural slave ;
and hence the interest of master and slave is identical.
But there is a natural difference be­ tween the female and the slave;
for nature does nothing meanly, like artists who make the Delphic swords;
but she has one instrument for one end;
for thus her instruments are.
most likely to be brought to perfection, being made to con­ tribute to one end, and not to many.
Yet, among Barbarians, the female and the slave are upon a level in the community;
the reason for which is, that they are not fitted by nature to rule:
and so their relationship becomes merely that between slaves of different sexes.
For which reason the poets say, " Tis meet that barbarous tribes to Greeks should bow." as if a barbarian and a slave were by nature one and the same.
Now of these two societies the domestic tie is the first, and Hesiod 1 is right when he says, From these re lations arises first the family (οἰκος), then the village (κώμη), and lastly the state (πόλις). " First house, then wife, then oxen for the plough ;
" for the ox is to the poor man in the place of a household slave.
That society, then, which nature has estab­ lished for daily support, is a family (οἶκος), and those who compose it are called by Charondas An οἶκος de­ fined.
Ὁμοσίπυοι, 2 and by Epimenides the Cretan Ὁμόκαπνοι.
But the society of many families, which was instituted for lasting and mutual advantage, is called a village (κώμη), and a village is most naturally composed of the A κώμη defined.
emigrant members of one family, whom some persons call Ὁμογάλακτες, 3 the children and the children's children.
And hence, by the way, states were originally governed by kings, 4 as the Barbarians now are;
for they were composed of those who always were under kingly govern­ ment.
For every family is governed by the elder, Antiquity of regal govern­ ment, and its identity with paternal rule.
as are its branches, on account of their relation­ ship ;
and this is what Homer says, " Then each his wife and child doth rule" for in this scattered manner they formerly lived.
And the general opinion which makes the gods themselves subject to kingly government, arises from the fact that most men for­ merly were, and many are so now;
and as they hold the gods to be like themselves in form, so they suppose their manner A πόλις de­ fined.
of life must needs be the same.
But when many villages join themselves perfectly together into one society, that society is a state, (πόλις,) and contains in itself, if I may so speak, the perfection of inde­ pendence ;
and it is first founded that men may live, but continued that they may live happily.
2
For which reason every state is the work of nature,3 since the first social ties are such ;
for to this they all tend as to an end, and the nature of a thing is judged by its tendency.
For what every being is in its perfect state, that certainly is the nature of that being, whether it be a man, a horse, or a house ;
besides, its own final cause and its end must be the perfection of any thing;
but a government complete in itself constitutes a final cause and Man by nature social (πολπι­ κός).
Proof of this fact.
what is best.
Hence it is evident, that a state is one of the works of nature, and that man is na­ turally a political animal, and that whosoever is naturally, and not accidentally, unfit for society, must be either inferior or superior to man;
just as the person reviled in Homer, " No tribe, nor state, nor home hath he."
For he whose nature is such as this, must needs be a lover of strife, and as solitary as a bird of prey.
1
It is clear, then, that man is truly a more social animal than bees, or any of the herding cattle ;
for nature, as we say, does nothing in vain, and man is the only animal who has reason.
Speech indeed, as being the token of pleasure and pain, is imparted o other beings also, and thus far their nature extends ;
they can perceive pleasure and pain, and can impart these sensa­ tions to others;
but speech is given to us to express what is useful or hurtful to us, and also what is just and unjust;
for in this particular man differs from other animals, that he alone has a perception of good and evil, of justice and injustice, and it is the interchange of these common sentiments which forms a family and a city.
And further, in the order of nature, the state is prior to the family or the individual;
for the whole must necessarily be prior to the parts ;
for if you take away the whole body, you cannot say a foot or a hand remains, unless
The πολις prior in order of na­ ture to the οἰκος, and the latter to the individual.
by equivocation, as if any one should call a hand made of stone, a hand;
for such only can it have when mutilated.
But every thing is defined according to its effects and inherent powers, so that when these no longer remain such as they were, it cannot be said to be the same, but something of the same name.
It is plain, then, that the state is prior to the in­ dividual,2 for if an individual is not complete in himself, he bears the same relation to the state as other parts do to a whole;
but he that is incapable of society, or so complete in himself as not to want it, makes no part of a state, but is either a beast or a god.
There is No condition short of the πολις inde­ pendent.

benefit;
for as man, thus perfected, is the most excellent of all living beings, so without law and justice he would be the worst of all;
1 for nothing is so savage as injustice in arms ;
but man is born with a faculty of gaining himself arms by prudence and virtue;
arms which yet he may apply to the most opposite purposes.
And hence he who is devoid of virtue will be the most wicked and cruel, the most lustful and gluttonous being imaginable.
Now justice is a social virtue;
for it is the rule of the social state, and the very criterion of what is right.
The component parts of an οἶκος.
BUT, since it is now evident of what parts the state is composed, it will be necessary to treat first of family government,2 for every state is made ap of families, and every family has again its separate parts of which it is composed ;
and when a family is complete, it consists of freemen and slaves.
But as in every .
subject we should first begin with examining into its component parts, and as the first and smallest parts of a family, are the master and slave, the I husband and wife, the father and child, let us first Three relations necessary in it, δεσποτική, γα­ μική-and τεκ­ νοποιητική.
inquire into these three relations, what each of them are, and what they ought to be ;
that is to say, the despotical, the conjugal, and thirdly the paternal;
though these two latter relations have no peculiar established name.
Let these then be considered as the three distinct parts of a family.
Now there is a duty which some identify with the government of a family, while others regard it as constituting its most import­ ant part;
I mean that of providing for its maintenance.
Now we must inquire philosophically how the matter stands.
But let us first speak of the master and the slave, that we may both understand what things are abso­ lutely necessary, and also try if we can get to learn

any thing better on this subject than what is already laid down.
Some persons have thought that the power of the master over his slave is a certain science, and'that the government of a family and a slave, political and regal government, are all the same Some say that slaves are such νόμψ but not φύσει.
things, just as we said at the beginning ;
but others think that despotic government is contrary to nature, and that it is cus­ tom only which makes one man a slave and another free, but that in nature there is no difference between them ;
for which reason that tie must be unjust, for it is founded in force.
1SINCE then a subsistence is implied in every family, the means of procuring it certainly makes up part of the management of a family, for without necessaries it is impossible to live, and to live well.
And as in all arts which have a definite Every art end, they must needs have their proper instru- needs instru- ments and slaves are in­ struments in ὀικονομική.
ments if they would perfect their works, so is it in the art of managing a family.
Now of instru­ ments some are alive, others inanimate ;
thus with respect to the pilot of a ship, the tiller is without life, the sailor is a live instrument ;
and so too a servant is as an in­ strument in many arts.
Thus property is as an instrument to living ;
and an estate is a multitude of instruments ;
so a slave is a living instrument, and every servant is an instru­ ment more valuable than any other instrument.
For if every instrument, at command, or from foreknowledge of its mas­ ter's will, could accomplish its special work, (as the story goes of the statues of Dædalus,1 or what the poet tells us of the tripods of Vulcan, how " Self-taught they moved into the godlike course;
”)2 if the shuttle thus would weave, and the lyre play of itself;
then neither would the architect want servants, nor the master slaves.
Now what are generally called instruments, are the efficients of something else, but possessions are what we simply use :
thus with a shuttle we make something else over and above its mere use ;
but we only use a cloak, or a bed :
since then making and using differ from each other in kind, and they each require their own instruments, the latter also must be different from each other.
Now life is a thing which we use, and not an efficient of something else ;
and hence the slave is a minister in matters of daily use.
But a possession
The slave is merely a part of the master.
may be considered as a part of any thing ;
now a part is not only a part, but also wholly the pro­ perty, of something else ;
and the same is true of a possession;
therefore, while a master is only a master of the slave, but no part of him, the slave is not only the slave of the master, but also wholly his property.
This fully ex­ plains what is the nature of a slave, and what is his capacity;
for that being, who by nature is not his own, but totally an­ other's, and yet is a man, is a slave by nature;
and that man is the property of another, who is his mere chattel, though he is still a man;
but a chattel is an instrument for use, separate from the body.
3BUT whether any person of such a nature exists, and whether it is right and just for any one to be a slave or no,1 or whether all slavery is contrary to nature, must be considered hereafter.
Not that it is difficult to take a philosophic view of the matter, or to infer it from matters of fact;
for that some should govern and others be governed, is not only necessary but useful;
and from the hour of their birth, some are marked out for the purpose of obeying, and others for ruling.
There are, moreover, many species of both the governing
The considers tion of the jus­ tice of slavery postponed.
Slavery sup­ ported by ana­ logies drawn from the rela­ tion of the body to the soul, of the animal creation to man, and of the female to the male.
and the governed.
And the better those are who are go­ verned, the better also is the government, as for instance that of man, rather than of a brute :
for the more excellent the materials are with which the work is finished, the more ex­ cellent is the work;
and wherever there is a governor and a governed, there certainly is some work produced.
For what­ soever is composed of many parts, which together make up one whole, whether united or separate, evidently shows the marks of some one thing governing and another thing governed ;
and this is true of every living thing in all nature ;
nay, even in some things which partake not of life there is a principle of subjection, as in music ;
2 but this matter probably belongs to a disquisition somewhat foreign to our purpose.
Every living thing, in the first place, is composed of soul and body, and of these the one is by nature the governor, the other the go­ verned ;
now we must learn what is natural, by those things which are in accordance with nature, and not by those which are corrupted;
1 we should therefore examine into a man who Men born with different quali­ ties of body as well as of soul.
is most perfectly formed both in soul and body ;
for in him this fact is evident;
while in the depraved and vicious, the body would seem to rule rather than the soul, on account of their being corrupt and contrary to nature.
Even in an animal, then, as we affirm, it is possible to discern the despotic and political government;
for the soul governs the body as the master his slave ;
2 but the mind governs the appetite, with a political or kingly power;
which shows that it is both natural and advan­ tageous that the body should be governed by the soul, and the seat of the passions by the mind and that part which is possessed of reason ;
but equality of rule, or power inverted, is hurtful to all.
And this holds true not only of man, but of other animals also ;
for tame animals are naturally better than wild ones, and yet it is advantageous to all these that they should be subject to man ;
for thus they insure their own safety.
So too is it naturally with the male and the female;
the one is superior, the other inferior;
the one governs, the other is governed;
and the same rule must necessarily hold good with respect to all mankind.
Whoever, therefore, are as much inferior to their fellows as the body is to the soul, or the brutes to men,—(and this is in reality the case with all whose proper use is in their bodies, and whose highest excel- lence consists in this part,)—these, I say, are slaves by na­ ture, and it is advantageous to them to be always under this kind of government, inasmuch as it is advantageous to those above-mentioned.
He then is by nature formed a slave, who is fitted to become the chattel of another person, and on that account is so, and who has just reason enough to perceive that there is such a faculty (as reason), without being indued with the use of it.
For other animals have no perception of reason, but obey their passions ;
and indeed they vary very little in their use from each other.
For the advantage which we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arises from their administering to our bodily necessities.
Now it is the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemen different from each other, that the one should be robust for their necessary purposes, but the others erect;
useless indeed for such servile labours, but fit for civil life, which is divided into the duties of war and peace though the contrary often takes place, namely, that the one have the bodies, but the others have the souls, of free citizens.
For this at all events is evi­ dent, that if they excelled others as much as the statues of the gods excel the human form, every one would allow that the inferiors ought to be slaves to the others.
And since this is true with respect to the body, it is still more just to determine in the same manner, when we consider the soul;
though it is not so easy to perceive the beauty of the soul as it is of the body.
It is clear then that some men are free by nature, and others are slaves, and that in the case of the latter the lot of slavery is both advantageous and just.
2BUT it is not difficult to perceive that those who maintain the contrary opinion have some reason on their side ;
for slavery
To solve the question, slaves divided into two classes, the φύσει δου̃λος and the νόμψ δου̃λος. and a slave have each two different senses;
for there is such a being as a slave by custom;
and this custom is a certain compact, by which what­ soever is taken in battle, is said to be the property of the conqueror.
But many persons who are con­ versant in law call in question this right as they would an orator, and say that it would be hard that whoever is compelled by violence should become the slave and subject of another, who has the power to compel him, and is his su- Diversity of opinion on this point.
perior in strength;
and even of those who are wise, some think one way and some another on this subject;
but the source of this doubt, and that which makes this conflict of opinions, is the fact that ability when accompanied with proper means, in a certain way, is able to commit the greatest violence;
for victory is always owing to some superior advantage ;
so that it seems that violence does not prevail without ability;
and so the dispute is only concerning what is just.
For on this account some persons think that justice consists in benevolence, while others think it just that the superior should govern, since in the midst of these contrary opinions, the opposite argument has nothing weighty enough to persuade us that the superior on the score of ability ought not to rule and to govern.
1
But nevertheless, some persons, clinging, as they think, to a cer­ tain plea of right, (for custom is a kind of right,) insist that slavery in war is just, but at the same time they contradict themselves.
1
For it may happen that the principle upon which the wars were commenced is unjust;
and no one will say that the man who is undeservedly enslaved, is therefore a slave;
for if so, men of the noblest families might happen to be slaves and the descendants of slaves, if they chance to be taken prisoners in war, and sold.
And on this account they do not choose to give the name of slave to such persons, but only to barbarians.
But when they say this, they do nothing more than inquire who is a slave by nature, as we said at the first;
for we must acknowledge that some persons, wherever they may be, are of necessity slaves, but that Those who say it is unjust to make slaves in war, really im­ ply that some are φύσει δου̃λοι. others can in no case be slaves.
Thus also it is with those of noble descent;
it is not only in their own country, but every where, that men esteem them as such, while barbarians are respected on this account at home only;
as if nobility and freedom were of two sorts, the one universal, the other not so.
Thus says the Helen of Theodectes ;
"
Who dares reproach me with the name of slave ?
When from immortal gods, on either side, I draw my lineage.
"Those who express these sentiments show that they distinguish the slave and the freeman, the noble and the ignoble, from each other by no test

save that of their virtues and their vices;
for they think it reasonable, that as a man begets a man, and a beast a beast, so from a good man, a good man should be descended;
and this is what nature desires to bring about, but oftentimes can-Some then are born slaves, ethers free.
To the former slavery is ad­ vantageous ;
but the νόμψ δου̃λ

not accomplish it.
It is evident then that this doubt has no reason in it,1 and that some persons are slaves and others freemen by the appoint­ ment of nature;
and also that in some instances there are two distinct classes, for the one of whom it is expedient to be a slave, and for the other to be a master;
and that it is right and just that some should be governed, and that others should exercise that government for which they are fitted by nature ;
and if so, then the rule of master over slave (is just also).
But to govern ill is disadvantageous to both;
for the same thing is useful to the part and to the whole, to the body and to the soul;
but the slave is as it were a part of the master, as though he were an animated part of his body, though se­ parate.
For which reason a mutual utility and friendship may subsist between the master and the slave, I mean when they are placed by nature in that relation to each other;
for the contrary is the case with those who are reduced to slavery by custom, or by conquest.
IT is evident from what has been said, that a despotic and a political government are not the same;
and that all govern­ ments are not identical, as some affirm ;
for the one is adapted to the nature of freemen, and the other to that of slaves.
Domestic government is a monarchy, (for every house is ruled by one head,) but a political government is composed of free-

men and equals.
The master is not so called from knowing how to manage his slave, but be­ cause he is such;
and on the same principle the slave and the freeman respectively.
There would seem to be also one sort of knowledge'proper for a master, and another for a slave:
that of the slave is such as the slave taught at Syracuse;
for there a fellow at a stipulated sum instructed the boys in the routine business of a household slave.
And the learning of such matters as these would seem to be of wide extent, as the art of cookery, and other such like services;
of which some are allotted to some, and others to others;
some employments being more honourable, others more necessary;
according to the proverb, "Slave excels slave, and lord surpasses lord in such like services the knowledge of a slave consists.
The knowledge of the master, on the other hand, is the proper use of his slaves, for the office of a master lies in the employment, not in the mere possession of them.
Not that this knowledge contains any

thing great or lofty;
for what a slave ought to know how to do, that a master ought to know how to order.
For this reason, those who have it in their power to be free from such toilsome matters, employ a steward for this business, and apply themselves either to public affairs or philosophy.
[But the knowledge of procuring property1 is different from either of the above;
and this, in order to be just, must be either by war, or hunting.]
And let thus much suffice as to the distinction of a master and a slave.
BUT since a slave was laid down to be a part of property, let us make a general inquiry into the nature of property, and the acquisition of money, according to the manner we have proposed.
In the first place, then, some one may question whether the getting of money is the same thing as economics,2 or whether it is a part of it, Is χρηματιστική the same as οἰκονομική ?
or part of it?
or subservient to it?
or something subservient to it;
and if so, whether it is as the art of making shuttles is to the art of weaving, or as the art of making brass to that of statue- founding ;
for they are not subservient in the same way;
for the one supplies the tools, the other the matter;
and by the matter I mean, that out of which the work is finished ;
as, for instance, wool is the matter of the clothier, and brass of the sta-

tuary.
It is evident then that the getting of money is not the same thing as economy, for the business of the one is to furnish the means, of the other to use them.
For what art is there but economics, to make use Little matter whether we re­ gard it as a part or as sub­ ordinate.
of what is in the house ?
Still there is a doubt, whether this is a part of economics, or something of a different kind ;
for if it is the business of him who is to get money, to find out how riches and pos­ sessions may be procured, and if possessions and wealth embrace various parts, we must first ascertain whe­ ther the art of husbandry is a part of money-getting, or some­ thing different, and whether [the same is not true of] the care and acquisition of provisions in general.
But as there
The different lives of men.
are many sorts of provision, so is there a variety in the lives both of men and of the brute crea­ tion :
and as it is impossible to live without food, the difference in that particular makes the lives of animals so different from each other.
Now of beasts, some live in herds, others separate, as is most convenient for procuring them­ selves food;
as some of them live upon flesh, others on fruit, and others on whatsoever they light on, for nature has dis­ tinguished their course of life, so that they can with ease make choice of such things.
And as the same things are not agreeable to all, but one animal likes one thing and another another, the lives of carnivorous beasts must be different from the lives of those who live on fruits ;
and in like manner is it with men;
for their lives differ greatly from each other.
Now of these, the idlest is the nomad life ;
for their food comes from the flesh of tame animals, without any trouble, while they sit at ease;
and as their cattle of necessity keep changing their place on account of pasture, they too are compel­ led to follow with them, cultivating, as it were, a living farm.
Other men live by the chase, some hunting this thing, and others that;
some by free booting, and some by fishing ;
as for example, those who live near lakes and marshes, and rivers, or the sea itself ;
1 while others are fowlers, or hunters of wild beasts.
But the greater part of mankind live upon the produce of the earth, and its cultivated fruits.
Such, for the most part, are the lives of those who labour for their own subsistence, and without procuring their provision by way of exchange or merchandise ;
such are shepherds, husbandmen, freebooters, fishermen, and hunters:
some join different em­ ployments together, and thus live very agreeably, supplying those deficiencies which are wanting to make their mode of life independent.
Thus, for instance, some persons will join together the life of a nomad and a freebooter, or of a hus­ bandman and a hunter;
and so with respect to the rest, they pursue that mode of life to which necessity conspires to com­ pel them.
Now such a power of providing food seems to be taught to all animals by Nature herself, as well immediately upon their first birth, as also when they are arrived at maturity.
For with respect to the first of these periods, some of them, together with their young, produce nourishment which is sufficient until their new-born offspring can get food for itself;
as is the case- with those which are vermiparous and oviparous ;
and as to those which bring forth their young alive, they have within themselves the means for their subsistence for a certain time, namely, milk.
It is evident then that we may conclude2 that plants are created for the sake of animals, and all other animals for the sake of man ;
the tame for our use and provision ;
the wild, at least the greater part, for our provision also, or for some other advantage, as in order to furnish us with clothes, and the like purposes.
Since, therefore, Nature makes nothing either imperfect or in vain, it necessarily follows that she has made all these things for the sake of φήσει.
When war is man.
For this reason the art of war is, in some sense, a part of the art of acquisition ;
1 for hunting is a part of it, which it is necessary for us to employ against wild beasts, and against those of mankind who, being intended by nature for slavery, are unwilling to submit to it;
and on thisOne kind of κτητική, name­ ly, that which is περι τροφήν, is part of οικο­ νομ κή.
occasion, such a war is by nature just.
That species of acquisition, then, only which is accord­ ing to nature, is part of economy ;
and this ought to be at hand, or if not, it should be immediately procured, by those whose office it is to keep in store what is useful as well for the state community as for the πλου̃τος de­ fined.
family.
And true riches would seem to consist in these;
and the independent possession of those things which are necessary for a happy life is not infinite ;
though Solon speaks otherwise in this verse, " No bounds to riches can be fixed for man for a bound may be fixed here, as in all other arts ;
2 for the instruments of no art whatsoever are infinite, either in their number or their magnitude;
but riches are a number of in­ struments in domestic and civil economy.
It is therefore evi­ dent that there is a natural art of acquisition, both in domestic and civil economy, and for what reason.
χρηματιστική is a kind of κτη­ τική, and may be either φύσει or οὐ φύσει, just as all things have a natural THERE is also another kind of acquisition, which men specially call pecuniary, and with great jus­ tice too;
and by this indeed it seems that there are no bounds to riches and wealth.
Now many persons suppose, from their near relation to each other, that this is one and the same with the art just mentioned;
but it is not the same as that, and a second­ ary use.
though not very different;
for one of these is natural, the other is not, but rather arises from some art and skill.
Now let us enter on our inquiry into the subject from the following point
The uses of every possession are two, both indeed essential but not in the same manner;
for the one is strictly proper to the thing, the other not;
as a shoe, for instance, may be either worn or exchanged for something else;
for both these are uses of the shoe;
for he who exchanges a shoe with some man who wants one, for money, or provisions, uses the shoe as a shoe, but not according to its proper use;
for shoes are not made to be exchanged.
The same thing holds true of all other possessions;
for barter in general had its original beginning in nature, from the fact that some men had a surplus, and others less Barter (καπη­ λική) is a se­ condary use of property, and SO is οὐ φὐσει.
than was necessary for them.
And hence it is evident, that the selling provisions for money is not naturally a. part of pe­ cuniary science;
for men were obliged to use barter as far as would supply their wants.
Now it is plain that barter could have no place in the first community, that is to say, in the household;
but must have It could not exist in the οἶκος, and why.

for the former of these had all things the same and in common;
but those who came to be separated, had in common many other things1 which both parties were obliged to ex-

change as their wants arose.
And this custom of barter is still preserved amongst many barbarous nations, who exchange one necessary for another, but do nothing more ;
for example, giving and receiving wine for corn, and the like in other such things.
This sort of barter then is not contrary to nature, nor yet is it any species of money-getting ;
but it is necessary in order to complete that independence which is natural.
From this barter however arose the use of money, as might be expected;
for as the needful means for import­ ing what was wanted, or for exporting a surplus, From use of money arose καπηλική.
was often at a great distance, the use of money was of ne- cessity devised.
1
For it is not every thing which is naturally useful, that is easy of carriage;
and for this reason men in­ vented among themselves, by way of exchange, something which they should mutually give and take, and which being really valuable in itself, might easily be passed from hand to hand for the purposes of daily life, as iron and silver, or any thing else of the same nature.
This at first had a fixed standard simply according to its weight or size;
but in pro­ cess of time they put upon it a certain stamp, to save the trouble of weighing, and this stamp was affixed as a sign of its express value.
Money then being devised from the necessity of mutual interchange, the second species of money-getting arose, namely, by buying and selling ;
and this was conducted probably at first in a simple manner, but afterwards it came to True object of χρηματιστικἠ.
the supply of instruments, not of coin.
employ more skill and experience, as to where and how the greatest profit might be made.
For which reason the art of money-getting seems to be chiefly conversant about trade, and its end to be able to see where the greatest profit can be made ;
for it is the means of procuring abundance of wealth and possessions.
For men Money is not wealth.
oftentimes suppose wealth to consist in the quan­ tity of money which any one possesses, as this is that medium with which trading and trafficking are concerned:
3others again regard it as a mere trifle, as having no value by nature, but merely by arbitrary compact;
so that if those who use it should alter their sentiments, it would be worthless, and unserviceable for any necessary pur­ pose.
Thus oftentimes the man who abounds in money will want the necessary food;
and it is absurd to say that wealth is a thing of such a kind that a man with plenty of it around him may perish with hunger, like Midas in the fable, who from his insatiable wish found every thing set before him turned into gold.
For which reason people look about for something else by way of riches and property, and rightly too;
for the mere getting of money differs from natural wealth, and the latter is the true object of economy ;
while trade only procures money, not by all means, but by the exchange of it;
and it seems to be chiefly employed about trading, for money is the element and the regulator of trade;
nor are there any bounds to be set to the wealth which is thereby acquired.
For just as there are no limits to the art of medicine with respect to health, and as all other arts with respect to their ends are in­ finite 1-(for these ends they desire to effect to the furthest possible extent)—but still the means used for those ends are limited, and their several ends are the limits of each;
so too in the art of acquiring riches, its end has no limits, for its object is money and possessions ;
but economy has a boundary, though the former has not;
for acquiring riches is not its real end.
2And for this reason it should seem that some boundary should be set to riches, though in practice we see the contrary of this taking place ;
for all those who get riches add to their money without end.
The cause of this is the near connexion of these two arts with each other, for they sometimes change employment with each other, as getting of money is their common
The storing up money is at, κατα φυσίν. pursuit.
For they each employ the same thing, but not in the same manner;
for the end of the one is something beyond itself, but the end of the other is merely to increase it;
so that some persons are led to believe that this is the proper
In the above sense χρημα­ τιστική is a part of οἰκονομική.
object of economy, and think that for this purpose they ought to continue to save or to hoard up money without end.
And the reason of this dis­ position is that they are intent upon living, but not upon living well;
and this desire being boundless in its extent, the means which they employ for that purpose are boundless also.
And those who set themselves to live well, often confine their view to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures ;
so that as this also seems to depend upon what a man has, all their care is to get money, and hence arises the second species of money-getting;
for as their enjoyment is in excess, they seek means proportionate to supply this excess of enjoyment;
and if they cannot do this merely by the art of dealing in money, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all their powers to a purpose which is not according to nature.
Thus, for instance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, not to get money by;
neither is this the end of the soldier's or the physician's art, but victory and health respectively.
But such persons make every art subservient to money-getting, as if this was the only end, and to the end every thing ought to contribute.
We have now considered that art of money-getting which is not necessary, and have said what it is, and how we come to need it, and also that which is necessary, which is different from it;
for that economy which is natural, and whose object is to provide food, is not infinite like this, but has its bounds.
In another sense it is not a part of οἰκον­ ομική, but sub­ servient to it.
THAT which was doubted at the first, is now clear, as to whether the art of getting money is the business of the head of a family or a state, or whether it is not, and yet must of necessity exist;
for as the political science does not make men, but receiving them from the hand of nature employs them to proper purposes ;
thus nature, whether it be the earth, or sea, or any thing else, ought to supply them with provisions;
and this it is the business of the master of the family to manage properly.
For it is not the weaver's business to make yarn, but to use it, and to distinguish what is good and useful from what is bad and of no service:
and in like manner some one may inquire why money- getting should be a part of economy, when the For χρη̃σις presupposes κτἦσις.
art of healing is not;
since it is as requisite that the family should be in health as that they should eat, or have any thing else which is necessary.
Now, as it is indeed in some sense the business of both the master of the family and the ruler of a state to see after the health of those under their care, but in another sense not, but the physician's ;
so also as to money, in some respects it is the business of the master of the family, in others not, but of the servile art.
But as we have already said, it is chiefly the part of nature;
for it is her part to sup­ ply her offspring with food;
for nourishment is left for every thing born, by that which gave it birth;
and hence by the way, the natural riches of all men arise from fruits and from animals.
But since these riches may be applied, as we have said, to two purposes, the one to make money of, the other for the service of the house;
of these the first is necessary and commendable, the other, which has to do with traffic, is justly censured ;
1 for it has not its origin in nature, but amongst ourselves;
for usury is most reasonably detested, as the increase of our fortune arises from the money itself, and not by employing it Unnatural cha­ racter of usury (τοκισμός).
to the purpose for which it was intended.
For it was devised for the sake of exchange, but usury multiplies it.
And hence usury has received the name of τόκος, or "produce;
" for whatever is produced is itself like its parents ;
and usury is merely money born of money:
so that of all means of money- making, this is the most contrary to nature.
BUT since we have already sufficiently considered the matter in its general principles, let us now go into the practical part of it;
for the contemplation of such matters offers a liberal employment for the mind, but the application to practice isThe parts of ϰρηματιστικὴ κατὰ φὑσιν.
necessary.
But it is an useful part in the man­ agement of one's affairs, to be skilful in the nature of cattle, as to which are most profitable, and where, and how;
for instance, what is the advantage of rearing horses, or oxen, or sheep, or any other live stock.
It is also necessary to be acquainted with the comparative value of these things, and which of them are worth most in par­ ticular places;
for some do better in one place, and some in another.
Next, as to the pursuit of agriculture, and the man­ agement of arable grounds and orchards ;
1 and also as to the care of bees, and other living things, such as fish and birds, from whence any profit may arise.
These are the first and most considerable parts of domestic management:
but with respect to gaining money by exchange, the principal method is merchandise, which is carried on in' three different ways, The parts of ϰρηματιστικὴ μὴ κατα φὑσιν.
either by sea-trading, by warehousing, or by retail-dealing;
and these differ from each other in this, that some of them are more safe, while others bring in a larger return.
The second method is usury.
The third is the receipt of wages for work done, and this either by being employed in some illiberal art, or else in what is unscientific and serviceable merely to the An intermedi­ ate kind.
body.
There is also a third species of im­ proving a fortune, between this and the first;
for it has part in common with the natural method, and part with the system of exchange;
and it has to do with things that are immediately from the earth, or their produce, which, though they bear no fruit, are yet useful, such as the felling of timber, and the whole art of min­ ing :
but the latter includes many different species, for there are various sorts of things dug out of the earth.
Concerning each of these we have now spoken in general, but minute particulars concerning all of them, though useful for practical experiment, would be tiresome to dwell on.
Now of all the works of art, those are the most excellent wherein chance has the least to do ;
and those are the meanest in which the body is most Relative value of the various arts.
impaired, and those the most servile in which bodily strength alone is chiefly wanted, and those most illiberal which require least skill.
But as there are books written on these subjects by some persons, as by Chares the Parian, and Apollodorus the Lemnian, upon husbandry and planting, and likewise by others on other matters, let those who have occasion draw out a theory therefrom:
but every person should collect together whatsoever chances to be spoken at random, by means of which many who aimed at making a fortune have attained success, For all these are useful to those who set great store on money-getting ;
as was the money- getting contrivance of 1 Thales the Milesian, which men attributed to him on account of his A practical knowledge of them useful to the οἰκονὁμος, and why.
wisdom, though it is one of general application.
For when they reviled him for his poverty, as if the study of philosophy was useless, it is said that, while it was yet winter, he per­ ceived by his skill in astrology, that there would be great plenty of olives that year, and that having got a supply of money, he bought on a small security all the oil-presses that were in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low price, as there was no one to bid against him.
When the season came for making oil, many persons wanted them, and so all at once he let them upon terms he pleased ;
and raising a large sum of money by that means, he convinced them that it was easy for philosophers to be rich if they chose it, but that this was not what they aimed at ;
2 in this manner is Thales said to have shown his wisdom.
It indeed is, as we have said, generally lucrative, for a person to contrive to make a monopoly of any thing;
for which reason some cities also adopt this method when they want money, for they make a monopoly of their commodities.
There was, too, a certain person in Sicily who laid out a sum of money which was deposited in his hands in buying up all the iron from the iron works, so that after­ wards, when the dealers came from the markets to purchase, no one had any to sell but himself;
and though he put no great advance upon it, yet by laying out fifty talents he made an hundred.
When Dionysius heard this, he permitted him to take his money along with him, but forbade him to con­ tinue any longer in Syracuse, as being one who contrived means for getting money, inconsistent with his interests.
This man's foresight and that of Thales was exactly the same ;
for both of them contrived to procure a monopoly for themselves.
1The same knowledge useful in a higher degree to statesmen.
It is useful also for politicians definitely to under­ stand these things ;
for many states want to raise money and to employ such means, as well as pri­ vate families, nay more so;
for which reason, some persons employed in public affairs confine themselves to this province alone.
IT was laid down, then, that there are three parts of domestic government;
one, that of the master, of which we have already treated ;
another of the father, and a third that of the husband.
How a wife and a child are to be governed.
Now the government of the wife and children, should both be that of free persons, but not the same ;
for the wife should be treated as the member of a state, but the children should be under kingly rule ;
for the male is by nature made to rule over the female, except when something happens contrary to the usual course of nature;
as the elder and full-grown is superior to the younger and Difference of principle be­ tween πολιτικὴ and βασιλικὴ ἀρχή.
imperfect.
Now in the generality of free states, the governors and the governed alternately change place;
for an equality without any pre­ ference is what nature chooses;
however, when one governs and another is governed, she endeavours that a distinction shall be made between them, in forms, expressions, and honours;
according to what Amasis said of his laver.
2
This then should be the established rule between the male and the female.
The government of children should be kingly ;
for the power of the father over the child is founded on both affection and seniority ;
and this is a species of kingly government;
for which reason Homer very properly calls Jupiter “ Father of gods and men," as being the king of all of them.
For it is required that a king should be of the same species with those whom he governs, though naturally supe­ rior ;
as is the case between the elder and the younger, and between the father and the son.
IT is evident then that, in the due government of a family, greater attention should be paid to its several members than to the mere gaining of inan­ imate things;
and to the virtues of the former
The οἰκονομος must look to the virtue of his household.
rather than of the latter, (and this we term wealth;
) and greater regard to those of freemen than of slaves.
But here some one may question whether there is any other virtue in a slave than his mechanical ser­ vices, and of higher estimation than these, as tem-
Can a slave possess ἀρετή, beyond per­ formance of bo­ dily labour ?
perance, fortitude, justice, and other such like habits, or whether slaves possess none beyond mere bodily qualities.
Each side of the question has its difficulties ;
for if they possess these virtues, wherein will they differ from freemen ?
and since they are men, and partakers of reason, it is absurd to say that they do not.
Nay, nearly the same in­ quiry may be made concerning a woman, and a child, whether these also have their proper virtues, Can a wife or child?
whether a woman ought to be temperate, brave, and just, and whether a child can be unbridled and temperate or not;
1 and indeed this inquiry ought to be made in general, whether the virtues of those who by nature either govern or are governed, are the same, or different.
For if it is necessary that both of them should partake of noble charac­ ter, why is it necessary that the one should always
The question put in general.
govern, the other always be governed ?
Surely this difference cannot be merely one of degree;
for to govern, and to be governed, are things different in species, but more or less are not.
And yet it is strange that the one party ought to have them, and the other not;
for if he who is to govern shall not be temperate and just, how can he govern well ?
or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well ?
for he who is intemperate and a coward, will never do what he ought.
It is evident, then, that both parties ought to partake of virtue, but that there must be some difference of virtue between them, Different ἀρεταὶ of the ruler and the ruled.
as there is between those who by nature command and those who by nature obey.
This is sug­ gested by the soul;
for in this there is implanted by nature one part that rules and one that obeys ;
and the virtues of these we say are different, as are those of a rational and an irrational being.
It is plain then that the same prin­ ciple may be extended to the case of the others, so that there The α'ρεταὶ of each differ ac­ cording to their ἔργα.
is by nature a variety of things which govern and are governed.
Now a freeman governs his slave in one manner, the male governs the female in another, and in another manner the father go­ verns his child;
and all these have the different parts of the soul within them, but in a different manner.
Thus a slave can have no deliberative faculty,1 a woman but a weak one,2 a child an imperfect one.
Thus also must it necessarily be with respect to moral virtues ;
it must be supposed that all must possess them, though not in the same manner, but as is best
The ἂρχων must be per­ fect in ἠθικὴ ἀρετή. suited, to the several ends of each.
Hence, by the way, he who is to govern ought to be perfect in moral virtue,—(for his business is entirely that of a master artificer, and reason is the master arti­ ficer ;
)-while others want only that portion of it which may be sufficient for their station:
and hence it is evident, that although moral virtue is common to all those of whom we have spoken, yet the temperance of a man and of a woman are not the same, nor their courage, nor their justice, as Socrates thought;
3 for the courage of the man consists in commanding, the woman's in obedience.
And the same is true in all other particulars, and this will be evident to those who will examine the matter in detail;
for those who use general terms deceive themselves, when they say that virtue consists in a good dis­ position of mind, or in doing what is right, or something of this sort.
They do much better who enumerate the different virtues as Georgias did, than those who thus de­ fine them, and hence we ought to think of all per­ sons, as the poet says of a woman,The ἀρετη of the wife. "
Silence is woman's ornament," 1 but it is not the ornament of a man.
But as a child is incomplete, it is evident that his virtue is not to be referred to himself, but to the full-grown The ἀρετὴ of the child.
man, and to him whom he obeys.
In like manner, the virtue of a slave is to be referred to his master ;
for we laid it down as a maxim, that the use of a slave is to be employ­ ed in what is wanted ;
so that it is clear enough that but little virtue is required in him, only just The ἀρετὴ of the slave.
so much as that he may not neglect his work through intem­ perance or cowardice.
Here some person may question (supposing what I have said is true) whether virtue will not be necessary for artificers in their calling ;
for they often neglect their work through The apeTh of an artificer (τεχνίτης).
intemperance
But the difference between the two cases is very great;
for a slave partakes of animal life, but the arti­ ficer is something more than this;
2 as near therefore as the artificer approaches to the slave, just so much ought he to have of the virtues of one, for a mean artificer has a certain distinctive kind of slavery ;
but then a slave is one of those things which are by nature what they are, though this is not public of Plato, to the effect that women are equally fit with men to un­ dertake civil offices and duties.
See Plato Rep. b. ii. ch. 5, in.
Slaves must be trained to vir­ tue by their masters.
equally true of a shoemaker, or of any other artist.
1
It is evident then that a slave ought to be trained to such virtue by his master ;
and not in the way in which a master would teach him mere servile drudgery.
Those therefore are in the wrong who would de­ prive slaves of reason, and say that they have only to follow their orders, for slaves want more instruction than children ;
thus, then, let us determine as to this matter.
But it is ne­ cessary, in a treatise upon government, to enter particularly into the relations of husband and wife, and of parent and child, and to show what are the virtues of each and their respective connexions with each other, what is right and what is wrong;
and how they ought to follow the good, and avoid the evil.
We must seek the ἀρετή of the πόλις by train­ ing its indivi­ dual members well.
Since then every family is part of a state, and each of those individuals is part of a family, and the virtue of the parts ought to have regard to the virtue of the whole;
it is necessary to in­ struct both the wives and children of the commu­ nity, as to the nature thereof, inasmuch as it is of some conse­ quence to the virtue of the state that the wives and children therein should be virtuous.
And of consequence it necessarily is, for the wives compose one half of the free persons ;
and of the children the succeeding citizens are to be born.
As then we have determined these points, we will leave the rest to be considered in another place ;
and2 as if the subject was now finished, let us begin again anew, and first consider the senti­ ments of those who have treated of the most perfect form of government.
SINCE then we propose to inquire what civil society is of all others best 1 for those who have it in their power to live entirely as they wish, it is necessary to examine into the polities adopted inTo find what Is the best go­ vernment, let us examine existing forms.
those states which are allowed to be well governed, and in any others which may chance to have been described by writers, and appear properly regulated, in order that we may note what is right and useful in them.
And as to our seeking for something beyond these states, let it not be re­ garded as an affectation of wisdom ;
but let us have the credit of setting ourselves to this systematic work, because there are great defects in those which are already established.
And we must begin first with that part of the subject which na­ turally is the foundation of our discussion.
Now the members of every state must of necessity have all things in common, or nothing at all in common, or some things in common and not others.
To have nothing in common is evidently impossible, for the social state itself is a species of community;
and the first thing necessary is a common place of habitation, namely, the city;
this too must be one, and every citizen must have a share in this one state.
But in a state which is to be well governed, will it be best that all shall have a share in every thing which is capable of being shared, or only in some particulars, but not in others ?
for it is possible that the citizens may have their wives, and chil­ dren, and goods in common with each other, as in Plato's com­ monwealth ;
1 for in that, Socrates affirms that the children, the wives, and the possessions ought to be common.
Which then shall we prefer ?
the plan which is already established, or the custom which is proposed in Plato's commonwealth ?
Now a general community of wives is attended with many other difficulties ;
and among others, the object for which Socrates would have hisPlato's Repub­ lie.
Its merits canvassed.
government framed in this manner, does not seem to fol­ low from his reasoning :
again, it is not capable of producing that end which he says ought to be in the view of a state, as was but just now stated ;
nor has he given any particular directions as to how the arrangement ought to be made.
Now I also am willing to admit that the state ought to be one:
as much as possible, (for this is the principle which Socrates adopts :
)1 and yet it is evident that if it goes on till it becomes too much one, Is a perfect unity desirable­ or no ?
it will be no longer a state, for the state naturally sup­ poses a multitude ;
so that if we proceed in this manner, from a state it will become a family, and from a family it will be­ come an individual:
for we should say that a family is one­ to a greater degree than a state, and a single person than a. family ;
so that even if this end could be obtained, it should never be put in practice, as it would annihilate the state.
For not only does a state consist of a large number of inhabitants, but they must also be of different sorts :
for were they all alike there could be no state;
for a confederacy and a state 2 are two different things;
a confederacy is valuable for its numbers, though all those who compose it are men of the same calling ;
for this is entered into for the sake of mutual defence, just as the addition of another weight makes the scale go down.
The same distinction will prevail between a state and a tribe, when the people are not collected into separate villages, but live as the Arcadians.
Now those things by which a state should become one are of different sorts;
and it is the preserving a just and equal balance of power, which is the safety of states, as has already been mentioned in our treatise on Ethics.
1
Now among freemen and equals this is absolutely necessary ;
for all cannot govern at the same time, but either by the year, or There must be a distinction between the rulers and the ruled.
according to some other regulation or time.
By this means, it follows that every one in his turn will be in office;
as if the shoemakers and carpenters should exchange occupations, and not always be employed in the self-same calling.
But as it is better that these should continue in their respective trades, so also in civil society, where it is possible, it would be better that the government should continue in' the same hands ;
but where it is not—(as Nature has made all men equal, and therefore it is just, be the administration good or bad, that all should partake of it)—there it is best to observe a rotation, and let those who are their equals by turns submit to those who are magistrates at the time ;
3 since they in turn will alternately be governors and governed, as if they were different men ;
4 by the same method different persons will execute dif­ ferent offices.
From hence it is evident that a state cannot naturally be one in the manner that some persons propose;
and that what has been said to be the greatest good of states, is really their destruction ;
though the good of any thing tends to preserve it.
For another reason also it is clear, that it is not for the best to endeavour to make a state too much one, because a family is more 'sufficient in itself than a single person, and a Why a state ought not to be made too like an individual.
state than a family ;
1 and indeed it can lay claim to the name of a state only when this sufficiency results to the members of the community.
If then this sufficiency is preferable, a state which is less one, is better than that which is more nearly so.
BUT admitting that it is best for the state to be one as much as possible, it does not seem to be proved that this will take place on his theory, by permitting all at once to say " this is mine," andPlato's theory fails when applied to practice. " this is not mine," though this is what Socrates regards as a .
proof that a state has perfect unity.
For the word all is used in two senses;
if it means each individual, what Socrates proposes will more nearly take place;
for each person will say, this is his own son, and his own wife, and his own pro­ perty, and of every thing else that may happen to belong to him, that it is his own.
But now those who have their wives and children in common will not say so, but all will say so, though not as individuals ;
and likewise with regard to property, all will say so, but not as.
individuals;
therefore, this use of the word " all," is evidently a fallacious mode of speech ;
2 for the words " all " and “ both " are odd and even, and are some­ times used distributively, and sometimes collectively, on ac­ count of their double meaning, and are the cause of contentious syllogisms in reasoning.
Therefore for all persons to say the same thing was their own, using the word "all" in its distribu­ tive sense, would be well, but is impossible:
while in its collec­ tive sense, it would by no means contribute to the concord of the state.
Besides, there is another harm attending this proposal;
for whatever is common to many is taken least care of;
for all men regard most what is their own, and care less for common property, or only just as much as concerns them.
For, be­ sides other considerations, every one is more negligent of what another has to see to ;
as in a family, one is often worse served by many servants, than by a few.
Now each citizen in the state will have a thousand children, but none of them will be as the children of any individual, but every child will be the son of every father, as chance may have it, and the parents all will alike neglect them.
Besides, in consequence of this, whenever any citizen fared well or ill, every person, be the number what it would, might say, "this is my son," or " that man's son ;
" and in this manner would they speak, and Further diffi­ culties ;

doubtingly withal, concerning each of the thou­ sand, or whatever number the city consisted of;
for it would be uncertain to whom each child be­ longed, and who should preserve- it when born.
Now which of the two do you think is better, for every one to say " this is mine," while they apply it equally to two thousand, or ten thousand ;
1 or, as we say " this is mine," under our present forms of government, where one man calls another his son, another calls that same person his brother, another nephew, or according to some other relationship, either by blood or marriage, and first extends his care to him and his, while another regards him as one of the same brotherhood and the same tribe ?
For sure it is better for any one to be a nephew in his private capacity, than a son after this manner.
Besides, it Difficulties arising from family like­ nesses.
will be impossible to prevent some persons from suspecting that they are brothers and children, or fathers and mothers, to each other;
for from the mutual likeness which exists between the parent and the offspring, they will necessarily obtain proofs of their mutual relationship.
This circumstance, we are informed by those writers who describe different parts of the world, does sometimes happen;
for some tribes of Upper Africa 1 have their wives in common, but yet their children are distin­ guished by their likeness to their parents.
There are also some women, and some other animals too, as mares and cows, which naturally bring forth their young very like the male ;
such was the mare called Dicæa, in Pharsalia.

namely, blows, murders, voluntary or in-And from mur­ ders, &c. voluntary, quarrels and reproaches ;
all of which it would be impious indeed to be guilty of towards our fathers and mothers, or those who are nearly related to us, as it is towards those who are not connected with us :
and certainly these mis­ chiefs must necessarily happen oftener among those who do not know each other, than among those who do ;
and when they do happen, among those who know their relations, they admit of a legal expiation, but in the latter case, this can­ not be done.

itself, or from those other embraces, which are of all things most improper, as between a father and a son, a brother and a brother;
for mere love in such cases is wrong.
It is also absurd to prevent sexual intercourse between relations, for no other reason than the violence of the pleasure, while the relation of father and daughter, or of brother and sister, is held to be of no consequence at all.
It seems also more ad­ vantageous, that the husbandmen1 should have their wives and children in common, than the military class, for there will be less affection in case of a community of wives, than other­ wise ;
for such persons ought to be under subjection, that they may obey the laws, and not seek after innovations.
Upon the whole, the consequences of such a law as this would be directly contrary to the state of things which good laws ought to establish, and to insure which Socrates thinks it right to lay down his regulations concerning women and Friendship better than unity.
children,
For we think that friendship is the greatest good which can happen to any state, as nothing so much prevents seditions:
and unity in a state is what Socrates commends above all things ;
and this appears to be, as indeed he says, the result of friendship ;
as we learn from Aristophanes in the Erotics,1 who says, that those who love one another from the excess of that passion, desire to coalesce, and from being two to be blended into one :
from whence it would necessarily follow, that both, or one of them, must be destroyed.
But now in a state, the tie of friendship must be extremely weak on account of this com­ munity, and neither parent nor child can point to his own re­ lative.
For as a very little of what is sweet, mixed with a great deal of water, makes the mixture scarcely perceptible, so must they necessarily disregard all family connexion arising from such names, in such a community;
for it is by no means necessary that a father should have any regard for a son, or a brother for his brother.
For there are two things which principally inspire mankind with care and affection, namely, the sense of what is one's own, and exclusive posses­ sion ;
2 neither of which can find a place in this sort of com­ munity.

for of necessity those who carry and transfer the children must know to whom they give each of them;
and by this means, those evils which we have already mentioned will .
necessarily be the more likely to happen, as blows, incestuous love, murders, and the like ;
for those who are transferred to other citizens, will no longer call the military caste by the name of brothers, sons, fathers, or mothers.
The same thing would happen to those born among the military who were trans­ ferred to the other citizens;
so that every one thus would be in fear how to act in consequence of consanguinity.
And thus let us determine concerning a community of wives and children.
Community of property.
WE proceed next to consider, as to property, in what way it should be regulated among those who are to live under a state formed after the most perfect mode of government, whether it should be common or not;
(for this may be considered as a separate question from what has been determined concerning wives and children ;
) I mean, whether it is better, (although these should be held separate, as is now the case every where,) that not only the possessions but also the produce of them should be in common ;
or that the soil should belong to a par­ ticular owner, but that its produce should be brought to­ gether and used as one common stock, as some nations at present do;
or, on the contrary, that the soil should be com­ mon and be cultivated in common, while the produce is divided amongst individuals for their special use, as is said t( be the practice among some of the barbarians;
or whether both the soil and the fruit should be in common ?
When
The difficulties involved in it.
the husbandman and the citizen are distinct, there is another and easier method ;
but when they each labour at their possessions for themselves, this may occasion several difficulties ;
for if there be not an equal proportion between their labour and what they consume, those who labour hard and have but a small proportion of the pro­ duce, will of necessity complain against those who take a large share and do but little labour.
Upon the whole, it is difficult to live together as a community, and thus to have all things that man can possess in common, and especially this is the case with respect to such property.
This is evident from the partnerships of those who go out to settle a colony;
for nearly all of them have disputes with each other upon the most common matters, and come to blows upon trifles:
we find too, that we oftenest disagree with those slaves who are gener­ ally employed in the common offices of a family.
A community of property then has these and other inconveniences attending it:
but the manner of life which is now established, more particularly when embellished with good morals and a system of upright laws, is far superior to it, for it will embrace the advantages of both ;
by " both" we mean, the advantage arising from properties being common, and from being divided also;
for in some respects it ought to be common, but upon the whole private.
For the fact that every man's attention is em­ ployed on his own particular concerns, will prevent mutual complaints;
and prosperity will increase as each person la­ bours to improve his own private property;
and it will then happen that, from a principle of virtue, they will perform good offices to each other, according to the proverb, " All things are common amongst friends."
And in some states there are traces of this custom to be seen,showing that it is not impracticable ;
and particularly in those which are best governed some things are in a manner common, and others might be so;
for there, while every person enjoys his own private property, he assists his friend with some things, and others he shares in common ;
as in Lacedæmon, where they use each other's slaves as if they were, so to speak, their own,1 and also their horses and dogs, or even any provision they may want in a journey.
It is evident then that it is best to have property private, but to make the use of it common ;
but how the citizens are to be brought to this mind, is the particular business of the legis­ lator to contrive.
And also with respect to pleasure, it is unspeakable how advantageous it is, that a man should think he has something of his own ;
for it is by no means to no purpose,l that each person has an affection for himself, for that is natural, and yet selfishness is justly censured ;
for we mean by that;
not that he loves himself, but that he loves himself more than he ought;
in like manner we blame a money- lover and yet all meq love both money and self.
Besides, it is very pleasant to oblige and assist our friends and companions, and strangers,2 which cannot be unless property be private;
but this cannot result

where they make the state too entirely one.
And further, they destroy the offices of two principal virtues, modesty and liber­ ality—modesty with respect to the female sex, for it is right to abstain from her who is another's;
and liberality, as it re­ lates to private property, without which no one can appear liberal, or do any generous action ;
for the office of liberality

consists in imparting to others what is our own.
This system of polity does indeed recommend it­ self by its good appearance, and specious presences to humanity ;
and the man who hears it proposed will receive it gladly, concluding that there will be a wonderful bond of friendship between all its members, particularly when any one censures the evils which are now to be found in society, as arising from property not being common ;
as for example, the disputes which happen between man and man, upon their con­ tracts with each other;
the judgments passed to punish per­ jury, and the flattering of the rich;
noneof which arise from properties being private, but from the corruption of man­ kind.
For we see those who live in one community and have all things in common, disputing with each other oftener than those who have their property separate;
but we observe fewer instances of strife, because of the very small number of those who have property in common, compared with those where it is appropriated.
It is also but right to mention not only the evils from which they who share property in common will be preserved, but also the advantages which they will lose ;
for viewed as a whole, this manner of life will be found Different kinds of unity.
impracticable.
We must suppose, then, that the error of Socrates arose from the fact that his first principle1 was false;
for we admit that both a family and a state ought to be one in some particulars, but not entirely so ;
for there is a point, beyond which if a state proceeds towards oneness, it will be no longer a state.
There is also another point at which it will still be a state, but in proportion as it approaches nearer to not being a state, it will be worse ;
2 as if one should reduce the voices of those who sing in concert to one, or a verse to a foot.
But as a state con­ tains a multitude, it ought to be brought to unity and com­ munity, as we have already said, by education;
just as pro­ perty at Lacedæmon and their- public tables in Crete were made common by their legislators.
But yet, as .
we said above, he must make a state one by, means of education;
and he who is about to in-
Moral unity to be produced by moral means troduce education,and who thinks thereby to make his state excellent, will be absurd if he expects to fashion it by the former means, and rather than manners, philosophy, and laws.
1
And the legislator ought to know that he should consult the experience of long time and.
of many years, which would plainly enough inform him whether such a scheme is useful:
for almost all things have already been found out;
but some have been neglected, and others, which men know, they do not put into practice.
But this would be most evident;
if any one could see such a form of government actually established :
for it would be impossible to frame such a state without dividing and separating it into its distinct parts, as public tables, wards, and tribes ;
so that here nothing further will be provided by the laws than to forbid the military to engage in agriculture, which is what the Lacedemonians are at present endeavouring to do.
And further, Socrates has not told us (nor is it easy to say) what plan of government should be pursued with respect to the individuals who share in a com­ munity of goods;
for the majority of his state will comprise a multitude of persons of different occupations;
but of these he has determined nothing ;
whether the property of the husband­ man ought to be in common, or whether each should have his share to himself;
as also, whether their wives and children ought to be in common or not.
For if all things are to be alike common to all, where will be the difference between them and the military, or what will they get by submitting to their government ?
and upon what principles would they thus submit, unless they should establish the wise practice of the Cretans, who allowed every thing else to their slaves, but forbade them only gymnastic exercises and the use of arms?
1
But if matters are to be with them as they are in other states, what will be their terms of intercourse ?
For in Absurdity of confining edu­ cation to the military.
one city there must of necessity arise two states, and those contrary to each other ;
for he makes the military to be the guardians of the state, and the husbandmen, artisans, and others he makes citizens;
and all those quarrels, accusations, and things of the like sort, which he says are the bane of other states, will be found in his also.
Notwithstanding, Socrates says that in consequence of their education they will not want many laws, but such only as may be necessary for regulating the streets, the markets, and the like;
while at the same time it is the military only to whom he has granted education.
Besides, he makes the husbandmen masters of property upon paying a tribute;
but this would be likely to make them far more troublesome and high-spirited than the Helots, the Penestæ, or other slaves.
Nor has he determined what is connected herewith, their polity, their education, and their laws :
be­ sides, it is of no little consequence, nor is it easy to determine, how these should be.
framed so as to preserve the community of the military.
Besides, if he makes the wives common while the property continues separate, who shall manage the domestic concerns with the same care which the man bestows upon his fields ?
Nor will it answer by making the property common as well as the wives:
and it is absurd to draw a comparison from the brute creation, and to say, that the same principle should regulate the connexion of a woman with a man, as prevails among brutes, amongst whom there are no family ties.
It is also very hazardous to settle the magistracy as Socrates has done ;
2 for he would have persons of the same rank always in office;
a thing which becomes a cause of sedition even amongst those who are of no account, but surely1 more particularly amongst men who are of a courageous and warlike disposition.
It is indeed evidently necessary that he should frame his community in this manner ;
for that golden particle which God has mixed up'in the soul of man, flies not from one to the other, but always continues with the same;
for he says,2 that some of our species have gold, and others silver, blended in their composition from the moment of their birth ;
but those who are to be husbandmen and artists have brass and iron.
The theory of Plato as to the three several ranks in his commonwealth Besides, though he deprives the military of happiness, he says, that the legislator ought to make the entire body of citizens happy ;
but it is impossible that the whole state can be happy, except all, or the greater part, or some part of it be happy.
For happiness is not the same as the property of even num­ ber, which belongs to two numbers added together, but to neither of them taken separately:
it cannot be thus with happiness.
And withal, if the military are not happy, who else are to be so?
for the artisans are not, nor the multitude of those who are employed in inferior offices.
The state, then, which Socrates has described, has all these defects, and others which are not of less consequence.
IT is also nearly the same in his treatise upon Laws,3 which was written afterwards ;
and hence, by the way, it will be proper in this place briefly Plato's " Laws " next examined.
Too many questions left undefined.
to consider the polity there described.
For So­ crates has thoroughly settled but very few parts of his polity;
as for instance, in what manner the community of wives and children ought to be regulated, and as to property, and to the manner of conducting the govern­ ment.
Now the whole amount of inhabitants are divided by him into two parts, the husbandmen and the soldiery ;
and from these he selects a third part, who are to be senators and to govern the state;
but he has not said whether or no the hus­ bandmen and artificers shall have any, and what, share in the government, or whether they shall have arms, and join with the others in war, or not.
He thinks also that the women ought to go with the men to war, and have the same edu­ cation as the soldiery;
and as to other particulars, he has filled his treatise with matter foreign to the purpose;
and with respect to education, he has only said what that of the soldiery ought to be..
As to his book of Laws, laws are the principal thing which that contains, for he has there said but little concerning government;
and though he desired to frame this government in states, on the principle of a more entire community, he bends it round again almost to his original form.
1 For,.
except the community of wives and goods, the rest he frames alike in both his governments :
for the education of the citizens is to be the same in both, in both are they to live without any servile employ, and their common tables2 are to be the same, excepting that in the one he says that the women also ought to have common tables, and that there should be a thousand men-at-arms, in the other that there should be five thousand.

All the discourses of Socrates,2 then, contain much which is highly wrought and ingenious, new and curious;
but it may probably be hard Character of the dialogues of Socrates.
to say that all their contents are true.
For now, with respect to the numbers just mentioned, it must not be concealed that he would want the country of Babylonia, or some other like it of immeasurable extent, to support five thousand idle per­ sons, besides another and much greater number of women and servants to attend them.
It is true that a man may sketch out an ideal state as he pleases, but yet it ought to be some­ thing possible.
It is said that when a legislator frames his laws, he should have two things in view, the country and the peopled

intercourse with them ;
for it is necessary that they should employ not only those weapons of war which are adapted to their own land, but those which suit foreign countries also;
for even granting that no one chooses this life either in public or private, yet, nevertheless, there is occasion for the people to be formidable to their enemies, not only when they invade their country, but also when they retire out of it.
It should also be considered, whether the quantity of property may not be settled in a different manner, and better too, by more clearly defining it;
for he says that it ought to be large enough for every one to live moderately, as if any one had said " enough to live well," which is the most vague expression.
Besides, a man may live moderately and miserably at the same time ;
he had therefore better have laid it down, that they should live both moderately and liberally ;
for unless these two con­ spire, luxury will follow on the one course, and wretchedness on the other;
since these two habits of living are the only ones which regard the employment of ouH' substance;
1 for it is not possible for a, man to be mild or, courageous in the use of his fortune ;
but he may be prudent and, liberal;
so that these uses are the only ones necessarily connected with pro- As to popula­ tion.
perty.
It is also absurd to render property equal, and not to provide for the number of the citi­ zens, but to leave the increase of population un­ certain ;
as if it would regulate itself according to the number of women who should happen to be childless, let that be what it may, because.
this seems now to take place in other states.
But the case of necessity would not happen with the same certainty in such a state which he proposes, as in those which now exist;
for in these no one actually wants, as the property is divided amongst the whole body, be its numbers what they will;
but as it could not then be divided, the supernumeraries, whether they are many or few, must needs have nothing at all.
But one would suppose that it is even more necessary than the regulation of property, to provide, as to the increase of numbers, that not more than a certain number should be­ come parents;
and to determine this number by calculating the chances of those children who will die, and of those women who will be barren ;
and to neglect2 this, as is done in several states, is to bring certain poverty on the citizens ;
and poverty is the cause of sedition and evil.
Now Pheidon the Corinthian, one of the oldest of legislators, thought that the families and number of citizens ought to continue the same;
although it should happen that all at the first have allotments dispro­ portionate to their numbers.
In Plato's Laws it is however different;
and we must mention hereafter1 what we think would be best in these particulars.
He has also neglected in this same book of Laws to point out how the governors are to be distinguished from Other omis­ sions.
the governed;
for he says, that as of one sort of wool the warp ought to be made, and of another the woof, so ought the governors to be in regard to those who are governed.
But since he admits 2 that all their property may be increased five­ fold, why should he not allow the same increase to the country to some extent ?
He ought also to consider whether his allot­ ment of houses will be useful to the community, for he has3 appointed two houses to each person, separate from each other ;
but it is inconvenient for a person to regulate two houses.
And his whole system of government claims to be neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but something between both, which is generally called a polity,4 for it is to be com­ posed of men-at-arms.
If Plato intended to frame a state, in which more than in any other every thing should be common, he has certainly given it a right name ;
but if he intended it to be the next in perfection to the best theoretic state,5 it is not so;
for perhaps some persons will give the preference to the Lacedæmonian form of government, or some other which may more nearly approximate to an aristocracy.
Now some per­ sons say, that the most perfect government should be one composed of all others blended together, for which reason they commend that of Lacedsemon ;
for some say, that this is composed of an oligarchy, a monarchy, and a democracy ;
their kings representing the monarchical part, their gerusia the oligarchical;
and that in the ephoralty may be found the de­ mocratical element, as they are taken from the body of the people.
But others assert, that the ephors have absolute power, and that it is their common meals and daily course of life, in which the democratic form is represented.
It is also said in this treatise of Laws, that the best form of government must be one composed of a democracy and a tyranny ;
though such a mixture no one would allow to be any government at all, or, if it is, the worst possible.
Those, on the other hand, propose what is much better, who blend many governments together;
for the most perfect is that which is formed of many Faults as to the composition and election of the ruling body.
parts.
But now this polity (of Plato's) shows no traces of a monarchy, but only of an oligarchy and democracy;
and it seems rather to incline towards an oligarchy, as is evident from the appoint­ ment of the magistrates;
for to choose them by lot, is common to both ;
but the fact that men of fortune must necessarily be members of the assembly, and elect the magistrates, and take part in the management of other public affairs, while the rest are passed over, this makes the state incline to an oligarchy;
as does the endeavouring that the greater part of the rich may be in office, and that the rank of their appointments may correspond with their fortunes.
The oligarchic principle prevails also in the choice of their senate;
the manner of electing which is favourable also to an oligarchy ;
for all are obliged to vote for senators out of the first class, afterwards for the same number out of the second, and then out of the third;
but this compulsory voting does not extend to all of the third and fourth classes, but only the first and second classes out of the entire four.
1
By this means, he says, he ought to show an equal number of each rank elected :
but he is mistaken ;
for the majority will always consist of the first rank, and the most considerable people;
and for this reason, that many of the commonalty, not being obliged to it,2 will not attend the elections.
From hence it is evident, that such a state will not consist of a democracy and a monarchy, as well as from what we shall say when we come particularly to con­ sider this form of government.
Danger also will arise from the manner of choosing the senate, when those who are elected themselves are afterwards to elect others;
for, if a certain number choose to combine together, though not very considerable, the election will always fall according to their pleasure.
Such are the points on which Plato touches, concerning his form of government, in his book of Laws.
THERE are also certain other forms of govern­ ment, which have been proposed, some by pri­ vate persons,3 and some by philosophers and Other ideal .
polities.
politicians, all of which eome much nearer than the above to those which have been really established, or now exist:
for no one else has introduced the innovation of a community of wives and children, and public tables for the women ;
but they have set out with establishing such points as are absolutely necessary.
There are some who think that the first object of government should be to regulate well every thing relating to property ;
for they say, that herein lies the source of all seditions whatsoever.
That of Phaleas.
His mode of equalizing property.
For this reason, Phaleas the Chalcedonian was the first who proposed this plan, that the fortunes of the citizens should be equal.
This he thought was not difficult to accomplish when a community was first settled, but that it was a work of much difficulty in states which had been long established ;
but yet that an equality might possibly be effected as follows :
name­ ly, that the rich should give marriage portions but never receive any, while the poor should always receive but never give them.
But Plato, in his treatise of Laws,1 thinks that a difference in circumstances should be permitted to a certain degree ;
but that no citizen should be allowed to possess more than five times as much as the lowest income,2 as we have already men­ tioned.
But one thing ought not to escape the notice of legis­ lators who would establish this principle, though now they are apt to overlook it;
that while they regulate the quantity of property belonging to each individual, they ought also to regulate the number of his.
children ;
for if the number of his family exceed the allotted quantity of property, the law must necessarily be repealed ;
and yet, apart from such a repeal, it will have the bad effect of reducing many from wealth to poverty ;
so difficult is it for innovators not to fall into such, mistakes.
That an equality of goods has some force to strengthen political society, seems to have been determined by some of the ancients ;
for Solon made a law to this effect;
and also among certain others there is a law restraining per­ sons from possessing as much land as they please.
And upon the same principle there are laws which forbid men to sell their property, (as among the Locrians,) unless they can prove that some notorious misfortune has befallen them.
They were also to preserve their ancient patrimony;
and this custom being broken through among the Leucadians, made their government too democratic;
for by that means it was no longer necessary to be possessed of a certain fortune, in order to step into the magistracy.
But it is possible that an equal­ ity of goods is established, and yet that this may be either too great, when it tends to luxurious living, or too little, when it obliges them to live hard.
Hence it is evident, that it is not enough for the legislator to establish an equality of cir­ cumstances, but he must aim at a proper medium.
Besides, if any one should so regulate property, as that there should be a moderate sufficiency for all, it would be of no use ;
for it is of more consequence that the citizens should entertain a simi­ larity of feelings than an equality of property ;
but this can never be, unless they are properly educated under the direction of the laws.
But probably Phaleas may say, that this is what he himself mentions ;
for he thinks that states ought to pos­ sess an equality of these two things, property and education.
But he should have said particularly what education he in­ tended ;
nor is it of any service to have this one and the same for all;
for this education may be one and the same, and yet such as will make the citizens over-greedy to grasp after honours, or riches, or both.
Besides, not only an inequality of possessions, but also one of honours, occasions seditions, though in a contrary way in either case ;
for the vulgar will be seditious if there be an equality of goods, but those of more elevated sentiments, if there is an equality of honours;
whence it is said, " When good and bad do equal honours share."
Homer, Il. ix. 319.
For men are not guilty of crimes for necessaries only,-( for which they think an equality of goods would be a sufficient remedy, as they would then have no occasion to steal for cold or hunger,)—but that they may enjoy what they desire, and not wish for it in vain;
for if their desires extend beyond the common necessaries of life, they will do any injustice to gra­ tify them ;
and not only so, but, if they feel a desire, they will do the same to enjoy pleasures free from pain.
1
What remedy then shall we find for these three disorders ?
For the first, let every one have a moderate subsistence, and labour for his living.
For the second, let him practise temperance ;
and thirdly, let those who wish for pleasure through them­ selves, seek for it only in philosophy ;
for all other pleasures want the assistance of man.
Men, then, are guilty of the greatest crimes from ambition, and not from necessity ;
no one, for instance, aims at being a tyrant, to keep him from the cold ;
hence great honour is due to him who kills not a thief, but a tyrant ;
2 so that form of polity which Phaleas establishes, would only be salutary to prevent little crimes.
He is also very desirous to establish such rules as will tend to better the internal policy of his state ;
but he ought also to have done the same with respect to its neighbours, and all foreign nations ;
for it is necessary that every government should be well appointed as to its military force ;
but of this he has 'said nothing.
So also with respect to property;
it ought not only to be adapted to the exigencies of the state, but also to such dangers as may arise from without.
Thus it should not be so great as to tempt those that are near and more powerful to invade it, while those who possess it are not able to drive out the invaders, nor so little as that the state should not be able to go to war with those who are quite equal to itself;
of this too he has determined nothing ;
but it ought not to be forgotten that some amount of resources is advan­ tageous to a state.
Perhaps, then, the proper boundary is this ;
not to possess enough to make it worth while for a more powerful neighbour to attack you, any more than those who have not so much as yourself.
Thus when Autophradatus proposed to besiege Atarneus, Eubulus advised him to con­ sider what time it would require to take the city, and then to calculate the expenses of that period;
for that he would be willing for a less sum at once to quit Atarneus :
his say­ ing this made Autophradatus reflect upon the business, and give over the siege.
There is, indeed, some advantage in an equality of goods, to prevent seditions amongst the citizens ;
and yet, to say the truth, it is no very great one ;
for men of great abilities will be likely to feel hurt at not being reckoned at their proper worth, and hence they will very often appear ready for commotion and sedition.
For the wickedness of mankind is insatiable.
For though at first two obols might be sufficient pay, yet when once it is become customary, they continually want something more, until they set no limits to their expectations ;
1 for it is the nature of our desires to be boundless, and many live only to gratify them.
But for this purpose, the first object is not so much to establish an equal­ ity of fortune, as to prevent those who are of a good dispo­ sition from desiring more than their own, and those who are of a bad one from being able to acquire it ;
1 and this may be done if they are kept in an inferior station, and not exposed to injustice.

consists not only in this, but also in slaves, cattle, money, and all that variety of things which fall under the name of chat­ tels.
Now there must be either an equality established in all these, or some certain general rule, or they must be left en­ tirely at large.
It appears too by his laws, that he intends to establish his state on a small scale, as all the artificers are to belong to the public, and will add nothing to the complement of citizens ;
His system suited only to a very small state.
but if all those who are to be employed upon public works are to be public slaves, it should be done in the same manner as it is at Epidamnus, and as Diophantus formerly regulated it at Athens.
From these particulars any one may nearly judge whether Phaleas has said well or ill as to his com­ munity.

down what sort of government was best.
Ac­ cordingly he planned his state to consist of ten thousand persons, and divided into three parts, one consisting of artisans, the second of husbandmen, and the third of the military order;
he also divided the lands into three parts, allotting one to sacred purposes, another to the public, and the third to individuals.
The first of these was to supply what was necessary for the established worship of the gods ;
the second was to be allotted to the support of the soldiery;
and the third was to be the property of the bus­ bandmen.
He thought also that there need only be three sorts of laws, for there are only three matters on account of which actions can be brought, namely, assault, trespass, or death.
He ordered also that there should be one final court of appeal, into which all causes were to be removed which seemed to have been unjustly determined elsewhere ;
and this court he composed out of a body of elders chosen for that purpose.
He thought also that they should not pass sentence by votes ;
but that every one should bring with him a tablet, on which he should write that he found the party guilty, if such was the case, but that, in case of an acquittal, he should bring a plain tablet;
but if he acquitted him of one part'of the in­ dictment, but not of the other, he should express that also on the tablet;
for he disapproved of the custom already estab­ lished by law, as obliging the judges to be guilty of perjury if they determined positively on the one side or the other.

also made a law, that those should be rewarded who devised any thing for the good of the city, and that the children of those who fell in battle should be educated at the public expense :
1 this law had never up to that time been proposed by any other legislator, though it is at present in use at Athens as well as in other cities.
Further, he would have the magistrates all chosen out of the people;
(meaning by the people the three parts before spoken of;
) and that those who were so elected, should be the particular guardians of what belonged to the public, to strangers, and to orphans.
These are the principal parts and most worthy of notice in the plan of Hippodamus.
But some persons might doubt the propriety of his di­ viding the citizens into three parts.;
for the artisans, the husbandmen, and the soldiery, all His system open to many objections.
are to have a share in the community, while the husband­ men are to have no arms, and the artisans neither arms nor land, which would in a manner render them slaves to the soldiery..
It is also impossible that they should all par­ take of all the posts of honour ;
for the generals and the guardians of the state must necessarily be appointed out of the soldiery, and indeed, so to say, the most honourable magis­ trates ;
but if the ethers have not their share in the govern­ ment, how can they be expected to be friendly disposed towards it ?
But it is necessary that the soldiery should be superior to the other two parts, and this will not be effected unless they are very numerous;
and if they are so, why should the community consist of any other members, and have a right to elect the magistrates ?
Besides, of what use are the husbandmen to this community ?
Artisans, it is true, are necessary, for these every city wants, and they can live off their business as in all other states.
If the husbandmen in­ deed furnished the soldiery with provisions, they would be properly part of the community;
but these are supposed to have their private property, and to cultivate it for their own use.
Moreover, if the soldiery are themselves to cultivate that common land which is appropriated for their support, there will be no distinction between the soldier and the husband­ man, which the legislator intended there should lie;
and if there should be any others besides those who cultivate their own private property, and the military, there will be a fourth order in the state, which has no share in it, and will always be alien from it.
But further, if any one should propose that the same persons should cultivate their own lands and the public land also, then there would be a deficiency of provisions to supply two families, as the lands would not immediately yield enough for themselves and the soldiers also;
all these Difficulties of his judicial system.
things, then, involve great confusion.
Neither is his method of determining causes a good one, when he would have the judge, in deciding, split the case which comes simply before him, and thus, instead of being a judge, become an arbitrator.
Now in matters of arbitration, this is possible to a number of indi­ viduals;
1 (for they confer together upon the business that is before them;
) but when a cause is brought before judges it is not so ;
but on the contrary, the majority of legislators take care that the judges shall not communicate their sentiments to each other.
Besides, what can prevent confusion in the de­ cision, when one judge thinks a fine should be inflicted, but not so great an one as that which the suitor thinks fit;
the latter proposing twenty minæ, while the judge imposes ten, or be it more or less, another four, and another five ?
It is evi­ dent then that in this manner they will differ from each other, some giving the whole damages sued for, and others nothing ;
and if so, how shall the determinations of their votes be settled?
Besides, nothing compels a judge to perjure him­ self who simply acquits or condemns, if the action is fairly and justly brought;
for he who acquits the party, does not say that he ought not to pay any fine at all, but that he ought not to pay a fine of twenty mint.
But he that condemns him is guilty of perjury, if he sentences him to pay twenty minæ, while he believes the damages ought not to be so high.
But with respect to the honours which he proposes to bestow on those who devise any thing which is useful to the community, this, though all very pleasing to the ear, is not safe for the legislator to settle, for it would occasion informers, and, it may be, commotions too in the state.
And this pro- Further objec­ tions and diffi­ culties.
posal of his gives rise also to a further conjecture and inquiry ;
for some persons doubt whether it is useful or hurtful to alter the established laws of any country, if even it be for the better ;
for which reason one cannot immediately accede to what is here said, since it is not advantageous to alter them.
We know indeed, that it is pos­ sible to propose a remodelling of both the laws and govern­ ment as a common good ;
and since we have mentioned this subject, it may be very proper to enter into a few particulars concerning it;
for it contains some difficulties, as we have a!­ ready said, and it may appear better to alter them, for it has been found useful in other sciences at all events so to do.
Thus the science of physics is extended beyond its ancient bounds;
so is the gymnastic, and indeed all other arts and faculties ;
and hence, since the political science must be held to be one of them, it is clear that the same thing will necessarily hold good in its respect.
And it may also be affirmed that experience itself gives a proof of this;
for the ancient laws are too simple and barbarous ;
for example, the Greeks used to wear armour in common,1 and to buy their wives of each other, And indeed all the remains of old laws which we have, are very simple ;
for instance, a law in Cyme relative to murder, by which if any one, in prosecuting another for murder, can produce a certain number of witnesses to it of his own relations, the accused person is to be held guilty of the crime.
But, in a word, all persons ought to endeavour to follow what is right, and not what is established ;
and it is probable that the first of the human race, whether they sprung out of the earth, or were saved from some general calamity, were much in the same state as the vulgar and un­ learned now, as is affirmed of the aborigines;
so that it would be absurd to continue in the practice of their rules.
Nor is it moreover right to permit written laws always to remain unaltered;
for as in all other sciences, so in politics, it is impossible that every thing should be expressed in writ­ ing with perfect exactness ;
for when we commit a thing to writing we must use general terms ;
but in every action there is something particular to itself, which these may not com­ prehend ;
and hence it is evident, that certain laws will at certain times admit of alterations.
But if we consider this matter in another point of view, it will appear to be one which requires great caution ;
for when the advantage pro­ posed is trifling, as the accustoming the people easily to abolish their laws is a bad thing, it is evidently better to pass over some faults on the part of both the legislator and the magistrates;
Change of laws and constitu­ tion a bad thing.
lor the alterations will not be productive of so much good, as a habit of disobeying the magistrates will be of harm.
Be­ sides, the instance brought from the arts is fallacious;
for it is not the same thing to alter the one as the other.
For a law derives from custom all its power to enforce obedience, and this requires long time to establish ;
so that to make it an easy matter to pass from the established laws to other new ones, is to weaken the power of laws.
And besides, if the laws are to be altered, are they all to be altered, and in every government or not ?
and shall it be the pleasure of any chance person, or of whom ?
Now all these particulars make a great difference;
for which reason let us at present drop this in­ quiry, for it better suits some other occasion.
The govern­ ment of Spar­ ta reviewed.
Two questions started.
BUT the considerations which offer themselves with respect to the governments established at Lacedæmon and in Crete, and indeed in all other states, are two in number ;
the one, whether their laws are laid down well or ill, when com­ pared with the best form possible:
the other, whether there is any thing in its principles or administration, in any way opposed to the theory proposed to them.
1
Now it is allowed that the members of every well-regulated state should be free from servile labour ;
but in what manner this shall be effected, is not easy to determine.
For the Penestæ have very often attacked the Thessalians, and the Helots2 the Lacedaamonians ;
for they in a manner continually watch an opportunity for some misfortune to be­ fal them.
1
But no such thing has ever yet hap- Difficulties arising from the Helots.
pened to the Cretans ;
the reason for which probably is, that although the neighbouring cities are engaged in frequent wars with each other, yet none of them are ready to enter into alliance with the revolters, as it would be disadvantageous for themselves who have villains of their own.
But there has been perpetual enmity between the Lacedæmonians and all their neighbours, the Argives, the Messenians, and the Area­ dians.
Their slaves also, from the very first, have revolted from 2 the Thessalians, while they have been engaged in wars wi th their neighbours the Achæans, the Perrhæbeans, and the Magnesians.
It seems to me indeed, if nothing else, yet a very troublesome business, to settle how to keep upon proper terms with them ;
for if you are remiss in your discipline, they grow insolent, and think themselves upon an equality with their masters ;
and if they are hardly used, they are continually plotting against you, and hate you.
It is evident then, that those who happen to employ slaves, have not as yet And from the women.
hit upon the right way of managing them.
As to giving licence to the women, it is hurtful to the end of government and to the prosperity of the state;
for as a man and his wife are each a part of a family, it is clear that we must suppose the city to be divided into two nearly equal parts, namely, into the number of men and of women.
In whatever city, then, the women are not under good regulations, we must look upon one half of it as not under the restraint of law.
And this actually happened at Sparta;
for the legislator, desiring to make his whole city a collection of warriors, most evidently accomplished his design with respect to the men, but in the meas time the women were quite neglected, for they live without restraint in every improper in­ dulgence and luxury.'
So that in such a state riches will ne­ cessarily be in general esteem, particularly if the men chance to be governed by their wives, which has been the case with many a brave and warlike people, except the Celts, and those other nations, if there are any such, who openly approve of connexion with men.
And the first mythologists seem not without good reason to have joined Mars and Venus to­ gether ;
for all nations of this character appear to be greatly addicted either to the love of women or of boys ;
for which reason it was thus at Lacedtemon ;
and many things in their state were done by the authority of the women.
For what is the difference, if the power is in their hands, whether the women rule, or whether the rulers themselves are influenced by their women ?
The same is the result in either case.
And as this boldness of the women can be of no use in any matters of daily life, if it was ever so, it must be in war ;
but we find that the Laceclæmonian women were of the greatest disservice in this respect, as was proved at the time of the Theban inva­ sion, when they were of no use at all, as they are in other cities, but made more disturbance than even the enemy.
This licence which the Lacedæmonian women enjoy is what might be expected from the first ;
for the How this hap­ men were wont to be absent from home for a long time upon foreign expeditions against the Argives, and afterwards against the Arcadians and Messenians ;
so that, when these wars were at an end, owing to their military life, in which there is no little virtue, they showed themselves pre­ pared to obey the precepts of their lawgiver;
but we are told, that when Lycurgus endeavoured to reduce the n also to an obedience to his laws, upon their refusal, e- sisted from his purpose.
The women, then, were the causes of these results, so that all the fault was theirs.
But we are not now considering for whom we ought to make allowance or not, but what is right and what is wrong;
and when the manners of the women are not well regulated, as we have al­ ready said, they are likely not only to occasion discord be­ tween the various parts of the community, which is dis­ graceful, but also to increase the love of money.
In the next place, after what has been said, one might find fault with his unequal division of property ;
for it so happens that some have far too much, others too little, by which means the land has And from the unequal distri­ bution of pro­ perty.
come into few hands ;
and this matter is badly regulated by his laws.
For he made it infamous for any one either to buy or sell his possessions, and in this he did right;
but he per­ mitted any one that chose it to give them away or bequeath them, although nearly the same consequences must needs arise from the one course as from the other.
For it is supposed that nearly two parts in five of the whole country is the property of women, owing to their being so often heiresses, and having puch large fortunes in marriage ;
though it would be better to allow them none, or a little, or a certain regulated propor­ tion.
Now however every one is permitted to give his heiress to whomsoever he pleases ;
and if he dies intestate, he who succeeds as heir at law gives her to whom he pleases.
Dearth of population.
Whence it happens that, although the country is1 able to support fifteen hundred horse and thirty thousand foot, the number does not amount even to one thousand.
And from these results it is made evident, that in this particular the state is badly regulated;
for the city could not support one blow, but was ruined for want of men.
2
They say, that during the reigns of their ancient kings they used to present foreigners with the freedom of their city, to prevent there being a want of men while they carried on long wars ;
it is also affirmed that the number of Spartans was formerly ten thousand;
but be that true or false as it may, it is far better to increase the number of the male population by an equality of property.
The law too which he made to encourage population, was by no means calculated to correct this inequality ;
for being willing that the Spartans should be as numerous as possible, he encouraged them to have as large families as possible;
and to this end there is a law that he who had three children should be ex­ empted from the night-watch, and that he who had four should pay no taxes:
1 though it is very evident, that while the land was divided in this manner, if the people increased, many of them must be very poor.
And further, the constitution of the Ephoralty is faulty ;

have been many instances of this formerly, as well as in the late affair at Andros.
For certain men, being corrupted with money, went as far as they could to ruin the city.
And, moreover, because their power was very great and nearly tyrannical, Difficulties with regard to the kings of Sparta.
their kings too were obliged to flatter them, which contri­ buted greatly to hurt the state ;
for it was altered from an aris­ tocracy to a democracy.
This magistracy1 is indeed the great bond which holds the state together;
for the people are easy, knowing that they have a share of the first office in it;
so that whether it took place by the intention of the legislator, or whether it happened by chance, this is of great service to their affairs;
for in a state which aims at permanency, every member of it ought to endeavour that each part of the govern­ ment may be preserved and continue the same.
And upon this principle their kings have always acted, out of regard to their honour;
the wise and good from their attachment to the senate, a seat wherein they consider as the reward of virtue ;
and the common people, that they may support the ephors, for the latter are chosen from the entire body.
And it is proper that these magistrates should be chosen out of the whole community, but not in the way which is customary at present, for it is very ridiculous.
The ephors are the supreme j udges in cases of the last consequence;
but, as they are per­ sons taken at chance from the people, it is not right that they should determine according to their own opinion, but by written law or established customs.
2
Their way of life also is not consistent with the will of the city, for it is too indul­ gent ;
whereas that of the others tends to too great severity, so that they cannot support it, but privately act contrary to the law and enjoy sensual pleasures.
There are also great de­ fects in the institution of their senators.
If indeed they were of a kind disposition, fitly trained to manly virtue, every one would readily admit that they would be useful to the govern­ ment ;
but still it might be debated, whether they should con­ tinue judges for life, to determine points of the greatest moment, since the mind has its old age as well as the body;
but as they are so brought up that even the legislator could not depend upon them as good men,3 their power must be far from safe :
for it is known that the members of tnat body have been guilty of taking bribes, and of much partiality in public affairs.
For this reason it had been much better if they had been made responsible for their conduct, which they are not.
But it may be said that the ephors seem to have a check upon all the magistrates.
This power indeed is far too great a pri­ vilege ;
but I affirm that they should not be intrusted with this control in the manner in which they are.
Moreover, the .node of choice which they make use of at the election of their sen­ ators is very childish.
Nor is it right for any one about to be elected to office to solicit a place ;
for every person who is fit to hold office, whether he chooses it or not, ought to be elected.
But his intention was evidently the same in this, as in the other parts of his government.
For making his citizens am­ bitious after honours, he has employed persons of that dispo­ sition in the election of his senate, since no others will solicit that office;
and yet the principal part of those crimes of which men are deliberately guilty, arise from ambition and avarice.
We will inquire at another time whether the kingly office is useful to the state or not:
but thus much is certain, that they should be chosen, not as they are now, but from a consideration of their individual conduct.
But that the legis­ lator himself did not expect to make all his citizens completely virtuous, is evident from the fact, that he distrusts them as not being sufficiently good men ;
for he sent out enemies upon the same embassy, and thought that dissensions between the kings were the very safety of the state.
Neither were their common meals, called Pheidittia,l well arranged by him who first established them :
for Tendency of the public tables.
the table should rather have been provided at the public ex­ pense, as at Crete;
whereas at Lacedæmon every one was obliged to contribute his portion, although he might be very poor and could by DO means bear the expense.
By this means the contrary happened to what the legislator desired :
for he intended that the appointment of those public meals should strengthen the democratic element;
but arranged as it was by him, it had far from a democratic tendency;
for those who were very poor could not take part in them ;
and the limit of the state was laid down by their forefathers, that whoever could not contribute his proportion to the common tables should have no share in them.
Other persons have censured his law concerning the office of High Admiral, and not with­ out reason, as it gave rise to disputes.
For the office of admi­ ral is in opposition to the kings, who are generals of the army, and being for life, becomes, as it were, a second monarchy.
And in this respect, too, one might censure the theory of the legis­ lator, as Plato has done in his Laws ;
the whole arrangement of the constitution is calculated only for the business of war, Sparta a mili­ tary state, and could live only in war.
for it is excellent to make them conquerors.
And this is the reason why the state survived as long as they were at war, but began to perish as soon as they gained sway:
for they knew not how to be idle, or to engage in any other employment more proper than war.
In this also they were no less mistaken, that they thought rightly enough that those things which are objects of conten­ tion, are better procured by virtue than by vice ;
yet they wrongfully supposed the things themselves to be preferable to virtue.
Nor was the public revenue well managed at Sparta ;
for the state had nothing in its coffers while it was obliged to carry on extensive wars, and the subsidies were badly raised ;
for as the Spartans possessed a large extent of country, they were obliged to look closely to each other, as to what they paid in.
And thus an event took place contrary to the prudent design of the legislator;
for he made the state poor, and its individual members avaricious.
Let it suffice to have said thus much concerning the Lacedæmonian government;
for these are the chief points in it which one would blame.

blance to this;
in some few particulars it is not worse, but in general it is less skilfully contrived.
For it appears, and is said, that in most particulars the constitution of Lacedæmon was formed in imitation of that of Crete;
and in general most

old things are less compactly put together than new ones.
For they say, that when Lycurgus ceased to be guardian to King Charilaus, he went abroad, and spent a long time with his relations in Crete.
For the Lycians are a colony of the Lacedaemonians ;
and those who first settled there adopted that body of laws which they found already established by the inhabitants;
in like manner also, those who now live near them have the very laws which they had when Minos first drew out his system of a state.
This island seems formed by nature to be the mistress of Greece, for it lies across the en­ tire length of the sea, around which nearly all the Greeks are settled ;
and it is not far distant on the one side from Pelo­ ponnesus, on the other, which looks toward Asia, from Trio­ plum and Rhodes.
Hence Minos 1 acquired the empire of the sea and of the islands, some of which he subdued, and others he colonized :
2 at last he died at Camicus while he was at­ tacking Sicily.
There is this analogy between the customs of the Lacedæmonians and the Cretans, the Helots cultivate the grounds for the one, the serfs for the other.
3
Both states too have their common meals, and the Lacedæmonians called these formerly not Φειδίττια, but ῎Ανδϱια, as the Cretans do ;
which proves whence the custom arose.
In this particular their governments are also alike:
the ephors have the same power with those who are called Cosmi in Crete;
' with this differ­ ence only, that the number of the one is five, of the other ten.
The senators are the same as those whom the Cretans call the council.
There was formerly also a kingly power in Crete ;
The Cosmi.
but it was afterwards dissolved, and the command of their armies belongs to the Cosmi.
Every one also has a vote in their public assembly;
but this has only the power of confirming what has already been passed by the The public tables.
council and the Cosmi.
The Cretans conducted their public meals better than the Lacedæmonians, for at Lacedæmon each individual was obliged to furnish what was assessed upon him ;
and if he could not do this, there was a law which deprived him of the rights of a citizen, as has been already mentioned:
but in Crete they were furnished by the community ;
for all the corn and cat­ tle, taxes and contributions, which the domestic slaves were obliged to furnish, were divided into parts, and allotted to the gods, the public services of the state, and these public meals ;
so that all the men, women, and children were main­ tained from a common stock.
The legislator gave many minute regulations to encourage a habit of eating sparingly, as being very useful to the citizens.
In regard to the marriage of the women also, he provided that they should not be too prolific, by introducing the love of boys:
whether in this he did well or ill we shall have some other opportunity of considering.
2
But that the public meals were better ordered at Crete than at Lacedæmon is very evident.
The institution of the Cosmi was still worse than that of the ephors :
for the faults incident to that magistracy belong to the former also ;
for in both cases it is uncertain who will be elected:
but the Lacedæmonians have this advantage which the others have not, that as the election is made from the whole body, the people have a share in the highest honours, and therefore all desire to preserve the state :
whereas among the Cretans, the Cosmi are not chosen out of the people in general, but out of some certain families, and the senate out of those who have served as Cosmi.
And the same observations which have been made on the senate at Lacedæmon, may be applied to these ;
for their being irresponsible, and elected for life, is an honour greater than they merit ;
and to rule, not according to a written law, but at their own discretion, is dangerous.
(As to there being no insurrections, though the people share not in the manage­ ment of public affairs, this is no proof of a well-constituted government, for the Cosmi have no opportunity of being bribed like the ephors, as they live in an island far from those who would corrupt them.)
But the method they take to correct that fault is absurd, at variance with civil equality, and tyran­ nical ;
for very often either their fellow magistrates or some private persons conspire together and turn out the Cosmi ;
they are also permitted to resign their office before their time is elapsed.
1
Now it would be better if all this was done by law, and not at the pleasure of the individuals, which is a bad rule to follow.
But what is worst of all, is that general con­ fusion which those who are in power often introduce, when they wish to impede the course of justice ;
which sufficiently shows that the government has some properties of a polity, but in reality is rather a tyranny.
And it is usual with the principal persons amongst them to collect together apart some of the common people and their friends, and then to set up for themselves, and sow seditions, and to come to blows with each other.
And what is the difference, if such be the case, or if the state gradually alters in process of time, and becomes no longer the same constitution ?
A state like this will ever be exposed to danger from those who are powerful and inclined

to attack it;
but, as has been already mentioned, its situation preserves it, as its distance frees it from the inroads of foreigners ;
and for this reason the serfs still remain quiet at Crete, while the Helots are per­ petually revolting:
for the Cretans take no part in foreign affairs, and it is but lately that any foreign attack has been made upon the island ;
and this soon proved the weakness of their laws.
And thus much will suffice us to say about the government of Crete.
1
The govern­ ment of Car­ thage resem­ bles the pre­ ceding.
THE Carthaginians, too, seem to enjoy a good form of government, and in many respects su­ perior to the rest;
and in some particulars it bears a near resemblance to the Lacedæmonians.
And indeed, these three states, the Cretans, the Lacedæ­ monians, and the Carthaginians, are in some things very like each other;
in others they differ greatly, and many of their arrangements are excellent.
And this is a proof of a well-constituted government, if it admits the people to a share, and still remains unaltered in its form of polity, without any popular insurrection worth notice on the one hand, or growing into a tyranny on the other.
3
Now the Carthaginians, in common with the Lacedæmonians, have public tables for those who are bound together by companion­ ship, answering to their Phiditia;
they have also their magis­ tracy consisting of a hundred and four persons, similar to the ephors, but chosen on a better plan ;

for there they are chosen from the common herd, but at Carthage they are chosen out of those of the better sort ;

to the kings and senate at Sparta;
but it is better to appoint their kings (as at Carthage) without confining them­ selves to one family, or choosing from any common stock :
but if there be any persons of greater merit than the rest, from these they prefer to choose rather than on account of age :
1 for as they are invested with supreme power over many things, if they are persons of no account, they become very hurtful to the state, as they have ere this been to the Lace­ dæmonians.
Now the greater part of those points which might be blamed in their deviations, are common to all those go­ vernments which we have described;
but as to this abstract form of their aristocratic polity, some parts of it incline to a democracy, others an oligarchy.
For instance, the kings and the senate, if they are unanimous upon any point, can choose whether they will bring it before the people or no ;
but if they disagree, the people must decide.
But whatever they may introduce to its notice, it belongs to the people not only to hear what has been approved of by the senate, but finally to ratify it:
and whosoever chooses has a right to speak against any matter whatsoever that may be proposed, which is not The Pentar­ chies, how chosen:

their power also continues longer than any other magistrates, for it begins before they come into office, and continues after it expires ;
and in these particulars the state inclines to an oligarchy :
but the fact that they are not elected by lot, or permitted to take money, tends to an aristocracy ;
and so does any thing else of the same kind ;

Their tend­ ency.
The constitution of Carthage, too, is now deviat­ ing from an aristocracy to an oligarchy, in conse­ quence of an opinion favourably entertained by many, who think that the magistrates in the community ought not to be chosen by family only, but by fortune also ;
as it is impossible for those who are in bad circumstances to sup­ port their dignity, or to have leisure for public business.
Accordingly, as the electing men by their fortune makes a state incline to an oligarchy, and to elect them by ability, to an aristocracy, so is there a third method of proceeding, according to which matters are regulated in the polity of Carthage ;
for they have an eye to these two particulars when they elect their officers, and particularly those of the highest General cha­ racter of the constitution.
rank, their kings 3and their generals.
One must admit that this deviation of the state from an aristocracy was a great fault in their legislator;
for this is a most necessary thing to provide for from the first, that those citizens who have the best abilities may have leisure, and not be obliged to do any thing unworthy of their character, not only when in office, but also when private per­ sons ;
for if once you are obliged to look among the wealthy for men who have leisure to serve, the evil follows, that the greatest offices, of king and general, will soon become venal.
For this principle makes riches of more account than virtue, and causes the state to grow avaricious :
for whatever those who have the chief power regard as honourable, the opinion of the citizens necessarily follows in their wake ;
and where the first honours are not paid to virtue, there the aristocratic form of government cannot flourish firmly :
for it is reasonable to conclude, that those who bought their places 1 should make an advantage of it, when they gain their offices by purchase;
as it is absurd to suppose that if a man of probity is poor, and still desires to gain something, a bad man will not wish to do the same, to reimburse himself;
for which reason the magis­ tracy should be formed of those who are most able to support an aristocracy.
It would have been better if the legislator had passed over the poverty of men of merit, only taking care that in office they should have sufficient leisure to attend to public affairs.
It seems also improper, that one person should execute several offices, which is approved of at Carthage ;
for one business is best done by one Pluralism in the state:
its ill effects.
person ;
2 and it is the duty of the legislator to look to this, and not to appoint the same person a musician and a shoemaker:
so that where the state is not small, it is more politic and more popular to admit many persons to have a share in the govern­ ment ;
for, as I just now said, it is not only more usual, but every thing is better and sooner accomplished, when done by the same persons:
and this is evident both in the army and navy, where almost everyone, in his turn, both commands and is under command.
But as their government inclines to an oli- garchy, they cleverly avoid its effects by always appointing some of the popular party as governors of the cities.
Thus they consult this fault in their constitution, and render it stable ;
but this is depending on chance ;
whereas the legislator ought so to frame his government that there can be no room for insur­ rections.
But now, if there should be any general calamity and the people should revolt from their rulers, there is no remedy to enforce obedience by the laws.
And these are the particulars of the Lacedæmonian, the Cretan, and the Carthaginian governments, each of which seem worthy of commendation.
SOME of those persons who have written upon government are men who never had a share in public affairs, but always led a private life ;
and nearly every thing worthy of notice in their works we have already spoken about.
Others have been legislators, some in their own cities, and some of them em­ ployed in regulating the governments of foreign states.
Some of them were merely composers of a body of laws;
others Solon and other legisla­ tors.
The Athenian constitution combines the three elements together.
The Areopa­ gus.
formed the constitution also, as Lycurgus and Solon, who were the authors both of laws and of a polity.
The Lacedæmonians have already been mentioned.
Some persons think that Solon was an excellent legislator, in that he dissolved a pure oligarchy, and saved the people from their state of slavery, and established the ancient democratic form of government in his country, thus blending the whole system well together.
In the senate of Areopagus, the oligarchic element was pre­ served ;
by the manner of electing their magistrates, the aris- tocratic ;
and in their courts of justice, the democratic.
So­ lon, too, seems not to have altered the established form of government, either with respect to the senate, or the mode of electing their magistrates ;
but to have raised the people to great consideration in the state, by electing the supreme courts from all the citizens :
and for this some persons blame him, as having overturned the balance of power, by making the popular assembly, chosen as it was by lot, supreme.
For as soon as the latter grew strong, it became necessary to flatter a tyrannical po­ pulace :
and so they brought the government to its present form of a democracy.
Both Ephialtes and Pericles abridged the power of the Areopagus, the latter of whom introduced the method of paying those who attended the courts of justice :
1 and thus every popular leader went on increas­ ing the power of the people to what we now see it.
But it is evident that this was not according Rise of the po­ pular power.
to the intention of Solon, but that it arose from accident;
for the people, being the cause of the naval supremacy in the Persian war, grew proud, and enlisted themselves under fac­ tious demagogues, although opposed by the better part of the citizens.
Solon, indeed, seems to have intrusted the people with the most necessary part of power, the choice of their magistrates, and the right of calling them to account;
for with­ out these powers the people must have been slaves and ene­ mies to the rest.
But he elected to the magistracy none but persons of good account and property, out of those who were worth five hundred me-

As for those of the fourth class, which consisted ot Other legisla­ tors.
mechanics, they were incapable of any office.
Za­ leucus was the legislator of the western Locrians, as was Charondas the Catanean of his own cities, and of the Chalcidian cities also in Italy and Sicily.
Some per­ sons endeavour to prove that Onomacritus the Locrian was the first person of note who drew up laws ;
and that he employed himself in that business while he was at Crete, where he con­ tinued some time to learn the prophetic art:
and they say, that Thales was his companion ;
and that Lycurgus and Zaleucus were disciples of Thales, and Charondas of Zaleucus;
but those who advance this, speak without due regard to chrono­ logy.
Philolaus also, a Corinthian, and of the family of the Bacchiadæ, was a Theban legislator.
This man was very fond of Diocles, a victor in the Olympic games, and when he left his country from a disgust at an improper passion which his mother Alcyone had entertained for him, and settled at Thebes, Philolaus followed him, where they both died, and where they still show their tombs placed in view of each other, but so dis­ posed, that one of them is in sight of Corinth, the other not;
the reason they give for this is, that Diodes, from his detest­ ation of his mother's passion, would have his tomb so placed that no one could see Corinth from it;
but Philolaus chose that it might be seen from his :
and this was the cause of their living at Thebes.
As Philolaus gave them laws concerning many other things, so did he upon the rearing of children, which they call Laws of Adoption ;
1 and this he did in a man­ ner peculiar to himself, to preserve the number of families.
But Charondas did nothing new, except in actions for perjury, which he was the first person who took into particular con­ sideration.
He also drew up his laws with greater accuracy than even any of our present legislators.
Philolaus introduced the law for the equal distribution of goods ;
Plato, that for the community of women, children, and goods, and also for public tables for the women ;
and besides the law concerning drunk­ enness, that the sober should preside at their symposiums.
He also made a law concerning their warlike exercises, that they should acquire the habit of using both hands alike, as it was necessary that one hand should be as useful as the other.
There are also laws by Draco, but they were published when the government was already established, and they have no­ thing particular in them worth mentioning, except their seve­ rity on account of the greatness of their punishments.
Pitta­ cus, too, was the author of some laws, though he never drew up any form of government;
a peculiar one of which was this, that if drunken men beat any person, they should be punished more than if they did it when sober;
for as people are more apt to be abusive when drunk than when sober, he paid no consideration to the excuse which drunkenness might claim, but regarded only the common benefit.
Andromadas of Rhegium was also a lawgiver among the Thracian Chalcidians.
There are some laws of his concerning murders, and heiresses, but these contain nothing that any one can say is his own.
And let thus much be laid methodically down concerning the different sorts of governments, as well those which really ex­ ist, as those which different persons have proposed.
EVERY one who inquires into the nature of go­ vernments, and what and of what kind are its
What a state is several forms, should make this almost his first question, " What is a state?"
For upon this point there is a dispute:
for some persons say, the state did this or that, while others say it was not the state, but the oligarchy, or the tyrant.
1
We see, too, that the state is the only object which both the politician and legislator have in view in all they do :
but government is a certain ordering of those who live as To answer this, we must first find out what is a citizen.
members of a state.
Now since a state is a col­ lective body, and, like other wholes, composed of many parts, it is evident that our first point must be to inquire what a citizen is :
for a state or city is a certain number of citizens.
So that we must consider whom we ought to call a citizen, and who is one;
for this is often doubtful:
for every one will not allow that this charac­ ter is applicable to the same person ;
for that man who would be a citizen in a republic, would very often not be one in an Who are not citizens.
oligarchy.
As to those who acquire this appella­ tion by some chance means or other, as natural­ ized citizens, for instance, we must pass them by.
Now it is not residence which constitutes a man a citizen;
for in this point sojourners and slaves are upon an equality with him.
Nor will it be sufficient that he have the privi­ lege of the laws, and may plead or be impleaded;
for this point belongs to all who have a mutual agreement upon which to associate ;
for these privileges are theirs also;
and withal it very often happens that sojourners have not perfect rights therein, but are obliged to apply to some patron ;
2 and this shows that their share in the community is incomplete.
In like manner, with respect to boys, who are not yet enrolled, or old men, who are discharged from service, we admit that they are in some respects citizens, yet not completely so;
but we add some qualification, for the one are not of full age, and the others are past service;
nor is there any difference between them.
But what we mean is sufficiently clear;
we want a complete citizen, one in whom there is no such defect as needs to be corrected in order to make him fully so.
As to those who are banished or degraded, there may be made the same objections, and the same answers.
There is nothing that more characterizes a complete citizen than having a share in the judicial and executive part of the government.
With respect to offices, some are fixed to a particular time, so that no person on any A citizen is one who has a share in the government of the state.
account is permitted to fill them twice, or else not till some certain period has intervened;
others are not fixed, as that of a juryman, or a member of the popular assembly.
But pos­ sibly some one may say, these are not offices, nor have the citizens in these capacities any share in Objection.
the government;
though surely it is ridiculous to say that those who have the principal power in the state bear no office in it.
But grant that this objection is of no weight, for it is only a dispute about words ;
as there is no general term which can be applied both to a dicast and a member of the assembly.
For the sake of distinction, then, let us call it an indeterminate office :
we lay it down then as a maxim, that those are citi­ zens who have this share.
Such then is the description of the citizen who comes nearest to what all those are who are called citizens.
Every one also should remember, that of the component parts of those things which differ from each other in species, those which follow after the first or second remove have either nothing at all, or to a very little extent, in com­ mon.
Now we see that governments differ from each other in their form, and that some of them are prior, others poste­ rior in time;
for it is evident, that those which have many defects and deviations in them must be in time posterior to those which are without such faults.
1
(What we mean by deviations will be hereafter explained.)
Hence it is clear, that the office of a citizen must differ just as governments do from each other:
for which reason he who is called a citizen is most truly a Citizens differ­ ent under dif­ ferent forms of government.
citizen in a democracy.
In other forms of government he may be so indeed, but not necessarily ;
for in some states the people have no power;
nor have they any general assembly, but a few select officers ;
the trial also of different causes is allotted to different persons ;
as at Lacedæmon, where all disputes con­ cerning contracts are brought before some of the ephors , while the senate are the judges in cases of murder, some cases being heard by one magistrate, others by another:
and thus at Car­ thage certain magistrates determine all causes.
1
But our former description of a citizen will admit of correction ;
for in some governments, the office of a dicast and of a member of the general assembly, is not an indeterminate one;
but there are particular persons appointed for these purposes, some or all of the citizens being appointed jurymen, or members of the general assembly ;
and this either for all causes and all public business whatsoever, or else for some particular one.
This A state is the aggregate of such citizens.
then is sufficient to show what a citizen is;
for whoever has a right to take part in the judicial and executive part of government in any state, him we call a citizen of that place;
and a state, in one word, is the collective body of such persons, sufficient in themselves for all the purposes of life.
2Other opinions as to citizen­ ship.
FOR common use, then, men define a citizen to be one who is sprung from citizens on both sides, not on the fathers or the mother's only.
3
Others carry the matter still further, and inquire as to his ancestors, for three or more generations.
But some persons have ques­ tioned how the first of the family, be he third or fourth in ascent, could prove himself a citizen, according to this popu­ lar and careless definition.
Gorgias of Leontium, partly entertaining the same doubt, and partly in jest, says, that as mortars ape made by mor-

tar-makers, and Larissæan kettles by kettle-makers, so citizens are made by citizen-makers.
1
This is indeed a very simple account of the matter ;
for they would be citizens if they had a share in the state, according to this definition ;
but this can­ not apply to the first founders or inhabitants of states, who can claim no right either from their father or mother.
It is probably a matter of still greater difficulty to determine their political rights, in the case of those who are enfranchised after any revolution in the state.
As, for instance, at Athens, after the expulsion of the tyrants, when Cleisthenes enrolled many foreigners and city slaves amongst the tribes ;
the doubt with respect to them was, not whether they were citizens or no, but whether they were legally so or not.
Though indeed some persons may have this further doubt, whether a citizen can be a citizen, when he is illegally made;
as if an illegal citizen, and one A further ques­ tion as to citi­ zens unjustly created.
who is no citizen at all, were the same:
but since we see some persons govern unjustly, whom yet we admit to be governors, though not justly so, and the definition of a citizen is one who exercises certain offices, (for such we have defined a citizen to be,) it is evident that a citizen illegally created yet continues to be a citizen;
but whether justly or unjustly so, follows next upon the former inquiry.
SOME also doubt what is and what is not the act Wherein con­ of the state ;
as for instance, when a democracy sists the iden­ arises out of an aristocracy, or a tyranny ;
for tity of a state ?

good.
So in like manner, whatever is done by those who manage an established democracy, the actions of this go­ vernment are to be considered as the actions of the state, as well as in the oligarchy or tyranny.
And here it seems very proper to consider this question, when shall we say that a state is the same, and when shall we say that it is different ?
Not in locality.
Now the most superficial mode of examining into this question, is to begin with the place and the people ;
for it may happen that the place and the people may be divided, and that some one of them may live in one place, and some in another.
But this question may be re­ garded as no very knotty one ;
for, as a state is so called in a variety of senses, it may be solved many ways.
And in' like manner, when men inhabit one common place, when shall we say that the state is the same ?
for it does not depend upon the walls;
for it would be possible to surround Pelo­ ponnesus itself with a wall, as was Babylon, and every other place which encircles rather a nation than a city;
for they say that when it had been taken three days, some of the in­ habitants knew nothing of it.
But we shall find a proper time to determine this question ;
for the extent of a state, how large it should be, and whether it should consist of more than one people, these are particulars which ought not to escape the politician.
This too is a matter of inquiry, whether Nor in mere sameness of race.
we shall say that a state is the same while it is inhabited by the same race of men, though some of them are perpetually dying, others coming into the world, as we say that a river or a fountain is the same, though the waters are continually changing ;
or, when a si­ milar event takes place shall we say that the men are the same, but the state is different ?
1
For if a state is a community, it is & community of citizens ;
but if the mode of government should alter, and become of another sort, it would seem a ne­ cessary consequence that the state is not the same ;
as we regard the tragic chorus as different from the comic, though it may probably consist of the same performers.
Thus every other community or composition is said to be different, if the species of composition is different;
as in music the same voices produce different harmony, as at one time the Doric and at another the Phrygian melody.
If this is true, it is evident that when we speak of a state as being the same, we refer especially to the go-
But in identity of government.
vernment there established;
and it is possible to call it by the same name or any other, whether it be inhabited by the same men or by different ones.
But whether or no it is right or not right to dissolve the community, when the state passes into an altered form of constitution, is another question.
AFTER what has been said, it follows that we should consider, whether the virtue of a good man is the same as that of a valuable citizen, or differ­ ent from it;
and since this point ought to have a
Is the virtue of a good man the same as that of a good citizen ?
particular inquiry, we must first give in a general outline the virtue of a good citizen.
For as a sailor is one of those who make up a community, this also we say of a citizen;
although the province of one sailor may be different from that of an­ other,—(for one is a rower, another a steersman, a third a boat­ swain, and so on, each having their several denominations,)— it is evident, that though the most accurate description of any one good sailor must refer to his peculiar abilities, still there is some common description which will apply to the whole crew;
for the safety of the ship is the common business of all of them, as this is the point at which each sailor aims.
So also with respect to citizens, although different from each other, yet they have one common care, the safety of the community ;
for the state is a community:
and for this reason, the virtue of a citizen has necessarily a reference to the state.
But since there are different kinds of governments, it is evi­ dent, that those actions which constitute the virtue of an ex­ cellent citizen will not always be the same, and hence that it cannot be perfect;
but we call a man good when he is of perfect virtue;
and hence it follows, that a man who is an excellent citizen may not possess that virtue which constitute a good man.
Those who are doubtful concerning this same question as to the best polity, may follow up the matter in another way;
for if it is impossible that a state should coil­ sist entirely of excellent citizens, (while it is necessary that every one should do well in his calling, in which consists his excellence, and as it is impossible that all the citizens should be upon the same level.)
it is impossible that the virtue of a citizen and a good man should be the same.
For all should possess the virtue of an excellent citizen, for from hence ne­ cessarily arises the perfection of the state ;
but that every one should possess the virtue of a good man is impossible, if it is not necessary that all the citizens in a well-regulated state should be virtuous.
Besides, as a state is composed of dis­ similar parts, as an animal is of life and body;
the soul, of reason and appetite ;
a family, of a man and his wife;
pro­ perty, of a master and a slave ;
in the same manner, as a state is composed of all these, and of many other very differ-
The virtue of some citizens differs from that of others.
ent parts, it necessarily follows, that the virtue of all the citizens cannot be the same ;
as the bu­ siness of the leader of a chorus is different from that of a dancer.
From all these proofs it is evi­ dent that the virtues of a citizen cannot be one and the same.
But do we never find those virtues united which constitute a good man and excellent citizen ?
for we say that such a one is an excellent magistrate, and a prudent and good man ;
but prudence is necessary to all who engage in public affairs.
1 Nay, some persons affirm, that the education of those who are intended to command, should from the beginning be different from other citizens ;
as is shown by those who instruct the children of kings in riding and warlike exercises;
and thus Euripides says, " No showy arts be mine,' But what the state requires;
" as if there were some education peculiar to a ruler.
But since the virtues of a good man and a good magistrate may be the same, and since a citizen is one who obeys the magistrate, it follows that the virtue of the one cannot in general be the same as the virtue of the other, although it may be true of some particular citizen ;
for the virtue of the magistrate must be different from the virtue of the citizen.
For this reason Jason declared, that were he no longer king, he should pine away with regret, as not knowing how to live a private man.
But it is a great recommendation to know how to command as well as to obey;
and to do both these things well is the virtue of an accomplished citizen.
Since then the virtue of a good man consists in being able to command, but that of a good citizen renders him The question decided.
equally fit for either post, they are not both equally praise­ worthy.
It appears then, that both he who commands and he who obeys should each of them learn their separate busi­ ness, and not the same;
but that the citizen should be master of and take part in both these, as any one may see from the fact that in a family government there is no occasion for the master to know how to perform the necessary offices, but rather to enjoy the labour of others;
for to do the other is a servile part.
I mean by the other, the performance of the family business of the slave.
There are many sorts of slaves, for their em­ ployments are various;
one of these are the handi­ craftsmen, who, as their name imports, get their Slaves of dif­ ferent kinds.
living by the labour of their hands ;
and amongst these all me­ chanics are included.
For which reasons such workmen in some states were not formerly admitted into any share in the government, till at length democracies were established:
it is not therefore proper for any man of honour, or any citizen, or any one who engages in public af­ fairs, to learn these servile employments, without Servile occupa­ tions unfit for citizens.
they have occasion for them for their own use;
for otherwise the distinction between a master and a slave would be lost.
But there is a government of another sort, in which men go­ vern those who are their equals in rank and freemen ;
and this we call a political government, in which men learn to command, by first submitting to obey;
just as a good general of horse, or a commander-in-chief, must acquire a knowledge of his duty, by having been long under the command of an­ other, and having served in command of a rank and a troop ;
for well is it said, that no one knows how to command, who has not himself been under command of another.
The virtues How far the virtue of the good man and the good citi­ zen are iden­ tical.
of each are indeed different, but a good citizen must know how to be able to command and to obey;
he ought also to know in what manner freemen ought to govern and be governed.
Both too belong to the good man, even though the temperance and justice of him who commands is different in kind from that of another;
for it is evident that the virtue of a good citizen cannot be the same when he is under coin­ mand or free, (as justice, for instance,) but must be of a dif­ ferent species in either of these different situations, as the temperance and courage of a man and a woman are different from each other;
for a man would appear a coward, who had only that courage which would be graceful in a woman, and a woman would be thought a chatterer, who should take as large a part in the conversation as would become a man of consequence.
The domestic employments of each of them are also different;
it is the man's business to acquire a sub­ sistence, the woman's to take care of it.
But practical wis­ dom is a virtue peculiar to those who govern, while all others seem to belong in common to both parties.
But practical wisdom does not concern the governed, but only to entertain just notions;
the latter indeed are like flute-makers, while he who governs is the musician who plays on the flutes.
And thus much to show whether the virtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same, or if it is different, and also how far it is the same, and how far different.
Are mechanics Citizens ?
BUT with respect to the citizens there is a doubt remaining, whether those only are truly so who are allowed a share in the government, or whether mechanics also are to be considered as such.
For if those who are not permitted to rule are to be reckoned among them, it is impossible that the virtue of all the citizens should be the same ;
(for these also are citizens ;
) and if none of them are admitted to be citizens, where shall they be ranked ?
for they are neither sojourners, nor foreigners.
Or snail we say that no absurdity will arise from their not being citizens, as nei­ ther the slaves nor the freedmen consist of those above men­ tioned ?
This is certainly true, that all are not citizens who are necessary to the existence of a state, as boys are not citizens in the same manner that men are, for the former are perfectly so, the latter under some conditions;
for they are citizens, though imperfect ones.
In former times indeed, among some people, the mechanics and foreigners were slaves ;
and for this reason many of them are so now ;
and indeed the best-regulated states will not permit a mechanic to be a citizen ;
but if it be allowed them, we cannot then attribute the virtue which we have described to every citizen or freeman, but to those only who are disengaged from servile offices.
Now those who are employed in such things by one person, are slaves ;
those who do them for money, are mechanics and hired servants ;
and hence it is evident on the least reflection what is their situation, for what I have said is self-evident, and fully explains the matter.
Since the number of commu­ nities is very great, it follows necessarily that there will be many different sorts of citizens, par­ ticularly of those who are governed by others ;
so
This will be different in different states.
that in one state it may be necessary to admit mechanics and hired servants to be citizens, but in others it may be impos­ sible ;
as particularly in an aristocracy, and where honours are bestowed on virtue and merit;
for it is impossible for one who lives the life of a mechanic or hired servant to prac­ tise a life of virtue.
1
In oligarchies also hired servants are not admitted to be citizens;
because there a man's right to bear any office is regulated by the size of his fortune;
but mechanics are admitted, for the majority of citizens are very rich.
There was a law at Thebes, that no one could have a share in the government, till he had been ten years out of trade.
In many states the law invites strangers to accept the freedom of the city;
and in some democracies the son of a free-woman is himself free.
The same is also observed in many others with respect to natural children ;
but it is through want of citizens regularly born that they admit such;
for these laws are always made in consequence of a scarcity of inhabitants;
so, as their numbers increase, they first deprive the children of a male or female slave of this privilege, next the child of a free-woman, and last of all, they will admit none but those whose fathers and mothers were both free.
From this it is clear that there are many sorts of citizens, and that he who shares the honours of the state may be called a complete citizen.
Thus Achilles, in Homer, complains of Agamemnon's treating him " like some unhonoured stranger ;
" 1 for he who shares not in the honours of a state, is as it were a stranger, or sojourner;
and whenever such a thing as this is concealed, it is for the sake of deceiving the inhabitants.
The virtue of a good man may be the same as that of a good citizen when in command.
From what has been said then, it is plain whether we must lay down the virtue of a good man and an excellent citizen to be the same or different;
for we find that in some states it is the same, in others not, and also that this is not true of each citizen, but of those only who take the lead, or are ca­ pable of taking the lead, in public affairs, either alone or in conjunction with others.
How many polities are admissible ?
AND since these points are determined, we pro­ ceed next to consider whether one polity only should be established, or more than one;
and if more, then how many, and of what.
sort, and what are the differences between them.
Now a polity is the ordering and regulating of the state, and of all its offices, particularly of that wherein the supreme power is lodged;
and this power is always possessed by the administration;
but the administration itself determines the particu­ lar polity.
Thus, for instance, in a democracy the They differ with the form of administra­ tion.
supreme power is lodged in the whole people ;
on the contrary, in an oligarchy it is in the hands of a few.
We say then, that the polity in these states is different, and we shall find the same thing hold good in others.
Let us first determine for whose sake a state is established, and point out the different species of rule which relate to mankind and to social life.
It has already been mentioned, in the beginning of our treatise, where a definition was made as to the management of a family, and the power of a Man a social being.
i master,' that man is an animal naturally formed for society, and that therefore, even when he does not want any foreign assistance, he will equally desire to live with others;
not but that mutual advantage also induces them to it, as far as the share of it enables each person to live agreeably.
This is indeed the great object, not only to all in general, but also to each individual:
and they join in society also for the sake of being able to live, (for doubtless in this, too, what is agreeable has a share,) and they also bind together civil society, even for the sake of preserving life, unless they are grievously over­ whelmed with its miseries:
for it is very evident, that men will endure many calamities for the sake of life, as having in itself something naturally sweet and desirable.
It is easy to point out the different received modes of government, and we often lay them down in our exoteric2 discourses.
The power of the master, though there is an identity of interest between him who is by nature a master and him who is by nature a slave, yet nevertheless tends especially to the benefit of the master, but accidentally to that of the slave;
for if the slave is destroyed, the power of the master is at an end.
But the authority which a man has over his wife, and children, and his family, which we call domestic government, is either for the benefit of those who Distinctions of government in domestic life.
are under subjection, or else for the sake of something com- mon to both ;
but its essential object is the benefit of the go­ verned, as we see in other arts, (in physic, for instance, and the gymnastic exercises,) but accidentally it may be for the sake of those who govern ;
for nothing forbids the master of the exercises from sometimes being himself one of those who take exercise, as the steersman is always one of the sailors;
but both the master of the exercises and the steersman con­ sider the good of those who are under their government.
But when either of them becomes one of these, it is by acci­ dent that he shares in their benefits;
for the one becomes a common sailor, and the other one of the wrestlers, though he is Governments differ accord­ ing to the end which they have in view.
master of the exercises.
Thus in all political governments, which are established upon the prin­ ciple of an equality of the citizens, and accord­ ing to similitude, it is held right to rule by turns.
Formerly, as was natural, every one expected that each of his fellow-citizens should in his turn 1 serve the public, and thus administer to his private good, as he himself when in office had done for others.
But now every one is desirous of being continually in power, that he may enjoy the advantage which he derives from public business and being in office;
as if offices were a never-failing remedy for sickly rulers;
for if this were so, no doubt they would be eagerly sought after.
What govern­ ments are proper.
It is evident, then, that all those governments which have the common good in view, are rightly established and strictly j ust;
but that those which have in view only the good of the rulers, are all founded on wrong principles, and are widely different from what a go­ vernment ought to be ;
for they are tyrannical;
whereas a state is a community of freemen.
HAVING established these particulars, the next point is to consider how many different kinds of governments there are, and what they are;
and first we must review those of them which are correct;
for when we have determined this, their deflections will be evident enough.
It is evident that every form of government or administration, (for the words are of the same im­ port,) must contain the supreme power over the The forms of government laid down.
whole state, and that this supreme power must necessity be in the hands of one person, or of a few, or of the man be­ and that when the one, the few, or the many direct their p< licy to the common good, such states are well governed:
buar­ when the interest of the one, the few, or the many who are in office, is alone consulted, a perversion takes place;
for we must either affirm that those who share in the community are not citizens, or else let these share in the advantages of govern­ ment.
Now we usually call a state which is go­ verned by one person for the common good, a 1.

kingdom;
one that is governed by more than one, but by a few only, an aristocracy;
either because the go­ vernment is in the hands of the most worthy 2.

citizens, or because it is the best form for the city, and its in­ habitants.
But when the citizens at large direct their policy to the public good, it is called simply a polity;
a name which is common to all other 3.
Polity or free state.
governments.
And this distinction is consonant to reason;
for it will be easy to find one person, or a very few, of very distinguished abilities, but most difficult to meet with the majority of a people eminent for every virtue ;
but if there is one common to a whole nation it is valour;
for this exists among numbers:
for which reason, in this state the military have most power, and those who possess arms will have their share in the government.
Now the perversions attending each of these governments are these ;
a kingdom may degenerate into a tyranny, an aris­ tocracy into an oligarchy, and a. state into a de­ mocracy.
Now a tyranny is a monarchy where The corruption of each severa form.

2. Oligarchy.
3. Democracy.
the good of one man only is the object of government, an oligarchy considers only the rich, and a democracy only the poor;
but neither of them have the common good of all in view.
1IT will be necessary to enlarge a little more upon the nature of each of these forms of government;
and this is a matter which includes some difficulties ;
for he who would enter into a phi­ losophical inquiry into their principles, and not content him­ self with a mere practical view of them, must pass over and omit nothing, but explain the true spirit of each of them.
A tyranny then is, as has been said, a monarchy where one person has a despotic power over the whole community:
an oligarchy, where the supreme power of the state is lodged with the rich:
a democracy, on the contrary, is where it is in Difficulties re­ sulting from the above division.
the hands of those who are worth little or nothing.
But the first difficulty that arises from the dis­ tinction laid down is this;
should it happen that the majority of the inhabitants who possess the power of the state (for this is a democracy) are rich, the question is, how does this agree with what we have said ?
The same difficulty occurs, should it ever happen that the poor compose a smaller part of the people than the rich, but from their superior abilities acquire the supreme power;
(for this is what they call an oligarchy:
) it would seem then that our definition of the different forms of government was not cor­ rect ;
nay, moreover, could any one suppose that the majority of the people were poor, and the minority rich, and then de­ scribe the state in this manner, that an oligarchy was a government in which the rich, being few in number, possessed the supreme power, and that a democracy was a state in which the poor, being many in number, possessed it, still there will be another difficulty;
for what name shall we give to those states which we have been describing ?
we mean, that in which the greater number are rich, and that in which the lesser number are poor, where each of these respectively pos­ sess the supreme power?
If there are no other forms of government besides those we have described, it seems there­ fore evident to reason, that it may be a mere accident whether the supreme power is vested in the hands of many or few;
but that it is clear enough, that when it is in the hands of the few, it will be a government of the rich ;
when in the hands of the many, it will be a government of the poor ;
since in all countries there are many poor and few rich.
It is not there­ fore the cause that has been already assigned, namely, the number of people in power, which makes the difference be­ tween the two forms of government;
but an oli­ garchy and a democracy differ in this from each other, namely, in the poverty of those who go-

vern in the one, and the riches of those who govern in the other;
for when the government is in the hands of the rich, be they few or be they more, it is an oligarchy;
when it is in the hands of the poor, it is a democracy.
But, as we have already said, the one will be always few, the other numerous ;
for few enjoy riches, but all enjoy liberty;
and hence will arise continual disputes with each other for the lead in public affairs.
LET us first determine what they lay down as the proper limits of an oligarchy and a democracy, and what is just in each of these forms of go-An oligarchy and democracy limited.
vernment.
For all men have some natural inclination to justice, but they proceed therein only to a certain degree ;
nor can they universally point out what is absolutely just.)
For instance, what is equal appears just, and is so, but not to all, only among those who are equals ;
and what is unequal ap­ pears just, and is so, but not to all, only amongst those who are unequals.
This relative nature of justice some people neglect, and therefore they judge ill;
and the reason of this is, that they judge for themselves, and.
almost everyone is the worst judge in his own cause.
Since then justice has reference to persons, the same distinctions must be made with Justice ia re­ respect to persons, which are made with respect to things, in the manner that I have already described in my Ethics.
1
As to the equality of the things, they are agreed;
but their dispute is concerning the equality of the persons, and chiefly for the reason above assigned, because they judge ill in their own cause;
and also because each party thinks, that if they admit what is right in some particulars, they say what is just on the whole.
Thus, for instance, if some per­ sons are unequal in riches, they suppose them unequal in the whole;
or on the contrary, if they are equal in liberty, they suppose them equal in the whole.
But they forget that which is the essential point;
for if civil society was founded for the sake of preserving and increasing property, every one's right in the state would be in proportion to his fortune;
and then the reasoning of those who insist upon an oligarchy would be valid ;
for it would not be right that he who contributed one mina should have an equal share in the hundred, along with him who brought in all the rest, either of the original money or Civil society, why founded.
of what was afterwards acquired.
Nor was civil society founded merely in order that its members might live, but that they might live well)—(for otherwise a state might be composed of slaves, or of the ani­ mal creation ;
which is far from the case, because these have no share in happiness, nor do they live after their own choice ;
) -nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from in­ juries, or for a commercial intercourse;
for then the Tyr­ rhenians, and Carthaginians, and all other nations between whom treaties of commerce subsist, would be citizens of one state.
For they have articles to regulate their imports, and engagements for mutual protection, and alliances for mutual defence;
yet still they have not all the same magistrates established among them, but they are different among differ­ ent people;
nor does the one take any care that the morals of the other should be as they ought, or that none of those who have entered into the common agreements should be unjust, or in any degree vicious, but only that they shall not injure another confederate.
But whosoever endeavours to establish wholesome laws in a state, attends to the virtues Virtue the end of legislation.
and the vices of each individual who composes it;
and hence it is evident that the first care of a man who would found a state truly deserving that name, and not nominally so, must be to have his citizens virtuous;
1 for otherwise it is merely an alliance for self- defence, differing only in place from those which are made between different people.
For the law is an agreement, and as the sophist Lycophron says, a pledge between the citizens of their intending to do justice to each other, though not suf­ ficient to make all the citizens just and good.
And it is evident that this is the fact;
for could any one bring different places together, as, for instance, Megara and Corinth, within the same walls, yet they would not be one state, not even if their inhabitants intermarried with each other, though this inter-community contributes much to combine people into one state.
Besides, could we suppose a set of people living separ­ ate from each other, but within such a distance as would ad­ init of an intercourse, and that there were laws subsisting between each party to prevent their injuring one another in their mutual dealings,—(one being a carpenter, another a husbandman, another a shoemaker, and the like,)—and that their numbers were ten thousand, and still that they had nothing in common but a tariff for trade, or an alliance for mutual defence, even so they would not constitute a state.
And why in the How a city or state differs from a mere confederacy.
world?
Not because their mutual intercourse is not near enough ;
for even if persons so situated should come to one place, and every one should live in his own house as in his native city, and there should be alliances subsisting between each party, mutually to assist and prevent any injury being done to the other, still they would not be admitted to be a city by those who reason correctly, if they preserved the same customs when they were together as when they were separate.
It is evident, then, that a state is not a mere community of place, nor established for the sake of mutual safety or traffic ;
but that these things are the necessary consequences of a state, although they may all exist where there is no state;
but What a πόλις really is.
a state is a society ot people joining together with their families, and their children, to live well, for the sake of a perfect and independent life;
and for this purpose it is necessary that they should live in one place, and intermarry with each other.
Hence in all cities there are family meetings, clubs, sacrifices, and public enter­ tainments, to promote friendship ;
1 for a love of sociability is friendship itself;
so that the end for which a state is estab­ lished is that the inhabitants of it may live happily ;
and these things are conducive to that end ;
for it is a community of fa­ milies and villages, formed for the sake of a perfect independ­ ent life;
that is, as we have already said, for the sake of living Its end.
well and happily.
2
The political state therefore is founded not for the purpose of men's merely living together, but for their living as men ought;
for which reason those who contribute most to this end deserve to have greater power in the state than either those who are their equals in family and freedom, but their inferiors in civil virtue, or those who excel them in wealth, but are below them in worth.
It is evident from what has been said, that in all disputes upon forms of government each party says something that is just.
Who should possess su­ preme power in the state.
THERE may also be a doubt as to who should possess the supreme power of the state.
Shall it be the majority, or the wealthy, or a number of proper persons, or one better than the rest, or a tyrant ?
But whichever of these we prefer, some difficulty will arise.
For what?
if the poor, because they are the majority, may divide among themselves what belongs to the rich, is not this unjust ?
In Certain diffi­ culties consi­ dered.
I. Shall it be in the hands of the many ?
sooth, by heaven, it will have been judged just enough by the multitude when they gain the supreme power.
What there­ fore is the extremity of injustice, if this is not?
Again, if the many seize into their own hands every thing which be­ longs to the few, it is evident that the state will be at an end.
But virtue never tends to destroy what is itself virtuous ;
nor can what is right be the ruin of the state.
Therefore such a law can never be right;
nor can the acts of a tyrant ever be wrong, for of necessity they must all be just;
for, from his unlimited power, he compels every one to obey his command, as the multitude oppress the rich.
Is it right then that the rich and few should have the su­ preme power ?
and what if they be guilty of the 2.

same rapine, and(plunder the possessions of the majority will this be just ?
It will be the same as in the other case ;
but it is evident that all things of this sort are wrong and unjust.
Well then, suppose that those of the better sort shall have the supreme power, must not then all the other citizens live unhonoured, without sharing 3.
Or of the best ?
the offices of the state ?
for the offices of a state we call honours, and if one set of men are always in power, it is evi­ dent that the rest must be without honours.
Then, will it be better that the supreme power be in the hands of that one person who is fittest for it ?
but by this means the power will be still more confined, for a greater number than before will continue unhonoured.
But some one may say, that, in short, it is wrong that man should have the supreme power rather than the law, as his soul is subject to so many passions.
But if this law appoints an aristocracy, or a democracy, how will it help us in our present doubts ?
for those things wil) happen which we have already mentioned.
OF other particulars, then, let us treat hereafter;
but as to the fact that the supreme power ought Reasons for vesting the preme power with the many.
to be lodged with the many, rather than with those of the better sort, who are few, there would seem to be some doubt, though also some truth as well1 Now, though each individual of the many may himself be unfit for the supreme power, yet, when these many are joined together, it is possible that they may be better qualified for it, than the others ;
and this not separately, but as a collective body.
So the public suppers exceed those which are given at one per­ son's private expense :
for, as they are many, each person brings in his share of virtue and wisdom ;
(and thus, coming together, they are like one man made up of a multitude, with many feet, many hands, and many senses.)
Thus is it with respect to the character and understanding.
And for this reason the many are the best j udges of music and poetry ;
for some understand one part, some another, and all collectively the whole.
And in this particular men of consequence differ from each of the many;
as they say those who are beautiful differ from those who are not so, and as fine pictures excel any natural objects, by collecting into one the several beautiful parts which were dispersed among different originals, although the separate parts of individuals, as the eye or any other part, may be handsomer than in the picture.
But it is not clear whether it is possible that this distinction should exist between every people and general assembly, and some few men of con­ sequence ;
but, by heaven, doubtless it is clear enough that, with respect to a few, it is impossible ;
since the same conclu­ sion might be applied even to brutes:
and indeed, so to say, wherein do some men differ from brutes?
But nothing pre­ vents what I have said being true of the people in some states.
The question decided.
The doubt, then, which we have lately proposed, with that which is its consequence, may be settled in this manner;
it is necessary that he freemen and the bulk of the people should have absolute power in some things;
but(these are such as are not men of property, nor have they any reputation for virtueJ
And so it is not safe to trust them with the first offices in the state, both on account of their injustice and their ignorance ;
from the one of which they are likely to do what is wrong, from the other to make mistakes.
And yet it is dangerous to allow them no power or share in the government for when there are many poor people who are
The people should be su­ preme in some things, but not in others.
excluded from office, the state must necessarily have very many enemies in it.
It remains, then, that they should have a place in the public assemblies, and in determining causes.
And for this reason Socrates and some other legislators give them the power of electing the officers of the state, and also of inquiring into their conduct after their term of office, but do not allow them to act as magistrates by themselves.
For the multitude, when they are collected together, have all of them sufficient understanding for these pur­ poses, and by mixing among those of higher rank

are serviceable to the state;
as some things which alone are improper for food, when mixed with others, make the whole more wholesome than a few of them would be;
though each individual is unfit to form a judgment by himself.
But there is a difficulty attending this form of government;
for it seems that the same person, who himself was capable of curing any one who was then sick, must be the best judge who to employ as a physician ;
but such a one must be himself a physician.
And the same holds true in every other practice and art:
and as a physician ought to give an account of his practice to physicians, so ought it to be in other arts.
But phy­ sicians are of three sorts;
the first makes up the medicines;
the second prescribes;
the third understands the science, but never practises it.
Now these three distinctions may be found in those who understand all other arts;
and we have no less opinion of their judgment who are only instructed in the principles of the art, than of those who practise it.
And with respect to elections the same would seem to hold true ;
for to elect a proper person in any line, is the business of those who are skilled in it;
as in geometry, it is the part of geometricians, and of Who should have the power of electing magistrates ?
steersmen in the art of steering. )
But even if some individuals do know something of particular arts and works, they do not know more than the professors of them;
so that, even upon this principle, neither the election of magistrates, nor the cen­ sure of their conduct, should be intrusted to the many.
But possibly much that has been here said may not be right;
for, to resume the argument lately used, if the people are not very brutal indeed, although we allow that each individual knows less of these affairs than those who have given particular attention to them, yet when they come together they will know them better, or at least not worse:
besides, in some particular arts it is not the workman only who is the best judge, as in those the works of which are understood by those who do not profess them.
Thus he who builds a house is not the only judge of it, (for the master of the family who inhabits it is a better one;
) thus also a steersman is a better judge of a tiller than he who made it, and he who gives an entertain­ ment than the cook.
What has been said seems a sufficient solution of this difficulty;
but there is another that follows :
for it seems absurd that greater power in the state should be lodged with the bad than with the good.
Now the power of election and censure are of the very utmost consequence, and this, as has been said, in some states they intrust to the people :
for the general assembly is the supreme court of all.
And yet they have a voice in this court, and deliberate on all public affairs, and try all causes, without any objection to the mean­ ness of their circumstances, and at any age:
but their quæs­ tors, generals, and other great officers of state are taken from The question determined.
men of high condition, ibis difficulty, then, may be solved upon the same principle ;
and here too they may be right.
For the power is not in the man who is member of the assembly or council, but in the assembly itself, and in the council and people, of which each individual of the whole community forms a part, as senator, adviser, or judge.
And for this reason it is very right that the many should have the greatest powers in their own hands ;
for the people, the council, and the judges are composed of them, and the property of all these collectively is more than the property of any person, or of a few who fill the great offices of the state :
and thus let us determine these points.
But the first question that we stated shows nothing besides Supremacy of the law.
so plainly, as that the supreme power should be lodged in laws duly made, and that the magistrate, or magistrates, (either one or more,) should bo authorized to determine those cases on which the laws cannot define particularly;
as it is impossible for them, in general language, to explain themselves upon every thing that may arise.
But what these laws are, which are established upon the best foundations, has not been yet explained, but still remains a matter of some question:
but the laws of every state will necessarily be like the state itself, either trifling or excellent, just or unjust;
for it is evident, that the laws which are framed, must correspond to the constitution of the government;
and, if so, it is Laws good or bad, a test of governments.
plain, that a well-formed government will have good laws, a bad one, bad ones.
SINCE in every art and science the end aimed at is always good, the greatest good is particularly the end of that which is the most excellent of all, and this is the political science :
the political
The chief good the end of the political sci­ ence.
good is justice ;
for this, in other words, is the interest of all.
Now, it is the common opinion, that justice is a certain equal­ ity ;
and up to a certain point men agree with the teaching of philosophers, when they lay down definitions of morals :
for they say what is just, and to whom;
and that equals ought to receive equal;
but we should know how to determine of what things there is equality, and of what there is an in­ equality ;
and in this there is some difficulty, which calls for the philosophy of the writer on morals.
Some persons will probably say that the offices of state ought unequally to be given according to every particular excellence of each citizen, if there is no other difference between them and the rest of the community, but they are in every respect else alike:
for to persons who differ from Justice abso­ lute and rela­ tive.
each other, justice is one thing and that which is according to worth is another.
But if this is admitted to be true, com­ plexion, or height, or any such advantage will be made by the superiors a means of grasping for a greater share of the public rights.
But, surely, this is evidently absurd;
as is clear from the other arts and sciences;
for with respect to musicians who are equal in their art, the best flute is not to be given to those who are of the best family, for they will play never the better for that, but the best instrument ought to be given to him who is the best artist.
But if what is now said does not make this clear, we will explain it still further:
if there should be any one who is a very excellent player on the flute, but very deficient in family and beauty, (though each of these are more valuable endowments than a skill in music, and excel this art in a higher degree than that player excels others,) yet the best flutes ought to he given to him ;
for the superiority in beauty and fortune should have a reference to the business in hand;
but these have none.
Moreover, ac­ cording to this reasoning, every possible excellence might be brought into comparison with every other ;
for if some bodily strength might dispute the point with riches or liberty, even any amount of strength might do it;
so that if one person excelled in size more than another did in virtue, and if, in short, bodily size was a thing more excellent than virtue, all things must then admit of a comparison with each other.
For if such a size is greater than virtue by so much, it is evident that another size must be equal to it.
Since, however, this is impossible, it is plain that it would be contrary to common sense to dispute a right to any office in the state according to every point of superiority whatsoever :
for if one set of persons be slow, and another swift, neither are the one better qualified, A claim to office must be based on due qualification for the particu­ lar place.
nor the other worse, on that account;
though in the gymnastic races a difference in these particu­ lars will gain the prize ;
but a pretension to offices of state should be founded on those qualifications which are part of itself.
And for this reason, men of family, independence, and fortune, with great propriety contend with each other for office;
for those who hold office ought to be persons of independence and property:
for a state can no more consist of all poor men, than it can of all slaves.
But although such persons are requisite, it is evident that there is an equal need of justice and military valour.
For without justice and valour, no state can be supported;
just as without the former class a state cannot exist, and without the latter it cannot be well governed.
IT seems then requisite that all, or at least many, of these points should vie together towards the establishment of a state ;
but virtue and education may most justly dispute the right of being consi- Virtue and educati n the means towards happiness.
dered as the necessary means of enabling the citizens to live well, as we have already said.
But as those who are equal in one particular need not therefore be equal in all, and those who are unequal in one particular need not therefore be unequal in all;
it follows of necessity, that all governments which are established upon such a principle are erroneous.
We have already said that all the members of the commu­ nity will dispute with each other for the offices of the state;
and to a certain extent justly, but ab­ stractedly not so in general;
the rich, for instance, Rival claims to office.

because they have the greatest landed property, and because the ultimate right to the soil is vested in the community ;
and also because their fidelity in contracts is in general most to be depended on.

on an equality;
for these latter have a right to higher regard as citizens than obscure persons:
for honourable descent is every where of great esteem ;
and further, it is reasonable to expect that the descendants of men of worth will be men of worth themselves ;
for noble birth is the virtue of a family.
For the same reason also we shall justly say that virtue has a right to put in her pretensions;
for Of the virtuous.
justice, we say, is a social virtue, and all others must yield her the precedence.
Let us now see what the many have to urge on their side against the few;
Of the many.
they may say, that it each are collectively taken and compared, the many are stronger, richer, and better than the others.
But should it ever happen that all these should inhabit the same city, I mean the good, the rich, the noble, as well as the many, such as usually make up the community, I ask, will there be any reason to dispute concerning who shall govern, or will there not ?
for in every community which we have mentioned, there is no dispute as to who ought to rule ;
for t^cfiy differ from each other in those who have the chief power.
For in one state the rich enjoy it, in another the me­ ritorious, and thus, each according to their separate manners.
Certain diffi­ culties solved.
Let us however consider what is to be done when all these happen at the same time to inhabit the city.
If the virtuous should be very few in num­ her, how shall we then decide ?
shall we direct our attention to their fewness as compared with their work, if they are capable of governing the state ?
or should they be so many as to compose a state ?
There is also a doubt concerning the pretensions of all those who claim the honours of government:
for those who found them either on their fortune or their family would seem to have nothing which they can justly say in their defence;
since it is evident upon their principle, that if any one person can be found richer than all the rest, the right of governing all these will be justly vested in this one person.
In the same manner, one man who is of the best family will claim it from those who dispute the point upon family merit;
and probably in an aristocracy the same dispute might arise on the score of virtue;
for if there is one man better than all the other men of worth, who are in the same community, it is requisite on the same plea of justice, that he should enjoy the supreme power.
In like manner also, while the many suppose that they ought to have the supreme com­ mand, as being more powerful than the few, if one, or more than one, though it be a small number, should be found stronger than themselves, these ought rather to have it than they.
All these things seem to make it plain, that none of these principles are justly founded, on which these persons would establish their right to the supreme power, and that all men whatsoever ought to obey them;
for with respect to those who claim it as due to their virtue or their fortune, the multitude might justly have - some objection to make, which they could jointly urge against them ;
for nothing hinders but that it may sometimes happen, that the many may be better or richer than the few, not as individuals, but in their col­ lective capacity.
As to the doubt which some persons raise and propose, we may answer it in this manner;
it is this, whether a legislator who would estab­ lish the most perfect system of laws, should cal­ culate them for the use of the better part of the citizens, or of the many, under the circumstances
Should a legis­ lator lay down laws for the benefit of the many, or of the few ?
we have already mentioned?
The rectitude of any thing must be assumed to consist in its equality;
that therefore which is equally right, will be advantageous to the whole state, and to every member of it in common.
Now, in general, a citizen is one who shares in the government, and also in his turn submits to be governed;
but his condition is different in different states;
the best is that in which a man is enabled to choose both to govern and to be governed with regard to virtue during his whole life.
But should there be found one person, or a very few, eminent for an uncommon degree of virtue, though not enough to make up a civil state, so that the virtue or political abilities of the many are unable to come into comparison with theirs, if more than one ;
or if there be but one, with his abilities alone ;
such are not to be considered as part of the state;
for it would be doing them injustice to rate them on How to deal with the per­ fectly virtuous man.
a level with those who are so far their inferiors in virtue and political abilities ;
for it is fit that such an one should appear to them like a god amongst men.
1
Hence it is evident, that a system of laws must be calculated for those who are equal to each other in nature and power.
Such men therefore are not the object of law, for they are themselves a law;
and it would be ridiculous in any one to endeavour to include them in legislation ;
for probably they might say what Antisthenes tells us the lions did to the bares, when they harangued and demanded an equal share with them in the government.
And it is on this account that democratic states have established Ostracism;
2 for of a truth equality seems the principal object of their government.
The real prin­ ciple of ostra­ cism.
And for this reason they ostracise all those who are very eminent for their power, their fortune, their friendships, or any other cause which may give them too great weight in the government, and force them to leave the city for a stated time ;
as the fabulous histories relate the Argonauts left Her­ cules behind, for they were unwilling that he should command the ship Argo together with the rest, because he excelled the other sailors in valour.
For which reason those who hate a tyranny, and find fault with the advice which Periander gave to Thrasybulus,l must not think that they are wholly right in their course.
For the story goes, that Periander said nothing to the messenger sent to him with reference to the matter of advice, but that he struck off those ears of corn which were higher than the rest, and so reduced the whole crop to a level;
so that the messenger, without knowing the cause of what was done, related the fact to Thrasybulus, who understood from it that he must take off all the principal men in the city.
Nor is this serviceable to tyrants only, nor is it tyrants only who do it;
for the same thing is practised both in oligarchies and democracies :
for the ostracism has in a manner nearly the same power, by restraining and banishing those who The same prin­ ciple prevails in tyrannies, oligarchies, and democra­ cies.
are too great.
And the very same thing is done also by those who have the supreme power in the cities and separate states ;
as by the Athenians, with respect to the Samians, the Chians, and the Lesbians;
1 for when suddenly they had acquired a firm sway over Greece, they brought the other states into subjection, contrary to the treaties which subsisted between them.
The king of Persia also very often has reduced the Medes and Babylonians, when they have assumed a tone of arrogance on account of their former power.
And this is a principle on which all governments act, even those which are best administered:
those which are corrupted do it for the sake of private utility, and this also takes place in like man­ ner in polities which look to the common good.
The same thing is to be perceived in the other arts and sciences;
for a painter would not represent an animal with a foot large be­ yond proportion, though he had drawn it remarkably beau­ tiful ;
nor would the shipwright make the prow, or any other part of the vessel, larger than it ought to be ;
nor will the mas­ ter of the chorus permit any one who sings louder and better than the rest, to sing in concert with them.
There is there­ fore no reason why a monarch should not act in agreement with free states, to support his own power, if they do the same thing for the benefit of their respective communities;
upon which account when there is any acknowledged disparity # in the power of the citizens, the reason upon which the ostra­ cism is founded will be politically just.
It is better indeed for the legislator so to establish his state at the beginning as not to want this remedy:
Prevention better than cure.
but, in the second place, if in course of time such an incon­ venience should arise, to endeavour to amend it by some such correction.
This certainly was not done in the states ;
for they did not regard the benefit of their respective communitiet, but used the ostracism for party purposes.'
It is evident, then, that in corrupt governments it is partly just and useful in an individual case, though probably it is as clear that it is not absolutely just:
for in a well-governed state there may be great doubts about the use of it, not on account of the su­ periority which one may have in strength, riches, or friends;
but when the point of superiority is virtue, what then is to be done ?
for it seems not right to turn out such a person, and to banish him;
neither does it seem right to subject him to control;
for that would be like desiring to share the power with Jupiter, and to govern him.
Nothing then remains but The perfectly virtuous cha­ racter to be chosen king.
what indeed seems natural, and that is, for all persons quietly to submit to one who is thus emi­ nently virtuous, and to let such men be perpetu * ally kings in the respective states.
Monarchy.
AFTER what has been now said, it would seem proper to change our subject, and to inquire into the nature of a monarchy;
for we admit this to be one of those species of government which are properly founded.
And here let us consider, whether a kingly government is proper or not for a city or country which desires to be well governed, or whether some other polity is proper.
But let us first deter­ mine whether this is of one kind only or more.
Now it is easy
Of many kinds.
1st, At Sparta.
enough to perceive that it consists of many dif­ ferent species, and that the forms of government are not the same in all states;
for at Sparta the kingly power seems chiefly regulated by the laws;
2 for it is not supreme in all circumstances ;
but when the king quits the territories of the state, he is their general in matters of war ;
and all religious affairs are intrusted to the king.
In­ deed, the kingly power with them is chiefly that of a general who cannot be called to account for his conduct, and whose command is for life:
for he has not the power of life and death, except as a general;
as the ancients frequently had in their expeditions by martial law, which we learn from Homer;
for when Agamemnon was affronted in the council, he restrained his resentment, but when he was in the field, he had the power of life and death.
At any rate, he says, " Whoe'er this day shall shun th' impending fight, To dogs and vultures soon shall be a prey ;
For in my hands is death."
II. v. 391.
This then is one species of monarchical government, in which a man is made general for life ;
and it is sometimes hereditary, sometimes elective.
But besides this, there is also another, which is to be met with among some of the barbarians.
In these states the kings are 2nd.

invested with powers nearly equal to those of a tyrant, yet are they nevertheless bound by the laws and the customs of their country.
For as the barbarians1 are by nature more prone to slavery than the Greeks, and those about Asia more than those in Europe, they endure a despotic government without murmuring.
For this reason their governments are tyran­ nical ;
but yet not liable to be overthrown, as being customary and according to law.
Their guards also are such as are used in a kingly government, not in a despotic one;
for the guards of kings are composed of his citizens, but those of a tyrant are foreign mercenaries.
The one according to law rules over willing subjects;
the other arbitrarily rules over those who consent not.
The one therefore is guarded by the citizens, 3rd.
Elective tyrannies in ancient Greece.
the other against them.
These, then, are two different sorts of monarchies ;
and another is that which, among the ancient Greeks, is called an Æsymnety;
1 which, speaking simply, is nothing more than an elective tyranny;
and its difference from that which is to be found amongst the barbarians, consists not in its not being according to law, but only in its not being according to an­ cient customs.
Some persons possessed this power for life, others only for a particular time or purpose;
as the people of Mitylene elected Pittacus to oppose the exiles, who were headed by Antimenides and Alcæus the poet.
And Alcæus himself, in one of his songs, proves this fact;
for he upbraids the Mitylenians for having chosen Pittacus for their tyrant, and with one voice extolling him to the skies, though he was the ruin of a senseless and devoted people.
These sorts of government then are, and ever were, despotic, on account of their being tyrannies ;
but inasmuch as they are elective, and 4th.
The heroic.
over willing subjects, they are also kingly.
A fourth species of kingly government is that which was in use in the heroic times, when a free people submitted to a kingly government, according to the laws and customs of their country.
2
For those who were at first of benefit to mankind either in arts or arms, or by collecting them into civil society, or by granting them possessions, became kings over a willing people, and handed on the monarchy to their successors.
1
They were also their generals in war, and pre­ sided over their sacrifices, excepting such only as belonged to the priests :
in addition to this they were supreme judges in lawsuits;
and in this case some of them took an oath, others did not;
when they did, the form of swearing was by lifting up their sceptre.
2
In ancient times the power of the kings extended to every thing whatsoever, both civil, domestic, and foreign ;
but in after-
Kingly power gradually abridged.
times they relinquished some of their privileges, and others the people assumed;
so that, in some states, they left their kings only the right of presiding over the sacrifices;
and even those whom it is worth while to call by that name, had only the right of being commander-in-chief in their foreign wars.
These then are the four sorts of kingdoms :
the first is that of the heroic times ;
which was a Recapitulation.
government over a free people, with limited rights in some particulars ;
for the king was their general, their judge, and their high priest.
3
The second, that of the barbarians;
which is an hereditary despotic government, regulated by laws:
the third is that which they call Æsymnetic, which is an elective tyranny.
The fourth is the Lacedasmonian ;
and this, in a few words, is nothing more than an hereditary ge­ neralship :
and in these particulars they differ from each other.
There is a fifth species of kingly government, which is where one person has a supreme power over all things whatsoever, in the manner that every tribe and every state is supreme over those things which belong to the public:
for as the master of a family has a kingly rule in his own house, so a king is master of his own state, and over one or more tribes.
The four kinds maybe re­ duced to two.
The first, and fourth.
Now the different sorts of kingly governments, so to say, may be reduced to two;
which we must consider more particularly ;
that of which we have spoken, and the Lacedæmonian ;
for the greater part of the others lie between these, inasmuch as they have less power than an absolute monarchy, and yet more than the Lacedæmonians.
So that the matter in question may be re­ duced to these two points ;
the one is, whether it is advan­ tageous or not to the citizens to have the office of general con­ tinued in one person for life, and whether this should be by family right to the succession ;
the other, whether it is advan­ tageous for one person to have the supreme power over every

thing or not.
But to enter into the particulars concerning the office of a Lacedæmonian general, would concern a treatise on laws rather than to political science ;
since we know that this is what is done in all forms of governments ;
so that we must pass over this The latter con­ sidered.
question,
The other kind of monarchy is a regu­ lar kind of polity;
and it will be necessary to examine particularly into this matter, and to run over such difficulties as may arise.
Now the beginning of our consideration is this, whether it is best to be governed by the Reasons for approving monarchy.
best of men, or by the best of laws ?
Those who prefer a kingly government think that laws only speak a general language, but cannot adapt them­ selves to particular circumstances;
for which reason it is absurd in any science to follow a mere written rule ;
and even in Egypt the physician was allowed to alter the mode of cure which the law prescribed to him, after the fourth day;
but if he did it sooner it was at his own peril.
Hence it is evident, on the very same account, that a government according to written laws is not the best;
and yet general reasoning is necessary to all those who are to govern, and it will be much more perfect in him who is entirely free from passions, than in him to whom they are natural.
In the law indeed this quality does not exist;
while the other of necessity belongs to every human soul.
But some one perchance may say, in answer to this, that man will be a better judge of particulars.
It will be necessary, then, for a king to be a legislator, and that his laws should be published, but that they should have no authority where they are absurd, but that in all other cases they should have authority.
But is it better for the commu­ nity that those things which cannot possibly come under the cognizance of the law at all, or properly, should be under the government of every worthy citizen ?
for at the present day they come together, and act as judges and counsellors, and decide eases;
but all their decisions are upon particular mat­ ters.
1
For one individual, be he who he will, will be found upon comparison inferior to a whole people taken collectively:
but a state, as composed Contrary reasons.
of many, is, as a public entertainment, better than one man'a portion ;
for which reason the multitude judge of many things better than any one single person.
The multitude are also less liable to corruption;
as water is from its quantity, so are the many less liable to corruption than the few :
besides, the judgment of an individual must necessarily be perverted, if he is overcome by anger, or any other passion;
but it would be hard indeed if the whole community should be misled by anger.
Moreover, let the people be composed of freemen, who do nothing contrary to the law, except only in those cases which the law necessarily omits.
But though the following may not easily be met with, yet if the majority of the state should happen to be good men, should one uncorrupt governor be preferred, or the.
majority who are all equally good ?
Is it not evident that the many should be preferred ?
for there may be divisions among them, but this cannot happen when there is but one.
In answer to this, it may be replied, that all their souls will be as much animated with virtue, as this one man's.
If then a government of the many, and all of them good men, must be laid down as composing an aristocracy, and the go-

Why the an­ cient states were under monarchies.
vernment of one, as a kingly power, it is evident, that an aristocracy is to be preferred to a monarchy, whether the state is powerful or not, if many such persons so alike can be found.
And for this reason probably it was, that the first governments were generally monarchies ;
because it was diffi­ cult to find a number of persons eminently vir­ tuous,1 more particularly as they then dwelt in small commu­ nities.
Besides, kings were appointed in return for the benefits they had conferred on mankind ;
and such actions are peculiar to good men.
But when many persons equal in virtue ap­ peared at the same time, they brooked not a superiority, but sought after equality, and established a free stated After this, when they degenerated, they made a property of the public;
which probably gave rise to oligarchies ;
for they Gradual suc­ cession of changes in an­ cient govern­ ments.
made wealth a mark of honour.
And this was the origin of tyrannies, and these in their turn gave rise to democracies ;
for as the power of the ty­ rants continually decreased, on account of their rapacious avarice, the people grew powerful enough to frame and establish democracies:
and as cities after that happened to increase, probably it was not easy for any other form of government to prevail beside a democracy.
But if any person prefers a kingly government in a state, we ask what is to be done with regard to the king's children ?
Is the family also to reign ?
But should they have such children as some persons usually have, it will be very detri­ mental.
It may be said, that then the king, who Some limita­ tions necessary in a monarchy.
has it in his power, will never give his kingdom to such chil­ dren.
But it is not easy to trust to that;
for it is very hard, and requires greater virtue than is to be met with in human nature.
There is also a doubt concerning the power with which a king should be intrusted, whether he should be allowed force sufficient to compel those who do not choose to be obe­ dient to the laws, and how he is to support his government ?
for if he is to govern according to law, and do nothing of his own will which is contrary thereto, at the same time it will be necessary that he should have some power with which to guard the law.
This matter however concerning a king may not be very difficult to determine ;
for he ought to have a proper power, and such a one as will be sufficient to make the king superior to any one person, or even to a large part of the community, but inferior to the whole;
just as the ancients always appointed guards for that person whom they created Æsymnete, or tyrant;
and some one advised the Syra­ cusans, when Dionysius asked for his guards, to allow him a certain number for his defence.
1absolute monarchy An con­ sidered.
IT follows next in order to consider the absolute monarch whom we have just mentioned, who does every thing according to his own will;
for a king governing under the direction of laws does not of himself con­ stitute any particular species of government, as we have al­ ready said ;
for in every state whatsoever, whether an aris­ tocracy or a democracy, it is easy to appoint a general for life ;
and there are many who intrust the administration of affairs to one person only ;
such is the government at Dyrrachium, and the same at Opus though in a less degree.
As for an absolute monarchy, as it is called, (that is to say, when the whole state is wholly subject to the will of one person, namely How far un­ natural.
the king, it seems to many to be unnatural that one man should have the entire rule over his fel­ low-citizens, when the state consists of equals ;
for nature requires that the same right, and the same rank, should necessarily exist amongst all those who are equal by na­ t ure;
for as it would be hurtful to the body, for those who are of different constitutions to observe the same regimen, either of diet, or clothing ;
so with respect to the honours of the state, it is as hurtful that those who are equal in merit should be unequal in rank.
And for this reason it is as much a man's duty to submit to command, as to assume it, and this also by rotation ;
for this is law, for order is law;
and it is more proper that the law should govern, than any one of the citizens.
Upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians and servants of the Shall man or law be su­ preme ?
laws, for the supreme power must be placed some­ where ;
but they say, that it is unjust that where all are equal, one person should continually enjoy it.
But man would scarcely be able to adjust that which the law cannot determine.
It may be replied, that the law having purposely laid down the best rules, leaves the rest to be ad­ justed by the most fair decision, and to be regulated by the magistrates ;
besides, it allows any thing to be altered, which experience proves may be better established.
Moreover, he who bids the law to be supreme, makes God supreme, [and the laws;
1] but he who intrusts man with supreme power, gives it to a wild beast, for such his appetites some times make him ;
passion, too, influences those who are in power, even the very best of men ;
for which reason the law is intellect free from appetite.
The instance taken from the arts seems fallacious:
wherein it is said to be wrong for a sick person to apply for a remedy to.
books, but that it would be far more eligible to employ those who are skilful in physic;
for these are not biassed by any feeling towards their patient to act contrary to the principles of their art;
but when the cure is performed, they receive a pecuniary recompence:
whereas those who have the management of public affairs, do many things through hatred or favour.
And, as a proof of what we have advanced, it may be observed, that whenever a sick person suspects that his physician has been persuaded by his enemies to be guilty of any foul practice to him in his profession, he then chooses rather to apply to books for his cure.
And not only this, but even physicians themselves, when they are ill, call in other physicians:
and those who teach others the gymnastic ex­ ercises practise with those of the same profession, as being incapable from self-partiality to form a proper judgment of what concerns themselves.
From whence it is evident, that those who seek for what is just, seek for a mean;
now the law is a mean.
Moreover, the moral law is far superior to the written law, and is conversant with far superior objects;
for the supreme magistrate is safer to be trusted to than the written one, though he is inferior to the moral law.
But as it is not easy for any one person to have an eye to every thing himself, it will be necessary that the supreme magistrate should employ several subordinate ones under him ;
why then should not this be done at first, instead of appointing one per­ son in this manner ?
Besides, if, according to what has been already said, the man of worth is on that account fit to govern, two men of worth are certainly better than one ;
as for in­ stance, in Homer, " Let two together go :
”2 and also Agamemnon's wish ;
“Were ten such faithful counsellors mine own! ” 3
Not but that there are even now some particular magistrates invested with supreme power to decide, as the judges, those things which the law cannot decide, as being one of those cases which comes not properly under its jurisdiction ;
for of those which can, there is no doubt.
Since then the laws com­ prehend some things, but not all, these points make it neces­ sary to inquire, and consider which of the two is preferable, that the best man, or the best law, should govern;
for it is impossible to reduce to law every subject which can come
The law needs a living expo­ nent.
And it is better to have many exponents than one alone.
under deliberation.
No one then denies that it is necessary that there should be some person to decide those cases, which cannot come under the cognizance of a written law ;
but we say, that it is better to have many than one;
-for every one who decides according to the principles of the law decides justly.
Yet surely it seems absurd to suppose, that one person can see better with two eyes, and hear better with two ears, or do better with two hands and two feet, than many can do with many;
for we see that absolute monarchs now furnish themselves with many eyes, and ears, and hands, and feet;
for they intrust those who are friends to themselves and their government with part of their power.
If they are not friends to the monarch, they will not do what he chooses ;
but if they are friends to him, they are friends also to his go­ vernment :
but a friend is an equal, and like his friend:
if then he thinks that such should govern, he thinks that those who are his equals and like himself should govern.
These are nearly the objections which men usually urge in dispute against kingly power.
Now, probably what we have said, may be true of some per­ sons, but not of others;
for some men are by nature formed to be under the government of a despot;
others, of a king;
others, again, to be citizens of a free state, sharing what is just and Tyranny and the other cor­ ruptions unna­ tural.
useful;
but a tyranny is not according to nature, nor is the perversion of any other government whatsoever;
for they are all contrary to it.
But it is evident from what has been said, that among equals it is neither advantageous nor right, that one person should be lord over all, either where there are no established laws, but where his will is the law, or where there are laws:
neither is it right that one who is good should have rule over those who are good;
or one who is not good, over those who are not good;
nor one who is superior to the rest in worth.
except in a particular manner;
and this manner shall be de­ scribed, though indeed it has been already mentioned.
But let us next determine what people are best qua­ lified for a kingly government, what for an aris­ tocratic, and what for a democratic.
And first, Who are best subjects for a monarchy ?
those who are accustomed by nature to submit themselves to the political rule of a family eminent for virtue, are adapted to kingly government.

while a people adapted to a free state is one among whom there is wont to be found a multitude formed by nature both to For a free state.
govern and be governed by laws, which admit the poor citi­ zens to a share of honours according to their worth.
But whenever a whole family, or any one of another, shall happen so far to excel in virtue as to surpass all other persons in the community, then it is right
When it is right to choose a monarch.
that the kingly power should be vested in them, or if it is an individual who does so, that he should be king and lord of all.
For this, as we have just mentioned, is not only corre­ spondent to that principle of right to which all founders of all states, whether aristocracies, oligarchies, or democracies, have a regard, (for they all regard excellence of some kind, though not the same excellence);
but it is also agreeable to what has been already said, as it would not be right to kill or banish or ostracise such an one for his superior merit.
Nor would it be proper to let him have the supreme power only in turn;
for it is contrary to nature, that what is highest should ever be lowest;
but this is the case, should such a one ever be governed by others.
So that nothing else can be done, but to submit and suffer him continually to enjoy the supreme power.
And with respect to kingly power in different states, whether it is or is not advantageous to them, and to what states, and in what manner, let thus much be laid down.
Since, then, we have said that there are three kinds of regular go- vernments, and since of these the best must necessarily be that which is administered by the best men,—(and this must be that which happens to have one man, or one family, or a number of persons, excelling all the rest in virtue, who are able to govern and be governed in such a manner as will make life most agreeable, and we have already shown that the virtue of a good man and of a citizen in the most perfect government will be the same,)—it is evident, that in the same manner, and by the same means, whereby a man becomes
The best prac­ tical form of government is an aristocracy or monarchy.
truly good, any one would compose a state in the shape of an aristocracy or monarchy;
so that it will be found to be education and morals that are almost the whole which go to make a good man, and that the same qualities will make a good citizen or good king.
1These particulars being treated of, we must next endeavour to consider what sort of government is best, how it naturally arises, and how it ought to be established.
Now it is neces­ sary that he who intends so to do, should make a proper in­ quiry concerning this point.
The practical province of arts.
IN all those arts and sciences which are not con­ versant with parts, but with some one genus, and are perfect, it is the business of each to determine what is fitted to its particular genus;
as what particular exercise is fitted to a particular body, and suits it best:
(for that body which is formed by nature the most beauti­ ful and most perfectly constructed, necessarily requires the best exercise ;
) and also what that one kind must be, which will suit most and all bodies, for this is the business of the gymnastic art.
And although any one should not desire to acquire an adequate knowledge and skill in these exercises, yet it is not, on that account, the less necessary that he who professes to be a master, and to instruct the youth in them, should be perfect therein.
And we see that this is what hap­ pens equally in the art of healing, ship-building, cloth-making, and indeed all other arts;
so that it evidently belongs to the same art to find out what kind of government is best, and would of all others be most correspondent to our wish, provid­ ing it received no impediment from without, and also what parti­ cular species of it is adapted to particular persons;
for there are many probably who are incapable of enjoying the best form.
So that the legislator, and he who is truly a politican, ought to be acquainted not only with that which is most perfect in the abstract, but also that which is the best suited under any given circumstances.'
There is, moreover, a third sort
The politician should study, not only theo­ retic, but practical ex­ cellence.
of polity, an imaginary one;
and he ought, if such a one should be presented to his consideration, to be able to discern how it would grow into being, and, when once established, what would be the proper means to preserve it for the longest time.
I mean, for instance, if a state should happen not to have the best form of government, or to be deficient even in what was necessary, or not to be as good as possible under existing circumstances, but something inferior.
And, besides all this, it is necessary to distinguish what sort of government is best fitting for all cities :
for most of those writers who have treated this subject, Fault of pre­ ceding writers.
however speciously they may handle other parts of it, have failed in describing the practical parts:
for it is not enough to be able to lay down scientifically what is best, but what can be put in practice.
It should also be simple, and easy for all to attain to.
But, contrary to this, they seek out only the most subtle form of government, and one which needs many things to fill it up.
Others again, choosing rather to treat of what is common, censure those which now exist, and extol the excellence of a particular state, as the Lacedæmonian, What the aim of a politician should be.
or some other.
But every legislator ought to establish such a form of government, as from the present state, and disposition of the people who are to receive it, they will most readily submit to, and persuade the community to partake of:
for it is not a business of less trouble to correct the mistakes of an established government, than to form a new one;
as it is equally difficult to recover what we have forgotten, and to learn any thing afresh.
The politician, therefore, besides all that we have already said, ought to be able to remedy the faults of a government already established, as we have before mentioned.
But this is im­ possible for a man who does not know the different forms of Hence the need of studying the various govern­ ments.
government:
some persons think, that there is only one species both of democracy and oligarchy ;
but this is not true:
so that no one should be un­ acquainted with the difference of these govern­ ments, how great they are, and in how many ways they are constituted.
And together with this practical wisdom, he ought to perceive what laws are best, and what are most suit­ able to each particular government:
for all laws ought to be framed, and are framed by all men, with reference to the state, and not the state with reference to the laws.
For government is a certain ordering in a state, which respects the magistrates as to the manner in which they are regulated, where the supreme power shall be placed;
and what is the final object which each community shall have in view.
But laws are something different from what expresses the form of the constitution ;
1 and according to them, the magistrate must rule and keep watch over those who transgress them.
And hence it is evident, that the founders of laws should attend to the different kinds and to the number of governments ;
for it is impossible that the same laws should be fitted to all sorts of oligarchies and democracies ;
for of both these governments there are many species, and not one only.
SINCE, then, according to our first method of treating the different forms of government, we Three kinds of government.
have divided those which are regular into three sorts, the kingly, the aristocratical, and the free state, and have shown their three corruptions respectively ;
-tyranny the corruption of monarchy;

much from this sort of government;
and that which is least hurtful is a democracy.
This subject has been already treated of by one of those writers who have gone before me,2 Plato's opinion.
though his views do not look the same way is mine;
for he thought, that a democracy was the worst of all excellent constitutions, as a good oligarchy, or the like, but the best of all bad ones.
Now I affirm that all these states without exception have fallen into excess;
and also it is not well to say that one oligarchy is better than another, but that it is not quite so bad.
But let us defer
How many kinds of free states there are.
this question for the present.
We must first in­ quire how many different sorts of free states there are ;
since there are many species of democracies and oligarchies ;
and which of them is the most comprehensive, and most desirable after the best form of government;
or if there is any other, aristocratic in its prin­ ciples, and well-established;
and also which of these is best adapted to most cities, and which of them is preferable for particular persons ;
-( for, probably, some may suit better with a violent oligarchy than with a democracy, and others better with the latter than the former;
)—and afterwards in what manner a man ought to proceed who desires to establish either of these states, I mean the several species of democracy and How govern­ ments arepre­ served and de­ stroyed.
of oligarchy.
And, to conclude, when we shall have briefly made mention of every thing that is necessary, we must endeavour to point out the sources of corruption and of stability in govern­ ments, as well those which are common to all, as those which are peculiar to each state, and from what causes they chiefly are wont to arise.
Why govern­ ments are of different kinds.
THE reason for there being many different sorts of governments is this, that each state consists of a great number of parts ;
1 for, in the first place, we see that all cities are made up of families:
and, again, out of the multitude of these some must be rich, some poor, and others in the middle station;
and that both of the rich and poor, some will be used to arms, and others not.
We see also that some of the common people are husbandmen, while others attend the market, and others are artificers.
There is also a difference between the nobles in their wealth, and the dignity which they maintain;
for instance, in the number of their horses ;
for this cannot be supported without a large fortune.
For this reason, in former times, those cities whose strength consisted in horse, became by that means oligarchies;
and they used horse in their expeditions against the neighbouring states which were at war with them;
as the Eretrians, the Chalcidians, and the Magnetians, who lived near the river Mæander, and many others about Asia.
Moreover, besides the difference of fortune, there is that which arises from family and from merit;
or, if there are any other distinctions which make part of the city, they have been already men­ tioned in treating of an aristocracy ;
1 (for there we considered of how many parts each city must necessarily be composed;
) and sometimes each of these have a share in the government, sometimes a few, sometimes more.
It is evident, then, that there must be many forms of govern­ ment, differing from each other in kind;
for the parts of which they are composed, each differ from As many forms of government as ranks in the .state.
the other.
For government is the ordering of the magis­ tracies of the state;
and these the community share between themselves, either as they can attain them by force, or accord­ ing to some common equality which there is amongst them, as poverty, wealth, or something of which they both partake.
There must therefore necessarily be as many different forms of governments as there are different ranks in the society, arising from the superiority of some over others, and their different situations.
And these seem chiefly to be two, as they say the winds are but two, namely, the north and the south ;
while all the others are declinations from these.
And thus in polities, there is the government of the many, and the government of the few;
or a democracy, and an oligarchy ;
for an aristocracy may be considered But resolvable into two main divisions.
1. That of the many.
2. That of the few.
as a species of oligarchy, as being also a government of the few;
and what we call a free state, may be considered as a democracy ;
as among the winds, they consider the west as part of the north, and the east as part of the south.
Thus, too, it is in music, according to some, who say that there are only two species of it, the Doric and the Phrygian, and who call all other species of composition after one of these names.
Many peo­ ple are accustomed to consider governments in the same light;
but it is both more convenient and more in accordance with truth, to distinguish governments, as I have done, into two species:
one of those established upon proper principles, so that while there are one or two sorts rightly constituted, the others are but excesses of these;
so that we may compare the best form of government to the best-tempered harmony ;
the oligarchic to the more violent and impassioned tunes;
and the democratic to the soft and gentle airs.
1Objections a­ gainst the cur­ rent definitions of democracy and oligarchy.
WE ought not, however, to define a democracy as some do now-a-days, who say simply that it is a government where the supreme power is lodged in the people;
for even in oligarchies every where the supreme power is in the majority, is or should we define an oligarchy as a government where the supreme power is in the hands of a few:
for let us suppose the num­ ber of a people to be thirteen hundred, and that of these, one thousand were rich, who would not permit the three hundred poor to have any share in the government, although they were free, and their equals in every thing else ;
no one would say that this government was a democracy.
In like manner, if the poor, when few in number, should acquire the power over the rich, though more than themselves, no one would say that this formed an oligarchy ;
nor would any one call such a state an oligarchy, when the poor, though few in number, are supe-
Truer distinc­ tion between them.
rior in power to the rich, who have a majority.
We should rather say that the state is a demo­ cracy, when the supreme power is in the hands of the freemen;
an oligarchy, when it is in the hands of the rich.
It happens indeed that in the one case the many will possess it, in the other the few ;
because there are many poor, and few rich.
And if the offices of state were to be distri buted according to the size of the citizens, as they say it is in Æthiopia,1 or according to their beauty, then it would be an oligarchy :
for the number of those who are tall or beautify is small.
Nor withal are those things which we have already mentioned, alone sufficient to describe these states;
for since there are many species both of a democracy and an oligarchy, the matter requires that further distinction be made;
as we cannot admit, that if a few freemen possess the supreme power over the many who are not free, this government is a demo­ cracy :
as in Apollonia upon the Ionian Sea, and in Thera ;
2 for in each of these cities the honours of the state were in the hands of some few distinguished families who first founded the colonies.
Nor would the rich, because they are superior in numbers, form a democracy, as formerly at Colophon ;
for there the majority had large possessions before the Lydian war.
But a democracy is a state where the free­ men and the poor, being the majority, are invested with the power of the state ;
and an oligarchy is a state where the rich and those of noble family, A democracy defined.
An oligarchy defined.
being few, possess it.
We have now proved that there are various forms of government, and we have assigned a reason for it ;
and shall proceed to show, that there are even more than these, and what they are, and why ;
starting from the first prin­ ciple which we have already laid down.
We admit that every state consists not of one, but of many parts.
For example, if it should be our purpose to comprehend the different species of animals, we should first of all note those parts which every animal must have, as certain of the organs of sense, as also what is fitted to receive and retain its food, as a mouth and a belly;
and besides, certain parts to enable it to move from place to place.
If, then, these are the only parts of an animal, and there are differences between them, namely, in their va­ rious sorts of mouths, and bellies, and organs of sense, and be­ sides these in their powers of motion ;
the number of all these combined together must necessarily make up different species of animals.
For it is not possible that the same kind of animal should have any very great deal of difference in its mouth or ears ;
so that when all these possible combinations are collected together, they will make up various species of animals, which will be as many kinds as there are of these general combina-
The component parts of a state.
1. γεωργοὶ. 2. βάναυσοι. tions of necessary parts.
Now the same thing is true of what are called polities ;
for a state is not made up of one, but of many parts, as has already been often said;
one of which is those who supply provisions, called husbandmen ;
another called me­ chanics, whose employment is in the manual arts, without which the city could not be inhabited ;
of these some are busied about what is absolutely necessary, others about things which contribute to the elegancies and pleasures of life ;
the third sort are hucksters, I mean by these buyers, sellers, petty traffickers, and retail dealers ;
the fourth are hired labourers, or workmen;
the fifth are the men-at-arms, a rank not less useful than the other, unless the community choose to be the slaves of every invader.
For doubtless a state which is naturally a slave, is unworthy of the name of a city;
for a An error in the Republic of Plato refuted.
city is self-sufficient, but a slave is not.
So that when Socrates says1 that a city is necessarily composed of four sorts of people, weavers, hus- bandmen, shoemakers, and builders ;
he then adds, as if these were not sufficient, smiths, herdsmen for what cattle are ne­ cessary, and also merchants and victuallers, and these are by way of appendix to his first list;
as if a city was established for necessity, and not for the sake of perfect life, or as if it was equally in need of shoemakers and husbandmen.
Also he does not reckon the military as a part of the state, before its ter­ ritory increases and brings about war, by touching on the borders of the neighbouring powers.
1
And even amongst them who compose his four divisions, or whoever have any connexion with each- other, it will be necessary to have some one to distribute justice, and to determine between man and man.
Since, then, any one would hold that the mind is more truly a part of man than his body, one would regard such things as more properly belonging to his city than matters of every-day necessity :
such things are the portion devoted to war and the administration of forensic justice ;
to which may be added those who are members of the council, which is the business of political sagacity.
Nor is it of any consequence, whether these different employments are filled by different persons, or by one, as the same man is oftentimes both a soldier and a husbandman.
So that if both the judge and the senator are parts of the city, it necessarily follows that the soldier must be so also.
The seventh sort are those who serve the public in expensive employments at their own charge;
and these are called the opulent.
The eighth are those who in like manner execute the different offices of the state, and without these it could not possibly subsist:
it is therefore neces­ sary that there should be some persons capable of governing and of filling the places in the city;
and this either for life, or in rotation.
The office of a senator, and of him who ad­ ministers justice to litigants, alone now remain;
and these we have already sufficiently defined.
Since, then, these things are necessary for a state, to the end that it may be happy and just, it follows that citizens who engage in public affairs should be men of abilities therein.
Many persons think it possible that different employments may be allotted to the same person, as that of a soldier, a husbandman, and an artificer;
as also, that others may be both senators and judges :
but all men lay claim to political ability, and think themselves qualified for almost every department in the state.
But the same person cannot at once be poor and rich:
for which rea­ son the most obvious division of the city is into two parts, the poor and rich.
Moreover, since in general the one are few, the other many, they seem of all the parts of a city most clearly contrary to each other;
so that as the one or the other prevail, they form different polities, and these two forms of polity are democracy and oligarchy.
It has been already mentioned that there are many different states, and from what causes they arise;
let us therefore now show that there Different kinds of democracies and oligarchies.
are also different kinds both of democracy and oligarchy.
Though this indeed is evident from what we have already said:
for there are many different sorts of common people,1 and also of those who are called the upper classes.
Of the different sorts of the first are the husbandmen, artificers, and hucksters, who are em­ ployed in buying and selling;
seamen, of whom some are engaged in war, some in traffic, some in carrying goods and passengers, others in fishing ;
-( and of each of these there are often many, as fishermen at Tarentum and Byzantium, masters of galleys at Athens, merchants at Ægina and Chios, those who carry passengers at Tenedos;
)—to these we may add those who live by their manual labour, and have so little property that they cannot live without some employ;
and also those who are not free-born from citizens on both sides, and whatever other sort of common people there may be.
That which marks the upper classes, is their fortune, their birth, their abilities, or their education, or any such like ex- cellence which is attributed to them.
The most pure democracy1 is that which is called so prin­ cipally from the equality which prevails in it:
for Democracy is, 1. κατὰ τὸ ἴσον, the best.
this is what the law in that state directs, that the poor shall be in no greater subjection than the rich;
and that the su­ preme power shall be not lodged with either of these, but that both shall share it.
alike.
For if liberty and equality, Is some persons suppose, are chiefly to be found in a democracy, it must be most so, by every department of government being alike open to all ;
but as the people are the majority, and what they vote is law, it follows that such a state must be a democracy.
This then is one species of a demo­ cratic government.
Another is, when the magis­ trates are elected by a certain census, the standard of which is low ;
and where every one who possesses property ought to have a share in the government, but as soon as he has 3.

lost that property, he ought no longer.
Another sort is, that in which every man who is not under ban has a share in the government, but where the government is in the law.
Another, where every one, provided he be a citizen, has this right, but where the government is in the law.
Another is the same with these in other particulars, but al­ lows the people and not the law to be supreme;
and this takes place when every thing is determined by a majority of votes, and not by a law ;
a thing which happens by reason of the demagogues.
For where a democracy is governed by stated laws, there is no room for a demagogue, but men of worth fill the first offices in the state;
but where the power is not vested in the laws, there demagogues abound.
1
For there the people's voice becomes that of a king, the whole composing one body;
for they are supreme, not as individuals, but in their collective capacity.
Homer also says, " Ill fares it, where the multitude hath sway;
" but whether he means this kind of democracy, or one where the many are individually supreme, is uncertain.
Now, when the people possess this power, they desire to be altogether absolute, that they may not be under the control of the law, and they grow despotical, so that flatterers are held in repute;
and such a people become analogous, to tyranny among the forms of monarchy;
for their manners are the same, and they both hold a des-

For their decrees are like the others' edicts ;
and a demagogue with them is like a flatterer among the others ;
but both these two classes abound.
with each, flatterers with tyrants, and demagogues among such a people.
And to them it is owing that the su­ preme power is lodged in the votes of the people, and not in written laws ;
for they bring every thing before them.
And this they do because they have influence, on account of the supreme power being lodged in the people ;
for these are they whom the multitude obey.
Besides, those who inveigh against rulers are wont to say that the people ought to be the judges of their conduct;
and the people gladly receive their complaints as the means of destroying all their offices.
Any one therefore may with great justice blame such a govern­ ment by calling it a democracy, and not a free state;
for where the government is not vested in the laws, then there is no free state, for the law ought to be supreme over all things ;
and particular incidents which arise, should be determined by the magis-

trates or by the state.
If, therefore, a democracy is to be reckoned as one among free states, it is evident that any such establishment which centres all power in the votes of the peo­ ple cannot, properly speaking, be a democracy;
for their de­ crees cannot be general in their extent.
Let this, then, be our description of the several species of democracies.
Different kinds of oligarchy.
1. With a high census to shut out the many.
2. The same, but where the rulers are self­ elected.
BUT of the different species of oligarchies, one is when the right to the offices is regulated by a cer­ tain census, so that the poor, although they are the majority, have no share in it;
while all those who are included in it take part in the management of public affairs.
Another sort is, when the ma­ gistrates are men of very small fortune, and upon any vacancy themselves fill it up.
Now if they do this out of the community at large, the state approaches to an aristocracy ;
if out of any particular class of people, it will 3.

be an oligarchy.
Another sort of oligarchy is when the power is an hereditary nobility.
The fourth is when the power is in the same hands, and they are supreme instead of the laws;
and this sort of oligarchy exactly corresponds to a tyranny among monarchies, and to that particular species of democracy which we last mentioned;
and this has the par­ ticular name of a dynasty.
2
So many, then, are the different sorts of oligarchies and democracies.
It should also be known, that it often happens that a free state, where the supreme power is in the laws, may not be democratic, and yet, in con­ sequence of the established manners and customs of the people, may be governed as if it was;
so, on the other hand, among other people where a polity in accordance to the laws may really bend to a democratic term, still their customs and manners may be of an oligarchic tendency.
And this chiefly happens when there has been any alteration in the government;
for the people do Tendency to preserve the form estab­ lished.
not easily change, but love their own ancient customs;
and it is by small degrees only that one thing gains place from another;
so that the ancient laws remain in force, while the power is with those who bring about a revolution in the state.
IT is evident from what has been said, that there are as many species of democracies and oligarchies as the above;
for of necessity, either all the aforesaid ranks of the people must have a share in the government, or some only, and others not.
Now when the husbandmen and those only who possess moderate fortunes have the supreme power, they will govern according to law;
for as they must get their livings by their labour, they have One kind of democracy, when a state will be ruled by law.
but little leisure for public business:
they will therefore establish fit laws, and call public assemblies when there is a necessity;
and they will readily let every one partake with them in the administration of public affairs, as soon as they possess that fortune which the law requires as a qualification.
[And hence, by the way, it is in the power of every one who has any thing to have his share in the government.1]
For to exclude any class would be a step towards oligarchy, and for all to have leisure, to attend unless they have a subsistence, would be impossible.
This form of government then, for the above reasons, is one species of democracy.

not accept it for the cause already assigned ;
for which reason A fourth kind.
here also the supreme power will be in the law.
A fourth species of democracy is the last estab­ lished in point of time in the states.
For as the cities have been enlarged far beyond their original size, and as the public revenue has become considerable, the populace, on account of their numbers, are admitted to share in the management of public affairs, and even the poor are at leisure to attend to them, as they receive pay:
:
1 nay, they have the greatest leisure of all, as they are not hindered by having any care of their own property, as is the case with the rich, who on this ac­ count often take no part in the public assembly and the courts of justice;
thus the supreme power is lodged in the poor, and not in the laws.
These are the different sorts of democracies, and such are the causes which necessarily gave birth to them.
The first kind of oligarchy.
But as to the various kinds of oligarchy, the first is when the greater part are men of moder­ ate means, and have not too large property;
for this gives each man of property leisure for the management of public affairs:
and, as they are a numerous body, it neces­ sarily follows, that the supreme power must be in the laws, and not in the individuals;
for in proportion as they are far from a monarchical government, and have not sufficient for­ tune to neglect their private affairs, while they are too many to be supported by the public, they will of course determine to be governed by the laws, and not by each other.
But if the men of property in the state are fewer than in the former case, and if their property is large, then an oligarchy of the second sort will take The second kind.
place;
for those who have power will claim a right to lord it over the others.
And, to accomplish this, they will associate themselves with some who have an inclination for public affairs, and as they are not yet powerful enough to govern without law, they will make a law for that purpose.
And if they set themselves, as being fewer, to gain greater fortunes, the oligarchy will then alter into one of the third sort, because they keep the offices of state in their The third kind.
own hands by a law, which directs the son to succeed upon the death of his father.
But as soon as they extend their strength further by means of their wealth and powerful con­ nexions, such a dynasty nearly approaches to a monarchy, and the men will be supreme, and not the law;
and this is the fourth species of an oli-

garchy, and it corresponds to the last-mentioned kind of de­ mocracy.
THERE are also two other states, besides a democracy and an oligarchy, concerning the one of which all speak, and it is always esteemed one species of the four sorts ;
and thus they reckon them up;
a monarchy, an oligarchy, a democracy, and the fourth, which they call an aristocracy.
There is also a fifth, which bears a name that is also common to the other four, namely, a Polity;

is seldom to be met with, it has escaped those who endeavour to enumerate the different forms of govern- ments, of which they admit four only, as does Plato in his Republic.
1
What an at is­ tocracy is.
1. First kind.
An aristocracy of which we have already treated in our first book, is rightly called so;
for a state governed by the best men, upon the most virtuous principles, and not (so called) according to any arbitrary defi­ nition of good men,2 has alone a right to be called an aristo­ cracy ;
for it is there only that the good man and the good citizen are identified ;
while in other states men are good only 2.

relatively to their own country.
Moreover, there are some other states which are called by the same name, that differ both from oligarchies and free states, wherein they choose men for office, not only according to their wealth, but according to their merit.
Now this polity differs from both of the above, and is called an aristocracy ;
for in those governments wherein virtue is not their common care, there are still men of high worth and approved merit.
Whatever How it differs from a virtuous democracy.
state, then, as at Carthage, favours the rich, the virtuous, and the citizens at large, is a sort of aristocracy:
but when only the two latter are held in esteem, as at Lacedoemon, and the state is jointly composed of these, it is a virtuous democracy.
These are the two species of aristocracies over and above the first, 3. Third kind.
which is the best of all governments,
There is also a third, which is to be found whenever any one of what are called free states inclines to the dominion of a few.
Free states and tyrannies.
IT now remains for us to treat of that govern­ ment which is particularly called a free state, and also of a tyranny;
and we have thus arranged our method, because, although this, as well as the aristocracies already mentioned, do not seem excesses, yet, to speak truly, they have all departed from a perfect government:
and so they are reckoned among these, and these are their cor­ rupted forms, as we said at the beginning.
It is proper to mention a tyranny the last of all governments, for it is of all others the least like a polity, but our treatise is on the subject of polities.
We have said, then, why this arrangement has been made;
but now we must explain what is meant by a free state.
For we shall the better understand its positive nature now that we have already de­ scribed an oligarchy and a democracy ;
1 for a free
What is a free state ?
state is indeed nothing more than a mixture of these, and it has been usual to call those which incline most to a democracy, free states, and those which incline most to an oligarchy, aris­ tocracies, because rank and education are generally append­ ages of the wealthy.
Besides, they enjoy those things which others are often guilty of crimes to procure ;
for which reason men regard them as men of worth, honour, and note.
Since, then, it is the genius of an aristocracy to allot the larger part of the government to the best citizens, they therefore say that an oligarchy is chiefly composed of those men who are worthy and honourable.
Now it seems impossible that a state, where the government is in the hands of the good, should not be well governed, but ill ;
or well governed, where the power is in the hands of the bad.
Nor is a government well constituted because the laws are such, unless they are observed ;
for the enforcement of obedience to The laws alone no test of a government.
the laws is one proof of a good constitution in the state:
an­ other is, to have laws by which they shall abide well made;
(for even if they are improper they must be obeyed ;
) and this may be done in two ways, either by their being the best relatively to the particular state, or the best absolutely.
An aristocracy seems most likely to confer the honours of the state on the virtuous ;
for virtue is the object of an aristocracy, riches of an oligarchy, and liberty of a democracy;
for what is approved of by the majority will prevail in each one of these three different states ;
and that which is esteemed by the greater part of those who compose the community will have the supreme power.
Now what is called a free state prevails in most communities which are generally made up of rich and poor, riches and liberty:
for among almost all men the rich seem to maintain their position as worthy and honourable people.
But as there are three things which claim an equal rank in the state, namely, freedom, riches, and merit,—(for the fourth, which is called nobility, is consequent on two of the others, since merit and riches are the origin of nobility)—it is evident, that the union of the rich and the poor makes up a free state;
but that the union of all three tends to an aristo­ cracy more than any other, except that state which is truly so, and which holds the first rank.
We have already seen, then, that there are governments different from a monarchy, a demo­ cracy, and an oligarchy, and what they are ;
and also wherein both aristocracies differ from each other, and free states from an aristocracy;
and it is evident, that these are not much unlike each other.
How a polity- arises.
NEXT in order to what has been said, let us state how that government which is peculiarly called a polity arises, beside a democracy and an oligarchy, and how it ought to be established ;
and this will at the same time show what are the proper limits by which these govern­ ments are bounded;
for we must mark out wherein they differ from one another, and then from each of these we must take as it were a contribution, and so combine them.
There Modes of blending states together.
1st mode.
are three ways in which states may be blended and joined together;
for, in the first place, we may take from both sides whatever the laws of each have ordered;
as for instance, in matters of judicial trials.
'
For in an oligarchy the rich are fined if they do not serve as dicasts, but the poor are not paid for their attendance ;
but in democracies they are paid, while the rich are not fined for neglect.
Now each of these points is a matter which belongs in common to both states ;
and hence they are adapted to a free state, which is composed of both.
This, then, is one way in which they may be joined together.
2nd mode.
In the second place, a medium may be taken be­ tween the different methods which each state lays down ;
for instance, in a democracy the right to vote in the public assembly is either confined by no census at all, or by a low one;
in an oligarchy it belongs only to those whose standard of wealth is high :
therefore, as these two practices are incompatible, a census between each may be established in such a state.
The third method is compounded of two ordinances,' partly from the oligarchic 3rd mode.
principle and partly from the democratic.
For instance, as it seems suitable to a democracy, that the magistrates should be chosen by lot, but to an aristocracy by vote;
and it is oligarchical to choose them according to a census, while not to do so is democratical.
To copy something from each other, then, is at once aristocratical and suitable to a free state ;
from an oligarchy, their choice of magistrates by vote, but from a democracy their refusal to impose a census.
This is the way of blending them :
but the best test of a happy mixture of a democracy and an oligarchy is, when a person may properly call the same state both a democracy and an oligarchy ;
for it is evi-

dent, that those who thus speak of it are led to do so, because both forms are there well blended together.
And indeed this is common to all means, that the extremes of each side should be discerned in them ;
it is the case with the state of Lacedæmon;
for many strive to maintain that it is a democracy, because it has many particulars The Spartan constitution instanced.
which follow that form of government;
2 as for instance, in the first place, in the bringing up of their children.
For the children of both rich and poor are brought up in the same manner;
and they are educated in such a manner that the children of the poor may partake of it:
and the same rules are observed when they are successively youths and men, there is no distinction between a rich person and a poor one, and in their public tables the same provision is served to all.
The rich also wear only such clothes as the poorest man might be able to purchase.
Moreover, with respect to two magistracies of the highest rank, to one they have a right to elect, and to have a share of the other;
for they elect the Senate1 and partake in the Ephoralty.
Others consider it as an oligarchy, because it has many oligarchical points;
as in choosing all their officers by vote, and not by lot;
in there being but a few who have a right to judge on capital causes, A free state should be in­ dependent of its neighbours.
and in matters of banishment, and the like.
In­ deed, a state which is well composed of two others ought to show that it resembles them both, and yet is neither one nor the other.
Such a state ought to have its means of preservation in itself, and not from without;
and when I say in itself, I do not mean that it should owe this to the forbearance of their neighbours, (for this may happen to a bad government,) but to the fact that every member of the community is unwilling that there should be the least alteration in its constitution.
We have then spoken of the method in which a free state ought to be estab­ lished, and likewise a so-called aristocracy.
A tyranny.
IT now remains for us to treat of a tyranny;
not that there is much to be said on that subject, but still let it receive its proper place in our plan, since we have enumerated it also as one form of government.
Now, in the beginning of this work we inquired into the nature of kingly government, where we entered into a particular examination of what was most properly called kingly sway, and whether it was advantageous to a state or not, and what it should be, Of two kinds.
and whence and how established.
We also divided tyranny into two species, when we were upon the subject of monarchy, because their power somehow or other easily passes into a kingly government, owing to the fact that they are both of them established by law;
for among some of the barbarians they elect monarchs with absolute power, and formerly among the Greeks there were some such, whom they called Æsymnetes.
Now these have certain points of difference from each other;
for they were kingly so far as they were regulated by law, ruled over voluntary subjects;
but they were tyrannical, because they ruled despotically, ac­ cording to their own will.
There is a third species of tyranny, which seems to be most properly so called, the counterpart of kingly power ;
and this A third kind of tyranny.
monarchy must needs be a tyranny, where one rules over his equals and superiors, without being accountable for his con­ duct,l and whose object is his own advantage, and not the ad­ vantage of those whom he governs.
And hence he rules by compulsion ;
for no freeman will ever willingly submit to such a government.
2
These then, and so many, are the different species of tyrannies, owing to the above-mentioned causes.
WE now inquire what form of government and what manner of life is best for communities in general, and for the greater part of men ;
not with What the best practical form of government.
reference to that superior virtue which is above the reach of the vulgar, or to that education which needs every advantage of nature and fortune, nor with reference to the merely imagin- ary form of polity ;
1 but let it be with reference to that mode of life in which the greater part of mankind can share, and that government of which most cities can partake.
For as to those, so called, aristocracies which we have now mentioned, they either fall beyond the attainment of states,2 or so nearly resemble that which is properly called a polity, that we shall treat of them both as one.
The opinions which we shall pass upon these subjects must depend upon the same principles :
for if what we have said in our Ethies3 is true, that a happy life must arise from an un­ interrupted course of virtue, and that virtue consists in a cer­ tain mean, of necessity the middle life must certainly be the happiest, the mean being supposed to be attainable by every one.
The boundaries of virtue and vice must also necessarily be the same in a city and in a polity:
for a polity is the very life of the city.
In every state the people are divided into The middle state to be preferred.
three sorts;
the very rich, the very poor, and, thirdly, those who are between them.
Since, then, it is universally admitted that the mean is best, it is evident, that even in point of fortune, a middle state is to be preferred ;
for that state is most apt to submit to rea­ son.
For those who are very handsome, or very strong, or very noble, or very rich, or, on the contrary, those who are very poor, or very weak, or very mean, with difficulty obey it.
And this, because the one class is capricious and wicked on a large sealer the other rascally and mean;
and the crimes of each arise respectively from insolence and villany:
nor will they hold office as chiefs of a phyle or presidents of the council;
2 and these things are both detrimental to the state.
Besides, those who excel in strength, in riches, or friends, or the like, neither know how, nor are willing, to submit to com­ mand :
-( and this begins at home when they are boys, for there they are brought up too delicately to be accustomed to obey their preceptors:
)—as for the very poor, their excessive want reduces them to a state too mean ;
so that the one know not how to command, but only to be commanded as slaves, the others know not how to submit to any command, but only to command with despotic power.
A city composed of such men must therefore consist of slaves and masters, not of freemen ;
where one party must hate, and the other despise;
and this is very far removed from friendship and political community ;
for a community supposes affection, for men do not even on the road associate with their enemies.
It is also the aim of a city to be composed as much as pos­ sible of equals;
and this will be most so when Equality to be aimed at.
the inhabitants are in the middle state;
whence it follows, that that city must be best .
framed which is composed of those who we say are naturally its proper members.
It is men of this station also who are best assured of safety;
for they will neither covet what belongs to others, as the poor do;
nor will others covet what is theirs, as the poor do what belongs to the rich;
and thus, without plotting against any one, and having any one to plot against them, they will live free from danger.
For which reason .
Phocylides wisely prayed, " The middle state is best;
that state be mine, Whate'er my city be."
1
It is plain, then, that the most perfect political community must be amongst those who are in the middle rank, and that The best state, where the mean out-numbers the extremes.
those states can best be carried on, wherein these are the majority and outweigh, if possible, both the other classes;
or, if that cannot be, at least then either of them separate;
for being thrown into the balance it will prevent either excess from preponderating.
It is therefore the greatest happiness of citizens to possess a moderate and convenient fortune ;
for when some possess too much, and others nothing at all, the government must be either an extreme democracy, or else a pure oligarchy;
or, from the excesses of both, a tyranny ;
for this arises from a headstrong democracy, or an oligarchy, but far more seldom when the members of the community are nearly on an equality with each other.
We will assign a reason for this when we come to treat of the alterations which different states are likely to undergo.
But it is clear that the middle state is the best, for it is alone free from seditions ;
for where the middle class is large, there is less of sedition and insurrection to disturb the community.
And for the same reason extensive govern­ ments are least liable to these inconveniencies ;
for there the middle classes are very numerous ;
whereas in small ones it is easy to pass to the two extremes, so as hardly to have any in a middle state remaining, but the one half are rich, the other Why democra­ cies more stable than oligarchies.
poor.
And from the same principle it comes, that democracies are more firmly established, and of longer continuance than oligarchies;
but even in those when there is a want of the proper number of men of middling fortune, the poor extend their power too far, abuses arise, and the government is soon at an end.
We ought to consider as a proof of what we now advance, that the best lawgivers themselves were those in the middle rank of life;
amongst whom was Solon, as is evident from his poems, and Lycurgus, (for he was not a king,2) and Charondas, and indeed most others.
And what has been said will show us why of so many free states, some have changed to demo­ cracies, others to oligarchies;
for whenever the number of persons in the middle state has been too small, those who were the more numerous, whether the rich or the poor, always overpower Consequence of having too small a middle class.
them, and assume to themselves the administration of public affairs;
and hence arises either a democracy or an oligarchy.
Moreover, when in consequence of their disputes and.
quarrels with each other, either the rich get the better of the poor, or the poor of the rich, neither of them will establish a free state;
but, as the record of their victory, they adopt one which inclines to their own principles, and form either a de­ mocracy or an oligarchy.
And further, those who gained the leadership of Greece, had each of them an eye to the re­ spective forms of government in their own cities, Policy of the leading states of Greece.
and established either democracies or oligarchies,1 not con.
sidering what was serviceable to the state, but what was simi­ lar to their own.
And for this reason a government has never, or very seldom, been established where the supreme power has been placed amongst those of the middle rank ;
and, amongst a few, one man only of those who have yet been conquerors has been persuaded to give the preference to this arrangement.
It is indeed an established custom with the inhabitants of most cities, not to desire an equality, but either to aspire to govern, or when they are conquered to What is the best state, the next best, and the worst.
submit,
Thus from what we have said, it is plain what is the best state, and why.
But with re­ gard to other polities, since we say that there are various forms both of democracy and oligarchy it will not be difficult to judge to which we should give the first place, to which the second, and which in a consequent order is better or worse, now that the best form has been defined:
for that must be the best which is nearest to this, and that the worst which is most distant from the mean, un-

less any one forms a mere imaginary standard.
I mean by this, that it may happen, that though one form of government may be better than another, yet oftentimes nothing prevents another from being preferable to it in particular circumstances, and for particular purposes.
What govern­ ment best suits particular cases.
AFTER what has been said, it follows that we should now show what and what kind of govern­ ment is most suitable for particular cases.
But first we must lay down the same maxim as ap­ plicable to all, that that party which desires to support the established policy of the state, ought to be superior to that States made up of quality and quantity.
which would alter it.
Every city is made up of quality and quantity:
by quality I mean liberty, riches,' education, and nobility, and by quantity the excess of its population.
Now it may so happen, that quality may exist in one of those parts of which the city is composed, and quantity in the other;
thus, the number of the low-born may be greater than the number of those of family, and the number of the poor than that of the rich ;
but not so far that the quantity of the one shall outweigh the qualify
These should be in due pro­ portion.
of the other.
Hence these must be properly ad­ justed to each other;
for where the number of the poor exceeds the proportion above-mentioned, there a democracy is wont to rise up, and the democracy will be of a particular species, according to that class of men which Effect of dispo­ sition in these two elements.
two may happen to be most numerous:
thus, should the number of husbandmen be excessive, it will be of the best kind ;
if of mechanics, and thoMa who work for pay, of the worst;
in the same manner it may be of any other set between these two.
But where the rich and the noble prevail more in quality, than they fall short in quan­ tity, there an oligarchy ensues;
and this oligarchy in like manner may be of different species, according to the nature of ' the oligarchical party which prevails.
Every le­ gislator in framing his constitution ought to have a particular regard to those in the middle rank

suited, of life ;
1 for whether he intends an oligarchy, they should be the object of his aim;
or whether a democracy, he ought to win these over to the laws.
But whenever their number exceeds that of the two others, or at least over one of them, it is possible to find stability in the constitution ;
for there is no fear that the rich and the poor should agree to conspire together against them, for neither of these will choose to serve the other.
But if any seek to fix the administration on a wider basis, they will find none preferable to this ;
for to rule by turns is what the rich and the poor will not submit to, on account of their distrust of each other.

middle class serve as an arbitrator.
Those too who would establish aristocratical governments are mistaken, not only in giving too much power to the rich, but also in misleading the common people;
for in length of time, out of unreal goods real evils must needs arise ;
for the encroachments of the rich are more destructive to the state than those of the poor.
THERE are five particulars, in which, under fair pretences, they deal craftily with the rights of the people;
and these are their public assemblies, Points in which the rich cajole the poor.
their offices of state, their courts of justice, their military power, and their gymnastic exercises.
With regard to their public assemblies ;
in having them open to all, but in fining the rich only, or a far larger sum, for not attending:
with respect to offices, in permitting the poor to swear off, but not granting this indulgence to those who come up to the census;
with respect to their courts of justice, in fining the rich for non-attendance, but the poor not at all;
or those a-great deal, and these very little, as was done in the laws of Charondas.
In some places every citizen who is enrolled, has a right to attend the assemblies and to try causes;
and if they do not do so, a very heavy fine is laid upon them;
that through fear of the fine, they may avoid being enrolled, and that through not being on the roll, they need not serve in the assembly or the courts.
The same spirit prevails with those who regulate their bearing arms, and their gymnastic exercises;
for the poor are excused if they have no arms, but the rich are fined ;
and the same method takes place if they do not attend their gym­ nastic exercises, for there is no penalty laid on the one, but there is on the other :
in order that the rich may be led to keep, the one, and attend the other, while the poor, through fear of the penalty, do neither.
These are the deceitful contrivances
The devices of a democracy.
of oligarchical legislators.
But contrary devices prevail in a democracy ;
for there they make tho poor a proper allowance for attending the assem blies and the courts, but give the rich nothing for so doing ;
and hence it is evident, that if any one would properly blend these customs together, they must extend both the pay and the fine to every member of the community, and then every one would share it, whereas at present the polity is in the hands of one part only.
The citizens of a free state ought to consist of those only who bear arms:
with respect to their income, it is not easy to determine exactly, and to say that it Extension of the franchise.
ought to be so much :
but keeping quality in view, it is fit to make the franchise as extensive as pos­ sible, so that those who share in it shall out-num­ ber those who do not;
for those who are poor, although they partake not of the offices of the state, are willing to live quietly, provided that no one disturbs them in their property.
But this is not an easy matter;
for it may not always happen that those who are at the head of public affairs are of a humane behaviour.
In time of war the poor are accustomed to show no alacrity except they have provisions found them ;
but when they are provided, then indeed they are willing to fight.
In some governments the power is vested not only in those who bear arms, but also in those who have borne them.
Among the Malienses, the state was composed of these latter only, for to all the offices they elected soldiers who had served their time.
And the first states in Greece which succeeded those where Gradual rise of the power of the foot-sol­ diers.
kingly power was established, were governed by the military.
First of all they were governed by the horse,-( for at that time the strength and excellence of the army depended on the horse, as the heavy-armed foot were useless without proper discipline ;
but the art of tactics was not known to the ancients, for which reason their strength lay in their horse:
) -but as the cities grew larger, and depended more on their foot-soldiers,1 greater numbers partook of the freedom of the state;
and for this reason, what we call republics were form­ erly called democracies.
The ancient governments were pro­ perly oligarchical and monarchical;
for on account of the few persons in each state, they had but a small number of the middle rank;
so that being but few, and used to subordina­ tion, they more easily submitted to be governed.
We have now shown why there are many sorts of governments, and others different from those of which we have treated;
(for there are more species of democracies than one, and the like is true of other forms ;
) as also what are their differences, and whence they arise;
and besides this, we have shown which is the best form, at least in general;
and which of the others is best suited for particular people.
LET us now again proceed to make some reflec­ tions, both general and particular, upon each form of government in due order, beginning with those principles which appertain to each.
Now in all states there are three particulars, in which the General re­ marks on polities.
Three points to be considered.
careful legislator ought well to consider what is expedient to each form of government;
and if these are in a proper con- dition, the state must necessarily prosper;
and according to the variation of each of these, one state will differ from the 1.

other.
The first of these is the assembly for public affairs ;
the second, the officers of the state ;
(that is, who they ought to be, and with what power they should be invested, and in what man­ ner they should be appointed ;
) and the third, the judicial department.
Now it is the proper busi­ ness of the public assembly1 to determine con­ cerning war and peace, to make or break off alli­ ances, to enact laws, to sentence to death, banishment, or confiscation of goods, and to call the magistrates to account for their behaviour when in office.
Now these powers must ne­ cessarily be all intrusted to the citizens in general, or all of them to some, whether it be to one magistrate or to more ;
or different ones to different magistrates, or some to all, but others One method (democratical).
to some only.
Now that all should be intrusted with all offices, is in the spirit of a democracy, for the people aim at such an equality.
There are many methods of delegating these powers to the citizens at large, one of which is to let them execute them by turn and not all together, as was done by Telecles the Milesian in his state ;
2 (for in other states the supreme council is composed of the different magistrates who meet together, and they suc­ ceed to the offices of the community by proper divisions of tribes, wards, and by other small distinctions, till each goes through them ;
) and to provide that the whole community shall not meet together, except to enact new laws, or on some matter of state, or to hear what the magistrates have to propose.
An- A second method.
other method is for the people to meet in a collective body, but only for the purpose of holding the co­ mitia, of making laws, of determining concerning war or peace, and of inquiring into the conduct of the magis­ trates, while the remaining part of public business is conducted by the magistrates, who have their separate departments, and are chosen out of the whole community, by vote or by ballot.

into their conduct, and also to deliberate concerning war and alliances;
but to leave all other things to the magistrates whoever happen to be chosen, and whose particular employ­ ments are such as necessarily require persons well skilled in them.
A fourth method is for every person to meet and deliberate upon every subject, where Fourth method.
the magistrates can determine nothing of themselves, but only give their opinions first;
and this is the method according to which the most pure democracy is carried on, which, we say, is analogous to the proceedings in a dynastic oligarchy and a ty­ rannic monarchy.
These methods, then, are all democratical.
But when the power is in the hands of part of the community only, it is an oligarchy ;
.and this also admits of sundry varieties;
for whenever the When the con stitution is oli­ garchical.
officers of state are chosen out of those who have a moderate fortune, and they are more in number, owing to the lowness of the standard, and when they do not alter that line which the law has laid down, but carefully follow it, and when all within the census are eligible, certainly the state is then an oligarchy, but founded on true principles of government from its moderation.
And when the people in general do not par­ take of the deliberative power, but certain persons chosen for that purpose, who govern according to law, as in the previous case ;
this also is an oligarchy.
But when those who have the deliberative power elect each other, and the son succeeds to the father, and when they can supersede the laws, such a government is of necessity a strict oligarchy.
But when different persons determine on different things, as when all decide matters of war and peace, and inquire into the conduct of their magis-

trates, and while other things are left to different officers, elected either by vote or lot, then the government is an aris­ tocracy or a free state.
When some things are decided by officers chosen by vote, and others by officers chosen by lot, out of the people in general, or from a certain number elected for that purpose, or if both the votes and the lots are open to all, that state is partly an aristocracy, and partly a free govern­ ment itself.
These, then, are the methods in which the do- liberative power is vested in different states, and each of them follows the distinctions laid down above.
Assemblies serviceable to a democracy.
It is advantageous, however, to a democracy in the pure sense of the word now-a-days, (by which I mean a state wherein the people at large have a supreme power even over the laws, with a view to holding frequent public assemblies, to imitate the example of oligarchies in their courts of justice ;
(for they fine those who are appointed to try causes, if they do not attend, and the poor in a democracy are rewarded for their attendance;
)
I say it is advantageous to the people to do the same in their assemblies;
and their counsels will be best when all advise with each other, the citizens with the nobles, and the nobles with the citizens.
It is also advisable to elect, either by vote or lot, an equal number of both ranks, to take part in the council.
It is also proper, if the common people in the state are very numerous, either not to pay every one for his attend­ ance, but such a number only as will make them equal to the nobles, or to reject the greater part of them by lot.
In an How to act in an oligarchy as to assemblies.
oligarchy they should either raise some of the common people to the council, or else, as is done in other states, establish a court of officers called a Provisional Committee, or Guardians of the Laws,1 whose business it is to propose first what they shall afterwards enact.
By this means the people will have a place in the administra­ tion of public affairs, without having it in their power to oc­ casion any disorder in the government.
Moreover, the people may be allowed to have a vote in whatever bill is proposed, but may not themselves propose any thing contrary to it ;
or they may give their advice, while the power of determining may be with the magistrates only.
It is also necessary to fol­ low a contrary practice to what is established in some democra­ cies ;
for the people should be allowed the power of pardoning, but not of condemning, but the cause should be referred back again to the magistrates:
whereas the contrary takes place in some republics;
for the power of pardoning is with the few, but not of condemning, which is always referred to the people at large.
And thus let it stand determined concerning the deliberative power, and that which is supreme in the state.
WE now proceed to discuss the choice of magis­ trates ;
for this branch of public business contains many different parts, as to how many there shall

be, what shall be their particular office, and with respect to time how long each shall continue in place;
(for some make it six months, others less, others for a year, others for a much longer time ;
) or whether they shall be perpetual, or for a long time, or neither;
and also whether the same person may fill the same office several times, or may not be allowed to en­ joy it even twice, but only once;
and also with respect to the appointment of magistrates, from whom and by whom they should be chosen, and in what manner;
for in all these par­ ticulars we ought properly to be able to distinguish as many different ways as may be followed ;
and then to show which of these is best suited to such and such governments.
Now it is not easy to determine whom we ought properly to call a magistrate:
for a government requires many persons in office;
but every one of those who is either chosen by vote or lot is not to he reckoned a magistrate.
The priests, for instance, in the first place;
for these A magistrate defined, prac­ tically.
are to be considered as a very different body from civil magis­ trates :
to these we may add the choragi,l and heralds ;
nay, even ambassadors are elected.
There are too some civil em- payments which belong to the citizens ;
and these are either when they are all engaged on one business, as when as soldiers they obey their general, or when part of them only are engaged, as in governing the women or educating the youth;
and also some economic;
for they often elect inspectors of the corn­ market ;
others are servile ;
and for these, if they are rich, they employ slaves.
But to speak simply, those are most properly called magistrates, who are members of the deliberative conn­ cil, or who decide causes, or are in some command ;
the last more especially, for to command is somewhat peculiar to ma­ gistracy.
But, to speak the truth, this question is of no great practical consequence ;
1 for as yet no decision has been given between those who dispute about the term.
It admits indeed another speculative inquiry;
but to inquire what officers are necessary to the being of a state, and how many, and what, though not necessary, may yet be advantageous in a well- established government, is a much more useful controversy with respect to all states in general, as well as to small cities.
Whether one office should be given to inure than one person.
In extensive governments indeed it is possible and proper too to allot one employment to one person ;
as there are many to serve the public in so nu­ merous a society, where some may be passed over for a long time, and others never be in office but once.
And indeed every thing is better done which has the whole atten­ tion of one person, than when that attention is divided amongst many.
But in small states it is necessary that a few of the citizens should execute many employments ;
for, owing to the scantiness of their numbers, it is not convenient that many of them should be in office at the same time ;
for where shall we find others to succeed them in turn ?
Small states too some­ times want the same magistrates and the same laws as large ones;
but the one often want the same magistrates, but this happens in the others but once only in a long time ;
so that dif­ ferent charges may be intrusted to the same person without any inconvenience, for they will not interfere with each other ;
and for want of sufficient members in the community it will be necessary to make offices like a spit and candlestick in one.
If we could tell how many magistrates are necessary in every city, and how many, though not necessary, it is yet proper to have, we could then the better infer what different offices it is fitting to assign to one magistrate.
It is also fitting to know what tribunals in different places should have different things under their jurisdiction, and also what things should always come under the cognizance of the same magis­ trate ;
for instance, as to decency of manners, whether the clerk of the market1 shall take cognizance of it in the market, and another magistrate in another place, or the same magistrate every where:
or whether a distinction shall be made of the fact, or of the parties ;
as for instance, whether there shall be one judge of all decency, or one when a man is concerned and another when a woman.
Further also, in different states, shall the ma­ gistrates be different or the same in kind ?
for ex­ ample, in a democracy, an oligarchy, an aristo­ cracy, and a monarchy, shall the same officers

have the supreme power, though not chosen from equals, or shall it be different in different governments;
as in an aris­ tocracy the officers of the state are allotted to the educated;
in an oligarchy to those who are rich ;
in a democracy to the freemen?
Or shall the magistrates be different, as the coin­ munities differ?
For it may happen that the very same magistracy may be sometimes proper, sometimes otherwise:
in one state it may be necessary that the magistrate have great powers, in another but small.
There are also certain magis­ trates peculiar to certain states;
as the provisional commit­ tee is not proper in a democracy, but a senate is;
for some order is necessary, whose business shall be to consider and prepare the bills beforehand, that the people may have leisure to attend to their own affairs;
and when these are few in number, the state inclines to an oligarchy.
The pro­ visional committee indeed must always be few, so that it is peculiar to an oligarchy:
and where there are both these offices in the same state, this office is superior to that of the senator, the one having only a democratical power, the other an oligarchical.
And indeed the power of the senate is lost in those democracies in which the people meet in one public assembly and take all the business into their own hands.
And this is likely to happen when the community in general are either in easy circumstances or paid for their attendance ;
for they then have leisure often to meet together and determine

every thing for themselves.
A magistrate to control the boys1 or women, or who takes any department similar to this, is to be found in an aristocracy, but not in a democracy ;
for who can forbid the wins of the poor from appearing in public ?
Neither is such a magistrate met with in an oligarchy ;
for the women there are too delicate to bear control.
And thus much for this subject at present;
but we must endeavour to treat at large of the establishment of magistrates, beginning from lirst principles.
Now they differ from each other in three ways, from which, when blended together, arise all the varieties of Tliree points of distinction.
Each of these again happen in three ways.
necessity.
The first of these differences is in those who appoint the magistrates, the second consists in those who are appointed, the third in the mode of appointment.
And each of these three differ in three ways;
for either all the citizens collectively, or some out of their whole body, or some out of a particular order in it, may appoint, according to fortune, nobility, or merit, or some other rule- (as at Megara, where the right of election was with those who had returned together to their country, and had reinstated themselves by force of arms)—and this either by vote or lot.
Again, these several modes may be differently formed together ;
as for instance, some magistrates Or, combined.
may be chosen by part of the community, others by the whole;
some out of part, others out of the whole ;
some by vote, others by lot:
and each of these different modes admit of a four-fold subdivision.
For either all may elect all by vote, or by lot;
and when all elect, they may either proceed without any distinc­ tion, or they may elect by a certain division of tribes, wards, or companies, till they have gone through the whole com­ munity :
and some magistrates may be elected one way, and others another.
Again, if some magistrates are elected either by vote or lot by all the citizens, or by the vote of some and the lot of some, or some one way and some another;
that is to say, some by the vote of all, others by the lot of all;
there will then be twelve different methods of electing the magis­ trates, without blending the two together.
Of these there are two forms adapted to a democracy ;
namely, to have all the magistrates chosen out of Which form best in a demo­ cracy.
all the people, either by vote, or by lot, or by both;
that is to say, some of them by lot, and some by vote.
In a free state the whole community should not elect at the same time, but some out of the whole, or Which in a polity.
out of some particular rank;
and this either by lot, or vote, or both:
and they should elect either out of the whole com­ munity, or out of some particular persons in it, and this both by lot and vote.
In an oligarchy it is proper to choose some magistrates out of the whole body of the citizens, some by vote, some by lot, others by Which in an oligarchy.

but to choose by lot is most suitable to that form of government.
In a free aristocracy, some magis­ trates should be chosen out of the community in general, others out of a particular rank, or these Which in an aristocracy.

In a pure oligarchy, the magis trates should be chosen out of certain ranks, and by certain persons, and some of those by lot, others by both methods ;
but to choose them out of the whole community is not cone.
spondent to the nature of this government.
It is proper in an aristocracy for the whole community to elect their magistrates out of particular persons by vote.
So many then are all the different ways of electing magistrates ;
and they have been allotted according to the nature of the different communities ;
but what mode of proceeding is proper for different com­ munities, or how the offices ought to be established, and with what powers, shall be particularly explained.
I mean by the powers of a magistrate, such a province as the management of finance or the position of a guardian;
for different magis­ trates have different powers, as that of the general of the army differs from the clerk of the market.
1The judicial department considered.
OF the three parts of a government, it remains to consider the judicial;
2 and this also we shall divide in the same manner as before, into three parts.
And there are three points of distinction;
of whom the judges shall consist, and for what causes, and how chosen.
When I say of whom, I mean whether they shall be the whole people, or some individuals ;
by for what causes, I mean, how many different kinds of courts there shall be;
and by how, Eight different kinds of courts.
whether they shall be elected by vote or lot.
Let us first determine, how many different kinds of courts there ought to be.
Now these are eight:
the first, is the court of judicial scrutiny;
the second, one to punish those who have injured the public;
the third, to take cognizance of those causes in which the state is a party;
the fourth, to decide between magistrates and private persons who appeal from a fine laid upon them;
the fifth, to determine dis- putes which may arise concerning contracts of great value ;
and besides these there must be courts to judge between foreigners, and of murders, of which there are different species.
And these may all be tried by the same judges or by different ones ;
for there are murders of malice prepense, and of chance­ medley ;
there is also justifiable homicide, where the fact is admitted, but the legality of it disputed.
There is also a fourth, called at Athens the court of Phreatto,1 which deter­ mines points relating to a murder committed by one who has run away, to decide whether he shall be allowed to return ;
but such affairs happen very seldom, and then in large cities ;
the seventh court is to determine causes wherein strangers are concerned, one part if cause is between stranger and stranger, and another if between a stranger and a citizen.
Over and above all these there is a court for small actions, ranging from one drachma to five, or a little more;
for these ought also to be legally determined, and not to be brought before the whole body of the judges.
But let us set aside these matters, both actions for murder, and those wherein strangers are the par­ ties ;
and let us particularly treat of those courts which more particularly relate to the affairs of the community, and which, if not well conducted, occasion seditions and commotions in the state.
Now, of necessity, either all persons, appointed by vote or by lot, must judge of all these different causes, or all must judge of all causes, some of them chosen by vote, and others by lot, or in some causes by vote, in others by lot.
Thus there will be four modes of appointing judges.
There will be just the same number also if they are chosen out of part of the people only;
Four ways of appointing judges.
for again, either the judges of all causes must be chosen out of that part by vote or lot, or some by lot and some by vote;
or some courts which have cognizance of the same causes must be formed partly by vote, and partly, by lot;
by which means there will be the same number of them also as was mentioned.
Besides, the same may be joined together;
I mean that some may be chosen out of the whole people, or from part of them, or from both ;
as, for instance, in the same court, some of the judges may be chosen from all the people, others from a part only, and this either by vote, or by lot, or by Which mode is best suited to a democracy, an oligarchy, and an aristocracy.
both.
And thus we have said how many sorts of courts it is possible to form.
Of these appoint­ ments, that which admits all the community to be judges in all causes is most suitable to a demo­ cracy ;
1 the second, which appoints that certain persons shall judge all causes, to an oligarchy;
the third, which appoints the whole community to be judges in some causes, but par­ ticular persons in others, to an aristocracy or a free stated
What tends to preserve and destroy states.
WE have now nearly gone through all those par­ ticulars of which we proposed to speak ;
it re­ mains that we next consider from what causes, and how many, and of what kinds, a change arises in govern­ ments, and what tends to the destruction of each state;
as also from what form a polity is most likely to shift into another form, and what are the preservatives both of governments in general, and of each state in particular;
and what are the means of saving each form of government from corruption.
And here we ought first, to lay down this principle, that there are many governments, all of which approve of what is just and equal according to analogy,1 and yet fail of attaining to it, as we have already mentioned.
Thus de­ mocracies have arisen from supposing that those A principle laid down.
Two kinds of equality.
How states have come to fail of obtain­ ing their end.
who are equal in any one thing, are so in every other cir­ cumstance ;
as, because they are equal in liberty, they think themselves equal in every thing else;
and oligarchies, from supposing that those who are unequal in one thing, are un­ equal in all;
for they deem that when men are unequal in point of fortune, there can be no equality between them.
Hence it follows, that those who in some respects are equal with others endeavour to secure an equality with them'in every thing ;
and those who Desire of equal­ ity or superior­ ity.
are superior to others, endeavour to get still more;
and it is this more which keeps the inequality.
Thus though most states have some notion of what is just, yet they are almost totally wrong;
and, upon this account, when either party has not that share in the administration which answers to its ex­ pectations, it becomes seditious.
But those who of all others have the greatest right so to act, are least disposed to do it, namely, those who excel in virtue ;
for it is most reasonable that they alone should be generally superior to the rest.
There are too some persons of distinguished families, who, on account of that point of superiority, disdain to be on an equality with others:
for those esteem themselves noble who can boast of their ancestors' merit and fortune ;
and these, to speak the truth, are the source and fountain-head from whence seditions arise.
Ac­ cordingly, changes of government take place in two distinct ways ;
for at one time they raise seditions for the purpose of changing the state already established to some other form ;
a?
when they propose to erect an oligarchy instead of a democracy, or a democracy or free state in place of an oligarchy;
or an aristocracy in place of these, or one of the latter instead of an aristocracy;
and at another time without reference to the established government, which they wish to be still the same, though they choose to have the sole management of it them-
Desire of carry­ ing out the constitution to the furthest lengths.
selves, either in the hands of a few, or of one only.
They will also raise commotions concerning the degree of power to be established;
as, for instance, if the government is an oligarchy, and in the same manner it it is a democracy, to have it more purely so, or else to have it less so :
and, in like manner, in the case of the other forms of government, changes arise either to extend or contract Spirit of change.
their powers, or else to make some alterations in some parts of it;
as to establish or abolish a parti­ cular magistracy ;
as some persons say Lysander endeavoured to abolish the kingly power in Sparta, and king Pausanias, that of the Ephors.
Thus in Epidamnus there was an alteration in one part of the constitution, for instead of the Phylarchs1 they established a senate.
It is also still necessary for all the magistrates at Athens to attend in the court of Heliæa2 when any new magistrate is created :
the power of the one Archon,3 Inequality an­ other cause.
also, in that state partook of the nature of an oligarchy..
Inequality is always the occasion of sedition, but among those who are not equal, an unequal treatment is not unfair.
Thus kingly power is un­ equal when it is exercised over equals.
Upon the whole it is this aiming after an equality which is the cause of seditions.
But equality is two-fold, for it is either in number, or in desert.
Equality in number is when two things contain the same parts or the same quantity;
but equality in value is at­ tained by proportion, as three exceeds two and two exceeds one by the same number ;
but by proportion four exceeds two and two one in the same degree, for two is the same part of four as one is of two, that is to say, they are halves.
Now all agree as to what is absolutely and simply just;
but, as we have already said, they dispute concerning proportionate value;
for some persons, if they are equal in one respect, think themselves equal in all;
others, if they are superior in one thing, think they may claim the superiority in all.
Hence chiefly there arise two sorts of governments, demo­ cracy and oligarchy;
for nobility and merit are to be found only amongst a few ;
1 but their contraries, amongst the many ;
as there is not one man of nobility and merit in a hundred, but many without either are every where.
But to establish a government entirely upon either of these equalities is wrong ;
as is made clear by the example of those so established ;
for none of Neither princi­ ple of equality should prevail exclusively.
them have been stable.
And the reason of this is, that it is impossible that whatever is wrong at the first and in principle should not at last come to a bad result;
and therefore in some things an equality of numbers ought to take place, in others an equality in value.
However, a democracy is safer and less liable to sedition than an oligarchy;
for in this latter it may arise from two causes, the few in power conspiring either against each other, or against the people ;
but in a democracy, men conspire only against the few who aim at exclusive power;
but there is no instance worth speaking of where the people have raised a sedition against themselves.
Moreover, a government composed of men of moderate fortunes comes much nearer to a democracy than to an oligarchy, and is the safest of all such states.
BUT since we are inquiring into the causes of se­ ditions and revolutions in governments, we must assume in general the first principles and causes
Three causes of sedition.
of them.
Now these, so to speak, are much about three in number;
these we must first distinguish in outline from each other, and then endeavour to show in what situation people are who begin a sedition, and for what causes;
and, thirdly, who are the sources of political troubles and mutual quarrels.
1. Under what circumstances men are se­ ditious.
Now, the fact that they are thus or thus disposed towards a change in government, must be laid down as one cause, and is one which we have al­ ready mentioned.
For some raise seditions through desire of equality, if they see those whom they esteem their equals possessed of more than they have themselves ;
others do the same by not being content with equality, but aiming at supe­ riority, if they think, that while they deserve more than their inferiors, they have only an equal share with them, or less.
Now, they may pursue their aim either justly or unjustly;
justly indeed when those who are inferior raise sedition for the sake of equality;
unjustly, when those who are equal do 2.
For what reasons.
(Final cause.) so for superiority.
We have then mentioned the situations in which men will be seditious ;
but the causes for which they will be so are profit and honour, and their contraries ;
for, to avoid dishonour or loss of fortune by fines, either on their own account or that of their friends, they are apt to raise commotions in the state.
The sources and causes of commotions which dispose men in the way which we have mentioned, if we take them in one manner, are seven in number, but in another they are more.
Now two of these are the same with what have been already mentioned, but they act in a different manner ;
for on account of profit and honour men rouse themselves against each other, not to get the possession of them for themselves, (as was said above,) but at seeing others, some jastly, and others unjustly, engrossing them.
The other causes are haughtiness, fear, eminence, contempt, envy of those whose fortunes are beyond their rank.
There are also other things which in a different manner occasion revolutions, as contention, neglect, want of numbers, and too great disparity of circumstances.
The various causes of sedition con­ sidered.
Ill-treatment.
IT is almost self-evident what influence ill-treat­ ment and profit have for this purpose, and how they are causes of sedition ;
for when the magis­ trates are haughty and grasping, they not only raise seditions amongst each other, but against the Profit.
state also which gave them their power;
and this their ava­ rice has two objects, either private property, or the property of the state.
What influence belongs to honours, and how they may occasion sedition, is evident Honours.
enough ;
for those who are themselves unhonoured while they see others honoured, will be ready for any disturbance:
and these things are done unjustly when any one is either hon­ oured or discarded contrary to his deserts, but justly when according to them.
Excessive honours are also a cause of sedition, when one person or more are greater than accords with the state and the power of the government;
for then a monarchy or a dynasty are usually established.
On this ac­ count the ostracism 1 was introduced in some places, as at Argos and Athens:
though it is better to guard against such excess of honours in the founding of a state, than to correct it afterwards when it has been permitted to take place.
Those who have been guilty of crimes will be the cause of sedition through fear of punishment;
as will those also who expect an injury, that they may prevent it before it is inflicted ;
as was the Guilt.

Contempt also is a cause of sedition and conspiracies;

are many who have no share in the administration;
for they fancy that they are superior.
The rich also, even in democra­ cies, thinking lightly of the disorder and anarchy which will arise, hope to better themselves by the same means;
as hap­ pened at Thebes, after the battle of Oenophyta,3where through bad administration the democracy was destroyed;
as it was at Megara,4 where the power of the people was lost through anarchy and disorder.
The same thing happened at Syracuse before the tyranny of Gelo, and at Rhodes before the popular Disproportion­ ate increase.
government was overthrown.
Revolutions in the state also arise from a disproportionate increase;
for as the body consists of many parts, it ought to increase in due proportion, in order to preserve its symmetry, which will otherwise be destroyed;
as if the foot were to be four cubits long, and the rest of the body but two palms;
it might otherwise be changed into an animal of a different form, if it were to increase beyond proportion not only in quantity, but also in disposition of parts.
So also a city consists of parts, one of which may often increase without notice, as the number Accident.
of poor in democracies and free states.
They will also sometimes happen by accident, as at Taren­ tum a little after the Persian wars, where so many of the nobles were killed in a battle by the Iapyges, that from a free state the government was turned into a democracy;
and at Argos, where so many of the citizens were killed in Hebclo­ ma1 by Cleomenes the Spartan, that they were obliged to admit several husbandmen 2 to the freedom of the state:
and at Athens, through the unfortunate event of the war by land, the number of the nobles was much reduced by being chosen into the troops 3 in the war with Sparta.
Revolutions also sometimes take place in a democracy, though more seldom ;
for where the poor increase faster than men of property, the state Governments changed with­ out seditions;
becomes an oligarchy or dynasty.
Governments also sometimes alter without seditions:
by petty contention, as at Heræa:
for which purpose they changed the mode of election from votes to lots, and thus got the contentious parties chosen:
and by negligence, as when the citizens admit to state offices men who are not friends to the constitution :
an event which happened at Orus, when the oligarchy of the archons was suppressed at the election of He­ racleodorus, who changed that form of government into a democratic free state.
Moreover they change by little and little ;
and I mean by this that very and gradually;
often great alterations silently take place in the form of a government, when people overlook small matters ;
as at Am­ bracia, where the census was originally small, but at last became nothing at all, as if a little and nothing at all were nearly or entirely alike.
A state also composed of different nations is liable to seditions until their differences are blended together;
for as a city by diversity of race.
cannot be composed of every multitude, so neither can it in every given time.
For this reason all those republics which have hitherto been originally composed of different people, or have afterwards admitted their neighbours to the freedom of their city, have been most liable to revolutions ;
as when the Achæans joined with the men of Træzen in founding Sybaris;
for soon afterwards, the Historical examples.
former grew more powerful than the Træzenians, and expelled them from the city ;
(hence the Sybarites became under sen­ tence of a curse;
) and again, disputes from a like cause happened at Thurium, between the Sybarites and those who had joined with them in building the city;
for claiming all the country as their own, they were driven out in consequence.
And at Byzantium the new citizens, being detected in plots against the state, were driven out of the city by force of arms.
The Antisseans also, having taken in those who were banished from Chios, afterwards did the same thing ;
and also the Zan­ cleans, after having taken in the people of.
Samoa.
The men of Apollonia on the Euxine, having admitted their sojourners to the freedom of their city, were troubled with seditions ;
and the Syracusans, after the times of their tyrants, having en­ rolled strangers and mercenaries amongst their citizens,2 quar­ relled with each other and came to an open rupture :
and the people of Amphipolis, having taken in a colony of Chalcidians, were the greater part of them driven out of the city by them.
Further causes.
Fancied injus­ tice.
Many persons occasion seditions in oligarchies, because they think themselves ill used in not sharing as equals in the honours of the state with their equals, as we have already mentioned ;
but in democracies the principal people do the same because they have only an equal share with others who are not equal to Local situa­ tion.
them.
The situation of the place will also some­ times occasion disturbances in the state, when the ground is not well adapted for one city;
as at Clazomenæ, where the people who lived in that part of the town called Chytrum quarrelled with those who lived in the island, and the Colophonians with the Notians.
1
At Athens too the disposition of the citizens is not the same ;
for those who live in the Piræeus are more attached to a popular go­ vernment than those who live in the city.
For as the inter- position of a rivulet, however small, breaks the lines of the phalanx, so any trifling disagreement becomes the cause of seditions.
The greatest disagreement perhaps then lies be­ tween virtue and vice, and next to that between poverty and riches, and so on in order, one difference being greater than another ;
and one of these is that which we have mentioned.
BUT seditions in governments do not arise concerning little things, but from them;
for men quarrel concerning something Great effects from trifling quarrels.
Historical ex­ amples. of moment.
Now trifling quarrels are attended with the greatest consequences, when they arise between persons of the first distinction in the state, as was the case with the Syracusans at a remote period:
for a revolution in the government was brought about by a quarrel between two young men who were in office, upon a love affair;
for one of them being ab­ sent, the other, who was a friend of his, seduced his mistress ;
he in his turn took offence at this, and persuaded his friend's wife to come and live with him ;
and upon this they persuaded the whole city to take part either with the one or the other, and caused a complete rupture.
Every one therefore at the beginning of such disputes ought to take care to avoid the consequences, and to smother up all quarrels which may arise amongst those in power;
for the mischief lies in the begin­ ning ;
for the beginning is said to be " half of the business," 1 so that what was then but a little fault, will be found to bear its full proportion to errors in the other parts.
Moreover, disputes between men of note involve the whole city in their consequences;
as in Histiæa, after the Persian war, where two brothers had a dispute about their paternal estate ;
he who was the poorer, because the other had concealed some effects and some money which his father had found, engaged the popular party on his side, while the other, who was rich, the men of fashion.
And at Delphi,2 a quarrel about a wedding was the beginning of all the seditions that afterwards arose amongst them ;
for a bridegroom there, being terrified by some unlucky omen, waited upon the bride, but went away without marrying her ;
in resentment for which her relations put some sacred money into his pocket while he was sacri­ ficing, and then killed him as a sacrilegious person.
At Mi­ tylenè also a dispute which arose concerning heiresses, was the beginning of great evils, and of a war with the Athenians, in which Paches3 took their city ;
for a man of fortune named Timophanes left two daughters, and Doxander, being out­ witted in procuring them in marriage for his two sons, began a sedition, and excited the Athenians against them, as he was a public guest of the city.
4
There was also a dispute at Phocæa concerning an heiress between Mnaseas the father of Mneson, and Euthycrates the father of Onomarchus ;
and this strife brought upon the Phocæans the sacred war.
The go- vernment of Epidamnus1 too was changed from a marriage quarrel;
for a certain man having contracted his daughter in marriage, the father of the young man to whom she was con­ tracted, being Archon, punished him;
whereupon, in resent for the affront, he seditiously joined himself with those who were excluded from any share in the government.
Into what form governments may change.
TheAreopagus.
A government may be changed either into an oligarchy, a democracy, or a free state ;
when the magistrates, or any one part of the city, acquire great credit, or are increased in power;
as the court of Areopagus2 at Athens, which, having procured great credit during the Persian war, added firmness to the administration ;
Growth of the popular power at Athens.
and, on the other hand, the maritime force, com­ posed of the commonalty, having gained the vic­ tory at Salamis,3 by their power at sea got the lead in the state, and strengthened the popular party.
And at Ar­ gos, the nobles, having gained great credit by fighting the battle of Mantinea against the Lacedæmonians, endeavoured to dissolve the democracy.
And at Syracuse, as the victory in their war with the Athenians was owing to the common people, they changed their free state into a democracy;
and at Chal­ cis, the people having destroyed the tyrant Phoxus together with the nobles,1 immediately seized the government;
and at Ambracia also, the people, having expelled the tyrant Peri­ ander with his party, brought round the supreme power to themselves.
And this in general ought not to be forgotten, that whosoever has been the real occasion of a state being powerful, whether private persons, or magistrates, a tribe, or any part of the citizens, or the multitude, be they who they will, they become a cause of disputes in the state.
For either some persons, who envy them the honours they have acquired, will begin to be seditious, or else on account of the dignity they have acquired, they themselves will not be content with their former equality.
A state is also liable to commotions, when those parts of it which seem to be opposite to each other approach close to an equality, as the rich and the common people;
so Seditions arise in states when the middle class is small:
that the part which is between them both is either nothing at all, or too little to be worth notice.
For if the one party is so much more powerful than the other as to be evidently stronger, that other will not be willing to hazard the danger:
for which reason those who are superior in merit never are the cause of seditions ;
for they are too few for that purpose when compared to the many.
In general, then, the begin­ nings and causes of seditions in all states, are such as I have now described, and revolutions in them are brought about in two ways, either by violence or fraud;
and if by violence, then either at first, or by compelling them afterwards to submit.
They may also be brought and from violence or fraud.
about by fraud in two different ways, either when the people, being at first deceived, willingly consent to an alteration in their government, but are afterwards obliged by force to abide by it:
as for instance, when the four hundred1 imposed upon the people, by telling them that the king of Persia would sup­ ply them with money for the war against the Lacedæmonians ;
and after they had been guilty of this lie, they endeavoured to keep possession of the supreme power;
or when they are at first persuaded, and afterwards consent to be governed.
By one or other, then, of the methods above mentioned, all revolutions in governments are brought about.
Whence sedi­ tions arise in a democracy.
WE ought now to inquire separately into the events which will arise from these causes in each species of government.
Democracies will be most subject to revolutions from the dishonesty of their dema­ gogues ;
for partly by informing against men of property, and partly by rousing the common people against them, they induce them to join together, for a common fear will make the greatest enemies unite :
-and this is what any one may con- Historical ex­ amples.
tinually see practised in many states.
In the island of Cos,2 for instance, the democracy was subverted by the wickedness of the demagogues, for the nobles entered into a combination with each other.
And at Rhodes,3 the demagogues distributed bribes, and so prevented the people from paying the Trierarchs what was owing to them ;
and the latter were obliged by the number of actions brought against them, to conspire together and destroy the popular state.
The popular state too was overthrown at Heraclea,4 soon after the settlement of the city, by the same persons;
for the citizens of note, being ill treated by them, quitted the city, but afterwards the exiles banded together and returned, and overthrew the popular ·state.
Just in the same manner the democracy was destroyed in Megara;
for there the demagogues, to procure money by confiscations, kept on driving out the nobles, until the number of those who were banished became considerable;
and those returned and got the better of the people in a battle, and so established an olig­ archy.
The like happened at Cyme, during the time of the democracy which Thrasymachus destroyed;
and whoever considers what has happened in other states may perceive that revolutions have arisen from the same causes.
For often, to curry favour with the people, they drive the nobles to coil­ spire together, either by dividing their estates, or by obliging them to spend them on public services, or by publicly impeach­ ing them, that they may be able to confiscate the fortunes of the wealthy.
In former times, whenever the same person was both demagogue and general, the democracies were changed into tyrannies;
and in-
The generals superseded by demagogues.
deed most of the ancient tyrants were once demagogues.
And there is a reason why such was the case at that time, but not now;
for at that time the demagogues were of the soldiery ;
(for they were not as yet powerful by their eloquence;
) but now that the art of oratory is cultivated, the able speakers lead the people;
1 but, as they are unqualified to act in a military capacity, they cannot impose themselves on the people as ty­ rants, it we except one or two trilling instances.
Formerly, too, tyrannies were more common than now, because great powers were more often in­ trusted to some magistrates then than now;
(as Tyrannies more frequent in ancient times, and why. to the Prytanes2 at Miletus ;
for they were supreme in many things of the last consequence;
) and also because at that time the cities were not of that very great extent, and the people in general lived in the country,.
employed in husbandry, the leaders of public affairs, if they had a turn for war, tried to make themselves tyrants.
All this they did as soon as they had gained the confidence of the people;
and this con­ fidence was their hatred to the rich.
This was the case of Pisistratus at Athens, when he opposed the Pediæans:
1 and of Theaganes in Megara, who slaughtered the cattle be­ longing to the rich, after he had seized those who kept them by the rive-rside.
Theagenes also, on account of having ac­ cused Daphnæus 2 and the rich, was thought worthy of being raised to a tyranny, for in consequence of these enmities, the How a popular government becomes an ochlocracy.
people trusted him as a man of popular principles.
Governments also alter from their ancient demo­ cratic form into one entirely new;
for where magis­ trates are elected without a fixed income, and the election is with the people, the aspirants for office,3 to flatter them, endeavour with all their power to make the people supe.
rior even to the laws.
To prevent this entirely, or at least in a great measure, the magistrates should be elected by the tribes, and not by the people at large.
These are nearly the revolu­ tions to which democracies are liable, and the causes from whence they arise.
How changes arise in oli­ garchies.
-treat-
By ill-treat­ ment of the poor.
THERE are two things which of all others most evidently occasion a revolution in an oligarchy;
one is, if the people are injuriously treated;
for then every person is a ready champion of sedition, and more particularly if one of the oligarchy should happen to be their leader;
as Lygdamis,4 at Naxos, who was afterwards tyrant of that island.
Seditions also which 2. By exclusion of the rich.
arise from different causes will differ from each other;
for sometimes a revolution is brought about by the rich who have no share in the ad­ ministration, which is in the hands of a very few indeed:
and this happened in Massilia,5 and Ister, and Heraclea, and in other cities.
For those who had no share in the govern­ ment ceased not to raise disputes, till they were admitted to it;
first the elder brothers, and then the younger also:
for in some places the father and son are never in office at the same time;
in others, the elder and younger brother.
In the first of these cities, the oligarchy verged upon a free state.
At Ister it was changed into a democracy;
in Heraclea, from being in the hands of a few, it came to consist of six hundred.
At Cnidos,1 the oligarchy was destroyed by the nobles who quar­ relled with each other because the government was in the hands of so few ;
(for there, as we have just mentioned, if the father was in office, the son could not be;
or, if there were many brothers, the eldest only;
) for the people, taking ad­ vantage of their disputes, elected one of the nobles for their general, and got the victory :
for a government torn by sedi­ tions is weak.
2
And formerly at Erythræ, during the oli­ garchy of the Basilidæ, although the state flourished greatly under their excellent management, yet because they were dis­ pleased that the power should be in the hands of so few, the people changed the form of government.
Oli­ garchies also are subject to revolutions, from those who are in office therein, as well as from 3.

the quarrels of the leaders of the people.
Demagogues are of two sorts ;
the one flatter the few when they are in power:
for even among the few there are demagogues;
such were Charicles and his followers at Athens,3 who had great influ­ ence over the Thirty ;
and, in the same manner, Phrynichus 4 over the Four Hundred.
The others are those demagogues who have a share in the oligarchy and flatter the people:
such were the state-guardians5 at Larissa, who flattered the When this will happen.
people, because they were elected by them.
And this will always happen in every oligarchy where the magistrates do not elect themselves, but are chosen out of men either of great fortune or certain ranks by the soldiers or by the people ;
as was the custom at Abydos.
And when the judicial department is not in the hands of the supreme power, the demagogues favour the people in their causes, and so overturn the government;
which happened at Heraclea in Pontus.
And also when some desire to con­ tract the power of the oligarchy into fewer hands ;
for those who endeavour to support an equality, are obliged to apply 4.

to the people for assistance.
An oligarchy is also subject to revolutions, when the nobility spend their fortunes in luxury;
for such persons are desirous of in­ novation, and endeavour either to be tyrants themselves, or to support others in becoming so, as Hipparinus supported Diony­ sius of Syracuse.
1
And at Amphipolis one named Cleotimus collected a colony of Chalcidians, and when they came, he set them to quarrel with the rich:
and at Ægina, a certain per­ son who brought an action against Chares, attempted on that account to alter the government.
Sometimes they try to raise commotions, sometimes they rob the public ;
whence they quarrel with each other, or else fight with those who endea­ vour to detect them ;
as was the case at Apollonia in Pontus.
But if the members of an oligarchy agree among themselves, the state is not very easily destroyed from within itself.
Pharsalus is a proof of this, where, though the place is small, yet the citizens have great power from the prudent use to 5.

which they turn it.
An oligarchy also will be destroyed when they create another oligarchy within it;
that is, when the management of pub­ lic affairs is in the hands of a few, but unequally divided, and when all of the few do not partake of the supreme power.
This happened once at Elis,l where the supreme power in general was in the hands of a very few, and fewer still gained places in the senate, which consisted of but ninety, who held their places for life ;
and their mode of election was calculated to'maintain a dynasty, like that of the senate at Lacedæmon.
An oligarchy is liable to a revolution both in time of war and peace ;
in war, because, through a distrust in the citizens, the government is obliged to employ mercenary troops, and the man to whom they give the command of the army often as­ sumes the tyranny, as Timophanes did at Corinth;
2 and if they appoint more than one general, they will very probably establish a dynasty among themselves ;
and sometimes, through fear of this, they let the people in general have some share in the government, because they are obliged to employ them.
In peace, from their want of confidence in each other, they will intrust the guardianship of the state to mercenaries and their general, who will be an arbiter between them, and some­ times become master of both, a thing which happened at Larissa, when the Aleuadæ had the chief power at Samos.3
The same thing happened at Abydos, during the time of the political clubs, among which the party of Iphiades was one.
Commotions also will happen in an oligarchy, if one party overbears and insults the other, or from their quarrelling about law-suits or marriages.
6. By personal contests.
How their marriages, for instance, will have that effect, has been already shown;
and in Eretria, Diagoras destroyed the oligarchy of the knights on account of a marriage quarrel.
A sedition also arose at Heraclea, from a certain person being condemned by the court;
and at Thebes, in consequence of a man's being found guilty of adultery;
the punishment indeed which Eurytion suffered from the men at Heraclea was just, yet it was illegally executed:
as was that at Thebes upon Archias ;
for their enemies eagerly contended to have them publicly bound in the pillory.
Many oligarchies too have been de- 7. By being too despotic.

stroyed by disaffected persons in the state, owing to their too despotic spirit:
as the oligarchy at Cnidos, and at Chios.
Changes also may happen by accident, in what we call a free state, and in an oligarchy, wherever the senators, judges, and magistrates are chosen according to a certain census.
For it often happens, that what was fixed as the highest census suitable to that time, so that a few only could have a share in the government in an oligarchy, and those of moderate fortunes only in a free state, becomes so little as the city grows rich through peace or some other happy cause, that every one's fortune rises to many times the amount of the census, and so the whole com­ munity partake of all the honours of government;
and this change sometimes happens by little and little, and insensibly approaches, and sometimes more quickly..
These are the re­ volutions and seditions that arise in oligarchies, and the causes to which they are owing:
and indeed both democracies and oligarchies sometimes alter, not into governments of a contrary form, but into other forms of the same government;
as, for instance, from democracies and oligarchies which place the supreme power in the law, they come to vest it in the ruling party, and the contrary.
How seditions arise in an aristocracy.
1. By paucity of numbers.
COMMOTIONS also arise in aristocracies, partly because there are so few persons in power,—(a fact which, as we have already said, shakes oligarchies, because in a certain sense an aristocracy most nearly approaches to an oligarchy ;
for in both these states the administration is in the hands of a few ;
not that this arises from the same cause in both, though it is herein that an aristocracy seems to be oligarchical):
—and these will neces- sarily be most likely to happen when the generality of the people are high-spirited, as thinking themselves equal to each other in merit;
such were those at Lacedæmon, called the Partheniæ,1 (for these were descendants of citizens,) who being detected in a conspiracy against the state, were sent as colonists to Tarentum.
They will happen also when some great men are disgraced by those who have received higher honours than themselves, 2. By disgrace of great men.
but to whom they are no ways inferior in abilities, as Ly­ sander, who was disgraced by the kings:
2 or when an ambi­ tious man cannot get into power, as Cinadon, who, in the reign of Agesilaus, was chief mover of a conspiracy against the Spartans.
And also when some are too poor, and others too rich, which will most frequently happen in time of war ;
as was the case at Lacedæmon, about the time of the Messenian war.
This is proved by a poem of Tyrtæus, called Eunomia ;
for some persons being reduced by war, desired that the lands might be divided.
They arise also when some person of very high rank might still be higher if he could rule alone, which seems to have been the case of Pausanias at Lacedæmon, when he was their general in the Persian war, and that of Hanno3 at Carthage.
But tree states and aristocracies are mostly destroyed by a departure from justice 3. By injustice.
in the administration itself;
the cause of this evil at first is the want of a due mixture of the democratic and oligarchic principle in a free state;
and in an aristocracy from these causes, and also on account of merit;
but chiefly from the former two, I mean, the undue mixture of the democratic and oligarchic parts ;
for these two things are what all free states, and many of those which we call aristocracies, endeavour to Why a free state is more stable than an aristocracy.
blend into one.
For aristocracies differ from what are called polities in this, the one form is less stable, and the other more so :
for that state which inclines most to an oligarchy is called an aris­ tocracy, and that which inclines most to a democracy is called a free state.
And on this account the latter is more secure than the former;
for the greater power is the stronger, and men are more content to live where they have equality.
But the rich, if the community gives them rank, often endeavour to insult and to tyrannise over others.
On the whole, which­ ever way a government inclines, towards that it has a tend­ ency to settle, each party supporting their own men.
Thus a free state will become a democracy;
an aristocracy, an oli­ garchy ;
or the contrary, an aristocracy may change into a democracy, (for the poor, if they think themselves injured, directly take part with the contrary side, and a free state a state
When be called may stable.
into an oligarchy.
The only firm state is that where every one enjoys the equality which befits his merit, and fully possesses what is his own.
And that of which I have been speaking happened at Thu­ rium ;
for the magistrates being elected according to a very high census, it was altered to a lower one ;
and they were sub­ divided into more courts, but because the nobles possessed all the land, contrary to law;
for the state was too much of an oligarchy, so that they were able to encroach on the people;
but the people, being well inured to war, so far got the better of their guards, as to drive out of the country every one who possessed more than he ought.
Moreover, as all aristocracies are free oligarchies, their nobles are apt to grasp at too much power ;
as at Lacedæmon, where property is now in the hands of a few, and the nobles have too much liberty to do as they please, and to make such alliances as they please.
Thus the state of the Locrians1 was ruined from an alliance with Dionysius ;
and this would not have happened in the case of a democracy or a well-

tempered aristocracy.
But aristocracies chiefly ap­ proach to a secret change through being destroyed by degrees, as we have already said of all go­ vernments in general.
And this happens because changes are caused by something which is trifling ;
for when- ever they throw aside any thing which in the least regards the state, afterwards they more readily change something else of a little more consequence, until they subvert the whole government.
This happened in the state of Thurium ;
for as there was a law that its citizens should serve as soldiers for five years, some young men of a martial disposition, who were in great esteem amongst their officers, despising those who had the management of public affairs, and imagining that they could easily gain their end, first endeavoured to abolish this law, with a view of having it declared lawful that the same person might continue in the military, perceiving that the people would readily appoint them.
Upon this, the magistrates ap­ pointed to this matter, who are called counsellors, 1 first joined together with an intention to oppose it, but were afterwards induced to agree to it, from a belief that, if that law was not.
repealed, they would permit the management of all other public affairs to be in their hands ;
but afterwards, when they endeavoured to restrain some from making fresh changes, they could do nothing, for the whole form of government was altered into a dynasty of those who first introduced the innova­ tions.
In short, all governments are liable to be destroyed either from within or from without;
from without, when a state whose policy is con­ trary to their own, is near, or even at a distance, Governments destroyed from within, or from without.
if it has great power.
This happened in the case of both the Athenians and the Lacedæmonians;
for the one every where destroyed the oligarchies, the other the democracies.
What then are the chief causes of revolutions and of dissensions in governments, has been pretty accurately stated.
IT follows next that we consider the means of preserving both governments in general, and each state in particular.
In the first place, then, it is How govern­ ments are pre­ served.
evident, that if we are right as to the causes of their destruction, we know also the means of their preservation ;
for things con­ trary produce contrary effects ;
but destruction and preserva- Danger of neg­ lecting lesser matters.
tion are contrary to each other.
In well-tem­ pered governments it requires much care to watch that nothing be done contrary to law:
and this ought chiefly to be attended to in matters of small conse­ quence ;
for a small transgression comes on with secret step, just as in a family small expenses when often repeated con­ sume a man's income.
For the understanding is deceived thereby, as it were by this sophism,1 " if every part is little, then the whole is little."
Now, this in one sense is true, but in another it is false, for the whole and all the parts together are large, though made up of small parts.
This first step therefore in any matter is what the state ought to guard against.
In the next place, no credit ought to be given to those arguments which are composed to deceive the people ;
for they are confuted by facts.
But what we mean by the sophistical devices of states, has been already mentioned.
How a govern­ ment is render­ ed stable.
You may often perceive both aristocracies and oligarchies continuing firm, not from the stability of their forms of government, but from the wise conduct of the magistrates, both towards those who have a part in the management of public affairs, and those also who have not:
towards those who have not, by never injuring them, and by introducing those who are of most consequence amongst them into office, and by never harshly disgracing those who are desirous of honour, or injuring the multitude for the sake of gain ;
towards themselves and those who have a share, by behaving justly towards each other.
For that equality which the favourers of a democracy seek to establish in the state, is not only just, but convenient also, amongst those who are of the same rank.
And for this reason, if the administration is in the hands of the many, several rules
By making the terms of office short.
which are established in democracies will be very useful;
as to let no one continue in office longer than six months, so that all of the same rank may have their turn;
for between these there is a sort of demo­ cracy, for which reason demagogues are most likely to arise up amongst them, as we have already mentioned.
Besides, by this means both aristocracies and democracies will be the less liable to be corrupted into dynasties.
And this, because it will not be easy for those who are magistrates for a short time, to do as much mischief as they could in a long time;
for it is from hence that tyrannies arise in democracies and oli­ garchies ;
for either those who are most powerful in each state establish a tyranny, as the demagogues in the one and the despots in the other, or else this is done by the chief ma­ gistrates when they are long in power.
Govern­ ments are preserved,' not only by having the means of their corruption at a great distance, but sometimes also by its being very near them ;
for By being very far from, or near to, the means of cor­ ruption.
those who are in continual fear, keep a stricter hand over the state;
1 for which reason it is necessary for those who have the care of the constitution to be able to awaken the fears of the people, that they may preserve it, and not to be remiss in protecting the state, as a night watch, but to make the distant danger appear at hand.
Great care ought also to be used to endeavour to restrain by law the quarrels and dis­ putes of the nobles, as well as to prevent those who are not already engaged in them, from taking a part in them :
for to perceive an evil at its very first approach is not the lot of every one, but of the politician.
To prevent any alteration taking place in an oligarchy or free state, on account of the census, if that happens to continue the same while the quantity of money is increased, it is useful to take a general account of the whole amount of it in former times, to compare it with the present, and to do this every year in those cities where the census is taken yearly, in larger communities once in three or five years;
and if the whole should be found much larger or much less than continual revision
By of the census.
it was at the time when the census was first established in the state, let there be a law either to extend or contract it accord­ ingly, if it increases making the census many times larger, and if it decreases, smaller.
For if this latter be not done in oligarchies and free states, a dynasty is apt to arise in the one, an oligarchy in the other:
if the former be not done, a free state will be changed into a democracy, and oligarchies into free states or democracies.
It is a general maxim in democracies, oligarchies, monarchies, and indeed in all governments, not to let any one By checking excessive honour, acquire a rank far superior to the rest of the community, but rather to endeavour to confer moderate honours for a con­ tinuance,than great ones for a short time ;
(for the latter spoil men, and it is not every one who can bear prosperity:
) but if this rule is not observed, let not those honours which were conferred all at once, be all at once taken away, but and excessive power.
rather by degrees.
But, above all things, let this regulation be made by the law, that no one shall have too much power, by means either of his fortune or of his friends ;
but, if he has, for his excess therein, let it be contrived that he shall be removed from the country.
Now, as many persons stir up seditions that they may enjoy their own manner of living, there ought to be a particular officer
By keeping watch over the citizens.
to inspect the manners of all those whose lives are contrary to the interests of their own state, whether it be an oligarchy, a democracy, or any of the other forms of government.
For the same reason, watch should be kept in turn over those who are most pros­ perous in the city;
and the means of remedy for this is by appointing those who are in the opposite scale to the business and offices of the state.
By opposite I mean, men of cha­ racter and the common people, the poor and the rich.
It is By increasing the middle rank.
well also to blend both these into one body, and to increase the numbers of the middle ranks ;
and this will prevent those seditions which arise from an inequality of condition.
But above all, in every state, it is By excluding venality.
necessary, both by the laws and every other method, that matters be so ordered as to shut out venality from state offices ;
and this ought particularly to be studied in an oligarchy.
For then the people will not be so much displeased when excluded from a share in the go­ vernment—(nay, they will rather be glad to have leisure to attend their private affairs )-as if they suspect that the officers of the state steal the public money ;
then indeed they grieve on two accounts, because they are deprived both of Way of blend­ ing an aristo­ state honours and of profit.
there is one method of blending together a democracy and an aristo- cracy at the same time, if any one should choose to form such a state ;
1 for it would be possible to admit both the rich and the poor to enjoy what cracy and a democracy to­ gether.
they desire.
For to admit all to a share in the government, is democratical;
but to reserve offices for the rich is aristo­ cratical.
This will be done by allowing no public employ­ ment whatsoever to be attended with any emolument;
for the poor will not desire to be in office when they can gain nothing by it, but had rather attend to their own affairs ;
the rich however will choose it, as they want nothing which belongs to the community.
Thus the poor will increase their fortunes by being wholly employed in their own concerns;
and the principal part of the people will not be governed by the lower sort.
To prevent the exchequer from being defrauded, let all public money be delivered out openly in the face of all the citizens, and let copies of the accounts be deposited in the dif­ ferent wards, tribes, and divisions.
But, as the magistrates execute their offices without pay, the law ought to provide proper honours for those who execute them well.
In demo­ cracies also it is necessary that the rich should be protected, not only by not permitting their lands to be divided, but not even the produce of them, which in some states is done im­ perceptibly.
It would be also better if the people would pre­ vent them, when they offer to exhibit a number of unnecessary and yet expensive entertainments2 of plays, torch-races, and the like.
But in an oligarchy it is necessary to take great care of the poor, and to allot them public employments which are profitable ;
and, if any of the rich insult them, to let their punishment be severer than if they insulted one of their own rank ;
and to let estates pass by.
affinity, and not by gift;
and not to permit the same person to have more than one;
for by this means property would be more equally divided, and a greater part of the poor would rise into better circumstances.
By studying equality among the citizens.
It is also serviceable in a democracy and an olig­ archy, to allot those who take less part in public affairs, an equality, or a preference in other things, (as to the rich in a democracy, to the poor in an oligarchy,) except the principal offices of state ;
but to intrust these only, or mostly, to those who are statesmen.
Qualifications of a statesman.
THERE are three qualifications necessary for those who intend to fill the first departments in go­ vernment ;
first of all, an affection1 for the estab­ lished constitution ;
in the second place, abilities wholly equal to the business of their office;
in the third, virtue and justice correspondent to the nature of that particular state in which they are placed ;
for if justice is not the same in all states, it is evident that there must be different species of it.
There may be some doubt, when all these qualifications do not meet in the same person, in what manner the choice shall be made ;
as for instance, suppose that one person is an accomplished general, but a bad man, and no friend to the constitution, while another is just, and a friend to it, how ought the choice to be made ?
We should then consider, of two qualities, which of them the generality possess in a greater, and which in a less, Of the choice of a general;
degree, For this reason, in the choice of a general we should regard his courage more than his cha­ racter, as the more uncommon quality ;
as fewer men partake of military skill than of virtue:
but, to protect of that of a statesman.
the state or manage the finances, the contrary rule should be followed ;
for these require greater vir­ tue than that which the generality possess, but mere knowledge is common to all.
It may be questioned, if a man has abilities for statesmanship, and is well affected to the constitution, what occasion is there for being virtuous, since these two things alone are sufficient to render him useful to the public ?
But it is of use, because those who possess the above qualities are often deficient in prudence ;
for, as men often neglect their own affairs, though they know them, and love themselves, so nothing will prevent them from being dis­ posed towards the commonwealth in the same manner.
In short, whatever is contained in the laws, and which we allow to be useful to states, all contributes to preserve the state ;
but its principal support (as has been often urged) is to secure that the number of those who desire to preserve it shall be greater than of those who wish He should re­ gard the middle class.
to destroy it.
Above all things, one must not be forgotten, though it is forgotten by many governments which are now corrupted, namely, the mean.
For many things which seem favourable to a democracy, destroy a democracy, and many which seem favourable to an oligarchy, tend to destroy it.
Those who think this the only virtue, extend it to an excess ;
for they do not consider that as a nose which varies a little from perfect straightness,either towards being aquiline or flat, may yet be beautiful and agreeable to look at, but that still if any one extend this variation too far, first of all the properties of the part itself will be lost, till at last it can hardly be admitted to be a nose at all, on account of the excess of the rise or sinking-that thus, I say, it is with other parts of the human body.
So also the same thing is true with respect to the other states;
for both an oligarchy and a democracy may vary somewhat from their most perfect form, and yet be well constituted ;
but if any one endeavours to extend either of them too far, at first he will make the government worse, but at last he will bring it to no government at all.
1
The lawgiver and the politician, then, should know well what preserves and what destroys the demo­ cracy of the people or the oligarchy of the few ;
He should study what preserves a state.
for neither the one nor the other can possibly continue without both rich and poor:
but that whenever an entire equality of circumstances prevails, the state must necessarily become of another form;
so that those who destroy these laws 2 which authorize an inequality, destroy the government.
Errors are also made both in democracies and oligarchies:
in democracies, when demagogues make the common people superior to the laws ;
for thus, by setting them at variance with the rich, they divide one city into two;
whereas they always ought to in­ cline to speak in favour of the rich.
In oligarchies, on the contrary, the oligarchic party should speak in favour of the people.
The oaths also which they take in an oligarchy ought to be contrary to what they now are;
for, at present, in some places they swear, " I will be adverse to the common people, and contrive all I can against them;
" whereas they ought rather to suppose and pretend the contrary, and openly to sig­ nify in their oaths that they will not injure the people.
But Education of the young a great preserva­ tive.
of all things hitherto mentioned, that which con­ tributes most to preserve the state is, what is now most despised, to educate children with reference to the state;
for the most useful laws, and most approved by every statesman, will be of no service, if the citizens are not accustomed to and brought up in the princi­ pIes of the constitution ;
of a democracy, if that form is by law established;
or an oligarchy, if it be an oligarchy.
For if there is such a thing as incontinence in an individual, there And to be di­ rected towards the good of the state.
is also in a city.
But to educate a child in a way fitting to the state, is not to do such things as will gratify those who have the power in an oligarchy, or who desire a democracy, but to do those things whereby they will be able to conduct respectively either of these forms of governments.
But now the children of the magistrates in' an oligarchy are brought up delicately, and the children of the poor are made hardy with exercise and labour ;
so that they are both desirous of change, and able to promote it.
In democracies of the purest form a method is pursued which is contrary to their welfare ;
the reason of which is that they define freedom wrongly.
Now, there are two things which seem to be the limits of a democracy, that the people in gene­ ral are supreme, and enjoy freedom ;
for that which is just seems to be equal, and it is just that what the people deter-

mine should be supreme.
Now, their freedom and equality consists in every one's doing as he pleases.
So that, in such a democracy every one may live as he likes;
" as leads his bent,”1 to use the words of Euripides.
But this is wrong, for no one ought to think it slavery, to live in conformity with government, but pro­ tection.
The causes, then, of corruption in different states, and the means of their preservation and continuance, to speak simply, are such as we have related.
IT now remains that we speak of monarchy, the causes of its corruption, and the means of preserv-

ing it.
And indeed almost the same things which have been said of other governments are incident to kingdoms and tyran­ nies ;
for a kingdom partakes of the nature of an aristocracy;
but a tyranny is formed from the worst species of oligarchy and do­ mocracy.
For this reason it is the most injurious to its subjects, as being composed of two bad forms, and retains all the corruptions and the defects of A tyranny em­ bodies two bad principles.
both these states.
Now the source of these two kinds of mon­ archy arises from principles contrary to each other:
for a kingdom is formed to protect the better sort of people against the multitude, and a king is appointed out of the better sort, who are chosen either for their superior virtue, and actions flowing from virtuous principles, or else from their superiority of noble descent;
but a tyrant is chosen out of the meanest populace, as an enemy to the higher class, that the common people may not be oppressed by them.
And this is clear from experience, For the generality of tyrants were indeed mere demagogues, who gained credit with the people by inveighing against the nobles.
Some tyrannies were established in this manner, Who tyrants are;
and how they gain their power.
when the cities were already considerably enlarged;
others, before that time, by kings who exceeded their hereditary power, from a desire of governing despotically ;
while others were founded by those who were elected to the superior offices of state;
(for formerly the people appointed officers for life to be at the head of civil and religious affairs;
) and some were founded by the oligarchs, who chose one out of their body, with the supreme power over the highest magistrates.
By all these means it was easy to establish a tyranny, if they chose it;
for their power was ready at hand, because they were either kings, or else in possession of the honours of state.
Historical examples.
Thus Pheidon1 at Argos and others became ty­ rants, having enjoyed originally the kingly power;
while Phalaris,2 and others in Ionia, from holding state honours.
Panætius at Leontium, Cypselus at Corinth, Pisistratus at Athens, Dionysius at Syracuse, and others, acquired their tyrannies by having been demagogues.
A How mon­ archien are gained.
kingdom, as we have said, partakes much of the nature of an aristocracy, and is bestowed accord­ ing to private worth, or character for virtue, or rank, or beneficent actions, or to these joined with power.
For all persons have gained this power as having benefited cities and states, or as being able so to do;
some by prevent­ ing a people from falling into slavery by war, as Codrus, and some by freeing them from it, as Cyrus ;
or by having founded cities or colonized a country, as the kings of Sparta, Macedon, and the Molossians.
A king desires to be the guardian of his people, that those who have property may suffer no wrong, and that the people in general may live free from injury;
but a tyrant, as has been often said, has no regard to the common good, except for his own advantage.
His only object is pleasure, but that of a king is virtue.
A tyrant therefore is ambitious of engrossing wealth, but a king rather of honour.
The guards too of a king are citizens, but those of a tyrant Symptoms of a tyranny.
are foreigners.
That a tyranny contains what­ ever is bad both in a democracy and an oligarchy is evident;
from an oligarchy it has gain for its end, (for thus only will the tyrant be sure of the continuance of his guards and his luxuries ;
) and it puts no confidence in the people, and therefore deprives them of the use of arms:
it is also common to both an oligarchy and a tyranny to per­ secute the people, and to disperse the population.
It borrows from a democracy its quarrels with the nobles, and the fact that it destroys them publicly and privately, or drives them into banishment, as rivals and an obstacle to the government;
hence naturally arise conspiracies, as the one party desires to govern, and the others are not willing to be slaves.
Hence the advice of Periander to Thrasybulus to take off the tallest stalks,1 hinting thereby, that it was necessary from time to time to make away with the most eminent citizens.
We ought then in reason, as has been already said, to account for the ranges which are incident to a monarchy, from the same causes which produce them in other states ;
for it is on account of injury, terror, and contempt, that many of its subjects conspire against a monarchy.
But of all wrongs, injurious contempt has most

influence on them for that purpose;
sometimes it is owing to their being deprived of their private fortunes.
The dissolu­ tion too of a kingdom and a tyranny are generally the same ;
for monarchs abound in wealth and honour, which all are de­ sirous to obtain.

Injury may be owing to many causes, and either of these is a sufficient cause to excite anger;
and most of those who are led by anger join in a conspiracy, for the sake not of their own advancement, but of revenge.
Thus the plot against the children of Pisistratus arose from the fact that they affronted the sifter of Harmodius, and insulted him also ;
2 Historical examples.
for Harmodius resented the injury done to his sister, and Aristogiton the injury done to Harmodius.
A conspiracy was also formed against Periander, the tyrant of Ambracia, because while drinking with a favourite youth, he asked him if he were as yet with child by him.
Philip too was slain by Pausanias, for permitting him to be affronted by Attalus ;
as was Amyntas the Little, by Dardas, for insulting him on account of his age;
and the Eunuch,4 by Evagoras the Cy­ prian, for in revenge for having taken his son's wife away from him, he slew him as having been injured by him.
And many attacks have been made on tyrants owing to some such personal insult offered by them, as that of Cratæus1 on Archelaus ;
for his familiarity always disgusted him ;
so that even a small pretext became a sufficient plea, namely, that he did not give him one of his daughters to wife, as lie had promised.
For being entangled in a war against Sirrha and Arrhabæus, he gave his elder daughter to the king of Elimæa, and his younger to the son of Arnagentas, thinking that he would thus have less strife with the son of Cleopatra.
But the real origin of his estrangement was his disgust at certain familiarities.
And Hellanocrates of Larissa joined with him in his attack for the same reason ;
for when, in his intercourse with him, he did not fulfil his promise, he thought that the intercourse took place as an act not of affection but of insult.
Parrhon and Heraclides of Ænos, too, slew Cotys, in order to be revenged for the injury offered to their father;
and Adamas revolted from Cotys, considering that he had been insulted;
for he had been castrated by him when a boy.
Many also who have had their bodies scourged with stripes, through resentment have either killed or conspired against their injurers, even when they were in office and in possession of royal dynasties;
as, at Mitylene, Megacles joined with his friends and killed the Penthelidæ, who used to go about strik­ ing those they met with clubs.
Thus, in later times, Smerdis killed Penthilus, for whipping him and permitting his wife to drag him by the feet.
Decamnichus also was the chief cause of the conspiracy against Archelaus, for he was the first to urge others to the assault:
the occasion of his resentment was his having delivered him to Euripides the poet to be scourged ;
for Euripides was greatly offended with him, for having said something of the foulness of his breath.
And many others have been killed or conspired against for such reasons as these.
In like manner through terror:
for terror is one of the causes mentioned above, and this as well in monarchies as in other states.
Thus Artabanes conspired against Xerxes through fear of being accused to him about Darius, whom he had hung without his orders, supposing that he would obtain pardon, and that the king would forget the matter, on account of the splendid banquet which he gave him.
Some kings have been killed through contempt;
as some one conspired against Sar- danapalus, having seen him spinning with his women, if the story be true which historians relate of him;
but if it is not true of him, it may very probably be true of some one else.
Dion also conspired against Dionysius the Younger, because he saw his subjects desirous of the deed, and that he himself was always drunk.
And even some of a man's friends will do this if they despise him ;
for from being trusted by him, they think that they shall not be found out.
Those also who think they shall gain his throne will conspire against a king some­ how or other through contempt ;
for as they are powerful themselves, and despise the danger, on account of their strength, they will readily attempt it.
Thus generals at the head of an army will endeavour to dethrone the monarch, as Cyrus did Astyages,1 despising both his manner of life and his forces ;
because the latter were inactive, and his life effemin­ ate :
thus Seuthes the Thracian, who was general to Amado­ cus,2 conspired against him.
Sometimes men enter into con­ spiracies, on account of more than one of these reasons, as through contempt and desire of gain ;
as Mithridates conspired against Ariobarzanes.
Those also who are of a bold dispo­ sition, and have gained military honours amongst kings, on this account of all others most frequently engage in sedition;
for strength and courage united inspire great bravery :
when therefore these join in one person, he will be ready for con­ spiracies, as he will easily conquer.
Those who conspire against a tyrant through ambition, have a different motive in view from what we have already mentioned ;
for they do not attack tyrants as some do, seeing before them great gains and vast honours;
it is not thus that any of those who conspire through ambition engage in the dangerous enterprise, but the others do so for the aforesaid reason, while these engage in this, as they would in any other noble action, that they may be illustrious and distinguished among others, and so destroy a tyrant, not wishing to gain a tyranny, but renown.
No doubt the number of those who act upon this principle is very small, for we must suppose they regard their own safety as nothing in case they should not succeed;
and they must embrace the opinion of Dion, (which few can do,) when he made war upon Dionysius with a very few troops;
for he said, that let the advantage he made be ever so little, it would satisfy him to have gained it ;
and that should it be his lot to die the moment he had gained footing in his country, he should A tyranny de­ stroyed by ex­ ternal violence;
think this death glorious.
A tyranny also is ex­ posed in one way to destruction, just as each of the other states are, from without, if there be some hostile power superior to it.
For it is evident that the wish to subvert it will exist, owing to the opposition of prin­ ciples, and all who can, will carry into effect what they desire.
And some states are opposed to others, as a democracy to a tyranny;
as says Hesiod,1 " Potters with potters clash for the extreme of a democracy is a tyranny ;
a kingly power is opposed to an aristocracy, from their different forms of government.
For this reason the Lacedæmonians destroyed very many tyrannies;
as did the Syracusans, during the and from within.
prosperity of their state.
And in one way they are destroyed from within, when those who have no share in the power bring about a revolution, as that which happened to Gelo, and lately to Dionysius ;
to the first.
by means of Thrasybulus, the brother of Hiero, who flattered Gelo's son, and urged him to lead a life of pleasure, that he might govern himself;
but the family joined together, and endeavoured to support the tyranny and expel Thrasybu­ lus;
but those of them who combined together seized the opportunity and expelled the whole family.
Dion made war against his relation Dionysius, and being assisted by the people, first expelled him, and afterwards was killed.
As there are two causes which chiefly induce men to conspire against tyrannies, namely, hatred and contempt, one of these, namely, hatred, seems necessarily to belong to tyrants, but con­ tempt also is often the cause of their destruction.
For though, for instance, those who have raised themselves to the supreme power, have generally preserved it, still those who have re­ ceived it from them, to speak the truth, almost immediately all lose it;
for, by falling into an effeminate way of life, they soon grow despicable, and offer many opportunities to con­ spirators.
Part of their hatred we may very fitly ascribe to anger;
for in some cases it becomes their motive to the same actions ;
for it often urges them to act more powerfully than hatred, and they proceed with greater vehemence against those whom they attack, as this passion is not under the di­ rection of reason.
But it happens that persons especially yield to this passion on account of injury;
a matter which oc­ casioned the fall of the Pisistratids and of many others.
But hatred is still more powerful;
for anger is accompanied with grief, which prevents the entrance of reason ;
but hatred is free from grief.
In short, whatever causes may be assigned 'as the destruction of a pure and unmixed oligarchy, and of an extreme democracy, the same may be applied to a tyranny;
for these are distinct forms of tyranny.
But a kingdom is very seldom destroyed by any outward attack;
for which reason it is generally very stable;
but it has the greatest number of causes
Why a king­ dom seldom destroyed by external vio­ lence.
of subversion within.
Of these, two are especial causes ;
the one, when those who share in the regal power excite a sedition, the other, when they endeavour to establish something more like a tyranny by assuming greater power than the law gives ;

A kingdom, indeed, is never erected in our times, but rather monarchies 1 and tyrannies ;

submitted to, and its power is supreme in great matters :
but now a days many are equal, and there are none in any respect so much better than others as to be qualified for the great­ ness and dignity of government over them.
On this account, then, these equals will not willingly submit to be commanded ;
but if any one assumes the government, either by force or fraud, this is a tyranny.
But in the case of he­ reditary kingdoms, we must add one cause of destruction to that which we have mentioned above ;
namely, that many who enjoy it are proper

objects of contempt, and that they are insolent, though the power which they have gained is not despotic, but merely kingly.
Such a state is soon destroyed ;
for a king ceases to exist if the people will not obey, but a tyrant still rules, though they will not.
These and other such like things are the causes of the destruction of monarchies.
How mon­ archies are preserved ;
by due limita­ tion.
BUT, to speak simply, it is clear that monarchies are preserved by means contrary to these.
But to speak of each separately:
a kingdom will stand by keeping the king's power within moderate bounds.
For by how much the less extensive their power is, by so much the longer will their entire go­ vernment of necessity continue ;
for they become less despotic, and more upon an equality of condition with their subjects, and on that account they are the less envied by them.
It was on this account that the kingdom of the Molossi continued so long, and that of the Lacedæmonians,1 owing to the fact that their government from the beginning was divided into two parts, and also to the moderation introduced into the other parts of it by Theopompus, and especially to his establishment of the Ephors;
for by taking something from the power, he increased the duration of the kingdom, so that in some mea­ sure he made it not less but greater.
As they say he replied to his wife,2 when she asked him if he was not ashamed to de­ liver down his kingdom to his children less than what he had received from his ancestors ;
" No," answered he, “for I give it them more lasting."
But tyrannies are preserved in two ways most opposite to each other, one of which is, when the power is delegated from one to the other ;
and in this manner most tyrants govern in their states.
Report says that Peri­ ander founded many of these.
There are also many of them to be met with amongst the Persians.
What has been already mentioned is conducive, as far as any thing can be, to the Tyranny is to be preserved by the disunion of its subjects;
preservation of a tyranny, namely, to keep down those who rise too high, to take off those who are of an aspiring tone, to allow no public meals, no clubs, no education, nor any thing at all, but to guard against every thing which is wont to give rise to high spirits or mutual confidence;
not to suffer schools or learned meetings of those who have leisure for discussion, and to en* deavour by every means possible to keep all the people strangers to each other;
for knowledge increases mutual con­ fidence ;
1 and to oblige all strangers to appear in public, and to live near the city gate,2 that all their actions may be sum­ ciently seen, and that by being kept like slaves they may be accustomed to be humble.
In short, to imitate every thing which the Persians and Barbarians do, to support slavery;
(for all their policy is the same;
) and to endeavour to know what every single subject chooses to do and say, and for this pur­ pose to employ spies :
such were those women whom the Sy­ racusans called Ποταγωγίδες.3
Hiero also used to send out listeners, wherever there was any meeting or conversation ;
for the people dare not speak with freedom for fear of such persons;
and if any one speaks out, there is the less chance of concealment;
and to endeavour that the whole community should mutually accuse and come to blows with each other, friend with friend, the commons with the nobles, and the rich with each other.
It also suits a tyranny to reduce its sub­ jects to poverty, that they may not be able to compose a guard, and that, being employed in procuring their daily bread, they may have no leisure to conspire against their tyrants.
The pyramids of Egypt are a proof by keeping the people poor and employed;
of this, and the votive edifices of the Cypselidæ, and the tem­ ple of Olympian Zeus built by the Pisistratidæ, and the works of Polycrates at Samos ;
for all these have the same effect, to keep the people well employed and poor.
1
It is necessary also to multiply taxes, as at Syracuse in the time of Dionysius,2 who in five years collected all the private property of his sub­ jects into his coffers.
A tyrant also should endeavour to en­ gage his subjects in a war, that they may have employment and may be for ever dependent upon their general.
A king is preserved by his friends;
but it is the part of a tyrant to place no confidence in friends, as every one desires to dethrone him, and these have it specially in their power.
All those things also which belong to an extreme democracy may be done in a tyranny;
as for example, the giving great licence to the women in the house, that they may reveal their husbands' secrets, and great indulgence to slaves for the same reason.
For neither slaves nor women conspire against tyrants;
but when they are treated with kindness, both of them are of ne­ cessity favourers of tyrants and to extreme democracies ;
and the people too in such a state desire to rule alone.
For which reason, flatterers are in repute with both ;
the demagogue in the democracy, for he is the proper flatterer of the people;
and among tyrants, the man who will servilely bend to them;
for this is the business of flatterers.
And for this reason ty­ rants always love bad men, for they rejoice in being flattered, a thing to which no man of a liberal spirit will submit;
for the virtuous love others, but they flatter none.
Bad men too are fit for bad purposes ;
"like to like,"3 as the proverb says.
A tyrant also should show no favour to a man of worth or a freeman;
for he thinks that no one deserves these names but himself;
for he who supports his own dignity, and is a friend to freedom, encroaches upon the superiority and the despotism of the tyrant:
such men, therefore, they naturally hate, as destructive to their government.
A tyrant also should rather admit strangers than citizens to his table and familiarity, for the latter are his ene­ by prefeiring strangers to citizens.
mies, but the others have no design against him.
These and such like matters are marks of a tyranny, and tend to preserve its power, for it has no lack of villany.
But all these things, so to say, may be comprehended in three divisions, for there are three objects which tyranny has in view ;
one of which is, that the citizens shall be The three ob­ jects of a ty­ rant.
of abject dispositions ;
for men of abject spirits never would conspire against any one.
The second is, that they shall have no confidence in each other ;
for while none feel confidence in themselves, the tyrant is safe from overthrow.
For which reason they are always at enmity with men of merit, as hurt­ ful to their government;
not only because they scorn to be governed despotically, but also because they are trustworthy towards themselves and towards others, and because they will not inform against their associates, nor any one else.
The third is, that they shall be without the means of doing any thing ;
for no one undertakes what is impossible for him to perform;
so that without power a tyranny can never be de­ stroyed.
[These then are the three objects to which the wishes of tyrants incline;
for all their tyrannical plans tend to promote one of these ends, that their people may have nei­ ther mutual confidence, nor power, nor boldness of spirit.]
1 Such, then, is one of the two methods of preserving tyrannies, the other proceeds in a way nearly con­ trary to what has been already described;
and it may be discerned from considering the causes
Another method of pre­ serving a ty­ ranny ;
which destroy a kingdom:
for as one cause of that lies in bringing the government nearer to a tyranny, so the safety of a tyranny consists in making the government more nearly like that of a king;
taking good care of only one thing, namely, the power ;
that not only the willing, but the unwilling also, shall submit to it;
for if he once lose this, his tyranny is at an end.
This, then, must be kept as the foundation, but in other particulars the tyrant ought partly to act and partly to affect to seem like a king ;
first, by by affecting the style of a king.
appearing to pay attention to what belongs to the public, and not making such profuse presents as will offend the people, while the money is taken out of the hard labour of their own hands, and given in profusion to mistresses, foreigners, and actors ;
as also by keeping an exact account both of what they receive and pay, a practice which some tyrants ere this have followed, though ruling on this plan they seem rather masters of families than tyrants ;
nor need a tyrant ever fear lest he shall lack money, while he have the supreme power in his own hands.
It is also much better for those tyrants who quit their kingdom, to go without money, than to leave behind them the money which they have hoarded ;
for their regents will be much less desirous of making innovations ;
and these guardians are more to be dreaded than the citizens by tyrants while absent:
for some of the citizens go out with him, but these regents are left behind.
He should also endeavour to appear to collect taxes and to require public services only for purposes of the state, that whenever they are wanted they may be ready in time of war;
and particularly to take care that he appear to collect and keep them, not as his own pro-
The private character of a tyrant.
perty, but as that of the public.
His appearance also should not be harsh, but noble, so that those who meet him shall look on him with veneration rather than with fear;
but this will not be easily accomplished if he is easily despised.
If, therefore, he will not study to acquire any other virtue, yet he ought to aim at political ability, and at impressing on others that opinion of himself.
He should also take care not to appear to be guilty of the least offence against modesty towards the young of either sex, neither himself, nor any of those who are about him :
and not to permit the women of his own family to treat others haughtily, for the haughtiness of women has been the ruin of many ty­ rannies.
With respect to the pleasures of sense, he ought to act apart, directly contrary to the practice of some tyrants at present;
for they do not only continually indulge themselves in them from early morning, and for many days together, but they seem also to desire to have other witnesses of their con­ duct, that they may admire them as happy and fortunate.
But the tyrant ought especially to be moderate in these, and, if not, at least to appear to others to avoid them ;
for it is not the sober man who is exposed either to plots or contempt, but the drunkard ;
not the early riser, but the sluggard.
His conduct in general should also be contrary of almost all that is re­ ported of former tyrants ;
for he ought to improve and adorn his city, so as to seem a guardian and not a tyrant.
More­ over, he ought always to seem to pay particular attention to the worship of the gods, for from persons of such a character, men entertain less fears of suffering any thing contrary to the law, while they suppose that he who governs them is religious and reverences the gods ;
1 and they will be less inclined to raise seditions against such a tyrant, as one who has the gods on his side:
but this must be so done as to give no suspicion of hypocrisy.
He should also show such respect to men of merit in any line, that they shall not think that they could be more honoured, if their fellow-citizens were members of a free state.
He should also distribute all such honours from him­ self, but every censure should come through other officers and the courts of law.
It is also a common preservative of all monarchies not to make one person too great;
but if any, then more than one ;
for they will act as a guard upon each other.
If however it is necessary to intrust any large powers to one person, then he should take care that he be not one of an ardent spirit;
for such a disposition is upon every opportunity most ready to rebel;
and, if it should seem necessary to deprive any one of his power, it is well to do it by degrees, and not to reduce him all at once.
It is also necessary to abstain from all kinds of insolence, more particu­ larly from corporal punishment, and from wanton A tyrant should abstain from acts of violence.
conduct towards young men.
And especially must he be careful in this respect with regard to men of honour;
for as those who love money are touched to the quick when any thing affects their property, so are men of honour and prin­ ciple when they receive any disgrace.
Therefore a tyrant ought either never to employ personal punishment, or if he does, he should let it be only in a paternal manner, and not with insult.
His intercourse too with young men should arise from amatory causes and not from authority;
and upon the whole he should atone for any seeming disgrace by bestow­ ing greater honours.
But of all persons who are most likely to entertain designs against the person of a tyrant, those are chiefly to be feared and guarded against, who regard as nothing the loss of their own lives, so that they can but destroy him;
they ought therefore to beware of those who think either themselves affronted, or those who are dear to them;
for those who are excited by anger to revenge, regard as nothing their own persons ;
for, as Heraclitus 1 says, it is dangerous to fight with an angry man, for he will purchase his object with his A tyrant should side with the powerful party.
lite.
As all cities are composed of two sorts of persons, the rich and the poor, it is necessary that both these should think that they are equally protected by him who governs them, and that the one party should not have it in their power to injure the other;
but that the tyrant should attach to himself that party which is the most powerful.
For if he does this, he will have no occasion either to set free his slaves, or to deprive the citizens of their arms ;
for the strength of either of the parties added to his own will be enough to render him superior to any conspirators.
-But it would be superfluous to go through all such particulars as these ;
for the rule of conduct which the tyrant ought to pursue is evident enough ;
and that is, to affect the character not of a tyrant, but of a guardian and king ;
not the plunderer, but the protector of his subjects ;
and to aim at the middle rank in life, not one superior to all others;
he should, therefore, associate his nobles with him, and flatter his people.
For thus his government will not only be of necessity more honourable, and worthy of imitation, (as it will by ruling over men of worth, and not abject wretches, who perpetually both hate and fear him,) but it will be also more durable.
Let him also frame his life so that his man­ ners may be in accordance with virtue, or at least half good, and not wholly wicked, but only in part.
Oligarchy and tyranny of short duration.
Examples.
INDEED an oligarchy and a tyranny are of all go­ vernments of the shortest duration.
The tyranny at Sicyon, it is true, was the most lasting;
for it remained in the hands of Orthagoras2 and his sons for a hundred years.
The reason of this fact was, that they ruled their subjects with moderation, and were in many particulars obedient to the laws;
Clisthenes too was an able general, and so never fell into contempt;
and they took great care in most matters to be popular.
Clisthenes, at any rate, is reported to have presented a person with a crown, who adjudged the victory to another ;
and some say, that it is the statue of the judge who so decided which is placed in the Agora.
They say also that Pisistratus submitted to be sum­ moned upon a charge into the court of Areopagus.
The second in duration was the tyranny of the Cypselidæ at Cor­ inth, which continued seventy-three years and six months ;
for Cypselus was tyrant there thirty years, Periander forty-four, and Psammetichus, the son of Gordias, three years.'
And the reason of this was that Cypselus was a popular man, and continued in his government without guards ;
and Periander ruled like a tyrant, but then he was an able general.
The third was that of the Pisistratidæ2 at Athens;
but it was not continual:
for Pisistratus himself was twice expelled during his tyranny;
so that out of thirty-three years he was only fifteen in power, and his son eighteen ;
so that the whole time amounted to thirty-five years.
Of the rest we shall mention that of Hiero and Gelo at Syracuse ;
3 but even this did not continue long, for both their reigns together were only eighteen years ;
for Gelo, having reigned seven years, died in the eighth year of his tyranny, and Hiero in his tenth.
Thrasybulus too was expelled in his eleventh month, and the greater part of other tyrannies have continued a very short time.
We have now gone through nearly all the general causes of corruption and means of preservation both in free states and Why great men seldom arise.
monarchies.
In the Republic of Plato1 Socrates treats upon the changes incident to different go­ vernments ;
but his discourse is faulty;
for he does not particularly mention to what changes the best and first form of polity is liable;
for he only assigns the general cause, that nothing is immutable, but that in a fixed course of time every thing alters ;
2 and that the principle of these changes is to be found in those things of which the sesqui-tertian pro­ geny, conjoined with the pentad [and thrice increased], affords two harmonies.
He says also that this happens when the num­ ber of this diagram becomes solid, in consequence of nature pro­ ducing sometimes bad men and sometimes those who are made better by education.
3
And in saying this, probably, he is not wrong ;
for it may be that there are some persons, whom it is impossible by any education to make into good men.
But Plato's cycle of govern­ ments faulty.
why should this change be more peculiar to what he calls the best-formed government, than to all other forms, and indeed to all other things that exist ?
And with respect to time, which he assigns as the cause of the alteration of all things, we find, that things which did not begin to exist at the same time, cease to be at the samu time;
so that, if any thing came into beginning the day before the solstice, it must alter at the same time.
Besides, why should such a form of government be changed into the Lacedaemonian ?
for, in general, when governments alter, they Jter into the contrary species to what they before were, and jot into one like their former.
And this reasoning holds true if other changes ;
for he says, that from the Lacedæmonian form it changes into an oligarchy, and from thence into a de­ mocracy, and from a democracy into a tyranny:
but yet some­ times the contrary change takes place ;
as from a democracy into an oligarchy, rather than into a monarchy.
With respect to a tyranny, he omits to say whether there will be any change in it or not, and for what reason;
or, if so, into what other state it will pass.
But the reason of this is, that that could not easily have laid the matter down, for a tyranny is an in­ determinate government;
and, according to him, every state ought to alter into the first and most perfect form;
for thus the continuity and circle would be preserved.
But one ty­ ranny often changes into another;
as at Sicyon, from' Muro to Clisthenes ;
or into an oligarchy, as did that of Antileon at Chalcis;
or into a democracy, as that of Gelo at Syracuse;
or into an aristocracy, as that of Charilaus at Lacedæmon, and at Carthage.
An oligarchy is also changed into a ty­ ranny :
such was the rise of almost all the ancient tyrannies in Sicily:
at Leontium, into the tyranny of Panætius;
at Gela, into that of Oleander ;
at Rhegium, into that of Anax­ ilaus;
and the like in many other cities.
It is absurd also to suppose that a state is changed into an oligarchy, because those who are in power are Further de­ fects in his theory.
avaricious and greedy of money, and not because those who are by far richer than their fellow-citizens think it unfair that men who have nothing should have an equal share in the state with themselves who possess so much;
for in many oli­ garchies it is not allowable to be employed in money-getting, and there are many laws to prevent it.
But in Carthage, which is a democracy, money-getting is allowed, and yet their form of government remains unaltered.
It is also absurd to say, that in an oligarchy there are two cities, one of the poor, and another of the rich;
for why should this happen to them more than to the Lacedæmonians, or to any other state where all possess not equal property, or where all are not equally good ?
For though no one member of the community should be poorer than he was before, yet an oligarchy may change to a democracy, if the poor chance to outnumber the rest;
and from a democracy to an oligarchy, if the rich chance to be more powerful than the poor, and the one too negligent, and the other industrious :
and though these changes are owing to many causes, yet he mentions but one only, that the citizens jecome poor by luxury and payment of interest;
as if at first they were all rich, or the greater part of them.
But this is false.
The truth is, that when some of the principal rulers lose their fortunes, they will endeavour to bring about a revo­ lution ;
but when others do so, nothing of consequence will follow ;
nor when such states alter, do they change into a democracy more than into any other form.
Besides,' if they share not in the honours of the state, or if they are ill-used and insulted, they will endeavour to raise seditions and bring about a revolution, although they may not squander their for­ tunes, that they may be allowed to do as they like :
and the The real mis­ take of Socrates.
cause of this, as Plato says, is too much liberty.
Although there are many oligarchies and demo­ cracies, yet, in treating of their changes, Socrates speaks of them as if there was but one of each sort.
IT has been already shown, then, what and how great varia­ tions there may be in the supreme deliberative council of a state, and in the appointment of the different magistracies;
and also as to the judicial department, what is best suited to each state ;
and also from what causes and sources both the destruction and preservation of governments arise.
As there are very many species of democracy as well as of the other states, it will not be amiss at the same time to con­ sider any thing which remains to be said1 concerning either of them, and to assign to them that mode of conduct which is peculiar and advantageous to each;
and also to inquire into the combinations of all the different modes of government which we have mentioned ;
Different corn­ binations of governments.
for as these are blended together, governments shift their form, so as from an aristocracy to become an oligarchy, and from a free state to become a democracy.
Now, by those combinations2 of governments which ought to be examined, though as yet we have not done so, I mean, whether the deli­ berative department and election of magistrates is regulated in a manner correspondent to an oligarchy, and the judicial to an aristocracy, or this and the deliberative part only like an oligarchy, and the election of magistrates like an aristocracy ;
or whether in any other manner every thing is not regulated in conformity to the nature of the government.
We have al­ ready considered indeed what particular sort of democracy is fitted to a particular city, and also what particular oligarchy to a particular people;
and of the other states, what is ad­ vantageous to each.
But nevertheless it is also necessary, not only to show clearly which of these governments is best for a state, but also briefly to inquire how we ought to arrange both these and the other forms of government.
And, first, let us speak of a democracy;
this will at the same time show clearly the nature of its opposite, which some persons call an oligarchy ;
and in doing this The component parts of a de­ mocracy.
we must take into account all the parts of a democracy and every thing that is connected therewith.
For from the manner in which these are compounded together, different species of democracies arise;
and hence it is that they are more than one, and of various natures.
Now, there are two causes whence it arises that there are many kinds of democracy ;
one of which is that which we have already mentioned, namely.
These differ in different coun­ tries.
there being different sorts of people for in one country the people are husbandmen, in another mechanics and hired servants.
Now, if the first of these is added to the second, and the third to both of them, the democracy will not only differ in the particular of better or worse, but in the fact that it is no longer the same govern­ ment.
The other cause is that of which we are now about to speak.
The different matters which are connected with de­ mocracies, and seem to be proper to this form of government, by being combined together, produce changes in democracies ;
for some few particulars will attend on one form, on another more, and on a third all.
It is useful also to be acquainted with each particular, if any one would found any state of which he may happen to approve, for the purpose of amending it.
For all founders of states endeavour to comprehend within their own plan every thing of nearly the same kind with it;
but in doing this they are mistaken in the manner which we have already described in treating of the preservation and de­ struction of governments.
I will now speak of the first prin­ ciples, and character, and aims of such polities.
Liberty the end of a de­ mocracy.
Now the very foundation1 of a democratical state is liberty, and people have been accustomed to say this, as if under this government alone could men have a share of liberty ;
for they affirm, that this is the end proposed by every democracy.
But it is one element of liberty to govern and be governed in turns;
for, according to the justice which prevails in a democracy, equality is mea­ sured by numbers, and not by worth ;
and, as justice is such, it is necessary that the supreme power should be vested in the people, and that what the majority determine should be deemed final and just;
for they say that every single citizen ought to possess equality.
So that in a democracy the poor ought to have more power than the rich, as being, the greater number, and that which is decreed by the majority is supreme.
This, then, is one mark of liberty, which all framers of a democracy lay down as a criterion of that state :
another is, that every one may live as he likes;
Tests of a de­ mocracy.
for this, they say, is a right peculiar to liberty, since he is a slave who must live as he likes not.
This, then, is the second criterion of a democracy.
Hence arises the claim to be under no subjection to any one upon any account except by rotation.
This also is conducive to that equality which is in accordance with liberty.
These things being premised, and such being the government, such rules as the following must be observed in it:
that all the magistrates should be chosen out of all the people, and all to com- Rules for the administration of a democracy.
mand each, and each in his turn all;
that all the magistrates should be chosen by lot to all offices, except perhaps to those only which require some particular skill and experience;
that no census, or a very small one, should be required to qualify a man for any office;
that no one should be employed in the same office twice, or very seldom, only in few posts except in the army;

for in that case it gradually loses its power;
for if they be well paid, the people bring all causes before themselves by appeal, as we have already mentioned in the preceding part of our treatise.

be done, at least the magistrates, the judges, the senators, and members of the supreme assembly, as also those officers who are obliged to eat at a common table, ought to be paid.

ments.2
In this state also no office should be held for life;
but if any such should remain after the government has been long changed into a demo­ cracy, they should endeavour by degrees to diminish its power, and also elect by lot instead of vote.
These things, then, ap­ pertain to all democracies;
and they arise from that kind of justice which is suited to those governments;
(that is, that all its members shall enjoy an equality according to number;
) which seems chiefly to constitute a democracy, or government Equality the means to liberty.
of the people.
For it is held to be fit that the rich should have no more share in the govern­ ment than the poor, nor be alone in power;
but that all should be equal according to number;
for thus, they think, the equality and liberty of the state is likely to be best preserved.
How equality to be brought about.
IN the next place we inquire, how they shall at­ tain this equality.
3
Shall the fortune of five hun­ dred be divided amongst a thousand, and these thousand have equal power with the five hundred ?
or shall we establish our equality in another manner, dividing as be­ fore, and afterwards taking an equal number both out of the five hundred and the thousand, and then investing them with the power of creating the magistrates and judges ?
Is this state then established according to perfect democratical justice, or rather that which is guided by numbers only?
For the defenders of a democracy say, that that is just which the ma­ jority approve of;
but the favourers of an oligarchy say, that that is just which seems right to the wealthier part.;
and that we ought to be directed by the amount of property.
But both the propositions are unequal and unjust, for if we agree with what the few propose, we erect a tyranny ;
—(for if it should happen, that one individual has more than the rest who are rich, according to oligarchical justice this man alone has a right to the supreme power ;
)—but if superiority of numbers is to prevail, injustice will then be done, by confiscating the property of the rich, who are few, as we have already said.
What then that equality shall be, which both 'parties will admit, must be collected from the definition of right which is common to them both ;
for they both say, that what the ma­ jority of the state approves ought to be estab­ lished.
1
Be it so, but not entirely;
but, since a city happens to be made up of two different ranks
By vote of the majority.
of people, the rich and the poor, let that be established which is approved of by both of these, or by the greater part;
but, should contrary sentiments arise, let that be established which shall be approved of by the greater part, and by those who have the greater property.
For instance, if there should be ten rich men and twenty poor, and six of the first and fifteen of the last should agree upon any measure, and the remaining four of the rich should join with the remaining five of the poor in opposing it, that party whose census when added to­ gether is greater, should determine which opinion shall be law ;
2 and should these happen to be equal, it should be re- garded as a case similar to the assembly or a court of justice now-a-days dividing equally upon any question that comes before them ;
for in such cases they must determine it by lot or some other such method.
But although, with respect to what is equal and just, it may be very difficult to establish the truth, yet it is much easier to do so, than to persuade those who have it in their power to encroach upon others, to be guided thereby;
for the weak always desire what is equal and just, but the powerful pay no regard to it.
1Democracy of four kinds.
The best kind.
THERE are four kinds of democracies.
The best of them is that which is first in order, as has been said in a former place ;
and this also is the most ancient of them all.
I call that the first which every one would so place, if he were to divide the people ;
for the best part of these are the husbandmen.
A democracy may be framed where the majority live by tillage or pastur­ age :
for, as their property is but small, they have no leisure perpetually to hold public assemblies, but are continually employed in following their own business, not having other­ wise the means of living ;
nor are they desirous of what an­ other enjoys, but prefer to follow their own business rather than meddle with state affairs, and accept offices which will be attended with no great profit.
For the greater part of man­ kind are desirous of riches rather than honour.
And here is one proof:
for they submitted to tyrannies in ancient times, and now they submit to oligarchies, if no one hinders them in their usual occupations, or deprives them of their pro­ perty ;
for some of them soon get rich, and others are removed
The right of αίρεσις and εὐθύνη.
from poverty.
Besides, their right of electing magistrates and of calling them to account, will satisfy them, if they feel any desire of honours.
great historian has here exactly understood the meaning of Aristotle, see Goëttling's note in loco.
For in some democracies, though the right of electing the ma­ gistrates is not in hands of the commonalty, yet it is invested in part of that body chosen to represent them, as was the case at Mantinæa;
and it is sufficient for the people at large to pos­ sess the deliberative power.
Now this we ought to consider as a species of democracy ;
and for this reason it is proper and also customary for that democracy of which we have now been treating, to have a power of choosing their magistrates, and of censuring them, and of sitting in judgment upon all causes:
but that the chief magistrates should be elected according to a certain census, higher according to the rank of their office, or else not by a census at all, but merely according to their abilities.
A state thus A census de­ sirable in the chief magis­ tracies.
constituted must be well constituted ;
for the magistracies will always be filled with the best men;
for the people will acquiesce, and will feel no envy against their betters ;
and these and the nobles should be content with this part in the administration ;
for they will not be governed by their inferiors.
They will also rule justly, as others will censure their conduct;
for it is serviceable to the state to have them dependent upon others, and not to be permitted to do whatsoever they choose ;
for the power of doing whatever a man pleases affords no possible check against that evil particle which is in every man.
It is necessary, therefore, and useful to the state, that its offices shall be filled by the principal persons whose characters are unblemished, and that the people shall not be oppressed.
It is now evident that this is the best species of demo­ cracy, and on what account;
because the people are of a particular character.
In order to turn the populace to husbandry, some of those laws which were observed in many ancient states are all of them useful:
as, for instance, on no account

A community of husband­ men ;
to permit any one to possess more than a certain quantity of land, or within a certain distance from the city.
Formerly also, in some states, no one was allowed to sell his original lot of land.
There is also a law, which they call a law of Oxylus,1 the effect of which is, to forbid any one to add by usury to his income arising from land.
We ought also to steer by the law of the Aphytæans,2 as useful towards our present purpose.
For they had but very little ground, while they were a numerous people, and at the same time were all husbandmen, and so did not include all their lands within the census, but divided them in such a manner, that, according to the census, the poor had more power than the rich.
Next and of shep­ herds.

open air all night,
The generality ot the people of whom the other democracies are composed, are much worse than these ;
for their lives are wretch­ ed, nor is there room for virtue in any business which they take in hand, whether they be mechanics, petty traders, or hired servants.
And, moreover, as all this sort of men frequent the exchange and the citadel, in a word, they can readily attend the public assembly ;
whereas the husbandmen, being more dispersed in the country, cannot so easily meet together, nor are they as desirous as the others of meeting

thus.
W hen a country happens to be so situated that a great part of the land lies at a distance from the city, there it is easy to establish a good demo­ cracy, or a free state,1 for the people in general is obliged to form its settlements in the country;
so that it will be neces­ sary in such a democracy, though there may be a town popu­ lation near, never to hold an assembly unless the inhabitants of the country attend.
We have shown, then, in what manner the first and best democracy ought to be established, and it will be equally evident as to the rest;
for it is necessary to make a correspondent deviation, always separating the worst of The worst form of democracy.
the people from the rest.
But the last and worst form is that which gives a share to every citizen;
a thing which few cities can bear, nor is it easy to preserve it for long, unless well supported by laws and manners.
We have already noticed almost every cause that can destroy either this or any other state.
Those who have taken the lead in such a democracy have endea­ voured to establish it, and to make the people powerful, by collecting together as many persons Methods by which this form is brought about.
as they could, and giving them their freedom, not only legiti­ mately but naturally born, and also if either of their parents were citizens, that is to say, on the father or mother's side.
This method is better suited to this state than any other:
and thus the demagogues have been wont to manage.
They ought, how­ ever, not to collect thus any longer than the common people are superior to the nobles and those of the middle rank, and then to stop ;
for, if they proceed further, they will make the state disorderly, and excite the nobles to feel indignant at the power of the common people ;
which was the cause of the insurrection at Cyrene:
1 for a little evil is overlooked, but when it becomes great, it strikes the eye.
It is moreover very useful, in such a state, to adopt the means which Clisthenes used at Athens, when he was desirous of increasing the power of the people, and as those did who established the democracy in Cyrene ;
that is, to institute many tribes and fraternities, and to reduce the religious rites of private persons to a few, and those com­ mon;
and every means is to be contrived to associate and blend the people together as much as possible;
and that all former customs be broken through.
Moreover, whatsoever practice belongs to a tyranny, seems adapted to a democracy of this species ;
as for instance, the licentiousness of the slaves, the women, and the children ;
(for this to a certain degree is . useful in such a state ;
) and also to overlook every one's living as they choose.
For many will support such a government as this:
for it is more agreeable to many to live without any con­ trol than with moderation.
IT is also the business of the legislator, and all those who would establish a government of this sort, not to make it too great a work or too per- Stability to be chiefly con­ sulted.
feet, but to aim only at rendering it stable.
For, let a state be constituted ever so badly, there is no difficulty in its con­ tinuing for two or three days:
they should therefore endeavour to procure its safety by all those ways which we have de­ scribed in assigning the causes of the preservation and destruction of governments;
avoiding what is hurtful, and framing such laws, both written and unwritten, as shall con­ tain those things which chiefly tend to the preservation of the state;
and they should not suppose that any thing is useful either for a democratic or an oligarchic form of government, which contributes to make it more purely so, but what will Faults in ex­ isting demo­ cracies.
contribute to its duration.
But our demagogues at present, to flatter the people, occasion frequent confiscations in the courts.
For which reason those who have the welfare of the state really at heart should act on the opposite side, and enact a law to prevent forfeitures from being divided amongst the people or paid into the trea­ sury, but to have them set apart for sacred uses.
For those who are of a bad disposition would not then be the less cautious, as their punishment would be the same;
and the community would not be so ready to condemn those on whom they sit in judgment, when they are about to get nothing by it.
They should also take care that the causes which are brought before the public should be as few as possible, and punish with the utmost severity those who bring an action against any one without cause ;
for it is not the commons, but the nobles, whom they are wont to prosecute.
But in all things the citizens of the same state ought to be affectionate to each other, or at the least not to treat those who have the chief power in Regulations to be observed in popular assem­ blies.
it as their enemies.
Now, as the democracies which have been lately established are very nu­ merous, and it is difficult to get the common people to attend the public assemblies unless they are paid for it, this is against the interest -of the nobles, when there is not a sufficient public revenue.
For the deficiencies must be necessarily made up by taxes, confiscations, and fines imposed by corrupt courts of justice :
things which have already destroyed many democracies.
Whenever, then, the revenues of the state are small, there should be but few public assemblies;
and the courts of justice should have extensive jurisdiction, but continue sitting a few days only;
for by this means the rich will not fear the expense, although they receive nothing for their attendance, though the poor do;
and judgment also will be given much better ;
for the rich will not choose to be long absent from their own affairs, but will willingly be so for a short time.
And, when there are sufficient revenues, a . different conduct ought to be pursued from what the dema­ gogues at present follow ;
for now they divide the surplus of the public money amongst the poor;
these receive it, and again want the same supply;
while the giving such help to the poor is like pouring water into a sieve.
But the true patriot in a democracy ought to take care that the majority are not too poor, for this is the cause of rapacity in that government.
He should Each of the poor should be made inde­ pendent.
endeavour, therefore, that they may enjoy a lasting plenty ;
and as this also is advantageous to the rich, what can be saved out of the public money should be put by, and then divided at once among the poor, if possible, in such a quantity as may enable every one of them to purchase a little field ;
or, if that cannot be done, at least to give each of them enough to pro­ cure the implements of trade and husbandry ;
and if there is not enough for all to receive so much at once, then to divide it acording to tribes, or any other allotment.
In the mean time, let the rich pay them for the necessary attendance, and cease from lavishing them on useless shows.
And something like this was the manner in which they manage at Carthage, and so preserve the affections of the people;
for, by continually sending some of their community into colonies, they procure plenty.
It is also worthy of a sensible and generous nobility, to divide the poor amongst them, and to induce them to work by supplying them with what is necessary ;
or to imitate the conduct of the people at Tarentum:
1for by permitting the poor to partake in common of every thing which is needful for them, they gain the affections of the commonalty.
They have also two different ways of electing their magis­ trates ;
for some are chosen by vote, others by lot;

some share in the administration;
by the former, that the state may be well governed.
It is also possible to accomplish the same thing, if of the same magistrates some are chosen by vote, and others by lot.
And thus much for the manner in which democracies ought to be established.
The constitu­ tion of an oligarchy.
FROM what has been already said, it will be almost manifest how an oligarchy ought to be founded.
For it is right to draw conclusions from things which are contrary, and to frame every species of oligarchy by a kind of analogy, corresponding to some opposite species of democracy.
The best kind.
The purest and best-framed oligarchy is one which approaches most nearly to what we call a free state ;
in which there ought to be two different standards of income, the one made high, the other low.
From those who are within the latter, the ordinary officers of the state ought to be chosen ;
from the former, the supreme magistrates :
nor should any one be excluded from a part of the administration who is within the census ;
which should be so regulated that the commonalty who are included in it should, by that means, be made superior to those who have no share in the govern­ ment.
For those who are to take their share in public affairs ought always to be chosen out of the better sort of the people.
The next kind.
Much in the same manner ought the next kind of oligarchy to be established, by drawing the rule a little tighter;
but as to that which is most opposite to a pure

democracy, and approaches nearest to a dynasty and a tyranny, as it is of all others the worst, so it requires the greatest care and caution to preserve it.
For as bodies of sound and healthyconstitutions, and ships which are well manned and well adapted for sailing, can bear many defects without perishing thereby, while a diseased body, or a leaky ship with an indifferent crew, cannot support the least shock;
just so the worst-established governments want the Tests of sta­ bility in a de­ mocracy and an oligarchy.
most careful attention.
A number of citizens is the preservation of a democracy;
for they are a body opposed to those rights which are founded in rank;
while on the contrary, the preservation of an oligarchy depends upon the due regulation of the dif­ ferent orders in the society.
As the greater part of the community is divided into four sorts of people, husbandmen, mechanics, petty traders, and hired servants;
and, as those Where an oli­ garchy can be established.
who are useful in war may likewise be divided into tour sorts, the horseman, the heavy-armed soldier, the light-armed, and the sailor;
wherever the nature of the country admits of a great number of horse, there a powerful oligarchy may be easily established.
For the safety of the inhabitants depends upon a force of that sort;
but those who can support the expense of horsemen must be persons of some considerable fortune.
Where the troops are chiefly heavy-armed, there an inferior oligarchy may be established ;
for a heavy-armed force is com­ posed more out of the rich than the poor, but the light-armed and the sailors always contribute to support a democracy.
But where the number of these is very great, and a sedition arises, the other parts of the community fight at a disadvan­ tage ;
but a remedy for this evil is to be learned from skilful generals, who always mix a proper number of light-armed soldiers with their horse and heavy-armed.
For it is in this way that the populace get the better of the men of fortune in an insurrection ;
for being lighter, they are easily a match for the horse and the heavy-armed.
So that for an oligarchy to form a body of troops from these is to form one against itself.
But as a city is composed of different ages, some young and some old, the fathers should teach their sons, while they are still very young, the light and easy exercises;
and when they are grown up from childhood, they should be perfected in war­ like exercises in general.
Now, the admission of the people to any share in the government, as I said before, should be either regulated by a census, or else, as at Thebes, allowed to those who for a How to regu­ late the ad­ mission of the people to office.
certain time have ceased from any mechanic employment;
or as at Massalia, where they are chosen according to their worth, whether citizens or foreigners.
With respect to the magis­ trates of the highest rank, which it may be necessary to have in the state, their services to the public should be strictly laid down, to prevent the common people from being desirous of a share, and also to induce them to regard their magistrates with favour, as men who pay a large price for their honours.
It is also fitting that the magistrates, upon entering into office, should make magnificent sacrifices, and erect some public structure, that the people, partaking of the entertainment, and seeing the city ornamented with votive gifts in their temples and public structures, may see with pleasure the stability of the government:
the nobles will thus gain lasting records of their generosity.
But now this is not the conduct of those who are at present at the head of an oligarchy, but quite the con­ trary ;
for they are not more desirous of honour than of gain ;
for which reason such oligarchies may more properly be called little democracies.
Let it then suffice to have laid down thus much as to the principles on which a democracy and an oli­ garchy ought to be established.
What magis­ tracies are ne­ cessary.
AFTER what has been said, it follows next to dis­ tinguish accurately concerning the magistracies ;
of what nature they should be, how many, and for what purpose, as I have already mentioned:
for without the necessary magistrates no state can exist, nor without those who contribute to its dignity and good order can it exist hap­ pily.
Now it is necessary, that in small states the magistrates should be few, in large ones many;
it is well also to know what offices it is suitable to join together, and what ought to be separated.
Inspectors of the market.
The first thing necessary is to establish proper regulations in the markets ;
for which purpose a certain officer should be appointed, to inspect all contracts, and to preserve good order;
for, of necessity, in almost every city there must be both buyers and sellers, to supply each others' mutual wants, and this is the readiest means towards independence ;
for the sake of which men seem first to have joined together in one community.
2
A second care, and nearly related to the first, is to have an eye both to the public and private edifices in the city, that they may be ornamented ;
and also to Of the public buildings, etc. take care of all buildings which are likely to fall, and of the repair of highways;
and also to see that the land-marks between different estates are preserved, that they may live free from disputes, and all other business of a like nature.
Now such an office as this is called by most an inspectorship of the city, and the business itself may be divided into several branches, over each of which in populous cities they appoint a separate person ;
one to inspect the buildings, another the foun­ tains, and another the harbours.
There is a third office, most necessary, and very like the last, and conversant nearly about the same objects;
only its sphere lies in the country and the suburbs or the city.
These officers some persons call inspectors of the lands, and others, inspectors Of lands.
of the woods;
these then are three matters of care.
But there must also be another magistracy appointed, to receive the public revenue, from whose safe-keeping it is to be delivered out to those who are in the different departments of the state ;
these are called receivers or quæstors.
Quæstors.
There must also be another, before whom all private contracts and sentences of courts shall be enrolled;
and before these same, as well as the magistrates, must be brought all indictments and openings of pleadings.
Sometimes this employment is divided amongst many, but there is one supreme over the rest;
these are called proctors, notaries, and other like names.
Next to these is an officer, whose business is of all others the most Notaries, etc.
Court for the recovery of fines.
necessary, and yet most difficult;
namely, the exaction of penalties from those who are condemned, the recovery of fines, and the charge of the persons of prisoners.
This office is very difficult, on account of the odium attending it, so that no one will engage in it unless it is made very profitable, nor, if he does, will he be willing to execute it according to law,;
but it is most necessary, as it is of no service to pass judgment in any cause, except that judgment is carried into execution ;
for if human society cannot subsist without actions at law, it certainly cannot exist without the infliction of penalties.
For this reason it is best that this office should not be executed by one person?
but by some of the magistrates of other courts.
In like manner, endeavour should be made that the levying of fines which are ordered by the judges, shall be divided amongst different persons.
And further, that different magis­ trates shall judge different causes;
new judges trying novel matters in preference ;
and as to those which are already ruled, let one person pass sentence, and another see it executed ;
as, for instance, let the curators of the public buildings execute the sentence which the inspectors of the markets have passed, and conversely in other cases ;
for in proportion as less odium attends those who carry the laws into execution, by so much the easier will they gain their proper end.
Therefore for the same persons to pass the sentence and to execute it,,will sub­ ject them to double hatred ;
and if the same judges pass sen­ tence in all cases, they will be considered as the enemies of all.
And in many places a different magistrate has custody of the prisoner, while another sees execution done upon him ;
as the eleven at Athens:
for which reason it is prudent to se­ parate these offices, and to seek out a plea for arranging this matter.
For it is no less than any matter of care already mentioned;
for it so happens that men of character will de­ cline accepting this office, and worthless persons cannot pro­ perly be intrusted with it, as being themselves rather in want of a guard, rather than qualified to guard others.
This, there­ fore, ought by no means to be a separate office from others ;
nor should it be permanently allotted to any individuals, but to the young men;
and where there is a band of young men or a city guard, the youths ought in turns to take these offices upon them.
These, then, as the most necessary magistrates, ought to be first mentioned ;
next to these are others no less necessary, but of much higher rank, for they ought to be men Warders of ' the city.
of great skill and fidelity.
Such would be those magistrates which have the guard of the city, and provide every thing necessary for war;
whose bu­ siness it is, both in war and peace, to defend the walls and gates, and to take care to muster and marshal the citizens.
Over Military officers.
all these there are sometimes more officers, some­ times fewer;
thus, in little cities there is one su­ preme over all, whom they call either general or polemarch ;
but where there are horse and light-armed troops, and bowmen, and sailors, they sometimes place over each of these distinct commanders, called navarchs, hipparchs, and taxiarchs;
who again have others under them, as trierarchs, lochagi, and phylarchs, according to their different divisions;
all of which join together to make one body, appertaining tc the military department.
But since some of the magistrates, if not all, have business with the public money, it is necessary that there should be other officers, whose employment shall be nothing else than to take an account of what they have, and to correct any mismanagement therein ;
and these they call auditors, or logistæ, or inquisitors, or scrutineers.
But, besides all these magistrates, there is one who is supreme over them all, who very often has in his The premier.

who presides over the people, when the supreme power is in them ;
for the magistrate who has a power to summon them together, must be supreme head of the state.

but, where there are many, they are more proper- Probuli.

temples, that they are kept in proper repair, or, it they fall down, that they may be rebuilt;
and whatever else be­ longs to public worship.
This charge is sometimes intrusted to one person, as in small cities;
in others it is delegated to many, and these distinct from the priesthood, as the builders or keepers of holy places, and officers of the sacred revenue.
Next to these are those who are appointed to have the general care of all the public sacrifices, which the law does not intrust to the priests, but which have their high rank as being offered on the common hearth of the city ;

are very attentive to good order, require part­ cular magistrates;
such as those who have the government of the women, who are to see the laws are executed ;
who take the care of the boys, and preside over their education.
To these may be added, those who have the care of the gymnastic exercises, the the­ atres, and every other public spectacle which there may hap pen to be.
Some of these however clearly do not concern the people at large, as the governors of the women ;
for the poor are obliged to employ their wives and children in servile offices, for want of slaves.
But as there are three magistrates to whom some states intrust the supreme power, namely, What officers suit the three forms of go­ vernment.

guardians of the laws suit best to an aristocracy, preadvisers to an oligarchy, and a senate to a de­ mocracy.
And thus much has been said by way of an outline concerning all magistrates.

also be equally uncertain what government is best.
For, un­ less some unexpected accident interfere, it is probable that those who enjoy the best government, will live best according to existing circumstances;
he ought, therefore, first to come to some agreement as to the manner of life which, so to speak, is most desirable for all;
and afterwards, whether this life is the same or different in the individual and the member of a state.
Deeming then that we have already sufficiently shown what sort of life is best, in our popular discourses on that subject, we must now'make use of what we there said.
1 Cer-
Three kinds of goods neces­ sqry for hap­ piness.
tainly no one ever called in question the pro­ priety of one of the divisions;
namely, that as there are three kinds of things good for man, namely, what is external, what belongs to the body, and.
to the soul, it is evident that all these must conspire to make men truly happy.
For no one would say that a man was happy who had nothing of fortitude or temperance, justice or prudence, but was afraid of the flies that flew round him ;
or who would abstain from nothing, if he chanced to be desirous of meat or drink, or who would murder his dearest friend for a farthing ;
or, in like manner, one who was in every particular as wanting and misguided in his understanding as an infant or a maniac.
These truths are so evident that all must agree to them, though some may dispute about the quantity and the degree:
for they may think, that a very little amount of virtue is sufficient for happiness ;
but as to riches, property, power, honour, and all such things, they endeavour to increase them without bounds.
But to such we say, that it is easy to prove, from what experience teaches us concerning these cases, that it is not through these external goods that men acquire virtue, The truly happy life de­ pends on virtue and wisdom.
but through virtue that they acquire them.
2
As to a happy life, whether it is to be found in pleasure or in virtue, or in both, certain it is that it belongs more frequently to those whose morals are most pure, and whose understandings are best cultivated, and who preserve moderation in the acquisition of external goods, than to those who possess a sufficiency of external good things, out are deficient in the rest.
And that such is the case will be clearly seen by any one who views the matter with reflec­ tion.
For whatsoever is external has its boundary, as a machine;
and whatsoever is useful is such that its excess is either necessarily hurtful, or at best useless to the possessor.
But every good quality of the soul, the higher it is in degree, becomes much the more useful, if it is permitted on this sub­ ject to adopt the word " useful" as well as " noble."
It is also evident that the best disposition of each thing will follow in he same proportion of excess, as the things themselves, of which we allow they are accidents, differ from each other in value.
So that if the soul is more noble than any outward possession, or than the body, both in itself and with respect to us, it must be admitted, of course, that the best disposition of each must follow the same analogy.
Besides, it is for the sake of the soul that these things are desirable, and it is on this account that wise men should desire them, and not the soul for them.
Let us therefore be well agreed that so much of.
happiness falls to the lot of every one as he possesses of virtue and wisdom, and in proportion as he acts according to their dictates ;
since for this we have the example of the God Himself, who is completely happy, not from any exter­ nal good, but in Himself, and because He is such by nature.
For good fortune is something of necessity different from hap­ piness, as every external good of the soul is produced by chance or by fortune;
but it is not from fortune that any one is just or wise.
Hence it follows, as established by the same reasoning, that the state which is best, and acts best, will be happy:
for no one can fare
The best and happiest state.
well who acts not well;
nor can the actions either of man or city be praise-worthy without virtue and wisdom.
But valour, justice, and wisdom have in a state the same force and form as in individuals ;
and it is only as he shares in these virtues that each man is said to be just, wise, and prudent.
Thus much then may suffice to be said by way of introduc­ tion ;
for we cannot refrain from touching on this subject in our discourse, though we could not go through all the details I which belong to it;
for that business properly belongs to an­ other inquiry.
But let us at present lay down so much, that a man's happiest life, both as an individual and as a citizen, is a life of virtue, so far accompanied by external goods as to be able to perform virtuous actions.
But if there are any who still dispute the matter, and arc not persuaded by what we have said, we will consider them hereafter, but at present we shall proceed according to our intended method.
The happiness of the indi­ ual and of the state the same.
IT now remains for us to say whether the happi­ ness of any individual and of a city1 is the same or different.
But this also is evident;
for all would confess that it is the same.
For whosoever supposes that riches will make a person happy, must place the happiness of the city in riches, if it possesses them ;
those who prefer a life which enjoys tyrannic power, will also think that the city which has many others under its command is most happy:
thus, also, if any one approves a man for his vir­ tue, he will think the most worthy city the happiest.
But here Two questions.
1. Is political or private life the better ?
there are two particulars which require consider­ ation, one of which is, whether it is the most eligible life to be a member of the community and enjoy the rights of a citizen, or to live as a stranger, without interfering in public affairs ;
and also what form of 2.
What is the best form of government ?
government and what disposition of the state we ought to consider the best;
whether the whole community should be eligible to a share in the administration, or only the greater part, and some only.
As this, therefore, is a subject of political examination and spe­ culation, and not what concerns the individual, and as this is The former deferred.
the view which we have at present chosen, the one of these would be foreign to our purpose,2 but the other is proper to our present design.
Now it is evident that that government must be the best, which is so established that every one therein may have it in his power to act most virtuously and live happily:
but some, who admit that a life of virtue is most eligible, still doubt which is preferable, a public life of active virtue, or one entirely dis­ engaged from what is without, and spent in contemplation;
which some say is the only one worthy of a philosopher.
And one of these two different modes of life, both now and formerly, seem to have been chosen by all those who were the most ambitious of virtue;
I mean the political or the philosophic life.
And yet it is of no little consequence on which side the truth lies ;
for a man of sense must naturally direct his aim to the better mark;
and Different opi­ nions on the latter question.
not only individuals, but the state also, should do the same.
Some think that a tyrannical government over our neighbours is accompanied with the greatest injustice;
but that a politi­ cal rule over them is not unjust:
but that still is a restraint on the tranquillity of political life.
Others chance to hold, as it were, the contradictory opinion, and think that an active and political life is the only life for man;
for that private persons have no opportunity of practising any one virtue, more than they have who are engaged in the public management of the state.
These are their sentiments ;
others say, that a tyran­ nical and despotical mode of government is the only happy one ;
for even among some free states the object of their laws seems to be this, to tyrannise over their neighbours.
So that poli­ tical institutions, wheresoever dispersed among the greater part of mankind, if they have anyone common object in view, all of them -aim at this, to conquer and govern.
As for ex­ ample, at Lacedæmon and in Crete, the education of their children and the generality of .the laws was directed towards a state of war.
Besides, among all nations, those who have power enough to enslave others, are honoured on that account ;
1 as were the Scythians, Persians, Thracians, and Gauls;
and with some there are laws whose end is to excite the virtue of courage;
thus they tell us, that at Carthage they allowed every person to wear as many rings for distinction as he had served campaigns.
There was also a law in Macedon, that a man, who had not himself killed an enemy, should be obliged to wear a halter round his neck.
Among the Scythians, at a fes­ tival.
none were permitted to drink out of the cup which was carried about who had not done the same thing.
Among the Iberians, a warlike nation, they erect as many columns upon a man's tomb as he has slain enemies;
and among different nations different things of this sort prevail, some of them established by law, others by custom.
Probably it may seem absurd to those who are willing to inquire, whether it is the business of a legislator to be able to point out by what means a state may govern and tyrannise over its neighbours, whether they will, or will not.
For how can that which is itself un­ lawful belong either to the politician or legislator ?
but it is unlawful to rule not only justly but unjustly also;
for a con­ quest may be unjustly made.
But we see nothing of this in the other sciences ;
for it is the business neither of the phy­ sician nor of the pilot to use either persuasion or force, the one to his patients, the other to his passengers.
And yet many seem to think that a despotic government is a political one, and what they do not allow to be just or proper, if exercised over themselves, they will not blush to exercise over others ;
for they endeavour to be justly governed themselves, but think it of no consequence whether others are ruled justly or not:
1 and this is absurd except where there are beings which nature in­ tended to rule, and others which as naturally obey.
And there­ fore, since this is the case, no one ought to assume it over all in general, but over those only who are the proper objects of it ;
'2 just as no one should hunt men either for food or sacrifice, but only what is fit for this purpose ;
and these are such wild ani­ mals as are eatable.
But withal, a city which is well governed may be very happy in itself, while it enjoys a good system of internal laws, though its constitution be not framed for war or conquest over its A city with good internal regulations is happy.
enemies ;
for it would then have no occasion for these.
It is evident therefore that all the business of war is to be con­ sidered as commendable, not as a final end, but as the means of procuring it.
It is the duty of a good legis-

how they may partake of a virtuous life, and of the happiness which results from it.
In this respect some laws and customs differ from others.
It is also the duty of a legislator, if he has any neighbouring states, to consider in what manner he shall oppose each of them, or how he shall conduct himself suitably to each.
But as to what should be the final end at which he should direct the best government, may possibly meet with due consideration hereafter.
WE will now speak to those who, while they agree that a life of virtue is most eligible, yet differ in the use of it, addressing ourselves to both these parties ;
for there are some who disapprove of all political governments, and think that the life of one who is really free is different from the life of a citizen, Different opinions as to complete freedom.
and of all others most eligible:
while others, again, think that the life of a citizen is the best;
and that it is impossible for him who does nothing to be well employed;
but that virtuous activity and happiness are the same thing.
Now both parties in some particulars say what is right, in others what is wrong ;
thus, it is true that the life of a freeman is better than the life of a slave, for a slave, as a slave, is employed in nothing noble;
for the common servile employments which he is corn­ manded to perform have nothing honourable in them.
But, on the other hand, it is not true that a submission to every sort of government is slavery;
for the government of freemen differs not less from theNot all sub­ mission is slavery.
government of slaves, than slavery and freedom differ from each other in their nature;
and how they differ has been already mentioned in our first book.
1
To prefer idleness to activity is also wrong, for happiness consists in action,2 and many noble ends are produced by the actions of the just and wise.
From what we have already determined on this subject, some one probably may think, that supreme power is of all things best, for thus is a man enabled to perform very many useful services.
So that he who can obtain this power ought not to give it up to another, but rather to seize it:
and, for this purpose, the father should have no attention or regard for his son, or the son for his father, or friend for friend;
for what is best is most eligible:
but to be in prosperity is the best.
What these persons advance might probably be true, if the supreme good were certainly theirs who plunder and use violence to others.
But it is most unlikely that it should be so ;
for it is a mere false supposition:
for it does not follow, that their actions are honourable who thus assume the supreme power over others, unless they are by nature as superior to them as a man to a woman, a father to a child, a master to a slave.
So that he who so far forsakes the path of virtue can never return back so far as he has departed from it.
For amongst equals whatever is fair and just ought to be recipro­ cal;
for this is equal and right;
but that equals should not share with equals, or like with like, is contrary to nature ;
and
Who is by nature fitted to rule.
whatever is contrary to nature is not right.
It ;
therefore, there is any one superior to the rest of the community in virtue and abilities for active life, him it is proper to follow, and him it is right to obey:
but he must have not virtue alone, but also the power according to which he may be capable of acting.
If, then, we are right in what we have now said, it -follows, that happiness consists in virtuous activity, and that with respect to the state, as well as to the individual, an active life is the best.
Not that an active life must necessarily refer to other persons,3 as some think, or that those studies alone are practical which are pursued for the sake of what results from acting.
But this is much more true of those self-dependent contemplations and discursive energies which subsist for their own sakes.
For virtuous activity is their end, so that it is something practical;
nay, those who contrive the plan which others follow are more particularly

said to act, and are superior to the workmen who execute their designs.
But it 'is not necessary that states which choose to have no intercourse with others should remain in­ active ;
for the several members thereof may have mutual in­ tercourse with each other ;
and there are many opportunities for this among the different citizens.
The same thing is true in like manner of every individual;
for, were it otherwise, neither could the God nor the universe be perfect;
but neither of these can have any external actions, over and above their own proper energies.
Hence it is evident that that very same life which is happy for each individual, is happy also for the state and for every member of it.
As what has already been said finishes the pre­ face of this subject, and as we have considered at large the nature of all other states, 1 it now remains Constitution of the ideal state.
that I should first say what ought to be the form laid down as that of the state which is in accordance with our idea ;
for no good state can exist without a proportionate supply of what is necessary.
Many things therefore ought to be pre­ viously laid down as objects desirable, but none of them such as are impossible ;
I mean, relative to the number of citizens, and the extent of the territory.
For as other artificers, such as the weaver and the shipwright, ought to have such ma­ terials as are fit for their work, (since in proportion as they are better, by so much superior will the work itself necessarily be;
) so also ought the legislator and politician to endea­ vour to procure proper materials for the business they have The number of the people, in hand.
Now the first and principal instrument of the politician is the number of the people;
he should therefore know how many and what they naturally ought to be;
in like manner as to the country, how large and of what kind.
it ought to be.
Most persons think, that it is necessary for a city to be large in order to be happy ;
1 but even should this be true, still they cannot tell what is a large one, and what a small one.
For they estimate its great­ ness according to the multitude of its inhabitants ;
but they ought rather to look to its strength than to its numbers.
For a state has a certain object in view, so that the state which is most able in itself to accomplish this end, this we ought to consider the greatest;
as a person might say that Hippocrates was a greater physician, though not a greater man, than one that is, of the citizens.
who was taller than him in person.
But even if it were proper to determine the strength of the city from the number of its inhabitants, it should never be interred from the multitude in general who may happen to be in it — (for in a city there must necessarily be many slaves, sojourners, and foreigners)—but from those who are really part of the state, and properly constitute the mem­ bers of it.
A multitude of these is indeed a proof that the city is large, but where a large number of mechanics dwell, and but few soldiers, such a state cannot be great;
for a great city and a populous one are not the same thing.
This too is evident from the fact that it is very difficult, if not impos­ sible, properly to govern a very numerous body of men ;
for of all the states which appear well governed, we find not one where the rights of a citizen are laid open to the entire mul­ titude.
1
And this is also made evident by proof from the nature of the thing ;
for as law is a certain order, so good law is of course a certain good order;
but too large a multitude is incapable of this.
For
It should not be too large nor too small ;
this is in very truth the prerogative of that Divine Power which comprehends the universe.
Not but that, as quantity and greatness are usually essential to beauty, the perfection of a city consists in its being large, if only consistent with that order already mentioned.
But still there is a determinate size to all cities, as well ,as every thing else, whether animals, plants, or machines;
for each of these have their proper powers, if they are neither too little nor too large;
but when they have not their due growth, or are badly constructed,— (as a ship a span long is not properly a ship, nor one of two fur­ longs length, but only when it is of a fit size;
for either from its smallness or from its largeness, it will make all sail­ ing hopeless ;
)— so is it with a city.
One that is too small has not in itself the power of self-defence, but this power is es­ sential to a city :
one that is too large is capable of self-defence in what is necessary, in the same way as a nation, but then it is not a city ;
for it will be very difficult to find a form of go­ vernment for it.
For who would choose to be the general of such an unwieldy multitude, or who could be their herald but a tenor :
T he first thing therefore necessary is, that a city should consist of the lowest numbers which will be sufficient to enable the inhabitants to live happily in their political community.
And but such as will enable the inhabitants to live happily, it follows, that the more the inhabitants exceed that necessary number, the greater will the city be.
But, as we have already said, this must not be without bounds;
but what is the pro­ per limit of the excess,2 experience will easily show, and this experience is to be collected from the actions both -of the go­ vernors and the governed.
Now, as it belongs to the first to direct the inferior magistrates and to act as judges, it fol­ lows that they can neither determine causes with justice, nor issue their orders with propriety, without they know the cha­ racters of their fellow-citizens :
so that whenever this happens to be impossible in these two particulars, the state must of necessity be badly managed;
for in both of them it is unjust to determine too hastily, and without proper knowledge, which must evidently be the case where the number of the citizens is too many.
Besides, it is more easy for strangers and so­ journers to assume the rights of citizens, as they will easily escape detection owing to the greatness of the multitude.
It and independ­ ently.
is evident then, that the best boundary for a city is that wherein the numbers are the greatest pos­ sible, that they may be the better able to be suffi­ dent in themselves, while they are not too large to be under the eye of the magistrates.
And thus let us determine the extent of a city.
The best state would be one self-dependent for provisions;
THE above may readily be applied to a country;
for as to what soil it should have, it is clear that every one will praise it in proportion as it is suf­ ficient in itself.
For which purpose such a country must of necessity supply its inhabitants with all the necessaries of life ;
for it is the having these in plenty, without any want, and of adequate extent, which makes them content.
As to its extent, it should be such as may enable the inhabitants to live at their ease with freedom and temperance.
Whether we have done right or wrong in fixing this limit to the territory, shall be considered more minutely hereafter, 1 when we come particularly to inquire into property, and as to the amount of fortune requisite, and how and in what manner a man ought to employ it.
For many doubts are started as to this question, while men strive to bring it on either side to an excess, the one of severity, the other of indulgence.
What the situation of the country should be, is not difficult to de­ termine ;
but in some particulars respecting this point, we ought to be advised by those who are skilful in military af­ fairs.
It should be difficult of access to an ene­ my, but easy of egress to the inhabitants;
and, Its situation.
as we said that the number of inhabitants ought to be such as can come under the eye of the magistrate, so should it be with the country;
for by that means the country is easily defended.
As to the position of the city, if one could place it to one's wish, it ought to lie well both for sea and land.
One situation which it ought to have has been already men­ tioned ;
for it should be so placed as easily to give assistance to all parts, and also to receive the necessaries of life from every quarter;
as also it should be accessible for the carriage of wood, or any other materials of the like kind which may happen to be in the country.
BUT with respect to placing a city in communica­ tion with the sea, there are some who have many doubts whether it is serviceable or hurtful to well-

regulated states ;
1 for they say, that it becomes the resort of persons brought up under a different system of government, and so-is far from serviceable to the state, towards the pre­ servation of law and the increase of population ;
for a multi­ tude of merchants must necessarily arise from trading back­ wards and forwards upon the seas, which will hinder the city from being well governed.
But if this incon­ venience does not arise, it is evident that it is better Its advantages.
both for safety, and also for the acquisition of the necessaries of life, that both the city and the country should be near the sea.
For in order to bear up against wars, it is necessary to be able to bring up forces both by land and by sea;
and in order to damage the invaders, if it is not possible to do so both ways, still either course is available if they possess both.
It is also necessary for them to import from abroad what does not grow in their own country, and to export the superfluous productions;
for a city ought to traffic to supply its own wants, and not the wants of others:
for those who themselves furnish an open market for every one, do it for the sake of gain ;
but as to the city which ought not to take part in this ambitious trading, it ought not to encourage the growth of such a mart.
Now, as we see that many places and cities have docks and harbours lying very convenient for the city, while those who frequent them have no communication with the citadel, and yet they are not too far off, but are surrounded by walls and other such-like fortifications, it is evident, that, if any good arises from such an intercourse, the city will perceive it, but if any thing hurtful, it will be easy to restrain it by a law;
declaring and deputing who ought to have a trading inter-

course with each other, and who ought not.
As to a naval power, it is by no means doubtful that it is necessary to have one to a certain degree;
and this not only for the sake of the city itself, but also be­ cause it may be necessary to appear formidable to some of the neighbouring states, or to be able to assist them as well by sea as by land.
But in order to know how great that power should be, we must look into the condition of the state, and if it shall show such vigour as to enaole her to take the lead of other communities, it is necessary that her force should cor­ respond with her actions.
As for that multitude of people which arises around a maritime power, they are by no means necessary to a state, nor ought they to make a part of the citizens.
1
For the mariners and infantry who have the chief command at sea, are freemen, and upon these depends a naval engagement.
But when there are many of the surrounding inhabitants and husbandmen, there they will always have, a number of sailors:
as we now see happens to some states ;
at Heraclea, for instance, where they man many triremes, though the extent of their city is much more easily measured than some others.
And thus let it suffice that we have determined concerning the country, the port, the city, the sea, and a maritime power:
as to the number of the citizens, we have already said what the limit ought to be.
WE now proceed to point out of what natural dis­ position the citizens ought to be:
but this surely any one would easily perceive who casts his eye
The disposition of citizens.
over those states of Greece which bear a high repute, and in­ deed over all the habitable world, as it is divided among the nations.
Those who live in cold countries, 1 as the north of Europe, are full of courage, but wanting in understanding and in art;
therefore they remain free for a long time;
but, not being versed in the political science, they cannot reduce their neighbours under their power.
But the Asiatics, whose un­ derstandings are quick, and who are conversant in the arts, are deficient in courage ;
and therefore they continue to be always conquered, and the slaves of others.
But the Greeks, placed as it were between these two parts, partake of the nature of both, so as to be at the same time both courageous and intellectual;
for Advantages of the Grecian states in this respect.
which reason Greece continues free, and governed in the best manner possible, and capable of commanding the whole world, could it be combined into one system of policy.'
The races of the Greeks have the very same difference among them­ s'elves :
for part of them possess but one of these qualities, whereas in the other they are both happily blended together.
Hence it is evident, that those persons ought to be both intel­ ligent and courageous who will be readily obedient to a legis­ lator, whose object is virtue.
—As to what some
The military.
persons say, that the military must be friendly towards those whom they know, but severe towards those whom they know not, it is courage which makes any one lovely;
for that is the faculty of the soul on account of which we most admire.
As a proof of this, our resentment rises higher against our friends and acquaintance than against those whom we know not:
for which reason Archilochus, properly accus­ in,, his friends, addresses the irascible part of his soul, and says, " Art thou not strangled by these friends ? "
The spirit of freedom and command also is inherited by all who are of this disposition;
for courage is commanding and invincible.
It also is not right for any one to say, that you should be severe to those you know not;
for this behaviour is proper for no one :
nor are those who are of a noble disposition harsh in their manners, excepting only towards injurers ;
and when they are particularly so, it is, as has been already said, against their friends, when they think they have injured them.
And this is agreeable to reason :
for when those who think they ought to receive a favour from any one do not receive it, beside the injury done them, they consider what they are deprived of.
Hence the saying, " Cruel the wars of brethren are;
" and this, " Those who have greatly loved do greatly hate.
"And thus we have nearly determined how many the members of a state ought to be, and what their natural disposition;
as also how large, and of what sort, their country should be;
and I say " nearly," because we ought not to require the same accuracy in matters of reasoning as in those which are the objects of the senses.
As in other naturally constituted bodies, those things are not admitted to be parts of them with­ out which the whole would not exist;
so also it is evident, that in a political state every thing thatMany things necessary to a state, but are not parts of it.

nor of any other community, from whence one genus is made.
For one thing ought to be common and the same to the com­ munity, whether they partake of it equally or unequally, as, for instance, food, land, or the like;
but when one thing is for the benefit of one person, and another for the benefit of an­ other, in this there is nothing like a community, excepting that one makes it and the other uses it.
As, for instance, between any instrument employed in making any work, and the workmen, as there is nothing common between the house and the builder, but the art of the builder is employed on the house.
Thus property is necessary for states, but property is no part of the state, though many species of it have life ;

of equals, for the purpose of enjoying the best life possible.
But happiness is the best:
and this consists in the perfect practice of virtuous energies.
As, therefore, some persons have great, others little or no share in this, it is evident, that this is the cause of the difference which exists between the different cities and communities there are to be found;
for while each of these seeks after what is best by various and different means, they give rise to different modes of living and different forms of government.
We are now to consider what those things are without which a city cannot possibly exist for what we call parts of the city must of necessity be inhe-

fourthly, a certain revenue, as well for the internal necessities of the state, as for the business of war:
fifthly, and indeed chief of all, the care of the service of the gods:
sixthly in order, but most necessary of all, a court to determine both civil and criminal causes.
These things are matters which are absolutely required, so to speak, in every state;
for a city is a number of people, not accidentally met together, but with a purpose of insuring to themselves sufficient independency and self-protection ;
and if any thing necessary for these purposes is wanting, it is impossible that in such a situation these ends can be obtained.
It is necessary therefore that a city should be composed with reference to these various trades ;
for this purpose a proper number of husbandmen are necessary to procure food;
as also artificers and soldiers, and rich men, and priests, and judges,1 to determine what is necessary and be­ neficial.
Ought all to share these employments, or not ?
HAVING determined thus far, it remains that we consider whether all ought to share these different employments;
(for it is possible for the same' persons always to be husbandmen, artificers, judges, or counsellors ;
) or whether different persons ought to be appointed to each of those employments which we have already mentioned ;
or whether some of them should be appro­ priated to particular persons, and others common to all.
But this does not take place in every state ;
for, as we have already said, it is possible that all may be shared by all, or not by all, but only by some;
and this makes one government to differ from another :
for in democracies the whole community par­ takes of every thing, but in oligarchies it is different.
Since we are inquiring what is the best go­ vernment possible, and as it is admitted to be that in which the citizens are happy, and that, as we Aave already said, it is impossible to obtain hap- Trades and arts to be for­ bidden to the noble.
piness without virtue;
it follows, that in the best governed states, where the citizens are really men of intrinsic and not relative goodness, none of them should be permitted to exer­ cise any low mechanical employment or traffic,1 as being ignoble and destructive to virtue:
neither should they who are destined for office be husbandmen ;
for leisure is necessary in order to improve in virtue, and to perform the duty which they owe to the state.
But since the soldiery, and the senate which consults, and the judge who de­ cides on matters of law, are evidently necessary to the community, shall they be allotted'to different Different qua­ lifications for a soldier, sena­ tor, and judge.
persons, or shall they both be given to the same person ?
This too is clear:
for in some cases the same persons may execute them, in others they should be different;
for where the dif­ ferent employments require different abilities, as when prac­ tical wisdom is wanting for one, but energy for the other, there they should be allotted to different persons.
But where it is evidently impossible that those who are able to do violence and to impede matters, should always be under command, there these different employments should be trusted to one person;
for those who have arms in their hands have it in their option whether the supreme power shall remain or no.
It remains, then, that we should intrust the go­ vernment to these two parties;
but not at the same time, but as nature directs;
what requires When and how they may be combined.
energy, to the young ;
what requires practical wisdom, to the old.
Thus each will be allotted the part for which they are fit according to their different merits.
It is also necessary that the landed property should belong to these men;
for it is necessary that the citizens should be rich, and these are the men proper for citizens;
for no low mechanic ought to be admitted to the rights of a citizen, nor any other sort of people, whose employment is not productive of virtue.
This is evident from our first principle ;
for to be happy it is neces­ sary to be virtuous;
and no one should say that a city is happy so long as he considers only one part of its citizens, but he must look to the whole body.
It is evident, therefore, that the landed property should belong to these, though it may be necessary for them to have for husbandmen, either slaves, bar-

barians, or servants.
There remains of the classes of the people already enumerated, one only, that of the priests ;
for these evidently compose a rank by themselves ;
for the priests are by no means to be reckoned amongst the husbandmen or the mechanics;
for it is fitting that the gods should be reverenced by the citizens.
And since the citizens have been divided into two orders, namely, the military and the council, and since it is proper to offer due worship to the gods, and since it is necessary that those who are employed in their service should have nothing else to do, let those who are ripe in years be set aside for the business of the priesthood.
We have now shown what is necessary to the existence of a city, and of what parts it consists ;
and that husbandmen, mechanics, and the class of mercenary servants are necessary to a city;
but that the parts of it are the sol­ diery and the councillors.
Each of these also is separated from the other;
the one indeed always, but the other only in part.
IT seems neither now nor very lately to have become known to those philosophers who have made politics their study, that a city ought to be divided by families into different orders of men;
and that the husbandmen and soldiers should be kept separate from each other;
a custom which is even to this day preserved in Egypt and in Crete also;
Sesostris having founded it in Egypt, Minos in Crete.
The common meals seem also to have been an ancient regulation, and to have been established in Crete during the reign of Minos, and in a;
still more remote period in Italy.
For it is said by those who are the best versed in the annals of the people who dwell there, that one Italus was sting of Ænotria,1 and that from him the people changed their names, and were called Italians instead of Ænotrians, and that part of Europe was called Italy, which is bounded by the Scylletic gulf on the one side, and the Lametic2 on the other, the distance between which is about half a day's journey.
Now this Italus, as they relate, made husbandmen of the Ænotrians, who were formerly shepherds, and gave them other laws, and especially was the first who established the common meals;
for which reason some of his descendants still use them, and observe some of his laws.
The Opici inhabit that part which lies towards the Tyrrhenian Sea, who both now are and formerly were called Ausonians.
The Chaonians inhabited the part toward Iapy­ gia and the Ionian Sea, which is called the Syrtis.
These Chaonians were descended from the JEnotrians.
Hence arose the custom of common meals, but the separation of the citizens into different families came from Egypt :
for the reign of Sesostris is of much higher antiquity than that of Minos.
As we ought to think that most other things were often found out in a long time, nay, times without number—(for reason teaches us that want would make men first invent that which was necessary, and, when that was obtained, then those things which were requisite for the conveniencies and ornament of life )-so should we conclude the same with respect to a political state.
But every thing in Egypt is a proof of the great antiquity of these customs ;
for the people of Egypt seem to be the most ancient of all others, and yet they have ac­ quired laws and political order.
We should therefore make a proper use of what is told us concerning states, and en­ deavour to find out what others have omitted.
3
We have The husband­ men a separate order.
already said, that the landed property ought to belong to the military and those who partake of the government of the state;
and that therefore the husbandmen should be a separate order of people ;
and how large, and of what nature, the country ought to be.
We will therefore first treat of the division of the land, and of the husbandmen, how many, and of what sort they ought to be;
since we by no means hold that property ought to be common, as some persons have said,1 but only by way of friend­ ship it should be made common, so as to let no citizen want subsistence.
As to common meals, it is in general agreed that they are proper in well-regulated cities ;
but on account of what reasons we also approve of them shall be mentioned hereafter.
They are things of which all the citizens ought to partake;
but it will not be easy for the poor, out of what is.
their own, to contribute as much as is enjoined, and to supply their own house besides.
The expense also of religious

worship should be defrayed by the whole state.
Of necessity therefore the land ought to be divided into two parts, one of which should belong to the community in general, the other to the individuals separately.
Each of these parts should again be subdi- ' vided into two:
and half of that which belongs to the public should be appropriated to maintain the worship of the gods, The situation of that which is in private hands.
the other half to support the common meals.
Half of that which belongs to the individuals should be at the extremity of the country, the other half near the city;
so that these two portions being allotted to each person, all would partake of land in both places, which would be both equal and right;
and induce them to act more in concert in any war with their neighbours.
For when the land is not divided in this manner, one party neglects the inroads of the enemy on the borders, the other makes it a matter of too much consequence, and more than is fair.
For which reason, in some places there is a law, which forbids the inhabitants of the borders to have any vote in the council when they are debating upon a war made against them, as their private interest might prevent their voting impartially.
Thus, therefore, the country ought to be divided, and for the reasons before mentioned.
But those who are to act as "husbandmen, if choice be allowed, should by all means be slaves, nor all of the same nation, nor men of any spirit:
for thus The tillers of the ground should be kept as serfs.
they will probably be industrious in their business, and safe from attempting any novelties.
Next to these, barbarian servants are to be preferred, similar in natural disposition to those we have already mentioned.
Of these, some who are to cultivate the private property of the individual, should belong to that individual, and those who are to cultivate the public ter­ ritory should belong to the public.
In what manner these slaves ought to be used, and for what reason it is very proper that they should have liberty held out to them as a reward for their services, we will mention hereafter.
WE have already mentioned, that the city should communi­ cate both with the continent and the sea;
and with the adjoin­ ing territory equally, as much as possible.
There are these four things of which we should be par­ ticularly desirous in the position of the city with respect to itself.
In the first place, as to health, as the first thing necessary.
Now a city which
The situation of the city should be chosen with regard to, 1. Health.
fronts the east and receives the winds which blow from thence is esteemed most healthful;
next to this a northern position is to be preferred, as best in winter.
It should next be con­ trived, that it may have a proper situation for the business of government, and for defence in war;
that in war the citizens may have easy access to it, but that it may be difficult of access to the enemy, and hardly to be taken.
In the next place, that there may be a suitable supply of water and rivers near at hand;
but if those cannot" be found, very large and immense cisterns must be prepared to save rain water, so that there may be no want of it when cut off from the country in time of war.
And as great care should be taken of the health of the inhabitants, the first thing to be attended to is that the city should have a good situation and a good position ;
the second is, that they may have good water to drink, and this must not be taken care of as a secondary matter.
For what we chiefly and most frequently use for the support of the body, must principally contribute to its health;
and this is the influence which the air and water naturally have.
For this reason, in all wise governments, the water ought to be appropriated to different purposes if they are not equally good ;
and, if there is not a plenty of both kinds of water, that which is to drink should be separated from that which is for other uses.
As to 2. Strength of position.
fortified places, what is suitable to some govern­ ments is not equally suited to all:
as, for instance, a lofty citadel is proper for a monarchy and an oligarchy, but a city built upon a plain suits a democracy;
neither of these for an aristocracy, but rather many strong places.
As to the form of private houses, those are thought to be best, and most useful for their different purposes, which are separate from each other, and built in the modern manner, after the plan of Hippodamus.
But for safety in time of war, on the contrary, they should be built as they formerly were;
for they were such that strangers could not easily find their way out of them, and the method of access to them such as an enemy who assailed them could with difficulty find.
A city, therefore, should have both these sorts of buildings ;
and this may easily be contrived, if any one will so regulate them as the planters do their rows of vines ;
not making the buildings throughout the city detached, but only in some parts of it;
for thus elegance and safety will be equally consulted.
With Fortification necessary.
respect to walls, those who say that a courageous people ought not to have any, form their ideas from antiquated notions ;
particularly, as we may see those cities which pride themselves herein confuted by facts.
It is indeed disreputable for those who are equal, or nearly equal, to the enemy, to endeavour to save themselves by taking refuge within their walls;
but since it is possible, and very often happens, that those who make the attack are too powerful for the courage of those few who oppose them to resist, if they would be saved, and not encounter much suffer­ ing and insolence, it must be thought the part of a good soldier to make the fortification of the walls such as to give the best protection, more especially since so many missile weapons and machines have been ingeniously invented to besiege cities.
In- deed to neglect surrounding a city with a wall would be similar to choosing a country which is easy of access to an enemy, or levelling the eminences of it;
or as though an individual should not have a wall to his house, as if those who dwelt in it were likely to be cowards.
Nor should this be left out of our ac­ count, that those who have a city surrounded with walls, may act both ways, either as if it had, or as if it had not;
but where it has not, they cannot do this.
If this be true, not only is it necessary to have walls, but care must be taken that they may be a proper ornament to the city, as well as a de­ fence in time of war, not only according to the old methods, but also according to modern improvements.
For as those who make offensive war seek by what means they can gain advantages over their adversaries, so for those who are upon the defensive, some means have been already found out, and others they ought scientifically to devise, in order to defend themselves ;
for people seldom attempt to attack those who are well prepared.
AXD as it is necessary that the citizens in general 'should eat at public tables, and as it is necessary that the walls should have bulwarks and towers Syssities on the ramparts.
at proper distances, it is evident that the- nature of the case demands that they prepare some of the public tables in the towers.
And these indeed any one could arrange for this purpose ornamentally.
But the temples tor public worship, and the hall for the public tables of the Temples.
chief magistrates, ought to be built in proper places, and con­ tiguous, except those temples which the law or the oracle from the god orders to be separate from all other buildings.
And the site of these should be so conspicuous, that they may have an eminence which will give them the advantage of distinc­ tion, and this, too, near that part of the city which is best for­ tined.
Adjoining to this place there ought to be a large square, like that which they call in Thessaly the square of freedom, in which nothing An open square for the nobles.
is permitted to be bought or sold ;
into which no low mechanic or husbandman, or any such person, should be permitted to enter, unless commanded by the magistrates.
It will also be an ornament to this place, if the gym- Gymnastic ex­ ercises.
nastic exercises of the elders are performed in it.
For it is proper that for the performance of these exercises the citizens should be divided into distinct classes, according to their ages, and that the young persons should have proper officers to be with them, and that the seniors should be with the magistrates ;
for the presence of the magistrates before their eyes would Another square for trade.
greatly inspire true modesty and ingenuous fear.
There ought to be another square separate from this, for buying and selling, which should be so situated as to be commodious tor the reception of goods both by sea and by land.
As the citizens may be divided into ma­ gistrates and priests, it is proper that the public tables of the priests should be in buildings near the temples.
Those of the magistrates who preside over contracts, indictments;
and such like, and also over the markets and the public streets, should be near the square, or some public way, I mean the square where things are bought and sold;
for we intend the other for those who are at leisure, and this for necessary business.
The surround­ ing country.
The same order which I have directed here, should be observed also in the.
country ;
for there also their magistrates, such as the surveyors of the woods, and overseers of the grounds, must necessarily have their common tables and their towers, for the purpose of pro­ tection against an enemy.
There ought also to be temples erected at proper places, both to the gods and the heroes.
But it is unnecessary to dwell longer and most minutely on these particulars;
for it is by no means difficult to plan these things, but it is rather so to carry them into execution;
for the theory is the child of our wishes, but the practical part must depend upon fortune;
for which reason let us dismiss the matter without saying any thing further upon such sub­ jects.
The popula­ tion.
BUT concerning the state itself, we must say of what numbers and of what sort of people it ought to consist, that the state may be happy and well administered.
As there are two particulars on which the perfection of every thing depends, one of these is, that the object and end of the actions proposed should be proper;
the other, to find the courses of conduct which lead to that end.
For it may happen that these may either agree or dis­ agree with each other;
for sometimes the end which men propose is good, but in taking the means to obtain it they may err ;
at other times they may have all the proper means in their power, but they have proposed to themselves a bad end ;
and sometimes they may mistake in both:
as in the art of medicine, physicians sometimes do not know in what con­ dition the body ought to be, in order to be healthy;
and sometimes they do not hit well upon the means which are productive of their intended aim.
In every art and science, therefore, we should be master of this knowledge, namely, as to the proper end, and as to the means of obtaining it.
Now it is evident that all persons are desirous to live well, and be happy;
but that some have the means of so doing in their own power, others not;
and this either through nature or fortune.
For much external assistance is necessary to a happy life;
but less to those who are of a good, than to those who are of a bad, disposition.
There are others who, though they have the means of happiness in their own power, do not rightly seek for it.
But since our proposed object is to inquire what government is best, namely, that by which a state may be best administered, and that state would seem best administered where the people are the happiest, it is evident that the nature of happiness is a thing which ought not to escape us.
Now, we have already
What happi­ ness is.
said ,in our treatise on Ethics,1 (if there be any use in what we there said,) that happiness consists in the energy and per­ feet practice of virtue,2 and this not relatively, but simply.
I mean by relatively, what is necessary in some certain circum­ stances ;
by simply, what is good in itself.
Of the first sort are just punishments and restraints in a just cause;
for they arise from virtue, and are necessary, and on that account are virtuous:
(though it is more desirable, that neither any state or any individual should stand in need of such things:
) but those actions which are directed to procure either honours or wealth are simply best.
For the one are eligible as tending to remove an evil:
these actions, on the contrary, are the foundation and means of producing relative good.
A worthy How far virtue is necessary, and how far external goods.
man indeed will bear poverty, disease, and other unfortunate accidents, with a noble mind, but happiness consists in the contrary to these.
Now we have already determined in our treatise on Ethics,' that he is a man of worth who considers what is good because it is virtuous, as what is simply good:
it is evi­ dent, therefore, that the using these things in such a manner must be worthy and simply good.
This has led some persons to conclude that the cause of happiness was external goods;
which would be as if any one should attribute to the lyre itself a brilliant and noble performance, and not to the art itself.
It necessarily follows from what has been said, that some things should be ready at hand and others procured by the legislator:
for which reason, we earnestly wish that the constitution of the state may have those things which are under the dominion of fortune-( for over some things we admit her to be supreme) ;
-but for a state to be worthy and great is not the work of fortune only, but of knowledge and deliberate choice as well.
But for a state to be worthy, it is necessary that those citizens who are in the administration should be worthy also:
but in our city every citizen has a share in the state.
And so we must consider how a man may become worthy.
For if the whole body could become worthy, and not some individuals only, it would be more desirable ;
for then it would follow, that what might be done by one, might Influence of nature, habit, and reason on mankind.
be done by all.
2
Men are worthy and good in three ways ;
and these are, by nature, by custom, by reason.
In the first place, each one ought to be born a man, and not any other animal;
that is to say, he ought to be of a particular disposition both in body and soul.
But as to some things, it avails not to be born with them, for custom makes great alterations :
for there are some things in nature capable of alteration either way, and which are fixed by custom, either for the better or the worse.
Now, other animals live chiefly a life of mere nature, and in very few things according to custom ;
but man lives according to reason also, with which he alone is endowed;
wherefore he ought to make all these accord with each other:
for if they are persuaded that it is best to follow some other way, men oftentimes act contrary to nature and custom.
What men ought naturally to be, in order to make good subjects in a legislative community, we have already determined ;
the rest of this discourse, therefore, shall be upon educa­ tion :
for some things men learn by habit, others by hearing them.
Hence the need of education.
As every political community consists of those who govern and those who are governed, weEducation.
must next consider whether.
both the rulers and the ruled ought to be the same persons for life, or dif­ ferent ;
for it is evident that the mode of educa­ tion should follow in accordance with this distinc­ tion.
Now, if one man differed from another as much as we believe the gods and heroes differ A previous question :
ought the rulers and the ruled always to continue so ?
from men, in the first place being far their superiors in the body, and secondly in the soul, so that the superiority of the governors over the governed might be evident beyond a doubt, it is certain, that it would be better for the one always to govern, the other always to be governed,1 But, as this is not easy to obtain, and as kings are not so superior to those they govern as Scylax informs us they are in India, it is evi­ dent, that for many reasons it is necessary that all in their turns should share both in governing and in being governed;
for it is just that those who are equal should have every thing alike;
and it is difficult for a state to continue which is founded in injustice.
For all those in the country who are desirous of innovation, will apply themselves to such persons as are under the government of the rest;
but it is impossible that the number of individuals in a state will be so great as to get the better of all these.
But that the governors ought to excel the governed is beyond a doubt;
the legislator there­ fore ought to consider, how this shall be, and how it may be contrived that all shall have their equal share in the adminis-
To some ex­ tent, but not wholly.
tration.
Now with respect to this point we have already spoken.
For nature herself has directed us in our choice, laying down the self-same dis­ tinction, when she has made some young, others old;
the first of whom it becomes to obey, the latter to command.
For no one when he is young is offended at his being under govern­ ment, or thinks himself too good for it;
more especially when he considers that he himself shall receive the same tribute, when he shall arrive at a proper age.
In some respects it must be acknowledged that the governors and the governed are Consequently the education of the two classes will be partlythe same and partly not.
the same, in others they are different;
it is there­ fore necessary that their education should be in some respect the same, in others different:
just as they say that he who will be a good governor, ought first to learn to obey.
Now, of govern­ ments, as we have already said, some are instituted for the sake of him who commands, others for him who obeys:
of the first sort is that of the master over the servant;
of the latter, that of freemen over each other.
Now, some things which are commanded differ from others, not in the business, but in the end proposed thereby:
for which reason many works, even of a servile nature, are not disgraceful for young freemen to perform;
for many things which are ordered to be done are not honourable or dishonourable so much in their own nature as in the end proposed, and in the reason for which they are undertaken.
Since, then, we have determined that the virtue of a good citizen and good governor is the same as of a good man, and that every one before he com­ mands should have first obeyed, it is the business of the legis- later to consider how his citizens may be good men, what education is necessary to that purpose, and what is the ultimate object of the best-spent life.'
Now the soul of man may be divided into Education the province of the legislator, and why.
two parts ;
2 that which has reason itself, and that which has not, but is capable of obeying its dictates :
and according to the virtues of these two parts a man is said to be good.
But in which of these the end subsists, will not be difficult for those to determine who adopt the division which we have already given ;
for the inferior always exists for the sake of the superior ;
and this is equally evident both in the works of art, as well as in those of nature;
but that is superior which has reason.
Reason itself also is divided into two parts, in the manner we usually divide it, namely, the theoretic and the practical;
which division therefore seems necessary for this part also.
The same analogy holds good with respect to actions;
of which those which are of a superior nature ought always to be chosen by those who have it in their power;
for that is always most eligible to every one, which is the highest attainable end.
Now life is divided into labour and rest, war and peace ;
and of what we do, the objects are partly necessary and useful, partly noble:
and we should give the same preference to these, that we do to the different parts of the soul, and its actions;
as war to procure peace ;
labour for the sake of rest;
and the useful for the noble.
The politician, there­ fore, who composes a body of laws, ought to ex­ tend his legislation to every thing, the different parts of the soul, and their actions;

They ought to be fitted both for Education should tend to what is noble as well as what is useful.
labour and war, but rather for rest and peace;
and also to do what is necessary and useful, but still more what is noble.
It is to those objects that the education of the children ought to tend, and that of all those ages which require education.
But those of the Grecian states which now seem best governed, and the legislators who founded those states, appear not to have framed their polity with a view to the best end, nor to every virtue, in their laws and education ;
but meanly to have attended to those which are useful and productive of gain.
And nearly of the same opinion with these are some persons Wrong end of the Spartan constitution.
who have written lately;
for, by praising the Lacedemonian state, they show that they approve of the intention of the legislator in making war and victory the end of his government.
But that this is con­ trary to reason, is easily proved by argument, and has already been proved by facts.
But as the generality of men desire to have command over the many, because thus they have every thing desirable in the greater abundance;
so Thibron and each of those others who have written on the state of Lace­ daemon seem to approve of their legislator, for having pro­ cured them an extensive command, by inuring them to all sorts of dangers.
And yet it is evident, since the Lacedæ­ monians no longer have the supreme power, that neither are they happy, nor was their legislator wise.
This also is ridi­ culous, that while they preserved an obedience to his laws, and no one opposed their being governed by them, they have thrown away the means of living honourably.
But these people understand not rightly what sort of government it is which the legislator ought to hold in esteem;
for a govern­ ment of freemen is nobler than despotic power, and more consonant to virtue.
Moreover, neither should a city be thought happy, nor should a legislator be commended on this account, because he has trained the people so as to overpower their neighbours.
For in this there is a great inconvenience :
since it is evident, that upon this principle every citizen who can, must endeavour to procure the supreme power in his own city;
and this is the crime of which the Lacedæmonians accuse Pausanias, though he enjoyed such great honours.
But no part of such reasoning and such laws is either political, or useful, or true:
but a legislator ought to instil into the minds of men those laws which are most useful for them, both in their public and private capacities.
As to training a people for war, this ought to be the care of a legislator, not in order that they may True end of all warlike train­ ing.
enslave their inferiors, but that they may not themselves be reduced to slavery by others.
In the next place, he should take care, that they seek to take the lead for the benefit of those who are under them, and not to exercise a despotism over all.
In the third place, that those only are slaves who are fit to be only so.
Reason indeed concurs with experience in showing, that all the attention which the legislator pays to the business of war, and all other rules which he lays down, should have for their object rest and peace.
Since most of such states as the above are preserved by war;
but, as soon as they have acquired a supreme power over those around them, are ruined.
For during peace, like a sword, they lose their brightness:
the fault of which lies in the legislator, who never taught them how to be at rest.
As there seems to be the same end common to a man both as an individual and a citizen, and as of necessity a good man and a good citizen must have the same object in view ;
it is evident that all the Rest and statespeace end to an to individu­ as als.
virtues which lead to rest are necessary;
for, as we have often said, the end of war is peace, and of labour, rest.
But both those virtues whose object is rest, and those also whose object is labour, are necessary for a liberal life and rest;
for we want a supply of many necessary things, in order that we may be at rest.
A city therefore ought to be temperate, brave, and patient;
for, according to the proverb, " Rest is not for slaves;
" but those who cannot bravely face danger are the slaves of those who attack them.
Bravery, therefore, and patience are necessary for labour, philosophy for rest, and temperance and justice at both times;
but these chiefly in time of peace and rest.
For war obliges men to be just and temperate, but the enjoyment of pleasure and peaceful repose is more apt to produce insolence.
Those indeed who are easy in their circumstances, and enjoy every thing that can make them happy, have great occasion for the virtues of temperance and justice.
Thus, if there are, as the poets tell us, any in­ habitants in the Happy Isles, to these a higher degree of phi­ losophy, temperance, and justice will be necessary, as they live at their ease, in the full plenty of all such pleasures.
It Peaceful virs tues therefore superior to warlike ones.
is evident therefore, that a share of these virtues is necessary in every state that would be happy or worthy;
for he who is worthless can never enjoy real good, much less is he qualified to be at rest;
but can appear good only by labour and being at war, but while at peace and at rest, the meanest of men.
And for this reason virtue should not be cultivated as among the La­ cedaemonians ;
for they do not differ from others in considering different things from others as the chiefest good, but in ima­ gining that this good is to be procured by one particular virtue.
But since these are greater goods, hence it is evident that the enjoyment of these is greater than that of those virtues, and that it is so for its own sake;
but how and by what means this is to be effected, must now be scientifically considered.
We have already assigned three causes on which it will de­ pend, nature, custom, and reason, and we have shown what sort of men nature must produce for this purpose;
it remains then as to education, that we determine with which we shall first begin, reason or custom.
For these ought always to con­ spire in the most entire harmony with each other;
for it may happen, that reason may miss the best end proposed, and yet be corrected by custom.
In the first place, then, it is evident that in this, as in other things, its beginning arises from some principle, and its end also arises from another principle, which is itself an end.
Now, with us, reason and intelligence are the end of nature;
our production, therefore, and the care of our habits, ought to be accommodated to both these.
In the next place, as the soul and the body are two distinct things, so also we see that the soul is divided into two parts, the rea­ soning and unreasoning, with their habits ;
and these are two

seen in children nearly as soon as they are born ;
but reason and intelligence spring up as they go on to maturity.
The body, therefore, necessarily demands our care previous to the soul;
next the appetites, for the sake of the mind;
the body, for the sake of the soul,SINCE then the legislator ought to take care that the bodies of the children are as perfect as possi­ ble, his first attention ought to be given to matri- Marriage an object of con­ sideration.
mony;
at what time and in what condition it is proper that the citizens should engage among themselves in the nuptial con­ tract.
Now, with respect to this alliance, the legislator ought to consider the parties and their time of life, that they may cor­ respond in their ages, and that their bodily powers may not be different;
that is to say, the man being still able to beget children, but the woman too old to bear them ;
or, on the contrary, the woman being young Fit age of the parties.
enough to produce children, but the man too old to be a father ;
for from such a situation discords and disputes continually arise.
In the next place, with respect to the succession of children, there ought not to be too great an interval of time between them and their parents;
for, when there is, the pa­ rent can receive no benefit from his child's affection, or the child any advantage from his father's protection.
Neither should the difference in years be too little, as great inconve­ niences may arise from it;
for proper reverence is not shown to such parents, by a boy who considers his father as nearly his equal in age, and disputes are wont to arise in the management of the family.
But, to return to the point of our digression, care ought to be taken that the bodies of the children may be such as will answer the expectations of the legislator ;
and this also will be effected by the same means.
Since the season for the production of'children is determined, generally speaking, at seventy years of age for the man, and for the woman at fifty, the entering into the marriage state, as far as time is concerned, should be regulated within these periods.
It is extremely bad for the production of children that the father be too young ;
for in all animals whatsoever the offspring of the young are imper­ fect, and they are more likely to beget females than males, and diminutive also in size.
The same thing of course necessarily holds true with regard to men ;
as a proof of this, in those cities where the men and women usually marry very young, the people in general are very small and ill-formed ;
in childbirth also the women suffer more, and more of them die.
And thus some persons tell us the oracle at Træzen should be explained, as if it referred to the many women who were destroyed by too-early marriages, and not to their gathering their fruits too soon.
It is also conducive to temperance not to marry too soon ;
for women who marry early are apt to be intemperate.
It also prevents the bodies of men from acquiring their full size, if they marry before their growth is completed;
for there is a determinate period, beyond which there is no further in­ crease.
For this reason the proper time for a woman to marry is, eighteen, for a man thirty-seven, a little more or less;
for when they marry at that time their bodies are in perfection, and they will also together cease to have children at a proper time.
And moreover with respect to the succession of the children, if they have them at the time which may reasonably be expected, they will be just arriving at perfect manhood when their parents are sinking down under the load of seventy years.
Thus much then we have said as to the time which is proper Proper season of the year, for marriage;
but moreover a proper season of the year should be observed, as many persons do' now, appropriating the winter for this matter.
The married couple ought also to regard the precepts of phy­ sicians and naturalists, for physicians speak sufficiently as to the periods of the year which suit the body, and philosophers praise the northern rather than the southern winds, both of whom have treated on the procreation of children.
As to what is the fit disposition of body for the children which are to be born, we will now set aside the question, as it will better suit to speak of it when we treat of the education of children;
but it is enough to draw out a slight sketch at pre­ and condition of the body.
sent.
Now, the habit of body belonging to a wrestler is not suited to political life, nor to health, nor to the procreation of children;
nor is an infirm habit or too much dispirited by misfortunes, but one between both of these.
The man ought to have a habit of labour, but not of too violent labour ;
nor should that be confined to one ob­ ject only, as that of a wrestler;
but to such things as are proper for freemen.
These things are equally necessary both for men and women.
It is right also that women with child should take care of their bodily health, not living without ex­ ercise, nor using too spare a diet;
and this it will be easy for the legislator to effect, if he commands them once every day to repair to the regular worship of the gods who are honoured as presiding over matrimony.
But, contrary to what is pro­ per for the body, the mind ought to be kept as tranquil as possible;
for as plants partake of the nature of the soil, so do children receive much of the disposition of the mother.
With respect to the exposing or bringing up of children, let it be a law, that nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought up ;
but to avoid an excess of population, let some law be laid down, if it be not permitted by the customs and habits of the people, that any of the children Checks to po­ pulation.
born shall be exposed;
for a limit must be fixed to the po­ pulation of the state.
But if any parents have more chil­ dren than the number prescribed, before life and sensation begins, an abortion must be brought about;
for what is right and contrary to right in such a case is determined by sensation and life.
And as the proper time has been pointed out for a man and a woman to enter into the mar­ riage state, so also let us determine how long it is advan­ tageous for the community that they should continue to beget children ;
for as the children of those who are too young are imperfect both in body and mind, so also those whose parents are too old are weak in both.
While therefore the intellect continues in perfection, which (as some poets say, who reckon the different periods of life by sevens) is up to fifty years, or four or five more, the children may be equally perfect;
but when the parents are past that age, it is better they should abstain from sexual intercourse, openly at least;
but after that time intercourse should be continued only for the sake of health or some other cause.
With respect to any connexion between a man and a woman, when either of the parties are betrothed, let it be held in utter detestation on any pretext whatsoever;
but should any one be proved guilty of such a thing after the marriage is consummated, let his infamy be as great as his guilt deserves.
1
The rearing of children.
1. Bodily.
BUT when a child is born, it must be supposed that the strength of its body will depend greatly upon the quality of its food.
Now whoever will examine into the nature of animals, and also observe those people who are very desirous their children should acquire a warlike habit, will find that they feed them chiefly with abundance of milk, as being best accommodated to their bodies, but without wine, to prevent any distempers.
Those motions also which are natural to their age are very serviceable;
and to prevent any of their limbs from being crooked, on account of their extreme ductility, some people even now use parti­ cular machines in order that their bodies may not be distorted.
It is also useful to inure them to the cold when they are very little ;
for this is very serviceable for their health, and also most useful for the business of war.
For this reason it is cus­ tomary with many of the barbarians to dip their children in rivers, when the water is cold;
with others, to clothe them very slightly, as among the Celts;
for whatever it is possible to accustom children to, it is best to accustom them to it from the first, but to do it by degrees.
Besides, children have naturally a habit of loving the cold, on account of their natural heat.
The earliest age, then, ought to be regarded with such and similar attention.
During the next period to this, which con­ tinues till the child is five years old, it is best to teach him nothing at all, not even necessary labour, lest it should hinder his growth ;
but he should be accustomed to use so much motion as to avoid an indolent habit of body ;
and this he will acquire by various means, and among others by play ;
his play also ought to be neither illiberal, nor too laborious, nor lazy.
Their go- 2. Mental.
vernors and preceptors also should take care what sort of tales and stories it maybe proper for them to hear;
for all these ought to pave the way tor their future instruction ;
for which reason the generality of their play should be imitations of what they are afterwards to do seri ously.
They too do wrong who forbid by laws the disputes and little troubles between boys, for they contribute to in­ crease their growth.
For they act as a sort of exercise to the body, and the struggles of the heart, and the compression of the spirits, give strength to those who labour, which happens to boys in their disputes.
The preceptors also ought to have an eye upon their manner of life, and those with whom they converse;
and to take care that they are as little as possible in the company of slaves.
At this time and till they are seven years old, it is necessary that they should be educated at home.
It is also very pro­ per to banish, both from their hearing and sight, every thing which is illiberal and the like.
In- Home training.
Every thing in­ decent to be kept from children, deed it is as much the business or the legislator, as any thing else, to banish every indecent expression out of the state ;
for from a permission to speak whatever is shameful, very quickly arises the doing it, and this particularly with young people.
For which reason let them never speak nor hear any such thing;
but if it appears that any freeman has done or said any thing that is forbidden, before he is of age to be thought fit to partake of the common meals, let him be punished by disgrace and stripes;
but if a person above that age does so, let him be treated as you would a slave, on account of his being infamous.
Since we forbid his speaking every thing which is forbidden, it is necessary that he neither see obscene stories or pictures ;
1 the magistrates therefore are to take care, that there are no statues or pictures of any thing of this na­ ture, except only to those gods to whom the law permits them, and to which the law allows persons of a certain age to pay their devotions, for themselves, their wives, and children.
It should also be forbidden by law for young persons to be present either at Iambics or comedies, before Plays.
they are arrived at that age when they are allowed to partake of the pleasures of the table ;
indeed a good education will preserve them from drunkenness and from all the evils which attend on these things.
We have at present just cursorily touched upon this subject;
it will be our business hereafter, when we properly come to it, to determine whether this care of children is unnecessary, or, if necessary, in what manner it must be done;
at present we have only mentioned it as ne­ cessary.
Probably the saying of Theodorus;
the tragic actor, was not a bad one, " That he would permit no one, not even the meanest actor, to go upon the stage before him, that he might first engage the ear of the audience."
The same thing happens both in our connexions with men and things;
what we meet with first pleases best.
And for this reason children should be kept strangers to every thing which is bad, more particularly whatsoever is loose and offensive to good man­ ners.
When five years are accomplished, the two next may be very properly employed in being spectators of those exercises which they will afterwards have to learn.
There are two Two periods of education.
periods into which education ought to be divided, according to the age of the child ;
the one is, from his being seven years of age to the time of boy­ hood;
the other, from thence till he is one and twenty.
For those who divide ages by the number seven are in general wrong ;
it is much better to follow the division of nature ;
for every art and every instruction is intended to complete what nature has left defective.
We must first then consider, if any regulation whatsoever is requisite for children;
in the next place, whether it is advantageous to make it a common care, or that every one should act therein as he pleases, as is the general practice in most cities ;
and, in the third place, what it ought to be.
The neglect of education pre­ judicial to the state.
No one can doubt that the legislator ought greatly to interest himself in the care of youth;
for, where it is neglected, it is hurtful to the city.
1
For every state ought to be governed according to its particular nature;
for the character of each government is that which peculiarly marks it, and as this originally estab­ lished it, so it usually preserves it.
For instance, a demo­ cratic character preserves a democracy, the oligarchic an oli­ garchy, but universally the best character tends to produce the best government.
Besides, as in every business and art there are some things necessary to the performance of their several works which men must learn first, and to which they must be accustomed;
so it is evident that the same thing is necessary towards the practice of virtue.
As there is one end in view in every city, it is evident that education ought to be one and the same in Education the same in all states.
all;
and that.
this should be a common care, and not that of each individual, as it now is, when every one takes care of his own children separately, and each parent in private teaches them as he pleases, but the training of what belongs to all ought to be in common.
Besides, no one ought to think that any citizen belongs to him in particular, but to the state in general;
for each one is a part of the state, and it is the natural duty of each part to regard the good of the whole ;
and for this the Lacedæmonians may be praised, for they give the greatest attention to education, and The Spartan system praised.
they make it public.
1
It is evident then, that laws should be laid down concerning education, and that it should be public.
WHAT education is, and how children ought to be Shall we edu­ instructed, is what should be well known;
for cate with a view to utility, or to virtue?
now-a-days there are doubts concerning the busi­ ness of it, as all people do not agree in those things they would have a child taught, both with respect to their improvement in virtue, and a happy life :
nor is it clear, whether the object of it should be to improve the intellect, or to rectify the morals.
The view gained from the present mode of education is confused, and we cannot determine with certainty whether it is right to instruct a child in what will be useful to him in life ;
or in that which tends to virtue, and is really excellent:
for all these things have their separate defenders.
As to virtue, there is no particular in which they all agree :
for as all do not equally esteem all virtues, it reasonably follows that they will not cultivate the same.
It is evident, that out of the number of useful things, what is necessary ought to be taught to all:
but that which is neces- Freemen to be debarred from illiberal arts.
sary for one is not necessary tor all;
for as there ought to be a distinction between the employ­ ment of a freeman and a slave, the freeman should be taught every thing useful, which will not make him who knows it mean.'
But every work is to be esteemed mean, and every art, and every discipline as well, which renders the body, the mind, or the understanding of freemen unfit for the habit and practice of virtue.
For which reason all those arts which tend to deform the body are called mean, and all those employments which are exercised for gain ;
for they take off from the leisure of the mind, and render it sordid.
There are also some liberal arts, which are not improper for freemen to apply to in a certain degree;
but all sedulous endeavour to acquire a perfect skill in them, is exposed to the faults I have just mentioned.
For there is a great deal of difference in the reason for which any one does or learns any thing:
for it is not illiberal to engage in it for the sake of oneself, or of one's friend, or in the cause of virtue ;
while, at the same time, to do it for the sake of another, may seem to be acting the part of a servant and a slave.
The modes of instruction which now prevail, as we said before, seem to partake of both these parts.
THERE are as nearly as possible four things which it -is usual to teach children :
1 reading, gymnastic exercises, and music, to which (in the fourth place)

some add painting.
Reading and painting they teach as be­ ing both of them of great and various use in life, and gymnastic exercises, as tending to produce courage.
As to music, some persons may entertain a doubt, since most persons now use it for the sake of pleasure:
but those who originally made it part of educa- Music to be taught, as a means of em­ ploying leisure well.
tion, did so because, as has been already said, nature requires not only that we should be properly employed, but that we should be able to enjoy leisure honourably :
for this (to repeat what we have already said) is of all things the principal.
But, though both labour and rest are necessary, yet the latter is preferable to the former;
and by all means we ought to learn what we should do when at rest:
for surely we ought not to employ that time in play;
for then play would be the neces­ sary business of our lives.
But since this cannot be, play is more necessary for those who labour than for those who are at rest;
for he who labours requires relaxation ;
and this play will supply.
For as labour is attended with pain and con­ tinued exertion, on this account it is necessary that play should be introduced, under proper regulations, as a medicine :
for such an employment of the mind is a relaxation to it, and combines ease with pleasure.
Now rest in itself seems to par­ take of pleasure, and happiness, and an agreeable life :
but this cannot be theirs who labour, but theirs who are at rest;
for he who labours, labours for the sake of some end which he has not attained;
but happiness is an end which all persons think is attended with pleasure, and not with pain.
Now all persons do not agree in making this pleasure consist in the same thing;
for each one has his Different standards of pleasure.
particular standard, corresponding to his own habits ;
but the best man proposes the best pleasure, and that which arises from the noblest actions.
So that it is evident, that to live a life of rest, there are some things which a man must learn and be instructed in ;
and that the object of this learning and this instruction is only their acquisition :
but the learning and instruction which is given for labour, has for its object other Music taught among the ancients.
things.
For this reason the ancients made music a part of education;
not as a thing neces­ sary, (for it is not of that nature,) nor as a thing useful, as reading is, towards the common course of life, or for managing of a family, or for learning any thing as useful in public life.
Painting also seems useful, to enable a man to judge more accurately of the productions of the finer arts.
Nor is it like the gymnastic exercises, which contribute to health and strength;
for neither of these things do we see produced by music.
There remains for it, then, to be the employment of our rest, and this is the end which they had in view who introduced it;
for they thought it a proper em­ ployment for freemen, and to them they allotted it;
as Homer sings :
"
How right to call Thalia to the feast!
"1 and, addressing some others, he says:
The bard was call'd, to ravish every ear and, in another place, he makes Ulysses say, that the happiest part of man's life is, " When at the festal board in order placed, They listen to the song.”2 A liberal edu­ cation over and above mere utility.
It is evident then, that there is a certain educa­ tion in which a child may be instructed, not as useful, nor as necessary, but as noble and liberal;
but whether this is one or more than one, and of what sort, and how it is to be taught, shall be considered here­ after.
We have now gone so far on our way as to show that we have the testimony of the ancients in our favour, by what they have handed down to us upon education ;
for music makes this plain.
Moreover, it is necessary to instruct children in what is useful, not only on account of its being useful in it­ self, as, for instance, to learn to read, but also as the means of acquiring other different sorts of instruction.
Thus, they should be instructed in painting, not only to pre­ vent their being mistaken in purchasing pictures, or in buying or selling of vases, but more particu-

larly as it makes them judges of the beauties of the human form ;
for to be always hunting after the profitable ill agrees with great and freeborn souls.
But as it is evident that a child should be taught morals before reasoning, and that his body should be cultivated before his intellect, it is plain that boys should be first put under the care of the different masters of the gymnastic arts, both to form the constitution of their bodies and to teach them their exercises.
Now of those states which seem to take the greatest care of their children, some aim at pro­ ducinE' in them a habit framed by athletic exer- Bodily train­ ing of children.
cises, though these both prevent the growth, and hurt the form of their bodies.
1
But into this fault the Lacedæmonians did not- fall;
for they made their children fierce by painful labour, considering this to be chiefly useful to inspire them with courage.
Though, as we have already often said, this is neither the only thing, nor the prin-

cipal thing, necessary to attend to.
And even with respect to this, they do not thus attain its end ;
for we do not find either in other animals, or in other nations, that courage necessarily attends the most cruel, but rather the milder, and those who have the dispositions of lions.
For there are many people, who are eager both to kill men, and to devour human flesh, as the Achæans, and Heniochi2 in Pontus, and many others in Asia;
some of whom are as bad, and others worse, than these, who indeed live by freebooting, but are men of no courage.
Nay, we know that the Lacedæmonians themselves, while they continued those painful labours, were superior to all others, though now they are inferior to many, both in war and gymnastic exercises;
for they did not acquire their su­ periority by training their youth to these exercises, but be­ cause, being disciplined themselves, they were opposed to those who were not disciplined at all.
What is fair and honourable ought then to take the foremost place in education;
for it is not a wolf, nor any other wild beast, that will brave any Not to be severed from mental train­ ing.
noble danger, but rather a good man.
So that those who permit boys to engage too earnestly in these exercises, while they do not take care to instruct them in what is necessary to do, render them too mean to speak the truth, and accomplished only in one duty of a citizen, but in every other respect good for nothing, as reason evinces.
Nor should we form our judg­ ments from past events, but from what we see at present:
for now they have rivals in their mode of education, whereas formerly they had not.
That gymnastic exercises, then, are useful, and in what manner, is admitted;
for during youth, it is very proper to go through a course of those which are most gentle, omitting that violent diet and those painful exercises which are prescribed as necessary;
that there may be nothing to prevent the growth of the body.
And it is no small proof that they have this effect, that amongst the Olympic victors we can scarce find two or three who have gained a victory, both when boys and men, because the ne­ cessary exercises they went through when young deprived Age for bodily training.
them of their strength.
When they have allotted three years from the time of boyhood to the other parts of education, they are then of a proper age to submit to labour and a regulated diet.
For it is impos­ sible for the mind and body both to labour at the same time;
as each labour is productive of contrary evils ;
the labour of the body preventing the progress of the mind, and the mind of the body.
Doubts re­ specting music.
WITH respect to music we have already suggested some doubts;
so that it will be proper to go over again more particularly what we then said, which may serve as an introduction to what any person may choose to say upon it by way of remark.
For it is no easy matter distinctly to point out what power it has, nor on what accounts one should apply it, 1.
Is it to be regarded as a mere pastime ?
whether as an amusement and refreshment, like sleep or wine ;
-( for these are nothing serious, but pleasing, and the " killers of care," as Euripides says ;
2 for which reason they class them in the same order, and use for the same purpose all these, namely, sleep, wine, and music;
and to these some add dancing ;
)—or shall we rather suppose that music has a tendency to produce virtue, having a power, as the gymnastic exercises have, to form the body 2.
Or has it any moral effects ?
in a certain way, and to influence the manners, so as to ac­ custom its professors to rejoice rightly ?
Or shall we say, that it is of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence ?
for this also is to be regarded as a third pro­ perty attributed to it.
Now it is evident that boys are not to be instructed in it as play;
for those who learn do not play, for to learn is accompanied by pain :
neither is it proper to permit boys at their age to enjoy perfect leisure;
for to cease from education is by no means fit for what is as yet imperfect.
But it may be thought that the earnest attention of boys is be­ stowed on this art for the sake of that amusement which they will enjoy when they come to be men and completely formed ;
but, if this is the case, why are they themselves to learn it, and not follow the practice of the kings of the Medes and Persians, who enjoy music by hearing others play, and so gain a share of pleasure and instruction ?
For of necessity those must be better skilled therein, who make this science their particular study and business, than those who have only spent so much time at it as is sufficient just to learn the principles of it.
But if it is fit that children should toil at such matters, they ought also to learn the art of cookery;
but this is absurd.
The same doubt occurs, if music has a power of improving the manners;
for why should they on this ac­ count themselves learn it, and not learn to rejoice rightly and to be able to form a judgment, by hearing others, as the Lacedaemonians ?
For without having ever learnt music, they are yet able to judge accurately, as men say, what melody is good and what is bad.
The same reasoning may be applied if music is supposed to be the amusement of those who live an elegant and easy life;
for we ask why should they learn themselves, and not rather enjoy the benefit of others' skill?
Analogy drawn from the gods.
Let us here consider what is our belief of the immortal gods in this particular.
Now we find the poets never represent Jupiter himself as sing­ ing and playing;
nay, we ourselves treat the professors of these arts as mean people, and say, that no man would prac­ tise them but a drunkard or a buffoon.
But probably we may consider this subject more at large hereafter.
The first question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of education ?
and of these three things which have been started in discussion, which is it able to effect ?
Is it to instruct, to amuse, or to employ leisure ?
Now all three ends are pro­ perly allotted to it, for it appears to partake of them all:
for play is necessary for relaxation, and relaxation is pleasant, as it is a medicine for that uneasiness which arises from labour.
It is admitted also that a happy life must be an honourable one, and a pleasant one too, since happiness consists in both these;
and we all agree, that music is one of the most pleas­ in- things, whether alone or accompanied with a voice;
as Musæus says, “ Music, man's sweetest joy for which reason it is justly admitted into every company and every happy life, as having the- power of inspiring joy.
So that from this any one may suppose that it is fitting to in-
It is harmless and conducive to the end of life.
struct young persons in it.
For all those pleasures which are harmless are not only conducive to the final end of life, but serve also as relaxations;
and, as men but rarely attain that final end, they often cease from their labour, and apply themselves to amuse­ went, with no further view than to acquire the pleasure attending it.
It is therefore useful to enjoy some such pleasures as these.
There are some persons who make play and amusement their end, and probably that end has some pleasure annexed to it, but not what should be:
but while men seek the one, they accept the other for it.
Because there is some likeness in human actions to the end:
for the end is pursued for the sake of nothing else that attends it, but for itself only;
and pleasures like these are sought for, not on account of what follows them, but on account of what has gone before them, as labour and grief.
For this reason they seek for happiness in these sort of pleasures ;
and that this is the reason any one may readily perceive.
That music should be general, not on this account only, but also as it is very serviceable towards.
relaxation from labour, probably no one doubts.
We should also inquire, then, whence this arises;
for it is too noble in its nature to be ultimately intended for this purpose ;
and we ought not only to partake of the com­ mon pleasure arising from it-( of which all have the sensa­ tion, for music naturally gives pleasure, and therefore the use of it is agreeable to all ages and all dispositions);
—but also to examine if it tends in any way to improve our manners and our souls.
And this will be easily known, if we feel our dispositions any way influenced thereby:
and that they are so is evident from Moral effects of music.
many other instances, as well as from the music at the Olympic games;
and this confessedly fills the soul with en­ thusiasm :
but enthusiasm is an affection of the soul which strongly agitates the disposition.
1 Besides, all those who hear any imitations sympathize there­ with ;
and this when they are conveyed even
The power of imitation, without rhythm or verse.
Moreover, as music chances to be one of those things which are pleasant, and as virtue itself consists in rightly enjoying, loving, and hating, it is evident that we ought not to learn, or accustom ourselves to any thing so much as to judge right, and to rejoice in honourable manners and noble actions, But anger and mildness, courage and modesty, and their contraries, as well as all other dispo- sitions of the mind, are most naturally imitated by music and poetry.
This is plain from experience, for when we hear these our very soul is altered ;
and he who is affected either with joy or grief by the imitation of any objects, is in very nearly the same situation as if he was affected by the objects them­ selves.
Thus, if any person is pleased with seeing a statue of any one, on no other account but its beauty, it is evident that the sight of the original, from whence it was taken, be found only to in the hearing.
would also be pleasing.
Now it happens that in the other senses there is no imitation of manners ;
that is to say, in the touch, and the taste;
in the objects of sight, a very little:
for these are merely repre­ sentations of things, and the perceptions which they excite are in a manner common to all.
Besides, statues and paint­ ings are not properly imitations of manners, but rather signs and marks which show that the body is affected by some passion.
However, the difference is not great, yet young men ought not to view the paintings of Pause, but of Polyg­ notus, or any other painter or statuary who expresses man­ ners.
1
But in poetry and music there are imitations of man­ ners ;
and this is evident, for different harmonies differ from each other so much by nature, that those who hear them are differently affected, and are not in the same disposition of mind when one is performed as when another is ;
the one, The Lydian, Doric, and Phrygian measures.
for instance, occasions grief, and contracts the soul, as the mixed Lydian:
others soften the mind, and as it were dissolve the heart:
others fix it in a firm and settled state.
Such is the power of the Doric music only;
while the Phrygian fills the soul with enthusiasm, as has been well described by those who have written philosophically upon this part of education ;
for they bring examples of what they advance from the things themselves.
The same holds true with respect to rhythms;
some fix the disposition, others occasion a change in it;
some act more violently, others more liberally.
From what has been said it is evident what an influence music has over the Disposition of the mind, and how variously it can fascinate it:
and if it can do this, most certainly it is what youth ought to be instructed in.
And indeed the learning of music is par­ ticularly adapted to their disposition ;
for at their time of life they do not willingly attend to any thing which is not agree­ able, but music is naturally one of the most agreeable things;
and there seems to be a certain connexion between harmony and rhythm;
for which reason some wise men held the soul itself to be harmony, others, that it contains it.
WE will now determine, whether it is proper that children should be taught to sing and play upon any instrument, a matter of doubt which we started before.
Now it is clear that it makes a great .deal

of difference in qualifying persons for any art, if the person himself learns the practical part of it;
for it is a thing very difficult, if not impossible, for men to be good judges of what they cannot do themselves.
It is also very ne­ cessary that children should have some amusing employment.
For which reason the rattle of Ar- They need amusement.

for owing to their youthful age they cannot sit still.

hence it is evident, that they should be so taught music as to be able to practise it.

cult to say what is becoming or unbecoming of their age, or to answer the objections which some make to this employment as mean and low.

In the first place, since it is necessary for them to practise in order that they may be judges of the art, this, then, should be Popular objec­ tion to music answered.
done when they are young ;
but when they are grown older they may be spared the practical part, while they are able to judge of excellence in the art, and to take a proper pleasure in it, from the knowledge they acquired of it in their youth.
Another popu­ lar objection answered.
As to the censure which some persons throw upon music, as making men mean and low, it is not difficult to answer it, if we will but consider how far we propose that those who are to be educated so as to be­ come good citizens, should be instructed in this art, and with what music and what rhythms they should be acquainted ;
and also on what instruments they should learn to play;
for in these there is probably a difference.
Here then is the proper Limitations ne­ cessary.
answer to that censure, for it must be admitted, that in some cases nothing can prevent music being attended to a certain degree with the bad effects ascribed to it;
it is therefore clear, that the learning of it should never prevent the business of riper years, nor render the body ignoble and unfit for the business of war or the state;
so that it should be practised by the young, and used by the aged as a means to further instructions.
And what we want would happen in reference to music, if they are not employed in those parts of it which are the objects of dispute between the masters in that science, and perform such pieces as excite wonder from the difficulty of their exe­ cution ;
and which, transferred from the public games, are now become a part of education.
But let them learn so much of it as to be able to receive proper pleasure from excellent music and rhythms, and not that common part of music in which some of the brute animals take delight, and also slaves and boys.
It is therefore plain what instruments they should

use :
thus, they should never be taught to play upon the flute, or any other instrument which re­ quires great skill, as the harp, or the like, but on such as will make them good judges of music or any other branch of instruction.
Besides, the flute is not a moral instrument, but rather one that will inflame the pas­ sions, and is therefore rather to be used when the soul is to be animated, than when instruction is intended.
Let me add also, that there is something therein which is quite contrary to what education requires;
as the player on the flute is pre­ vented from speaking.
For this reason our forefathers very properly forbade the use of it to youth and freemen, though they themselves at first used it;
for when their riches pro­ cured them greater leisure, they grew more animated in the cause of virtue;
and both before and after the Persian wars, their noble actions so exalted their minds that they attended to every part of education ;
selecting no one in particular, but endeavouring to collect the whole.
And hence they intro­ duced flute-playing also, and joined it with their other branches of instruction.
At Lacedaemon' the choragus himself played on the flute for his choir ;
and it was so common at Athens, that almost every freeman understood it;
as is evident from the tablet which Thrasippus dedicated when he was choragus, but afterwards they rejected it as dangerous;
for they had become better judges of what tended to promote virtue, and what did not.
For the same reason many of the ancient in­ struments were thrown aside, as the magadis and the lyre ;
as also such as tended to inspire those who played on them with pleasure, and all which required a scientific finger.
What the ancients tell us by way of fable, of the flute, is indeed very rational;
namely, that after Minerva had found the flute she threw it away;
nor are they wrong who say, that the goddess disliked it because it deformed the face of him who played on it;
not but that it is more probable that she rejected it, as the knowledge thereof contributed nothing to the im­ provement of the mind.
Now, we regard Minerva as the in­ ventress of arts and sciences.
As we do not approve that a child should be taught to use and play on instruments like a master,-( and by this we mean that which is suited for contests in the art;
for he who plays in this way plays not to improve himself in virtue, but to please those who hear him, and this in a common way,)—therefore we think the practice of it unfit for freemen, but then it should be confined to hired persons;
for it usually gives people sordid notions, as the end they have in view is bad.
For the impertinent spectator is accustomed to make them change their music, so that it forces the artists who attend to him to mould their manners and their bodies according to his motions.
WE must now further enter into an inquiry con­ cerning harmony and rhythm ;
whether all sorts of these are to be employed in education, or Harmony and rythm.
whether a selection must be made;
and also whether we should give the same distinctions for those who are engaged in music as part of education, or whether there is something different from these two.
Now, as all music consists in me­ lody and rhythm,.
we ought not to be unacquainted with the power which each of these has in education ;
as also whether we should rather choose music in which melody prevails, or rhythm.
But as we consider that many things have been well written upon these subjects, not only by some musicians of the present age, but also by some philosophers, who are per­ fectly skilled in that part of music which belongs to educa­ tion ;
we will refer those who desire a very particular know­ ledge of it to those writers, and shall only treat of it in general Common divi­ sion of melody.
terms, speaking only in outline concerning it.
Melody is divided by some philosophers, of whose notions we approve, into moral, practical, and that which fills the mind with enthusiasm;
they also allot to each of these a particular kind of harmony which naturally cor­ responds to it;
and we say that music should not be applied to one purpose only, but to many;
both for instruction, and purifying the soul;
—(we now use the word purifying at pre­ sent without any explanation, but shall speak more at large of it in our Poetics ;
)—and in the third place, as an agreeable manner of spending the time and a relaxation from any un-

easiness ot the mind, it is evident, then, that all harmonies are to be used, but not for all purposes ;
the most moral, in education ;
but the most active and enthusiastic, to please the ear, when others play.
For that passion, which is to be found very strong in some souls, is to be met with also in all;
but the difference in different persons consists in its being in a less or greater degree, as pity, fear, and enthusiasm;
the latter of which is so powerful in some as to overpower the soul:
and yet we see those persons, by the application of sacred music to soothe their mind, rendered as sedate and composed as if they had employed the art of the physician.
Now this very same thing must necessarily happen to the compassionate, the fearful, and all those who are subdued by their passions ;
nay, all persons, as far as they are affected with those passions, admit of the same cure, and are restored to tranquillity with pleasure.
In the same manner, all music which has the power of purifying the soul, affords man a harmless pleasure.
Such therefore should be the harmony and such the music which those who contend with The music which purifies the soul is good.
each other in the theatre should exhibit.
But as the audience is composed of two sorts of people, the free and the well in­ structed, the rude, the mean mechanics, and hired servants, and a whole herd of the like, there must be some music and some spectacles to please and soothe them.
For as their minds are as it were perverted from their natural habits, so also is there an unnatural harmony and overcharged music which is accomodated to their taste:
but what is according to nature gives pleasure to every one;
and therefore those who are to contend upon the theatre, should be allowed to use this species of music.
But in education a moral kind of melody and harmony should be used;
and this is the Doric, as we have already said, or any other which is approved by those philosophers who are skilful in that music which is to be em­ played in education.
But bocrates, in the Re­ public of Plato, is very wrong, when he permits only the Phrygian music to be used besides the The error of Socrates in this respect.
Doric,1 particularly as amongst other instruments he banishes the flute.
For the Phrygian music has the same power in harmony as the flute has amongst the instruments ;
for they are both pathetic and raise the mind.
This is proved by the practice of the poets, for in their Bacchanal songs, or whenever they describe any violent emotions of the mind, the flute is the instrument which they chiefly use ;
and the Phrygian The Dithy­ ramb, harmony is most suitable to these subjects.
Now, it is allowed by general consent, that the Dithy­ rambic measure is Phrygian ;
and those who are conversant in studies of this sort bring many proofs of the fact.
As, for instance, when Philoxenus endeavoured to com-' pose Dithyrambic music for Doric harmony, he naturally fell back again into Phrygian, as being best fitted for that pur­ Character of Doric music.
pose.
Now every one indeed agrees, that the Doric music is most serious, and fittest to inspire courage:
and, as we always commend the middle as being between the two extremes, and the Doric has this relation with respect to other harmonies, it is evident that in this rather than in any other should the youth be instructed.
There are two points to be taken into consideration, both what is possible, and what is proper;
every one then should chiefly endeavour to possess himself of those things which contain both these qualities.
But this is to be regulated by different times of life;
for instance, it is not easy for those who are advanced in years to sing such pieces of music as require very high notes, for nature points out to them those which are gentle and require little strength of voice.
For this reason some who are skilful in music justly find fault with Socrates,1 because he would forbid the youth to be in­ structed in gentle harmony;
as if, like wine, it would intoxi­ cate them.
It does not, however, cause men to be Bacchanals, but languid, for it is wine rather which renders men Baccha­ nals.
These, therefore, and such-like melodies, are what should employ those who are grown old.
Moreover, if there is any harmony which is proper for a child's age, as being at the same time elegant and instructive, as the Lydian of all others seems chiefly to be, [this is to be adopted also.]
The three boundaries of education.
These then are to be laid down as it were the three boundaries of education, namely, modera­ tion, possibility, and decency.
THE economical and political science 1 differ not only in the same degree as a house and a city, (for these constitute the subject matter of them both.) but also in that political rule involves a plurality Difference be­ tween οὶκονο­ μική and πολι­ τική.
of governors, while economic rule is monarchical.
Now in some of the arts a division is made, and it does not belong to the same art to make a thing and to use what is made, as for example, a lyre and flutes.
It is however the province of the political science to constitute a city from the very first, and when constituted to turn it to a proper use ;
so that it is clear that it would naturally be the province of economic science both to found a house and to make use of it.
Now a city2 is such a collection of these houses and land and wealth, as brings about an independent A πόλις and an οίκος con­ trasted.
and happy life.
And this is clear from the fact that when­ ever the citizens are unable to attain this end, the community is dissolved.
And further, this is the end for which they com­ bine :
but that for the sake of which any thing exists and is produced, is its essence;
so that evidently economics are prior to politics in the order of nature, for their end is prior, and a house or family is a part of a city.
We must therefore look into the economical science, and see what is its end.
The component parts of an οίκος.
THE component parts of a house are a man and property.
But since the nature of any thing is first scientifically seen in its minutest parts,1 the same would be the case with regard to a house ;
so that accord­ ing to Hesiod it will be requisite that there should be, " First house, then wife, then oxen for the plough ;
" 2 for of these the first is requisite for the sake of food, and the Need of rules respecting a wife.
other two belong to freemen.
So that it would be necessary to lay down good regulations con­ cerning the association of a wife;
and this is to provide one of a fit and proper character.
But with regard to property, the first attention should be paid to that which is in accordance with nature;
but by nature agriculture is first, next come all those things which are derived from the earth, such as mining and other arts of the like kind.
But agri-

culture should be ranked first because it is just, for it does not derive its profits from men, either with their consent, like petty traffic and the mer­ cenary arts, or without their consent, like the arts which per­ tain to war.
Further also, agriculture is natural, for naturally every existing thing derives its nourishment from its mother, and so consequently men derive it from the earth.

For husbandmen are the only persons whose possessions lie outside of the city walls.
BUT as to man, the first object of his care should be respecting a wife ;
for the society which exists between the male and female is above all others

natural.
For it is laid down by us elsewhere,1 that nature aims at producing many such creatures as the several kinds of animals ;
but it is impossible for the female to accomplish this without the male, or the male without the female, so that the society between them exists of necessity.
In all other animals indeed, this association is irrational, and exists only so far as they possess a natural instinct, and for the sake of procreation alone.
But in the milder and more intelligent animals, this bond more nearly approaches perfection ;
for there seem to be in them more signs of mutual assistance and good-will, and of co-operation with each other.
But this is espe­ cially the case with man, because the male and female here co-operate not only for the sake of The conjugal tie.
existence, but of living happily.
And the procreation of chil­ dren is a means not only of subserving nature, but also of solid benefit;
for the labour which they expend during their season of vigour upon their helpless young is given back to them in the decay of age, from their children who are then in vigour.
And at the same time, by this continual cycle, nature provides for the continuance of the race as a species, since she cannot do so numerically.
Thus divinely predisposed towards such a society is the nature of both the male and the female.
For the sexes are at once divided, in that neither Distinct duties of them have powers adequate for all purposes, of the sexes.
nay, in some respects even opposite to each other, though they tend to the same end.
For nature has made the one sex stronger and the other weaker, that the one by reason of fear may be more adapted to preserve property, while the other, by reason of its fortitude, may be disposed to repel assaults;
and that the one may provide things abroad, while the other preserves them at home.
And with respect to labour, the one is by na­ ture capable of attending to domestic duties, but weak as to matters out of doors ;
the other is ill-adapted to works where repose is necessary, but able to perform those which demand exercise.
And with respect to children, the bearing of them belongs to one sex, but the advantage of them is common to both ;
for the one has to rear them, and the other to educate them.
The husband's duty towards his wife.
FIRST of all, then, certain laws are to be observed towards a wife, and especially to refrain from in­ juring her ;
for thus neither will a man be injured himself.
And this is suggested by the common law of nature, (bidding us,) as the Pythagoreans say, " not to injure a sup­ pliant torn away from the hearth ;
” but the injuries inflicted by a husband are his liaisons out of doors.
But as to inter­ course, the wife ought to be able to rest in the absence of her husband, and accustomed to be content whether he is with her or away from home.
Well then has Hesiod said, " A maiden wed, and wholesome laws instil;
" 1 for dissimilarity of manners is most apt to interrupt affection.
With respect to ornament, however, they ought not to ap­ proach each other with any studied affectation in their man­ ners or in their persons ;
for the society which is accompanied with studied ornament differs in no respect from that of tra­ gedians with each other on the stagedBUT of property, the first and most necessary part is that which is best and chiefest;
and this is man.
Hence it is necessary to obtain worthy slaves.
But there are two kinds of slaves, a steward and Good slaves also necessary.
a drudge.
But since we see that modes of education form the characters of the young, it is necessary when you have pro­ cured them to rear up those to whose care liberal offices are to be committed.

And the conduct or a master towards his slaves should be such as not to suffer them to be insolent or negligent;
and to those Their treat­ ment.
who are more liberal than others, he ought to give a share of honour, and to the working slaves a sufficiency- of food.
And since the drinking of wine makes even freemen insolent, and since many nations even of freemen abstain from it, (as the Carthaginians when on service,) it is clear that they should be allowed to partake of it either not at all or very seldom.
But as there are three things [to be regarded], work, punish­ ment, and food, to give them food unaccompanied by work or punishment, is wont to cause insolence;
but to give them labour and punishment without food is tyrannical, and makes them unable to work.
It remains, therefore, to give them employment and sufficient food;
for it is not possible to rule over them without giving a recompence ;
but the recompence of a slave is his food.
But as other men become worse when they get nothing by being better, and when no rewards are given for virtuous or vicious Need of en­ couraging slaves.
actions, so it is with slaves.
And hence we must look closely into their character, and distribute or withhold every thing according to merit, both food and clothing, leisure and pun­ ishments ;
imitating both in word and in deed the faculty of physicians, by way of a remedial measure, considering that food, owing to its being continual, has nothing remedial in it.
But those races of slaves will be best adapted for work which are not excessively cowardly or daring, for both of the latter act injuriously towards their masters:
those who are very cowardly will not endure to work, and the high-spirited are not easily ruled.
It is likewise requisite that an end should be defined to all things;
it is therefore right and expedient that freedom should be proposed to them as a reward ;
for they will be willing to labour when a prize and a definite space of bind How to the them to master's fa­ mily.
time is laid down.
It is right also to bind them as hostages by their families, and not to have too many slaves of the same nation;
and to appoint sacrifices and holidays, more for the sake of slaves than of the free;
for the latter possess more of these advan­ tages, and it is on this account that such things were devised.
How to acquire and how to preserve pro­ perty.
BUT there are four qualities pertaining to the master of a household which lie ought to possess respecting riches.
For he ought to be able to procure them, and also to preserve them ;
but if not, then there is no profit in procuring them ;
for this is but “to draw water in a sieve and a perforated tub," as the pro­ verb has it.
Moreover he ought to be apt in applying what lie possesses to the purposes of ornament and use, for it is on this account that we need such a thing as wealth.
The several kinds of his possessions ought moreover to be divided, and there ought to be more of them fruitful than unfruitful.
His em­ ployments also ought to be so divided as not to incur risks

with all his property at the same time.
And tor the purpose of preserving his property, it is ex­ pedient to use the Persian and Lacedæmonian cus­ toms.
The Athenian economy also is useful, for they sell their produce, and buy what they want] ;
and so there is no need for storing and warehousing in families of small means.
The Persian custom is that the master shall order and inspect every thing with his own eye, as Dion said of Dionysius ;
for no one takes the same care of what belongs to his neighbour as he does of his own property ;
so that it is necessary for a master himself to inspect every thing as far as possible.
The saying of the Persian and the African too is to the A master should super­ intend all things.
purpose ;
for the former, on being asked what was the best thing to fatten a horse, answered, " The eye of his master;
" and the African being asked what was the best manure, replied, " The foot- steps of the landowner."
Some things therefore should be in­ spected by the master himself, and some by his wife, according as the employments of housekeeping are divided between them.
And this is to be done but seldom in small establishments, but often in those where a steward is employed.
For it is not possible to imitate well, unless a good model is proposed, either ir.
other things or in the matter of a stewardship ;
so that it is impossible for stewards to be careful, where the masters are careless.
But since these things are both honourable in respect of virtue, and useful towards economy, it is requisite that masters should rise before their slaves and go to rest later, and that a house, like a city, should never be left unguarded ;
and what ought to be done should be omitted neither by day nor by night.
It is likewise well to rise before daybreak ;
for this contributes to health, wealth, and wisdom.
Where then the establishment is small, the Athenian method of disposing the fruits of the earth is useful;

must be made between the yearly and monthly expenditure;
and in like manner with respect to vessels in daily or oc­ casional use;
and these things must be given over, to the stewards.
And besides this, these matters should be reviewed at intervals of time, that it may be known what is preserved and what is wanting.
But with respect to the possessions themselves, the house should be furnished with a view to both health and comfort.
And by " possessions," I mean what is advantageous towards producing crops and clothing, and what suits for preserving dry or moist fruits;
and by other pos­ sessions, what places are accommodated to the reception of ani­ mate and inanimate things, whether slaves or freemen, women or men, strangers or citizens.

But this will be effected, if it is exposed to the north, and has less depth than width.
And in great establishments a doorkeeper would seem to be useful;
he may be one who is useless for other employments, except to watch over what is brought in or carried out of the house.
And for the ready use of utensils the Lacedæmonian method is serviceable ;
for every thing there must lie in its own place, for thus it will be ready at hand, and not have to be sought after (when wanted).
Portrait of a good wife.
A GOOD and perfect wife ought to be mistress of every thing within the house, and to have the care of every thing according to fixed laws :
allowing no one to come in unbidden by her husband, and especially keeping on her guard against every thing which can be noised abroad relating to a woman's dishonour.
So that if any mis­ chance has happened within doors, she alone ought to know about it;
but when those who have come in have done any thing wrong, the husband should bear the blame.
And she should manage the expenses laid out upon such festivals as her husband has agreed with her in keeping, and make an outlay of clothes and other ornaments on a somewhat lesser scale than is encouraged by the laws of the state ;
considering that neither splendour of vestments, nor pre-eminence of beauty, nor the amount of gold, contributes so much to the commendation of a woman, as good management in domestic affairs, and a noble and comely manner of life ;
since all such array of the soul is far more lovely, and has greater force (than any thing besides), to provide herself and her children true ornament till old age.
A wife therefore ought to inspire herself with confidence, and perpetually to be at the head of domestic affairs.
For it is unseemly for a man to know all
Her conduct towards her husband.
that goes on in the house;
in all respects indeed she ought to be obedient to her husband, and not to busy herself about public affairs, nor to take part in matrimonial concerns.
And when it is time to give his daughters in marriage, or to get wives for his sons, by all means in these respects she should obey her husband.
And she ought to show herself a fellow-counsellor to her husband, so as to assent to what pleases him, remembering that it is less unseemly for a husband to take in hand domestic matters, than for a wife to busy herself in affairs out of doors.
But the well-ordered wife will justly consider the behaviour of her husband as a model of her own life, and a law to herself, in­ vested with a divine sanction by means of the marriage tie and the community of life.
For if she can persuade herself to bear her husband's ways patiently, she will most easily manage matters in the house;
but if she cannot, she will have greater difficulty.
So that it will be seemly for her to show herself of one mind with her husband, and tractable, not only when her hus­ band is in good luck and prosperity, but also when he is in misfortune;
and when good fortune has failed him, or sick­ ness has laid hold of his bodily frame, or when he has been deprived of his senses, she ought gently and sympathetically to yield in any matter which is not base and unworthy;
but if her husband has been ailing and made a mistake, she ought not to keep it on her mind, but to lay the blame on disease or ignorance.
For in proportion as she is now more careful to give way, so much the more gratitude will her husband feel towards her, when his ailment has passed by ;
and if she fails to obey him when he commands something which is unseemly, he will be able to pardon her with a better grace when he re­ covers.
Observing such rules as these, the wife ought to show herself even more obedient to the rein than if site had entered the house as a purchased slave.
For she has been bought at a high price, for the sake of sharing life and bear­ ing children;
than which no higher or holier tie can pos­ sibly exist.
Further, if the husband with whom she has lived should fare amiss, her merit would In adversity.
not otherwise reach the same pitch of tame and of good report.
It is no small thing indeed to make a good use of prosperity, but it is a far greater thing to endure the contrary lot in a fitting manner.
For in every way it is the mark of a lofty mind to show no signs of depression under great sufferings and injuries.
It is indeed much to be desired that nothing of the kind should happen to her husband;
but if any thing of an adverse nature should surprise him, she ought straightway to consider that she will gain far higher praise if she directs Examples of noble matrons.
matters successfully ;
recalling to her mind the fact that neither would Alcestis have gained such renown, nor Penelope have been deemed worthy of so much praise, had they respectively lived with their hus­ bands in prosperous circumstances ;
and that it is the suffer­ ings of Admetus and Ulysses which have given to them an everlasting fame.
For by preserving faith and justice in the midst of their own husbands' misfortunes, they have gained a deserved reputation.
For it is easy to find persons who will share prosperity;
but, except a very few and very good ones, women are not willing to share misfortunes.
For all these reasons it behoves each woman above all things to honour her husband, and not to despise him if a sacred sense of respect and wealth, which, according to Orpheus, is "the child of con­ fidence," does not attend him.
A wife, then, ought carefully to preserve herself in such customs and laws as these.
Conduct of a husband to­ wards his wife.
BUT the husband in his turn should find out cer­ tain laws to regulate his treatment of his wife, as one who entered the house of her husband to share his children and his life, and to leave him a progeny destined to bear the names of her husband's parents and her own.
And what in the world could there be more holy than these ties ?
or what is there about which a man in his sound senses could strive more earnestly, than to beget the children who shall hereafter nurse his declining years, from the best and most praiseworthy of wives ;
for they are to be, as it were, the best and most pious preservers of their father and mother, and guardians of the entire family.
For it is probable that they will turn out good, if they have been reared uprightly by their parents in the habitual practice of what is just and holy ;
but if the contrary should be the case, they will suffer the loss themselves.
For unless parents afford their children a fit pattern of life, they will leave them an obvious excuse to quote against themselves.
And this is to be feared, that if they have not lived well, their sons will disregard them, and neg- Education of females.
lect them in their old age.
On this account nothing is to be omitted which tends to the fit education of a bride, so that the children may be born of the best possible mother.
For the husbandman neglects nothing so as to cast his seed upon the richest and best wrought ground, considering that it is from such a soil that he will here­ after reap the fairest fruits ;
and if any violence threatens, he fights against his enemy, and deliberately chooses to die rather than endure to see it ravaged;
and such a disposition as this is praised by most persons.
And as such is the care which is spent by us on the support of our bodies, what manner of men ought we to show ourselves on behalf of our children and of the mother that is to rear them ?
Ought we not most readily to strain every nerve ?
For in this way alone does the constitu­ tion of man's nature, which is mortal, attain to prosperity, and the prayers of parents all tend to this one end.
And hence, whoever cares not for this, is sure to be regardless of the gods.
It was for the sake of the gods, then, who were present to him when he offered the mar­ riage sacrifice, that he not only took to himself a Sanctity of marriage.
wife, but also (what is far more) gave himself over to his bride to honour her next to his own parents.
But that which is most precious in the eyes of a prudent wife, is to see her husband preserving himself entirely for her, thinking of no other woman in comparison with her, and regarding herself, above all other women, as peculiarly his own, and faithful towards him.
For in proportion as a wife perceives that she is faithfully and justly cared for, so much the more will she exert her energies to show herself such.
Whoever therefore is prudent, will not fail to remember with how much honour it becomes him to requite his parents, his wife, and his chil­ dren, in order that he may gain the name of one who is just and upright in distributing to each their due.
For every one is indignant beyond measure at being deprived of that which belongs to himself in a peculiar manner ;
and there is no one who is content at being deprived of his own property, though one were to give him plenty of his neighbour's goods.
And in very truth nothing is so peculiarly the property of a wife as a chaste and hallowed intercourse.
And hence it would not befit a prudent man to cast his seed wherever chance might take it, lest children should Evils of pro­ miscuous in­ tercourse.
be born to him from a bad and base stock, on an equality with his legitimate sons ;
and by this the wife is robbed of her con- jugal rights, the children are injured, and above all, the hus­ band himself is enveloped in disgrace.
He ought therefore to approach his wife with much self-restraint and decency, and to maintain modesty in his words, and in his deeds a regard to what is lawful and honest, and in his intercourse he should be true and discreet.
And to little errors, even though they be voluntary, he ought to vouchsafe pardon ;
and if she has made any mistake through ignorance, he ought to advise her, and not to inspire her with fear, except such as is accompanied with reverence and respect.
For such treatment would be more suited to mistresses at the hands of their gallants.
Yet, Reverence and fear.
nevertheless, justly to love her husband with re­ verence and respect, and to be loved in turn, is that which befits a wife of gentle birth, as to her intercourse with her own husband.
For fear is of two kinds;
the one kind is reverent and full of respect;
such is that which good sons exhibit towards their parents, and well- ordered citizens towards those who rule them in a kindly spirit.
But the other kind is attended by hatred and aver­ sion :
such is that which slaves feel towards their masters, and citizens towards unjust and lawless tyrants.
Furthermore, the husband ought to choose the best course out of all that we have said above, and so to conciliate his wife to himself, and to make her trustworthy and well disposed, as that whether her husband be present or absent, she will be equally good, while he can turn his attention to public matters:
so that even in his absence she may feel that no one is better, nor more suited to herself, nor more nearly bound to her, than her own husband:
and that he may always direct his energies to the public good, and show from the very first that such is the case, even though she may be very young and quite inex­ perienced in such matters.
For if the husband should ever begin such a course of conduct as this, and show himself to be perfect master of himself, he would be the best guide of the entire course of his life, and he would teach his wife to adopt a similar mode of action.
Homer joins love and rever­ ence.
FOR even Homer would not praise either love or fear apart from respect, but every where he in- troduces friendship accompanied with modesty and reverence.
At all events he represents Helen as regarding Priam with this kind of fear :
for he says, " Step-father dear, Thou in mine eyes art honoured and revered:
"' and by this he means nothing else except that her love is accompanied with respect.
And again, Ulysses thus ad­ dresses Nausicaa, “Lady, I do admire thee and revere." 2
Homer accordingly considers that these are the mutual terms on which a husband and wife should stand.
For no one ad­ mires and reverences his inferior ;
but such feelings arise only in regard to beings superior to each other in nature, and more friendly disposed;
and further, in the case of persons inferior to others in wisdom towards their superiors.
Such were the sentiments which Ulysses cherished towards Penelope, and long as he was absent from his home, he did not fail in his duty.
Agamemnon, indeed, for the sake of Chryseis, did err against his own wedded wife, Agamemnon.
for he dared to say in the assembly of the Greeks, that a cap­ tive lady, and in no way distinguished for her natural qua­ lities, but rather (to speak plainly) sprung of barbarian origin, was in no way inferior to Clytemnestra :
3 and as he already had sons born of her, he would seem to have acted amiss in this matter.
And how could he have been right, consider­ ing that he took to himself Chryseis by force as a concubine, even before he could know how she was disposed towards him?
But, Ulysses, when the daughter of Atlas earnestly besought him that he would remain with Ulysses.
her, promising that she would render him immortal, was not willing even for the sake of this boon to give up the love and affection and confidence of his wife, considering that immor­ tality would be a severe infliction upon him as the price of living on with villariy.
4
No, nor did he choose to live on with Circe,1 although she promised to restore his companions ;
but he answered that nothing in his own eyes could be more sweet than his country, rough and rugged though it were ;
and he desired far more to behold his mortal wife and child, than himself to possess immortality :
and thus he continued to preserve fidelity towards his wife firm and inviolate.
So that, as we might expect, he received a like return from his wife.
And further, too, in his speech addressed to Nausicaa, the poet shows that he praises above all things the chaste inter­ course between a husband and wife.
For he there 2 prays the gods that they will grant to her both her husband and home and concord, and this of no common kind, but perfect.
For he says, " There is no fairer thing,
Than when the lord and lady with one soul One home possess.”3
Here then, as is clear, the poet praises the mutual concord of husband and wife, and that too not the mere agreement upon servile matters, but that which is justly and harmoniously based on intellect and prudence.
For the words “possessing one home with one soul," show this.
Again, the same hero says, that while such concord flourishes between a husband and his wife, " Comes many a tear to foes, much joy to friends.
"
4 Advantages of domestic concord.
And the generality agree with him as speaking truly.
For when a man and his wife harmoniously co-operate in the same concerns, it needs must follow that the sentiments of both are the same.
And in the next place, gaining power by concord, they deprive their ene­ mies of all hope of success, and they can assist their friends;
but when they are at variance with each other, then their friends too are divided, and they especially feel their power­ lessness.
And hence the poet clearly admonishes the husband and wife that they ought by no means to join together in matters of villany and shame, but in matters just and right to assist each other, by unity of purpose;
and first of all in every way to take care of their parents, the man regarding those of his wife no less than his own, and the wife those of her husband.
In the next place, it would be necessary for both to take care of their children, friends, and fortunes, and of the entire household, as being their common property, en­ deavouring to outstrip each other in zeal and attentiveness, that each may become the author of as much good as possible, and may prove himself better and more scrupulously just:
as also to dismiss all haughtiness, and to adopt habits of industry, and so with gentle and kindly rule to regulate the house;
so that when they are now arrived at old age, having bade fare­ well to the duties of economy, and being freed from their passions, they may be able to give, each to the other and to their children, an account of their stewardship, as to which of the two has throughout bestowed greater attention to the management of their home, and so may know at once whether misfortune has come by chance or success by merit.
And whichever has excelled in these respects, will obtain from the gods one gift, the greatest of all.
For, as Pindar says, " Sweet hope that cheers the heart, bears company, And proves the nurse of age.”
1
And also he will obtain another piece of good fortune, namely, to be cherished in old age by his children.
On this account, both in public and private life, it would become the man who would pass a happy life, to have a regard for all the gods and his fellow-men, and especially for his wife, his children, and his parents.
HE who purposes duly to manage any branch of economy, should be well acquainted with the locality in which he undertakes to labour, andThe character of an econo­ mist.
should be naturally clever, and by choice industrious and just;
for if any one of these qualities be wanting, he will make many mistakes in the business which he intends to take in hand.
Now;
to speak by way of general distinction, there Four kinds of economy.
are four kinds of economy, the regal, the satra­ pical, the political, and the domestic ;
for all others, as we shall find, fall under one or other of these heads.
But of these the greatest and most simple is the regal;
the most varied and easiest is the political;
but the private is of all of the least importance and most various.
They must of necessity have very many points in common with each other ;
but we must look to those points which belong to each of them The regal.
distinctively.
First, then, let us consider the re­ gal.
This kind, indeed, is general in its force, and it contains four species, one concerning money, another concerning exports, a third concerning imports, while a fourth relates to expenditure.
And to speak of these severally ;
by that which concerns money I mean, what coin should be raised or lowered in price, and when;
and by that which refers to exports and imports, when and what it will be profitable to receive from the satraps in office, and to dispose for sale;
and as to expenditure, I mean what retrenchments must be made and when, and whether we must contribute money towards expenses, or those articles which are purchaseable by money.
The satrapical.
Its six divisions.
And secondly, the satrapical.
This embraces six kinds of revenue, from the soil, from the pe­ culiar productions of the country, from trade, from tolls, from cattle, and from all other sources.
And of these kinds the best is that concerned with the pro­ duce of land, (and this is what some call tithe,' and others tenths ;
) while next ranks that which is concerned with pecu­ liar productions, as for example, with gold, or silver, or brass, where they are severally found ;
thirdly comes that which has to do with traffic;
fourthly, that which arises from vegetable produce and market tolls;
while fifth is that which is con­ cerned with cattle, and which is called usufruct or tithe;
and last in order is that derived from other sources, and which is known by the names of a poll tax, or handicraft tax.
But
The political.
thirdly, 'let us considerj the political economy:
and of this, the best is the income which arises from the peculiar productions of the soil;
next, that which comes from traffic and carriage of goods ;
and then, that which is derived from matters of every-day life.
Fourth and last comes the domestic economy;
and this is the reverse of simple, owing to the fact that a house cannot of necessity be managed with a view to one single aim, and it is the least of all, because its incomings and outgoings are on a small scale.
And under this kind of economy the least is an income derived from land, secondly, from matters of daily life, and thirdly, from money.
And apart from these points (there is) a matter which belongs in common to every kind of economy, and which we must regard not as a casual matter, but as one which specially be­ longs to this last kind;
namely, that the expenses do not exceed the incomings.
Since, then, we have mentioned the divisions (of economy), next we must again ascertain, as to the satrapy or the city about which we are con- Practical considerations.
sidering, whether it is able to bear all these kinds of expendi­ ture which we have just now distinguished, or the greatest of them.
After this, which of the means of revenue either do not exist at all, but yet may be made available, or are at present small, and yet are capable of augmentation fand out of the present expenses, which and what amount may be re­ moved without doing harm.
We have spoken, then, as to the various kinds of economy and their separate parts:
but what­ ever has been effected by any ancient writers as to the supply of wealth, or whatever they have skilfully contrived, of this we have collected together all that we conceive to be worthy of mention :
for among these there are some matters which a man will be able to accommodate to any such business as he may take in hand.
CYPSELUS of Corinth made a vow to Zeus, that, if he should gain the supreme power in the state,' he would dedicate to the god all the property of theStory of Cypselus.
Corinthians.
So he ordered them to give in a written list of it;
and when they had done so, he took a tenth part away from each individual, and ordered them to earn money with the remainder.
And when the year came round again he did the very same thing;
and so in ten years the result was, that he possessed every thing which he had vowed to dedicate, while the Corinthians bad gained other money instead.
Of Lygdamis.
LYGDAMIS of Naxos expelled certain exiles;
and when no one was willing to buy their property except at a very low price, he sold it to the exiles themselves.
And as for all their offerings, which they had lying by them half-wrought in their workshops, he sold them to the exiles and to any one else who chose to buy them, so as to enrol the names of the buyers upon the register.
Of the Byzan­ tines.
THE Byzantines being hard-pressed for money, sold the public lands ;

but the unfruitful for ever in fee simple:
both those which belonged to.
a Thiasus 1 or a clan, and likewise whatever lay in the hands of private individuals;
for those to whom the other property belonged, bought them at a high price.
But to the members of the Thiasi (were given) other grounds belonging to the public, which lay near the gymnasium, or the agora, or the harbour.
And as for the market-places in which any thing used to be sold, and the fishery of the sea, and the salt­ market, and the places belonging to persons who were em­ ployed as conjurers, and soothsayers, and drug-venders, and other such occupations, they ordered them to pay the third part of their gains by way of tax.
And they sold the profits of the money-changers at one table ;
and no one besides had any thing to sell to another, nor to buy from another;
but if he had, he was immediately deprived of it.
And as there was a law among them to the effect that no one should be deemed a citizen who was not sprung from a citizen on both father.-, and mother's side, they decreed that whoever had one parent a citizen might become a citizen upon laying down 30 minee.
And being in want both of food and money, they brought back their ships from the Euxine Sea:
and after a time, as the merchants were indignant, they paid them a tenth by way of interest, and ordered that those who purchased any article should pay a tenth over and above the actual price.
And when certain Metœci had lent money on property already mortgaged, and when they could not get payment, they passed a decree that every one's property should be safe, who paid to the state the third part of the debt.
HIPPIAS of Athens sold those parts of the upper stories which projected into the streets, and the steps and palisades before the houses, and the doors

which opened outwards ;
these were bought by those who had property, and thus a large sum of money was collected.
And the coin which was current at Athens he proclaimed spurious ;
and setting upon it a fixed price, he ordered them to bring it back to him;
and when they met together for the purpose of devising a new coinage, be gave them back the same money as they had brought him.
And whenever any one was about to act as a trierarch or phylarch, or to give a chorus, or to expend money upon any other such liturgy,1 he laid upon him a small fine, and bade him pay this if he was willing, and then enrolled his name among those who had discharged a liturgy.
And he bade them offer to the priestess of Athena in the Acropolis, on behalf of every one who died, one chcenix of barley and another of wheat, and an obol besides;
and that the same offering should be made by every one to whom a child should be born.
THE Athenians who dwelt at Potidæa being in want of money for the war, agreed to order all the Of the Athenians of Polidæa.
citizens to enrol their properties, not collectively each in his own deme, but each property separately where it lay, that the poor might be able to make an assessment of their property ;
but that any one who had no property at all, should assess their own persons at 2 minæ.
From this pro­ ceeding they contributed the sum enjoined, to the preservation of their city.

money, as the citizens were accustomed to celebrate the Dionysia with splendour, providing for that festival many yearly shows and costly sacrifices, persuaded them when the feast was near at hand, to vow that they would give double the following year, and to collect together and sell what they had in hand.
Accordingly a large sum of money was col­ lected by them to meet their necessity.
THE people of Lampsacus, when a large body of Of the people of Lampsacus.
triremes was expected to come against them, the medimnus of corn being at 4 drachmas, ordered the retail dealers to sell it at 6 ;
and when the gallon of olive oil was at 4 drachmae and 3 obols, and wine and other pro­ visions in like manner.
So the individual got the accustomed value (for his goods), while the city gained what was over and above, and so became well supplied with money.
THE people of Heraclea, not being well furnished with money, sent forty ships to the tyrants about the Bosphorus, and bought up from the merchants all the corn, oil, and wine, and the rest of their provisions.
And when the time came round at which they were to pay the purchase money, and it was to the advantage of the merchants not to sell their wares by re­ tail, but wholesale, they did not set before them money, but made a mart on board of the vessels, and over each of the ships they set a man to dispense it.
And on their arrival at the enemy's land, the soldiers bought the whole from them.
The money therefore was collected before the generals gave back the pay, and so the result was that the same money was given until they returned home.
WHEN the people of Samos besought the Lacedæ­ monians to give them money in order to effect their return, the latter decreed that they would

therefore, that if any one of the citizens or metœci either had or wished to have a pledge from either the state or private persons, they should enrol their names.
And when many had enrolled themselves, they plundered the vessels which were sailing into the Euxine on a specious pretence.
And they appointed a time at which they said that they would give account con­ cerning them.
And when a large amount of money had been collected, they dismissed the soldiers, but went to law con­ cerning the pledges.
And the city out of its revenues gave back what they had lost to those who had been unjustly plun­ dered.
THE people of Cyzicus being at variance, the po­ pular party prevailed ;
and having taken the rich men prisoners, they decreed that as money was Of the Cyzi­ cenes.
owing to the soldiery, they would not put their prisoners to death, but that they would free them and banish them.
Of the Chums.
THE Chians, as they bad amongst them a law or­ dering them to enter a register of their debts in the public treasury, decreed that all debtors should pay back their debts to the state, and that the city out of its revenues should give interest to those who had advanced the money, until they should reach their former pitch of prosperity.
1
Of the tyrant Mausolus.
MAUSOLUS, tyrant of Caria, when the king sent to him to pay his tribute, collected together the wealthiest men in the country, and said that the king asked for the tribute, but that he himself bad no supply of money.
And certain persons, whom he had suborned, de­ clared to them how much each of them must contribute.
And when this was done, the wealthy individuals, partly through shame and partly through fear, promised and contributed a far larger sum than was specified.
Being again in want of money, he called an assembly and told the Mylassians that their city, which was the metropolis, was without walls, and that the king was about to march against it.
He therefore bade the Mylassians to contribute as much money as possible, saying that by what they should now contribute, they would save the rest.
And when a considerable sum had been contributed, he kept the money himself, and said that the god would not allow him immediately to build the wall.
2Of Condalus.
CONDALUS, a deputy of Mausolus, whenever any one brought him a sheep, or pio, or calf, as he passed through the country, used to mark, down the name of the donor and the time, and ordered him to carry it back home and keep if until he should come back;
and when a suitable time seemed to have arrived, he used to reckon up the profit and demand it back with the usufruct besides.
And as to such trees as projected over or fell upon the king's highways, he sold their preits.
And if any of the soldiers died, he exacted a drachma as a toll for the body passing the gate ;
accordingly he made money by the matter, and at the same time the rulers did not deceive him as to when the soldier died.
And as he saw that the Lycians were fond of wearing long hair, he said that letters had been received from the king, bidding them send away their hair to make false fronts, and that accordingly he had been bidden by Mausolus to shave them.
He said that therefore he would send for hair from Greece, if they would be willing to give him a specified sum as a poll-tax.
They willingly gave him what he demanded, and a considerable quantity of money was collected from a large multitude.
ARISTOTLE of Rhodes, governor of Phocæa, be­ ing in want of money, as he saw that the Pho­ cæans were cut into two factions, secretly came Of Aristotle of Rhodes.
to an agreement with one ot the factions, saying that their opponents were about to offer him money, on condition that he would put matters into their hands;
but that he himself preferred to receive money from the former party, and to give the city into their bands for them to manage.
And upon hearing this, those who were present at once furn­ ished money, and gave him as much, as he commanded them.
Then, again, he showed the others what he had received from their opponents ;
and they said they would give him just as much.
And having thus taken a bribe from both parties, he reconciled the factions together.
And seeing that law-suits were rife among the citizens, and that there were many in­ juries of long standing, he held a court, and laid down1 a law that judgment should no longer be given in the case of all out-standing charges.
Then by the deposits made in numer­ ous suits, and by reserving in his own hands those which involved damages, and by taking bribes from each party through the instrumentality of the other, he collected together no small amount of money.
Of the Clazo­ menians.
THE people of Clazomenæ, too, being afflicted with famine and in want of money, decreed that those private individuals who had any oil should lend it to the city a!
a certain interest:
now this fruit abounds in their country.
And having hired vessels from the lenders, they sent them off to the marts from which they had their supply of corn, leaving the value of the oil as a pledge.
And as they owed their soldiers pay to the amount of twenty talents, and were not able to furnish it, they gave the ge­ nerals four talents a year by way of interest.
But when they cut off nothing from the former debt, and were always ex­ pending money to no purpose, they coined some money of iron to stand in place of silver to the amount of twenty talents, and giving silver to all the richest men in the state upon a proportionate scale, they took back from them an equivalent.
So the private citizens had money to spend upon their daily wants, and the city was freed from its debt.
And, secondly, out of their revenues they paid them the interest due, and continually dividing it they gave a share to each, and called in the iron coinage.
Of the Sely­ brians.
THE Selybrians were in want of money;
and as there was a law among them not to export corn in a season of famine, and they had stores of corn of the preceding year, they passed a decree that private persons should give up their corn to the state at the fixed price, each leaving behind a year's supply:
then they gave leave to any one who chose to export it, affixing to it such a price as seemed good to them.
THE citizens of Abydos,—when their country was lying fallow on account of the prevalence of fac­ tion, as their metœci did not give them any thing, Of the citizen. of Abydos.
owing to the fact that they were still in debt,-passed a de­ cree that any one who chose might lend money to the hus­ bandmen, in order to induce them to work, as they themselves would get the first-fruits of the soil, and the others from what was left.

sessed, and having ordered them to pay the sum of silver which was necessary from the pillars of the temple, they allowed the name of him who gave the silver to be inscribed as if he had offered it.
DIONYSIUS of Syracuse, wishing to collect toge­ ther some money, called an assembly, and said that he had seen Demeter, who bade him offer at Of Dionysius at Syracuse.
her temple the ornaments of the women.
He said that he for his part had done this with the ornaments of the women in his own family, and he urged the others to do the same, lest some vengeance from the gods should befall them ;
and as for the man who refused to do thus, he declared that he should be deemed guilty of sacrilege.
And when all had brought what­ ever they possessed, through fear of the goddess and himself, he dedicated all the ornaments to the goddess, and took it back himself as a loan from the goddess.
And as time went on, and the women were beginning to wear gold again, he ordered that all women who wished to wear it should offer a certain specified sum at the temple.
And being about to build some triremes, he knew that he should be in want of money.
So he convened an assembly, and said that a certain city was on the point of being betrayed to him, but that he wanted mo­ ney for that purpose ;
and he urged the citizens each to bring him 2 staters:
and they brought them.
And after an inter­ val of two or three days, he pretended to have failed of his purpose, and having praised them, he gave back to each what they had brought.
And by so doing, he gained over the citizens to his cause.
Then they brought contributions again, thinking that they should get back their money ;
but he took them and kept them for the purpose of his ship-building.
And when he was short of money he coined some of tin, and having convened an assembly, he spoke much on behalf of the new coinage:
and they passed a decree, even against their will, that each would consider what he should take of it as silver, and not a baser metal.
Again, being in want of money, he urged the citizens to bring in their contributions :
but they said that they had nothing to give.
Accordingly he brought out the domestic utensils from his 6wn house, as though obliged to do so for want;
and when the Syracusans bought them, he wrote down what each bought, and as soon as they had put down the money, he ordered them each to carry back the vessel which he bad bought.
And as the citizens, owing to the property taxes, were unable to keep cattle, he said that he now had enough for such and such a purpose, and that there­ fore those who had any cattle should henceforth be free of tax.
And when many of them soon got cattle under the idea that they should have them free of tax, as soon as he thought a fit occasion was come, he ordered them to assess their value and laid a tax upon them.
The citizens accordingly were indig­ nant at the deceit of Dionysius, so they began to slaughter and sell them.
And when, to meet this, he ordered them to slaughter only as much as was wanted from day to day, they in turn accounted them as victims;
but he forbade them to sacrifice any female.
Again, when he was in want of money, he bade all the families of orphans to send him in a list of their property;
and when others had sent in their inventory, he was satisfied with the enjoyment of their property until they severally arrived at full age.
And having surprised Rhegium, he collected an assembly, and said that they might very justly have been reduced by him to slavery, but that now he was willing to let them off on receiving the amount which they had spent upon the war, and 3 minae besides for each individual.
But the Rhegians brought to light all their hidden treasures, and the poor borrowed from the rich and from the strangers, and so brought him the money which he demanded.
And when he had taken this from them, he nevertheless sold their persons, and seized upon all their disclosed treasures which up to that time had been concealed.
And having bor­ rowed money from the citizens upon a promise of restoring it, when they began to demand it back, he bade them bring him all the silver that they each possessed, threatening them with death as the punishment, in case they failed to do so.
And when the money was brought, he stamped it anew, and gave out the drachma of the value of two drachmas, and they brought back to him the debt which was previously owing.
And sailing to Tyrrhenia with a hundred ships, he took out of the temple of Leucothea gold and silver, and other orna­ ments, to no inconsiderable amount.
And the sailors brought it all back, supposing that when they had brought half of it, they would have the rest without being disturbed.
But as soon as they had received it, he ordered them to go back and fetch the rest.
THE Mendeans expended on the regulation of their city the income arising from harbour-dues and other tolls, and they did not exact the tribute arising Of the Men­ deans.
from land and houses, but entered on a register those who had property, and, whenever they wanted money, those who owed it paid it.
They made a profit accordingly during the time which had elapsed, being satisfied with their money for which no interest was paid.
But on making war against Olyn­ thus, and finding themselves in want of money, as they had a stock of slaves, they passed a decree to leave each man a male and female slave, and to sell the rest to the city, so that indi­ viduals might lend out their money to the city at interest.
WHEN the harbour-dues in Macedonia were be­ ing farmed for the most part at twenty talents.
Of Callistratus.
Callistratus caused them to fetch double of that amount;
for as he saw that the rich men always purchased them, because it was necessary to make men worth one talent at least bail for every twenty talents, he issued a proclamation, that any one who wished might become a purchaser, and that bail should be given for a third part only, and at any rate that they severally might be able to obtain.
Of Timotheus.
TIMOTHEUS, an Athenian, making war on the Olyntliians, and being in want of silver, coined some brass money and gave it to the soldiers;
and when the soldiers were indignant, he said that the merchants and petty dealers would all sell to them in the same way as before.
And he proclaimed to the merchants, that if any of them should receive brass money, he should buy with it the marketable produce of the land, and whatever was gathered from the plains;
and that whatever brass money they should have left about them they should bring back to him and take silver instead.
And being at war about Cor­ cyra and finding himself in a strait, as his soldiers began to demand their pay, refusing to obey him, and threatening to go off to the enemy, he convened an assembly, and said that owing to the storms his money could not be sent to him, but that he had such an abundant supply that he would give them the city which had been betrayed, as provisions for three months, free of cost.
And imagining that Timotheus would never pro­ mise them so large a store of money, if he did not really expect that the money would come to him, they said nothing about the pay, until he had arranged matters as he wished.
And besieging Samos, he sold back to the Samians their fruits and what was on their fields, so that he had a plentiful supply of money to pay his soldiers.
And when there was a scarcity of provisions in the camp, owing to the influx of new comers, he forbade them to sell their corn ground, or any measure of it less than a medimnus, or any thing less than a metrete of liquids.
The taxiarchs accordingly, and the captains of com­ panies, bought it wholesale and distributed it to the soldiers, and they came up and carried off with them their provisions;
and whenever they departed back, they sold whatever they had over :
so that it came to pass that the soldiers had a good supply of provisions.

from the enemy s land;
but as he had no money to give them, and he was asked for it at the time when it became due, he made the following contrivance.
He called an assembly and said that he had no lack of money, but that he had it at a certain place, specifying where.
And bar­ nessing his mules, he went towards the spot;
but when he came near to it, and going forward into it, he took out from among the sacred things stored up, all the silver plate that was there, and then went his way having so arranged his mules as if they were really conveying coined silver and exhibiting it.
And when the soldiers saw this, they thought that it was all silver which they were carrying, and took courage as though they were about to gain their pay.
But he said that they must come to Amisus and signify their approval.
Now the journey to Amisus was one of many days and difficult;
so accordingly, during that time he satisfied the army by merely giving them their provisions.
But he him­ self kept in hand the artificers in the camp, and those who traded in any articles of merchandise ;
and no one else was permitted to set himself to any thing of this kind.

dition and was in want of money, to take one of the priests and a quantity of the victims, and to say to the priests that they must be discharged on account of the expense.
And when the priests heard it, each of them wished the victim to be in their own hands, and so they each offered money separately for them­ selves.
And when he had received money from them all, he bade them give them an order, that they should set down to the account of the temple and himself, the tenth part of the expense which they had previously incurred, and to lend the rest to him until the war against the king should be brought to an end.
And he ordered them all to bring in a contribu­ tion from every family, fixing the requisite sum, and likewise a fine upon every head.
And when corn was sold, he ordered that the buyer and seller should deduct from the actual price, and give him an obol out of every artabé, and from the shipping and the manufactories, and from those who had any other employment, he bade that the tenth part should be paid.
And when he was about to lead his army out of the country, if any one chanced to possess any uncoined gold or silver, he ordered him to bring it to him ;
and when most had brought what they had, he bade them make use of it;
but those who lent it he placed together with his captains, so that he could pay them out of the tribute.
Of Iphicrates.
IPIIICRATES an Athenian, when Cotys had col­ lected together some soldiers, furnished him with money as follows.
He bade one of the men over whom he ruled to sow for him some land with three medimni of corn ;
and when this was done, a large store of corn was collected.
Accordingly he brought down his stock to the sea, and gained an abundance of wealth.
Of Cotys.
A THRACIAN, named Cotys, wished to borrow of the Perinthians some money for the purpose of collecting soldiers;
but the Perinthians would not give it to him.
He claimed of them, therefore, at all events to grant, him some men out of the body of citizens as guards for cer­ tain strongholds, that he might be able to make the most out of the soldiers who were then on guard there.
They speedily did so, as they deemed that they would themselves gain the post.
But Cotys having made a garrison with those who were sent out, ordered them to be gone, as soon as they had sent back the money which he had borrowed of them.

who had been placed there by Hermias, where they were to guard them.
And as soon as they were all in good heart, and had got into their houses whatever they had hidden or secretly removed, he seized them, and stripped them of every thing which they possessed.
MEMNON of Rhodes having made himself master Of Memnon.
of Lampsacus, being in want of money, laid upon the richest of the people a certain amount of silver, and said that they might gather it from the rest of the citizens ;
but when the other citizens had given their contributions, he bade them lend him them also, fixing upon a time at which he would restore it back.
And again being in want of money, he ordered them to contribute, saying that they should be repaid out of the tribute;
but they gave in their contributions, considering that the repayment would be speedy;
and when the time came for laying down the money, he said that he had need of this also as well, but that he would hereafter repay them with interest.
And the soldiers who were with him he deprived of their provisions and their pay for six days every year, saying that on these days they need not keep watch, or make any expedition, or incur any expense, meaning the days superfluous in the calendar.
1
And during the previous time he gave to the soldiers their prow visions on the second of the month, thus omitting three days in the former month, and five in the following;
and in this manner he went on until he came to the thirtieth day.
Of Charide­ mus.
CHARIDEMUS of Orus, being in possession of cer­ tain places in ްÆolis, asked for money to pay his soldiers, as Artabazus was leading an army against him.
At first indeed they gave in their contribu­ tions, but afterwards they said that they could do so no longer.
But Charidemus bade the place which he con­ sidered the richest, to send off into another place whatever they possessed in coin or any other valuable property, saying that he would give them an escort;
and further he showed that he was ready to do so.
And when the men were per­ suaded, he led them a little way out of the city, and having inquired how much they had, he took all that he had need of, and sent them back again to the place.
And having issued a proclamation in the cities under his command, that no one should possess in his house any kind of arms, but that if he did so he should pay a specified fine, he disregarded the mat­ ter and made no further concern of it.
And the citizens be­ ginning to think that the proclamation had been made as a dead letter, kept what each of them chanced to have as before.
But on a sudden he' made a search into their houses, and enacted the fine from all those in whose houses he found any arms.
4 Of Philoxenus.
PHILOXENUS a Macedonian, being satrap of Ca­ ria, and being in want of money, said that he was about to celebrate the Dionysia, and appointed as choragi the richest of the Carians, and ordered them to prepare what was necessary.
And when he saw that they bore it ill, he secretly sent some messengers and asked them what they would give to be freed from their liturgy.
But they said that they would give much more than what they thought would be the probable expenditure, in order to be freed from the trouble, and from absence from their property.
And having taken money from these, he fixed on others, until he got from them too what­ ever be wanted ;
and so with each of them he made a profit.
EVÆSES, a Syrian, being Satrap of Egypt, per­ ceiving that the nomarchs were about to revolt Of Evæses.
from him, called them into the palace and hung them all;
and bade the servants tell their relatives that they were in safe keeping.
Each of the relatives accordingly began to collect money for the ransom of each, desiring to redeem the cap­ tives with money.
But he came to an agreement with each, and having received from him the specified sum, gave him back the dead body.
CLEOMENES of Alexandria being Satrap in Egypt, forbade the exportation of corn during a season Of Cleomenes.
of famine, in which other parts suffered severely, and Egypt to a lesser extent.
And as the nomarchs said that they should not be able to pay their tribute, owing to the non­ exportation of corn, he allowed it to be exported, but put a high price upon the supply of food;
so that in the end, though but little was exported, he received a large sum, and the nomarchs themselves were deprived of their excuse.
And as he was sailing through those parts where the cro­ codile is regarded as a god, one of his slaves was seized by the monster.
Accordingly he called the priests together and said, that as he had been injured first, he would punish the crocodiles, and he ordered them to hunt them.
But the priests, fearing that their god would be despised, collected together and gave him as much gold as they were able, and so he desisted from his purpose.
And when king Alex­ ander enjoined upon him to found a city near to Pharos, and there to establish the mart which was hitherto at Can opus, he ailed down to Canopus to the priests and the wealthy indi­ viduals, and said that he had come there for the purpose of removing their settlement.
But the priests and inhabitants contributed to give him a sum of money that he might leave their mart as it was.
He took it and at that time departed, but afterwards, having sailed down, when he had every thing ready for building, he asked them for money to an immense amount:
for that this was the matter which concerned him, whether the mart should be there or not.
And when they said that they could give him nothing, he removed them else­ where.
And having sent a person to purchase something, and perceiving that he had hit upon it very cheap, and was about to reckon it to himself at a very high price, he told the friends of the purchaser that he had heard that he had made his purchase very dear, and so that he would not have any thing to do with it:
and at the same time, with assumed anger, he reproved him for his doltishness.
But, on hearing this, they said that he ought not to believe those who said any thing against him, until he should come before him and render an account himself.
And when the purchaser came, they told him what they had heard from Cleomenes ;
and wishing to show them and Cleomenes what he had done, he brought back the money with which he had made the pur­ chase.
And when corn was being sold in the country for ten drachmae, he called the corn-factors to him, and asked them on what terms they would negociate with him;
and they said that they would sell to him for less than the price at which they sold to the merchants.
But he ordered them to give him corn at the same price as they sold to others, and then sold it himself, fixing the price at thirty-two drachmas.
He also called the priests together, and said, that the expenditure upon the temples in the country was too great:
and that con­ sequently the greater part of the temples and of the priests must be put down.
But the priests, both singly and collec­ tively, gave him the sacred treasures, fancying that this was what he was about to take, and each wishing that his own temple should remain as it was before, and that he should himself be continued in the office of a priest.
Of Antimenes.
ANTIMENES of Rhodes being intrusted by Alex­ ander with the charge of the roads about Babylon, thus collected money.
There was an ancient law in Babylon, that a tenth part should be paid on all imports ;
and no one had enforced this law.
Accordingly he watched the time when all the satraps and the soldiers were expected, and se­ veral legates and artificers bringing others with them, and journeying from home on their own account, and when many gifts were likely to be brought, and then he exacted a tenth part according to the established law.
And when again he was seeking to provide money, he ordered every one who pleased to enter the names of the slaves in the army at such a price as he chose, and that they should pay him eight drachm æ a year;
and if the slave should run away, he promised that the value enrolled upon the slave should be restored then .
Accordingly, a great body of slaves were enrolled, and he gained a considerable sum of money.
But if any slave ran away, he used to order the satrap of the part in which the camp stood, either to recover him, or pay the amount to the owner.
OPHELES, an Olynthian, having established a pro­ curator over the district of Arthriditis, when the Of Opheles.
nomarchs of that region came to him and said that they wished to pay him a larger tribute, and entreated him to dismiss their present procurator, asked them whether they would be able to pay what they promised ;
and when they said that they could pay, he left the procurator where he was, and bade him exact from them the whole amount of tribute at which they had as­ sessed themselves.
He did not think it right to disgrace the magistrate whom he had set over them, nor to lay on them a heavier tribute than they had themselves fixed ;
but he col­ lected a far larger sum of money.
PYTIIOCLES, an Athenian, advised the Athenians that the city should take out of private bands the Of Pythocles.
lead which came from Tyre at 2 drachmas, the price at which they sold it, and then to sell it themselves, fixing its price at 6 drachmae.
CHABRIAS, having manned one hundred and twenty vessels, while Taos had need of only sixty, Of Chabrias.
ordered the companies of the sixty vessels which would re­ main behind, to supply two months' provisions to the crews who sailed, or else to go on the expedition themselves.
But as they wished to remain behind and take care of their own property, they did as he ordered.
Of Artimenes.
ARTIMENES ordered the satraps to fill up the trea­ sures which lay along the royal highways accord­ ing to the custom of the country;
and whenever the army or any other company passed by, even without the king, he sent some one of his retinue and sold the contents of the stores.
Of Cleomenes.
WHEN the new moon came, and it was full time to give the soldiers their rations, Cleomenes pur­ posely went on board his ship;
and as the month went on, he disembarked and distributed the rations, and then on the following month he deferred giving the rations until the next new moon.
The soldiers accordingly kept themselves quiet, owing to having recently received their provisions ;
while he omitted one month in every year, and so continually deprived his soldiers of a month's pay.
Of Stabelbius.
STABELBIUS,1 (king) of the Mysians, when he owed his soldiers pay, having called together the generals, told them that he had no need of the private soldiers ;
but giving money to each of the generals, he said that when­ ever he should be in want of privates, he would send them to collect mercenaries, saying that he would more gladly pay to the generals the money which was due to them.
He ordered them therefore each to dismiss his own company from out ofthe country.
The generals accordingly supposing that they would have an opportunity of making money, sent the soldiers away as he ordered.
And after a brief interval, and having collected them together, he said that neither a flute-player without a chorus, nor a general without private soldiers, was of any service;
accordingly he bade them depart from the country.

dered them to pour out a draught for good luck, and to carry them away;
and if any of the statues held forward a cup in its hand, he would say, "I pledge you," and bid them to re­ move it.
And the gilded garments and the crowns he stripped from off the shrines, saying that he would give them others, lighter and more fragrant;
and then he clothed them with white robes and crowns made of white poplar.
THE passage of Plato here referred to by Aristotle, occurs in book viii.
chap. 3, and is thus rendered in Mr. Burges's recent translation. "
It is hard indeed for a state thus constituted to become disturbed ;
but as every thing generated is liable to corruption, even such a constitution as this cannot abide for ever, but must be dissolved;
and its dissolution is as follows.
Not only as regards terrestrial plants, but likewise terrestrial animals, a fertility and sterility both of soul and body take place;
when the revolutions of the heavenly bodies complete the periphery of their respective orbits, which are shorter to the shorter lived, and contrariwise to the contrary;
and with reference to the fertility and sterility of your race, though t>hose are wise whom you have trained as governors of the state, yet they will never, by intellect and sense united, observe the pro­ per season for procreation, but let it slip by, and sometimes generate children when they ought not.
To that, however, which is divinely ge­ nerated, there is a period which is comprehended by the perfect number ;
whereas, to that generated by man, there is one, in which the augmentations of the surpassing and surpassed, after having received three separations and four boundaries of things similar and dissimilar, increasing and de­ creasing, will render all things correspondent and rational;
of which the sesquiternian root conjoined with the pentad, and thrice increased, affords two harmonies;
one of these, the equally equal, just a hundred times as much ;
while the other, of equal length indeed, but of oblong shape, is of a hundred numbers from enable diameters of the pentad, each wanting one, two of which are irrational, and of a hundred cubes of the triad.
And the whole of this geometric number, having such an influence, is concerned with worse and better generations.
Now, if our governors be ignorant of this, and join our couples together unseasonably, the children will neither possess talent nor be fortunate either."
Air.
Burges remarks in a note that this passage of Plato, descriptive of the geometric or fatal number, has baffled the ingenuity of every commentator;
but he gives, in an appendix at the end of his volume, the views of Baroccius, Schneider, and others, at the same time pronouncing them one and all to be most unsatisfactory.
We may observe that the passage of Aristotle which we have before us, though involving a most obscure quotation from Plato, is passed over without note or comment (as hopeless) by Sylburgius in his edition of the Politics (Oxford, 1810) ;
but Lambinus translates it thus, " Horum autem esse principium ea quorum radix sesquitertia numero quinario juncta, duos concentus efficit:
quod futurum est, (inquit) cum hujus descriptae figures numerus solidus fact-as fuerit, proinde quasi natura males homines, et nullâ disciplinâ sanabiles, aliquando gignat.”
Taylor translates it nearly as I have done in the text.
Mr. Burges tells us that "Baroccius considers the sesquitertian progeny (ἐπίτϱιτος ἐπυθμήν), to be a root or prime number, and fixes on the number seven as its representa­ tive (4 + 3 = 7).
Further, by the two harmonies, he (Baroccius) sup­ poses Plato to mean the connexion between the square and cube of twelve, -which is itself made up of seven and five, (ἐπίτϱιτος πυθμὴν πεμπάδι συξυγεὶς)—i.e. 144 and 1728—twelve being a number often mentioned by Plato as not only perfect, but the type of perfection.
If this be granted, the geometric, or perfect, or fatal number may be considered to be 1728, the cube of 12.
This opinion, however, is opposed by Schneider, who conceives it to be 216, i. e. 63, which is made up of three other cubes, viz. 27, 64, and 125, i. e. 33, 43, and 53.
Others again have considered the root to be 9, the cube-root of 729.
"Taylor takes a different view of the matter;
and I have thought it best to give here a large portion of his note entire. "
By the sesquitertian progeny, Plato means the number 95 ;
for this number is composed of the addition of the squares of the numbers 4 and 3, which form the first sesquitertian ratio, (viz. 25,) and the number 70, which is composed of 40 and 30, and therefore consists of two numbers in a sesquitertian ratio.
This number conjoined with 5, and thrice increased, produces ten thousand and a million.
For 100 X 100 = 10,000, and 10,000 X 100 = 1,000,000.
But it must here be observed, that these two numbers ... appear to be considered by Plato as analogous to two parallelopipedons;
the former, namely, ten thou­ sand, being formed out of 10 X 10 X 100, and the latter, a million, from 1000 X 10 X 100.
These two numbers are called by Plato ' two harmonies,' for the following reason:
Simplicius, in his Commentary on Aristotle's book De Cœlo, informs us that a cube among the Pythagoreans was de.
nominated ‘harmony,' because it consists of 12 bounding lines, 8 angles, and 6 sides ;
and 12, 8, and 6 are in harmonic proportion.
For the dif­ ference between 12 and 8 is to the difference between 8 and 6, i. e. 4 is to 2, as the first term is to the third, viz.
as 12 is to 6 ;
which, as is well known, is the law of harmonic proportion.
As a parallelopipedon, there­ fore, has the same number of sides, angles, and bounding lines as a cube, the reason is obvious why the numbers 10,000 and 100,000 are called by Plato harmonies.
Hence, also, it is evident why he says that the other of these harmonies, viz.
a million, is of equal length indeed, but more oblong:
for if we call 100 the breadth and 10 the depth, both of 10,000 and 1,000,000, it is evident, that the latter number, when considered as produced by 1000 X 10 X 100, will be analogous to a more oblong parallelopipedon than the former."
Again, when he says that the number 1,000,000 consists of a hundred numbers from enable numbers of pentads, each being deficient by unity, and from two that are ineffable, and from a hundred cubes of the triad, his meaning is as follows.
The number 1,000,000 consists of a hundred numbers, i. e. of a hundred such numbers as 10,000, each of which is composed from enable diameters of pentads, etc.
But in order to under­ stand the truth of this assertion, it is necessary to understand that there are certain numbers which are called by arithmeticians enable dia­ meters.
These, also, are two-fold;
for some are the diameters of even squares, and others of odd squares.
And the diameters of enable even squares, when multiplied into themselves, produce square numbers double of the squares of which they are the diameters with an excess of unity.
Thus for instance, the number 3 multiplied into itself pro­ duces 9, which is double of the square number 4 with an excess of unity, and therefore 3 will be the diameter of the even square 4.
But the diameters of enable odd square numbers are in power double of the squares of which they are diameters by a deficiency of unity.
Thus, the number 7, multiplied into itself, produces 49, which is double of the odd square number 25 by a deficiency of unity.
This being premised, it follows that the number 10,000 will consist of a certain number of heptads;
for 7 is the enable diameter of the square number 25;
and from what follows, it will be found that this number is 1386.
"But the number 10,000 not only consists of 1386 heptads, but Plato also adds, ' from two numbers that are ineffable;
' viz.
from two num­ bers the roots of which cannot be exactly obtained or expressed either in whole numbers or in fractions, such as the roots of the numbers 2 and 3.
The numbers 15 and 13 also are of this kind.
and appear to be the num­ bers signified by Plato.
In the last place he adds, ' and from 100 cubes of the triad,' viz.
from the number 270;
for this is equal to a hundred times 27, the cube of 3.
The numbers then which form 10,000 are as below.
viz. 1386 heptads, two ineffable numbers, (15 and 13,) and a hundred times the cube of 3, (270);
and so the whole geometric number is 1,000,000."
But in asserting that 270 is a hundred times the cube of 3, Taylor is obviously at fault;
for the cube of 3 is 27, and this number multiplied by 100 becomes 2700, not 270.
Unless, then, some error lies in the text of Plato, (which is hinted in no edition of the Republic that I have been able to consult,) this one mistake is fatal to Taylor's theory.
It is quite clear that he has chosen a million as the perfect number quite arbitrarily;
and that in order to make his figures come right, he has done his sum backwards, taking 1386, as being the 7th part of the excess of 10,000 above 298.
It is curious, however, that 1386, as well as 9702, is divisible by 7.
While so little certain information concerning the Pythagorean num­ bers has been handed down to us, or been discovered by the re­ searches of antiquarians and mathematicians, it is impossible to pronounce a decisive opinion upon the main difficulty in the text of Aristotle, who of course is borrowing the language of Plato, inherited by him again from the old Pythagorean school of philosophy.
For further information the reader will do well to consult Taylor's note on the fifth book of the Politics, and the references given by Air.

His passion at this time was for Aristotle those who knew him will bear witness how deeply he was imbued with Aristotle's language and ideas;
how, in earnest and unreserved conversation, or in writing, his train of thoughts was affected by them-how he cited the maxims of the Stagirite as oracles, and how his language was racily pointed with phrases from him.
I never knew a man who made such familiar, even fond, use of an author-and when he was selecting his son's university, with much leaning for Cambridge, and many things which made him incline against Oxford, Aristotle turned the scale." ' I would not consent,' said he, ' to send my son to a university where he would lose the study of him.'"
'You may believe,' he said, with regard to the London University, ' that I have not forgotten the dear old Stagirite in our examinations, and I hope he will be construed and discussed in Somerset House as well as in the schools.'""
I am getting pretty well to understand the history of the Roman kings, and to commence writing.
One of my most useful books is dear old Tottle's (Aristotle's)
Politics, which give one so full a notion of the state of society and opinions in old times, that, by their aid, one can pick out the wheat from the chaff in Livy with great success.""
It is just as impossible for a man to understand the questions which are now so much agitated of Church authority and Church government, without a knowledge of the great questions of law and government, as it is to understand any matter avowedly political:
and therefore the Polities of Aristotle are to me of a very great and direct use every day of my life."
