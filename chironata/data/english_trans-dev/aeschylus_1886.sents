399IN order to appreciate the poetry of antiquity, it is necessary to take into consideration the religious ideas which lie at its root, which also in the course of their development have determined the character alike of ancient literature and art;
when we consider, moreover, the immense influence which the stream of Aryan thought, by its interfusion with Christianity, has exerted over the culture of the Western world, a new and twofold interest attaches to each of the great master-works of classical antiquity, as exhibiting not only the level which the religious thought of the age had already reached, but also as indicating the direc­ tion of its future development.
Accordingly, in offering to the public a new version of the Oresteia, the only complete trilogy which has escaped the wreck of time, it may not be altogether irrelevant if I endeavour to determine the position of Æsehylus among those kindlers of the beacon-fire, through whose agency the light of ancient wisdom was transmitted from age to age before the advent of Christianity.
With this view it will be necessary to give a sketch (necessarily very meagre and imperfect) of the progress of religious thought, both before and after his appear­ ance on the stage of history, and as art has its root in the religious nature of man, we shall thus obtain a key to tho three great epochs which mark the artistic development of humanity, which havo been charac­ terized as the Symbolical, the Classical, and tho Romantic eras.
When the rays of tradition first dawn upon our planet, we discover tho primeval ancestors of tho Aryan race, before their dispersion from their common home, still gazing with awe and wonder upon tho working of the vast nature-powers by which they were environed.
While led through tho religious instincts implanted in human nature to recognize tho existence of a Being or Eeings who hear and answer prayer, they wero unable to separate tho idea of mind, as a causal power, from the aspects of external nature.
Accordingly, tho shadowy divinities of tho Vedic Pantheon, Indra, Agni, Varuna, can hardly be regarded as distinct personalities, holding definito relations to each other, or to their worshippers.
As in tho fluctu­ ating scenery of the diurnal drama the sun is obscured by clouds, which in their turn arc scattered and anon collected again, so these deified impersonations of physical phenomena loom dimly before our mental vision, each supreme and absolute in turn;
nor is it easy to determine whether behind theso Innumerable divinities, tho conception of One infinite Spirit had yet dawnedupon the Aryan mind.
The deities of the Vedas vanish from our gaze, lost "
In the deep backward and abysm of time.
"After the lapse of ages they reappear upon the stage,.
so modified, however, that it is difficult to recognize their identity:
on the southern side of the Himalayahs they assume the form of the great Brahminical trinity, Vishnu, Brahma, and Siva, emerging from a back­ ground of Pantheism;
while in Greece we behold them metamorphosed into the hierarchy of the Olympian gods.
So striking is the contrast between the deities apostrophized by the Vedic bards, and the grand impersonations of Grecian poetry and art, that without conclusive evidence the connection between them could hardly be recognized.
This evidence is twofold ;
-in the first place, comparative philology reveals the fact that the sacred names of the Greek Pantheon are in the Vedas intelligible words, expres­ sive of natural phenomena ;
while in the Iliad we are introduced to the Olympian deities during the process of transformation;
we detect their forms gradually dis­ engaging themselves from the physical phenomena with which they were associated, of which also they may be regarded as the spiritual but almost impalpable essence.
This transformation of physical into humanized deities has been compared by Welclier to the myste­ rious process by which the chrysalis passes into its more perfect form.
" The Nature-god," he says, " became enveloped in a web of mythical fable, and emerged as a divine, humanized personality."
For the principle which lies at the root of this meta­ morphosis, he points to the gradual development of human nature, to the growing consciousness of free­ will, accompanied by the recognition of mind as a higher manifestation of deity than any material pheno­ mena, and consequently of man as the true Shekinah.
As, however, in the earlier Vedic worship men were unable to separate the idea of mind, as a causal power, from tho varied aspects of external nature, so, when they began to direct their thoughts within, they were equally embarrassed to distinguish between tho divine and human elements in the soul of man.
Every inward movement which appeared at all exceptional was ascribed to the prompting of a deity;
not only were tho nobler emotions of courage and self-restraint referred to divine inspiration (of which in the Iliad wo find innumerable examples), but tho gods are also represented as the authors of delusion (ii. 8, xxii. 24) and treachery (iv. 93), as when Zeus sends tho deceitful dream to Agamemnon, and Athena prompts Pandarus to violate tho treaty.
One of the most noteworthy instances to this perplexity is found in Agamemnon's exculpation of himself touching tho outrage upon Achilles (xix. 85) :
"I am not guilty, Jove and Fate | and the dusk-roaming Fury­ 'Tis these who in assembly fir'd | my breast with savage frenzy." *
A plea, the justice of which is admitted by Achilles, who echoes the sentiment of Agamemnon :
"0 Father Jove, great frenesies I to men thou truly sendest."
Moreover, on the first transference of human passion and emotion, together with the conditions of human existence, to the super-mundane sphere, the very con­ ception of divine existence, as absolved from restraint, would lead to the deification of human infirmity to­ gether with the higher attributes of humanity :
of this we have a memorable example in the character of the Homeric Zeus.
This tendency would doubtless be accelerated by the phenomena expounded by Prof. Max Muller, in his " Lectures on Language."
As the several branches of the Aryan stock dispersed, migrating from their common home in Central Asia, the original signification of words was forgotten or obscured;
and thus, language originally descriptive of natural pheno­ mena became transferred to the conditions of human life-a translation which totally metamorphosed the character of the occurrence.
The transference of human faith and worship from the vague nature-powers of the Vedas to the humanized deities of Olympus, together with the association of the latter into a celestial hierarchy, under the supre­ macy of Zeus, assumed in Grecian mythology the form of a revolution, and was symbolized under the grand old allegory of the battle between the Titans and the Olympian gods.
This revolution, involving a variety of complex phenomena, especially the fusion of the mythology of different tribes or nations into one, was doubtless accomplished in its main features in tho ages anterior to Homer.
However, as we have no Grecian literature to illus­ trate this period, we are unable to trace the history of tho transition, nor can we determine how far the current mythology of his age was modified by the individual genius of the great epic bard, whoso immortal work, while inaugurating a new epoch in the history of civilization, at tho same time exhibits, as has been truly said, the last lingering traces of the primeval age.
A superficial acquaintance with the Iliad suffices to reveal the original elemental character of the Homeric divinities, a fact which would bo more generally recognized, were we not accustomed to carry to the perusal of the earlier poet the conceptions derived from the artistic impersonations of a later age.
This transitional character of the Homeric mythology will be more apparent if wo carry back to their original root in natural phenomena a few of tho Olympian divinities, and then follow tho process of their develop­ ment, as they appear successively in the Iliad and in the Orosteia.
The connection between Jupiter and tho sky, familiar to Greek and Latin scholars, may bo traced down to tho latest period of classical poetry;
so Horaco—" Manct sub Jovo frigido venator."
It was reserved, however, for tho science of comparative philology to point out tho origin of this connection.
Thus wo learn that " Zeus, tho most sacred name in Greek mythology is tho same word as Dyaus in Sanscrit, which means the sky;
and that originally Dyu was the bright heavenly deity in India, as well as in Greece.
"It is remarked by Welcker, that " the greatest fact, when we go back to the highest Grecian antiquity, is the idea of God, as the Supreme Being, associated with a nature-worship, never entirely suppressed, together with the conception of a divine family derived from Zeus.
"Accordingly, we recognize in the Homeric Zeus three distinct elements, the divine, the physical, and the human, welded together into an artificial unity, and exhibiting a character of marvellous incongruity, en­ dowed with attributes the most inconsistent and con­ tradictory.
Thus, in not a few passages, he is re­ presented as the supreme deity­"
Who reigneth mighty over all, both mortals and immortals." (II. xii. 242.) "
Whose decree, once sanctioned by the nod, is neither deceptive, nor re­ vokable." (II. i. 527.) " The Counsellor, greatest and best;
Father of gods and men;
the Guardian of the oath." (iv. 235.)
"The Vindicator of righteous law." (xxi. 337.)
The High Arbiter of war." (xix. 224.)
His superiority over the other gods is forcibly brought out in the beginning of the 8th book (18—27,) where the other dwellers in Olympus are invited to grasp the golden chain dropped from Heaven's heights, and held immovably in the hand of Zeus :
"
Lay hold, and throw your force on it, all gods both male and female, Yet never shall ye. down to earth, drag from the lofty heaven Zeus the supreme deviser.
"
*It is as the god of compassion that the diviner aspect of his character is the most conspicuous (ix. 502):
when we consider the savagery of an age in which human victims were sacrificed to appease the 'Manes of the dead, and where tendencies to cannibalism may perhaps be detected (iv. 35), (xxii. 345), (xxiv. 212), the prominence given to compassion as an attri­ bute of the supreme Deity is very remarkable.
Notwithstanding these high attributes, no exercise of providential power is ever assigned to the Homeric Zeus;
ho is beguiled by Hera, yet swayed by her counsel (xvi. 460), and though desirous to save Ilium, yet, at her entreaty, ho surrenders it to destruction (iv. 43).
Like the heavens, now bright with sunshine, and anon dark with storm, he exhibits all the capricious fluctuations of an elemental power, being alternately malignant and benign, without any apparent motive beyond his own caprice, uninfluenced by moral con­ siderations.
Then, again, with regard to his supre­ macy, not only is it questioned by Poseidon (xv. 1S5), it is actually imperilled by that deity, in conjunction with Hera aud Athena (i. 306—100), and is only rescued from their machinations by the intervention of Driarcus.
These legends probably symbolize convulsions of the elements, which threaten to blot out the sky, of which Zeus is the impersonation.
In this character, as an elemental god, he is not only the father of rivers, he also presides over all meteorological pheno­ mena.
Thus with his AEgis, the dark storm-cloud, he veils the summit of Mount Ida (xvii. 593), and even ocean shudders at his dreadful bolt.
He rains (xii. 5).
He snows (xii. 280).
He deviseth hail and piercing sleet, and rainy flood (x. 5).
He uproots the sturdy oak (xiv. 415), and he snaps the bow-string of Teucer (xv. 469).
Occasionally the moral and physical elements are most curiously blended, as in the elaborate descrip­ tion of the rain deluge with which he punishes the crooked verdict of the unjust judge (xvi. 385).
Many other passages of a similar character might be cited.
But it is in his relation with Hera, and the various heroines who are represented as the objects of his love, that the human element in the conception of the Homeric Zeus appears under its most revolting aspect.
His character has accordingly been described as the most repulsive in the whole circle of Olympian life, exhibiting the very temper of the most advanced depravity.* “ It is the Jupiter of Homer in whom we see first the most complete surrender of personal morality and self-government to mere appetite, and the most thoroughly selfish groundwork of character.
Abandonment to gross passion, ungovernable self­ indulgence rises to its climax in him.
"We seem to inhale a purer atmosphere when, by the aid of comparative philology, we are enabled to trans­ late back into natural phenomena occurrences which, when transferred to the sphere of human life, are repulsive and revolting.
Thus it is not difficult to recognize the physical idea which underlies the con­ ception of Hera, whose name-derived, according to Welckcr, from ε̌ρα,* the earth-sufficiently indicates the original conception symbolized by her marriage with Zeus, the sky.
Ge, the earth, is invoked in the Iliad, with Zeus and other divinities (ii. 277;
six. 258).
Of the three goddesses, Hera, Diono, and Demeter, in whom the primeval goddess reappears mythically metamorphosed (who also originally held tho samo relation to Zeus as seen on ancient coins), Hera is alone distinguished in tho Hiad as the Queen of Heaven, whilo Demeter, without Divino significance, is alluded to in connection with agricultural pursuits (xiii. 322 ;
v. 500), and Dione appears as tho mother of Aphrodite (v. 370).
It was through the Archæan race that Hera acquired her high position in the Olympian theogony :
among a warlike people, who abandoned agriculture to their dependants, the physical attributes of the goddess were gradually obscured, and accordingly we find her in the Iliad as the peculiar patroness of Achilles, chief of the battle-loving myrmidons (i. 208;
ix. 254).
Though the physical attributes of Hera are almost entirely suppressed in the Iliad, we trace a curious lingering of the nature element in the Thcogamia, described with such luxuriance of imagery in the 14th book (345- 351) :
"
As the story of the Olympian Father descend­ ing as golden rain into the prison of Danaï was meant for the bright sky, delivering earth from the bonds of winter ;
”so the union of Zeus and Hera, shrouded in golden mist, doubtless typified the same natural pheno­ menon, followed as it was by a new outgrowth of tender herbage, " the lotus, the crocus, and the hya­ cinth."
A similar remnant of natural symbolism might probably be detected in other Homeric legends, which in their human aspect are puerile and revolting :
as when the refractory spouse of Zeus hangs suspended by a golden chain, a pair of anvils attached to her ankles (xv. 19).
How far Homer recognized the original significance of these legends is an interesting but still unsettled question.
—Müller (Prol. 279).
If from the thundering, cloud-compelling Zeus of the Iliad, we turn to the Zeus of the Oresteia, the contrast is so remarkable, that it would almost appear as if the great dramatist, by the very emphasis with which he brings out the providential charact r of the Supreme Ruler, desired, like his contemporary, Pindar, to enter his protest against the unworthy conception of the Epic bard.
This hypothesis seems the more plausible when we consider that the age of Æsehylus immediately succeeded that of Pisistratus, who had given his sanction to the enactments of Solon, " by which the Hiad was raised into a liturgy, periodically rehearsed by Jaw at the preatest of the Athenian fes­ tivals;
” ., exhibiting for the first and last time in-the history of the world the preservation of a poet's com­ positions made an object of permanent public policy.
"Accordingly, in the opening chorus of the Agamem­ non, Zens is represented as conducting in person tho grand judicial retribution which, in consequence of the crime of Paris, involves Ilium in ruin.
In the second chorus this providential action of Zeus is brought out with even stronger emphasis;
he is there represented as having with prescient might foreordained the blow which fell at length in accomplishment of his decree.
The mighty net of Divine retribution is cast over the devoted city, and the character of Zeus is vindi­ cated as the righteous governor of men.
So again in the third chorus, it is Zeus, protector of the guest, who sends Helen, a fury fraught with destruction, to avenge on the sons of Priam the violated rights of hospitality ;
and whereas, in the Iliad, there is division in heaven, the deities, swayed by motives purely personal, and often of the lowest character (xxiv. 30 ;
iv. -18), take part in the quarrel, and appear arrayed against one.
another in the hostile ranks ;
—in tho Orestein, on tho contrary, they arn represented as leagued with Zeus in cari ying out the great, euds of justice.
Thus, when the cause is brought before the celestial tribunal, “ without dissentient voice they cast their votes into the bloody urn, sealing the doom of Troy." (Ag. 789.)
Zeus is not only represented as exercising supreme authority in the moral government of mankiud­ “In will, in deed, Sole cause, sole fashioner" (Ag. 1462);
he also acts inwardly on the souls of men :
it is Zeus whose highest gift is an untainted mind (Ag. 900);
who leads men to wisdom through suffering (Ag. 169);
a function in which he is aided by the subordinate deities (Ag. 175), who are represented as the exponents of his will.
(Eum. 588.)
In the Suppliants, together with a curious lingering of the 'mythological element;
we find the grandest ascriptions of omnipotence to the Olympian king.
Thus, he is invoked as "
King of kings, most blessed of the blest, among the Perfect, Power most perfect, Zeus, supreme in bliss! " (Sup. 518.)
He is charac­ terized as "Mighty Zeus, Protector of the guest, the Highest, who directs Destiny by hoary law." (Sup. 655.) "Zeus, Lord of ceaseless time" (Sup. 567), "almighty Ruler of the earth." (Sup. 795.)
He is likewise apostrophized -as the great Artificer, supreme Ruler, who knows no superior, whose deed is prompt as his word to execute the designs of his deep-counsel­ ling mind.
(Sup, 587.)
Thus the mythological vesture, woven of Nature and Humanity, which had well-nigh shrouded the grander features of the Homeric Zeus, is partially withdrawn in Æschylus, and we behold a Being whom men could worship without degradation, till in the fullness of time the light of celestial Truth burst with clear effulgence on the heathen world.
We can hardly imagine that the capricious elemental deity of the Iliad should have been metamorphose into the venerable deity of the Oresteia by the blow process of spiritual development alone, without the action of external agency :
if we consider the affinity between the Hellenic and the Persian races, and the close contact into which they were brought in Asia Minor, the modification of Grecian thought by the interfusion of Persian elements will not appear re­ markable.
In support of this hypothesis, I might appeal not only to the high spiritual character attri­ buted to Ahura-Mazda, the Zeus of the Zend-Avesta, but also to the sharp contrast there exhibited between the principles of Good and Evil, a feature which strikingly distinguishes the thcogony of Æschylus from that of flower.
The relics of ancient sun-worship which arc dis covered in various localities of Greece bear witness to the vast influenco exerted by the celestial luminary over the imaginations and the religious emotions of the primeval world, an influence which is also attested by the numerous divinities in whom the Sun-god reappears, mythically metamorphosed .
Helios, in tho Hiad, is characterizel as " the Unwenriablo ;
" " the Brings of light like Mithra, who has a thousand ears and ten thousand eyes,‟He overseeth all, and hearkeneth to all things " (nii. 277).
On the reconcilintion of Aga­ memnon and Ach hes, a boar is sacrificed to Helios and to Zeus (xix. 197).
The Trojans sacrifice to the Earth and to Helios, the Achæans to Zens (iii. 104).
In the opening chorus of the Agamemnon, the ancient Arcadian Suu-god, Pan,* whose name is not mentioned in the Iliad, is associated with Zeus and Apollo, as sending the Fury to punish crime.
The original charac­ ter of this divinity, who with Zeus and Apollo shares the epithet Lykeios, is betrayed by many significant symbols, associated with his effigies and his worship.
Among the various impersonations of the Sun, how­ ever, there is none which can compare in interest and significance with Dionysos and Apollo, both solar divinities, whose worship, nevertheless, offers many remarkable points of opposition and contact.
The celestial luminary was imagined to sleep during the winter and to awake to consciousness in spring ;
accordingly Dionysos, rising from the sea at the vernal equinox to inaugurate the new solar year, was hailed with transports of joy by his enthusiastic votaries.
The fluctuating character of Dionysos reminds us of the nature deities of the Vedas;
Proteus-like, he assumes every variety of form and age ;
he is the god of summer and of winter, of darkness and of light;
he holds in his hand the inebriating chalice, together with the cosmical mirror, exhibiting the images of all things.
His worship is of peculiar interest, from its association with the Greek drama.
Grecian tragedy, as is well known, was an expansion of the choruses chanted at the Dionysic festivals, which rehearsed the vicissitudes of the solar god, in his progress through the heavenly signs.
This circumstance exerted " an overruling effect upon the quality of the Athenian drama;
" ‟ from this early cradle of tragedy arose a sanctity which compelled all things to modulate into the same religious key.
"
*Peculiar interest moreover attaches to Dionysos, from his association with the mysteries which exerted so powerful an influence over the Grecian mind.
The story of Dionysos, embodying some of the main features of his worship, appears in the Iliad (vi. 132), invested, however, with ethical, not religious signifi­ cance.
‟It is a remarkable circumstance that pre­ cisely those divinities, Demeter and Dionysos, whose truly religious influence was most profound and pervading in Greece, arc all but unmentioned in Homer, and may be said, in fact, to bo excluded from his scheme of the divine commnnity.”†
An interesting question arises as to the cause of this omission on the part of the great epic bard.
Are wo to Imagine that the peculiar sanctity which attached to these divinities induced him deliberately to avoid the subject;
or must wo conclude that in the Homeric ago their worship had not yet assumed that mysterious and impressive character which subsequently distinguished it?
I confess I am unablo to decide the question, but incline to the Liter hypothesis.
The original solar signification of Apollo is main­ tained among other eminent scholars by Creuzer, Welcker, and Gerhard, who appeal alike to ancient monuments and coins, and to vestiges of ancient Sun- worship found in various localities in Greece. "
If we desire," says Creuzer, ‟ in studying Greek mythology, to reach its ultimate roots, we must explore the ancient literatures of Persia and India.
If from this point of view we investigate the original identity of the Sun- god and Apollo, we shall find in the figurative language of the Vedas the primitive occasion of the transition from the former to the latter.
"One of the most striking features of the ancient Sun- worship was its dualistic character, founded upon the twofold aspect of the solar luminary, as at the same time a beneficent and a destroying power, as conquer­ ing and conquered, as dying, yet endowed with ever­ renovated life ;
a conception which explains the enigma said to be uttered by the oracle of Apollo at Glares, in Ionia, “I am Jupiter Ammon in Spring, and black Pluto in Winter."
In order to understand the more terrible aspects of the ancient Sun-god, we have only to remember the annual fevers occasioned by his scorching rays, and the danger of famine from failure of the crops :
after the lightning of Zeus, there was no natural agent so destructive as the arrow of Helios ;
as calamity, moreover, was regarded in ancient times as the expression of Divine anger, expiatory and peniten­ tial rites formed an essential element of the ancient Sun-worship.
This twofold aspect of Helios finds expression also in the namo of the latter Sun-god, Apollo, which, in the ancient Doric Æolian form, was not ’Απόλλων, the Destroyer, but ’Απελλων, the Averter.
It is under his darker aspect "as the Minister of Vengeance, and the Chastiser of Arrogance," that he appears for the most part in the poetry of Homer. "
His punishments arc pestilence and death "Achilles, to whom he is particularly hostile, calls him the most pernicious of all the gods.
"
*While tho Homeric Apollo, in his relation with mortals, appears thus in the light of a malevolent and destroying power, among the Olympians ho is introduced in association with the Muses, as the god of Music, charming the assembled deities with his harp (i. 603).
The notion that the stars and tho other heavenly bodies accomplished their­ revolutions to the sound of music is expressed in tho ancient poetry of India, and also in that of the Persians.
As the rhythm of the cosmical movements depended upon the solar luminary, the great orderer of times and seasons, it is not surprising that from tho most remote antiquity the Sun god was represented as playing on the cithara;
in this character ho is portrayed on the oldest Archaie vases, encireled by tho dancing hours.
Although in the Oresteia Apollo is introduced inci­ dentally as a destroying and avenging deity, as in tho passage already quoted in tho 1st Chorus of tho Agamemnon, and also where ho is invoked by Cassandra as her destroyer (1047), he nevertheless wears, for the most part, a more benignant aspect.
He is emphatically the Healer, the Prophet-leech, who purifies from all defilement (Eum. 62);
the god of joy, whom it befits not to invoke with words of sorrow (Ag. 1056):
the most striking point of divergence from the Homeric conception of Apollo is to be found in his relation to Zeus, with whom he appears in the most intimate association.
As the god of prophecy, the guardian of the sacred oracles, he declares most emphatically that he is simply the expounder of his father's will, and consequently that he cannot lie.
(Eum. 585, 588.)
It is under this aspect, as the god of Truth, that a deep significance attaches to the func­ tion which he assumes in the court of Areopagus as Exegetes, or expounder of the unwritten law.
‟ At Athens, the Exegetæ, who presided over the purification of blood-guilty persons, were elected, or at least their election was ratified, by the Delphic Oracle."*
In this character, Apollo appears before the Areopagites, to expound the law in relation to homicide, and thus the deep-thoughted poet enforces the important principle that the judicial proceedings of human tribunals must be under the presidency of Truth.
According to Welcker, however, the Moon appears of all natural objects to have been the most universally adored.
Several tribes in Africa and America are said at the present day to worship the moon without the sun, while no nation has been known to whom the sun is sacred without the moon.
In primeval ages the computations of time were based upon the changes of the moon, which accordingly in the Indo-Germanic languages is known as ‟
The Measurer;
" and so deeply did the lunar phenomena appeal to tho religious emotions of humanity, that among all early nations, as well as among the Jews, the new-moon festivals were celebrated with peculiar solemnity.
In warm climates, moreover, vegetation is nourished almost entirely by the dew, which falls most copiously when the moon is full;
hence Selene was early characterized as the mother of Horse, the Bringer of the Dew.
It would be very interesting to trace tho various media of tran­ sition by which the bright nocturnal luminary was gradually metamorphosed into the Huntress Diana— ‟
Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste, Who set at nought the frivolous bolts of Cupid."
So great, however, is tho diversity of form under which the Moon-goddess has been conceived, exhibiting a different physiognomy in every different locality, ac­ cording to tho varied aspect under which sho has been regarded, that I must content myself with a brief notice of her characteristics, as sho appears in tho Iliad and the Orestein.
To tho goddess of tho green-wood and tho glado belonged of right all animals both taIo and wild ;
accordingly sho is characterized in tho Iliad as (πότνια θηρω̂ν), “ Queen of all Venison " (xxi. 470), and in the Agamemnon she is represented as taking under her especial care­ "
The tender whelps, new-dropped, of creatures rude, Sparing the udder-loving brood Of every beast through field or wood that roves,”—(Ag. 139.)
While thus gracious to the lower animals, towards humanity, on the contrary, she, like the Homeric Apollo, wears the aspect of a destroying rather than of a benignant power.
Thus she is represented as made by Zens (λέοντα γύναιξι), ‟ a lion unto women, to whom he hath granted might to slay whomso she willeth” (XXI. 484).
Accordingly, in her anger sho slew Laodamia, daughter of Bellerophontes (vi. 205), and wrathful, on account of her neglected rites, she sends the savage, white-tusked boar­ “Who visited with dire annoy I the orchard-grounds of (Eneus." (ix. 540.)Andromache, too, in her address to Hector, alludes to her mother slain by “ arrow-pouring Artemis." (vi. 428.)
In the Agamemnon she appears under the same dark aspect, as the goddess for whose propitiation the sacrifice of Iphigenia was consummated, a tragedy which, by calling down upon her husband the ven­ geance of Clytemnestra, forms the groundwork of the drama.
Far more prominent, however, is the position as­ signed to the Maiden Goddess, Pallas Athena, who may be justly regarded as the bright, consummate flower of Grecian mythology ;
and most interesting it is to trace the history of her growth from her rise in the land of the Aryans to her culmination in the majestic goddess of the Eumenides.
The elemental character of the Homeric Zeus sug­ gests the Idea of some natural phenomenon underlying the extraordinary birth of his brilliant offspring, “ from no mother born."
Accordingly her name has been regarded as corresponding to the Sanscrit Aháná, a recognised appellation of the dawn in the Veda;
and thus her miraculous birth from the head of Zeus, trans­ lated back into Sanscrit, implies that Ushas, the Dawn, sprang from the East, the forehead of the sky.*
Welcker gives a different interpretation of her name.
‟ The Grecians," he says, ‟ brought with them from their distant home the conception of an element of light and warmth above the atmosphere, independent of the sun."
He derives her name from αιθ, to burn, with the ancient suffix ηνη, and regards her as tho impersonation of the pure Ether, the abode of Zeus.
Tho peculiar rites with which her worship was celebrated in different localities, together with tho symbolism associated with her effigy on ancient vases and coins, attest, according to Welcker, tho original elemental character of the goddess.
This deified im­ personation of a nature-power, whether identified with the Ether or the Dawn, becamo gradually invested with a variety of attributes, human and superhuman ;
accord­ ingly, the Athena of the Iliad, though more sharply defined than the Olympian Zeus, nevertheless exhibits the same transitional character which marks the other deities of the Homeric theogony.
In her divine capacity she is the goddess of war and of industrial art, the re­ presentative of practical sagacity as opposed to poetic inspiration, which was assigned to Apollo.
She hears and answers prayer;
she acts inwardly on the minds of the Hellenic heroes ;
she restrains the wrath of Achilles (i. 198);
she imparts aid to Tydeus (iv. 390).
Many similar examples might be adduced.
Neverthe­ less she is not above the practice of deceit, as when she persuades Pandarus to violate the treaty (iv. 94), and also where she lures Hector with guile.
Moreover, the intimate connection between the bright, heaven-sprung goddess and her father, which in the later mythology forms one of her most striking characteristics, is only slightly indicated in the Iliad (viii. 38, 373).
In general, her relation to the Thunderer is one of hostility;
she is represented as leagued with Hera and Poseidon in their attempt to shackle Zeus, for whom she ex­ presses her contempt in no measured terms, while with Hera she appears most intimately associated :
“
Close sat they, side by side, and woes against the Trojans plotted, Truly Athena dumb abode before her proper Father, Though wounded by his argument, and seized with fierce displeasure, (viii. 458;
iv. 21.)Traces of meteoric symbolism in connection with the virgin goddess may, I think, be traced in the Iliad.
Thus, in girding herself for battle, she lets fall upon the starry pavement of her father the brilliant robe­ "Whose tissue she herself had wrought, and with her hand embroidered her Ægis is the terriblo storm-cloud;
her casqne, all golden, measured to contain a hundred cities' footmen, recalls the vaulted sky.
She descends from heaven like a meteor (iv. 70), or like a rainbow wrapped in purple cloud (xvii. 551).
Thus, too, she is described as blowing with gentle breath the spear of Hector (xx. 410), and as becoming invisible by assuming tho casque of Aides (v. 845).
The flaming chariot, with its golden-trapped steeds, in which she descends with Hera to the assistance of the Greeks (v. 720, 748), while suggesting to the imagination the bright rays of light, which spring with the speed of lightning through the portals of tho cast, recalls also the Vedic invocation to Ushas (the dawn) to come in her ample and beautiful chariot, dispersing the darkness;
or wo think of tho Golden chariot of Savitri, or of Indra, decorated with golden ornaments, his white-footed coursers harnessed to his car with a golden yoke.
Tho function assigned to birds in tho Iliad seems also like an echo of tho Vedas.
Thus, when Athena is despatched by Zeus to distil nectar and ambrosia into Achilles— "She plunged in semblance of a bird, the longthy-feater’d osprey, Shrill screaming down from upper sky." (xix. 319.)
It is interesting to remember in this connection the Aryan myth according to which the gods allowed the heavenly soma-drink, the Vedic prototype of the Grecian nectar, to be brought down to earth by a falcon.
In illustration of this subject Kuhn quotes two 'edic hymns (R. iv. 26), (R. iv. 27), in the first of which occurs the following passage :
— "
The speeding falcon, the strong bird, allied to the gods, brought the quicken­ ing, invigorating soma from afar, stealing it from highest heaven.
"When Athena and Apollo ‟Over the armies take their seats, in guise of plumèd vultures, Upon the lofty beech of Zeus, the Ægis-holding Father," (vii. 59.) they remind us of the two birds who sit in friendly fashion upon the summit of the soma-bearing tree of the Vedas.
Thus, too, she sends a heron to greet Ulysses and Diomede;
they recognized the cry, and rejoiced in the divine message (x. 275).
Weleker detects a figurative allusion to meteoric fact in the epithets γλαυκω̂πις and τριτογένεια, by which the Homeric Athena is distinguished.
If we turn now to the Athena of Æschylus, the grand impersonation of the wisdom, benignity, and might of her father, we recognise, as before, the emergence of the classic ideal from the symbolizing tendencies of the earlier nature-worship.
Seldom has the imagination of poet been haunted by a more majestic image than the Athena of the Eumenides;
and as we picture her ‟ like an orator on the Βη̂μα,” organizing the court of the Areopagus, she recalls the grand vision of Divine Wisdom recorded in the book of Proverbs (viii.).
She, too, standeth in the top of high places, and her voice is heard, unfolding the great truth that human laws and institutions are entitled to reverence only in so far as they are based upon the strong foundations of eternal justice and morality.
"
By me kings reign and princes decree justice ;
By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth."
Provo viii. 15, 16 ;
compare Eum. (461, 535).
Most emphatically does the Grecian poet proclaim through the lips of Athena, that righteousness must be based upon reverence and holy fear, thus coinciding with the highest utterance of Hebrew wisdom ;
‟
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil " (Prov. viii. 13), (Eum. 661, 669).
Thus, too, wisdom is represented by the Grecian as by the Hebrew bard, as presiding over the phenomena of external nature (Prov. viii. 27), (Eum. 792).
Yet while Athena alone unlocks the scaled thunder-halls of Zeus, she, like her Hebrew prototype, ‟ rejoiceth in the habitable parts of the earth," and as a gardener cherishes his saplings, so ‟ she loves the raco of righteous men, exempt from suffering " (Eum. 872).
This recognition of moral distinctions as the ground of divine favour forms, perhaps, the most striking point of divergence between Homer and Æschylus, and forcibly recalls the high moral tone of the religion of Ahura-Mazda.
Truly it may be said of the Virgin Goddess that, like the golden dawn, which she is thought to imper­ sonate, she brightens more and more, still heralding by her effulgent but imperfect light the advent of the perfect day.
In following the history of the Virgin Goddess, it is interesting to remember that the dis­ appearance of her colossal statue from the Parthenon in the fifth century was coincident with the hymn addressed to her by her passionate worshipper, the neo- Platonist, Proclus;
thus at the last ‟ she makes a swan-like end, fading in music," and vanishes from history, after commanding, for upwards of a thousand years, the love and veneration of her votaries.
In connection with the study of ancient poetry, as recording the religious life of humanity, it is interesting to consider the history of plastic art, which may be regarded as its sensible expression, and as manifesting, through the medium of ideal forms, the successive stages of its development.
Thus if we revert to that phase of the religious life which is embodied in the earliest literary relics of the Aryan race, we shall re­ cognize the impossibility of embodying in harmonious forms beings so impalpable as the deities apostrophized by the Vedic bards.
In the poetry of those early times we discern the working of the untutored mind struggling to body forth, through the imagery of external nature, its religious yearnings and aspirations;
embarrassed by the complexity of unintelligible pheno­ mena, and destitute of any principle of selection, the imagination runs riot, blends together images the most incongruous, and exhibits that tendency to symbolism which subsequently blossomed out into the colossal systems of India and Eleusis.
The transference of human faith and worship from vague nature-powers, dimly recognized as personal agencies, to veritable personalities, endowed with con­ sciousness and will, and distinguished by diversity of attribute, moral and intellectual, constitutes, as we have seen, the second great stage in the history of human progress.
This emancipation of the divine idea from its association with natural phenomena would lead to the recognition of the human form as affording the solo adequate medium for the manifestation of spiritual existence, a discovery which lies at the root of classic art, and inaugurates the second epoch in the artistic development of humanity.
We have only to pass from the Hall of Egyptian Antiquities, in tho British Museum, to the gallery of the Elgin Marbles, in order to appreciate the importance of the transition.
The Greeks thus realizing the idea that their divini­ ties manifested themselves through the human form, and striving to glorify the temple hallowed by the presence of Deity, were led to discover the essential charac­ teristics of the human organism as a vehicle of superior intelligence.
In reproducing their impressions through tho medium of art, they have given birth to models of ideal beauty, which show us how fair is the tabernacle of the immortal soul, when tho lower propensities arc subjected to higher needs.
They detected tho Divino idea with reference to the human form, and accordingly, in contemplating these glorious creations we experience that indescribable content which invariably comes over the soul, when, by any agency, we are lifted above the limitations of the finite and phenomenal into the region of eternal truth.
Grand and beautiful as are the classic gods, they nevertheless fail to touch the deepest springs of human feeling.
Though invested with the attributes of humanity, we feel that in their emancipation from the sorrows and sufferings incident to our mortal life they are not true exponents of human nature, while as symbols of Deity they are inadequate to shadow forth the one infinite and eternal mind.
From their cold though perfect beauty, the heart of suffering humanity turns to the thorn-crowned figure of the Son of Man, and recognizes in the man of sorrows its true type and representative.
By revealing God as a spirit immanent in the human soul, imparting authority to the oracles of conscience, and sanctity to the inner life, Christianity has dispersed the crowd of heathen divinities, and exalted to the throne of the universe a Heavenly Father whose glory is reflected in the Son of Man.
Christ's realization of conscious union between the divine and human spirit, wrought out through the discipline of sorrow, and issuing in perfect love, has revealed a depth of spiritual life of which in the profoundest myths of classical antiquity we see only a dim but most wonderful foro­ shadowing.
The transition from the classical to the romantic era finds its explanation in these grand central truths of Christianity, which have left their impress alike on art and on literature.
Thus, in the head of our Saviour in the Cena of Leonardo da Vinci, we see that marvellous union of sublimity and pathos, which, while lifting the soul into a higher atmosphere, at the same time appeals to the deepest sympathies of the human heart.
Thus, too, the grand figures of the Sistine Chapel, the pro­ phets and sibyls of Michael Angelo, while exhibiting the human form cast in the majestic mould of the Olympian gods, bear traces, at the same time, of those inner life-struggles which impart to every noteworthy countenance so deep and often so tragic an interest.
The literary productions of the romantic era also bear witness to the deeper significance which attaches to human nature since the advent of Christianity—a phe­ nomenon the recognition of which is essential to the true appreciation of classical literature.
The fundamental distinction between the ancient and modern drama will bo more fully recognized if wo bring into closer comparison the two great fathers of dramatic art, Æschylus and Shakespeare, who, though separated from one another by an interval of nearly twenty centuries, yet offer somo remarkable points both of analogy and contrast.
In studying tho dramas of Æschylus, when we penetrate below the surface, wo find that the solution of problems, ethical and religious, bearing upon man's nature and destiny, constitutes their essence, an object to which tho delineation of character is mallo subser­ vient;
whereas in the dramas of Shakespeare the de­ velopment of character constitutes the primary aim, to which he subordinates the underlying idea of the whole ;
accordingly we should vainly seek in the im­ personations of the ancient bard that marvellous insight into the more subtle phenomena of human nature which imparts so intense an interest to the productions of Shakespeare.
In Æschylus the collision between moral principles, whose harmonious action is essential to the moral order of the world, is set forth by personages, human and superhuman, whose charac­ ters are drawn in bold relief, without exhibiting that delicate shading which charms us in the delineation of the modern bard.
These personages are led in obedience to one moral principle to violate another, which in its turn finds advocates and champions.
The collision, between these opposing interests and the various passions evoked in the struggle sustain the interest of the drama, while the dénouement exhibits the vindication of eternal order by the triumph of that principle which is of primary obligation.
If we apply these principles to the Oresteia, we find that while the several members of the trilogy are linked together by a chain of ethical sequence, which resolves itself into the great doctrine of retribution, each drama is at the same time devoted to the solution of a particular problem, and constitutes accordingly a complete and independent whole.
The collision of duties set forth in the Agamemnon is of peculiar interest, as illustrating a struggle which has its counterpart in the most touching narrative of Jewish history.
Agamemnon, as king and army chief, receives what he believes to be a divine command to propitiate Artemis by the sacrifice of his daughter;
an ordeal, the terrible reality of which can only be ap­ preciated when we consider tho proneness to human sacrifico which characterized the early ages of society.
Abraham, when subjected to a like trial or temptation, after manifesting his perfect submission to what appeared to him to be a divine monition, was led to recognize the true voice of God as harmonizing with the most sacred intuitions of the human heart, and accordingly forbore to slay his child..
Agamemnon, on the contrary, yields to the suggestion of Calchas, and by the sacrifice of Iphigenia violates his obli­ gations to his daughter and his wife.
Clytemnestra appears as the avenger of her child, and in vindication of nature's violated rights, prepares for her husband an ignominious death.
The stern reprobation of Aga­ memnon expressed by the Chorus may be compared to the sublime protest of Micah, and other Hebrew prophets, against such deeds of blood.
Thus tho cruel perversion of religion which found expression in human sacrifice was condemned by tho Grecian poet no less than by the Hebrew sago, a consideration which invests tho Æschylean drama with profound siguifi­ canco.
In order to appreciate the fundamental idea which underlies the drama of the Choephori we must take into consideration the sacred duty of avenging blood, " recognized by the earliest customs and national laws of the East as well as of the West."*
On the murder of Agamemnon by Clytemnestra, it was the bounden duty of his SOIl Orestes to avenge his death ;
the ghost of his murdered father and the Delphic god demand it of him.
The collision, therefore, which forms the groundwork of the drama is between the duty of Orestes as the avenger of his father, and his instinctive recognition of the reverence due to his mother, which tends to withhold him from the commission of the deed.
With admirable skill the poet makes us feel the terrible nature of the struggle, and the religious motives which decide the issue.
When Orestes, almost overcome by his mother's agonizing entreaties, hesitates to commit the bloody act, Pyladcs, who has accom­ panied him as a representative of the god, admonishes him of his duty, exclaiming­ " Choose all for foemen rather than the Gods."
A profound thought underlies the greater heinousness attached to the murder of Agamemnon by Clytem­ nestra, than to the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes.
The bond which unites the mother and the son, which Orestes is required to violate, is instinctive, resting Upon a law of nature;
the tie which unites the husband and the wife is of a different order, involving intelligent volition and reciprocal engagement.
Tho institution of marriage, morever, lies at the root of all law and order, and with the consequent permanence and sanctity of the domestic relations is the sole guarantee for the healthy development of society;
hence the conjugal tie requires to be placed under the special guardianship of the gods and of eternal justice.
Hera, who in the Iliad plays so prominent and often so undignified a part, is introduced in the Oresteia in her grand matronly character, her union with Zeus being alluded to as imparting sanctity to the marriage tie.
A comparison between the Choephori of Æschylus and the Hamlet of Shakespeare may serve to exhibit more strikingly tho fundamental difference between the ancient and modern drama.
In both tragedies the father of the hero has been murdered, and the mother has married the murderer;
in both, the son is urged by supernatural visitations to avenge the crime, and both are prompted by the same motives of disappointed ambition.
In the ancient drama, however, tho death of Agamemnon is represented as the vindication of a moral principle, violated in the person of Clytemnestra.
Accordingly, when pleading for her life, sho not only appeals to the filial revereneo of her son, but also represents herself as having, by tho death of her husband, accomplished the ends of divine justice.
In the modern drama tho murder of the king is repre­ sented as an act of pure wickedness ;
hence when Hamlet is summoned to avenge his father's death, no external object which claims his reverence intervenes to check his purpose.
The hesitancy must therefore come from within;
accordingly the collision is found not in opposing moral principles, but in the personal character of Hamlet.
His soul is not organized to perpetrate this deed of horror;
consequently, wavering in his resolution, and overwhelmed with disgust at the world and at life, he perishes in the consummation of his revenge.
So marvellous is the skill with which the character of Hamlet is drawn, so absorbing the in­ terest which it awakens, that in studying it we are apt to forget the fundamental idea which underlies the drama, the dénouement of which, like that of the several members of the Oresteia, sets forth the great law of retribution, and vindicates the moral order of the Divine government.
In the third member of the trilogy, the poet, while making his drama subservient to objects connected with the political state of Athens, nevertheless subor­ dinates these local interests to the exposition of higher truth.
Among these political objects the most impor­ tant was the defence of the Areopagus, the existence of which was threatened by the growing ascendency of the democracy.
It would be difficult to imagine a more impressive means of recommending this tribunal to the reverence of the Athenians than thus to introduce the celestial powers as assisting at its inauguration.
Of far higher significance, however, is the ethical conception which underlies the drama.
The word Erinys in Greek has been defined to mean “ the feeling of deep offence, of bitter displeasure, when sacred rights belonging to us are impiously violated by persons who ought most to have respected them."
These vengeance- prompting feelings, personified as active, ever-wakeful spirits, became associated with the great nature-power, Demeter, under her more malignant aspect, and hence arose the worship of the dread goddess, Demeter Erinys.
Both these names have been traced back to the Sanscrit;
the Greek Demeter being identified with Dyâvâ Mâtar, the Mother, corresponding to Dyaus Pitar, the Father, and the Erinyes being identified with the Sanscrit Saranyû.
Thus it appears that the venerable goddesses, like Zeus and Athena, have their root in the Vedas.
“In early Greek mythology they were attributed more especially to the Father, the Mother, and the Elder Brother, whenever their sacred rights had been impiously violated."
They are thus introduced in the Iliad (ix. 449;
ix. 572;
xv. 204), where they are represented as avenging any violation of the natural order.
In this character they also appear at the conclusion of tho Choephori, and in the opening scenes of tho Eumenides, where, like blood-thirsty hounds, they pursue Orestes for the murder of his mother:
they take cognizance only of tho outward act, and exercise their functions with the inflexibility of natural law.
They would not tho less have claimed him as their prey had ho left unavenged tho murder of his father (Choeph. 283, 911).
In this fatal collision Athena appears as umpire:
by establishing the court of Areopagus she proclaims the great principle, “ that the highest tribunal upon earth is the collective conscience of humanity."*
The cause is tried before this august assembly;
righteous regard is had for the special circumstances of the deed;
Orestes is acquitted, the sanctity of the primeval goddesses is recognized;
their wrath is appeased, and thus the intuitive thirst for revenge is transmuted into the principle of eternal justice.
Thus the drama of the Eumenides exhibits, under one of its grandest phases, the contest between the Titans and the Olympian gods, issuing in the triumph of free will and moral power over blind instinct and necessity, while the transmutation of the Erinyes into the Eumenides symbolizes the profound thought that even the instinctive tendencies in human nature are implanted there by its Divine Author, and consequently that man's highest well-being demands, not their suppression or annihilation, but their harmo­ nious subordination to the higher faculties of the soul.
Classical poetry affords the true key to classic art;
it is, therefore, interesting to turn from the study of Æschylus to the contemplation of the Parthenon, where the Athenians beheld translated into marble the same profound ideas which the great dramatist has embodied in his immortal works.
Thus the sculptures of the eastern pediment, having reference to the birth of Athena, indicate, by the presence of the Fates and other divine personages, the deep significance attached by the sculptor to the manifestation of Divine Wisdom in the person of the Virgin Goddess;
while in the grand composition of the western pediment, which set forth the contention of Poseidon and Athena for supremacy over the country of Attica, we trace, as in the Eumenides, the association of interests purely local and national with truths of higher significance.
Thus the contending divinities have been regarded as typifying the antagonism between agricultural and maritime pursuits, which formed one main feature of Athenian life;
and also as reflecting the conflicting powers of land and sea, as exhibited in the topography of the interior and the coast..
I doubt not, however, that there rose also before the mental vision of Phidias the grand old allegory of the battle between the Titaus and the Gods, which may be regarded as the mythical expression of that eternal struggle between the lower and higher elements of being, of which the drama of the Eumenides affords so impressive and magnificent a symbol:
this hypothesis appears the more plausible when wo consider the intimate mythological connection which obtained between Poseidon and Demcter- Erinys.
Another most interesting illustration of the intimate association which, in classical times, existed between Poetry and her sister arts is to bo found in the paint­ ings of Polygnotus in the Leseho at Delphi, of which a minute description is given by Pausanias, and which have been admirably restored by Fr. and Job.
Riepen­ hausen.*
The first picture exhibits the capture of Ilion, the desecration of her sanctuaries, and brings before the mental eye the outrage committed against Athena in the person of Cassandra, thus setting forth the origin of the disasters which befell the returning armament of the Greeks:
it would be impossible for the beholders of this picture not to recall the speech of Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon (320), in which she forcibly describes the contrast between the state of victors and vanquished in the captured city, the desolation of which is touchingly symbolized in the painting by the empty cuirass that lies on the altar to which a child is clinging.
The exhibition of the very crimes so earnestly deprecated by the poet (330), prepares the mind for the second picture, exhibiting the descent of Ulysses to Hades, to learn from the prophet the means by which a safe return might be secured.
The punishment of the sacrilegious Tityus, and the retaliation on the undutiful son, could not fail to suggest to the mind of the spectator those passages of the Eumenides in which the poet, with terrible earnestness, describes the direful fate which in the lower regions is the sure award of filial impiety and sacrilege (260).
The schools of design which are springing up throughout the length and breadth of the land bear witness to the importance which is now attached to artistic culture in England.
It must not be forgotten, however, that imagination constitutes the vital principle of art;
that tho practised eye and well-trained hand are powerless except as instruments to embody the conceptions of the creative mind.
Hence the study of poetry acquires new significance, not only as throwing light upon tho master-works of classical antiquity, the recognized models of ideal form, but also as enriching the imagi­ nation, while at the same time it opens both eye and soul to discern the familiar beauty of common life."
Of imagination, fancy, taste, of the highest cul­ tivation in all its forms, this great nation has abun­ dance;
of industry, skill, perseverance, mechanical contrivance, it has a yet larger stock, which overflows our narrow bounds and floods tho world.
The ono great want is to bring theso two groups of qualities harmoniously together.”*
I believe that in poetry will be found one of the missing links through whose agency this alliance between the spheres of beauty and utility is to be consummated.
Milton speaks of “ the glorious, the magnificent, uses which may be made of poetry both in divine and human things;
" while Shelley characterized it as "a fountain for ever flowing with the waters of wisdom and delight."
It becomes, therefore, a question of deep national interest to con­ sider by what agencies these renovating and purifying influences may be diffused, and brought home to the heart of this great nation.
From Greece, " the fountain of all instruction in matters of art," we may perhaps take a hint as to one large and important department of national education.
In this connection I am tempted to quote a passage from Grote's History of Greece, where, after alluding to the abundance in the productions of the tragic muse, at Athens, he proceeds :
—"
All this abundance founds its way to the minds of the great body of the citizens, not excepting even the poorest.
So powerful a body of poetic influence has probably never been brought to act upon the emotions of any other popula­ tion ;
and when we consider the extraordinary beauty of these immortal compositions, which first stamped tragedy as a separate department of poetry, and gave to it a dignity never since reached, we shall be satisfied that the tastes, the sentiments, and the intel­ lectual standard of the Athenian multitude must have been sensibly improved and exalted by such lessons.
The reception of such pleasures through the eye and ear, as well as amidst a sympathizing crowd, was a fact of no small importance in the mental history of Athens.
It contributed to exalt their imagination, like the grand edifices and ornaments added during the same period to the Acropolis.
"The designs of Flaxman from Homer' and Æschylus are wrought into our damask and engraved upon our glass;
it is time that the thoughts of the great poets, from whom he drew his inspiration, should be brought home, with all their rich treasure of imagery to the hearts and minds of our people.
What noble enter­ tainment might not be drawn from “ Heroic poems and Attic tragedies of stateliest and most regal ornament," if, appealing as they do to the feelings of our common humanity, they were made appreciable to the popular understanding by illustrations drawn from history and art!
Believing that Æsehylus strikingly corroborates this utteranee, in all humility I offer to the public this version of his greatest work.
[The WATCHMAN is discovered reclining on the flat roof of the palace.]
I PRAY the gods deliverance from these toils, Release from year-long watch, which, couch'd aloft
On these Atreidan roofs, dog-like, I keep, Marking the stars which nightly congregate;
And those bright potentates who bring to mortals Winter and summer, signal in the sky, †What time they wane I note, their risings too.
And for the beacon's token now I watch, The blaze of fire, bearing from Troy a tale, † Tidings of capture;
for so proudly hopes 10*
A woman's heart, with manly counsel fraught.
Dew-drenched and restless is my nightly couch, By dreams unvisited, for at my side, Fear stands, in place of sleep, nor suffers me Soundly, in slumberous rest, my lids to close.
Then when I think to chant a strain, or hum, (Such against sleep my tuneful counter-charm,) Moaning, I wail the sorrows of this house, Not wisely governed as in days of old.
But may glad respite from these toils be mine, 20 When fire, joy's herald, through the darkness gleams.
Hail lamp of night, forth shining like the day, Of many a festive dance in Argos' laud, Through joy at this event, the harbinger.
Hurrah!
Hurrah!
To Agamemnon's queen, Thus with shrill cry I give th' appointed sign.
That from her couch up-rising with all speed, She in the palace jubilant may lift
The joyous shout, to gratulate this torch, If Ilion's citadel in truth is ta'en, As, shining forth, this beacon-fire proclaims.
30The joyous prelude I myself will dance, For to my lords good fortune I shall score, Now that this torch hath cast me triple six.
Well!
be it mine, when comes this mansion's lord, In this my hand his much-loved hand to hold IThe rest I speak not;
o'er my tongue hath passed An ox with heavy tread:
the house itself, Had it a voice, would tell the tale full clear ;
And I, with those who know, am fain to speak, With others, who know nothing, I forget.
Lo the tenth year rolls apace 40 Since Priam's mighty challenger, Lord Menelas and Atreus' heir, Stalwart Atridæ,--by heaven's grace Twin-throned, twin-seeptered,-from this land A thousand sail, with Argives manned, Unmoor'd,-a martial armament, Warriors on just reprisal bent, Fierce battle clanging from their breast, Like vultures of their young bereaved, Who, for their nestlings sorely grieved, Wheel, eddying high above their nest, By oarage of strong pennons driven, 50 Missing the eyrie-watching care
Of callow fledglings ;
but from heaven, Some guilt-avenging deity, Or all-retrieving Zeus, doth lend An ear attentive to the cry Of birds, shrill-wailing, sore-distrest, And doth upon the guilty send Erinys, late-avenging pest.
So for the dame, by many wooed.
Doth mighty Zeus, who shields the guest, 'Gainst Paris send th' Atridan brood ;
60 Struggles limb-wearing, knees earth-pressed The spear-shaft, rudely snapt in twain In war's initial battle,—these For Danaoi as for Trojans he decrees.
As matters stand, they stand ;
the yet to be Must issue as ordained by destiny.
Nor altar fires, nor lustral rain Poured forth, nor tear-drops shed in vain, The wrath relentless can appease Of violated sanctities.
70But we, unhonoured, weak of frame, Excluded from that proud array, Tarry at home, and, age-oppressed, On staves our child-like strength we lean;
In tender years and age, the same, Life's current feebly sways the breast;
His station Ares holds no more;
Decrepid Eld, with leafage boar, No stronger than a child for war, Treadeth his triple-footed way, Like dream in daylight seen.
80But Clytemnestra, thou, Tyndareus' daughter, Argos queen, What bath befallen ?
What hast heard ?
Confiding in what tidings now Sondest thou round the altar-kindling word ?
Of all the gods who guard the state, Supernal, or of realms below, In heaven, or in the mart who wait, With gifts the altars glow.
90Now here, now yonder, doth a torch arise, Streaming aloft to reach the skies, Charmed with pure unguent's soothing spell, Guileless and suasive, from the royal cell.
What here 'tis lawful to declare, What may be told proclaim;
Be healer of this care
Which now a lowering form doth wear, 100 Till fawning Hope, from out the flame
Of sacrifice, with gentle smile Doth sateless griefs soul-gnawing pang beguile.
The way-side omen mine it is to sing,.
The leaders' prosperous might fore-shadowing, For still my age, unquenched its natal power, Doth suasive song inspire, a heaven-sent dower, How the rapacious bird, the feathered king, Sends forth against the Teucrid land, With spear and with avenging hand, Achaia's double-thronèd Might, 110 Accordant chiefs of Hellas' martial flower.
Toward spear-poising hand, the palace near, On lofty station, manifest to sight, The bird-kings to the navy-kings appear, One black, and one with hinder plumage white ;
A hare with embryo young, in evil hour, Amereed of future courses, they devour.
Chant the dirge, uplift the wail!
But may the right prevail!
120Then the sagacious army-seer, aware How diverse-minded the Atridan kings, In the hare-renders sees the martial pair, And thus, the augury expounding, sings;
­ “Priam's stronghold in time this martial raid Captures, but first the city's store, Tho people's wealth, shall fate destroy :
Now from no god may jealous ire O'ereloud the mighty curb forged against Troy,* 130 Marshalled for battle;
for the holy Maid Is angered at the house, since of her siro
The winged hounds tho wretched trembler tare, Mother and young unborn, her special care;
Therefore doth she the eagles' meal abhor.
Chant tho dirge, uplift tho wail!
But may the right prevail!
†For sho, the beauteous goddess, loves
The tender whelps, new-dropped, of creatures rude, Sparing the udder-loving brood Of every beast through field or wood that roves,-- Hence with Apollo pleads the seer that he 140 From these events fair omens will fulfil, Judging the way-side augury, Partly auspicious, partly fraught with ill.
Oh !
God of healing!
thee I supplicate, Let not the Huntress on the Danai bring Dire ship-detaining blasts and adverse shies, Preluding other sacrifice, Lawless, unfestive, natal spring Of feudful jar and mortal hate, By husband-fear unawed;
For child-avenging wrath, with fear and fraud, Dread palace-warden, doth untiring wait."
150Such woes, with high successes blent, By Fate on the twain royal houses sent, Did Calchas from the way-side auguries Bodeful proclaim :
-Then consonant with these, Chant the dirge, uplift the wail!
But may the right prevail!
Zeus, whoe'er he be, this name
If it pleaseth him to claim, This to him will I address;
Weighing all, no power I know Save only Zeus, if I aside would throw 160 In sooth as vain this burthen of distress.
Nor doth he so great of yore,* With all-defying boldness rife, †Longer avail;
his reign is o'er.
The next, thrice vanquished in the strife, Hath also passed ;
but who the victor-strain To Zeus uplifts, true wisdom shall obtain.
To sober thought Zens paves the way, 170 And wisdom links with pain.
In sleep the anguish of remembered ill Drops on the troubled heart;
against their will Rebellious men are tutored to be wise;
† A grace I ween of the divinities, Who mortals from their holy seats arraign.
E'en so the elder of the twain, Achaia's fleet who swayed, No seer upbraiding, bowed, with grief suppressed, His soul to fortune's stroke ;
what time the host, In front of Chalcis, tossing off the coast ISO Of wave-vexed Aulis, lingered, sore-distressed, While store-exhausting gales their progress stayed.
Blasts, dire delay and famine in their train, And evil-anchorage, from Strymon sweep,- Ruin to mortals;
with malignant power, Ruthless to ships and cordage, they Doubling the sojourn on the deep Wither the Argive flower.
190 But to the chiefs of that array, When, than the bitter storm, the seer A cure shrieked forth, weighted with deadlier banc,- In name of Artemis,-the Atridan twain, Smiting on earth their sceptres, strove in vain To quell the rising tear.
Then thus aloud the elder chieftain cried :
— " Grievous, in sooth, the doom to disobey, But grievous too if I my child must slay, 200 My home's fair ornament, my pride, Defiling these paternal hands, E'en at the altar's side, With virgin-slaughter's gory tide.
What course exempt from evil ?
Say,
The fleet can I desert, the leaguèd bands Failing?
With hot desire to crave the spell
Of virgin blood, the storm that shall allay, Is just.
May all be well!"
210Then harnessed in Necessity's stern yoke An impious change-wind in his bosom woke, Profane, unhallowed, with dire evil fraught, His soul perverting to all daring thought.
For frenzy, that from primal guilt doth spring, Emboldens mortals, prompting deeds of ill;
Thus, armed a woman to avenge, the king
In sacrifice his daughter dared to kill;
The fleet's initial rite accomplishing.
Her prayers, her cries of " Father," her young life 220 Were nought to those stern umpires, breathing strife:
So, after prayer, her sire the servants bade, †Stooping, with steelèd hearts, to lift the maid Robe-tangled, kid-like, as for sacrifice, High o'er the altar;
them he also bade, Guarding her lovely mouth, her bodeful cries, Stern curse entailing on their houses twain, With voiceless muzzles forceful to restrain.
Then letting fall her veil of saffron dye, 230 She smote, with piteous arrow from her eye, Each murderer;
while, passing fair, †Like to a pictured image, voiceless there, Strove she to speak;
for oft in other days, She in her father's hospitable halls, With her chaste voice had carolled forth his praise, What time the walls Rang to the Pæan's sound, Gracing her sire, with third libation crowned.
What next befel I know not, nor relate;
Not unfulfill'd were Calehas' words of fate.
210 For justice doth for sufferers ordain
To purehase wisdom at the cost of pain.
Why seek to read the future?
Let it go !
Since dawns the issue clear with dawning day,
What boots it to forestal our date of woe ?
Come weal at last!
So prays, these mischiefs past, Of Apia's land this one sole guard and stay.
Hail Clytemnestra!
Hither am I come
Thy majesty revering.
For 'tis meet
When the male throne is empty, that we pay 250 To our high captain's consort honour due.
If thou hast heard auspicious news, or not, That with joy-vouching hope thou lightest up
The altar fires, I, as a friend, would know,- Yet shall thy silence nought unkind be deemed.
Joy's harbinger, be radiant Morning born From kindly, mother Night!
So runs the saw.
But thou of joy beyond all hope shalt hear, For Priam's city have the Argives won.
How queen I through unbelief I miss thy word.
Troy is in Argive hands;
now speak I plain ?
260Joy, stealing o'er my heart, calls forth the tear.
'
Tis true, thine eye thy loyalty bewrays.
Of these great tidings what the certain proof?
Warrant I have ;
-how not ?
or Heaven deceives me.
Trusting the suasive augury of dreams ?
The fancies of the sleep-bound soul I heed not.
But hath some wingless rumour buoy'd thee up ?
Thou chidest mo as were I a young girl.
But since what time was Priam's city spoiled ?
This very night now bringing forth the day.
270What messenger could travel with such speed ?
Hephaostos, a bright flash from Ida sending.
Hither through swift relays of courier-flame, Beacon transmitted beacon.
Ida first To the Hermaean rock on Lemnos' Islo;
Theneo Athos' summit, dedicate to Zeus, The third in order, caught the mighty glow.
Upsoaring, bridging in its might the sea, With gathered strength, the onward speeding torch, In golden splendour, like another sun, Its message to Makistos' watch-tower sends, Who, nor delaying, nor by Sleep o'erpowered, The eourier's duty faithfully discharged.
The torch, far-gleaming to Euripos' stream, Gives signal to Messapios' sentinels.
Firing of withered heath a giant pile, With answering blaze, they pass the message on.
The stalwart flame, unwearied and undimm'd, Like a bright moon, o'erleaps Asopos' plain, And wakens, on Cithacron's lofty crag, Another speeder of the fiery post.
290 The warder hailing the far-journeying fire, Kindles a beacon of surpassing glow;
Bounded the radiance o'er Gorgopis' lake, And reaching Aegiplanctos' mountain peak Urged on without delay the fiery chain.
With vigour unimpaired they onward send, Kindled anew, a mighty beard of flame, That, flaring from afar, the headland crossed †O'erlooking Saron's gulf.
Down shooting then, The blaze, alighting on Arachnæ's height, 300 The city's nearest watch-tower, reached its goal;
Thence to the roof of Atreus' son this light Darted,-true scion of Idaian fire.
Thus in succession, flame awakening flame Fulfilled the order of the fiery course:
The first and last are victors in the race.
Such is the proof, the warrant that I give Of tidings sent me by my Lord from Troy.
The gods, 0 queen, will I invoke hereafter.
But now I fain would marvel at thy words, Heard more at large so thou wouldst speak again.
310Troy on this very day th' Achaians hold.
I ween ill-blending clamour fills the town :
Pour in one vessel vinegar and oil, They will not lovingly consort, I trow ;
So now from captives and from captors rise
Two voices, telling of their two-fold fate.
For those, flung prostrate on the lifeless forms
Of husbands and of brothers, children too, Prone on their aged sires, lamenting wail;
While these, night-stragglers after toilsome fight, Keen for all viands that the city yields, Upon no order standing, but as each Hath snatched the lot of fortune, take their fill.
At length from frost and skicy dews set free, They dwell in Ilion's spear-won halls, and sleep †
The live-long night, unsentinelled like gods.
If now the tutelary powers they fear, Who hold the conquered land, and spare their shrines, 330 Captors, they shall not captured be in turn.
But may no greedy passion seize the host
To plunder things unlawful, smit with gain.
A safe return has yet to be secured, And half the double course is yet to run.
But guilty to the gods if come the host, Wakeful may rise the sorrows of the slain For vengeance, though no sudden ill befal.
These words from me, a woman thou hast heard ;
But may the good in overpoise prevail!
340 For I of many blessings choose this joy.
Like prudent man well hast thou spoken, lady.-
But I, on hearing of thy certain proofs, Forthwith prepare me to salute the gods, For no unworthy meed requites our toil.
Hail, sovereign Zeus, and friendly Night, Mistress of mighty glories, hail!
Thou who o'er Troia's tower-crowned height, A snare so closely meshed hast flung, That none, or fully grown or young, Thraldom's huge drag-net may avail To overleap.
Vast ruin captures all.
Great guardian of the guest, Thee I adore ;
-
Wrought were those deeds at thy behest:
The bow thou didst of yore 'Gainst Alexander strain, That nor the destined hour before, Nor shooting o'er the stars, in vain The shaft might fall.'
Tis Zeus who smote them, this we may aver, For easy 'tis to trace;
The end he shaped as he decreed.
360 Yet gods supernal, some declare, To sinful mortals give no heed Who trample under foot the grace
Of sacred things.
But such are reprobate ;
—
Kindred they claim with those, in heaven's'despite, † Who rebel war breathe forth, transgressing right.
Wealth in excess breeds mischief, and o'erturns
The balance of the constant mind ;
370
No bulwark 'gainst destructive fate In riches shall that mortal find Who Justice' mighty altar rudely spurns.
Frenzy's unhappy suasion, fraught with baue
To hapless children, sways the will;
Against the mischief cure is vain ;
Not hidden is the flagrant ill ;
— Baleful it bursts upon the sight;
.380 Like spurious coin, his metal base Use and the touchstone bring to light, Who, boy-like, to a winged bird gives chase, And whelms his native soil in hopeless night.
His orisons tho heavenly powers disclaim, But sweep to doom the sinful wight Practised in guile;
—thus Paris came To Atreus' halls ;
-the friendly board 390 Ho shamed, the consort luring from her lord.
Bequeathing to her people deadly stour
Of shielded hosts, of spears, and ships' array, And Ilion's ruin bearing as her dower, She through the portal swiftly took her way, Daring what none may dare ;
-with many a wail, The palace seers peal'd forth the tale.
[400 " Woe for the house, the house and chieftains, woe!
Woe for the couch, the trace of her once true! "
Wronged, yet without reproach, in speechless woe
There stands he, yearning still her form to view Lost o'er the far sea-wave:
his dreamy pain Conjures her phantom in his home to reign.
He loathes the sculptor's plastic skill
Which living grace belies;
Not Aphroditè's self can still
The hunger of his eyes.
And dreamy fancies, coinage of the brain, 410 Come o'er the troubled heart with vain delight;
For vain the rapture, the illusion vain, When forms beloved in visions of the night, With changeful aspect, mock our grasp, and sweep
On noiseless wing adown the paths of sleep.
Such sorrows o'er the hearth brood evermore, And woes o'ertowering these.
The warrior train Comrades in danger, steered from Hellas' shore, Leaving in Hellas' homes heart-withering pain ;
Full many sorrows rankle at the core.
420 Those whom he sent each holds in ken, But to their homes return Armour and in the funeral urn, Ashes instead of men.
For Ares, bartering for gold
The flesh of men, the scales doth hold In battle of the spear.
From Ilion, back to sorrowing friends, Rich dust, fire-purified, he sends, Wash'd with full many a tear.
No living warriors greet them, but instead Urns filled with ashes smoothly spread.
430 Groaning, each hero's praise they tell;
How this excelled in martial strife;
And that in fields of carnage fell, Right nobly for another's wife.
Breathing such murmurs, jealous hate Doth on the Atridan champions wait.
Achaians, cast in fairest mould, Ensépulehred 'neath Ilion's wall, The fonghten shore now firmly hold, 440 The hostile sod their pall.
Direful the people's voice, to hate Attuned, which worketh soon or late As ban of public doom.
Now o'er my spirit anxious fear Broodeth, lest tidings I should hear
That night still shrouds in gloom;
For blind to deeds of blood the gods arc not.
In Time the swarthy brood of Night With slow eclipse reverse his lot, Who Fortune reareth in despite Of Justice.
Reft of succour lies 450
The wretch once prone.
Excessive praise
Is bodeful ever;
'gainst men's eyes Zeus hurls his blinding rays.
But may ungrudged success be mine !
No city-spoiler let me be!
Nor, subject to another, pine Myself in slavery.
Borne by the joy-announcing flame Swift through the town the tidings fly;
460 But whether true who may proclaim, Or not a heavenly lie?
For who so childish, so distraught, To warm his spirit at the beacon's glow, When other news, with evil fraught, His joy may change to woe?
'Tis woman's way the boon, ere seen, to prize;
Too credulous, her fancy open lies To rumour's rapid inroad, but the fame 470 Published by women quickly dies.
Soon shall we know whether the signal fires,
The swift relays of courier-light be true, Or whether, dreamlike, they beguiled our minds With grateful splendour ;
-Yonder, from the coast, A herald comes, shaded with laurel boughs;
While Clay's twin-brother, thirsty Dust, attests
That neither voiceless, nor of mountain wood Kindling the blaze, will he report in smoke;
480 No,-either will his voice announce more joy, Or,-but ill-omened words I deprecate.
Be omens fair with fair assurance crown'd !
May he who 'gainst the state breathes other prayer, First reap the fruit of his malignant thought.
Oh soil of Argos, oh my native land, In light of this tenth year to thee I come;
While many a hope bath snapt, this one still holds, For ne'er I counted, dying here, to share Beloved sepulture in Argivo soil.
490 Now hail, 0 earth, bright sunlight hail, and Zeus, Supremo o'er Argos.
Thou too, Pythian king, With thy fell darts assailing us no moro ;
Let it suffice that on Scamander's banks
Thy mien was hostileo;
—now, Apollo, lord, Be thou the Saviour,-be the Healer thou I Ye Gods of Council, all I now invoke, Thee, my protector Hermes, Herald dear, Whom Heralds venerate,-and Heroes, ye Who sent us forth, now kindly welcome back The Argive host, poor remnant of the spear.
500Hail royal palace !
roofs belovèd, hail !
Ye seats august, ye powers that front the sun, If e'er of yore, now, with those cheerful eyes Receive in state the monarch absent long, For he returns bringing in darkness light Common to you and all assembled here, King Agamemnon.
Welcome, as beseems, Him who with mattock of avenging Zeus Hath Ilion razed, her under-soil up torn.
Quenched are the fanes, the altars of the gods, 510 And of the land entire the seed is crushed.
Such yoke round Troy bath Atreus' elder sou Fastened :
and lo!
blest by the gods, he comes
Of living men most worthy of renown.
Nor Paris now nor his associate town
Their deed may vaunt as greater than their woe Cast in a suit for rapine and for theft, His surety forfeit, he to utter doom Hath mowed his natal home.
Thus Priam's sons With twofold forfeit have atoned their crime.
520Hail, herald of Achaia's host IAll hail ISo please the gods, I grudge not now to die.
Love for thy father-laud thy heart bath wrung!
So wrung that from mine eyes fall tears of joy.
Sweet the heart-sickness that o'ercame you thus.
The key I lack which may thy words unlock.
Smit with desire for those who longed for you.
Hath Argos yearned then for the yearning host ?
Ay, so that oft from darken'd soul I groaned.
Whence this sad gloom, abhorrent to the host?
530Silence I long have held bale's safest cure.
How I Aught didst fear in absenco of thy lords?
To dio was off my wish as whilom thino.
Well ended, all is well.
But, in long years, Some chances, one might say, fell happily, While others adverse were.
For who, save gods, Lives through the whole of life by grief unseathed ?
For should I tell of toils, of lodgment rude, Infrequent landings, vexed by dangerous surf, tWhat portion of the day exempt from groans?
540 Still more abhorrent was our life ashore ;
-
For close to hostile walls our beds were strewn ;
Dank vapours fell from heaven, while from the earth Drizzled the meadow dews,—our raiment's canker, Matting, like savage beast's, our shaggy hair.
Or spake I of bird-killing winter's cold, Unbearable, from snows of Ida born ;
Or summer's heat, when, stretched on noonday couch, By breeze unruffled, slept the waveless sea ?
But why lament these hardships ?
Past the toil!
Past now and gone,-past also for the dead, 550 Who ne'er will trouble them again to rise.
Why call the spectral army-roll?
and why, Living, bemoan reverses ?
Nay, I claim With many a farewell to salute misehance.
For us, the remnant of the Argive host, Joy triumphs, nor can Sorrow tilt the scale.
Winging o'er land aDd sea our homeward flight.
We to the sun-light well may make this boast, " The Argi ve host, captors at length of Troy, 560 These spoils, an off'ring to Achaia's gods, Hang up, bright glory of their ancient shrines."
Whoso these tidings hears must needs extol
The city and the leaders of the host;
Also the consummating grace of Zeus Due honour shall attain.
My tale is told.
Ungrudged surrender yield I to thy words.
Age still is young enough for grateful lore.
But Atreus' halls and Clytemnestra most
These news concern ;
me also they enrich.
The shout of jubilee erewhile I raised, 570 When first by night the fiery herald came, Telling of Ilion captured and o'erthrown.
Then some one spake and taunting asked," Dost think Trusting the beacon-light, that Troy is sacked ?
'Tis woman's way to be elate of heart."
By such bold utt'rance was my wit misprised:
Yet still I sacrificed :
and through the town With woman's note they tuned the joyous trill, Pæans uplifting in the gods' abodes, The while they lulled the fragrant incense-names.
580 And now, what need that thou shouldst tell me more ?
I from the king himself the tale shall hear.
With honour due, mv venerated lord
To welcome home, myself will hasten :
for-
What sight for woman sweeter than the day Which to her spouse, Heaven-shielded from the fight, Throws wido the gates?
Then hither bid my lord, Beloved of Argos, to return with speed.
Arriving, may he find a faithful wife, Such as he left her, watch-dog of his house, 590 To him devoted, hostile to his foes, In all points like herself, no single seal Through these long years invaded by her hand.
Pleasure, or blameful word from other man, Foreign to me as dyer's hue to brass.
A boast like this, fraught as it is with truth, The lip misseems not of a high-born dame.
Behold!
The queen herself bath tutored thee;
Decorous words her clear interpreters.
But tell me, Herald, touching Menelas, 600 Doth he in safety homeward with the host Hither return, prince to his country dear ?
False news were I to tell, in flatt'ring terms, Not long would friends enjoy the fair deceit.
Oh, could'st thou speak auspicious words yet true I That here they sundered are is all too plain.
The man is vanished from th' Achaian host;
Himself and galley.
No untruth I tell.
Steering ahead from Troy ?
or bath a storm, A common terror, snatched him from the host?
610Like skilful archer thou Last hit the mark;
And hast in brief a mighty woe declared.
Say, doth the voice of other mariners
Report of him as living, or as dead ?
Not one so knoweth as to speak his doom, Save the bright Sun, feeder of teeming earth.
How !
Burst the tempest on the'naval host Through anger of the gods ?
say, what the end ?.Auspicious day with ill-aunouncing tongue Beseems not to defile.
In weal and woo 620 Diverse the honour due unto tho gods.
When messenger, sad-visaged, tidings dire
Of routed armies to the city bears, A common wound inflicting on the state, While many men from many homes are banned, Smit by the twofold scourge which Ares loves, Twin-speared Calamity, a gory pair:
— Whoso is laden with such woes as these
The pæan of the Furies well may raise.
But coming to a town in jubilee, 630 Glad messenger of safety and success, How shall I tidings mingle fair and foul, The tale unfolding of the storm that smote The Achaian host, not without wrath of Heaven ?
For fire and ocean, bitter foes of yore, Sware true alliance and redeemed their pledge, Whelming Achaia's luckless armament.
Then in the night foul-surging mischiefs rose :
Beneath the Thracian blasts ship against ship Dashed wildly;
they, sore-butted by the storm, With furious wind and stress of pelting rain, Vanished from sight, 'neath whirl of shepherd dire.
640 And when uprose the sun's fair light, behold, The Ægean sea with flowerage overstrewn,— Corpses of Grecian men and wrecks of ships.
Us, and our vessel with undamaged hull, Some god, I ween, (not mortal was the power,) Ruling the helm, bath saved, by stealth or prayer.
But Saviour Fortune lighting on our ship,
At moorage she nor felt the billows' strain, Nor drave against the iron-girded coast.
Then safe at last, from watery Hades snatch'd, 650 In genial daylight, still mistrusting chance, With anxious thought o'er this new grief we brooded,— Our host sore wearied, and in evil plight.
And doubtless now, if any still survive, They speak of us as dead.
Why should they not ?
As we imagine a like fate for them.
But may the best befal I For Menelas, Foremost and chief, expect him to arrive;
If any sunbeam knows of him as safe, Rejoicing in the light, (through the device 660 Of Zeus, not willing yet the race to whelm,) Good hope there is that he may yet return.
Hearing this tale, know, thou the truth hast heard.
Who, oh who, with truest aim, Did the battle-wedded dame, Prize of conflict, Helen name ?
Was it not one, unseen, in happy hour, Guiding his tongue with Fate-presaging power?
Helen, the captor ;
-titled fittingly,— 670 Captor of ships, of men, of cities, she From dainty curtained bower bath fled, By Titan zephyr borne along ;
Straight in her quarrel mustered strong The shielded hunters' mighty throng, Marshalled for battle ;
-forth they sped, Swift on their track whose viewless oar Harbour had found on Simois' leafy shore.
680Wrath, with direful issue fraught, Thus to hapless Ilion brought Dear alliance, dearly bought:
Requiter of the outraged festal board, And of high Zeus, tho hearth's presiding Lord ;
Late vengeance wreaking on the guilty throng, Who carol jubilant tho bridal song, Which, fate-impelled, tho bridegroom's kin prolong.
But agod Priam's city hoar 690 A novel hymn doth now intone, From many a voico;
with mighty groau, Woe upon Paris' bridal bed .
She utters ;
—she who long before A dirgeful life, alas !
had led, Weeping her sons in wretched slaughter sped.
So once did wight incautious rear A suckling lion, for the breast Still yearning, to the house a pest.
Tame in life's early morning, dear 700 To childhood, and by Eld caressed.
Carried full oft in fondling play, Like to a babe in arms he lay;
The hand with winning glances wooed, And, smit with pangs of hunger, fawned for food.
But time the temper doth bewray Inherent in his race.
Due maced
Of gentle nurture to repay, Rending the flocks with cruel greed, Unbidden he prepares the feast, 710 And mars with gory stain the halls.
Resistless, dire, athirst for prey, The pest the menial train appals, Reared for the house by Heaven, fell Atè's priest.
So came to Troia's walls, in evil hour, Spirit of breathless calm, fair pride
Of riches, love's soul-piercing flower, 720 The eyes' soft dart;
but from her course aside Swerving, to wedlock bitter end she wrought.
To Priam's offspring came she, mischief fraught, Evil companion, bringing evil dower.
By Zeus escorted, guardian of the guest, She sped, dire Fury, bridal pest.
Lives among men this saw, voiced long ago;
Success consummate breeds apace, Nor childless dies, but to the race 730 From prosperous Fortune springeth cureless Woe."
Apart I hold my solitary creed.
Prolific truly is the impious deed;
Like to the evil stock, the evil seed;
But fate ordains that righteous homes shall aye Rejoice in goodly progeny.
†But ancient Arrogance, or soon or late, When strikes the hour ordained by Fate, 740 Breedeth new Arrogance, which still Revels, wild wantoner in human ill;
And the new birth another brood Unhallowed, in the house doth bear ;
— Gorged Insolence, and, not to bo withstood, Defiant Boldness, demon 'unsubdued ;
— Swart curses twain, their parents' mien that wear.
But Justice doth the smoke-begrimèd cell Illumine with celestial sheen, And loves with honest worth to dwell.
Gold-spangled palaces with hands unclean, 750 Forsaking with averted eyes, To holy Innocence she flies.
The power of wealth, if falsely stamped with praise, With homage she disdains to recognize, And to their fated issue all things sways.
Hail, royal lord!
Stormer of Ilion, hail!
Scion of Atreus
How compose my speech, How due obeisance render thee, Yet neither overshoot the mark, nor fail The goal of fitting compliment to reach ?
760 For many men, transgressing right, there be Semblance who place above reality.
To him who groans beneath affliction's smart, All men have prompt condolence;
but the sting Of feignèd sorrow reaches not the heart.
So men with others' joy rejoicing, bring Over their visage an enforced smile :
But the discerning shepherd knows his fleck, And his unerring glance detects their guile, Who simulating love, with glozing art 770 And watery kindness fawn, but inly mock.
But thou, 0 King, (I speak without disguise,) In Helen's quarrel asking war's array, A mien didst wear unseemly in mine eyes, Guiding not well the rudder of thy mind, Who didst, on death-devoted men, essay Courage to urge, by sacrifice.
But those who have achieved the great emprize, Not from the surface of my mind alone, I welcome now, with feelings not unkind ;
And inquest made, in time shall it be known, 780 Who of thy citizens at home tho while Guarded thy state with truth, and who with guile.
First Argos and her tutelary gods,
Who with me wrought to compass my return, And visit Priam's town with vengeance duc, Justly I hail.
For in this cause the gods, Swayed by no hearsay, in the bloody urn Without dissentient voice the pebbles cast, Sealing the doom of Ilion and her sons.
But to the rival urn, by no hand filled, 790 Hope only came.
Smoke still uprising marks
The captured city ;
Atè's incense-fires
Are living still, but, dying as they lie, The ash sends upward costly fumes of wealth.
Wherefore 'tis meet to render to the gods Memorial thanks;
since round them we have east
Our vengeful toils, and in a woman's cause The Argivo monster, offspring of the horse, Host shield-accoutred, made its deadly leap, And Priam's city levelled to the dust, What time the Pleiades in ocean waned;
So, bounding o'er the towers, of princely blood 800 The raw-devouring lion lapped his fill.
This lengthened prelude to the gods!
and now Weighing the judgment ye erewhile expressed, I say the same, and am with you agreed.
To few is it congenial, envy-free, To venerate the friend whom Fortune crowns.
The jealous poison, lodged within the heart, Tortures with twofold pang whom it Infects ;
By his own griefs oppressed, the envious man Groans also to behold another's joy.
810 Out of my proof I speak, for, well I wot, Who friendship most pretended, only were Its mirrored image, shadow of a shade.
None but Odysseus, who unwilling sailed, Once harnessed, was my trusty yoke-fellow;
This I affirm, be he alive or dead.
But for the rest, what to the state pertains, And to the gods, a full assembly called, We'll weigh in free debate.
Counsel we need.
That where the state is sound, we keep it so;
820 But where disease the healer's art requires, By kind excision, or by cautery, We shall attempt to remedy the harm.
Now to my palace and my household hearth Returning, first will I the gods salute, Who forward sped me, and who lead me home;
Since victory so far bath followed me, Here may she henceforth stedfastly abide1Men of our city, Argive elders here, I shame not in your presence to avow
My wifely temper ;
bashful Fear in time 830 From mortals dieth :
not by others taught, But from myself, the wretched life I'll tell 'Twas mine to lead while this man was at Troy.
First, for a woman severed from her mate, To sit forlorn at home is grievous woe, Hearing malignant murmurs manifold.
One courier comes, another in his train Worse tidings brings to echo through the house ;
And as for wounds, had my dear lord received
As many as report kept pouring in, 840 A net methinks had not been more transpierced.
Or had he died oft as reported then, A second triple-bodied Geryon,* †A threefold cloak of earth he must have donned,‡ Enduring death in every form ho wore.
Thus harassed by these ever-rife reports, Full often from my neck have forceful hands Seized and untied the beam-suspended noose.
And for this cause our son, pledge of our troth, Of mine and thine, stands not beside me now, As stand he should, Orestes.
Marvel not,
For him thy trusty spear-guest nourisheth ;
* Strophius, the Phocian, who bath me forewarned Of twofold peril, thine 'neath Ilion's wall, And next lest clamour-fostered Anarchy Hazard the plot, for 'tis with men inborn To trample further him already down.
This pretext, trust me, carries no deceit.
But for myself the gushing founts of grief 860 Are all dried up, no single tear is left;
Sore with late watching are my weary eyes, Weeping the fiery beacons set for thee Neglected ever.
Often from my dreams
Was I awakened by the tiny hum Of buzzing gnat, seeing, endured by thee, More woes than could have filled mine hour of sleep.
These sorrows past, now with a heart unwrung I hail my husband, watchdog of the fold, Sure forestay of the ship;
of lofty roof 870 Pillar firm based ;
Sire's sole-begotten child ;
Land beyond hope looming to mariners;
Day after storm most brilliant to behold;
To thirsty wayfarer clear gushing spring.
Sooth, sweet it is to 'scape from harsh constraint;
With such addresses do I honour him.
Let Envy stand aloof!
for we have borne
Ere this full many a woe.
Now dear my lord Come from thy car;
but on the ground, 0 King, Plant not the foot that trampled Ilion.
880 Maidens, why tarry ye, whose duty 'tis With carpets to bespread his stepping-floor ?
Swift, purple-strew his passage to a home Unlocked for, e'en as Justice may conduct;
What further she deereeth with the gods, Thought, not by sleep o'ermastered, shall dispose.
Daughter of Leda!
Guardian of my home!
Such as my absence was, is now thy speech, Drawn out to ample length.
With better grace
My praise had come from others than from thee.
890 And for the rest, seck not in woman's guiso
To pamper me, nor, gaping forth loud cries, Bow down to me, as to barbaric wight.
Make not my path with tapestries bestrewn A mark for envy.
To the gods belong Such signal honours ;
but for mortal man, On bright-hucd broidery to plant his foot, I own it, is to me not free from dread ;
As mortal honour me, but not as god;
Without foot-carpeting or gorgeous web, Glory resounds ;
a constant mind to keep 900 Is Heaven's best gift;
him only call we blest
Who ends in fair prosperity his days.
If thus I bear myself I need not fear.
Against my settled purpose speak not thus.
Deem not my sober purpose I will mar.
Haply thou thus to act hast vowed in fear.
Final and sure my word as man e'er spake.
What, thinkest thou, had Priam done if victor ?
Purples, I ween, he verily had trod.
Then stand not thou in fear of human blame.
910Yet hath the people's rumour mighty power.
Life envy-free is life unenviable.
'Tis not for woman to be fond of strife.
But it becomes the fortunate to yield.
Does conquest in this struggle rate so high ?
Yield thee;
thy will bend willingly to mine.
If thou wilt have it so, let one with speed
These buskins loosen, vassals of the foot;
Lest, if with them sea-tinetured robes I tread, Some jealous eye of gods smite me from far.
920 For much it shameth me, with wanton feet
To mar this wealth of silver-purchased web.
Of this enough.
This stranger damsel now Kindly receive.
Zeus, with propitious eye, Beholds the victor's sway with mercy crowned.
For willingly none bears the captive yoke;
But she, the chosen flower of many a spoil, Fair present from the host, bath followed me.
But since herein I yield me to thy will, Treading on purple to my halls I go.
930A sea there is (which who may drain ?) that breeds Abundant purple, fresh from many a shell, Precious as silver, brilliant dye of robes, Whereof, through favour of tho gods, these halls May boast, 0 King, a store right plentiful;
And poverty is stranger to our house Trampling of many garments had I vowed, Had thus the oracles our house enjoined, Hansom devising for this precious life.
For while tho root lives on, tho leafago spreads, Screening the mansion from the dog-star's ray.
940 So now, returning to thy household hearth, As warmth in winter doth thy presence show.
And when Zeus breweth from the acrid grape Rich wine, then coolness thro' the halls is shed, Where, crowner of the home, the husband dwells.
Zeus,
Zens, all-crowner, my petitions crown :
Thine be the care of that which crown thou wilt.
Whence this dread portent, that untircd
Before my bodeful spirit floats ?
950 Wherefore, unbidden and unhired, Waken these dark prophetic notes?
Why sits not on my bosom's throne
The direful presage to disown
As riddling dream, assurance strong?
Time's youth bath flown
Since the stern-cables from the boats
Were flung, what time the ship-borne host Marched on to Ilion from the sandy coast.
After long absence their return 960 With self-informing eyes I learn ;
Yet in its depths my soul, self-taught, Chanteth Erinys' lyreless strains ;
My hopes, of courage reft, depart;
Not vainly throb my inmost reins ;
Whirleth on eddies of dark thought
My bodeful heart;
Yet, against hope, the gods I pray, That, false to augury, my lay 970 Futile may fall, with vain foreboding fraught.
Never will perfect health confess
Her limit sated ;
though disease, Neighbour, with party-wall, against her press.
Sailing with prosperous course elate, Strikes on the hidden reef man's proud estate.
Then if reluctant Fear, with well-poised sling, 980 His bales cloth into ocean fling, Riseth once moro the bark ;
and though With evil freighted to tho full, Floateth secure the lightened hull.
So likewise, gift of ample worth From Zeus, tho year's increase, Whose teeming harvests in the furrows grow, Quells tho disease of dearth.
But when on earth the crimson goro
Of man bath fallen, never more May charm or spell tho vanished life evoko;
Henco ho of old, whoso mystic lore 990 Was skilled tho dead from Hades to restore, Fell, blasted by tho Thunderer's warning stroke.
†Now did not Fate-a heaven-sont Fato— Bafflo my impulse, oro too lato, Leaving behind the lagging tongue, My heart its bodeful strain had sung.
But now it raves;
no cheering rays
My anguished spirit knows, And hopeless to unravel Fate's dark maze 1000 With fiery ardour glows.
Come thou too in, Cassandra, thee I mean;
For not in wrath Zeus placed thee in our house A sharer in our lustral rites to stand, With many slaves beside his household altar.
Now from this ear descend;
be not too proud, For e'en Alemena's son,—so runs the tale,- Sold as a slave, endured the forceful yoke ;
But if such fate befal thee, great the boon Heirs of ancestral wealth to own as lords ;
1010 For upstarts, beyond hope who fortune reap,- These reckless are and cruel to their slaves.
From its thou hast what usuage warranteth.
Thee in clear words she hath addressed, and thou, Meshed as thou art within the toils of Fate, Yield if thou canst;
mayhap thou wilt not yield.
Nay, an she be not, swallow-like, possessed Of an unknown, barbaric tongue, my words, Reaching her mind, must move her to comply.
Follow!
She counsels for thy need the best:
1020 Be thou persuaded;
—leave thy chariot-seat.
No leisure have I here before the gates
To linger;
for, beside the central hearth, The victims wait the sacrificial fire ;
A favour that our fondest hope transcends.
But thou, if aught wilt do of what I say, Make no delay;
but if, of sense bereft, Thou canst not catch the meaning of my words, In lieu of voice, speak with barbarian hand.
A clear interpreter the stranger needs :
[1030 Distraught she seems, like creature newly caught.
Nay, she is mad ;
to her distempered thoughts
She listens ;
from a newly-captured town
She cometh here, nor knows the yoke to bear, Till quelled in foam the passion of her blood.
But words I'll waste no more, thus to be seorned.
But I, by pity moved, will not bo wroth ;
Come, wretched sufferer, this car forsake ;
To Fortune yielding, hansel this now yoke.
Ah mo !
alas !
Gods, Earth !
Apollo, 0 Apollo !
1040
Why raise for Loxias these cries of bale ?
Not he the god to need the mourner's wail.
Ah me !
alas !
Gods, Earth !
Apollo, 0 Apollo!
Once more she calleth with ill-omened cry, The god who hath no part in misery.
Apollo, 0 Apollo!
Thou way-god!
my destroyer!
Once more thou hast destroyed me utterly.
She seems about to augur her own ills ;
1050 Heaven's breathing e'en in bonds her spirit fills.
Apollo, 0 Apollo!
Thou way-god!
my destroyer !
Ah, whither hast thou led me ? to what roof?
To the Atreidan;
an thou dost not know I tell thee;
thou'lt not say it is not so.
All!
Ah!
A heaven-detested house, whose walls of yore Halters have seen, and streams of kindred gore;
A human shambles with blood-reeking floor.
1060Keen scented seems the stranger, like a hound ;
Ay, and the blood she's tracking will be found.
Ah !
Ah!
Lo !
witnesses trust-worthy !
Vouchers dire !
These babes, who weep their death-wound, faith inspire, Their roasted members eaten by their sire!
Thy fame oracular bath reached our car;
But certes sejk we now no prophet here.
Alas!
ye gods I
What is she plotting?
what new blow ?
A mighty mischief plots she 'ncath this roof;
1070 An unimaginable cureless woe, Unbearable to friends.
Help stands aloof.
Dark arc these oracles ;
the first I know ;
For, them the city voucheth wholly true.
All wretched ono!
The deed wilt consummate?
With guile Wilt in the bath thy wedded consort cheer?
How speak the issue ?
Soon it will be here ;
—
Hand after hand is lifted.
Woe the while !
1080I comprehend her not;
this mystic lore, These blear-eyed oracles perplex me sore.
Woe!
woe!
Look!
look!
What see I there?
Is it, ye gods, a net of hell ?
The wife herself, joint-slayer, is the snare.
Now o'er the accursèd rite
Let the dread brood of Night, Unglutted with the race, their chorus swell!
What Fury 'gainst this house doth summon ?
What,
The shriek to raise ?
Such utt’rance cheers me not.
Pallid through every vein 1090 Blood to my heart doth run, Which to the battle-slain Quencheth life's sun ;
But Atè comes amain.
Hold!
hold !
Woe!
woe!
The heifer there Keep from the bull.
In meshes fell †
Of black-woofed garb entangled,-guileful snare,- Catching,—she smites him dead;
- Prone in his watery bed He falls.
The laver’s guileful doom 1 tell.
I boast not to be skilled in auguries, Yet mischief here I cannot but surmise.
1100 Through spells, say, if ye know, To mortals here below, What grateful cheer is sent ?
Their wordy arts from human woe Breed dark presentiment.
Woe!
woe!
my wretched ill-starred lot!
Wailing another's fate mine own I mourn ;
Why hast thou led mo hither, all forlorn, Unless with thee to perish ?
Wherefore not ?
Thou'rt frenzied, by some god possest, And tuneless quirest forth thy doom, 1110 Like nightingale, with dusky plume Sateless of song.
From heart opprest, Ceaseless her Itys, Itys, flows,* Her life bewailing, rich alone in woes.
Woo!
woe!
Clear-voicèd bird, arrayed
In plumed shape, by powers divine ;
Sweet life, unmarred by tears, is thine :
But me awaits the double-edged blade.
Whence hast thou these prophetic throes, Rushing athwart thy soul, in vain ? 1120
Why body forth in dismal strain, Blent with shrill cries, these direful woes ?
Whence cometh thus to vex thy soul
Of prophecy the dark, ill-omened goal ?
Oh, nuptial rite, oh, nuptial rite, Of Paris, fraught with doom !
Scamander !
whence my fathers drank, Nourished of yore upon thy bank, I throve in youthful bloom.
Me now Cocytos and the streams of night 1180 To augur on their dismal shores invite.
What thought hast uttered all too clear?
An infant might interpret here.
Smitten within am I with gory sting, The while thy bird-like cry to hear My heart doth wring.
Oh deadly coil, oh, deadly coil Of Ilion, doomed to fall !
Alas, the flower-cropping kine Slain by my father at the shrine To save her sacred wall!
1140 But cure was none :
she perished ;
vain the toil!
I too, soul-kindled, soon shall press the soil.
This tallies with thy former strain ;
Sure some ill demon smites thy brain, And falling on thee moves thee thus to tell
In piteous chant thy doleful pain.
The end I cannot spell.
In sooth the oracle no more shall peer Forth from a veil, like newly wedded bride ;
1150
But flashing on the soul, like wind that blows Sunward, it dasheth 'gainst the orient beams A mighty surge that doth this grief o'ertop.
No more through dark enigmas will I teach I And bear me witness, how in eager chase
The track I scent of crimes wrought long ago.
For from this roof departeth never more A choir, concordant but unmusical, To evil tuned.
Ay, drunk with human blood, And by the draught made bold, within these halls 1160 Abides a rout, not easy to eject, Of sister Furies ;
lodged within these walls
They chant in chorus the primeval curse.
Hostile to him his brother's couch who trod, In turn they tell their loathing.
Have I missed,
Or, like true archer, have I hit the mark?
Or strolling cheat, or lying prophet am I ?
Before I die, attest ye now on oath
That of these halls the hoary crimes I know.
And how can oath be healer of a woe Inherent in the race?
Yet marvel I 1170 That, nurtured o'er the sea, thou know'st to speak
Of foreign city as though native there.
Loxias, the seer, me with this grace endowed.
How!
passion-smitten was he, though a god?
Till now it shamed me to speak of this.
True ;
for who fareth well grows over-nice.
Love-wrestler was he, warm his favour breathed.
Came ye in course to rite conjugial ?
Consent I gave, but cheated Loxias.
Mistress already of presaging art?
11 SOAy, to the townsmen all their woes I spelled.
No credence won I after this offence.
To us thy oracles seem all too true.
Woe!
woe!
alas!
alas!
ye miseries !
Of faithful augury the direful toil Racks me once more, with bodeful preludings Vexing my soul.
-Seated withiu these halls, See, tender boys, like dreamy phantoms;
children, 1190 As by their dear ones done to death, their hands Filled with their proper flesh, for nutriment;
Their heart and vitals,—loathsome, piteous, meal,— Look, how they hold,-their siro has tasted, look!
For these, I say, vengeance devising, waits A dastard lion, wallowing in bed;
House-warden, sooth, to him that's come, my master.
For the slave’s yoke, alas !
I needs must bear.
The naval leader, loveller of Troy, He knows not that tho fell she-dog, whose tongue Spolio words of guileful welcome, long drawn out, Like linking Atè, will achieve his doom.
1200 Such things slio dares ;
tho female slays the male I Her,—what detested monster may I name Aud hit the mark ?-Some basilisk, or Scylla Housing in rocks, deadly to mar’ners, Infuriate dam of Hades, breathing f orth, Against her dearest, curse implacable ?
What triumph-notes ex ultantly she raised, All daring one, as in the turn of fight, Feigning to gratulate his safe return !
What boots it whether I persuade or no ?
1210
The doomed must come ;
ere long to pity moved, Me thou wilt own a prophet all too true.
Thyestes' banquet of his children's flesh I knew and shudder at;
fear takes my soul, Hearing the truth, no imaged counterfeit.
The rest I heard, but follow not the track.
On Agamemnon dead, I say, thou'lt look.
Lull, poor forlorn one, thy ill-omened tongue.
Yet o'er this speech no healing god presides.
If be it must;
but may it never be;
1220The while thou prayest, theirs it is to slay.
Widely thy glance hath missed mine oracles.
Ay, for the plotter's scheme to me is dark.
Yet in Hellenic speech my words are couched.
So too are Pythian chants, yet hard to spell.
Alas !
what are is this!
It seizes me.
Woe!
woe!
Lykeian god!
Apollo!
Woe I The biped lioness, that with the wolf
In absence of the noble lion couched, 1230 Will me, her victim, slaughter, and as one Poison who mixeth, she my doom will add To crown her vengeance ;
whetting 'gainst her lord
The murderous knife, sho boastoth to exact His death, as payment for escorting me.
Why longer wear this scorn-provoking gear, This wand, these wreaths prophetic round my neck ?
Theo I will shatter cro myself am doomed.
Hence to destruction :
I will follow soon;
Another, in my place, enrich with woes.
Behold.
Apollo’s self doth strip me baro 1210
Of the prophetic robo ;
coldly he gazed, What time, in these adornments vainly tricked, To friends and enemies, with one consent, All undeserved, a laughter I became :
Vagrant yclept, poor hunger-stricken wretch, A strolling mountebank, I bare it all;
And now the seer (his vengeance wreaked on me The seeress) calls me to this deadly fate.
My father at the altar fell, but me
The slaughter-block awaiteth, smitten down By stroke relentless, reeking with hot gore.
Yet not unhonoured of the gods we fall;
1250 For other champion of our cause shall come, Seed matricidal, venger of his sire.
An exiled wanderer, from this land estranged, Returns, this vengeance for his friends to crown.
For, lo, the gods a mighty oath have sworn, His father's prostrate form shall lead him home.
But why, an alien here, pour I my wail ?
When that I first have seen my Ilion fare
As fared it hath, and they who won the town
In sorry plight, through judgment of the gods.
1260 I'll do I I'll suffer !
I will dare to die.
These gates, as gates of Hades, I adjure, One prayer I offer, " mortal be the stroke Free from convulsive throes, in easy death, While ebbs my life-blood, may I close mine eyes.
Oh woman, thou most wretched and most wise;
Lengthy thy speech hath been ;
but if thou knowest Truly thine own sad doom, how walkest thou Like heaven-led victim, boldly to the altar ?
There’s no escape;
brief respite, nothing more.
1270Yet to be last is gain at least of time.
The day is come, small were my gain by flight.
Enduring art thou, and of dauntless mind.
Yet dear to mortals is a glorious death.
Such words none heareth from the fortunate.
Alas, my siro, for thee and thy bravo sons!
[She suddenly starts back.
What may this mean ?
What terror drives thee back ?
Alas!
alas!
Why this alas, unless somo horror searo theo?
Blood-reeking murder breatheth from these hulls.
12S0'Tis but the scent of victims at the hearth.
Nay, but such breath as issues from a tomb.
No Syrian odour tell'st thou for the house.
Well!
I will go, within these palaco halls
To wail mine own and Agamemnon's doom.
Enough of life !
Strangers!
Alas!
Alis !
Yet quail I not, as birdé at the brake, Idly ;
in death my vouchers be in this, When, in my place, woman for woman dies, And when for man ill-wedded, man shall fall.
1290 Dying, this hospitable grace I crave.
Poor wretch ;
Thy fateful doom my pity moves.
Once more I fain would speak, but not to pour Mine own funereal wail;
but to the Sun, Looking my last upon his beams, I pray That my avengers pay my murderers back, Requiting me, poor slave, their easy prey.
Alas, for man's estate!
If Fortune smile, A shadow may o'erturn it;
should she frown, A moistened sponge the picture doth destroy.
1300 More than the first this doom my pity moves.
[Exit into the palace.
All are of boundless weal insatiate ;
—
None warneth from his balls
Him at whom Envy points, as rich or great, Saying, " Come here no more."-
So to this man the Blessed Ones have given To capture Priam's walls ;
—
Home he returns, beloved of Heaven;
-
But must he now the blood repay
Of ancient murder ;
must he die, And dying expiate, 1310 With his own death, their deaths who died of yore ;
Who, being mortal, this can hear, nor pray, That be were born to scathless destiny ?
[In the palace.
Woe's me !
I'm smitten with a deadly blow !
Hush I Wounded unto death who lifts this cry.
Woe’s mo !
Again !
a second time I'm struck.
By the groaning of the monarch, wrought methinks is now tho deed ;
But together taking counsel, weave we now some prudent schemo.i.
To you my counsel is to raise the cry, And to the palace call the citizens.
1320it.
To me seems best, at quickest, breaking in, To prove the deed by newly-dripping blade.
III.
I, this opinion sharing, give my vote For action ;
-not to dally is the point.iv.
'Tis manifest;
for they, thus preluding, Give to the city signs of tyranny.v.
Ay, we delay ;
-they, treading under foot All thoughts of dalliance, sleep not with the hand.vi.
No plan I know to fashion or propose ;
Against the guilty doer we must plot.
1330VII.
That view I share, for no device I know, By words, the dead man to restore to life.
VIII.
What!
dragging on our lives, shall we obey
These home-polluters?
Them our leaders make?ix.
That were past hearing, better far to die;
For milder doom were death than tyranny.x.
How !
may we not on evidence of groans
Augur full surely that the man is dead ?
XI.
Ere we can argue, we must know the facts;
Assurance differs widely from surmise.
1340XII.
This I commend, taking the general vote, Plainly to know how fareth Atreus' son.
Though much to suit the times before was said, It shames me not the opposite to speak :
For, plotting against foes,—our seeming friends,- How else contrive with Ruin's wily snare.
Too high to overleap, to fence them round?
To me.
not mindless of an ancient feud, Hath come at last this contest ;
-late indeed.
The deed achieved, here stand I, where I slew.
1350 So was it wrought (and this I'll not deny), That he could neither 'scape, nor ward his doom;
Around him, like a fish-encircling net, This garment’s deadly splendour did I cast ;
—
Him twice I smote, and he, with twofold groan.
His limbs relaxed ;
—then, prostrate where he lay, Him with third blow I dowered, votive gift To nether Hades, saviour of the dead.
Thus as he fell ho chafed his soul away;
And gurgling forth the swift death-tide of blood.
1360 He smites me with black drops of gory dew.
Not less exultant than, with boaven-sont joy The corn-sown land, in birth-hour of the ear.
For this great issue, Argive Senators, Joy ye, if joy ye can, but I exult.
Nay, o'er the slain wore offrings meet, with right Hero were they poured,—with emphasis of right.
Such goblet having filled with cursed ills
At home,-himself on his return drains off.
We marvel at thy tongue, how bold thy speech, 1370 Who o'er thy husband makest so thy vaunt.
As witless woman are ye proving me ;
But I with steadfast heart, to you who know, Proclaim,—aud whether ye will praise or blame, It recks me not,-this man is Agamemnon,- My husband, dead, the work of this right hand, Doer of righteous deed ;
-so stands the case.0 woman, what earth-nurtured bane, What potion, upsent from the wind-ruffled sea, Hast tasted, that on thine own head dost heap 1380 Curses, for incense, folk-mutter'd and deep !
Hast cast off.
hast slain ;
—
Out-cast, uncitied, thyself shalt be, Huge hate of the townsmen blasting thee.
Me thou dost doom to exile,-to endure
The people's hate, their curse deep-muttered,-thou, Who 'gainst this man of yore hadst naught to urge.
He, all unmoved, as though brute life he quenched, The while his fleecy pastures teem'd with flocks, His own child slaughtered,-of my travail throes 1390 To me the dearest, ---charm for Thracian blasts.
Him shouldst thou not have chased from land and home
Just guerdon for foul deed ?
Stern judge thou art
When me thou dost arraign ;
- but, mark my words, (Nerved as I am to threat on equal terms,) If with strong hand ye conquer me, then rule;
-
But should the god decree the opposite, Though late, to sober sense shalt thou be schooled.0 haughty of council art thou ;
—
And haughtily-minded thou vauntest amain, 1400 As raveth thy mind neath blood-reeking fate.
Calling for vengeance, glares forth on thy brow Of blood the foul stain ;
— Forsaken of friends, tho common hate, Death-blow with death-blow shalt expiate.
This solemn sanction of mine oaths thou hearest ;
—
By the accomplished vengeance of my child, By Até, by Erinyes, unto whom I slow this man,—Expectancy for me Treads not the halls of Fear, while on my hearth, 1410 Ægisthos, kind as heretofore, burns fire ;
— For ho of boldness is no puny shield.
There prostrate lies this woman's outrager, Minion to each Chryseis under Troy.
There too, this captive slave, this auguress, And this man's concubine,-this prophetess, His faithful bedfellow, who shared with him The sailor's bench.
Not unrequited wrought they ;
For he lies-thus.
While she, in swan-like fashion, Having breathed forth her last, her dying wail, 1420 Lies here, to him a paramour, and so Adds keener relish to my sweet revenge.
Oh might some sudden Fate Not tethered to a weight Of couch-enchaining anguish, hither waft The boon of endless sleep!
For our most gracious guardian slain we weep, In woman's cause of yore Full many a pang who bore, And now lies smitten by a woman's craft.
Woe!
frenzied Helen, woe !
1430
Through thee alone, through one, How many souls, how many, were undone ;
What havoc dire 'neath Troia thou hast wrought.
* * * * *And now the cureless woe, Heirloom of blood, shed long ago, Through thee bath blossomed, causing strife Unquenchable, with husband-murder rife.
Bowed beneath sorrow's weight, Invoke not deadly Fate, Nor in thine anger Helen thus arraign, 1440 As though through her, through one, Fell many a Danaan son ;
— She-man-destroyer, working cureless bane!
Demon, who now dost fall Ruthless on Atreus' hall Making the twin Tantalidæ thy prey, †Tbrough women's haughty reign, Gnawing my heart, thou dost confirm thy sway.
Like bodeful raven hoarse, She standrth o'er the corse, And chants exulting her discordant strain.
1450Ay now thy speech in sooth Runs even with tho truth, Calling tho thrice-dread demon of this race ;
For in their veins is nursed, By him, the quenehless thirst For blood ;
ere pales tho trace
Of ancient pang, now ichor flows apace.
Mighty tho demon, dire his hate, Whom hero then boastest to preside ;
Woe !
woe !
ill-omened praise of Fate, 1460 Baneful aud still unsatisfied !
Alas!
'Tis Zeus, in will, in deed, Sole cause, sole fashioner;
for say What comes to mortals undecreed By Zeus, what here, that owneth not his sway ?
Woe !
woe!
King !
King!
how thee shall I bewail ?
How voice my heartfelt grief?
Thou liest there Entangled in the spider's guileful snare;
In impious death thy life thou dost exhale.
1470Ah me!
ah me!
to death betrayed, Sped by the two-edged blade, On servile couch now ignominious laid.
Dost boast as mine this deed ?
Then wrongly thou dost read, tTo count me Agamemnon's wife ;
-not so;
Appearing in the mien
Of this dead monarch's queen, The ancient fiend of Atreus dealt the blow ;
—
Requiting his grim feast, 1480 For the slain babes, as priest, The full-grown victim now he layeth low.
That thou art guiltless of this blood
Who will attest?
Yet by thy side, Haply, as thy accomplice, stood The Fury who doth here preside.
Through streams of kindred gore Presseth grim Arcs on to claim Requital for the deed of shame
The elotted blood of babes devoured of yore.
1490Woe ! woo!
King !
King !
thee how shall I bewail ?
How voice my heartfelt grief ?
Thou Host there Entangled in the spider's guileful snare, In impious death thy life thou dost exhale.
AIr me !
ah me to death betrayed.
Sped by the two-edged blade, On servile couch now ignominious laid.
By no unjust decree Perished this man, for ho 1500 Through guilo hath household death enacted hero :
—
His proper child no blew, Sweet bud from me that grew, Iphigenia, wept with many a tear.
Foul quittance for foul deed ;
—
He reaped the sword's due meed, Hence no proud boast from him let Hades hear!
Perplexed I arn, bewildered sore
Which way to turn;
escape is vain ;
1510 Totters the house;
I dread the crimson rain
That with loud plashing shakes these walls;
no more Falleth in niggard droppings now the gore.
And bent on deed of mischief, Fate anew On other whetstones, whetteth vengeance due.
Earth!
Earth!
oh hadst thou been
My shroud ere I my king Prone in the silver-sided bath had seen !
Who will inter him?
Who his dirge shall sing?
So hardy thou?
Wilt thou who didst assail 1520
Thy husband's life, thyself uplift the wail ?
Wilt to his shade, for the great deeds he wrought, Render a graceless grace, with malice fraught ?
With tears of honest grief
Weeping the godlike chief, Above the tomb who now shall raise
The funeral hymn ?
Who speak the hero's praise ?
Not thine the task to counsel here.
By us he fell:
this man we slew;
Ours be it to inurn him too;
1530 Borne from the palace, o'er the bier Shall sound no notes of wailing ;
-no, But him, with blandishments, shall meet Iphigenia ;
by the rapid streams Of Acheron, his daughter, as beseems, Facing her father, shall around him throw Her loving arms, and him with kisses greet.
That taunt still answers taunt we see.
Here to adjudge is hard indeed.
Spoiled be the spoiler ;
who sheds blood must bleed.
While Zeus surviveth shall this law survive..
1510 Doer must suffer;
'tis the Fates' decree;
Who from the house the fated curse may drive ?
The race is welded to calamity.
Ay!
now on Truth thou dost alight I I with the demon of this race- The Pleisthenid—an oath will plight.
My doom, though grievous, I embrace.
But for the rest, hence let him hastol Leaving this house, let him another raro 1550 Harass with kindred murders.
For myself, When from these halls blood-frenzy I have chased, Small pittance shall I cravo of worldly pelf.
Hail, joyous light of justice-bearing day I At length I cam aver that Gods supernal, Judges of men, look down on earthly woes, Beholding, in the Erinyes' woven robes, This man, thus prostrate, welcome sight to me, The wiles atoning compassed by his sire.
1560 For Atreus, Argos' ruler, this man's father, Did from the city and his home expel Thyestes, rival in the sovereignty,- My father, to be plain, and his own brother.
But coming back, a suppliant of the hearth, Wretched Thyestes found a lot secure, Not doomed his natal soil with blood to stain, Here in his home:
but this man's godless sire, Atreus, with zeal officious more than kind, Feigning a joyous banquet-day to hold, 1570 Served to my sire, for food, his children's flesh.
Their feet indeed, the members of their hands,— Seated aloof, in higher place, he hides.
Partaking of the undistinguished parts,
In ignorance, Thyestes eats the food, Curse-laden, as thou seest, to the race.
Discerning then the impious deed, he shrieked, And back recoiling the foul slaughter spewed.
Spurning, with righteous curse, th' insulted board Dread doom he vows to the Pelopidæ ;
— 1580 "
So perish the whole race of Pleisthenes."
Hence is it that ye see this mail laid low;
The righteous planner of his death am I.
For me, the thirteenth child, in swathing clothes, He with my wretched sire, to exile drove.
But, grown to manhood, Justice led me back, And I, although aloof, Lave reached this man, The threads combining of the fatal plot.
Now for myself 'twere glorious to die, Seeing this man entrapped in Justice' toils.
To honour insolence in guilt, Ægisthos, 1590 I know not ;
—that with purpose thou didst kill
This man, thou boastest;
of his piteous doom Sole author thou :
—I tell thee thine own head To Justice brought, be sure shall not escape
The curse of stoning by the people's hand.
Plying the lowest oar, dost menace us
Who from the upper benches sway the helm ?
Being old thou know’st how bitter at thy years Wisdom by stern necessity to learu.
But bonds and hunger-pangs, to cure the mind Of stubborn old, are skilful leeches found.
1600 Hast eyes, yet scest not this?
Against the pricks
Kick not, lest stumbling, thou shouldst come to griet.
Woman, house-mate to him from recent war Return’d,— defiler of thy husband's bed, Death thou didst plot against this warrior chief.
These words will fountains bo of bitter tears.
Thy tongue the opposite to Orpheus is;
For he drew all by rapture of his voice, While thou, by idle bark, dost all things stir †To hate ;
— when conquered, thou wilt tamer show.
1610Shalt thou be ruler of the Argives, thou, Who, when that thou hadst plotted this man's death, Didst courage lack to strike the blow thyself?
To spread the snare was plainly woman's part, For I, his ancient foeman, was suspect;
But armed with this man's treasure, be it mine To rule the citizens.
Th' unruly colt
That, barley-fed, turns restive, I will bind †With heavier thong than yokes the trace-horse;
—him, Darkness' grim comrade, Famine, shall see tamed.
This man why didst thou not, 0 base of soul, Slaughter thyself?
But him his wife, with thee, The land polluting, and her country's gods, Hath slain.
Orestes, sees he still the light, That, home-returning with auspicious Fate, He may, with mighty stroke, deal death to both ?
Since thou art minded thus to act, not talk alone, know quickly.
* * * * * [To his attendants.
Come on, my faithful body-guard, the fray is not far distantCome on then, and with hand on hilt, his sword let each make ready.
Be well assured, with hand on hilt, to die I too refuse not.
To die,—thine utterance we accept, and take as thy death-omen.
Dearest of husbands let us not, I pray, work further mischief.
Already in our many woes reaped have we wretched harvests.
Of sorrow there bath been enough ;
let us forbear more bloodshed.
Go thou, and yo too aged men, seek your appointed mansions, Ere aught ye do to work mischance.
As fato enjoined we’ve acted.
If trouble is tho lot of mau, enough have we en­ countered ;
Sore smitten by tho heavy hoof of some avenging demon.
Thus ye a woman's counsel have, if any deign to hearken.
To think that their vain tongue 'gainst me into such speech should blossom;
-
That they should hurl forth words like these, their proper doom, thus tempting :
They against sober reason err, thus to insult their ruler.
Upon the evil man to fawn is not the wont of Argives.
But, be assured, some future day, I yet shall overtake you.
Not so if hither to return some god should guide Orestes.
Full well I know that exiles still on hopes are wont to batten.
Work as thou listest.
Gorge thy fill.
Stain justice.
Thou canst do it.
Be sure that thou to me shalt pay the forfeit of thy folly.
Be boastful and be bold, like cock beside his partner strutting.
These senseless barkings heed not thou ;
thyself and I together, Ruling within these royal halls, will all things wisely order.[
MY friend the translator wishing to obviate the charge of arbitrarily departing from Æschylus, requests me to draw up a list of the conjectural emendations of the text which I have suggested.
Space forbids ray here justifying them.
I will state them as briefly as I can.
F. W. N.]
In 142, 146, such words as I insert seem to be deficient.
In 144 I have written κρίνων for the absurd στρούθων.
In 148 a nominative, expressive of Artemis, is deficient.
I have changed ἀπλοίας, which can hardly bear the epithet ἀντιπνόους, into ῎Αγρεια (huntress).
164. Read εὔξεται for the old λέξει.
Οὐδεν εἴξεται πρὶν • " will not vaunt that be was aught of yore.
"175.
For δέ που read γέ που, and remove the stop after σωφρονεîν.
Join ἄκοντας with σωφρονεîν, ἦλθε with βιαίως.
“And to men, loath to learn sobriety, there cometh forcibly a grace (1 trow) of deities, who sit on holy beneh.”
The " grace " is the painful wisdom learned by suffering.
278.
For ἰσχὺς read ὄσχας or ὄσχους, “twigs” of flame;
suggested by πεύκη, the pine.
In the corrupt πρἡδονἠν a verb is concealed, such as προήχμασεν, προήκρισεν, vibrated, perked forward.
Προσήασεν is possible, but was less like y to be corrupted than some rarer verb, as προσηθρισεν, wafted.
299.
Before φλέγουσαν a whole line seems to be lost, such as [αἰγὴν κελεύουσ’, ἀστραπαîς εὐαγγέλοις] φλέγ
ουσαν.365. Treading in Blomfield's steps, I attempt the corrupt passage thus- (Του̂το, the fact of excessive abundance.)read (until we get something bette)—Join σιγὰ ἐφιεμέων. "
There is silence along (her) paths, while they long to view the viewless."
I understand this of Helen's ὁμηλικίη.
In antistrophe for ‛Ελλάδος read ῞Ελλᾱνος.741.
This very corrupt passage admits of an approximate solution, thus— Vulgo, t νeὰ † φαόυς κότον I δαίμονά t τε t τὸν ἄμαχον ὰπό­ λεμον] ὐνίερον .... θράσος ῎Ατης is put for θράσεια ῎Ατη and εἰδομένη,fern., agrees with it.
If μελαίνας is correct, it seems to mean “ gloomy (funereal)," and is joined with the dative μελάθροις.
Then the antistrophe is (omitting βιον in 749, and reading ἔδεθλα with Dindorf, &c.)— (for vulg., ὅσια).
776.
Ad pting from Franke ἐκ θυσιω̂ν for έκούσιον, read also θρήσκοισι for θνήσκουσι, which cannot be right.
Then, we set “ infusing into religious men confidence from the sacrifices.
”844, Πολλὴν ... λέγω.
Schütz, if I remember, regards the line as spurious, and with good reason.990.
οὺδὲ τὸν ὀρθοδαη̂ .... is quite unsatisfactory.
I conjecture οὐχὶ ••• ;
has not Jupiter put a stop to it ?1095.
For μελαγκέρων, by all means read μελαγκρόκω̩, and for ἐν πέπλοισι perhaps ἐμπλακέντα.1422.
I think τῆς εμῆς ought to be τήνδ’ έμῆς, for ἐπήγαγεν must have Agamemnon as nominative.
παροψώνημα, a delicate side dish, can only mean Cassandra.
It cannot mean " a relish."
Χλιδῃ̑ς cannot be right, but perhaps the participle χλιδῶν.1446.
For κρέτ
ος ἰσόψυχον (which is defective in metre as well as sense), read κράτος σινόψυχον, " thou establishest a soul-blighting sway by means of women.”
Hermann by inserting τ’after κράτος did not improve the sense.
ORESTES.
CHORUS OF CAPTIVE WOMEN.PYLADES.NURSE.ATTENDANT.[SCENE.
––The royal palace in ARGOS, as in the previous tragedy.
The tomb of AGAMEMNON is seen in the orchestra.
ORESTES and PYLADES enter in the garb of travellers.
They approach the tomb.
ORESTES ascends the steps.]T SEE, shade-escorting Hermes, I invoke, In Hades guardian of my royal sire,- To me, thy suppliant, be saviour thou, My firm ally,-for to this land I come Exile no more ;
-on this sepulchral mound Father I call thee,- hearken to my cry !— ∗∗ ∗ ∗ ∗A primal lock, as nurture-gift, I vowed To Inachos, and now this second lock, Griefs token, Father, I devote to thee,- For, absent from thy funeral obsequies, I could not then as mourner wail thy death, Nor speed with outstretched hand thy royal bier.
What sight is this ?
What company of women 10 Is wending hitherward, in sable weeds Conspicuous ?
What disaster bringeth them ?
Doth a new sorrow fall upon our house ?
Or rightly may I deem that to my sire
They bear libations,-soothing to the dead ?
It must be so, for yonder, as I think, Steering this way, Electra comes, my sister, Signal by depth of woe.
Oh, grant me, Zens,
To venge my father's death ;
-be thou to me Ally propitious !
-Now, my Pylades, Stand we apart, that I may clearly learn
What may import this suppliant female train.
[They conceal them elves.
Sent from the palace, forth I tread, 20 Libations bearing to the dead, Guiding, with hands swift-clapped, a doleful train.
Marred is my check with many a gory stain, Nail-ploughed each new-cut furrow bleeds;
My heart on cries of dolour sateless feeds.
Rending my flaxen-tissued vest, With smileless passion, uncontrolled, Grief loth my sorrow-stricken breast Dismantle of tho garment's decent fold.
For, shrill of voice, hair-bristling Fear, In Atreus' household vision-seer, SO Breathing forth rage in sleep,-at dead of night From the recesses of these royal halls, Rang out a cry of wild affright
That heavy on the women's chambers falls.
And dream-interpreters proclaim, Pledged to the truth, in Heaven's name, That unavenged 'neath earth, the slain Against their slayers wrathfully complain.
Such graceless grace, against the threatened ill Devising cure, (oh fostering earth!)
The godless woman sends me to fulfil.
To speak the words prescribed I dread ;
40 For ah !
when blood hath once been shed, Falling to earth, what ransom can be paid?
Woe for the sorrow-stricken hearth.
Woe for the home in ruin laid!
Sunless, of men abhorred, a murky cloud Doth through the master's fall the dwelling shroud.
The majesty invincible of old, Matchless, supreme, who filled the car Of faithful lieges, and their heart controlled, Standeth aloof;
—Fear reigneth now, For to Prosperity men bow, 60 Which they as God, ay more than God, revere.
But Justice' stroke some swift doth whelm
In light who dwell;
on others wait, †Lingering, their woes in Darkness' glimmering realm;
Others sheer Night enshrouds in blackest fate.
When nurturing earth is blood-drenched, lo Fixed is for aye the vengeance-crying gore ;
—
And he who shed it, paying Atè's score, †Doth burgeon out in all-entangling woe.
60The bridal couch if man profane, †Hopeless is cure ;
though in one common flood, To purify the hand defiled by blood, All streams commingling flow, they flow in vain.
But for myself, through Heaven's command, The captured city's doom I share ;
-
Led hither from my native land, 'Tis mine tho menial's lot to bear.
Their acts, whose will my fortune sways, Just or unjust, I needs must praise:
70 †Beneath ray vest grief's anguished throes Shrouding, I quell my bitter hate ;
—
While numbed in heart by secret woes, Of my true lords I weep the hapless fate.
Ye captive women, yo who tend this homo, Since ye are present to escort with me
These lustral rites, your counsel now I crave.
How, while I pour these off'rings on the tomb, Speak friendly words ?
and how invoke my Sire ? 80
Shall
I declare that from a loving wife
To her dear lord I bear them ?
from my mother ?
My courage fails, nor know I what to speak, Pouring libations on my father's tomb.
Or shall I pray, as holy wont enjoins,
That to the senders of these chaplets, he Requital may accord, ay!
meed of ill.
Or, with no mark of honour, silently, For so my father perished, shall I pour These offerings, potion to be drunk by earth, Then, tossing o'er my head the lustral urn, (As one who loathèd refuse forth has cast,) 90 With eyes averted, back retrace my steps?
Be ye partakers in my counsel, friends, For in this house one common hate we share.
Through fear hide not the feelings of your heart;
For what is destined waits alike the free
And him o'ermastered by another's hand;
-
If ye have aught more wise to urge, say on.
Thy father's tomb revering as an altar, Since thou commandest, I will speak my thoughts.
Speak, as my father's tomb revering.
100Pour- High claims uplifting for the wise of heart.
But of our friends whom thus may I address ?
First name thyself and whoso hates Ægisthos.
Hearing my words, do thou interpret them.
Whom else to number with this friendly band ?
Think of Orestes though an exile still'
Tis well,-not vainly hast thou prompted me.
Now for tho guilty,-mindful of his death,-What shall I say?
unskilled, instruct me thou.
110As judgo or as avenger meanest thou ?
Say plainly, who shall death with death requite.
May I the gods thus pray nor impious be ?
How not requite an enemy with ill?
Of powers above the earth and powers below Herald supreme, escorter of the shades, Hermes, now summon to attend my prayer
The guardians of ray father's house, dread powers, Throned in the nether world, and mother Earth, 120 Who all things bringeth forth, who fosters all, And cloth of all receive again the germ.
And I, libations pouring to the dead, Thus pray, my Sire invoking ;
—" Pity me, And dear Orestes pity ;
-how shall we Rule in our palace-home?
for sold, alas !
By her who bare us, we as outcasts stray;
While, for Ægisthos, 'complice in thy death, Her lord she bartered ;
-slavish is my lot, Orestes exiled from his wealth, the while Revel the twain, exulting in thy toils.
130 That home Orestes may at length return, By glad success escorted, I implore.
Give ear, and grant me, Father, to become Sounder of mind by far than is my mother, With hands more pure.
For us these orisons;
But for thy foes, Father, this prayer I urge, That Justice, thine avenger, may appear, So that thy slayers may in turn be slain.
For them an evil utterance I pour.
To us upsend these blessings from below, 140 With gods, and Earth, and Justice conquest-crowned."
Over such prayers, libations, lo!
I pour.
Yours be it now, lifting the solemn wail, To crown with dole the pæan of the dead.
tDrop ye for the dead Tears with pattering sound;
Lustral rain is shed O'er the hallowed mound, From the pure which screeneth bale, While the powers of Evil quail.
Hear, 0 master, at thy tomb, 150 Whispered sounds from sorrow's murky gloom.
Now in measured flow Tune the notes of woo!
When will warrior brave, †(War-god strong to save Houses in the dust laid low,) Hurl tho spear, from hornèd bow Wing the arrow's deadly flight, Or wield the hilted brand in closer fight?
These earth-drained offrings hath my sire received.
Ha!
this new wonder ponder now with me.
Speak on ;
yet palpitates ray heart with fear ?
Laid on the tomb this lock new shorn I see.
160Shorn from what man, or what deep-girdled maid ?
Who here will guess may easily divine.
Although the elder, I from thee would learn.
There is but one who could have shorn this hair.
True, foes are they who with the lock should mourn.
And further, it is like, yea, very like--Like what ?
Like whose ?
That I am fain to learn.
In sooth I find it greatly like mine own.
Then should it be Orestes' stealthy gift ?
The semblance of his clust'ring locks it bears.
170But hither how could he have dared to come ?
He this shorn lock hath sent to grace his sire.
Not less be wept by me what now thou sayest, If, living, he may never tread this land.
Rolls o'er my heart a surge of bitterness, Smitten am I as with a piercing shaft;
And from these eyes, while gazing on this lock, The thirsty drops of sorrow's wintry flood Flow unrestrained.
For how may I conceive
That other of the townsmen owns this hair ?
ISO
And certes, sho who slew him sheared it not, My mother,—all unworthy of the name, Who towards her children bears a godless mind.
Yet how with full assurance may I call
This off'ring his, dearest of mortal men, Orestes,—still, hope fawns upon my heart.
Alas !-
Oh had it, herald-like, a friendly voice, So I by doubt no more should be distraught.
Then had it clearly counselled me this lock
To loathe, if severed from a foeman's head, 190 Or else, akin to me, had shared my grief, Gracing this tomb, an honour to my sire.
But let us call upon the gods, who know
In what dire storms, like sailors, we are whirled;
Since if by them our safety is ordained, From tiny seed may spring a mighty stock.
And lo, these traces-yet another sign;
Footprints that tally with my own ;
-and see, Two diverse outlines are impressed, his own, And also of some fellow-wayfarer.
200 The impress of this foot, from heel to too, Thus measured, hath the symmetry of mine.
Travails my heart-disordered is my wit.
Acknowledging to Heaven thy prayers fulfilled, Pray that the further issue may be blest.
What have I won by favour of the gods ?
Thou seest those for whom thou long hast prayed.
How knowest thou for whom I raised the prayer ?
I know Orestes in thy heart enshrined.
And say wherein are now my prayers fulfilled ?
210Myself am he ;
-seek none than mo more dear.
Stranger, around me wouldst thou weave some snare ?
Myself against myself would then contrive.
Wouldest thou mock at my calamity?
I at mine own should mock, mocked I at thine.
Art thou Orestes If Thou to whom I speak ?
Myself thou soest, and discernest not;
Yet gazing on this lock of mourning hair, And in my footprints marking well my track, Thy fluttered thoughts did paint me to thine eye.
220 This lock, thy brother's, like in hue to thine, Mark well, applying it whence it was shorn ;
Mark too this garment, by thy shuttle wrought, Scenes of the chase, embroidered by thy hand.
Be calm,-through joy lose not thy self-control;
For deadly are, I know, those near in blood.
Oh !
cherished darling of thy father's house, Hope of our race, thou precious seed, long wept, Trusting in thy strong arm thou shalt regain Thy natal home.
0 name beloved, in which 230 Centre four dear affections ;
for perforce, Thee I must hail as father, and on thee Love for my mother, justly hated, falls;
And for my sister, pitilessly slain.
My faithful brother hast thou ever been, My pride, my awe ;
-only may Strength and Right, With Zens supreme, third Saviour, aid thy cause.
Zeus, Zeus, beholder be thou of these woes;
- Mark the young brood, reft of their eagle-sire, Who perished iu the folds, the snaky toils 2-10 Of direful serpent;
—orphaned they endure
The pangs of hunger;
not yet strong of wing To carry to the nest the eagle's prey.
So mayest thou behold us twain, myself, And her, Electra, offspring sire-bereft, Thus doomed to common exile from our home.
And if of sire, who greatly honoured thee With many a sacrifice, thou slay the brood, Whence, from like hand, wilt festive gifts obtain ?
As none, if thou the eaglets slay, henceforth 250 To mortals will thy trusty omens bear;
Nor, if all withered, shall this royal stock, On sacrificial days, support thine altars.
0 foster it, and raise, from low estate, A house which now seems fallen utterly.
Oh children, Saviours of your father's hearth, Forbear, lest some one should o'erhear your words
And all, with gossip-loving tongue, rehearse
To those in power;
whom dead I fain would see Blazing 'mid spirting pino-wood's pitchy brands.
260Of Loxias the mighty oraclo
Will not betray me, urging mo to brave
This peril, oft exhorting me, and 'gainst My inmost reins tempestuous ills denouncing, Failed I to ehaso my father's murderers.
Stript bare and goaded on by forfeiture, lie bade me slay them as my siro they slew, Declaring I should else atonement make With my own life and many grievous woes.
For earth-born medicines, that to other mortals 270 Are poison-antidotes, shall in us twain, So he avers, show forth these maladies;
— A leprous canker, cleaving to the flesh, That eats with rancorous tooth the vital strength, And through disease blanches the youthful locks ;
Next of the Furies other dread assaults
He pictured, springing from my father's blood.
For the dark shafts of those beneath the earth, (The slain who cry for vengeance to their kin,) With frenzy wild, and groundless fear at night, Disturb and harass his distracted soul, 280 Who clearly in the darkness Phœbos sees To knit his brow.
-Thus from the town they chase
The wretch all mangled with the brazen scourge.
Moreover to such caitiff is denied
Or festal cup to share, or solemn pledge, While from the altars, him, a father's wrath Unseen excludes ;
—him may no host receive To cleanse, with purifying rite, from guilt ;
-
Till, friendless and dishonoured, dies the wretch, The shrivelled prey of all-destructive doom ;
Such oracles I needs must trust;
and e'en 290 Mistrustful were I, vengeance must be wrought;
For many divers promptings mingle here;
-
The god's command, heart-sorrow for my sire, And indigence hard-pressing, these forbid That citizens, of mortals most renowned, Who, with heroic spirit, wasted Troy, Be slaves of women twain.
For womanish His soul !
If not, the issue soon he'll know.
Ye mighty Fates, end ye the great emprize, As Right, with Heaven's high sanction, hath decreed ;
- 300 " Let tongue of Hatred pay back tongue of Hate Thus with her mighty utt'rance Justice cries, Due penalty exacting for each deed.
“ Let murder on the murderous stroke await!”— “ Doer of wrong must suffer.”
—This sage lore, Tradition utters, trebly boar.
What word or deed of mine, Father unblest, Can I, from this confine, Waft to thy couch of rest, 310 Changing thy murky gloom Into bright day!
Nathless to grace thy tomb, Welcome to Atreus' line, Pour wo the lay.
—My son, the wasting jaws of fire Quell not tho spirit of the dead, Full late ho manifests his iro.—
When mourned is ho whoso blood is shed, The slayer is revealed.
In time, For slaughtered parents, righteous cry 320 Of orphans, raised unceasingly, Availeth to search out the hidden crime.
In turn, our tearful strain, 0 Father, hear !
Hark how thy children twain Wail forth their anthems drear !
Exiles, we seek thy tomb, Sad, suppliant pair;
Say what of good is here !
What hope relieves our gloom !
330 Triumphs despair.
And yet, should so the god ordain, Hereafter, gladder notes shall sound;
— Instead of this funereal strain In palace-halls shall ring amain A pæan to the dear one newly found.
Oh haddest thou, 'neath Ilion's walls, But perished, by some Lycian spear Transfixed, my father, to thy halls Glory bequeathing, while thy proud career A lustre o'er the path had shed 340 Which now in gloom thy children tread;
Beyond the wave, by numbers reared, a mound, No burthen to thy house, thou then hadst found.
Dear to the dear ones in the fight
Who perished nobly, thou hadst lain,­ With majesty arrayed, and might, A king in Pluto's gloomy reign, Serving the great ones who command 350 In Hades.
-For in upper day King was he over kings, whose hand
The fatal sceptre wields which men obey.
Xay, Father, under Troia's wall With other victims of the spear, What need for thee in death to fall, And near Seamander grace a foreign bier ?
Oh rather might the murderous twain Themselves have met their death-blow, slain 360 †By kindred hands, so from afar the tale Had reached thine car, shielded thyself from bale.
Richer, my child, thy words than gold;
- Bliss Hyperborean they excel.
†It may not be!
Of scourge twefold The clang resounds.
—Already dwell ’Neath earth your champions ;
here who reign Have hands unclean ;
hateful to me the twain ;
Them in more direful hato these children hold.
Like dart thy word of dread, Piercing mine car, hath sped.
Zeus, Zeus, upsending from below Late thine avenging blow,- Upon man's daring, crafty deed, †To parents thou dost deal their righteous meed.
Oh be it mine to celebrate, Triumphantly, the howl of pain, From caitiff smitten to the death, From woman yielding up her breath !
380 †For why the rage dissemble now That shakes my soul ?
at my heart's prow Relentless gales of vengeful hate, And stormful rancour, blow amain.
Oh that, with arm of might Great Zeus, who guards the right, †Woe, woe,—would strike the guilty pair!
Come peace to this domain !
Just meed may the unjust obtain!
390 Earth, and ye powers of Hades, hear my prayer.
For law it is, when on the plain Blood bath been shed, new blood must fall.
Carnage doth to the Fury call;
Avenger of the earlier slain, She comes, new Ruin leading in her train.
Oh Earth, and ye who rule below, Behold, and ye dread Furies of the slain, Behold us, outcast, miserable twain;
Poor remnant of the Atridæ ;
-whither go ?
400 Oh !
sov'reign Zeus, what refuge from our woe ?
Throbbeth my woman's heart with fear, The while thy dirge mine ear assails ;
At one time hopeful courage wanes, And darkness o'er my inmost reins Broods, as the doleful sound I hear.
Then once again kind hope prevails ;
She with new strength uplifts my heart, And, full of grace, bids conscious grief depart.
Can grief by flattery be subdued, 410 Or soothed by fawning?
No, to quell the pain By parent's hate engendered, charms are vain;
Like savage wolf that ravens for its food, Tameless from birth is sorrow's torturing brocd.
With Arinn beat I strike my breast;
My outstretched hands in wild unrest, With Kissiau mourner's rhythmic woe, In quick succession,—to and fro, Shower from all quarters blow on blow ;
While with the burly rings amain My battered head and my distracted brain.
420Cruel, all-daring, Mother, woe I Alas, as foeman buries foe, A king, no trusty liegemen near, Thy wedded lord without a tear, Thou hadst the heart unwailed to send below.
All the dishonour thou hast shown :
Therefore shall she our Sire's disgrace atone, Far as the gods prevail, Far as my hands avail;
Then may I perish when she lieth prone!
430Maimed was he ;
-let this whet thy hate;
And with like outrage him she did entomb, That for thy life his fate Might be too sore a weight.
Such was thy Father's ignominious doom!
Our Father's lot thy words proclaim;
While I, despised, a thing of nought, Shut out like vicious cur with shame, Forgot to smile ;
alone, I sought Solace in weeping,-anguish-fraught.
410 Hearing the tale my lips impart, Grave it, my brother, on thy inmost heart.
Piercing thine ear, oh may my word Find access to the depths within!
True is the tale.
Thy spirit gird To hear what yet thou hast not heard!
Now, with undaunted heart the strife begin.
Thine aid, 0 Father, to thy dear ones lend !
Weeping sad tears, my voice with his I blend.
Our prayers, in concert, to the shades descend;
Give car, and rising to the day 450 Against our foes join thou the fray.
Ares shall cope with Arcs,-Right with Right.
Ye gods, give righteous judgment in the fight.
Hearing your prayers, I tremble:
hid in night, Tarries from Eld tho doom of Fate ;
Invoked it cometh, sure, though late.
Oh curse that in our house doth reign!
Discordant Atè's murd'rous blow !
Alas intolerable pain!
460 Alas for cureless woe !
No foreign aid can bring relief;
No! from yourselves the eure must flow.
'Tis blood must staunch your household grief.
So chant we to the gods below.
Hear, blessed powers;
Beneath the earth our orisons attend I And with aspect benign, Succour and conquest to these children send !
My Father, in no kingly fashion slain, 470 To me, thy suppliant, grant to sway thy house.
I too, my Father, need thy gracious aid, That scathless I may work Ægisthos' doom.
So mortal men to thee shall dedicate
The solemn banquet;
-else, unhonoured thou, When grateful reek rich off'rings to the dead.
Nuptial libations of my heritage I too will bring from the paternal home, And chief in honour will this tomb adorn.
0
Earth, my sire upsend to watch the fray.
480Persephone, oh grant us fair success!
Think,
Father, of the bath that reaved thy life.
Think of tho net in which they tangled thee.
In shackles, not of brass, wast snared, my father.
Basely enveloped in the treacherous folds.
Art thou not roused by these reproaches, Sire ?
Dost to thy dear ones not uplift thino bead?
Either send Justice, ally to thy friends,
Or give them in like grasp thy foes to hold, If thou, o'orthrown, wouldst victor bo in turn.
490And hearken, Father, this my last appeal;
Behold thy fledglings nestled on tliy tomb;
Pity thy progeny of either sex, Nor Pelops' remnant seed exterminate;
For thus, though dying here, thou art not dead.
For children are as voices that prolong
The dead man's fame ;
like corks they float the net, The flaxen line upbearing from the deep.
Hearken!
For thine own sake this wail we raise;
500 Thyself art saved in honouring this plaint.
Unblamed in sooth have ye your speech prolonged, Due to his tomb and unlamented fate.
But since to action now thy soul is braced, To work forthwith I Put Fortune to the test.
So be it!
yet not out of course I ask
What mean these off'rings ?
By what motive swayed, Seeks she too late to med'eine cureless bale ?
For to the dead, who heeds it not, she sends A sorry tribute ;
—I divine it not!
Her crime o'ertops the gift;
—for should we pour 510 Earth's treasures to atono for one man's blood, Vain were the toil ;
-so runs the ancient saw.
But if thou knowest answer to my prayer.
That can I, son, for I was there ;
-by dreams,
And troublous terrors of the night appalled, The godless woman sent these sacred rites.
Heard ye the dream, and truly can rehearse ?
She, as herself relates, a dragon bare.
And what the scope, the issue, of the LIe?
In swathing-clothes she moored it as a child.
520What nurture might the new-born horror crave?
She, in her dream, herself held forth the breast.
How by the pest the nipple then unscathed ?
With nurture-milk it sucked the clotted blood.
Not vain the dream but by her husband sent;
-In terror shrieked she, waking up from sleep, And many torches, in the darkness quenched, Gleamed through tho palaco in our mistress' aid;
Libations to tho tomb forthwith sho sends Devising for her woo a sovereign cure.
530I to this earth and to my father's tomb Pray that this dream bo consummate in me.
And as I rend it, sooth, it tallies well.
For if the snake, quitting the self-same womb, Was girded straightway with my swathing-clothes, And, gaping round the breast that nourished me, Sucked with my nurture-milk the clotted blood, While she in terror, at the portent shrieked ;
—
Clear is it, as she reared the ghastly pest, So forceful must she die.
I, dragon-like, 510 Myself shall slay her, as this dream declares.—
As augur of these portents thee I choose.
So let it be !
But now direct thy friends,
These how to act, or those aloof to bide.
Hear then, in brief;
— Sister, go thou within;
But these I counsel to conceal my plans.
For as with guile an honoured man they slew, Themselves with guile shall be entrapped, and die In the same toils, foretold by Loxias, Apollo Lord, no faithless seer of yore.- 550 For I, equipped for travel, with this man, With Pylades, will reach the outer gate;
I as a stranger ;
.-he as ransom-friend;
- Familiar both with the Parnassian speech, The tongue of Phocis we will imitate.
And if no friendly warder, on the plea
That by dire evils is the house possessed, Will give us entrance, we without will bide, Until some passer guess our plight, and say, " If that Ægisthos knoweth, being at home, 560 Why 'gainst the suppliant cloth he shut the door?"
Then if the threshold of the gates I cross, And him discover on my father's seat,— Or should he meet me face to face, and set His eyes on me, ere he can speak the word, " Whence is this stranger ?
"—I will lay him dead, Spitting his body round my nimble steel.
The Fury thus, of gore insatiate, Shall blood untempered quaff, third, crowning draught.
Go thou,-keep watchful guard within the house, 570 That all, well ordered, fitly may combine.[To the Chorus.
To you a tongue of wisdom I commend, To speak in season, or from speech refrain.
-[To PYLADES.
And for the rest let this man look to it, When in the strife of swords this arm hath won.
Full many a horror drearAnd ghastly, Earth doth rear;
- With direful monsters teems encircling Ocean;
Meteors, with threatening sheen, 580 Hang heaven and earth between ;
—
The tempest's wrath still raves with wild commotion;
These, and dire wingèd things, and things that crawl, Thou mayst describo them all.
But man's audacious might
What words can paint aright, Or woman's daring spirit who may tell ?
Her passion's frenzied throes, Co-mates of mortal woes ?
For love unlovely, when its evil spell 590 'Mong brutes or men the feebler sex befools, Conjugial bands o'errules.
Let him confirm the truth I sing, Whose thoughts soar not on Folly's wing, Knowing full well what Thestios' daughter planned*;
—
Her fiery plot, child-murdering;
Wretched, who burnt her son's coeval brand.
Born with him when he cried First from the mother's womb;
- Like-aged with him it died, 600 Whon dawned his day of doom.
Needs must we loathe another dame, The bloody Scylla, known to fame,.
Who, lured by Minos' gifts of fine-wrought gold, Neck-gear from Crete,--devoid of shame, Nisos, her father, to his foemen sold.
Deep-breathing, free from care, In slumber while he by, Ruthless she cut th' immortal hair :
610 And Hermes seized his prey.
But since these direful woes have burst, †Untimely, into song:
— Be the foul wedlock too accursed, That doth this palace wrong.-
And cursèd be the plot that suarcd (By woman's brain devised,)
The armèd chief who foemen scared, Whom faithful lieges prized.
Dear is to me the unstained hearth, and dear
In woman's hand the unaudacious spear.
But first of woes in every clime, 620 The Lemnian is deplored;
—* And still the most detested crime As Lemnian is abhorred.
Branded with infamy by men,
The impious disappear;
For whom the righteous gods condemn, No mortal dares revere.-
The lore which thus we chant in choral strain, Say ye, doth Reason at her bar arraign ?
Right through the lungs doth Justice' hand Drive home the bitter steel;
G30 The majesty of Zeus they dared withstand, And to the ground, with reckless heel, Trampled his high command.
Firm based is Justice;
Fate of yoro Forged weapon for the blow;
Deep-souled Erinys cloth in time restore Th' avenger to his home, and, lo !
Of ancient blood he pays the score.[Knocking at the gate.
Boy, hear the knocking, at the outer gate ;
- 640 Who is within ?
Hola !
Again I call.—
For the third time I crave a parley here, If that Ægisthos heeds the stranger's rights.
Well, well, I hear.
Who art thou, friend, and whence?
Me to the rulers of this house announce, For unto them, bearer of news, I come.
Haste, for Night's dusky car rolls on apace, And timo it is for weary traveller Anchor to drop in hospitable homo.
Let one in trust, a woman bearing rule, 630 Come forth ;
yet moro decorous were a man.
For when by bash fulness the tougue is swayed Darkened is speech ;
—boldly man speaks to mau, And tells his message forth without reserve.[Exit Attendant.
Strangers, if aught ye need, say on, for here
Is whatsoe'er best em3 th halls like these;
- Warm baths, the easeful couch that charmeth toil, The welcome presence too of honest eyes.
But if your mission here doth counsel crave, 'Tis men's concern:
—we will inform them straight.
660From Phocis I, a Daulian, stranger here.-
What time my home I left, for Argos bound, Starting on foot, with baggage self-equipped, A man to me unknown, as I to him, Met me, inquired my route and told me his Strophios, the Phocian, as in talk I learned.
" Stranger," he said, “ since Argos is thy goal, Say to the parents,”—strictly mark my words,­ “ Dead is Orestes;
—grave it on thy mind;
—
Whether the counsel of his friends prevail 670 To bring him home, or give him sepulture, Alien for aye;
—bear thou their mandates back;
For now the brazen urn doth shroud from sight
The ashes of the hero duly wept."
Such words I heard, and tell thee ;
-if to those
Who here bear rule I speak, kin to the dead, I know not;
-but 'tis meet his sire should know.
Woe's me
Then are we utterly undone!
0 household Fury, hard to grapple with, How many, though aloof, thou visitest, Piercing with well-aimed arrows from afar, While wretched me thou hast stript bare of friends.
And now, Orestes, who, by lucky chance, His foot from ruin's slough had well-nigh freed, Cancels by death our cherished hope, sole cure
Of the ill revelry that reigneth here.
With hosts so richly dowered I fain had sought Acquaintance and kind cheer, as messenger Bearing more welcome tidings;
for what bond More friendly than of stranger to his hosts?
690 Yet not to consummate for friends a charge
So weighty, deemed I an impiety, By promise bound, and pledges of good-will.
Worthy regard not less shalt thou receive;
Nor have the less fair welcome to this house.
Another all the same had brought thy news.
But time it is that strangers who have made A day-long journey should their strength recruit.
[To an attendant.
To tho men's chambers usher him as guest;
His escort too, and follow-traveller.
700 There be they tended as bents this house.
Do yo my will as who must give account.
Ourselves will to the rulers of this house Impart the tidings, and not poor in friends, We will take counsel touching this mischance.
[Exeunt all except the Chorus.
Dear handmaidens!
Sisters dear!
When, oh when, full voiced and clear, Shall we, for Orestes' sake, Loud the joyous Pæan wake?
Hallowed Earth!
Oh shrine revered!
Funeral barrow high upreared, 710 O'er the naval hero-king, Now give ear, deliv'ranee bring!
Strikes the hour ;
-persuasive Guile Enters now the lists.
The while Hermes leads to watch the fight Of murd'rous swords and subtle wile, †Erinys, brood of Night.
This stranger, as it seems, is causing bale, For I behold Orestes' nurse in tears;
Where wendest thou, Kilissa, past the gates ?
Sorrow, I trow, unbidden goes with thee.
720My mistress bade me summon with all speed Ægisthos to the strangers, that he may More clearly learn, as man from man, this tale Newly announced.
Before the menial train,
She, at the tidings by these strangers brought, 'Neath mournful eyes a lurking smile hath veiled, Exulting in events joyous for her, But to this house with direst issue fraught;
-
But he no doubt will in his soul rejoice, Hearing the tale.
Alas!
unhappy me 730
How did the ancient troubles, hard to bear, Whose blended horror darkened Atreus' house, With anguish pierce my heart!
But ne'er before, Have I a sorrow like to this endured.
All other ills I patiently have borne, But dear Orestes, darling of my soul, Whom from his mother's womb I fondly reared, Whose piercing summons waked me up at night, And for whose sake full many a fruitless toil I bore ungrudging ;
-for like lamb unweaned, 740 The witless infant we perforce must rear According to its mood ;
—how otherwise!
For while in swathing-clothes no voice it bath, When pressed by hunger, thirst, or nature's call, But wilful is each tender organ's play.
Such wants presaging, ay, and oft deceived, As cleanser of his swaddling bands, I ween, Fuller and nurso bad common duty there.
I thus installed in double handicraft, Tho young Orestes for his father reared.
Oh wretched mo to hear that he is dead;
750 But now I go, the spoiler of this house To seek ;
-right gladly will he learn tho talc.
And how equipped doth she then bid him come ?
How ?
Speak again that I may clearly know.
Whether with body-guards, or all alone ?
Spear-bearing followers she bids him bring.
Bear not this message to our hateful lord.
But with all speed do thou with cheerful mien Bid him approach, that fearless he may hear ;
For crooked word the messenger makes straight.
760How!
art thou sound of mind such tidings hearing ?
But haply Zeus a change-wind may vouchsafe.
And how ?
Orestes gone, hope of the house.
Not yet!
Dull prophet might interpret here.
What!
knowest aught beyond what hath been told ?
Go, bear thy message.
Do as we enjoin,
What the gods purpose, that will they effect.
Well, go I will, obeying thy behest, Fair be the issue by the gift of Heaven!
Sire of Olympian gods, thy suppliant calls !
770
Oh waft propitious Fortune to these halls !
Dispensing justice with omniscient might, †Bless thou my longing sight!
This boon I crave!
Guard him, great Zeus, and savo!
Him, in these halls ancestral, place Before his foeman ;
-bring them face to face I Him if thou lift to greatness, Power divine, Requital double, three-fold, shall be thine.
Of him whom thou didst love behold the son 780 Orphaned, a colt harnessed in sorrow's trace;
†Set thou a limit to his toilsome race!
Grant him his course to run, With steps firm planted, and well-ordered pace!
You too, frequenting the recess tOf wealth-rejoicing homes, I now address;
Hear, ye consentient Gods!
Through bloody deed Retributive, wash out the gore, 790 Dread heirloom from those slain of yoro.
Let murder in this palace cease to breed, When paid the bloody score!
Thou tenant of the cave,-great Spirit, Give to the hero to inherit His halls ancestral ;
-may his eyes, Fearless and bright, Peer freely forth from sorrow's veilèd night.
†May Maia's son, well-versed in guile, Upon the righteous cause propitious smile !
800 Dark words and subtle speaking, he by night Men's eyes o'ercloudoth, nor by day More manifest his secret way.
Yet many a deed, in darkness veiled awhile, By him is brought to light.
The work achieved, we'll chant the glorious ode;
Our woman's strain, Propitious, with the mourners' stringed refrain, Shall ransom this abode.
†Then shall we own the sway of righteous laws, While Atè from our friends her curse withdraws.
810When the fierce business must be done, When in thine ear she whimpers forth, " My Son Steeling thy heart, invoke thy slaughtered sire, † And consummate unblamed the vengeance dire.
With heart of Perseus steadfast in thy breast, For the dear love Of friends below the earth, and friends above, †Complete the sacrifice;
— Within the house plant thou grim Death,-dire guest,- And let the murderer forfeit murder's price.
820Not uninvoked I come, but hither called;
—
For strangers, as I learn, are hero arrived, Bearers of news, unwelcome to our cars,- Orestes’ death,-which, charged upon this house, From former wound still ulcerate and sore, To me a burden were, dripping with fear.
But say,—theso tidings must I hold for true, Or rumours deem them, coined by women's fears, 830 That aimless cleavo the air, and aimless die?
Knowest thou aught that may my mind assure ?
Wo have but heard :
going thyself within, Question these strangers ;
—second-hand reports Avail not as to hoar tho tale oneself.
Fain would I see the messenger and learn
Whether himself was present at the death, Or if from blind report this tale he heard ;
A mind clear-sighted they will not deceive.[Exit into the palace.
Zeus, great Zeus, how frame my cry 810 Thine aid to win ?
How, invoking thee on high, My strain begin ?
For anon with murderous blow, Either shall the gory blade Atreus' royal house o'erthrow,— Prone in dust for ever laid,- Or in Freedom's sacred name, Kindling fire and holy light, Shall the rightful heir reclaim †Wealth and crown,-his twofold right.
850Sole against the tyrant pair, To such deadly grapple hies Agamemnon's godlike heir;
- None to follow if he dies !
* Crown, oh crown, the great emprizo!
Alas, woe's me !
Alas!
Hark !
Hark!
again !
How is't?
What's wrought within?
Stand we aloof while Slaughter does her work, That of these ills we guiltless may appear:
For now achieved the issue is of strife.
Oh woe I oh grievous woe!
our master's slain;
860 Yet once again, and for the third time, woe.
Ægisthos is no more.
—With utmost speodFling open now, and of the women's doors, The bars unloose;
full strength is needed here, Not for the slaiu;
what booteth aid to him?
Alas!
alas!
what, shout I to the deaf, Or clamour vainly in dull sleepers' ears?
What doeth Clytemnestra ?
Where is she?
Her neck it seems toncheth the razor's edgo;
Herself, ero long shall perish, justly slain.
S70Tho dead, I tell you, now tho living slays.
Alas!
of these dark words the sense I catch;
Through guile we perish, as through guile we slew.
Quick, bring a deadly axe ;
—[Exit Servant.
We'll see anon
Whether we vanquished are, or vanquisher ;
For to this crisis bath the evil come.
Thee too I seek,-he there bath had his due.
Dost love this man ?
With him, in the same tomb, 880 Then shalt thou lie ;
-still faithful found in death.
Hold!
hold!
my son;
—Revere, my child, this breast From which, a sleeping infant, thou full oft, With toothless gums, thy nurture-milk hast sucked.
Speak, Pylades;
—Through filial reverence, Shall I forbear to shed a mother's blood ?
The Pythian oracles, still unfulfilled, Where are they, and thine own firm-plighted vows ?
Choose all for foemen rather than the gods.
Thou hast prevailed;
wisely thou promptest me;
[To CLYTEMNESTRA.
So follow;
-by his side I thee would slay.
890 In life thou didst exalt him o'er my sire;
Since him thou lovest, sleep with him in death;
Whom thou wast bound to love thou didst abhor.
I nourished thee ;
-with thee I would grow old.
Thou, slayer of my father, dwell with me IFate was, my child, accomplice in these woes.
And Fate it is who cloth this death ordain.
Dost not a parent's curse revere, my child ?
My mother, thou didst cast mo forth for woo.
Not outcast wast thou in a friendly house.
900Sold doubly was I, scion of freo sire.
Where then the price for which I bartered thee ?
It shameth me, in sooth, to charge thee home.
But tell with mine the errors of thy sire.
Sitting at home blame not abroad who toils.
For wives 'tis grievous to live spouseless, child.
The husband's toil supports the wife at home.
Thy mother, 0 my child, art nerved to slay ?
Thyself art guilty of thy death, not I.Take heed, beware thy mother's vengeful hounds.
910Those of my sire how 'scape if thee I spare ?
Living, vain meanings to a tomb I pour.
Ay, for my father's fate doth work thy doom.
Ah me!
this snake it is I bare and reared.
True prophet was thy dream-engendered fear.
Him thou didst slay whom thou shouldst not have slain.
So doom unseemly suffer in thy turn.
E'en of this pair I weep the twofold woo.
But since Orestes hath the bloody height Achieved of dire revenge, one hope remains, Not quenched the eye of Atreus' royal house.
920Justice, in time, with heavy doom, Smote all of Priam's name ;
So Agamemnon, to thy homo, Twin Lions, twofold Ares, came:
Suppliant at Pythos' shrino, By oracles divine, Sped on his way, the exile wins the game.
Hail jubilant tho house redeemed from bale !
The godless pair no more Shall waste its gathered store.
930 Hail, joyous riddance, hail!
Subtle of soul, Requital came, Dark-veiled who joins the fight;
— Daughter of Zeus, whom mortals name Justice, their aim thus pointing right;
She with firm hand, the knife Unsheaths for mortal strife, While 'gainst her foes she breathes destruction's blight.
†For Loxias, the king, 940 Who in Parnassian cavern holds his seat, Doth vengeance hither bring, Guilelessly guileful;
lame, yet sure her feet.
Weighty the utterance ;
the power divine, No consort is of guilt;
needs must we pay Homage to His heaven-ruling sway.
Clearly the light doth shine!
tReft was I of the sun whose sudden ray Did with new joy illume
These halls, long sunk in gloom;
950 It gleamed,-then died away.†
Anon, the cheering light, New kindled, in this house -shall shine once more, What time, with lustral rite, From the polluted hearth is purged the gore, And Atè put to flight.
With form benign, Fortune, long time an alien, comes to claim Her home, redeemed from shame.
Clearly the light cloth shine!
Behold the tyrants of this land, the twain 960 My sire who murdered, and this palace reaved.
Majestic once sat they upon their thrones, United now, as by their fate appears, And faithful to their pledges, e'en in death.
Death to my wretched sire conjoined they swore, Conjoined to die;
—well have they kept their oath.
But further, ye who hearken to these woes, Mark this device, my wretched father's snare, His hands which fettered and his feet which yoked.
Unfold it,-form a ring,-and, standing near, 970 Display the Hero's death-robe, that the Sire, Not mine, but He who all these woes surveys, Helios, my mother's impious deeds may mark;
So in my trial, at some future time, He by my side may stand, and witness bear
That justly I did prosecute to death My mother ;
-for of base Ægisthos' doom Reeketh me not;
—he, as adulterer, The lawful forfeit of his crime hath paid.
But for tho woman who this snare devised Against tho husband, unto whom she boro
The tender weight of children 'neath her zone, Burden once dear, but now her deadly foe ;
980
What deem ye of her ?
Might she not have been A viper, or torpedo, which by touch Corrupteth where it bites not ?
true if judged For reckless daring and unrighteous will.
How name this thing, using well-omened words ?
Toil for wild beast, the laver's ghastly pall, Shrouding the dead man's feet ?
A net, a snare, Might'st call it, or a feet-entangling robe.
Such were some robber's gear, whose trade it is Strangers to dupe and plunder of their wealth;
While slaying many a one with such device, 990 With many a crime his seething brain might teem.
May no such woman house with me!
Ye gods, Devote me rather to a childless death!
Alas!
alas, for doings fraught with doom I A loathsome death has brought thee to the tomb.
Woe!
Woe!
To the survivor grief is but in bloom.
Did she the deed or not ? .
To me this robe Attests that she Ægisthos' sword imbrued;
Behold the death-stain tallies with the time 1003 Marring the broidered garment's varied dyes.
One while I praise my slaughtered sire, anon, As present at the scene I wail his death.
This robe invoking that achieved his doom, Deeds T lament, and woes, and all my race, Pollution reaping from this victory.
Alas !
alas !
no son of mortal race, Unscathed life's pathway to the end may trace.
Woe!
Woe!
Fadeth one grief, another comes apace.
That ye betimes may learn, (since I myself 1010 Know not the issue,) for as charioteer With steeds ungoverned, from the course I swerve;
Thoughts past control arc whirling me along, Their captive slave;
while terror in my heart Her pæan and her frenzied dance prepares.
Hear me, my friends, while Reason holds her seat;
With Justice' sanction I my mother smote, My father's slayer, a god-hated pest.
As prime incitement to the daring act Of Loxias I plead this oracle;
That, if I slew, blameless I should be held ;
1020
But if I failed my doom I will not speak ;
For bowshot cannot reach such mighty woe.
And now behold,—bearing this olive-branch, Enwreathed with wool, as suppliant I seck Earth's navel stone, Apollo's sent, where burns
The flame of fire, deathless that hath been named, Fleeing from kindred blood.
For other hearth Did Loxias forbid me to approach.
And let all Argive men, in after time, Bear witness for me how these woes were wrought;
Living, an exile from this land I roam;
Leaving behind, when dead, these fateful words.
Noble thy deed, then yoke not now thy mouth To bodeful speech, nor vent ill-omened words, Since thou, with lucky stroke lopping the head From serpent twain, all Argos' state hast freed.
Ah!
ah !
ye handmaids, Gorgon-like they come, Vested in sable stoles, their locks entwined With clustering snakes.
No longer may I bide.
Dearest of mortals to thy father, say, 1040
What fancies scare thee ?
Hold, yield not to fear.
To me no woe-engendered fancies these;
Too well I know my mother's vengeful hounds.
Still reeking is the blood upon thy hand, Hence is it that distraction smites thy brain.
Apollo lord!
swarming they press around, And from their eyes there drippeth loathsome gore.
One cleanser hast thou, cling to Loxias, He will uphold thee, and will free from bale.
These shapes ye see not, but I see them.
Lo, 1050
They drive me forth,-no longer can I bide.
[He rushes out.
But blessings on thee, and, in direst strait, May He who views thee graciously protect!
Now in Mycenae's royal halls,The storm, o'er Atreus' race that lowers, Running its course, for the third time hath burst.
Child-devouring horror first, Brooded o'er these walls ;
Next a monarch's deadly bale, When the chief whom we bewail, War-leader to Achaea's martial powers, 1060 In the bath lay dead.
Now, behold a third is come,- Saviour, shall I say, or doom ?
From what quarter sped?
Full-accomplished, when shall Fate, Lulled to rest, her stormy iro abate ?
THE text of this play, especially in the Choral Odes, is mani­ festly very corrupt, and the corruption may have been a thousand years earlier than any MS.
of it which came down to the age of printing.
The Greek Commentator, whom we call the Scholiast, is often puerile, and absurdly satisfied with a very erroneous text.
Thereby we are driven to con­ jectural improvement, if we are to attain a text worthy of the poet.
Some of the following suggestions, I believe, seemed to my friend Miss Anna Swan wick to deserve her acceptance.67.
ἰοὑσαν ἂτην all reject, μάτην meets general approval;
but we seem to need κλύσειεν ἂν μάτην before metre and sense are satisfied.
270.
Hermann has arbitrarily changed μειλίγματα (as­ suagements) into its opposite, μηνίματα, but πιφασκων is the faulty word.
The smallest available change is to place a comma after βροτοȋς (other mortals), and write πιφαύσκειν εἶπε τάσδε νῷν....
Here πιφαύσκειν means προφαίνειν, with a future idea as presently in ἐπαντέλλειν.368.
For ὀδυνα̑σαι, Dindorf has δύνασαι, but the sense requires οὐ δύνασαι.370.
For τω̑ν μὲν ἀρωγοὶ, which is unintelligible, I believe the poet wrote in continuation, δου̑πος ἱκνεȋται σφῷν μὲν ἀργὸν....
Even so it is quite unexplained what is the " double scourge."
Orestes complains of Penury, Electra of Dishonor.
These may well be the double misery which (says the Chorus) thou art unable [to avert].
To me a whole line seems lost, such as :
Thus δύνασαι has an infinitive ἀπείργειν to complete it, "To wish for lofty success is useless, when you cannot [even repel Penury and Insult]."
The crack of this double scourge reaches now your champion in the underworld.
"374.
παισὶ δὲ μα̑λλον γεγένηται is hopeless nonsense.
Μα̑λλον has nothing to compare.
Γεγένηται, " it has be­ come," has ucither Predicate nor Subject.
Neither word is here endurable.
I find nothing more probable than to write τέρμων for τούτων, With :
Στυγερω̑ν τέρμων | παισὶ δ ̓ ἁμιλλω̑ν πεπόνηται. " But for (or by) the children a limit of hateful contests has been hard-earned."
The unusual position of at, in the fourth place may have led to punctuating after τέρμων.
On this wouldfollow a general corruption.384-407.
Strophe and Antistrophe both corrupt.
In my notion :
-633.
A verb is lost to which the vulgate παρεκβάντες is nomin.
and τὸ μὴ θέμις πατεύμενον is accusative.
The particle οὐ makes sheer nonsense.
I propose, instead of it, the verb ὤλεσαν.
In the Antist. to contrast child and father, I imagine τέκνον 8' ἐπεισφέρει δόμοισι [τοȋς πατρὸς, χ ̓] αἱμάτων.
No one will say that πατρὸς is here superfluous, nor can any smaller change reconcile the metres.
773.
In this eminently corrupt Ode, nothing but audacity can succeed.
I propose:
795.
For ἀνιδεȋν, which cannot here be right, perhaps ἀναπνεȋν, gain respite.
801.
For κρύπτ ̓ ἄσκοπον 8', I require κρύφα μὲν εὓσκοπον δ ̓, giving right metre and sense.
803.
For ἐμφανέστερος, Schütz well writes ἐμφανέστεν.
χρῄζων is a superfluous word.
I think πολλά δἐ κἄλλα φαεȋ should close the 3rd antistrophe.
805.
The 4th and 5th are variously corrupt.
I believe in καὶ τότ ̓ ὠδὰν, κλυτὸν δωμάτων λύτρον- [Song, opposed to twanging of the lyre.]
I try further:
Τάδε nomin.
will mean " Songs and Music.”
No smaller changes can succeed ;
but the words εἴνουν ἔμοιγε are neces­ sarily very uncertain.
Vulg. d ἐμὸν
ἐμὸν.815. For περαίνων excellently Blomf. has πέαιν ̓ οὐκ.820. προπρα̑ξον χάριν αφαγα̑ς λυτη̑ρ
ος is a possible text.
In next line τιθεὶς can hardly he right.
The sense wanted is " from thy inmost heart venting rage.” καθεὶς or μεθεὶς is possible.
Paley's correction of φοινίαν ἄταν into φοινίαν ἄγαν (sanguinary rancour) quite commends itself.940-7 is terribly corrupt.
No one can make good sense, good structure, and good metre without grave changes.
I have proposed949.
A new enigma.
The word in brackets might be ποίμενα.
I do not believe it was.
It might be μείρακα;
but the edd.
give us ψάλιον.
I have imagined τάλιδα, equivalent to παρθένον, and here used of a young man, as παρθένον notoriously may be.
That the termination does not necessitate a feminine idea, we see in ψαλίδα.
Then for ψάλιον οἰκιῶνὰναγέμαν δόμοις, I suggest :

The PYTHONESS appears praying at an altar adorned with images of the successive divinities of the sanctuary.]F IRST, with this prayer, I honour of the gods * Earth, prophetess primeval;
Themis next, On this her mother's seat oracular Second who sat—for so tradition tells;
Third by decree of Fate, with her good will, Doing despite to none, took here her seat, Another power Titanian, child of Earth, Phoebe ;
she gave it as a birth-day gift To Phœbos, who from Phœbe takes his name.
Leaving the lake and Delos' rocky isle, At Pallas' ship-frequented shores he lands, 10 Then gains this region, these Parnassian seats;
Him onward speed, and mightily adore, Hephæstos’ sons, road-fashioners, who wrought, Taming for him the savage wilderness.
Him, when he comes, highly the people honour, King Delphos also, steersman of this land.
Zeus with prophetic art his mind inspired, And throned him on this sacred seat, fourth seer;
So Loxias* now is prophet of his sire.
These gods I worship with preluding prayers.
20 But be Pronæan ‡Pallas likewise hailed With words of honour !
you too I salute, Nymphs who frequent Korykia's caverned rock, Kindly to birds, and haunt of deities.
Bromios, full well I wis, the region holds, Since with his Thyads thence the god made war, And Pentheus coursed, like doubling hare, to death.
The founts of Pleistos, and Poseidon's might Invoking, and high-consummating Zeus, As prophetess I now assume this scat.
Beyond the past my entrance may they crown 30 With fair response I Arc sons of Hellas here,— Let them, as custom is, approach by lot, For as the god cloth guide, I prophesy.
Things dire to tell, direful for eyes to see, Have forced me from the fane of Loxias, So that no strength I have, no power to move;
But lacking speed of limb, with hands I run;
For age, when scared, is nought;
a very child.
Towards the wreath-encircled nook I creep, And at earth's navel-stone, behold a man 40 Defiled before the gods, as suppliant, Holding his seat ;
-his hands still dripping gore, His sword new-drawn, his lofty olive-branch With ample fillets piously enwreathed, White bands of wool ;
-for so I speak it plain.
But lo!
before this man, on seats reclined, A wondrous company of women sleeps ;
Women ?
nay, Gorgons let me say;
nor yet To Gorgonean types compare I them.
Ere now in paintings [Harpies]
I have seen, Snatching the meal of Phineus.
These to sight 50 Are wingless, black, and loathsome utterly.
With breathings unapproachable they snore, Forth from their eyes drippeth a loathsome rheum;
Their garb too vile the effigies to touch
Of gods immortal, or the roofs of men.
Tribe of this sisterhood I ne'er have seen;
Neither may region boast such brood to rear Scathless, unvisited by penance-throo.
But for the issue, let lord Loxias, Mighty, who rules these seats, himself provide;
60 For prophet-leech, and portent-seer is he, Who can for others purify their homes.
[Exit PYTHONESS.
I'll ne'er betray thee:
to the end thy guard, Beside thee standing, or when far aloof;
Nor will be gracious to thy enemies.
And captured now this maddened crew thou seest.
By sleep the loathsome virgins are o'erpowercd, Hoary primeval progeny,-with whom Nor god, nor man, nor beast, will e'er consort.
70 For Evil's sake brought forth, in evil gloom
Of subterranean Tartaros they dwell, Abhorred of men and of Olympian gods.
But hio thee hence, nor o'er relax thy speed, For as thou tread'st the wand'rer-trampled earth, They'll track thee o'or the ample continent, O'er the wide ocean and the citied isles ;
And faint thou not nor fail before the time, O'er this toil brooding;
hie to Pallas city;
As suppliant her ancient image clasp.
There having judges of thy cause, and words SO Of suasive power, some means we shall devise For evermore to free thee from these toils;
For at my bidding was thy mother slain.
Apollo lord, justice full well thou knowest;
Since then thou knowest, learn to practise it.
Of good success thy might is warranty.
Remember, nor let fear unnerve thy mind.
[To HERMES.
But thou, true brother mine, blood of my sire, Hermes, protect him ;
-faithful to thy name, Be thou his escort, shepherding this man, 90 My suppliant;
for Zeus himself reveres
The sacred right of outlaws, which to mortals From thy safe convoy cometh, Fortune's boon.[Exit ORESTES, conducted by HERMES.
Sleep on !
Ho there !
what need of sleepers here ?
But I by you, among the other dead, Dishonoured thus, from them the keenest taunts, For his sake whom I slew, must needs endure.
In deep disgrace I wander;
—this I tell you, Reproach among the shades forsakes me not;
Dire evil I have borno from those most dear, 100
And yet for me, by matricidal hands Ruthlessly slain, no god is moved to wrath.
Behold these direful heart-wounds, whence they came, For clear in sleep the vision of the mind, While unforeseen by day the fate of men.
Full many gifts of mine have ye lapped up;
Wineless libations, sober, soothing rites, And feasts, I offered on the sacred hearth, At dead of night, the hour no god may share.
All these down-trampled now I must behold.
110 But gone is he, escaping like a fawn, And, lightly bounding o'or tho hunter's net, At you ho mocked, with many a scornful jeer.
Hear ye, how, pleading for my life, I speak.
Awake, dread demons of the lower world;
For Clytemnestra calls you, I, a dream.[Moaning.]
Moan on, but gono tho man, flying far off;
For him are patron-gods, though not for me.[Moaning.]
By sleep oppressed, thou piticst not my woo, His mother's murderer, Orestes, flies.
120Dost groan, dost sleep, nor on the instant rise ?
What have ye done except to work me bale ?
Slumber and toil, worthy conspirators, Have sorely wasted the fell dragon's might.
[Redoubled and shrill groans.
]
In dreams dost track the game, yelping amain, Like hound that never intermits the chase.
What dost thou ?
Rise, be not subdued by toil, Nor yet, relaxed by sleep, to grief be blind.
By just reproaches let thy heart be stung, 130 For to the prudent sharp they are as goads.
†But on thy quarry wafting gory breath, Scorch him with fiery vapour from thy maw ;
—
Chase hard, with second coursing wear him down.
Awake I Awaken her, as I wake thee!
Sleep est thou still ?
Arise, and slumber spurn;
Then try we whether vain our prelude be.1 st Fury.
Woo! woo!
alack !
Friends, wo have suffered scorn.
2. Much have I suffered and in vain.2. Burst from the toils, fled is the game away.
3.
By sleep o'ermastered I have lost the prey.
4.
Fic!
Son of Zeus I Thou thievish art, I trow;
4.
This godless wight, bitter to parents, thou As suppliant dost own.5.
A god the matricide has filched away.
6.
That aught herein is just will any say ?7.
Voice of reproachful blame, to me in dreams that came 150 Smote me, like charioteer with scourge grasped tight, 'Neath heart and reins.
Such chilly pang I8.
know †As from the public scourger's ruthless blow.
9.
The upstart doings these of younger deities, Usurping power beyond the sway of right.
†Dark-smeared from foot to crown, earth's10.
navel-stone 160 Blood's horrible defilement now doth own.
11, 12. But Thou, the seer, with hearth-stain hast thy shrine Polluted, self-invited, self-impelled;
Revering mortal things 'gainst law divine The Fates thou hast dishonoured, grey with eld.13, 14.
†Me while he plagues, himself he shall not free;
A captive still, though under earth he fled, For, stained with blood, another after me, †Avenger stern, shall light upon his head.
A vaunt, I charge thee, leave these hallowed scats;
170 Depart with speed from this prophetic shrine, Lest thou,-by wingèd glistering snake transfixed, Shot from this golden-twisted cord,-through pain, Shouldst vomit forth black gore, the clots disgorging Which thou from slaughtered men hast ruthless sucked.
Thee it befits not to approach these seats, But where head-lopping, eye-outscooping rage, With vengeance that doth sap youth's vital powers, Where slaughters, mutilations, stonings reign, 180 And where impaled, wretches with cruel throes Groan forth their anguish.
These the feasts ye love, And therefore are ye hateful to the gods.
Your whole aspect attests it,-such should dwell
In blood-gorged lion's den, not tarry hero Bringing pollution to these hallowed seats.
Begone, ye grisly troop, unshepherded, For to such flock no heavenly power is kind.
Apollo lord, do thou in turn give car ;
No mero accomplico art thou in theso ills;
190 Rather of all, solo author thou, solo cause.
How so I To greater length extend thy speech.
The stranger thou didst prompt to matricide.
To avenge his sire I prompted him;
why not ?
With promise this new bloodshed to defend.
And bade him seek as suppliant this shrine.
And these, his escort, thou forsooth revilest.
Because not meet their presence for these seats.
Yet unto us hath been assigned this charge.
What function this ?
Extol thy fair employ.
200All mother-slayers from their homes we chase.
How if the wife her husband should have slain ?
Not one in blood were she with him she slew.
Greatly thou dost misprise and set at nought
The nuptial bond of Hera and of Zeus;
Dishonoured too is Kypris by these words, From whom to mortals come their dearest joys ;
For, under Justice' shield, tho nuptial couch, 'Twixt man and wife the heaven-appointed bond, Is mightier than oath ;
to wedded pair, When one slays other, if thou lenient be, 210 These not pursuing with keen-sighted wrath, Not justly then Orestes thou dost chase For thee, right earnest in his case I find, But openly in hers more mild in sooth.
But Pallas shall both sides with justice scan.
Never will I desist this man to ehaso.
Pursue him then, prolong thy fruitless toil.
Claim not by word my honours to abridge.
Honours like thino I would reject with scorn.
For great thy rank before tho throne of Zeus.
220 But I, led on by mother's blood, this man To death will chase;
I follow on his track.[Exit Chorus.
But I will aid, will save, the fugitive;
For dire with men and gods the suppliant's wrath, If I his cause should willingly betray.
Athena, Queen, at Loxias' best I'm come;
A wretched outcast graciously receive, Not blood-polluted, nor with hands unclean, For blunted now and worn the edge of crime
At other homes, and in the paths of men.
230 Holding my course alike o'er land and sea, Faithful to Loxias' word oracular, I to thy fane am come, thy image, goddess, Here keeping guard, I will abide my doom.
'
Tis well;
sure token this, the man is here.
Follow the leading of this voiceless guide;
For still we track, as hound the wounded fawn, By blood and reeking drops, our destined prey;
Spent with full many man-outwearing toils, Pant my deep vitals, for on every spot
Of the wide earth my charge I shepherded, 240 And now in hot pursuit with wingless flight Swift as swift galley o'er the sea I course;
Here in some nook ensconced, crouching he lies;
Of human blood the odour gladdens me.
1, 2. Look here!
Look thero !
Peer everywhere;
Lest, scathless in flight, illuding our sight, The matricide 'scape unaware.3, 4. Ho refuge hath found ;
With arms twined around
The goddess immortal, this murderous wight A verdict now seeks through her aid 'gainst tho right.
2505, 6. But baseless his trust;
Mother's blood from the dust
Is hard to recover ;
-once shed on tho plain, The life-blood is gone, it returns not again.
7, 8. Lo, suffer thou must
In requital most just, And I tho red clot from thy members will drain.a, 10.
Tho foul draught I'll taste, Thy strength I will waste, Then drag thee still living to regions below, The forfeit to pay for thy mother's death-blow.
11, 12.
There thou shalt see in durance drear, 'Gainst god or guest or parents dear, 260 Like thee who sinned, receiving their due meed.13,14.
For Hades, ruler of the nether sphere, Exactest auditor of human kind, Graved on the tablet of his mind Doth every trespass read.
To me, long disciplined in woe, are known Divers lustrations;
when to speak I know, When to be silent;
but in present need By sapient teacher I was charged to speak.
The blood now sleepeth, fading from my hand;
270 Washed clean away the matricidal stain;
For while yet fresh, by rites of slaughtered swine, At Phœbos' altar it was duly purged ;
— Tedious the tale, were I to reckon o'er How many fared with me nor suffered harm.
Time, waxing old, doth all things purify;
Now, with pure lip, I piously invoke Athena, of this region queen, to come, My pleader:
so she weaponless shall earn Myself, my realm, and all the Argive host, 280 Honestly true, allies for evermore.
But whether on the Libyan plain, beside Her natal Triton wave, she stand erect, Or sit, with foot enveloped, to her friends Dispensing aid ;
-or on Phlegraian fields, Like warlike leader, marshal her array,- Oil may she come (a goddess hears from far), And be my saviour from these miseries.
Thee nor Apollo, nor Athena's might Can save from perishing, an outcast, spurned ;
290 With heart of joy oblivious, thou shalt pine, The Furies' blood-sucked victim, a mere shade.-
How !
no reply!
Dost thou oontemn my words, Thou, fattened for me, thou, my victim doomed, Slain at no altar, but my living prey ?—
Our hymn, as chain to bind thee, thou shalt hear.
Haste we now the dance to wind, Since beseems in dread refrain, To utter how our bodeful train 300 Deal the lots to mortal kind.
Loyal arc we to the Right ;
- Whosoc'er clean hands extendeth, Not on him our wrath may light, Scathless still through life he wendeth.
But when wretch, like yonder wight, Gory hands to hide is fain, Blood-avengers,— for tho slain True witnesses,—still lurking near,— His doom at length completing, wo appear.
310Oil mother, hear me, Mother Night, Who brought me forth, a living dread, To scare the living and the dead, Latona's son does me despite ;
-
Stealing away my trembling prey, Destined a mother's murder to requite.
Thus o'er the victim chant we our refrain, Frenzy's dread carol, madness-fraught, The Furies' hymn, from Hades brought, Soul-binding, lyreless, mortal-blighting strain.
For Fate unswerving span, that we 320 This office hold for evermore:
— Mortals imbrued with kindred gore
We chase, till under earth they flee;
And when in death they yield their breath, Not e'en in realm of Hades are they free.
Thus o'er the victim chant we our refrain, Frenzy's dread carol, madness-fraught, The Furies' hymn, from Hades brought, Soul-binding, lyreless, mortal-blighting strain.
For even at birth Fate assigned our career 330 Apart from the gods;
—we approach not their sphere;
Our banquets they share not, White garments we wear not, Men's homes to destroy is the Furies' employ.
When Ares in strife Robs a brother of life, †Relentless, the blood-dripping caitiff we chase;
-
Though girded with strength, he must falter at length, And falls, overpowered in the race.
No partner brook wé in our time-honoured cares, 340 †Nor share with the gods jurisdiction nor prayers.
For, us,—the detested,- Blood-stained, sable-vested, High Zeus from his hall did exclude one and all.
So downward we stoop
On our foo with fell swoop, And crush him with heavy footfall where he lies;
†These limbs overthrow both the swift and the slow;
Once prostrate, our victims ne'er rise.
350Men's glory, though beneath the sky Proudly august, below tho earth Dwindles dishonoured, nothing worth, Before our dark-stoled company, What time in bodeful dance, untired, our feet we ply.
Through ovil blind, tho wretch, though prone, Knows not his fall;
for dark tho cloud That toth tho guilty mind o'ershroud;
And Fame proclaims with heavy groan, The doom, like murky cloud, that wraps a house o'erthrown.
For such Fate's decree :
-awful ministers we,— 360 Keen-eyed to conceive what untired we achieve ;
tOf crime ever mindful, obdurate to prayer, Apart from the gods our loathed mission we bear;
- To living and dead, 'neath our sunless torch-ray, Dark and rugged our way.
Who then without fear among mortals can hear My Fate-sanctioned law, and who quail not with awe, Mine office thus learning, my god-given right ?
For not with dishonour I wield my dread might, Although my hoar mission, in darkness profound, I hold 'neath the ground.
A voice I heard from far Scamander's banks Invoking me, what time the land I claimed,- Fair portion of the booty, spear-achieved, Which chiefs and leaders of Achaia's host Apportioned, root and branch, for ever mine, To Theseus' sons a chosen heritage.
380 Thence have I come, urging unwearied feet
Of prime young coursers harnessed to my car;
My swelling Ægis rustling, without wings.
And now, beholding here these uncouth guests, I fear not, yet the marvel takes mine eye.
Who are ye ?
I address myself to all, To you and also to this stranger here, Who as a suppliant at mine image sits.
But no begotten race do ye resemble, Neither of goddesses by gods beheld, Nor in similitude of mortal shapes;
- 390 But to speak ill of those who harm us not Reason forbids, and Justice stands aloof.
Daughter of Zeus, all shalt thou hear in brief.
The progeny of ancient Night are we, " Curses " yclept in homes beneath the earth.
I know your lineage and the names ye bear.
My honours also quickly shalt thou learn.
Mine cars are open, bo tho word but plain.
'Tis ours men-slayers from their homes to chaO.
And to tho slayer's flight what goal is fixed?
400Where to rejoice not is th' appointed doom.
And to this bourn thou houndest now this man ?
Yea, for he chose his mother's blood to shed.
Urged by no mandate whose strong dread he feared ?
Where is the goad should urge to matricide ?
Two parties plead, one only have I heard.
But neither will he take nor tender oath.
Repute of justice, not just act, thou wishest.
How ?
Tell me.
For no lack of wit is thin3.
By oaths win not unjust success, I say.
410Question then put, and rightful verdict give.
Leave ye to me the ruling of the cause ?
Why not?
just homage just regard requites.
What wilt thou, stranger, to this charge reply ?
Thy land, thy race, and thy misfortunes tell, And then ward off the blame thus cast on thee.
If, trusting in the right, thou thus dost sit Clasping mine image, near my sacred shrine, Ixion-like, a suppliant revered,- To all these queries give me clear reply.
420Athena queen !
matter of grave import First will I from thy closing words remove.
Not blood-polluted am I, nor doth stain Cleave to thine image from thy suppliant's hand.
Sure proof of this will I adduco;
—'tis law That voiceless lives the man defiled by blood, Till purifier's hand bath him besprent With victim's blood, slain in life's budding prime.
Long since in other homes have been performed, With victims aud with streams, these lustral rites.
430 Thus then this care, as cancelled, I dismiss.
My lineago, what it is, thou soon shalt hear.
Argivo am I, my siro thou knewest well, Marshal of naval heroes, Agamemnon, In leaguo with whom thou madest Ilion, Troia's proud city, and uncited waste.
Returning home, ho without honour perished;
For him, my mother, black of soul, hath slain, Wrapt in her subtle toils, which witness bare
To the foul murder in the layer wrought.
Myself, long time an exile, coming home, Slew her who bare me,—I deny it not,- Avenging my dear father, blood for blood,- And sharer in the blame is Loxias, Who goads of anguish to my heart announced, Unless the guilty found from me their due.
My deed, or just, or unjust, do thou judge ;
-
Whate'er thy verdict, I shall be content.
Too grave the cause for mortal to adjudge, Nor is it lawful for myself to try A suit of murder freighted with sharp wrath.
450 Moreover, though, all needful rites performed, My shrine thou visitest as suppliant, Harmless and pure;
yet in my city's cause, Hurtful to it, I claim, thou shalt not be.
For these hold functions hard to set aside, And not triumphant in their suit, henceforth, The poison of their hate, falling to earth, Will to this land breed dire and cureless plague.—
So stands the matter ;
-each alternative, For them to stay, for me to banish them, Is mischief-fraught, nor know I remedy.
But since this weighty cause hath lighted here, 460 Judges of murder, bound by oath, I'll choose,- Solemn tribunal for all future time.
But for yourselves call witnesses and proofs,- Sworn evidence collect to aid your suit;
And having from my townsmen culled the best, Them will I set, truly to judge this cause, Sworn nought to utter adverse to the Right.
Subversion born of upstart laws Will anarchy and discord breed, If he the matricidal deed Who wrought, prevail, and win the cause.
Such verdict shall to reckless crime Embolden mortals ;
-through all time Murder, henceforth, unchecked shall reign, 470 And parents perish, by their children slain.
For as on evil deeds no more Fierce anger from this frenzied train, Keen watch o'er mortals who maintain, Shall steal full surely, as of yoro;
— To murder I will give tho rein.
Who tells his neighbour's sorrow o'er, 480 †Shall hear in turn Griefs anguished moan ;
Who comforts other's woo, himself must groan.
Let none, 'neath Sorrow's stroko Writhing, our aid invoke, Pleading with anguished moan, " O Justice, Justice, 0 Erinys' throno !”
Some father thus may wail, Some mother smit with bale, Vainly, since Justice' altar lieth prone.
490†Throned in the heart let Awe, Guardian of sacred law, There hold her stedfast reign !
Well earned is wisdom at the cost of pain.-
But who in blithesome cheer
That lives, absolved from Fear, Or man, or State, will Justice long revere?
Neither life by law unblest, 500 Nor by tyrant yoke opprest, Sanction thou ;
- All extremes the gods detest;
They the golden mean, I trow, Stamp with might.
The truth I speak Weighty is.
Defiant scorn
Is from godless folly born ;
While from inward health doth flow, Beloved of all, true bliss which mortals seek.
This, the sum of wisdom, hear;
- 510 Justice' altar aye revere, Nor ever dare, Lusting after worldly gear, With atheist foot to spurn;
beware, Lurketh Retribution near, Direful issue cloth impend;
Honour then with holy fear Thy parents,-household rights revere, Nor guest-observing ordinance offend.
But who unforced, with spirit free 520 Dares to be just, is ne'er unblest;
Whelmed utterly he cannot be:
But for tho wretch with lawless breast, Bold seizer of promiscuous prey,- I warn you,—he, perforce, his sail In time shall strike, when troubles him assail, And breaks his yard-arm, Death the tempest's sway.
He cries, but mid the whirlpool's roar None heeds him ;
for the gods deride, † Eyeing tho boaster, proud no more, 530 Struggling amid the surging tide ;
Shorn of his strength he yields to Fate ;
—
The capo lie weathers not, but thrown On Justice' sunken reef, with precious freight, He perisheth for aye, unwept, unknown.
Herald, proclaim !
Hold back tho multitude, Let Tyrrheno trumpet, filled with mortal breath, Piereing tho welkin with sonorous blast, Ring out its brazen summons to the crowd:
For, while this council-hall the jurors fill, 540 Silence to keep availeth, and to learn (Yea, the whole city and this stranger too)
What laws for time eternal I ordain;
So may the cause be righteously adjudged.
Apollo lord, rule thou thine own domain;
-
In this affair say, what concern hast thou ?
Twofold my errand here.
As witness, first:
For this man at my shrine is suppliant, Guest of my hearth;
by me from murder cleansed.
Also I come as pleader in his cause;
For of his mother's death-blow mine the blame.
550Now, as thy wisdom prompteth, open thou The trial, Pallas:
legalize the suit.[To the Chorus.'Tis yours to speak ;
-thus I commence the suit.
Since that the plaintiff, taking first the word, To state the argument may justly claim.
Though we be many, brief shall be our speech.[To ORESTES.
Do thou in turn make answer, word for word :
—
And first declare,—didst thou thy mother slay ?
I slow her, nor have e'er denied the deed,Thus of three wrestling-bouts the first is ours.
Not prostrate he o'er whom this vaunt thou makest.
560Behoveth thee to tell how thou didst slay.
This hand, my drawn sword wielding, smote her neck.
By whom persuaded, and by whose advice ?
By Phœbos’ words:
he witnesseth for me.
How?
did the prophet counsel matricide?
Certes,—nor thus far havo I blamed my lot.
Caught by tho vote, anothor tuno thou'lt sing.
Faith havo I:
from the tomb my sire will aid.
Good:
having slain thy mother, trust the dead !
Polluted was she with a twofold stain.
670How!
To the jurors make the matter clear.
Slaying her husband, she my father slew.
But thou art living,—she through death is free.
Her while she lived, why didst thou not pursue ?
Not of one blood was she with him she slew.
But am I with my mother one in blood ?
Thee 'neath her zone she nourished;
—blood-stained wreteh, A mother's dearest blood dost thou disown ?
Now bear me witness and expound for me, Apollo, whether I with justice slew.
580 The deed, as wrought, we do not disavow;
-
But whether justly shed, or not, this blood, Judge thou, that answer I may make to these.
To you, Athena's great tribunal, now Justly I'll speak;
a prophet may not lie ;
-
Ne'er from my throne prophetic spake I aught Either of man, of woman, or the state, Which Zeus, Olympian sire, hath not ordained.
Learn ye how potent is the plea I urge ;
—
The Father's will I charge you to obey ;
590 For oaths are not of greater force than Zeus.
Zeus, as thou sayest, gave this oracle, And bade Orestes here, his father's death Avenging, to despise a mother's rights.
Unlike the case, when dies a highborn man, Richly adorned with sceptres Heaven-bestowed, Dies too by woman's craft, not slain in war By Amazon's far-shooting, eager bow, But Pallas, as thyself shalt hear, and these Who sit, by ballot to adjudge this cause.
600 For when from distant warfare ho returned, With fair successes crowned, receiving him With friendly welcome, she, tho while ho bathed, The laver curtain’d o'or, from head to foot, Then, tangled in inextricable mazo Of broidor'd garment, she her husband smites.
As I have told you, such the horo's death, By all revered, marshal of naval hosts;
-
Her thus I signalize, their hearts to prick
Who here have mission to decide this cause.
A father's death Zeus honours,-so thou sayest,- 610 Yet he his father, aged Kronos, chained:
-
How prove this deed not adverse to thy word ?
Here I invoke you, judges, to give heed.
Oh hateful progeny, of Heaven abhorred !
Fetters he might unloose,-this ill bath cure, And yields to many a method of release.
But when the dust bath once the blood sucked up
Of murdered man, he riseth never more.
No charm for that, my father bath ordained, Who all things else upturneth as he will, 620 Nor with the toil panteth his mighty heart.
Beware of voting for this man's escape.
Shall he, a mother's kindred blood who shed, Dwell safe in Argos, in his father's house ?
What altars of his people may he touch ?
How share the lustral water with his tribe ?
Thus I declare, learn ye how just my words.
Not mother of her so-called child is she, Who bears it ;
—she is but the embryo's nurse;
He who begets is parent;
she for him, 630 As stranger for a stranger, rears the germ, Unless the god should blight it in the bud.
Sure warrant of my word I will adduce;
-
Without a mother may a father be;
Witness this daughter of Olympian Zeus, Not nurtured in the darkness of the womb, Yet such a scion goddess never bare.
In will, in action, Pallas, be it mine Thy city and thy people to exalt.
This man I sent, a suppliant to thy shrine, That faithful ho might be for evermore.
640 That, goddess!
thou for allies mightest win Him and his after-race, and that these pacts
Might last eternal, blessed by men unborn.
I do command you, as your judgment leads, Just verdict give,-of pleadings now enough.
By us in sooth our shafts have all been shot, The issue of the cause I wait to hear.
How may I rulo tho cause, unblamed by you ?
Ye heard what yo have heard ;
-now in your hearts, Your oaths revering, strangers, give your votes.
650Hear yo my statute, men of Attica,— Ye who of bloodshed judge this primal cause.
And for the host of Ægeus shall abide
This court of jurors, sacred evermore.
The Hill of Ares this, of Amazons
The seat and camping ground, what time of old, In hate of Theseus, waging war they came, And 'gainst this city, newly fortified, A counter-fortress for themselves upreared.
To Ares they did sacrifice, and hence
This rock is titled Areopagus.
Here then shall sacred Awe, and Fear, her kin, 660 By day and night my lieges hold from wrong, Save if themselves do innovate my laws.
With influx base or mud, if thou defile
The sparkling water, thou no drink shalt find.
Nor Anarchy, nor Tyrant's lawless rule Commend I to my people's reverence ;
—
Nor let them from their city banish Fear For who 'mong men, uncurbed by fear, is just ?
Thus holding Awe in seemly reverence, 670 A bulwark for your state shall ye possess, A safeguard to protect your city-walls, Such as no mortals other-where can boast, Neither in Scythia, nor in Pelops' realm.
Behold!
This court august, untouched by bribes, Sharp to avenge, wakeful for those who sleep, Establish I, a bulwark to this land.
This charge, extending to all future time, I give my lieges.
Meet it is ye rise, Assume the pebbles, and decide the cause, Your oath revering.
All hath now been said.
680This sisterhood, oppressive to the land, My council is that ye in no wise shame.
And I enjoin you, fear mine oracles ;
From Zeus they issue, fruitless make them not.
Usurping championship of bloody suit, No longer shall thine oracles be pure.
Did then my Father towards Ixion err, Who first as blood-stained suppliant, sued for aid ?
Say on!
but I, defrauded in my suit, In turn will haunt the land, dread visitant.
690Alike of younger and of older gods
Art thou unhonoured.
I the cause shall win.
So whilom wroughtest thou in Pheres’ house, Moving tho Fates mortals from death to free.
Was it not just my votary to aid, Then chiefly in his hour of sorest need?
But thou the prime allotments didst o’errule With wine deluding the hoar goddesses.
But thou, full soon, defeated in thy suit, Wilt spew thy venom, harmless to thy foes.
700Since thou, young god, o'erridest my hoar age, The issue I await with list’ning ear, And doubtful stay my wrath against the town.
With me it rests to give the casting vote, And to Orestes I my suffrage pledge.
For to no mother do I owe my birth ;
In all, save wedlock, I approve the male, And am, with all my soul, my father's child.
Nor care I to avenge a woman's death
Who slew her husband, guardian of the house.
710 Orestes, judged by equal votes prevails.-
The pebbles now pour quickly from the urns, Judges, to whom this office is assigned.
Phœbos Apollo, how will end this suit?
0
Night, dark mother, seest thou these things ?
The noose awaits me, or to see the light.
Ruin for us, or firm prerogative.
Now strangers, count the pebbles with due care ;
And while yo tell them o'er, let justice reign;
Lack of right judgment breedeth mighty woe, 720 The while one suffrago hath a house restored.
This man acquitted is from charge of blood, For equal are the numbers of the votes.
Hail Pallas !
Hail thou saviour of my house !
Me, when bereft of my paternal land, Thou leadest homo:
Imply somo Greek will say, “ The man an Argivo is once more, and dwells
On his paternal heritage, by aid Of Pallas, and of Loxias, and Him, Third Saviour, mighty consummator, Zeus,”— Who, honouring my father's death, saves mo, 730 Beholding these my mother's advocates.
Now to my native Argos I depart, Pledged to this country and thy lieges hero
By oath to be revered for evermore, That never helmsman of the Argive State Shall hither bear the well-appointed spear.
For we, ourselves, though couching in the grave, On those who violate these present oaths
By sore perplexities will work, and send In march despondency, in crossing streams 740 Omens averse, till they repent their toil.
But tuto those who keep this pledge, and honour Athena's city with confederate spear, To them will we be gracious evermore.
Hail goddess, and these city-wardens, hail!
Still may your gripe be fatal to your foes,
While victory and safety crown your spear.
1. Ye upstart gods, time-honoured laws Down-riding, ye have seized my prey.2.
But I, dishonoured, stung by grief, 750 Woe, woe, my torture to allay, On all the ground, will cast around Venom, whose baleful drops shall cause
Where it doth light a sterile blight, Fatal alike to germ, to leaf.
The pest, 0 Justice, scouring o'er the plain, Shall fling abroad its man-destroying stain.3.
I groan anew ;
what dare ?
what do ?
My pangs the citizens shall rue;
Alas, most wretched are thy daughters, Night !
Enduring this dishonourable slight.
760Be moved by me to stay these heavy groans;
Not vanquished are ye, nor to your disgrace Fell justice, equal-voted, from the urn.
Besides from Zeus clear oracles were sent,
And he who uttered them himself avouched, Orestes for this deed should know no scath.
Hurl not your heavy wrath upon this laud ;
Your rage abate, cause not sterility, Nor rain your poison-drops, like venomed darts, Ruthless devourers of each tender germ.
770 For I most righteously do promise you Both sanctuaries and shrines in this just land;
Seated at hearths with unctuous off’rings fed, And held in honour by my lieges here,1.
Ye upstart gods, time-honoured laws Down-riding, ye have seized my prey.

But I, dishonoured, stung by grief, Woe, woe, my torture to allay, On all the ground, will cast around Venom, whose baleful drops shall cause 7S0 Where it doth light a sterile blight, Fatal alike to germ, to leaf.

I groan aucw;
what dare?

My pangs the citizens shall rue;
Alas, most wretched are thy daughters, Night!
Enduring this dishonourable slight.
Not slighted are ye, powers august!
through rage Curse not with hopeless blight the abode of man.
I too on Zeus rely;
why speak of that?
790
And sole among the gods I know the key
That opes the halls where sealèd thunder sleeps.
But such we need not.
Be appeased by me, Nor scatter o'er the land, from froward tongue, The harmful seed that turneth all to bane.
Of bitter rage lull ye the murky wave;
Be venerated here and dwell with me.
Sharing the first fruits of this ample realm, For children offered, and for nuptial rite, This word of mine thou wilt for ever praise.
8001.
That I should suffer this, oh Fio !2.
That, old in wisdom, I on earth should dwell Dishonour'd !
Fie!
Debasement vile!3.
Rage I breathe forth, and wrath no stint that knows.
6. Hear, Mother Night, my passion.
7. Mark for scorn,
By crafty gods deluded, held for nought, Of ancient honour I am basely shorn.
I'll bear thine anger, for mine elder thou, 810 And wiser art, in that regard, than I.
Yet me, with wisdom, Zeus not meanly dowers.
But ye, if now ye seek some alien soil, Will of this land enamoured be;
of this Yon I forewarn ;
for onward-flowing time Shall these my lieges raise to loftier fame ;
And thou, in venerable seat enshrined Hard by Erectheus' temple, shalt receive Honours from men and trains of women, such As thou from other mortals ne'er may'st min.
But cast ye not abroad on these my realms, 820 To waste their building strength, whetstones of blood, Evoking frantic rage not born of wine ;
Nor, as out-plucking hearts of fighting-cocks, Plant ye among my townsmen civil strife, Reckless of kindred blood ;
let foreign war Rage without stint, affording ample scope For him who burns with glury's mighty rage.
No war of home-bred cocks, I ween, is that!
Such terms I proffer, thine it is to choose;
Blessing and blest, with blessèd rites revered, 830 To share this country dear unto the gods.

7. Mark for scorn,

810I will not weary to entreat thee fair ;
For ne'er with justice shalt thou urge the plaint, That thou, the elder deity, by me
The younger, and these city-guarding men, Wert, like an outcast, banished from the land.
But if Persuasion's power ye hold in awe,— The charm and honeyed sweetness of my tongue, Tarry thou must;
but if thou wilt not tarry, Not justly wouldst thou on this city hurl Revenge, or wrath, or do my people wrong ;
For thine it is to share with me this land, 850 In aye-enduring honour justly held.
Athena, queen, what seat dost offer me ?
One where no sorrow scathes.
Receive it thou!
No house unblest by thee shall henceforth thrive.
This wilt thou do ?
endow me with such might ?
Ay, and will prosper him who worships thee.
Wilt thou sure warrant give me for all time ?
I may not pledge what I will not perform.
Thine utterance soothes me;
—I relax my wrath.
860Established here thou wilt be rich in friends.
What blessings shall we hymn for this thy land?
Such as, with gracious influence, from earth, From dew of ocean, and from heaven, attend On conquest not ignoble.
That soft airs, With sunshine blowing, wander o'er the land ;
That earth's fair fruit, rich increase of the flocks, Fail not my citizens for evermore, With safety of the precious human seed ;
— But, for the impious,-wood them promptly out.
870 For I, like one who tendeth plants, do love
This race of righteous men, by grief unscathed :
—
Such be thy charge.
Be mine not to endure
That, among mortals, in war's splendid toils, Athena's city be not conquest-crowned.
Pallas, thy choson seat henceforth be mine !
No more the city I despiso Which Zeus omnipotent and Ares prize, Stronghold of gods, altar-protecting shrine Of Hellas' deities, 880 For which, with friendly augury I pray;
Springing to light from earth's dark womb, May life's fair germs prolific bloom, Lured by the solar ray.
I for my citizens with gracious mind
These blessings mediate ;
these deities Installing here, mighty and hard to please.
For unto them hath Fate assigned 890 The destinies to fix of human kind.
But whoso findeth them severe Knows not whence come life's strokes ;
for crime, Dread heritage from bygone time, Doth lead him to these powers august.
Him noiseless Ruin, midst his proud career, With hostile anger, levels with the dust.
Here may no tree-destroying mildew sweep,- (So show I forth my grace), May no fierce heat within these bounds alight, 900 Blasting the tender buds ;
no sterile blight, Disastrous, onward creep.
But in due season here may flocks of worth Twin yeanlings bear;
and may this race, Enriched with treasures of the earth, Honour the Heaven-sent grace!
Ye city-guardians do ye hear aright
What thus she promises.
For great the might 910 Erinys wields-dread brood of night-
Alike with Hades and the Olympian Powers;
O'er men confessed and absolute her reign, To some she giveth song, and some she dowers With life, tear-blinded, marred by pain.
Hero may there fall no man-destroying blight !
And ye, great Powers, o'er marriage who preside, In wedlock bands each lovely maid unite;
-
Ye too, dread sisters, to ourselves allied, 920 Awful dispensers of the Right, In every human homo confessed, In every age made manifest, By righteous visitations;
—aye revered, And, everywhere, of deities most feared.
While thus yo ratify with friendly zeal
These blessings to my country, I rejoice, And love Persuasion’s eye, who moved my voico To sootho thoso stern refusers, passion-stuug.
930 But Zous bath conquered, swayer of the tongue, God of tho Forum.
Triumphs now for aye
In noble benefits our rivalry.
Within this city ne'er may civil strife, Insatiate of ill, tumultuous roar ;
Nor thirsty dust quaff deep the purple gore
Of citizens ;
nor rage, with murder rife, Snatch greedily the vengeful knife I But studious of the common weal May each to each in turn be kind, 940 Hate may they ever with one common mind;
This among mortals many a woe can heal.
Grow they not wise, as they the pathway find
Of tongue propitious ?
From these shapes of fear, I to my lieges see rich gain.
For here, If ye these gracious ones with gracious mind Adore and magnify,-your state and town Ye shall for evermore with justice crown.
Farewell, farewell, enriched with wealth's fair prize, Farewell, ye people of the city, near 950 To Zeus himself who dwell, to Pallas dear, Friends to the friendly Virgin ;
-timely wise ;
'Neath Pallas' wings who rest, her father doth revere.
Ye too farewell!
Mine is it first to show Your destined seats and thitherward to lead.
Escorted by the torchlight’s sacred glow, The while in sacrifice the victims bleed 9GO
The downward slope descend.
Whatever is baneful to the land restrain, And conquest's gracious ministry upsend To this my city.
Tutelary train, Children of Cranaos, it belongs to you, These alien settlers to their homes to guide;
And with my lieges may there aye abide, Discernment rightful of the Right and True.
Farewell once more, my farewell I repeat, 970 All ye, or gods or mortals, who reside In Pallas’ city, and who here preside.
Holding in pious awe my hallow'd seat, The fortunes of your life ye never-more shall chide.
The utt’rance of your pious vows I praise;
— I will escort you with the flashing light
Of torches, to your cavernous abodes Beneath the earth, with sacred ministers, And those mino imago loyally who guard.
For now, of all the land of Theseus let 980
The eye come forth,—a glorious company Of girls, of wires, of matrons hoar with eld, In festive garb apparelled, vermeil-hued,— Proceed and let the torch-flame load the way, That evermore this gracious sisterhood May, with events auspicous, bless this land.
Night's hoary children, venerable train, With friendly escort leave the hallowed fane.
All.
Rusties, glad shouts of triumph raise.
In ancient crypts remote from light, Victims await you and the hallowed rite.
990All. People, ring out your notes of praise.
With promise to this land of blessings rare, Down the steep path ye awful beings wend, Rejoicing in the torchlight's dazzling glare.
All.
Your cries of jubilee ring out amain.
Let torchlights and libations close the rear.
Thus Zeus, all-seeing, and the Fates descend, To bless these citizens to Pallas dear.
All.
Your cry of jubilee ring out amain.132.

CHORUS OF PERSIAN ELDERS.
ATOSSA, MOTHER OF XERXESGHOST OF DARIUS.
MESSENGER.[SCENE.—SUSA, before the Palace of the Persian kings.
The Thymcle * arranged to represent the tomb of Darius.
Enter a procession of Persian Elders forming the Chorus.]THIS drama, founded upon the Persian War, and pro­ duced only seven years after its termination (B.C. 472), is invested with peculiar interest, not only as the earliest Æschylean drama which has come down to us, but also as our earliest extant Greek history, the first recorded recitation of Herodotus having taken place at the great Panathenæa.
at Athens (B.C. 446).
It ex­ hibits, moreover, the same principles of dramatic art, and the same conceptions respecting the divine govern­ ment which characterise the purely imaginative pro­ ductions of the " warrior-bard."
For its full apprecia­ tion we must endeavour to realise the magnitude of the struggle which it commemorates, together with the momentous consequences to Hellas and to the world which resulted from the Hellenic victory.
About eighty years before the battle of Salamis (fought B.C. 480) the Persians had made their first appearance in history, when, under their leader.
Cyrus, they overthrew the empire of the Medes (B.C. 559).
Within this comparatively brief interval they had brought under subjection not only the native peoples of Asia, but also large areas of Europe and Africa.
At the time of our drama their empire ex­ tended southward over Egypt to Cyrenaica, while to the north it comprised Maritime Thrace, Pæonca, and apparently Macedonia, as far as the borders of Thessaly, besides nearly all the islands of the Ægean, north of Krete and cast of Eubœa.
Their ambition expanded with their conquests, till, at length, they aspired to universal dominion.
"The conquest of Greece was represented by Xerxes as carrying with it that of all Europe, so that the Persian empire would become co­ extensive with the Æther of Zeus, and the limits of the Sun's course.
"The idea.
upon which this colossal empire was based was that of the despotic force of personal will, involving obligation of universal personal service, especially in war.
During the expedition of Xerxes the tributaries of the Persian king were virtually slaves, working under the lash, and driven on to the charge in battle with the scourge.
The profound humiliation of the subject peoples is forcibly depicted by the Chorus, in the ode wherein they lament the overthrow of the Persian power (v. 58G).
Meanwhile, in the heart of Hellas, a new phase of political life had been developed;
Athens I ad thrown off the yoke of her tyrants, tho Pisistratids, and the world saw, for the first time, a state composed of free and equal citizens.
The revolution of Kleisthenes bad established the principles of free speech and equal law, while as yet this now-born liberty had not degene­ rated into licence.
Adverting to the Athenian cou­ stitution at the time when the Persians made their attack on Hellas, Plato says, " Reverence was then our queen and mistress, and made us willing to live in obedience to the laws."
The strength of patriotic sentiment generated by the new constitution inspired the amazing courage required in the Athenians to encounter the hitherto unconquered hosts of Persia ;
upon the plain of Marathon they triumphed, and their glorious victory arrested, for a time, the encroachments of the Persian king.
His son Xerxes undertook to avenge the disaster which had befallen the Persian arms:
after enormous preparations, he set forth on his expedition, at the head of an army composed of forty-six different nations, each with its distinct national costume and local leaders, while eight other nations furnished the fleet.
Well might the contemporary world be overawed by the spectacle of so prodigious an armament, and regard the cause of Hellenic independence as desperate.
The victory of Salamis shattered the power of the barbarians, and changed the destiny of the world. " ' Let there be light!' said Liberty, And, like sunrise from the sea, Athens arose.
"In celebration of the victory thus achieved by struggling and triumphant freedom, and in honour of the city of Pallas, which had won immortal glory at Salamis, Æschylus composed his drama of The Persians.'
It has been justly remarked that " Æschylus is the prophet of Greek tragedy." "
A single episode, a single generation, was insufficient for the display of the dependence of life upon life, and the moral infinitude of action which it was his design to exhibit.
Thus he habitually composed groups of three connected plays, which gave full scope for the development of thought and work.
"
*Unfortunately, we possess only the second member of the trilogy, which, consisting of three separate dramas, severally entitled, Phineus, The Persians, and Glaukos, ╇ appears to have been known among the ancients by the general name of ' The Persians.'
To this trilogy was appended:
the Satyric drama of " Prometheus, the Fire-kindler."
Though the second member of this trilogy is alone based upon history, while the first and third, together with the Satyric drama, draw their materials from mythological sources, it appears almost certain that these apparently in­ congruous elements constituted together one grand poetic whole;
the leading idea giving unity to the detached dramas being the struggle between Asia and Europe, which, originating in the dim ages of my­ thology, had at length culminated in the triumph of Hellas over the non-Hellenic races.
In the same manner Herodotus has based his history upon the notion of a primeval enmity subsisting between the Hellenes and the nations of the East.
This apparent incongruity vanishes when we remember that the con­ temporaries of Æschylus cherished the firmest belief in the existence of their legendary heroes, whose pro­ tection and assistance were continually invoked, while their appearance on the scene of action, with super­ human stature and imposing mien, was hailed as an omen of victory.
Æschylus has, moreover, in the second member of the trilogy, so treated the events of contemporary history as to bring them into harmony with the occurrences of the mythical past, invested, as it was, in the popular imagination, with a halo of glory and sublimity.
This was rendered possible by the remoteness of Persia, which was selected as the scene of the drama;
by the gorgeous splendour which surrounded Oriental life;
by the vastness of the armies assembled under the sceptre of the great king, together with the strangeness of the barbaric physiognomy and costume.
"These, exaggerated to still greater proportions in the popular imagination, produced an impression of dim and indefinite greatness not unlike that in which the midst of timo veiled tho heroes of mythology.
"
*Another feature of tho Æschylean ago is the im­ portanco attached to prophecy, which, as we learn from Herodotus, not unfrequently determined the judgments of men, both Greeks and Asiatics;
which also we find employed by our poet as tho most convenient link for connecting tho separate members of his trilogies.
Thus, in the Oresteia, tho Agamemnon is connected with the Choephori through Cassandra's prophecy of the vengeance which was speedily to fall upon the guilty pair.
If wo turn now to the drama of ' Tho Persians,' we find the Ghost of Darius referring in tho most emphatic manner to certain ancient oracles (v. 739), of which tho calamities which had befallen the Persians were tho recognised fulfilment.
It has been remarked by Welcker that in this passage allusion is obviously made to something which had been brought before tho minds of tho spectators in tho previous drama, and this hypothesis is confirmed by the prophetic character of Phincus, from whom tho first member of tho trilogy derives its name.
Phincus is represented in mythological story as ono of tho sons of Agènor,† tho father of tho beautiful Europa ;
and it is roleted of Agènor by Ovid, and other classical writers, that ho sent forth his sons in quest of their sister, whose abduction by Zeus was represented by Persian literati as the first act of the conflict between the Eastern and the Western world:
this version of the Phineus legend would offer, as remarked by Gruppe, an obvious link of connection with the Persian war.
There are other versions of the story which, notwithstanding some discrepancies as to the genealogy of Phineus, and the circumstances of his blindness, agree in investing him with the prophetic character, and in bringing him into connection with the Argo­ nauts, the grand national adventurers of Hellas.
In the single extant fragment of the Æschylean Phineus reference appears to be made to the Harpies:
Phineus, according to the ancient legend, was delivered from the Harpies by the Boreades;
* and it is related by Apollonius (xi. 317) that, after his deliverance, he prophesied, and foretold to the Argonauts the success­ ful issue of their enterprise.
In accordance with the spirit of the age, which linked together the successive conflicts between Europe and Asia, the expedition of the Argonauts, with that of the Hellenes against Ilium, is associated, by Herodotus, with the Persian war :
Æschylus would probably give greater scope to the prophecies of Phineus, and would thus have an opportunity of carrying back the imagination of the audience to the traditionary commencement of the great struggle which had recently been brought to so glorious a termination.
Thus, according to Welcker, the mythological drama of Phineus would form a kind of prophetic prelude to the historical drama of ' The Persians.
'
Reference has already been made to the tendency of Æschylus to group together a long scries of events, having reference to some connecting principle.
It might therefore excite surprise that, in treating so momentous a subject as the Persian war, lie should have contented himself with celebrating tho battle of Salamis alone, which, however glorious for Athens, left tho fate of Hellas still undecided.
This would be brought home with peculiar force to the Athenians who, only ten months after the retreat of Xerxes, had been obliged to migrate a second time to Salamis, while Athens became onco more the head-quarters of their dreaded too.
Tho victory of Platæa, which insured tho final deliverance of Hellas, would there­ foro bo regarded as second in importance only to Salamis.
Moreover, in tho drama of 'Tho Persians,' tho ghost of Darius alludes to the battle-field of Platæa on which the ruin of the Persian host was to bo con­ summated, as the just punishment inflicted by Zeus upon their impiety and overweening thoughts.
This prophecy alone would suggest the probability of some reference being made to this important victory in the third member of the trilogy, the Glaukos Potnieus.
According to popular tradition Glaukos was a fisher­ man, who became a marine demigod by eating of the divine life-giving herb sown by Kronos:
one version of the legend represents him to have been one of the Argonauts, who, having fallen from his galley, suffered this transformation.
The so-called grotto of Glaukos was situated near the little town of Anthedon in Bœotia :
this marine deity, accompanied by strange monsters of the sea, was accustomed, once a year, to visit the surrounding coasts and islands, and there to prophesy impending calamity.
His approach was anticipated by the fishermen, by whom he was held in peculiar veneration, who also offered sacrifice and prayers to avert the threatened woe.
It is mentioned by Pausanias (ix. 22, 6), that what Pindar and Æschylus heard from the dwellers at Anthedon con­ cerning this marine deity had furnished materials to both poets, and had sufficed to Æschylus for the creation of a drama.
According to Welcker, the extant fragments of this drama seem to indicate that Glaukos describes a voyage which he made from Anthedon to Sicily.
Passing the promontory of Eubœa, the shore of Zeus Kenæus, and the tomb of the unhappy Lichas (frag. 27), he came to Rhegium (frag. 31, 189 ;
Herm. p. 12), and arrived finally at Himera (frag. 28) in Sicily.
In the neighbourhood of this city was fought the battle of Himera, on which occasion the Sicilian Hellenes repulsed tho Carthaginian invaders, whose attack took place simul­ taneously with that of Xerxes upon Hellas.
It is hardly to be supposed that Æschylus would introduce into his drama the name of Himera without com­ memorating a victory, which his contemporary, Pindar (Pyth. i. 152), represents as not inferior in importance to those of Salamis and Platæa, the circumstances of which also were peculiarly susceptible of poetic treat­ ment.
Tho Bœotian sea-god, moreover, would form tho most appropriate herald of tho Bœotian victory, and thius, in his third drama, Æschylus would have tho opportunity of bringing the battles of Himera and Platæa into connection with that of Salamis, which formed the main feature in the Persian trilogy.
Tho plastic art of tho Hellenes illustrates their tendency to regard tho successive victories of Hellas over Oriental barbarism as phases of tho great struggle between the higher and lower elements of civilization, which formed so prominent a feature in their my­ thology.
Thus, in tho temple of Hera, at Mycenæ (Paus. xi. 17, 3), and in that of Zeus at Agrigentum (Diod.
xi. 82), the capture of Ilium was associated with tho overthrow of the giants by tho Olympian gods.*
Their recent splendid victories would doubtless bo similarly regarded by them as the ultimate triumph of civilization over barbarism, brought about by tho intervention of the higher powers.
This conception has found artistic expression in tho beautiful painting on tho so-called Darius vase, "on which the celestial dcities are represented as consoling the terrified Hellas in face of the threatening purposes and preparations of the mighty king of Asia."
Moreover, "out of the gigantic block of Persian marble at Rhamnus, three leagues from Marathon, which the Persians are said to have intended for a trophy, Phidias (also a prophet) created one of the most sublime of the Greek statues of the gods, that of Nemesis, whose stern form and gesture admonished the Greeks:
' Be not lifted up;
to God alone belongs the glory !'
"*It may be remarked, in conclusion, that this drama, by the profound humiliation of Xerxes, strikingly enforces the Hellenic principle that the supreme intelligence, which Æschylus invariably identifies with the will of Zeus, cannot suffer any inferior power, human or divine, to overpass its legitimate limits, and thus interfere with the harmonious working of the whole.
At the same time the dignity of the Persian empire is vindicated by the description of the glorious and happy life which the Persians enjoyed under the rule of Darius, which had been forfeited by their impiety in acting in opposition to the divine decrees;
moreover, by introducing the ghost of the mighty king, not only as the stern rebuker of his son's overweening pride, but also as deprecating in the most emphatic manner any subsequent invasion of Hellas, we see, in this early historical drama, an approach to the great principle of classical dramatic art, which finds its perfect fulfilment in the Oresteian trilogy, namely, the final re-establishment of harmony between the contending powers whose collision has formed the main action of the drama.
The Satyric drama, which invariably followed the trilogy, was a relic of the original dithyrambic chorus sung at the festival of Dionysos by groups of Satyrs who followed the chariot of the vintage-god;
it was probably intended to relieve the serious impression produced by the tragedy, and to furnish amusement to the populace.
It is doubtful whether these Satyric pieces were ever in such organic connection with the three dramas which they followed as to justify calling them a tetralogy;
the significance of the " Prometheus," as the concluding member of ' The Persians,' must however be admitted.
Welcker has shown that we must distinguish between "Prometheus tho fire- bringer," and " Prometheus tho fire-kindler;
" the latter being the title of tho Satyric drama in question, which he maintains had reference to tho establishment of the Promethen, the torch-race, at Athens, an artisan festival of which Promethens was regarded as the founder.
The kindling of tho sacred fire might well be hailed as the symbol not only of victory, but also of tho brighter day which had just dawned for tho Hellenic race;
while the association of tho poorer classes, by tho introduction of their favourite festival, would impart to tho drama a peculiarly popular character, and render it tho appropriate expression of tho national enthusiasm.
T HE Faithful these, advisers old Of Persians, gone to Hellas' strand, Guards of these halls and plenteous gold Here treasured, whom, as elders' meed, Lord Xerxes, King, Darius' seed, Chose wardens of the land.
But touching now the safe return Of King and gold-trickt host, My heart within me, doleful seer Of mischief, harrow'd is by fear,- 10 For all the martial strength is gone, Nurtured in Asia,-and doth yearn For our young hero;
news is none;
Nor horseman reacheth yet nor post Our Persia's central home.
But they forsaking Susa's walls, Agbatana and Kissia's hold, Right ancient, forth to battle sped, Some borne on steeds, in galleys some, Others in march, with measured tread, War's serried ranks displayed.
20 Such were Amistres, Artaphren, Astasp and Megabazes,—they, Marshals of Persia, kings themselves, But to the mighty King submiss, Speed forth, o'erscers of vast array, With arrow puissant, borne on steeds, Fearful to sight and dread in fight, Through their high-souled resolve.
And steed-exultant Artembar, Masistres and Imaeus brave, so Puissant with bow;
Pharandakes, Sosthānes too, steed-driver;
Others Nile's vast, life-teeming wavo Sent to the war;
Susiskănes, And Pegastágon, Egypt-born, Him too who sacred Memphis sways, Mighty Arsámes;
Ariomard, Whose rule Ogygiau Thebes obeys;
And rowers from the marshy shore, Their barks who guide with sturdy car, Well-skilled, a countless host.
10And Lydians, a luxurious train, Who tho whole native people hold, Of Asia's mainland ;
these the twain, Metragathes and Arkteus brave, Kingly commanders, lead to war, Sent forth by Sardis rich in gold, Mounted upon full many a car, With steeds yoked three and four abreast, Terrific to behold.
And dwellers sacred Tmolos near Are pledged the slavish yoke to cast 50 On Hellas ;
—Mardon, Tharubis, Dread anvils of the spear;
And Mysians skilled the dart to throw;
While Babylon, the golden, sends
Her motley throng, which sweeps along, Some upon galleys borne, and those Whose valour trusts the bow.
Thus 'neath the King's commandment dread Each sabre-wielding race has sped From Asia's every reign.
Such bloom of men from Persia's plain GO Hath gone, and all the Asian earth, Yearning for those whom from their birth
She fostered, groans amain;
While wives and parents count each day, Still trembling at the long delay.
Already hath the royal host, Spoiler of cities, gained the adverse coast;
O'er cordage-fastened raft * the channel they Of Athamantid Helle passed, 70 What time their many-bolted way On the sea's neck, as servile yoke, they cast.
Thus the fierce king, who holds command O'er populous Asia, drives through all the laud, In twofold armament, his flock divine, Land troops, and those who stem the brine ;
Strong in his stalwart captains, he Of gold-born* race the god-like progeny.
80From eyes like deadly dragon's, flashing a lurid gleam, With men and galleys countless, driving his Syrian car, 'Gainst spear-famed men he leadeth his arrow-puissant war.
And none of valour proven against the mighty stream 90 May stand, a living bulwark, and that fierce billow stem;
For Persia's host resistless is, and her stout-hearted men.
But ah!
what mortal baffle may * A god's deep-plotted snare,- Who may o'erleap with foot so light ?
tAte at first, with semblance fair, 100 Into her toils allures her prey, Whence no mere mortal wight May break away.
In olden time by Heaven's decree Fixed was the Persians' destiny ;
— Tower-battering war was theirs by Fate, The turmoil when steed-mounted foes
In shock of battle fiercely close, And cities to make desolate.
110Now have they learned firm gaze to cast
On the vext sea, what time the blast Makes hoary its broad-furrowed plain.
Confide they now in naval craft, Cables fine-wove, device to waft Armies across the main.
Hence, swartly robed, my heart by fear Is tortured, lest ere long the State- Woe for the Persian army!
hear 120 That Susa's mighty fort is desolate.
And Kissia's stronghold shall reply Beat unto beat on doleful breast, While crowds of women raise the cry, Woe !
woe I and rend their flaxen-tissued vest.
For all the troops that draw the rein,
And all who tread tho dusty plain, Like swarming bees, with him who led 130 Their martial host, abroad havo sped, The jutting boat-way crossing o'or, Sea-washed, and common to each adverse shore.
And yearning love with many a tear
The couch bedeweth, lone and dicar ;
The wives of Persia, steeped in woe, Lament, of their dear lords bereft, For her fierce spouse against the foe 140 Each sent spear-armed, and mourns unmatcd left.
But Persian elders, come,
And seated in our ancient hall of state Devise we counsel, with deep-thoughted care, For great in sooth the need;
-
How haply fares our king, Darius' seed, Xerxes, from him derived whose name we bear-
On bending of the bow doth conquest wait ?
Or bath the might 150 Of iron-headed spear-shaft won the day ?
But lo, in brightness like the eyes of gods, Comes forth a light—
The mother of my royal lord, my queen.
Do we obeisance, falling at her feet;
Yea, it behoves us all With words of salutation her to greet.
Of Persia's deep-zoned daughters supreme in rank, 0 Queen, Hoar mother of King Xerxes, spouse of Darius, hail!
Once consort, now the mother of Persia's god art thou, Unless our ancient fortune abandons now the host.
160Therefore I come forsaking our gold-tricked palace halls, The common nuptial chamber, Darius' and mine own.
Me too at heart care rendeth :
my thoughts to you I'll speak, Being by no means fearless touching myself, 0 friends, Lest mighty wealth retreating, o'erturn with foot of haste, Fortune which great Darius not without Heav'n uprearcd.
Hence care, all words surpassing, twofold my bosom rends, Far small tho honour yielded to wealth, if men be lost, And light to strength proportioned, shines not where riches fail.
Our wealth may none disparage, but for our Eye wo fear, 170 For I the master's presence esteem the eye of home.
Wherefore since Fate hath ordered that thus affairs should stand, Be my advisers, Persians, mine aged, trusty, friends;
For all my hope of counsel is centred now in you.
Queen of this land, know surely, thou needest nut to utter, Or word or deed twice over, whatever thy power commands;
For we to counsel summoned, devoted are to thee.
Ever have nightly visions manifold*
Beset me, since, intent on ravaging Ionia's soil, my son led forth his power.
180 But never saw I dream so manifest
As that of yesternight;
—I'll tell it thee ;
—
Methought two women came before my sight, Richly apparelled, this in Persian robes Was habited, and that in Dorian garb;
In height above their sex pre-eminent, Faultless in beauty, sisters of one race.
As Fatherland the one by lot had gained Hellas, the other the Barbaric land.
Between these twain, for so methought I saw, 190 Some feud arose, which learning, straight my son Strove to appease and soothe;
he to his car Yoked them, and placed the collar on their necks.
Proudly the one exulted in this gear, Aud kept her mouth submissive to the reins;
Restive the other was ;
she with her hands
The chariot-harness rends, then, without bit, Whirls it along, snapping the yoke asunder.
Prone falls my son, and close at hand his sire, Darius, pitying stands, whom when lie sees, 200 The robes about his person Xerxes rends.
Such was, I say, my vision of the night.
When I arose and with my hands had touched Fountain clear-flowing, I the altar neared With sacrificial hand, wishing to pay To the averting gods, to whom belong Such rites, oblations;
forthwith I behold An eagle fleeing straight to Phœbos' hearth.
Speechless I stood through terror, friends;
anon, A kite I see borne forward on swift wing, Tearing with talons fierce tho eagle's head;
210 Meanwhile the eagle nothing did but cower, His body tamely yielding to the foe.
Dreadful these portents are to mo who saw
And you who hear :
for well ye know, my son, If victor, were a man with glory crowned.
Yet worsted, to the state gives no account, And saved, he none the less this realm will sway.
Thee neither would we, mother, o'erfrighten by our words, Nor yet too much encourage ;
but, prayerful, seek the gods;
If aught hast seen of evil, that pray them to avert, lint for thyself and children, the state, and all thy friends, 220 All good things to make perfect;
next, meet it is to pour To earth and to the Manes, libations;
but thy spouse, Darius, whom thou sayest in dream to have beheld, Entreat to send up blessings, for thee and for thy son, From neath the earth to daylight, while inauspicious things, Held under earth in durance, may fade away in gloom, Thus we, with mind presageful, counsel with kind intent, Trustful that from these omens the issue fair will prove.
Well thou, the first expounder of these my dreams, hast given
An explanation friendly toward my son and house.
May the good find fulfilment ?
The rites which to the gods
And to our buried dear ones thou biddest, we will pay Soon as we gain the palace.
Meanwhile, I fain would know Where on the earth stands Athens,. as men report, my friends.
Far to the west, where waneth our sovereign lord, the sun.
What!
bath my son then hankered this town to make his prey ?
Ay, to our king all Hellas would then submissive prove.
Of men then in their army have they so vast array ?
Of such sort was their army, it wrought the Medes great bale.
And what besides?
Wealth have they sufficient in their homes ?
A fount is theirs of silver;
a treasure of their soil.- 240Is the bow-stretching arrow conspicuous in their hands ?
Nay, lances for close fighting, and equipage of shield.
And who then is their shepherd ?
Who lords it o'er their host ?
To no man are they vassals, nor yield they to com­ mand.
How then, if foe invade them, may they the shock sustain ?
So that Darius' army, gallant and large, they quelled.
Dreadful thy words to parents whose sons to war are sped.
But soon, if I mistake not, thou the whole truth shalt learn, For here a courier speedeth whose gait proclaimeth him Persian, and he will bring us clear news of weal or woe.
2500 fenced homes of all the Asian earth, 0 soil of Persia, haven of vast wealth, How by one stroke our full prosperity Hath shatter'd been, and blighted Persia's flower.
Woeful his office first who heralds woe!
Yet all our sorrow must I needs unfold.-
Persians I the whole barbaric host is lost.
Grievous, 0 grievous woe, 2GO Strange, dismal overthrow, Weep, Persians, hearing of this dreadful blow.
Yonder our all is ruined utterly Myself, past hope returning, view the light.
Oppressed by weight of years,
Too long our life appears, When this unlooked-for woe assails our ears.
Present myself, not hearing others' words, Persians !
I can report what ills befel.
In vain, alas, in vain, 270 That many-nationed, diverso-weaponed band, Against illustrious Hellas' land, From Asia sped amain.
Corpses of men ill-fated choko the coasts Of Salamis, and all the region near.
Woe for their end forlorn !
The bodies, thou dost say, of dear ones lost, Full oft immersed, in death are tost, By floating robes upborne.
*Nothing our bows availed;
but all our host 280 Perished, by shock o'ercome of naval prows.
Shriek out a bitter wail
For those in death laid low;
How have the gods in all things wrought us bale! †
Woe for the perished army!
woe !0, Salamis, most hateful name to hear!
Athens, alas!
remembering thee I groan.0 Athens, name of dread To foes!
For we recall
How many wives of Persia vainly well, 290 By her arc widows made, bereft of all.
Long have I silence kept, struck down by ills, Wretched :
—for so transcendent this mischance, Our grief may be nor told nor questioned of.
Yet mortals needs must bear calamities
Sent by the gods ;
wherefore, our sum of loss Unfolding, though thou groanest at our ills, Yet in well-ordered narrative rehearse
Who hath from death escaped ;
whom must we wail
Of princely leaders that the truncheon held
Who now, by death has left his post unmanned.
300Xerxes himself still lives and sees the light.
Great light, in sooth, thou speakest to my house, And day clear shining, after murky night.
But Artembares, lord of myriad horse, 'Gainst the Sileni's rugged shores is dashed ;
And Dadaces, the chilinrch, spear-struck.
Forth from his galloy leapt with nimble bound.
And Tonagon. of Bactria's true stock Bravest, the sca-lash'd isle of Ajax haunts.
Lilnios, Arsames, Argestes, these 310 Round the dovo-nurturing island overpowered, On the hard coast lay butting to and fro. Neighbour to Egypt's Nile-springs.
Arkteus too, Adeues, Pheresseues, Pharnuchos,
All these together from one vessel fell.
Chrysian Matallos, captain of vast hosts, Leader of thrice ten thousand sable horse, In death his ruddy beard, bushy and thick, With purple gore distaining, changed its hue.
The Magian Arabos, and Artames, 320 From Bactria, settler on a rugged soil, There perished.
Wielder of no idle spear, Amphistreus, and the doughty Ariomard, By Sardis mourned ;
Amistris, Seisames, The Mysian ;
-of five times fifty ships Commander, Tharybis.
in Lyrna born, A comely man, no mark for envy now, Prone lies in death.
Foremost in valour too, Syennesis, Cilicia's host who led, Whose single prowess wrought the foe most bale, 330 A glorious end bath found.
I of such chiefs
Now make report;
but mid the throng of ills
Which overwhelm us, I relate but few.
Woe !
woe!
The very crown of ills, I hear, To Persians shame and matter for shrill wail;
But on thy track returning, tell me this, How great the number of the Hellenès' fleet, That they with Persia's armament should dare Battle to join in shock of naval prows ?
Had conquest waited upon numbers, queen, Then Persia's ships were victor, for the fleet 340 Of Hellas counted but three hundred ships,.
And other ten selected, in reserve.
But Xerxes, this I know, led fifty score, While those for swiftness most pre-eminent
Two hundred were and seven:
such the tale.
Seem we to thee the weaker in this battle?
Rather some power divine destroyed the host, The scale depressing with unequal fortune.
Gods save the city of the goddess, Pallas.
Is then the Athenians' city still unsack'd?†
350Her sons surviving, she firm bulwark hath.
What the commencement of the sea-fight ?
Say.
Did the Hellenès first the onset lead, Or did my son, proud of innumerous ships ?
All our disaster, Queen!
from spirit of ill
Or vengeful power, none knoweth whence, began.
For a Hellene from out the Athenian host Came to thy son, to Xerxes, with this tale,.
That when the gloom of dusky night set in, The Hellenès would not stay, but, springing straight On to the benches of their ships, would seek, 360 Some here, some there, safety by secret flight.
But he, when he had heard, perceiving not The Hellenic guile, or envy of the gods, To all his captains issues this command ;
When with his beams the sun to scorch the earth Should cease, and darkness hold the expanse of sky, Their squadrons they should marshal in three lines, Guarding the outlets and the billowy straits, And others station around Aias' isle:
— 370 For did the Hellenès 'scape a wretched fate, Finding by stealth an outlet for their ships, Stern was the warning,-every head should fall.-
Such words he spake from mind infatuate, For what impended from the gods he knew not.
And they, without disorder, but with minds Obedient to command, their meal prepared, And round true-fitting lock each mariner Strapp'd well his oar.
But when the sunlight waned
And night came on, each master of an oar ‡ 380 Went to his ship, and each one versed in arms;
Of the long galleys line still cheering line, Forth sail they, as to each had been prescribed.
And through the live-long night the admirals, With naval force entire, cruised to and fro.
Darkness advanced, yet not in secret flight Ionia's host was minded to escape;
But when white-steeded Day, bright to behold, Held the wide earth, from the Hellenes first, Like joyous chant, rang out their battle-cry, 390 And forthwith Echo, from the island rocks, Sent back responsive an inspiring shout.
On all the Persians, cheated in their hopes, Fell terror;
for by no means as in flight Their solemn pæan did th' Hellenes sing, But with stout courage speeding to the fray.
The trumpet's blare fired all their ranks, and straight, With simultaneous dip of sounding oar, They at the signal smote the surging brine, And instant all conspicuous were to sight.
400 First the right wing, well marshall'd, took the lead:
Then their whole naval force in fair array Bore down against us.
All at once was heard A mighty shout:
" Sons of Hellenès, on, Your country free, your children free, your wives, The temples of your fathers' deities, Your tombs ancestral;
for your all ye fight."
And from our side clamour of Persian speech
In answer rose;
no time was then for pause, But instant galley against galley dashed 410 Her armature of brass.
A ship of Hellas Led the encounter, and from Punic barque Sheared her high crest.
Thereon as fortune led, Ship drave on ship;
at first the Persian host, A mighty flood, made head;
but soon their ships Thronged in the strait, of mutual aid bereft, Each against other dashed with brazen beak, Crushing the oar-banks of their proper fleet;
While the Hellenès ships, not without skill, Circling around them smote :
dead hulks of ships 42 C Floated keel-upwards, and, with wrecks o'erstrewn
And slaughtered men, lost was the sea from sight, Ay, shores and reefs were crowded with the dead.
In flight disordered every ship was rowed, Poor remnant of the Persian armament.
Then as men strike at tunnies, or a haul
Of captured fishes, the Hellenès, armed With splint of oar, or fragment from the wreck, Batter'd, and clave with dislocating blows.
Shrieks and loud wailing filled the ocean brine, Till all 'neath eye of swarthy night was lost.
430 But all our losses, though for ten whole days I told them over, could I not recount.
Of this be sure, that never in one day Perished of men so vast a multitude.
Woe!
Woe!
Of ills a mighty sea hath burst On Persia, and on all the Asian race.
Be thou assured, but half our loss thou knowest;
Upon them camo calamity so vast
As twice to overweigh the ills yet told.
What Fortune could than this more hostile bo ?
440 Say, what this woe which came, as thou dost state, Upon the host, charged with still heavier bale ?
All Persia's sons, in fairest bloom of life, Bravest of soul, pre-eminent by birth, And to tho king himself still first in trust,- These died ignobly, by inglorious doom.
All wretched me, my friends, for deadly chalco I But say, what form of ruiu thoso o'erwhelm'd ?
An isle there is that fronteth Salamis, Small, with bad anchorage, whose sea-washed beach 450 Dance-loving Pan doth haunt;
thither the King Sendeth these chiefs, that, when the worsted foe Should in the isle seek safety, Persia's sons Might slay the host of Hellas, easy prey, And from the briny channels save their friends, In-guessing the to-come:
for when the god The Hellenès crowned with glory of the fight, On that same day, with shields of well-wrought brass Fencing their bodies, from their ships they leapt, And the whole isle encompassed ;
so our men Knew not which way to turn ;
oft time by stones 460 Pelted from foeman's hand, while arrows keen, Thick raining from the bow-string, smote them down ;
Rushing at last with simultaneous shout, The Hellenès hacked and carved the victims' limbs, Till they, poor wretches, all of life were reaved.
But Xerxes groaned, seeing the depth of ills;
For on a lofty height, hard by the sea, His seat he held, o'erlooking all the host.
His garments rending, a shrill cry he raised, 470 To his land troops forthwith dispatch'd command, And sped in flight disordered.
Thine it is To wail this sorrow added to the first.0 hateful Demon, how thou hast belied
The hopes of Persians !
Bitter punishment 'Gainst famous Athens bath my son devised;
Nor did the deaths suffice of Asia's host Whom Marathon destroyed;
for them my son Thought to exact requital, but instead, Upon himself bath drawn this host of ills.
But speak, the ships that have destruction 'scaped,— 480 Where didst thou leave them?
This canst clearly tell?
Of the surviving ships the captains straight Before the wind took flight in disarray.
But of the host the remuant met their death
In the Bœotian's land.
Some pressed with thirst Round sparkling fount, some breathless, spent by toil.­ * * ****Thence crossed wo over to the Phocian land, To soil of Doris and the Melian gulf, Whose plain Sperchcios' stream with kindly draught Waters;
thereafter the Achaian soil, 490 And cities of Tbessalians us received, Straitened for food ;
there died the greater part Of thirst and hunger, for both ills befel.
Magnesia and the Macedonian land Traversed wo then, far as to Axios' ford, To Bolbo's marshy reed, and to tho height Of Mount Pangaios and tho Edonian land;
But on that night, winter, out of duo time, Somo god aroused, who Strymon's holy stream Through its whole courso congealed ;
then who before
The gods had held for nought, with fervent prayers 500 Invoked them now, bowing to earth and sky.
When from their frequent orisons the host Had ceased, the stream's firm crystal straight they cross;
Then those among us who their march began, Ere the god darted forth his rays, were saved ;
For, flaming with his beams, the sun's bright orb Pierced the mid river, warming with his blaze ;
Then each on other fell, and blest was he Whoever earliest snapt the breath of life.
But the poor remnant, they who safety found, 510 With toil and many a hardship crossing Thrace, Rescued, arrive, not many, to a land Of hearths domestic.
Now let Susa groan, Sore yearning for our country's much-loved youth.
True are these things, but many ills untold I leave, which God upon the Persians hurled.0 baleful Demon !

what heavy weight
Thy feet have trampled on all Persia's race!
Ah, woe is me for ruin of the host!
Oh nightly vision manifest in dreams, 520 To me how surely didst thou ills portend!
But ye too lightly did interpret it.
Nathless, since your response did sanction this, First, I desire to supplicate the gods ;
Then, bringing from my house libations, gifts To Earth and to the Manès, I will come ;
Too late, I know, for evils past recall, But more auspicious may the future prove !
Meanwhile 'tis meet that, touching these events, Ye faithful counsel with the faithful hold.
530 My son, ere my return, should he arrive, Console ye, and escort him to his home, Lest to these ills some further ill accrue.0 sovereign Zeus, who Persia's host Countless and boasting loud Hast now destroyed, Lo! Susa and Agbatana
By theo are wrapt in sorrow's murky shroud.
And many a maid her mantling vest With tender hands now teareth ;
540
While drenching tears bedew her breast, The general grief that sharcth.
And Persia's women, delicate in woe, Longing their new-wed lords to see again, Their bridal couch with dainty covers dight, Abandon'd now, their tender youth's delight, With sateless moan complain ;
While I, in fitting strain, Wail for the fates of those in death laid low.
For now all Asia moans, left desolate.
550 Xerxes led forth, woe!
woe!
Xerxes hath all laid low !
Xerxes hath wrought malignant overthrow
To many a sea-borne raft.
Why did Darius rule unharmed the state, Lord of the archers' craft, Susa's beloved leader ?
Landmen and seamen flax-winged galleys bare:
* 560 Galleys led forth;
woe !
woe !
Galleys wrought overthrow, Galleys, by deadly crash of blue-faced prow, But through Ionian hands.
The king hath 'scaped, we hear, by fortune rare, Through Thracia's wide-spread lands;
Paths swept by storms of winter.
The first, alas!
laid low, 570 Perforce unurned, woe !
woe !
Around Kychreia's shores spray-drenchèd lie.
Pour the lament, uplift on high To heaven deep notes of pain;
Raising the dismal cry, Your voices strain.
By eddying currents torn, Gnawed are their limbs, woe!
woe!
By voiceless children of the unsullied deep.
580 Mourneth each dwelling, left forlorn ;
Parents bereaved, and elders mourn
These heaven-sent griefs, and weep
Their sum of woe.
Already through all Asia's land None owneth Persia's sway ;
None, at their sovereign lord's command, Henceforth will tribute pay :
Nor, falling prostrate, own his right 590 Them to enthrall ;
for kingly might Hath passed away.
No more the tongue is guarded now By mortals;
from this hour, Free arc the throng to speak, I trow, Since loosed the yoko of power;
And Aias' sea-eneireled isle, In blood-stained fields holds whatcrewhilo Was Persia's flower.
My friends, whoso is versed in sorrow, knows 600
That when on mortals comes a surge of ills, Prone are they then to fear;
but when the tido
Of fortune smoothly glides, fondly they trust That the same fortune still will waft them on.
So now to me are all things full of fear;
Woes sent of Heaven are present to mine eyes;
Rings in mine ear a cry, no paean strain :
Such terror from these evils scares my soul.
Wherefore without my cars and wonted pomp, Once more I issue from my home, and bring 610 To my son's royal sire, libations kind, Whate'er is soothing to the honoured dead.
White milk, sweet draught from heifer undefiled ;
The flower-distiller's dew, translucent honey, And crystal water drawn from virgin spring;
Here joyance too I bring of ancient vine, Draught unadulterate from mother wild;
From pale green olive-tree, that while it lives With constant leafage blooms, this odorous fruit;
And wreathèd flowers, brood of all-teeming Earth.
620 But, 0 my friends, chant ye well-omened hymns
O'er these libations offered to the dead;
Darius' mighty ghost do ye invoke, While I, these honours, which the earth shall drink, Myself will send to deities below.
O royal lady, to whom Persians bow, Do thou, to halls below, libations send, While we in solemn lay Those who escort the dead will pray Beneath the earth their gracious aid to lend.
Dread Powers who dwell below, 630 Hermes and Earth and Thou, Monarch of Hades, do ye now His spirit to the light upsend ;
For, if a cure for these dire ills he know, Alone of mortals he may speak the end.
Me doth our blessèd, godlike monarch hear, Pouring these varied doleful notes of woe, Broken by sighs ?
To him is my barbaric utterance clear, Telling our wretched griefs in piercing cries ?
610 Me doth he hear below ?
But thou, 0 Earth, and ye dread powers of night, Send from your sunless realms to upper air A shade of might;
The monarch, Susa-born, the Persians' god, Upsend ye,—Him whoso equal Persia ne'er Hath shrouded 'neath her sod.

ye also stand Lifting the dirge beside my sepulchre, And, shouting loud with shade-evoking strains, Piteously call mo :
but the upward path Lies not too open;
for the gods below More ready are to seize than to let loose.
Yet, rank among them holding, I am como;
But haste, that time rebuke not my delay.
What this now ill that weighs the Persians down ?
To look upon thee awes me;
690 To speak before thee awes mo:
By ancient fear subdued.
But since from Hades I have come, by thy complaints persuaded, Give to mine ear no long discourse, but tell thy tale concisely ;
Laying aside thine awe of me, reveal the whole full quickly.
I tremble to obey thee, Tremble to speak before thee Things harsh for friends to hear.
Well, since thine ancient reverence thy spirit thus impedeth, Hoar partner of my royal couch, do thou, much honoured lady, 700 These cries and lamentations leave, and somewhat tell distinctly.
That upon mortal men should come afflictions, is but human.
Many calamities by sea, many by land still happen
To mortals, if to wider scope their life should be extended.0 thou in happy fortune blest beyond the lot of mortals, In envied glory, while thine eyes still gazed upon the sunlight, Leading a life of happiness, a god unto the Persians.
Happy, in sooth, I deem thee now, dying before thou sawest
Our depth of ill.
Thou in brief space the tale shall hear, Darius.
In utter ruin, so to speak, prostrate lies Persia's fortune.
710How, prithee ?
Came contagion's blast or discord o'er tho city ?
By neither, but near Athens' walls bath our whole host been routed.
What son of mine an armament hath thither led?
Inform me.
Impetuous Xerxes, all the life of wide-spread Asia draining.
By land or sea, unhappy man, made ho this mad endeavour ?
By both in sooth;
a twofold front there was of two­ fold army.
But how could armament so vast on foot pass from the mainland ?
O'er Hellè's strait he artful threw a bridge, and so found passage.
Thus hath he wrought, and so hemm'd in the Bosphoros' strong current!
So was it, yet some demon-power did haply aid his purpose.
720Alas, some mighty demon came, and hath befool'd his judgment.
True, for the issue clearly shows what evil he ac­ complished.
And what hath been the fate of those o'er whom yc groan, lamenting?
The naval army, worsted, drew the land force to de­ struction.
So utterly by hostile spear hath the whole army perished ?
Ay, emptied of her warriors, moans all the town of Susa.
Woe for our levies vainly made, and many-nationed army!
Perished bath Bactria's martial strength, and not her elders only0 hapless son, of our allies the youth how hath he ruined?
Alone, abandoned, so they say, Xerxes, with but few others- 730How bath he met his end, and where ?
or is there hope of safety ?
Was fain to reach the bridge that links two continents together.
And bath he to this mainland come in safety ?
Is this certain ?
Ay, so prevaileth the report;
in that is no dissension.
Alas! full speedily bath como the oracles' fulfilment, Upon my son bath Zeus hurled down tho end of the predictions ;
I hoped it would be long indeed, ere Heaven these ills accomplished;
But when in haste man presses on, the god still keeps beside him.
A fount of ills for all my friends seems now to be discovered;
All this my son through ignorance bath wrought and youthful daring, 740 Who Hellè's sacred tide, forsooth, as it had been his vassal, And Bosporos, the stream of god, did hope to curb with fetters;
The current fashioned he anew, and hammer-beaten shackles Casting around, for mighty host achieved a mighty causeway.
Though mortal, all the gods he thought, infatuate, to master, Ay, e'en Poseidon;
was not this sheer frenesy of spirit
That held my son ?
In fear I am lest all the ample treasure
My toil amassed, become to men the spoil of the first comer.
Converse with evil-minded men bath taught impetuous Xerxes Such lessons;
for thy spear, they say, won for thy sons vast riches, 750 While he, through cowardice of soul, his spear at home still wieldeth, Thus adding nothing to the wealth bequeathed him by his father.
Hearing from evil-minded men full often these re­ proaches, This expedition did he plan and armament to Hellas.
Therefore by him hath ruin been achieved Portentous, aye to be remembered, such As ne'er before on Susa's city fell To drain it utterly, since Sovereign Zeus Ordained this honour, that one potentate O'er all sheep-pasturing Asia sway should bear, The sceptre wielding of command ;
for first 760 A Median led the host;
another then, His son, succeeding, the emprize achieved, For reason swayed the rudder of his mind.
Third after him, Cyrus, god-favoured man, Reigned, and for all his friends established peace ;
O'er Lydia's host and Phrygia spread his rule, And all Ionia forcibly subdued, For, such his wisdom, God was not his foe.
A son of Cyrus fourth the army ruled;
Fifth, Mardos governed, to his fatherland 770 An outrage, and to Persia's ancient throne ;
And him, by stratagem, brave Artaphren, In league with friendly chiefs whose work this was, Slew in his palace.-
Next myself obtained
The lot I craved, and with a mighty host Full many a warlike expedition led ;
But ne'er on Susa brought I bale like this.
But Xerxes, young in years, is young of soul, And my paternal charge remembers not.
For, be assured, ye my compeers in age, 780 Not all of us, of yore these powers who held, Shall e'er be proven to have wrought such ills.
What then, O King Darius?
What the goal
To which thine utterance tends ?
How in this strait May we, thy Persians, fare hereafter best ?
March ye no more against the Hellenès’ land, Not though the Median host outnumber theirs;
The soil itself to them is an ally.
How meanest thou ?
In what way their ally ?
By famine slaying bloated armaments.
790Not e'en the army which remains behind In Hellas, will achieve a safe return.
How Eay'st thou ?
Doth not all the Asian host Cross back from Europe over Hellè’s strait?
Of many few, if it behoveth one, Beholding things accomplished, to have faith In god-sent oracles;
for ne'er of these Do some fulfilment find while others fail.
If this be so, persuaded by vain hopes, A large and chosen force he leaves behind.
800 These linger where Asopos floods the plain, Kind source of fatness to Bœotia’s fields.
There them awaits to bear of ills the crown, Just meed of insolence and godless thoughts.
For reaching Hellas, awe forbade them not Statues of gods to spoil or shrines to fire.
Altars are swept away, and hallowed fanes, Uprooted from their basement, ruined lio;
Hence, having evil wrought, evil themselves
Not less they sutler, and shall suffer more ;
810
Not yet is reached the bottom of their woe, But still it welleth up, a quenchless flood ;
* Such gouts of bloody slaughter shall there lio Upon Platæa's soil from Dorian spear-
Yea, and to children's children, heaps of slain Voiceless, shall record bear to eyes of men, That thoughts too lofty suit not mortal man;
For bursting into blossom, Insolence Its harvest-ear, Delusion, ripeneth, And reaps most tearful crop.
Beholding then,
Such the requital of these impious deeds, Remember Athens, Hellas,—and let none 820 Disdaining present fortune, lusting still For other, squander great prosperity.
For Zeus, chastiser of o'erweening thoughts, Is aye at hand, an auditor * severe.
Wherefore, with timely warning, counsel him, Lacking in wisdom, that he henceforth cease 'Gainst Heaven to sin, with overweening pride.
But thou, 0 Xerxes' aged mother dear, Enter thy home, and taking fit attire
Go meet thy son ;
for the embroidered robes, 830 Through grief of heart at these calamities, Around his person all are torn to shreds;
Soothe him with kindly words, for well I wot, Thy voice alone will he endure to hear.
But I to nether darkness now depart.
Farewell, ye elders;
although ills surround, Yet to your souls give joyance, day by day, For to the dead no profit is in wealth.
Hearing of Persia's sorrows manifold, Present and yet to como, sorely I grieved.
8400 Fate unblest!
How many grievous ills
Upon me fall, yet most this sorrow stings, That of my son's dishonour I must hear, His royal limbs in tatter'd garb arrayed.
But I will go, and taking from my home Costly attire, meet, if I may, my son.
For ne'er will wo our dearest fail in woe.
Noblo and blest in sooth our city-ruling life, What time our monarch hoar, 850 Resourceful, blameless, unsubdued in strife, Godlike Darius ruled our country o'er.
As chiefs of glorious hosts wero wo displayed, †Firm laws did all things guide, While scathless and unworn, when war was laid, †In triumph to their homes our warriors hied.
How many a town ho took, yet seldom ho 860 The Halys crossed, or from his hearth would roam ;
* The cities such of the Strymonian Sea, The Achelôdès, near the Thracians’ home.
And those tower-girded, distant from the coast, Towns of the mainland, recognised his sway.
Those near Propontis' gulfs their site which boast, 870 Round Hellè’s ample frith and Pontos' bay.
And islands of the main, Fronting the headland that overlooks the sea, Hard by this Asian plain ;
Lesbos, and Samos crowned with olive-trees, Mycŏnos, Pares, Naxos, Chios, these, And Andros, joining Tenos neighbourly.
Ay, and each isle that lies Midway between the mainlands he controlled;
Iearos' seat of old;
Rhode, Lemnos, Cnidos;
Cyprian towns of fame, 880 Paphos and Soli, Salamis, dread name, Whose mother-city wakes these doleful cries.
And to his will Ionia's towns he bent, Well peopled by Hellenès, opulent;
And strength exhaustless his of mailed array, Of allies too, a motley band;
But now, not dubiously, by God's own hand, Smitten with mighty blow Through naval overthrow, 890 Behold we former glories swept away.

For εὖ ἐποδώϰει, I suggest εὖ πεδῴϰει.
In Theocritus, μετοιϰῶ is transitive, cause to migrate.
If you so interpret πεδῴϰει, it means that Darius successfully superintended the systematic migrations (that is, changes of encampment) of his vast standing army.664.
ϰαινά τε—νέα τε cannot be right.
Perhaps ϰοινάλγη— νέα τε, which suits the metre.

The corrupt δυνατα seems to me to conceal the lost verb.
The syntax of the sentence may have been something like this:

I can only understand this to mean that (Asiatic) Greeks fighting for Xerxes, though aided by Tyrians, were defeated by (European) Greeks.
“Greeks," says Xerxes, " were beaten by Greeks.
"ETEOCLES.MESSENGER.
CHORUS OF THEBAN MAIDENS.ANTIGONE.HERALD,[SCENE.—THEBES, in front of the Acropolis.
The stage, adorned tcith altars and statues of the gods, is occupied by a crowd of Theban citizens.
Enter ETEOCLES with his train.]THE trilogy to which this drama belonged was repre­ sented B.C. 467, five years after* " The Persians," and consisted, as we learn from the Didascalia given in the Medicean manuscript, of Laios, Œdipus, and “The Seven against Thebes," followed by the Satyric drama of the Sphinx.
It has been appropriately styled the dramatic epos of the House of Labdacos, for though the conflicting emotions in the soul of Eteocles are portrayed with true tragic insight, yet in “The Seven," as in “The Persians," narrative so far prepon­ derates over action as to render the treatment of their respective subjects epic rather than dramatic.
In this, as in the other dramas of AEschylus, the aim of the poet is to vindicate the divine government, and to exhibit the ultimate triumph of order and justice.
The principle more especially emphasized, that of divine retribution—“ the key-stone of the universal order "-was embodied by the Greeks in the word Nemesis:
passing from the domain of conscience, it became in later times a divinity, and has been aptly characterized by Bunsen as the “Muse of Justice."
In accordance with her teaching, the eternal laws can never bo violated with impunity:
with sleepless vigilance the dread avenger follows on the track of crime:
for a season, perhaps, no muttering is heard of the coming storm;
but not the less inevitably does punishment eventually overtake the wrongdoer, or his posterity.
Associated with this inexorable law of retribution, the poet, in the Theban tragedy, exhibits the working of those mysterious tendencies to moral evil which, like hereditary disease, not unfrequently accompany the fatal heritage of crime, and which, if not counteracted by the force of personal will, issue in the final destruction of the sin-polluted race.
A brief outline of the hoary legend, the main features of which would doubtless be embodied in the first two members of the trilogy, the Laios and the CEdipus, is essential for the due appreciation of the concluding drama..
The crime of Laios may be regarded as the fatal seed-corn from which he and his descendants reaped a tear-fraught harvest.
This is indicated in the choral ode of " The Seven against Thebes" (v. 737), which it has been truly said strikes the key-note of the drama.
Received as a guest into the house of Pelops, he;
according to the legend, carried off Chrysippus, the son of his host, whoso curse against the ravisher is subsequently confirmed by Apollo, who thrico warns him from his sacred shrino to save the State by dying childless.
Heedless of tho divine monition, ho, in on evil hour, “begat his proper woe, in Œdipus the parricide " (v. 747).
Laios, in order to evade the oracle which had declared that himself would be slain by any son whom he might beget, caused the infant, as soon as born, to be exposed on Mount Cithæron, the savage scenery of which harmonizes with the dark passages of Hellenic lore with which it is associated.
Here he is found by the herdsmen of Polybos, king of Corinth, who carry him to their master, by whom he is reared as his own child.
When grown to manhood, doubts having been cast upon his descent, he repairs to Delphi, in order to discover the truth as to his parentage.
Warned by the oracle not to return to his country, he proceeds towards Bœotia, and at the spot called the divided way, encounters Laios, whom in a skirmish he slays, not knowing him to be his father.
Pursuing his journey he arrives at Thebes, where, after solving the riddle of the Sphinx, he obtains the kingdom, and marries Jocasta, by whom ho becomes the father of two sons, Eteocles aud Polyneikes, and of two daughters, Antigone and Ismene.
The truth respecting his un­ happy marriage being at length brought to light, he in despair puts out his eyes, and resigns the government to his sons.
They, wishing that the family shame should be concealed from the eyes of men, place him in confinement, and it is related in one fragment of the Thebais, that instead of the shoulder of the victims sacrificed on the altar, they sent him the less honour­ able portions.
This, in his rage, he cast upon the ground, and, at the same time, prayed to the gods that his sons might perish, each by the hand of the other.
Reference appears to be made to this ancient form of the tradition in the Seven (v. 787).
The brothers, fearing lest their father's curse should be fulfilled, make an agreement to reign over the Theban territory in turn, each for the space of a year.
Eteocles, as the elder, reigns first, and at the appointed time Polyneikes comes to demand the sceptre, which his brother refuses to resign.
Polyneikes retires to Argos, and persuades Adrastos, his father-in-law, to assist him to recover the throne.
Accordingly, that prince and fivo other chiefs, accompanied by Polyneikes, march against the Cadmeian city.
With their appearance before the walls the third member of the trilogy opens.
Such, in outline, is the terrible story which ushers in “The Seven against Thebes."
The first tragedy probably ended with the death of Laios, while the wrath of CEdipus, and his curse, twice pronounced against his sons, would doubtless form a principal feature of the second drama.
This wo may infer from the prominence given to tho curso in the concluding member of the trilogy.
I cannot but think, however, that wo should misread the poet did wo Imagine that the death of the brothers resulted from the Inevitable operation of their father's curse.
Eteocles, though courageous, is full of in­ satiablo rage, and instead of yielding to tho pathetic pleading of the Chorus, exults in the prospect of fratricide;
while Polyneikes is represented as sharing the malignant hatred of his brother (v. 632).
Eteocles, moreover, by retaining the sovereignty, violates the claims of justice;
and Polyneikes, by seeking to regain it with the assistance of an invading host, is guilty of impiety towards his country:
thus the death of the brothers, through mutual slaughter, is the penalty due to their respective wrongdoing, and, as such, offers no violence to our sense of justice.
King Apollo, it is true, the awful Seventh, is represented as taking his station at the seventh gate, and avenging upon the sons of Œdipus the ancient transgression of Laios;
at the same time the poet makes us feel that they have themselves succumbed to the evil tendencies inherent in the race, and thus it is that their father's curse has exercised its dread ascendency over their destiny.
Had the trilogy terminated with the death of the brothers such a catastrophe would have violated an essential canon of classical dramatic art, which requires the final reconciliation of the principles brought into collision during the action of the play.
These principles, in the drama before us, are-duty to the family, and duty to the State;
the harmonious action of which is necessary to the well-being of society.
Thus it would appear that the decree of the senate respecting the burial of the royal brothers, which has been regarded as a dramatic blunder on the part of Æschylus, is in fact essential for bringing about a satis­ factory dénouement.
When, in spite of the prohibition of the senate, Antigone proclaims her heroic determi­ nation to inter her brother:
she claims our warmest sympathy and admiration :
had she stood alone, her heroism and sisterly affection would have offered a refreshing relief to the deadly hatred of tho brothers.
The action of the Chorus gives, however, a deeper significance to the episode.
The Chorus, it must be remembered, represents in the Greek theatre the moral conscience of the age, in its most elevated form ;
* a character strikingly exemplified in the drama before us.
At the commencement, indeed, they are timid Theban women, who, vividly realizing the brutal outrages offered to women after the capture of a beleaguered city, are possessed by overwhelming fear.
As the drama develops, however, they gradually assume a loftier tone;
the words of expostulation addressed by them to Eteocles are full of piety and wisdom:
when, therefore, one half of the Chorus follow, with Antigone, the body of Polyneikes, and the other half, with Ismene, that of Eteocles, wo may understand that the poet intended thus to recognise the equal sacredness of the principles respectively repre­ sented by the sisters, namely, allegiance to the holy tio of kindred-blood, and fealty to the State-the object, in Greek civilization, of tho most ardent patriotism.
The great Theban trilogy, as remarked by Bunsen, begins and ends with deeds of horror ;
but as the last and heaviest judgment is executed, gracious images of the future surround the bodies of tho slain ;
tho devoted heroism displayed by the Theban women " is a living pledge for the moral order < f the world,” and offers a spectacle commensurate in grandeur with the darker features of the drama.
Very interesting is the protest thus offered by the pro­ phet-bard of antiquity against that want of respect for women, and that jealousy of their participation in the functions of men, which find such frequent expression in Greek literature, and which are embodied in the insolent language addressed by Eteocles to the Chorus at the commencement of the drama (v. 169).
Such examples as that of the Theban women may have inspired the wise utterance of Plato, who declares that for the legislator to leave women without educa­ tion, and without sufficient scope for their energies, is materially to cripple the power of the State.
*With regard to the political bearing of the drama, K. 0.
Müller remarks that Æschylus strove to moderate the restless struggles of his countrymen after democracy and dominion over other Greeks.
The description of the upright Amphiaraus, who wished not to seem, but to be the best;
the wise general from whose mind, as from the deep furrows of a well­ ploughed field, noble counsels proceed, was universally applied by the Athenian people to Aristeides, and was doubtless intended by AEschylus for him.
In conclu­ sion, I may allude to the passage in the Iliad which relates how, when the invading army reached Asôpos' banks, Tydeus was sent forward to Thebes to speak the common message of the host.
Admitted into the palace of Etcocles, undaunted though alone, he challenged the Cadmeians to combat, and, through Athena's aid, came off victorious.
Whereupon the Cadmeians sought to compass his returning steps, and planted an ambush of fifty warriors;
these Tydeus slew, one only being left to bear the tidings homeward.
This treachery on the part of the Cadmeians furnishes a motive for the impetuous eagerness manifested by Tydeus to advance to the attack:
it may also throw light upon the iron-hearted purpose of the infuriated chiefs, which found expression in their terrible oath­ " the town to raze, And ravage the Cadmcian's citadel, Or, dying, to imbrue this earth with blood.
"
B URGHERS of Cadmos, timely words beseem
Him at the stern who guards the city's weal, Guiding the helm with lids unsoothed by sleep ;
For, if we prosper, God alone is praised, But if, which Heaven forefend, mischance befall, One man, Eteocles, through all the town, In noiseful rhymes and wailings manifold Would by the folk be chanted ;
which may Zeus, True to his sacred name, Averter, turn From our Cadmeian city ;
you meanwhile
It now behoveth—him alike who fails
Of youth's fair prime, and him whose bloom is past, Yet nursing still his body's stalwart strength, And each one grown to manhood, as befits—
The State to aid and shrines of native gods, That ne'er their honours be erased;
to aid Your children too, and this your mother earth, Beloved nurse, who, while your childish limbs Crept on her friendly plain, all nurture-toil Full kindly entertained, and fostered you Her denizens to be, in strait like this Shield-bearing champions, trusty in her cause.
And so far, to the present day, in sooth God in our favour hath inclined the scale;
For unto us, so long beleaguered here, War prospers in the main, through heaven's high will;
-
But now, so speaks the seer, augur divine, Without fire omens, but in ear and mind Marking, with faultless skill, presageful birds,- He, lord of these divining arts, declares
That the prime onset of the Achaian host, Night-plotted, threatens even now the town ;
Haste, to the turrets then and bastion-gates 30 Rush in full panoply;
-the breastworks throng, Take station on the platforms of the towers, And, biding at the outlets of the ports, Be of good courage, nor this alien swarm Dread over-much ;
God will rule all for good.
Myself have scouts sent forth and army spies,
Who, as I trust, no bootless journey make ;
And having heard their tidings, in no ,iso Shall I by guileful stratagem be caught.[Exeunt Citizens.
Noblo Eteocles, Cadmeians' lord, I come clear tidings bringing of the host;
— 40 Myself eye-witness am of what befel;
For seven impetuous warriors, captains bold, Slaying the sacred bull o'er black-rimmed shield, And touching with their hands the victim's gore, Ares, Enȳο, and blood-thirsting Fear Invoked, and by them sware, our town to raze, And ravage the Cadmeian's citadel, Or, dying, to imbrue this earth with blood.
And for their parents whom at home they left, With their own hands around Adrastos' car 50 Memorials they were hanging, shedding tears, But from their lips no word of ruth was heard;
For iron-hearted purpose, all aglow With manly courage, breathed as lions breathe, Whose eyeballs glare with battle.
Such my news,
Which by no sluggishness have been delayed.
I left them casting lots that each might lead, As Fate assigned, his squadron to the gates;
Hence at their outlets marshal with all speed
Our bravest men, our city's chosen sons;
For near already, raising dust, comes on, Full-armed, the Argive host, while glistening foam 60 Mottles the plain with flakes from panting steeds.
But thou, like prudent helmsman of the ship, Make stanch the city, before Ares' blasts Swoop down ;
for loud the army's land-wave roars;
Thou, for this charge, the swiftest moment seize:
Myself, sure watch, a wary eye will keep, And thou, through certain tidings, knowing all Outside that happens, without scath shalt be.0 Zeus, and Earth, and Gods our town who guard, And thou strong curse, Erinys of my sire, 70 My city, where the speech of Hellas flows, With utter ruin, captured by the foe, Uproot ye not, nor our domestic hearths, But grant that our free land and Cadmos' town In vassal bondage never may be held.
Be ye our strength;
—our common weal, I urge, For thriving cities honour best the gods.
I wail forth mighty, fear-inspiring woes!
An army hurries, from its camp set free!
A mounted host onward in ample tido Towards our city flows.
80 Dust that on air doth ride, Dumb herald, clear and true, persuadeth me.
Clatter of horse-hoofs on my natal plain Brings to mine ear war's dismal sound ;
Air-borne it floats around ;
Like mountain-lashing flood's resistless flow It roars amain.
Alas!
all me!
Ye gods and goddesses, oh turn aside
Tho impending woe.
With battle-shout, straight to our city-wall
Tho host white-shielded speeds in fair array.
DOWho will deliver?
Succour us who may, Or god or goddess ?
Prostrate shall I fall
Their shrines before ?
Ye Blest ones here who reign Now is the time to clasp your statues, now.
Burdened with sorrow, why, oh why delay ?
The clash of shields meets it, or not your car ?†
When, if not now, shall we our prayers begin With sacred peplus and wool-tufted bough ?
I mark the rattling din !
It is the clatter of no single spear.
1000 Ares, tutelary god of old, Thy proper soil betraying what wilt gain ?
O golden-helmèd god, the State behold Which once to count beloved thou didst deign.†
Ye tutelary gods, the land who hold, Come ye, come all, look on this virgin train Who, dreading bonds, as suppliants on you call.
For lo !
with slanting plumes
A surge of warriors round our city wall, On blasts of Ares riding, hoarsely booms.
110tDo thou, 0 Zeus, all-perfect Sire, do thou Avert, thou canst, our capture by the foe;
For Cadmos' fort Argives encircle now;
Weapons of war my heart appal, for lo, To chargers' months made fast, their metal gear Rings slaughter, and with pride elate, Seven chiefs, conspicuous o'er the host, With panoply of spear, Each having gained by lot his post, Stand, prompt for battle, at the seventh gate.
* * if * *Thou too, Zeus-born, war-loving power, do thou, 120 Pallas, our city from destruction save;
Equestrian Lord, thou ruler of the wave, Poseidon, with fish-piercing trident now Grant respite from our fears, grant respite thou.
Arcs, alas !
Our town, the name which bears Of Cadmos, guard show forth thy care divine;
Kypris, do thou, fore-mother of our line, These ills avert, for from thy blood we came;
Thee we approach with god-invoking prayers.
130 Thou too, Lykeian * Lord, thy name Attesting, as our groans ascend, Smite thou the hostile host;
—‡
And thou from Leto who dost boast
Thy heavenly birth, thy bow, dread virgin, bend.
The diD of chariot wheels, alas, ah me, Around our walls I hear ;
0 Hera, mighty queen !
From axles overburden'd creak the naves.
1-10 0 Artemis most-dear.!
Madden'd by hurtling spears vext ether raves.
What ails the city?
What its doom will be?
God guides the issue to what goal unseen ?
A stone-shower hits the towers, alas, ah me, Striking their very crown.
Apollo, our dear Lord!
With clang of brass-bound shields our gates resound.
†Zeus only can accord 150 With righteous issue that the strife be crowned.
0 Onca,* here enthroned, blest Deity, Do thou protect our seven-gated town.
a ye all-puissant powers, Dread guardians of our towers, Of either sex, oh hear us, nor betray A city toiling 'neath the spear, To hosts of alien speech.
These virgins hear, Most justly hear, with outstretched hands who pray.
160Divinities most dear, As Saviours mustering near Our city walls-show forth the love ye bear.
Care for our fanes, with aspect kind, And caring for them save.
0 hear our prayer, Our sacrificial rites call ye to mind.
I ask you, ye insufferable brood, Is this course best, fittest the State to save, The leaguered host to hearten—falling thus Before the statues of our city's gods, To shout and wail—a nuisance to the wise ?
In trouble or in dear prosperity, Ne'er be it mine with womankind to dwell.
In rule, her insolence keeps all aloof, In fear, worse in she brings to home and State ;
So have ye now, rushing in hurried flight, Housed in our townsmen soulless cowardice.
Ye serve, as best ye may, the foe without, ISO
While we within bring ruin on ourselves;
Such aid he reapeth who with women dwells.
So if there be who heeds not my command, Or man or woman, or aught else between, The fatal pebble shall decide their doom, Nor death by stoning at the people's band Shall they escape.
What passeth out of doors
Is man's concern ;
let woman counsel not.
Bide thou within, and no more mischief cause.
Dost hear or not ?
Or speak I to the deaf ?
Dear son of Œdipus, I trembled sore, 190 Hearing of rattling cars the roar, the roar, When wheel-impelling axles shrieked amain, When sounded on mine ear The noise of fire-wrought gear- Within the chargers' mouths their guiding rein.
What then ?
doth sailor means of safety find, 'The stern forsaking for the prow, what timo His vessel labours 'mid the ocean wave ?
Relying on the gods, as was but meet, When at our gates pattered the deadly sleet, 200 With hurrying pace I sought their statues old ;
By fear possest, I there Poured to the Blest my prayer, That they our city's prowess would uphold.
Pray that our towers be stanch 'gainst foemon's spear.
Grant not tho gods this boon ?
Ay, but 'tis said, That from a captured town the gods depart.
Ne'er may this conclave of the gods take flight
While I behold the day ;
And never may this city meet my sight 210 Foe-trampled, and to hostile fire a prey.
The gods invoking, be not ill-advised;
Obedience mother is of good success, Sure pledge of safety ;
-so the saying runs..
True, but the strength of god is mightier still, And oft, in direst strait, It lifteth from the lowest depths of ill Him who, with cloud-veiled eyes, was desperate.
Men's part it is to offer sacrifice
And victims to the gods, when foes assail;
220 Thine to be silent and to bide within.
'
Tis through the gods we dwell
In city unsubdued;
Through them our towers repel
The hostile multitude.
What anger can this move ?
I grudge thee not duo homage to the gods;
But lest faint-hearted ye the burghers make, Tranquil abide, nor yield o'ermueh to tear.
Hearing unwonted din,
In tumult and in fear, Trembling my heart within, I drew this fortress near ;
This seat of gods above.
230If now of dying or of wounded men Ye hear, bear them not off with loud laments, For 'tis on human slaughter Arcs feeds.
-But hark !
the snorting of the steeds I hear.
Hear, if thou must;
but hear not over-loud.
Groans from its base our fort, girt round by foes.
Mine is the task to counsel in this strait.
Woe's me!
More loud the rattling at the gates.
Hush, nor alarm the city with these cries.
Associate gods, our towers abandon not.
240Plague on thee!
canst thou not in silence bear ?
Co-burgher gods!
save me from slavery.
Thyself enslavest, thee and all the town.
Zeus!
what a gift to man was womankind!
Wretched as men are in a captured town.
The statues touching, dost renew thy cries ?
Through want of heart fear seizes on my tongue.
I pray thee grant me but one trifling boon.
Speak quickly then, so shall I quickly know.
250Be still, unhappy one, scare not thy friends.
Still am I;
—with the rest I'll bear my doom.
This word I to thy former words prefer.
Moreover keeping from these shrines aloof, Proffer the better prayer, e'en that the gods
Our allies prove ;
then having heard my prayers, Do thou the auspicious, sacred Pæan raise, Hellas' accustomed shout of sacrifice, Cheering to friends, dispelling dread of foes.-
Unto our country's tutelary gods, 260 The plain who haunt, the market-place who guard, To Dirka's fountains, and Ismenos' waters, Make I this promise, that-if all go well, And this our town be saved—with blood of sheep Dyeing the sacred hearths, and slaying bulls
In the gods' honour, trophies I will plant, And will aloft on spears, the shrines before, Hang in tho sacred fines tho spoils of war.
Pray to tho gods such prayers, not with fond moans, Neither with sobs of anguish vain and wild, For none tho more wilt thou escape thy doom.
270 Meanwhile, six men of war, myself tho seventh, I, at the seven outlets of the ports, In gallant style will marshal 'gainst the foe, Ere hurrying scouts and swiftly-rushing news Arrive, and by the stress set all ablaze.
[-Exit ETEOCLES.
I heed, but terror leaves my heart no rest, And in my bosom anxious care, Sad neighbour, doth enkindle there Dread of the wall-surrounding multitude ;
Like trembling dove am I, that for her brood 280 Doth serpents fear, fell inmates of her nest;
For some against our towers, A warlike throng, in numbers strong, Advance;
—ah what will me betide ?
Others, 'gainst citizens on every side Sore pelted, hurl the rugged stone;
Put forth, 0 kindred gods, your utmost powers,* Save host and State as Sire who Cadmos own.
290And say what soil of earth will ye obtain Better than this, if ye betray To foreign foes this fertile land And Dirka's water, richest draught of all That the earth-circling God sends forth amain, And progeny of Tethys.*
Hence we call, 300 Gods, on your guardian band ;
— Into the powers outside our towers Sending the coward's deadly fear, Which fatuous casts the shield away, Earn for these burghers glory.
Hear,
Oil bear my shrill-voiced wailings and retain, As Saviours of our State, your stedfast reign.
For sad it were, before its time 310 To hurl, enslaved, as booty of the spear, A city famed of old, to Hades drear, In crumbling ashes laid by Argive foe, Through heaven's high will, in shameful overthrow;
That women old and virgins in their prime
Like horses by their hair be dragged, all me, Their robes around them rent, to slavery.
Waileth the city emptied of its store, While captives, to destruction led 320 Lamenting, swell the mingled roar.
This heavy doom forebodingly I dread.
For maids whose bloom is at the full, Before the rites the scarce ripe fruit that cull, How grievous 'tis far from their homes to wend On hateful journey !
What then ?
I declare
Who sleep in death than these far better fare.
Full many woes a captured town attend;
As captive one his enemy doth seize, 330 Another slays, or round him scatters fire, While the whole city is with smoke defil'd, And people-taming Ares, wild With frenesy, all sanctities Foully polluting, doth their rage inspire.
Loud clamour through the town prevails, Destruction's net draws near, And man by man is slaughtered with the spear ;
The new-born infant wails, 340 Its gory bleating at the breast is heard ;
There Rapine, sister to wild Tumult, reigns.
Spoiler to spoiler gives the word;
The empty-handed empty-handed hails, Seeking a partner in his gains, Each greedy for nor less nor equal share.
In scenes like these how may we hope to fare ?
And fruitage too of every sort 350 Is wasted ruthlessly.
Earth-strewn, sad sight to housewife's cheerless eye ;
And earth's fair gifts, the sport
Of worthless surge, are swept away In common ruin;
maidens in their prime Are with new sorrow filled ;
for they Of haughty foemen now must own the sway, Forceful their wretched couch who climb ;
360
Their hope that death, their tear-fraught woes to end, O'er them may soon her sheltering night extend.
The army-scout, to me it seemeth, friends, Brings us some recent tiding from the host, Plying in haste his charioteering feet.
And lo!
our king, offspring of Œdipus, Comes in fair time the herald's news to hear.
Unmeasured too his footsteps are through haste.
I, the foe's movements knowing, can report 370 How at the gates each bath his post by lot.
Tydeus already at the Proitid gates Raves ;
but to cross Ismenos' ford the seer Forbids, for inauspicious are the rites.
But Tydeus, frenzied, hankering for fight, Blusters with yell like serpent's noonday hiss, And at the skilful seer, Oïeles' son, Aimeth the taunt that he, through cowardice, Fawneth on death and battle.
Shouting thus,
A triple shadowy plume, his holmet's mane, He shakes, and underneath his hollow shield, 380 Bells, wrought of brass, clang terror;
and he bears, Enchased upon its front, this proud device-
The nightly firmament ablaze with stars, And in mid-buckler shines the full-orb'd moon Conspicuous, queen of stars and eye of night.
Thus raving, he, in haughty garniture, Shouts near the river banks, in love with war, As charger, panting fiercely 'gainst the curb, Hearing the trumpet's blare, with fury chafes.
Whom, as antagonist, to him wilt set ?
Who, when the bolts are loosed, may warrant give, As champion to defend the Proitid gates ?
390I tremble at no panoply of man, Neither have mere devices power to wound;
Plumage and bell bite not without the spear.
This Night too, glittering with stars of heaven, Which is, thou sayest, set upon his shield, If spelled aright, may truthful omen prove.
For if in death night fall upon his eyes,
Then to its bearer will this proud device, Justly and fitly, answer to its name, 400 And 'gainst himself his pride shall prophesy.
To Tydeus, this brave son of Astacos I will oppose, as warden of the gates ;
He, nobly born, revereth honour's throne, And boastful words abhors ;
to shameful deeds Laggart, no craven soul he loves to be.
Scion of heroes sprung from dragon's teeth.
Whom Arcs spared, true offspring of the soil Is Melanippos ;
Ares will decide
The issue by the die ;
-but his true kin, Justice, bath sent him forth, her champion, 410 From his own mother foeman's spear to ward.
Grant to my champion victory, Ye deities, since forth he wends
To battle justly and our State defends.
But ah, by fear possest, I dread to see
Their gory fates who perish for their friends.
Him may the gods thus with fair fortune crown !
The Electrau gates bath Capaneus by lot, A giant he, o'ertopping him first nam'd.
His vaunt outsoareth mortal pride ;
these towers 420 He threats with horrors, which may Fato avert.
For,
God assenting or in God's despite, He vows our town to ravage ;
not heaven's wrath, Down leaping on the plain, e'en at his feet, Shall hold him back ;
lightnings and thunderbolts
To noonday solar beams he likeneth.
A naked man his blazon, bearing firo;
Flares in his bands a torch, for service prompt;
In golden characters, ho cries aloud, THE CITY I WILL BURN.
Against this man Send thou-but who such foeman will confront?
430 This boaster who will meet and tremble not?
Here also gain accrueth upon gain.
When in o'erweening thoughts vain men indulge
Their true bewrayer is their proper tongue.
Now threatens Capaneus, for fight equipped, Scorning the gods ;
and, practising his tongue, With senseless joy, though mortal, he to heaven, High surging words upsends, defying Zeus;
Full faith have I that Zeus, with justice' aid, Him with his fire-charged thunderbolt will smite, No whit resembling noonday's solar beams.
410 Him to confront, despite his raving tongue, Is hero marshall'd, ay, a soul of fire, Stout Polyphontes ;
trusty bulwark he, By grace of tutelary Artemis, And kindly aid of other gods.
Tell on,
Who against other gates the lot hath drawn ?
Perish who vaunteth mightily Against our city!
His career May thunder check, ere, with o'erweening spear, My home invading, me as captive prey 450 He driveth from my girlish haunts away!
Him next who drew his station at the ports I'll name.
For to Eteocles, third chief, From upturn'd brazen casque leapt the third lot, His band against Neïstan gates to lead.
His steeds, loud snorting in their frontlet-gear, Eager to reach tho gates, circling he drives;
Whistle their nozzles in barbaric guise, With breath sonorous from their nostrils filled.
With no mean blazon is his shield adorned;
460 A man in armour, to his foeman's tower, Eager to storm it, climbs a ladder's rungs;
And he too shouts in written characters, That him not Ares from the walls shall hurl.
Against this man a trusty champion send, The yoke of bondage from this town to ward.
Him will I straight with happy omens send;
Yea, sent is Megareus, whose vaunts are deeds;
Scion of Creon, from the heroes sprung Full-armed who rose from earth-sown dragon's teeth, He from the gates will not retire dismayed 470 By noisy snorting of infuriate steeds ;
But either, dying, will repay our land
His nurture-feo, or, seizing warriors twain, Ay, and the city on his foeman's shield, Will with the spoils his father's house adorn.
Now of another brag, nor grudge thy words.
For him success I pray, O champion of my homo;
for them instead Ill-fortune ;
and as they, With frenzied spirit, utter 'gainst our town High-sounding words, may Zeus, Avenger dread, By wrathful ire possest, on them look down!
480One more, a fourth, the neighbour-gate who holds, Onca-Athena's, shouting stands hard by;
The mighty form of huge Hippomedon;
I shook with terror, I deny it not, As the vast orb he whirled, his buckler's disk;
Certes no vulgar artist was the roan
Who this device hath wrought upon his shield;
Typhon forth darting from fire-breathing lips Flame's quivering sister, smoke of dusky hue;
And all around the hollow-bellied shield 490 Circled a coil of intertwining snakes.
Himself hath raised his war-cry, and inspired By Ares, raves like Thyiad for the fight, Death in his glance.
Against such man's attack Needs must we be prepared, for at our gates
Rout is already boastfully proclaimed.
First Onca-Pallas, near our city gates
Holding her seat, hating man's insolence, Shall him ward off, like fell snake from her brood.
Him to oppose hath Œnops' valiant son, Hyperbios, been chosen—man to man, 500 Willing at Fortune's call his fate to prove.
Neither in form, in courage, nor in arms Blameworthy;
them bath Hermes fairly matched Since foe will foe confront, while on their shields
They into conflict bring two hostile gods.
For Typhon, breathing fire, the one doth bear, While Father Zeus upon Hyperbios' shield Sits, firmly throned, wielding his fiery bolt;
But Zeus defeated no one yet hath seen.
Such on each side the friendship of the gods ;
510 We with the victors, with the vanquish'd they.
Thus will it with the mortal champions fare, If Zeus than Typhon stronger bo in fight;
And to Hyperbios, as the legend reads Set on his shield, a saviour Zeus will prove.
Firm is my trust that he
The hateful form who beareth on his shield
Of earth-born deity, Adverse to Zeus, to men a shape of dread And to the long-lived gods, prone in the field, Before our gate shall fling his own proud head.
520Such be the issue!
At the northern gates
The fifth is marshalled, near the tomb which holds Zens-born Amphion.
By his spear he swears, Which more than God he honours, or his eyes, That tho Cadmeian's stronghold ho will spoil.
Despite of Zeus.
So speaks the stripling hero, Scion fair-faced of mother mountain-reared ;
Over his cheek spreadeth the tender down, Hair thickly sprouting of youth's budding prime.
530 But he with savage temper, which belies
His maiden name, and with an eye of dread, Taketh his post;
—yet stands he at our gates
Not without vaunt, for on his shield brass-wrought, His body's rounded bulwark, he doth wield
The raw-devouring Sphinx, our city's shame, Her form stud-fastened, brilliantly embossed.
A man she holds beneath her, a Cadmeian, A target so for missiles thickly showered.
Hither he comes no peddling fight to wage, 540 Nor the long route he traversed to disgrace;
Parthenopaios, an Arcadian born, But denizen of Argos;
such a man Doth Argos' kindly nurture now repay By threats against our towers, which heaven avert!
From the high gods may they the doom obtain Planned against us;
so, with these godless vaunts, Themselves, o'erthrown, shall perish utterly.
'Gainst this Arcadian, him thou tellest of, The warrior Actor stands;
no boaster he, But with a hand which sees the thing to do;
Brother of him whom I before described.
550 No fluent, deedless, tongue will he admit Within our gates to aggravate our ills, Nor him allow to pass, on hostile shield
Who bears the image of that hateful pest.
***** No!
'neath our walls, sore-batter'd, she will rail
At him who fain would carry her within.
If heaven so wills, herein I truth shall speak.
His word my breast doth rend, Standeth my hair on end, Hearing the haughty boast 560 Of haughty men profane ;
Yo Gods, above who reign, Here, in our land, smite ye their alien host!
Sixth, let me name a man most sago of heart, Amphiaraos, prophet, first in arms ;
He, marshall'd at the Homoloian gates, Tydeus with keen reproaches oft assails, As homicide, disturber of the State, To Argos prime instructor in these harms, Erinys' herald, Slaughter's minister, 57 Adviser to Adrastos of these ills;
And on thy brother Polyneikes' might, Ho calls, dissecting his ill-omened namo ;
*
Then in conclusion, twice with emphasis
His namo repeating, utters forth these words:
" Pleasing to gods in sooth is such a deed, Lovely for future years to hear and tell,
The city of thy sires and native gods
To spoil, made captive by an alien host.
Can Justice the maternal fountain quench ?
* 580 Thy Fatherland, if captur'd through thy zeal, How can it e'er again be thine ally ?
Myself
I shall this land enrich, a seer 'Neath hostile earth sepulchred.
Fight we now!
For no dishonourable doom I look."
Thus spake the seer, wielding his rounded shield, All brass, but no device was on its orb;
For just to be, he longs, not just to seem, Ripe wisdom reaping from his deep-plough'd mind, Whence honest counsels grow.
Against this man 590 Champions, I charge thee, send, skilful and brave, For terrible is he who fears the gods.
Woe for the omen which the righteous makes Companion of the impious ;
nought is worse
In any cause than evil fellowship;
Its fruit may not be garner'd ;
Até's field Yields death for harvest;
yea, the godly man, With headstrong sailors bent on villainy, Mounting the bark, sinks with the heaven-loathed crew;
600 Or, just himself, but leagued with citizens Ruthless to strangers, heedless of the gods, Caught in the self-same snare, he prostrate lies, Smitten with them by God's impartial scourge.
So too this seer himself, Oicles' son, A righteous man, pious, discreet, and brave,- This mighty soothsayer, with bold-tongued men Unholy, in despite of reason, joined, Their march who trail to reach the far-off city,—* He, if Zeus will, with them shall down be dragged.
610 But he, methinks, our gates will not assail;
Not by faint heart withheld or dastard will, But knowing 'tis his doom in fight to perish, If fruit there be in Loxias' oracles ;
And He or silence keeps or speaks in season.
Yet against him stout Lasthenes we'll post, A stranger-hating warden of the gates ;
He, old in mind, yet blooms in youthful prime, With eye swift-glancing,‡ and not slow of hand To snatch from 'neath his shield the naked spear.
620 But victory is still the gift of God.
Our just entreaties crown, Ye gods, and bless our town!
On the invading powers Turn ye war's spear-wrought woe!
May Zeus, outside our towers,
With his dread thunder smiting, lay them low !
Now at tho seventh gato the seventh chief, Thy proper mother's son, I will announce, What curses for the state he imprecates ;
That he may stand upon the walls, he prays:
— That, heralded as king to all the land, With paeans for its capture, he with thee Fighting, may slay thee, dying by thy side, Or thee, who wrong'd him, chasing forth alive, Requite in kind his proper banishment.
Such words he shouts and calls upon the gods,
Who o'er his race preside and Fatherland, With gracious eye to look upon his prayers..
* * * * *A well-wrought buckler, newly forged, he bears, With two-fold blazon riveted thereon ;
640 For there a woman leads, with sober mien, A mailèd warrior, enchased in gold;
- Justice her style, and thus the legend speaks :
"
This man I will restore, and he shall hold
The city and his fathers' palace-homes."
Such the devices of the hostile chiefs.
'Tis for thyself to choose whom thou wilt send;
But never shalt thou blame my herald-words;
To guide the rudder of the State be thine!0 heaven-demented race of CEdipus, 650 My race, tear-fraught, detested of the gods.
Alas, our father's curses now bear fruit.
But it beseems not to lament or weep, Lest lamentations sadder still be born.
For him, too truly Polyneikes named,- What his device will work we soon shall know;
Whether his braggart words, with madness fraught, Gold-blazoned on his shield, shall lead him back.
Had Justice, virgin child of Zeus, in sooth Guided his deeds and thoughts, this might have been;
660 But neither when he fled the darksome womb, Nor in his childhood, nor in youth's fair prime, Nor when his chin thick hair o'erspread, with him Hath Justice converse held, or claimed him hers ;
Nor in this outrage on his Fatherland, Deem I she now beside him deigns to stand.
For Justice would in sooth belie her name
Did she with this all-daring man consort.
In these regards confiding will I go, Myself will meet him.
Who with better right ?
670 Brother 'gainst brother, chieftain against chief, And foeman against foe, I'll take my stand.
Quick, bring ray greaves, bulwark 'gainst spear and stones.
Dearest of mortals, son of CEdipus, Be not in wrath like him of fatal name;
Let Argive warriors with Cadmeians fight
It is enough ;
their blood may be atoned ;
But death of brothers, each by other slain,- Old age to such pollution never comes.
If any ono bear evil, let it be 680 Without disgrace, sole profit to the dead;
On base and evil deeds no glory waits.
What art so eager for, my son ?
Let not Infatuation's spell, Spear-frenzied, soul-possessing, bear thee on:
No, the first germ of evil passion quell.
Since God himself the matter presses on, Let all of Laios' race, 'neath Phoebos' ban, Drift with the breeze, Cocytos' wave its goal.
Thee passion biting to the quick
O'er masters, onward thou art led, A bitter-fruited deed to consummate 690 Of blood, unlawful for thy hand to shed.
E'en so, for my dear father's hostile curse, Now ripe, broods over my dry tearless eyes, Telling that later doom bath prior gain.
*But do not thou press on;
Thy life if Fortune crowneth, none As coward thee will brand.
Thy house Erinys, black with storm, will leave, When, proffer'd by thy hand, Due meed of sacrifice the gods receive.
The gods, methinks, have long neglected us, Our doom the only offering they esteem.
TOO
Why longer fawn then upon deadly fate ?
Now is the very hour
When near she stands.
Her hostile power
At length may own the sway Of tardy change-wind, and in kindlier mood Attend theo on thy way ;
But now she seethes with fury unsubdued.
Seethed over bath the curse of Œdipus.
Too true the Phantoms of my nightly dreams, Ghastly dividers of our father's wealth.
To women yield, although thou lovo them not.
Say what may yet bo done, and speak in brief.
710Tread not this pathway to the seventh gate.
My whetted soul with words thou shalt not blunt.
Such conquest, in defeat, the God respects.
The armèd warrior brooks not such a word.
Wouldst thou in sooth cull thine own brother's blood ?
Grant but the gods, from harm he shall not 'scape.
[Exit ETEOCLES.
I shudder lest the house-destroying Might, Unlike to gods, true prophetess of ill, A sire's invok'd Erinys, now fulfil 720 The wrathful curses, fraught with bitter hate, Of Œdipus infatuate.
Child-slaying Eris urges on the fight.
The lots between them doth a stranger deal, Chalybian colonist from Scythia's bound, Divider stern of wealth, raw-hearted steel, Who to the twain allotteth so much ground To dwell on as they hold when slain, Stript of all portion in their wide domain.
730But when in death they lie, Spear-mangled, each by other slain ;
—
When drinks their native dust the gory rain,
Who then with lustral rites may purify ?
Who cleanse them from that stain ?
0 horrors new upon this house that wait, Blent with the direful ills of earlier date IFor of the crime I tell
On which of old swift vengeance fell, 740 Yet whoso dread issue the third ago doth wait;
When Laios, 'gainst Apollo's will divine, From Pythia's central shrine
Who thrice proclaimed the sacred oracle, "Die without issue wouldst thou save the State,—"Yet he, by friends o'erpower'd, perverse of mind, Begat his proper woo In Œdipus, tho parricide, who dared, In field unliallow'd whenco ho sprang, to sow 750 A bloody offshoot.
Frenzy blind

THE combat between the Titans and the Olympian Gods, issuing in the triumph of the latter, constitutes, as Hegel remarks, the central fact of Hellenic my­ thology.
This hoary legend may be regarded as symbolizing in the physical universe the emergence of order out of chaos, while in the history of religious thought it marks a period of transition, characterized mainly by the metamorphosis of the nature-powers, the objects of men's earlier worship, into the humanized divinities of Hellas, involving the recognized supremacy of the higher over the lower elements of being.
One phase of this struggle is treated by AEschylus in the drama of the Eumenides;
there the hoary god­ desses, the dark vengeance-powers of the primeval world, are brought into harmonious subordination to Pallas Athena, the impersonation of the wisdom and benignity of Zeus.
Another aspect of the conflict formed the subject of the Promethean trilogy, which set forth the relation between the finite and the supreme will, in their antagonism and their reconciliation.
Among the grand ideals bequeathed to the world by Hellenic genius there is none, perhaps, which has more deeply impressed the poetic imagination than the much­ enduring Titan;
none, certainly, which has for a longer period coloured the stream of philosophic thought.
The Promethean myth, it must be remembered, was not the invention of either Hesiod or Æschylus;
its root, as Bunsen remarks, is older than the Hellenes themselves.
Even at the present day, the legend, in its rudest form, may be traced among the Iranian tribes of the Caucasus, while in our western world it has in­ spired the genius of more than one great poet of modern times.
The three dramas of which the trilogy consisted arc believed to have been “ Prometheus, the Fire-bringer,” " Prometheus Bound," and " Prometheus Unbound," of which the second has alone survived.-
Prometheus there appears as the champion and benefactor of mail­ kind, whose condition, at the close of the Titanic age, is depicted as weak and miserable in the extreme :
“Seeing, they saw in vain ;
Hearing, they heard not;
but like shapes in dream?, Through the long time all things at random mixed.
”Zeus, it is said, proposed to annihilate these puny ephemerals, and to plant upon the earth a new race in their stead.
Prometheus represents himself as having frustrated this design, and as being consequently sub­ jected, for tho sake of mortals, to the most agonising pain, inflicted by the remorseless cruelty of Zens.
We have thus the Titan, the symbol of finite reason and free will, depicted as the sublime philanthropist, while Zeus, the supreme deity of Hellas, is portrayed as the cruel and obdurate despot, a character peculiarly re­ volting to Athenian sentiment.
The attempt to explain this apparent anomaly has given rise to a variety of theories and speculations.
It is urged by some that at the time of Æschylus so sharp a line was drawn, in the minds of educated men, between religion and mythology, that the latter was accepted simply as poetical imagery, and was employed by the poet without any definite moral aim.
Others imagine, with Welcker, that Æschylus, as a contemporary of Zenophanes, and one initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, maintained an antagonistic attitude towards the traditional creed, and that in the Promethean trilogy he seized the opportunity to enter his protest against it, by representing the head of the Olympian system under so revolting an aspect.
It must be remembered, how­ ever, that the Athenian drama formed part of a solemn religious festival, celebrated by the entire population, and that the popular theology was intertwined with the national and political life not only of Athens, but of Hellas.
The magnificent statues of Pallas Athena and of Olympian Zeus, executed at enormous cost by Phidias, the contemporary of Æschylus, were doubtless regarded by the multitudes assembled at the national festivals as symbols of divine and very awful realities;
and if we turn to the remaining dramas of the poet we find his delineation of these divinities in harmony with this conception.
Zeus, more especially, is represented as uniting in himself the sublimest attributes of deity.
The Chorus, in their solemn invocation (Ag. 160), lay peculiar stress upon the name of Zeus, as the supreme deity, the prime source of consolation and of wisdom.
He is elsewhere portrayed as the almighty ruler (Sup. 795), who by ancient law directs destiny (Sup. 655), and without whose will nothing is accom­ plished for mortals (Sup. 804).
He is invoked as king of kings, most blest among the blest, of powers on high most perfect power (Sup. 519).
He is likewise apo­ strophised as father, creator, king, supreme artificer, wielding no delegated sway, and whose deed is prompt as his word to execute the designs of his deep-coun­ selling mind (Sup. 587).
He is the all-seeing father (Sup. 130);
lord of ceaseless ages (Sup. 567);
the guardian of the guest (Ag. 353);
the punisher of over­ weening pride (Per. 822);
the upholder of tho righteous law of retribution (Ag. 154).
Many more passages of a similar character might bo adduced, from which it would appear that the poet, though not emancipated from the errors and limitations of Polytheism, had, nevertheless, risen to the sublime ideal of one supremo ruler, whose righteous will was identified with tho eternal decrees of destiny.
Instead of placing himself in antagonism with tho popular religion, ho seems rather, as the prophet of Polytheism, to havo striven to elevate the popular conception of Zeus, and of tho other Hellenie divinities, more especially Apollo and Pallas Athena, who are represented in tho Oresteia as tho willing but subordinate executors of their father's will.
It seems improbable that in the Promethean trilogy alone he should assume an attitude towards the popular religion utterly irreconcilable with the tendencies manifested in his remaining works;
the apparent con­ tradiction has doubtless arisen from the loss of the concluding drama.
I agree with those critics who think that if we possessed it we should see the majesty of Zeus fully vindicated, and reconciliation established between the contending powers.
As it seems unreasonable to accept, without quali­ fication, the gross picture of Zeus as represented, in the extant drama, by his exasperated adversary, Prometheus, so we must look elsewhere for the true ground of the antagonism subsisting between him and the Olympian divinities, all of whom are arrayed against him.
Though the Promethean myth, as related by Plato, in the “ Protagoras," differs in many essential features from the version of Æschylus, yet the fundamental thought there embodied is so completely in harmony with the teaching of the prophet-bard, that it may be referred to as, perhaps, throwing light upon the moral significance of the trilogy.
In the “ Protagoras " a distinction is drawn between the wisdom which minis­ ters to physical well-being, and political wisdom which enables men to live in organized communities.
Pro­ metheus is represented as having endowed men with the former, but as unable to invest them with the latter, which involved the exercise of justice, and was under the special guardianship of Zeus.
Now it is this quality of justice which was bestowed upon mortals by Zeus that Æschylus extols with peculiar emphasis.
"Riches," he says, "afford no bulwark to him who spurns the mighty altar of justice" (Ag. 381);
firm based is justice (Cho. 635) ;
" all must perish who withstand her mandates" (Cho. 630).
Justice is styled the .daughter of Zeus (Cho. 934);
reverence for her altar is characterized as the sum of wisdom (Eum. 510).
It was, moreover, an idea familiar to the Æschylean age that all excellence was the gift of the gods, more especially of Zeus, and that it could not be obtained without their intervention. "
God alone is good," sang Simonides ;
“ no one wins virtue without tho aid of the gods, neither a state nor an individual."
" Zeus, the great virtues attend upon mortals from thee," sang Pindar ;
“ and,” he adds, " prosperity lives longer with those who revere thee, but with perverse minds it docs not equally abide, thriving for all time" (Isthm. Odo iii.) “ Through the favour of God man blooms with a wise heart."* " An untainted mind," according to Æschylus, is “ heaven's first gift."
The Chorus remind Prometheus of “ the dreamlike feebleness that fetters the blind race of mortals " (Pro. 55G);
an expression which recalls Pindar's description of meu as “ tho dream of a shadow;
” “yet,” he adds, " when splendour given by the god comes to them, a brilliant light falls upon men and a sweet life " (Pyth. Ode viii. Epode 5).
Not only was Prometheus unablo to endow mortals with these higher attributes;
by conferring upon them benefits contrary to the will of Zeus, he, in fact, alienated them from the gods, in fellowship with whom, according to the Greek ideal, men found their highest well-being.
He may thus be regarded as personifying that in­ surgent condition of the will which, blind to the per­ ception of higher truth, is full of arrogant self-con­ fidence and all-defying pride.
In many respects he offers a parallel to Milton's Satan, " a creation requiring in its author almost the spiritual energy with which he invests the fallen Seraph."
The Titan chained to his solitary rock, and the archangel prone upon the lake of fire, stand alone, the one in ancient, the other in modern literature, as stupendous examples of indomitable will;
of both it may be said with truth that, " what chains us, as with a resistless spell, in such a character, is spiritual might made visible by the racking pains which it overpowers.
"
*For the Titan, however, there is deliverance, and the.
extant fragments of the concluding member of the trilogy enable us to form some idea as to the agency by which it was accomplished.
At the opening of the " Prometheus Unbound " the Titan was seen brought once more to light, after the lapse of ages, from the abyss into which he had been hurled at the conclusion of the “ Prometheus Bound."
He was still chained to the rock, with the additional torment of the eagle, which daily preyed upon his liver.
The punishments of the Titans, like the Titanic powers themselves, re­ present the absence of rule or measure;
the restless insatiability of the lower passions and desires when, with self-asserting insolence, they bid defiance to the restraints of law.
Under his prolonged torment the spirit of Prometheus is somewhat subdued ;
this change he himself prophesies in the previous drama (Pro. 520), where he says— "
By myriad pangs and woes Bowed down, thus shall I 'scape these bonds.
”Wo are here reminded of the poet's utterances respect­ ing the discipline of suffering, which afford a clue to the significance of this feature of the legend­ "
To sober thought Zeus paves the way, And wisdom links with pain.
Against their will Rebellious men are tutored to be wise.”—(Ag. 170.) "
Well-earned is wisdom at the cost of pain.”-(Eum. 499.)
The Chorus consisted of the twelve Titans, six male and six female personages, who, redeemed from Tar­ taros, visibly represent one of the two worlds whose strife and reconciliation formed the subject of tho trilogy.
The elementary forces of nature, personified as gods, must bo defeated in order to assure dominion to a more spiritual order of divinities;
but when tho triumph of mind has been assured, tho once rebellious nature-powers reappear, as beneficent but subordinate agents.
*They open the drama with an ode in which they describe the journey they have taken in order to pay Prometheus a visit of sympathy.
In the well-known fragment translated by Cicero, Prometheus, in return, narrates his sufferings, describes the torment he endures from the eagle, and longs for death as the goal of his anguish.
Herakles* next appears upon the scene, and in him Prometheus recognizes his heaven-appointed deliverer.
Nowhere are the noble and the repulsive features of Hellenic mythology more remarkably associated than in the numerous legends which gather round the person of Herakles.
The fundamental idea embodied in this Zeus-born hero is, however, that of irresistible power, " whose action is as beneficent to the children of men as it is fatal to the enemies of light."
The heroic deeds of Herakles are glorified by Pindar (Nem. i. 33, 34, 62-72), who also appeals to them as authenticating his divine vocation ;
while, according to the rhetorician Aristides, he was styled by men their saviour, the averter of evil.
Nowhere, however, is he introduced in this character more significantly than as the liberator of Prometheus.
According to Hellenic mythology,† Herakles closed the line of heroes, the earth-born sons of Zeus, whose mission it was to ennoble and elevate the human race.
He therefore exhibited the highest result of the fellow­ ship of Zens with mortals, of which Io was one of the first recipients.
Hence the significance of her appear­ ance in the " Prometheus Bound."
She, like the Titan, resisted the divine will, and, like him, must stiffer the penalty of her rebellion;
accordingly the account of her sufferings, as, wailing and distraught, she pursues her toilsome wanderings, serves to heighten the impres­ sion of the cruel tyranny of Zeus, which it is the object of that drama to produce.
In “ The Suppliants," however, Zeus appears in rela­ tion to Io, not as the obdurate tyrant, but as the beneficent deity, whose severest judgments issue in blessings to the individual and to mankind.
Doubtless, under this aspect he would have been represented in the third member of the Promethean trilogy.
Hcrakles inquires from Prometheus his way to the gardens of the Hesperides;
the Titan, in reply, de­ scribes his journey thither, and announces the dangers which he will have to encounter.
Forthwith the eaglo appears, winging its flight towards Prometheus :
Herakles utters tho exclamation, “ Archer Apollo, surely guide mine arrow,” draws his bow, and slays tho pest.
In what manner tho subsequent liberation of Pro­ metheus was effected wo have no means of determining ;
whether Herakles himself unloosed his chains, or whether this was accomplished through the intervention of Hermes, or some other divinity;
whether Herakles prevailed upon Zens to accept Cheire11 as a substitute for Prometheus, and whether Cheiron voluntarily descended into Hades;
and, finally, whether the Gods appeared upon the seene, to celebrate, with Prometheus and the Titans, the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis- these are questions to which neither the fragments themselves, nor the testimony of other witnesses, enable us to return a satisfactory answer, and I conse­ quently abstain from entering upon them.
The chief interest, however, centres in the mind of Prometheus, and upon the agency by which the areh­ rebel was transformed into the willing subject and minister of Zeus.
The spectacle of his brother and sister Titans and Titan esses redeemed from durance would tend to correct the false impression which had possessed his mind respecting the ruthless tyranny of Zeus, and consequently the gnawing desire to witness his humiliation would give place to the unreluctant re­ cognition of his supremacy.
He would accordingly no longer refuse to reveal the secret, upon the disclo­ sure of which he, in his blindness, imagined the main­ tenance of that supremacy to depend.*
In Hesiod Zeus is represented as allowing himself to be apparently deceived by Prometheus, when he taught men to bring worthless offerings to the Gods;
the Titan there ap­ pears as the trickster caught at last in his own wiles.
That the reign of Zeus, whom the poet elsewhere extols as " The Lord of ceaseless ages," " Most blessed among the blest," should be conceived of by him as contingent upon the word of Prometheus, seems to me incredible.
The voluntary revelation of his supposed secret was the token that the all-defying rebel was transformed into the willing subject and minister of Zeus.
It is related * that Zeus, when he released Prome­ theus from his chains, required him, as a slight volun­ tary punishment, to bind his head with branches of the agnus-eastus (λύγος), a plant frequently employed for religious purposes.
The same symbolic signification was, in after times, attached to the ring of Prometheus, referred to by Catullus and Pliny.
The former relates that when Prometheus appeared at the marriage festival of Peleus and Thetis, he wore a ring, as a slight token of his ancient punishment:
" Extenuata gerens veteris vestigia pœnæ;
t Quam quondam silici restrictus membra catena Persolvit, pendens c verticibus præruptis.
”Not as an ornament, says Pliny (xxxiii. 4), has Prometheus worn the iron ring.
but as a chain ;
and (xxxvii. 1), as a slight token of punishment, a piece of the rock to which he had been fastened was inserted in the ring instead of a gem.
Tho iron finger-ring is not.
like tho lugos-crown, expressly referred back to Æschylus;
tho same signi­ fication, however, attaches to both, and it is not probable, as Welcker remarks, that they should not have been associated in the ancient legend.
Thus the dignity of man, of whom Prometheus may be regarded as the representative, is fully vindicated, when, instead of rebelling against the restraints of law, he joyfully accepts them, and finds his true liberty in obedience;
thenceforth the crown, the token of sub­ mission, is transformed into an honourable adornment, and the iron ring becomes the symbol of a holy con­ secration.
*Thus we may imagine was brought about the re­ conciliation of the powers whose antagonism formed the subject of the “ Prometheus Bound."
We cannot but admire the marvellous art with which the poet, while making his personages the representatives of certain ab­ stract principles, at the same time endows them with life and sharply-defined individuality.
This impression of reality is heightened in Prometheus by the allusion of the Chorus to his marriage with their sister Hesione.
The chorus of colossal Titans, delivered at length from their mighty toils, and assisting at the deliverance of Prometheus, seems to me one of the grandest conceptions that ever entered a poet's mind.
It harmonizes with the Æschylean conception of Zeus, as head of the Olympian hierarchy, reigning supreme in the domain of nature and of mind.
In concluding this very inadequate study of a great subject, I will allude, in a few words, to the theory propounded by Professor Kuhn, with reference to the Promethean myth.*
He considers the name of the Titan to be derived from the Sanscrit word Pramantha, the instrument used for kindling fire.
The root mand, or manth, implies rotatory motion, and the word manthami, used to denote the process of fire-kindling, acquired the secondary sense of snatching away ;
hence we find another word of the same stock, pramatha, signi­ fying theft.
The word manthami passed into the Greek language, and became the verb manthanô, to learn;
that is to say to appropriate knowledge ;
whence prometheia, fore­ knowledge, forethought.
Prometheus, the fire-bringer, is the Pramantha personified, and finds his prototype in the Aryan Matarisvan, a divine or semi-divino per­ sonage, closely associated with Agni, the fire-god of the Vedas.
We have thus another curious instance of the common elements which may be detected in the Vedic and Hellenic mythology, while the development of the Promethean myth affords an instructive illustra­ tion of the mode in which words, originally having reference to natural phenomena, gradually became invested with new and more spiritual significance when transplanted to the soil of Hellas.
T 0 earth's remotest plain we now are come, To Scythia’s confine, an untrodden waste.
Hephæstos!
Thou the mandates must observe Enjoin’d thee by thy sire ;
this miscreant 'Gainst lofty-beetling rocks to clasp in fetters Of adamantine bonds, unbreakable.
For that the splendour of all-working fire, Thy proper flower, he stole, and gave to mortals.
Such crime he to the gods must expiate;
So may he learn the sovereignty of Zeus 10 To bear, and cease from mortal-loving wont.
Ho!
Strength and Force, for you the word of Zeus Its goal hath reached, no obstacle remains;
But I of daring lack, a brother god Fast to this storm-vexed cleft perforce to bind.
Yet so to dare is sheer necessity ;
For grievous 'tis the father's words to slight.
Right-judging Themis' lofty-thoughted son,
Thee 'gainst thy will must I unwilling nail With stubborn shackles to this desert height, 20 Where neither voice nor form of living man Shall meet thy ken;
but, shrivelled by the blaze
Of the bright sun, thy skin's fair bloom shall wither;
Welcome to thee shall glittering-vestured night O'erveil the brightness;
welcome too the sun Shall with new beams scatter the morning rime;
Thus evermore shall weight of present ill Outwear thee:
for as yet is no one born
Who may relieve thy pain :
such meed hast thou From mortal-loving wont;
—for thou, a god, Not crouching to the wrath of gods, didst bring To mortal men high gifts, transgressing right.
30 Hence shalt thou sentinel this joyless rock, Erect, unsleeping, bending not the knee ;
And many a moan shalt pour and many a plaint, Vainly ;
for Zeus obdurate is of heart;
And harsh is overy one when new of sway.
Let be!
Why dally and vain pity vent ?
This god, to gods most hateful, why not hate, Who thy prerogative to men betrayed ?
Awful is kindred blood, and fellowship.
True, but the father's word to disobey— 40 How many that be?
Fearest not that still more?
Aye ruthless art thou, full of insolence.
Him to bemoan availeth nought ;
-but thou Spend not thy strength in toil that profits not.
Alas !
my much-detested handicraft!
Why hate thy craft ?
for, sooth to say, thine art
Is no way guilty of these present woes.
Yet would that it to other hand had fallen.
All save o'er gods to rule, vexatious is, For none is free, save father Zeus alone.
50Too well I know it:
answer have I none.
Haste then:
around the culprit cast these bonds
Lest father Zeus behold thee loitering.
Behold the shackles ready here for use.
Cast them around his hands :
with mighty force Smite with the hammer, nail him to the rocks.
The work so far is finished ;
--not amiss.
Strike harder yet:
clench fast:
be nowhere slack.
His wit will find a way where no way is.
This arm, at least, is fast beyond escape.
GOThis too clamp firmly down ;
so may he learn, Shrewd though he be, he duller is than Zeus.
No ono but he could justly censure me.
Of adamantine wedge the stubborn fang Straight through his breast now drive, right sturdily.
Alas!
Prometheus !
I lament thy pangs.
Dost shrink, lamenting o'cr the foes of Zeus?
Beware, lest some day for thyself thou grieve.
A sight thou seest, grievous to the eye.
I see him meeting with his own deserts:
70 But come, around his sides the girdings cast.
Urge thee I will;
ay, hound thee to the work;
Get thee below ;
forceful enring his legs.
There, finished is the work, nor great the toil.
Now the bored fetters strike right lustily;
For stern the overlooker of these works.
Like to thy shape the utterance of thy tongue.
Be thou soft-hearted but upbraid not me, For stubborn will and ruggedness of heart.
80Let us begone ;
his limbs are iron-meshed.
Hero taunt away, and the gods' honours filching, Bestow on creatures of a day ;
from thee How much can mortals of these woes drain off?
Thee falsely do the gods Prometheus * name, For a Prometheus thou thyself dost need, To plan releasement from this handiwork.[
Exeunt HEPHÆSTOS, STRENGTH, and FORCE.
Oh holy ether, swiftly-wingèd gales, Fountains of rivers, and of ocean-waves Innumerable laughter, general mother Earth, 90 And orb all-seeing of the sun, I call:
Behold what I, a god, from gods endure.
See, wasted by what pains
Wrestle I must while myriad time shall flow!
Such ignominious chains
Hath ho who nowly reigns, Chief of the blest, devised against mo.
Woe!
Ah woo!
the torture of tho hour I wail, ay, and of anguish'd throes
The future dower, How, when, shall rise a limit to these woes?
100 And yet what say I ?
clearly I foreknow
All that must happen ;
nor can woe betide Stranger to mo;
the Destined it behoves, As best I may, to bear, for well I wot How incontestable the strength of Fate.
Yet in such strait silence to keep is hard,- Hard not to keep;
-for, bringing gifts to mortals, Myself in these constraints hapless am yoked.
Stored within hollow wand fire's stealthy fount I track, which to mankind in every art 110 Hath teacher proved, and mightiest resource.
Such forfeits I for such offences pay,— Beneath the welkin nailed in manacles.
Hist!
Hist!
what sound,
What odour floats invisibly around, Of God, or man, or intermediate kind ?
Comes to this rocky bound, Ono to behold my woes or seeking aught ?
A god ye see in fetters, anguish-fraught;
The foe of Zeus, in hatred held of all The deities who throng Zeus' palace-hall;
120 For that to men I bore too fond a mind.
Woe, woe !
what rustling sound Hard by, as if of birds, doth take mine ear ?
Whistles the ether round
With the light whirr of pinions hovering near.
Whate'er approaches filleth me with fear.
Fear not!
a friendly troop we reach
On rival-speeding wing this cliff forlorn ;
130
Our sire's consent wringing by suasive speech, Me swift-eseorting gales have hither borne.
For iron's clanging note Piercing our caves' recesses rang, And bashful shyness from mo smote;
- Forthwith on wingèd car, unshod, aloft I sprang.
Alas !
alas!
Woe!
woe !
Prolific Tethys' offspring, progeny 14.0
Of sire Occanos, whose sleepless flow All the wide earth encircles !
gaze and see Bound with what fetters, ignominiously, I, on the summit of this rock-bound steep, Shall watch unenvied keep.
I see, Prometheus, and through fear Doth mist of many tears mine eyes bedew, As, 'gainst this rock.
parched up, in tortures drear
Of adamantine bonds, thy form I view.
130 For helmsmen new of sway Olympos hold ;
by laws new-mado Zeus wieldeth empire, impulse-swayed;
The mighty ones of old he sweeps away.
Neath earth, ’neath Hales' shade-receiving plains, Sheer down to Tartaros' unmeasured gloom Would he had hurled mo ruthless, bound with chains
That nono may loose ;
-So then at this my doom 160 Had no one mock'd,—nor god, nor other kind.
But now most wretched, sport of every wind, Focs triumph o'er my pains.
Who of the gods a heart doth own
So hard, to mock at thy despair ?
Who at thy woes, save Zeus alone, Doth not thine anguish share ?
But ruthless still, with soul unbent, The heavenly race he tames, nor will refrain 170 Till sated to his heart's content;
Or till another, by some cunning snare, Wrest from his grasp the firmly guarded reign.
Yet e'en of me although now wrung
In stubborn chains shall he have need, This ruler of the blest-to read
The counsel new by which his sway And honours shall be stript away.
But not persuasion's honied tongue
My stedfast soul shall charm;
180 Nor will I, crouching in alarm, Divulge the secret, till these savage chains
He loose, and yield requital for my pains.
Daring thou art and yieldest nought For bitter agony;
with tongue Unbridled thou art all too free.
But by keen fear my heart is stung;
I tremble for thy doom—ah, me!
Thy barque into what haven may'st thou steer, 190 Of these dire pangs the end to see ?
For inaccessible, of mood severe Is Kronos' soil, inflexible his thought.
That Zens is stern full well I know, And by his will cloth measure right.
But, smitten by this destined blow, Softened shall one day be his might.
Then curbing his harsh temper, he Full eagerly will hither wend, To join in league and amity with me, Eager no less to welcome him as friend.
20UTo us thy tale unfold;
the whole speak out;
Upon what charge Zeus, seizing thee, doth thus Outrage with harsh and ignominious pain ?
Inform us if the telling breed no harm.
Grievous to me it is these things to tell, Grief to bo silent:
trouble every way.
When first the heavenly powers were moved to rage, And in opposing factions ranged their might, These wishing Kronos from his sent to hurl That Zeus forsooth might reign ;
these,counter-wise, 210 Resolved that o'er the gods Zeus no'or should rule;
Then I with sagest counsel st rove to movo The Titans, progeny of Heaven and Earth, But strove in vain ;
for they, in stubborn souls
Of crafty wiles disdainful, thought by force, An easy task, the mastery to gain.
But me, not once but oft, my mother Themis, And Earth (one shape with many names) had told Prophetic, how the future should be wrought.
That not by strength of thew or hardiment 220 Should mastery be compassed, but by guile;
But when this lore I did expound in words,
They deigned me not a single look ;
whereon,
Of courses free to choose, the wisest seemed Leagued with my mother, of my own free will The will of Zeus to meet, siding with him, And by my counsels black-roofed Tartaros’
Murky abyss primeval Kronos now Engulfs with his allies ;
such benefits
From me the tyrant of the gods received, 230 And hath requited with these base returns.
For, someway, cleaveth aye to tyranny
This fell disease ;
to have no faith in friends.
But touching now your question, on what charge
He thus maltreats me ;
this will I make clear.
When seated on his father's throne, forthwith, He to the several gods was dealing out Their several honours, marshalling his realm;
But he of toil-worn mortals took no count;
The race entire he ardently desired 240 To quench, and plant a new one in its stead.
And none but I opposed his purposes ;
I dared alone;
—I saved the mortal race From sinking blasted down to Hades' gloom.
For this by these dire tortures I am bent, Grievous to suffer, piteous to behold.
I who did mortals pity, of like grace
Am deem'd unworthy,-but am grimly thus Tuned to his will, a sight of shame to Zeus.
Iron of heart, ay, fashion'd out of rock 250
Who at thy pangs thine anger shareth not, Prometheus;
for myself, fain had I shunned This sight ;
-beholding it, my heart is wrung.
To friends, in sooth, a spectacle of woe.
But beyond this didst haply aught essay ?
Mortals I hindered from foreseeing death.
Finding what medicine for this disease ?
Blind hopes I caused within their hearts to dwell.
Vast boon was this thou gavest unto mortals.
Yea, and besides 'twas I that gave them fire.
260Have now these short-lived creatures flame-eyed fire ?
Ay, and by it full many arts will learn.
Upon such charges doth Zeus outrage thee, Nor aught abateth of thy miseries ?
To this dire struggle is no term assigned ?
No other but what seemeth good to him.
How may this be ?
What hope ?
Seest thou not
That thou hast erred ?
But in what way hast erred,
That to unfold,-while me it gladdens not, To thee is pain.
Forbear we then this theme ;
But from this struggle seek thou some escape.
270Whoso his foot holdeth unmesh'd of harm, For him 'tis easy to exhort and warn One sorely plagued.
But this I all foreknew ;
Of will, free will, I erred, nor will gainsay it.
Mortals abetting I myself found bale ;
Not that I thought, with penalties like these, To wither thus against sky-piercing rocks, Doomed to this drear and solitary height.
But ye, no further wail my present woes, But, on the ground alighting, hear from mo 280 On-gliding fate-so shall ye learn the end.
Yield to me, prithee yield, and grieve with him Who now is wretched.
Thus it is that grief Ranging abroad alights on each in turn.
To no unwilling ears thy words Appeal, Prometheus ;
and with nimble feet Leaving our swiftly wafted seat
And holy ether, track of birds, I to this rugged ground draw near;
290 Thy woes from first to last I fain would hear.
The goal of my long course I gain, And come, Prometheus, to thy side.
This swift-winged bird without a bit I rein.
My will his only guide.
Compassion for thy fate, be sure, I feel;
Thereto the tie of kin constraineth me:
But blood apart, to no one would I deal More honour than to thee.
300 That true my words thou soon shalt know;
No falsely glozing tong no is mine ;
Come, how I may assist thee plainly show, For than Oceanos a friend more leal Thou ne'er shalt boast as thine.
Ha!
What means this?
Art thou too hither come Spectator of my pangs ?
How hast thou dared Quitting thy namesake flood, thy rock-roofd caves Self-wrought, this iron-teeming land to reach ?
Art come indeed to gaze upon my doom, 310 And with my grievous woes to sympathize ?
A spectacle behold ;
-this friend of Zeus, This co-appointer of his sovereignty, By what dire anguish I by him am bow'd.
I see, Prometheus, and would fain to thee, All subtle as thou art, best counsel give;
Know thine own self, thy manners mould anew, For new the monarch who now rules the gods ;
But if thou thus harsh, keenly-whetted words Still hurlest, Zeus, though thron'd so far aloft, 320 Mayhap may hear thee, so the pangs which now His wrath inflicts but childish sport may seem.
But come, 0 much enduring, quell thy rage;
Seek thou releasement from these miseries;
Stale may appear to thee the words I speak;
Yet such the penalty that waits, Prometheus, On a too haughty tongue;
But thou, e'en now Nowise art humbled, nor dost yield to ills, But to the present wouldest add new woe;
Therefore, I charge thee, hearkening my rede, 330 Kick not against the pricks, since harsh the king
Who now holds sway, accountable to none.
And now I go and will forthwith essay
If I avail to free thee from these toils.
But be thou calm nor over-rash of speech;
Knowest thou not, being exceeding wise, That to the froward tongue cleaves chastisement.
Much joy I give thee scatheless as thou art, Though in all plots and daring leagued with me.
But now let be;
forbear thy toil:
for Him 340 Persuade thou canst not:
Him no suasion moves ;
Nay, lest the journey breed thee harm, beware.
More cunning art thou others to advise
Than thine own self.
By deed I judge, not word;
But, fixed is my resolve, hold me not back;
For sure I am, yea, sure, that Zeus to mo Will grant this boon, and loose thee from these pains.
For this I praise thee, nor will ccaso to praiso ;
For nought of kindly zeal thou lackest;
yet, Toil not, for vain, nor helpful unto me, 350 Thy toil will prove,-if toil indeed thou wilt ;
—
But hold thco quiet rather, keep aloof;
For I, though in mishap, not therefore wish Wide-spreading fellowship of woo to see.
No truly, for my brother Atlas' doom Grieves me, who.
stationed on the western verge, The pillars on his shoulders beareth up
Of heaven and earth ;
burthen of painful grasp.
So. in Cilician caves with ruth I saw Their earth-born tenant, hostile prodigy, 360 The hundred-headed, eurb'd by violence;
Raging Typhôeus, all the gods who braved, Hissing out slaughter from his horrid jaws.
Forth from his eyeballs flash'd a hideous glare, As though by force the reign of heaven to storm.
But on him fell the sleepless dart of Zeus, The thunder-bolt down-rushing, breathing flame, Which him from his high-worded boasting hurl'd Prostrate;
for, smitten to his inmost reins, With strength burnt out, he lightning-blasted fell.
370 And now his frame, helpless and sprawling lies Hard by the salt-sea narrows, sorely prest Beneath the roots of Ætna.
Seated there,
Upon the topmost peaks, Hephæstos smites
The molten masses, whence one day shall burst Torrents of fire, devouring with fierce jaws
The level fields of fruitful Sicily.
Such rage Typhôeus shall anew belch forth With scorching missiles of fire-breathing storm Insatiate;
by the fierce bolt of Zeus so Blasted, but unconsum'd.
No tiro thou, Nor dost my teaching need.
Save thou thyself
As best thou knowest how.
But be assured I to the dregs my present doom will drain, Until the heart of Zeus relax its ire.
Know'st thou not this, Prometheus, that wise words
To a distemper'd mind physicians are ?
Ay, if well-timed they mollify the heart, Nor with rude pressure chafe its swelling ire.
True:
but if forethought be with boldness leagued, What lurking mischief seest thou ?
Instruct me.
390Light-minded folly and superfluous toil.
Still from this ailment let me ail, since most
The wise it profiteth not wise to seem.
But haply mine this error may appear.
Certes, thine argument remands me home.
Good!
Lest thy plaint for me work thee ill-will.
With him now-seated on tho all-ruling throue ?
Of him bowaro that ne'er his heart bo vexed.
Thy plight, Prometheus, is my monitor.
Speed forth!
Begone !
Cherish thy present mood.
400To me right eager hast thou bayed that word, For my four-footed bird, with wings outspread, Fans the clear track of æther ;
fain, in sooth, In wonted stall to bend the weary knee.
Prometheus, I bewail thy doom of woe ;
From their moist fountains rise, Flooding my tender eyes, Tears that my cheek bedew.
0, cruel blow !
410 For Zeus by his own laws cloth now hold sway, And to the elder gods a haughty spear display.
Rings the whole country now with echoing groans.
The grand time-honour'd sway, Mighty now passed away, Of thee and of thy brethren, it bemoans.
And all who dwell on Asia's hallowed shore 420 Thy loud-resounding griefs with kindred grief deplore.
And Colchis' virgin daughters,
In fight a dauntless train ;
And round Mæotis’ waters The Scythian tribes, holding earth's outmost reign.
And those with sharp spears clanging
Who dwell, a hostile power, Fortress'd on rocks o’erhanging, 430 Near Caucasos,—Arabia’s martial flower.
*One only of the gods before thus bent Have I beheld, 'neath adamantine pains, Atlas, the Titan, who with many a groan Still on his back sustains, Vast burthen, the revolving firmament.
Chiming in cadence ocean-waves resound;
440 Moans the abyss, and Hades' murky gloom Bellows responsive in the depth profound ;
While fountains of clear-flowing rivers moan His piteous doom.
Think not that I through pride or stubbornness Keep silence;
nay, my brooding heart is gnawed Seeing myself thus marred with contumely ;
And yet what other but myself marked out To these new gods their full prerogatives?
But I refrain ;
for, nought my tongue would tell Save what ye know.
But rather list the ills 450 Of mortal men, how being babes before, I made them wise and masters of their wits.
This will I tell, not as in blame of men, But showing how from kindness flow'd my gifts.
For they, at first, though seeing, saw in vain;
Hearing they heard not, but, like shapes in dreams, Through the long time all things at random mixed ;
Of brick-wove houses, sunward-turn'd, nought knew, Nor joiner's craft, but burrowing they dwelt 460 Like puny ants, in cavern’d depths unsunned.
Neither of winter, nor of spring flower-strewn, Nor fruitful summer, had they certain sign, But without judgment everything they wrought, Till I to them the risings of the stars Discovered, and their settings hard to scan.
Nay, also Number, art supreme, for them I found, and marshalling of written signs, Handmaid to memory, mother of the Muse.
And I in traces first brute creatures yok'd, Subject to harness, with vicarious strength 470 Bearing in mortals' stead their heaviest toils.
And 'neath the car rein-loving steeds I brought, Chief ornament of wealth-abounding pomp.
And who but I the ocean-roaming wain For mariners invented, canvass-winged ?
Such cunning works for mortals I contrived, Yet, hapless, for myself find no device To free me from this present agony.
Unseemly woe thou bearest.
Driven astray 480 Flounders thy judgment, and like sorry leech Falling distemper'd, spiritless thou art, Nor remedies canst find thyself to cure.
Hearken the rest, and thou wilt marvel more
What arts and what resources I devised.
This chief of all;
if any one fell sick, No help there was, diet nor liniment, Nor healing draught;
but men, for lack of drugs Wasted away, till I to them revealed Commixtures of assuaging remedies 490 Which may disorders manifold repel.
Of prophecies the various modes I fixed, And among dreams did first discriminate The truthful vision.
Voices ominous, Hard to interpret, I to them made known:
And way-side auguries, the flight of birds With crooked talons, clearly I defined;
Showed by their nature which auspicious are.
And which ill-omened—taught the modes of life Native to each, and what, among themselves
Their feuds, affections, and confederacies.
500 Touching the smoothness of the vital parts,
And what the hue most pleasing to the gods, I taught them, and the mottled symmetry Of gall and liver.
Thighs encased
In fat With the long chino I burnt, and mortals guided To a mysterious art;
of fire-eyed signs, I purged the vision, over-filmed before.
Such were the boons I gave;
and 'neath the earth
Those other helps to men, concealed which lie, Brass, iron, silver, gold, who dares affirm 510 That before me he had discovered them ?
No one, I know, but who would idly vaunt.
The sum of all learn thou in one brief word;
All arts to mortals from Prometheus came.
Not now for mortals beyond measure care
Thy hapless self neglecting;
since, in sooth, Good hope have I that, loosen'd from these bonds, In might thou'lt prove an equal match for Zeus.
Not yet nor thus is it ordained that fate
These things shall compass ;
but by myriad pangs 520 And tortures bent, so shall I 'scape these bonds ;
Art than necessity is weaker far.
Who then is helmsman of necessity ?
The triform Fates and ever-mindful Furies.
Is Zeus in might less absolute than these ?
E'en he the fore-ordain'd cannot escape.
What is ordain'd for Zeus, save aye to reign ?
No further may'st thou question ;
urge me not.
Deep mystery, methinks, thou keepest veil’d.
Turn to some other theme;
not meet it is 530 Now to discourse of this, but close to wrap
In strictest silence ;
for, this secret kept, Unseemly bonds I 'scape and tortures keen.
Never may Zeus, who sole cloth reign, My will with adverse might oppose;
Nor I to servo the gods refrain, With rites of slaughter’d kine, where flows Father Oceanos’ exhaustless tide ;
540 Neither in word may I transgress!
Deep in my heart’s recess, Steadfast for ayo may this resolvo abide.
'Tis sweet to run life's long career
By hopes attended strong and bold, Feeding the heart in blithesome cheer ;
But thee I shudder to behold
By myriad tortures racked in sore distress.
550 For thou, of Zeus unaw'd, hast still, In pride and sheer self-will, Mortals, Prometheus, honour'd in excess.
What boots it, friend, when grace by grace
Is unrequited ?
In distress Say, from ephemera what aid ?
Hast not discerned the feebleness, Dream-like and weak, that man's blind race Cramps and confines?
No scheme by mortals laid 560 The harmony of Zeus shall e'er transgress.
This lesson from thy doom of pain I learnt, Prometheus.
On mine ear Alighteth now far other strain
Than that, 'mid Hymeneal mirth, Which erst, the bath and couch beside, I sang, what time our sister dear, Hesione, as thine espoused bride 570 Thou wast escorting, won by gifts of worth.
What country ?
What race ?
who is he, This man, whom, rock-bound, I survey, Storm-battered ?
What trespass bath thee Thus doomed to destruction ?
Oh, say, To what region of earth have I wandered, forlorn ?
Ah me!
The dire anguish!
Ah me!
Again the barbed pest cloth assail!
Thou phantom of Argos,* earth-born;
Avert him, 0 earth!
Ah, I quail, 580 The herdsman beholding with myriad eyes.
With crafty look, onward, still onward he hies;
Not even in death is he hid 'neath the earth ;
But, e'en from the shades coming back, He hounds me, forlorn one, in anguish of dearth, To roam by the sea-waves' salt track.
Still droneth the wax-moulded reed, Shrill-piping, a sleep-breathing strain.
590 Ah me!
The dire anguish !
Woe!
Woe !
Ah, whither on earth do these far roamings lead ?
What trespass canst find, son of Kronos, in me, That thou yokest me ever to pain?
Woe!
Ah, woe!
And wherefore with brize-driven fear torturo so A wretched one, phrenzied in brain ?
Oil burn mo with fire, or o’erwhelm 'neath the soil, Or fling mo to ravenous beasts of the sea.
Begrudge not, 0 lord!
to my prayers to give heed.
600 Enough hath out-worn me my much-roaming toil.
Xor wist I from torment how may I be freed.
The voice dost thou hear of the cow-hornèd maid ?
And how not hear the maid of Inachos, Brize-driven, who the heart of Zeus with love Doth warm, and now in courses all too long, Through Hera's hate, is rudely exercised ?
Whence know'st thou to speak my sire's name ?
610 Oh answer a wretched one's prayer ;
—
Ah me !
the dire anguish!
Woe!
Woe!
Who art thou, poor wretch, who dost truly proclaim
My plague, with its phrenzying torture, that came From Zeus and doth sting to despair ?
Woe!
ah woe!
With boundings, by food-craving anguish pursued, On rushing with passionate throe, By wrathful devices of Hera subdued, I come.
Of the wretched are any who know 620 Such pangs as I suffer ?
But now by clear sign, Reveal what for me yet remaineth to bear;
What cure for my plague.
If such knowledge be thine, Forthwith to the sud-roaming maiden declare.
Plainly I'll tell thee all thou wouldest learn, Not weaving riddles, but in simple phrase, As meet it is with friends to ope the lips.
Prometheus secst thou, giver of fire to mortals.
63CIo.
As mortals' common benefactor known, Hapless Prometheus, why art suffering thus ?
Scarce have I ceased singing my dirge of woe.lo.
To me then wilt thou not vouchsafe this boon ?
Say what thy quest, all shalt thou learn from me.
Io.
Reveal, in this ravine who fastened thee ?
The will of Zeus, but 'twas Hephæstos’ hand.
Io.
And of what crimes dost thou the forfeit pay?
Thus much alone to tell thee may suffice.
Io.
Then further of my roamings tell the goal.
640 What timo to me, poor outcast, yet must run?
This not to learn wero better than to learn.
Io.
Yet from me hide not what I needs must suffer.
Not chary am I of such boon to thee.
Io.
Then why delayest to make known the whole ?
Nothing I grudge, but shrink to vex thy heart.
Io.
Care not for me more than to me is sweet.
Thine eager wish constrains my tongue;
give ear.
Not yet:
to me my dole of pleasure deal;
Enquire we first into this maiden's plague, 650 Herself relating her sore-wasting fortunes.
Her residue of toil then teach us thou.
Io, thy task it is their wish to grant, The more so as thy father's sisters they.
Besides, fair guerdon waits on lengthened tale, When to deplore and wail one's evil plight Draws from the listeners the kindly tear.
Io.
I know not how I can deny your wish, So in clear word all ye desire to know That shall ye hear;
—Yet am I shamed to tell 660 Wherefore on me, forlorn one, burst the storm Heaven-sent and whence this form's disfigurement.
For evermore would nightly visions haunt
My virgin chambers, gently urging me With soothing words ;
—" 0 damsel, highly blest, Why longer live in maidenhood when thee Wait loftiest nuptials?
For by passion's dart Inflamed is Zens for thee and fain would share
The yoke of Kypris.
Spurn not thou, 0 child,
The couch of Zeus, but to the grassy mead 670 Of Lerna hie thee, to thy father's herds
And cattle-stalls, that so the eye of Zeus From longing may find respite."
By such dreams
From night to night still was I visited, Unhappy one ;
till, taking heart at length, lily night-born visions to my sire I told.
Then he to Pytho many a herald sent And to Dodona;
seeking to be taught How best, by deed or word, to please the gods.
But they returned, announcing oracles
Of riddling import, vague and hard to spell 680 At length to Inachos came clear response, By voice oracular commanding him From homo and father-laud to thrust me forth, At largo to range, as consecrate to heaven, Far as earth's utmost bonnds.
Should ho refuse, From Zeus would come the fiery thunderbolt, And his wholo ruce extirpate utterly.
Then yielding to such Loxian Oracles, He drave me forth, and barred me from his home, Against his will and mine;
but, forcefully, The curb of Zeus constrained him this to do.
690 Forthwith my shape and mind distorted were, And horned, as ye behold me, goaded on By gad-fly, keen of fang, with frenzied bounds I to Kerchneias’ limpid current rush'd, And fount of Lerna.
Then the earth-born herdsman, Hot-tempered Argos, ever dogged my steps, Gazing upon me with his myriad eyes.*
But him a sudden and unlooked-for fate Did reave of life ;
but I, brize-tortured, still Before the scourge divine am driven on 700 From land to land ;
the past thou hearest;
now If thou canst tell my future toils, say on, Nor, pity-moved, soothe me with lying tales, For garbled words, I hold, are basest ills.
Alas Alas!
Let be!
Never, oh never, had I thought
That words with such strange meaning fraught Would reach mine ear, 710 Nor that such horrors, woes, such cruel ill, So hard to gaze on, and so hard to bear, With double-pointed goad, my soul would chill.
Fate!
Fate !
ah me !
ah meI 1 shudder Io's woeful plight to see.
Too soon thou groanest and art full of fears.
Forbear till heard the remnant of my tale.
Speak, teach the whole.
To ailing ones 'tis sweet Clearly their coming sorrow to foreknow.
Your former boon from me lightly ye won, For first ye craved from Io’s self to learn 720 The story of her toil.
The rest now hearken,
What trials this young maid hath yet to bear From Hera.
Thou, too.
seed of Inachos, Cast in thy heart my words, that thou in full May’st of thy weary travel learn the goal.
First, turning hence towards the rising sun, Traverse uncultured wastes;
so shalt thou reach The Scythian nomads, who, ’neath wattled roofs,.
Uplifted dwell on waggons amply-wheeled, And are accoutred with far-darting bows.
730 Approach not these but, skirting with thy foot
The sounding breakers, hie thee from their land.
Towards the left the iron-workers dwell, The Chalybes, of whom thou must beware, As all uncouth, of strangers ill-approached.
Hybristes' * river then-not falsely named-
Thou'lt reach;
the ford, for hard it is to cross, Attempt not until Caucasos thou gain, Highest of mountains, from whose very brow The river spouteth forth its might;
forthwith Its crest surmounting, neighbour to the stars, 740 Southward direct thy course until thou reach
The host of man-abhorring Amazons, Who Themiscyra, near Thermodon's stream, Shall one day people, where the cruel jaw Of Salmydessus ‡ hems the briny sea, Rude host to sea-men, step-dame unto ships;
These will conduct thee and right willingly ;
Then the Kimmerian isthmus § thou shalt gain Hard by the narrow portals of the lake, Which it behoveth thee with dauntless heart
To leave, and traverse the Mæotic strait;
750 And evermore among mankind shall live
The mighty record of thy passage there, For men from thee shall call it Dosporos.
Quitting the plain of Europe, thou shalt come To Asia's continent.
-How think ye ?
say,
Seems not the monarch of the gods to be Ruthless alike in all ?
For he, a god, Yearning to meet in love a mortal maid, Upon her did impose these wanderings ?
A bitter wooer hast thou found, 0 maid, For wedlock bond ;
-for what thine cars have heard Account not e'en the prelude to thy toils.
760Io.
Ah woe is me!
Woe!
Woe!
Anew dost shriek and moan ?
What wilt thou do When thou the remnant of thy woe hast heard ?
How, hast thou aught of sorrow yet to tell ?
Ay, sea tempestuous of all-baleful grief.
Io.
What boots it then to livo ?
Why not with speed Hurl myself headlong from this rugged cliff, That, dashed upon tho ground, I from my woes Respite may find ?
Better to die at onco
Than all my days to linger out in pain.
770III wouldst thou bear, methinks, my agonies, To whom it is not fore-ordained to die, For death would be releasement from my pangs.
But now there is no limit to my woes, Before that Zeus from sovereignty be hurled.
Io.
How !
Shall
Zeus ever be from empire hurled ?
Thou wouldest joy, methinks, such hap to see.
Io.
How should I not who suffer ill from Zeus ?
That thus it shall be it is thine to learn.
Io.
By whom despoiled of his imperial sway?
780Spoiled by himself and his own senseless plans.
Io.
But how ?
Declare, if telling bring no harm.
Wedlock contracting he shall one day rue.
What matters it ?
This may not be disclosed.
Io.
Shall then his consort drive him from his throne ?
PROMETHEUS.Ay, a son bearing stronger than his sire.
Io.
Is there for him no refuge from this doom ?
PROMETHEUS.
No, none;
unless I be from bonds released.
Io.
Who shall release thee 'gainst the will of Zens ?
790One of thy progeny, 'tis so ordained.
Io.
How so ?
shall child of mine free thee from balo ?
Count ten descents, and after them a third.
Io.
Not easy is this oracle to spell.
’So neither seek thy proper grief to learn.
Io.
Nay, hold not forth a boon and straight withdraw it.
Of two narrations I will grant thee one.
Io.
Set forth the twain, the choice then leave to me.
Granted:
Shall I the remnant of thy woes Plainly declare, or who shall set me free?
800Of these to her the former grace vouchsafe
To me the latter ;
spurn not my request.
To her the sequel of her course disclose, To me thy rescuer;
for this I crave.
Since ye are eager I will thwart you not, Nor will withhold what ye desire to know.
First,
Io, thy vex'd course to thee I'll tell, Which in thy mind's recording tablets grave.
When thou hast crossed the flood, limit betwixt
Two continents, fronting the burning East * 810 Trod by the sun, [then onward hold thy course.
Fierce northern blasts thou wilt encounter first;
Shun thou their downward rush, lest, unaware, In wintry tempest thou bo rudely caught.]
The roaring sea-wave skirt thou then until Kisthene's* Gorgoneian plains thou reach, Where dwell the Phorkides,t maids grey with eld, Three, swan-shaped, of one common eye possessed, One common tooth, whom neither with his beams
The sun beholdeth, nor the nightly moon;
And near them dwell their winged sisters three, Gorgons, with snaky locks, of men abhorred;
Whom mortal may not look upon and live.
This for thy warning I relate to thee;
820 List now another spectacle of dread.
The unbarking hounds of Zeus, sharp-mouthed, beware,— The Griffins;
and the Arimaspian ‡ host, Horse-mounted, single-eyed, around the stream Who dwell of Pluto's gold-abounding flood.*
To these approach not;
a far border-land Thou next shalt reach, where dwells a swarthy race, Near the sun's founts, whence is the Æthiop river.;
Along its banks proceed till thou attain
The mighty rapids, where from Bybliue heights 830 Pure draughts of sacred water Neilos sends.
He to the land, three-cornered, thee shall guide, Encircled by the Nile, where 'tis ordained, Io, for thee and for thy sons to found A far-off colony ;
Io, if aught of this Seem dark to thee, or difficult to spell, Repeat thy questions and be taught in full;
For leisure have I, more than I desire.
If aught untold of her sore-wasting course Remains by thee to be unfolded, speak.
But if thou hast told all, to us vouchsafe 840 The boon we craved ;
its scope full well thou knowest.
She of her roaming bath the limit heard, That she not vainly to have heard may know, Her woes ere coming here I will relate, Sure pledge thus giving that my talc is true.
Tedious array of words I shall omit,
And of thy roamings reach at once the goal;
For when Molossia's plains thy foot had trod, Round lofty-ridged Dodona, where is found
The scat prophetic of Thesprotian Zeus, 850 And, portent past belief, the speaking oaks, By which thou clearly, in no riddling phrase, Wert hailed as tho illustrious spouse of Zeus, Fate-destined,—if this flatter thee at all,— Thence, fiercely stung, along tho sen-washed tract, To Rhea's mighty gulf didst hurry,—whence In courses retrograde wert rudely tossed.
And through all future timo know certainly
That sea-gulf shall the name Ionian bear, To all mankind memorial of thy way ;
SGO
These then to theo bo tokens of my mind, That moro discerueth than doth meet tho sense.
The rest for you and her I will relate.
The track regaining of my former words.
On the land's verge a town, Canobos, stands, At Neilos' very mouth and sand-bar,-there, Zeus shall restore thy reason,—stroking thee With touch alone of unalarming hand;
Then thou dark Epaphos shalt bear, whose name 870 Records his sacred gendering, who shall reap All regions watered by broad-flowing Nile.
Fifth in descent from him a female race, Fifty in number, shall return to Argos, Not willingly, but wedlock to avoid Of cousins ;
these, with passion-winged hearts, Falcons that follow close on doves, shall come Chasing unlawful wedlock, but the god Shall grudge them such fair prey ;
Pelasgian soil Shall harbour them, what time, made bold by night, Woman's fell prowess shall o'er men prevail;
880 For every bride her spouse shall reave of life, The two-edged weapon bathing in his neek.—
May Kypris visit in such guise my foes!-
But of the maids shall one, by love beguiled, Her partner fail to slay;
-her will's keen edge Blunted, she will of evils twain prefer Repute of weakness to bloodguiltness.
She shall a kingly race in Argos bear;
This to set forth at large needs lengthy speech ;
But from this seed shall dauntless hero spring, 890 Bow-famous, who shall free me from these toils.
Such oracle my mother, born of eld, Themis, hoar Titaness, to me rehearsed.
But how and where, to tell, needs lengthy speech, Nor would the knowledge aught advantage thee.
Io.
Ah mo !
ah woe is me !
Brain-smiting madness once again Inflames me, and convulsive pain.
The gad-fly's barb, not wrought with fire, Stings me ;
against my breast Kicks my pent heart with fear oppressed.
900 Mine eyeballs roll in dizzy gyre ;
Out of my course by frenzy's blast I'm borne.
My tongue brooks not the rein, And turbid words, at random cast, 'Gainst waves of hateful madness beat in vain.
Sago was the man, ay, sage in sooth, Who in his thought first weighed this truth, And then in pithy phrase express'd :
— "
That wedlock in one's own degree is best."
That not where wealth saps manly worth.
910 Nor where pride boasts its lofty birth.
Should son of toil repair in marriage quest.
Never, oh never, Fates, may ye, Dread powers primeval, gaze on me Sharing his couch who reigns above, Or joined with son of heaven in ties of love I For filled with dread am I to see Io's love-shunning virgin-state, Consumed in wanderings dire through Hera's hate.
Wedlock, when equal-yoked, to me 920 Nought dreadful seemeth, terror-free.
But ne'er may mighty god, with eye of love, Escape forbidding, mark me from above.
A battle to be fought by none, Fruitful of fruitless woe, were this ;
Nor can I see the end ;
-for well I wis, The deep designs of Zeus I may not shun.
Yea verily shall Zeus, though stubborn-souled, Be humbled yet;
such marriage he prepares
Which from his throne of power to nothingness 930 Shall hurl him down;
so shall be all fulfilled His father Kronos' curse, which erst he spake
What time he fell from his primeval throne.
From such disasters none of all the gods To Zeus escape can show, save I alone;
I know it and the way.
Let him then sit Fearless, confiding in supernal thunder, The bolt, fire-breathing, wielding in his hands;
For these shall not avail, but fall he shall, A fall disgraceful, not to bo endured.
940 Such wrestler now, himself against himself, He arms for battle ;
-portent hard to quell;
Who flame shall find surpassing lightning's glare, And crash more mighty than the thunder-roll;
Who the sea-trident, earth-convulsing plague, Poseidon's sceptre, shall to pieces rend;
Against this evil stumbling, Zeus shall learn How wide apart are sway and servitude.
Such talk 'gainst Zeus thy wish, I trow, inspires.
Both what shall be, I speak, and what I wish.
950And must we look for one o'er Zeus to reign ?
Yea, pangs than these more crushing shall he bear.
How canst thou fail to fear, hurling such words ?
What should I fear who am not doomed to dio ?
To keener struggle he may sentenco theo.
So let him then I all is by me foreseen.
The wise are they who worship Nemesis.
Revere, adore, cringe aye to him who reigns, For me, at less than nought I value Zeus.
For this brief hour let him both do and reign, 960 E'en as he will ;
-not long he'll rule the gorls.
But yonder I behold the scout of Zeus, Of this new potentate the servitor;
— Doubtless some news to herald he has come.
To thee, professing wisdom, steeped in gall, Who 'gainst the gods hast sinned, on short-lived men Prerogatives bestowing, thief of fire, To thee I speak;
the Father bids thee tell What nuptials these thou vauntest of, by which Himself shall fall from sway;
and nought in riddles, 970 But point by point explain;
nor cause to me, Prometheus, double journeys ;
* for thou seest, Not by such dealing is Zeus mollified.
Full of high spirit and augustly mouthed
This speech, as fits an underling of gods.
Younglings and young of sway, ye think to dwell Henceforth in griefless citadels.
From these Have I not known two potentates cast down?
Ay, and a third, now reigning, I shall see In basest and most sudden overthrow.
980 Seem I to thee before these upstart gods
To quail or cringe ?
Far from it, nay, no whit.
But get thee back with speed the way thou earnest, For of thy quest thou'lt nothing learn from me.
E'en by such haughty wilfulness before Didst thou to these dirge moorings waft thyself.
This my ill-fortune, be thou well assured, I would not barter with thy servitude.
This rock to lackey better 'tis in sooth
Than trusty scout be born to father Zeus.
990
Thus, as is fitting, scorn replies to scorn.
Thou seem'st to revel in thy present state.
Revel ?
Oh might I in such revel see My foes!
And thee among them do I count.
Me too thou holdest guilty of thy ills ?
Shortly to speak, all gods I hate, whoo'er, By me bestead, maltreat mo wrongfully.
By what I hear, not slight thy madness is.
Mad let me be, if to hate foes be madness.
Unbearable wert thou if prosperous.
1000Alas!
That word, I trow, Zeus knoweth not.
Time as it waxeth old can all things teach.
But thou not yet hast sober wisdom learned.
Else I with thee, a menial, had not talked.
It seems thou'lt answer nought the sire demands.
Grace since I owe him, grace must I repay.
Thou floutest me as though a child I were!
Art not a child, ay, simpler than a child, If thou cxpectest aught to learn from me ?
No torture is there, no device whereby 1010 Zeus shall persuade me to reveal these things
Before these woe-inflicting bonds be loosed.
Let then his blazing lightnings hurtle down;
With white-winged snow and earth-born thunderings
Let him in ruin whelm and mingle all;
For none of these shall bend my will to tell
By whom from empery he needs must fall.
Mark now if helpful this may seem to thee.
Of old my course was looked to and resolved.
Take heart, 0 foolish one, take heart at length 1020 To deal discreetly with these present ills.
Idly, as though a wave thou should'st exhort, Thou troublest me.
Harbour no more the thought
That I, iu terror at the will of Zeus, Effeminate of mind shall e'er become, And supplicate whom hugely I abhor, With woman-aping palms to heaven upturned, To loose mo from the so fetters.
Not a whit.
Much may I speak, it seems, and speak in vain;
For nothing moved or softened is thy heart
By prayers;
but thou, like newly yoked colt, 1030 Champing the bit, dost fight against the rein Fiercely;
yet futile the device wherein Madly thou trustest;
for mere stubbornness Avails the foolish-hearted less than nought.
But mark, if unpersuaded by my words,
What storm and triple crested surge of ills
Shall o'er thee burst escapeless.
Yea :
for first.
With thunder and with lightning-flame, the Sire This rugged crag shall rend, and hide thy frame Deep in the rock's embraces rudely clasped.
1010 But when time's lengthened course thou hast fulfilled, Back shalt thou come to daylight.
Then, in sooth.
Zeus' winged hound, the eagle red with gore, Shall of thy flesh a huge flap rudely tear ;
Coming, unbidden guest, the live-long day He on thy black-gnawed liver still shall feast.
But of such pangs look for no term, until, Some god, successor of thy toils, appear, Willing to Hades' rayless gloom to wend, And to the murky depths of Tartaros. ] 050
Wherefore take counsel -since not feigned in sooth
Is this bold threat, but all too truly spoken.
Trust me, the mouth of Zeus knows not to lie, But every word completeth.
So do thou Look round, take heed, nor deem that stubbornness Shall ever better than good counsel prove.
Timely to us the word of Hermes seems, For he exhorts thee, dropping thy self-will, To search for prudent counsel.
Be advised!
For to the wise it bringeth shame to err.
lOGOTo mo who knew them, bath he told
His messages, with utterance shrill.
But nowise I unseemly hold
That foe from foe should suffer ill.
So 'gainst mo now be hurled amain Curled lightning's two-edged glare !
By thunder and spasmodic whirl
Of savage gales be upper air Madly convulsed!
Let hurricane Earth from its deep foundation rend, E'en from its roots.
Let ocean's wave, Surging aloft, tumultuous rave, And, foaming, with the courses blend 1070 Of heavenly stars !
Ay, let him hurl
This body to tho murky gloom Of Tartaros, in stubborn whirl Of fortune caught!
Do what ho will
My death ho may not doom.
From fools brain-stricken may one hear Such counsels and such words.
But say,- What sign of madness lacketh hero ?
What respite knows his frenzied iro ?
Nathless do yo, who thus condole 1080 With his soro pangs, far henco retire ;
Go quickly, lest harsh thunder's bray With terror smite your soul.
In other style exhort and preach
If to persuade me thou art fain;
For all unbearable this speech
Which from thy lips hath burst amain.
How canst thou bid me consummate A dastard's part ?
With him the worst I'll brave, for I have learn'd to hate 1090 Traitors, than whom no pest is more accursed.
Then my forewarnings mark, nor dare
When tangled in fell ruin's snare Fortune to blame, nor ever say That Zeus hath plunged you unaware
In doleful plight ;
—nay, truly nay, But ye yourselves;
for not untaught, Not stealthily, by sudden blow, Ye through sheer folly will be caught
In net of boundless woe.
1100And lo in act, in word no more, Earth totters ;
-from below Loud bellows the discordant roar
Of thunder;
lightning's wreathed glow Blazes around me;
dust elate Rides on the whirlwind ;
forward leap
Of every wind rude blasts that sweep
In strife of rancour-breathing hato.
The sky is mingled with the deep.
Such turmoil to arouse my fear Comes visibly from Zeus.
Oh thou, 1110 Mother revered!
Oh upper air, Who sheddest from thy circling sphere
The common light!
Behold ye now What pangs unjust I bear.869.
τω̑ν Διὸς γεννημάτων.
Every one feels that the poet cannot have written thus.
I suggest τω̑νδ'
ὁσιογεννημἀτων, as close to the letters of the text.
914.
A word is lost.

CHORUS, THE DAUGHTERS OF DANAOS.
HERALD.[SCENE.
—The sea-shore :
on one side the sea, on the other the gates of Argos.
The Thymele is adorned tcith statues of APOLLO, ARTEMIS, HERMES, and ether divinities.
Enter from the shore the fifty daughters of Danaos, accompanied by their father — they are arrayed in Egyptian costume, and bear in their hands the suppliant bough, wreathed tcith wool.
They form the Chorus, and as they advance twelve of their number chant the following ode.
]
INTRODUCTION.THE trilogy to which this drama belonged, like that of which " The Seven against Thebes" formed the con­ cluding member, was founded upon an ancient epic, by an unknown author.
Of this poem little is known, except that it contained five thousand five hundred verses, and bore the title of " The Danaides.
"The story which it embodied appealed powerfully to that passion for legendary genealogies which formed such a striking feature of the Grecian character.
Alleged descent from a common ancestor was the bond of union between the members of every Grecian com­ munity, great or small;
and as this legendary personage was usually of divine or semi-divine origin, even the humblest citizen thus felt himself brought into more or less direct filiation with the gods.
The divine element thus, according to the popular conception, incarnated in humanity, culminated in the great national hero, Herakles, " the most renowned and ubiquitous of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the Hellenes "-the only mortal who, from a life of toil and suffering on earth, was admitted to the god­ head, and received into the society of Olympos.
His descendants, moreover, the Herakleids, associated with the Dorians in the conquest of the Peloponnesus, were glorified in the popular imagination as the founders of the great Dorian cities of Argos, Sparta, and Messenia, and as the introducers in those localities of a new social order.
Peculiar interest thus attaches to Io, the progenitrix of Herakles, and to the birth of her off­ spring, Epaphos, an event celebrated in such glowing strains by the chorus of Suppliants (v. 580).
*In thus veiling the grosser features of the Io legend, as popularly conceived, while, at the same time, investing it with a more spiritual meaning, Æsehylus appears not only as the great creative poet, but also as tho true prophet of his generation.
The numerous legends of which the story of Io may be regarded as a typical example embodied, in a vulgar form, tho idea that it was only through association with the divino principle that man could rise to his true ideal as man.
Tho poet seizes upon this idea, separates it from the grosser elements of the popular symbol, and extols the benignity of Zeus in thus seeking fellowship with mortals—giving prominence to the idea that through this agency alone the human race was raised to a higher level, physical and moral, than it could otherwise havo attained.
Tho introductory character of " Tho Suppliants" has been inferred from tho extreme simplicity of the plot, and from other considerations;
accordingly, it is now generally regarded as forming the first member of a trilogy of which the succeeding dramas were " The Egyptians," and " The Danaides," both of which have been lost.
Though deficient in dramatic interest, this piece is characterized by the remarkable beauty of the choral odes, which, from their sublime simplicity, and from the high conception which they embody of Zeus, as the supreme and omnipotent ruler, remind us occa­ sionally of the Hebrew psalms.
It must be remembered, moreover, that, at the time of Æschylus, the national legends had not yet lost their hold upon the popular belief, and accordingly mythical events, such as the arrival of the Danaides in Argos, were considered not only as having influenced the subsequent destinies of Greece, but also as having been brought about by the inscrutable counsels of Zeus;
the unfolding of whose designs, through the medium of tragedy, was regarded as the highest function of the poet.
The ancient legend tells of the strife between the sons of Belos ;
how Danaos was driven from his home by Ægyptos, who usurped his throne;
how the latter sought to force the Danaides to marry his sons, and how Athena herself exhorted Danaos to flee with his daughters to the land of Io.
The introductory drama opens with their arrival, in the character of suppliants, at Argos, and is founded upon the protection accorded to them by the Argives and their king, Pelasgos:
the appearance of the Egyptian herald, at the conclusion of the play, toge­ ther with his forcible attempt to carry off the suppliants, prepares the spectator for the arrival of the Egyptian pursuers in the succeeding drama.
Attention has been called to the picturesque beauty of the opening scene, where, holding in their bands their wool-wreathed myrtle boughs, and arrayed in white apparel, which formed a striking contrast to their swarthy limbs, the suppliants grouped themselves under the statues of the gods :
they would, moreover, be regarded with peculiar interest as wanderers from tho valley of the Nile, " the wondrous river fed with snow," upon whose fountains no human eye had been permitted to gaze.
Of " The Egyptians," unfortunately, no fragments remain;
it doubtless embodied the main incident in the tragic story of the Danaides.
It is related in the legend that Danaos was elected king by the Argivcs, in place of Pelasgos;
being unable to cope with Ægyptos and his sons, who still press their suit, ho is compelled to yield to their demand, and promises to give his daughters in marriage to their detested suitors.
In secret, however, he furnishes each with a dagger, enjoining her, at the same time, to slay her lord during the nuptial night.
The terrible deed was executed.
Hypermnestra alone, soothed by love, and preferring tho reputation of cowardice to that of blood-guiltiness (Pro. 887), spared Lyneeus, tho partner of her couch.
Here one duty could not be observed without violating another, and thus was brought about that collision between two primary principles of human nature, the reconciliation of which constitutes the essence of the Æschylean drama.
The remark of Grote with reference to this feature of Grecian tragedy will be perused with interest:
" The tragedian," he says, " not only appeals more powerfully to the ethical sentiments than poetry had ever done before, but also, by raising these grave and touching questions, addresses a stimulus and chal­ lenge to the intellect, spurring it on to ethical specu­ lation.
"From the Hellenic point of view, Hypermnestra was regarded as a criminal, while the bloody deed of her sisters was extolled as an act of heroism, enjoined not only by their father, but by the gods themselves.
The suitors, moreover, are represented from the first as in the highest degree insolent and overbearing:
barbarians, they had dared to invade the sacred soil of Hellas, and the vengeance which had overtaken them would ally itself in the popular imagination with the destruction of the Oriental hosts which had so recently crowned the grand contemporary conflict between Persia and Hellas.
This feeling would be heightened by the war between Egypt and Athens, which began B.C. 462.
The trial of Hypermnestra most probably formed the principal subject of " The Danaides," the concluding member of the trilogy.
From a fragment of the pro­ logue which has been preserved, we learn that the drama opened with the hymn with which it was cus­ tomary to awaken the newly-married pair :
"
Since now arises the bright lamp of day,
The bridegrooms I awake with friendly lay, Chanted by choral bands of youths and maids.
"The horrors of the bridal night would thus be revealed, together with what was regarded as the treacherous clemency of Hypermnestra.
According to the ancient story, she was cast by her father into prison, and subsequently brought to trial before a court with the constitution of which we are not acquainted.
The goddess Aphrodite herself appears to plead her cause, reminding us of the trial of Orestes before the court of Areopagus, when Pallas Athena, as president, gave her casting vote in his favour.
One fragment from the address of Aphrodite has been preserved:
" Longs the pure sky to blend with Earth, and Love Doth Earth impel to yield to his embrace;
The rain-shower, falling from the slumberous heaven, Kisses the Earth;
and Earth brings forth for mortals Pasture for sheep-flocks and Demeter's grain.
The woods in spring their dewy nuptials hold;
And of all these I am in part the cause.
"
Hypermnestra was acquitted, and from her union with Lynceus sprang in course of time the demigod Herakles.
The remaining daughters of Danaos were purified from the stain of blood by Athena aud Hermes, or, according to another form of the legend, by Zeus himself.
M AY Zeus, by Suppliants revered, Propitious view our naval train, From Nile's fine-sanded mouths who steered Across the billowy main.
The heavenly region left behind Whose fields with Syria's fields unite, Guiltless we roam, not blood-defiled And by the state's decree exiled, But wedlock with abhorrent mind Shunning ;
for by Ægyptos' brood, Kin of our blood, to marriage woo'd, We flee the unhallowed rite.
10 Danaos, our father and our guide,* Prime councillor of wisdom tried, Casting for these affairs the die, Of ills the noblest chose, to fly, Free from constraint, the sea-wave o'er, And anchor drop on Argos' shore, Whence, boasting its descent, our line, From her, the heifer hornet-stung, Through breathing and through touch divine Of Zeus, hath whilom sprung.
Wherefore, on what more friendly land
Than this, a refuge could we find, 20 These sacred branches, wool-entwined, Bearing with suppliant hand ? 0 city!
Earth!
0 waters clear I Supernal gods, and powers severe Guarding the tombs who hold your reign, And Zeus, third saviour, (guardian thou Of righteous men,) our suppliant train Tender of sex, receive ye now, With kindly reverence native here.
But for Ægyptos' haughty brood, SO Swarm of rude males, or e'er they gain Firm footing on this marshy coast, Their swift-oared galley and their host Sweep seaward ;
there by hurricane, By thunder, lightning, and by rain Tempestuous driving,—ere, as prize, They seize this kindred sisterhood, And our unwilling beds profane.
Trampling time-honoured sanctities,— O'erwhelm them in the savage flood.
Him I invoke, beyond the sea 40 Our champion, progeny divine *
Of her who browsed the flowery lea, Ancestral mother of our line Through breath and touch of Zeus.
For time, When to full plenitude it came, Brought Epaphos to light, whose name Showed forth the touch sublime.
His name rehearsing, where of old His mother trod the grassy wold,- 60 Recalling now her ancient toil, I to the holders of this soil Sure tokens of my birth will show ;
Ay, of my words shall proofs appear In season clue, unlooked-for, clear, That all their truth may know.
And should there chance to linger near Some native augur, on his ear When falls our plaintive wail;
Will he not deem the anguished note Of Tereus' bride * around doth float, The hawk-chased nightingale?
GODriven from her streams and woodlands green, Lamenting the familiar scene, She pours a strange wild strain.
Her child she mourns in tuneful breath, By her own hand consigned to death, Through rage maternal slain.
Thus in Ionian strain, Of plaint enamoured, I complain, The while my soft, Nile-mellowed cheek I rend, And heart aflood with tears.
Blossoms I cull of grief, while fears Possess me, lest our suppliant Land, 70 Escaped from that mist-shrouded laud, Find here no guardian friend.
But natal gods, whose eye Justice regardeth, hear our cry, Nor, beyond right, let youth its goal attain ;
Abhorring haughty wrong, Let sacred law o'er wedlock reign.
From bale, in war who worsted fly
The altar shieldeth,—bulwark strong,- Dread awo of gods on high.
Though Zeus plau all things right,.
so Yet is his heart's desire full hard to trace;
Nathless in every place Brightly it gleameth, e'en in darkest night, Fraught with black fate to man's speech-gifted race.
Stedfast, ne'er thrown in fight,.
The deed in brow of Zeus to ripeness brought;
For wrapt in shadowy night, Tangled, unscanned by mortal sight, Extend the pathways of his secret thought.
From towering hopes mortals he hurleth prone 90 To utter doom;
but for their fall
No force arrayeth he ;
for all
That gods devise is without effort wrought.
Seated aloft upon his holy throne, He from afar works out his secret thought.
But let him mortal insolence behold;
-
How with proud contumacy rife, Wantons the stem in lusty life 100 My marriage craving ;
—phrenzy over-bold, Spur ever-pricking, goads them on to fate, By ruin taught their folly all too late.
Thus I complain, in piteous strain, Grief-laden, tear-evoking, shrill;
Ah woo is me !
woe!
woe!
Dirge-like it sounds:
mine own death-trill I pour, yet breathing vital air.
Hear, hill-crowned Apia, hear my prayer!
Full well, 0 land, 110 My voice barbaric thou canst understand;
While oft with rendings I assail My byssine vesture and Sidonian veil.
My nuptial rite in heaven's pure sight Pollution were, death-laden, rude ;
Ah woe is me !
woe !
woe!
Alas for sorrow's murky brood!
Where will this billow hurl me ?
Where ?
Hear, hill-crowned Apia, bear my prayer;
120 Full well, 0 land, My voice barbaric thou eanst understand, While oft with rendings I assail My byssino vesture and Sidonian veil.
The oar indeed and home with sails Flax-tissued, swelled with favouring gales, Staunch to the wave, from spear-storm frco, Ilavo to this shore escorted me, Nor so far blame I destiny.
But may the all-seeing Father send 130 In fitting time propitious end ;
So our dread Mother's mighty brood, The lordly couch may 'scape, ah me, Unwedded, unsubdued!
Meeting my will with will divine, Daughter of Zeus who here dost hold Stedfast thy sacred shrine,- Me, Artemis unstained, behold.
Do thou, who sovereign might dost wield, Virgin thyself, a virgin shield;
140 So our dread Mother's mighty brood, The lordly couch may 'scape, ah me, Unwedded, unsubdued!
But if she hide her face
Our swart, sun-smitten race, Bearing our wool-wreathed boughs, to Zeus will go, Lord of the dead below, Hailer of many a guest.
To him our suppliant train Will wend, by nooses slain, 150 If gods Olympian heed not our request.
Oh Zens, for Io's sake, The wrath of heav'n, alas, doth us o'ertake;
The vengeful ire I recognize
Of thy dread consort who subdues the skies.
For still the tempest raves amain After the hurricane.
Then how may Zeus be free From righteous obloquy, The offspring slighting, scion of his race, 160 Whom erst the heifer bare, If now he hide his face From us who seek his grace ?
Nay, but on high may he attend our prayer!
Oh Zeus, for Io's sake
The wrath of heaven, alas, doth us o'ertako;
The vengeful iro I recognize
Of thy dread consort who subdues the skies.
For still the tempest raves amain 170 After the hurricane.
Needful is prudence, children.
—Ye have como With prudent sire, this trusty pilot old, And taking forethought also hero ashore I charge you guard my words, well table ted.—
Dust, voiceless herald of a host, I see;
— The wheel-naves keep not silence, axle-driven;
—
And now a shielded band with brandished spears, With steeds and curvèd chariots, I descry.—
Perchance tho rulers of this land, apprized 180 By messengers, to eye us hither come.
But whether harmless, or, with ruthless ire Whetted, some leader urges on the host,- Whate'er betide, damsels, 'tis best to take Seats on the mound of these Agonian gods.
Stronger than tower an altar is ;
a shield Inviolate;
hence with all speed advance, And holding in left hand, with reverent grasp, Your suppliant boughs, white wreathed, ensigns of Zeus, The god of mercy, with respectful words, 190 Urgent and sad, befitting aliens here, Answer these strangers, setting plainly forth That this your flight by blood is undefiled.
Let naught unseemly wait upon your voice;
And from your sober brow and quiet eye Let no vain glance proceed ;
in your discourse
Nor voluble, nor over-tedious be;
Jealous of such this race.
Be prompt to yield, For foreign art thou, fugitive and poor;
Boldness of speech beseemeth not the weak.
Well thou advisest, sire, the well-advised.
200 I thy wise bests will in remembrance guard;
And may ancestral Zeus our cause behold IMay he behold it with propitious eye!
Beside thee now my seat I fain would take.
Then dally not;
be your design achieved.[The Chorus place themselves near DANAOS.]
If He be gracious, all may yet be welL*** *Now do ye invocate this bird of Zeus.*Lo !
we invoke the Sun's sustaining beams.
Apollo too, pure god, exilo from heaven.
210Knowing this lot, he can for mortals feel.
So may lie now, and stand our prompt ally.
Whom next of all these gods shall I invoke ?
This trident see I, ensign of the god.
Well hath he sped us, well may he receive!
Here Hermes also after Hellas' rites.
May he good tidings herald to the free IOf all these gods the common shrine revere, And in these holy precincts take your seats, Like flock of doves scared by like-feathered hawks, 220 Our kin, yet foes, polluters of the race.
Can bird, devouring bird, be undefiled ?
Who takes in marriage an unwilling bride, From sire unwilling, how can he be pure ?
Not e'en in realm of Hades, after death, Shall one so reckless fail to be arraigned.
For there, among the shades, another Zeus, 'Tis said, offence by final verdict dooms.
Look out, and on this place your station take, So happy issue your emprize shall crown.[Enter KING, followed by attendants.
]
As from what soil this troop may we salute, 230 Band un-Hellenic, in barbaric robes And folds luxuriant ?
This female gear Nor Argos knows, nor any tract of Hellas.
How without heralds, without public hosts, E'en destitute of guides, ye to this land Fearless have dared to come, is marvellous!
Branches, indeed, as is the suppliant's wont, Lie near you, hard by these Agonian gods;
By this alone may Hellas form surmise;
And many other things to guess were just, 24.0 Were none at hand by living voice to tell.
Touching my garb not falsely hast thou spoken;
But whom do I address ?
A citizen,
Or temple-guard, or leader of the state?
In that regard speak thou and answer mako Fearless;
earth-born Palaechthon's son am I, Of this Pclasgic country potentate.
And they this soil who reap, from mo, their lord, Race of Pelasgi rightfully arc named.
For all the land through which clear Strymon flows, 250 Towards tho setting sun, my sway doth own.
My realm the lands of the Perrhæbi gird, Those beyond Pinitus to Paeonia near, And high Dodoua ;
ocean's watery bourno Cats it sheer off;
within these bounds I rule.
This plain itself, this Apian land, of old In wise physician's honour gained its name.
For Apis, prophet-leech, Apollo's son, Arriving from Naupactos, o'er the sea, This land from man-destroying monsters purged, 260 Whom earth, by stains of ancient blood defiled, Sent up in anger, dragon-progeny, Co-dwellers fierce.
Apis, as leech and seer, Blameless, for Argive land these ills bath cured, And for reward hath mention in our prayers.
Having from me these tokens, in return Show forth your lineage, and further speak.
Yet long discourse this city brooketh not.
Brief be my tale and clear.
Of Argive race,- 270 Seed of the heifer in her offspring blest, We boast ourselves.
All this will I confirm.
Incredible, 0 strangers, sounds your tale, That this your race from Argos is derived;
For Libya's daughters ye resemble most, In no wise like to women native here;
Such progeny might Neilos rear perchance;
Such too the Cyprian character impressed
In female moulds by male artificers.
Of nomad Indian women too I hear, 280 Who, pannier-borne, on steed-like camels ride, Dwellers in land hard by the Æthiops' homo.
Haply, if armed with bows, I you had deemed Unlorded flesh-devouring Amazons.
Instructed, I shall better understand
How ye descent and race from Argos claim.
They say that To, in this Argive land, Of Hera's temple bare of yore the keys.
True, certes;
—widely the report prevails.—
Runs not the tale that Zeus a mortal loved ?
290Ay, and with dalliance not from Hera veiled.
How ended then these royal jealousies ?
The goddess to a heifer changed the maid.
Zeus surely ne'er would touch a fair-horned heifer.
In fashion of a bull they say he camo.
What further wrought the mighty spouso of Zeus ?
She o'er the heifer placed th' all-seeing guard.
What heifer-guard all-seeing meanest thou ?
Argos, the son of earth, whom Hermes slew.
300What else devised she 'gainst the ill-starred heifer?
The herd-tormenting brize, relentless pest.-
Oestros those call it who near Neilos dwell
That from the land drave her in lengthened course ?
This too then speakest consonant with me.
And to Canôbos came she and to Memphis ?
There Zeus, with soothing hand, a race did plant.
Who boasts himself the heifer's seed divine ?
He by the liberating touch of Zeus Distinguished rightfully as Epaphos.
[What offspring then had Zeus-born Epaphos?*]310Libya, with name adorned of mightiest land.
What other scion of this stock dost name ?
Sire of two sons, Belos, ray father's father.[Pointing to DANAOS.
]
Tell me, I pray, his name with wisdom fraught!
Danaos, whose brother boasteth fifty sons.
Of him too grudge not to declare the namo.
Ægyptos.—Knowing now mine ancient race 'Tis thino an Argive train from dust to raise.
To me some ancient tie ye seem to hold With this our soil.
But your parental homo 320 How havo yc dared to leave ?
What chanco befel ?
Pelasgic king, chequered aro human ills;
Sorrows like-feathered never wilt thou see.
For who might guess that, in unhoped-for flight, Thine ancient kindred should to Argos drift, Cowering through horror of the nuptial couch.
From these Agonian gods what your request, Holding these white-wreathed branches newly-culled ?
That to Ægyptos' sons I be not slave.
Speakest from hate or fearing tie unlawful ?
330One's kinsmen who would wish to buy as lords ?
*By such alliance waxeth strength to mortals.
Ay, and the wretched to desert is easy.
How then towards you pious may I prove ?
Us yield not, when Ægyptos' sons demand.
Grave the request new war to undertake.
But patron to her champion Justice stands.
True, if at first I had a party been.
Revere the city's stern thus garlanded.
*With awe these seats I mark shaded with boughs.
310Grievous the wrath of Zeus, the suppliant's god.
Son of Palacehthon, hear !
With heart benign hear me, Pelasgic king.
Me suppliant mark, exile lone-wandering ;
Like heifer, wolf-chased, that on rocky height I Loweth, confiding in assistance near, The herdsman warning of her dismal plight.
By boughs new-culled o'crshadow'd, I behold *This bright assembly of Agonian gods.
No mischief may this claim as town-guests breed ;
350 Nor from event unlocked for, unprepared, Be quarrel born ;
unwelcome to the state.
That mischief on our flight Wait not, may she, Goddess of Suppliants, grant, Themis, from Zeus, supreme Allotter, sprung!
Thou, elder-minded, learn from me more young;
-
The suppliant aiding, never shalt thou want, Nor will the gods the good man's offering slight.
Not atomy private hearth suppliant ye sit.
But if some common guilt the state pollute.
360 In common let the people work the cure.
No pledge I give, till, touching these events, Counsel I hold with all my citizens.
Thou art the state, the people, thou alone:
- Ruler accountable to none ;
With sovereign nod, the altar-stone, The hearth, thou swayest, of the land,— And from sole-sceptred throne, All issues canst command.
Oh then pollution shun.
Pollution rest upon mine enemies !
370 But you I cannot succour without bale.
-Nor gracious is it to despise these prayers.
Perplexed I am and fear my heart distracts, To act or not to act, and bide my chance.
The jealous watcher mark enthroned on high, Guardian of mortals travail-worn, Who to those near for aid apply, And find their lawful claims denied.
At suppliants' wail forlorn
The wrath of Zeus doth bide Implacable for aye.
380But if Ægyptos' sons have power o'er thee, As next of kin, pleading their city's laws, Who would desire such pleading to withstand ?
To native customs thou must make appeal, That legal rights against thee they have none.
Ne'er may I subject be to men's rude might;
Escape from baleful marriage-tie, Star-guided, I mark out in flight.
But Justice' self now taking for ally, Side with the holy gods and judge the right.
390Judgment not easy :
choose me not for judge.
Before I told you, I, though chief in sway, Cannot herein without my people act.-
Xe'er shall the throng aver, should ill befal,— " Strangers revering, thou the state hast wrecked.
"Allied to both, Zeus, with impartial ken, These things beholdeth;
evil men Fitly with bale doth he requite, The good with blessing :
wherefore fearest then, Since fair the balance, to uphold the right ?
400Deep salutary counsel need we here, An eye clear-sighted, not with wine surcharged, To plunge like diver to the lowest deep, That these events, first, harmless to the state May prove, and next bring vantage to ourselves.
So may not ye be booty of the strife, Nor we, by yielding you, near holy seats
Of gods established, bring, to haunt our land, The all-destroying Might, Avenger stern, Who e'en in Hades' realm frees not the dead.
410 Seems there not need of salutary thought ?
Ponder, and with just heed, To me in my sore need God-fearing patron be!
Surrender not One, by unrighteous meed, Who shares the exile's lot.
See me not borne away, Thou who the land dost sway With might all-potent, from these gods' blest shrine.
Men's insolence survey, 420 And dread the wrath divine.
Endure not to behold
Me from these statues, against right, impressed, Thy suppliant, like steed in forceful hold, Dragged by my tresses and embroidered vest.
Whatever thy decree, Know well, thy sons, ay, all thy house must pay Like reckoning, by war's stern arbitry.
430 These just commands from Zeus, firm-thoughted weigh.
Well have I weighed them.
Hither drives my bark.
Escape is none, but mighty war to wage Either with gods or men ;
* fixed is the hull, As if by naval capstans hauled ashore.
Which way I turn.
grief meets me everywhere.
For gear from plundered homesteads other gear, More than the loss, though mighty freight the spoil, By favour of Zeus Ktesios ‡ may accrue;
So when the tongue hath shot untimely forth 410 The stinging phrase, provoking direful wrath, The wound by word inflicted word may heal.
But to avert the stain of kindred blood, In sacrifice must many a victim bleed, To many gods, -for remedy of ill.
Sooth!
from this fray fain would I keep aloof, Unskilled in evils rather let me be Than wise I Beyond my hope may good prevail!
Of many solemn words hear now the goal.
I listen.
Speak.
Thy words shall 'scape me not.
450Girdles and zones have I my robes to clasp.
Such garniture beseems the woman's lot.
By means of these, know well, contrivance fair-Speak;
what this word which thou wilt utter forth ?
Unless some pledge thou givest to this train—
What will device of zones for thee effect ?
With tablets new these statues they shall grace
Thy words are riddles;
plainer be thy speech!
We from these gods forthwith ourselves will hang.
A word I hear piercing my very heart.
460Thou hast it now, for I thine eyes have purged.
Divers these troubles, hard to struggle with;
A host of ills bursts o'er mo like a flood;
Ruin's unfathomed sea, full hard to cross, This have I entered :
harbour there is none, For should I spurn your prayers, pollution dire
Thou namest, overtowering arrow's flight.
But if before the walls taking my stand, I try the issue with Ægyptos' sons, Thy kinsmen ;
— bitter is the cost to stain 470 With blood of men the soil, for women's sake.
Yet needs must I revere the wrath of Zeus, The suppliants' god ;
for, among mortal men -No awe more dread.
Do thou then, of these maids
Tho aged sire, these branches in thine arms Taking, on other shrines of native gods Lay them;
that all the citizens may see Tokens of this thy visit.
Touching me Let fall no random word;
for ever prone
The people are to blame authority.
These things beholding, some, to pity stirred, 480 The insolence may hate of this male troop.
So with the folk more favour shall ye find.
For to the weaker side all bear good will.
A precious boon is this for us, to win A patron so august, the reigning prince.-
But native escort and interpreters
Send thou with us ;
so may we surer find
The temple-fronting altars, and abodes, Friendly to guests,t of city-guarding gods, And may in safety pass amid thy town.
For we by nature are unlike in form ;
490
Not the same race rear Nile and Inachos ;
Beware, lest rashness slaughter breed ;
§ ere now, Hath friend, through ignorance, by friend been slain.
March with him guards, for well the stranger speaks.
Lead to the city altars, seats of gods ;
And changing watchwords, needless is much talk, While ye this seaman guide, suppliant of gods.
He hath thy best, thus tutored let him go;
But for myself,-how act ?
Where safety find ?
Leave here these branches, token of thy need.
500Thy hand and voice obeying, them I leave.
Now to this open grove betake thyself.
But how should grove unhallowed shelter mo ?
As prey to birds we will not give thee up.
What if to men more dire than dragon-brood ?
A kindly answer give to kindly words.
No marvel if I anxious am, through fear.
But fear to gentle blood unseemly is.
Cheer then by deeds, as by thy words, my heart.
Thee no long time thy sire forlorn will leave.
510 But I, the people of the land convening, Will in thy favour move the multitude, Aud how to frame his speech instruct thy sire.
Wait therefore and our native gods entreat, With orisons, thine heart's desire to grant.
But I to urge thy cause will now depart;
May suasion and effective fortune follow.
Hail, King of Kings!
Most Blest Among the blest!
Of powers on high Most perfect Power!
Our prayerful cry 520 Hear, blissful Zeus, and hate-possest, Of hateful men ward off the lawless pride ;
Ay, deep beneath the purple tide Whelm thou their dark-benched pest.
Viewing with eye benign
Our woman's cause, our ancient race, Her tale recall who shared thy grace, Ancestral mother of our line.
Soother of Io, mindful be once more Of her, through whom we from this shore 530 Our boasted lineage trace.
Back where my mother trod the wold, Her ancient haunts, flower-gendering meads, Pastures where yet the heifer foods, I now betake me,—whence of old, Brize-goaded, and distracted, speeds Through many a tribe of mortal men, Io;
-and while she holds in ken * The adverse shore, straight through the sea, A path she cleaveth, led by Destiny.
540Through Asia's land in wild career, Right o'er sheep-pasturing Phrygia's plain, Till Teuthras' Mysian towers appear, And Lydian vales,—she scours amain;
Cilicia's and Pamphylia's height Leaving behind, she speeds her flight O'er banks of ever-flowing streams, To the fair land with corn that teems, Region deep-soiled to Aphrodite dear.
Pierced by her winged herdsman's sting, 550 The lea she gains all fostering,­ That heavenly meadow fed from snow, O'crswept by Typhon's strength, And by the bale-averting flow Of Neilos' water ;
-there, at length, Frenzied she comes by toils unseemly spent, And goading pangs by jealous Hera sent.
And mortals who the land possessed, While pallid terror shook their breast, 560 Amazed a shape unwonted saw,— Half heifer and half maid, Mortal and brute, bi-formed.
With awe, The wondrous portent they surveyed.
Who then was he who gently soothed to rest Far-roaming Io, brize-stung, sore distrest ?
Zeus, lord of ceaseless ages, thine, Oh thine was that unharming might!
570 The breathing of thy love divine Arrests at length her toilsome flight, And gently, with the mournful tide Of modest tears, her woes subside.
Then, as Fame truly tells, receiving there Thy germ divine, her blameless child she bare,From age to age supremely blest.
Hence the whole earth proclaims, " this seed Life teeming, springs in very deed From Zeus, for who but he the pest 580 Could stay, devised by Hera's spite ? "
Thine, Zeus, the gracious work was thine!
Hence, whoso speaketh of our race divine From Epaphos as sprung, errs not from right.
Whom of the gods more fitly now May I invoke for deeds of grace ?
Father, Creator, King art thou, Whose forming hand begat our race;
Artificer supreme, ancient of days, Zeus, the all-wise, whose breath each purpose sways.
Nor seated upon lower throne Wieldeth he delegated sway ;
590 Nor cloth as his superior own Ruler whose word he must obey;
-
No, on his sovereign fiat waits the deed, To execute his mind's decp-ponder'd rede.
Take courage, with the natives all goes well.
Decrees all-perfect have the people passed.
Hail, siro rovered ;
herald to me most dear ;
But say what measure hath been ratified, Wherete tho people's hand out-numbering swayed?
Not by division did the Argives vote, But so as to make young mine aged heart.
600 For in full mote, with raised right-hands the air Bristled, while this decree they ratified, That we in Argivo land might settle, free, Not subject to arrest, inviolate ;
That no one, native here or foreigner, Should seize us;
—but, should violence be used, And any of these burghers fail to aid, An outlaw should he be, to exile doomed.
Thus in our favour spake Pelasgia's king, Persuasive, warning lest the mighty wrath 610 Of Zeus, the suppliant's god, in future time, The city should weigh down, and two-fold wrong, To us as strangers and as citizens, Upon the state two-fold pollution bring, Food of disaster irremediable.
Hearing such things the Argives, by their hands, Confirmed, ere herald summoned, these decrees.
The orator's persuasive winding speech Heard the Pelasgi, but Zeus wrought the end.
Come now for Argos' race Chant we the gracious prayer 620 Requiting kindly grace.
May Zeus, the stranger's friend, From strangers' lips regard with favour rare
Thu orisons, and crown with prosperous end.
Ye gods, heaven-born, if e'er before, Hear now the prayers that for this race we pour!
Never may this Pelasgie town, Fire-wasted, lift the joyless cry Of Ares, wanton deity, Who men in other harvest-fields mows down !
For that a gracious law
They passed, to mercy stirred;
630 And for this pity-moving herd, Thy supplicants, oh Zeus !
felt righteous awoNor, voting on the side of men, The women's cause did they disdainful slight;
But the dread watcher held in ken, Full hard to cope with, vengeful Might, Whom on its roofs what house could bear Wrathful ?
For heavily ho sitteth there.
Yea, sith their proper kin, Suppliants of Zeus severe, They venerate with pious fear ;
Hence with pure altars they heaven's grace shall win.
640Therefore, in tuneful rivalry, let vows Ascend from lips shaded by olive boughs.
May pestilence ne'er drain
Of manly strength this town ;
Nor discord's la vless reign With native corpses strow
This land's ensanguined plain !
Still may youth's gracious flower Unsickled blow;
Nor Aphrodite's spouse, man-slaying power, Relentless Ares, mow its blossom down 1 650May offerings blaze in every sacred fane,* By foreign elders throng'd, an honoured train, That well may fare the State!
Zeus let them hail, the Great,- The stranger's god, who fate By hoary law doth rein.
Fresh produce may the fields
For ever bear, And may dread Artemis, her bow who wields, View women's travail-pangs and kindly spare.
G60And let no man-destroying mischief lay
This town in ruins, arming for the fray, Ares, the source of tears, of ruthless mood, Danceless and lyreless.
May the brood
Of fell disease far from these burghers wing Its joyless flight, and the Lykeian king The nation's youth propitiously survey!
With every season's wealth may Zeus benign 670 Crown the rich earth, and mightily increase
Before the city walls the pasturing kine!
Ne'er may the gods' rich blessing cease!
May the well-omened song from every shrine Ascend, and from chaste lips the solemn strain, Joy-laden, lyre-enamoured, sound amain IStill may the people guard with constant zeal *
Their honours for the virtuous, while the sway 680 Of prudent councillors the city's weal Makes stodfast;
and, ere arming for the fray, May they, unscathed, just pacts with strangers seal!
And let them, to the gods this land who hold, With sacrifice and laurel bough draw near, Jealous to keep their fathers' rites of old.
For venerable Justice bath enroll'd
This her third statute:
—“ Parents aye revere.”
†These sober prayers, daughters beloved, I praise.
690 But though ye from your father tidings hear New and unlocked for, keep a stedfast heart.
For from this suppliant-guarding eminence
The barque I see;
well-marked it 'scapes me not;
-
The swelling sails, the bulwarks on each side, The prow in front, scanning its way with eyes, And, as to us unfriendly, all too well Hearing the guiding rudder at the stern.
Distinctly now the sailors may be seen,
Their swart limbs manifest in white attire.
700 Now ope to view the rest, the attendant ships;
— Meanwhile this one, the leader, with furled sails, Towards the shore is rowed, with equal stroke.
You it behoves, calmly, with stedfast mind, Viewing the danger, not to slight these gods.
With champions I'll return and advocates, Should haply herald come or embassy, Eager to seize you as the prize of war.
But thus it may not be;
fear not the event.
Yet were it best, should we be slow to aid, 710 In no wise to forget your shelter here.
Courage!
when strikes the appointed day and hour, Due fine that man shall pay who slights the gods.
Father, afraid I am, since swift of wing
The ships advance;
full soon will they be here.
My spirit fails me, scared by anxious fear, Lest that my lengthened flight no profit bring.
Father, I faint through dread.
Children, since ratified the Argives' vote, Take courage;
well I know, for you they'll fight.
720Insatiate of battle, fierce and lewd Ægyptos’ race ;
-to one who knows I speak.
In timbered ships, blue-prowed, their rage to wreak, Hither with many a follower, sable-hued, In prosperous wrath they sped.
Ay, but they hero a numerous host will find, With thews well hardened in the noon-tide heat.
Oh leave mo not alono, father, I pray;
Woman abandoned to herself is nought.
In her no war-god dwolls.
Crafty arc they 730 In mind and counsel;
dissolute in thought, Neither, liko crows, for altars care they aught.
Our interest, children, it would much avail
Were they to gods as hateful as to thee.
No awo of gods beforo whoso shrines wo stand, Or of these sacred tridents, 0 my sire, From us will hold their sacrilegious hand;
Too proud their hearts, mad with unhallowed fire, Reckless as dogs, they scorn the gods' command.
But wolves o'ermaster dogs, so runs the redo;
740 And fruit of byblos is no match for corn.
Since they the tempers have of brutes unclean
And wanton, of their power we must beware.
No speedy task the manage of a fleet, Nor yet to fix its moorings, nor ashore Safely to bring the stern-ropes ;
nor at once Are shepherds of swift galleys wont to trust
Their anchor-hold, the more when they approach A region harbourless, what time the sun Sinks into night;
for anxious travail-throes 750 In wary pilot night is wont to breed.
Trust me, the army will not disembark, Till in her moorings safe the galley rides;
Though fear-oppressed, beware, slight not the gods, Who succour brought;
nor shall the city blame Your herald, old, but young in eloquence.*0 hilly land, which all revere, What woe awaits us ?
where, oh where, In land of Apia, shall we flee, If refuge dark lurk anywhere ?
As sable smoke, an, might I be, That to the clouds of Zeus draws near, 760 Or, soaring without wings, ah me, Unseen, like viewless dust dissolve in air!
Seapeless is now the threatened doom;
Throbbeth my spirit steeped in gloom ;
Me bath thine out-look ruined, sire!
I faint with dread.
Let me expire,
By twistings of the girdle slain, Or e'er the man by me abhorred, This form approach with touch profane!
770 Rather, in death, let Hades be my lord!
Oh for a seat in upper air
Where the dank vapours turn to snow;
-
Or might some beetling crag forlorn, Smooth, steep, unfriendly, lonesome, bare, The vultures' haunt, my plunge below Witness, ere forceful I am torn, Heart-piereing wedlock's dreaded yoke to share.
That food of dogs I then should be, 780 Or gorge the prey-birds, native here, Appals me not;
for death is free From ills that sorrow's plaint endear.
Yea, that its doom may come, I pray, Ere I such nuptial couch ascend ;
—
Or other refuge is there, say, From nuptial-bonds or other saviour friend?
Lift to heaven the voice of wail, Hymns and supplications sing ;
- 790 Prayers that may perchance avail Rescue from the gods to wring.
View the conflict from the sides, Great Father!-
Violence behold With righteous and not friendly eyes;
In dear regard do thou thy suppliants hold,- Zeus, ruler of the earth, all-mighty king!
For Ægyptos’ haughty race, Male of sex, a lawless brood, Me, poor fugitive, still chase, And with noiseful clamour rude, Seek to capture.
But thy beam 800 O'er all is poised,—Thou king supreme;
For say, to mortal men apart from thee, Dread arbiter, what may accomplished be ?1st.
Woe, woe!
alas!
ah me!
Lo the sea-robber ncars the land.
2nd.
Wrecked be the pirate ere his hand
On me lays forceful hold.
3rd.
Loudly I raise the voice of wail.
4th. Preludes to insult I behold
That me will soon assail.
5th. Hasten, to shelter quickly flee, 810 6th.
Cruel of heart are they, I trow;
Unbearable by land and sea.
7th. Our patron, King!
be thou.
Haste to the barque, away, away !
Rendings, ay rendings of the hair, And cruel stripes I now must bear;
Lopping of heads will come amain, And murder's gory rain.
820Plague on you, to the barque away.
Would that where surging billows rave, Exulting in thy lordly pride,- Thou and thy nail-clenched barquo besido, Had perished neath the wave!
Like to a captured run-a-way, Theo to my stocks I soon will bind.-
Hence, I advise theo, put away
The foolish phrenzy of thy mind.
Ho there!
The altars quit, I say ;
830 Hence to the barque;
—I know no fear For what is held in reverence here.
Never again, oh never more May I the cattle-nurturing flood Behold, whence life-sustaining blood Through mortals doth more amply pour !
*Cling to the shrine with reverent hand, Yet to the ship ye must away;
840 Willing or not, ye must obey ;
— Off, off, ye wretches, to the strand, Lest, forcefully, against your will, Ye at my hands bear ruder ill.
Alas!
ah me !
0 may'st thou 'neath the'billowy wave Perish, with none to save, Driven from thy course with adverse blast, And on Sarpedon's sandy headland cast!
Alas!
ah me
For this pollution !
Words of dread
Thou speakest, mad with pride ;
May mighty Neilos, thee that bred, O'erwhelm thee, and thy ruthless phrenzy hide!
Off with you to the galley donble-prowed,- Such my command, full speed, let none delay ;
—
Who captives hale, hold not in awe their locks.
860From these altars, father dear, With the spider's stealthy tread
Or like vision, vision dread, Seaward now he draggeth mo Woe, alas, ah me!
Mother earth, 0 mother earth, Turn aside the voice of fear !
Zeus!
great king, thou son of earth IThese gods of Argos fear I not, for they Nor reared me up, nor nurtured me to eld, 870Near me now lie rageth, near, Biped serpent, void of ruth ;
Or like viper, whose full tooth Wounds the foot, lie holdeth me.
Woe, alas, ah mo !
Mother earth, 0 me ther earth, Turn aside the voice of fear!
Zeus !
great king, thou sun of earth !
Unless, my mandate heeding, each one hies 880 Ship ward, her tunic shall no mercy know.
Ho !
City-leaders, princes all, Your suppliant they now enthrall.
Force I must use and drag you by your locks, Since to my words ye lend no ready car.
We perish utterly, 0 king, Unlooked-for outrage suffering.
-Soon many kings, Ægyptos’ sons, thou'lt see Cheer up !
that rulers fail, ye shall not say.
Sirrah, what doest thou ?
Through what conceit
This land dost outrage of Pelasgic men ?
Or thinkest to a woman's town art come ?
890 Thou, a barbarian,—too insolent Thy dealing with Hellenes.
Having erred
In many things, nought judges!
thou aright,How in despite of justice have I erred ?
As stranger to behave, first, know'st thou not.
How so ?
when I, thus finding what was lost ....
What native patrons having first addressed ?
Hermes, chief patron, prime Inquisitor.
Addressing gods, these gods thou honourest not.
The deities of Neilos I revere.
Those hero are nought, as from thy lips I learn.
900[Pointing to the Suppliants.
These lead I hence if no ono snatch them from me.
Touch them, thou'It rue it, and right speedily.
Certes, no hospitable word I hear.
Who spoil the gods find mo inhospitable.
Go to Ægyptos’ sons and tell them this.
Such utterance my spirit brooketh not.
But that with knowledge I may speak more plainly, (For it beseems a herald to report Clearly each eireumstanee,) how, and by whom, Shall I, on my return, declare myself Robbed of this female train, as kindred claimed?
910 Ares such plea by voice of witnesses Decideth not;
neither by silver's worth Compoundeth quarrel;
but, ere comes the end, With bitter wrench from life falls many a hero.
Why tell to thee my name ?
Tutored by time, Know it thou shalt and those who sail with thee.
As for these maids, provided they consent With willing hearts,—if pious word prevail,- Them thou may'st take ;
but by the public voice, Unanimous, hath this decree been passed;
- Ne'er on compulsion to deliver up 920 A female train;
—firmly through this resolve
The nail is driven, so to abide unmoved.
Neither inscribed on tablets nor scaled up
In folds of books these matters are, but them Plainly thou hearest from free-spoken tongue.
Now, with all speed, betake thee from my sight.
'Tis then thy pleasure to incur new war:
—
May victory and strength be with the males IBut in this land male dwellers ye shall find, Drinking, I trow, no draughts of barley wine.
930 [To the Suppliants But maidens, taking heart, repair ye all, With friendly escort, to the well-fenced town, Shut in with deep device of many a tower.
The State owns many mansions, and myself A palace have, built with no grudging hand, If 'tis your choice full happily to dwell With many others ;
yet, if such your wish, Make ye in separate abodes your home.
Choose of these offers that which seemeth best, Most pleasing to your sisterhood ;
myself 940 Your patron am, and all these burghers here, For you their vote who pledged.
—Why wait yo then For others armed with more authority ?
In return for deeds of grace
May thy lot with grace be crowned, Hero of Pelasgic race !
But hither send, with purpose kind, Our sire, of brave and wary mind, Danaos, prime councillor and guide.
His counsel will direct us hero
Where we must dwell, and he decide
The place where malice may not reach.
For ready every one is found 950 Strangers to blame.
But may the best betide!-
With fair repute and with unwrathful speech
Of citizens, handmaidens dear!
Your places take, as Danaos bath assigned, A maid, as marriage portion, unto each.
Ye to the Argives should with sacrifice, As to Olympian gods, libations pour, My daughters !
for deliverers they have proved, Beyond dispute.
'Gainst those assiduous friends, 960 Your cousins, all that had been done they heard, Indignant, and forthwith, this body-guard, As mark of honour they assigned to me, Lest too, by secret spear-thrust slain, my death Should curse undying bring upon the land.
Such favours reaping, justice bids us hold
In higher honour still their kindly grace.
These admonitions too ye shall inscribe With many prudent maxims of your sire, That Time this stranger company may test.
970 Each 'gainst the alien bears an evil tongue, From which the slanderous word full lightly falls.
But, I exhort you, do me no disgrace, Crowned as ye are with youth's attractive bloom.
Not easy tender ripeuess is to guard;
Wild beasts despoil it,—mortals too no less, And winged tribes and treaders on the earth.
Her gushing fruitage Kypris heraldeth, Nay, the unripe scarce suffers she to stay ;
And at the virgin's daintiness of form, 980 Each passer-by, overcome by fond desire, Sends from his eye a shaft of suasive spell.
Forget we not then wherefore many a toil, And breadth of sea was furrowed by our keel.-
Shame to ourselves, but triumph to our foes, Let us not work.
A two-fold dwelling here, (One doth Pelasgos give, the city one,) Awaits us, free of charge ;
-easy the terms.
This only,—guard the mandates of your sire.
And honour hold in more respect than life.
990Be the Olympians gracious in all else!
Touching my youthful bloom take courage, father ;
-
For I, unless new plans the gods devise, Will never from my mind's first pathway swerve.
Praise the blest gods, state-ruling powers supreme, The city's tutelary guardians praise, And those who haunt old Erasinos' stream.
Companions of our way, take up the themo;
1000 For this Pelasgic city let us pour The song, nor Neilos’ mouths henceforth adoro With choral lays.
Nay, but those rivers whose glad waters lave, With increase fraught, this region where they rise, Soothing the earth with fertilizing wave.
View us, Chaste Artemis, with pitying eyes;
1010 On us may Kythereia ne'er impose Wedlock, with forceful rites !
No, may such prize Reward our foes.
Not that this friendly hymn disdains her sway
Who empire wieldeth, Zeus and Hera near, Goddess of guileful spells, Kypris, whose reign, O'er solemn rites extending, all revere.
4Sharing her honours, on their mother dear 1020 Desire attends and Suasion, who in vain, Her plea ne'er urgeth;
Loves with whispering play, And sweet Harmonia, these too share her sway, And wait on Aphrodite.
For us, poor fugitives, dire woes I dread, Yea, bloody wars my bodeful heart appal;
Since hither sailing, eager in pursuit, In swiftly-wafted ships our foes have sped.
1030Whate'er is fated that must sure befal;
The will of Zeus, almighty, absolute, None may transgress.
May wedlock find at last, As to full many women in the past, For us a happy issue.
From marriage with Ægyptos’ seed
Thy suppliants, mighty Zeus, defend!
All yet propitiously may end.
Cure seekest thou for cureless ill.
1040But certes thou the future canst not read.
How search of Zeus the hidden will ?
A fathomless abyss, I trow.
What moderation urgest thou ?
What Heaven ordaineth, that with patience bear.
lOGOFrom us this wedlock's hateful hostile rito May sovereign Zeus avert, of old who freed To from bale,-the while her frenzied speed With healing hand he checked, working with gracious might.
May
He with victory crown our woman's side!
The better part, though blent with ill, be mine!
O'er our just cause may Justice' self preside, Responsive to my prayer, through saving-arts divine!
[Exeunt in procession.
7. For γνωσθεῑσαι I think should be read ἐξωσθεῑσαι, extruded.8. αὐτογένητον φυξάν
ορα is the old text.
The sense seems to require an epithet meaning voluntary, in contrast to legal expulsion.
Perhaps the word αὐτάγρετος (Ionic for αὐθαίρετος) has been dropped out, from its similarity to αὐτογένητ
ον.
Then we obtain, with perfect sense and emphasis—45.
ἔφαψιν has no satisfactory syntax ;
in 43 the old text was ἀνθονόμου τα̑ς.
Parson changed it to ἀνθονομούσας, which is not plausible to me.
52. The old text τά τε νυ̑ν, should, I think, be γενετα̑ν, which completes the splendid conjectural corrections of Hermann and others, who change τεκμήρια τάτ’ ἀνόμοι’ οἷδ’ to τεκμήρἰ, ἄγαιονόμοισιν.
This one example may justly incite us in nonsensical passages to conjecture boldly.62.
ἀπὸ χώρων ποταμω̑ν τ’is certainly wrong.
A very simple correction will be ἀπὸχόρτων ποταμῶν τ’, from her feeding-places and streams, or eveu from her crofts and streams.
In Pindar we find χόρτος λέοντος :
in Eur. Iph. T. 134, χόρτων εὐδένδρων.
(Hermann's ἀπὸχλωρῶν πετάλω ἐγρομένα is audacity out of place.)70. If δειμαίνουσα be right, we have to join εἴτις with γόεδνα ... in the sense of “ I lament whether," which is cer­ tainly unnatural.
Dindorf prints δεῖμα μένουσα, I suppose merely to show what the metre requires.
78. For the old reading βωμὸς ’ʹΑρης φύγασιν, which is certainly wrong, an obvious correction is βωμὸς ἀρειφύγασιν, which would be unexceptionable if we found it in the text.
But other possibilities occur:
thus the poet may have written ’Αρησφύγετον in imitation of the word Κρησφύγετον.80.
Εἰ θείη Διὸς εὖ παναληθῶς!
This is nonsense.
To change Διὸς to θεὸς has no plausibility ;
all remains abrupt;
θεὸς followed by Διὸς is scarcely possible.
My present belief is that we get the poet's sense by ’Ιθεία Διὸς ἐν παναληθεῖ .... which means, " In the straight line of Jove, though drawn with perfect accuracy, the heart's desire of Jove is not easy to trace."
Then the abruptness vanishes and the argu­ ment is solid.
Moreover, in the next line τοι seems to introduce a general maxim.
This suggests to me that πἁντᾱ, which is weak, ought to be βροντά.93.
τὰν ἄποινον (the old text) is manifestly indefensible.
Critics do not seem to have observed that in place of it we need the accusative after ἐξέπραξεν.
Then we must put a full-stop after ἐξοπλίζει, and the sense needed will be given by Πάντα νόον δαιμονίων | μνῆμον ἄνω φρόνημά πως | αἀτόθεν ἐξέπραξεν...104.
The little word καὶ offends me, and suggests that καὶ διάνοιαν should possibly be παιδὸς ἄνοιαν.
Is the spondee in the third foot satisfactory ?107.
Remove the stop and join ἐμπρεπῆ with με.115, 116. πελομένων καλῶς I ἐπιδρομῶς ὅθι θάνατος any.
This is mere chaos.
The general sense needed is, that "incestuous marriages involve the gods in guilt:
" ἐναγέα must be the predicate.
I propose to change πελομένων to πελοι ἀν οὐ, which gives the sense excellently.
On com­ paring the strophe, it seems likely that v. 116 contains epithets of τελεα, as v. 105 of μέλεα.
To read for v. 116 ἐπίδρομα, lIda, θανατοσαγῆ, would be very close to the letters;
but I think θανατοσαπῆ, " laden with death," mere likely, and it is but r for Π. ’Επίδρομα I render invasive.
118, 119.
Punctuate with comma after πόνοι, and with full-stop after ἀπάξει, and interpret, " The distresses are indefinable, into what the wave is to carry us;
" that is, “It is doubtful, into what ”127.
I do not think that δόμος δ
ορὸς can mean a house of timber, as Scholefield seems to join it, but δορὸς perhaps ought to be δοραῖς hides.203-206, of Scholefield, but 207-10, of the Oxford pocket edition, seem to be out of order.
The first two lines should change places, and the fourth should be first.
244.
τηρὸν is difficult to justify and difficult to condemn ;
but I think ἰερόραβδον to be a fair and satisfactory correction of ἰεροῦ ῤάβδον.309.
It seems impossible that ῤυσίων can be correct.
1 suggest ψαυσέων, strokings, caresses, equivalent to ἐπαφη­ σέων.
The next line, which is lost, may have becu τίς οὐν ἐς ’ʹΕπαφον (or τίς ôῆτα κείνῳ) κλεινὸν ἀναφέρει γένος.394. μὴ τοῑον, for unlucky, evil, is not plausible.
μὴ τερπνὸν may suggest itself;
but there are too many other possibilities.
I conjecture μεμπτέον.492.
The old φόβον seems to me quite right, and the change to φόνοῦ needless.
"
Beware lest too much confidence produce alarm."510.
Perhaps οὔτι should be οὔ σε, as the sense seems to require.521.
πιθοῦ τε καὶ γενέσθω.
Obviously to me γενέσθω has supplanted some epithet of ἀνδρῶν.
The nearest word that I think of is πανεχθῶν.
This is in itself irreprovable:
πιθοῦ τε, καὶ πανεχθῶν I ἄλευσον ἀνδρῶν ὕβριν.528. γενοῦ πολυμνήστωρ cannot be right.
Dindorf prints πολυμνῆστορ metri causâ, I suppose, rightly regarding ὕβριν as a pyrrhic in the strophe.
Apparently for πολυμνήστωρ we need an accusative epithet of αἶνον, and for γενοῦ a geni­ tive or dative, such as γόνου or γονῇ (not γένους, for that occurs twice besides in the sentence).
I doubtfully propose νέωσον εὄφρον’ αἶνον I γόνου πολύμνηστον.
In the next line, τοι must be either interpreted σοὶ, I suppose, or changed into σοί.’ʹΕνοικοι seems to be for the prosaic ἔποικοι, settlers.
555.
Surely ὕδωρ τὸ Νείλου ought to be ὕδωρ τε Νείλου.
The poet says that the wind of the desert (τυφῶ μένος) and the water of Nile come upon the snow-fed fields of Egypt.
Like Herodotus, he supposed that snow, melting in the highlands of Abyssinia, kept the Nile full through the summer.558.
θείας is clearly wrong, yet it is hard to believe θυιὰς right.
My last thought is δαλὴς ζαθέαισον.574.
I protest against rendering ἕρμα, ballast, as an utter monstrosity, and suggest that it means gem, germ.
Compare Iliad, iv. 177, and ἕρματα for gems, ἕρμος, a necklace.
580.
The logic of τίς γὰρ proves that the previous lines assert the progeny to have been Jupiter's;
hence Zηνὸς must be predicate, and τὸ δὴ cannot possibly be right.
I propose to change it to τόδε.628.
ἀρότοις ἐνἄλλοις implies that aporos in a literal sense has been named in the previous lines:
I think, therefore, that ἄχορον has somehow come in place of the word ἄροτος.
In the antistrophe, for πράκτορά τε σκόπον, which is certainly wrong, I would suggest πράκτ
ορ’ αὐτόσκοπον.672.
Paley well changes τὼς to γᾶς.674.
I like the Aldine reading ἐπιβώμαν better than ἐπὶ βωμῶν or βωμοῖς.
We probably all adopt μοῦσαν θείατ, with Ahrens and Hermann, for μοῦσαι θεαί τε.678-680.
The common text is certainly wrong;
yet it may be corrected in more ways than one.
For τὸ πτολιν κρατύναι I wish καὶ πολιν κρατύνοι, which explains syntax and sentiment, so as to open the poet's meaning, probably, thus :
φυλάσσοι τ’ αἰσίμοισι τιμὰς I τὸ δήμιον καὶ πόλιν κρατύνοι I προμαθίαις ξυνόμητις ἀρχά.
This is the poet's ideal of a well-tempered free state. "
Let the folk reserve honours (public offices) for the virtuous, and let a magistracy of common counsel stablish the city by previous delibera­ tions."
Προμάθιαι is poetical for προβουλεύματα.
For αἰσί­ μοισι the old text has ἀτιμίας, which is manifestly wrong.979.
κἄλωρα κωλύουσαν ὡ μένειν epM, is confessedly non­ sense.
The first word is corrected to κἄωρα, rather (I think) κἄνωρα, since Herodotus has ἄνωρος and ἀνωρία.
῎Ανωρα, as less usual than ἄωρα, might get corrupted.
Further, I suggest, κἄνωρα [or καὶ χλωρὰ] κωλύουσ’ κωλύουσα σα̑ μένειν ἐρᾷ :
that is, ἐρᾷ (φιλει) κωλύουσα, “ she loves to hinder the unripe from abiding safe.
"983. For μὴ πάθωμεν I think we need μὴ λαθώμεθ’ (" let us notforget”), unless a whole line is lost after δορί.
THE END.
