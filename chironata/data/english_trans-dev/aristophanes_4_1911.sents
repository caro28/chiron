IT is much to be regretted that the phallus-element should be so conspicuous in the present Play;
for, in other respects, there are few dramas-ancient or modern-which contain more noble sentiments or morepoetic beauty than the Lysistrata of Aristophanes.
And in truththis very coarseness, so repulsive to ourselves, so amusing to an Athenian audience, was introduced, it is impossible to doubt, for the express purpose of counterbalancing the extreme gravity and earnest­ ness of the Play The debate between Lysistrata and the Chief Magis­ trate, her lecture to both Spartans and Athenians on their misdoings, and even the beautifullyrics with which the drama concludes might, unless framed in the most ludicrous and farcical setting, have well been resented as too serious for-Comedy, as dealing with matters μείζοναἢ ’πὶ τρυγψδοîς.
But none could objecton this score to wise counsels and political censures delivered by a woman in Lysistrata's position ,-- and the more practical her advice to the combatants becomes, the coarser the buf­ foonery with which we find-it surrounded.
That a Poet, from the boards of an Athenian theatre, should, for example, recommend the Athenians, for the sakeof Peace,.-to surrender Pylus, would hardly have been tolerated unless therecommendation had been dressed up in the broadest and most fantastical costume.
The sorrows of Athenian mothers for their sons, of Athenian maidens for their lovers, who hadgoneto the battle-fields from which they never returned, would have been a topic far toomoving and pathetic for Comedy, had it not been made a part of the quarrel between the insurgent Women and the outraged Magistrate.
And amidst the wildest buffoonery, there is always perceptible an under­ tone of sadness, and of genuine anxiety about the terrible position in which at that moment Athens found herself placed.
For the Play was written in the year 412 B.C. at the very darkest period of the Peloponnesian War, the darkest, that is to say, before the ultimate disaster of Aegospotami, and the consequent Fall of Athens.
It was produced at the commencement of the year 411 B.C., but whether at the Lenaea or at the Great Dionysia, and with what success, the scanty record which has come down to us contains nothing to show.
At the time when Aristophanes commenced it, he must have felt grave doubt whether it would ever be exhibited in an Athenian theatre.
It was in the autumn of the year 413 that the news of the over­ whelming catastrophe in Sicily reached the Athenian people.
It was so totally unexpected that at first they refused to believe it.
They were still dreaming of an ever-brightening future-anticipating daily the surrender of Syracuse, to be followed by the immediate extension of their power over the entire island, and, later, by the inclusion of the whole Hellenic race within the triumphant Athenian Empire-when the fatal blow fell.
The flower of their fleets and armies, the most splendid armaments that had ever left an Hellenic harbour, had been, not merely defeated, but utterly annihilated :
and their foremost citizens, their political and military leaders, had perished in the general ruin.
They had few, and those their least serviceable, triremes remaining, and little money wherewith to equip new ones.
Their allies, even those which were most important and had been esteemed the most faithful, were everywhere falling away, each wishing, as in the days of Brasidas, to be the first to revolt;
so that Sparta was even embarrassed by the applications which reached her from every part of the crumbling empire.
The victorious triremes of Syracuse were speeding over the sea;
the whole Peloponnesian Confederacy was stirred to new life and activity;
the States which had hitherto been neutral were now turning against them;
their foes were gathering in on every side to be present at the downfall, now judged to be imminent, of the Tyrant City.
The future was wrapped in the darkest gloom;
there was no gleam of hope in any quarter of the horizon.
They could no longer put faith in the promise of their favourite oracle that Athens, after long toil and pain, should yet soar for ever and ever as an Eagle in the clouds of heaven;
the Eaglets wing was broken, and the hunters were close upon her.
Thucydides, in the first chapter of his Eighth Book, paints with a few vigorous strokes the alarm and utter hopelessness which prevailed in the city:
nevertheless, he says, they determined that they would not give in (ἐδόκειχρῆναι μὴ ἐνδιδόναι), but would do all in their power, collecting timber and money from what­ ever source they could, to build a new navy in the place of the fleets they had lost.
Amongst the various measures which they adopted to meet the emergency, the most important, or at all events the most interesting to a reader of the Lysistrata, was the creation of a Board of Ten Probuli, a sort of Committee of Public Safety.
This seems to have been a genuine effort on the part of the democracy to protect itself against its own hasty impulses.
The office of Πόβουλοι, though new to the Athenian constitution, was common in Dorian states, and is regarded by Aristotle as a distinctively oligarchical institution, and as being, wherever it existed, superior to all other magistracies and offices in the State.
“
There are three supreme magistracies," he says in one place, “ νομοφύλακες, πρόβουλοι, βουλή;
and of these the νομοφύλακες are an aristocratic institution, the πρόβουλοι an oligarchic, and the βουλὴ democratic1.”
And again speaking of ἡ τῶνπρ
οβούλωνἀρχὴ he says “αὕτη οὐ δημοκρτικὴ, βουλὴ δὲ δημοτικόν.
For there must be some power whose business it is to devise measures to be laid before the Demus;
and this power, if few in number, is oligarchic;
but πρόβουλοιare of necessity few in number, and so they are oligarchic.
And where πρόβουλοι and a βουλὴcoexist in the same State, the πρόβουλοι are set over the βουλή ;
for the βουλευτὴς is democratic, but the πρόβουλοι oligarchic2.”
And elsewhere, speaking of what he describes as the supreme magistracy in the State, ἡ μάλιϭτα κυρία πάντων ἀρχὴ,he says that the power which convenes the assemblies is sometimes called πρόβουλοι, διὰa τὸ προβου­ λεύειν, but in a democracy it is called βουλή1.
And in yet another passage where he is considering the share which under the various con­ stitutions the Demus has, or ought to have, in the government, he says, “In oligarchies it is expedient either to co-opt some persons out of the Demus, or else to establish a magistracy (ἀρχεῖον) such as those which exist in some states under the name of Πρόβουλοι or Νομοφύλακες, and for the Demus to deliberate and decide upon matters laid before them by that magistracy;
for so the Demus will have a share in the decisions, but will be unable to upset anything in the constitution2.
”In all these passages Aristotle is not describing the position of the Πρόβουλοι in any particular State;
he is considering the meaning which the Hellenic people in general attached to the name and office of flpo­ βουλοι.
And it seems impossible to doubt that the Board of Πρόβουλοι established by the Athenians in their hour of danger were Πρόβουλοιιn the ordinary acceptation of the word.
3
And with this the presentation of the Πρόβουλος, in the present Comedy is in complete accord.
He is attended by, and issues his orders to, the Scythian archers whom else­ where-in the Acharnians, the Knights, and the Thesmophoriazusae—we find attending upon, and obeying the orders of, the (βουλή;
it is he who comes, not as an agent for others but in his own right, to the Acropolis, to obtain the means of rebuilding the fleet;
to him, and not to Council or Ecclesia, Lysistrata develops her scheme of reform;
and when the negotiations for Peace commence, he leaves the stage for the purpose of telling, not asking, the βουλὴ to send plenipotentiaries to treat with those who have arrived from Sparta.
We have already in the Acharnians seen the Πρόβουλοι of Megara, as the supreme authority, taking counsel as to the best course to be pursued by the State.
Of these Probuli we know the names of two 1;
Sophocles, probably but not certainly the Poet, and Hagnon the colonizer of Amphipolis and the father of Theramenes.
The others were doubtless also citizens in whose integrity and capacity the greatest reliance was placed;
and so far as the conduct of the war was concerned they thoroughly justified their selection.
Never perhaps since the great days of the Persian Wars does Athens so entirely claim our sympathy and admiration as when, under the guidance of these Probuli, she set herself, without ships, without money, and without hope, to prepare for what both she and her enemies considered her last struggle not merely for Empire but for her own existence.
The terrible calamity which had befallen the city had sobered all classes;
the voice of the demagogue was hushed;
and the people were content to adopt with docility the measures devised for them by their wisest heads.
The first and most pressing necessity was the creation and equipment of a competent navy.
This would of course require a very large ex­ penditure, and how were they to obtain the money ?
Fortunately at the very outset of the war a sum of 1,000 talents had been set apart out of the money in the Acropolis as a reserve to be used only in the event of an actual attack upon the city by a hostile fleet;
and for any person who proposed, or put to the vote, a resolution for diverting it to any other purpose, the penalty decreed was death1.
That reserve had never been touched;
the need for it had never arisen.
Nor had the specified event occurred even now.
But since the disaster in Sicily, Athens had been expecting to see the triumphant Syracusan triremes bearing down upon Peiraeus2;
and she had nothing to oppose to them comparable with those magnificent fleets which they had already, in fair fight, defeated and destroyed.
And when the most powerful of her subject allies—Chios with its 60 triremes, Lesbos, Euboea, and others-were going over to the enemy, it was practically certain that she would before long- be attacked by sea as well as by land, unless she could forthwith ex­ temporize a new navy capable of holding its own.
So then, no doubt by the advice of the Probuli, two resolutions were passed;
one, revoking the death-penalty, the other authorizing the immediate employment of the thousand talents for ship-building purposes.
The money having been thus provided, the next step was to provide a sufficient supply of timber.
This was always a difficulty with the Athenians, for Attica itself could supply little for building triremes, and in particular for making the oars which had to be extremely strong and, especially for the upper tiers of rowers, of very great length also.
Almost all the timber they required they were oblig-cd to import;
most of it came from Macedonia3.
One of the benefits which they hoped to obtain from their anticipated conquest of Sicily and South Italy1 was a plentiful supply of timber for building triremes;
and in later times a potentate could have no surer passport to the gratitude of the Athenian people than by making them a gift of timber 2 for that purpose.
In the present crisis Thucydides suggests, rather than states, the difficulty by saying in the first instance that the Athenians resolved to create a navy3, procuring timber and money from whatever quarter they could;
and after­ wards, that they did in fact proceed with their ship-building4 having procured timber.
And doubtless there were many still friendly to Athens who would be willing, if they could, to supply her necessities;
and others would do the same as a commercial speculation.
We have in the speech of Andocides de Reditu suo an interesting little notice about a cargo of ship-timber brought from Macedonia for the use of the Athenian navy, certainly a very few months, possibly a very few weeks, after the pro­ duction of the Lysistrata.
Andocides is endeavouring to show that even during the period of his enforced absence from Athens, he was doing what he could to benefit the State.
And he tells us that King Archelaus, the son and successor of Perdiccas, being his hereditary friend, gave him leave to cut down and export as much timber as he liked for oar-spars.
Accordingly he at once brought a cargo of oar-spars, κωπέας, to the armament at Samos, and though he might have sold them, he says, at the rate of five drachmas apiece, he declined to receive anything beyond what they had cost himself.
And, magnifying his own merits, he declares that but for the supplies he brought the question would have been, not whether the armament could save Athens, but whether it could itself be saved.
The date of the transaction is fixed by the statement that the Four Hundred were then in power.
Andocides, expecting nothing but praise and gratitude for the important service he had rendered, passed on from Samos to Athens, and found to his dismay that the relations between the armament at Samos and the Four Hundred at Athens were so hostile, that he was at once arrested and brought before the Council on a charge of having supplied corn and oar-spars1 to "the enemy," and, according to his own account, narrowly escaped with his life.
And he bewails his singular ill-fortune in being imprisoned (1) when the demo­ cracy was in power, for having wronged the Demus [in the affair of the mutilation of the Hermae], and (2) when the oligarchy was in power, for having befriended the Demus.
The foregoing little narrative illustrates in a striking manner the scene in the Lysistrata, where the Πρόβουλ
ος is hastening to the treasury in the Acropolis, now replenished by the thousand talents, to obtain money for the immediate purchase of—what ?
κωέας, the very articles which at this moment Andocides, knowing how sorely they were needed, was preparing to bring from Macedonia across the Aegaean to the Athenian navy.
Nothing could have been more judicious, or in its results more effective, than the measures carried into execution under the auspices of the Probuli for the immediate protection of Athens.
But it is impossible for a Board to excite the enthusiasm or inspire the confidence which might be willingly accorded to an individual leader of tried capacity and integrity.
And we can well believe, without the testimony of Lysistrata (lines 523, 524), that the citizens would soon be found inquiring in the streets whether there was no MAN in the land who would guide them into the way of safety.
Enough may have been done to stave off the peril of an immediate collapse of the Athenian defence;
but not enough to justify the slightest hope that Athens would survive the termination of the war.
Almost at the very time when the Lysistrata was being exhibited, Peisander, finding his oligarchical proposals strongly opposed, asked his opponents, one by one, whether apart from his proposals they had any hope that the City could be saved1;
and they, one and all, replied that they had no hope.
Nor was it till much later in the year 411 that the people ventured to entertain even a hope that they might yet be able to emerge in safety from the War.
For months the two main fleets-that of the Athenians on the one hand, and that of the Peloponnesians, Sicilians, and their own disaffected allies on the other­ had been manoeuvring amongst the islands off the coast of Asia Minor, unwilling to risk everything on the hazard of a decisive engagement.
But at length a general battle took place in the narrow waters of the Hellespont, and the Athenians, under the command of Thrasyllus and Thrasybulus, found themselves, apparently somewhat to their own stir­ prise, the victors of a fleet more numerous than their own.
Thucydides tells us that when the news of this unhoped for good fortune arrived at Athens the people were greatly encouraged, and thought that with energy and perseverance they might yet be able to surmount their difficulties 2.
Moreover they had then found a MAN in whose capacity, at all events, they could place the utmost reliance;
one who, had his character been equal to his genius, would have stood in the very foremost rank of Hellenic statesmen.
Alcibiades, who in 412 had been the leading spirit of the Spartan counsels, had now again thrown in his lot with Athens, and had already done her a service than which, as Thucydides says, no man ever rendered her a greater, and which no man but he would have been able to render her at the existing crisis.
For at once, on his arrival at Samos, he showed his superiority to the ordinary faction- leaders and demagogues who were the curse of Athens, by preventing the outbreak, then imminent, of a fratricidal war between the armament at Samos and the Government at Athens, and so paving the way for that happy compromise which produced what Thucydides considers to have been the best constitution that Athens had ever, in his lifetime, enjoyed.
But all this took place long afterwards.
At the time when the present Comedy was composed and exhibited the prospect before the Athenians was one of unrelieved gloom.
It was in a period of hopeless despondency that Lysistrata developed her original scheme for a general pacification of the warring Hellenic states.“
The Lysistrata of Aristophanes, in some of its scenes," says the late Bishop Wordsworth of Lincoln, is the best topographical guide-book to the Athenian Acropolis."
(Athens and Attica, chap. xiv ad fin.)
For the whole actionof the Comedy is concerned with the Acropolis.
The scene is, throughout, the open space before its entrance;
and its seizure by the Women, and the manner in which they hold it against the Men, constitute the central events around which are grouped all the various incidents of the Play.
And it may perhaps assist unlearned readers (for whom alone the following remarks are intended) to realize and appreciate the setting of the Comedy, if we devote a few pages to the illustration of the locality in which the action of the Play is supposed to be carried on.
The Acropolis itself, the original Athens, is an isolated rock, rising to a height of about 500 feet above the level of the sea.
In its natural THE ACROPOLIS.
state its summit would doubtless have been rugged and irregular, but it was levelled by the Pelasgians, the prc- Hellenic inhabitants of the land;
and, as levelled, became an elevated plateau about 1,000 feet long and 450 feet broad at its widest part.
Its contour is shown on the accompanying Plan.
This plateau they surrounded with a wall1 (TO Πελαϭγικὸν) which lasted, apparently unaltered, till the time of the Persian invasion.
But then, during the double occupation of Athens, first under Xerxes himself and afterwards under Mardonius, not only was the great Temple of Athene, the Erechtheium, set on fire, but all the other buildings of the Acropolis, including the wall, were thrown down, and consumed in one general conflagration1.
The portion of the Wall which was most completely demolished was that on the southern side of the plateau;
and this, some fourteen years later, was rebuilt by Cimon with the money arising from the spoil obtained in his expedition to the Eurymedon 2.
The rest of the wall seems to have been merely restored out of its old materials and the ruins of the other edifices destroyed by the Persians.
The southern wall is therefore commonly called the " Cimonian," and the rest the " Pelasgian."
But even the restoration by Hellenic hands of the " Pelasgian" wall must have radically changed its character;
and modern antiquaries are unable to detect any traces of pre-Hellenic work except in the little strip on the western side of the Acropolis, imme­ diately to the south of the Propylaea.
The entire Acropolis was holy ground 3 ;
and in the present
Play it is styled “a holy Temple," “a holy sanctuary," ἱερὸςmos, ἱερὸντέμνος (lines 483, 775);
and with greater particularity “Athene's mansion," "the acropolis of the Goddess" (lines 241, 345).
For numerous as were the Temples and statues which adorned its summit, they were all domi­ nated by the triple presentment4 of Athene as the Πολιὰς, the Παρθένς, and the Πρόμαχος.
The Πολιὰς dwelt in the Ereehtheium;
the Παρθένος in the Parthenon;
the Πρόμαχος was merely a colossal statue in the open, without any Temple attached to it.
The Erechtheium was the most ancient Temple in Athens, it had been in existence for many centuries before the Persian invasion, and was the ἱερὸν which, Herodotus tells us, was pillaged and fired by the invaders.
It is mentioned by Homer under the name of the δόμος’Ερεχθῆος1, and it is thither that THE ERECHTHEIUM.
Athene betakes herself on leaving Seheria (Coreyra), where, in the guise of a maiden bearing a pitcher, she has been showing Odysseus the way to the palace of King Alcinous.
Both Erechtheus and the Temple are mentioned also in the Catalogue of the Ships, but that passage, which is given in the note below1, is almost certainly an interpolation.
The Temple was burnt a second time in the year of the battle of Arginusae 2, but on neither occasion was it totally destroyed, nor does there seem ever to have been any real break in its existence or use 3 as a Temple.
It is impossible here to enter into the discussion as to the date at which it finally assumed the fair Ionic form so familiar to us all;
but whether partly in ruins, or restored, or rebuilt, it was always the “ ancient" Temple, όπαλαιὸςνεὼς, ὁἀρχαῖος, ὀ νεὼςὁνεὼςἐν ᾧτὸἀρχαῖονἄγαλμα, the original primeval seat of Athene's worship.
And the image which it enshrined, TO ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα, a simple olive-wood statue, was supposed to be no mere product of human art, but to have fallen down from Heaven (Pausanias i. 26. 7).
It was indeed identified with the famous Palladium of Troy which, the story went, was carried from the captured city by the hero Diomed.
His ships, on the return voyage, were driven by night on the coast of Attica;
and the troops, not knowing whither they had arrived, and believing the country to be hostile, betook themselves to ravage and plunder.
Demoplion the King of Athens, the King who figures in the Heracleidae of Euripides, not knowing who the plunderers were, at once attacked them, and in the course of the conflict the Palladium was seized and carried off to Athens (Pausanias i. 28. 9).
And it may be that the custom of bringing the splendidly embroidered Πέπλος to this wooden statue at the feast of the Great Panathenaea was a reminiscence of the Trojan usage which Homer describes in the Sixth Book of the Iliad.
There Hector exhorts his mother to go with the ancient women of Troy, and lay on the knees of Athene her most prized and beautiful πέπλος.
I quote the sequel from Mr. Way's version.
"Then hasted his mother, and gave command to the maids in her hall, And they fared up and down through the city the ancient women to call.
But the Queen passed on, and now in her scented bower she stands;
There lay the broidery-glorious robes (πέπλοι) the work of the hands Of Sidonian women, brought far over the waters wide....
And from these for Athene she taketh a lovely-woven pall;
Brightest its broideries shone, and its folds swept widest of all;
And it gleamed and it flashed as a star ;
mid her treasures the deepest it lay.
Then with the throng of the ancient women she hied her away.
So they came to the castled crag, and Athene's stately fane;
And Theano the fair-cheeked opened the door for the suppliant train....
And they lifted their hands to Athene, and woeful-wild they shrieked;
And the priceless mantle (πέπλον) she took, Theano the beautiful-cheeked ;
On the knees of Athene she laid it, the Maid of the glorious hair, And she cried to the daughter of Zeus most high with vow and prayer.
"Pausanias (i. 26.
7) will not commit himself to any decided opinion as to whether the wooden statue did, or did not, actually fall down from Heaven;
but he tells us that whereas all Athens, and indeed all Attica, was Athene's soil, yet of all her innumerable sanctuaries and representa­ tions, the wooden image in the Acropolis was accounted of all men the most sacred, τὸ ἁγιώτατον πάντων.
Hellenic architects could build more majestic temples;
Hellenic sculptors could conceive and execute far grander representations of the national Goddess;
but they could not invest their creations with the religious awe which hung around the simple wooden figure of the Erechtheium, the mysterious Palladium of the Athenian people.
Hence it was commonly called merely τὸ παλαιὸν βρέτας, To ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα, or even τὸ ἅγιον OpEras.
In this very Play (line 262) the Chorus of Men exclaim against the Women for having seized the Acropolis and taken possession of τὸ ἅγιον βρέτας, as if there were no other sacred statue in the entire Acropolis.
In the Eumenides (line 80) Apollo, advising Orestes how to be purged from the guilt of matricide, says Go to the City of Pallas, and there take thy seat, embracing the ancient statue, ἵζου παλαιὸν ἄγκαθεν λαβὼν βρέτας.
He does not think it necessary to say whose statue;
he does not even use the definite article.
There is in the British Museum a lengthy inscription brought by Chandler from Athens recording the state of the works at the Erech­ theium in the archonship of Diodes B.C. 409-408, some three years before the second conflagration;
and in this inscription the Temple is called, not the Erechtheium, but ὁ νεὼς ὁ ἐν πόλει, ἐν ᾧ TO ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλμα.
The inscription is given, with a Latin translation and copious annotations, in Müller's treatise mentioned in the note on page xxii, and by Boeckh in the Corpus Ins.
Graec., No. 160 ;
and, with an English translation, in Stuart and Revett's Antiquities.
Before this sacrosanct image a golden lamp was always burning day and night, a lamp so fashioned that it contained exactly sufficient oil to last an entire year, and accordingly required to be replenished only once a year;
whence in Strabo ix.
1. 16 the Temple is called ὁ ἀρχαῖος νεὼς ὁ τῆς Πολιάδος, ἐν ᾧ o ἄσβεστος λύχνος.
And it was somewhere in the precincts of the Temple that the little Mystery- Maidens, ἀρρηφόροι, mentioned in line 641 of this Play, or at all events the two of them who assisted the priestesses in embroidering the Panathenaic πέπλος, were lodged during their term of office.
Here too was the abode of the sacred serpent, whose opportune disappearance when the Persians were approaching the City gave such efficient assistance to the plans of Themistocles.
It may indeed be said with truth that all the sacred traditions and ritual observances of Athene clustered around the Erechtheium.
They had no doubt done so long before the Parthenon was built.
And as we know that the National Treasury was in the Acropolis, in Athene's Temple, Trapa τᾷ σιῷ as Lampito says in line 174 of this Comedy, it would a priori seem probable that it was placed under the protection of the Goddess in her most sacred and venerated sanc­ tuary.
But before considering this subject, it is necessary to make a few observations upon the structure and internal arrangement of the Erechtheium.
The particulars of the Erechtheium were first made known by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their great work on the Antiquities of Athens.
They described it as a conglomeration of three buildings, not all on the same level;
and they called these three buildings (wrongly, as I think) "the Temples of Erechtheus, Minerva Polias, and Pandrosus," taking the section marked B in the accompanying Plan to be the Temple of Erechtheus;
that marked C to be the Temple of the Polias;
and the small section to the south of D to be the Temple of Pandrosus.
In this small section the roof was supported by the female figures known as Caryatides, one of which is now in the British Museum.
C. O. Müller, however, in the treatise to which reference has already been made, considers the section marked D to have been itself the Temple of Pandrosus.
Mr. Fergusson, in a paper read before the Royal Institute of British architects on the 14th of February, 1876, and published in the " Sessional Papers, 1875, 1876, No. 8" of that Institute, would relegate the Temple of Pandrosus to a further building, of which all traces are now lost, but which he imagines to have extended to the west of the existing ruins;
and other writers have sought to provide for it in other quarters.
In fact, the Erechtheium has acquired quite a literature of its own, mainly concerned with the attempt to locate three Temples in a building apparently designed for two only.
It seems to me that all this ingenuity is misplaced;
and that the Erechtheium never in fact comprised more than two complete Temples, one of Poseidon-Erechtheus, and the other of Athene-Pandrosus.
The original Erechtheium belongs to prehistoric times and was appro­ priated to the worship of two Autochthonic deities, Erechtheus ('Ερεχ­ θῆος TOV γηγενέος, Hdt. viii. 55 ;
τέκε δὲ ζείδωρος" Αρουρα, Iliad ii. 548, cited in a preceding note) and Pandrosus.
Erechtheus was the primeval Earth-shaker1, the power whose might could divide the ground, and open or dry up fountains;
Pandrosus represented the all-bedewing, all- refreshing influence attributed to the lunar radiance.
But as the Hellenic race, or culture, superseded the indigenous people, or culture, of Attica, it was natural that the Hellenic deities should supersede the deities of the older religion.
The building itself was allowed to retain the name of Erechtheus, but his worship, if continued at all, was con­ tinued under the title of Poseidon, the Hellenic Earth-shaker, ἐνοσίχθων, ἐννοσίγαιος;
whilst the Virgin Goddess, Athene, the prime object of worship in the new order of things, naturally took the place which Pandrosus held under the older system.
And thence I imagine it was that Athene1, in addition to her ordinary attributes, became sometimes identified with the Moon, and that some Athenian coins displayed a lunar emblem 2 in conjunction with the olive-branch and owl of Pallas.
In this way, as it seems to me, Poseidon superseded Erechtheus as the supreme deity in one section, and Athene superseded Pandrosus as the supreme deity in the other.
In each section however altars were erected, and worship offered to other powers, as to Hephaestus and Butes3 in Poseidon's Temple and to Zeus Herceius4 in Athene's.
It would seem too that though Erechtheus became altogether merged in his supplanter Poseidon, yet the dethroned Pandrosus still retained a chapel or compart­ ment, close to Athene's shrine, in the Temple of the Polias.
This is shown by the incident quoted from Philochorus in the preceding note, and also from the statement of Pausanias that the shrine of Pandrosus1 was contiguous to the shrine of Athene.
But the mere substitution of Poseidon and Athene for Erechtheus and Pandrosus was not enough to satisfy the loyal aspirations of Athenian religion.
The name Erechtheium is itself sufficient to show that, in the original arrangement of the Temple, Erechtheus was considered a superior power to the female Pandrosus;
but it was not to be tolerated that the national Goddess should hold in the national Temple a secondary place even to the great Poseidon.
The transfer of the primacy from Poseidon to Athene is symbolized in the old legend as the result of an actual dispute between the two Powers with reference to the priority of their respective occupations of the platform of the Acropolis2.
Poseidon had really come there first, and smote the ground with his trident, so that the salt waters gushed forth;
but he did not take the precaution of securing a witness to his act.
Athene, when she planted her olive, called Cecrops to witness that she did so;
and on the strength of his evidence she was adjudged by the assembled Gods to be the Patroness and Guardian of the City.
The legend was evidently suggested by the fact that a pool of salt water existed in, or in connexion with, one of the two Temples, whilst an olive-tree grew in, or in connexion1 with, the other.
Thenceforward, Athene reigned as the undisputed Mistress of the City, the Πολιὰς, the Πολιοῦχος, the "Praeses arcis et urbis.
"Long after the commencement of the Christian era, the olive, the pool of salt water, and the mark of Poseidon's trident were shown to Pausanias within the precincts of the Erechtheium.
Such, in my opinion, is the most probable account of the development of the Erechtheian worship.
Poseidon superseded Erechtheus in the one Temple;
Athene superseded Pandrosus in the other;
and though Poseidon had the earlier'claim to the primacy, it ultimately fell to Athene.
And the architectural puzzle of arranging three Temples in a building only designed for two does not really exist.
There never were more than two distinct Temples, though there were many shrines, in the one Erechtheium.
In corroboration of the foregoing view I would point out the following circumstances.
1. Poseidon was known at Athens by the name of Erechtheus, and Athene by that of Pandrosus, from the deities whom they respectively superseded 2.2.
The pool of salt water which Poseidon called forth from the rock would of course be in his Temple, but being called the θάλασσα
’Ερεχθηῒς it was also no doubt in the Temple of Erechtheus.
The olive- tree which Athene planted must needs have been in her Temple, yet Philochorus and Apollodorus say that it was in the Pandroseium.
3.
Athene Polias and Poseidon (or Erechtheus) are constantly spoken of as the two co-tenants of the Temple without any mention of Pandrosus as a sharer in their dignity.
Thus in Plutarch's Symposiacs (ix.
6) one guest says to another “ Don't be intractable like Aias, but go rather with Poseidon.
He was worsted by Athene, but he shares with her the Temple;
and an altar of Lethe is set up therein."
Herodotus (v. 82) tells us that the Athenians gave the Epidaurians one of their sacred olive-trees, on condition that the Epidaurians should every year bring a sacrifice to Athene Polias and Erechtheus.
And Aristeides (Panath. 107, 7, vol. i. 170, ed. Dind.) says that Erechtheus is the πάρεδρος of Athene.
From the Erechtheium, one of the most elegant specimens of the Ionic order of architecture, we pass to the Parthenon, one of the most perfect specimens of the Doric.
The architect of the Parthenon was Ictinus, as we are told by both Pausanias (viii. 41. 5) and Strabo (ix. 1. 16).
Plutarch indeed (Pericles 13) THE PARTHENON.
couples Ictinus and Callicrates as the joint architects;
but in a matter of this kind his authority is unequal to that of either Pausanias or Strabo;
and even if Callicrates assisted in some part of the work, we may be sure that the plan sprang from a single mind, and that the mind of Ictinus.
The chief glory of the interior was the statue of Athene itself, wrought by Pheidias in gold and ivory;
gold being employed for the dress and the armour, and ivory for so much of the person as was left uncovered.
In the course of certain excavations made in the Acropolis during the years 1835 and 1836, the foundations of some older buildings on the site of the Parthenon were incidentally brought to light.
These older buildings do not seem to have been of the same character as, or to have corresponded in any way with, the building erected by Ictinus, but antiquaries at once jumped to the conclusion that they represented an earlier Parthenon which had been destroyed by the Persians.
That conclusion seems to me quite untenable.
The Acropolis was the origi­ nal “Athens,” and must have been completely covered with public and private buildings from Royal Palaces down to the humblest abodes.
And this state of things continued until the Persians practically cleared the plateau (ἐνέπρησαν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν is the language, already quoted, of Herodotus), and gave the Athenians an opportunity of transforming the crowded fortress into a noble storehouse of Art and Religion.
When the Parthenon was erected by Ictinns, it could only be erected on the site of earlier buildings.
And it is extremely improbable that whilst the Acropolis continued to be the most thickly populated region of Athens there should have been space for, or need of, a second great Temple of Athene.
It was only in "the spacious times" of Pericles, after the plateau of the Acropolis had been given him as a blank slate on which to inscribe whatever he would, that Temples and other great works were designed, not for any merely utilitarian purpose, but with the object of enhancing the splendour of Athens as the Mistress of a Mighty Empire.
And this is in accordance with all the indications to be found in ancient literature.
It is plain that Herodotus knew of but one Temple in the Acropolis;
τὸ ἱρὸν συλήσαντες ἐνέπρσαν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν he says in a passage quoted above.
And although the Homeric story about Athene retiring to the δόμον ’Ερεχθῆ
ος does not necessarily exclude the existence of other Temples in the Acropolis, yet the poet would hardly have described her as having her home in a Temple of which she was merely a part-owner, had he been aware that she possessed in the same little enclosure another Temple entirely dedicated to herself.
The origi­ nator of the theory of a " pre-Persian " Parthenon appears to have been Professor Ludwig Ross, who thought that he found confirmation of it in the explanation which Hesychius gives of the word Ἑκατόμπεδος, namely .
But by “the Temple burnt by the Persians " he means the Temple famous in history as having been burnt by the Persians, that is to say the earlier Erechtheium;
he is not alluding to any unknown Parthenon.
Leake (Topography of Athens i. 556) observes that "if we apply the remark of Hesychius to the Erechtheium it is manifestly erroneous, no dimension of the Erechtheium being fifty feet."
It would not be surprising if the measurement given by Hesychius is really erroneous ;
but Leake forgets that while he himself is speaking of the existing Erechtheium, Hesychius is speaking of the earlier Erechtheium which was burnt by the Persians.
And Mr. Fergusson, it will be remembered, considers that the Erech­ theium originally extended for some distance to the west of the existing ruins.
But without going further into these questions we may rest assured that the Doric Temple so well known to all of us was the first and only Parthenon ever erected on the Acropolis of Athens.
The statue of the Polias was of olive-wood:
the statue of the Parthenos was of ivory and gold:
the Promachus was a colossal image of bronze, standing in full armour with a spear erect in its hand.
Its height is, I believe, nowhere mentioned, but it was so gigantic that the crest of the helmet and the THE PROMACHUS.
tip of the spear overtopped everything on the Acropolis, and were visible to the approaching mariner soon after he had rounded the promontory of Sunium1;
just as in England the top of a cathedral spire may be a conspicuous object at the distance of very many miles, although the city itself from the midst of which it arises may be quite invisible except in its immediate vicinity.
The statue itself was, Pausanias tells us, the work of Pheidias 1, who made another for the Plataeans, of different material but of almost equal dimensions.
The date at which the statue was erected on the Acropolis is unknown, but it must have been, one would suppose, in the days of Cimon or Pericles.
The Scholiast on Demos­ thenes, cited in the note on page xx supra, seems to imply that it was done before the battle of Salamis;
but in that case it could not have been the work of Pheidias, nor could it by any possibility have survived the Persian occupation of Athens.
And the statement of Demosthenes himself2 that the Athenians dedicated the great bronze statue as an ἀριστεῖον τοῦ πρὸς τοὺς βαρβάρους πολέμου rather points, and I think rightly, to the period when ἁ πρὸς τοὺς βαράρ
ους πόλεμος had been substantially concluded.
But the language of an orator must not be taken too literally, and there is no doubt that the great statue had special reference to the primal victory which Athene gave to her people on " the pleasant mead of Marathon."
The very appellation Πρόμαχς was probably selected as a reminiscence of that memorable September evening whenThe attitude and general appearance of the martial figure, as it stood facing the Propylaea from its central position on the Acropolis, are clearly shown in coins delineated on the first plate in Leake's Topo­ graphy of Athens.
And more than eight centuries afterwards the vision of Athene Promachus patrolling the walls of Athens is said to have struck such fear into the fearless heart of Alaric that it deterred him from delivering an assault on the city which was guarded by her pro­ tecting care 2.
The reader must not forget that there were innumerable other works of religious art, shrines, and statues (some of Athene herself) on the Acropolis which, as unnecessary for our present purpose, are unnoticed in the Plan.
But he will find there, between the Propylaea and the Parthenon, a Temple dedicated to ARTEMIS BRAURONIA.
Artemis Brauronia;
Pausanias i. 23. 9. The great quinquennial festival of the Brauronia, mentioned in line 645 of the present Comedy, was celebrated in the seaside town of Brauron (Hdt. vi. 138, Peace 874, 876), and it was there, I imagine, that some specially selected Athenian maiden would walk in the sacred procession, dressed up in yellow robes to imitate a bear, ἄρκτος.
But the Temple-service in which all Athenian girls were expected to participate at a tender age and " to play the bear," ἀρκτεύειν, was doubtless performed in this Temple on the Acropolis;
it would not have been practicable to send such young children so far from their Athenian homes.
It may perhaps be permissible to add, though the fact has no rele­ vancy to the present Comedy, that almost adjacent, apparently, to the Temple of Artemis Brauronia stood a bronze representation of the Wooden Horse within which the Achaean leaders were taken into the city of Troy.
In this great bronze horse Menestheus, Teucer, and two sons of Theseus were shown peeping out from the inside (Pausanias i. 23. 10).
The Scholiast on Birds 1128 supposes that Aristophanes may there be referring to this great bronze horse;
a suggestion which seems to me quite inadmissible.
Before leaving the Acropolis, it is necessary to revert to a subject already mentioned, viz. the locality of the National Treasury of Athens.
THE NATIONAL TREASURY.
AVe know that it was " beside Athene" παρὰ.
τᾷ σιῷιῷ, as Lampito here (line 174) expresses it;
and again, that it was the inner chamber of her Temple" ὁ ὀπισθόδομος τῆς θεοῦ, as Chremylus tells us in Plutus 1193.
But which Temple?
that of the Πολιὰς or that of the Παρθένος ?
All a priori ideas would be in favour of the former, which possessed a traditional sanctity to which the Parthenon could never lay claim.
And the only ancient authority on the subject, the Scholiast on the Plutus, expressly says that the treasure was kept in the inner chamber of the Temple of the Πολιάς.
But modern antiquaries, examining the remains of the two Temples, declare that there is no such inner chamber to be found in the Erechtheium, as there is in the Parthenon.
And overborne by their authority I have reluctantly in the Commentary on the Plutus, as well as in the present Play, adopted their conclusion that the National Treasure was kept in the Parthenon.
But I am " a man convinced against my will" ;
and I should like to know whether the experts may not have failed to find an inner chamber in the Erechtheium, from the supposed necessity (which in my judgement does not exist) of finding a third chamber for the ex­ clusive use of Pandrosus.
It must be remembered that, when the Treasury of the Allies was transferred from Delos to Athens, the Parthenon was not in existence.
It is said that a recently discovered papyrus shows that the transfer was made in the archonship of Euthy­ demus, 450-449 B. c., and that the Parthenon was not even commenced until the archonship of Timarchides) three years later (Classical Review, xviii, p. 92).
Where then was the treasure lodged until the Parthenon was completed ?
And there could have been no treasure in the ὀπισθό­ δομος of the Parthenon when the Athenians made it a guestchamber for Demetrius Poliorcetes (Plutarch, Demetrius 23).
It seems to me that everything points to the ὀπισθόδομος of the Erechtheium, and not the ὀπισθόδομος of the Parthenon, as having been the National Treasury;
and that it is the plain duty of archaeologists to find a place for it in the ruins of the older Temple.
Notwithstanding what is said in the earlier part of this Introduction, it would not altogether surprise me if Compart­ ment B were discovered to be the ὀπισθόδομος of the Erechtheium, and the seat of the National Treasury.
The Treasury was in the charge of ten ταμίαι, chosen by lot, one from each tribe 1.
The sides of the Acropolis-rock were everywhere steep and precipitous ex­ cept at the western end, where a sloping road, no doubt partly natural and partly artificial, led up to the plateau at the summit.
The slope was about 168 feet wide and was sufficiently easy for the ascent of carriages.
At or about the time when THE PROPYLAEA.
Ictinus was completing the splendid pile of the Parthenon, another great Athenian architect, Mnesicles by name, was engaged in erecting above this slope a portal of no less majesty and grace than the work of Ictinus ;
so that, in truth, the Parthenon and the Propylaea were recognized as two of the chief architectural glories of ancient Athens.
The actual gates were five in number;
the central gate being the largest, both in height and width ;
that on each side of it being smaller;
and that at each end smaller still.
But the gates themselves formed but a subordi­ nate part of the entire fabric of the Propylaea, which was a building 168 feet long, divisible into three sections, a large wing on each side, and between them, a little thrown back, the central or gateway section about 58 feet long and 72 feet deep.
As you approached the Acropolis you saw before you a colonnade of six Doric columns, the central gap between the third and fourth columns leading to the central gate.
Pass­ ing through this gap you saw before you at a distance of about 43 feet the central gate, while on each side of you arose three Ionic columns, dividing the space between the Doric columns and the gates into what have been called three aisles, the middle aisle leading only to the central gate, and each of the side aisles leading to the two side gates.
When you had passed the gates you still had some 21 feet to traverse before you emerged through another and precisely similar Doric colonnade into the interior of the Acropolis.
The entire building, wings and all, was of white marble:
and, in particular, the enormous blocks, over 22 feet in length, which formed the roof or ceiling supported by the columns, have attracted the admiration of both ancient and modern observers.
The work was commenced in the archonship of Euthymenes, 437-436 B. c., and took five years to exccute 1.
It was therefore only just completed at the out­ break of the Peloponnesian War.
One, coming from the Lower City to the foot of the slope leading up to the Propylaea, would see on his right three Temples, all recognized in the present Play.
High up, on a sort of bastion of the Cimonian Wall, stood a little Temple of white marble, dedicated to 'Αθάνα Νίκη otherwise the Wingless Vic- THREE TEMPLES :
(I) OF VICTORY ;
tory1.
So all-pervading, to the Athenian mind, was the divine influence of the National Goddess, that her name was frequently prefixed to what was really an abstract idea, to show that that also was divine.
If the reader will look at the Plan he will see between the Propylaea and the Temple of Artemis Brauronia the shrine of Athene 'Υγίεια (Pausanias i. 23. 5).
And elsewhere we hear of Athene Πρόνοια, Athene Πειθὼ, and even Athene Σάλπιγξ.
Not that Athene herself was " Victory," or " Healthy or "Forethought" or "Persuasion," or a "War-trumpet";
but all these things were attributes or appurtenances of the Goddess.
And so the name Athene Νίκη, as regards Athene, differed little from Athene νικηφόρος, though as regards Νίκη, it elevated a mere abstraction into a personal divinity.
The architect of the Temple was Callicrates 2, of whom we have already heard as a claimant for the honour of having assisted Ictinus in the erection of the Parthenon.
The Temple of Victory was erected on a spot from which the sea was plainly visible, a spot memorable in historic legend as that from which Aegeus watched the ship of his son Theseus crossing the Saronic gulf on its return from the encounter with the Cretan Minotaur, and whence he threw himself in despair when he saw black sails displayed on its masts instead of the white ones which Theseus had promised, (but had forgotten,) to hoist if he returned safe and victorious over his enemy.
There was to be no mistake about the Victory now.
The little white Temple was a conspicuous object from many quarters.
It was erected several years before the commencement of the Propylaea, and seems to have rendered necessary a modification of the latter building.
For the southern wing of the Propylaea is, apparently, thrown back in order that it may not interfere with this little Temple of Victory.
The Temple was still entire when Sir George Wheler visited Athens in the year 1676, and was then used by the Turks as a powder-magazine 1.
But the Turks afterwards pulled it down, and worked the materials into a military battery.
However during the last century its remains were disinterred from the battery, and the Temple has since been re-erected 2.
Of the two other Temples with which we are now concerned the sites cannot be so certainly (II) OF APHRODITE AND PEITHO;
(III) OF Γῆ κουροτρόφος AND DEMETER CHLOE.
ascertained.
They are the last two objects noticed by Pausanias in his walk from the Dionysiac Theatre to the Propylaea 3.
He mentions five in all;
(1) the tomb of Calos (otherwise Talos) who was flung by Daedalus from the top of the Acropolis, and was doubtless buried where he fell, at the foot of the rock;
(2) the Temple of Asclepius in which Pausanias tells us there was a spring of water, and which is sufficiently identified by a disused well "about fourteen paces from the western wall of the theatre, and fifty from the rock";
see Dyer's Ancient Athens, pp. 344-6, and especially the passage cited from the life of Proclus;
(3) a shrine of Themis with a tumulus in memory of Hippolytus before it.
And then come the two Temples with which we are concerned, viz. (4) the Temple of Aphrodite Pandemus and Peitho.
The worship of these two deities was established by Theseus, ἐπεὶ 'Αθηναίους ἐς μίαν ἤγαγεν ἀπὸ πῶν δήμων πόλιν, Aphrodite Pandemus signi­ fying the love which had united all the demes into one city, and Peitho the persuasion by which that union was effected;
the original images of these divinities had ceased to exist before the time of Pausanias, but others by no mean artists had been substituted in their stead.
And (5) the Temple of Γῆ κουροτρόφος and Δημήτηρ Χλόη which, there seems no sufficient reason for doubting, is the ἱερὸν τῆς Γῆς described by Thucy­ dides as being in the neighbourhood of the Acropolis, on the southerly side.
From the place which it occupies in the narrative of Pausanias, as well as from the requirements of the scene in the Lysistrata, it seems to me that it must have been just at the foot of the " flat slope " leading to the Propylaea.
Colonel Leake, who places it in the wall upon which the Temple of Victory stood, seems to have misconceived the route which Pausanias followed in his walk from the Theatre to the Propylaea.
The three Temples we have been considering in the preceding para­ graph are all on the south or south-west of the Propylaea;
the brackish intermittent spring known as the Clepsydra, and the adjacent grotto assigned to Pan—as an acknowledgement of the services which he rendered to the Athenians in con­ nexion with the battle of Marathon—were also in close THE CLEPSYDRA AND PAN'S GROTTO.
proximity to the Propylaea, but on the other side;
the spring issuing from, and the grotto hollowed in, the northern side of the rock which formed the Acropolis.
These were natural objects, and are perhaps sufficiently described in the Commentary on this Play.
The great water supply called Enneacrounos is not mentioned by name in the Comedy, but is, I doubt not, the unnamed ρήνη at which the Chorus of Women had been filling their pitchers (line 328).
Originally a mere spring, called from its bright and sparkling water Callirrhoe, it was enclosed by Peisistratus, and made a vast reservoir into ENNEACROUNOS.
which water was brought by pipes from many other quarters.
To this reservoir was given the name Enneacrounos.
Its locality is a matter of discussion into which I hope that I may be excused from entering.
Suffice it to say that while there are many strong arguments for placing it near the Temple of Olympian Zeus by the side of the River Ilissus, there are also many strong, and on the whole I think stronger, argu­ ments for placing it in the valley between the Acropolis and the Areopagus, in the direction indicated on the Plan.
The only objects remaining to be mentioned in this connexion are the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.
There were statues of Harmo­ dius and Aristogeiton originally erected soon after the expulsion of the Peisistratidae in 510 B. C ;
but the original statues were appropriated by Xerxes during his occupation of Athens about thirty years later, and were by him carried away to Susa, a tribute certainly to their attractive character.
However almost the first thing the Athenians did when the cloud of the Persian invasion was dispersed was to erect new statues of the tyrannicides, probably duplicates of the originals.
It appears by the Marmor Oxoniense (line 70) that these new statues were ordered in the year 477;
and the statues standing in the time of Aristophanes were of course these duplicates.
But a century later Alexander the Great, taking possession of Susa, found the original statues there, and with singular generosity ordered them to be restored to Athens, an order carried into effect after his death. "
And there they still stand," says Arrian (Expe­ ditio Alexandri iii. 16), "in the Cerameicus, just where we ascend to the Acropolis," ᾗ ἄνιμεν ὲς πόλιν ;
that is, near the foot of the slope which leads to the Propylaea.
Arrian is speaking of the recovered originals, but we may be sure that they were restored to their original situation, whether they displaced the later memorial or stood by its side;
Pau­ sanias i. 8. 5.
That this was the situation in which the substituted statues were standing in the time of Aristophanes may be inferred with some confidence from lines 632-4 of the present Comedy.
I must repeat what I said at the commencement of this topographical sketch, that it is intended merely for the use of unlearned readers who may, I hope, find even this very superficial account of the localities, amidst which the action of the Lysistrata is supposed to be carried on, of some little assistance in enabling them to appreciate the progress of the plot.
At the commencement of the Play, Lysistrata, a young and beautiful Athénienne, is discovered standing alone in front of the Propylaea.
She has summoned an assembly of young married women, not only from Athens itself, but also from the hostile states composing the Pelopon­ nesian Confederacy, to meet her at this spot, for the purpose of discussing an important project the nature of which she has not at present disclosed.
And after some delay they come flocking in, the Athenians first, and then the Spartan Lampito with deputies from Boeotia and Corinth, both at war with, and the bitterest enemies of, the Athenians.
For the old Attic Comedy paid no heed to impossibilities;
the audience would not inquire how Lysistrata could have sent her summons through hostile lands, or how the women so summoned could have made their way past walls and sentries into the very heart of Athens.
It was enough that here they were, eager to know why Lysistrata had summoned them.
So now she reveals her scheme, proposing that they shall all refuse to consort with their husbands until the latter make peace, and put a final end to this fratricidal war.
At first some of the women are inclined to demur;
but Lampito ranges herself on the side of Lysistrata—as indeed there was always a secret sympathy between Sparta and Athens-and presently all the others are persuaded to concur.
Lampito herself how­ ever expresses a doubt whether the Athenian democracy will make and maintain peace in real earnest, whilst there is so much money (the thousand talents just set free for the purposes of the war) stored up in Athene's Temple, that is, in the National Treasury, supra, p. xxxiv;
but Lysistrata assures her that they have taken thought for that;
and that while the younger women are discussing matters in this Assembly, the older women have been told off to seize the Acropolis where the money is kept.
These elder women, or twelve of them, afterwards form the Chorus, or Semichorus, of women.
It is perhaps natural that Commentators should have taken less trouble about the Lysistrata than about the more widely read Comedies of Aristophanes.
Yet it seems almost incredible that they should as a rule have overlooked the broad distinction, which pervades the Play, between the old women in the orchestra and the young women on the stage.
Indeed the latest editor, Professor Van Leeuwen, in his search after novelties, dignifies with the titles Γραῦς A, Γραῦς B, Γραῦς Γ (First, Second, and Third Hags) Lysistrata's comrades whose youth and beauty are the very qualities relied upon for bringing about a termination of the War.
Nor does Lysistrata herself fare much better.
Notwithstanding the encomiums passed upon her personal attractiveness, notwithstanding the fact that Calonice, herself a young woman, addresses her as "child," almost all recent editors depart from the MSS., depart from the Scholiast, depart from common sense, for the sole purpose of styling her "most mannish of GRANDMOTHERS.
"This however is a digression.
Lysistrata's assurances satisfy Lampito ;
and the whole assembly-and of course there are very many present besides the few speakers-enter into a solemn League and covenant to carry out Lysistrata's scheme.
The oath which they take is prefaced by an appeal to δέσποινα Πειθὼ, the Goddess of Persuasion, whose temple, or rather the Temple which she shared with Aphrodite Pandemus (supra, p. xxxviii), was probably full in view.
Meanwhile a distant shout advertises them of the capture of the Acropolis;
the Assembly breaks up;
Lampito departs for Sparta to commence a similar agitation there;
and the others retire through the Propylaea, leaving the stage empty.
Now then is the time for the Chorus to enter into the Orchestra.
In Comedy the Chorus consists of twenty-four persons;
and as a rule they -all enter together, singing their Parodos or entrance-song.
But-both in this Play and inthe Ecclesiazusae they enter in two separate divisions or Semichoruses.
each consisting of twelve persons.
In the Ecclesiazusae one Semichorus represnets the Women of the City, the other the Women of the Country.
Here one Semichorus consists of twelve old men, the other of twelve old women.
In both Plays he- two Semichoruses ultimatelycoalesce, and rorm one ordinary Chorus of wenty-four persons.
Here the Chorus of Men (if it is permissible to apply that name to a Semichorus) enter first, with slow and laborious steps, carrying large logs of wood and pots containing fire.
They are vowing vengeance against these detestable women who have had the audacity to seize the Acropolis and possess themselves of the Holy Image, meaning the olive-wood statue in the Erechtheium;
see supra, p. xxiii.
And they threaten to set fire to the gates of the Propylaea, which therefore must have been made of wood, and to burn all the women in one common conflagration.
And finally they pray δέσποινα Νίκη, whose Temple was straight before them (supra, p. xxxvii), to give them the victory over these female desperadoes.
They obviously think that the Women will await the attack, cowering behind the Propylaea.
But in this they speedily find themselves mis­ taken.
Whilst they are busying themselves with their preparations for the assault other voices are heard in the distance, singing another and a far livelier entrance-song, and presently the Chorus of Women come pouring down into the orchestra, so that the two Choruses meet face to face.
The women have been filling their pitchers at the Enneacrounos (supra, p. xxxix), and having heard that the Men are bringing fire against the Acropolis they come with their water to quench it.
They have seized Athene's dwelling-place-so they call the Acropolis-for the purpose of saving Hellas from War and Madness, and they pray the Goddess, in her triple character of Πολιὰς, Παρθένος, and Πρόμαχος, to aid them in their design.
The leader of the Men is the Coryphaeus of the full Chorus, the leader of the Women is an ancient dame bearing the name of Stratyllis.
An altercation at once ensues between the two Choruses, which ends by the Men endeavouring to set fire to the hair of the Women, and the Women, in reply, deluging their opponents with water from their pitchers.
The tumult is at its height when it is suddenly arrested by the entrance of a great officer of state, attended by four Scythian archers.
This important personage is one of the Ten Πρόβουλοι whose position and duties have been considered in the earlier part of this Introduction.
It is not probable that Aristophanes is intending to caricature any particular member of the Board;
a Πρόβου­ λος is introduced here, just as a Πρύτανις is introduced in the Thesmo­ phoriazusae, merely because the presence of some high executive official is necessary for the proper development of the plot.
It is in the execution of the special duty for which the Πρόβουλοι were appointed that he is making his way to the National Treasury in the Acropolis, to draw thence the funds required for the rebuilding of the fleet.
But this is the very thing which the Women are determined shall not be done;
and a long debate ensues between Lysistrata and the Magistrate, in which the latter gets thoroughly worsted.
In the course of this debate Lysistrata takes occasion to develop her views-that is, the views of Aristophanes—as to the reforms required in the internal politics of Athens.
And it is worthy of note that, as in the other Comedies so here, there is not the slightest trace of political partisanship;
the reforms suggested are such as would commend themselves to every loyal citizen, viz.
the removal of abuses, the suppression of party caucuses, the blending together of all classes in harmony and goodwill.
The debate is full of interest, but it does not concern our present purpose which is merely to elucidate the various topographical allusions contained in the Comedy.
The debate between Lysistrata and the Magistrate having come to an end, both parties retire from the stage;
Lysistrata arid her friends passing through the Propylaea into the Acropolis, and the Πρόβουλ
ος going off to complain to his fellow Πρόβουλοι of the outrageous behaviour of the Women.
The stage therefore is again empty, and the rival Choruses in the Orchestra resume their interrupted altercation.
Four speeches are made, all in a pleasant mixture of cretico-paeonics and tro­ chaics, and each ending in a scuffle between the Men and the Women.
The first and third speeches are delivered by the Men, the second and fourth by the Women ;
the reply of the Women being in each case antistrophical to the preceding speech of the Men.
The latter begin by an elaborate indictment, in which they incidentally show that they belong (as indeed almost all old Athenians of the poorer classes did) to the dicastie order, not merely by complaining that the seizure of the National Treasury by the Women has stopped their μισθὸν, meaning the daily dicastic three obols, but also by denouncing their opponents as CONSPIRATORS seeking to establish a TYRANNY, those words so dear to the dicastic ear.
But if the Women become Tyrants, they, the old Men, will become Tyrannicides.
They will wrap their swords in myrtle, and take their stand-thus, ὦδε—beside Aristogeiton (supra, p. xl), and deliver a blow, as he upon Hipparchus, so they upon the cheeks of the old Women, suiting the action to the word.
The speaker is the Coryphaeus, and the woman threatened is Stratyllis;
but doubt­ less, as he strikes her, each of the other eleven old Men delivers a similar blow upon the cheek of one of the other eleven old Women.
For the whole Chorus speak by the mouth of their Coryphaeus, and act as he acts.
When Stratyllis deluges the Coryphaeus with water (line 381), we must understand that the other women of the Chorus are performing the same operation upon the other men.
When the Coryphaeus raises his foot to kick Stratyllis (line 799), we must understand that the other men are raising theirs to do the like to the other women.
When Stratyllis is extracting the gnat from the eye of the Coryphaeus (line 1030), we must picture the other women performing the same kind office for the other men.
This is a principle we must always bear in mind;
and it seems to me that Van Leeuwen's innovation of prefixing the name Κορυφαῖος to the lines which the learned Professor supposes him to speak, so dissociating him, as it were, from his Chorus, and making him almost an independent actor, is disastrous to the right understanding of Greek Comedy.
We cannot of course tell whether the objects to which the various speakers allude, such as the statue of Aristogeiton, were actually repre­ sented in the scenery of the stage.
Nor is it material;
for they were all so extremely familiar to an Athenian audience that every spectator would readily supply them out of his own imagination.
After the conclusion of these four speeches an interval of five days is supposed to elapse.
And when we are again admitted to see what is going on, we find that the separation of the sexes has become intolerable to both of them.
The Men are preparing to give in and make peace, and Lysistrata's scheme is on the point of succeeding, if only she can keep the Women from giving in first.
But this is a very difficult task.
We find them, indeed we see them, endeavouring to escape from the Acropolis by every loophole, and under the most ridiculous pretences.
But in this place it is only necessary to mention one, whom Lysistrata found, she tells us, clearing out a little aperture in the wall with intent to descend by Pan's grotto (supra, p. xxxix).
The issue of her attempt is not recorded, but I apprehend that it had little chance of success after Lysistrata's glance had fallen upon her.
And, finally, all the women are, by their leaders energy and resource, brought back to their duty, and agree to await the overtures of their antagonists, which indeed are not long in arriving.
Almost immediately Lysistrata, standing on the wall, espies a man hastening towards them παρὰ τὸ τῆς Χλόης, by the Temple of Γῆ κουροτρόφος and Demeter Chloe (supra, p. xxxviii).
He turns out to be the husband of Myrrhina who has a prolonged and tantalizing interview with him, in the course of which both Pan's grotto and the Clepsydra (supra, p. xxxix) are mentioned, and finally eludes his fondest hopes by suddenly disappearing through the gates of the Propylaea.
But the end is now full in view.
Lampito has persuaded the Spartan women to act in precisely the same manner as the Athenian women are acting.
Spartan plenipotentiaries arrive to treat for peace, and are met by Athenian plenipotentiaries appointed for the same purpose.
Lysistrata harangues both parties, and by judicious management brings them to an agreement on all points.
Peace is made, and to celebrate the event the ambassadors are invited by the women to a friendly banquet, which apparently takes place in the Acropolis, the θυρωρὸς who appears on the stage being, I imagine, the θυρωρὸς who took charge of the gates of the Propylaea ;
see Dyer's Ancient Athens, p. 355.
And at the termination of the banquet the guests reappear in a very festive mood;
and the drama comes to a close amidst songs, and dances, and general rejoicings.
My version of the Lysistrata was published, without text or commentary, in the year 1878.
I am not aware of any other poetical translation in our language.
A piece called " Lysistrata, a modern paraphrase from the Greek of Aristophanes," was produced last autumn by Miss Gertrude Kingston at the Little Theatre.
I had the pleasure of seeing it on October 22, 1910.
It was admirably put on the stage, and admirably acted;
and the Play itself was an extremely clever adaptation, by Mr. Laurence Housman, of the Aristophanic Comedy ;
but it did not profess to be, and was not in any sense, an actual translation of the Greek.
EASTWOOD, STRAWBERRY HILL,In the time of Florent Chretien, the tutor of Henry the Fourth of France, no Argument to the Lysistrata had been published.
And that accomplished scholar prefixed to his edition of the Play the following acrostics, in Greek and Latin.
These acrostics are given by Portus, and in the editions known as Scaliger's and Faber's.
Portus added a short Greek Argument in prose, apparently of his own composition.
Page 217.
In the scheme, given in Appendix 386, of the two choral odes, 303-311, and 382-388, the final syllable has unaccountably slipped out.
The concluding foot was intended to be a cretic ( ) not a trochee ( ).
In the background we see the Pro­ pylaea, the splendid portals of the Athenian Acropolis.
Before them, on the slope by which they are reached from the Lower City, Lysistrata, a young and beautiful woman, is standing alone.
Like Praxagora in the Ecclesiazusae, she has summoned her friends to meet her at the dawn of day;
the dawn has arrived, but her friends have not made their appearance.
After exhibiting various signs of anxiety and impatience, she suddenly breaks out into words, the abruptness with which she commences bearing witness to the indignation which she feels.
Why, had they been invited, she exclaims, to the worship of a God of Wine or Love,—the chief objects of devotion, according to Aristophanes, to the Athenian women—they would have arrived in crowds before this.
Of Bacchus and his orgies, and of the part which women (αἱ Βάκχαι) played in them, and of the timbrels which he and Rhea invented (τύμπανα, ‛Ρέας TIE μητρὸςἐμά θ’ εὑρήματα Eur. Bacchae 59) and which formed the invariable accompaniment of his worship (Id. 124, 125, 156, &c., Here. Fur. 888, Cyclops 65, 205, Catullus lxiv. 262), it is unnecessary here to speak.
I should be ashamed, says Hera to Zeus, in Lucian's eighteenth Dialogue of the Gods, to have a son like Bacchus who dresses effeminately and goes about with mad women, dancing to the sound of timbrels, and pipes, and cymbals, ὺπὸ τυμπάνοις, καὶ αὐλοῖς, καὶ κυμβάλοις χο­ ρεύων.
The expression εἰς Βακχεῖον might mean either to the shrine, or to the revelry of Bacchus ;
but the words which follow, ἢ ’ςΠανὸς, seem decisive in favour of the former interpretation.
-Amidst the various personages who figured in the orgies of Bacchus, none occupied a more conspicuous position than Pan, himself of all beings the most ἐρωτικός.
In Lu­ cian's Bis Aecusatus, 9, he is described as being τῶν Διονύσου θεραπόντων ὸ BnK­ χικώτατος.
And in the twenty-second Dialogue of the Gods he himself boasts that Dionysus has made him the leader of the Bacchic choir, and can do nothing without him.
—The names Κωλιὰς and Γενετυλλὶς are sometimes applied to Aphrodite herself, but sometimes (and always when in the plural, as in Thesm. 130) to the subordinate love-deities who formed her train.
They are constantly mentioned together, as the patrons and representatives of pampered and luxu­ rious love.
So in Clouds 52.
So in Alciphron (iii. 11) an honest country­ man complains that his wife is con­ sorting with luxurious city-ladies, and devoting herself to worship Κωλιάδας and Γενετυλλίδας and other fashionable divinities.
So in Lucian's Amores, 42, it is said that wives take up with deities whose very names are unknown to their husbands, Κωλιάδς, εἰ τύχοι, καὶ Γενε­ τυλλίδας.
The name Γενετυλλὶς is no doubt derived, as the Scholiasts both here and on the Clouds observe, ἀπὸ τῆς γενέσεως τῶν παίδων.
For the name Κωλιὰς they give several fanciful deri­ vations, as that a Victor's daughter, moved with love, unloosed the chains which bound the limbs, κῶλα, of his prisoner.
Possibly it was derived from Cape Colias, a low promontory some two or three miles from Phalerum, as to which Pausanias (Attica i. 4) says Κω­ λιάδος δέ ἐστιν ἐνταῦθα ’Αφροδίτης ἄγαλμα καὶ Γενετυλλίδες ὀνομαζόμεναι θεαί.
See Dodwell's Tour i. 427.5. κωμῆτις] neighbour.
Over and above the general distribution of all Attica into demes, Athens itself was, for muni­ cipal purposes, also divided into certain quarters or wards which were termed κῶμαι or ἄμφοδα, Isocrates, Areop. 52 (p. 149).
Hence κωμήτης or (in the feminine) κωμῆτις is used, as the Scho­ liast observes, dirt τοῦ γείτων κῶμαι δε τὰ ἄμφοδα.
So too Hesychius, Photius, Suidas s.v., and the Scholiast on Clouds 965.8. τοξοποιεῖν]
This does not mean, as the Oxford Lexicographers translate it, "to arch the brow like a supercilious person."
It means to knit the brows like a vexed and angry person, τοξοπιεῖν τὰς ὀφρῦς, συστρέφειν αὐτάς.—Hesychius.
Thus in Longus (Pastorals iv.
16) Diony­ sophanes, being enraged with Gnatho, bids him hold his tongue, σφόδρα τὴν ὀφρῦν εἰς αὐτὸν τοξοπιήσας.
And in Alciphron (iii. 19) the captured and scowling robber δριμὺ βλέπει Kat τοξο­ ποιεῖ τὰς ὀφρῦς.
The comparison is not between (1) a single eyebrow arched, and (2) a bow drawn to a semicircle, but between (1) a frown which knits together both eyebrows, and (2) a bow unstrung, and so forming one line with a slight double curve.
With Calonice's advice compare Alciphron i. 34 (to which Bergler also refers), where Thais says to Euthydemus οὐ πρέπει σκυθρωποῖς εἶναι τοιούτοις ὄμμασι.12.
πανοῦργοι]
It seems to me that this passage has been misunderstood by all the Commentators.
They take Lysistrata to mean that men are always describing women as πανοῦργοι, and now she finds they are right.
She really means that now she finds they are wrong.
"Id graviter fert," says Enger, " quod quum nequam esse mulieres viri existiment, idem ipsa nunc experta est."
But though πανοῦργος may often be translated by “nequam” worthless, good for nothing, it really means more than that.
A blockhead may be worthless, but he could not be a πανοῦργος, for πανουγία implies shrewdness, δεινότης, though shrewdness exerted for an un­ worthy purpose.
δεινότης, says Aristotle (Eth. Nic. vi. 12), ἂνμὲν ὀ σκοπὸς ᾖ καλὸς, ἐπαινετή ἐστιν ἂν δὲ φαῦλος, πανουργία.
A πανοῦργος is a fourbe, like Molière's Scapin.
In the Frogs Dionysus pro­ poses to bring back from Hades Euri­ pides rather than Sophocles, because the former, being a πανου
ργος, will be quite up to running away.
“Πανουρ­ γῶς !" is the admiring and delighted comment of a slave in Menander, where a girl is explaining to him her artful scheme for outwitting the Master;
Me­ nander's "Arbitration," line 318 (ed. Capps):
see Professor Capps's note.
St. Paul, writing to the Corinthians, sup­ poses an adverse suggestion, ὑπάρχων πανοῦργος, δόλῳ ὑμᾶς ἔλαβον, which our translators render with sufficient ac­ curacy being crafty, I caught you with guile."
By the men then the women had been described as πανοῦργοι, up to anything,full of shifts and resources ;
but Lysistrata, when she would combine them in her noble and lofty scheme, finds them up to nothing.
She is experiencing the truth of the Euripidean maxim :
Medea 409.20.
προὐργιαίτερα] of more pressing im­ portance.
Demosthenes seems to have this passage in his mind when he is contrasting the policy of Philip with that of the Athenians in a passage which the Oxford Lexicographers com­ pare with the present.
"Philip," says the orator, " makes much of those who act well towards him, but ye do not do this, ἀλλ’ ἕταρά ἐστιν έκάστῳ προὐργιαίτερα,” De F. L. 251, 252 (p. 412).
By τῶνδε in the present line we must understand the occupations which Calonice has men­ tioned, though we should rather have expected ἐκείνων in that sense.
It is impossible to refer it, as Van Leeuwen would do, to Lysistrata's scheme, which has not yet even been mentioned.23. πηλίκον]
How big? ?
The terms μέγα καὶ παχὺ are used, as the Scholiast ob­ serves, πρὸς TO αἰδοῖον, as they are in Ach. 787, Peace 1349, and Eccl. 1048.
With the question κᾆτα πῶς οὐχ ἥκομεν compare Frogs 647.28. ἦ 7rov]
This form, very common in Euripides, signifies the conclusion at which the speaker tentatively arrives, I fancy.
λεπτὸν is the natural opposite to παχύ.31. ἐπ’ ὀλίγου γ’ ὠχεῖτ’ ἄρα]
This is Dobree's felicitous emendation of the ἐπ’ ὀλίγου γὰρ (or γ’ ἄρ’) εἴχετο of the MSS.
The epithet λεπτὸν, occurring twice in the preceding lines, naturally leads up to this emendation, since, as Person observes in his note on Orestes 68, the phrase ἐπὶ λεπτῆς ἐλπίδος ὀχεῖσθαι is quite a proverbial saying.
Thus in Knights 1244 we find Paphlagon saying, λεπτή τις ἐλπίς ἐστ’ ἐφ’ ἧς ὀχούμεθα.
And Athenaeus (xii. 75, p. 551 C) quotes from our poet's Gerytades, ὡς σφóδρ’ ἐπὶ λεπ­ τῶν ἐλπίδων ὠχεῖσθ’ ἄρα.
Many similar passages will be found collected in Porson's note.
The metaphor is from ships riding at anchor.36.
τὰς ἐλχέλεις]
Of the Copaic eel, the darling of the Athenian epicure, enough has been said in the Commen­ tary on Acharnians 880-94 and Peace 1005-14;
and see infra 702.
They were the most delicious contribution sent by Boeotia in times of peace to the Athenian market.
Let them there­ fore, Calonice says, be excepted from the sentence of universal annihilation denounced against the inhabiters of Boeotia.
The Scholiast, after giving the right interpretation of the line, adds τιακοίς Φησίν.
He does not say that Hellanicus described them as dwelling in Boeotia, and it is at least doubtful if they ever did so.
They seem to have been an Illyrian tribe, whose connexion with Boeotia arose from the fact that the Cadmeians, the issue of Eteocles, when expelled from Thebes by the Epigoni, took refuge within their borders, Hdt. v. 61, ix. 43;
Pausanias, Boeotica v. 1.
Anyhow there is certainly no reference to them here.37.
οὐκἐπιγλωττήσομαι] οὐβλασφημήσω.
—Scholiast.
And so Suidas s.v. ἐπιγλωτ­ τήσομι and again s. vv. οὐκ ἐπιγλωτήσσο­ μαι.
But though the word is generally used in a bad sense (Aesch. P. V. 949, Cho. 1034) that signification is not in­ herent in the word itself, which merely means to utter with the tongue, as con­ trasted with conceiving in the mind.
It was the spoken word, not the thought, that was of ill omen.38.
ἀλλ’ ὐπονόησον] ὅτι ἀπολοῦνται δηλον­ ότι.—Scholiast.
Lysistrata means, and intends Calonice to understand her to mean, that unless the women can save them, the three great powers engaged in the war—the Peloponnesians, the Boeotians, and the Athenian empire­ will all unavoidably perish.
But with the characteristic reluctance of an Athenian to use ill-omened words about herself and her people, she will not say ’Αθηναίους τε πάντας ἐξολωλέναι, as she has said of the other powers, but leaves Calonice to supply those words for herself.
So in Acharnians 318 Di­ caeopolis will not speak of his head being cut off, but intends the audience to understand what he means.
So in Plato's fifth Epigram he throws an apple to his love, and begs her, if she loves him, to accept it;
but if-he will not say if she loves him not, but puts it as follows—εἰ δ’ ἄρ’ o μὴ γίνοιτο νοεῖς, then still let her take it, and remember how short-lived is its bloom and hers.
In all such cases the speaker, although he will not utter the ill-omened words, yet wishes his meaning to be understood exactly as if he had uttered them.
And Brunck's change of ἀλλ’ (ἀλλὰ) in the present line into ἄλλ’ (ἄλλο), with the sense of think better of my meaning, though adopted by a few editors, in reality makes nonsense of the passage.43.
θίῳ καὶ Φύκει τοίςὁ όμοίοις.—Scholiast, Suidas s. v.
Hence the reference to ἄγχουσα in Lysistrata's reply.
In Helio­ dorus vii. 19 we read of a woman παντοίᾳ
This line is twice quoted by Clement of Alexandria, and though in one case he gives the right reading ἐξηνθισμέναι, in the other, either by his own carelessness or by that of his transcribers, the word is corrupted into ἐξανθισμέναι, which several editors have inconsiderately in­ troduced into the text of Aristophanes.
It is of course well known that, auburn hair, ξαοθαὶ τρίχες, being very popular at Athens, Athenian women were accus­ tomed ξανθίζεσθαι τὰς τρίχας, to imitate the favourite colour by means of hair- dye ;
Clement himself had just quoted from Menander τὴν γυναῖκα yap | τὴν ;
and by Alciphron (Fragm. 5, ed. Seiler) we are told that the hair of Lais was curly by nature, and auburn without hair-dye, τρίχες ἐνουλισμέναι φύσει, ξανθί­ ζουσαι δὲ ἀφαρμάκευτα. Cf. Aelian, V. H. ix. 9 and xiii.
1. But ἐξανθισμέναι with­ out any reference to τρίχες would rather mean that the women themselves were browned, like roasting meat, Ach. 1047.
And Lysistrata, in recapitulating Calo­ nice's description of Athenian women, makes no allusion to hair-dye, but by the mention of rouge seems clearly to refer to ἐξηνθισμέναι, the reading sup­ ported by the unanimous authority of Aristophanic MSS., scholiasts, and gram­ marians.
—The verb καθήμεθα seems in­ tended to denote an indolent attitude.
In Xenophon's Oeconomicus, chap. x, after Ischomachus has persuaded his wife to disuse cosmetics (see the Commentary on Eccl. 929), she asks if she can do nothing by which she may really be, and not merely appear, more beautiful.
And he advises her μὴ δουλικῶς ἀεὶ ΚΑƟΗΣƟΑΙ, but to be up and about, to look after the maidservants, to shake the carpets and make the beds.
44. κροκωτά]
The κροκωτὸς was a yellow or saffron-coloured body-robe, ἔνδυμα (Schol. at Thesm. 261 and at Eccl. 332), much worn by Athenian women.
In the Thesmophoriazusae Mnesilochus, wish­ ing to pass for a woman, is at once arrayed in a κροκωτός;
while in the Ecclesiazusae Praxagora, wishing to pass for a man, appropriates her husband's clothes, and leaves him in exchange her own κροκωτί­ διον.
And probably, in the Agamemnon, when Aeschylus speaks of Iphigeneia κρό- KOV βαφὰς -Eg κέδον χέουσαν, lie intended to represent her as wearing a κροκωτὸς at the sacrificial altar.
The κροκωτὸς is said to have been made of silk (ἐκ μετάξης Schol. at Frogs 46);
and I see no reason for assuming, as some do, that silk was unknown to the Athenians in the time of Aristophanes.
45.
Κιμβερικὰ κ.τ.λ.]
ἔστι δὲ τὸ Κιμβερι­ κὸν διαφανὴς χιτωνίσκος, says Pollux vii. 49;
εἶδος ἐνδύματος, says the Scholiast here, ἀπὸ τόπου.
And so Suidas (except that by some oversight he changes ἐνδύ­ ματος into ἱματίου).
χιτωνίσκου εἶδος πολυ­ τελοῦς, ὃ λέγεται oraTos, Hesychius.
Our word cambric (said to be derived from Cambrai) seems sufficiently to represent both the name and the material.—ὀρθο­ στάδια, οἱ στατοὶ χιτῶνες, Scholiast, Pho­ tius.
The χιτὼν was ordinarily made too long for the figure, and had therefore to be belted up underneath the bosom, so that while the lower part hung straight to the feet, the top was gathered up into loose and ample folds.
Where the χιτὼν was made the same height as the figure, so that it required no belt, but hung down, straight and stiff, from the shoulder to the feet, it was called ὀρθο­ στάδιος or στατός.
χιτὼν ὀρθοστάδιος, 6 οὐ ζωννύμενος, Pollux vii. 48.—περιβαρίδας.
These were common slippers, worn by females of all classes at Athens.
The grammarians mostly call them simply ὑποδήματα γυναικεῖα or use some other general description;
but Pollux (vii. 92) says that they were mostly worn by θεραπαινίδες, and (vii. 87) cites from a comedy of Cephisodemus the line vvv δ’ ὥσπερ ἡ θεράπαιν’ ἔχω περιβαρίδας.
It is plain however from the present passage that they were also worn, and were con­ sidered attractive, by Athenian ladies.48.
χἠ῎γχουσα] ἄγχουσα or ἔγχουσα, rouge.
That the Athenian women at­ tempted to imitate or improve Nature's own white and red by ψιμύθιον and ἄγχουσα is of course well known ;
Eccl.
878, 929, Plutus 1064, and the lines quoted from the second Thesmophoria­ zusae by Pollux vii. 95.
And see the Commentary on the Ecclesiazusae, ubi supra.
ἄγχουσα, says the Scholiast here, is εἶδος βοτάνης ἧς ἡ ῥίζα ρυθρὰ, ᾗ ρυθραί­ νουσι τὰ πρόσωπα a! γυναῖκες.
It is the Dyer's alkanet, the anchusa tinctoria of the botanists.
Pliny treats of it in his Natural History xxii.
23 “Et anchusae radix in usu est, digital!
crassitudine.
Finditur papyri modo;
manusque inficit sanguineo colore ;
praeparat lanas pre­ tiosis coloribus.
”51. κροκωτὸν ... βάψομαι] " Crocotam ergo, ita me Ceres amat et Proserpina, mini tingendam curabo," Brunck;
and so all the Commentators.
I presume that they take the line to mean I will have my yellow robe re-dyed, and not "I will have it dyed another colour."
But even the former rendering is very un­ satisfactory, for Calonice, eager at once to assume the attire which makes for Peace, is not likely to suggest the tedious process of dyeing.
And I strongly suspect that βάψομαι has somehow usurped the place of a verb more analogous to the ἐνδύσομαι and κτήσομαι of the following lines, such as λήψομαι or βαστάσω.
Many have remarked the similarity of these running comments of Calonice to those of Euelpides in Birds 598-602.57.
—Scholiast.
So rapid, after the death of Pericles, had been the deterioration of the Athenian character, that whereas the Athenians had formerly been dis­ tinguished for being always on the alert and beforehand with their opponents (Thuc. i. 70), they are now on the contrary always behindhand, τοῦ δέοντος ὕστερ
ον.
The system which Pericles introduced of removing all restrictions upon the popular will, and so relaxing the bonds of discipline and political self-control, naturally tended (when his strong hand no longer guided the reins) to make the Athenians, as Plato says, ἀργοὺς καὶ δειλοὺς καὶ λάλους, Gorgias, chap. 71. In the following century this became a common topic of complaint with the Athenian orators.
See Demos­ thenes, First Philippic, pp. 49, 50.58. Παράλων] the people of the coast, τῶν ἐν παράλῳ οἰκουσῶν.
Παραλία γὰρ μοῖρα τῆς Ἀττικῆς.—Scholiast.
It was one of the three districts into which Pandion divided Attica, giving them to three of his sons.
Paralia he gave to Pallas.
He had a fourth son, Nisus, to whom he gave Megara and Salamis.59. ἐκ Σαλαμῖνος]
While they are wait­ ing for the arrival of the other women, Aristophanes takes the opportunity of raising the laughter of the audience by a few farcical jokes.
He mentions the Salaminian women, to lead up to Calo­ nice's remark that they, no doubt, have been from daybreak crossing (the straits which separate Salamis from the main­ land) in their skiffs, κέλητες.
The word κελης means either a skiff or a riding- horse, and in the latter sense is used to signify the particular σχῆμα συνουσίας to which allusion is again made infra 191 and 619.
See Wasps 501, Peace 900, Thesm.
153.
Jokes of this kind seem to have been specially employed in connexion with Salamis;
infra 411, Eccl. 38. And as to ὄρθριαι, at early dawn, cf. Ach. 256 and infra 966 and 1089.62. Ἀχαρνέων]
Next, the Acharnians are mentioned for the sake of the jest upon Theagenes (οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Ἀχαρνεὺς, Scholiast on Wasps 1183), whose noto­ rious superstition in never leaving home without consulting the shrine of Hecate at his house-door (see Wasps 804 and the Commentary there) is here trans­ ferred to his wife.
Suidas, both under Ἑκάτειον and under Ɵεαγένης, cites a proverb Ɵεαγένους Ἑκάτειον, and adds .67.
Ἀναγυρουντόθεν]
After Salamis and Acharnae we are introduced to the deme of Anagyrus, in order that Calonice may play upon the words of the proverb ἀνάγυρον κινεῖν, a proverb however referring not to the deme, but to the strong-smelling shrub known to our botanists as Anagyris foetida, "stink­ ing bean-trefoil."
It is a bushy plant, growing to the height of eight or ten feet, with laburnum-like flowers of a bright yellow and long seed-pods;
and was found in great profusion about the Attic village of Anagyrus.
It had a most nauseous smell, φυτὸν δυσῶδες, Hesychius, Suidas, Zenobius ii. 55, βαρύ­ οσμος ἰσχυρῶς, Dioscorides iii. 67, "gravis odore," Pliny xxvii. 13;
and when bruised gave out the scent in a pecu­ liarly offensive manner (τριβόμενος ὄζει, Suidas).
Hence arose the proverb ἀνά­ yvpov κινεῖν, used of persons who bring upon themselves some unpleasant re- SUITS, ἐπὶ τῶν κινούντων τινα ἐπὶ κακῷ αὐτοῖς.
The proverb is given by all the paroemiographers, Bodleian 56, Coislin 31, Diogenianus i. 25 and 52, Zenobius ii. 55 (Gaisford, pp. 6,123, 158,160, 266), and Suidas.
Calonice therefore, seeing the village dames of Anagyrus hurrying in before the rest, exclaims
We have stirred up Anagyrus with a vengeance.
She is referring to the village, but she plays on the proverb which refers to the shrub.70.
οὐκ ἐπαινῶ, Μυρρίνη]
So Thesm.
1213 οὐκ ἐπαινῶ, γρᾴδιο.
The plucky little Myrrhina was already Lysistrata's right-hand woman, and her dilatoriness was therefore all the more disappoint­ ing.
She attempts to make up for it by falling in at once with Lysistrata's objections.
77. Λαμπιτώ]
Lampito was the name of the wife of Archidamus, the Spar­ tan king who commanded the expedi­ tions into Attica during the early years of the Peloponnesian War, Hdt. vi. 71.
She was the daughter of King Leoty­ chides and the mother of King Agis.
By Plato (Ale. i. 18, p. 123 E) and Plutarch (Agesilaus ad init.) she is called Λαμπιδώ.
Here there is probably no specific allusion to the Spartan queen;
her name is merely taken as the name of a Spartan woman.
Hither­ to all the women on the stage have been Athenians ;
but now representatives of the enemy make their appearance;
Lampito comes from Sparta, and with her are delegates from Boeotia and Corinth, the two most powerful members, under Sparta, of the Peloponnesian confederacy, and at this time the two bitterest enemies of Athens.
Lysistrata greets them with enthusiasm.81. σιώ] τοὺς Διοσκόρους λέγει.
Λακωνι­ κω̑ς δὲ φθέγγεται, ώς οἱ 'Αττικοὶ νη τὼ θεὼ, ἤτοι τὴν κόρην καὶ τὴν Δήμητρα.—Scho­ liast.
The " Twain '' in the mouth of an Athenian meant Demeter and Perse­ phone, and the oath by their names could be taken by women only;
Eccl. 158. The " Twain " in the mouth of a Spartan meant Castor and Polydeuces, and the oath could be taken by men as well as by women;
infra 983, &c.
So both Lampito and the Herald swear by Castor;
infra 206,988.
If we may judge by the examples given in this Play, the speech of a Spartan was frequently tempered by the parenthetical use of the word οἰω̑ ;
cf. infra 156, 998, 1256.
The Dorians here, as elsewhere, speak in the Doric tongue;
but here, as else­ where, Aristophanes moulds the rigour of an unfamiliar dialect so as to make it more harmonious to the ear, and more intelligible to the mind, of an Athenian audience.
And everywhere the Commentators set themselves to reverse the good taste and good sense of the Athenian, by overloading the lines with the strictest Doric forms.
I have preferred to follow the best MSS.
and to present the lines as, according to their testimony, Aristophanes wrote them.
See the Introduction to the Acharnians, pp. xlvi, xlvii.82.
γυμνάδδομαι]
For the institutions of Lycurgus required the Spartan girls, as well as boys, to harden their bodies and develop their physical energies by a regular course of training in the athletic exercises of the gymnasium.
δίσκων καὶ ἀκοντίων διεπόνησεν.—Plutarch, Lycurgus, chap. 14.
And Lampito's hale and muscular appearance testified to the efficacy of his system.
One proof of her agility in particular she mentions, ποτὶ (πρὸς) πυγὰν ἅλλομαι.
For, as the Scholiast says, ἐν TO τω̨̑γυμνάζεσθαι πηδα̑ν εἰώθαδι, καὶ οἱ πάδες ἅπτονται τη̑ς πυγη̑ς του̑ πηδω̑ντος.
This exercise, as Florent Chretien observes, was called βίβασις, and Kuster cites the passage in which Pollux describes it;
βίβασις δέ τι ἦν εἶδος-84.
ὑποψαλάσσετε] you handle me.
ψη­ λαφα̑τε.—Scholiast.
Of. infra 275.
You feel me as though I were a victim about to be sacrificed;
which the sacrificers feel to make sure that it is in good condition.
τα yap ἱερει̑α, says the Scholiast, μελλοντες θύειν ψηλαφω̑σιν εἰ λιπαρά ἐστιν.86. πρέσβειρα]
This is merely the feminine of πρέσβυς, and, as such, is here employed in the sense of an ambassadress, afemale delegate, while in Ach.
883 it sig­ nines the eldest.
From its use in these two places we mayperhapsinferthat this femi­ nine was more in vogue in Boeotia than elsewhere.
We shall presently find (infra 697) that the lady's name is Ismenia.
ποθ' ὑμὲ is equivalent to πρὸς ὑμας.
87. ὦ Βοιωία]
This address would be suitable either for the Boeotian land or for the Boeotian woman ;
and Lysistrata and Calonice play upon this double meaning by using language which is applicable primarily to Boeotia itself, and only in a secondary sense to the woman before them.
Boeotia was renowned for its plains, or (to use the Scotch expression) straths.
It is described by the Scholiast as εὐπεδιὰς, and by Hdt. (ix. 13) as χώρη ἱππασίμη.
It was for this reason that Mardonius, on the approach of the Hellenic army, retired from Attica to try his last fortune on the plains of Boeotia, where there would be more space for the operations of cavalry;
καλὸν τὸ Βοιώτιον πεδίον, he said, ἀγαθοι̑ς ἱππευ̑σι KaL ὁπλίταις ἐναγωνί­ σασθαι, Plutarch, Aristeides, chap. 10. And Sylla, Plutarch tells us (Sylla, chap. 15, cf. Id. 20), was blamed by some because, when the general of Mithri­ dates was approaching with a great army well supplied with chariots and cavalry, ἀπολιπὼν τὴν 'Αττικὴν τραχει̑αν χώραις.
For these reasons the Boeotian plain, τὸ Βοιώτιον πεδίον, became so common a battlefield for Hellas that Epameinondas called it the " Orchestra of Ares," Plutarch, Marcellus, chap. 21. That βλήχων (otherwise γλάχων) our pennyroyal was a well-known product of these plains is shown by the circum­ stance that in the Acharnians a Boeo­ tian is represented as bringing it to be sold in the Athenian market.
See Ach. 861 (and the Commentary there), 869, and 874.
So far as regards Boeotia the country.
As regards the Boeotian woman by πεδίον we are to understand the groin and by βληχὼ, τὴν τρίχα.
And as to παρατετιλμένη see infra 151.90.
χαἵα]
The Boeotian lady having been disposed of, the Corinthian now comes forward.
She is introduced by Lampito as χαἵα, a Doric word equiva­ lent to ἀγαθὴ (Scholiast, Suidas, Hesy­ chius), and descriptive, generally, of a person endowed with any sort of excel­ lence, birth, breeding, character, - or appearance.
Of. infra 1157.
Though a Doric word, Lysistrata adopts it in her reply out of compliment to Lampito.92.
ταυταγὶ τἀντευθενί in these parts.
The sentence, as Seager observes, is pronounced δεικτικω̑ς, and ἐντευθενὶ, as he rightly adds, does not necessarily imply motion.
See Wasps 991, Eccl. 169.93. συναλίαξε] for ξυνηλίαξε, convoked, ξυνήθροισε.—Scholiast.
This is the verb to which the name of the Athenian dicasteries 'Ηλιαία, an Assembly, belongs.
Cf. infra 380.94. μύλειδδε κ.τ.λ.]
That is, μύθιζε ὅ,τι θελεις πρὸς ἡμα̑ς.
The words which follow, νὴ Δἴ, ὦ φίλη γύναι, are in all the older editions given to Lysistrata, and I have so left them in the translation;
but most recent editors make them the commence­ ment of Myrrhina's speech, and this seems to be right.102.
ὦτάλαν]
This and ὦ τάλαινα are favourite ejaculations of Athenian wo­ men in familiar conversation.
As a rule, they have no special reference to the person addressed, but are intended rather as a general exclamation at the pitifulness or wonderfulness of the situation.
103.
φυλάττων Εὐκράτην]
We know no­ thing of the circumstances to which the speaker alludes, and the Scholiasts knew no more than we do.
Their explanation, στρατηγὸς' Αθηναίων ὁ Εὐκράτης· κωμω̨δει̑ται δὲ ως δωροδόκ
ος καὶ προδότης καὶ ξένος, is obviously derived merely from the Comedies themselves, and does not rest on any independent historical basis.
And the last two words are almost cer­ tainly erroneous.
There is little doubt that the Eucrates here mentioned was the brother of the famous Nicias, who was put to death under the Thirty some seven years after the production of this Comedy.
It was also proposed to con­ fiscate his estate;
and the eighteenth Oration of Lysias "About the confisca­ tion of the property of Nicias's brother " is the peroration of a speech to be made by the son of Eucrates against such pro­ posed confiscation.
It makes no mention of the charge brought against the father, nor does it contain anything which throws light on the present allusion.
We can only guess that about the date of the Lysistrata he was in command of a military force in the Thraceward regions (τὰ ἐπὶ θρά̜κης, see Peace 283 and the note there);
and was so strongly suspected of some improper practices, treasonable or otherwise, that his sol­ diers were chiefly engaged in watching (see Birds 513) the suspicious movements of their own commander.
104. ἐν Πύλω̜]
This line is expressly given by the Ravenna MS., and gene­ rally, to Myrrhina, but some recent editors have transferred it to Lysistrata on the ground that Myrrhina's husband will presently appear on the stage.
We may, however, be sure that the three who complain of their misfortunes here are the three who, infra 112-18, say what they would do to get rid of them.
And indeed the old Attic Comedy took no count of little inconsistencies of this kind ;
and besides, as at least five days will have elapsed before Cinesias makes his appearance, he might easily during that interval have returned from Pylus to Athens.
Pylus was still in the possession of the Athenians;
see infra 1163.
It was recaptured about two years later.
106. πορπακισάμενος]
This is generally translated "having taken up his shield ";
but though that would be the result of the operation, it is not really the opera­ tion itself described by the word.
It means having fastened the shield-strap to the shield, and alludes to the Spartan custom of having the straps or handles of their shields made removable.
A Spartan, on his return from an expedi­ tion, would remove the handle from the shield, to ensure that the Helots, if they were to rise in insurrrection, should not seize it strapped ready for action.
See the Commentary on Knights 849.
And it was not until he was about to start on a new expedition that he would re­ fasten the shield-strap to the shield.
"108. Μιλήσιοι]
Miletushad fallen away from Athens during the preceding sum­ mer (Thuc. viii. 17), and was for some time the head-quarters of the Peloponne­ sian forces, and the scene of several im­ portant operations between them and the Athenians (Id.24-36).
It had an evil repu­ tation as the Sybaris of Ionia (Diod. Sic. viii. 20, and see Plutus 1002 and the note there);
and the suggestion here is that its panders to vice manufactured the "penem coriaceum octo digitos longum" which the women are accusedof employing.
110.
σκυτίνη 'πικουρία]
She is playing on the proverbial phrase συκίνη ἐπικουρία which, as the Scholiast observes, was applied to persons who give but a feeble support to their friends, the wood of the fig-tree being weak, and incapable of yielding a firm support.
Σύκινον, says the Scholiast on Plutus 946, is equivalent to ἀσθενέστατον. τὸ yap ξύλον τη̑ς συκη̑̑ς ἀσθενὲς καὶ ἀνωφελὲς, ὅθεν καὶ " συκίνη ἐπικουρία."
And so Hesychius, s.v. σύκι­ vov.
Lysistrata means to express her contempt for these artificial substitutes ;
but she changes συκίνη into σκυτίνη, be­ cause she is dealing with αἰδοι̑α δερμάτινα.
Athenaeus (xii. 75) preserves a line from a comedy of Strattis, Σαννυρίωνος σκυτίνη 'πικουρία, which has received many differ­ ent interpretations, but as Athenaeus is citing it in connexion with the ex­ treme tenuity of Sannyrion, it probably refers, as Dalecamp suggested, to the leathern stays with which, we may readily believe, he was accustomed to support his person.
No doubt which­ ever was the later of the two Comedies borrowed the phrase from the earlier.
114.
καταθει̑σαν]
Even though it were necessary for me to throw down this mantle and—the word expected was fight, but ἐκπιει̑ν·ιs substituted Trapa προσδοκίαν, as a jest upon the bibulous propensities attributed to Athenian women.
As to ἔγκυκλον, a mantle, a woman's ἱμάτιον, see the Commentary on Thesm.
249, and as to throwing down the ἱμάτιον in preparation for a fight, see Thesm.
548 and the note there.
The Commentators mostly attach to καταθει̑σαν the signification of " pledg­ ing," a signification it may well bear after the surprise-word ἐκπιει̑ν has made its appearance, but which is not suitable to the primary meaning of the line.
And although the regular form for put­ ting off a garment is the middle, Kara­ θεμένην, yet the active, καταθει̑σαν, cannot lose its ordinary meaning of putting a thing down (infra 202) merely because it happens to be applied to a garment.115.
ψη̑τταν] a turbot.
'Ρωμαι̑οι καλου̑σι τὴν ψη̑τταν ῥόμβον, says Athenaeus vii, last chapter but one.
The turbot is with our ichthyologists Rhombus maxi­ mus ;
the brill, Rhombus vulgaris.
The Rhombus of the Fourth Satire of Juvenal must certainly have been a turbot.
Calo­ nice is alluding to the popular notion that two flat fishes are in reality but one fish cut in halves;
a notion derived from their peculiar shape and appearance, and illustrated by their German name Halbfische.
In the Symposium of Plato 191 D, Aristophanes, expounding his theory that the lover and the loved are really parts of one entity, says ἕκαστος And Lucian (Piscator, 49), angling for philosophers, says 'Ιδοὺ, τίς ἄλλος οὗτοςο πλατὺς, ὥσπερ ἡμίτομος ὶχθὺς προσέρχεται ;
117. Ταὔγετον]
This was no easy task, for the mighty mountain which rises in abrupt and dizzy precipices to the west of the Amyclaean plain is " probably inferior in height only to Pindus, Cyllene, and Olympus.
It is visible from Zacynthus, which in a straight line is distant from it at least eighty-four miles.
The northern crevices are covered with snow during the whole of the year," Dodwell's Tour ii.
410.
That careful and accurate traveller is warmed almost to enthusiasm by the grandeur and beauty of the great mountain range with " its pointed and snowy summits glittering in the deep azure of the sky," Id. 388. '•
All the plains and all the mountains that I have seen,'' he says, "are surpassed in the variety of their combinations and the beauty of their appearance by the plain of Lacedaemon and Mt. Taygeton," Id. 408.
"The first view of its dazzling and snowy peaks and black forests crowning the huge masses of rock which rise perpen­ dicularly from the brilliant Spartan plain in one row of colossal precipices excited feelings of awe and admiration such as I never experienced on any similar occasion," Col. Mure, Tour in Greece i. 209. "
One scarcely realizes at home," says an anonymous writer, "how much Sparta, ancient and modern, is at the foot of towering mountains.
The plain is fertile and well cultivated, rich in olives and vines, in mulberries and Indian corn, but the dominating physical fact of the situation is the rocky barrier so close at hand.
We are under the lee of the mountains and cannot get away from their mighty shadows without quitting the Spartan valley altogether."
The valley of Spar­ ta," says Ruskin, "is one of the noblest mountain ravines in the world;
the western flank of it is formed by an un­ broken chain of crags, forty miles long, rising, opposite Sparta, to a height of 8,000 feet, and known as the chain of Taygetus," Queen of the Air 26.125.
μεταστρέφεσθε]
Lysistrata's pro­ position is received by her friends with every symptom of repugnance and dis­ may.
They turn their backs and move away (ὡς ἀηδισθεισω̑ν αὐτω̑ν Kat μεταστρα­ φεισω̑ν ὲπὶ τω̜̑ λόγω̝, Scholiast);
they coin­ press their lips (μυα̑ν γὰρ τὸ τὰ χείλη πρὸς ἄλληλα συνάγειν, Scholiast) and shake their heads (see the παρεπιγραφὴ after Ach. 113 and the note there);
whilst their changing colour and their falling tears bear witness to the anguish of their souls, θαλερόν τε κατείβετο δάκρυ παρειων.129. ὁ πόλεμος ἑρπέτω
Let the war go on.
This expression is borrowed from Knights 673 where see the note.
135.
οὐδὲν οἷον]
There is nothing like it.
See Birds 966, Plato, Gorgias, chaps. 1 and 37 (pp. 447 C and 481 B), and the Commentary on the Birds.139.
Ποσειδω̑ν καὶσκάφη]
Nothing, she means, but an intrigue and its natural consequence, the exposure of the child ;
nothing but a lover and a baby-basket.
These are the matters on which all our thoughts are fixed, we cannot rise to higher and nobler aims.
In the terms which she uses she is alluding to the Tyro of Sophocles (ἀφ' ἡμω̑ν εἰσιν a! τραγω̜δίαι), which, in a revised shape, was probably acted shortly before the Birds.
See Scholiast on Birds 275;
Wagner, Fragm.
Trag. Gr. i. 410.
Tyro, the daughter of Salmoneus, having borne twin sons to Poseidon, endeavoured to conceal her shame by exposing them in a σκάφη (just as Romulus and Remus, in a like case, were placed εἰς σκάφην to be cast into the Tiber, Plutarch, Rom. chap. 4).
The boys, when grown up, return to their home, and in the recog­ nition-scene which ensues the σκάφη plays a conspicuous part as a means of identification.
Aristotle (Poetics xvi. 3), classifying the various modes of re­ cognition, εἴδη ἀναγνωρίσεως, observes that identification sometimes takes place by means of personal marks, sometimes by external tokens, olov ἐν145.
μόνη τούτων γυνή]
The precise meaning of these words is extremely doubtful.
They are generally trans­ lated " the only woman of them all," " sola harum femina " (Brunck, follow­ ing Bergler);
which, considering the judgement just pronounced by the speaker on her sex, would be but a sorry compliment.
It seems to me that the word γυνὴ applies to the entire line, to φιλτάτη as well as μόνη, just as if it had run ὦ φιλτάτη γυνὴ σὺ καὶ τουτων μόνη.
And this, I think, was the Scho­ liast's view who explains μόνη] by μόνη γυνὴ δυναμέη μηχανὴν εὑρε̑ν ;
an interpre­ tation, however, which cannot be strictly accurate.
In my opinion Lysistrata is referring to the words she employed just above, μόνη μετ ἐμου̑, and means that Lampito is the only one with her, not only φιλτάτη but the only one of them all who is so, the Abdiel of the cause.
In her enthusiasm she speaks abruptly, but means (to borrow from my own translation) " 0 dearest friend, my one true friend of all."
And so, I imagine, Florent Chretien understood the line, when he translated it " 0 om­ nium harum sola dulcis foemina."
And in claiming the Spartan woman as her one true friend of all, the Athenian woman may seem to have been endowed with a sort of prescience, since seven years later, when the day of doom ar­ rived for Athens, Sparta proved herself in very truth her " one true friend of all," by resolutely standing between her and the vengeance of her enemies.
See the Introduction to the Ecclesia­ zusae, pp. ix, x.149. ἐντετριμμέναι] powdered, with cos­ metics rubbed in, Eccl. 732 and 904.
Alexis, in a passage cited by Athenaeus (xiii. 23, p. 568 C), dilating on the art with which women disguise their natural blemishes, says
It is noteworthy that though here, as supra 42-8, Lysistrata expounds in the clearest manner her plan of the cam­ paign, yet it is really conducted on totally different lines.
Not for one moment do the women sit at home endeavouring to attract the men.
On the contrary they keep out of their way as much as they possibly can.150. ἀμοργίνοις] made of the finest lawn.
This was manufactured from flax grown in the island of Amorgos.
ἒστι δὲ σφόδρα λεπτὀν, says the Scholiast on 735 infra, ὑπὲρ τὴν βύσσον ἢ τὴν κάρ­ πασ
ον.
The material was quite trans­ parent, whence the women wearing it are called γυμναὶ in the following line.
151.
παρίοιμεν]
This compound is con­ trasted with the προσίοιμεν of two lines below, " if we walk by them, but not to them."
With πυρατετιλμέναι cf. supra 89.
δέλτα here, as πεδίον there, signifies the groin.
The Scholiast explains πλε­ κο̑ν by συν
ουσιάζειν.155. ὁ Μενέλαος]
The Spartan woman cites a Spartan precedent.
The legend that, after the fall of Troy, Menelaus, when about to slay his faithless wife, was so softened by her beauty that he cast his sword away, is found, the Scho­ liast informs us, in the " Little Iliad" of Lesches;
and is also, as he adds, re­ corded by Euripides (Andromache 627).
And it is introduced, with great effect, into Tennyson's splendid description of the disordered dreams of Lucretius.
Then, then, from utter gloom stood out the breasts, The breasts of Helen, and hoveringly a sword Now over and now under, now direct, Pointed itself to pierce, but sank down shamed At all that beauty.
158.
Φερεκράτους]
This is supposed to be the Comic Poet, the senior contem­ porary of Aristophanes, though the words were not to be found in his Comedies surviving at the time when the Scholiasts wrote.
The proverb, as coined by the Poet, seems to be equivalent to the Latin nudo detrahere vestimenta, Plau­ tus, Asinaria i. 1. 79;
and is used, the proverb collectors tell us, ἐπὶ τῶν μάτην πονούντων (Coislin 296 ;
Diogen. v. 85 ;
Gaisford Paroemiogr. pp. 146, 200), and so the Scholiast and Suidas.

With these words Calonice and her friends finally give in their adhesion to the scheme proposed by Lysistrata.
So in the Birds (1630), Poseidon, finding himself outvoted by Heracles and the Triballian, withdraws his opposition with the words εἲ τοι SokEI σφῷν ταῦτα, κἀμοὶ συνδοκεῖ.
So in the uprising against the Four Hundred, a few months after the exhibition of this Play, when the soldiers are eager to demolish the fort at Eetionia, Thera­ menes after a faint show of opposition to their wishes, gives way with the words εἲπερ teal ἐκείνοις δοκεῖ καθαιρεῖν, feat ἐαυτῷ
ξυνδοκεῖν, Thuc. viii.
92.169. δικαίως ἂδολον]
These words are constantly found in treaties.
See Birds 633 and the Commentary there.170. ῤυάχετον]
Hesychius and Photius give two meanings to this word, viz. θόρυβον, a racket, and τὸν ῥέοντα °XETÓV.
The Scholiast and Suidas explain it by θόρυβον and συρφετόν.
Here it seems to be used for an unstable and tumultuous mob.
πλαδδίην in the following line, and infra 990, means to play the fool.173.
ἇςπόδας] ἇςstands for ἒως, and I have, though with some hesitation, ac­ cepted πόδας, the emendation of Valcke­ naer and Tyrwhitt, for the MS.
read­ ing σποδᾶς.
The MS.
reading would mean "
Not while the triremes have so much attention paid them";
the amendment, Not while your triremes are equipped with ropes and sails;
not while you hare so many triremes ready for active service, or more strictly, as Tyrwhitt renders it, "Non quamdiu pedes (velo­ rum sc. funes) habent triremes."
"Inter navium instrumenta," he adds, ' saepis­ sime memorantur οἱ πόδες, Odyss. v. 260;
Eurip. Orest. 706;
Aristoph. Eq. 436." See the Commentary on the last-cited passage.
The Scholiast here174.
τἀργύριον]
Lampito is referring to the 1,000 silver talents which Pericles had set apart at the commencement of the war (Thuc. ii. 24) to be used only on the most pressing emergency.
That emergency had now arrived (Id. viii. 15), and it was proposed to employ the money in building ships to replace the fleets which had perished at Syracuse, and so to enable Athens to carry on the war.
But the carrying on of the war was the very thing which Lysistrata and her friends were determined to pre­ vent.
And henceforth throughout the Play their main object is to hold the Acropolis in their exclusive possession, that the men may not obtain for their warlike purposes the silver in the temple of the Goddess, παρὰ τᾳ̑ σιῷ.
For the Athenian treasury was the inner cham­ ber at the back of Athene's Temple ;
though whether that temple was the Erechtheium (as the Scholiast on Plutus 1193 says, and as we should naturally expect) or the Parthenon (as the remains of the two temples have led antiquaries to believe) is a doubtful and difficult question.
See the Commentary on the passage of the Plutus.177.
ταῖς πρεσβυταις]
The older wo­ men are told off for this service.
They will form the Chorus of Women, the Somichorus of the Play.
Much confu­ sion has arisen from editors not clearly keeping before their minds the fact, that the women on the stage, Lysistrata and her friends, are all young married women, whilstthe women in the orchestra are all old women, and are constantly described as such.
Their leader is Stratyllis, whom the men are for ever taunting on account of her age.180.
πάντ’ εὖ K.T.X.]
All will go well, for on this subject also you say well.
184. Σκύθαινα]
Scythianess.
That the Scythian archers were employed to keep order in the Athenian Assemblies is plain from innumerable passages, such as Ach. 54, Eccl. 143:
see the Com­ mentary on the latter passage.
The Assembly of Women is therefore in like manner attended by Scythianesses.
And just as those rude barbarians were ridi­ culed for their habit of staring idly about them (see infra 426), so here the Scythianess is at once made to merit and receive the same rebuke.
186. τόμια]
The severed parts of the victim, over which the most solemn oaths were taken.
Bergler refers to Demosthenes against Aristocrates 79 (p. 642), where it is said that, in a trial for murder before the Areopagus, the Accuser is required to swear not any common form of oath, but στὰς ἐπὶ τῶν τομίων κάπρου (infra 202) καὶ κριοῦ (infra 189) Kat ταύρου (Aesch. Sept. 42).188. ἐν Αἰσχύλῳ]
The allusion, as the Scholiast observes, is to Septem 42, where the Messenger is describing the proceedings in the invaders' camp :
The substitution here of μηλοσφαγούσας for ταυροσφαγοῦντες, if not a mere inad­ vertence, is probably due to the double meaning of ταῦρος (infra 217) and μη̑λα (supra 155).
This mode of pledging faith was practised even in historic times.
The Hellenic army of the Anaba­ sis, and that of Ariaeus, after the battle of Cunaxa, swore to be faithful to each other σφάξαντες κάπρ
ον καὶ ταῦρ
ον καὶ λύκον Kat κριὸν εἰς ἀσπίδα βάπτοντες οἱ μὲν ‛'Ελληνες ξίφος, οἱ δὲ βάρβαροι λόγχην, Anabasis ii.
2. 9. I suppose that Lysis­ trata uses the word φασὶν because, being a woman, she would not be very familiar with the old Tragedian.191.
λευκὸν ἳππον]
The sacrifice of white horses was not an uncommon occurrence.
Blaydes refers to Hdt. vii. 113, Lucian's Scytha 2.
But in recom­ mending it here Calonice is doubtless referring to the σχῆμα συνουσίας men­ tioned in the note on 59 supra.
The " grey mare " which I have substituted for it in the translation is borrowed from the old proverb, "The grey mare is the better horse," Hudibras ii.
2. 698.
In Lysistrata's contemptuous reply ποῖ λευκὸν ἳππον, as again in 383 infra, 7roi is employed in the sense so common with ποῖον :
White horse indeed!195.
μέλαιναν κύλικα]
The cup is to be black (as so many of the Greek cups and vases are) in analogy to the black-bound shield of Aeschylus, in the lines quoted in the note on 188 supra.
And just as Calonice's proposal may have been prompted by the passage, referred to in the preceding note, from the Seventh Book of Herodotus, so Myrrhina's pro­ posal may have been prompted by the description in his Fourth Book (chap. 70) of the Scythian method of making trea­ ties ;
ἐς κύλικα μεγάλην κεραμίνην οἶνον ἐγχέαντες, they mingle with it a little of their own blood, and then after dipping their weapons into it, and making long prayers, they and their chief followers drink it off.
196.
Θάσιον]
Many passages in praise of the “dark Thasian wine ” (Θασίου μέλανος ’Αριστοφάνης Κωκάλῳ) are cited by Athenaeus i, chaps.
51, 52, 53, 56.
It was of all wines the most fragrant, see Eccl. 1119, Plutus 1021 and the Commentary there;
and hence the ex­ clamation of Lampito, ten lines below.
And possibly the wine which Achilles Tatius describes as τὸν μέλανα τὸν ἀνθοσ­ μίαν was none other than the Thasian.
Probably too its fragrance made it a special favourite with the Athenian women, for each time that Aristophanes mentions it lie places it in a woman's hand or head.197.
μὴ ᾽πιχεῖν ὓδωρ]
These words are of course added παρὰ προσδοκίαν, for the purpose of satirizing the alleged vinous propensities of the women, εἰς μέθην κωμῳδῶν τὰς γυναῖκας;
as the Scholiast says.
The expected words were neither μὴ λύειν τὴν εἰρήνην, as the Scholiast sug­ gests, nor yet καταλύειν τὸν πόλεμον as Bergler puts it, but ἀπέχεσθαι κ.τ.λ., that is, to act as Lysistrata proposed.198. φεῦ δᾶ]
This Doric ejaculation is used by both Aeschylus and Euripides in their Choral Odes, and Aristophanes probably borrowed it without much re­ gard to its meaning or to its derivation.
It is uncertain whether δᾶ is connected with Δεὺς (Ζεὺς), or with γῆ (as is asserted by the Scholiast on Agamemnon 1039, and the author of the Etym.
Magn. s.v. ἀλευάδα) ;
or whether it merely stands for δὴ, and should be written δά.
With the words ἂφατον ὡς ἐπαινίω, I can't describe to you how I approve the oath, compare Birds 428 ἂφατον ὡς φρόνιμος, I can't describe to you how sagacious he is.
And cf. infra 1080, 1148.200. ὁ κεραμὼν ὃσος]
In answer to Lysistrata's summons an attendant brings out a wine-jar and a cup, both of prodigious size.
The magnitude of the earthen jar extorts from Calonice the delighted exclamation, 0, what a big Wine-jar!
And either she, or a friend (for many with great probability transfer the next line to Myrrhina), proceeds to con­ gratulate herself on the size of the cup :
that is a cup 'twould give onejoy to handle.
202.
TOO κάπρου]
Lysistrata tells the attendant to set down the cup, and to take up the Wine-jar for the purpose of pouring out the wine.
As Bergler re­ marks, she speaks of the Jar as if it were a victim whose blood they are about to shed.
And while the Jar is being lifted she utters two lines of prayer, trusting that the Goddess of Persuasiveness and the Loving Cup will accept their sacri­ fice (as she calls the Wine) and be propitious to the women's cause.

They invoke Peitho be­ cause by her aid, as the special minister and confidante of Aphrodite (if she were not rather Aphrodite herself under an­ other aspect), they hope to persuade the men to terminate the war.
They invoke the Cup of friendship because by means of the friendly league, to which they are about to pledge themselves over the Cup of Thasian wine, they hope to inau­ gurate a reign of peace and friendship throughout the Hellenic world.
On the κύλιξ φιλοτησία see Ach. 985 and the Commentary there.
The Cup was im­ mediately before them;
and probably full in sight arose the ancient Temple of Aphrodite Pandemus and Peitho, which Theseus erected as a seal and emblem of the incorporation of all the domes of Attica into a single state, Pausanias i. 22.
3. Hence, perhaps, the word δέσποινα, like δέσποινα Νίκη infra 317, as of a present deity.
On the great throne of Zeus at Olympia Peitho was represented crowning Aphrodite new risen from the sea, Pausanias v. 11. 3.205. ἀποπυτίζει καλῶς] gushes out splen­ didly (that is,propitiously, cf. Peace 1054, Birds 1118, &c.), as of a victim's blood.
ταῦτα δὲ λέγει, says the Scholiast, μιμου­ μένη τοὺς θυοσκόους, τουτέστι τοὺς ἱερεῖς.
ταῦτα γὰρ ἐπέλεγον τοῖς θύμασιν, εὐφημίας χάριν.
The attendant is pouring the wine into the cup and the women are pressing round to see.
And one admires the deep rich colour, and another the deli­ cious fragrance (προσόξει γ᾽ἡδὺ), of the Thasian wine, whilst a third would fain be the first to pledge her oath, that is, to raise the cup to her lips.
The entire scene is intended to banter the alleged wine­ loving propensities of Athenian women.208.
λάχῃς]
Much of the humour underlying this dialogue has passed un­ noticed because annotators have failed to observe that, in the peculiar form of oath which Lysistrata is about to ad­ minister, to swear has much the same meaning as to drink.
Myrrhina's eager­ ness πρώτην ὀμνύναι arises from the cir­ cumstance that she would so obtain the first draught of wine, ἐπεὶ ἡ ὀμνύουσα πρώτη ἒμελλε Kat πρώτη πιεῖν, as the Scholiast says;
whilst the retort ἐὰν λάχῃς is due to the fact that in ancient symposia not only was the ruler of the feast, the symposiarch, the arbiterbibendi elected by lot (Horace, Odes i. 4. 18, ii. 7. 25), but sometimes also the order in which the cup was to pass from guest to guest was regulated in a similar manner;
huic si sorte bibas, sortem con­ cede priorem, Ovid, Ars. Amat. i. 581.211. ἐμπεδώσετε] confirm.
See 233 infra, where ταῦτ’ ἐμπεδοῦσα means if I make firm, that is, abide by what I have sworn, ἀσφαλῆ φαλάττουσα as the Scho­ liast explains it.
Bergler refers to Iph. Taur. 758, 790.212. οὐκἔστινκ.τ.λ.]
Lysistrata pro­ pounds the oath, Calonice repeats it after her, whilst all the other women place their bands upon the cup, so as to be participators in the ceremony ;
like the Seven Chiefs θιγγάνοντες χερσὶ
ταυρείου φóνου.216. ὑπολύεταί μοι τὰ γόνατ’]
Not, as usually, from fear, but from pleasure.
So when Penelope becomes certain, by his mention of a secret known only to those two, that the stranger is really her husband, we are told (Odyssey xxiii. 205):
0 knees that as water are weak, 0 heart's shield suddenly broken, Who save Odysseus could speak it,-the spell of the secret token ? (Way.)217. ἀταυρώτη] οἷον ἁγνὴ καὶ ἄμικτος, says the Scholiast, and again ἄζευκτος γάμου καὶ ἀζυγής.
That the Greeks saw no special coarseness in the metaphor may be inferred from its introduction by Aeschylus in his tender and beautiful description of Iphigeneia in the first Chorus of the Agamemnon.219.
κρ
οκωτοφοροῦσα]
This line is, in substance, repeated from 44 supra.221.
ἐπιτυφῇ μου] burn with love of me.
ἐπικαυθῇ καὶ πυρωθῇ ἐπ’ ἐμοί.—Scholiast.229. τὰ Περσικά]
These were common slippers worn by women and children.
περσικαὶ, ὑποδημάτ
ος εἶδος, γυναικείου.— Suidas.
εὐτελῆ ὑποδήματα.—Hesychius.
Aristophanes usually speaks of them in the plural, Clouds 151, Thesm.
734, Eccl. 319, but here employs the dual.231. ἐπὶ τυροκνήστιδος]
The τυρόκνηστις, already mentioned in the Wasps and the Birds, was used for grating cheese, silphium, and the like.
In form it was very dissimilar to one of our "graters," being a sort of knife with a bronze or ivory handle.
And on the handles of knives it was customary to carve all sorts of animal figures.
τυρόκνηστις δὲ das.
But bronze figures would be less fragile, and in the British Museum there are several specimens of Greek bronze knife-handles on which the figures of lions, hounds, and other animals are carved in every variety of posture;
some indeed couching upon the handle, but others standing upright, and touching the handle only with their feet.
And it is plain that in the τυρόκνηστις of which Lysistrata is speaking the lioness was in a standing position.
She takes the lioness so standing as representing a σχῆμα συνουσίας, the sentence being, as Brunck observes, equivalent to οὐ τετραποδηδὸν στήσομαι (Peace 896).
The grammarians say that τυρόκνηστις was a σχῆμα συνουσίας, but that seems to be an entire mistake;
the λέαινα was a σχῆμα συνουσίας;
see the lines of Machon preserved by Athenaeus xiii, chap. 39 (p. 577 D), but the addition ἐπὶ rvpo­ κνήστιδι seems merely the product of Lysistrata's too lively imagination.235.
εἰ δὲ παραβαίην]
If I abide by this, may I drink of the Thasian wine;
but if I break my oath, may the cup be filled with water instead.
A person taking an oath settled beforehand for himself what should be the reward for keeping it, and what the penalty for breaking it.
See Birds 445-7 and the Commentary there ;
and Iph. Taur. 750-2.
According to the statement in Demosthenes contra Ti­ mocr. 171 (p. 747) the dicastic oath was closed with the words ἐπόμνυμι Δία, Scholiast, Suidas.
συντελέσω καὶ καθιε­ ρώσω.—Hesychius.
Lysistrata uses the correct liturgical word which signifies to complete and consummate a sacrifice, by burning, eating or otherwise consuming (according to the ordinances applicable to each case) the remains of the conse­ crated victim.
But here, as in Plutus 681, the term is diverted to a comic meaning.
The purpose of Lysistrata is to complete the sacrifice by herself con­ suming the remains of the Thasian wine, a purpose intercepted by Calonice, who calls upon her to go shares with her friends, and so give immediate proof of their newly cemented friendship, κοινὰ γὰρ τὰ.
τῶν φίλων, see the Commentary on Plutus 345.
Possibly also the lan­ guage of Calonice is intended to convey a hint that they will not long remain friends if Lysistrata drinks all the wine herself.
The answer is repeated from Acharnians 41.244.
τασδί] ray θεραπαίνας φησί.— Scholiast.
But we have no reason to suppose that Lampito brought any at­ tendants with her ;
and even if she did, the word must also include the associates and friends who, we know, accompanied her to Athens.
These are the women who with Lysistrata, Calonice, Myrrhina, and others will henceforth hold the Acropolis, and who, at the close of the Play, will join their husbands in the reconciliation dance and song.
See infra 1274.252.
μὰ τὴν ’Αφροδίτην]
She swears by Aphrodite whom she has just forsworn.
The epithet ἄμα.χοι seems to have been applied to women as a term of reproach, resistless, people whom it is impossible to subdue.
So infra 1014 οὐδέν ἐστι θηρίον γυναικὸς ἀμαχώτε
ρον, where see the Com­ mentary.
ἄλλως, ἀντὶ τοῦ μάτην, says the Scholiast;
a very common usage.
See Peace 92 and the note there.
254.
The women retire into the Acropolis througli the Propylaea, and alter ashort pause the Chorus of old men, twelve in number, are heard slowly moving towards the orchestra, and sing­ ing their Parodos or entrance song.
Their movements are slow because they are carrying heavy logs of wood, and carefully nursing some lighted embers in their pitchers.
And for the same reason their entrance song does not, as is usually the case with such songs, consist of the quick and spirited trochaic tetrameters, but is almost entirely iambic.
They encourage one another as they go, and we learn the names of four of their number, Draces, Strymo­ dorus, Philurgus, and Laches.
And Phaedrias, we shall presently learn, was the name of a fifth, infra 356.
Draces and Strymodorus are mentioned else­ where also as names of-the members of a Chorus, Wasps 233, Eccl. 294.255. κορμοῦ] κ
ορμὸς means a section, a piece of wood chopped off a larger -piece. ἀπὸ τοῦ κείρω γίνεται κορμός.—Etym. Magn. (s. v. πορθμός).
Here the κορμὸς χλωρᾶς ἐλαίας (called πρέμνον infra 267) is a log chopped off a fresh olive-tree, like the stem of fresh olive wood, χλωρὸν, ἐλαἴνεον which the Cyclops had cut for his club, τὸ μὲν ἔκταμεν, ScOpa φοροίη, and which Odysseus likened to the mast of a 20-oared vessel, so long it was and so thick, Od. ix.
319-24.256. πόλλ’ ἄελπτ’]
They mean that if you live to be old, you will see.
many things that you never expected.
—There are two somewhatsimilar lines in a somewhat similar metre by Eupolis which I think should run as follows, not quite as they are-given by Meineke or Bothe (Fragm. Inc. 4).
The words πόλλ’ ἀέλπτως, as Florent Chretien ob­ serves, are found in the familiar tag with which Euripides closes five of his tragedies.262.
ἅγιον βρέτας]
The sacrosanct image of Athene Polias, the παλαιὸν βρέτας of Eumenides 80, the ἀρχαῖον ἄγαλ­ μα of the famous inscription relating to the repairs of the Erechtheium.
No more specific description was needed to denote this venerable statue, the image which, tradition said, fell down from heaven.
The closed and barred" Propylaea are of course immediately in front of the speaker.
κατὰ ἔχειν and κατὰ λαβεῖν are for κατέχειν and καταλαβεῖν.270.
ὑπὸ ψήφου μιᾶς]
So with regard to the successful generals after Arginusae it was determined μιᾶ ψήφῳ ᾶπαντας κρίνειν, Xen. Hell. i. 7. 37. So Eratos- thenes, one of the Thirty, is said by his venomous accuser, to have thrown, in conjunction with his colleagues, 300 citizens into prison, καὶ μιᾷ ψήφῳ αὐτῶν ἁπάντων θάνατον κατεψηφίσατο, Lysias against Eratosth.
53. These indeed were admittedly illegal acts ;
but the Chorus are not in a mood to trouble themselves about the legality of their revenge.—τὴν Λύκωνος.
It can only be by an oversight that Blaydes supposes Lysistrata herself to be meant.
The ., wife of Lycon" was Rhodia, a woman of infamous life.
τὴν ‘Ροδίαν, says the Scholiast, λέγει οὕτωκαλουμένην, πᾶς As to Lycon see the note on Wasps 1301.
His wife is to be involved, quite irrelevantly, in the general con­ flagration, just as in Frogs 588 the name of Archedemus is introduced, quite irrelevantly, into the imprecation of Dionysus.273.
Κλεομένης]
The story of Cleomenes, the flighty and half-witted (οὐ φρενήρης ἀκρομάνης τε IIdt. v. 42) King of Sparta, is told in the Fifth and Sixth Books of the History of Herodotus, and in the nine­ teenth and twentieth chapters of the Polity of Athens.
On his first expedition to Attica, he materially assisted in the ex­ pulsion of the Peisistratidae by defeating their Thessalian allies (Hdt. v. 64, 65;
Polity, chap. 19;
infra 1150-6).
The second time he went it was on the invita­ tion of Isagoras, who invoked his aid against the innovations of Cleisthenes.
On this occasion, though Cleisthenes him­ self retired at his approach, yet when he attempted to dissolve the Council, and place the supreme power in the hands of Isagoras and 300 of his partisans, the Council and People made so determined a resistance to his proposals, that he and his adherents seized and took refuge in the Acropolis.
There he was besieged with so much vigour that on the third day he was forced to capitulate, and he and his small Lacedaemonian force were allowed to evacuate Attica.
o τε Κλεο-277. ἐμοί] τῷ δήμῳ.—Scholiast.
The affair took place very nearly a century before, but the Chorus always regard themselves, and with good reason, as the identical Athenian People which fought and conquered in " the brave days of old.
”See infra 665 and the Commentary on Wasps 1071.280.
ἓξ ἐτῶν ἄλουτος]
The siege only lasted for two whole days, but that is near enough for Comedy.
And the whole description of the ignominious exit of Cleomenes and his Spartans from the Acropolis is a mere fancy picture, designed to portray in the strongest colours the contrast between their hu­ miliating retreat, and the pride and haughtiness (ὅμως Λακωνικὸν πνέων, for all their Laconian arrogance) with which they had entered Athens a few days previously.
The Lexicons and Commentators give many examples of this usage.
The Peloponnesians move out to attack Phormio ἐπὶ τεσσάρων ταξάμενοι ray vaus, Thuc. ii. 90. The Athenian armies at­ tempting to escape from Syracuse εὗρον̇ τὴν πεζὴν στρατιὰν of the enemy παρατεταγ­ μένην OVK ἐπ’ ὀλίγων ἀσπίδων, Id. vii. 79.
So when the Thirty led their troops from the city to attack Thrasybulus in Munychia ἐγένοντο βάθος οὐκἔλαττον ἢ ἐπὶ πεντήκοντα ἀσπίδων, Xen.
Hell.
ii.
4. 11. So at the battle of Leuctra οἱ θηβαῖοι οὐκ ἔλαττον ἢ ἐπὶ πεντήκοντα ἀσπίδων συνεστραμμένοι ἦσαν, Id. vi. 4. 12. "Re­ member," says Isocrates in the Archida­ mus, see. 115 (p. 136), "those who fought against the Arcadians at Dipaea οὕς φασιν ἐπὶ μιᾶς ἀσπίδ
ος παραταξαμέιους τρόπαιον στῆσαι πολλῶν μυριάδων.”
And “ Antiochus Soter," says Lucian (Zeuxis 8), (, was dismayed when he saw the opposing army, ἐς βάθος ἐπὶ τεττά
ρων καὶ εἴκοσι τεταγμένους ὁπλίτατ.”
The πύλαι at which the Athenian ranks were watch­ ing to prevent the escape of Cleomenes must have been the nine gates of the old Pelasgic wall.
Suidas (s. v. ἠπέδιζον, they levelled) cites Cleidemus [or Cleito­ demus], one of the earliest writers on the antiquarian history of Athens, as saying, apparently of the Pelasgi, ἠπέιζον τὴν ἀκρόπολιν· περιέβαλλον δὲ ἐννεάπυλον τὸ Πελασγικόν.
Bergler sup­ poses that the participle καθεύδων with which the line ends is used παρὰ προσδοκίαν for φρουρῶν or the like.
But a joke of that kind would be quite foreign to the tone of the passage.
It seems rather to mean that they watched all night as well as all day, not even re­ tiring for their necessary rest.
283.
Εὐριπίδῃ κ.τ.λ.]
"God-detested" is a very common term of abuse, and is frequently found in these Comedies, but the Chorus, having to do with women, add " Euripides-detested," μισογύνης γὰρ 6 Εὐριπίδης, as the Scholiast says, Kat πολλὰ κατ’αὐτῶν λέγων.
See the Intro­ duction to the Thesmophoriazusae, pp. xvi, xvii.
And indeed we shall find as we proceed that the Men, in their at­ tacks upon the female character, draw largely from the great magazine of misogynist maxims which the writings of Euripides supply.285.
τῇ
τετραπόλει]
Four little towns- MARATHON, Probalinthus, Tricorythus (infra 1032), and Oenoe—were from very early times grouped together as one district under the name of (not Tetrapolis, but) the Tetrapolis.
In their midst, upon the marshy plain of Mara­ thon, stood the white marble trophy which commemorated the great Victory.
See the Commentary on Wasps 711.
τρόπαιον, says the Scholiast, τὸ ἐν Μαραθῶνι, τὸ Kara Περσῶν.
ἡ γὰρ Mapa­ θὼν τῆς τετραπόλεως μέρος, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ Οἰνόη, Προβάλινθος, Τρικόρυθος.
Their ap­ peal to these heroic memories is akin to the famous Demosthenic adjuration, μὰ τοὺς Μαραθῶνι προκινδυνεύσαντας κ.τ.λ. (De Corona 263, p. 297), and to those lines of Eupolis which according to Longinus (sec. 16) were thought to con­ tain the germ (τὸ σπέρμα) of that ad­ juration :
And it was well in these dark days of tribulation and despondency that the Athenians should call to their remem­ brance the successful heroism of their ancestors ;
how when a Spartan king sought to curtail their freedom, they expelled both him and his troops with ignominy from their city ;
and how in still darker times they, single-handed, had saved all Hellas and all Europe from the supremacy of Asia.
But of my journey, he says, this little space yet remains to be traversed;
this slope which leads to the Acropolis where­ unto I am bound with all urgency.
And we must take thought how to hale (ἄμπρον, a trace) this log along without a donkey's aid.288.
τὸσιμόν] "
They are come to what they well call the σιμὸν of the Acropolis.
No other word can so well express the character of the flat slope on its western side, the only accessible approach to the citadel.
”—Bp. Words­ worth, Athens and Attica, chap. xiv.
The Scholiast seems to think that the name may have been specially appro­ priated to this flat slope (σιμὸν, ὄνομα χωρίου περὶ τὴν ἀκρόπολιν), though an­ other puts it in the alternative ἀντὶ TOU πρόσαντες, ἢ ὄνομα χωρίου;
but it is in fact freely used in reference to any rising ground.
Arrian, for example (De Ven. 17), notices the well-known fact that a hare gains an advantage over its pursuers by taking to τὰ σιμὰ καὶτὰ ἀνώμαλα,rising and uneven ground.
And so, in Alciphron's graphic descrip­ tion of a coursing adventure (iii. 9), we find the hare at once breasting and sur­ mounting TO σιμόν.289.
χὤπως ποτ’ ἐξαμπρεύσομεν]
Before ὅπως we must understand φροντιστέον, or some such expression.
ἐξαμπρεύειν strictly means " to drag along with a rope," but here it is used generally, without reference to any particular mode of carriage.
The Men are still carrying the logs and do not set them on the ground until 312 infra.
With τοῦτο, if we are to understand any particular substantive, we may supply βάρος, supra 255, or φορτίον, infra 312.
The Coryphaeus was apparently shoul­ dering two logs, τὼξύλω, though Draces had but one.293.
πῦρ] ἐν χύτρᾳ πῦρ εἶχον δι’ ἀνθρά­ κων.—Scholiast.
They fear that the fire which they have been nursing in the χύτρα, infra 297, 308, 315, will go out, just as they are nearing their journey's end.294. φῦ φῦ]
The Oxford Lexico­ graphers describe this as an exclamation of disgust, like our fie!
faugh !
but it is obviously intended to represent the sound of the old men ΦΥσώντων.
It is used in precisely the same way in Lucian's Philopatris, 2, where one speaker declares that he is quite puffed out with the nonsense he has been hearing and swallowing, and the other advises him to breathe it out;
where­ upon the first recommends him to stand some way off, lest the wind should blow him away, and then begins φῦ, φῦ, φῦ, φῦ, and his comrade rejoins, “βαβαὶ TOV ἀναφυσήματος, it has raised quite a storm at sea."
The Scholiast tells us that there was a παρεπιγραφὴ or stage-direction, φυσᾷ τῷστόματι, which I have accord­ ingly restored to its place in the text.
It is this “puffing” which blows up the smoke into the puffer's face, and occasions the ejaculation tou ἰοὺ TOV καπνοῦ.299.
Λήμνιον]
The epithet is employed here for the sake of the pun on λῆμαι.
“The fire has bitten my λήμας, it must be a Λήμνιον πῦρ.”
The reference is merely to the name, and not to anything special about " Lemnian fire."
The phrase πῦρ Λήμνιον was a common one, and is sup­ posed to have arisen from the volcano, Mosychlus, which was once active on the island, though it has now disappeared, and is believed to have been submerged in the sea.
See Tozer's " Islands of the Aegean," p. 271, and the Philoctetes of Sophocles, line 800, with Jebb's Com­ mentary and Appendix.
To the pas­ sages there collected may now be added Bacchylides xviii.
55, where Theseus is described as having a Λαμνίαν φοίνισ­ σαν φλόγα flashing from his eyes.
As to λήμη, an eyesore, see'the Commentary on Eccl. 404, Plutus 581.301. ἔβρυκε] it bit, like δάκνει three lines above.

Their " puf­ fing," by the divine blessing, has had the desired effect, and the fire, which they feared was going out, is now burn­ ing brightly again.308.

They are now preparing for an immediate assault.
They lay on the ground the heavy logs which they have been carry­ ing on their shoulders, and place the lighted tapers in the pots ready for use.
But before they actually set fire to the logs, they will make a strenuous rush at the central door of the Propylaea and try to burst it open, as if with a batter­ ing ram.
And it is only if the women will not admit them on their summons (καλούντων), that they will burn down the doors (θύρας, there were five in all) of the Propylaea, and smother the de­ fenders.
However, as we shall see, they never actually reach the entrance.
Of course they could not, having to re­ main in the orchestra.
ρουσιν οἱβάρβαροι.—Scholiast.
Who are the βάρβαροι ?
If the writer is an Alexandrian in the days of the Ptole­ mies, he means the Romans:
if a Byzantine after the fall of Rome, he must mean some of the Northern In­ vaders.313.
τῶνἐν Σάμῳστρατηγῶν]
During all this period of the War, Samos was the permanent head-quarters of the Athenian armaments ;
and the leaders of the Army and Navy there were always ready to lend a hand, ξυλλαμβάνειν, to one party or the other in the City.
They were now entering upon those strange and tangled intrigues in connexion with the return of Alcibiades, which form the central picture of the Eighth Book of Thucydides, and resulted first in the overthrow, and then in the re-establishment of the democratical government.
The Men hope to find them equally ready to lend a hand for the purpose of suppressing the revolu­ tionary movement of the Women.317.
δέσποινα Νίκη]
As they are (sup­ posed to be) approaching the Acropolis, they have full in view the Temple of the Wingless Victory, otherwise Athene Nike.
It stood at the right of the Propylaea, on what may be called a bastion of the Cimonian wall;

Lethaby's Greek Buildings, pp. 151-8.
To Her therefore the Men make their appeal that she will grant them (δὸς is understood) the victory over the auda­ cious women who are (ἐν πόλει) holding the Acropolis against them.
319.
λιγνὺνκ.τ.λ.]
The Men have con­ cluded their laborious entrance song and are busying themselves with their hostile preparations.
And now the voices of the twelve choreutae who form the Women's Chorus are heard in the distance, though the singers themselves are not yet visible.
They have learned that the Men are threatening to destroy the Acropolis and its defenders in one common conflagration, and have been filling their pitchers at the fountain for the purpose of extinguishing the flame.
They cannot yet see the Men, but they can see the fiery vapour (λιγνὺς Birds 1241, Thesm.
281) and smoke as­ cending from the fires which their ad­ versaries have been blowing into a blaze.
The quicker movement of the Women is indicated by the lighter and more trip­ pingmetre, chiefly choriambic, and the al­ most idyllic character, of their entrance song.
In the first two lines an iambic dipody is succeeded by two choriambs and one amphibrach or bacchic foot.
321.
Νικοδίκη]
Nicodice is a member of the Women's Chorus.
Calyce and Critylla are two of Lysistrata's friends now forming the garrison of the Acro­ polis.
The latter name reappears in the Thesmophoriazusae.327.
νῦν δή]
Just now.
ἀρτίως.—Scho­ liast.
See the note on Peace 5.328.
ἀπὸ κρήνης]
Aristophanes is evi­ dently depicting a scene of daily occur­ rence at Athens, when the women came in the dusk of the morning (κνεφαία) to fill their pitchers at the fountain-head.
He must therefore be alluding to some particular fountain, which Wordsworth (Athens and Attica, chap. xii), Bothe, Blaydes, and others suppose to have been the Clepsydra, but which is by Dyer (Ancient Athens, p. 445) and others identified, no doubt correctly, with the great reservoir known as the Ennea­ crounos.
For the Clepsydra was an in­ termittent and comparatively small spring of brackish water issuing from the side of the Acropolis (see infra 913) and somewhat difficult of access.
It could not have been the habitual resort of women coming to draw water for their daily necessities.
But the Ennea­ crounos was the great water-supply of the district, and would naturally be surrounded in the morning by a bustling and excited throng.
Its exact position is a matter of dispute ;
but we know from Thucydides (ii. 15) that it was in the immediate vicinity of the Acropolis, which is sufficient for our present pur­ pose.
The historian tells us that its water was specially used πρὸ γαμικῶν (cf. Pollux iii. 43);
and it is to this circumstance that the Chorus are sup­ posed to allude when they threaten the men (infra 378) with a λουτρὸν νυμφικόν.
It must be remembered that although the Chorus originally seized the Acro­ polis (supra 179, 241), yet throughout all the subsequent action of the Play they are always in the lower City, and never inside the Acropolis.330-4.
δούλῃσιν ... βοηθῶ]
It ap­ pears from the anti strophe that a line composed of two choriambs or their equivalent is missing from this part of the Parodos, but we have no means of ascertaining where it should be supplied or what it should be.337.
ὥσπερ βαλανεύσονας] ὥσπερ βαλα­ νεῖον ὑποκαύσοντας.—Scholiast.
As to the fire in the public baths see Plutus 535, 952 and the Commentary there.345.
σὰς ἕδρας] τὸν ναόν σου κατέλαβον. —Scholiast.
They mean the Acropolis itself and not any particular Temple.
For the Acropolis, though full of innu­ merable shrines to other Gods, was so dominated by the triple presentment of Athene, as the Πολιὰς, the Παρθένος, and the Πρόμαχος, that it might well be called, as here, Athene's dwelling-place, and, as in the Plutus, Παλλάδος πέδοτ.
The name Πολιοῦχος is equivalent to the more special name Πολιὰς, and is even more frequently employed by the Poets.
See Birds 827, 828 and the Commentary there.
On the other hand the epithet χρυσόλοφοςcan apply only to the Παρθέ­ νος, for she alone had a helmet of gold :
and the Power invoked as the ξύμμαχ
ος is probably the Πρόμαχος, the Champion of the Athenian Acropolis.
See the Commentary on Knights 1169, and Thesm.
1138. And cf. infra 483 and 775, where the entire Acropolis is called a ἱερὸν τέμενος, a ἱερὸς ναός.350. tout! τίἦν;

The Men have wheeled round so as to confront their approaching opponents.
In the phrase πόνῳ πονηροὶ, the πόνῳ is merely in­ tensive;

Knights 224 and the note there.
I have removed the note of interroga­ tion with which the line is usually closed, but which seems to give a wrong sense.
The Women are speaking ironi­ cally ;
You surely do not think there are mally of its.357.
περικατᾶξαι τὸ ξύλον] to break the stick about their backs.358.
κάλπιδας] the ewers;

The vessel was called ὑδρία supra 327.361.
Βουπάλου] εἴτις ἠπείλησε τύπτειν, καθάπερ‛Ιππῶναξ τὸν Βούπαλον.—Scho­ liast.
Bupalus and his brother Anther­ mus were two celebrated Chian sculp­ tors, and the allusion here is to the lampoons with which they were assailed by the ugly little Ephesian poet, Hip­ ponax, for reproducing, and indeed caricaturing, in some of their works, his own repulsive physiognomy.
For as Pliny says, xxxvi. 4 (2) (I quote from Holland's translation), " the said Poet had a passing foule and ill-favoured face of his own;
and these Imageurs could find no better sport than to counter­ feit both him and his visage as lively as possibly might be in stone, and in a knavery to set the same up in open place, where mery youths met in knots together and so to propose him as a laughing-stock to the whole world.
Hipponax could not indure this indig­ nitic, but for to be revenged upon these companions, sharpened his style or pen against them, and so coursed them with bitter rimes and biting libels that as some do thinke and verily beleeve, being weary of their lives, they knit their necks in halters, and so hanged them­ selves.
But sure this cannot be true, for they lived many a faire day after, yea and wrought a number of Images in the Islands adjacent to Chios, and namely in Delos ;
under which pieces of their worke they subscribed certain arrogant verses to this effect
That the Island of Chios was not only enobled for the vines there growing which yeelded so good wine ;
but renowned as well for Anthermus his two sons, who made so many fine and curious images."
One line of these libels has come down to us λάβετέ μου θαἰμάτια, κόψω Βουπάλου τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν, to which Bergk joins an­ other fragment ἀμφιδέιος γάρ εἰμι, KOVX ἁμαρτάνω, κόπτων (Fragment 83 in his Poetae Lyrici Graeci).
The description of Hipponax in the Epodes of Horace as the " acer hostis Bupalo " is known to all.362.
καὶ μὴν ἰδού]
This is a defiance;
an invitation to the opponent to " come on," she is ready for him.

By παρέξω she means I will offer my cheek to your blow ;
I won't withdraw myself;
you may strike me if you like.
But if you do, she adds in a fury, " nun­ quam alius canis potent tibi prehendere ore testiculos;
nam ego, ut canis, prius eos evellam," Bergler.
The last four words of the speech are uttered παρὰ προσδοκίαν.364. ἀκκοκκιω̑]
"At, ni faces, dispul verabo iam tuam senectam.”—Florent Chretien.
ἐκκοκκίζειν properly means "to pick out the seeds, κόκκους, of the pomegranate," ἡ μεταφορὰ ἀπὸ τω̑ν ῥοιω̑ν, as the Scholiast says.
Thence it comes to mean generally to rifle, to empty, and so to destroy, to smash, as here.
We meet with the word again infra 448, Ach. 1179, Peace 63.
The words τὸ γη̑ράς σου are merely a periphrasis for "you."
He is addressing Stratyllis, the leader, and apparently the oldest member, of the Women's Chorus who were all elderly women.
See the Commentary on 179 supra.
The line which follows is of course spoken by another member of the Chorus.367.
βρύκουσα ... ἀξαμήσω]
I will tear out (literally, reap out) with my teeth.
For βρύκω see 301 supra;
and with ἐξα­ μάω in this sense Bergler refers to Eur.
Cyclops 236 τὰ σπλάγχν ἄφασκον ἀξαμή­ σεσθαι βία̣.369. θρέμμ’ ἀναιδές]
Strange to say, this phrase is found not in the Plays of Euripides (or, at least not in any of his extant Plays), but in the Electra of Sophocles where (line 622) Clytaem­ nestra addresses it to her daughter.
But the idea contained in the phrase is thoroughly Euripidean, and possibly the words themselves may have oc­ curred in one of his non - existent Tragedies.370. αἰρώμεθ’]
Taken aback by the des­ perate language of the women, the Men for the moment relinquish the idea of assaulting Stratyllis and her comrades, and turn their attention to the fire.
The women therefore again take up the ewers they had set down, supra 358, in anticipation of an immediate attack.
But their action has reminded the men of the water which the women are carrying, and a new altercation breaks out on this subject which speedily brings matters to a crisis.
The reader will ob­ serve the greater rapidity of the present squabble.
The speeches are never more than a line long, and are often only half that length.372.
ὦ τύμβε]
We have seen that the Coryphaeus of the Men's Chorus was impolite enough to taunt Stratyllis with her age.
But the Men are no younger than the Women, and now Stratyllis returns the taunt by calling her oppo­ nent a τύμβος, a mocking appellation of an old man.
Euripides makes Creon call himself (Medea 1209), and the Argive herald call Iolaus (Heracleidae 167), a γέροντα τύμβον.377.
ῥύμμα] soap, from ῥύμτω ;
Achar­ nians 17 ;
TO παρ’ ἡμȋν σμη̑γμα ἢ νίτρον, says the Scholiast.
If the Men have the soap, the Women have the water wherewith to give them a bath.
And that too a λουτρὸν νυμφικὸν, they add ;
a phrase supposed to imply that the water had been drawn, as no doubt it had been, from the Enneacrounos.
See the Commentary on 328 supra.
Pollux (iii. 43) after observing that the water for the wedding bath was at Athens drawn from the Enneacrounos, but in other cities from any chance fountain, adds ἐκαλεȋτο δὲ ταυ̑τα, νυμφικὰ λουτρά.381. ὦ ’χελῳ̑ε]
Achelous was the largest Hellenic river, and from its name all fresh water was sometimes called Achelous.
ὁ παλαιὸς λόγος πάνυ τὸν Ἀχε­ λῳ̑ον σεμνύνει, says Eustathius (on Iliad xxi. 194), ὡς καὶ 7rav ὕδωρ ἐξ αὐτου̑ Ἀχε­ λῳ̑ον κληθη̑ναι.
And again, ὅθεν Ἀχελῳ̑ος, φησὶ, πα̑ν πηγαȋον ὕδωρ.
Bergler refers to Eur.
Bacchae 625, where Pentheus, thinking that his palace is on fire, runs hither and thither δμωσὶν Ἀχελῳ̑ον φέρειν | ἐννέπων, and to a line (preserved in Athenaeus x. 29, p. 427 C) from a satyric drama of Achaeus, where the Satyrs are grumbling over the weakness of their wine, and asking if it is not largely diluted with water, (The question requires an affirmative answer, and I have inserted οὐto com­ plete both the sense and the metre.

But far from making him blossom into youth again, the extreme chilliness of the water makes him shiver to such an extent that he withers away (αὖός εἰμι) like a dead plant.
The Women recommend him to dry himself and his clothes by the fire which he had brought for a very different purpose.

ΠΡΟΒΟΥΛΟ∑]
Intelligence of the seizure of the Acropolis and of the dis­ turbance in front of the Propylaea has reached the City Magistrates, and a dignified personage, attended by four Scythian policemen, now makes his appearance on the scene.
He is one of the Πρόβουλοι elected immediately after the Sicilian catastrophe to provide for the safety of Athens, Thuc. viii.
I;
Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 29.
This important magistrate, arriving to quell the tumult, finds that the chief disturbers of the peace are a parcel of excited women, and naturally concludes that they are engaged in one of those wild religious orgies, mostly imported from Phrygia and the East, in which Hellenic women were accustomed occa­ sionally to indulge.
The word τρυφὴ) (properly voluptuousness is employed in much the same sense as ἀκολασία, wantonness, with which Plato couples it in Gorgias 46 (p. 492 C).
As to τυμπα­ νισμὸς, the timbrel-playing, see line 3 of this Play;
and as to Sabazius, the Phrygian Dionysus, Wasps 9.389. ὅτ’ Ἀδωνιασμός]
The wailing for Adonis, the Adonis-dirge.
The Ἀδώνια (Peace 420) was celebrated only by women, and lasted for two days;
one day commemorating the happy wedded love of Adonis and Aphrodite;
the other, her mourning over his untimely death.
The ceremonies are graphically and learnedly described by Thomas Stanley in his " Excitations on Bion ” (published 1651, reprinted in 1821);
and probably the best idea of the Adonis-dirge is to be derived from Bion's Idyll, written more than a century after the exhibition of this Play ;
a beautiful presentation of which by the Hon.
E. J. Cardew will be found at the close of this Commentary.
The manner in which the women wailed for Adonis is shown by Lucian, De Syria Dea G.
That these ill-omened dirges and lamentations did really attend the dispatch of the, fleet to Sicily we are told by Plutarch (Nicias 13, Alcibiades 18).
Demostratus, he says, proposed that the generals should have absolute discretion as to the preparations for the expedition and as to the whole conduct of the War.
And when the people so voted and all things were now ready, many ill omens occurred.
For the women were holding the Adonia, and everywhere about the City mimic funerals of Adonis were going on, and the dirges of weeping women.
And not a few thought that these things were a presage of the fate of the expedition which was then setting forth with such splendid promise and vigour.
And again in Nicias 12 he men­ tions Demostratus as the demagogue most eager for the war.
Adonis was the Phoenician Thammuz, and his worship was one of the idolatries into which the Israelites were so prone to fall.
See Baring Gould's " Curious Myths " under the title " St. George."
These acts of worship were commonly performed on the flat tops of the houses.
See Jere­ miah xix.
I'a, xxxii. 29, and Zepha­ niah i. 5.
"They worshipped on the house-tops," says Dr. Pusey on the last- mentioned passage, " probably to have a clear view of that magnificent ex­ panse of sky, the moon and stars which God had ordained;
the queen of heaven which they worshipped instead of Him­ self."
Moreover, the house-top was the recognized place for wailing and lamentation.
See Isaiah xv. 3, xxii. 1, and Jeremiah xlviii. 38.391. μὴ] ὥρασι] bad luck to him, a parenthetical imprecation.
The full phrase, as Bergler remarks, is μὴ ὥρασιν ἵκοιτο.
See infra 1037.
Athenaeus ii. 45 cites some lines from Alexis where a speaker says III fare the man who ate the lupines (μὴ ὥρασιν ... ἵκοιθ’ o τοὺς θέρμους φαγὼν) and threw down the husks in the porch.
'Twas not Cleaenetus the Tragic poet, of that I am sure, for he would have eaten husks and all.
In his note on that passage Casaubon refers to three places in Lucian in which the phrase occurs, two of which I had myself marked for quotation.
In the sixth Dialogue of the Gods, Hera re­ ferring to Ixion's passion for herself exclaims μὴ ὥρασιν ἵκοιτοτω̑ν ὺπὲρ αὺτὸν ἐπιθυμω̑ν, A murrain on the fellow, de­ siring what is far above him.
In the De Saltatione, 5, Craton says Hang me if I would stand that, μὴ ὥρασιν ἄρα ἱκοίμην, εἴ τι τοιου̑τον ἀνασχοίμην ποτέ.
And in the tenth Courtesan-Dialogue a girl says of a philosopher who is weaning her lover from her, μὴ ὥρασιν ἵ κοιτ’ὸ λη̑ροςἐκεȋνος τοιαυ̑τα παιδεύων τὸ μειράκιον.
The literal meaning of the phrase seems to be may he come in a bad time (not in season), and so, may he come to bad luck.
A simi­ lar idea finds expression in many modern languages.
Andad con Di6s y mucho de enhoramala says
Sancho the governor to the detected virago in Don Quixote, Part II, chap.
45. This was no doubt the original form of the phrase, though in Menander's time it had become cor­ rupted into μὴ ὥρας (see his Περικειρομένη 201, ed. Capps);
and a scholiast on Lucian has the impertinence to call the genuine form an Attic solecism.
But Lucian knew better than his Scholiast.392. ἡ γυνή]
He has not actually men­ tioned any individual woman ;
but lie uses the article to denote the woman whom he was picturing in his mind when he spoke of the Adonis-wailing on the roof.394. καταλέγειν] to enroll, to call out for immediate service.
See Ach. 1065, Knights 1369, and the Commentary on those passages.
He proposed, the speaker means, that Zacynthian hoplites should be enrolled amongst the troops about to embark on the Sicilian expedition.
And that his resolution was carried we may infer from the fact that Thucydides (vii. 57), in his enumeration of the forces engaged on each side before Syracuse, expressly mentions the Zacynthians as part of the Athenian armament.396.
ἐβιάζετο] persisted, pressed it on, in spite of all opposition.
So in his speech against Meidias 50 (p. 527)
Demosthenes says to the dicasts, “ Do not suffer my adversary to use such arguments as these ;
and if he persists, av βιάζηται, do not pay any attention to them."
See also section 240 (p. 575) of the same speech.
Κόπτεσθ’ Ἄδωνιν Bewail Adonis, beat your breasts for Adon is;
a very common signification of κόπτεσθαι.397.
Χολοζύγης]
This is a perversion of the nickname Βουζύγης by which Demostratus was known.
Δημόστρατος Βουζύγης ἀδικούμενος ;
”—Scholiast.
There is another fragment of Eupolis in which the name Βουζύγης is found (Fragm. 7 of the Demi according to Meineke);
but there the epithet is possibly applied to Pericles.
Βουζύγης was the name of an Eleusinian official;
and how it came to be given as a nickname to Demo­ stratus we are not told, but the fact must have been well known for Aristo­ phanes to convert it in this offhand way into Χολοζύγης.
The latter name pro­ bably refers to the furious temper (χόλος, wrath) which made Eupolis describe him as a maniac.
Bergler suggests that he may have been a Χολαργεὺς by deme.403.
TOP ἁλυκόν] τὸν θαλάσσιον.—Scho­ liast.
The Magistrate is engaged in refitting the navy, and his mind is full of ships and seas.
When therefore he swears by Poseidon, he wishes it to be understood that he means not τὸν ̔́Ιππιον, the Lord of horses (Knights 551, Clouds 83), or the like, but TOV ἁλυκὸν, the Lord of the salt sea-waves.
Cf. Plutus 396.407. ἐν τω̑ν δημιουργω̑ν] in (the shops of) the artificers.
He mentions two shops, a goldsmith's and a shoemaker's.408.
τὸν ὅρμον] the necklace.
The Scholiast says τὸν ὅρμον ἀντὶ του̑ ὅρμου Ἀττικω̑ς, meaning that the proper con­ struction would be ἡ βάλανος TOV ὅρμου ἐκπέπτωκεν ἐκ του̑ τρήματος.
The words τὸν ὅρμον are in fact the Independent Accusative, though not quite of the same class as those considered in the notes on Birds 167, 483, 652, and else­ where, since they do not stand for the subject of the ensuing verb.
They resemble rather the words " this reve­ rend holy friar" in the passage cited in the note on Eccl. 583 from Romeo and Juliet iv.
2. Necklaces were com­ monly made of gold.
In Odyssey xv. 459 Eumaeus, explaining how he was kidnapped when a child, says ἤλυθ’ ἀνὴρ πολύïδρις ἐμου̑ πρὸς δώματα πατρὸς | χρύσεον ὅρμον ἔχων.
In the Choephoroe 606 we are told that Scylla slew her father χρυσεοδμήτοισιν ὅρμοις πεισθεȋσα.
And the Electra of Euripides (line 176) says ούκ ἐπ’ ἀγλαἴαις, φίλαι, I θυμὸν, οὐδ’ ἐπὶ χρυσέοις I ὅρμοισιν πεπόταμαι.
The βάλανος and the τρη̑μα together form the clasp of the necklace;
the βάλανος being the bolt or pin, and the τρη̑μα the hole into which the bolt or pin is fastened.
The words are here employed in their literal sense only.
The speaker is merely emphasizing the manner in which wives are spoiled and petted by their husbands.
412.
πρὸς ἑσπέραν]
The time for lovers' meetings.
See Plutus 998 and the note there.
Here βάλανος means the “ glans penis."
See Aristotle, H. A. i. 10. 3.417. τὸ ζυγόν]
The sandal-strap, a strap passing from one side of the sole to the other, over the wearer's toes, so as to keep them firm in their place, ζυγὸς δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν σανδαλιων.
—Suidas, Photius, Hesychius. τοῦ σανδαλίου τὸ συνέχον τοὺς δακτύλους.—Photius, Pollux vii. 81. δακ­ τυλίδιον is the diminutive of affection.
See the Commentary on Ach. 404.421.
πρόβουλος]
The πρóβουλοι were appointed, says the Scholiast, to devise and propose such measures as they con­ sidered advantageous for the State after the Sicilian catastrophe ;
εἰσηγησόμενοι Σικελίᾳ συμΦοράν.
And it is plain from the present scene that their jurisdiction extended over all the affairs of the State.
Mr. Grote indeed (chap. 61) does not think it admissible to draw any inference as to their functions from the proceedings of the Probulus in this Comedy.
He gives no reason for this extraordinary statement;
and it is clear that, making allowance for caricature, there could not be a higher authority than Aristophanes, himself living at this very moment under the actual rule of the Probuli, and addressing his fellow citizens, all living under the same rule.422.
κωπῆς] οαϒ-spars, timber for oars.
κωπεῖς· τὰ εἰς κώπας εὔθετα ξύλα.—Hesy­ chius.
The first resolve of the Athenians on learning the full magnitude of their disaster before Syracuse was that, not­ withstanding the annihilation of their fleets and armies there, they would not give in, but would equip a new fleet, collecting from every possible source timber and money for that purpose ;
σαμένους καὶ χρήματα (Thuc. viii. 1).
And this design they at once proceeded to carry into effect.
(Id. viii. 4).
And shortly afterwards they determined to resort to the special emergency fund of 1,000 talents (Id. viii. 15), which at the commencement of the War they had set aside ὰπὸ τῶν ἐν νῇ ἀκροπόλει Χρημάτων (Id. ii. 24).
[It will be observed that in Thucydides the word employed is ξυμπορισάμενοι, and in Aristophanes ἐκπορίσας, both terms of finance con­ nected with the duties of the πορισταὶ, as to whom see the Commentary on Frogs 1505.]
In pursuance of these re­ solutions, the Πρόβουλος here is super­ intending the purchase of ξύλα εὔθετα εἰς κώπας, and is now proceeding to the Acropolis to obtain the money to pay for them.
For the money, as we know, was in the public treasury παρὰ τῇ θεῷ, in the ὀπισθόδομος of Athene's Temple ;
that is, according to the Scholiast on Plutus 1193, in the Erechtheium (which would seem, a priori, the most probable locality), but in the opinion of most scholars, the Parthenon;
see the Com­ mentary on the Plutus.
And one of the reasons for which the women had seized the Acropolis was to prevent the em­ ployment of the money for the pro­ longation of the War.
See supra 174-9, and infra 487, 488, and 624.
And so, when the Πρόβουλος would go to the Treasury, he finds himself, to his sur­ prise and indignation, barricaded out of the Acropolis by the extraordinary action of the women.
It was always a task of some difficulty with the Athe­ nians to obtain a sufficient supply of timber for their shipbuilding purposes ;
and one of the objects which they hoped to secure by extending their dominion over Sicily and Magna Graecia was a never-failing supply of timber from the forests of Italy.
And Andocides, in his speech "De Reditu suo" 11, declares that in the year 411, the very year in which this Comedy was acted, he was bringing for the use of the armament at Samos a cargo of cheap oar-spars, κωπέας, the very articles which the Πρόβουλ
ος here attempting to provide.
There was therefore at this moment a very pressing need for the money, and the phrase τἀργυρίου vυνὶ δέον (δέον for δέοντος, as the Scholiast says) expresses the true posi­ tion of affairs at this conjuncture.426. τί κέχηνας;
]
This is addressed to one of the four Scythians, and the question ποῖ δ' αὖ σὺβλέπεις to another of them ;
just as Lysistrata, supra 184, reprimands the Scythianess with the words ποῖ βλέπεις ;
Doubtless the Scy­ thian police were in the habit of staring idly about them, "star-gazing" we might call it.
And as the Scythians were notorious for hard drinking, they would naturally be accustomed to have "an eye for the tavern."430.
μηδὲν ἐκμοχλεύετε]
The gates are thrown open, and Lysistrata of her own free-will (αὐτομάτη) comes forth with her friends, before the Scythians can make use of their crowbars.
These, it must be remembered, are not the party who seized the Acropolis, and who now form the Chorus of Women;
they are the young matrons who entered into the Acropolis with Lysistrata, supra 244-6.
The Probulus is not minded to stand any nonsense from these recalcitrant women.
He at once directs an archer to arrest Lysistrata and to tie her hands behind her back.
But this is not so simple a task as he imagines.435. νὴ τὴν"Αρτεμιν]
We have seen in the note to Thesm.
517 that Artemis was one of the divinities most commonly invoked by Athenian women.
It will be observed that these four little defiant speeches by women all commence with a similar adjuration ;
εἴ τἄρα 111) TT] II " Apn- J1.III, Eï rapa vrj TT]II IIállC5po(TOII, EÎ. TčJ.pa liT] rfjv èpCJ)f]'cpÓpOIl, and εἴτἄρα νὴ τὴν Ταυροπό­ λοv, and I believe that these appellations are all intended to represent the same Goddess, the "many-named" daughter of Leto, Thesm.
320. Ταυροπόλ
ος was of course one of her many names;
Tavpo­ πóλον· τὴν " Αρτεμιν, says Photius;
the Artemis whose minister Iphigeneia was when in the Tauric Chersonese.
And as to τὴν Φωσφόραν the Scholiast says τὴν And indeed Iphigeneia (in Taur. 21) expressly refers to Artemis as Τῇ φωσφό­ ρῳ θεᾷ;
just as Athene, at the end of the same play, 1456, prophecies"Αρτεμιν δέ νιν βροτοὶ | τὸλοιπὸν ὑμνήσουσι Tavpo­ πόλον θεάν.
There remains only the name Πάνδροσος, which will be dealt with in a subsequent note.
But allow­ ing that the selfsame Goddess is invoked in all the four speeches, who are the speakers that invoke her ?
The Ravenna MS.
gives the first speech to Lysistrata, and the remaining three to Stratyllis.
This arrangement prevailed in all the editions before Portus, who assigned them to Lysistrata and Stratyllis alternately, and so all subsequent editions until after Dindorf.
But Dobree pointed out that there are certainly four Scythians and four speakers;
and this view was approved by Dindorf in his notes, and is generally adopted by later editors.
Dindorf suggested that the four speeches should be ascribed to Λυσιστράτη and Γυναῖκες 1, 2, 3 ;
and this has been done by all editors who have adopted Do­ bree's view excepting Van Leeuwen, who thinks fit to call the last three speakers Γρᾶες 1, 2, 3 ;
not having, it would seem, observed that all the elderly women are in the orchestra with Stratyllis, and that Lysistrata's comrades now issuing from the Acropolis on to the stage are all youthful matrons who could not by any conceivable stretch of language be called γρᾶες.
Dobree suggested that one of the women might be Myrrhina, and Bergk that another might be Calonice ;
and in my translation, published in 1878, I called the three women Calonice, Myrrhina, and Stratyllis.
This arrange­ ment I have retained in the text, for it seems absurd to suppose that Calonice and Myrrhina who were Lysistrata's chief friends and adherents in starting the revolution should not be standing by her at this critical moment.
My only doubt has been about the name of Stratyllis, who was the leader of the Women's Chorus and whose speeches should therefore, according to the arrangement adopted in this edition, be attributed to the χορὸς γυναικῶν.
But the use of her name as a dramatis per­ sona is so persistently supported by the MSS.
that I cannot but retain it.
And possibly, not being the real Coryphaeus of the Play, she may be allowed a greater individuality.
See Professor John Williams
White's article in the " Harvard Studies in Classical Philology," xvii. 103 on "
An unrecognized actor in Greek Comedy."436. δημόσιος] a mere public servant, "publicus minister," as Bergler and Enger rightly interpret it.
Brunck's notion that δημόισιος, both here and in Knights 1135, signifies a victim set apart for public sacrifice, and so is equivalent, as a term of abuse, to κáθαρμα and φαρ­ μακὸς seems to me altogether unfounded.
ἄκραν χεῖρα here, and seven lines below, means the tip of his finger.
Cf. Iph. in Aul. 951.438.
Kat σὺ μετὰ τούτου]
As Lysistrata defies the archer first told off to arrest her, the Πρόβουλος calls for a second to assist him in effecting the arrest.439. νὴ τὴν Πάνδροσον] θυγατέρες Κέ­ κροπος Πάνδρ
οσος καὶ'Αγραύλη (strictly "Αγραυλοy).
—Scholiast.
Although Πάν δροσ
ος was not so frequently invoked at Athens as her sister "Αγραυλος (see Thesm.
533 and the Commentary there), still nothing can be more natural than that these defenders of the Acropolis should be found invoking Pandrosus, whose shrine was in the Erechtheium, the most sacrosanct building in the Acropolis, hard by the shrine of Athene herself;
τῷ vat τῆς 'Αθηνᾶς Πανδρόσου ναὸς συνεχής ἐστιν, Pausanias i. 27.
3. And yet, since in every other speech throughout this short altercation the Women invoke Artemis in one or other of her characters, I cannot but believe that in this invocation also the name of Πáνδροσος, the All-bedewer, is intended to apply to Artemis as identical with Hecate or the Moon.
See on 435 supra.
That dew falls mostly under a cloud­ less sky was a fact well known to the ancients ;
οὐ γίνεται δρόσος, ὄντωνἐπινε­ φέλων, Aristotle, Problems xxv. 21;
" ncque in nube, neque in flatu cadunt rores," Pliny, N. H. xviii. 69.
And they naturally attributed the phenomenon to the influence of the Moon ;
δροσοβολεῖ γὰρ [6 ἀὴρ], says Plutarch, Symp. iii. τηρ ἒρσα τρέφει καὶ Σελάνας."
Virgil's ros­ cida Luna, Georgic iii. 337, might serve as a translation of Πáνδροσ ος Σελὴνη, and Artemis, as the Scholiast on 443 infra tells us, is τῇ Σελήνῃ ἡ αὐτή.
And in an astronomical fragment contained in Burmann's Latin Anthology ii.
322 the writer, supposed though for no very convincing reasons to be Sisebut the scholarly King of the Visigoths, says " Rorifluam sectemur carmine Lunam."
The phrase which follows ἐπιχεσεῖ πατού­ μενος has already occurred in Knights 69;
but there it is fitly placed in the mouth of a slave;
here the Πρόβουλ
ος expresses his surprise at hearing it from the lips of a woman.444.
κύαθον] a cupping-glass.
You will want a cupping-glass to reduce the swellings which our blows will occasion.
κύαθον αἰτήσεις, says the Scholiast, ῖνα In Peace 542 the Hellenic cities, bruised and battered (ὑπωπιασμέναι) by the war, are described as κυάθοις προσκείμεναι, and Athenaeus (x. 23, p. 424 B) com­ menting on that passage observes τα .445.
ποῦ τοξότης]
This is the fourth and last archer.
By τῆς ἐξόδου the Magis­ trate means the sallying out of the women through the Propylaea.
But if the following speech is rightly attributed to Stratyllis, this archer is stayed not by a fourth woman issuing from the Acropolis, but by the threatening voice and gesture of the leader of the Women Chorus in the orchestra.449.
ἐπιλέλοιφ'] has failed me, deficit.
Cf. Plutarch's Lysander, chap. 9, ad init.
And I think that Dobree's explanation of the line is right, " exclamat Probulus deficere lictores sibi (ἐπιλείψουσι Vesp. 1445)," or in other words that ὁτοξότης here has much the same meaning as τὸ τοξικὸν infra 462.
He means that his archer force has been used up and that be has no more to send.
But though they have been worsted singly, he will now try what the combined charge of the four can accomplish.454.
λόχοι]
To the combined charge of the four archers Lysistrata will oppose four troops of fully armed women who are even now waiting (ἔνδον) in the Acro­ polis.
λόχος is a very common word for a troop ;
and there is no allusion here, as the Scholiast and Commentators sup­ pose, to the Spartan λόχοι. Aristophanes has already employed the term in Ach.
575, 1074, Birds 589.
And it is fre­ quently found in Aeschylus, who indeed uses it on three occasions of a band of women ;
ἴδετε παρθένων ἱκέσιον λόχον, Septem 106. θαυμαστὸς λόχος I εὔδει γυναικῶν, Eum. 46. εὐκλεὴς λόχ
ος | παίδων, γυναικῶν, Id. 980.456. ὦ ξύμμαχοι γυναῖκες]
She is sum­ moning, not of course the Women Chorus in the orchestra, but those who had entered along with Calonice, Myrrhina, and herself into the Acropolis, including the τασδὶ of line 244.
The next line is rendered with sufficient accuracy by Brunck, O quae in foro semi­ na, ova, et olera vend itis.
We shall hear, infra 562, of a woman selling λέκιθοι in the agora;
see also Plutus 427 and the Commentary on both those passages.
λέκιθος means the yolk of an egg or an omelet made of eggs.
σπερμαγοραιο­ means seed sold in the agora, market-seeds.
Van Leeuwen's contention that these syllables describe the women "gens foro innutrita " can hardly be serious.
459.
οὐχ ἕλξετ’] ἕλκειν is a wrestling term.
Will ye not grapple with them ?
will ye not hale them along ?461.
παύσασθ’]
The women, issuing from the Acropolis, fall upon the four Scythian archers, and defeat them with great slaughter.
They are then recalled by Lysistrata, who forbids them to strip the slain.462.
τὸ τοξικόν] the archer-force, or, as Sir Walter Scott describes them in the Lady of the Lake, the archery.
Forth from the pass in tumult driven, Like chaff before the wind of heaven, The archery appear. vi. 17 (cf. Id. v. 25).465. χολήν]
The ancients, associating the liver as well with the sensation of thirst as with the passion of anger, em­ ployed the word χολὴν, bile, in connexion with either idea.
Lysistrata uses the word in the sense of anger (Wasps 403, Thesm.
468;
compare Horace's fervens difficili bile tumet iecur, and again meum ieci' urere bilis).
The Magistrate, for the purpose of twitting the women on their supposed infirmity in respect of drink, diverts it to the alternative mean­ ing.
οἱ πυρέττοντες, says St. Chrysostom, τὴν φλόγα.
Hom. lxiii in Matth. p. 631 C.467. ὦ πόλλ’ ἀναλώσας ἔπη κ.τ.λ.]
The Chorus of Men, who have kept silence during the controversy between the Ma­ gistrate and the garrison of the Acropolis, now recommence their complaint against the Chorus of Women for drenching them with water, just as they had done in their last speech, supra 399-402.470.
κονίας]
Kovia is the lye of ashes (τὸ ἐκτέφρας καθιστάμενονὑγρὸν, Pollux vii.40) which was used as soap, Ach. 18, Frogs 711, Plato, Rep. iv. 7 (p. 430 A).
The Women had said, supra 377, that if the Men had any soap they would give them a bath;
but as a matter of fact they have given them a bath without any soap.
I cannot think that any play is intended as some have suggested between ἄνευ κονίας and ἀκονιτί.472.
κυλοιδιᾶν] to have black eyes;
literally to have swellings underneath your eyes.
κύλα are the parts immedi­ ately beneath the eyes, τὰ ὑποκάτω τῶν διόωντες, ” Suidas, and so the Scholiast here.
See Ruhnken's Timaeus, s.v. who says “Κυλοιδιᾶν dicuntur, quibus oculi, vel ex verberibus, vel ex insomnia, vel ex quacunque alia caussa tument.”474.
κινοῦσα μηδὲ κάρφος]
This either then was, or afterwards became, a pro­ verbial description of quiet inoffensive behaviour.
It is given as such by Suidas and the Paroemiographers (Diog. vi. 67 ;
Gaisford, p. 208);
and occurs twice in the Mimes of Herondas i. 54, iii. 67.
In the latter passage a schoolmaster is to flog a mischievous urchin until he makes him κοσμιώτερ
ον κούρης I κινεῦντα μηδὲ κάρφος.475.
βλίττῃ] βλίττειν means to take the honey from the honey-comb, ἀφαιρεῖν To μέλι ἀπὸ τῶν κηρίων, Hesychius, Suidas, Timaeus, where see Ruhnken's note.
See also Knights 794, Birds 498, and the Commentary on those passages.
The Etymologicum Magnum (s. v. βλιμάζειν) says, according to some MSS., λαμβάνεται ’Αττικῶς.
See Gaisford's note on the pas­ sage.
But σφηκιὰ, a wasp's or hornet’s nest (Wasps 224, 229, 404), is not a very desirable place to rifle for honey;
and I suspect that Aristophanes is mocking the line of Sophocles abouttakinghoney from a wasp's nest;
while the Women may be wishing tolet their opponents know that, if they try to rifle their sweets, they will bring aswarm of hornets about their ears.
476. ὦ Zεῦ κ.τ.λ.]
The preliminary skirmishes (1) between the Men and Women Choruses, and (2) between the Magistrate and the garrison of the Acropolis are now concluded, and the parties settle down to one of those full­ dress debates in anapaestic tetrameters which, whenever they occur, form the most picturesque, as well as the most illuminating, portion of the Play.
In them we are sure to find the real intent and purpose of the drama set forth in a lucid and vigorous argument, with little or no attempt at comic caricature.
The little song with which the Chorus of Men commence the debate, the anti­ strophe to which, sung by the Chorus of Women, will be found infra 541-8, is composed of seven lines ;
two cretico- paeonic (the first of the two having a monosyllabic base);
and five anapaes­ tic, four consisting of three anapaests each, and the last of two anapaests.
The long syllable of the anapaest is frequently resolved into two short ones ;
so that in lieu of the ordinary anapaest we have one in four short syllables.481.
Κραναάν]
In the time of the Pelasgians, Herodotus tells us, the Athenians went by the name of Κραναοί ;
afterwards, in the time of Cecrops, they received the further name of Κεκροπίδαι (Knights 1055);
and it was not until the time of Erechtheus that they took the name of ’Αθηναῖοι, Hdt. viii.
44. The an­ tique flavour of the name " Cranaan " appealed strongly to the Athenians, who always prided themselves on their antiquity.
Pindar thrice uses the words Κρανααῖς ἐν ’Αθάναις, Olympic vii, xiii ;
Nemea viii.
Aristophanes speaks of τῶν Kpavawv (sc. τῶν ’Αθηνῶν) in Birds 123, and of the Κραναὰ πόλις in Ach. 75 and here, as did both Aeschylus and So­ phocles (Scholiast on Ach. 75).
More especially was the epithet applicable, as it is here applied, to the Acropolis, the oldest inhabited part of Athens, and probably the only inhabited part in those old Pelasgic days.
483.
ἱερὸν τέμενος]
For the whole Acropolis was a sacred enclosure, ὅλης οὔσης ἱερᾶς τῆς 'Ακροπόλεως ταυτησὶ, Demosthenes, tie F. L. 309 (p. 428).
See the Commentary on 345 supra.
The term τέμενος included not only the Temple itself, but all the courts and sacred pre­ cincts belonging to it.
The words ἄβατον ἱερὸν are in Plato's Laches, chap. 6 (p. 183 B) employed with regard to Lacedaemon. " I observe the hoplites," says Laches, " τὴν Λακεδαίμονα ἡγουμένους εἶναι ἄβατον ἱερὸν, καὶ οὐδ’ ἄκρῳ ποδὶ ἐπιβαίνοντας.”485. ἀκωδώνιστον] untested.
But how κωδωνίζω comes to bear that signification is not quite certain.
The old gramma­ rians refer it either to the custom of the night-watch ringing bells as they went their rounds for the purpose of ascer­ taining whether the sentries were awake, or elsetothe practice of testing the nerves of horses, or of quails, by the sudden ring­ ing of bells.
The Scholiast says μετῆκται three explanations-the night-watch, the quail, and the horse-are given by Suidas, Hesychius, and Etymol.
Magn. under various headings.
But both Suidas and Photius under κωδω­ νίσαι, and the Etymol.
Magn.
under διακωδωνισθέντες confine themselves to the horse-test, saying in the same words participle μεθέντας at the end of the line may either govern τὸ πραγμα or be used intransitively, slackening in our efforts, " nostra negligentia " as Brunck translates it.487.
τὴν πόλιν] that is, as the Scholiast observes, τὴν ἀκρόπολιν.
It is in fact the word which Aristophanes almost invari­ ably employs to describe the Acropolis ;
cf.
Thuc. ii. 15.
This is the only Play in which the actual term ἀκρόπολις is found, though here it occurs five times.
In answer to the Magistrate's question Lysistrata avers that they had seized the Acropolis for the purpose of keeping the money safe, and so stopping the supplies for the War.
This was their avowed object, supra 173-80.490.
Πείσανδρος]
For Peisander see Peace 394 and the note there.
The Scholiast on the Peace says of him οὗτος φιλοπόλεμος ἦν, καὶ πολεμοποιὸς κερδῶν ἰδίων ἕνεκεν.
A turbulent and restless intriguer, he was at this moment one of the chief promoters of the scheme for subverting the democracy and es­ tablishing the rule of the Four Hundred in its place.
The Scholiast observes that Aristophanes had spoken of him much in the same way, fifteen years be­ fore, in his comedy of the Babylonians ;
and the line is preserved by the Scholiast on Birds 1556, ἢ δῶρ’ αἰτῶν ἀρχὴν πολέμου μετὰ Πεισάνδρ
ου πορίσειεν :
a line which reads, as Bergk remarks, as if it came from a list of persons to be pilloried for their political or social offences, like the list in Frogs 354-68.493.
ἡμεῖς ταμιεύσομεν]
The Athenian treasury in the Acropolis in the ὀπι­ σθόδομος of Athene's Temple was under the charge of ten officials, one from each tribe, who are called by Aristotle ταμίαι τῆς ’Αθηνᾶς, Polity of Athens, chap. 47.
But now the women themselves, the Acropolis being in their hands, propose to undertake the duties of these ταμίαι, and keep guard over the money in the Treasury.
They are quite competent to discharge these duties, they say, for do they not already manage τἄνδον χρήματα, the household money ?
Kai γὰρ ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις, says Praxagora in Eccl. 211, speaking of the women, ταύταις ἐπιτρόποις KaI ταμίαισι χρώμεθα.497.
πρῶτον]
The Magistrate was fully justified in saying that the money was urgently required for the war;
for never had Athens been in such straits for both ships and money as she was at this particular crisis, Thuc. viii.
1. 15. But Lysistrata puts aside that question by raising a preliminary objection.
The question whether the money is, or is not, necessary for the war is, she says, quite immaterial;
for the war is itself un­ necessary.
πρῶτον is used in exactly the same way in Eccl. 657 (where see the Commentary) and Plutus 519, 522.499.
ὡς σωθήσει κ.τ.λ.]
I have placed this line in brackets, because in my opinion it is no part of the genuine text, but the work of some grammarian attempting to summarize the statements of Lysistrata and the Magistrate.
It did not appear in any printed edition before Brunck's ;
it is found neither in the original text of the Ravenna nor in that of the Munich MS., though some later grammarian has written it in the margin of both.
It adds nothing to the argument, but merely creates a weari­ some repetition of the speeches already made.
With ὡς σωθήσει we must un­ derstand ἴσθι or some such word.
See the Commentary on Wasps 416.505.
ΣΤ.]
These four words, given in the MSS.
and older editions to Lysis­ trata, and by later editions to the "First Woman," I have assigned to old Stratyllis, the leader of the Women's Chorus, who has already intervened in the dialogue carried on by the actors on the stage (supra 447, see the Commentary on 435 and 445 supra), and seems generally anxious to have a finger in the pie.
But the Magistrate declines to recognize the old hag in the orchestra ;
ὦ γραῦ as be politely calls her.
He waves her aside with a jibe on her age, and a hope that with her ill-omened in­ terruption she is a boding raven, croaking her own fate.
And turning to Lysistrata, he bids her answer the question he put four lines above, viz.
what had in­ duced the women to intermeddle with questions of Peace and War.
This Lysistrata proceeds to tell him.507.
TOV μὲν προτέρου πολέμου κατά]
I have ventured to substitute these words for the common reading τὸν μὲν πρότερον πόλεμον καὶ, which makes no sense at all.
The substituted words are very inelegant, and veryunlike what Aristophanes would have written, but I think that they give the meaning which Aristophanes in­ tended to convey, viz. in the time of theformer tear:
that is of the so-called Archidamian War, which commenced with the first invasion of Attica under King Archidamus, and was terminated by the Peace of Nicias.509.
ἠρέσκετέ γ’ ἡμᾶς]
To σχῆμα ’Αττικόν. —Scholiast.
He means the use of the accusative, instead of the dative, after ἀρέσκω.
The usage is very common, and Van Leeuwen must have forgotten this passage and many others when in Frogs 103, σὲ δὲ ταῦτ’ ἀρέσκει, he proposed to change σὲ δὲ into σοί.
Still more astonishing is his remark on the pre­ sent passage that in Frogs 103 ἀρέσκει is followed by an accusative (not, as here, of the person but) of the thing.510. ἔνδον] in the house, as supra 495, infra 516;
while engaged at home in our domestic affairs.513.
ἐν τῇ στήλῃ παραγράψαι] to write on the Treaty-pillar by the side of the Treaty.
That treaties were inscribed on pillars is of course well known ;
and several instances are given in the Com­ mentary on Ach.
727. Generally, one of these pillars was erected in the capital city of each of the contracting parties, whilst others were established in some place of Panhellenic sanctity, such as Olympia or Delphi.
How care­ fully they were preserved may be judged by the statement of Pausanias, writing 600 years afterwards, that he had seen at Olympia the bronze pillar containing the terms of the 30 years' truce made in 455 B. c. between the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians (Thuc. i. 115) and also the pillar containing the terms of the 100 years' treaty made in 420 B.C. between Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis (Thuc. v. 47), Pausanias v. 12. 7 and 23. 3. But in the present passage we are dealing with the pillar containing the Peace of Nicias which, as we know (Thuc. v. 18), was to be erected in the Acropolis of Athens.
Some three years later Alcibiades persuaded the Athe­ nians to write on this στήλη, underneath the Treaty, that the Lacedaemonians bad failed to abide by their oaths;
Λακεδαιμόνιοι τοῖς ὅρκοις.—Thuc. v. 56.
This is no doubt the transaction to which Lysistrata is alluding.515. ἀλλ’ OUK]
Stratyllis again at­ tempts to put in her oar, and is again treated with scant ceremony by the Magistrate.519.
ὑποβλέψας] scowling, looking at me from under his bent brows.
See Thesm.
396.
The meaning is very similar to that of ταυρηδὸν βλέπειν in Frogs 804, where see the Commentary.
That the glance here was a scowl is plain from the speech which accompanies it.
στή­ μονα νεῖν is to spin the thread to be used as warp in weaving.
In the Batracho­ myomachia (183) Athene refuses to assist the mice because they have de­ voured the πέπλος which she had woven with great care, καὶ στήμονα λεπτὸν ἔνησα.
As to ὀτοτύξεσθαι μακρὰ τὴν κεφαλὴν, to wail loudly for her head, which will be soundly smacked, see Plutus 612 and the Commentary there.520.
πόλεμος δ’ ἄνδρεσσι μελήσει]
This is from the farewell speech of Hector to Andromache, intended to still her " boding fear, Ere from her last embrace her hero part."
Fear not for me, he says, "Daughter," says old Simon Glover to the Fair Maid of Perth (chap. 2), "your tongue wags too freely.
Quarrels and fights are men's business, not women's ;
and it is not maidenly to think or speak of them.
"524. οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνήρ]
Not one, he means, who could help them.
The language is similar to that of the Prophet Isaiah lix.
ρίσατο.
Cf. Id. lxiii.
5. On the present passageTyrwhitt acutely observes " Haec de Alcibiade in triviis iactitata fuisse con­ iicio."
And doubtless such sentiments as these were largely instrumental in bringing about the exile's triumphant return.
The Athenians had lost in Sicily not only their fleets and armies, but also their most trusted leaders;
and the people, disheartened and bewildered, would naturally look for a man to shape their policy in this crisis, and would look in vain.
And so all eyes would turn to that remarkable young man who, whether acting for or against his country, bad proved himself beyond all comparison the most brilliant and resourceful politician of his time.
They recalled him, and made him dictator, and all went well.
They distrusted him, and dispensed with his services, and Athens was ruined.527, 528.
ἀντακροᾶσθαι κἀντισιωπᾶν]
To listen and keep silence in our stead.
The sexes are to change places.
The women are to be the active speakers and mana­ gers of the State, as the men had hitherto been;
the men in their turn are to listen and keep quiet, as the women had hitherto done.
In the next line Lysistrata is putting her plan into operation.
The Magistrate, interrupt­ ing, is at once told to hold his tongue, just as under the previous system the wife had been told by her husband ;
supra 515.530.
κάλυμμα]
A covering for the head, a veil enveloping the head and face ;
sometimes used of a bride's wedding-veil, Aesch.
Ag. 1149, Eur. Iph.
Taur. 372;
sometimes of a mourner's veil.
But it was not confined to those classes.
Lysistrata, who is neither a bride nor a mourner, is wearing one now ;
and the Magistrate's allusion to it as a distinc­ tive article of womanly attire has a result he little expected.
It gives Lysistrata an idea which she and her comrades immediately carry out.
The Man, we have seen, is now to take the Woman's place ;
and it is he therefore whose duty it is to wear the κάλυμμα and spin the thread, στήμονα νεῖν.
At once, therefore, they array the surprised Magistrate in this womanly veil, and supply him with the basket and require­ ments of a spinning-woman.
With σοί γε σιωπῶ ’γώ;
compare Frogs 1134 ἐγὼ σιωπῶ τῷδ’;
535.
καλαθίσκον]
This was a woman's wicker work-basket in which the wool was placed ready for the spinner.
Catul­ lus (lxiv. 319), describing the Parcae at work, says Ante pedes autem candentis mollia lanae Vellera virgati custodibant calathisci.
And the wool, taken out by the spinner, was carded back into the basket;
cf. infra 579.
We may be sure, both from the grammatical requirements of the present passage and from the analogy of the corresponding system of dimeters infra 603, 604, that this line is spoken by one of Lysistrata's friends (I think, Myrrhina), and that a line before it, spoken by another of her friends (Calo­ nice), has dropped out of the text.
For the missing line Enger suggests καὶ ταυτηνὶ λαβὲ τὴν ζώνην, and Meineke Kal τόνδε πόκον δέξαι 7rap' ἐμοῦ, whilst Van Leeuwen inserts in the text a line of his own Kal τὸν ἄτρακτον τοῦτοι’ δέξαι.536. ξαινειν] to card the wool.
Cf. infra 579.
συζωσάμεν
ος girding up your gar­ ments, that they may not embarrass your movements.
So spinning-women are represented on the vases ;
and cf.
Dodwell i. 460.537.
κυάμους τρώγων]
Women were in the habit of chewing some eatable as they wove or spun.
Bergler quotes from Athenaeus iii, chap. 4 (p. 73 D) τὸν σικυον τρώγουσα, γύναι, τὴν χλαῖναν ὔΦαινε.
And Lysistrata selects κυάμους as the special vegetable for the Magistrate to chew, because, being an Athenian citizen, he is presumably a κυαμοτρὼξ (Knights 41, infra 690), a bean-consumer, that is to say, very fond of the bean, not indeed as an article of food, but as the ψῆφος with which Athenians voted in their popular elections.
538.
πόλεμος δὲ γυναιξι μελήσει]
She is again referring to Hector's speech, as supra 520;
but with Hector the wife was to go to the loom, while " War was the care and the business of Men" ;
whereas here the Man is to go to the loom, and “War is the care and the business of Women.”541. ἔγωγε]
The first debate is inau­ gurated (supra 476-83) by a song of encouragement addressed by the Chorus of Men to the Magistrate ;
the second by a similar song addressed by the Chorus of Women to Lysistrata and her friends.
The old Women in the orchestra are full of enthusiasm for the young Women on the stage;
for their native grace, their courage, their bright wit, and their wise patriotism.
There is nothing that they are not prepared to do for Lysistrata's sake;
but un­ fortunately, owing to their respective positions in the orchestra and on the stage, there is nothing that they can at the present moment do but dance;
and this, they protest, they will never tire of doing.549.
ἀλλ’ ὦ τηθῶν ἀνδρειοτύτων] λειπει παῖδες.—
Scholiast.
Ye children of man­ liest grandmothers, ye whose mothers were —stinging-nettles.
That τήθη is strictly a grandmother is evident from Acharnians 49 and Plato's Rep. v. 9 (p. 461 D).
And as to the application of the epithet ἀνδρεῖος to objects other than ἄνδρες see the note on Wasps 1090.
The verbal play in the latter part of the verse can hardly be preserved in our language.
We are intended to suppose that μητρι­ διων is a substantive, the diminutive of μητέρων, but the unexpected addition of ἀκαληΦῶν shows that it is an adjective, and that μητριδιων ἀκαληΦῶν means seed­ ing nettles, nettles which have arrived at the age at which their stinging powers are fully developed ;
μητριδιας δὲ λέγουσι τὰς ἐχούσας τὸσπέρμα τῆς fiord­ νης τῆς ἀκαλήΦης. δάκνουσι δὲ αὖται.— Scholiast.
The Scholiast goes further and thinks that in τηθῶν there is an allusion to τήθευ, oysters (Iliad xvi. 747), and in ὐκυληΦῶν to sea-nettles (urticae marinae), a class to which our common jelly-fish • belong, but of which some species are very stinging and poisonous;
Wood's Natural History iii.
739. And Athenaeus iii. 39 (p. 90 B), speaking of these urticae τὴν τήθην και μητέρα.
But I fail to detect, and I think that the audience would have been unable to detect, any allusion of this kind.
It will be observed that Athenaeus writes ὐνδρειοτάτη for ἀνδρειο­ τύτων, an obvious mistake, and a very absurd one, since (apart from the plural verbs in the following line) the young and lovely Lysistrata could not possibly have been addressed as manliest ofgrand­ mothers.
Yet some recent editors, in defiance of all the MSS.
and of common sense, have introduced this absurdity into the text.
550.
χωρεῖτ’ ὀργῄ]
Bergler refers to Tbuc. v. 70, where the historian, de­ scribing the first battle of Mantineia,says On with eager passion;
no yielding now;
for still are ye running before favourable winds.
τῆς νεὼς οὐριοδρομούσης.—Helio­ dorus v. 17.554.
Λυσιμάχας]
There is no practical difference between Λυσιμάχη and Λυσι­ στράτη, but the latter name could not be brought into anapaests.
There is a simi­ lar play on the former name in Peace 992, where Trygaeus, addressing the Goddess Peace, says557.
χύτραις ... λαχάνοισιν] ἀντιτοῦ χυτροπωλιοις Kai λαχανοπωλιοις. — Scho­ liast.
the crockery and vegetable stalls.
See the note on Wasps 789.
Ever since the occupation of Deceleia by the Spar­ tans the whole population of Athens had been under arms;
Thuc. vii. 28.
And this precaution would be even more necessary after the Sicilian cata­ strophe ;
Id. viii.
69.
It is no wonder therefore that men were seen marketing in full armour ;
"just as if they were Corybants" Lysistratasays;
for the Cory­ bants, the Phrygian priests of Cybele, wore a complete set of armour, whence they are called ἔνοπλοι by Strabo x. 3. 19, and τρικόρυθες by Euripides, Bacchae 123.560.
Γοργόνα]
The Gorgon-head upon his shield ;
the device attributed to Lamachus, Ach. 574, 964, 1181.
The wearer of this terror-inspiring attire is found bargaining for some worthless little κορακίνους, diminutive gregarious fish often used for bait, like our min­ nows, but of a darker colour.
See Knights 1053 and the Commentary there.561.
ἄνδρα κομήτην]
This gentleman was a Knight, that is, a cavalry man;
therefore he wore long hair.
See the Commentary on Knights 580.
But he was not a mere private in the cavalry, he was the commander of the contin­ gent of 100 men contributed by his tribe to the Athenian cavalry.
The cavalry consisted of 1,000 men under two ίππαρ­ χοι, each tribe contributing 100 men under their own Φύλαρος.
He is still mounted on "the splendid charger which he rode at the head of his troop ” ἴππον λαμπρὸν ἐΦ of ἐΦυλάρχησε, to use the words of Isaeus "Re the estate of Hagnias," 57 (p. 88)in a passage to which Blaydes refers.
And what is this gallant equestrian doing ?
He is stowing away in his bronze helmet an omelet (λέκιθον) gotten from an old market-woman.
As to λέκιθος see the notes on 457 supra, Eccl. 1177, and Plutus 427.
The Scho­ liast here takes it to mean porridge in colour resembling the yolk of an egg, but it is doubtful if the word ever bears that meaning in Aristophanes.563.
θρᾇξ]
A great contrast to the cavalry officer who would be a well-to-do and well-educated Athenian gentleman, but even more alarming to the stall­ keepers in the agora, is the next soldier whom Stratyllis had observed.
This is one of the semi-barbarous Thracians who were frequently engaged to serve as auxiliaries to the Athenian armies.
He comes in shaking his targe and dart (the distinctive weapons of a Thracian, see the note on Ach. 160) in order to render himself more formidable, and with as much fuss and self-importance as if he were Tereus the famous Thra­ cian king.564.
ἐδεδίσκετο] frightened away.
ἐξε­ Φόβει.—Suidas.
He frightened the fig­ seller from her stall, and (in her ab­ sence) made a clean sweep of her fruit.
δρυπεπεῖς means fruit ripened on the tree (δρῦς), as contrasted, I suppose, with fruit gathered while still unripe and subsequently exposed to the sun.
The Scholiast says τάς ἐπὶ τῶν δένδρων πεπαν­ θεισας ἐλαιας Φασι δρυπεπεῖς νῦν δὲ ἐπὶ τῶν ἰσχάδων.566.
ἐν ταῖς χώραις] in the several Hel­ lenic states.
Lysistrata speaks with quiet contempt of the difficulty which the Magistrate considers insuperable.
They can do it, Φαύλως πάνυ, quite easily.567.
κλωστῆρ'] a skein, Frogs 1349.
The word τεταραγμένα, entangled, used by the Magistrate two lines above, reminds Lysistrata, of the manner in which Women disentangle and unravel a twisted ball of wool, and she at once proceeds to show him, both by her words and by the action of her fingers (ὧδε), how easily women get over that sort of difficulty.569.
νἤ τις ἐάσῃ] if nobody interferes with its;
if the women are allowed to carry out their own schemes.
572.
νοῦς]
This word replies to the ἀνόητοι in the early part of the line.
Ye witless ones, says the Man.
Why if ye yourselves had any wit, retorts the Woman, ye would manage the State al­ together after the fashion of our wool­ working.
“Ex nostro lanificio," as Bergler translates it, “sumto exemplo rempublicam administraretis."574.
πρῶτον μὲν κ.τ.λ.]
The discussion has for the moment 'been switched off the question of the War to the con­ sideration of the political situation at home.
And Lysistrata proceeds to ex­ pound her views (that is to say, the views of Aristophanes) as to the right mode of arranging the internal politics of Athens.
And here, as everywhere in these Comedies, there is an entire absence of political partisanship ;
there is merely a design of blending together all classes of the community in a bond of peace, unity, and concord;
a happy condition, partially achieved for a brief period in the course of this very year, 411 B.C., when that μετρία ἐς τοὺς ὀλιγους Kat τοὺς πολλοὺς ξύγκρασις ἐγένετο, which Thucydides stamps with his emphatic approval.
And just as in preparing the wool the first step is thoroughly to wash the fleece in the washing-tub, so the first step in the renovation of the State is to purify it from all that is corrupt and offensive, so that the official wheels (to vary the metaphor) may work in a clean and, wholesome manner, unclog­ ged with personal greed and ambition.
With the words ὤσπερ πόκον ἐν βαλανείῳ we must understand ἐκπλύνομενιn a sense somewhat different from that which it bears in the following line ;
since here, as in Plutus 1062, it means to wash thoroughly, while there, as in Plato's Republic iv. 7 (p. 430 A), it means to wash out a stain or the like.575.
τὴν οἰσπώτην] τοῦ ἐρίου ὁ ρΰπος οἰσπώτη λέγεται.-Scholiast.
In Ach.
1177 ἔρια οἰσυπηρὰ are wools with the grease in, unwashed wool.
After washing the grease out of the wool, the next step was to remove the burrs adhering to the fleece.
For this purpose the fleece would be stretched upon a bench (ἐπὶ κλίνης, cf. infra 732), and the burrs either picked out (ἀπολέξαι) by hand or struck off with sticks (ἐκραβδίζειν).
In the State they are represented by the μοχθηροὶ, the vicious and idle class who hang on to the State for the provi­ sion and maintenance which they ought to acquire by their own industry.
577.
συνισταμένους ... πιλοῦνας] band­ ing and knotting themselves together.
πιλέω is a technical word in relation to wool.
The fleece has been washed, the burrs removed, but there will still be some matted clots in the wool, which would render it useless for the wool-spinner.
Analogous to these in the body politic are the ξυνωμοσίαι έπὶ δίκας καὶ ἀρχῖς (Thuc. viii. 54), the political clubs and caucuses banded together to obtain verdicts in the dicasteries and offices in the State for themselves and their partisans.
These caucuses were at the present moment particularly active.
Peisander, Thucydides tells us (ubi supra), had approached them all, παρα­ κελευσάμενος ὂπωςξυστραΦέντες Kat κοίνῄ βουλευσάμενοι καταλύσουσι TOP δῆμον.
They could not but be abhorrent to the soul of Aristophanes, not only because they were in this crisis plotting against the Demus, but also as always tending to set class against class, his own dearest wish being to blend all classes together into one harmonious whole.
These clots in the commonwealth, like the clots in the fleece, must be separated into their component parts by the carding-comb (διαξῆναι), and the nuclei (τὰς κεΦαλὰς) which remain must be carefully plucked out.579.
κοινὴν εὒνοιαν]
The fleece is now ready, and the wool can be carded into the basket, καλαθίσκον;
see on 535 supra.
In the body politic the καλαθίσκος is represented by κοινὴ εὒνοια, for in my judgement these words are in apposition to, and explanatory of, the καλαθίσκος or basket of wool ;
the sense being to card all the citizens into the work-basket, that is to say, into a condition of peace and good­ will.
The ordinary translation for all men to card goodwill into the work- basket " seems to me unmeaning both in itself and in relation to the metaphor which Lysistrata is elaborating, ἄπαντας is the object, not the subject, of ξαίνειν.
Otherwise the citizens would be omitted altogether;
and the contents of the work-basket would be resident aliens, strangers, public debtors, and goodwill.
But in fact the citizens, one and all, ἃπαντες, are to form the staple;
the other ingredients are merely to be mingled with the citizens.
It will be remembered that a debtor to the trea­ sury lost all the privileges of a citizen :
he was disfranchised, ἃτίμς.
But Lysis­ trata will have no citizen disfranchised on a plea of this kind.
Here, as more largely in the Frogs, Aristophanes is pleading with the people τοὺς ἀτίμους ποιῆσαι.
And here, as there, his plea was carried into effect by the decree of Patrocleides.
See the Intro­ duction to the Frogs, pp. vi-viii.
The accusative τούτους in line 581 compre­ hends the three classes introduced by the words κεἴτις.583.
τὰ κατάγματα] τὰ τῶν ἐρίων ἀποσπά­ σματα οὕτωἐκάλουν.—Scholiast.
κάταγμα, a word frequently employed in connexion with wool-spinning, may be derived either from κατάγω, and so mean wool drawn out, or from κατάγνυμι, and so mean a fragment.
It seems to be used in the former sense in Plato's Politicus 23 (p. 282 E) τῶν περὶ ξαντικὴν ἔργων μηκυνθέντεκαὶ σχὸνπλάτος λέγομεν εἶναι κάταγμά τι.
But in the present line it seems more naturally to mean “ a frag­ ment."
These fragments are now lying each by itself, χωρὶς ἕκαστον, but they are all to be gathered in to the great harmonious conglomeration which Lysis­ trata is proposing.586.
τολύπην]
τολύπη is a ball of worsted quite prepared for use.
τολύπηκατὰ τοὺς παλαιοὺς ἐρίων σφαῖρα.
—Eustathius on Iliad xxiv.
7. The work of the wool- spinner is concluded, and the ball is now ready for the weaver.589.
διπλοῦν]
First, as Mothers, whose sons are slain in the battle-fields, a grief unusually poignant at the present moment, when all the flower of the Athenian youth had perished on the fatal fields of Sicily.
Secondly, as wives and maidens;
wives whose husbands are always absent on military service;
maidens doomed to perpetual maiden­ hood because all the young men are away at the war.590.
μὴ μνησικήσῃς]
Do not awake the memory of past sorrows;
let there be, as regards them, a perpetual amnesty.
See Plutus 1146.592. θἠμέτερον] the case of us married, women.
Sad as our lot may be, that of the unmarried girls growing old in their maiden apartments is still more deplorable than our own.
594.
κἄνδρες]men as well as women.
Reisig suggests χἄνδρες which is read by several modern editors, but the article is quite unnecessary.595.
κἂν ᾖπολιός] "
She were an un­ worthy maiden," says Roswitha, in one of De la Motte Fouqué's exquisite tales (The Oak of the Idols), " who would not with her whole soul love a grey-haired hero, in all his rich full glory.
"596.
μικρὸς ὁ καιρός]
As one of our own old poets, Cleveland, says rather brutally in his lines "
To Julia, to expedite her promise," Think but how soon the market fails;
Your sex lives faster than the males.598.
ἀλλ’ ὅστις κ.τ.λ.]
The Magistrate does not finish his sentence, for Lysis­ trata, finding that he is falling into gross and indelicate language, abruptly interrupts him, and she and her friends dress him up as a corpse.
What he was going to say, therefore, we can only con­ jecture ;
and in my opinion he means will soon find a girl ready to marry him.
And this is very much Bothe's opinion, who would supply γαμήσει παῖδα κόρηνκἂν ᾖ πολιός.
Other explanations, such as VanLeeuwen's “mecum istam invadite," seem to go very wide of the mark.600.
χοιρίον ἔσται]
This is Elmsley's emendation (at Ach. 788) for the χωρίον ἐστὶ of the MSS.
He refers to Peace 374 where Hermes is threatening Trygaeus with instant death, and Trygaeus in reply asks Hermes to lend him three drachmas wherewith to purchase a χοι­ ρίδιον, δεῖ γὰρ μυηθῆναί με πρὶν τεθνηκέναι.
In the line of the Acharnians, though all the MSS.
have χοῖρος, the older edi­ tions corrupt it into χῶρος.601.
μελιτοῖτταν]
A honey-cake, μᾶζα μελιτόεσσα, a cake very commonly used in religious ceremonies (cf. Clouds 507), was placed in the hand of the dead to serve as a sop for Cerberus.
ἡ μελιτοῦττα ἐδδοτο τοῖς νεκρῖς, says the Scholiast, ὡς These then-the honey-cake, Charon's fare, and the funeral wreaths-are the three things we should expect to find mentioned here, where the women are bedecking the Magistrate with the habi­ liments of a corpse, just as, at the ter­ mination of the first debate, they turned him into a spinning-maid and equipped him with spindle and work-basket.
Lysistrata does not indeed now present the Magistrate with a μελιτοῦττα, for she has not yet prepared one.
She will do so forthwith, as the words καὶ δὴ imply.
But the other requisites will be furnished at once.602.
λαβὲ ταυτί]
She is giving him the small change, μικρὰ κέρματα (possibly ἡμιωβόλια), required to pay Charon's fare.
For, as Lucian says (De Luctu 10), ἐπει­ αὐτῷ, μισθὸν τῷ πορθμεῖ τῆς ναυτιλίας γενησόμενον.
I will get you a honey-cake for Cerberus, she says in effect;
and here is the fare for Charon;
and now you must have a crown.
And two lines later the crown is duly presented to him.
But all the Commentators suppose that when Lysistrata says λαβὲ TaurI, she is giving the Magistrate something where­ with he can crown himself.
Brunck translates the line "Sume hane corollam, et cinge caput."
Bothe too explains ταυτὶ by "corollas," and Blaydes by "ornamenta aliqua muliebria quae co­ rollae loco sint."
But this interpretation makes line 604 not merely surplusage but an actual absurdity:
607.
κωλύεις ἀνάγεσθαι]
You hinder him from putting off;
you are delaying his voyage.
Aristophanes repeatedly refers to the Alcestis (Ach. 893, Knights 1251, Clouds 1415, Wasps 751, Birds 1244), and here he is probably thinking of the death-bed scene where Alcestis, still lingering, pictures Charon, impatient, eager to be off, and chiding her "for being so unconscionable a time in dying." Eur. Alc. 260.
Bergler cites these lines, and also the call which Oedipus receives to hasten his tardy footsteps in Soph.
Oed. Col. 1627.
See also the opening scenes of Lucian's Cataplus.610.
ὡς ἔχω] that is, in his funeral habiliments, βεβρεγμένος is the Scho­ liast's comment, but there is not the slightest ground for supposing that he, like the Chorus of Men (supra 381-7), had been drenched with water.
The Women Chorus, with their pitchers, are in the orchestra;
the Magistrate is on the stage, and his opponents are not the Chorus of Women but Lysistrata and her friends, who have nothing to do with pitchers of water.
Nor would the Magistrate have submitted to such treat­ ment without an outcry, such as the Men had raised before.
611. πρ
οὐθέμεσθα]
They have per­ formed some of the ceremonies due to a corpse, but they have not laid him out," that is, swathed him in white raiment, and placed him on a bed with his feet towards the door.
See Eccl. 537 and the note there.
Lysistrata pretends to believe that this is why he is complaining;
and, while acknowledging the omission, assures her victim that the other funeral ceremonies shall at all events be duly performed.
The chief of these were the τρίτα and the ἔνατα (Pollux viii, chap. 14);
and hence in the speech of Isaeus "
In the matter of the estate of Menecles," 46, the speaker, in proof of his contention that he was the adopted son and recognized succes­ sor of Menecles, says ἔθαψά τ'ἐγὼ αὗτὸν, καὶτὰ τρίτα καὶ τὰ ἔνατα ἐποίησα, καὶ τἄλλα τὰ περὶ τὴν ταφήν.
The τρίτα,as the name implies, were celebrated on the third day after the death.
For two clear days the immediate relatives were sup­ posed to be giving themselves up to fasting and watching ;
but on the third morning a banquet was prepared in honour of the dead (τῇ τρίτῃ] τὸ τῶν νε­ κρῶν ἄριστον ἐκφέρται, Scholiast;
τὸ περι­ δειπνον, Lucian, De Luctu 24), and the friends and kinsfolk came together to comfort the mourners and exhort them to take part in the entertainment;
which after their three days' fast, says Lucian, they did not require much pressing to do.614-705.
The Magistrate runs off to show to his fellow magistrates the man­ ner in which the Women have treated him.
Lysistrata and her friends with­ draw into the Acropolis, and the stage is left empty.
The two hostile Semi­ choruses, the Chorus of Men and the Chorus of Women, remain face to face in the orchestra, and resume the mutual recriminations which were interrupted by the entrance of the Probulus, supra 387.
Each of the four choral systems which follow commences with a mixture of trochaic and cretico-paeonic lines, and passes into the ordinary trochaic tetrameters;
and each concludes with a scuffle between the leaders of the two Semichoruses, Stratyllis and the Cory­ phaeus.
It is strange that the Com­ mentators should have overlooked these four little scuffles, for they constitute the very life and point of the systems.614.
οὐκ ἔτ'ἔργον]
In the previous altercation the women enjoyed the privilege of their sex in having the last word, and they will do the same in this renewal of hostilities.
The Men begin.
They belong, as we have heard supra 380, to the dicastic class who smell out " Tyranny " and " Conspirators " in everything (ὡς ἅπανθ' ὑμȋν τυραννίς ἐστι Kat ξυνωμόται) ;
and in accordance with this tradition they at once accuse their adversaries of conspiring to reintroduce the tyranny of Hippias, the last Tyrant of Athens.
This as free-born men (ὅστις ἔστ' ἐλεύθερος) they will resist to the uttermost;
they will wreathe their swords in myrtle, and stand beside the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton who slew the tyrant," Hipparchus, the brother of Hippias;
and again, they will act like the Alcmaeonidae who rose up against the Tyrants and were finally instrumental in expelling them.615.
ἐπαποδυώμεθ']
let us strip to the task, that is, devote all our energies to it;
just as we English speak of " taking off our coats to the task." " Take off your coat to it, Philip," says one student in Clough's " Bothie " to another who was commencing a rather heated argu­ ment.
But no doubt these four choral systems were accompanied by dancing ;
and the members of each Semichorus, in turn, throw off their upper mantles for the purpose of the dance;
see infra 637, 662, and 686.618.
'Ιππίου]
See the note four lines above.
But in the words τῆς 'Ιππίου τυραννίδος, as applied to the women, there is here, as in Wasps 502, where see the note, an allusion to the σχῆμα συνουσίας which was known as κέλης.622.
Κλεισθένους]
Cleisthenes, the per­ petual butt of the Comic Poets for his gross effeminacy, is selected as a fitting intermediary between the Athenian women and the Laconian men, as par­ taking of the nature of both.
In Thesm.
576 he is described as the πρόξενος of the women.
624.
τὰχρήμαθ'] τὰ ἐν ἀκροπόλει.— Scholiast.
From the treasury in the Acropolis had come that flow of public money from which, amongst other things, the dicastic fee of three obols was paid.
From that fec, now as at the date of the Wasps, the poorerclassesgot their living.
But the women have seized the treasury and cut off the supply.
Here again the connexion of the Chorus of Men with the dicasteries is assumed.
See the note on 614 supra.628.
πρός] besides.
The word is here used adverbially, as infra 1238.629.

They are quoting the very words of the great Harmodius- scolium or scolia, which will be found in full in the Commentary on Wasps 1225.633.
ἑξῆς 'Αριστογείτονι] beside Aristo­ geiton.
The expression exactly corre­ sponds to the 7rap' 'Αρμοδίῳ, beside Har­ modius, of Eccl. 682.
For the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton were not distinct and separate statues, but formed one group of statuary representing the two friends in the act of attacking the tyrant.
See the note on the Ecclesia­ zusae ubi supra.
This group was erected at the head of the Agora, not far from the Propylaea ;
and may possibly have been represented in the scenery of the stage.
See Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. xiv.634.
ὧδέ θ' ἑστήξω]
He is probably assuming the very attitude in which Aristogeiton was represented in the sculpture delivering the blow which slew the tyrant " ;
and so getting him­ self into the fittest position for the blow which he himself in the following line will plant on the cheek of this tyrannical Woman.
For now, he goes on to say, the time has arrived for him to emulate the achievements of the Tyrannicides, and strike one blow upon that old hag's face.
I have substituted αὐτόθεν from this place or forthwith for the αὐτὸς γὰρ of the MSS.
and early editions, which satisfies neither the sense nor the metre ;
and for the αὐτὸ γὰρ of later editions which gives no satisfactory meaning.

He suits the action to the word, and slaps old Stratyllison the cheek.

See the note on 615 supra.641. ἑπτὰμὲν ἔτη] γεγῶσ']
When I was seven years old.
We have here an in­ teresting enumeration of the distinctions which a young Athenian girl might hope to attain.
First, she might be chosen between the ages of seven and eleven (Et. Magn.)tobe one of the four ἀρρηφόροι selected for their noble birth (δι' εὐγένειαν Harpocration) to serve Athene for a year in the Erechtheium.
They were clad in white, and at the festival of the ἀρρηφόρια carried in caskets (ἐν κίσταις, Scholiast, Suidas s. v. χαλκεῖα) certain mysterious objects connected with the worship of the Goddess.
Hence they derived their name of ἀρρηφόροι (as if ἀρρητοφόροι) ἐπειδὴ τὰ ἄρρηταἐν κίσταις ἔφερον τῇ θεῷ ai παρθένοι, Scholiast.
Pausanias Attica xxvii.
4) tells a curious tale of their carrying away these mysterious objects byanunderground passage, and receiving others in exchange.
And two of them assisted the priestesses in preparing the Peplus for the Panathenaic festival, Harpocration, Et. Magn., Suidas s. v. χαλκεῖα.
And see Leake's Athens i. 156 note.643.
ἀλετρίς]
These ἀλετρίδες were young maidens of good birth and good repute, selected to grind on the holy mills, ἱεροὶ μυλῶνες, the grain required for the sacrificial πόπανα.
The Scholiast says γίνονταί τιενες τῶν εὖ γεγονυιῶν ἀλε­ τοῡτο.
ἦσανδὲ Kal ἱεροὶμυλῶνες. Eusta­ thius (on Odyssey xx. 105) quotes from ancient writers various accounts of these Mill-maidens, but they do not carry us beyond the Scholiast's statements.
The Mystery-maidens as we have seen were little girls between seven and eleven.
The Mill-maidens are rather older;
damsels ten years old and up­ wards.
For we may assume that when the speaker says that at ten years of age she became a Mill-maiden she means that she attained that distinction at the earliest possible age.
But whom are we to understand by the words τάρχηγέτι ?
The Scholiast, after explaining that the words are equivalent to τῇ δεσποίνῃ the Sovereign Lady, refers them to either Artemis or Demeter;
while Tyrwhitt calls attention to the statement in Plutarch's Alcibiades, chap. 2, ἡμῖν δὲ ἀρχηγέτις 'Αθηνᾶ ἐστίν.
Elmsley, in his note on Tyrwhitt, thinks that Athene is certainly meant;
and this seems most probable.
645.
ἄρκτος ἦ Βραυρωνίοις]
After being a Mystery-maiden and a Mill-maiden, I M'as a Bear-maiden in the festival of Brauronian Artemis.
Brauron, a town on the sea-coast of Attica, midway be­ tween Marathon and Sunium, claimed to be the possessor of the statue of Artemis which fell down from heaven into the Tauric Temple where, after­ wards, Iphigeneia was priestess, and whence she brought it on her return to Hellas.
She continued, it was believed, to be its custodian at Brauron to the end of her life ;
and the bear was so in­ timately, and so mysteriously, connected with the worship of the Brauronian Artemis that some supposed Brauron, and not Aulis, to have been the scene of the attempted sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and the victim substituted in her stead by Artemis to have been not a deer, but a bear.
A tame bear belonging to the sanctuary was killed by some Athenian lads, and the wrath of Artemis at the sacrilegious act could be appeased only by a regulation that every Athenian maiden should before her marriage be required " to play the bear" (ἀρκτεύειν), that is, to dress up as a bear, and in that guise take part in the Temple service.
She wore on that occasion a yellow robe (τὸν κροκωτὸν) assimilated to the colour of a bearskin.
But this, though doubt­ less a proud day for the bear-maiden, was a universal custom and not a dis­ tinctive honour;
nor does it seem to have been connected with the quin­ quennial festival of the Brauronia of which the poet is here speaking ;
and if the somewhat questionable statement of a Scholiast here, whom Suidas copies, be correct, and the maidens who took part in the ceremony were not older than ten, nor younger than five, this cannot be the bear-maidenship to which the speaker is referring.
For at ten years of age she became the Mill-maiden, and it was not until later (κᾇτ' ἔχουσα κ.τ.λ.) that she became the Bear-maiden.
Probably in the great quinquennial festival, some maiden of fifteen or there­ abouts was selected as a special distinc­ tion to walk in the procession in yellow robes as one of the sacred bears.
See as to this festival the authorities cited in the Commentary on Peace 874.
The worship of the Brauronian Artemis was not confined to the little town of Brauron.
There was a Temple in her honour in Athens itself not far from the Propylaea;
and near its site a little stone bear has recently been found.
See Percy Gardner's New Chapters in Greek History," chap. 8.646.
κἀκανηφόρουν]
She has been, in turn, a Mystery-maiden, a Mill-maiden, and a Bear-maiden;
and she winds up with the κανηφ
ορία, the crown of a Maiden's life ;
a distinction, the details of which have been sufficiently described in the Commentary on Ach.
242, Birds 1551, and Eccl. 730.
The wreath of figs " is not, I believe, elsewhere men­ tioned.
The Scholiast says that besides bearing baskets of solid gold ἐπόμπευον Kai ὁρμαθοὺς ἔχουσαι τῶν ἰσχάδων.
This was doubtless the fact, but possibly his only authority for the statement is the present passage.650. ἤν ἀμείνω κ.τ.λ.]
If I contribute better things than our •present troubles, which, she means, are your contribution.
What those " better things " are she ex­ plains in the following line καὶγὰρ ἄν­ δρας εἰσφέρω, I contribute MEN to the service of the State.
εἰσφέρειν is the technical word for contributions made by citizens to the State.
See the Com­ mentary on Knights 924.
And as to the ἔρανος, the family contributions for their poor and destitute relatives, see on Ach.
615.653. παππῷον ἐκ τῶν Μηδικῶν]
The con­ tribution assessed by our grandsires as a consequence of the Persian wars.
She means, as the Scholiast observes, the amount assessed by Aristeides, as the contribution to be paid by the Allies to the treasury at Delos for continuing the maritime War against the Persian king.
The transfer of the treasury from Delos to Athens was one of the most striking symbols of the change from an Alliance to an Empire.
Thenceforward it became a part, and indeed the larger part, of the ordinary revenue of Athens.
But since the Sicilian catastrophe, such of the Allies as thought that they could safely do so were falling away and discon­ tinuing their contributions, whilst the Athenians themselves were becoming unwilling, if not unable, to contribute their proper εἰσφορὰς to the State.
656.

“Numquid ergo mussita­ tis ?
Si molestus sis mihi I Hoc tuas duro cothurno verberaverimgenas.”—Florent Chretien.657. ἀψήκτῳ] unsmoothed, and there­ fore hard and rough.
The Scholiast explains it by σκληρῷ and ἀμαλάκτῳ, and as to the effect του μαλάττειν in making leather soft and supple see Knights 269, 389, and the notes there.
And now, just as at the conclusion of the Men's speech the Coryphaeus dealt a blow with his hand upon the cheek of Stratyllis, so here Stratyllis deals a blow with her hard rough slipper upon the cheek of the Coryphaeus.
I say the " Coryphaeus ” because the leader of the Men's Semichorus seems to be the Coryphaeus of the united Chorus.658.
ταῦτ'οὐχ ὕβρις K.T.X.]
The Men now have their second innings, full of resentment at the audacious language and action of Stratyllis.
The insolence of these women, they say, does not diminish :
it seems rather to augment;
ἐπιδώσειν προσθήκην σχήσειν.
—Scholiast.
Therefore we must again strip to our task.
See on 615 supra.
The ἐξωμὶς, a garment which passed under, instead of over, the right shoulder, and so left the right arm and shoulder uncovered (whence indeed it derived its name), was most commonly worn by slaves and labourers, who were naturally able to perform their tasks more easily when their right arms were free.
The old men of the Semichorus, though free-born Athenians, are wearing it here, to enable them to handle more effectively the great fire-logs they were carrying on their entrance.
It took the place of both ἱμάτιον and χιτών.
ἐξωμὶς γὰρ, says Eustathius on Iliad xviii.
595, χιτὼν ἄμα καὶ ἱμάτιον τὸαὐτό.
And so Hesychius s.v. καὶ οἱ κωμικοὶ, ὅτε μὲν“'Ενδυθι” (infra 1021) ὅτεδὲ “ Περιβαλοῦ.”
This does not mean, as it is commonly taken to mean, that the ἐξωμὶς could be worn either as an ἱμάτιον or as a χιτών ;
it means that it did duty for both.
The Men had already thrown it off at the commence­ ment of the first system (supra 615) and had resumed it at its close;
now they lay it aside again, and apparently do not resume it till the Women (infra 1020) tell them how absurd they look with the upper part of their bodies uncovered, and help them to put it on again.
663. ἐντεθριῶσθαι] to be swaddled up in.
ἐνθριοῦν literally means “ to wrap up in a fig-leaf," θρῖον, as dainties were com­ monly served up.
See Ach. 1101, Frogs 134, and the Commentary on both places.664.
λευκόποδες]
We must suppose that the old men are wearing λευκὰς ἐμβάδας.
That these were commonly worn by courtesans (Pollux vii. 92) is no argument against their use by old men in a Comedy;
and the contention of Bothe and others that λευκόποδες here means "barefoot " seems quite inadmis­ sible.
The veterans had thrown off their ἐξωμίδες, but not their shoes ;
and in truth " with bare white feet" would be an epithet suitable to young girls rather than to these old soldiers who would pride themselves on being μελάμποδες:
com­ pare infra 800-4.
But whatever the exact signification of λευκόποδες, the word is here intended to be a play upon λυκόποδες, an epithet applied to the Alcmaeonidae and other exiles, in the days when they were rising against the "tyrant" house of the Peisistratidae.
For the veterans are still thinking of the attempt of the women to impose upon them the tyranny of Hippias" (supra 618), and of their own determina­ tion to resist that attempt to the utter­ most.
Why the insurgent Alcmaeonidae were called λυκόποδες is uncertain.
The Scholiast thinks it was either because their feet were clad in wolfskin, or be­ cause they bore on their shields the figure of a wolf;
but it seems more pro­ bable that it was a name given them by their enemies because, like wolves, they were always prowling about the frontier, seeking an opportunity to attack.
But the exiles of whom the Alcmaeonidae were the leaders," says Aristotle, Polity of Athens, chap. 19, " were unable by their own unassisted efforts to effectuate their own restora­ tion, and invariably met with disaster.
And amongst other failures was their fortification of Leipsydrium which is above Mount Parnes, where they were successfully besieged by the tyrants;
whence came the Scolium:
Alas !
Alas !
Leipsydrium, comrade­ betraying !
what men valiant in fight, and noble of birth didst thou destroy !
men who showed, by their valour from what sires they sprang."
And he goes on to show how they ultimately called in the Lacedaemo­ nians under Cleomenes:
and so the Peisistratidae were expelled.
See supra 273, infra 1151.
The story is told by Hdt. v. 62-5, and the Scolium is found in many ancient authors.
Possibly in the Scolium itself the words Αειψύδριον προδωσέταιρ
ον were intended to suggest the idea of neat wine, unmingled with water, which would treacherously over­ throw the comrades who partook of it.
See Mure's Greek Literature iii. 2. 13.666. eT' ἦμεν ἔτι] when we still were Men.
For now, like the veterans in the Acharnians, they account themselves as οὐδὲν ὄντας, Ach. 681. The affair at Leipsydrium occurred about a century before the date of the Lysistrata.
The grandfathers of the speakers may have taken part in it.672.
ἐνδώσει ... λαβήν]
The same ex­ pression occurs in Knights 847.
ἐνδιδόναι λαβήν is to lend a hold, not without an idea of giving way on the part of him who lends it.673.
λιπαρου̑ςχειρουρίας] of strenuous craftsmanship.
They will be behindhand, he means, in no handicraft, however difficult and laborious.
675.
ὥδπερἈρτεμισία] as Artemisia did.
He means " the Carian Artemisia strong in war " who built her ships and led them across the Aegaean to fight on the side of the Persian invaders against the Hellenic fleet at Salamis.
In the general rout of the Persians her trireme was vigorously, but unsuccessfully, pursued by Ameinias the brother of Aeschylus, δεινὸνγαρ τι εσθαι, Hdt. vili.
93. And that, says the speaker here, is exactly what these wretched women will do, if we only give them the chance.676.
διαγράφω]
I run my pen through;
I strike them out, as non-existent.
So utterly, if the women attack them, will they be annihilated.
The Scholiast fancies that there is some reference to the cancellation of an action at law (Clouds 774), but this does not seem very probable.677.
ἱππικώτατον] excellent in horse­ back exercise and keeps her seat well.
But in ἱππικώτατον there is the same allusion intended as in Ίππίου supra 618.678.
Άμαζόνας]
The great legendary invasion of Attica by the Amazons, their victorious progress, and their final defeat by Theseus under the very walls of the Acropolis became a familiar theme for Athenian artists, as well as for Athenian writers.
Two large frescoes, one in the Poecile (Pausanias i. 15) and the other on the walls of the Temple of Theseus (Id. i. 17), represented the great battle to later generations;
and with both these paintings Micon seems to have been concerned.
The Scholiast here attributes to his brush the fresco in the Poecile ;
and see Pliny xxxv. 35;
whilst Pausanias (i. 17) notices his connexion with the paintings in the Theseium.
Micon was an Athenian painter of great distinction, and some of the finest paint­ ings in Athens were the joint productions of himself and Polygnotus.
There were other representations in Athens of the Amazons;
but these were apparently the work of other artists.680.
ἐςτετρημένον ξύλον]
Literally, the perforated wood, meaning either the stocks or the pillory or a combination of both.
The Scholiast says τὸν κύφωνα λέγει.
See the Commentary on Knights 367 and 1049.
Down to the word λαβόνας we have merely a threat, which should have been completed by the words τοὺς αὐχένας, but the Coryphaeus, seeing Stratyllis handy to his grasp, says του­ τονὶ τὸν αὐχένα, at the same time seizing her round the neck, and getting her for a moment (in wrestling phrase) " into Chancery."
Her indignation at this outrage is shown by the very first words of her retort.682.
ζωπυρήσεις] kindle into flame, and so arouse, excite.
Cf. Peace 310.683. τὴν ἐμαυτη̑ς ὗν] τὴν φύσιν(that is, my natural unrestrained wrath) λέγει, τὴν ὀργήν.
—Scholiast.
She means (to quote from Tennyson's Princess) that " wild beast of force, Whose home is in the sinews of a man" or woman.
No wild beast was more formidable to the Greeks than the wild boar ;
as witness the Erymanthian boar, and the boar of Calydon ;
the boar which slew Adonis, and that other boar " with bristling hair and eyes of flame " which inflicted the memorable scar upon the thigh of Odysseus.
«Ys is, of course, both mascu­ line and feminine;
it is used in the feminine here, because it represents, on a woman's lips, a woman's wrath.685.
τοὺςδημότ βωστρει̑ν]
To shout to your fellow burghers;
to call them to your assistance.
So Peace 1146 τόν τε Μανη̑ ἡ :
upa βωστρησάτω, Let Syra shout to Manes to call him in.
πεκτούμενον, currycombed, that is soundly beaten.
It exactly answers to the "depexum" of Terence, Heautontimorumenos v. 1. 78, where Chremes says of his slave " Si vivo, adeo depexum dabo ut, dum vivat, me­ minerit semper mei.”
I will give him such a trimming that he shall remember me to the last day of his life.
πεκτει̑ν is merely another form of πέκειν, and means either to shear or to comb.687.
αὐτοδὰξ ὠργισμένων angered even to biting point.
See Peace 607.695. κάνθαρος]
She is referring to Aesop's well-known fable (No. 223 in De Furia's edition, but perhaps more cor­ rectly given by the Scholiast on the Peace) about the Eagle and the Beetle, to which allusion has already been made in Wasps 1448 and Peace 129, where see the notes.
The fable told how the insignificant beetle, when injured by the mighty Eagle, contrived to break its adversary's eggs no matter where they were laid, even when they were laid in the bosom of Zeus.
And as the beetle acted, so Stratyllis will act.
How­ ever weak the women may appear, and however strong the men, she will find a way to repay them for all their wrong- doing and insolence.
The term μαιεύσο­ μαι is employed because it was always just as the Eagle had laid her eggs that the beetle, like a μαι̑, would make its appearance.
697. ’ισμηνία]
Here we find the name of the Boeotian delegate who accom­ panied Lampito, supra 86.698.
οὐ γὰρ ἔσται δύναμις]
Ye will not have power to carry out your threats, or to do as you propose, or to subdue us women.
699.
τοι̑γεἵτυσιν]
These words are not, I think, intended to describe a class already comprised in the more general πα̑σι, by a joke similar to those in Ach.
533 μήτε γῃ̑ μήτ’ἐν ἀγορᾳ̑ μήτ’ἐν ἠπείρῳ, and Thesm.
683 γυναιξὶ καὶ βροτοι̑.
In my opinion πα̑σι means all our people, that is, all the Athenians:
just as in 579 supra ἄπαντας means not “all men " but "all Athenian citizens."
The γείτονες troves, on the other hand, are “ our neighbours over the border," such as those mentioned in the following lines.700.
θἠκάτῃ ποιου̑σα παιγνίαν] keeping a festal holiday in honour of Hecate.
For this festival she wants that prime delicacy, a Copaic eel, just as in Ach.
962 Lamachus wanted one for the Dionysian festival.
As to the Copaic eel see the Commentary on 36 supra.
It is here described as if it were a virtuous and well-loved maiden, a worthy com­ panion of " the boys."
The Scholiast says τὸ X ὅτι τὴν γυναι̑κα ἑταἵραν εἵπεν ὡς ἑται̑ρο τὸν συνήθη καὶ φίλον.
The ex­ pression τὸ χ seems to have puzzled the editors of the scholia, but it stands for "the epithet χρηστήν.”
And the Scho- East means that the epithet is employed for the purpose of showing that ἑταίραν is to be taken in a good, and not in a bad, sense.703.
τὰσὰ ψηφίσματα]
For Athens, under the influence of her demagogues, was gradually becoming a democracy of that unhappy type, in which the actions of the State are directed not by settled law, but by the ill-considered and offhand " resolutions" of the popular Assembly.
“Ετερονεἶδος δημοκρατίας, says Aristotle, τἄλλα μὲν εἶνοι ταὐτὰ (as in a well-governed state), κύριον δ’εἶναι δημαγωγούς.
—Politics iv.
4, §§ 3,4. Some instances of these hasty resolutions are given in Eccl. 813. But a more de­ plorable instance is that of the trial of the victorious generals after the battle of Arginusae ;
when those who wished them to be tried according to law were shouted down, τὸδὲπλη̑θ
ος ἐβόα, δεινὸν o ἂν βούληται (Xen. Hell. i. 7. 12), the familiar language of demagogues in every age.
In the present case we do not know the nature of the ψηφίσματα which had roused the hostility of the Boeotians, but no doubt they were consequent on the renewal of the War.705.
του̑ σκέλους λαβών]
As she says this, Stratyllis catches the Coryphaeus by the leg and topples him over.
After these four little skirmishes there is a pause in the action of the Play, and an interval of five clear days (infra 881) is supposed to have elapsed between this line and the next.
Had there been a Parabasis, this would have been the placeforit.
For this isthe turning-point of the drama.
Hitherto the women have been revolting, and establishing themselves in the Acropo­ lis ;
but now the spell is beginning to work ;
the separation of the sexes has become intolerable to both ;
the men are ready to yield, and to make peace with Sparta on any terms;
and the only danger is that the women may anticipate them in yielding.
It is this danger which brings Lysistrata out upon the stage, with evident signs of perturbation and anxiety.706.
ἄνασσα πράγος κ.τ.λ.]
The Scho­ liast says ἐκ Τηλέφουν Εὐριπίδου, but it does not appear whether this statement is confined to the first two lines or should be extended to what follows.
Again on 713 he says ἐξ Εὐριπιδου.
Anyhow it is plain that the first twelve lines of this dialogue are either bor­ rowed or parodied from Euripides, or are a happy imitation of his style.720.
διαλέγουσαν] διορύττουσαν.—Scho­ liast.
It means picking out or clearing out τὴν ὀπὴν which had been partially filled up.
In the Classical Review xi. 415, Mr. G. F. Hill, after stating that Pan's grotto, mentioned in the next line and infra 911, had been identi­ fied with " a group of passages in the rock on the north-west face of the Acropolis, to which two openings ad­ mit," goes on to say, " In front of one of the two openings into Pan's grotto begins a steep path leading up the face of the rock to a doorway (now built up) through the Acropolis wall.
This is the ὀπὴ through which one of Lysi­ strata's women passed, Aristoph. Lys. 720." For "passed" Mr. Hill should have written " was trying to pass " ;
but I assume that the identification is correct.
Only I imagine that there could have been no actual "doorway" in Lysi­ strata's time.
The expression διαλέγουα τὴν ὀπὴν seems to imply the clearing out of some irregular or overgrown aperture;
and the term ὀπὴ itself would natu­ rally here, as in Wasps 350, 352, point to a diminutive hole, through which the woman would find it difficult to creep.722.
ἐκ τροχιλἵας.
κατελυσπωμένην] wriggling down [the rope] from the pulley.
τροχιλία (said to be derived from τροχὸς and εἴλω) is the roller or pulley round which the rope is wound whereby buckets are lowered into, or raised from, the well :
o τροχὸς του̑ ξύλου του φρέατς, δἰ οὗἱμω̑σι.- Scholiast.
εἰλυσπα̑σθαι is to wriggle or crawl like a worm or a snake;
καὶ οἱ σκώληκες.
—Scholiast.
The woman is letting herself down from the top of the Acropolis by means of a well­ rope.723.
αὐτομολου̑σαν]
In a sense they are all deserting.
The special application of the term to this third woman seems to imply that she was on active service, a scout perhaps, or a sentry on outpost duty, who was deserting to the enemy.
The fourth woman is attempting to By over the wall ἐπὶ στρουθου̑ on sparrow back, παρ’ ὄσον, says the Scholiast, το ὄρνεον θερμὸν εἰς συνουσίαν.
The στρουὸς here is not the ostrich, as Florent Chretien supposes, but the pert and for­ ward little sparrow which was accounted the most amorous of birds, οἱ στρουθοὶ ὀχευτικοί εἰσιν, observes Athenaeus (ix. 46);
and he adds that Aphrodite herself is said by Sappho ἐπὶ στρουθω̑ν ὀχει̑σθαι. .
The passage of Sappho to which he refers is from her well-known hymn to Aphrodite composed in the metre to which she gives her name;
Cf. Cicero, de Finibus ii. 23;
Pliny x. 52 ;
Beaumont and Fletcher's Philaster iii. 1, &c.
A bird which was harnessed to Aphrodite's car might well serve as a steed for a lovesick woman;
and if Trygaeus could By to heaven on a beetle, she might well hope to fly over the Acropolis wall on a sparrow.
But, as they are rising for the flight, Lysistrata pulls her down (κατέσπασα) by her hair.
The word μίαν at the end of the line is peculiar, but it seems used in much the same way as εἷς in Birds 1292.725.
χθές]
They had held out heroic­ ally for four days, see the Commentary on 705 supra;
but then the limits of their endurance had been reached, and they must, by hook or by crook, escape from an insupportable position.
Orsi­ lochus, the Scholiast tells us, was a πορνοβοσκός.729.
οἴκοι... Μιλήσια]
The " Milesia vellera" were highly esteemed in the ancient world, Frogs 542;
Cicero in Verrem, Orat. vi. 34;
Virgil's Georgics iii. 306, iv. 334 ;
Pliny viii. 73;
Martial viii. 28. 10. I suspect that the proverb οἴκοι τὰ Μιλήσια was derived from this line, though the proverb collectors- Bodleian 726, Zenobius v. 57 (Gaisford, pp. 88, 362), Alexandrine 1, and so Suidas s. v. οἴκοι—give it an entirely different origin.
It was used, they say, of persons who make a display of luxury out of place.
And they explain it by alleging that when Aristagoras came to Sparta, seeking aid against the Persians (Hdt. v. 49-51), he was clothed in sumptuous Milesian raiment, whereupon an Ephor called out οἴκοι τὰ Μιλήσια, keep your Milesian luxuryfor home.
But many of the proverbs are really witti­ cisms of Aristophanes, with whom the collectors do not seem to have been well acquainted.732.
ὄσονδιαπετάσασ᾽] having only just spread the wools out over the couch;
to get rid of the moths, τῶν σέων.736.
νοπολἄ] unpeeled, with the bark still on ;
from λέπω, to peel.
The flax filaments are covered with a thin bark, which is removed by steeping and bruising the plant, and then drawing it through a machine armed with steel teeth like a comb.
This latter process, which is called hackling or heckling, removes the rotted fragments of the bark and separates the fibres into distinct threads for spinning.
As to ἀμοργὶς, the fine flax brought from the island of Amorgos (near Naxos), see supra 150.739.
ἀποδείρασ᾽] having removed the bark, that is, having heckled the flax.
δηλοῖ δὲ, as the Scholiast observes, καὶ τὸ κακέμφατον as infra 953.743.
ὄσιον] a place where I may lawfully give birth to a child, ὄσιον εἰς τοκετὸν, Scholiast, ὅσιον is the opposite to ἱερὸν, being applied to a place or thing which may be used without profanation for the ordinary purposes of life.
In Scotland it is, or recently was, common to see advertisements that a coach will run, or an exhibition be open, "on every lawful day," meaning every day not kept sacred to divine uses.
The Acropolis was not ὅσιονεἰς τοκετὸν, not merely because, as the Scholiast ob­ serves, παρθένος ἡ θεὸς, but because it was all holy ground (see on 345 supra), one sacred temple, and, as Bergler says, " in nullo temple fas erat parere;
unde Euripides reprehenditur in Ran.
1080 quod tragoediis suis fecisset τικτούσας ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς.᾽᾽751.
τὴ ἱερὺν κυνῆν]
By the sacred helmet, Lysistrata means, in my judge­ ment, the great bronze helmet of Athene Πρόμαχος.
The article shows that this is the helmet of Athene, and not some offering taken from her treasury, as Paulmier and Enger suppose.
And although, apparently, Lysistrata had not actually seen the helmet when she pronounced it to be χαλκίον τι, yet we must, I think, understand that her sur­ mise was correct, and therefore that it was not, when exposed to view, dis­ covered to be the golden helmet of the Παρθένος.
The circumstance that the bronze helmet was irremovable would not affect its removability in a Comic Play.
And Paulmier's objection that the bronze statue was of colossal size is sufficiently answered by Bothe, who refers to 755 as showing that such must also have been the case with the helmet in question.
755.
ω̃σπερ αἱ περιστεραί] ὅτιἐν κοιλώ­ μασι τίκτουσιν.—Scholiast.
She means that she will nest in the helmet like a pigeon;
not that pigeons really nested in the helmet of the Πρόμαχος
The words ἔτ᾽ ἐν πόλει in the preceding line mean while I am still in the Acropolis.
liast.
The ἀμφιδρόμια or " running- round" ceremony consisted in carrying the child about the hearth at a running pace;
a great feast was held;
see the lines of Ephippus cited by Athenaeus ix. 10 (p. 370 C);
and presents were given by relatives and friends.
In the Theaetetus, chap. 15, Socrates compares himself to a midwife, and the dogma of which Theae­ tetus has, by his manipulation, been delivered, to a new-born child;
and adds μετὰ δὲ TOV τόκον τὰ ἀμφιδρόμια αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀληθῶς ἐν κύκλω περιθρεκτέον τῷ λόγῳ.
But as to the day on which the ceremony took place the authorities are not agreed.
The Scholiast here, as we see, places it on the tenth day after birth (which was undoubtedly the name-day, Birds 922, 923);
and Hesychius, s. v., also identifies it with the name-day.
But the same lexicographer, s. v. δρομιάμφιον ἦμαρ, places it on the seventh day, whilst the Platonic Scholiast and Suidas, s. v., place it on the fifth, the former identifying it with, and the latter distinguishing it from, the name-day.
It seems most probable that the ἀμφιδρὅμια took place on the name-day, that is, on the tenth day after birth:
for we know that on that day a great festival was held (Birds 493, 494, and the note there);
and it is unlikely that there were two festivals held within a few days of each other in honour of the child.
759.
TOV
]This is the famous ser­ pent which dwelt in the Erechtheium, and was accounted the home-keeper, οἰ­ κουρὸς, and Warder of the Temple itself (6 φύλαξ τοῦ ναοῦ, Scholiast;
ὁ φύλαξ τῆς Πολιάδος, Hesychius s. v. οἰκολρὸς, Eusta­ thius at Od. i. 357), and also, generally, the Warder of the Acropolis (6 φύλαξ τῆς ᾽Ακροπόλιος Hdt. viii. 41, Hesycbius ubi supra).
Every month a honey-cake, πελιτοῦττα, was set out for its consump­ tion, and was regularly consumed.
But when Xerxes was approaching Athens, and it was desirable that all Athenians should quit the city, the priestess announced that the cake had not been touched, and at the instigation of Themistocles declared that by this sign it was evident that the divine pro­ tection had left the city, and that the citizens too were intended to leave it.
Lysistrata's young friend should have been flattered at obtaining an actual sight of the serpent, which apparently nobody else in historic times had ever been privileged to see.761.
κακκαβιζουσῶν] hooting.
The ser­ pent was legendary, the owls were real.
There would doubtless be always a large colony of Athene's birds dwelling about her Temples in the Acropolis.
How common they were in Athens generally is evidenced by the proverb γλαῦῦ᾽ ᾽Αθή­ ναζε :
see Birds 301 and the note there.
And about a century ago Dodwell observed that the γλαῦξ is " the most common owl at Athens, and is very small and tame."
And he tells us that these birds have a particular note, of which their Greek name Koukoubagia is perfectly expressive";
Travels ii.
43. Morris (British Birds i. 164) says that the note " resembles the syllables keu, keu, keewit, or koowit."
Aristophanes in Birds 261 imitates it by κικκτβαῦ.768.
ἔστι 8' ὁ χρησμὸς οὑτοσί]
Brunck translates this Sic autem habet omculum.
But I think that οὑτοσὶ is employed δεικτικῶς, Lysistrata producing the docu­ ment which the women then call upon her to read.
Of.
Birds 1029.
The oracle would naturally be in writing, like Cleon's oracles in the opening scene of the Knights.770.
χελιδόνες]
The women are repre­ sented by the swallows, and the men by the hoopoes;
in accordance with the old Attic legend in which the swallow was Procne (or Philomela) pursued by her husband, Tereus the hoopoe.
In the name φαλῆς (the phallus personified, Ach. 263) there is an allusion to another bird, the φαληρὶς or φαλαρὶς, our coot;
see Birds 565 and the note there.
The " holy Temple " is, of course, the Acro­ polis.
See on 345 supra.774.
ἢν δὲ διαστῶσιν] if they split up into factions;
if they do not hold firmly together.
780.
With this line the women retire into the Acropolis, and we hear of no further attempt on their part to desert the cause.
Henceforth the overtures come from the men.781. μῦθν]
The stage being empty, the two Semichoruses in the orchestra again turn their attention to each other.
But even on them the spell is beginning to work, and they are not so desperately in earnest as they were before.
They now content themselves with telling each a little nursery tale reflecting on the opposite sex;
and their language and ideas are studiously simple and childish.
οὓτως, like our "
Once upon a time," was the recognized commencement of such a tale as they are about to tell.
See Wasps 1182 and the Commentary there.
Atalanta was so beautiful that men came from all lands to woo her;
so fleet of foot that no man could outrun her;
so averse to men that she would marry no suitor unless he could win a race against her, and if he failed, he must die.
Many failed, and died.
Melanion won the race, and so won Atalanta, by dropping in the course three golden apples which she, being a woman, must needs turn aside to pick up.
The story is told by Apollodorus iii.
9. 6;
and is familiar to English readers as the first tale in Morris's " Earthly Paradise."
Atalanta was a hater of men, but we nowhere hear of Melanion as a hater of women, and the Scholiast evidently thinks that the story was concocted by the old men for this particular occasion.
That he dwelt for some period in the forests all agree, and the simple statement of the old men, worded as in a nursery tale, that " he had a dog," is illustrated by Xenophon's reference to him as a mighty hunter, fond of dogs and the chase, κυνῶν καὶ κυνηγεσίν, De Venatione i. 5 and 7.
But according to the Roman poets he endured the hardships of a homeless life not from his hatred of women, but for love of Atalanta, and won from her in return that pity which is akin to love;
Ovid, Art of Love ii.
185-97;
Propertius i. 1. 9-15.797. βούλομαι κ.τ.λ.]
The Coryphaeus winds up his little apologue by proposing to kiss Stratyllis ;
but that this does not indicate a more friendly feeling on his part is shown by his still addressing her with the offensive appellation ὦ γραῦ, and his real object is disclosed by his next words.
Under pretence of kissing her, he meant to approach close to her, κἀνατείνας λακτίσαι, and to lift his foot and kick her.
And it is plain from what follows that he made as though he would carry this threat into execution.
798.
κρόμμυόν τἄρκ.τ.λ.]
Thenyou shall never eat onions again.
"Non ergo ce­ pam comedes."—Bergler.
This is a threat of the same character as the ἵνα μὴ φάγῃ σκόροδα of 689 supra ;
and here, as there, the Scholiast's explanation is οὐ πολεμήσεις.
So in Peace 1129 the Chorus, rejoicing in the advent of Peace, congratulate themselves on being quit τυροῦ Kat κρομμύων.
The Scholiast gives an alternative interpretation κλαύσει καὶ χωρὶς κρομμύων, treating ἔδει as coming not from ἐσθίω, ἔδομαι, but from δέω to be in want of;
" there is no need of an onion to make you weep ;
you will weep without that."
This is accepted by several commentators, and is represented in my translation ;
but it requires the substitution of κρομμύου or κρομμύων for κρόμμυον which is found in all the MSS.
and gives a satisfactory meaning.800.
νημχόλ] λόχμη, which properly means a copse or thicket (Birds 202), is here used of the dense growth of hair visible on the veteran's uplifted leg.
This would be particularly obnoxious to Athenian women who were careful to eradicate every superfluous hair on their own persons.
The word is used in a similar sense in Eccl.
61, where the Woman who has been training herself to pass off as a man describes her arm­ pits as λόχμης δασυτέρας.
See the note there.
801. Μυρωνίδης]
The peculiarity to which the women object is a sign of manly strength and hardihood ;
and the Men reply that in this respect they resemble the noblest of their race.
Of all the national heroes who flourished after the termination of the Persian War, Myronides—whose remarkable victories (1) over the Corinthians, and (2) over the Boeotians, B.C. 459-456, extended the Athenian supremacy by land to the utmost limits it ever at­ tained—and Phormio- whose brilliant achievements in the Corinthian gulf at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War established the Athenian supremacy by sea—appear to be the two who appealed most strongly to the mind of Aristophanes.
Myronides is mentioned again Eccl. 304, where he is styled o γεννάδας ;
and Phormio has already been mentioned in Knights 562, Peace 348.802.
μελάμπυγος]
This also was es­ teemed a sign of robust manhood;
μελάμπυγος᾽ ἀνδρεῖος.—Hesychius. μελαμ­ πύγους᾽ ἀνδρείους.—Photius.
It was a special epithet of Heracles, and all the grammarians and proverb-collectors tell the well-known story of "Heracles and the two rascals."
The two had been accustomed to prey upon the passers by ;
and their mother used to warn them to desist, lest they should one day meet with τινὸς μελαμπύγου (merely meaning as Zenobius v. 10, Gaisford, Paroem, p. 342 explains it τινὸς ἀνδρείου καὶ ἰσχυροῦ), and get the worst of it.
However they con­ tinued their practices and became such a pest to the neighbourhood that Heracles had to suppress them.
He tied their feet together, and suspended them, head downwards, on a pole which he carried over his shoulder.
Hanging in this position they had a clear view of his "nigerrimas nates."
Remembering their mother's warning and seeing how completely it was fulfilled, not only in the sense in which she spoke it, but also in its most literal sense, they both suddenly burst into fits of laughter.
Heracles, surprised at their mirth, inquired what the joke might be.
They told him, and he, being always at heart a good fellow, joined in the laugh­ ter, and finally let them go.
The inci­ dent is versified by Charles Lamb in a poem of no great merit included in his Eliana.
Here the expression means that Myronides was a very Heracles to his foes.806. ἀντιλέξαι] to say in opposition to.
I too, says the Woman, am fain to tell you a little tale, as a counterblast to your Melanion.808.
Τίμων ἦν τις]
There was one Timon.
She speaks in this vague way because she is making up a nursery story;
for at this time the name of the famous misanthrope was very well known at Athens.
See Birds 1549 and the Com­ mentary there.
The strange phraseo­ logy in which he is here described is probably intended to burlesque some expressions in the Μονότροπος of Phry­ nichus, a Comedy which competed with the "Birds."
The only fragment of that Play bearing on Timon which has reached us is full of quaint epithets, Here ἀΐδρ
υτ
ος seems to mean without settled habitation ;
homeless, τὰ πρόσωπα περιεργμένος encompassed as to his per­ son, ἀβάτοισιν ἐν σκώλοισι amidst impene­ trable thorns.
σκῶλος is said to mean a thorn by all the grammarians, Hesychius, Photius, Eustathius and the Scholia mi­ nora at Iliad xiii.
562, 564, the Scholiast here, and Suidas ;
though they also give as an alternative a pointed stake;
and that seems to be the sense in which Homer used it.
ἀπορρὼξ is an offshoot, a chip of the Erinyes.814.
ὑπὸ μίσους]
The words are intro­ duced in a somewhat unconnected man­ ner, but Stratyllis is adopting the language of the Men, supra 792.
It is apparent from the strophe that a line, consisting of a paeon and a spondee, has fallen out either before or after the present line.
The words in brackets are inserted merely to complete the sense and the metre, and not as being really what Aristophanes wrote.
815.
ἀνδράσι πονηροῖς]
Neither here, nor three lines below, is the epithet πονηροὶ intended to restrict the univer­ sality of the word ἄνδρες.
If the Scho­ liast's observation, ἐπιεκὴς ἦν καὶ ἔφευγε τοὺς πονηροὺς means that Timon did not shun all men, it is certainly wrong.
To the speaker all men are πονηροί.822. ἔδεισά γε]
ἣ εἰρωνείᾳ φησὶν, ἣ ἀληθῶς ἐφοβήθη.
—Scholiast.
This is not very illuminating, but I quote it as showing that even the old gram­ marians did not know whether the Coryphaeus is speaking in jest or in earnest.824. ἐκφανεῖς] you will expose, τὸν σά­ κανδρον᾽. τὸ γυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον.— Scholiast.
In the woman's final retort the words οὐ κομήτην are intended to contrast with the λόχμη πολλὴ of line 800.
And as to ἀπεψιλωμένον τῷ λύχνῳ see Praxagora's address to the λύχνος Eccl. 12, 13. ἀπο­ ψιλόω means to denude of hair.

538, and lines 227, 232 of the same Play.829.
ὶοὺ, ἰοὺ γυναῖκες]
The pause which ensues is broken by a cry from the battlements of the Acropolis.
Hitherto the whole business of the stage has been conducted outside the Propylaea.
If Lysistrata wishes to parley with the Men, she comes out of the Acropolis;
when the parley is over, she retires into the Acropolis, and so on.
But now for the first and only time in the Play we see the defenders not outside the Pro­ pylaea, but standing on the wall itself, and thence conversing with those out­ side.
It is possible that during the little interchange of amenities which has just passed between the two Cho­ ruses, the Acropolis had, by means of the machine called the ἐξώστρα, been pushed forward on the stage, whence at the conclusion of the scene, perhaps during the final banter between the Choruses, infra 1014-42, it is with­ drawn in the same manner.
Any­ how Lysistrata is now visible standing on the wall, at first alone, and calling to her friends inside, some of whom immediately join her.
A man is seen approaching in a frenzied state;
with him is a servant carrying a baby.
833.
Κύπρου K.T.X.]
Cythera and Cyprus were Aphrodite's favourite haunts, the scenes of her earliest appearance " when she came From barren deeps to conquer all with love."
πρω̑τον δὲ Κυθήροιϭ ζαθέοιϭιν I ̋Επλετο. ένθεν ε̋πειτα περίρρυτον ι̋κετο Κύπρ
ον.—Hesiod, Theog. 192, 193. ές Κύπρον
6' έλθου̑ϭα θυώδεα νηὸν ε̋δυνεν I Ες ΠάΦον (Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite i. 58), whence she is called in the same hymn, 293, θεὰ Κύπροιο ὲϋκτιμένης με­ δέουϭα.
And of all her appellations none were more common than θεὰ Kv­ πρις (infra 1290, cf. supra 551), ΠαΦια 'ΑΦροδίτη (supra 556), and Κυθέρεια (Ku­ προƴενη̃ Κυθέρειαν, Hymn to Aphrodite iii. 1, Theognis 1386), or in Latin Diva potens Cypri," Regina Paphi," and the like.
But it is rather surprising to find the island coupled, as here, with one of its own towns, Κύπρου καἱ ΠάΦου μεδέ­ ova-a.
She is the Goddess on whose aid and influence the women rely;
the appearance of Cinesias is a proof that she is working actively in their favour;
and she has only to go on in the same way (that is, inflaming the men with love), and success is assured.
The κυπροƴένει 'ΑΦροδίτη is acting as they hoped she would act, supra 551-4.
And accordingly at the close of the Play when Peace is established, they call it the Peace η̑ν έποίηϭε θεὰ Κύπρις.835.
Χλύης] by the chapel of Demeter Chloe, which was very near the Propy­ laea.
Pausanias (i. 22) notices it just as he reaches the Acropolis;
ε̋ϭτι δὲ Καἰ Γη̑ς ΚουροτρόΦου καἰ Δήμητρ
ος ἱερὸν Χλόης, he says, when describing that locality.
See the Commentary on Thesm.
300. Demeter, who was really Γη̑ exalted into an Olympian divinity, was called after the fresh green cornshoots, έκ τη̑ς τω̑ν Κη̋πων (qy. καρπω̑ν) Χλόης, says the Scholiast on Oed. Col. 1671.838.
Κινηϭἰας]
The Scholiast supposes that this was the notorious dithyrambic poet, who has already made his appear­ ance in the ‟Birds,” and was a per­ petual object of ridicule to the Athenian wits.
See Birds 1372 and the Corn. mentary there.
But Aristophanes would hardly have brought the dithyrambist on the stage without making some allusion to his musical and personal absurdities.
The Scholiast himself says πέπαιΧε Trapa τὸΚινει̑ν.
And Bergler seems to be right in saying that Κινη­ ϭίας and Μυρρίνη are not intended as names of real characters, but are simply concocted from Κινε̑ν and μύρτον (infra 1004) respectively.
83D. ὸπτα̑ν K.T.X.] ὸπτα̑ν, ϭτρέΦειν, and (five lines below) ϭταθεύειν are all meta­ phors from the culinary art to denote the process of roasting, tormenting and making a fool of, a person ;
and ὴπερ
ο­ πεύειν is the regular term for describing the cajoleries of a lover.
This little speech is explained by Suidas (s.v. ήπε­ ροπεύειν) rather more fully than it is by the Scholiast;
έξαπατᾶν, παραλ
ογίζεσθαι,844. άπέλθετε]
The other women now retire, leaving Lysistrata alone on the wall to parley with Cinesias below.
846.
έπἱ τροΧου̑ ϭτρεβλούμενον]
This was a well-known form of torture at Athens, Peace 452, Frogs 620, Plutus 875.
According to Plutarch (Nicias ad fin.) it was the punishment inflicted, about a year and a half before the date of the Lysistrata, on the unhappy barber who, having spread about the news of the Sicilian catastrophe, was unable to produce his authority for that state­ προεῖπεν.
According to Andocides (De Mysteriis 43, 44) Peisander proposed, amidst general applause, άναβιβάζειν έπἱ τὸν τροΧον 42 persons, some of them sena­ tors.
For the metaphorical use of the word to describe the torments and parox­ ysms of love, Bergler refers to Plautus, Cist. ii. 1.4" lactor, crucior, agitor, stimulor, versor in amoris rota miser."847.
ὲντὸς τω̑ν Φυλάκων]
There were, of course, no sentries stationed outside the Acropolis, but Lysistrata, being, as it were, the commander of a besieged fortress, is careful to use the strict, though unsuitable, military terms.
In the same spirit she calls herself, two lines below, an ήμεροϭκόπος.852.
Παιονίδης]
Παιονίδαι was really the name of an Attic deme, belonging to the tribe Leontis.
See Harpocration S.vv. Παιανιει̑ς Kai Παιονίδμι.
But here, just as Κινηϭίας involves the idea of κινει̑ν,so does Παιονίδης the idea of παίειν, a verb of the same signification.
856.
Κινηϭία τουτἰ Уένοιτο]
Here's to Cinesias.
This was the established for­ mula with which lovers, when absent, toasted and pledged each other.
And this they did, not merely, as our custom is, over their wine, but also on various other occasions.
Of.
Thesm.
403, 404.
It was in this sense that the dying Theramenes, playing cottabus-fashion with the dregs of his hemlock, ex­ claimed Κριτία του̑τ ε̋στω τω̑ καλω̃, Here's to my beautiful Critias, Xen. Hell. ii. 3 ad fin.;
Cicero, Tusc. Disp. i. 40.
He speaks of his enemy as a lover of his love ;
for καλὸς is the lover's recognized epithet.
See Ach. 144, Wasps 97-9.
We may be re­ minded of Romeo's exclamation "Here's to my love " as he drank the poison.857.
̋ω̎πρὸς τω̑ν θεω̑ν]
We are not intended, as Bothe thinks, to supply έκκάλεσον αύτήν.
The words are an ejacu­ lation of love and pleasure drawn from his excited passions by Lysistrata's grati­ fying intelligence.
860. λη̃ρός έστι τάλλα]
That all the rest are mere trash by the side of, that is, compared with, Cinesias.
See Frogs 809.863. του̑θ']
The Scholiasts give two explanations of this word, τὸαἱδοἱον and άρƴύριον.
The Commentators all adopt the former interpretation, referring it, I presume, to the δεράτινοναἱδοι̑ον with which Cinesias, and henceforth all the men on the stage, are undoubtedly furnished ;
τοὺς θάλητας εἱσήƴαƴεν έν τη̑ Λυσιστράτη, says the Scholiast on Clouds 542.
But it is quite clear from the ensuing scene that he retains this appendage;
and it is equally clear from his use of the present tense δἱδωμι, and from Lysistrata's immediate acqui­ escence, that he does at once give her ο̎περ ε̎Χει.
It seems to me therefore that the Scholiast's second interpretation is the correct one, and that Cinesias throws up to Lysistrata a βαλλάντιον or money-bag of some kind.864.
καταβα̑α K.T.λ.]
With these words Lysistrata descends from the Wall into the interior of the Acropolis, and we see no more of her until she emerges from the Propylaea infra 1106.
Cinesias, left alone on the outside of the wall, indulges in a brief soliloquy.
870.
Φιλω̑ K.T.X.]
Myrrhina now makes her appearance on the wall, speaking, as she is coming, to Lysistrata and the women behind her.
What she says is supposed to be spoken aside, but of course she intends Cinesias to overhear.
873.
σότύα' ου̎] not thither;
not in that direction.
She will not descend from the wall on the outside, where Cinesias is;
she contemplates descending from it (α̎πειμι, four lines below) in the oppo­ site direction.
879.
ΠΑΙΔΙΟΝ]
The child in this case is probably a mere puppet;
unlike the children of the Megarian in the Achar­ nians:
see the note on line 735 of that Play.
They had to move and eat.
This is a mere baby lying in its nurse's arms, save for the utterance of the word μαμ­ μἱα, which of course could be easily managed.884.
οι̑οντὸ τεκει̑ν] δεινὸν τὸ τἱκτειν, says Euripides, in the same sense, in Iph. Aul. 917.
And again in Phoenissae 355 .
After this speech Myrrhina descends from the wall into the Acropolis, and four lines later comes out through the Propylaea.
Cinesias has another soliloquy.
887.
Χα̎ δυσκολαἱνει] the way she flouts me.
α̎ is the accusative after δυσκολαἱνει, an idiom not reproducible in English.
Florent Chretien gives "
Sed quod su­ perbit et mihi est morosula I Hoc plus amore pectus exercet meum."
For 8va­ κολαἱνειν to beδύσκολος,fretful,ill-disposed, see Clouds 36, and for βρενθύεσθαι to give oneself airs, Clouds 362, Peace 26.893.
αύτή τε λυπει̑]
And you make yourself miserable.
Jason, as Brunck observes, uses the same words to Medea, Eur. Med. 1361.
Assuming the old relations between himself and Myrrhina to be now re-established, Cinesias lays hold of her in a familiar manner, ala- Χρω̑ς the Scholiast says;
an act which calls forth an immediate rebuke.896.
Κρόκης] that your rool is being pulled to pieces by the fowls.
κρόκη is properly the woof or cross-thread which is shot through the threads of the warp by the shuttle, κερκἱς.
Then it came to signify woollen threads, generally.
Φορουμένης is explained by the Scholiast to mean διαΦουμένης, διασπωμένης.901.
η̎ν δοκη̑] if such is your determina­ tion.
"si tibi ita placet.”—Brunck.
Van Leeuwen's interpretation "si visum fue­ rit, si populus iusserit" seems destruc­ tive of the wit of the passage.
Cinesias is in a mood to promise anything if only he can get Myrrhina home again;
and to say the people will make peace if they so decree," so far from being conciliatory, would be intentionally provocative.903. ὲκει̑σε] to our home, which was implied in the question οὺ βαδιει̑ πάλιν;
to which this is an answer.
άπόμνυμι means to swear off, to swear not to do a thing.904. 8ta Χρόνου] after so long a separa­ tion.
See the Commentary on Wasps 1476.
For κατακλἱθητι most recent editors, following Elmsley, read κατα­ κλἱνηθι, but though the second aorist is the more common, it seems unreason­ able to ban the first aorist when it is supported by the whole weight of the MSS.905.
ὼς or Φιλω̑]
She is loyally carry­ ing out Lysistrata's instructions καἱ Φιλει̑ν Kat μὴ ι̑ν.
Here the Φιλει̑ν is allowed to peep out.906.
ω̎ Μυρρἱνιον]
With the best MSS.
and all editions before Brunck I have retained the tribrach in the last foot of the line, a usage very rare indeed, but absolutely necessary in Frogs 1203, and see Id. 979.
And here it seems per­ missible for the purpose of introducing a pet name, the diminutive of affection.
908.
Μανη̑ς] a very common name in these Comedies for a slave.
See Peace 1146, Birds 523, 1311, 1329, infra 1212.911. τὸ του̑Πανός] sc. αὺλἱον, see supra 721 and the note there.
Pan's grotto was to be the nuptial chamber, and she was to purify herself in the adjoin­ ing spring, the Clepsydra;
see the Commentary on 328 supra.
"The ex­ cavations show that between Pan's grotto and the Clepsydra in which Myrrhina is told to bathe there cannot have been any wall such as some have supposed to exist.”
—G. F. Hill in the Classical Review, xi. 415.
It was in this cave, round which the nightingale was always singing, that Apollo wronged Creusa, and that Ion, the fruit of that wrong, was afterwards exposed by his mother.
But it was not Pan's cave then;
see Hdt. vi. 105.
Pan, says Hermes (in Lucian's Bis Accusatus 9), originally dwelt in Arcady, but came unsummoned to assist the Athenians at Marathon;
and thenceforward τὴν ὺπὸ .
And in Lucian's twenty-second Dialogue of the Gods, where Hermes, a comely and beardless youth, dismayed at the gro­ tesque appearance of Pan his alleged offspring, exclaims yέλωτα
όΦλήσω παρὰ πα̑σιν έπἱ τη̑ εὺπαιδἱα (cf. Wasps 1512), "0 you need not be ashamed of me," says Pan, " for I am quite a musician, and can play the syrinx beautifully;
and Dionysus can do nothing without .
And besides this," he adds, "I am very brave, and fought so well at Marathon that the Athenians gave me τὸ ύπὸ τη̑ άκροπλει σπήλαιον as the prize of valour." " Well, well," says Hermes, "let us be good friends in future;
but one thing I charge you as a dutiful son;
never call me father when any one is within hearing."
The words is πόλ in the following line mean into the Acropolis.917.
μὰ τὸν 'Απόλλω]
Why does Myrr­ hina use an oath which is proper only for men ?
οὺκ ε̋στιν ο̋ρκ
ος yυνικων, says the Scholiast, truly;
cf. Eccl. 160 and the note there.
Possibly she is thinking of his connexion with Pan's grotto, as mentioned in a preceding note.918.
κατακλινω̑ xαμαί]
I will not let you lie (literally, I will not lay you) on the ground, Καίπερ τοιου̑τον ο̋ντα.
The Com­ mentators give various interpretations of TOLOVTOV, none of which seem to me accurate.
In my opinion it means such a man, so loveable and dear to me.
In the Fourteenth Iliad Zeus is so en­ amoured of Hera as (to use the language of Plato,'Republic iii. 4, p. 390 C) μηδ́́ είς τὸ δωμάτιον έθέλειν έλθείν, aXX' αύτου̑ βουλόμενον χαμαὶ ξυууίуνεϭθαι.
But Myrrhina, though equally enamoured of Cinesias, will not follow the example of Zeus.
We see by the next line that Cinesias takes her language as a proof of her love for himself.
She now re­ turns into the Acropolis, but imme­ diately re-emerges, carrying a bare bed without any bedding.921. τὸ δεῖνα]
What was it ?
So again five lines below and 1168 infra.
The force of this dilatory ejaculation is suf­ ficiently explained and illustrated in the Commentary on Peace 268 and Wasps 524.
I will here only add one other example taken from the twelfth of Lucian's Courtesan-Dialogues.
There Lysias finds his ladylove in a very com­ promising situation with a young person whom he supposes to be a man, but who in reality is a girl named Pythias.
Pythias had been obliged, in an illness, to have her head shaved, and her hair was now as short as a boy's, of which she was grievously ashamed.
Usually to hide her disgrace she wore a wig, but she was not wearing it when Lysias caught her with his ladylove.
So, in order to exculpate her friend, she allows her sex to be revealed, and the loss of her hair to be explained;
but concludes by saying πλὴν, TO δεῖνα, opo, ὦ Averia, μή τινι εἴπῃς τὸ 7rept τῆς κόμης, But, what was I going to say ?— 0 yes, but pray, Lysias, don't tell anybody about my hair.
Ψίαθος is a rush-mat, often used as a mattress.
τας ἐγκοιμητηρίας ψιάθους χαμεύνας ἐκάλουν.—Pollux vi. 11. ψίαθος. ἡ χαμεύνη.—Hesychius.923. ἐπὶ τόνου] on the bare bed-cords.
τόνος is used collectively for τόνοι, the bed-cords on which the bed-clothes would be spread.
τὸ τῇ κλίνῃ ἐντεταμένον ὡς φέρειν τὰ τυλεῖα (the bed-clothes), says Pollux x. 36, is σπαρτία, τόνος, κειρία.
Herodotus (ix. 118) says that the Persians besieged in Sestos by the Athe­ nians under Xanthippus were reduced by famine to such straits ὥστε ὥστε .924.

An exclamation of de­ light at the sweetness of Myrrhina's kiss.
So in the next year's Comedy, the Scythian, kissed by Elaphium, cries out ὂ ὂ ὂ παπαπαπαῖ, Thesm.
1191.928. ‛Ηρακλῆς ξενίζεται] is having the entertainment of Heracles;
that is, is kept waiting for his supper.
Bergler refers to Wasps 60 ‛Ηρακλῆς τὸ δεῖπνον ἐξαπατώμενος, where the Scholiast tells us that in some earlier Comedies Heracles was represented as a guest invited to a supper party, and in a terrible way, because the feast was so long in making its appearance.929. νἀίστασ’]
He is already lying on the ψίαθος, and she tells him to lift himself up that she may slip the pillow underneath him.
ἴνα προσκεφάλαιον αὐ­ τῷ θῇ.

ἄκναπτον ἱμάτιον καὶ παχὺ ἡ σισύρα—Scholiast.
In these Comedies it generally, though not in­ variably, signifies a bed-wrap, Clouds 10, Birds 122, Eccl. 347.938.
βούλει μυρίσω σε ;

As if he were a bridegroom.
See Peace 8G2 and the note there.943.
εἰ μὴ διατριπτικόν] εἰ μὴ sed contra, see Thesm.
898 and the Commentary there.
διατριπτικὸν, smacking of delay, διατριβῆς γέμον καὶ βραδυτῆτο as the Scholiast says.
It seems to have had a somewhat similar flavour to that of the Ten Years'
Treaty-sample in Ach.
193.
The objection which Cinesias takes to this unguent gives Myrrhina a further opportunity for delay, and she now pre­ tends that she has brought the wrong ointment-box.944.
τὸ ‘Ρόδιον] οὐ τὸ Σύριον.—Scholiast.
We must, I think, understand Myrrhina to be apologizing to her husband for having brought him an unguent which was οὐχ ἡδὺ (deliberately misunder­ standing him), and to mean that she had brought the worse kind by mistake;
she intended to bring the Syrian, and by some error has brought the Rhodian.
Yet the Rhodian was in later times highly esteemed.
" Crocinum in Soils Ciliciae," says Pliny xiii.
2, "diu maxime laudatum ;
mox Rhodi " ;
or, as Phile­ mon Holland translates it, " the oint­ ment of saffron confected at Soli in Cilicia imported for a good while and carried the praise alone ;
but soone after that of Rhodes was every man's money."
On the other hand, perfumery unguents originally came from the East.
The Persians, according to Pliny xiii.
1, invented them.
And as regards the Syrian in particular, we know from the Gospel narratives what " very costly ” perfumes were used in the Holy Land.
If indeed it were true, as Van Leeuwen thinks, that Rhodes had lately revolted from Athens, we could well understand that the Athenians might have enjoyed any remark tending to depreciate, how­ everunjustly, the island and its products;
butitis,to say the least, extremely doubt­ ful if the revolt had taken place when the Lysistrata was written,Thuc. viii.
44.945. ληρεῖς ἔχων]
You keep talking nonsense.
The same words are used in Birds 341, and also in Frogs 512 where see the note.
Myrrhina now re-enters the Acropolis, and at once returns with the right ointment.
During her short absence Cinesias relieves himself by in­ voking a curse on the inventor of un­ guents.
As to ἀλάβαστον see Ach.
1053 and the note there.
By ἕτερον in line 947 he means penem scorteum.949.
ποιήσω ταῦτα] that is κατακείσομαι.
And to show that she is in earnest she adds that she is already taking off her shoes.951.
βουλεύσομαι] consilium inibo.
But what he means we cannot say, for be­ fore he has gone further Myrrhina dis­ appears into the Acropolis, and he finds that she has been playing him false throughout.
The jade is gone με ἀποδεί­ ρασα “me nudata glande relinquens."

Cinesias is alone on the stage.
The old men in the orche­ stra condole with him in approved Tragic style.962.
ποῖος γὰρ ἂν K.T.X.] παρὰ τὰ ἐξ ’Ανδρομέδας " ποῖαι λιβάδες, Troia Σειρήν " ;
—Scholiast.
The Scholiast's language does not mean that Aristophanes is parodying the passage in the Andro­ meda, but merely that there is a resem­ blance between that passage and this.
So on Wasps 1326 the Scholiast says The Andromeda was in fact exhibited in the same year as the Lysistrata.
See the Introduction to the Thesmophoria­ zusae, pp. xxxvii, xxxviii.
In the line quoted from the Andromeda we should probably read λιθάδες for λιβάδες.
The speaker seems to be wondering at the rocks of the sea-coast, and the Siren­ like figure of Andromeda exposed among them.970.

The Men's Chorus natu­ rally side with the man, and condole with him on the treatment he has re­ ceived from a vile and abominable woman.
The Women's Chorus as natu­ rally side with the woman, and in the present line express their affection and admiration of her conduct.
Thereupon the Men reiterate their abuse of the woman, and add an elaborate impreca­ tion, praying that she may be carried away by a whirlwind, and presently be dashed to earth again.
The impreca­ tion, however, concludes with four words, introduced παρὰ προσδοκίαν, which en­ tirely change its character.
Perhaps the following lines (they can hardly be called a translation) may give the English reader a general idea of the turn which the dialogue takes.
MEN.
All this woe she has wrought you, she only, the Utterly hateful, the utterly vile.
WOMEN.
Not so;
but the darling, the utterly sweet.
MEN.
Sweet, sweet, do you call her ?
Vile, vile, I repeat.
Zeus, send me a storm and a whirlwind, I pray, To whisk her away, like a bundle of hay, Up, up, to the infinite spaces, And toss her and swirl her, and twist her, and twirl her, Till, tattered and torn, to the earth she is borne, To be crushed-in my ardent embraces.974.

And in the treatise περὶ κόσμου (if that be his), chap.
iv, he distinguishes be- tween the three ;
τὸ δ’ ἀστράψαν ἀναπυ­ ἄπυρον ἦ παντελῶς, τυφών.
The meaning seems to be that κεραυνὸς signifies forked lightning, or what we call a thunder­ bolt ;
πρηστὴρ a thunderstorm with only sheet lightning;
and τυφὼν a tornado without any lightning at all.
But the distinction is not always kept up.
Here we have τυφὼν and πρηστὴρ combined.
Erycius in his fourteenth epigram says of a shepherd killed by lightning that the cattle will hear his pipe no more ;
ὤλεσε γὰρ πρηστήρ σε κεραύνιος. Dio­ genes Laertius (Zeno 154), giving the opinions of Zeno and others on meteoro­ logical questions, says that some define τὰ κοιλώματα τῆς γῆς.
But most of the old grammarians describe a τυφῶνα as a vaporous whirlwind which precedes a thunderstorm ;
the Scholiast here, Suidas, Photius, Etym.
Magn.975.
ξυστρέψας καὶ ξυγγογγυλίσας] haviny twisted up and rolled into a ball.
The words are repeated in Thesm.
61.980. πᾶ τᾶν ’Ασανᾶν] ἀντὶ τοῦ, ποῦ των ’Αθηνῶν ἐστὶν ἡ γερουσία ;
ποῦ εἰσὶ καὶ οἱ πρυτάνεις, οἶς θέλω TL νέον εἰπεῖν.—Scho­ liast.
μυσίδδειν for μυθίζειν as supra 94, infra 1076.
Cinesias has left the stage, and now enter on the one side the Lacedaemonian herald, and on the other the Magistrate whom we have not seen since line 614.
Hitherto the contro­ versy has been between the Athenian men and the Athenian women ;
but the spell has been working at Sparta too, as well as amongst the Athenian hus­ bands ;
and now the two protagonists of the War—Athens and Sparta—both suffering under the same misfortune, are equally anxious to come to terms.
γερωχία (that is γερουσία) was the cus­ tomary name of the Senate in Dorian states.982.
Κονίσαλος] δαίμων πριαπώδης.— Scholiast.
He seems to have been a local Priapus, peculiar to Attica.
Strabo (xiii. 1. 12), speaking of the city Priapus (near Cyzicus), says that the deity Priapus was of comparatively re­ cent introduction, οὐδὲ yap ‘Ησίοδος οἷδε Πρίαπον, ἀλλ’ ἔοικε τοῖς ’Αττικοῖς ’Ορθάνῃ καὶ Κονισάλῳ.
Both Orthanes and Conisalus are mentioned by Plato Co­ micus in his "Phaon," as deities of the Priapean order;
Athenaeus x. 58.
Hesychius explains Κονίσαλος by κονιορ­ τὸς, σκίρτησις σατυρικὴ ἡ τῶν ἐντεταμένων τὰ αἰδοῖα.
In Homer it is always equiva­ lent to κονιορτός.
It has already been noticed that all the men on the stage are now wearing the penem scorteum.
The Herald appears to be endeavouring to conceal his underneath his garments.983. ὦ κυρσάνιε]
The herald is an im­ portant personage and the flippant language of the Athenian is calculated to cheapen his dignity.
He shows his resentment by addressing the elderly magistrate as ὦ κυρσάνιε, my lad, a term which, though properly applicable only to a youth, was employed, irrespective of age, to show the slight regard in which the person addressed was held by the speaker.
It occurs again infra 1248, where the Scholiast says κυρσανίους KU­ λοῦσιν οἱ Αάκωνες τὰ μειράκια, καὶ τοὺς εὐτελεῖς ἀνθρώπους.
And to the same effect the Ravenna Scholiast here ;
ἀντὶ τοῦ εὐτελέστατε.
The " twa' Gudes," τὼ σιὼ, in the mouth of a Spartan are Castor and Polydeuces.985.
ὑπὸ μάλης] under your armpit, μάλη being an abbreviated form of pau­ χάλη, as, in Latin, ala of axilla.
The phrase is quite a common one, generally in reference to a dagger concealed under the left armpit, whence the bearer could most easily pluck it out with his right hand, Merivale's "Romans under the Empire," chap. 26. Thus, when Critias had determined on the destruction of Theramenes, he brought into the Council-chamber a number of young men ξιφίδια ὑπὸ μάλης eXoPTas, Xen.
Hell.
ii.
3. 23.
And when the mutually suspicious triumvirs—Octa­ vius, Antony, and Lepidus—met, unac­ companied, on the islet of the Reno near Bologna, ἀλλήλους διηρεύνησαν μὴ καὶ ξιφίδιόν τις ὑπὸ μάλης ἔχοι, Dio Cassius xlvi. 55 (p. 326).
But in Heliodorus (ii. 30) it is a jewel-case, and in Alciphron (iii. 26) a purloined garment, that is carried ὑπὸ μάλης.
Here the expression δόρυ ὑπὸ μάλης is intentionally grotesque ;
for a spear could not, as a dagger might, be con­ cealed beneath the armpit;
nor was the protuberance to which the Magis­ trate is alluding anywhere in that direction.
987.
προβάλλει τὴν χλαμύδ’ ;
] hold out your robe in front of you.
The chlamys was a riding or military garment (Pollux x. 124) apparently much in vogue at Sparta;
Juvenal viii.
101. The herald holds it out before him to con­ ceal the tell-tale protuberance.
The Magistrate suggests that possibly his hurried journey from Sparta may have brought on swellings in the groin.
See Wasps 277 and the note there.990.
μηδ’ αὖπλαδδίη]
Don't keep play­ ing thefool.
Cf. supra 171.991. σκυτάλα Λακωνικά]
The "Laconian scytale " has been described by many writers, but by none more lucidly than by Plutarch in his Life of Lysander, chap.
19. ἔστι δὲ ἡ σκυλη τοιοῦτον, he says:
" when a general is dispatched on active service, the Ephors take two round rods, of exactly the same size, and corresponding in every particular.
One of these they give to the general, and the other they retain themselves.
These are the scytales.
And when they want to send a private message to the general, they take a long and narrow strip of parchment and wind it spirally round and round the retained scytale so as to cover the entire surface with­ out leaving any gap.
On the parch­ ment while so wound round the scytale they write the message, and then taking the parchment off they send it to the general without the scytale.
It is then a quite illegible scrawl of disconnected letters till the general,- winding it round his own scytale, restores the continuity of the writing."
It is sur­ prising that two such eminent scholars as Colonel Mure and Mr. Grote, in their interesting controversy (originally in pamphlet form, but also given as ap­ pendices to the later editions of Colonel Mure's History, vol. iii, and of Mr. Grote's, vol. ii) as to the knowledge possessed by the Spartans of the art of writing, should have drawn any inference from the present passage as to the mode in which the scytale was carried.
They might as well have inferred from the reference to the δόρυ above that the Spartans were accustomed to carry spears under their armpits.
The al­ lusion to the σκυτάλη here is a mere joke.
The Magistrate is a wag, and keeps driving the herald into a corner by his impertinent questions, till the latter, at a loss how to meet the other's prying curiosity, attributes the protuberance to a σκυτάλη.
"It is no more a σκυτάλη than this is," says the Magistrate pointing to his own σκύτινον αἰδοῖον, where αὕτη is employed either as agreeing with Ψωλὴ understood, or (more probably) as the feminine by attraction to σκυτάλη.995.
ὀρσὰ Λακεδαίμων πᾶα] that is, ὀρθὴ Λακεδαίμων πᾶσα.
In ordinary language this would mean that all the Lacedae­ monians were on the tiptoe of excite­ ment.
Many instances of this usage are given in the Lexicons.
ὀρθὴ δὲ ἦν ἡ πόλις ἐπὶ τοῖς συμβεβηκόσιν (the defeat at Chaeroneia), Lycurgus against Leo­ crates 39 (p. 152).
ὀρθὴ καὶ περίφοβος ἦν ἡ πόλις (whilst the opposing armies were preparing for the battle of Cannae), Polybius iii. 112, and so on.
But here it means that the Spartans are in the condition which in the next words is predicated of the allies, ἐστύ­ καντι for ἐστύκασι.996.
Πελλάνας δὲ δεῖ] ὄνομα γυναικὸς έταίρας. ἐπιθυμοῦσιν οὖν τῆς πόρνης, ἤγουν τῆς πόλεως Πελλήνης.
ἀντεποιοῦντο γἀρ αὐτῆς οἱ Λάκωες.—Scholiast.
Some recent Commentators have cast doubt on the Scholiast's statement, but in my opinion it is quite accurate.
Even if it is merely an inference from the present passage, it is a natural and I think a correct inference.
As to the city Pel­ lene, the most easterly of the Achaean cities, we know that at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War it was the only one of them which sided with Sparta, Thuc. ii.
9. Though itself at some distance from the sea, it was neverthe­ less a naval power, and we are told that at this very time the Spartans were requisitioning Pellene to contribute, in conjunction with Sicyon and Arcadia, a detachment of ten vessels to the con­ federate fleet which was mustering for the downfall of Athens, Thuc. viii.
3. And possibly the anxiety of Sparta to obtain the aid of so petty a state may have given some occasion for ridicule.998. ἀπὸ Πανός;
]
The Commentators think it sufficient to observe that Pan was “libidinosus et ἐρωτικός but that is a very inadequate explanation.
The suggestion that this strange upset was caused by Pan is due to the fact that all sudden commotions and disturbances of the mind were attributed to his in­ fluence ;
see Erasmus's Adages " Panicus casus."
The Herald, however, takes a more prosaic view, and ascribes the epidemic not to Pan but to Lampito, who had been vigorously carrying out the policy determined upon by herself, Lysistrata, and the rest at the com­ mencement of the Play.1000.
ᾇπερ ἀπὸμιᾶς ὑσπλαγίδος] as at a given signal.
ὥσπερ ἀπὸμιᾶς ὕσπληγος, cf. Plato Phaedrus 35 (p. 251 E).
The barrier from which racers started was formed by an outstretched rope which kept the competitors in an even line, and fell when the signal was given.
This rope was called ὕσπληξ and is frequently mentioned by ancient writers.
Antipater Sidonius (Epigram 39) speaks of a runner so fleet that he was visible only at the ὕσπληξ and at the winning post, and could not be seen while passing from one to the other;
and Lucian introduces the same idea into his Timon (20), where Πλοῦτος says that he approaches a man with such tardy and halting footsteps that may­ hap the man grows old before his ar­ rival ;
but when he leaves him he makes himself wings, and has hardly left the starting-place before he is at the goal, moving with such speed that no eye can behold him ;
ἅμα γοῦν ἔπεσεν ἡ ὕσ-1002.
μογίομες· ἄν]
For μογέομεν· ἀνά.
We are in sore trouble;
we go-up and down the streets twisting ourselves round, like people carrying lighted lamps.
Such people cannot walk in an upright po­ sition, but must needs stoop and bend themselves about to shelter the lights from the wind.
The words τῶ μύρτω σιγῆν are explained by the Scholiast to mean θιγεῖν TO γυναικείου μορίου, and ἐῶντι stands for ἐῶσι.
The concluding words of the speech, ποττὰν ‛Ελλάδα, are rather strange, but must mean with our Hel­ lenic antagonists," so as to make a general cessation of war throughout Hellas.1013, πωτάομαι]
I'll fly like the wind.
δραμοῦμαι, πετήσομαι.—Scholiast.
The word is Homeric.
The Spartan herald now hastens out to return to Sparta;
the πρόβουλος retires in the opposite direction to advise the Athenian βουλή.
The stage being empty, the two Semi­ choruses in the orchestra once more, and for the last time, direct their at­ tention to each other.
But a change has come over the spirit of the Women.
They have already come down from fierce denunciation to playful banter, and now they set themselves to win over their opponents with little tricks of coquetry which the Men are unable to resist.
The twenty-two lines which follow are in a compound or disjointed (ἀσυνάρτητος) metre;
the first half being a trochaic dimeter, ὡς. ἐγὠ μισῶν γυναῖκας ;
and the second a paeonic dimeter (a paeon and cretic) οὐδέποτε παύσομαι.
It differs from the ordinary trochaic tetra­ meter only by having the eleventh sylla­ ble short instead of long ;
as for example, if in line 1025 κἄν με μὴ λυπῇς, ἐγώ σου κἂν τόδε τὸ θηρίον we substitute ΤΟδὶ for roSE, we have a perfect trochaic tetra­ meter.
And in line 1036 the compound metre does in truth change into the simple trochaic.1014.
ἀμαχώτερ
ον, οὐδὲ πῦρ]
This wet­ pon again the Men appear to have drawn from the great armoury which the Tragedies of Euripides supply for the vituperation of women.
Stobaeus, under the head of Passages in censure of women, Ψόγος γυναικων (Anthology, Title 73), gives, amongst many others, the following quotations from Euripides,1018.
μισῶν γυναῖκας]
This again has the genuine Euripidean ring.
ὄλοισθε· μισῶν οὔποτ’ ἐμπλησθήσομαι I γυναῖκας.— Hipp. 664.
For the ὡς at the com­ mencement of the line see the note on Wasps 416.1019.
ἀλλ’ ὅταν βούλῃ σύ]
That you can do when you like.
The sentence is left imperfect, and we can supply either, with the Scholiast, you can have me as a friend, or, with Blaydes, VOlt can gire over hating its.
They are putting aside the general argument, and are going to show, by their actions, how indispensable they are to the men.1023.
ὀργῆς πονρᾶς] ill-temper, Wasps 243.
The epithet refers to πονηρὸν in the preceding line.
There is no πονηρία in your action ;
the πονηρία was in my temper when I threw off my ἐξωμίς ;
see the Commentary on 658 supra.
As to τότε then, when I threw it off, see on Thesm.
13.1027. δακτύλιος οὑτοσί]
The Scholiast's explanation that the speaker is giving Stratyllis a ring wherewith to scoop out (ἐκσκαλεύειν, literally, to hoe out, from σκαλὶς, a hoe) the insect from his eye­ δίδωσιν αὐτῇ δακύλιον ἵναἐξενέγκῃ τὴν ἐμκίδα τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ—although adopted by many Commentators, seems to me foreign to the ordinary style and phraseology of Aristophanes.
And I en­ tirely agree with Bergler and Brunck that the name δακτύλιος, with a play on δάκνειν, is given to the gnat itself.
" Culicem δακτύλιος appellat," says the latter, " derivato nomine a δακεῖν, quare reddidi mordaeulus ille.”
The conver­ sation is carried on by Stratyllis and the Coryphaeus, but I apprehend that each of the twelve men who form the Men's Chorus simultaneously submits his eye to the inspection of one of the twelve women who form the Chorus of Women.1032.
ἐμπὶς Τρικορυσία] ὡς ἐν Τρικούθῳ πολλῶν ἐμπίδων γινομένων.
ἔστι γὰρ ἀλσὠδης [perhaps we should read ἑλώδης, Pausanias i. 32. 6] καὶ κάθυγος.—Scho­ liast.
Tricorythus was one of the four villages of the Marathonian Tetrapolis, supra 285.
Τρικόρυθον πόλιν, ἥτις ἐστὶ μία τῆς ὀνομαζομένης Τετραόλεως.
—Diod.
Sic. iv. 57.
The region was noted for its marshes;
in one of which indeed the greatest slaughter of the Persians took place at the battle of Marathon (Pau­ sanias ubi supra) :
an incident por­ trayed in the battle-frescoes of the Poecile, Id. i. 15.
4. As a natural result of this marshy soil the district was haunted by mosquitoes (cf. Birds 244-6) which'still drive the inhabitants, in summer, to the higher grounds, Leake ii. 87;
Wordsworth's Athens and Attica, chap. vi.
The ruins of the village are still visible in the plain of Suli.
This allusion to the marshes of Marathon is probably intended as a covert compliment to the old Mapa­ θωνομάχαι.1036.
ἤν re βούλῃ γ’ ἤν τε μή]
Will you, nill you.
Of. supra 939, Eccl. 981, 1097, Plato, Theaetetus, chap. 20 (p. 167 D), and frequently elsewhere.
She is using a sort of coaxing compulsion.1037.
μὴ ὥρασ’ ἵκοισθ’] "
Male pereatis, ut estis ingenio ad blandiendum com­ posito," Brunck, slightly altered from Bergler.
The phrase is sufficiently illustrated in the Commentary on 391 supra.1039.
οὔτε σὺνπανωλέθροισιν]
English readers will remember the comments in Lytton's " My Novel," Book IV, chap. 1, on the " damnable doctrine of Metellus Numidicus," who,with all the dignity and authority of a Roman Censor, declared " Si sine uxore, Quirites, possemus esse, omnes ea molestia careremus;
set!
quoniam ita Natura tradidit, ut nec cum illis satis commode, nec sine illis ullo modo vivi possit, saluti perpetuae potius quam brevi voluptati eonsulendum.”
Aulus Genius i. 6. It was probably from this source that Martial derived his well-known epigram (xii. 47) :
Diffieilis, facilis, iucundus, acerbus es idem :
Nee tecum possum vivere, nec sine to.
The notion was a favourite one with our comic dramatists;
see for example the song in Act I, Scene 2 of Prince Hoare's " Lock and Key."
Brunck refers to Susarion's lines cited in the Commen­ tary on Thesm.
787 ;
and Dindorf to Strabo xiv. 2. 24 (p. 659), where speak­ ing of the two orators, contemporary with himself, of Mylasa, he tells us that Hybreas wound up one of his speeches by saying to Euthydemus, Εὐθύδημε, κακὸν εἶ τῆς πόλεως ἀναγκαῖον· οὔτε γὰρ μετὰ σοῦ δυνάμεθα ζῆν, οὔτ’ ἄνευσοῦ.1042. συσταλέντες] closing our ranks, combining our forces.
Cf. Wasps 424.
Henceforth there is no Semichorus of Men or Semichorus of Women.
The two are combined into one Chorus.
They make, in the language of the Greek Argument, ἕνα χορὸνἐκ τῆς διχορίας.1043.
οὐ παρασκευαζόμεσθα]
The two Choruses inaugurate their union by commencing a series of four stanzas, two here and two infra 1189, which like those in Birds 1470, 1553, and 1694 are entirely disconnected with the general plot of the Comedy, and are all linked together by the conjunctive particle δέ.
Each stanza consists of seventeen lines, of which eleven are trochaic (nine dimeters and two dipo­ dies), and the remaining six (the fourth to the ninth inclusive in each stanza) eretico-paeonic dimeters, the third hav­ ing a monosyllabic base.
And the same vein of pleasantry runs through the four, consisting of large and liberal offers made by the Chorus, with an intimation that they have no power or no intention of fulfilling them.
Each stanza, in effect, contains what school­ boys call "a sell."
Come and help yourselves to our money, they say in the first stanza, only ourpurses are all empty.
Come to our house andfeast, in the second, only you will find the door barred against you.
Come and share our treasures, in the third, only if you find any, you must have sharper eyes than we.
And come to our housefor bread, in the last, only beware of the dog, and don't approach the door.
liast.
"Satmultaenimsuntmala,ethaec praesentia.”—Bergler.
The Scholiast's explanation of τὰ παρακείμενα is not very satisfactory, but on the whole I think it must be accurate.
The Chorus wish to put a stop to two things :
(1) the War, and (2) the discord between the men and the women.
The position of καὶ between ra κὰκα and τὰ παρακείμενα shows that it must have its usual conjunctive force of connecting two distinct things and can­ not here be used in the sense of " even."1049.
ἐπαγγελλέτω] let him, or her, tell it out.
λεγέτω τίνος δεîται.—Scholiast.
If any man or woman wants to get any money let him, or her, proclaim the fact.1053.
πόλλ’ ἔσω γὰρ κέν’ ἔχομεν] κενὰ βαλλάντια, empty purses.
κενὰ προσερ­ ρίπτουν βαλλάντια.—Plutarch, Lucullus, chap. 35.
I have substituted the words given above for the unmetrical and un­ meaning reading of the MSS.
ὡς πόλλ’ ἔσω ’στὶν κἄχομεν.
The statement that the purses are empty, and that therefore there is no money for the applicants to receive seems necessary ;
otherwise this stanza, unlike all the rest, would contain no " sell," but would be a bona fide offer of a money-gift.
This too would destroy the humour of the last words of the stanza, and make them not a joke but a further boon.
And Burges's emenda­ tion, which most editors adopt, ὡς πλέα ’στὶν ἄχομεν, instead of removing, merely accentuates the absurdity.1057.
μηκέτ’ ἀποδῷ]
As they would have received nothing, there was nothing to repay.
The words are introduced, as the Scholiast says, παρ’ ὑπόνοιαν.1058.
Καρυστίους] διαβάλλονται ὡς μοι­ χοὶ οἱ Καρύστιοι.—Scholiast both here and again on 1181 infra.
The descrip­ tion καλούς τε κἀγαθούς is merely ironical.
The people of Carystus, a considerable town in the south of Euboea, were sup­ posed to be a remnant of one of the old pre-Hellenic populations, Time. vii. 57, Diod.
Sic. iv. 37.
That a large number of these aboriginal allies were at this very time stationed within the walls of Athens we know from Thucydides (viii. 69), who tells us that 300 of them were in the service of the Four Hundred.
And it may perhaps be inferred, from the way in which they are mentioned here and again in 1182 infra, that they had rendered themselves notorious by their uncouth manners and their gross and licentious behaviour.1060.
κἄστιν ἔτ’ ἔτνος] ἔτι, omitted in the MSS., was restored by Reisig, and it is obvious that it might readily have dropped out before ἔτνος.
The meaning seems to be we have still these provisions at home, notwithstanding the long strug­ gle that has for so many days been going on between the men and the women.1065.
τήμερ
ον πρῲ δὲ χρή]
This is the sort of invitation which Euelpides wished to receive, Birds 129-32.
But if we are to take πρῲ in the sense of the early morning the present invitation is one which it would be impossible to accept, for Comedies were acted in the afternoon.1071.
κεκλεισεται] παρ’ ὑπόνοιαν, δέον ἀνεωχθήσεται.—Scholiast.
With this word the Chorus conclude their second stanza, and the plenipotentiaries whom the Herald had gone to fetch from Sparta are seen approaching.1072.
ἔλκοντες ὑπήνας] ἔχοντες πώγωνας.
— Scholiast.
And this is no doubt the meaning, for ὑπήνη, though sometimes confined to the moustache, the hair on the upper lip, and so contrasted with πώγων, is more commonly used for the beard generally, and so is undistinguish­ able from πώγων.
‘Υπήνη μύσταξ, τὸ γέ­ νειον, πώγων, ἢ ἡ TOV ἄνω χείλους τρίχωσις.
—Photius, Suidas.
‘Υπήνη τὸ γένειον, ἤτοι πώγων, ἂλλοι μύστσξ.
—Hesychius.
On the overgrowth of the Spartan beards see Wasps 476 and the note there.
The participle ἔλκοντες, probably from its use in this passage, is frequently found in later Greek writers in connexion with ὑπήνας or πώγωνας.
It is generally em­ ployed in a sort of contemptuous sense with reference to philosophers who in this, as in other points, were accustomed to ape the habits and attire of the ancient Lacedaemonians.

χοιροκομεῖον] a pig-cage, literally a place for tending pigs in.
Compare ἱπποκομεῖν Peace 74.
It was a sort of hurdlework, probably forming three sides of a square, the fourth side being formed by the wall against which it was placed.
In Wasps 844 it is used as the Court railing, δρύφακτος, within which Philocleon is to carry on his judicial duties.
The meaning of the word is given quite rightly by the Scholiast on the Wasps and here, Polluxx.
159, Hesychius, and Suidas.
The other signification suggested by the Scholiast and Suidas, viz.
πάτταλος ἐν ᾧ δεσμύουσι τοὺς χοίρ
ους, arises merely from a faulty interpreta­ tion of the passage before us.
The tunics of the plenipotentiaries are dis­ tended to such an extent that the Chorus liken the distention to the familiar pen within which their pigs were confined..1078.
νενεύωται] is high-strung.
τὴν ἔντασιν τοῦ αἰδοίου λέγει.—Scholiast.
τεθερμῶσθαι means to be inflamed;
but it is possible that on the stage the speaker was instructed so to pronounce the word as if the division were not τε-θερμῶσθαθαι, but τεθ-ἑρμῶσθαι, so as to recall to the minds of the audience the famous ‘Ερμαῖ which are more particu­ larly mentioned a little later in the dialogue;
infra 1094.
And this is pro­ bably what the Scholiast meant by his explanation of the present line, ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐντέταται μεγάλως, Some have thought that the Scholiast must have had a dif­ ferent reading before him ;
but it seems to me probable that he considered, and quite possible that he rightly considered, the word τεθερμῶσθαι to involve a play on the name 'Ερμῆς with which of course it really had nothing whatever to do.
Bergler.
Let somebody come, and get us Peace in whatever way he pleases.1082.
καὶ μὴν ὁρῶ]
To the Lacedae­ monian plenipotentiaries waiting on the stage, enter from the opposite side the Athenian plenipotentiaries whom the Magistrate had bidden the Council to send.
The Chorus give them the name of αὐτόχθονες, a name always pleasant to Athenian ears.
See Wasps 1076 and the note there.
They make their ap­ pearance holding out their garments before them just like wrestlers" say the Chorus.
In Peace 34 the beetle, attacking his food, κύψας and παρβαλὼν τοὺς γομφίους is similarly compared to a wrestler.
In the present passage we are, I suppose, intended to understand that the Athenians bending forward and gripping their garments are somewhat in the attitude of wrestlers gripping, or preparing to grip, their immediate antagonists.
But in truth the compari­ son seems to be introduced merely for the purpose of leading up to the expres­ sion ἀϭκητικὸν νόσημα, which, as Bentley pointed out (at Peace 1176), is intended as a play upon σἀκιτικὸν νόσημα or ἀσκίτης νόσ
ος, the dropsy.1088.
χαὔτη ξυνᾴδει
And this other disease from which you are suffering is on all fours with this, from which the Laconians are suffering.
You have the ἀσκητικὸν νόσημα as well as they.
And to ascertain the facts, the speaker pro­ ceeds in the following line to inquire into the symptoms, asking whether the sufferers feel the attack most keenly of a morning, πρὸς ὄρθρον.
Cf. supra 966, Ach. 256.
The fact that the same demonstrative pronoun (αὕτη, ταύτη) is applied to both sides, as in Eccl.
1070, would create no difficulty in the acting, where the speaker would point first to the one and then to the other.
See the note on Eccl. 1053.1090.
ταυτὶ δρῶντες] faring thus.
The last two words of this speech are intro­ duced παρὰ προσκίαν.
About Cleis­ thenes, who for his gross effeminacy was the constant butt of Aristophanes for twenty years, from Acharnians 117, 118 to Frogs 422, see the Commentary on those passages.
The Scholiast here says of him, οὗτος Σιβυρτίον παῖς, ἐπὶ θηλύτητι κωμῳδούμενος, but the statement as to his parentage is in all probability derived merely from the passage in the Acharnians.1093.
θαἰμάτια λήψεσθε]
The Athe­ nians, we know, are using their ἱμάτια to conceal their woful plight;
but it would seem that the Laconians have discarded theirs, and that this warning is specially addressed to them;
see infra 1096, 1098, 1099.1094. 'Ερμοκοπιδῶν]
He means the persons who effected the famous muti­ lation of the Herniae shortly before the departure of the great armament for Sicily.
These Hermae were quadran­ gular busts of stone (Thuc. vi. 27) with a rudely-shaped head at the top, and the phallus emblem protruding in front;
see Hdt. ii. 51. And the mutilation was effected by cutting off the head and the phallus emblem of each bust.
’Ιστέον, says the Scholiast on Thucydides ubi1098.
ὦπουλυχαρίδα]
The same ad­ dress occurs infra 1242.
And as it is applied to two different persons, here to the foremost Athenian plenipoten­ tiary and there apparently to one of the Laconians themselves, it seems plain that it is used not as a proper name, but as a term of affection, sweetheart, channer, doubtless a well-known Spartan mode of address.
1099.
τὤνδρες]
The men of whom the Chorus were speaking, that is, as the Scholiast says, the 'Ερμοπίδαι He also explains ἀναπεφλασμένως by ἐκδεδα­ μέους, τὰ αἰδοα ἀνατεταμένους.1101.
περὶ διαλλαγᾶν π
ρ
έσβεις]
It is interesting, more for the coincidence of the language than for the fact, to observe that very shortly after the exhibition of this Play, the Council of Four Hundred were, Thucydides tells us, sending to Sparta περὶ ξυμβάσεως πρέσβεις, βουλόμε­ νοι διαλλαγῆναι, Thuc. viii. 71. The lan­ guage is not quite in the historian's ordinary manner.1105.
κἂν λῆτε, τὸν Λυσίστρατον]
And, if you like, Lysistratus as well.
He is playing on the meaning of the name;
not only Lysistrata (the woman who will end the war), but also, if you will, Lysistratus (the man who will do so).
He will welcome anybody, man or woman, who will be " a disbander of armies," and restore Peace to Hellas. " Non tarn ad personam respicit," says Bergler, “ quam ad significationem vocis."
It is not likely that there is any allusion to the Lysistratus of Ach.
855, Knights 1267, and Wasps 787, 1302-8 or to any other individual.1107.
αὐτή] of herself, of her own accord.
Cf. Peace 638, Thesm. 66, Plutus 965.
It is like the ἐξέρχομαι γὰρ αὐτομάτη of 431 supra.
For the use of ὡς as equiva­ lent to ἐπεὶ see Elmsley on Bacchae 178.1108.
Lysistrata comes out of the Acropolis, accompanied by a female attendant.
And as the Mistress is Λυσιστράτη, the Disbander of Armies, so the Handmaiden is Διαλλαγὴ, the Recon­ ciler offriends estranged.
In the present scene she fulfils her natural function by bringing up, first one combatant, and then the other, to listen to the words of peace.
Fourteen years before, in the Acharnians (988-99), the Chorus had addressed Διαλλαγὴ in the most endear­ ing terms, as the bride in whose com­ pany they would fain pass all their days.
On ἀνδρειοτάη as applied to a woman see Wasps 1090 and the note there.1109.
δεινὴν κ.τ.λ.]
A word, obviously an epithet of Lysistrata, has dropped out of this line ;
and we have no means of restoring it.
The only guess which has obtained any acceptance is that of Bentley, who suggested that δειλὴν might be inserted after δεινήν;
" ut omnia contraria sint;
ut etiam τὸ σεμνὸν est τῳ̑ ἀγανῳ̑.”
But δειλὴ is not a very apt word to form a contrast with δεινή;
σεμνὴ is more naturally opposed to φαύλη (Eccl. 617) than to ἀγανή;
and it seems inconceivable that Lysistrata should in any sense be called upon to become δειλή.
I have therefore, as a makeshift, inserted the word χαλεπὴν (in brackets) between σεμνὴν and ἀγανὴν, so that δεινὴν is con­ trasted with ἀγαθὴν, φαύλην with σεμνὴν, and χαλεπὴν a severe judge (Wasps 942) with ἀγανὴν a gracious one.
ἴυγγας καλοῦσιν.
—Hesychius.
That the ἴυγξ is our wryneck (Iynx torquilla) is certain from the excellent account which Aristotle gives of the bird in his History of Animals ii.
8. 2. Most birds, he says, have three toes in front and one behind;
but some have two in front and two behind, οἷον ἡ καλουμένη ἴυγξ.
This bird, he goes on to explain, is somewhat larger than a finch, and has τὴν γλῶτταν
This is a very accurate description of our common wryneck, which has (to quote from Newton's Yarrell, and Morris) "two toes before and two be­ hind;
claws much hooked and very sharp." "
It obtains its food by its long projectile tongue, two inches and a quarter in length, which is darted for­ ward and retracted with unerring aim and with great velocity." "
Its name comes from its habit of rolling its head and neck in a wonderful way, throwing its head from side to side, or twisting it round over its back."
Modern naturalists class it among the woodpeckers (Picidae).
The wryneck when bound to a slowly revolving wheel was supposed to act as a magical philter or love-charm, at­ tracting to the operator the love of the person upon whom the spell was directed.
Then the wheel itself, without the wry­ neck, was called ἴυγξ.
And finally the word came to be applied generally, as in the present passage, to any charm or natural attractiveness, and is very fre­ quently employed in that sense by the best writers, from Pindar downwards.
τροχίσκοις.—Photius.
The Second Idyll of Theocritus, commonly called the Pharmaceutria, shows us a deserted lady endeavouring to recall her faithless lover by turning her magic wheel and repeating her magic incantation with its constantly recurring refrain ”Ιυγξ, ἕλκε τὺ τῆνον ἐμὸν ποτὶ δῶμα τὸν ἄνδρα.
But we hear nothing there of a bird upon the wheel.
1111. ἐπέτρεψαν] they submit to your arbitration all their charges and counter­ charges, that is, all their disputes.
Lysis­ trata at once accepts their submission and summons the disputants to stand before her.
1113.
ὀργῶντας]
Though the word conveys no idea of anger, it can hardly be rendered more accurately than by Shakespeare's "in the very wrath of love," As You Like It, v. 2. ἀλλήλων τε μὴ ἐκπειρωμένους and not having made full trial of each other, that is, as the Scholiast explains it, μὴ συνόντας ἀλλήλοις.
For, as Lucian says (De Mercede conductis 7), ἴσασιν ἐν τῳ̑ τυχεῖν τὴν διάλυσιν τοῦ ἔρωτος γενησομένην.1117. ἀμαθῶς] in a tactless manner, as one who is ignorant of the ways of polite society.
οἰκείως in a friendly, con­ siderate manner, as one familiar with them.
τῆς σάθης the Scholiast explains by τοῦ αἰδοίου.1123. ὑμεῖς] ὦ ᾽Αθηναῖοι.—Scholiast.
She will have the Laconians stand to­ gether on one side and the Athenians on the other, that when she pleases she may address each party in turn.1125.
ἐμαυτῆς] of myself, that is, in respect of my own native wit (ε᾽ξ αὐτῆς τῆς φύσεως, Bisetus) as distinguished from what had been derived from others.
I am not badly off, she means, ov κακῶς ἔχω, in respect of my original genius;
and in addition to that, I have not been badly trained, οὐ μεμούσωμαι κακῶς.
This line is taken, the Scholiast tells us, from "Melanippe the Philosopher," a once famous Play of Euripides;
and it is generally agreed that the preceding line, and also the two which follow, are in substance borrowed from the same singular composition.
They come, no doubt, as Wagner suggests (Fragm. Frag. Graec. ii. 254), from the opening sentences of Melanippe's celebrated ora­ tion, which formed the central feature of the Play and gave it its distinctive name, Μελανίππη ἡ ΣΟΦΗ.
Melanippe, so the story ran, had borne twin sons, the fruit of an illicit intercourse with Poseidon, and had hidden them in the cowhouse.
Her father, finding them there, and supposing them to be the monstrous progeny of his cows, was minded to purge his house from the pollution by com­ mitting them both to the flames.
There­ upon Melanippe, eager to save her children, comes forward and delivers a long philosophic oration, thoroughly characteristic of Euripides but, as Ari­ stotle (Poetics xv) observes, utterly in­ appropriate on the lips of Melanippe.
She commences with the commence­ ment of the world when, according to Anaxagoras (of whom Euripides had been a follower in his youth), the whole universe, earth and sky, formed one uniform homogeneous mass which gra­ dually severed itself into varieties of life, trees, birds, beasts, fishes, and human beings.
All these variations of species, she argues, are consequently mere acci­ dents of form, overlying an absolute identity of essence;
and there is nothing to surprise a philosopher (however strange it might seem to ordinary mor­ tals) if one species should occasionally interchange with another, and cows give birth to human children as well as to calves.
Why then condemn to death these innocent babes, who are no ill- omened portent, but merely what on high philosophic principles a cow might well be expected naturally to produce.
-If the other lines are drawn from the same source they are in all probability con­ siderably altered by Aristophanes, and the wisdom which Lysistrata attributes to herfather’s teaching was byMelanippe ascribed to her mother.
See the lines quoted from the same speech in the Commentary on Thesm.
14. After all this eloquence we can hardly wonderthat the Μελανίππη σοφὴ, " the philosophic Melanippe," of the first Tragedy became the Μελανίππη δεσμῶτις, " the imprisoned Melanippe," of the second.1130.
βωμούς]
The Scholiast says τοὺς αὐτοὺς θεοὺς τιμῶντες, but Lysistrata's language goes far beyond that.
Not only do they worship the same Gods, they worship them at the selfsame altars, and sprinkle those altars as they walk around them with lustral water from one and the selfsame laver.
(For this circumambulation of the altar with the laver see Peace 956-8, Birds 850, 896, 958.)
And this they do ὥσπερ ξυγ­ γενεῖς, for these Panhellenic festivals were based on the idea of a common kinship.
"Ye little know the Athe­ nians," was their answer to Sparta, " if ye think that they could betray to the Barbarians τὸ ῾Ελληνικὸν ἐὸν ὅμαιμόν τε Kat ὁμόγλωσσ
ον, καὶ θεῶν ἱδρύματά τε κοινὰ καὶ θυσίας, ἤθεά τε ὁμότροπα,” Hdt. viii, last chapter.
1131.
᾽Ολυμπίασιν κ.τ.λ.]
The Olym­ pian and Pythian festivals are too well known to require any comment.
Πύλαις refers to the Πυλαία, the annual autumnal meeting of the Amphictyonic Council in the neighbourhood of Thermopylae ;
to which the Athenians sent every year a deputation consisting of one ῾Ιερομνήμων and three Πυλαγόραι.
The Scholiast tells us that this whole line is taken from the Erechtheus of Euripides ;
and another grammarian ascribes line 1135 to the same poet.
Some have thought there­ fore that the Scholium here should be transferred to line 1135 ;
but it is more reasonable to suppose that both state­ ments are correct.
The whole pas­ sage, indeed Lysistrata's whole speech, whether borrowed from Tragedy or not, is in a distinctly Tragic style.
See Wagner's Tragic Fragments ii. 186.1133.
ἐχθρῶν παρόντων βαρβάρων]
The Scholiast says ὡς τῶν Λακώνων χρωμένων συμμάχοις βαρβάροις.
And with this al­ most all the Commentators agree.
But although the Laconians were in fact at this moment in alliance with the Per­ sians (Thuc. viii. 18, &c.), it seems impossible that there can be any special allusion to that circumstance here.
In this section of her speech Lysistrata is expressly confining her­ self to actions for which both parties are equally blamable ;
nor are the words apt for describing an alliance between one party and the Barbarians.
In my judgement the expression ἐχθρῶν παρόντων βαρβά
ρων means in the presence of our barbarian enemies.
These inter- Hellenic contests are always hateful;
they are simple madness when we know that our Barbarian enemies are all the while looking on, ready to take advantage of our self-inflicted misfortunes.
1136.
ἀπόλλυμαι]
He is not referring to his former condition ;
he is speaking of the straits to which he is reduced by Lysistrata's charms.
Cf. infra 1148, 1158.
These little farcical interruptions are intended as a set-off to the real earnest­ ness of Lysistrata's harangue.
1138.
Περικλείδας]
In order to remind the Spartans of their obligations to Athens, Lysistrata appeals to the events which happened at the outbreak of what is sometimes called the Third Messenian War, 464 B. c.
It was the year when the great earthquake shook down almost every house in Sparta, and the Messe­ nian helots, rising against their masters, established themselves in the mountain fortress of Ithome.
The Spartans, un­ skilled in sieges, and in sore distress amid the ruins of their city, called upon their allies for help.
Pericleidas was the officer sent to Athens to implore the assistance of the Athenians, which was granted at the instance of Cimon;
Plutarch, Cimon 16.
Probably Cimon and Pericleidas were friends, and it is noteworthy that while the former named one of his sons Lacedaemonius (Plutarch ubi supra), the latter named one of his ᾽Αθήναιος (Thnc. iv. 119).
Accordingly Cimon at once proceeded πλήθει οὐκ ὀλίγῳ, says Thucydides (i. 102), " with 4,000 hoplites," says Aristophanes, to take part in the siege of Ithome.
Lysis­ trata was fully justified in instancing this expedition as an act of friendly, and even generous, feeling on the part of the Athenians towards Sparta;
but when she proceeds to say that it ὅλην ἔσωσε τὴν Λακεδαίμονα, she is presuming on the forgetfulness of her hearers about events which happened more than half a century before.
For the Athenian con­ tingent effected nothing, not from any fault of their own, but because the Spartans, suspicious of their restless and innovating spirit, and possibly dis­ cerning some signs of sympathy on their part with the beleaguered Messenians, took the earliest opportunity of dis­ pensing with their services :
a proceed­ ing naturally resented by the Athenians;
says Thucydides i. 102.1140.
ὠχρὸς ἐν φοινικίδι] with a red coat but a white face.
That the Spartan military uniform was of a red colour we have seen in the Commentary on Ach.
320. Here the colour of his uniform is contrasted with the colour of his cheeks which were pallid (ὠχρὸς) from fear.
The Lacedaemonians were thoroughly alarmed, but of course the description of Pericleidas is a mere comic exaggera­ tion.1142.
χὠ θεὸς σείων]
That is, Poseidon οὑπὶ Ταινάρῳ θεὸς, who was the sender of earthquakes, and the violation of whose sanctuary at Taenarum was supposed to have provoked the earthquake of 464 B. c.
See the Commentary on Ach. 510.1145.
ταυτὶ παθόντες]
The 4,000 men whom Cimon led to Ithome were not all Athenian citizens.
The gallant little town of Plataea, always identifying it­ self with the great Ionian city, sent no less than a third of its numbers to assist the Lacedaemonians in their straits.
And thirty-seven years afterwards in their mock trial before the Spartans, the Plataeans, pleading for their lives, appeal not only to their heroism in the Persian wars, but also, just as Lysistrata does here, to the succour they gave the Spartans at the present conjuncture.
καὶ ὑμῖν, ὦ Λακεδαιμόνιοι, ἰδίᾳ, they say,1148.
ἄφατον ὡς καλός]
He is admiring Lysistrata ;
cf. Peace 868, 876.1149. ἀφήσειν] τῆςμέμψεως.—Scholiast. to let you off.
The charges which she had brought against the Lacedaemo­ nians had made the Athenians jump to the conclusion that they themselves were in no way to blame.
Now there­ fore she turns to them.1150.
οὐκ ἴσθ᾽ ὅθ᾽ ὑμᾶς]
The proof she adduced of the Athenian friendship for Sparta was the assistance they gave her in the siege of Ithome:
the proof of the Spartan friendship for Athens is the assistance they gave her in completing the work of Harmodius and Aristogeiton and expelling the last of the Tyrants.
Yet in this case, as in the former, the friendly act had a very unsatisfactory sequel.
The expulsion of the Peisistra­ tidae is described in much the same way by Herodotus (v. 63-5) and Ari­ stotle (Polity of Athens, chap. 19).
The Lacedaemonians, constantly urged by the Pythian oracle τὰς ᾽Αθήνας ἐλευθε­ ροῦν, first sent by sea a body of troops under Anchimolius for that purpose.
Anchimolius was defeated and slain by the Thessalian cavalry, 1,000 in num­ ber, in the pay of Hippias.
Thereupon Cleomenes led a larger force by land, defeated the Thessalian cavalry, and besieged Hippias in the Acropolis.
By a happy stroke of good fortune, the besiegers captured the children of Hippias, who thereupon, to save his children, agreed to leave Attica forth­ with.
Yet very shortly afterwards Cleo­ menes was himself besieged in the Acropolis by the Athenian people, with the result mentioned supra 273-82.1151.
κατωνάκας]
The κατωνάκη was a thick woollen garment, mostly worn by slaves (cf. Eccl. 724), the lower part being composed of sheepskin (νάκη) whence it derived its name.
Lysistrata speaks as if under the Peisistratidae all Athenians were compelled to wear this servile dress, which is quite incredible;
so tyrannical an edict could not have escaped the notice of Herodotus and other ancient writers.
And we know from Theopompus that the necessity was imposed only upon certain returned exiles who were permitted to dwell in Attica, but not to enter the city, and who wore this distinctive badge that they might not slip in unnoticed.
Moeris, who introduces the word κατω­ νάκη, apparently without any reason, into his Attic and Hellenic words," νάκην φορεῖν.
But other writers are not so careful and, probably from taking Lysistrata's words too literally, declare that the " Tyrants " did really compel the Athenians generally to wear the κατωνάκη.
Thus Pollux (vii. 68) says, ἡ εἰς ἄστυ κατιέναι.
And so, omitting the reference to the Sicyonian κατωνακοφόροι, Hesychius and Suidas s.v.
No doubt many of the exiles would be men of position and substance who, if they elected to return to Attica, would have to assume the servile κατωνάκη.1155.
ἀντὶ τῆς κατωνάκης]
In some­ what similar language, Arrian tells us, Alexander the Great pointed out to his Macedonians the benefits which his father had conferred upon them.
χλα­ μύδας he said ὑμῖν ἀντὶ τῶν διφθερῶν φορεῖν ἔδωκε, Expeditio Alexandri vii. 9.1157. χαΐωτέραν] a nobler woman.
Cf. supra 90.
They are both more attracted by the charms of her person than by the force of her arguments.
1159.
ὑπηργμένων] when so many and such great services have been rendered by each to the other.1162.
ἁμές γε κ.τ.λ.] ἡμεῖς γε θέλομεν εἴ τις ἡμῖν τὸ ἔγκυκλον θέλει τοῦτο ἀποδοῦναι.
We at all events are willing (to make friends) if we can get the ἔγκυκλον restored to its.
The desire of recovering their lost possessions is for the moment merged in their love for Lysistrata, and their reci­ procal demands are throughout worded with reference to her dress and person.
The restoration of Pylus had been for years so paramount an object to the Lace­ daemonians that Aristophanes could not but make it their demand here also, but lie diverts it to Lysistrata by calling it the ἔγκυκλον which, as regards her, means the womanly mantle, supra 113 (hence τοῦτο, δεικτικῶς) ;
as regards Pylus, the Pylian precincts.
TO ἔγκυκλον, τουτέσι τὴν Πύλον, says the Scholiast, διὰ τὴν τῶν τειχῶν περιβολήν.
With respect to the Athenians, however, the poet's fancy was more unrestricted, and he selects just those names as will best apply to Lysistrata;
Echinus (τὸ γυναικεῖοναἰδοῖον), the Maliac bay (Μηλιοκὸν κόλπον, sinum pomissimilem), and the "Megarica crura."1164.
βλιμάττομες] ἀντὶ TOO ψηλαφῶμεν καὶ ἐπιθυμοῦμεν.—Scholiast.
ἇσπερ for ἧσπερ.
Notwithstanding their misfor­ tunes, the Athenians were still keeping a firm grip upon Pylus (supra 104);
and its recapture, though not of such abso­ lutely vital necessity to Sparta as it had seemed ten years before (Peace 219), was still a matter of the greatest importance;
and two years after the date of the Lysistrata, we find the Spartans besieg­ ing it both by land and by sea.
But the besieging fleet consisted of eleven triremes only, and the Athenians dis­ patched a fleet of thirty ships under Anytus (afterwards the accuser of Socra­ tes) to relieve the town.
Anytus failed to round Cape Malea, and returned to Athens having effected nothing, and leaving Pylus to its fate.
He was brought to trial for treason (προδοσία), and only escaped by bribing the dicasts;
Dio­ dorus Siculus xiii.
64 ;
Polity of Athens, chap. 27.
So Pylus, having been in the hands of the Athenians for fifteen years, passed again into the possession of Sparta.1165.
Ποσειδῶ]
He appeals to Posei­ don because by means of the sea the Athenians first obtained possession of Pylus, and by the same means only can they retain it.
By τοῦτο μέν γ᾽οὐ δράσετε, ye won’t do that, he means "you won't get Pylus."1166. κινήσομεν]
As regards Pylus, this refers to the opportunities which its possession gave to Athens of stirring up troubles and risings amongst the Messenians.
As regards Lysistrata, the word is used πρὸς τὸ κακέμφατον.1168. τὸ δεῖνα]
See on 921 supra.
He is humming and hawing as though un­ able to decide offhand what places he will demand in exchange for Pylus.
The word τουτονὶ at the end of the line shows that when he does name them he also points them out on Lysistrata's person.
1169.
Έχινου̑ντα κ.τ.λ.]
The places are selected, not on their own account, but solely from the applicability of their names to the person of Lysistrata ;
and Paulmier's speculations as to the histori­ cal reasons which made the speaker demand them, however ingenious, are altogether misplaced.
Under cover of these names the Athenian is really endeavouring to possess himself of the lower half of Lysistrata's person;
an unexpectedly large demand which the Laconian indignantly describes as want­ ing EVERYTHING.
Such a description would have been absurd if it were in­ tended to refer merely to the three insig­ nificant places mentioned.
Echinus was a town on the Maliac bay, the bay which came up to the east of the pass of Thermopylae.
The bay was, of course, in front of Echinus, and both Scho­ liast and Commentators have puzzled themselves over the words τὸν ὄπισθεν, the Scholiast suggesting that there was a lake at the back of the town, and some of the Commentators supposing that a creek from the bay ran up into its rear.
But all this is mere trifling.
In my judgement the words have nothing to do with the town, but apply exclusively to Lysistrata's person.
The speaker could not help using the word κόλπος, because everybody called the bay τὸν Μηλια̑ κόλπον (Aesch. Persae 488, Hdt. iv. 33);
but he means it to represent not her bosom, but her πρωκτὸς (supra 1148) ;
and to make this quite clear he calls it τὸν κόλπον τὸν ὄπισθεν.
The Μεγαρικά σκέλη are the Long Walls which con­ nected the town of Megara with its port of Nisaea.
These walls had been erected by the Athenians nearly half a century before the date of the Lysistrata, when Megara was in close alliance with Athens (Thuc. i. 103);
and were levelled to the ground by the Megarians them­ selves during the winter of 424-423 B.C. (Thuc. iv. 109).
Long Walls of this description went by the name of σκέλη, legs, τὰ μακρὰ σκέλη ;
and that is the sole reason of their mention here:
they complete the description of what the Athenian was anxious to obtain.
1171.
ὦ λυσσάνιε] you lunatic, ὦ μαι­ νόμενε.—Scholiast.
The Laconian is naturally indignant that, whilst his own modest demand was confined to one ar­ ticle of Lysistrata's raiment, the Athenian should be demanding half her person.
1173.
γυμνός]
Bergler refers to Virgil's well-known precept Nudus ara, sere nu­ dus (Georg. i. 299), the commencement of a line which (when Virgil was reciting his poem) some Roman wag completed by ejaculating habebis frigora, febrem.
But of course Virgil was merely trans­ lating Hesiod's γυμνὸν σπείρειν, γυμνὸν δὲ βοωτει̑ν, Γυμνὸν 8' ἀμα̑σθαι, W. and D. 391.
The Scholiast's explanation of the present line is ἀπαλλαγεὶς του̑ πολέμου γυμνὸς βούλομαι γεωργεῖν, and of the next ἀντὶ του̑ κόπρον ἄγειν πρω̑τον ὡς μὴ εὐπο­ ρούντων αὐτω̑ν ἀροσίμης γη̑ς.
They were like the Athenian allies after the ter­ mination of the Persian wars, who are described by Plutarch (Cimon, chap. 11) as πολέμου μὲν οὐδὲν δεόμενοι, γεωργεῖν δὲ Kal ξη̑ν Ka6'
ἡσυχίαν ἐπιθυμου̑ντες.
But doubtless in both these lines there is an allusion to the ἀρώσιμοι γύαι of which Sophocles speaks in Antigone 569.
Lysistrata, naturally, ignores the in­ nuendo, and, in her reply, ταυ̑τα merely means, as the Scholiast says, τὰ τη̑ς γεωργίας.1184.
κίσταις] ἀντὶτου̑, ὧν εἴχομεν ἐδεσ­ μάτων ἐν τῇ κίστῃ.
—Scholiast.
A κίστη was an ὀψοθήκη, a provision-basket, an ἀγγεῖον ἐν ᾧ τὰ βρώματα κεῖται, as Photius and Suidas define it.
See Acharnians 1086 and the Commentary there.1185.
ὅρκους καὶ πίστιν] oaths and the handclasp.
We were told in Ach. 308 (where see the Commentary) that neither ὅρκος nor πίστις could avail to bind the Laconians.
But the old Acharnians, who were the speakers there, were the representatives of the War-party.
Lysistrata is the protagonist of the Peace-party;
and she agrees with Di­ caeopolis that the Laconians were not always entirely and exclusively to blame in their controversies with Athens.
1189.
στρωμάτων κ.τ.λ.]
Lysistrata re­ tires into the Acropolis, accompanied by theAthenian and Laconian ambassadors, to partake of the promised entertain­ ment.
We shall presently see the am­ bassadors returning from the banquet in a very friendly and convivial mood, and enlivening the remainder of the Play with a succession of songs and dances.
The Chorus take advantage of their absence to continue the series of stanzas which they commenced supra 1043-71.
The Scholiast says that these two stanzas are an ἀποκοπὴ rod ἄλλου χορου̑, meaning that the four stanzas form one connected whole, and that the present pair are merely a section of that whole.
They are linked on to the former pair by the particle δέ.
The third stanza opens with a free offer to the audience of valuable ornaments and splendid attire.
Στρώματα ποικίλα are embroidered coverlets to be spread over couches and the like.
Χλανίδια are fine woollen mantles worn by both men and women.
The diminutive is probably used to denote their preciousness rather than their size.
That the χλανὶς was considered an elegant and fashionable garment is shown by the circumstance that Peisthetaerus, going up to Heaven to wed Miss Royalty, calls for a γαμικὴν χλανίδα, Birds 1693.
Cf. Id. 1116.
The χλανὶς was an ἱμάτιον, but the ξυστὶς was an ἔνδυμα, a long embroidered robe reach­ ing to the ground, and commonly used on the Tragic stage.
ξυστίς*γυναικεῖόν ἔνδυμα.—Photius, Hesychius.
But Pho­ tius is in error when he says ἔστι δὲ καὶ ἴππικον ἔνδυμα, ὡς Ἀριστοφάνης ἐν Νεφέ­ λαις (70).
The noble who is there wearing the ξυστὶς is not riding, but reclining in his chariot.
Χρυσία are golden trinkets such as, we have already seen in Ach.
258, were commonly worn by κανηφόροι. χρυσοφορου̑σι γὰρ αἱ κανηφόροι, says the Scholiast here.
But of course their use was not confined to κανηφ
όροι.
All girls wore them, Birds 670.
As to the κανηφόροι see supra 646.1197.
οὕτως εὖ σεσημάνθαι] to have been sealed so firmly.
The infinitive, like the λαμβάνειν which precedes, and the φορεῖν which follows it, is governed by the λέγω of 1195.1201.
ὄψεται δ᾽ οὐδέν] παίξουσα λέγει μηδὲν εἶναι ἔνδον.—Scholiast.
This is the third " sell."1207.
ἄρτος ἀπὸ χοίνικος] that is, one loaf to a choenix of wheat.
We are told by the Scholiast on Wasps 440 that a choenix of wheat was sufficient for four large loaves or eight small ones;
so that the loaf which the Chorus are here pro­ mising is equivalent to four large loaves rolled into one.
The wheat was ground very fine, λεπτὰ μὲν, but the loaf into which it was made was, in a different sense, a very fine one, μάλα νεανίας.
Cf. Plutus 1137.
All this is of course merely loading up to the fourth "sell."1211.
κωρύκους] wallets.
The κώρυκ
ος does not seem to have differed materially from the θύλακος. Both Hesychius and Photius define it by θυλάκιον, Hesychius adding ἔστι δὲ δερμάτινον ἀγγεῖον, ὅμοιον ἀσκῷ.
The Scholiast here and Suidas (s. v. σάκος and elsewhere) say that it is a bread-basket, πλέγμα δεκτικὸν ἄρτων.
As to Manes see supra 908.1215.
εἐλαβεῖσθαι τὴν κύνα]
Beware of the dog, " Cave canem."1216. ἄνοιγε τὴν θύραν]
We are now preparing for the return of the revellers from Lysistrata's banquet;
but before they re-enter, we are regaled with a little squabble between the Porter and some idle fellows crowding about the door, which may remind the English reader of the Porter-scene in Shake­ speare's Henry the Eighth v. 3.
The Aristophanic Porter-scene appears to be a satire on the artifices employed by contemporary dramatists to elicit the laughter of the audience.
A group of idlers approach from the market-place, and propose to join the banqueters within.
One of them hails the Porter, and calls on him to open the door.
The Porter orders him off.
Thereupon the intruder threatens to set fire with his torch to the Porter and his assistants.
Doubtless this had been done in the scene satirized.
But the Aristophanic idler draws back, and says that this is a vulgar trick and he won't do it.
Never­ theless, on second thoughts, if the audi­ ence really like that sort of thing, be will endeavour to gratify their tastes.
How­ ever the revellers are now moving to come out, and the Porter drives the whole group of idlers from the door.
The scene is variously arranged.
I ad­ here to the arrangement adopted in the former edition of my translation.1217.
ὑμεῖς τί κάθησθε ;
]
This is ad­ dressed to the Porter and his assistants, who instead of rising to open the door remain quietly in their seats.
1218.
φορτικὸν τὸ χωρίον]
On φορτικὸν see the Commentary on Wasps 58.
τὸ χωρίον seems to mean the office, the busi­ ness.
The Scholiast explains it by τὸ πρα̑γμα, τὸὑμα̑ς καυ̑σαι.
To set fire to the Porter, he means, is a low and vul­ gar trick, the stock business φορτικη̑ς κωμῳδίας, and he will not stoop to that.
Still if he must do it to please the audience, ὑμῖν χαρίσασθαι, he will descend even to that buffoonery.
εἰ δὲ βούλεσθε, ὦ θεαταὶ, καὶ TOVTO ποιήσομεν, προσχαριξόμενοι ὑμῖν.
–Scholiast.1222.
κωκύσεσθε τὰς τρίχας] ye shall wailforyourhair, which I will pull out by the handful.
See supra 448 and the note on Plutus 612.1223.
οἱ Λάκωνες]
Athenians, as well as Laconians, are now coming out from the banquet;
indeed the first to re-enter are two Athenian friends talking to each other of what has occurred within.
But all the idlers are Athenians, and the Porter specially refers to the Laconians because they are the visitors and must be treated with respect.1229.
ἢν τοὺς ᾽Αθηναίους] if the Athe­ nians would follow my advice.1235.
οὐ ταὐτά]
This in all probability refers to some recent negotiations in which, we may suppose, the Athenian envoys, returning from Sparta, brought back differing tales as to what had occurred during their mission there.1237. ἄδοι Τελαμῶνος] sing the Telamon catch.
We have seen in the Commentary on Wasps 1222 the principle on which scolia were sung at an Athenian sym­ posium, a principle admirably expounded and illustrated by Colonel Mure, Greek Literature iii.
2. 13. As the lyre, sprig of myrtle, scolium-cup (ῴδὸς), or other badge of minstrelsy was passed on from one guest to another, the recipient for the time being was expected to cap the scolium sung by the previous holder, that is to say, to sing a scolium which should be linked on to the former by some catchword, similarity of thought, or the like.
In the present case we are to suppose that the preceding scolium was one which could be properly capped only by some such catch as the Cleita­ gora scolium, a part of which (being all we know of it) is given in Wasps 1245, &c.
But instead of singing this, or any scolium of a similar character, the recipient, perhaps a little overcome by wine, trolls out the irrelevant Telamon catch, which is given in Athenaeus xv. 50, and runs as follows :
—
On an ordinary occasion such a blunder would have exposed the singer to deri­ sion, but in their present state of con­ viviality and friendship it merely evokes a kindly approval.
As to the Cleitagora catch see the Commentary on Wasps ubi supra.1238.
καὶ πρὸς ἐπιωρκήσαμεν]
And be­ sidespraising him, we shouldswear(falsely) that he was right.1239.
ἀλλ᾽ οὑτοιί]
That is, the idlers whom he had driven away before on the ground that the Laconians were com­ ing out.
As the Laconians have not made their appearance the idlers con­ clude that it was a false alarm, and again come thronging to the door.
But now the banquet is over, and, peace being effectually made, the ambassadors are really leaving the Acropolis.
Hence­ forth the phallus-element, which was necessary for the attainment of Peace, is altogether discarded, and Aristophanes is free to indulge in those pure lyrical melodies which form so brilliant a setting to his comic wit.1242.
φυσατήρια] bagpipes.
τοὺς αὐλοὺς, ἀπὸ του̑ φυσα̑.—Scholiast.
Apparently this appeal is addressed not to the regu­ lar theatrical αὐληπτὴς, but to another of the Laconians on the stage.
One is to pipe and the other to sing and dance to his piping.1243.
διποδιάξω] dance a reel, τοῖς δύο ποσὶ χορεύσω. εἶδος δὲ ὀρχήσεως ἡ διποδία.
—Scholiast.
The διποδία was a stately Spartan dance.
Λακωνική τις ἦν εὐγενὴς ὄρχησις διποδία λεομένη.
–Eusta­ thius (at Iliad ix. 525).
διποδία, ὄρχημα Λακωνικόν.—Pollux iv. 101. κἀείσω καλὸν, and sing a good song.
Even apart from the emphatic ἐγὼ, the whole trend of the conversation shows that the ensuing song is to be a solo sung upon the stage;
and so it is treated by the Ravenna and, seemingly, all the other MSS., and all the early editions.
Unfortunately the concluding song (infra 1297-1322) is absurdly attributed to a χορὸς Λακώνων by some if not all of the MSS.
There was not, and indeed could not have been, any " Chorus of Laconians."
For whence could they come?
when did they enter?
and, where are they stationed ?
The only Chorus in the Play consists of the twelve Athenian men and twelve Athenian women now acting together, but formerly composing two hostile Semichoruses.
There was no place in the orchestra or on the stage for any other Chorus, and the error in the ascription of the final song should have been rectified from the unanimity with which the present one is ascribed to Λάκων or Πρέσβυς.
But a different course has prevailed;
and Dindorf and some other recent editors have intensified the error by attributing the present song also to a non-existent " Chorus of Laco­ nians.
"1247.
ὄρμαον κ.τ.λ.]
Now then the Spartan envoy begins his song, to the piping of the Spartan minstrel.
While he is singing he is also dancing, and it is possible that the other envoys are at the same time exhibiting on the boards of the Athenian theatre a specimen of the stately Spartan dance.
He sings of the great deeds which Athens and Sparta did, when they stood shoulder to shoul- der to resist the Persian invader, and prays to Artemis—one of the chief Spartan deities, and selected here, in­ stead of her brother Apollo, in compli­ ment to the women through whose efforts Peace had been made-that she will preside over the treaties and see to their faithful fulfilment by both the Powers.
The song commences 0 Memory, stir up the youngsters to begin thy song (ὅρμησον τοὺς κυρσανίους, ὦ, Μνημοσύνη, [εἰς] τὴν σὴν μοῦσαν), the song which can tell of ourselves and of the Athenians, when they at Artemisium clashed like gods (θείκελοι for θεοίκελοι) against the hostile ships, and overthrew the Medes.
By τὼς κυρσανίως we are to understand, the Scho­ liast tells US, τοὺς μέλλοντας ὀρχεῖσθαι.
The construction of the opening words is, or rather if the preposition εἰς were inserted, would be, very common, as in Thuc. i. 127 [ὁ Περικλῆς] ἐς τὸν πόλεμον ῶρμα τοὺς ᾽Αθηναίους.
But here, as the Scholiast notices, the preposition εἰς (ἡ εἰς πρόθεσις) is omitted, an omission which would be intolerable in Attic, and might be easily remedied by reading ὦ Μναμόνα, ς τὰν τεὰν μῶαν.
The omission may however have been permissible in Doric, and the Scholiast's remark shows that the present reading was fully recognized as the right one in his time.
It is un­ necessary here to say anything of the splendid behaviour of the Athenian fleet at Artemisium or the undying glory of the Spartan stand at Thermopylae.
Both are recorded, in language worthy of the events, by Herodotus at the close of his Seventh and beginning of his Eighth Book.1253.
ποττὰ κᾶλα]
πρὸς ra πλοῖα.—Scho­ liast.
The use of κᾶλα, simpliciter, for πλοῖα in this Laconian song shows that the word bears the same meaning in the famous Laconian dispatch which, in the following year, was sent to the Ephors by a Peloponnesian officer after the battle of Cyzicus (Xen. Hell. i. 1. 23;
Plutarch, Alcibiades, chap. 28), and which, notwithstanding the doubts of some eminent scholars, I am per­ suaded was, like so many important documents of antiquity, composed in metre (a choliambic distich).
The ships are wastit;
Mindarus is gane;
The chiels are clemmed;
we kenna what to do.1257.
ὰφρὸς ἤνσει]
Thefoam blossomed (ἤνθει), that is, burst forth like a white flower.
The picture of the wild boar churning the white foam between his jaws " is very familiar in both ancient and modern literature.
Here the foam is described not only as gathering round the jaws, but also as streaming down the forelegs of the animal, καττῶν for κατὰ τῶν.
The use of the sigma where the Attics used theta, ἤνσει for ἤνθει, was very common with the Dorians:
we have in this ode σηροκτόνε for θηροκτόνε, παρσένε for παρθένε, σιὰ for θεά.1262.
᾽Αγροτέρα]
For this, as a title or epithet of Artemis, see Knights 660 and the Commentary there.1265.
συνέχῃς] hold its together, like two of her own hounds, in one leash.1269. ἀλωπέκων]
In Peace 1067 the Oracle-monger compares the Spartans as contrasted with the Athenians, ἀλωπε­ κιδεῦσιν I ὦν δόλιαι ψυχαὶ, δόλιαι φρένες.
And probably the word is here also intended specially for the Spartans, though in terms it extends to all the contracting parties.
The epithet αἱμι­ λᾶν, false, shifty, deceitful, is equivalent to the δόλιαι of the earlier comedy.
The Scholiast's explanation of ἀλωπέκων by τῶν πανούργων ῥητόρων seems altogether wrong.1272. ἄγε νυν]
Lysistrata may possibly have come out with the envoys, but it is more probable that she lingered behind them for a few moments and only now reappears to wind up the proceedings.
With her emerge both her own young and beautiful comrades and also the ladies of the Peloponnesian party who entered the Acropolis as hostages supra 244.
The latter are the ταύτας whom the Laconians are to lead out to the dance :
the former the τάσδε whom the Athenians are to partner.1276.
ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθαῖς συμφοραῖς in honour of our good fortune.
See the Commen­ tary on Knights 406.1279.
πρόσαγε δὴ χορόν]
Although the Laconian songs are sung by the Laconian on the stage, yet the Athenian song is unquestionably sung by the full Chorus dancing in the orchestra, whilst the actors are dancing on the stage.
This is plain not merely from the open­ ing words πρόσαγε xopov, but still more from the general tone and metrical arrangement of the song itself.
The Chorus invoke the Gods to be present at the joyous festival of Peace, and to wit­ ness the solemnities with which it is inaugurated.
And first they summon the two great Dorian deities, Apollo and Artemis, and with them the Graces, the constant choir-companions of the God­ dess. "
For when Artemis has finished with the chase," sings the author of the Homeric Hymn in her honour, "she goes to the splendid home of her dear brother at Delphi, there to arrange the goodly dance of the Muses and the Graces, .
And she herself, hanging up her quiver and her bow, and robing herself in fair raiment, leads off the dance."1280.
ἐπὶ δὲ κάλεσον]
This division of the verb ἐπικάλεσον enables the poet with more lucidity to employ the pre­ position ἐπὶ alone in the following verses in the sense of ἐπικάλεσ
ον.
For ἐπὶ stands for the full verb in the clauses ἐπὶ δὲ .1281. δίδυμον]
Her twin brother, Apollo, her δίδυμον κασίγνητ
ον.
He was the great Choirmaster of Heaven, ἀγέχορος, start­ in-, the heavenly dances with the music of his golden lyre (Birds 219, 220, and the Commentary there).
He is also the kindly Healer, for that is the meaning of ᾽Ιήιος, whether the title is more directly connected with ἰάομαι or with ἰὴ Παιών.1283.
Νύσιον]
As to this epithet of Dionysus see Frogs 215 and the note there.1284.
ὄμμασι δαίεται]
If these words are correct they can only mean is afire with his eyes, sparkles fire from his eyes.
In Odyssey vi. 131 Homer says of a lion iv δέ οἱ ὄσσε δαίεται, which Eustathius interprets πυρόεν βλέπει and explains πυρὶ .1285.
Δία τε]
They have invoked Apollo and Artemis ;
and Dionysus the Lord of the festival at which they are all assisting.
And they now invoke Zeus and Hera, the King and Queen of the Gods;
just as in the great dance- song in the Thesmophoriazusae, the women, after invoking Apollo and Artemis, go on to invoke " the matron Hera" (Thesm. 969-76);
the invoca­ tion of Dionysus being there reserved to the closing stanzas of the ode.
The phrase πυρὶ φλεγόμενον is explained by the Scholiast to mean φλέγοντα διὰ τῶν κεραυνῶν.1287. δαίμονς]
The Scholiast's explana­ tion, καὶ τοὺς ἰίλλους θεοὺς κάλεσον, though accepted without demur by all the Commentators, quite misses the point.
The Chorus are referring to those secondary Powers whose special business it is to witness the conclusion of a treaty and to punish its infraction.
The term ἐπίμαρτυς is borrowed from Homer's Zεὺς δ᾽ ἰίμμ᾽ ἐπιμάρτυ
ρ
ος ἔστω in the compact which preceded the single combat of Hector and Aias.
And the δαίμονες are borrowed from the more important compact which preceded the single combat of Paris and Menelaus.
We need not suppose that the Poet had specially in his mind the Sun, the Rivers, the Earth, and the Powers under the earth.
He uses a general term to include all those deities whose particular province it is to be witnesses and guardians of a treaty.
1290.
κύπρις]
That the success of the Women in bringing about a peace is due to the influence of Aphrodite the God­ dess of Love is of course obvious, and is indeed recognized throughout the pre­ liminary struggle.
Cf. supra 551, 833.
Peace is here called Ἡσυχία since neither Εἰρήνη nor Διαλλαγὴ could be brought into these dactylics ;
and is described as μεγαλόφρων, great-minded, because there has been no defeat or surrender on either side;
Athens and Sparta were alike eager to make it, and are equally satis­ fied with its terms.
Ἡσυχία is styled ἀγανόφρων in Birds 1321, and φιλόφρων in the eighth Pythian.1292.
αἴρσθ᾽ ἄνω]
Lift up your feet in the dance.
We have seen at the com­ mencement of this Play how closely the position of Lysistrata there resembles the position of Praxagora at the com­ mencement of the Ecclesiazusae;
and these final ejaculations of the Chorus here are repeated, with very little varia­ tion, as the final ejaculations of the Chorus in the later Comedy.
These cries of victory are intended, not merely to celebrate the triumph of Lysistrata and her friends, but also to prognosticate the success of Aristophanes in the thea­ trical contest;
and the phrase ὡς ἐπὶ νίκῃ, used both here and in the Ecclesiazusae, would naturally direct the minds of the audience to the ἐπινίκια by which that success would be followed.
1295.
πρόφαινε κ.τ.λ.]
The Laconian will sing a new song in return for that which the Chorus have sung, and he is here calling upon the piper, just as he did supra 1242, to play the accompani­ ment while he is singing.
In the MSS.
and editions the word Λάκων is made a part of the line (so rendering it a foot too long), and the speaker is supposed to be either the Coryphaeus or Lysistrata.
And so I have left it in the translation.
But if we take Λάκων to designate the speaker everything is right.
1297.
Ταΰγετον]
The piper begins his accompaniment, and the Laconian begins his song.
He invites the Laco­ nian Muse to quit the pleasant glades of Taygetus, and come to the Athenian acropolis;
there to sing the praises of Apollo, the far-famed God of Amyclae.
For Amyclae was the chief seat, in Laconia, of Apollo's worship, the place where the great festivals, the Hyacinthia and the Carneia, were celebrated in his honour.
There too she will sing the praises of Athene of the Bronze House, and of the gracious Tyndarids (ἀγασὼς for ἀγαθοὺς) Castor and Polydeuces, who sport (οἳ ψιάζουσι).
beside their own Eurotas.1300.
χαλκίοικον ᾽Ασάναν]
Athene of the Bronze House, whom Pausanias identifies with ᾽Αθήνη Πολιοῦχος.
Her famous temple ("templum aereum" Livy xxxv. 36) stood on the hill which formed the Acropolis of Sparta, Pausanias iii.
17. 3. It was the centre around which gathered a multitude of interesting reminiscences.
Here it was that the gallant Aristomenes, the hero of Messenia, entering Sparta secretly in the night time, hung up a shield with the defiant inscription Aristomenes dedi­ cates to the Goddess these Spartan spoils, Pausanias iv.
15. 2. Here it was that Pausanias, the commander of the Helle­ nic armies at Plataea, took refuge and was starved, Thuc. i. 134.
Indeed it seems to have been the ordinary sanctuary for Spartan kings, Plutarch, Agis 11 and 16.
Here Agesilaus was offering a sacrifice when he was bitten by a louse.
He caught and killed it before the crowd, exclaiming Yea, by Heaven, a treacherous plotter, ἐπίβουλον, I will gladly slay even before Athene's altar, Plutarch (Apothegm.
Lac. Agesilaus 8).
Here too Archidamus the king who, at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, led the army of invasion into Attica, brought two friends who had quarrelled and were willing to refer their differences to him, and after making them swear to abide by his decision (ἐμμεῖναι τοῖς κριθεῖς) he said My decision is that you do not leave this sanctuary before you shake hands and make up (Id. Archidamus, Zeuxidami f. 6).
And the same writer, in his treatise on Garrulity (14), observing that no considerations of prudence will induce a true gossip to hold his tongue, tells us that once a robbery was committed in this House of Bronze, and an empty wine-flask was found lying on the floor.
Whilst the crowd were wondering what the flask could mean, one of them said, " I'll tell you what I think;
I'll be bound that the thieves had taken hemlock, so that if they were caught they might die before they could be tortured;
while if they got safely off, they would drink the wine and neutralize the poison."
" Why, this is not guessing ! " cried the bystanders, " YOU KNOW !
You are one of them yourself."
And so it proved.
The Bronze Temple of Athene is twice mentioned in the "Helen," a Tragedy apparently contemporaneous with the present Comedy.
See the Introduction to the Thesmophoriazusae.
Its site has been recently uncovered, but nothing of im­ portance has, I believe, been found there.1303.
εἶα μάλ᾽ ἔμβη]
Hitherto the singer has been addressing the Muse ;
he now turns to his comrades dancing on the stage.
ἔμβη is the ἔμβα of Frogs 378, Eccl. 478.1304.
ὤια κοῦφα πάλλων]
Lightly swing­ ing your sheepskins.
The lower part of a Spartan robe was trimmed with sheepskin or wool.
In Wasps 475 an Athenian accused of Laconizing is said to wear κράσπεδα στεμμάτων, and the Scholiast observes ἐκ στεμμάτων ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐξ ἐρίων.
οὐχ ἱμάτια δὲ, ἀλλὰ κράσπεδα στεμμάτων. rotaTa γὰρ φοροῦσιν οἱ An­ κωνες.
The reading in the text is that of the best MSS.
and all the older editors;
recent editors have adopted the reading of the inferior MSS.
ὦ εἶα κοῦφα πάλλων, an excellent reading in itself, but, with εἶα in the preceding line, ὦ εἶα is far more likely to have been substituted for, than to have been superseded by, ὤια.
Apparently there was a neuter nomina­ tive ὤιον, as well as a feminine ὠία.1306.
τᾷ σιῶν χοροί] ἧ̜ θεῶν χοροί.
For in old times the Dorians were the chief promoters of music and the dance ;
and the Dorian mode was, it has often been observed, the only one of the three original modes which derived its name from a Greek people, the others being the Phrygian and the Lydian.
ποδῶν κτύπος means the clatter of dancing feet.1308.
ᾇ τε πῶλοι]
And the maidens, like fillies, beside Eurotas twinkle to and fro with active nimble feet;
and their tresses are waving as they go, like the tresses of Bacchanals sporting and flourishing their thyrsus-wands.
The Bacchanals are com­ pared to fillies, πώλοις, in Eur. Bacchae 163 and 1056.
Here ἀμπάλλοντι is used intransitively;
in Frogs 1357 it is tran­ sitive τὰ κῶλά τ᾽ ἀμπάλλετε.
In Attic the participle which follows would be ἐγκο­ νοῦσαι, Ach. 1088, Wasps 240, Birds 1324, Eccl. 489, Plutus 255.
On θυρσαδδοᾶν and παιδδωᾶν the Scholiast says ἀντὶ τοῦ1314.
ἁγῆται ἁ Λήδας παῖς]
And Helen leads them on, ἡγεῖται.
The epithet άγνὰ is specially selected to make it clear that this is not the sinful Helen of her earthly days, but the purified Helen of the Elysian fields.
Some would change Λήδας into Λατοῦς and so make Artemis the Chorus-leader;
but it is impossible to disregard the united authority of all the MSS.;
and it is perhaps more fitting that this dance of Spartan women should be led by the daughter of Zeus who was herself a Spartan woman.1316.
παραμπύκιδδε]
παραμπυκίζειν properly means to confine the hair with an ἄμπυξ, a hair-band, but here, as they go dancing along, the woman's own hand is to act as an ἄμπυξ.
Her hand is to press back her hair, whilst with her feet she is leaping (πάδη for πήδα) like a deer.
1319. χορωφελήταν] ἀντὶ τοῦ ποίει κρότον ὠφελοῦντα τὸν χορόν.—Scholiast.
They are to make, either with their hands or with their feet, the rhythmic sounds which time the dance.1322.
πάμμαχον]
This is an unusual word, and is possibly introduced here to remind the Athenian audience of their own Πρόμαχος the colossal Champion of the Athenian acropolis.
Indeed some MSS.,noted for their futile emendations, go so far as to substitute Πρόμαχ
ον for πάμμαχον, forgetting that the former word would be quite out of place on the lips of a Spartan, and inconsistent with the other epithet χαλκίοικον, which shows that he is specially referring to the Athene of the Dorian metropolis.
Nevertheless she was the same Athene, wherever and under whatever name she was worshipped;
and it is noteworthy that this final song, though emphatically "
In praise of Sparta," is wound up, and that the Comedy itself concludes, with the praise of the Goddess who was every­ where regarded as the special patroness and protector of Athens.
By the kindness of my friend, the Hon. Mrs.
Cardew, I am permitted to append to this Commentary her presentation of Bion's Adonis-dirge.
Ah !
weep for fair Adonis-he is dead !
Ye Loves, weep for him, in his beauty slain.
0 Cypris, sleep no more in purple clad!
Arise, and don thy sable weeds, and cry “ Lovely Adonis, he hath perished ! " Woe for Adonis, woe!
the Loves lament.
Stricken he lies on the hillside so drear, His thigh pierced through by cruel wild boar's tusk.
Quietly ebbs his life, and sorrow falls On Cypris, who so loved him, and was loved!
She kissed him as he died, but he knew not.
The light had left his eyes, so dim and pressed By Death's too heavy hand beneath the lids;
And the dark blood, slow dripping from the wound, Stained his white skin, but blanched his pallid lips.
Woe for Adonis, woe!
the Loves lament!
His wound was cruel, but in Cypris' heart
The wound is deeper still-deep as her love;
Although a goddess, she can feel Love's pain.
His faithful hounds are baying round his corpse, While in the wood the nymphs are wailing shrill.
But Aphrodite, with long locks unbound, Wanders along the glades, her feet unshod.
She calls Adonis with a bitter cry— Again—“ Adonis, where art thou, my lord ? ”
But he lies silent, answering not her cry, For his life-blood has ebbed, and Death is come.
0 woe for Aphrodite !
cry, ye Loves !
For grief bath robbed her of her beauty fair, Yea, it bath died with him she greatly loved.
Now call the mountains;
woe for Cypris ! woe!
Then from the oak trees comes the answer sad— Woe for Adonis!
woe !
the rivers all Bewail the grief of Cypris, so bereaved.
The mountain springs lament her lover slain.
In the day's anguish e'en the flowers flush red And still the piteous dirge goes on, for her Now straying o'er the mountains, crying shrill­ “Woe for Adonis!
He hath perishéd!”
Then Echo answers-liRe hath perishéd!”
What heart so hard not to lament his loss?
When she first saw his wound, and marked the blood Pouring .unstaunched from his exhausted limb, She cast her arms abroad, and weeping, cried­ " Abide with me, Adonis, yet awhile !
Awake, and tell me of thy love once more Ere thou desert me for the gloomy stream Of Acheron, to which thou fleest fast, And I, a goddess, cannot follow thee.
Kiss me again, Adonis, yet again.
Persephone will rob me of my love
And in undying sorrow I remain, Cypris is now a widow-love is dead.
Why wast thou overbold to fight with beasts, Following the chase without a shield divine ?
So wailed she, and the Loves with her lament, “ Woe,, woe for Cytherea !—love is dead! "
But thou that weepest, stay not in the woods.
The cold dank leaves are not the bed for him Whom thou lamentest—lay him on thy couch, For surely he is beautiful in death, And seems as if he slept.
Adonis dead May lie in holy slumber for a while 'Neath the soft coverlets, as he was wont.
Bring garlands, and all fragrant blossoms bring.
Sprinkle the Syrian ointments of rich scent
On his unconscious form-he lies enwrapped
In purple raiment-lovely in his death.
Around him weep the Loves, with sighs and groans, And for Adonis dead they clip their locks.
They crowd upon each other-treading down His bow and shafts.
One tries to lave his wound With water from a golden vessel, borne
By one of the sad flock, and, piteous sight, One with his snowy wings Adonis fans!
O woe for Cytherea !—cry, ye Loves!
Then Hymen quenched his torch;
he tore to shreds
The bridal crown;
he would have no more song.
The Graces and the Muses chant alike To dead Adonis-but he heeds them not;
For she of Hades will not let him go.
Cease, Cypris, from thy tears—it is enough
Thou must bewail him yet another year.
FINDING that I have not at present, and fearing that I may never have, sufficient health and leisure to carry through the Press complete editions of the remaining Plays of Aristophanes, similar to my edition of the Wasps, I propose to print the bare translations, long since finished, without text or commentary.3, OLD SQUARE, LINCOLN'S INN,THE translation and notes are republished without alteration.
A very few words have been omitted from the stage-directions as being not quite in accord with the view taken in the Commentary.

Also Myrrhina’s child.
It is daybreak at Athens ;
and Lysistrata, a young and beautiful woman, is standing alone, with marks of evident anxiety in her countenance and demeanour.
The scene represents the sloping hill which rises from the Lower to the Upper City.
In the background are the Propylaea, the splendid portals of the Athenian Acropolis.
Lysistrata is on the look-out for persons who do not come, and after exhibiting various symptoms of impatience, she suddenly begins to speak with abrupt and indignant emphasis.
LYSISTRATA.
Now were they summoned to some shrine of Bacchus, Pan, Colias, Genetyllis,l there had been No room to stir, so thick the crowd of timbrels.
And NOW !—there’s not one woman to be seen.
Stay, here comes one, my neighbour Calonice.
Good morning, friend.
CALONICE.
Good morn, Lysistrata.
Why, what's the matter ?
don't look gloomy, child.
It don't become you to knit-knot your eyebrows.
LYS.
My heart is hot within me, Calonice, And sore I grieve for sake of womankind, Because the men account us all to be Sly, shifty rogues, CAL.
And so, by Zeus, we are.
Lys.
Yet though I told them to be here betimes, To talk on weighty business, they don't come, They're fast asleep.
CAL.
They'll come, dear heart, they'll come.
'Tis hard, you know, for women to get out.
One has to mind her husband :
one, to rouse
Her servant:
one, to put the child to sleep :
One, has to wash him :
one, to give him pap.
LYS.
Ah !
but they've other duties still more pressing
Than such as these.
CAL.
Well but, Lysistrata, Why have you, dear, convoked us ?
Is the matter A weighty subject ?
Lys. Weighty ? yes.
CAL.
And pregnant ?
LYS.
Pregnant, by Zeus.
CAL.
Why ever don't we come, then ?
LYS.
No, it's not that:
we'd have come fast enough For such-like nonsense.
'Tis a scheme I've hit on, Tossing it over many a sleepless night.
CAL.
Tossing it over ?
then 'tis light, I fancy.
LYS.
Light ?
ay, so light, my dear, that all the hopes
Of all the States are anchored on us women.
CAL.
Anchored on us !
a slender stay to lean on.
LYS.
Ay, all depends on us :
whether as well the Peloponnesians all shall cease to be—CAL.
Sure and 'tis better they should cease to be.
LYS.
And all the dwellers in Boeotia perish-CAL.
Except the eels ;
do pray except the eels.
Lys.
But about Athens, mark you, I won't utter Such words as these:
you must supply my meaning.
But if the women will but meet here now, Boeotian girls, Peloponnesian girls, And we ourselves, we'll save the States between us.
CAL.
What can we women do ?
What brilliant scheme Can we, poor souls, accomplish ?
we who sit Trimmed and bedizened in our saffron silks, Our cambric robes, and little finical shoes.
LYS.
Why, they're the very things I hope will save us, Your saffron dresses, and your finical shoes, Your paints, and perfumes, and your robes of gauze.
CAL.
How mean you, save us ?
Lys.
So that nevermore ° Men in our clay shall lift the hostile spear-CAL.
0, by the Twain, I'll use the saffron dye.
Lys.
Or grasp the shield- CAL.
I'll don the cambric robe.
Lys.
Or draw the sword.
CAL.
I'll wear the finical shoes.
LYS.
Should not the women, then, have come betimes ?
CAL.
Come ?
no, by Zeus;
they should have flown with wings.
LYS.
Ah, friend, you'll find them Attic to the core :
Always too late in everything they do.
Not even one woman from the coast has come, Not one from Salamis.
CAL.
0 they, no doubt, Will cross this morning, early, in their boats.
LYS.
And those I counted sure to come the first, My staunch Acharnian damsels, they're not here-
Not they.
CAL.
And yet Theagenes's wife Consulted Hecate, as if to come.
(Several women enter, headed by Myrrhina, from the village of Anagyrus.
Others soon follow.)
Hi!
but they're coming now :
here they all are:
First one, and then another.
Hoity toity !
Whence come all these ?
Lys. From Anagyre.
CAL.
Aha !
We've stirred up Allagyre1 at all events.
MYRRHINA.
Are we too late, Lysistrata ?
Well ?
What ?
Why don't you speak ?
Lys.
I'm sorry, Myrrhina, That you should come so late on such a business.
MYRR.
I scarce could find my girdle in the dark.
But if the thing's so pressing, tell us now.
Lys.
No, no, let's wait a little, till the women Of Peloponnesus and Boeotia come To join our congress.
MYRR. 0 yes, better so.
And here, good chance, is Lampito approaching.
(Lampito, a Spartan woman, enters, accompanied by her friends.)LYS.
0 welcome, welcome, Lampito, my love.
O the sweet girl!
how hale and bright she looks !
Here's nerve !
here's muscle !
here's an arm could fairly Throttle a bull!
LAMPITO.
Weel, by the Twa, I think sae.
An' I can loup an' fling an' kick my hurdies.
LYS.
See here's a neck and breast;
how firm and lusty !
-LAMP.
Wow, but ye pradd me like a fatted calf.
LYS.
And who's this other damsel ?
whence comes she ?
LAMP.
Ane deputation frae Boeoty, comin' To sit amang you.
Lys.
Ah, from fair Boeotia, The land of plains !
CAL.
A very lovely land, Well cropped, and trimmed, and spruce with penny-royal.
Lys.
And who's the next ?
LAMP.
A bonnie burdie she, She's a Corinthian lassie.
Lys.
Ay, by Zeus,
And so she is.
A bonnie lass, indeed.
LAMP.
But wha ha' ca'ed thegither a' thae thrangs 0' wenches?
Lys.
I did.
LAMP.
Did ye noo ?
then tell us
What 'tis a' for.
Lys. 0 yes, my dear, I will.
MYRR.
Ay, surely :
tell us all this urgent business.
Lys. 0 yes, I'll tell you now;
but first I'd ask you One simple question.
MYRR.
Ask it, dear, and welcome.
Lys.
Do ye not miss the fathers of your babes, Always on service ?
well I wot ye all Have got a husband absent at the wars.
CAL.
Ay, mine, worse luck, has been five months away In Thracian quarters, watching Eucrates.
MYRR.
And mine's been stationed seven whole months at Pylus.
LAMP.
An' my gude mon nae suner comes frae war Than he straps targe an' gangs awa' again.
Lys.
No husbands now, no sparks, no anything.
For ever since Miletus played us false, We've had no joy, no solace, none at all.
So will you, will you, if I find a way, Help me to end the war ?
MYRR.
Ay, that we will.
I will, be sure, though I'd to fling me down
This mantling shawl, and have a bout of—drinking1.
CAL.
And I would cleave my very self in twain Like a cleft turbot, and give half for Peace.
LAMP.
An' I, to glint at Peace again, wad speel Up to the tap rig o' Taygety.
Lys.
I'll tell you now :
'tis meet ye all should know.
O ladies !
sisters !
if we really mean
To make the men make Peace, there's but one way, We must abstain- MYRR.
Well!
tell us.
LYS.
Will ye do it?
MYRR.
Do it ?
ay, surely, though it cost our lives.
LYS.
We must abstain—each—from the joys of Love.
How !
what!
why turn away ?
where are ye going ?
What makes you pout your lips, and shake your heads ?
What brings this falling tear, that changing colour ?
Will ye, or will ye not ?
What mean ye, eh ?
MYRR.
I'll never do it.
Let the war go on.
CAL.
Zeus !
nor I either.
Let the war go on.
Lys.
You, too, Miss Turbot ?
you who said just now You'd cleave, for Peace, your very self in twain ?CAL.
Ask anything but this.
Why, if needs be, I'd walk through fire:
only, not give up Love.
There's nothing like it, dear Lysistrata.
Lys.
And what say you ?
MYRR.
I'd liefer walk through fire.
Lys. 0 women !
women !
0 our frail, frail sex !
No wonder tragedies are made from us.
Always the same :
nothing but loves and cradles.
O friend ! 0 Lampito !
if you and I Are of one mind, we yet may pull things through ;
Won't you vote with me, dear ?
LAMP.
Haith, by the Twa', 'Tis sair to bide your lane, withouten men.
Still it maun be :
we maun hae Peace, at a' risks.
LYS.
0 dearest friend;
my one true friend of all.
CAL.
Well, but suppose we do the things you say, Pray Heaven avert it, but put case we do, Shall we be nearer Peace ?
Lys.
Much, much, much nearer.
For if we women will but sit at home, Powdered and trimmed, clad in our daintiest lawn, Employing all our charms, and all our arts
To win men's love, and when we've won it, then Repel them, firmly, till they end the war, We'll soon get Peace again, be sure of that.
LAMP.
Sae Menelaus, when he glowered, I ween, At Helen's breastie, coost his glaive awa’.
CAL.
Eh, but suppose they leave us altogether ?
Lys. 0, faddle !
then we'll find some substitute.
CAL.
If they try force ?
Lys.
They'll soon get tired of that If we keep firm.
Scant joy a husband gets
Who finds himself at discord with his wife.
CAL.
Well, then, if so you wish it, so we'll have it.
LAMP.
An' our gude folk we'se easily persuade
To keep the Peace wi' never a thocht o' guile:
But your Athanian hairumscairum callants Wha sail persuade them no to play the fule?
Lys. 0 we'll persuade our people, never fear.
LAMP.
Not while ye've gat thae -allies rigged sae trim, An' a' that rowth o' siller nigh the Goddess.
Lys. 0 but, my dear, we've taken thought for that:
This very morn wc seize the Acropolis.
Now, whilst we're planning and conspiring here, The elder women have the task assigned them, Under pretence of sacrifice, to seize it.
LAMP.
A' will gae finely, an' ye talk like that.
LYS.
Then why not, Lampito, at once combine All in one oath, and clench the plot securely ?
LAMP.
Weel, you propound the aith, an' we'se a' tak' it.
Lys. Good ;
now then, Scythianess, don't stand there gaping.
Quick, set a great black shield here, hollow upwards,
And bring the sacrificial bits.
CAL.
And how Are we to swear, Lysistrata ?
Lys.
We'll slay (Like those Seven Chiefs in Aeschylus) a lamb Over a shield.
CAL.
Nay, when our objects Peace, Don't use a shield, Lysistrata, my dear.
Lys.
Then what shall be the oath ?
CAL.
Could we not somehow Get a grey mare, and cut her up to bits ?
Lys.
Grey mare, indeed !
CAL.
Well, what's the oath will suit
Us women best ?
MYRR.
I'll tell you what I think.
Let's set a great black CUP here, hollow upwards :
Then for a lamb we'll slay a Thasian wine-jar, And firmly swear to-pour no water in.
LAMP.
Hech, the braw aith !
my certie, hoo I like it.
Lys. 0 yes, bring out the wine-jar and the cup.
(A maiden brings out a jar of wine and an immense cup.)CAL.
La !
here's a splendid piece of ware, my dears.
Now that's a cup 'twill cheer one’s heart to take.
Lys. (To the servant.)
Set down the cup, and take the victim boar O Queen Persuasion, and 0 Loving Cup, Accept our offerings, and maintain our cause !
(The servant pours the wine into the cup, the women all pressing round to see.)CAL.
'Tis jolly coloured blood, and spirts out bravelyLAMP.
Ay, an' by Castor, vera fragrant too !
MYRR.
Let me swear first, my sisters ?
CAL.
Yes, if you Draw the first lot;
not else, by Aphrodite.
Lys.
All place your hands upon the wine-cup :
so.
One, speak the words, repeating after me.
Then all the rest confirm it.
Now begin.
I will abstain from Love and Lovers delights.
CAL.
I will abstainfrom, Love and Love's delights.
LYS.
And take no pleasure though my lord invites.
CAL.
And take no pleasure though my lord invites.
LYS.
And sleep a vestal all alone at nights.
CAL.
And sleep a vestal all alone at nights.
Lys.
And live a stranger to all nuptial rites.
CAL.
And live a stranger to all nuptial rites.
I don't half like it though, Lysistrata.
Lys.
I will abjure the very name of Love.CAL.
I will abjure the very name of Love.
LYS.
So help me Zeus, and all the Powers above.
CAL.
So help me Zeus, and all the Powers above,Lys.
If I do this, my cup be filled with wine.
CAL.
If I do this, my cup be filled with wine.
Lys.
But if I fail, a water draught be mine.
CAL.
But if I fail^ a water draught he mine.
Lys.
You all swear this ?
MYRR. 0 yes, my dear, we do.
(Lysistrata takes the wine-cup in her hand.)
Lys.
I'll now consume these fragments.
CAL.
Shares, my friend, Now at first starting let us show we're friends.
(A sound of persons cheering is heard in the distance.)LAMP.
Hark !
whales yon skirlin' ?
LYS.
That's the thing I said.
They've seized the Acropolis, Athene's castle, Our comrades have.
Now, Lampito, be off :
You, go to Sparta, and arrange things there, Leaving us here these girls as hostages.
And We will pass inside the castle walls, And help the women there to close the bars.
CAL.
But don't you think that very soon the Men Will come, in arms, against us ?
Lys.
Let them come !
They will not bring or threats or fire enough
To awe our woman hearts, and make us open
These gates again, save on the terms we mentioned.
CAL.
By Aphrodite, no !
else 'twere for nought
That people call us bold, resistless jades.
(The crowd now disperses :
Lampito leaving for her homeward journey, and the others disappearing through the gates of the Propylaea.
After a pause the Chorus of Men are seen slowly approaching from the Lower City.
They are carrying heavy logs of firewood, and a jar of lighted cinders ;
and as they move, they sing their entrance song.)
CHORUS OF MEN.
On, sure and slow, my Draces, go :
though that great log you're bringing Of olive green, is sore, I ween, your poor old shoulder wringing.
O dear, how many things in life bely one's expectations !
Since who'd have thought, my Strymodore, that these abomi­ nations, Who would have thought that sluts like these, Our household pests, would have waxed so bold, As the Holy Image by fraud to seize, As the City Castle by force to hold, With block and bolt and barrier vast, Making the Propylaea fast.
Press on, Philurgus, towards the heights;
we'll pile a great amazing Array of logs around the walls, and set them all a-blazing:
And as for these conspirators, a bonfire huge we'll make them, One vote shall doom the whole to death, one funeral pyre shall take them, And thus we'll burn the brood accurst, but Lycon's wife we'll burn the first.
No, never, never, whilst I live, shall woman-folk deride me:
Not scatheless went Cleomenes1, when he like this defied me, And dared my castle to seize :
yet He, A Spartan breathing contempt and pride, Full soon surrendered his arms to me, And a scanty coat round his loins he tied, And with unwashed limbs, and with unkempt head, And with six years' dirt, the intruder fled;
So strict and stern a watch around my mates and I were keeping, In seventeen rows of serried shields before the fortress sleeping.
And THESE, whom both Euripides and all the Powers on high Alike detest, shall these, shall these, my manly rage defy ?
Then never be my Trophy shown, on those red plains of Marathon!
But over this snubby protruding steep
Ere we reach our goal at the Castle keep, We've still, with our burdensome load, to creep.
And how to manage that blunt incline Without a donkey, I can't divine.
Dear, how these two great firelogs make my wearied shoulders toil and aehe.
But still right onward we needs must go,
And still the cinders we needs must blow, Else we’ll find the fire extinguished, ere we reach our journey's end.
Puff!
Puff! Puff!2
O the smoke !
the smoke !
O royal Heracles !
what a lot
Of fire came raging out of the pot, And flew, like a do--,, at my.
eyes, red hot.
'Twas a jet from the Lemnian mines, I ween, It came so fierce, and it bit so keen, And worried, with persistence sore, my two poor eyes, inflamed before.
On, Laches, on ! to the castle press, And aid the God in her dire distress;
Surely, if we e'er would help her, now's the very time, my friend.
Puff!
Puff!
Puff!
O the smoke !
the smoke !
Thank heaven the fire is still alight, and burning beautifully bright.
So here we'll lay our burdens down, with eager hearts delighted, And dip the vine-torch in the pot, and get it there ignited.
Then all together at the gates like battering rams we'll butt.
And if our summons they reject, and keep the barriers shut, We'll burn the very doors with fire, and them with smoke we'll smother.
So lay the burdens down.
Pheugh !
Pheugh !
0 how this smoke does bother!
What general from the Samian lines an active hand will lend us ?
Well, well, I'm glad my back is freed from all that weight tremendous.
O pot, 'tis now your turn to help :
0 send a livelier jet Of flame this way, that I to-day the earliest light may get.
O Victory, immortal Queen, assist us Thou in rearing A trophy o'er these woman-hosts, so bold and domineering.
(During the last few lines the men have been completing their preparations, and the air above them is now growing luricl with the smoke and the flame of their torches.
As the Men relapse into silence, the voices of Women are heard in the distance.
They come sweeping round from the north side of the Acropolis, carrying their pitchers of water, and singing, in turn, their entrance song.
The two Choruses are for the present concealed from each other by the north- western angle of the Acropolis.)
CHORUS OF WOMEN.
Redly up in the sky the flames are beginning to flicker, Smoke and vapour of fire!
come quicker, my friends, come quicker.
Fly, Nicodice, fly, Else will Calyce burn, Else Critylla will die, Slain by the laws so stern, Slain by the old men's hate.
Ah, but I fear !
I fear !
can it chance that I come too late ?
Trouble it was, forsooth, before my jug I could fill, All in the dusk of the morn, at the spring by the side of the hill, What with the clatter of pitchers, The noise and press of the throng, Jostling with knaves and slaves, Till at last I snatched it along, Abundance of water supplying To friends who are burning and dying.
Yea, for hither, they state, Dotards are dragging, to burn us, Logs of enormous weight, Fit for a bath-room furnace, Vowing to roast and to slay Sternly the reprobate women.
0 Lady, 0 Goddess, I pray, Ne’er may I see them in flames !
I hope to behold them with gladness, Hellas and Athens redeeming from battle and murder and madness.
This is the cause why they venture, Lady, thy mansions to hold, Tritogeneia, Eternal Champion with helmet of gold !
And O, if with fire men invade them, O help us with water to aid them.
(At this juncture the Women wheel round the corner of the Acropolis, and the two Choruses suddenly meet face to face.)
Stop!
easy all!
what have we here ?
(To the Men.)
You vile, abandoned crew, No good and virtuous men, I'm sure, would act in the way you do.
MEN On.
Hey, here's an unexpected sight!
hey, here's a demonstration!
A swarm of women issuing out with warlike preparation !W. CH.
Hallo, you seem a little moved !
does this one troop affright you ?
You see not yet the myriadth part of those prepared to fight you.
MEN CH.
Now, really, Phaedrias, shall we stop to hear such odious treason ?
Let's break our sticks about their backs, let's beat the jades.
to reason.
W. On.
Hi, sisters, set the pitchers down, and then they won’t embarrass
Our nimble fingers, if the rogues attempt our ranks to harass.
MEN CH.
I warrant, now, if twice or thrice we slap their faces neatly, That they will learn, like Bupalus 1, to hold their tongues discreetly.
W. On.
Well, here's my face:
I won't draw back:
now slap it if you dare, And I won't leave one ounce of you for other dogs to tear.
MEN On. Keep still, or else your musty Age to very shreds I'll batter.
W. CH.
Now only touch Stratyllis, sir;
just lift one finger at her !MEN CH.
And what if with these fists, my love, I pound the wench to shivers ?W. CH. By Heaven, we'll gnaw your entrails out, and rip away your livers.
MEN On.
There is not than Euripides a bard more wise and knowing, For women ARE a shameless set, the vilest creatures going.
W. CH.
Pick up again, Rhodippe dear, your jug with water brimming.
MEN CH.
What made you bring that water here, you God-detested women ?W. On.
What made you bring that light, old Tomb ?
to set yourselves afire ?MEN On.
No, but to kindle for your friends a mighty funeral pyre.
W. On.
Well, then, we brought this water here to put your bonfire out, sirs.
MEN CH.
You put our bonfire out, indeed!
W. On.
You'll see, beyond a doubt, sirs.
MEN CH.
I swear that with this torch, offhand, I've half a mind to fry you.
W. CH.
Got any soap, my lad ?
if so, a bath I'll soon supply you.
MEN On. A bath for ME, you mouldy bag!
W. On.
And that a bride-bath, too.
MEN CH.
Zounds, did you hear her impudence ?
W. On. Ain't I freeborn as you ?MEN On.
I'll quickly put a stop to this.
W. CH. You'll judge no more, I vow!
MEN On. Hi!
set the vixen's hair on fire.
W. CH. NOW, Achelous 1, now !
MEN CH.
Good gracious !
W. CH. What!
you find it hot ?MEN On.
Hot ? murder !
stop !
be quiet!W. CH.
I'm watering you, to make you grow.
MEN CH.
I wither up from shivering so.
W. On.
I tell you what:
a fire you've got, So warm your members by it.
(At this crisis the tumult is stayed for an instant by the appearance on the stage of a venerable official personage, one of the Magistrates who, after the Sicilian catastrophe, were appointed,under the name of Probuli, to form a Directory or Committee of Public Safety.
He is attended by four Scythian archers, part of the ordinary police of the Athenian Republic.
The women retire into the background.)
MAGISTRATE.
Has then the women's wantonness blazed out, Their constant timbrels and Sabaziuses, And that Adonis-dirge 1 upon the roof Which once I heard in full Assembly-time.
'Twas when Demostratus (beshrew him) moved To sail to Sicily :
and from the roof A woman, dancing, shrieked Woe, woe, Adonis!
And he proposed to enrol Zacynthian hoplites;
And she upon the roof, the maudlin woman, Cried Wail Adonis !
yet he forced it through, That God-detested, vile Ill-temprian.
Such are the wanton follies of the sex.
MEN CH.
What if you heard their insolence to-day, Their vile, outrageous goings on ?
And look, See how they've drenched and soused us from their pitchers, Till we can wring out water from our clothes.
MAG.
Ay, by Poseidon, and it serves us right.
'Tis all our fault:
they'll never know their place, These pampered women, whilst we spoil them so.
Hear how we talk in every workman's shop.
Goldsmith, says one, this necklace that you made, My gay young wife was dancing yester-eve, And lost, sweet soul, the fastening of the clasp ;
Do please reset it, Goldsmith.
Or, again, 0 Shoemaker, my wife's new sandal pinches
Her little toe, the tender, delicate child, Make it fit easier, please.
—Hence all this nonsense !
Yea, things have reached a pretty pass, indeed, When I, the State's Director, wanting money To purchase oar-blades, find the Treasury gates Shut in my face by these preposterous women.
Nay, but no dallying now :
bring up the crowbars,
And I'll soon stop your insolence, my dears.
(He turns to the Scythians, who, instead of setting to work, are looking idly around them.)
What!
gaping, fool ?
and you, can you do nothing
But stare about with tavern-squinting eye ?
Push in the crowbars underneath the gates, You, stand that side and heave them :
I'll stop here
And heave them here.
(The gates are thrown open, and Lysistrata comes out.)
Lys. 0 let your crowbars be.
Lo, I come out unfetched !
What need of crowbars ?
'Tis wits, not crowbars, that ye need to-day.
MAG.
Ay, truly, traitress, say you so ?
Here, Archer !
Arrest her, tie her hands behind her back.
LYS.
And if he touch me with his finger-tip, The public scum !
'fore Artemis, he'll rue it.
MAG.
What, man, afeared ?
why, catch her round the waist.
And you go with him, quick, and bind her fast.
CAL.
(Coming out.)
And if you do but lay one hand upon her, 'Fore Pandrosus, I'll stamp your vitals out.
MAG.
Vitals, ye bag ?
Another Archer, ho !
Seize this one first, because she chatters so.
MYRRH.
(Coming out.)
And if you touch her with your finger-tip, 'Fore Phosphorus, you'll need a cupping shortly.
MAG.
Tcha !
what's all this ?
lay hold of this one, Archer !
I'll stop this sallying out, depend upon it.
STRATYLLIS.
And if he touch her, ’fore the Queen of Tauris, I'll pull his squealing hairs out, one by one.
MAG.
0 dear !
all's up !
I've never an archer left.
Nay, but I swear we won't be done by women.
Come, Scythians, close your ranks, and all together Charge!
Lys.
Charge away, my hearties, and you’ll soon Know that we've here, impatient for the fight, Four woman-squadrons, armed from top to toe.
MAG.
Attack them, Scythians, twist their hands behind them.
Lys.
Forth to the fray, dear sisters, bold allies !
O egg-and-seed-and-potherb-market-girls, O garlic-selling-barmaid-baking-girls, Charge to the rescue, smack and whack, and thwack them, Slang them, I say :
show them what jades ye be.
(The Women come forward.
After a short struggle the archers are routed.)
Fall back !
retire !
forbear to strip the slain.
MAG.
Hillo !
my archers got the worst of that.
Lys.
What did the fool expect ?
Was it to fight With SLAVES you came ?
Think you we Women feel
No thirst for glory ?
MAG.
Thirst enough, I trow ;
No doubt of that, when there's a tavern handy.
MEN CH. 0 thou who wastes!
many words,
Director of this nation, Why wilt thou with such brutes as these thus hold negotiation ?
Dost thou not see the bath wherewith the sluts have dared to lave me, Whilst all my clothes were on, and ne’er a bit of soap they gave me?
W. CH.
For 'tis not right, nor yet polite, to strike a harmless neigh­ bour, And if you do, 'tis needful too that she your eyes belabour.
Full fain would I, a maiden shy, in maiden peace be resting, Not making here the slightest stir, nor any soul molesting, Unless indeed some rogue should strive to rifle and despoil my hive.
(The field is now open for a suspension of hostilities, and a parley takes place between the leaders of the two contending factions.)
MEN CH.
0 how shall we treat, Lord Zeus, such creatures as these ?
Let us ask the cause for which they have dared to seize, To seize this fortress of ancient and high renown, This shrine where never a foot profane hath trod, The lofty-rocked, inaccessible Cranaan town, The holy Temple of God.
Now to examine them closely and narrowly, probing them here and sounding them there, Shame if we fail to completely unravel the intricate web of this tangled affair.
MAG.
Foremost and first I would wish to inquire of them, what is this silly disturbance about ?
Why have ye ventured to seize the Acropolis, locking the gates and barring us out ?
Lys.
Keeping the silver securely in custody, lest for its sake ye continue the war.
MAG.
What, is the war for the sake of the silver, then ?
Lys.
Yes ;
and all other disputes that there are.
Why is Peisander for ever embroiling us, why do the rest of our officers feel Always a pleasure in strife and disturbances ?
Simply to gain an occasion to steal.
Act as they please for the future, the treasury never a penny shall yield them, I vow.
MAG.
How, may I ask, will you hinder their getting it ?
Lys.
We will ourselves be the Treasurers now.
MAG.
You, woman, you be the treasurers ?
LYS.
Certainly.
Ah, you esteem us unable, perchance !
Are we not skilled in domestic economy, do we not manage the household finance ?
MAG.
0, that is different.
LYS.
Why is it different ?
MAG.
This is required for the fighting-, my dear.
LYS.
Well, but the fighting itself isn't requisite.
MAG.
Only, without it, we're ruined, I fear.
Lys. WE will deliver you.
MAG.
You will deliver us !
Lys.
Truly we will.
MAG.
What a capital notion !
Lys.
Whether you like it or not, we'll deliver you.
MAG.
Impudent hussy !
Lys.
You seem in commotion.
Nevertheless we will do as we promise you.
MAG.
That were a terrible shame, by Demeter.
Lys.
Friend, we must save you.
MAG.
But how if I wish it not?
Lys.
That will but make our resolve the completer.
MAG.
Fools !
what on earth can possess you to meddle with matters of war, and matters of peace ?
Lys.
Well, I will tell you the reason.
MAG.
And speedily, else you will rue it.
Lys.
Then listen, and cease Clutching and clenching your fingers so angrily ;
keep yourself peaceable.
MAG.
Hanged if I can ;
Such is the rage that I feel at your impudence.
STRAT.
Then it is you that will rue it, my man.
MAG.
Croak your own fate, you ill-omened antiquity.
(To Lysistrata.)
You be the spokeswoman, lady.
LYS.
I will.
Think of our old moderation and gentleness, think how we bore with your pranks, and were still, All through the days of your former pugnacity, all through the war that is over and spent:
Not that (be sure) we approved of your policy;
never our griefs you allowed us to vent.
Well we perceived your mistakes and mismanagement.
Often at home on our housekeeping cares, Often we heard of some foolish proposal you made for conducting the public affairs.
Then would we question you mildly and pleasantly, inwardly grieving, but outwardly gay;
Husband, how goes it abroad?
we would ask of him;
what have ye done in Assembly to-day ?
What would ye write on the side of the Treaty stone?
Husband says angrily, What’s that to you ?
You, hold your tongue !
And I held it accordingly.
STRAT.
That is a thing which I NEVER would do!
MAG.
Ma'am, if you hadn't, you'd soon have repented it.
Lys.
Therefore I held it, and spake not a word.
Soon of another tremendous absurdity, wilder and worse than the former we heard.
Husband, I say, with a tender solicitude, Why have ye passed such a foolish decree ?
Vicious, moodily, glaring askance at me, Stick to your spinning, my mistress, says he, Else you will speedily find it the worse for you, WAR IS THE CARE AND THE BUSINESS OF MEN !1MAG.
Zeus !
'twas a worthy reply, and an excellent!
Lys.
What!
you unfortunate, shall we not then, Then, when we see you perplexed and incompetent, shall we not tender advice to the State ?
So when aloud in the streets and the thoroughfares sadly we heard you bewailing of late, Is there a Man to defend and deliver us?
No, says another, there's none in the land;
Then by the Women assembled in conference jointly a great Revolution was planned, Hellas to save from her grief and perplexity.
Where is the use of a longer delay ?
Shift for the future our parts and our characters;
you, as the women, in silence obey;
We, as the men, will harangue and provide for you;
then shall the State be triumphant again, Then shall we do what is best for the citizens.
MAG.
Women to do what is best for the men !
That were a shameful reproach and unbearable !
Lys. Silence 1, old gentleman.
MAG.
Silence for YOU ?
Stop for a wench with a wimple enfolding her ?
No, by the Powers, may I DIE if I do !
LYS.
Do not, my pretty one, do not, I pray, Suffer my wimple to stand in the way.
Here, take it, and wear it, and gracefully tie it, Enfolding it over your head, and be quiet.
Now to your task.
CAL.
Here is an excellent spindle to pull.
MYRR.
Here is a basket for carding the wool.
Lys.
Now to your task.
Haricots chawing up, petticoats drawing up, Off to your carding, your combing, your trimming, WAR IS THE CARE AND THE BUSINESS OF WOMEN.
(During the foregoing lines the women have been arraying the Magistrate in the garb and with the apparatus of a spinning-woman :
just as in the corresponding system, below, they bedeck him in the habiliments of a corpse.)
W. CH. Up, up, and leave the pitchers there, and on, resolved and eager, Our own allotted part to bear in this illustrious leaguer.
I will dance with resolute, tireless feet all day;
My limbs shall never grow faint, my strength give way;
I will march all lengths with the noble hearts and the true, For theirs is the ready wit and the patriot hand, And womanly grace, and courage to dare and do, And Love of our own bright land.
Children of stiff and intractable grandmothers, heirs of the stinging viragoes that bore you, On, with an eager, unyielding tenacity, wind in your sails, and the haven before you.
Lys.
Only let Love, the entrancing, the fanciful, only let Queen Aphrodite to-day Breathe on our persons a charm and a tenderness, lend us their own irresistible sway, Drawing the men to admire us and long for us;
then shall the war everlastingly cease, Then shall the people revere us and honour us, givers of Joy, and givers of Peace.
MAG.
Tell us the mode and the means of your doing it.
LYS.
First we will stop the disorderly crew, Soldiers in arms promenading and marketing.
STRAT.
Yea, by divine Aphrodite, 'tis true.
Lys.
Now in the market you see them like Corybants, jangling about with their armour of mail.
Fiercely they stalk in the midst of the crockery, sternly parade by the cabbage and kail.
MAG.
Right, for a soldier should always be soldierly !
Lys.
Troth, 'tis a mighty ridiculous jest, Watching them haggle for shrimps in the market-place, grimly accoutred with shield and with crest.
STRAT.
Lately I witnessed a captain of cavalry, proudly the while on his charger he sat, Witnessed him, soldierly, buying an omelet, stowing it all in his cavalry hat.
Comes, like a Tereus, a Thracian irregular, shaking his dart and his target to boot;
Off runs a shop-girl, appalled at the sight of him, down he sits soldierly, gobbles her fruit.
MAG.
You, I presume, could adroitly and gingerly settle this intricate, tangled concern :
You in a trice could relieve our perplexities.
LYS.
Certainly.
MAG.
How?
permit me to learn.
LYS.
Just as a woman, with nimble dexterity, thus with her hands disentangles a skein, Hither and thither her spindles unravel it, drawing it out, and pulling it plain.
So would this weary Hellenic entanglement soon be resolved by our womanly care, So would our embassies neatly unravel it, drawing it here and pulling it there.
MAG.
Wonderful, marvellous feats, not a doubt of it, you with your skeins and your spindles can show ;
Fools !
do you really expect to unravel a terrible war like a bundle of tow ?
LYS.
Ah, if you only could manage your politics just in the way that we deal with a fleece !
MAG.
Tell us the recipe.
Lys.
First, in the washing-tub plunge it, and scour it, and cleanse it from grease, Purging away all the filth and the nastiness;
then on the table expand it and lay, Beating out all that is worthless and mischievous, picking the burrs and the thistles away.
Next, for the clubs, the cabals, and the coteries, banding unrighteously, office to win, Treat them as clots in the wool, and dissever them, lopping the heads that are forming therein.
Then you should card it, and comb it, and mingle it, all in one Basket of love and of unity, Citizens, visitors, strangers, and sojourners, all the entire, undivided community.
Know you a fellow in debt to the Treasury ?
Mingle him merrily in with the rest.
Also remember the cities, our colonies, outlying states in the east and the west, Scattered about to a distance surrounding us, these are our shreds and our fragments of wool;
These to one mighty political aggregate tenderly, carefully, gather and pull, Twining them all in one thread of good fellowship;
thence a magnificent bobbin to spin, Weaving a garment of comfort and dignity, worthily wrapping the People therein.
MAG.
Heard any ever the like of their impudence, ^ these who have nothing to do with the war, Preaching of bobbins, and beatings, and washing-tubs ?
LYS.
Nothing to do with it, wretch that you are !
We are the people who feel it the keenliest, doubly on us the affliction is cast;
Where are the sons that we sent to your battle-fields ?
MAG.
Silence !
a truce to the ills that are past.
LYS.
Then in the glory and grace of our womanhood, all in the May and the morning of life, Lo, we are sitting forlorn and disconsolate, what has a soldier to do with a wife ?
We might endure it, but all!
for the younger ones, still in their maiden apartments they stay, Waiting the husband that never approaches them, < watching the years that are gliding away.
MAG.
Men, I suppose, have their youth everlastingly.
LYS, Nay, but it isn't the same with a man :
Grey though he be when he comes from the battle-field, still if he wishes to marry, he can.
Brief is the spring and the flower of our womanhood, once let it slip, and it comes not again;
Sit as we may with our spells and our auguries, never a husband will marry us then.
MAG.
Truly whoever is able to wed—1Lys.
Truly, old fellow, 'tis time you were dead.
So a pig shall be sought, and an urn shall be bought, And I'll bake you and make you a funeral cake.
Take it and go.
CAL.
Here are the fillets all ready to wear.
MYRR.
Here is the chaplet to bind in your hair.
Lys.
Take it and
What are you prating for ?
What are you waiting for ?
Charon is staying, delaying his crew, Charon is calling and bawling for you.
MAG.
See, here's an outrage !
here's a scandalous shame !
I'll run and show my fellow magistrates
The woeful, horrid, dismal plight I'm in.
Lys.
Grumbling because we have not laid you out ?
Wait for three days, and then with dawn will come, All in good time, the third-day funeral rites.
(The Magistrate runs off in his grave-clothes to complain of and exhibit the treatment he has received.
Lysistrata and her friends withdraw into the Acropolis.
The two Choruses remain without, and relieve the tedium of the siege with a little banter.)
MEN CH.
This is not a time for slumber;
now let all the bold and free, Strip to meet the great occasion, vindicate our rights with me.
I can smell a deep, surprising Tide of Revolution rising, Odour as of folk devising Hippias's tyranny.
And I feel a dire misgiving, Lest some false Laeonians, meeting in the house of Cleisthenes, Have inspired these wretched women all our wealth and pay to seize, Pay from whence I get my living.
Gods !
to hear these shallow wenehes taking citizens to task, Prattling of a brassy buclder, jabbering of a martial casque !
Gods!
to think that they have ventured with Laconian men to deal, Men of just the faith and honour that a ravening wolf might feel !
Plots they're hatching, plots contriving, plots of rampant Tyranny ;
But o'er us they shan't be Tyrants, no, for on my guard I'll be, And I'll dress my sword in myrtle, and with firm and dauntless hand, Here beside Aristogeiton resolutely take my stand, Marketing in arms beside him.
This the time and this the place
When my patriot arm must deal a —blow 1 upon that woman's face.
W. CH.
Ah, your mother shall not know you, impudent!
when home you go.
Strip, my sisters, strip for action, on the ground your garments throw.
Right it is that I my slender Tribute to the state should render, I, who to her thoughtful tender care my happiest memories owe ;
Bore, at seven, the mystic casket;
Was, at ten, our Lady's miller;
then the yellow Brauron bear;
Next (a maiden tall and stately with a string of figs to wear) Bore in pomp the holy Basket.
Well may such a gracious
City all my filial duty claim.
What though I was born a woman, comrades, count it not for blame
If I bring the wiser counsels ;
I an equal share confer Towards the common stock of Athens, I contribute men to her.
But the noble contribution, but the olden tribute-pay, Which your fathers' fathers left you, relic of the Median fray, Dotards, ye have lost and wasted !
nothing in its stead ye bring, Nay ourselves ye're like to ruin, spend and waste by blundering.
Murmuring are ye ?
Let me hear you, only let me hear you speak,
And from this unpolished slipper comes a-slap upon your cheek !
MEN CH.
Is not this an outrage sore ?
And methinks it blows not o'er, But increases more and more.
Come, my comrades, hale and hearty, on the ground your mantles throw, In the odour of their manhood men to meet the fight should go, Not in these ungodly wrappers swaddled up from top to too.
On, then on, my white-foot veterans1, ye who thronged Leipsydrium's height
In the days when we were Men !
Shake this chill old Age from off you, Spread the wings of youth again.
O these women!
give them once a handle howsoever small, And they'll soon be nought behind its in the manliest feats of all.
Yea, they'll build them fleets and navies and they'll come across the sea, Come like Carian Artemisia, fighting in their ships with me.
Or they'll turn their first attention, haply, to equestrian fights, If they do, I know the issue, there's an end of all the knights !
Well a woman sticks on horseback :
look around you, see, behold, Where on Micon's living frescoes fight the Amazons of old !
Shall we let these wilful women, O my brothers, do the same ?
Rather first their necks we'll rivet tightly in the pillory frame.
W. CH.
If our smouldering fires ye wake, Soon our wildbeast wrath will break
Out against you, and we'll make, Make you howl to all your neighbours, currycombed, poor soul, and tanned.
Throw aside your mantles, sisters, come, a firm determined band, In the odour of your wrathful snappish womanhood to stand.
Who'll come forth and fight me ?
garlic, nevermore, nor beans for him.
Nay, if one sour word ye say, I'll be like the midwife beetle, Following till the eagle lay.
Yea, for you and yours I reek not whilst my Lampito survives, And my noble, dear Ismenia, loveliest of the Theban wives.
Keep decreeing seven times over, not a bit of good you'll do, Wretch abhorred of all the people and of all our neighbours too.
So that when in Hecate's honour yesterday I sent to get From our neighbours in Boeotia such a dainty darling pet, Just a lovely, graceful, slender, white-fleshed eel divinely tender, Thanks to your decrees, confound them, one and all refused to send her.
And you'll never stop from making these absurd decrees I know, Till I catch your leg and toss you —Zeus-ha'-mercy, there you go !
(An interval of several days must here be supposed to elapse.
The separation of the sexes has now become insupportable to both parties, and the only question is which side will hold out the longest.
The Chorus of Women are alarmed at seeing Lysistrata come on the stage, and walk up and down with an anxious and troubled air.
The first twelve lines of the dialogue which ensues are borrowed and burlesqued from Euripides.)
W. CH. Illustrious leader of this bold emprize, What brings thee forth, with trouble in thine eyes ?
LYS.
Vile women's works :
the feminine hearts they show :
These make me pace, dejected, to and fro.W. CH. 0 what !
and 0 what!W. CH. 0 to your friends, great queen, the tale unfold.
Lys.
'Tis sad to tell, and sore to leave untold.
W. CH.
What, what has happened ?
tell us, tell us quick.
Lys.
Aye, in one word.
The girls are—husband-sick.
W. CII.
0 Zeus !
Zeus ! 0 !LYS.
Why call on Zeus ?
the fact is surely so.
I can no longer keep the minxes in.
They slip out everywhere.
One I discovered Down by Pan's grotto, burrowing through the loophole:
Another, wriggling down by crane' and pulley :
A third deserts outright:
a fourth I dragged Back by the hair, yestreen, just as she started
On sparrow's back, straight for Orsilochus's :
They make all sorts of shifts to get away.
(A woman is seen attempting to cross the stage.)
Ha !
here comes one, deserting.
Hi there, Hi!
Where are you off to?
FIRST WOMAN (hurriedly).
I must just run home.
I left some fine Milesian wools about, I'm sure the moths are at them.
LYS.
Moths indeed !
Get back.
FIRST W.
But really I'll return directly, I only want to spread them on the couch.
Lys.
No spreadings out, no running home to-day.
FIRST W. What!
leave my wools to perish ?
Lys.
If need be.
(A second woman now attempts to cross the stage.)
SECOND W. 0 goodness gracious !
0 that lovely flax I left at home unhackled !
Lys.
Here's another !
She's stealing off to hackle flax forsooth.
(To the second woman.)
Come, come, get back.
SECOND W. 0 yes, and so I will, I'll comb it out and come again directly.
Lys.
Nay, nay, no combing:
once begin with that And other girls are sure to want the same.
(Several women enter one after the other.)THIRD W.O holy Eileithyia, stay my labour Till I can reach some lawful travail-place.
LYS.
How now !
THIRD W.
My pains are come.
Lys.
Why yesterday
You were not pregnant.
THIRD W. But to-day I am.
Quick, let me pass, Lysistrata, at once To find a midwife.
LYS.
What's it all about?
What's this hard lump ?
THIRD W. That's a male child.
Lys.
Not it.
It's something made of brass, and hollow too.
Come, come, out with it.
0 you silly woman, What!
cuddling up the sacred helmet there
And say you're pregnant?
THIRD W. Well, and so I am.
Lys.
What's this for then ?
THIRD W.
Why, if my pains overtake me
In the Acropolis, I'd creep inside And sit and hatch there as the pigeons do.
Lys. Nonsense and stuff :
the thing's as plain as can be.
Stay and keep here the name-day of your-helmet.
FOURTH W.
But I can't sleep a single wink up here, So scared I was to see the holy serpent.
FIFTH W.
And I shall die for lack of rest, I know, With this perpetual hooting of the owls.
LYS.
0 ladies, ladies, cease these tricks, I pray.
Ye want your husbands.
And do you suppose
They don't want us ?
Full wearisome, I know, Their nights without us.
0 bear up, dear friends,
Be firm, be patient, yet one little while, For I've an oracle (here 'tis) which says
We're sure to conquer if we hold together.
WOMEN.
0 read us what it says.
Lys.
Then all keep silence.
(Lysistrata reads out the oracle.)
Soon as the swallows are seen collecting and crouching together, Shunning the hoopoes' fight and keeping aloof from the Love-birds, Cometh a restfrom, ill, and, leus the Lord of the Thunder Chaugeth the upper to under.
WOMEN.
Preserve is, shall we be the upper ?
LYS.
Nay, but if once they wrangle, and flutter away in dissension
Out of the Temple of God, then all shall see and acknowledge, Never a bird of the air so perjured and frail as the swallow.
WOMEN.
Wow, but that's plain enough !
0 all ye Gods,
Let us not falter in our efforts now.
Come along in.
0 friends, 0 dearest friends, 'Twere sin and shame to fail the oracle.
(The women, with Lysistrata, re-enter the Acropolis.
The two Choruses again indulge in an interchange of banter.
The Men begin.)MEN CH.
Now to tell a little story Fain, fain I grow, One I heard when quite an urchin Long, long ago.
How that once
All to shun the nuptial bed From his home Melanion fled, To the hills and deserts sped, Kept his do-, Wove his snares, Set his nets, Trapped his hares;
Home he nevermore would go, He detested women so.
We are of Melanion's mind, We detest the womankind.
MAN.
May I, mother, kiss your cheek ?
WOMAN.
Then you won't require a leek 1.MAN.
Hoist my leg, and kick you, so ?
WOMAN.
Fie!
what stalwart legs you show!
MAN.
Just such stalwart legs and strong, Just such stalwart legs as these, To the noble chiefs belong, Phormio and Myronides.
(It is now the women's turn.
The two systems are of course antistrophical.)
W. CIT.
Now to tell a little story Fain, fain am I, To your tale about Melanion Take this reply.
How that once Savage Timon, all forlorn, Dwelt amongst the prickly thorn Visage-shrouded, Fury-born.
Dwelt alone, Far away, Cursing men Day by day;
Never saw his home again, Kept alcof from haunts of men :
Hating men of evil mind, Dear to all the womankind.
WOMAN.
Shall I give your cheek a blow ?
MAN.
No, I thank you, no, no, no !
WOMAN.
Hoist my foot and kick you too ?
MAN.
Fie !
what vulgar feet I view.
WOMAN.
Vulgar feet!
absurd, absurd, Don't such foolish things repeat;
Never were, upon my word, Tinier, tidier little feet.
(The two Choruses now retire into the background :
and there is again a short pause.
Suddenly the voice of Lysistrata is heard calling eagerly to her friends.)
LYS.
Ho, ladies !
ladies !
quick, this way, this way !
WOMAN.
0 what's the matter and what means that cry ?
LYS.
A man!
a man !
I see a man approaching Wild with desire, beside himself with love.
0 lady of Cyprus, Paphos, and Cythera, Keep on, straight on, the way you are going now !
WOMAN.
But where's the man ?
LYS. (Pointing.)
Down there, by Chloe's chapel.
WOMAN.
0 so he is :
whoever can he be !
LYS.
Know you him, any one ?
MYRR.
0 yes, my dear, I know him.
That's Cinesias, my husband.
LYS.
0 then 'tis yours to roast and bother him well;
Coaxing, yet coy :
enticing, fooling him, Going all lengths, save what our Oath forbids.
MYRR.
Ay, ay, trust me.
Lys.
And I'll assist you, dear;
I'll take my station here, and help befool
And roast our victim.
All the rest, retire.
(The others withdraw, leaving Lysistrata alone upon the wall.
Cinesias approaches underneath.)
CINESIAS.
0 me !

Lys.
Who's this within the line of sentries?
CIN.

Who bids me go ?
Lys.

Call you out Myrrhina !
And who are you ?
CIN.
Why I'm her husband, I'm Cinesias.
Lys. 0 welcome, welcome, dearest man;
your name
Is not unknown nor yet unhonoured here.
Your wife for ever has it on her lips.
She eats no egg, no apple, but she says
This to Cinesias!
CIN. 0, good heaven !
good heaven !
Lys.
She does, indeed:
and if we ever chance
To talk of men, she vows that all the rest Are veriest trash beside Cinesias.
CIN.
Ah !
call her out.
Lys.
And will you give me aught?
CIN. 0 yes, I'll give you anything I've got.
Lys.
Then I'll go down and call her.
CIN.
Pray be quick.
I have no joy, no happiness in life, Since she, my darling left me.
When I enter My vacant home I weep;
and all the world Seems desolate and bare :
my very meals
Give me no joy, now Myrrhina is gone.
MYRR. (Within.)
Ay, ay, I love, I love him, but he won't Be loved by me :
call me not out to him.
CIN.
What mean you, Myrrhina, my sweet, sweet love ?
Do, do come down.

At all events :

(She descends from the wall, and four lines below reappears through the gate.
While she is gone Cinesias speaks.)CIN.
She looks, methinks, more youthful than she did, More gentle-loving, and more sweet by far.
Her very airs, her petulant, saucy ways, They do but make me love her, love her more.
MYRR.
0 my sweet child, a naughty fathers child, Mama's own darling, let me kiss you, pet.

Why treat me thus, you baggage, letting others Lead you astray :
making me miserable
And yourself too ?

Hands off !

And all our household treasures, yours and mine, Are gone to wrack and ruin.
MYRR.
I don't care.
CIN.
Not care, although the fowls are in the house Pulling your threads to pieces ?
MYRR.
Not a bit.
CIN.
Nor though the sacred rites of wedded love
Have been so long neglected ?

MYRR.
No, no, I won't, unless you stop the war, And all make friends.
CIN.
Well, then, if such your will, We'll e'en do this.
MYRR.
Well, then, if such your will, I'll e'en come home:
but now I've sworn I won't.
CIN.
Yet kiss me, Myrrhina, unkissed so long.
MYRR.
There (kisses him).
CIN. 0 my darling, come, come home at once.
(After trifling with him a little longer, Myrrhina suddenly disappears into the Acropolis, leaving him in a mood to vote for peace with Sparta on any terms, so that he may get her home again.
A Laconian herald is next seen approaching, and the Magistrate comesforward to meet him.)HERALD.

Och, we're in waefu'case.

MAG.
This is a plot they have everywhere been hatching, These villanous women :
now I see it all.
Run home, my man, and bid your people send Envoys with absolute powers to treat for peace, And I will off with all the speed I can, And get our Council here to do the same.
HER.
Nebbut, I'se fly, ye rede me weel, I'm thinking (The Herald leaves for Sparta;
the Magistrate returns to the Senate;
and the two Choruses now advance for a final skirmish.)MEN CH.
There is nothing so resistless as a woman in her ire, She is wilder than a leopard, she is fiercer than a fire.
W. On.
And yet you're so daft as with women to contend, When 'tis in your power to win me and have me as a friend.
MEN On. I'll never, never cease all women to detest.
W. On.
That's as you please hereafter:
meanwhile you're all undressed.
I really can't allow it, you are getting quite a joke;
Permit me to approach you and to put you on this cloke.
MEN On.
Now that's not so bad or unfriendly I declare;
It was only from bad temper that I stripped myself so bare.
W. On.
There, now you look a man :
and none will joke and jeer you :
And if you weren't so spiteful that no one can come near you, I'd have pulled out the insect that is sticking in your eye.
MEN On.
Ay, that is what's consuming me, that little biter-fly.
Yes, scoop it out and show me, when you've got him safe away:
The plaguy little brute, he's been biting me all day.
W. CH. I'll do it, sir, I'll do it:
but you're a cross one, you.
O Zeus !
here's a monster I am pulling forth to view.
Just look !
don't you think 'tis a Tricorysian gnat ?MEN On.
And he's been dig, dig, digging (so I thank you much for that)
Till the water, now he's gone, keeps running from my eye.
W. On.
But although you've been so naughty, I'll come and wipe it dry, And I'll kiss you.
MEN CH.
No, not kiss me !
W. CH.
Will you, nill you, it must be.
MEN CH.
Get along, a murrain on you.
Tcha!
what coaxing rogues are ye!
That was quite a true opinion which a wise man gave about you, We can't live with such tormentors, no, by Zens, nor yet without you.
Now we'll make a faithful treaty, and for evermore agree, I will do no harm to women, they shall do no harm to me.
Join our forces, come along:
one and all commence the song.
JOINT CHORUS.
Not to objurgate and scold you, Not unpleasant truths to say, But with words and deeds of bounty Come we here to-day.
Ab, enough of idle quarrels, Now attend, I pray.
Now whoever wants some money, Minas two or minas three, Let them say so, man and woman, Let them come with me.
Many purses, large and—empty1, In my house they'll see.
Only you must strictly promise, Only you indeed must say That whenever Peace re-greet us, You will-not repay.
SOME Carystian friends are coming, Pleasant gentlemen, to dine ;
And I've made some soup, and slaughtered Such a lovely swine;
Luscious meat ye'll have and tender
At this feast of mine.
Come along, yourselves and children, Come to grace my board to-day ;
Take an early bath, and deck you In your best array ;
Then walk in and ask no questions, Take the readiest way.
Come along, like men of mettle;
Come as though 'twere all for you :
Come, you'll find my only entrance Locked and bolted too.
( The Laconian ambassadors are seen approaching.)CHaR.
Lo here from Sparta the envoys come:
in a pitiful plight they are hobbling in.
Heavily hangs each reverend beard;
heavily droops and trails from the chin.
Laconian envoys !
first I bid you welcome,
And next I ask how goes the world with you ?
LACONIAN.
I needna mony words to answer that!
'Tis unco plain hoo the warld gangs wi' us.
CHOR.
Dear, dear, this trouble grows from bad to worse.
LAC.
'Tis awfu' bad :
'tis nae gude talking cummer.
AVe maun hae peace whatever gact we gang till't.
CHOR.
And here, good faith, I see our own Autochthons Bustling along.
They seem in trouble too.
(The Athenian ambassadors enter.)ATHENIAN.
Can some good soul inform me where to find Lysistrata ?
our men are (shrugging his shoulders) as you see.
(He perceives the Laconian ambassadors.)
Aha, Laconians !
a bad business this.
LAC.
'Deed is it, lovey;
though it grow nae waur.
ATH.
Well, well, Laconians, come to facts at once.
What brings you here ?
LAC.
We're envoys sent to claver Anent a Peace.
ATH.
Ah, just the same as we.
Then let's call out Lysistrata at once, There's none but she can make us friends again.
LAC.
Ay, by the Twa', ca' oot Lysistrata.
CHOR.
Nay, here she is !
no need, it seems, to call.
She heard your voices, and she comes uncalled.
(Lysistrata comes forward attended by her handmaid Reconciliation.)
O
Lady, noblest and best of all!
arise, arise, and thyself reveal, Gentle, severe, attractive, harsh, well skilled with all our complaints to deal, The first and foremost of Hellas come, they are caught by the charm of thy spell-drawn wheel, They come to Thee to adjust their claims, disputes to settle, and strifes heal.
Lys.
And no such mighty matter, if you take them In Love's first passion, still unsatisfied.
I'll try them now.
Go, RECONCILIATION, Bring those Laconians hither, not with rude Ungenial harshness hurrying them along, Not in the awkward style our husbands used, But with all tact, as only women can.
So;
so :
now bring me those Athenians too.
Now then, Laconians, stand beside me here, And you stand there, and listen to my words.
I am a woman, but I don't lack sense;
I'm of myself not badly off for brains, And often listening to my fathers words
And old men's talk, I've not been badly schooled.
And now, dear friends, I wish to chide you both, That ye, all of one blood, all brethren sprinkling The selfsame altars from the selfsame laver, At Pylae, Pytho, and Olympia, ay And many others which 'twere long to name, That ye, Hellenes-with barbarian foes Armed, looking on—fight and destroy Hellenes !
So far one reprimand includes you both.
ATH.
And I, I'm dying all for love, sweetheart.
Lys.
And ye, Laconians, for I'll turn to you, Do ye not mind how Pericleidas 1 came, (His coat was scarlet but his cheeks were white), And sat a suppliant at Athenian altars And begged for help ?
'Twas when Messene pressed Weighing you down, and God's great earthquake too.
And Cimon went, Athenian Cimon went With his four thousand men, and saved your State.
And ye, whom Athens aided, now in turn Ravage the land which erst befriended you.
ATH.
'Fore Zeus they're wrong, they're wrong, Lysistrata.
LAC.
0 ay, we're wrang, but she's a braw ane, she.
LYS.
And you, Athenians, think ye that I mean To let You off ?
Do ye not mind, when ye Wore skirts of hide, how these Laconians 2 came
And stood beside you in the fight alone, And slew full many a stout Thessalian trooper, Full many of Hippias's friends and helpers, And freed the State, and gave your people back
The civic mantle for the servile skirt ?
LAC.
Danged, an' there ever waur a bonnier lassie !
ATH.
Hanged if I ever saw so sweet a creature !
LYS.
Such friends aforetime, helping each the other, What is it makes you fight and bicker now ?
Why can't ye come to terms ?
Why can't ye, hey ?
LAC.
Troth an' we're willing gin they gie us back
Yon girdled neuk.
ATH.
What's that ?
LAC.
Pylus, ye ninny, Whilk we've been aye langin' an' graipin' for.
ATH.
No, by Poseidon, but you won't get that.
Lys. 0 let them have it, man.
ATH.
How can we stir Without it ?
LYS.
Ask for something else instead.
ATH.
Hum !
haw !
let's see ;
suppose they give us back Echinus first, then the full-bosomed gulf Of Melis, then the straight Megaric limbs.
LAC.
Eh, mon, ye're daft;
ye'll no hae everything.
Lys. 0 let it be :
don't wrangle about the limbs.
ATH.
I'fecks, I'd like to strip, and plough my field.
LAC.
An' I to bring the midden, by the Twa'.
Lys.
All this ye'll do, when once ye come to terms.
So if ye would, go and consult together
And talk it over, each with your allies.
ATH.
Allies, says she!
Now my good soul consider:
What do they want, what can they want, but this, Their wives again ?
LAC.
The fient anither wiss Ha' mine, I ween.
ATH.
Nor my Carystians either.
Lys. 0 that is well:
so purify yourselves ;
And in the Acropolis we'll feast you all
On what our cupboards still retain in store.
There, each to other, plight your oath and troth, Then every man receive his wife again, And hie off homeward.
ATH.
That we will, and quickly.
LAC.
Gae on :
we'se follow.
ATH.
Ay, as quick as quick.
(Lysistrata and the ambassadors go in.)CHOR.
Gorgeous robes and golden trinkets, Shawls and mantles rich and rare, I will lend to all who need them, Lend for youths to wear, Or if any comrade's daughter Would the Basket bear.
One and all I here invite you, Freely of my goods partake, Nought is sealed so well, but boldly
Ye the seals may break, And of all that lurks behind them, Quick partition make.
Only, if you find the treasures, Only, if the stores you spy, You must have, I tell you plainly, Keener sight than I.
Is THERE any man among you, With a lot of children small, With a crowd of hungry servants, Starving in his hall ?
I have wheat to spare in plenty, I will feed them all.
Loaves, a quart apiece, I'll give them, Come along, whoever will, Bring your bags, and bring your wallets
For my slave to fill;
Manes, he's the boy to pack them Tight and tighter still.
Only you must keep your distance, Only you must needs take care, Only—don’t approach my doorway, Ware the watch-clog, ware !
(Some idlers come in from the market-place, and attempt to enter the house in which the ambassadors are feasting.)
IDLER.
Open the door there, ho !
PORTER.
Be off, you rascal!
IDLER.
What, won't you stir ?
I've half a mind to roast you All with this torch.
No, that's a vulgar trick.
I won't do that.
Still if the audience wish it, To please their tastes we'll undertake the task.
SECOND IDLER.
And we, with you, will undertake the task.
PORTER.
Hang you, be off !
what are yon at ?
you'll catch it.
Come, come, begone;
that these Laconians here, The banquet ended, may depart in peace.
(The banqueters begin to come out.)FIRST ATH.
Well, if I ever saw a feast like this !
What cheery fellows those Laconians were, And we were wondrous witty in our cups.
SECOND ATH.
Ay, ay, 'tis when we're sober, we're so daft.
Now if the State would take a friend's advice, 'Twould make its envoys always all get drunk.
When we go dry to Sparta, all our aim Is just to see what mischief we can do.
We don't hear aught they say;
and we infer A heap of things they never said at all.
Then we bring home all sorts of differing tales.
Now everything gives pleasure:
if a man, When he should sing Cleitagora, strike up With Telamon's song, we'd clap him on the back, And say 'twas excellent;
ay, and swear it too.
(The idlers again approach.)PORTER.
Why, bless the fellows, here they come again, Crowding along.
Be off, you scoundrels, will you ?
IDLER.
By Zeus, we must:
the guests are coming out.
(The ambassadors come outfrom the banquet.)LAC.
0 lovey mine, tak’ up the pipes an' blaw.
An' I'se jist dance an' sing a canty sang Anent the Athanians an' our ainsells too.

Ay, by the Powers, take up the pipes and blow.
Eh, but I dearly love to see you dance.
LAC.1 Stir, Memory, stir the chiels i' that auld sang o' thine, Whilk kens what we an' Attics did In the gran' fechts lang syne.

Far hence, far hence depart

There, all is settled, all arranged at last.
Now, take your ladies ;
you, Laconians, those, And you, take these;
then standing side by side, Each by his partner, lead your dances out In grateful honour to the Gods, and 0 Be sure you nevermore offend again.
CHOR.
Now for the Chorus, the Graces, the minstrelsy.
Call upon Artemis, queen of the glade;
Call on her brother, the Lord of festivity, Holy and gentle one, mighty to aid.
Call upon Bacchus, afire with his Maenades;
Call upon Zeus, in the lightning arrayed;
Call on his queen, ever blessed, adorable ;
Call on the holy, infallible Witnesses, Call them to witness the peace and the harmony, This which divine Aphrodite has made.

Whilst your eager foot is springin’

Whilst your eager voice is singin' Praise to Her in might excellin' Goddess o' the Brassin Dwellin'.
THE MSS.
containing the Lysistrata in a more or less perfect form are as follows :
—R. The Ravenna MS.(I have the facsimile of R. and am responsible for the presentation of its readings in this Appendix.)H. The Munich MS. (No. 492, State Library).
P1. The second Parisian (No. 2715, National Library).
P2. The third Parisian (No. 2717, National Library).
(These three MSS.
were used by Brunck for his edition.)I. The Vaticano-Palatine (Pal. No. 67 in the Vatican Library).
(This MS. was used by Kuster, and apparently by Marco Musuro for the Editio Princeps.)
F1. The second Florentine (No. 31. 16 in the Laurentian Library).
1. The first Leyden (No. 52 in the University Library).
There is a copy of l., made by Bentley, in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge.
Of these MSS.
only R. and H. contain the Play in its entirety.
They belong to the same class, H. being extremely similar to, though not quite identical with, R.The other five MSS.
are a quite distinct class, and are obviously all drawn from one source.
They all alike omit the lines between 61 and 132, between 199 and 268, between 819 and 890, and between 1097 and 1237;
whilst 1. also omits the lines between 1035 and 1097 and from 1237 to the end of the Play.
I have been in the habit of vituperating P1. as the originator of countless futile emendations and F1. as the faithful retailer of the same.
But it is apparent from Professor John Williams Whitens valuable articles on “the MSS.
of Aristophanes " that I did not rightly apportion the amount of criminality between the two.
Fl., being the older MS., must have been the original transgressor and P1. the indiscriminate copier.
I must also confess to another mistake which is pointed out by Professor White with great kindness in the same articles.
H. is a MS.
in the Bibliotheca Monacensis which I ignorantly supposed to be a library in the little principality of Monaco.
And as the letter M. had already been assigned to the Milanese MSS., I gave to this MS.
the letter H., the initial of Herculis Portus which was the ancient name of Monaco.
However the Bibliotheca Monacensis is really the State Library of Munich, and H. must now stand for the final (the initial being otherwise engaged) of the Bavarian City.
Neither the Lysistrata nor the Thesmophoriazusae appeared in the Editio Princeps, the Aldine edition.
Aldus says, "Accipe novem Aristo­ phanis fabulas, nam decimam, Lysistraten, ideo praetermisimus quia vix dimidiata haberi a nobis potuit."
He might have published a mutilated Lysistrata, but he seems to know nothing of an eleventh Comedy.
It is probable that he is referring to the MS.
which I have called I., and which on other grounds he is believed to have used.
I. does, as we have seen, contain a mutilated copy of the Lysistrata, but contains no portion of the Thesmophoriazusae.
The Aldine edition was published in 1498, and in 1515 Bernardo Giunta published the same nine Plays at Florence.
And in the same year he published, as a separate volume, the two Plays which Aldus had failed to procure.
In his dedication of the latter volume to Francesco Accolti he says, "Venit, mi Francisce, expectata dies illa in qua ex Urbinate Bibliotheca antiquissimum Aristophanis exemplar nacti sumus, ibique inter alias Λυσιστράτην καὶ Θεσμοφοριαζούσας, non alias visas comoedias invenimus, basque et tuo nomine cudere tibique dicare, amicorum optime, visum est.
Nec te ignorare velim, vir doctissime, plus aliis truneatas mutilatasque has esse comoedias."
And in his final note he says to the reader, “ Habes, candide lector, nusquam hactenus impressas binas Aristophanis comoedias, sacrificantes feminas Atticamque Lysistraten, quas ex codice adeo vetusto excerpsimus ut altera interdum diction is pars ibi desideretur.
"It is rather surprising to find in Cratander's edition, published at Basle seventeen years later, not only no recognition of Giunta's publication, but an implication that these two Plays had never been published before.
Cratander says to the reader, “ Habes, candide lector, praeter novem hac­ tenus editas Aristophanis comoedias, duas in calce adiunctas, nimirum sacrificantes foeminas, Atticamque Lysistraten.
In quibus si quid desiderabitur, in exemplar mutilum et corruptum culpam transferas oportet.
Nos, studiis tuis faventes, illas tibi, ut invenimus, minus expolitas, quam nullas tradere maluimus."
His presentation of the two Comedies is identical with that of 1515, and I do not know whence he got the name Atticam Lysistraten, if not from Giunta's edition.
However he may of course have consulted the MS.
which Giunta consulted..
That MS. has, of late years, been identified, or sought to be identified, with the famous MS. of Ravenna.
The identification is said to have been made independently by two critics, W. G. dark, formerly Public Orator in the University of Cambridge, and Velsen.
I have not been able to obtain Velsen's article, but it is not likely that he added anything of moment to Clark's argument;
for Velsen's excellence as a collator of MSS.
should not blind us to his singular ineffectiveness as a critic.
Clark's argument rests mainly on the fact that he found in the Ravenna ills.
certain pencil marks corresponding with the pages of Giunta's edition of the two Plays.
But this is not a very convincing argument.
The pencil marks might just as well have been made by any later scholar (Cratander for instance) with Giunta's edition in his hand.
And the description which both Giunta and Cratander give of the MS.
in which they found the Plays is that of a MS.
absolutely dissimilar to the Ravenna.
dark admits that their description " is by no means a correct description of the [Ravenna] MS., for it implies that its leaves have been worn or the writing defaced by age, which is not the case."
And he asks, “ Is this mere carelessness or deliberate mystification ? " Journal of Philo­ logy iii. 157.
He returns no answer to the question, and it seems to me that both the suggested solutions are in the highest degree improbable;
and that the only true explanation is that they were not referring to the Ravenna MS.
at all.
For why should a writer unnecessarily depreciate his own wares?
Both Plays are in at least as good a condition in the Ravenna as any of the other nine.
The Lysistrata is seventh in the volume, with six Plays preceding and four following it;
the Thesmopho­ riazusae tenth, followed by the Ecclesiazusae.
Yet both Giunta and Cratander place the Thesmophoriazusae before the Lysistrata, relegating the latter to the end of the series, a place which it occupied as the last of the eleven comedies for more than two centuries and a half, until Brunck in his edition promoted it to be the first of the eleven comedies.
The editions in my possession containing the Lysistrata are as follows :
(2) Cratander.
Basle, 1532.(4) Farreus.
Venice, 1542.(5) Grynaeus.
Frankfort, 1544.(6) Gelenius.

ἐς Βακχεῖον P2. 1. and the remaining editions.
Brunck was the first to adopt ἐς as being " ma­ gis Atticum."
I do not often mention these trifling differences;
being content in matters of this kind to follow the reading of the best MSS., and not agree­ ing with the assumption of some recent critics that Aristophanes invariably used ἐς before a consonant and εἰς before a vowel;
an assumption which, as Enger observes, "idonea ratione videtur ca­ rere."
I believe that in all such ques­ tions Aristophanes had regard to the rhythmical melody of his verse ;
a point of view which never seems even to present itself to the critics.2. ̛̕πὶ Κωλιάδ̕’ MSS. and editions.
Bentley proposed ’ς Κωλιάδος, but Ari­ stophanes appears to have favoured this interchange of the prepositions.
Thus in Knights 1312 we have εἰς τὸ Θησεῖον πλεούσας ἢ ’πὶ τῶν σεμνῶν θεῶν, and in Frogs 187 τίς εἰς τὸ Λήθης πεδίον ... ἢ ’πὶ Ταίναρον;
4. ἐνταυθοῖ. MSS. vulgo.
But Elmsley at Ach. 152 expressed a preference for the form ἐνταυθοὶ, which is accordingly introduced into the text by Dindorf, Enger, Holden, Meineke, and Blaydes.16.
χαλεπή TOt.
Both R. and H. have χαλεπή τε contra metrum, and so all editions before Brunck.
But Florent Chretien conjectured TOt, and this was approved by Scaliger and Bentley, and being found in P1. P2. and F1. is read by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
Bentley also, the reading of the last- mentioned MSS.
being then unknown, suggested δ’ ἡ (and so Bp. Burgess), a very probable conjecture, and Dawes τῶν, a very improbable one.
For γυναι­ κῶν Geel suggests, and Van Leeuwen reads, γυναιξὶν.
And for ἔξοδος Dawes, with great probability, suggested ἡ ξοδος as in Peace 1181.
And this was approved by Brunck.20.
ἦν γὰρ ἕτερα Porson, Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Van Leeuwen.
ἕτερα γὰρ ἦν MSS.
editions before Brunck and Bekker and Dindorf afterwards.
This of course was unmetrical, and various efforts have been made to restore the metre.
F1. inserts ye after ἦν, and though this makes an anapaest follow a dac­ tyl it is adopted by P1. and by Brunck and Invernizzi.
Elmsley (at Ach. 323) and Hermann proposed τἄρ’ for γὰρ, and are followed by Bothe, Enger, and sub­ sequent editors except as herein appears.
But τἄρ’ seems out of place here, as does τἂν which Blaydes substitutes.
P2., besides the regular line, volunteers another in the margin, designed to get rid of the difficulty about τῶνδε, viz. aiX' οὐκ ἐκείνων ἦν τάδε προὐργιαίτερα αὐταῖς ;
24.
καὶ νὴ Δία παχύ R. H. P2. vulgo. νὴ τὸν Δία παχύ P1. F1. νὴ Δία παχύ l.
It seems incredible that Meineke should have proposed (in his Vind. Aristoph.) to change the recognized reading into νὴ Δία πάνυ παχύ.
Such is his notion of Aristophanic rhythm.31. ἐπ’ ὀλίγου γ’ ὠχεῖτ’ ἄpa Dobree, Enger, Holden, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart, except that Enger for ὠχεῖτ’ writes ὀχεῖτ’. ἐπ’ ὀλίγου γὰρ (γ’ ἄρ’ P1.

See the Commentary.42. ἐργασαίατο MSS. vulgo.
This speech of Calonice is twice quoted by Clement of Alexandria in his " Paeda­ gogue " (ii. 10. 109 and iii. 2. 7), and the carelessness of his quotation, or of his transcribers, has enabled recent edi­ tors to pursue with avidity their self­ appointed task of corrupting the text of Aristophanes.
In the former passage he quotes this line as τί γὰρ φρόνιμον γυναῖ­ κες ἐργασαίατο (his MSS.
give ἐργάσαιατο, which does not suit the metre) ;
and in the second τί δ’ ἂν γυναῖκες φρόνιμον ἐργασαίμεθα.
Therefore, in defiance of every Aristophanic MS., ἐργασαίμεθα is promptly introduced into the text by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.43.
ἐξηνθισμέναι MSS. vulgo.
And so Clement in the earlier passage, but in the latter he has ἐξηνθισμέναι ;
but two of his MSS.
have η written over the a.
Dindorf in his notes approved of ἐξην­ θισμέναι, which was accordingly adopted by Enger, Holden, Bergk, Meineke, and Van Leeuwen.
On the absurdity of this reading see the Commentary.44.
κροκωτὰ φ
οροῦσαι R. H. vulgo. κρ
οκωτοφ
οροῦσαι I. P1. P2. F1. l. Clement (ubi supra), Kuster (who had access to I.), Bergler, Enger, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.
But, as Brunch:
observed, the accusatives in the following verse, as well as κροκωτὰ in this, are governed by φοροῦσαι, and the form κροκωτοφ
οροῦαι may, as Dindorf suggests, have been borrowed from 219 infra.
The quotations in Clement were first noticed by Bentley.45.
περιβαρίδας MSS. vulgo.
Before Brunck's time the line χἠ῎γχουσα καὶ τὰ διαφανῆ χιτώνια, which now closes the next speech of Lysistrata, closed the present speech of Calonice, following im­ mediately after the word περιβαρίδας, as it does in both R. and H.
Under that arrangement the nominative ἄγχουσα was unintelligible ;
and Bentley there­ fore proposed that line 45 should com­ mence a new sentence, τί κιμβερίκ’ ὀρθοστάδια καὶ περιβαρίδες χἠ῎γχουσα κ.τ.λ. Bergler too suggested περιβαρίδες.
But when Brunck, on the authority of I. P1. P2. supported subsequently by F1. and l., restored the χἠ ῎γχουσα line to its proper place in Lysistrata's speech, where it really does follow the nominative περι­ βαρίδες (a course which Kuster had already proposed and in which Brunck has been followed by every subsequent editor) the reason for these emendations disappeared, and it is astonishing to find Blaydes now for the first time in­ troducing into the text Bentley's alter­ ation which is no longer needed.
61. 1. P1. P2. F1. 1. cease here, recom­ mencing with line 132.63.
Θεαγένους R. H. all editions before Dindorf;
and Weise and Bergk after­ wards.
Dindorf, here as everywhere, changed Θεαγένους into Θεαγένους, and save as aforesaid is followed by subse­ quent editors.
Bentley (at Callimachi Fragm. 227) thought that the a in Θεα­ γένης is short, but it seems more pro­ bable that Θεα- here as in θέασαι (Peace 906), and as the νεα- in νεανικὴν and νεανιῶν (Wasps 1067, 1069), was pro­ nounced as one syllable.
See Appendix to Birds 822.70.
Μυρρίνη H. vulgo.
Μυρρίνηι R. Μυρρίνῃ Junta, Cratander, Zanetti, and Farreus.
But Invernizzi gave Μυρρίνην as R.'s reading, and this is followed by Bothe, Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes.79.
γλυκυτάτη σου R. H. and all edi­ tions before Brunck have ὦ γλυκυτάτη σου, but Bisetus, Florent Chretien, and Bentley all pointed out that either the ὦ or the σου must be omitted, Bentley adding that he preferred the omission of ὦ.
And ὦ is accordingly omitted by Brunck and all subsequent editors except Bothe and Van Leeuwen who omit σου.
But ὦ is far more likely to have been interpolated than σου.
Mei­ neke proposed ὦ γλύκη.81.
μάλα γὰρ οἰῶ ναὶ σιώ R. H. all editions before Bothe ;
and Bekker and Weise afterwards.
Reisig proposed μάλα y οἰῶ, ναὶ τὼ aTta, and this is adopted by Bothe and (save as aforesaid) all subsequent editors.
That the ordinary form was ναὶ τὼ σιὼ is sufficiently evi­ denced even by this very Play;
but when we remember that the Athenians were accustomed to say νὴ Δία, as well as ὴντὸν Ala, πρὸςθεῶν as well as πρὸς τῶν θεῶν, and the like, it seems un­ reasonable to lay down that the Dorians could never, under any circumstances, say ναὶ σιὼ as well as ναὶ τὼ σιώ.
Here every MS.
bears witness that they did so.
Nor is this all.
In the course of this Play the word οἰῶ occurs three times in an iambic senarius, and in each case it occupies exactly the same position, and is followed only by a single cretic, μάλα yap ola ναὶ σιὼ, here ;
ἐξέβαλ᾽, οἰῶ, τὸ ξίφος, infra 156 ;
and ἆρϰε μὲν, olaF, Λαμ­ πιτώ, infra 998.
This is a very harmo­ nious collocation of words, while Reisig's alteration introduces the singularly in­ harmonious jingle of three consecutive feet ending with Omega, οὶῶ | ναὶ τὼ | σιώ.83.
τὸϰρη̑ τιτθίων Bentley, Portus, recentiores, except as hereinafter men­ tioned.

ϰαίαναὶ τὼ σιὼ. R. H. insert μὲν before vaL, and so all editions before Brunck.
Brunck and Bekker restore the metre by omitting the τὼ, but Bentley suggested the omission of μὲν, and this is done by Invernizzi (who er­ roneously represented it to be R.'s reading) and all subsequent editors ex­ cept Bekker.94.

Wakefield defends μυσιδδέτω on the ground that Lampito is disre­ garding Lysistrata's interruption, and means
Who convoked the meeting ?
Let her tell, &c., but this would require the change of λῇςιnto λῇ.102.

There is how­ ever another word μοιμυάω which no grammarian gives in the second person plural, or connects in any way with Aristophanes, but which is substituted for the genuine reading by Meineke, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.

Dawes altered this into ἐσθ᾽ ὑπνῶν " ne ὑπνῶν priorem producat" ;
and he is followed by Brunck and all subsequent editors except Bergk and Meineke.
But Reisig thought that the first syllable might be long in Doric, and so Dindorf in his notes, and Bergk and Meineke concur.
And as the MSS.
are unanimous, and their reading is far more harmonious than that of Dawes, I have retained it in the text.

The MSS.
omit τί and R. and H. leave the line a syllable short, and so all editions before Kuster.
But in the second section of the line R. and H. have κακακῶς (the first two letters have been struck out in R.), and P1. P2. I. and 1. κακὰ κακῶς, a reading adopted by Kuster and subsequent edi­ tors except as herein appears.
To restore the metre Scaliger suggested the in­ sertion of τότε after ϰρή, Weise inserts γε after τύπτωσιν.
Wakefield suggested παρέϰειν κακοι̑ς κακῶς which Blaydes reads.169.

Nonne auri abyssus in Deae temple latet?"
And this suggestion is adopted by Portus and in the editions known as "Scaliger's" and "Faber's." οὐϰ ἇς σποδα̑ς I. P2. 1. Kuster, Brunck, Inver­ nizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Weise. οὐϰ ὡς σποδα̑ς P1. F1.

The words ἇςand σποδα̑ς are variously accented.

vulgo.
Everybody knows that the Athe­ nians called their Acropolis sometimes by the full name ἀκρόπολις, and some­ times by the shorter name πόλις (Thuc. ii. 15).
Elsewhere Aristophanes uses the shorter name ;
but in the present Play, the only Play concerned with the Acro­ polis, he uses the full name no less than five times, 176, 179, 241, 263, 482.
Cobet however, in the plenitude of his wisdom, concludes that as Aristophanes generally uses the shorter name, he can NEVER use the full one, even where, as here, the speech is addressed to a Laconian who might not under­ stand what the shorter name implied.
Was there ever such a reasoner as Cobet!
He therefore proposes to read here κακαληψόμεσθα τὴν πόλιν γὰρ, and three lines below τὴν πόλιν καταλαμ­ βάνειν.
Of these fatuous suggestions the first, but not the second, is accepted by Meineke, and both are accepted by Holden in his second edition.180.

φύσ᾽ ἐν Αἰσϰύλῳ R. H. vulgo.
φασὶν Αἰσϰύλος P2. I. 1. Brunck, Bekker, Weise, Meineke, Holden, and Van Leeuwen.
Holden in his first edition followed the traditional reading, but in his second was, as usual, led astray by Meineke.
There seems no sense in this reading, for Aeschylus did not himself take the oath.
Brunck, truly enough, says that the reading he adopts is equivalent to ὥσπερ ποτὲ ἐποίησεν Αἰσϰύ­ Αος, ὥς φασιν, but nobody ever said that Aeschylus did such a thing.
Meineke in his V. A. actually proposes to insert Brunck's prose equivalent ὡς ἐποίησεν Αἰσϰύλος in the text.
φησὶν Αἰσϰύλος P1. Kuster, and this is continued by Burmann in Bergler's text, though Bergler himself preferred the tradi­ tional reading.
Bentley suggested φασὶν οὕπτ᾽(οἱ ἑπτὰ) ἐν Αἰσϰύλῳ, omitting the ποτὲ at the end of the line, and Blaydes reads οὕπτ᾽ἐν Αἰσϰύλῳ, omitting the Φάσ'192.

But there is no reason for deserting the best MSS.
ἐκτέμνειν is the apter word and is constantly used of sacrifices.

This is also the case in 249, except that Weise, who follows Bekker's suggestion here, retains the MS.

and that Holden, who omits the present scene, follows Bekker's suggestion there.229, 230. τὰ Περσικά R. H. vulgo.
Scaliger, supposing this to be the neu­ ter plural, suggested τὰς Περσικάς which Brunck adopts;
Dindorf in his notes proposed τὼ Περσικά, which is followed by Meineke, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.

The seizure of the Acropolis and of the Sacred Image is one and the same thing;

Their excuse for the change is that the Scholiast explains the words by ἀπὸ μια̂ς γνώμης καὶ κρίσεως, but ὀπὸ is as much out of place with ψήφου as ὑπὸwith γνώμης.
ψη̂φος is the instrument which is to effectuate the destruction.277.

This unfortunate alteration is said to have been suggested by Person and Dobree, but I cannot find that the sug­ gestion was made by either of them.
It is, however, adopted by Enger, Holden, Bergk, and Meineke without (so far as I can see) a shadow of justi­ fication.285.
ἐν τῃ̑ τετραπόλει.
The MSS.
have ἐντετραπόλει and so all editions before Brunck;
and Invernizzi, Bekker, Din­ dorf (in his text but not in his notes), and Weise.
Bekker indeed reports R.'s reading to be ἐνγετεραπόλει " quod neque est ἔν ye ἑτἑρᾳ πόλει, ut Bekkerus censet, neque ἔνγε τετραπόλει, quod Dindorfius inde coniici posse putat, sed scribae error," says Enger.
But in my judge­ ment it is " Bekkeri error," and R. like the other MSS.
intended to give ἐν τε­ τραπόλει. Musgrave (at Eur. Heracl. 81) suggested ὲν Τετραπτόλει, and this is adopted by Brunck and all subsequent editors except as herein appears.
But Τετράπολις when used as a substantive invariably takes the article, and the τῃ̑ could easily drop out before the first two letters of τετραπόλει.
I had there­ fore long ago come to the conclusion that we should read τῃ̑ τετραπόλει, and the same suggestion has been made by Meineke and adopted by Holden and Hall and Geldart.289.

Both Scaliger and Reiske had previously sug­ gested ἤ ποτ which is adopted by Weise;

311.
ἐμπιπράναι MSS. vulgo.
Brunck, thinking that the second syllable was short, according to Dawes's rule, Misc. Crit., p. 196, wrote ἐμπιμπράναι, and he is followed by Invernizzi, Bothe, Bergk, and subsequent editors.
Invernizzi in­ deed says boldly that R. confirms Brunck's alteration, which is absolutely untrue.
And as we know (1) that Dawes's rule is a mere " counsel of per­ fection," freely ignored by the poets (see the Commentary on Plutus 166), (2) that the Athenian writers were averse to the duplicated μ (see the Appendix on Birds 1310), it seems very unwise to depart from the unanimous reading of the MSS.316.

ος I δεινά τ’ .
I have adopted Bentley's presenta­ tion of these two lines which in the MSS.
and editions are very unsatisfactory.
τριταλανται̑α, of course, agrees with στε­ λέχη above.
The readings of the MSS.
and editions are as follows, ἐς πόλιν, ὡς τριτάλαντον βάρος, I δεινότατ’ R. H. 1. P2., and so all editions except Dindorf, Enger, Holden, and Blaydes.
Eg πόλιν, ἐς τριτά­ λαντον τὸβάρος I δεινότατ’ P1. Fl. 1. But the corresponding verses in the strophe are choriambic dimeters, ὑπό re νόμων apya­ λέων I ὑπό τε γερόντων ὀλέθρων, the first long syllable in each line being resolved into two short ones.
The other at­ tempts to bring the line into shape are :
(1) Bothe's, ὡς τριτάλαντον TO βάρος.
which is adopted by Dindorf;
and (2) Reisig's, δευ̑ρο, τριτάλαντόν τι βάρος, which is adopted by Enger, Holden, and Blaydes.
ScOpo is supposed to be equiva­ lent to the ἐς πόλιν of the MSS., which is a strange mistake, for the Chorus of Women are not in the Acropolis, and if the Men were (as they are) carrying the logs ἐς πόλιν, they would not be carrying them, δευ̑ρο, to the Women.345.
σὰς, πολιου̑χ’ Bentley, Enger, Holden, Meineke, Blaydes, Van Leeu­ wen.
πολιου̑χε, σὰς MSS. vulgo.
I accept Bentley's emendation because in these iambic dipodies which do duty for a choriamb, we rarely, if ever, find an anapaest;
and because the corresponding line in the strophe is composed of two pure choriambs, unless indeed it be the missing line.
It is observable that the line in the MSS.
makes the two choriambs rhyme, as they do in the two following verses.
Blaydes, though he adopts Bentley's emendation, yet objects to it on the ground that it separates “ parum eleganter " χρυσολόφα and πο­ λιου̑χε.
But this is really an argument in its favour, since the Πολιου̑χος was not the χρυσόλοφος. See the Commentary.347. ἤν ... ὑποπίμπρῃσιν MSS. vulgo.
The iota subscript was however absent until Brunck added it;
and Reisig, taking the verb to be in the indicative, proposed εἰ ... ὑποπίμπρησιν, which is adopted by Bothe, Enger, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.350.
ἔασ
ον ὦ.These two words are given by R. and apparently the other MSS.
to Stratyllis (except that P1. P2. have στρατηλατὶς) ;
and then the Chorus of Women again take up the speech.
I think that the only editions which follow R. are Invernizzi and Dindorf's Oxford edition ;
but almost all the older editions give both lines to Stratyllis, and all the modern editors continue them to the Chorus.
The reason for introducing the name of Stratyllis is that she was the Coryphaeus of the Women's Chorus, and that while the songs are sung by the full Chorus, the dialogue is, as a rule, carried on by the Coryphaeus alone.
But to prefix to the speeches the name of the Coryphaeus, or as Van Leeuwen does the title κορυφαι̑ος, is to place him in the position of an actor and gives rise to great awkwardness.
It is always the Chorus who are speaking, though in the dialogue they speak through the mouth of their Coryphaeus.
He is merely their mouthpiece and has no independent existence.
However I have elsewhere left "Stratyllis" as the speaker's name.352.
ἰδει̑ν.
This word is omitted in R. H. and in all editions before Kuster, but is found in I. P1. P2. F1. 1. and is inserted by Kuster (who had access to and 1.) and all subsequent editors.-
This remark equally applies to χαμα̑ζ’ in line 358, and to ἤδη in line 360.357.
αὐτάς MSS. vulgo.
This seems quite right, but Bergk suggested αὐται̑ς, which is introduced into the text by Meineke, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.362.
παταξάτω Kat στα̑σ’ Florent Chretien, Bentley, Person.
The MSS.
(except the conjecturers P1. and F1.) have παταξάτω τις καὶ στα̑σ’ and so all editions before Brunck.
This is a syllable too much, and either τις or καὶ must go.
It seems to me that the omission of τις improves the language and makes the line far more rhythmical;
but Brunck followed his MS.
P1. in omitting καὶ and subsequent editors have followed Brunck.365.
ἅπτου R. H. vulgo.

and Invernizzi.
But in Frogs 474 R. has πλευμάνων, and that Comedy is far more accurately presented in the Ravenna MS.
than is the Lysistrata.380.

In Wasps 772 we have the future ἡλιάσομαι.
Bentley therefore proposed to read here ὴλιάξεις.
AndsoF1.
And ἡλιἅζει is read by Cobet, Meineke, and subsequent editors.
But it seems to me that the future is required, and that it is more reason­ able to regard ἡλιάζω as an irregular verb with ἡλιάξω for the active, and ἡλιάσομαι for the middle future.
In words like this which were in constant use in the daily life of the citizens irregularities are to be expected.384.

ἀνα­ βλαστάνῃς MSS.
editions before Dindorf.
But Brunck, observing that according to Dawes's rule (see on 311 supra) the vowel before βλ would be long, and that the Comic writers rarely if ever used ὅπως with a subjunctive without of, and that both these objections might be met by reading of βλαστάνῃς, yet declared most truly that Dawes's rule was made too strict, and therefore retained the MS.
reading.
But on the other hand both the rules mentioned by Brunck are, though not universally true, yet in accordance with the general trend of Comic usage, and where they can be followed by so very slight an alteration it seems desirable to make it.

ἀμβλαστανει̑ς Meineke.388. πυκινοὶ H. P2. l. Zanetti and all subsequent editors before Brunck.
ποι­ κινοὶ R. Junta, Cratander.
Bentley pro­ posed πυκνοὶ which was afterwards found in P1.
and is read by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
But P1. is a MS.
of no authority whatever for the traditional reading;
πυκινοὶ, the ordinary epic form, is found, though rarely, in writers of this period ;
and suits the rhythm of the line far better than πυκνοί ;
R.'s reading, though erroneous, is in favour of the trisyllabic form ;
and therefore it seems undesirable to reject the great authority of the MSS.391.
ὥρασι μὲν R. H. (and, though they divide the words differently, P2. F1. and 1.) vulgo, but Zanetti, Farreus, and Scaliger to Brunck inclusive write ὥραισι ;
and Bothe in his second edition inserts a γ’ before ὥρασι.
P1., trying to give the full proverb, corrects ὁ μὴ ὥρας ἴοι.398.
ἀκολαστάματα.
The MSS.
divide this word into two, ἀκόλστ’ ἄσματα, and so all editions before Dindorf except Bothe, the iota subscript (ᾄσματα) being added by Portus.
This was obviously wrong, and Bentley suggested ἀκολαστή­ ματα which is read by Bothe in both editions.
But Dobree, referring to 406 infra and to Demosthenes against Lacri­ tus 2G (p. 930) τοιαυ̑τα ταύτων ἐστὶ τὰ κακουργήματα, and observing that in Bekkeri Anecd., p. 367. 21, the term ἀκαλαστάματα is attributed to Aristo­ phanes, proposed ἀκολαστάσματα, which is read by Dindorf, Eager, and all sub­ sequent editors except Hall and Geldart (-who revert to the MS. reading) and Bothe.400.
αἴ τἄλλα θ’ MSS.
and all editions except Blaydes, who says "Malim αἴ γ’ ἄλλα θ’ cum Dobraeo," and alters the text accordingly.
But this is hardly fair to Dobree who merely observed that he had thought of a? yἄλλα θ’ but adds, with justice, that the common reading is superior, " sed praestat vulgata.

But Person observed that although the antepenult.
of δακτυλίδιον when derived from δακτύ­ λιος, a ring, is long, yet when derived from δάκτυλας, a toe, it is necessarily short.
And he proposed to remodel this and the preceding line by reading TO δακτυλίδιον TOV ποδὸς I του̑ τη̑ς γυναικός μου πιέζει.
And this is adopted by Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen, but involves too great a departure from the original.
Of the additional syllable supplied by conjec­ ture, it seems to me that Reisig's is the most probable.
423.

Both Wake­ field and Dobree suggested ἀράξετε, which is approved by Dindorf in his notes and adopted by Enger, Meineke, and subse­ quent editors.
But ἀρήξετε, charge to the rescue, gives a very good sense, and the verb is a favourite one with Aristophanes, see supra 304, Wasps 402, Thesm.
696, Plutus 476;
and it does not seem jus­ tifiable to displace it for a verb, which may give even a better sense, but which is never employed by Aristophanes in this simple form.461. παύσασθ’ I. P1. P2. F1. Portus to Bergler, Bentley, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen. παύσεσθ’ R. editions before Portus. παύεσθ’ H. Brunck, recentiores, except as aforesaid.465.

But I think that a negative answer is required.
Lysistrata's ques­ tion is
Think you that there is no χολὴ in women.
The οὐκ is to be taken with ἐνει̑ναι, not with οἴει.
To which the Magistrate replies, No, by Apollo, 1 don't think that;
I know that they have plenty of it if there is a tavern-keeper at hand.468.
εἰς λόγον R. vulgo. εὶς (or ἐς) λόγους H. 1. P1. P2. F1. Kuster to Invernizzi (inclusive), and Bekker, Weise, Holden, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
And Person (at Eur. Phoen. 714 ὡς εἰς λόγους ξυνη̑ψα Πλυνείκει μολών is supposed to have been in favour of the latter reading, though in truth he is only quoting, without comment, what was the received reading in his time.
εἰς λόγον in this sense is very common in Aristophanes ;
στεμφύλῳ εἰς λόγον ἔλθῃ Knights 806, ξυνελθει̑ν τὰς τριήρεις εἰς λόγον Id. 1300, ἐς λόγον ἐλθει̑ν Clouds 470.477.
eT' ἀνεκτέα τάδ’ Dobree, Dindorf, recentiores, except as hereinafter men­ tioned.
eGO' ἀνεκτἀ τάδ’ R. H. editions before Dindorf, and Bothe afterwards.
But Bentley suggested ἔτ’ , which has since been found in the other MSS.
eT' ἀνεκτἀ τάδ’ I. P1. F1. ἔτ’ ἀνεκτὰ τάδε y' P2. Blaydes, Hall and Geldart. ἔτ’ ἀνεκτἀ ταυ̑τ’ Bergk.
Dobree suggested ἀνεκτέα, referring to Oed. Col. 883 ἆρ’ οὐχ ὕβρις τάδ’;
ὕβρις, ἀλλ’ ἀνεκτέα.
To which Blaydes objects that ‘‘ἀνεκτὸς significat tolerabilis, ἀνεκτέος tolerandus.”
But tole­ randus is the very signification required;
and ἀνεκ
τέος answers far more suitably to the βασανιτέον which follows.479. μετ’ ἐμου̑ MSS. vulgo.
In order to avoid the hiatus after these words Reisig proposed to add y', and Bergk inserted ’σθ’.
The latter is followed by Holden and Blaydes.
But a little composite lyric ode like this is not subject to the strict rules of a regular anapaestic system.486.
καὶ μὴν αὐτω̑ν MSS.
vulgo.
For αὐτω̑ν Hamaker suggests πάντων (which Meineke actually brings into the text), Bergk πάντων or αὐτὸς, and Blaydes ὑμω̑ν or αὐτό γε.
The reason for these futile attempts to corrupt a perfectly genuine text is the change from the 3rd person in the present line to the 2nd person in the next, than which nothing can be more common.
We have another in­ stance a few lines below, τω̑ν ἀνδρω̑ν ἄττ’ ἐποιει̑τε.487.
ἀπεκλείστε τοι̑σι μοχλοι̑σιν Sca­ liger, Faber, Brunck, recentiores, except Invernizzi and Blaydes.
And so both Bentley and Dawes had corrected the line.
ἀπεκλείσατε τοι̑ς μοχλοι̑ς R. H. editions before Portus (except Grynaeus), and Invernizzi afterwards.
ἀπεκλείσατε μοχλοι̑ς P1. P2. F1. 1. Grynaeus, Portus, Buster, Bergler.
Portus attempted to mend the metre by changing πόλιν into ἀκρόπολιν, and this error was continued till Brunck's time, even by those who read τοι̑σι μοχλοι̑σι, though Scaliger pro­ tested against it in his note.
Blaydes writes μοχλοι̑ς ἀπέκλῃσαν.494.
τί δὲ δεινὸν Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
τί δεινὸν MSS.
editions before Brunck.499.
ὡς σωθήσει K.T.X.
Neither in R. nor in H. is this line found in the text;
but in R. somebody has written it at the foot of the page, and in H. it is given in the margin.
Nor is it found in any printed edition before Brunck.
But it appears in the text of I. P1. P2. F1. l.;
and all subsequent editors have followed Brunck in inserting it in the text.
It seems to me a great pity that it was ever discovered;
it creates an intolerable repetition ;
and I suspect that it is a line invented by F1.
or some other conjec­ turer, as an alternative to the genuine reading.
See on 20 supra.
The ye in the Magistrate's speech was added by Brunck.500.
ἀλλὰ ποιητέα (or ποητέα) MSS.
Bentley, Brunck, recentiores. aXX' ἀποκ­ τέα Junta, Cratander, Grynaeus to Portus (inclusive).
But this is not due to a separate tradition.
It arises, as Brunck also observed, from an error in reading the MSS.
In R., and probably in all the MSS., ἀλλ’ ἀποητέα might easily be mistaken for ἀλλ’ ἀποκτέα by a careless reader.
ἀλλ’ ἀποδεκτέα Zanetti, Farreus, Florent Chretien, Scaliger, Faber, Kuster, Bergler;
no doubt a correction by Zanetti or some earlier scholar.
506.
σαυτῇ κρώξαις.
All the MSS.
and editions have κρώξαις till Meineke thought fit to corrupt it into ῎Κρωξας, an error which is followed by Vau Leeuwen.
The optative is obviously right.
The Magistrate's reply is equivalent to the familiar ἐς κεφαλὴν σοί.507.
του̑ μὲν προτέρ
ου πολέμου κατὰ.
See the Commentary.
In the MSS.
and editions generally the line runs ἡμει̑ς τὸν ήνειχόμεσθα), which is not easily distin­ guishable from nonsense.
Person pro­ posed καὶ χρόνον ἠνεσχόμεθ’ ὑμω̑ν, which is read by Meineke and Holden, but does not seem to mend matters.
Bergk pro­ posed τὸν μὲν πρότερ
ον πολ
έμου χρόνον ἐξηνεσχόμεθ’ ὑμω̑ν, which would be better if for πporeρ
ον he had written προτέρου. Van Leeuwen, as usual, inserts an entirely unauthorized line, ἡμει̑ς τὸν μὲν .509.
καίτοὐκ Reiske, Dobree, Enger, recentiores, except Bothe. κᾆτ’ οὐκ (with or without the iota subscript) MSS.

εὐθὺς δ’.
I have inserted these words to supply a foot which is wanting in the MSS.
except P1. and Fl., and (without a lacuna marked) in all editions before Brunck;
and (with a lacuna marked) in Enger, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.
The two excepted MSS.
insert δήπου before βούλευμ’, which is followed by Brunck to Weise inclusive, though, as Dindorf says, it is obviously an infelicitous conjecture of some grammarian.
Bentley proposed to insert πολλῷ in the same place ;
and Person τούτου, which is followed by Holden and Blaydes.
But the omission is clearly at the commencement of the line;
and Brunck proposed to commence it with ἀλλὰ τάχ’Dobree by αὖθις δ’;
Dindorf by κἄπειθ’, and Blaydes by μετὰ τᾶυθ’, whilst Van Leeuwen reads ταχέως δ’.–ὑμῶν Pl. F1. Zanetti, recentiores.
ἡμῶν R. H. P2. Junta and Cratander.524.
οὐ δῆτ’ ἔσθ’. ἔσθ’ is omitted in the MSS., which leave the line a syllable short;
and so all the editions before Brunck ;
and Bekker afterwards.
Tyr­ whitt suggested οὐδεὶς δῆθ’, and Reisig οὐ δῆτ’, οὐχ but the real question is between the οὐ δῆτ ἔσθ’ of Brunck and Porson, and the οὐ δῆτ’εἶφ’ of Dobree.
The former, which I prefer, was adopted by Brunck to Dindorf (inclusive) and by Van Leeuwen;
but Dindorf in his notes went over to Dobree, and has been followed by all subsequent editors except Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.
Dobree also remarked " Si constaret ἦ δ’ ἕτερός τις pro ἦ δ’ ὃς ἕτερός τις did, ut 514, hoc mallem," a suggestion which I should have thought most improbable, but which is adopted by Blaydes.
Dobree himself, however, finally preferred οὐ δῆτ’ἔσθ’.528.
κἀντισιωπᾶν Kuster, recentiores, except Hall and Geldart.
κἀντισιωπᾶθ’ R. H. editions before Kuster, and Hall and Geldart afterwards.
καὶ σιωπᾶθ’ P1. P2. F1. 1.531. περὶ τὴνκεφαλήν ;
In order to make this little system of dimeters cor­ respond with that in 597-607 Enger proposed to divide this line into two, viz.
first περὶ τὴν κεφαλήν ;
μή νυν ξῴην, and secondly aXX' εἰ σοἄστιν τοῦτ ἐμπόδιον.
He did not indeed alter the text, but that has been done by Meineke and one or two others.
Most editors, however, have wisely forborne to tamper with the text.
It is by no means certain that the two systems were intended to cor­ respond closely, and very many altera­ tions are required to make them do so.
The dimeter systems which wind up the long tetrameters in the Wasps (621-30 and 719-24) do not correspond, though those in the Birds (523-38 and 611-26) do.
And I myself retain the opinion which I expressed more than forty years ago, in the Commentary on the Peace, that in these little corresponding systems we are not to expect the same exact metrical concordance which we find in the lyrical strophes and antistrophes intended to be sung by the Chorus.535.
τοῦτονδὴ Bentley.
The readings here are almost identical with those in 604 infra.539.
ἀπαίρετ’ ὦ. The MSS. read αἴρεσθ’ to, and so all editions except Grynaeus before Brunck;
and Bothe afterwards.
This of course is against the metre, and Bentley suggested αἰρώμεθ’ ὦ, which Hall and Geldart read.
But all the MSS.
and the Scholiast give the second person.
Grynaeus has αἴρεσθε δ’ ὦ,and Scaliger proposed αἴρεσθέ γ’ὦ, but both δὲ and γε would be out of place.
Brunck substi­ tuted ἀπαίρετ’ ὦ, observing “ Scholiastes, textus vocem exponens, ἀναχωρήσατατε ait;
quae interpretatio manifeste refertur ad ἀπαίρετ’.
Hesychius ἀπαίρει, ἀναχωρεῖ.
Eccl. 818 μεστὴν ἀπῆρα τὴν γνάθονχαλκῶν ἔχων.
Frequens historicis verbum tarn de terrestri quam de maritimo itinere."
It seems to me that the compound verb, is here more probable than the simple one.
Brunck's emendation has been followed by all subsequent editors except Bothe, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.
Meineke in his V. A. proposes ἄραισθ’ ἂν, referring to Frogs 437, where how­ ever the meaning is quite different, and this is adopted by Holden.541.
ἕγωγεΚ.T.X.
This and the fol­ lowing verse are corrupted in the MSS., and it would be tedious to enumerate all the suggestions that have been made for setting them right.
It is necessary to see clearly what their metre should be.
The present line consists of a mono­ syllabic base followed by two paeons and two cretics — |.
The following verse consists of three paeons and one cretic —
—In the present line R. H. P2. have ἐγὼ γὰρ οὔποτεκάμοιμ’ ἂν ἀρ­ χουμένη, and so all editions before Brunck.
This was quite right except that a tro­ chee was substituted for the first paeon.
Those inveterate conjecturers Pl. Fl., however, substituted an iambic verse ἐγὼ yap οὔποτ’ἂν κάμοιμ ὀρχουμένη which is quite out of place, but is adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Weise.
Her­ mann proposed to restore the first paeon by reading ἐγώ yap ἕτ’av, and Enger by ἕγωγεγὰρav, which has been generally followed.
Blaydes, though retaining Enger's reading in his text, suggested ὼς αὐδέποτ’ ἔγωγ’ ἀποκάμοιμ’ ἂν ὀρχουμένη, a very good line, but quite unlike the reading of any MS.
or grammarian.
It is, however, brought into the text by Van Leeuwen.542.
οὐδέ γόνατ’ κ.τ.λ.
See the pre­ ceding note.
In the MSS.
this line runs οἀδὲ (R. H., οὔτε P1. P2. F1. 1.) τὰ γόνατα κόπος ἑλεῖ(R. H. P2., ἓλοι P1. Fl.) μου καματηράς, and so all editions before Weise;
and Bergk and Hall and Geldart afterwards.
Bentley emended the second half of the line as in the text ἕλοι μεκαματηρὸςἄν, and Hermann the first half as in the text οὐδὲ γάνατ ἂνκάπ
ος.
The whole line as in the text is read by Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Enger, Holden, Meineke, and Van Leeu­ wen.
Blaydes substitutes a verse of his own, οὐδέ με τὰ γοῦνα καματ
ηρὸς av ἕλοι κόπος.545, 546.
In most of the MSS.
there is a δὲ before θράσος and σοφὸν, but not before φιλόπολις;
but recent editors have mostly arranged it as in my text, some however inserting τὸ before σοφόν.549.

The MS.
reading is cer­ tainly right.
See the Commentary.
The alternative suggestions could not have been made had their authors realized the fact that the Chorus of Women in the orchestra, the women who are speaking, are the old women, and the actors on the stage, the women who are addressed, the young women.
The quotations in Suidas and the other authors are valueless to determine a reading, except when they are made for the sake of a particular word or phrase, in which case they are good evidence of the reading in the MS.
which those authors used.
Brunck truly observes that each of the two substantives ought to have its own adjective ;
and that in­ stead of introducing into Aristophanes the misquotations in other authors "corrigendi e Comico Suidas, Athenaeus, et qui eum descripsit Eustathius."551.

Cobet, however, objected to ἐντέξῃοn the ground, I suppose, on which so many of his blunders were based, viz. that the future middle (τέξομαι) being in use, the future active (τέξω) could not be used.
This is of course an entire mistake, and even as regards this very verb Aristophanes himself twice employs the future active, Knights 1037, Thesm.
509. However, Hirschig conjectured ἐνστάξῃ, which Van Leeuwen reads;
Meineke conjectured, and inserted in the text, ἐντείνῃ ;
and Mr. Richards conjectures ἐμπήξῃ.557.
κἀν ταῖσι χύτραις κἀν.

There is a doubt about the reading of R. and H. R. is said to have ἐπὶκλίνεις, but it is possible that the abbreviation of the last syllable may have been intended for -ης, and if so the accent shows that it was so intended.

And this seems to have been the reading of the Scholiast, whose gloss, λείπει βοηθὸς, shows that he took the line to mean " He (Aristogeiton) is my Helper" against the women.
It is unnecessary to consider whether the words can mean this, since αὐτὸς is metrically impossible.
αὐτὸΒοthe, Dindorf, and subsequent editors before Blaydes.
This reading is attributed to Scaliger, but wrongly.
Scaliger proposed αἴτιος yap (meaning I suppose to omit μοι), but added " alii αὔτως vel avro."
Bergler in his note says “mallem avro.
"
With this reading the line is translated by Enger " illud ipsum meum est ut tan­ quam alter Aristogiton huius anus imperium affectantis maxillas feriam," but it is difficult to see how αὐτὸcan have that meaning.

But I entirely agree with Blaydes, who says " quum hie non de pugnando ἀφ' ἵππων,sed de insidendo ἐφ'ἵππων (ἐποχει̑σθαι) agatur, praestat haud dubie vulgata.

Enger inserted the μ'earlier in the line before εἰ.
Bergk proposed to insert it after ἀρει̑ς, and this is done by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.699.
πα̑σι καὶ τοι̑ς γείτοσιν MSS.
vulgo.
Under the idea that πα̑σι would include τοι̑ς γείτοσι (as to which see the Com­ mentary) Bentley proposed to change πα̑σι into παισὶ, and Elmsley to change καὶ τοι̑ς into τοι̑σι, which is done by Blaydes.
But both these changes would leave the Athenian citizens out of account.701.

It is not known to what MS.
Bentley referred.—φέρων MSS. vulgo.
Suidas, s. v. ψηφοφ
ορία,citing this line from memory, wrote the last word θέλων, whence both Bentley (doubtfully) and Person (confidently) proposed θενών.
And θενών as read by Bothe in his first edition, but not in his second.709. ἄθυμον περιπατει̑ν(without τ') Dobree, Bekker, Weise. ἄθυμον περιπα­ τει̑ν τ' MSS. vulgo.
Person first, and Meineke afterwards, proposed ἀθυμει̑ν, which is read by Holden, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.
But this does not meet the difficulty.
The misconduct of her young comrades does not make Lysis­ trata"walk up and down " simpliciter;
it makes her walk up and down" in a despondent mood.725.
κατέσπασα MSS. vulgo.
Meineke (in his V. A.) proposed ἀνέσπασα, which is read by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.
Meineke's reason is that “ κατέσπασα cum κάτω πέεσθαι διανοουμένην aegre coit," but it is plain that he dill not realize the situation.
Before the deserter on her sparrow's back could fly down to the lower city, she had to fly up to surmount the wall of the Acro­ polis ;
and it was only while she was rising for that purpose that she would be within Lysistrata's reach.
She must have been still within the Acropolis, and therefore still on her upward flight, when Lysistrata seized her by the hair and dragged her down from the sparrow's back to the ground.
So soon as she began κάτω πέτεσθαι she would have been out of Lysistrata's reach.
κατέ­ σπασα is the very word required and ἀνέσπασα is altogether unsuitable.
Meineke would also change χθὲς into τρὶς, and μίαν into Μίκαν, but there he has found no followers.727.
ἕλκουσιν MSS. vulgo.
See the Commentary.
Strange to say Wake­ field (at Eur. lou 1410 παυ̑σαι πλέκουσα) proposed to alter this into πλέκουσιν;
and more strangely still Dobree made the same suggestion.
And Meineke says " aut πλέκουσιν verum videtur, aut quod ego conieci λέγουσιν.”
Yet ἕλκου­ σιν is beyond all question the right word, and Holden is the only editor who has brought πλέκουσιν into the text.—ἡδὶ Elmsley (at Ach. 108), Dobree, Fritzsche (at Frogs 170), Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen. ἤδη MSS. vulgo.730.
κατακοπτόμενα MSS. vulgo.
The Etym. Magn.
under σεὺς has κατακαμπτό­ μενα, whence κατακαμπτόμενα is read by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Van Leeu­ wen.
They attribute this reading to Brunck, but though Brunck at first adopted it, he afterwards altogether repudiated it, referring to the first section of Lucian's Adversus Indoctum, where κατακόπτω occurs in a similar connexion.733.
διαπετάννυ P1. P2. F2 1. Bentley, Brunck, recentiores, except Invernizzi.

ἀπέρχομαι R. H. P1. F1. vulgo.
ἐπέρχομαι I. P2. Kuster proposed ἐπαν­ έρχομαι, and this is approved, but not read, by Brunck and Dindorf.
Brunck says "legi possit ἀνέρχομαι vel ἐπανέρχο­ pat.
sed vulgatum bonum est;
subau­ ditur οἴκοθεν,ἐξ οἴκου.”However ἀνέρχο­ μαι is read by Enger, Bergk, and all subsequent editors.

TOVTO σὺ 1. P1. P2. F1. 1. Scaliger (in notes), Kuster, recentiores, except as hereafter appears.
τούτου σὺ R. H. all editions before Kuster, and Invernizzi afterwards.
Before Kuster had dis­ covered the true reading in his MSS. (I. and 1.), Bentley suggested τουτουὶ, which is read by Dindorf, Weise, Enger, Bergk, and Van Leeuwen.
But the emphatic σὺ is found in all the MSS.
Reisig suggested του̑δε σὺ, which is read by Meineke and Holden.761.
κακκαβιζουσω̑ν R. H. P2. and (originally) P1. vulgo.
κακκαβαζουσω̑ν l. and (as corrected) P1. Dindorf (in text), Meineke, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.
Dobree proposed κικκαβαζουσω̑ν (referring to Birds 261, where κικκαβαυ̑ιs given as the note of the owl), and this is approved by Dindorf in his notes and read by Enger.
κικκαβιζουσω̑ν Blaydes, Vail Leeuwen.
But the word is found in Aristotle, Athenaeus, Pollux, Aelian, and elsewhere, and uniformly begins with κακ-.κικκαβαυ̑ was a mere fancy word of Aristophanes.763.
οὐκ οἴει | ποθει̑ν MSS. vulgo.
οὐ ποθει̑ν | οἴεσθ' Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.
This is very plausible, but it seems impossible to desert the reading of all the MSS., especially as Aristophanes was rather given to placing οἴει at the end of a line.
Apart from the present pas­ sage, he has done so thrice in this very play ;
supra 247, 464, and infra 1149.772.
τὰ δ' ὑπέρτερα νέρτερα MSS. vulgo.
There seems no ground for Dobree's proposed transposition τὰ δὲ νέρτερ' ὑπέρτερα.
The two readings are iden­ tical in meaning, and the MS.
reading is supported by the Scholiast;
see the Commentary.
In the corresponding phrase we invariably find ἄνω placed before κάτω.
Dobree's proposal is how­ ever adopted by Blaydes.774.
ῆν δὲ διαστω̑σιν (or -ι P1. P2. F'. 1. Kuster, recentiores, except Invernizzi. ῆν δὲ δ' ἀποστω̑σιν (or- ι) R. H. Invernizzi.
ἢν δ' ἀποστω̑σιν editions before “ Scaliger's." ἢν δ' up' ἀποστω̑σιν " Scaliger," "Faber," Bentley.
But the reading in the text, which was not then known, is better in itself, and accounts for the double δὲ in R. and H. —777-80.
σαφὴς ... προδώσομεν.
These four lines were assigned to the " Chorus of Women " by the MSS.
and by all editions before Enger.
That this could not be strictly right is shown by the words ἀλλ' εἰσίωμεν, for the Chorus, who were in the orchestra, could have had no idea of entering into the Acropolis.
The lines are obviously spoken by the young women on the stage, who had been intending to desert, but are brought their senses by hearing the oracle;
or rather they are spoken by one on behalf of the rest.
Enger therefore transferred them to the First Woman, but I doubt if we are able to specify the particular woman who speaks them.
But then comes the astonishing Beer who leaves only half the first line to the woman, and assigns all the rest of the speech to Lysistrata, the only person who could not possibly have spoken it.
The words ὦ πάντες θεοὶ are plainly the exclamation of persons hearing the oracle for the first time, and in the three lines which follow they are expressing their penitence, and the change of mind which the oracle has wrought.
Yet Beer's absurdity is followed by Bergk, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.785.
ἦν ποτε νέος Hermann, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen, and the alteration was approved by Dindorf in his notes, and adopted by him in his " Metra Aeschyli, &c. ” published shortly afterwards.
ἦν νεανίσκος MSS.
vulgo.
Hermann was the first to bring these two systems into proper metrical order, and his rather daring alteration here is fully justified by the necessities of the metre.
The systems are partly in trochaics, but mostly in paeonies with an admixture of spondees.
The present line consists of two paeons and a erotic, the corre­ spending line in the antistrophe being ἦν τις ἀΐδρυτ
ος ἀβάτοισιν ἐν, where the second syllable of ἀΐδρυτος, usually long, is short.
Weise omits νεανίσκος and reads νεανίας, in a line by itself, before ἦν.798. κρόμμυον (or κρόμυον) MSS. vulgo.
κρομμύων Bentley, Blaydes,Van Leeuwen.799.
κἀνατείνας λακτίσαι Bentley, Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores.
κἀνατείνας TO σκέλος λακτίσαί MSS. all editions (except Bothe) before Dindorf.
Bentley rejected τὸ σκέλος, which is obviously a gloss that has crept into the text, and it is plain that the Scholiast did not read it.809.
ἦν τις ἀΐδρυτος F1. 1. Suidas, s. v. ἀπορρω̑γας, Hermann, Dindorf, Bergk, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen.
τις ἦν ἀΐδρυτος R. H. P1. P2. all editions (except Bothe) before Dindorf;
and Weise afterwards ;
save that some of the earliest editions have ἀῢδρυτ
ος and some ἀνίδρυτος. Bentley, retaining νεανίσκ
ος in the strophe, proposed to read ἦν ἀΐδρυ
τός τις here, and this is done by Bothe, Enger, Holden, Meineke, and Hall and Geldart.
But the metre had not been fully ascer­ tained in Bentley's time.812.
οὗτος ἄρ' Hermann,Bothe,Dindorf, recentiores, except Bergk and Hall and Geldart.
οὗτος οὖν MSS.
vulgo.
All these changes are necessitated by the metre.
There is a line missing here which I have supplied by writing (in brackets) ἄθλιος ἀφ' ὑμῶν.
Other suggestions are κοὐκέτι κατη̑λθεν (from 792 supra) Bisetus, which Bothe brings into the text;
εἰς ἀγρὸν ἔρημον Meineke ;
and ἐς τόπον ἔρημον or εἰς ὄρος ἔρημον Blaydes, the former being brought into the text by Van Leeuwen.817.
ὑμα̑ς ἀντεμίσει.
This is Dobree's suggestion for the ὑμῶν ἀντεμίσει of the MSS.
and editions which yields no satisfactory meaning.
I do not think that thewords will bear the interpretation which Blaydes gives them " in answer to you, in return for your hatred of us."
They seem rather to be an alteration by some grammarian who supposed that by τοὺς πονηροὺς Stratyllis meant only a particular section of the men, and not men universally.
Bergk suggested ἡμῖν and Meineke and Holden read ὑμῖν.
At 819 1. P1. P2. F1. and 1. cease, recom­ mencing with line 890.831.
ἂνδρ' ἂνδρ' ὁρῶ Brunck, recen­ tiores.
ἂνδρ' opS R. H. editions before Brunck.
But Florent Chretien had said “Legerem ἀλλ' ἄνδρ' ὁρῶ vel ἄνδρ' ἄνδρ' ὁρῶ " and Bentley “Lege ἄνδρα bis."839. εἴη MSS. vulgo.
Dobree is said to have suggested ἤδη.
I do not know where he did so.
In his Adversaria he proposes σὸν ἂν ἔργον or σὸν ἔργον av.
But Dindorf says " Scribendum ἤδη cum Dobraeo ";
and ἤδη is read by Enger, Meineke, and subsequent editors.
The MS.
reading, however, gives a good sense, Be it your task.
στρέφειν at the end of the line is changed by Blaydes into τρέπειν.843.
παραμένουσά y Bentley.
R. H. and all editions before Brunck have παραμένουσ', leaving the line a syllable too short.
Bentley proposed παραμένουσά γ' and Porson σοι παραμένουσ'.
There is not much to choose between these two readings.
The former is adopted by Brunck, Dindorf, Bergk, and others, the latter by Enger, Meineke, Blaydes, and others.851.
καλέσω 'γὼ Μυρρίνην σοι ;
Kuster (in notes), Enger, Holden, Bergk, recen­ tiores.
R. H. and all editions before Brunck have τὴν before Μυρρίνην, making the line a syllable too long.
Kuster, as we see, proposed to omit the τὴν.
Brunck omitted the 'γὼ, in which he is followed by all editors before Enger.
For καλέσω Cobet proposed 'κκαλέσω, which is read by Meineke and Holden.862.
ἔγωγέ σοι νὴ τὸν Δί' Bentley, Dindorf, Weise, Enger, recentiores, ex­ cept Bothe and Van Leeuwen.
The σοι is omitted, contra metrum, by R. H. and by all editions before Brunck ;
and by Inver­ nizzi, Bothe, and Bekker afterwards, Brunck read ἔγωγε νὴ At" αὐτίκ', Iran Leeuwen ἔγωγε μέντοι νὴ Δί'.864. καταβᾶσα R. H. vulgo. Herwerden (V. A.) proposes to change καταβᾶσα into ἀναβᾶσα.
And he gives as his reason "Cinesias enim est in aditu, Lysistrata vero supra in ipsa arce."
One would have thought this a conclusive argument for reading καταβᾶσα.
Lysistrata, being on the top of the wall at the top of the Acropolis, could only go up higher by ascending into the clouds.
To find Myrrhina she has to descend from the wall into the Acropolis itself.865.
ἔχω ye τῷ βίῳ R. H. vulgo.
Hermann suggested ἔγωγ'ἔχω βίου, which Meineke and Holden read ;
Cobet ἐγᾦδα τῷ βίῳ which Blaydes reads ;
and Blaydes ἔχω 'n τοῦ βίου, whence Van Leeuwen reads ἔχω 'τι τῷ βίῳ.866. ν Grynaeus, " Scaliger," recentiores.
ξυνῆλθεν R. H. editions before Scaliger except Grynaeus.895. διατιθῖς MSS.
editions except "Scaliger'' before Bothe's first;
and Bekker, Meineke, Holden, and Van Leeuwen afterwards.
διατίθης “Scali­ ger," Bothe, and save as aforesaid editions after Bekker.
This is the old question, discussed by Person on Orestes 141 whether the Attics ever used -εῖς for the second person of verbs in -ημι.
As the MSS.
are our only authority on the subject, it seems to me safer to follow them.904.
κατακλίθητι MSS. vulgo.
Elmsley citing this line for another purpose in his note on Ach.
1033 writes, whether purposely or by a slip of memory, κατα­ κλίνηθι, which is accordingly read by Dindorf, Enger, Bergk, and all subse­ quent editors.906.
ὧ Μυρρίνιον R. H. editions before Brunck, and Invernizzi and Weise after­ wards.
See the Commentary.

But the οὐδὲ seems rather out of place here, though quite right in line 934.
ἀλλ' οὐ δέομ', OVK, ἔγωγε Weise.934. μὰ Dobree, Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Enger, recentiores, except Bothe.
And so, without the final γ', P2.l. μὰ Δί' οὐ δέομαί γ' R. H. all editions before Brunck.
This left the line a syllable short, which Brunck supplied by changing γ' into ’'γωγ' and so all subsequent editors before Weise;
and Bothe afterwards.
But Dobree's change of οὐ into οὐδὲ is far better.
P1. and F1. supplied the missing syllable by changing γ' into δῆ.944.
'Ρόδιον MSS.
vulgo.
And so the Scholiast, and Eustathius on Odyssey ii.
85. Bergk said “forte ρ̒όδινον," which is read by Meineke and Blaydes.
Their excuse is " Rhodii unguenti nusquam alibi mentio fit."
They had overlooked the passage in Pliny which I have quoted in the Commentary.956.
ταυτηνὶ.
This is Reisig's proposal, which was approved by Dindorf in his notes and adopted by Weise and subse­ quent editors.
ταύτην MSS.
and all editions before Weise.
The alteration is desirable for the purpose of making this line correspond with its fellow in the antistrophe μὰ Δι' ἀλλὰ φίλη καὶ
παγγλυκερά.958.
τιτθήν I. P2. l. Brunck, recentiores.
κύστην R. and so (or κύσθην) all editions before Brunck.
κύστιν H. τίθην P1. F1. For τὴν τιτθήν John Seager suggested τινα τιτθήν, which is read by Blaydes.
We should perhaps read τάχα τὴν τιτθήν to make the line correspond with 972.959.
ἐν δεινῷ MSS. vulgo.
Cobet suggested ἦ SeLva, which Blaydes and Van Leeuwen adopt.
It certainly heightens the tragic character of the lines, and I should willingly have adopted it had it not been certain that Aristophaneswrote ἐν δεινῷ.961.
αἶ, at, αἶ.
I have added the third αἶ, the corresponding line in the anti­ strophe being a complete dimeter ξυστρέψας καὶ ξυγγογγυλίσας.962.
yap ἀν ἢ νέφρ
ος R. H. vulgo.
γὰρ ἢ νέφρος P1. P2. F1. l.
Bekker omits the ἢ, but this can be only a clerical error since he professes to follow R. Dindorf in his text has δ' ἂν, apparently confusing this line with 964, but in his notes he reverts to the common reading.
Bergk reads γὰρ νέφρ
ος ἂν;
Meineke reads γὰρ ἔτ' ἂν νέφρος, which is adopted by Blaydes and Van Leeuwen.963.
ψυχὴ MSS. vulgo.
Scaliger says "Alii ψωλὴ,” an alteration which is again suggested by Brunck, and is made by Blaydes.964.
ποῖος 8' ὄρρ
ος.
The line is so read by the Scholiast on Frogs 223, and by Florent Chretien, Bergk, Meineke, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
ποῖος 8' ἂν ὄρρ
ος R. H. P1. F1. editions before Brunck.
It is necessary to omit either the ἂν as in the text or the 8'.
The latter course is adopted by P2. 1. and Scaliger in his notes and by Brunck and, save as aforesaid, subsequent editors.
The omission of ἂν is more in accord with the preceding line.970.
XO. ΓΥ. μὰ Δί', ἀλλὰ φίλη.
This line is given to the Chorus of Women by R. H. and 1.
It is, however, given to Cinesias by P1. P2. Fl., and this being followed by Junta has prevailed in almost all the printed editions.
The only editors who have reclaimed it for the Women are Invernizzi, Bergk, Meineke, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen ;
and of these all but Inver­ nizzi indemnify Cinesias by giving him all or part of the following speech, contrary to the MSS.
and, in my opinion, contrary to all probability.
In both speeches I have followed the arrange­ ment of the Ravenna MS.972.
ὠΖεῦ, Ζεῦ, Tyrwhitt, Brunch, and all subsequent editors, except those who divide the speech between the Chorus and Cinesias.
The MSS.
have ὦ Ζεῦ, ὦ Zεῦ, and so all editions before Brunck.975.
ξυγγογγυλίσας MSS. vulgo.
ξυγγογγύλας Cobet, Meineke, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.982.
ΠΡΟΒΟΥΛΟΣ.
MSS. vulgo.
And this is undoubtedly right, for that the speaker is a man of the highest authority is shown by his statement that " he will tell the Council to elect plenipotentiaries."
Unfortunately Bentley suggested not on this line but on some of the subsequent speeches that the speaker is Cinesias, a manifest impossibility, for Cinesias could not have dictated to the Council the course they were to pursue ;
nor was he in a position to rally the Herald on his distressful condition.
This has been realized by every editor except Van Leeuwen, who throughout the dialogue gives the speeches of the Probulus to Cinesias.— σὺ δὲ τίς;

But no doubt they commence with the next line.

πόλλ' ἔσω yap Κέν' ἔχομεν.
See the Commentary.
The MSS.
have ὡς πόλλ' ἔσω 'στὶν (or ἐσῶστιν) κἄχομεν.
And so (or with ἐσῶστιν for ἔσω 'στὶν) all editions before Brunck ;
and Invernizzi, Bekker, and Hall and Geldart afterwards.
Brunck read ὡς ἔσω πόλλ' ἐστὶν κἄχομεν.
Hermann suggested the omission of ὡς from the MS.
reading, and this is adopted by Bothe, Dindorf in his text, and Weise.
But in his notes Dindorf approved of Reisig's conjecture πολλὰ σᾶ 'στὶ κἄχομεν, while Person suggested πολλὰ σᾶ 'στὶν ἅχομεν.
But Burges's proposal ὡς πλέα 'στὶν ἅχομεν has met with the largest support;
that (or ὡςπλἔ ἐστὶν, or is πλέω'στὶν) having been adopted by Enger and all subsequent editors except Bothe and Hall and Geldart.

κἄστιν ἔτνος MSS.
vulgo.
Bentley proposed κἄστιμὲν ἔτνος, but ἔτ' could more easily have dropped out before ἔτνος.
Blaydes says "
Displicent et Bentleii et Reisigii correctiones vel ideo quod corripi debet prior syllaba in ἔτνος," an incomprehensible remark, since in both their corrections the first syllable is short.
Blaydes himself reads κἄστιν ἔτνοςμοι, so substituting a choriamb for a paeon ;
whilst Van Leeuwen's καὶ earl μοι ἔτνος TI gives two cretics in a line which requires a paean and a cretic.
For in these four stanzas, as in Knights 303-11, 382-8, and many other instances, paeons and cretics are not interchangeable ;
a paean in the strophe must be met by a paeon in the anti­ strophe, and a cretic by a cretic.
In all the four stanzas the six cretico-paeonic lines are cast in the same mould ;
the first, second, and fourth containing a paean and a eretic;
the third (with a monosyllabic base) two paeons;
and the fifth and sixth two cretics.
In the following line Elmsley proposed to change the δελφάκιον ἦν of the MSS.

ἔσωβαδίζειν R. H. all editions before Dindorf. εἴσω βαδίζειν P1. P2. F1. Elmsley, Dindorf, recentiores.1070.
ὡςἡ θύρα.
The reading of R. H. and of all editions before Bothe was ἴσως S' ἡ θύρα, but Elmsley conjectured ὡς ἡθύρα.
And this was subsequently found to be the reading of P1. P2. which, strange to say, Brunck had not adopted or even noticed.
It is followed by Bothe, Dindorf, and all subsequent editors.1076.
τί δεῖ P1. P2. F1. Florent Clue­ tien, Bentley, Brunck, recentiores, except as hereafter mentioned.
τί δὴ R. H. editions before Brunck.
Bergler however suggested either τί δεῖ or τί δῆ (supposed to be Doric for δεῖ).
And τί δῆ was again suggested by Dobree, and again by Bergk, but is adopted only by Meineke and Blaydes.1080.
τί κα λέγοι.
This was proposed by Enger, and is read by Meineke, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.
τί κἄν λέγοι R. H. vulgo.
τί καὶ λέγοι P1. P2. F1.—ὁπᾷ R. all editions before Brunck;
and Bekker, Bergk, Meineke, and Hall and Geldart after­ wards.

τὸ ἔσθος MSS.
vulgo.
Bentley proposed τόδ' ἔσθος and Reisig τό γ'ἔσθ
ος which Bothe adopts.
But commentators in general consider this and the other hiatuses in the Doric speeches of this Play to be occasioned by the suppressed digamma.—ὐμβαλώμεθα, a suggestion of Brunck, is read by Dindorf, Weise, Enger, Holden, Bergk, and subsequent editors.
ἐμβαλώμεθα or ἐμβαλώμεθα MSS. vulgo.
With the following line 1. ceases altogether.
1. P1. P2. and F1. also cease, but recommence with line 1237.1099. αἴΚ' εἶδον Brunck, recentiores, except as hereinafter appears, atκἴδον R. H. editions before Portus.
αἴκεν ἴδον Portus and subsequent editors before Brunck.

—τὤνδρες Elmsley (at Ach. 755), Dindorf, Bothe, Enger, recentiores.
ἂνδρες R. H. vulgo.
R. H. read ἁμὲς' and so all the earlier editions, but Enger's correction ἁμὲ has been followed by all subsequent editors.1105.
κἂν λῆτε, τὸν Λυσίστρατον R. (as corrected), and, save as herein appears, all printed editions.
But R.'s original reading was καλεῖτε, and that is also the reading of H. Hirschig therefore pro­ posed to read καλῆτε τὰν Λυσισράταν, and this is done by Bergk, Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes.
But both MSS.
have TOV Λυσίστρατον,with which κἂν λῆτε is indis­ pensable.
And it seems to me that Hir­ schig's line is infinitely less vigorous and graphic than the common reading.1109. [χαλεπὴν].
In R. and H. and all editions (except Bothe) before Dindorf the line is given with a foot wanting.
Apparently the first to ob­ serve the omission was Bentley, who asked An legendum δεινὴν, δεινὴν, ἀγαθήν?”
The same suggestion is said to have been made by Tyrwhitt, and it is adopted by Bothe, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
Meineke inserts ἀφελῆ after φαύλην, and Van Leeuwen, after his manner, instead of amending the line, composes a new one which commences ἐν τοȋσι λόγοις κομψὴν and omits both ἀγαθὴν and φαύλην.
But Dindorf and the other subsequent editors content themselves with marking a lacuna in the line.
I have inserted χαλεπὴν before ἀγανὴν because it seems to me that the missing word should give the idea of severity in a Judge, as contrasted with the idea of gentleness involved in the epithet ἀγανήν.
And χαλεπὸς bears that precise meaning in Wasps 942.1113.
μὴ 'κπειρωμένους R. H. Dindorf, Bothe, Enger, recentiores.
μὴ πειρωμένους Zanetti, Farreus, Portus, and all subse­ quent editors before Dindorf;
and Weise afterwards.
But I think the com­ pound verb is essential.
μὴ ἠπειρωμένους Junta, Cratander, Grynaeus, Gelenius, and Rapheleng.1123. ἐνθένδε θ' H. Portus and all subsequent editors before Meineke.
ἐνθένδε τ' (which of course means the same thing) R. and all editions before Portus.
Bergk is thought to have suggested ἐνθένδε δ', which is adopted by Meineke and subsequent editors, but seems inferior to the MS.
reading.1132. ἄλλους R. H. vulgo.
This being obviously the right word, it is amazing that Meineke should in his note have proposed ἄθλους, and in his V. A. ἀγόρους.1133.
στρατεύματι R. H. all editions before Brunck;
and Bergk, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen afterwards ;
and Meineke in his notes reverts to the MS.

ἑταίρους 'Ιππίου. R. H. have ἑτέρ
ους ἱππίους, and so all editions down to and including Portus.
Scaliger in his notes proposed ἑταίρους 'Ιππίου, but the edition which bears his name reads ἑταίρους 'Ιππίᾳ.
This is how Suidas, s. v. κατωνάκη, gives the line (at least in Gaisford's edition, though the MSS.
vary between ἱππία, ἱππίαν, and ἱππείαν) and so Faber.
Then Kuster changed 'Ιππίᾳ into 'Ιππίου, and so all subsequent editors.
1162.
λῶμες Bentley, Brunck, recen­ tiores. λώμεσθ' R. H. editions before Brunck.
And in the next line R. H. all the editions before Brunck and Bergk afterwards have ἀποδῶμεν.
Brunck altered this into the infinitive ἀποδόμεν, and is followed by every subsequent editor except Bergk.1164.
ἇσπερ Bergler (in notes).
ἇσπερ or τᾶσπερ Elmsley (at Ach. 441).
ἇσπερ is read by Bothe, Dindorf, and all subse­ quent editors, except Blaydes and Van Leeuwen who have τᾶσπερ.
ω̃σπερ R. H. and all editions, except Bothe's, before Dindorf.1171.
ὦ λυσσἁνιε.
R. H. all editions be­ fore Brunck ;
and Bekker and Bergk afterwards.
And that the Scholiast so read is plain from his explanation ὦ μαινόμενε.
But Voss pointed out that Hesychius has λισσάνιος. ἀγαθὸς, Λάκωνες.
And Bentley added that Photius has λισσάνιε.
ἀγαθὲ ῆ φίλε, Λάκωνες.
And ὦ λισσάνιε is introduced into the text by Brunck and all subsequent editors save as aforesaid, and save that Dindorf has λυσσάνιε in his text, though in his notes he prefers λισσάνιε.
Of course if Hesychius and Photius are referring to the present line, which is uncertain, they must have had λισσάνιε in their copies ;
but even so the evidence in favour of λυσσάνιε preponderates.
And it seems to me more probable that the Laconian, vexed at the grasping character of the Athenian's demand which he considers to include " every­ thing," should have addressed him as ὦ μαινόμενε than as ὦ ὐγαθέ.1174.
ya πρῲ Bisetus, Scaliger, and all subsequent editions before Brunck ;
and Dindorf, Weise, and Meineke afterwards.
γᾷ πρῶτα R. H. editions before Scaliger. ya 7rpara (with ναὶ σιὼ) Brunck, Invernizzi, Bothe ;
and (with ναὶ τὼ σιὼ) Bekker and Hall and Geldart.
ya λῶ Reisig, Enger, Holden, Blaydes. ya πρόκα Bergk.
Elmsley suggested ya ποτὶ (for ye πρὸς), which Van Leeuwen reads.
To Enger πρῲ appeared a " satis inepta scriptura," but he had not considered the under current which runs through these speeches.
The meaning resembles that of τοὺς ὄρθρους supra 966.1188.
ὡς τάχιστά γε R. H. vulgo. ὡς τάχιστ' ἄγε Beer, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.
But the alteration seems to impart heaviness to a line which ought to be as light as possible.
1190.
ἐστί μοι
Elmsley, Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores.
ἔστιν ἐμοὶ R. H. editions (save as aforesaid) before Dindorf. ἐστ' ἐμοὶ Bentley.
Elmsley's restorations of the Ode will be found in the first volume of the Museum Criticum.1200.
χἄττ' ἂν ἔνδον Elmsley, Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores. χ'ἅττ' ἔνδον R. x' ἅτ' ἔνδον H. the other editions before Dindorf. κᾆθ' ἅτ' ἔνδον Bentley.1207. ὁ δ' ἄρτος R. H. vulgo.
Hermann proposed to read τὸν δ' ἄρτον ... νεανίαν.
Apparently he took πυρίδια λεπτὰ to be accusatives after λαβεῖν, but they are really nominatives to be construed with ἔστι.
Van Leeuwen reads o δ' οὖν ἄρτος "metri causa " he says.
But the inser­ tion of οὖν seems destructive of the metre.1216.
παραχωρεῖν οὐ θέλεις Scaliger (in notes), Bentley, Dindorf, Meineke, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.
οὐ παραχωρεῖν θέλεις R. H. vulgo.
Bentley suggested both the reading in the text, and, as an alternative, σύ. παραχωρεῖν θέλεις, and the latter is adopted by Bothe, Enger, Bergk, and Blaydes ;
while Van Leeuwen reads σύ.
παραχωρεῖν ἔδει.1218. φορτικὸν τὸ χωρίον R. H. vulgo.
Blaydes (amongst many other alterna­ tives) suggested φορτικοὶ τοιχωρύχοι and φορτικὸν τὸ χρῆμ' ἄγαν.
He introduces the former into the text, but says in his notes that he prefers the latter which (with the change of χρῆμ' into πρᾶγμ') is brought into the text by Van Leeuwen.
1220.
χαρίσασθαι προσταλαιπωρήσομεν Bentley, Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
And so Enger, except that he changes the final syllable into -μαι. R. and H. read χαρίζεσθαι προσ­ ταλαιπωρήσαιμεν, and so all editions before Scaliger, who changed -σαιμεν into -σομεν, in which he is followed by Faber and Kuster.
Brunck got over the metri­ cal difficulty by reading ταλμιπωρήσομεν, which is followed by all subsequent editors down to and including Dindorf, and by Bergk.
Blaydes suggested προσ­ ταλαιπωρητέον whIch Van Leeuwenadopts.1236.
el μέν ye τις R. H. vulgo.
ἐί τις μέλος Blaydes.
With the following line I. P1. P2. and F1. recommence.1242.
Πουλυχαρίδα P1. P2. F1.
The readings here are precisely the same as in 1098 supra, to which the reader is referred.1244.
κἠς ἡμᾶς Brunck and all sub­ sequent editors before Meineke, except that Bothe in his second edition writes ἅμμες y' for ἡμᾶς.
Kat ἡμᾶς R. H. editions before Brunck. καὶ ἐς ἡμᾶς P1. P2. F1. Hall and Geldart.
κἀς ἡμᾶς Bentley.
Bergk, while retaining the reading in my text, unfortunately suggested κἠς .ἅμ'(i.e. ἁμὲ) ᾆσμ', a suggestion which nobody has adopted, but which opened the floodgates of conjecture.
Meineke reads χἄμ' which is as different as possible from the MS.
reading, but is followed by Holden and Van Leeuwen, whilst Blaydes reads χἄμ' αὐτὼς, and in his notes proposes to close the line with a wholly unauthorized μέλος as he had already done in lines 1236 and 1243.1246.
ὑμᾶς ὁρῶν Bentley, Brunck, re­ centiores.
ὁρῶν ὑμᾶς R. H. editions before Brunck, except that several of the older editions—Zanetti, Farreus, Gelenius, and Rapheleng—have ἡμᾶς for ὑμᾶς.
ὁρῶν is omitted by P1. P2. F1.1247.
ὅρμαον K.T.X.
This song is rightly attributed to Λάκων (who had promised, four lines above, to sing it) by R. and apparently all the other MSS., except P1. (who assigns it to Λαμπιτὼ), and by all editors before Brunck, and Enger and Van Leeuwen afterwards.
Brunck changed Λάκων to Πρέσβυς, as indeed he had done with the preceding speeches of Λάκων.
This was a change for the worse, for there were Athenian as well as Laconian πρέσβεις on the stage.
It was however followed by subsequent edi­ tors before Dindorf who, without a word, changed it to Xopos Δακώνων.
There was, and could be, no such chorus;
see the Commentary on 1243.
Dindorf's error was, however, followed by all subse­ quent editors, except as aforesaid.1248.
τὼς κυρσανίως MSS.
vulgo.
The Scholia here are very conflicting, and while most of them recognize the ac­ cusative plural, one of them gives the sentence in Attic Greek as ὅρμησ
ον, ὦ Μνημοσύνη, τῷ ἐφήβῳ τὴν σὴν μοῦσαν.
Ber­ gler therefore thought that we should perhaps read τῷ κυρσανίω, meaning " to the piper," and so Van Leeuwen reads.
Meineke reads τοῖς κυρσανίοις, and is fol­ lowed by Holden, and by Blaydes in his text, though in his note he approved of Bergler's proposal.—ὦ
Μναμνα R. H. vulgo. ὦ Μναμοσύνα 1. P1. P2. F1. Kuster, Bergler, Brunck, and Weise. ὦ Μναμοὔνα Enger, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.1249.
τὰν τεὰν R. H. vulgo. τὰν Τἐμὰν P1. P2. F1. Brunck, Bothe, Dindorf (in notes), Bergk, and Hall and Geldart.
τὰν ἐμάν re Enger.1250.
οἶδεν MSS. vulgo.
ἇδεν was conjectured by Florent Chretien, and εἶδεν by Meineke.
There is some sense in Florent Chretien's conjecture, but Meineke should have remembered that the province of Memory is not to see the present but to know the past.1252.
θείκελοι MSS.
Scholiast, vulgo.
θευσείκελοι Enger. σιοείκελοι Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
σιείκελοι Van Leeuwen.
In this song, as everywhere else, Commentators vie with each other in transforming the lightly - flavoured language of Aristophanes into the strictest Doric, and so rendering it less easily comprehensible by an Athe­ nian audience.
It does not seem de­ sirable, as a rule, to mention these ill-judged attempts.
1259.
ἀφρὸς ἵετο MSS. vulgo.
The repetition of ἀφρὸς seems to me very pleasant and poetical;
but it has not found favour with all editors, and some have omitted, and others bracketed, the word in this line.
Bergk proposed to read ἱδρὼς and Meineke λύθρ
ος in its place.1261.
ray ψάμμας (variously accented) MSS.
vulgo.
τᾶς ψάμμω Elmsley,Blaydes.
But ψάμμη is found in Herodotus, and may have been the form in use with the Dorians.
1262.
Άγρότερ' "Αρτεμι σηροκτόνε MSS. vulgo.
But several recent editors read "Αρταμι and some omit" Αρτεμι altogether.
For εὔπορος (MSS.
vulgo) a little below Blaydes reads ἔμπεδος. εὔπορος seems to mean abundant.1274.
τάσδε τε R. H. vulgo ;
though some have τὰς δέ re. τασδεί P1. P2. F1. τασδεδί Dindorf, Bergk, Meineke,Holden, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.1279.
πρόσαγε.
The Ravenna MS.
gives no sign of a new speaker here, nor do any of the earlier editions;
but the lines are obviously sung by the regular chorus of the Play, and the later editors prefix Xo. or (unnecessarily) Xo. Αθ.
And so it is said do P1. and P2.
As regards the metre, to say, as the Commentators do, that the first line is iambic, the second trochaic, and so on, seems to me to be idle talk.
It is really a series of trisyllabic feet, dactyls and tribrachs, indiscriminately strung together;
as in the great word of many lines at the close of the Ecclesiazusae, and should perhaps be looked upon rather as dance- music than as a regular poem.
I have inserted δὴ between πρόσαγε and χορόν.
It is not found in the MSS.
and edi­ tions.—ἔπαγε Χάριτας MSS.
vulgo.
ἔπαγε δὲ χάριτας Enger, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.
ἐπάγαγε χάριτας Meineke. ἔπαγέ τε χάριτας Bergk, Holden.1281.
ἀγέχορον (or ἁγ.) Gelenius, Bergler (in notes), Brunck, recentiores, except as hereinafter mentioned, ἄγε χορὸν R. H. editions (except Gelenius) before Brunck.
ἄγετε χορὸν P1. P2. F1. ἀγεσίχορον Bergk, Holden.
The word is omitted by Enger, and bracketed by Blaydes, and seems to be a mere echo of the πρόσ—αγε χορὸν two lines above.
It encumbers the metre and has no business here.
I have transposed ἰήιον and εὔφρον', as indeed Van Leeuwen had done before.
1283.
Βάκχιος Burges, Dindorf, Weise, Bergk, Holden, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.
Βάκχειος R. H. editions before Dindorf. βακχείοις P1. P2. βακ­ χίοις Fl. Bergk in the Rhenish Museum proposed to read βακχιοι̂, changing ὄμμασι into εὐάσι and omitting δαίεται ;
and this is done by Enger, and by Holden in his first edition, but Bergk did not repeat his proposal in his own edition, and Holden in his second re­ turned to the ordinary reading.
Meineke for Βάκχιος ὄμμασι reads βακχίσιν οἰνάσι, and Blaydes, omitting Βάκχιος, changes ὄμμασι into λαμπάδι.1289.
μεγαλόΦρονος MSS.
vulgo ;
an epithet exactly suited to the arrange­ ment, which was not merely Peace, but Peace with Honour.
In Birds 1321 the Birds speak of ἀγανόΦρονος ‛Ησυχίας, an epithet exactly suited to the Bird-song, but which would be simply unmeaning here.
Yet Reisig, I know not why, suggested that μεγαλόΦρονος should be ousted from the present passage, and ἀγανόΦρονος enthroned in its place, and this proposal is approved by Dindorf in his notes, and adopted by Enger, Holden, Meineke, and all subsequent editors.
1295.
ΛΑΚΩΝ.
πρόΦαινε κ.τ.λ.
In the MSS., and generally in the editions, this line runs as follows, as if the whole were part of a speech ;
and as there is no sign prefixed to in­ dicate a new speaker, the words were supposed to be a continuation of the preceding lines, and to be spoken by the Coryphaeus to the Laconian who had sung the former solo.
ἐπὶ via is ex­ plained by the Scholiast to mean ἐπὶ τεώτερα πράγματα.
But Bergler saw that we should read ἐπὶ νέᾳ (se. μούσῃ), and his correction is adopted by Brunck and all subsequent editors except Inver­ nizzi.'
Bothe wrote it in one line, and so Bergk, Meineke, and Hall and Gel­ dart, Bergk bracketing, and Hall and Geldart omitting the word Λάκων.
Bergk also ascribed the line to Lysis­ trata, and in this he is followed by all subsequent editors except Van Leeuwen, who ascribes the line to the First Athenian and converts it into a rhym­ ing couplet, He could not have made this charming little rhyme out of Blaydes's text, for the latter, without the slightest provo­ cation, changes δὴ into καὶ.
Holden reads AY. ἄγ’ ὦ Λάκων I πρόΦαινε κ.τ.λ.1297.
Ταΰγετον κ.τ.λ.
The omission of the prefix to line 1295 necessitated the invention of some prefix for the present line;
and somebody prefixed So. Αακ.
which is found in all the MSS.
and editions except Van Leeuwen who has ΛΑΚΩΝ, which would be quite right if any prefix were required.
1298.
Μω̑α μόλε MSS. vulgo.
The last words of the line, Λάκαινα πρεπ­ τὸν ἁμὶν, tally with the last words of the preceding line, ἐραννὸν ἐκλιπω̑α, and ef­ forts have been made to bring the commencements into equal correspon­ dence.
Hermann proposed Μω̑α, μόλε, μόλε,a rather ludicrous suggestion which Dindorf approved and Van Leeuwen adopts.
Reisig, with greater proba­ bility, ὦ Μω̑α μόλε, which Enger adopts.
Burges, Μω̑α μόλ’ ἰὼ.
The metre is too uncertain to justify any correction;
otherwise I should have proposed the omission of aὔτ’ in the preceding line.
For πρεπτὸν (MSS. vulgo)
Maittaire sug­ gested πρα̑τον.1299.
τὸν ’Αμύκλαις ’Απόλλω σιὸν MSS.
vulgo.
TOP ’μύκλαισι σιὸν ’Απόλλω Hermann.
But Valckenaer's suggestion that ’Απόλλω should be omitted, as a mere explanatory gloss on τὸν ’Αμύκλαις σιὸν which had somehow crept into the text, seems clearly right;
and the word has accordingly been omitted or brack­ eted by Brunck and every subsequent editor except Invernizzi and Bothe.1300.
’Ασάναν MSS. vulgo.
The Scho­ liast says διχω̑ς ἄνασσαν ’Αθήνην.
This is interpreted to mean that there was another reading ἄνασσαν, which was a common epithet of Athene;
see Eume­ nides 226, 278, 421, 852.
And ἄνασσαν is read by Enger, Meineke, Holden, and Van Leeuwen.1304.
ὤια (or ωΐα or ωία) R. H. editions before Kuster;
and Invernizzi, Bothe, Bekker, and (in his text) Dindorf after­ wards.
ὦ εἶα (or ὢ εἶα) P1. P2. F1. Kuster, recentiores, except as aforesaid, and so Dindorf in his notes.
It is strange that Blaydes, who had collated R., should say“ω ειά (sic) R.,"for nothing can be more plain than R.'s ωΐα.1313.
παιδδωα̂ν.
This was first sug­ gested by Kuster, and was afterwards found in P1. P2. F1.
It is adopted by Brunck, Bothe, Bekker, Weise, Hall and Geldart, and Van Leeuwen.
παδδοα̂ν R. H. editions before Portus.
παδδω̑αν Portus and subsequent editions before Brunck.
Reisig proposed παιδδοα̑ν which Dindorf read in his text, but in his note preferred παδοα̂ν.
παδωα̂ν Enger, Hol­ den, Bergk, Meineke, Blaydes.1314.
Λήδας MSS. vulgo.
Λατου̑ς (or Λατω̂ς), suggested by Bisetus and Bergler, is read by Bothe and Blaydes.1316.
ἀλλ’ ἄγε.
Here we get a more settled metre, the following six lines being alternately iambic and trochaic.
Each couplet combined into one line forms an iambic tetrameter catalectic ;
and several recent editors so combine them.
But such a combination, besides being against the evidence of all the MSS., forms a very unnatural conclusion to a song of this kind.
IN the legends of Demeter and Persephone, their divine personalities are never wholly disentangled from the natural objects and the natural processes upon which those legends were based.
Demeter is always1 γη̂ μήτηρ (Aa μάτηρ in the Doric) the fair visible Earth, the mother of the golden grain.
Every autumn, at seed-time, she beholds her offspring sinking into the unseen world;
every winter she languishes and mourns;
every spring, as the blades of corn reappear, she welcomes back her child to the realms of life and light.
In the sorrow of the Goddess, "her of the rich fruit and golden sickle " (Δήμητρος, χρυσαόρου ἀγλαοκάρπου), for the loss of her divinely beautiful daughter (περικαλλὴς ΠερσεΦόνεια), none could fail to recognize the gloom which overspreads the Earth, when the grain has descended for a while into the unseen world (’'ᾼδης), thence2 to arise in a joyful resurrection, when all the land is fragrant with the pleasant flowers of Spring.
It absent, Earth mourns, and' withholds her life-sustaining gifts.
To the quick and lively sympathies of the Hellene, the legend of this divine sorrow was shrouded with a solemn and ineffable awe, in consequence of its connection with that unseen world:
and no mysteries were so high and sacred as the two great solemnities in which it was commemorated.
In the Eleusinia were unfolded the Mysteries of the Four Last Things—Death, Judgement, the Reward of the Good, and the Punishment of the Wicked-mysteries which were naturally open to the queen of the unseen world below.
In the Thesmophoria2 the Mother and Daughter were worshipped under quite a different aspect, as the Civilizers of the visible world above.
Earth, with her corn and wine and oil, was to the Hellenic mind emphatically a civilizer of men.
Her attractions drew them from the nomad state of wandering hunters;
they became under her influence settled and agricultural peoples;
she taught them the joys of HOME.
To her and her life-sustaining (Φερέσβιος) produce was ascribed the institution of social laws (θεσμὰ), the rights of property, the laws of wedlock and the family.
They were the ΘεσμοΦόροι3, the Givers and Guardians of Home.
Let us not tell, says Callimachus (Hymn to Demeter, 18), of the things which drew tears from Dcmeter:
Rather tell how she to Cities Gave their social customs sweet, Taught the hind to reap and garner Ripened sheaves of wholesome wheat, And the golden grain to sever, Sever with the oxen's feet.
And it was in this character that the high festival of the Thesmophoria was held in their honour, held at the fall of the year, when the Daughter once more descended into the lower world, to return four months later in all the freshness of immortal youth to greet the Mother again.
In the celebration of these solemn mysteries women alone took part.
Men must not' know, or if they knew, must not speak of, the things which took place in these holy solemnities.
Herodotus2 says that he knows them, but dares not tell.
And Miltiades3, leaping over the fence of the Thesmophorium at Pares, was seized with religious dread, and not merely feared to venture further, but sprang back with such precipita­ tion that he sustained the injury which resulted in his death.
The Athenians celebrated the Thesmophoria 4 on four consecutive days towards the end of October;
from the lOth to the 13th (inclusive) of the month Pyanepsion.
Each of the four days had its special service and its distinctive appellation :
(Note that the day is ἡ ΘεσμοΦορία, the feast τὰ ΘεσμοΦόρια.
And again, the day is ἡ Καλλιγένεια, the sacrifice To Καλλιγένεια.)
On this, the first day of the festival, the women went up to the Temple (τὸ ΘεσμοΦόρια), which was situated on an 1 eminence, and there made the necessary preparations for the great ceremonial of the next three days.
From this " going up " to the Temple, the day was some­ times called the ’'Ανοδος.
Each of these appellations ΘεσμοΦορία and ’'Ανοδ
ος has been the source of considerable misapprehension.
The Scholiast on Theocritus iv.
25 is so totally ignorant of the very meaning of the word Thesmophoria, viz.
the institution by Demeter of the unwritten laws of society, that he supposes it to mean the carrying of written law-books by the Athenian women ;
a mere blunder, but one which has misled many.
And the ’'Ανοδος. the Ascent of the Women to the Thesmophorium, which took place on the first day of the festival, is, by a converse process, perpetually confounded with the Κάθοδος, the Descent of Persephone into the invisible world, which was commemorated on the second day of the festival.
Of this latter aberration we have seen two instances in the preceding note, Hesychius placing the ’'Ανοδος on the 11th of Pyanepsion, which is the day of the Κάθοδος;
whilst the Aristophanic Scholiast, though rightly observing that the first day of the festival was called the ’'Ανοδος, the Ascent of the Women, is not afraid to add, in so many words, that some called it Κάθοδος, that is, the Descent of Persephone.
To the Scholiast on Theocritus, ubi supra, we owe another egregious mistake, though here too he is not without companions in his error.
For he supposes that the Temple to which the women "went up" on the first day of the festival was not the Thesmophorium at Athens, but the Temple of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis.
In other words, he confounds the Thesmophoria with the Eleusinia.
The Athenian Thesmo­ phoria were celebrated entirely at Athens.
The various Hellenic cities which kept the festival kept it at their own doors.
The story told by Aen. Tact. (Poliorc.
4) about the plot of the Megarians to seize the Athenian women who were keeping the Thesmophoria at Eleusis, and the successful counterplot of Peisistratus, refers to the local Eleusinian, and not to the Athenian, Thesmophoria.
We have already alluded to the Parian Thesmophorium, and many others are mentioned by various writers.
At Thebes the Thesmophoria were celebrated in the citadel (Xenophon, Hellenics, V. ii. 29).
Pausanias (Attica, xxxi.
1) speaks of a Thesmophorium at the little sea-side village of Halimus (not far from Peiraeus), where doubtless the Halimusians held their own little Thesmophoria.
And he elsewhere (Phocica, xxxiii, ad fin.) mentions a Thesmophorium at Drymaea in Phocis, where, he observes, the Thesmophoria were celebrated every year.
He gives no description of the Athenian Temple, but that it was of considerable size may be inferred from the fact that it contained συσσίτια, or common mess­ rooms, where the women lived while the festival was going on.
τρία 'Αθήνησισυσσίτια, says Hesychius (s. v. πρυτανει̑ν, and as one of the three he names the Thesmophorium.
It seems probable that the confusion of the "Ανοδοςwith the Κάθοδος is also made by Alciphron (Epistle iii. 39), but he keeps clear of the mistake about Eleusis.
The epistle in question is supposed to be written by a country lad at Athens to his mother at home, and may, with perhaps sufficient accuracy for our present purpose, be translated as follows ;
­"
In the name of all the Gods and Demons, mother.
leave for a while your rocks and country life, and see before you die the splendid sights to be seen at Athens.
For what wonderful things, 0 what wonderful things, are you missing, the Haloa, the Apaturia, the Dionysia, and the most holy1 festival of the Thesmophoria which is now proceeding.
For on the first day the "Ανοδος took place;
and to-day the Νηστεία is being celebrated amongst the Athenians ;
and to-morrow they sacrifice τὰ Καλλι­ γένεια.
If then you make great haste and arrive here before daybreak, you can join with the Athenian ladies in to-morrow's sacrifice.
Do pray come, and don't delay, I adjure you by the safety of my brothers and myself.
Heaven forbid that you should depart this life without having tasted the pleasures of the city.
"That on this day the Descent of Persephone into Hades was com­ memorated is certain;
but of the manner in which, and the ritual wherewith, it was commemorated, no information has come down to us. " Women," says Praxagora in the Ecelesiazusae (442), " never blab out their Thesmophorian secrets," a statement which, strange as it may seem, appears unfortunately to have been strictly true.
But we may conjecture that the day commenced with dance and song, as of Persephone going forth with her maidens into the soft and fragrant meadow, to 2 gather the roses, the violets, the hyacinths and the crocuses, and the wondrous daffodil.
And perchance if the great Dance-song of the present Play be really (as seems probable) imitated from the actual proceedings in the Thesmophoria, it was sung not on the Day of Mourning, to which it is here of course adapted, but on the morning of the Κάθοδος, before the shadow of her approaching doom had chilled the gaiety of Persephone.
She stepped upon Sicilian grass, Demeter's daughter fresh and fair, A child of light, a radiant lass, And gamesome as the morning air.
The daffodils were fair to see, They nodded lightly on the let.
Persephone!
Persephone!—(JEAN INGELOW.
)
But the day which commenced so joyously ended in sorrow and gloom.
The attendant maidens had lost their Queen of May.
The earth had opened, and she had disappeared to become the Queen of Hades.
It may be that the propitiatory sacrifice called the Zημία 1 was offered on the evening of this day.
This was the day of Bereavement, typifying the winter of Demeter's discontent, when her divinely beautiful Daughter had disappeared from her sight, and gone site knew not whither.
It was, to use the words of Plutarch, the gloomiest day of the Thesmophoria, and the women spent it, sitting on the ground with fasting and mourning, in sympathy with the sorrowing mother.
It was more than sympathy, it was here.
as apparently throughout the festival, a representation of the sacred legend.
Because the Goddess, with flaming torches 3 in her hands, sought after her vanished daughter, therefore on this day the air was aglow with the smoke and the glare of the torches.
Because the Goddess during her bereavement would 1 neither eat nor drink, therefore her worshippers must this day abstain from all manner of food.
The severity of their fast became almost proverbial. " What," says a speaker in Athenaeus, vii. 80, "are we keeping the Νηστεία, the Μέση, of the Thesmophoria, that we are fasting like κεστει̑ς2 ? "
In the Birds, the Gods, being strictly blockaded, are reduced to the direst extremities, and Prometheus describes them as fasting like the women in the Thesmophoria.
This day of Fasting represented the period, the τριάτην μοι̑ραν ἓτεος, during which Persephone was absent in the unseen world ;
and from its interposition between the Κάθοδος or Descent into Hades, and the Καλλι­ γένια, the fair new birth of the Resurrection morning, it acquired the name of the Μέση, the Intermediate Day.
We might almost call it the Athenian Easter Eve, for few can fail to recognize in the process which this great festival represented Nature's unconscious symbolism of the Death and Resurrection of the Eternal Son.
Or if this be too bold a comparison, we may at all events remember that from the time of St. Paul the sowing and springing up of the corn has always been the favourite symbol of a Christian's Death and Resurrection.
Death, says Prudentius in his Graveside Hymn (Cathe­ merinon, x. 120), is but a reparatio vitae :
Sic semina sicca virescuut, Iam mortua, iamque sepulta, Quae reddita cespite ab imo Veteres meditantur aristas.
And indeed the same idea is embalmed in the familiar name " God's Acre " given to the burial-places of our dead.
Nor was the solemnity of the Νηστεία confined to the women fasting in the Temple precincts.
All business was suspended, all offices closed for the day.
After seed-time, winter;
after winter, the up-springing of the corn.
Persephone is returning to the light of day.
The season of sorrow and fasting is over;
it is time to sacrifice τὰ Καλλιμένεια, to rejoice and be glad in the fair new birth.
The name Καλλιγένεια attached itself both to Demeter and to Persephone, the divinely1 beautiful Mother and the divinely beautiful Daughter;
although it afterwards, by the common process of disintegration, became severed from the Goddesses, and personified as one of the handmaidens.
Possibly the invocation in lines 1148-1159 of this Play is taken from the hymn sung at the sacrifice of the Καλλιγένεια, since Persephone, who was absent during the Νηστεία, is supposed in these lines to be present as well as her Mother.
Such was the cycle of events commemorated, and in part represented, at the Thesmophorian festival.
And we shall now, I think, find no difficulty in solving the problem propounded by Hesyehius (s. v. τρίτη Θεσμοφορίων);
ζητει̑ται πω̑ς ἄμα μὲνλέγει, τρίτην Θεσμοφορίων εἶναι, ἃμα δὲ Μέσην, τεττάρων ούσω̑ν ήμερω̑ν2.
For we have seen that Μέση means, not the middle day of the festival in the sense of having an equal number of days before and after it;
but the Intermediate Day, the Day between the Κάθοδος, the Descent into Hades, and the Καλλιγένεια, the fair new birth of Persephone.
The earlier scholars had a short and easy way of dealing with the difficulty "
Aristophanes says that the Νηστεία is the third and also the middle day of the Festival.
Therefore the Festival lasted five days."
Such was the view of Meursius, Wesseling, and others, and it is repeated by Brunch with his usual clearness and confidence.
Yet nothing is more certain than that the festival lasted four days only.
And in truth so far is Aristophanes from implying that it was a five-days' festival, that he really implies the reverse.
For if it really lasted for five days, is it conceivable that, after stating that this was the Third Day, he should have thought it necessary to go through an arithmetical calculation, and announce that the Third was also the Middle Day of the Five ?
He added the description ή Μέσηa, because it conveyed an idea not involved in the statement that it was the Third Day :
because it was a name and not a statement of its position amongst the days of the Thesmophoria generally.
It is just as if he had said "
This is the third Day, the Νηστεία," or a This is the fourth Day, the Καλλιγένεια.
"Wellauer, by combining several errors, struck out a more ingenious solution.
We have already noticed the blunder of the Scholiast on Theocritus about the celebration of the festival at Eleusis.
Plutarch, in the passage to which reference has already been made (Dem. 30), says that Demosthenes committed suicide at Calauria on the 16th of Pyanepsion, the day on which the women keep the Νηστεία.
If this is not a mere oversight on the part of the author or his transcribers, Plutarch is doubtless referring to the date on which the Νηστείαwas kept at Calauria, or possibly in his own Chaeronaea.
Wellauer, though he did not himself confuse the "Ανοδος and the Κάθοδος, yet adopts the erroneous statement of Hesychius (based on that confusion) that the "Ανοδος took place on the 11th of Pyanepsion.
He next, misled by, and to some extent mistaking, the Scholiast on Theocritus, supposes that the women on that day " went up " to the Temple at Eleusis, returning to celebrate the rest of the Festival at Athens.
He then, misled by Plutarch, imagines that the Athenians celebrated the Νηστεία on the 16th, and consequently the Κάθοδος on the loth, and the Καλλιγένεια on the 17th.
There would thus be an interval of three entire days between the "Ανοδος and the Κάθοδος.
Having by these means persuaded himself that the festival, though in reality lasting four days, yet was celebrated in Athens itself for three days only, he proceeds to solve the problem which Hesychius places before us by adopting the idea, justly repudiated by Callimachus and the Scholiast on Thesm.
80, that when Aristophanes calls the Νηστεία the Third Day of the Festival, he is reckoning the "Ανοδος as the first day:
and that when in the same line he calls it the Μέση, he is omitting the "Ανοδος.
But in truth the women went up to the Temple on the lOth to make preparations for the great religious drama which was to be enacted there on the 11th, 12th, and 13th.
It is absolutely certain that the entire festival was celebrated at Athens on four consecutive days.
The whole difficulty has arisen from the assumption that Μέση means the middle day of the festival, instead of the Intermediate Day between the sorrow of the Κάθοδοςand the joy of the Καλλιγένεια.
The other solutions which have been offered have met with no acceptance, and it would be a mere waste of time to discuss them here.
It was on this Day of the Festival, the Intermediate Day, the Day of Pasting, " when women most have leisure 1," that the women had arranged to hold a great Assembly in the Thesmophorium, after the fashion of an Athenian έκκληία, to determine on the punishment to be inflicted on Euripides for his persistent hostility to the female sex.
It is true that many2 eminent scholars have of late years questioned the existence of this hostility, and pointed to the characters of Alcestis, Polyxena, and others, as evidence that Euripides was not incapable of appreciating, or unwilling to embody in his poetic creations, the highest and noblest types of womanhood.
And doubtless in a great dramatic poet, looking at life from every point of view, and speaking through the lips of every variety of character, it is impossible to find an absolute uniformity of sentiment upon any topic whatever.
Nevertheless, it remains the fact that Euripides, in marked contrast to the other members of the great Tragic triumvirate, was in the habit of exhibiting women a prey to the most ungovernable and most ignoble passions;
and that beyond any other writer of any period (and I am not unconscious of the undercurrent of antipathy towards women which had run through Hellenic poetry from the very earliest times) he loved to embalm in a pithy and proverbial form a sentiment of dislike and contempt for the female character generally.
To collect the various passages of this description which are found in his Plays would be wearisome to the reader, and distasteful to myself.
I will merely mention one circum­ stance to which attention has not, I think, been hitherto directed.
Stobaeus was in the habit of collecting, and arranging under various heads, the most striking and pointed passages of the ancient classical writers.
One of these collections (Anthology, Title 73) bears the ominous title of ψόγ
ος γυναικω̑ν, Passages in censure of women.
Stobaeus was a man of wide and various reading.
His Anthology (not to mention his other works) contains citations from about 350 authors ;
and yet, out of sixty-four passages collected under this particular heading, no fewer than thirty-five (if not thirty-six) are contributed by Euripides alone ;
Sophocles supplies two;
Aeschylus not one;
and most of t he remaining- twenty-seven (or twenty-six) are taken from professedly satirical or comic writers.
Whatever therefore may have been the poet's real attitude towards the women, they certainly had some excuse for considering him the inveterate traducer and enemy of their sex.
At the commencement of the Play, Euripides, In.
alarm at this formidable movement against him, is seen walking with a companion towards the house of the Tragic Poet Agathon.
The companion is one Mnesilochus, who, throughout the Play, is vaguely described as his κηδεστὴς, or connection by marriage.
In the Greek Life of Euripides (written by Manuel Moschopoulos, and first published by Elmsley in his edition of the Bacchae, A. D. 1821) it is stated that Choerile, the Poet's second wife, was the daughter of a Mnesilochus;
and that her three sons were named respectively, Mnesilochus (after his maternal grandfather), Mnesarchides (after his paternal grandfather), and a younger Euripides.
And it has, since that time, been generally assumed that the Mnesilochus of the Play was the father-in-law of Euripides.
But the relation of the two characters towards each other, and the tone of their conversation, are scarcely those of a father-in-law and son-in-law;
Euripides was at this time an old man of seventy, and it is hardly probable that his father- in-law was alive;
it seems extremely unlikely that Aristophanes, with such convenient words as πενθερὸςand γαμβρὸς ready to his hand, should so persistently have employed the indefinite word κηδεστὴς, κηδεστής τις, had he really intended to identify his character with the father-in-law of Euripides;
the name was doubtless a common one amongst the relatives of Choerile:
and in my opinion Aristophanes was either referring to a brother or cousin of Choerile;
or (more probably) merely borrowing a name from her family, without meaning to identify the character with any particular individual.
The object of their visit to Agathon was to induce that Poet, whose soft and effeminate appearance and manners might well be mistaken for a woman's, to attend the Thesmophorian assembly in woman's dress, and endeavour to create a diversion in favour of Euripides.
This Agathon politely, but firmly, declines to do, parrying the request of the elder bard by the help of various worldly-wise maxims drawn from the latter's own writings ;
and Euripides, as usual in these Comedies, τοι̑ς αύτου̑ πτεροι̑ς άλίσκεται.
The tone in which Agathon is satirized in these scenes makes us appreciate with more pleasure the kindly tribute which Aristophanes pays him in the Frogs;
whilst the manner in which Plato brings Socrates, Aristophanes, and Agathon together in his Symposium seems to show that the shafts of comic satire were not necessarily inconsistent with personal goodwill.
It is true that the Symposium is supposed to have taken place before the date of the Thesmophoriazusae, though after the date of the Clouds;
but Plato is doubtless intending to record the habitual relations which existed, or might reasonably be represented as existing, between these famous Athenians.
On Agathon's refusal, Mnesilochus offers himself as a substitute, and Agathon is generous enough to place his own wardrobe, well stocked with articles of feminine attire, at the disposal of the two friends.
And after a long and farcical scene (supposed to be borrowed in part from a Play of Cratinus), in which Mnesilochus is shaved and singed and dressed in womanly habiliments, he is at length despatched on his perilous mission.
His interposition in the women's debate does indeed give rise to so much uproar and hubbub, that the Assembly would in all probability have broken up in confusion, but for the sudden appearance of Cleisthenes, a man for more than twenty years the constant butt of the comic stage for his profligate and degrading effeminacy.
Cleisthenes comes, in his character of the women's advocate, to warn them that there is a traitor in their midst;
that Euripides has sent an old rogue, a connection of his own, κηδεστήν τινα, to spy upon and defeat their hostile machinations;
that a MAN is at this moment profaning 1 by his presence the sacred mysteries of the Thesmophoria.
An immediate investigation results in the detection of Mnesilochus, who is arrested, and guarded by the women until the arrival of one of the Scythian archers who formed the City Police at Athens, By the Scythian he is tied to a plank, and ignominiously exposed in his women's clothes to the mockery of the passers by.
Both while the women are guarding him, and afterwards while he is in the custody of the Scythian, various schemes, based on certain incidents in the tragedies of Euripides (the πανου̑ργος, the inventor of ingenious tricks and devices), are set on foot for the purpose of delivering him out of the hands of his captors.
These, as too subtle, fail to effect their aim.
But at last Euripides wiles away the Scythian by a gross and sensual, and therefore a wholly un-Euripidean, allurement.
And the final scene of the Play shows us Euripides and Mnesilochus fleeing for their lives in one direction ;
whilst the Scythian, misdirected by the Chorus, who have now come to terms with Euripides, is racing full pelt, to overtake the fugitives, in the precisely opposite direction.
In the rescue-scenes Aristophanes draws specially on three Tragedies of Euripides—the Palamede, the Helen, and the Andromeda.
He has a scornful word for the Palamede 2;
but his witty parodies of the Helen and the Andromeda are not intended as a satire on the Plays them­ selves.
The spectacle of Euripides endeavouring to effect the release of Mnesilochus, as the Perseus and Menelaus of his own Plays, was doubtless abundantly 1 entertaining to an Athenian audience.
The humour of the situation is quite irrespective of the actual merits or demerits of the Tragedies.
To this Play there is but a brief allusion, and that confined to a single incident.
Palamede had been put to death in Troy-land by the treachery and violence of his rivals.
And Euripides, in the Tragedy, seems to have made Oeax, Palamede's brother, carve the sad story on oar-blades, which he then launches on the sea, in the hope (which was fulfilled) that they or one of them might float across the Aegean, and convey the intelligence to their father Nauplius in his island-realm of Euboea.
Mnesilochus, desiring to send word of his own sad plight to Euripides, resolves to follow this precedent, but is at once pulled up by the circum­ stance (which he had overlooked) that he has not got any oar-blades.
However, he substitutes the votive tablets suspended in the Temple, carves his story on these, and flings them about in all directions, in the hope that some of them will come to the hands of Euripides, as they apparently do.
The action of Oeax can hardly have been represented on the stage;
it was doubtless merely described in some narrative or song;
and it seems improbable that the language of Mnesilochus, as he is carving his story on the tablet, is to any extent borrowed from the Tragedy of Euripides.
This is the only one of the Three Tragedies which is still extant;
and it may be convenient to give a slight outline of its plot, with special reference to the parody in the present Play.
In his Helen, Euripides, it is hardly necessary to say, followed that strange perversion of the old Homeric legend (so familiar to us from the Palinode1 of Stesichorus) which sent a merely phantom Helen to Ilium, whilst the real Helen, a pure and stainless wife, was wafted by Hermes into Egypt, and entrusted to the charge of the good King Proteus.
But after the death of Proteus, his son and successor Theoclymenus sought, against her will, to make her his wife;
and at the commence­ ment of the Play of Euripides she is discovered sitting on the tomb of Proteus, as her best refuge from the persecutions of his son.
From that coign of vantage she commences the Prologue, explaining in the form of a soliloquy, after the usual Euripidean fashion, all the circumstances of the case.
The soliloquy extends over sixty-seven lines, and is terminated by the entrance of Teucer.
And all the passages placed in the mouth of Mnesilochus previously to the entrance of Euripides are taken from these sixty-seven lines.
The Prologue commences with- (where γύας is strangely employed in apposition to πέδον).
And with these lines, as altered by Aristophanes, Mnesilochus in the Play before us commences his assumption of the character of Helen :
(where λευκη̑ς is absurdly joined with Αἰγύπτου, and the words μελανο­ συρμαῖον λεὼι' are an imitation and exaggeration of the apposition formed by γύας).
After detailing the death of Proteus, leaving two children, Theoelymenus the present king, and Theonoe the seer who knows all things that are, and that are to be, she proceeds to explain who she herself is, and from what country she springs, and who are her father and mother :
She tells how her phantom was carried off to Troy, whilst she herself was wafted to Egypt :
which Aristophanes transposes and alters as follows :
She then falls to bewailing her unhappy lot:
τί δη̑τ ἒτι ;
-Helen, 56 (and again 293) ;
Thesm.
86S. Presently Teucer enters, and his first words are­ τίς τω̑νδ' έρυμνω̑ν δωμάτων ἒχει κράτος ;
—Helen, 68.
a question transferred by.
Aristophanes to Euripides on his first entry (Thesm. 871) in the character of Menelaus.
Teucer's visit appears to be introduced for no other purpose than that of impressing Helen with a false belief in her husband's death.
And so undoubting is her belief that she immediately begins to discuss with the Chorus which is the best method of putting an end to her miserable existence, whether she shall hang herself, or stab herself to death.
The Chorus however make the somewhat obvious suggestion that before proceeding to so extreme a course as that, it would be wiser to inquire of Theonoe, who knows everything that is passing in the world, whether Menelaus Is really alive or dead.
And Helen accordingly goes with them into the palace to consult the Royal seer.
During their absence who should enter but Menelaus himself?
Like a true Euripidean hero, he is clad in rags and tatters;
and finding the stage vacant, he improves the occasion by soliloquizing on his own woes, exactly as Helen had done on hers at the beginning of the Play.
He and Helen (really of course the Phantom, but he does not know that) have been tempest-driven from coast to coast, and finally shipwrecked on this unknown shore.
His ship had been dashed to pieces, a catastrophe necessary for putting him in a helpless condition from which it would require all the ingenuity of Euripides to extricate him.
And he has left Helen with his surviving comrades in the deep recesses of a sea-side cave, whilst he has come up alone to seek for assistance.
Having thus made the situation perfectly clear to the audience, for assuredly neither Menelaus here, nor Helen in the prologue, has been ὰσαφὴς ὲν τῃ̑ φράσει τω̑ι' πραγμάτων, he proceeds to knock at the Palace­ door.
The old woman who keeps it refuses him admittance, and after some valorous threats the hero is reduced to tears.
However, he con­ trives to ask her where he is, and to whom the Palace belongs;
and the following dialogue ensues:
Portions of these lines reappear in the Thesmophoriazusae, broken up by the interruptions of the woman on guard.
On Menelaus asking why the son of Proteus is so hostile to the Hellenes, he receives some surprising information. "
In this Palace," says the portress, "dwells Helen, the daughter of Zeus, the child of Tyndareus, erewhile the Queen of Sparta," With that she re-enters the Palace, and shuts to the door.
Menelaus is naturally taken aback by this piece of information, well knowing (as he thinks) that Helen is safe in the sea-side cave;
but the argumentative subtlety with which Euripides endows his ragged heroes is fully equal to the occasion.
True it is that he has heard of only one Zeus, one Helen, one Tyndareus, one Sparta;
but what of that ?
There may be a mail named Zeus living on the banks of the Nile:
there may be another Helen, another Tyndareus, another Sparta in Egypt.
When he has arrived at this satisfactory conclusion, out come Helen and her companions from the Palace in great glee, having beard from the prophetess that Menelaus is still in the land of the living.
But Helen's rapture is cut short by the sight of the ruffianly desperado at the door, and though she runs like a young racing mare, ὡς δρομαία πω̑λος, to regain the protecting tomb, he seizes her just as she reaches it.
How­ ever, she soon recognizes her husband, whilst he on his part is amazed at the extraordinary likeness which this stranger lady bears to Helen.
Aristophanes draws largely on this scene, but it must be remembered that whilst in the Thesmophoriazusae there is full mutual recognition between the husband and wife;
in the "Helen" Menelaus merely recognizes the resemblance, and does not for a moment believe that Helen herself is really before him.
Helen, 557, 558, 561-566.
These lines are found in the Thesmophoriazusae (905-912) with only two material alterations.
The first line becomes ὦθεοὶ, TLV' ὃψιν εἰσ
ορω̑, τίς εἶ γύναι ;
where the exclamation ὦ θεοὶ is perhaps a reminiscence of Helen 560 ὦ θεοί θεὸς yap καὶ TO γιγνώσκειν φίλους.
And in the sixth line the words γέ σ'ούδ' ἒχω τί φω̑ are converted into σ'ὃσα γ'ὲκ τω̑ν ἰφύων for the purpose of pointing a joke at the parentage of Euripides.
But in the Tragedy, when Helen says ὦ χρόνιοςὲλθὡν ση̑ς δάμαρτος ὲς χέρας, instead of taking her into his arms (as he does in the Thesmo­ phoriazusae) he indignantly repulses her, ποίας δάμαρτος ;
μὴ θίγῃς ὲμω̑ν πέπλων.
Nor will he believe that she is really Helen, until a sailor, arriving from the sea-side cave, informs him that the Phantom has vanished into air.
With the rest of the Play the Thesmophoriazusae has nothing to do;
and it will be sufficient here to mention that the husband and wife, having recognized each other, take counsel together how to deceive the king and escape from Egypt.
The superior ingenuity of Helen soon devises a plan ;
she gains over to her side the omniscient Theonoe, and when Theoclymenus returns she passes off the ragged ruffian with whom she is conversing as a seaman from the ship of Menelaus, who has brought her tidings of her husband's shipwreck and death.
Now then, she says, she is ready and willing to marry Theoclymenus, but he must first allow her to pay the last honours, in Hellenic fashion, to her late Hellenic husband.
It is the custom of their people, they explain, when such a one as Menelaus is lost at sea, to send out a vessel with a suit of armour, and provisions of all sorts, to the distant horizon, and there the stores are to be cast into the waves.
Theoclymenus falls into the trap, and furnishes the ship, the arms, and the provisions, with which the pair make their escape.
The outwitting of the dull barbarian by the cunning Greek is fully as humorous in the Tragedy as in the Comedy, and of course in the Tragedy there is none of the grossness which discolours the closing scenes of the Thesmophoriazusae.
Theoclymenus now turns his anger against his sister Theonoe, apparently 1 for no other purpose than to provide a somewhat lame excuse for the familiar apparition of the Deus ex machinâ (in this instance Castor and Polydeuces) at the ending of the Play.
The Andromeda, which was exhibited at the same festival as the Helen, was considered by the ancients to be one of the most beautiful 2 and pathetic of all the Tragedies of Euripides;
and there is nothing in the Aristophanic parody to throw doubt upon the justice of this estimate.
Like the Iphigeneia in Aulis, and the Rhesus, it dispensed with the ordinary Euripidean prologue;
and the fall of the curtain discloses Andromeda already bound to the rock, awaiting the break of day, and the coming of the sea-monster to devour her.
She is singing a lament over her mournful fate, and the opening lines are repeated, apparently without alteration, in Thesm.
1065 seqq.:
0 holy Night, she sings, how long 3 a course thou pursnest, driving thy car over the star-studded ridges of holy Aether, through most august Olympus.
And as she pauses, her closing words are softly wafted back by the echo of the surrounding hills;
doubtless a dainty, and even a touching, device in the Andromeda, although, in the Thesmophoriazusae, Aristophanes prolongs and perverts it into most laughable comedy.
And presently the virgins, who were her fellows in her fathers court, come in, as the Chorus of the Play, to mingle their sorrows and lamentations with those of their hapless Princess.
The long monody of Mnesilochus, commencing with the words φίλαι παρθένοι, φίλαι, and extending from line 1015 to line 1055, is throughout a parody of Andromeda's address to these "dear, dear Maidens," and of their sympathetic replies;
the old Athenian every­ where embellishing the narrative of his own misfortunes with the plaintive wailings of the tender damsel, doomed to a miserable death in her early youth, unwedded and unwooed.
So the night wears away, and with the dawn the monster is to come.
Probably its approach is supposed to be visible to Andromeda, though of course invisible to the audience.
But before it can reach its helpless victim there enters upon the scene the Hellenic Saint George, Perseus of the wingèd sandals, άμφὶ δὲ ποσσὶν ἒχε πτερόεντα πέδιλα.
At first he does not perceive the maiden, and merely wonders at what coast he has happened to arrive (Thesm. 1098 seqq.).
And even when his eye falls upon the strange spectacle, at first he takes her for a marble figure, carved in rare beauty from the rock itself by some cunning sculptor's hand.
But when he finds that she is really a living damsel bound to the rock, he is moved with admiration and compassion, and hastens at once to address her.
The dialogue which ensues is adumbrated in Thesm.
1105 seqq. and is there terminated by the attempt of Perseus to unloose her bonds, an attempt frustrated by the Scythian archer.
In the Tragedy, doubtless, he does not unloose her bonds until he has slain the monster of the deep.
With this abortive attempt at rescue the parody of the Andromeda in the Thesmophoriazusae concludes.
But the first five words of line 105 1 of the Frogs are supposed to be taken from a later scene in the Andro­ meda, and to be spoken by Cepheus (Andromeda's father), who is unwilling to disclose his intentions with regard to his daughter's marriage, and resents the pertinacity with which Perseus endeavours to elicit them.
There is no room in the Tragedy of Euripides for any antecedent promise on the part of the king to give his daughter in marriage to her rescuer.
It is Andromeda herself who in the Play gives the promise.
0 Lady, says Perseus, if I deliver you, will you look favourably upon me ?
0 Stranger, she replies, take me as your hand maid, or your wife, or your captive, whichever you will.
And now, what is the date of the Comedy before us ?
The Lysistrata, as we know from the didascalia preserved in the Greek Argument to that Play, was exhibited in the archonship of Callias (the Callias who succeeded Cleocritus), that is, at the commencement of the year B.C. 411, after the appointment of the πρόβουλοι, but before the revolution of the Four Hundred.
And the Thesmophoriazusae is commonly assigned to the same date.
But it seems clear that this is erroneous, and that it was produced a year later, in the archonship of Theopompus, at the commence­ ment of the year 3 B.C. 410, after the disappearance of the Four Hundred.
We have no didascalia, or other direct statement, purporting to give its exact date;
but there are various chronological notes which seem to point conclusively to the later year.
1.
One circumstance which would of itself almost carry conviction to my mind, though many would probably disregard it, is the remarkable difference in tone between the two Plays.
In the Lysistrata everything is sombre and anxious ;
there are tears even in its mirth.
The Thesmo­ phoriazusae is everywhere gay, light-hearted, and playful:
the poet wrote it in his most frolicsome mood.
In this respect the Lysistrata faithfully reflects the feeling prevalent in Athens at the close of the year B. C. 412.
The Sicilian catastrophe which had taken place in the autumn of the preceding year not merely annihilated the Athenian fleets;
it had also demonstrated, or seemed to demonstrate, the superiority of the Syracusan seamen to those of Athens.
And all through the year B. c. 412 allies were falling away, hostile forces gathering in ever increasing numbers, and even the triumphant Syracusan triremes were speeding over the sea, to be present at the downfall of Athens.
In the petty naval engagements which had occurred the Athenian ships had met with varying fortunes, and had shown no sign of maintaining their former maritime superiority.
And at the time when the Lysistrata was composed the prospect was in every way more gloomy than it had ever been before, and than it ever became again until the final disaster of Aegospotami.
But at the close of the year B. C. 411 (when, in my opinion, the Thesmophoriazusae was composed) men's minds were lighter and more buoyant, and hopes were once more entertained that Athens might yet emerge in safety from the war.
The commencement of this happier period is traced by Thueydides 1 to the downfall of the revolutionary Council of 400, and the restoration of the old constitutional Council of 500.
And then too the ever-successful genius of Alcibiades was again enlisted in his country's service;
whilst in the battle of Cynossema (about Sept. 411) her renovated fleet of seventy-six triremes entirely defeated a more numerous Peloponnesian fleet (supposed to have consisted of eighty-six triremes), which included the dreaded Sicilian squadron under the leadership of Hermocrates.
When the news of this unhoped-for good fortune reached Athens, Thucydides tells us (and they are almost the last words he ever wrote) the Athenians were greatly invigorated, and concluded that by strenuous efforts they might yet be able to get the better of their difficulties.
And this victory was followed, a month later, by a still more splendid one off Abydos, when, after the battle had raged from morn to eve without any decisive result, Alcibiades with eighteen triremes arrived in the nick of time to turn the scale so completely in favour of the Athenians that they captured no less than thirty of the Peloponnesian triremes, and but for the intervention of Pharnabazus would in all probability have destroyed the entire fleet 2.
To the sanguine and cheerful spirit which now succeeded their despondency, the bright and playful tone of the Thesmophoriazusae seems to me exactly to correspond.
2.
In the Parabasis the Chorus are instituting a comparison between the relative merits of men and of women.
They take the name of a man and the name of a woman, and, placing them side by side, show that in each case the woman is the superior of the two.
And the first instance they give is Ναυσιμάχης μέν γ' ἢττων ὲστὶν χαρμȋνος• δη̑λα δὲ τἂργα.
They are referring to the defeat, η̐ττα, of the Athenian general Charminus in a naval engagement, ναυσιμάχη, off the little island of Syme;
and it is important, for our present purpose, to ascertain, as nearly as we can, when that engagement took place.
The story is told by Thucydides, Book VIII, chaps.
39-43.It was about the winter solstice 1, Dec. 21, B. c. 412, that the Spartans sent out a detachment of twenty-seven triremes to join their main fleet at Miletus.
The main fleet of the Athenians was stationed at Samos, a little to the north-west of Miletus.
The detachment started from Cape Malea at the south-eastern extremity of Laconia, and proceeded in a straight course to Melos.
There it fell in with ten Athenian ships, three of which it destroyed, having captured them without their crews.
The other seven took to flight.
This incident disarranged all the plans of the Peloponnesian commanders.
They had on board several very important officials for whose safety they were bound to take all possible precautions;
and they rightly anticipated that the fugitives would make for Samos, and report to the Athenian fleet the approach of the Pelo­ ponnesian reinforcements.
Consequently, instead of continuing their journey to the north-east, they turned southward, fetched a wide circuit by Crete, and arrived, after a prolonged voyage, at Caunus, on the south coast of Caria, a little beyond the island of Rhodes.
Thence they sent messengers to the Peloponnesian fleet asking it to come down and convoy them back to Miletus.
Mean while, what they had anticipated had occurred.
Their approach had been reported by the fugitives from Melos to the Athenian fleet, and Charminus had been sent down with twenty triremes from Samos to intercept the detachment.
Charminus, having ascertained that it had taken shelter at Caunus, kept cruising about the islands of Syme, Chalce, and Rhodes on the one side, and as far as the Lycian coast on the other, ready to attack it when it again put to sea.
But now, in answer to the appeal from Caunus, the entire Pelopon­ nesian fleet, under Astyochus, was moving southward from Miletus.
They stopped at Cos, sacked the town and ravaged the country;
and then passed on to Cnidus.
It was night when they reached Cnidus, and hearing that Charminus was at the neighbouring island of Syme,.
Astyochus, without disembarking at Cnidus, pressed on the same night to Syme.
The night was wet and cloudy, and he arrived at Syme without Charminus having any suspicion of his proximity.
The Athenians, being on the look-out for ships approaching from Caunus, would naturally be stationed on the south side of the island, while Astyochus, arriving from Cnidus, would approach the island from the north.
In the dark and stormy night he found it impossible to keep his numerous ships in hand, and a few of them drifted round the eastward coast of the island, and when the day broke became visible to Charminus.
Thinking them to be part of the detachment for which lie was lying in wait, he at once attacked them, sinking three ships, and damaging others;
when suddenly he found himself in the midst of the whole Peloponnesian fleet, and was glad to escape with the loss of six triremes;
first, to a friendly island, and then to Hali­ carnassus.
What period of time was covered by these operations we cannot now even conjecture.
But since they did not commence until Dec. 21, B.C. 412 or thereabouts, it seems unlikely that the news of the defeat of Charminus could have reached Athens before the dramatic contests at the commencement of B. c. 411 had actually taken place;
and quite certain that it could not have done so before the competing Plays had been accepted by the Archon, and were in a forward state of preparation for the stage.
Though, even if the story could by any possibility have arrived in time for Aristophanes to embody it in his Play, it is in­ conceivable that he should have made a jest of it while the wound was still fresh.
At that moment, as we have already seen, the fortunes of Athens were at their lowest ebb, and every piece of good or ill tidings would send a thrill through the entire community.
The loss of three triremes at Melos and six at Syme would have been a sore discourage­ ment to the Athenians;
and the poet would have been as little inclined to make, as the audience to listen to, a joke on so unwelcome a disaster.
A year later 1, when fortune had again begun to smile upon the Athenian navy.
it was natural to make light of their previous discouragements.3.
A few lines later in the Parabasis, Aristophanes reflects on the conduct of last year's Councillors in surrendering to others the rights and duties of their senatorial office :
Is any one of our last year's Councillors—a man who surrendered his councillorship to another—superior to (Eubule) the Lady of good counsel?
Paulmier de Grentemesnil, a man of extraordinary erudition and scholarly acumen for the times in which he lived (1587-1670), saw at once that this could only refer to the memorable incident described by Thucydides in the eighth Book of his History (chaps. 69 and 70) when the Four Hundred oligarchic revolutionaries suddenly entered the Council-house, and ordered the 500 constitutional Councillors to take their pay and begone.
About a century before, when a Spartan king 2, assisting one Athenian faction against the other, had in like manner attempted -to dissolve the Council of 500, he was met with so stout and determined a resistance on the part of that body that his political schemes were entirely frustrated, and he himself compelled to flee from Athens.
A similar resistance was naturally anticipated now, and every prepara­ tion had been made to overcome it.
But the preparations were needless.
The Four Hundred had not even to disclose the daggers which they carried concealed on their persons;
nor were the services of the 120 Hellenic youths, who were accustomed to carry out their behests, on this occasion required.
Not a blow was struck, not a voice was raised, in defence of the 500, or of their constitutional rights and duties.
The Councillors quietly pocketed their salary (the salary for their entire year of office, and not merely so much of it as had already been earned) and evacuated the Council-house without a remonstrance.
This tame surrender by the democratic Council of all its powers and privileges was not only a very striking event, it was also an event of the greatest importance, removing every obstacle in Athens to the success of the oligarchical revolution.
It took place, as we now know from the Polity of Athens, chapter 32, about the end of May, B.C. 411, during the archonship of Callias, a date exactly suiting the note of time in the Thesmophoriazusae if the Play was exhibited at the commencement of B.C. 410, but of course quite incompatible with the earlier date.
Those who contend that the Play was acted in the year B.C. 411 find an insuperable difficulty in the allusion before us.
Paulmier himself suggests that Thucydides narrates the dissolution of the 500 out of its chronological order, and that it really occurred in the early part of B.C. 412, but this is plainly inadmissible.
C. O. Müller (Greek Lit. xxviii. § 9) thinks that the Chorus are referring to the appointment of the πρόβουλοι in B.C. 412, but this appointment involved no surrender of the Councillorship.
Others frankly admit that they cannot imagine what the Chorus can mean.
4.
The civic arrangements in the two Plays, the Lysistrata and the Thesmophoriazusae, exhibit a difference exactly corresponding to the two dates, the winter of 412, 411;
and the winter of 411, 410.
At the former period the πρόβουλοι, who preceded the Four Hundred, were in office;
and in the Lysistrata it is they who intervene to keep order, and employ for that purpose the Scythian archers.
At the later period the πρόβουλοι and the Four Hundred had alike passed away, and the consti­ tutional Council of 500 had been restored to, and was in quiet enjoyment of, its normal privileges;
and accordingly in the Thesmophoriazusae order is kept and the Scythian archers employed in the normal manner by the council acting through its prytanes, just as in the Acharnians and the Knights.
5.
In the data which we have next to consider the reader must care­ fully bear in mind-what even the most eminent chronologers seem occasionally to forget-that the Athenians, in employing such numerals as τρίτος, τέταρτος, and the like, include as well the day, time, or thing from which the calculation starts, as the day, time, or thing with which it concludes.
Thus, if we start with Monday, Tuesday is ή ὑστεραία, and Wednesday I ἡ τρίτη, the third, and not (as we should say) the second, day from Monday.
It would be difficult to give a better example than is found at the commencement of the Euthydemus of Plato.
There three persons were sitting in the following order:
Socrates, Cleinias, Euthy­ demus.
We should call Euthydemus the second from Socrates, but Plato calls him the third.
Crito is asking who Euthydemus is;
and to make it clear whom he means, he says to Socrates, ὃν μὲν ἐγὼ λέγω, ἐκ δεξιᾶς τρίτος ἀπὸ σοῦ καθῆστο· ἐν μέσῳ δ’ ὑμῶν TO ’Αξιόχου μειράκιον (Cleinias) ἦν.
There was but one between Euthydemus and Socrates, yet Euthy­ demus was τρίτος ἀπὸ Σωκράτους.
It is hardly necessary to add that, as a rule, the years mentioned by the Scholiasts are those of the Athenian archons, extending (about) from Midsummer to Midsummer.
Putting these two rules together, we may observe that if one event happened in May 411, and another in September 410, although we should consider the second event as happening in the year after the first, an Athenian would reckon it as happening in the third year from the first.
It will make the matter clearer if I here set down the list of Athenian Archons during the 91st, 92nd, and 93rd Olympiads :
Now, in Thesm.
841 Aristophanes mentions Lamachus in a very compli­ mentary manner.
And the Scholiast says, ἐπαινεῖ τὸν Λάμαχον νῦν· ἤδη γὰρ ἐτεθνήκει ἐν Σικελίᾳ τετάρτῳ ἔτει πρότερ
ον.
If then the Thesmo­ phoriaznsae was exhibited in the archonship of Theopompus (B.C. 410), he must, for the reasons we have just been considering, have placed the death of Lamachus in the archonship of Peisander.
And this is the true date.
Thucydides indeed, who divides the year into two periods, the summer and the winter (irrespective of archonships), merely says that he died in the summer (of B.C. 414) which would include the last quarter of the archonship of Chabrias, as well as the first quarter of the archonship of Peisander;
but fortunately Diodorus is more precise, and expressly assigns it to the year of Peisander's archonship (Book xiv, chaps. 7 and 8).6. Again, the Scholiast on Thesm.
190 says, γέρων γὰρ τότε Εὐριπίδης ἦν· ἕκτῳ yovv ἔτει ὕστερον τελευτᾷ.
Taking then the archonship of Theopompus (B. c. 410) as our starting-point, we have to pass over the four succeeding Archons—Glaucippus, Diodes, Euctemon, and Antigenes, and the next Archon will be the sixth from Theopompus.
Accordingly, the next Archon, we shall find, is Callias ὁ μετὰ ’Αντιγένη;
in whose year of office, as we know, the death of Euripides occurred.
Strangely enough Mr. Fynes Clinton in his Fasti Hellenici (anno 411) relies on these very references to the death of Lamachus and the death of Euripides, as showing that the Play was acted in the archonship of Callias;
whereas they both plainly show that it was acted in the archon­ ship of Theopompus.
He sees, indeed, that there is something wrong about the reference to the death of Euripides, and observes, "If the Scholiast placed the death of Euripides in the year of Antigenes, the sixth year would be the exact description.
Euripides however died in the year of Callias B.C. 406, between whom and the present Callias are five archons;
which sufficiently agrees with the date of this comedy at the Dionysia of B.C. 411."
This is a singular way of making the Scholiast prove the reverse of what he says.
Here then are six notes of time all unmistakeably pointing to the archonship of Theopompus as the date of the production of the Thesmo­ phoriazusae.
There is but one argument in favour of the earlier date B.C. 411, and although that is undoubtedly a strong one, it seems to me altogether insufficient to turn the balance against the cumulative weight of all these arguments in favour of B.C. 410.
In line 1060 of the Play we are told that Echo in the preceding year, πέρυσιν, contended on the Attic stage in conjunction with Euripides;
a statement which the Scholiast, no doubt rightly, explains by saying ἐπεὶ πέρυσιν ἐδιδάχθη ἡ ’Ανδρομέδα.
In line 850 Mnesilochus speaks of the Helen as a "new play of Euripides, τὴν καινὴν Ἑλένην, and the Scholiast on line 1012 tells us that the Andromeda was exhibited on the same occasion as the Helen, συνδεδίδακται τῃ̑ Ἑλένῃ.
Now the Scholiast on Frogs 53 informs us that the Andromeda was produced in the eighth year before the Frogs.
The latter Play was acted, as we know, in the Archonship of Callias (the Callias who succeeded Antigenes).
And if we look at the list of Archons given above, bearing in mind the rules already laid down, we shall find that the eighth Archonship before that of Callias was the archonship of Cleocritus.
This would place the exhibition of the Andromeda at the commencement of the year B.C. 412;
and therefore the Thesmo­ phoriazusae, as well as the Lysistrata1 would have to be assigned to the year B.C. 411, in direct conflict with the statements in the Scholia about the death of Lamachus and the death of Euripides, and with all the indications of time to be found in the Comedy itself.
However, in the matter of dates the Scholiasts are of little authority.
Either by their own mistakes, or by the carelessness of transcribers, they are so frequently wrong, that their chronological statements cannot stand against any real historical evidence.
To take one instance out of many.
On line 32 of the present Play the Scholiast says that Agathon exhibited his first Tragedy1 only three years before the date of the Thesmo­ phoriazusae.
Nobody attaches any weight to this statement.
It is known that Agathon gained the prize in the Tragic competition of B.C. 416, when Euphemus was archon.
Some therefore would alter the word " 3 " in the Scholium to " 6 " or " 5 ”;
an alteration which can only be justified on the assumption that the Scholiast was sure to be always right.
Doubtless he wrote " 3," and was wrong.
So in the Scholium on the Frogs 2, which gives rise to all the mischief, Dobree would alter “ 8 ” into "7."
I have no doubt that the Scholiast wrote “8,” and was wrong.
On the whole, therefore, there seems ample reason for affirming that the Thesmophoriazusae was produced at the commencement of the year B.C. 410, when Theopompus was archon.
I am not aware of any poetical translation of the Thesmophoriazusae in the English language3.
At some subsequent period Aristophanes wrote another comedy under the same name.
It was commonly called αἱ δεύετεραι (or αἱ ἕτεραι) Θεσμοφοριάζουσαι. Demetrius of Troezen named it αἱ Θεσμοφοριάσασαι 1, and though the name took no root, it tends to show that the action of the second Play was laid at a later stage of the festival than the action of the First.
And there seems every reason to believe that in the second Play the Νηστεία, during which the scenes of the present Comedy are supposed to have taken place, was represented as already past, and the Καλλιγένεια, the fourth and last day of the Festival, was already dawning.
We know that Calligeneia herself appeared as the Prologist 2 of the second Play;
and that Aristophanes represented her as the nurse3 of Demeter.
Her appearance would indicate that the whole-day Fast was over, and the prologue by the nurse of Demeter may well have been, to some extent, a parody on the Euripidean prologue by the nurse of Medea.
The women appear to have been faint and exhausted after their long fast, and one speaker4 is anxiously inquiring of another whether any fish or flesh has been provided to sustain the weary worshippers.
So far we seem to be on tolerably safe ground:
but to the further question whether the action in the Second Play proceeded on the same lines as the action in the First, or whether the plot was altogether different, the fragments do not enable us to give any confident answer.
Yet there were certainly some points of similarity between the two Plays.
The injunction to abstain from stimulating wines 5, which Bergk strangely supposes to be a portion of the address of Calligeneia to the female chorus, is, on the face of it, obviously addressed to a man, and is just the advice which might be given to one who, disguised as a woman, was about to mingle in an assembly of women.
And a sub­ sequent fragment' shows that the precept either was not followed, or had not the anticipated result.
The list of articles pertaining to a woman's toilet, which forms the longest of all the fragments2, could scarcely be more appropriate to any scene than to one in which a man was being dressed up as a woman.
Two other lines3, also preserved by Pollux, would seem to refer, not to the putting on, but to the taking off, of the woman's clothes.
The statement by the same author that " in the Thesmophoriazusae the name ὄκλασμα was given to the ' Persian dance 4’” might lead us to suppose that Elaphium's dance was repeated in the second Play:
unless indeed (which seems possible) Pollux is making an erroneous reference to the present Play, and ought to have said that " in the Thesmophoriazusae the ὄκλασμα was given the name of the ' Persian dance.
’”There is no ground for supposing that Euripides, or Agathon, or any other character of the earlier Play reappeared in the later;
yet the lines which Hephaestion5 preserves as a specimen of mixed paeonics and cretics —Call not upon the Muses of the waving curls, nor summon to the Chorus the Olympian Graces, for they are here, so the Poet says—sound almost like a reference to the language of Agathon's servant that the Muses are here and are making their odes, In my Master’s abodes.
And in another passage1 both Agathon and his antitheses are mentioned, but in a way from which no inference can be drawn.
It is impossible to put the matter higher than to say that the passages to which the reader's attention has been directed are quite consistent with the idea that the second Comedy was framed on somewhat similar lines to the first;
we cannot add that they would be inconsistent with an altogether different plot.
Their evidence therefore amounts to little or nothing.
And the other fragments (about twenty in number) afford no clue to the nature of the drama from which they were taken.
Other writers have been able to arrive at a more definite conclusion.
From the name which Demetrius of Troezen gave to the Play (as men­ tioned above), Dindorf and Bergk are both satisfied that the Second Comedy was in reality.
a continuation of the First ;
" nunquam enim," says the former (Aristophanes, ii. 503), “de inscriptione fabulae in hunc modum mutandâ cogitare potuisset Demetrius, nisi Thesmophoriazusas editione alter'a non tarn repetitam quam continuatam esse vidisset."
Bergk (Meineke’s Fragm. Corn. Graec. ii. 1074) is still more explicit.
" Demetrii . auctoritas," he says, " etsi non invaluit, tamen indicio est, actionem in superstite fabulâ inchoatam, in hac alterâ comoedia perfectam consumma­ tamque esse, ita ut eontinuo quasi vinculo utrumque drama fuerit con­ junetum.”
This seems to me a very improbable conjecture.
Yet it is not more improbable than the theory propounded by Bernard Thiersch in the little essay -he Thesmophoriazusis secundis prefixed to his edition of the present Play.
Thiersch infers from the name Θεσμο­ φ
οριάσασαι that the Thesmophoria had come to an end;
and he thinks that Calligeneia, in the prologue, came forward to complain of the mean and niggardly manner in which the Athenian matrons had kept the festival:
And he concludes (the italics are his own) Aristophanem in Thesmophoriazusis secundis Athenienses castigasse, quod sancta maiorum pietate exuti deorum festa splendide celebrare et decorare negligerent.
One of Fritzsche’s Aristophanic tracts was entitled " De Aristophanis Thesmophoriazusis secundis Commentatio.”
It was first published at Rostock in 1831, and was republished at the end of his edition of the present Play.
He argues that the action of the later Comedy was laid on the Καλλιγένεια, the last day of the festival, and in this I entirely agree with him ;
and arrives at a conclusion exactly opposite to that pro­ pounded by Thiersch;
" Illud igitur certum, summam rei et quasi eardinem totius fabulae in eo verti, ut luxus Atticarum mulierum, quae the potissimum Calligeniae pretiosam vestem sumsisse videntur ae mirifice corpus exornasNe suum, rideatur, atque edacitas earum immoderatusque amor vini, adde etiam Veneris, exagitetur."
Here again the italics are in the original.
I cannot myself see sufficient in the Fragments either to support or to overthrow any of these theories.
EASTWOOD, STRAWBERRY HILL,August, 1903.
THE fall of the curtain discloses to the audience two elderly men walking in a street at Athens.
One is Euripides ;
the other his wife's kinsman Mnesi­ lochus.
The latter is obviously con­ sumed by weariness and annoyance, which at length find vent in the ejacu­ lation, 0 Jeus, will the swallow NEVER make its appearance?
The swallow in the east, as in the west, of Europe is the prænuntia veris (Ovid, Fasti ii. 853, cf. Horace, Epistles I. vii. 13), the herald and harbinger of Spring.
Its advent in Hellas was greeted with the cry ὥρα νέα, χελιδὼν, Knights 419.
And in Rhodes the children went round to the doors of the wealthy, demanding a largess in the name of the newly ar­ rived swallow.
The pretty little carol, or song of the swallow, with which they announced their visit and pre­ ferred their request, is preserved by Athenaeus viii.
60.
Our proverb that “ one swallow does not make a summer " was familiar to Aristotle under the form μία χελιδὼν ἔαρ oil ποιεῖ, Eth. Nic. I. vii. 16;
a proverb already used by Cratinus a century before;
Cramer's Anecd.
Par. i. p. 182.
And the brief section which Aelian (N. A. i. 52) devotes to the swallow is so thoroughly English in its tone and sentiment that I cannotforbear giving it in full :
Χελιδὼν δὲ ἄρα Peace 800, Birds 714.
The return of Spring has in all countries furnished a familiar type of bright prospects restored after a long interval of dark­ ness and distress.
And the question “Will the swallow never appear?" is here an expression of desponding impatience on the part of Mnesilo­ chus worn out with the tedious journey, of which he does not know the object, and cannot foresee the termination.
τοῦτο ἔφη ἐν ἤθει, says the Scholiast, ἀπαλλάξομαι ;
So in the closing lines of the "Pervigilium Veneris" the de­ sponding lover exclaims (as the text should perhaps be constituted),Kuster refers to the fragment preserved by Harpocration (s. v. ἄττα, Eustathius (on Iliad i. 554), and others
The appeal of Mnesilochus is to Zeus, as the lord of the sky and the seasons.2. ἀλοω̑ν]
The word is.
borrowed from the threshing-floor ;
and from the opera­ tions which were there carried on, it acquired the double signification of driving round and round and pounding.
Hesychius gives πλανω̑ as the meaning of ἀλοω̑, and both πλανω̑ν and τύπτωνas the meanings of ἀλοω̑ν.
The former is of course the signification which it bears here.
ἕωθεν (vulgo ἔξωθεν) ἐν κύκλω̨ περιάγων, says the Scholiast, ὡς οἱ ἐν ται̑ς ἅλωσι.
And so Suidas.
The disgust of Mnesilochus is aptly expressed, as well by the use of this strong metaphor as by his application of the term ἅνθρωπος, the fellow, to his illustrious companion.
Euripides was obliged to pay his visit at this early hour because the women's assembly itself was to be held at day­ break, ἕωθεν, infra 376, and see Eccl. 20 and the note there.3. σπλη̑να]
The ancients attributed to the action of the spleen (lien) the internal heavings and palpitations oc­ casioned by violent exercise or ex­ citement.
Thus in Plautus, Casina, II.

De labore pectus tundit.
And in Mercator, 1. i. 13 (to which I observe Bothe also refers) Acanthio, panting and out of breath, says genua hunc cursorem deserunt.

Euripides talks in a high philosophic strain, quite above the comprehension of his simple, though shrewd, companion, o μὲν τραγι­ (ει, says the Scholiast, ὁ δὲ (Mnesilochus) ταπεινότερ

We know that Aris­ tophanes, when he was composing this Comedy, had the recent "Helen" of Euripides very much in his mind, and possibly he may here be thinking of line 471 of that Play, where Mene­ laus says to the keeper of the palace .12.
του̑ μήτ'ἀκούειν μήθ' ὁρα̑ν]
Tyrwhitt was the first to observe that these five words should be severed from, and are really a comment on, the preceding line.
They are rightly explained by the Scholiast, ἀντὶ τοῦ εὶπείν τοῦ ἀκούειν Ka\ opav, L7Tc TOV (IT)Tanoveivprjff opav.
Fritzsche indeed, considering them a continuation of Euripides's speech, would render that speech as follows :
"Imo aliud est horum alterutrum, aut audire aut videre ;
aliud neutrum, neque audire neque videre."
"I said that you were not to hear and see ;
which is something quite different from say­ ing that you were neither to hear nor to see."
But this, though harmonizing excellently with the dialogue up to this point, is quite inconsistent with the explanation which Euripides now proceeds to unfold.
"What you see," he says in effect, "you must not hear :
and what you hear you must not see :
the objects of these two senses (sight and hearing) must be kept distinct, even as the organs by which they act are in the nature of things essentially distinct."
The words εὖἴσθ' ὅτι here, as in Peace 373, constitute an emphatic answer in the affirmative to the pre­ ceding question.13. τότε]
Then, ὅτε διεκρίθη],
An anony­ mous critic would read ποτὲ, but of course τότε is constantly used in refer­ ence to a former period to which the speaker's mind has travelled, but which has not been actually mentioned.
So in the fourteenth of Lucian's Sea Dialogues, where the Nereids are told that Andro­ meda has been rescued from the set­ monster which they had sent against her, one of them answers, 'Εγὼ μὲν οὖ TOTE, καὶ ἠξίου καλλίων εἶναι ;
where, since no allusion had previously been made to the mother's offence, Graevius conjectures ποτέ.
So in Iph. in Aul. 46 the old servant says where again Barnes and Musgrave would read ποτὲ, but the MS.
reading is rightly retained by Markland and Bishop Monk, who cite Orestes 99, Al- cestis 915, Helen 1081, Sophocles, Ajax 650, 1240, and the present passage.
For other examples in Aristophanes see Peace 694, Lys. 1023, infra 642, and Frogs 136.
And see generally Eur. Medea 1402, Electra 975, 1149, 1203. Thuc. i. 86 ;
viii. 40, 86.14. Αἰθήρ]
Ether, always put forward by Aristophanes as the chief Euripidean deity (see Frogs 892 and the note there), is throughout this passage re­ garded as the great active and intelli­ gent Principle, evolving out of her own substance the various forms of the animal creation.
When Ether was first parting and dividing herself, and giving birth within herself to living and moving bodies.
διεχωρίζετο, which is universally taken in a passive sense, and translated secerni coepit, seems to mean divided herself;
for who but Ether, in this philosophy, could divide Ether ?
And here again, as in line 6 supra, Aris­ tophanes may he thinking of the " Helen."Bergler refers to the famous oration of Μελανίππη σοφὴ (Wagner Fragm.
5) where that ingenious young lady, who has hidden her illegitimate children in the cow-house, is endeavouring to per­ suade her father, by an argument drawn from the original homogeneous­ ness of all matter, that it is as natural for cows to give birth to boys, as to calves.
It was from the same philosophic comedy that Aristophanes borrowed line 272 infra,17. ἀντίμιμον]
Both these compari­ sons, that of the eye with the sun, and that of the ear with a funnel, are found in the Republic of Plato.
In vi. 19 (508 B) he calls the human eye γάνων.
And in iii. 18 (411 A) he ob­ serves, "He who allows the strains of plaintive and touching music to sink down into his soul, through his ears, as it were through a funnel (διὰ τω̑ν ὤτων ὥσπερ διὰ χὡνης), at first indeed moulds and tempers the iron element of his mind, and makes that service­ able which before was rigid and use­ less ;
but if he lend himself too long to those soft and tender melodies, they will at last melt and dissolve his soul, and he will become, what Homer calls, but a nerveless warrior."
I sus­ pect that in this opening dialogue there is a far more extensive parodying of the words of Euripides than we are now in a position to detect.
21. αἱ σοφαὶ ξυνουσίαι]
The Scholiast cites a line, σοφοὶ τύραννοι τω̑ν σοφω̑ν ξυνουσία̨, about the authorship of which there was much discussion amongst an­ cient writers.
It seems to have made its first appearance in the " Locrian Aias" of Sophocles, and to have been borrowed from thence by Euripides, to whom it was consequently ascribed by Plato, Antisthenes, and Stobaeus, and, according to the Scholiast here, by Aristophanes himself in the " Heroes."
Such was apparently the conclusion at which Aulus Gellius (xiii. 18) arrived ;
and he gives other instances of lines borrowed by Euripides from preceding poets.
And see the note on Frogs 1182.
The authorities on the subject will be found in Wagner's Fragments of the " Locrian Aias."
With the form in which it here appears, Person com­ pares a line of Eupolis preserved by the Scholiast (and, in part, by Eusta­ thius) on Iliad ii. 333 οἶόν γέ πού 'στι24. προσμάθοιμι]
The MSS.
have προσ­ μάθοι μὴ, and it is not altogether easy to determine whether this should be altered into προσμάθοιμι or into προσμάθω μή.
Each alteration makes perfectly good Greek, and is supported by emi­ nent scholars :
and in each there would of course be the same gird at Euripides as the great χωλοποιός;
Ach. 411, Peace 147, Frogs 846.
But though in the translation, using Bekker's edition, I followed Bekker's reading προσμύθω μὴ, yet I quite concur with most of the recent editors in thinking that the genuine reading is προσμάθοιμι, and that the words χωλο̇ς εἶναι τὼ σκέλη are added παρὰ προσδοκίαν, as a mere piece of im­ pertinence on the part of Mnesilochus.
And the Scholiast's explanation ἵναμὴ περιπατήση̨ μετ'αὐτου̑, however inaccu­ rate in itself, yet shows that he read προσμάθοιμι.
26.
ὁρᾳ̑ς τὸ θύριον του̑το;
]
He is point­ ing to the house of Agathon in the background of the stage.
The words are repeated from Clouds 92.27.
σιωπω̑ τὸθύριον;
]
This seems to be simple nonsense, intended to repre­ sent the effect produced on the old man's mind by the philosophic subtlety of his companion's talk.
The same sort of mild imbecility is evident in line 19 Then it is all along of the funnel that I am neither to hear nor to see!
and indeed in the οἶμαί γε of the present line, which indicates a want of con­ fidence in his own eyesight, after Euri­ pides's abstruse explanation of the origin and functions of the eye.
Com­ pare the language of Strepsiades on first listening to the luminous wisdom of Socrates ;
Clouds 236.
There is however great ingenuity in the view advanced by Fritzsche.
who supposes that the remarks of Mnesilochus in this and the following line are mere reca­ pitulations whereby he is endeavouring to impress upon his memory the several points which, as he supposes, Euripides requires him to observe, πρόσεχε τὸν νου̑ν, 25 supra.
Euripides first bids him observe the wicket;
then he tells him to be silent.
Mnesilochus runs over in his mind these two points :
(1) I am to be silent ;
(2) the wicket.
Then Euri­ pides adds a third point;
he is to listen.
" Italic augetur Mnesilocho omnia re­ cordandi commemorandique labor :
vel sic tamen bene rationem tenet, neque ordinem rerum perturbat." (1) ἀκούω I am to listen ;
(2) καὶ σιωπω̑ and to be silent;
(3) τὸθύριον, the wicket.
The Scholiast has a different explanation .
This would give a very happy turn to the speech. " T am to be blind and deaf διὰ τὴν χοάνην, I am to be dumb διὰ TO θύριον."
But it is impossible to supply διά.31-33. γων]
These epithets are selected for the purpose of ridiculing the delicate and effeminate appearance of Agathon, who is described infra 191 as Whether there was any other Athenian of the name, to whom the epithets would apply, is very doubtful.
The Scholiast says, οἱ περὶ 'Αρίσταρχον καὶ μήτε μέλανα, του̑το εἶπεν.
Mnesilochus does not seem as much impressed as Euripides expected, by the celebrity of a Tragic Poet.
34.
ω̃στεκἀμέ γ'εἰδέναι]
Wishing to be very exact, he qualifies the strength of his original denial by adding ''
At least, if I did ever see him, I did not know who he was."
Of, Clouds 1252, Eccl. 350, Plato, Theaetetus, chap.
2. So in the Latin dramatists.
"Nunquam ante hunc them meis oculis eam, quod nossem, videram," Terence, Hecyra V. iv. 23. " (A) Non me novisti ? (B) quod quidem nunc veniat in mentem mihi," Plautus, Epidicus V. i. 32.
The vice imputed to Agathon in the next line is again sug­ gested infra 50, 200-207 and elsewhere.
Plato (Protagoras, chap.
7) implies that he was the παιδικὰ of Pausanias ;
whilst Aelian (V. H. ii. 21, xiii.
4) speaks of Euripides as being also his lover.
And Plato's own epigram on Agathon is not altogether pleasant reading.37.
πυ̑ρ καὶ μυρρίνας]
The θύριον now opens, and Agathon's servant comes out.
He brings with him a pan of live coals, and some myrtle branches, and is therefore obviously about to offer up a solemn prayer or sacrifice.
In the Wasps (860) fire, myrtles, and incense are mentioned as the concomitants of prayer:
in the Frogs (871) fire and incense:
and here, fire and myrtles.
And cf. Birds 43. Wreaths and decora. tions of the myrtle's sacred tress" (μυρσίνας ἱερὰνφόβαν, as Euripides calls it, Ion 120) were commonly used in divine worship.
Pollux i. segm. 27, 28.
And suppliants carried myrtle in their hands when they approached the altar of the gods.
Thus, when Alcestis was praying to the gods for her husband and children, we are told Eur. Ale. 170-172.
It was in religious decorations of this kind that Harmodius and Aristogeiton concealed their " swords in myrtle dressed."
See Ilgen's Scolia, p. 62.39. εὔφημος K.T.X.]
The servant now commences his recitative, which, though singularly melodious, is somewhat dreamy and affected, and doubtless reproduced, in a manner which we have now no means of tracing, some peculiarities of his master's style.
He calls on all Nature to be still, whilst Agathon is engaged in the arduous task of fashioning his delicately moulded odes.
Of these a specimen will be given presently ;
infra 101-129.
The language is calculated, if not designed, to recall Alcman's well-known description of a sleeping world, of which (as I do not remember having seen it in English) I venture to append not only the original, but also a free translation.
Now sleep the mountain summits ;
cleft and rill Sleep, and are still ;
Sleep the wild creatures, all the countless breeds
That dark earth feeds ;
The bees are slumbering ;
in the noiseless deep
The fishes sleep;
And long-winged birds their drowsy pinions close
In hushed repose.
The statement here that an inspired band of Muses is composing the odes means of course exactly the same thing as the statement below that Agathon himself is composing them.43. νήνεμ
ος αἰθήρ]
This Homeric phrase (Iliad viii. 552, the breathless hush of the air.—Way) is found, slightly altered, in Birds 778.
Lucian's σι̑γα μὲν αἰθὴρ νήνεμ
ος ἔστω(Tragopodagra 129) is doubt­ less a mere reminiscence of the present passage.
Compare the expression νηνε­ μίαν ἀνέμων in Agathon's peroration in the Symposium of Plato (chap. xix), a peroration which elicited from Socrates an ironical compliment, answering to the καλλιεπὴς 'Αγάθων here, on the wondrous beauty of its diction, τὸ κάλλος τω̑ν ὀνομάτων καὶ ῥηματων.45. βαμβάξ]
The flow of soft words is interrupted by an ejaculation of de­ rision on the part of Mnesilochus, which corresponds very nearly to Mr. Bur­ chell's " Fudge " in the Vicar of Wake­ field.
It is employed in much the same way by Plautus ;
Pseudolus I. iii. 131.48. μὴ λυέσθων] not be unloosed, from sleep or stillness :
the very reverse of Homer's phrase, γυι̑α λέλυνται, of limbs relaxed by death or weariness.52.
δρυόχους] the stocks :
the frame­ work or scaffolding on which a ship is built in the dockyard :
κυρίως δρύοχοί εἰσιν of ἐντιθέμνοι πάτταλοι ναυπηγουμένης νεώς.—Scholiast.
Eustathius in his note on Odyssey xix.
574, partly cited by Brunck, is very clear and elaborate in his explanation of the word ;
δρύοχοι δὲ Some writers indeed, both ancient and modern, take the δρυόχ
ους themselves to be the ribs of the vessel.
Torr's " Ancient Ships," p. 39 note.
The question is too long to be discussed in a footnote, but I am satisfied that the explanation of Eustathius is the true one, and that the δρύοχοι were a frame­ work external to the ship.
And this is to some extent confirmed by the present passage.
Agathon merely sets or erects, τίθησι, the δρυόχους;
he bends and shapes, κάμπτει, the timber for the keel and ribs.
ἁψὶς signifies anything cir­ cular or curved, and is here applied to the curved ship-timber.
54. τορνεύει]
Of the seven verbs which follow, the first, and (in part) the second and third, carry on the ship-building metaphor.
(1) τορνεύει turns, as with a turner's lathe :
see Odyssey v. 249.
(2) κολλομελει̑, glues together melodies, probably a word coined by Aristophanes. (3) γνωμοτυπει̑, casts thoughts into the mould.
(4) ἀντονομάζει, employs one word for another, ὂνομα ἀντὶ.
ὀνόματος τίθησιν. — Scholiast. (5) κηροχυτει̑, pours like melting wax.
(6) γογγύλλει, rounds off:
see Peace 28 ;
and (7) χοανεύει, funnels, moulds.
The last two processes are, possibly, enumerated merely for the purpose of assisting the retort of Mnesilochus.
In a note on Horace A. P. 441 (et male tornatos incudi reddere versus), Bentley translates these lines as follows :
flectit autem novas veresuum curvaturas;
nunc tornat, nunc conglu­ tinat;
nunc sententias ponit, nunc anto­ nomasias;
nunc incerat, nunc rotundat, nunc conflat.
thius too, on Odyssey vii. 87, connects the word with τρίχες.
And if this is the true derivation, the word is, as it were, the converse of our common metaphor, the penthouse of the brow.
Mnesilochus borrows from the servant the words γογγύλλει, χοανεύει, and θριγ­ κοι̑ς, and gives them a different and perverted signification.
With him θριγκου̑ is equivalent to πρωκτου.
The words συγγογγυλίσας καὶ συστρέψας would recall to the audience a line (975) of the Lysistrata, acted in the preceding year;
and though he is embarrassed by having to employ words not cognate to his subject, "tamen apparet," says Bergler, "ad quid paratum se dicat Mnesilochus :
est autem id, quod eum Euripides dicebat antehac etiam com­ misisse in Agathonem supra 35."63. ἦ που]
Perhaps the most accurate rendering of these words is I guess that;
cf. Frogs 803, Plutus 832.
The ex­ pression is a favourite one with Euri­ pides, and occurs nowhere so frequently as in his " recent Helen."
See the notes on lines 6 and 14 supra.
In that Play it is found no less than four times, viz.
575, 600, 791, 1465.
It occurs twice in the Phoenissae, the Supplices, and the Troades, but in no other Play have I observed it more than once.
66. αὐτός] of himself, without.
being summoned, as in Lysistrata 1107, Plutus 965, and elsewhere.
At the close of this speech this servant re-enters the house of Agathon ;
and Euripides is again alone with Mnesilochus.79.
ἕδρα] a sitting.
This vacation, so to call it, would naturally be confined to the Νηστεία or day of fasting, and therefore there would be no reason to doubt the statement of Xenophon (Hell. V. ii. 29) that the Theban Council was sitting, whilst the women in the Cad­ meia were celebrating the Thesmo­ phoria.
even if the Theban Thesmo­ phoria were celebrated at the same time (which is not the fact) and under the same conditions (which is not probable) as the Athenian festival.
80. ἡ Μέση]
The Intermediate Day, the day between the Κάθοδος, or Descent into Hades, and the Καλλιγένεια, or fair new birth of the Resurrection Morning.
The details of the Thesmophoria are discussed at length in the Introduction, where also the scholium on the present passage will be found set out in full.87. ἐκ ταύτης] ἐπιβουλη̑ς, understood from ἐπιβεβουλεύκασι just above.
Mnesi­ lochus, knowing that his companion is the prince of tricksters (infra 94) with ten thousand shifts and artifices at his command (infra 927), does not doubt that he is provided with a scheme for evading the present difficulty ;
and consequently his question is not "Have you any scheme" but "
What is your scheme " for doing so ?94. ἡμέτερ
ος ὁ πυραμου̑ς]
Ours is the champion's cake.
Like Dionysus in Frogs 1214, he is for the moment identifying himself with the art, and the cause, of Euripides.
The phrase is repeated from Knights 277.
A πυραμου̑ς was a cake of which the principal ingredients were parched wheat and boiled honey, and which is specially known as the prize awarded to the man who in an all-night drinking­ bout, with all his companions asleep around him, kept awake till sunrise, like Socrates in the Symposium of Plato, or the doctor of tremendous paunch " in Thomson's Seasons.
A comic poet of the name of Callippus is known to us only by two lines which Athenaeus (xv. chap.
7) preserves from his Παν­ νυχὶς or "All-night Revel.
"Who keeps awake shall take the cake (τὸν πυραμοΰντα λήψεται)
And kiss whichever girl he pleases.
And that a kiss was a recognized prize, Athenaeus goes on to say, is shown by these lines of Eubulus.
O Ladies, dance the whole night through,
And keep with mirth and joyance due
The tenth-day of this child of mine.
And I'm prepared, with bounty free, To give the winner ribbons three, And apples five, and kisses nine.
95. ἐξέρχεται]
The same word is used of Agathon's servant, supra 36, but the master and servant do not make their exit in the same fashion.
Here by the operation of the machine called the ἐκκύκλημα, the front wall of Agathon's house slowly revolves outward as on a hinge, bringing with it a part of the interior, and discovering Agathon in his chamber, preparing to sing the lyrics which, as we have already been informed, he has just been engaged in composing.
Both the chamber and its occupant are arrayed in the softest and most luxurious style, and Mnesilochus affects to mistake the effeminate poet for the courtesan Cyrene, who is men­ tioned again in Frogs 1328.
Brunck thinks that Agathon here, like Euripides in the Acharnians, is in the upper story, where the women's apartments would be :
but considering the ease with which he hands articles to the actors on the stage, this seems to me very unlikely.
As a prelude to his songs, he gives out a little fantastical warble, which in the stage direction is called μινυρισμός ὁδαί.
—Scholiast.
The expression is in­ tended to signify both the finikin and the intricate character of the notes, by comparing them to the tiny and innumerable galleries in an ant-hill.
Pherecrates in the well-known passage preserved by Plutarch (De Musica, chap. xxx) describes as ἐκτραπέλους μυρμη­ κίας the musical novelties introduced by the celebrated Timotheus of Miletus ;
and Meineke, in his note on that fragment, refers to Aeliam (H. A. vi. 43), which, at all events, shows the idea which the ancients attached to the galleries in an ant-hill.101-129.
Agathon sings the lyrical dialogue which he has just composed.
It purports to be a dialogue between a Leader and a band of female wor­ shippers :
but both parts are sung by Agathon himself, and to insert " Agathon's Chorus" amongst the Dra­ matis Personae, as is universally done by modern editors, from Brunck and Bekker downwards, is really the height of absurdity.
ὁ 'Αγάθων, says the Scholiast, ὑποκριτικα μέλη τέως ποιει̑, (He means that we are listening not to a dramatic exhibition, but to a poet composing verses.) διὸ καὶ χορικὰ λέγει αὐτὸς πρὸς αυτὸν, ὡς χορικὰ δέ.
And indeed Aristophanes himself makes this perfectly clear.
The servant describes Agathon alone as coming forth to mould his strophes in the sun's warm rays, supra 66-69 ;
he alone is seen in the eccyclema, supra 96 ;
he alone μελω̜δει̑ν παρασκευάζεται, supra 99 ;
and when the conversation is over, he alone is wheeled in again, infra 265.
Still, the lyrics are in the form of a dialogue, and it being necessary for the convenience of the reader that the parts should be distinguished, I have inserted (in brackets) the appellations of ὑποκριτὴς and χορός.
It is not likely that the dialogue is actually borrowed from Agathon's works, but it is undoubtedly intended to convey an accurate idea of his style, which consisted of a series of pretty conceits, destitute alike of the heroic dignity of Aeschylus and of the argumentative subtlety of Euri­ pides.
The language has been much confused by transcribers, and it is impossible now to recover the original metrical system, which seems to have been mostly choriambic and trochaic.
A favourite line seems to have been one compounded of a paeon and a choriamb, δαίμονας ἔ|χει σεβίσαι (106), "Αρτεμιν ἀ|πειρολεχη̑(119), ἂρσενι βο|α̜̑ δοκίμω̜ (125).101-103. 'Ιερὰν.... βοα̜̑]
Receive, 0 darn­ sels, the torch holy to the netherworld Goddesses (τη̜̑ Δήμητρι καὶ τη̜̑ Κόρη̜.— Scholiast) and dance the Choral dance with the free song of your fatherland.
Lighted torches were carried in their festivals, because Demeter had sought for her child αἰθομένας δαίδας μετὰ χερσὶν ἔχουσα, Homeric Hymn, 48, 61. Cf. infra 280, 1151.
βοα̜̑, without which the words ξὺν ἐλευθέρα̜ πατρίδι are unintelligible, is Kuster's emendation for βοάν.
From the use of βοὴ here, and infra 125, to signify the choral song, we may surmise that this was a special usage of the word by Agathon.
Kuster would also change πατρίδι into πατρία̜, which would be probable enough if it were reading the language of Aristophanes, and not, in fact or in imitation, the language of Agathon.104-106.
τίνι ... σεβίσαι]
To which (that is, in honour of which) of the deities is this revel ?
Tell me now.
My mind is easily swayed to worship the deities, τοὐμὸν is equivalent to ἐγὼ, and εὐπίστως ἔχει to εὔπιστός εἰμι.
The speakers formed the Chorus of the Tragedy;
but whom they represented it is impossible to say.
Bothe's con­ jecture from lines 109, 110, that they were Trojan virgins, rests on a very insecure foundation :
whilst nothing can be more improbable than Fritzsche's notion that they were the θίασος Μουσω̑ν mentioned supra 41.
Although they are carrying the torches sacred to the Thesmophorian goddesses, they do not know whom they are to worship, and are quite willing to worship any deity ;
and they welcome with enthusiasm the information that Apollo and Artemis, with their mother Leto, and the Harp wherewith Apollo wakes the heavenly dance, are to be the objects of their immediate devotion.107-110.
ἂγε vvv ... γα̜̑]
Come then, O Muse, and bless the God who draws the golden bow, Phoebus, who walled the country's glades in the land of the River Simoeis ;
ο̑ςτὴν "Ιλιον ἐτείχισεν, as the Scholiast rightly explains it.
The ex­ pression τα̜̑ Σιμουντίδι γα̜̑ is employed to denote the Trojan land by Euripides, Hec. 641.
γύαλον too is frequently used by the same poet in the sense of a "hollow glade";
and is strangely similar to our west-country gully or goyal (see Mr. Blackmore's "Lorna Doone," chap. iii) and our north- country ghyll (see Wordsworth's "Idle Shepherd Boys ").
ὄλβιζε is Bentley's correction of the MS.
ὄπλιζε, and is unquestionably right.
Just below, the Chorus undertake ὀλβίζειν " Αρτεμιν ;
and the present injunction is literally obeyed infra 129, χαι̑ρ', ὄλβιε παι̑ Λατου̑ς.
It seems probable that the word ὄλβιος was a favourite one with Agathon.111-113.
χαι̑ρε ...προφέρων]
We greet , thee with our loveliest hymns, 0 Phoebus, who awardest the sacred guerdon in our fair musical celebrations.
Many however take γέρας προφέρων to mean, not award­ ing, but carrying off the prize.
Fritzsche, for example, explains it as signifying "
Apollinem cantorem in certaminibus musicis alios, qui cum ipso contendant, omnes vincere."
But this interpretation seems very improbable.114-116.
τὰν ... ᾽Αγροτέραν]
Sing too the Maiden in the oak-beciring mountains, the huntress Artemis.
For Artemis was queen both of the mountains and of the forest.
" Latona bare thee," says Catullus in his glyconic hymn to Diana, “Montium domina ut fores, Sylvarum­ que virentium," Carmen 34.
Cf. Eur. Troades 551.
ἡ ᾽Αγροτέρα was a common title of the goddess.
See Knights 660, Lys. 1262.117-119. ἕπομαι ... ἀπειρολεχεῆ]
I follow on with songs of praise, blessing the exalted child of Leto, the stainless virgin Artemis.
Compare with this the entrance-hymns of Hippolytus and the Chorus in the Hippolytus of Euripides.120-122.
Αατώ re ... Χαρίτων]
Sing too of Leto, and the smiting of the Asian lyre, keeping time with the dance of the Graces, the whirling dance rhythmical to the Phrygian style.
Leto, as usual, is mentioned after, and in subordination to, her divine children.
See Gladstone's " Homer and the Homeric Age," Olym­ pus, section 2.
The lyre is the heavenly lyre of Apollo, which awakens the songs and dances of the immortal gods ;
cf.
Birds 219 and the commencement of Pindar's first Pythian Ode.
κροῦμα is the regular word for the stroke of the plectrum on the chords of the lyre.
120.
᾽Ασιάδος] ᾽Ασιάδα τὴν κιθάραν λέγει. —Scholiast.
The lyre was so called because it was invented in Lydia, in the district specially known as "Asia."
The passages in which the name is mentioned are collected by Kuster. "
We should not hear with more delight the strains of the Asian lyre, ᾽Ασιάδος ψόφον κιθάρας,” say the Chorus in Eur. Cyclops 443, " than the news of the Cyclops' death."
᾽Εποιήθη δὲ, says Plu­ tarch, de Musica, chap. vi, καὶ τὸ σχῆμα τὸ ἐν ᾽Ασία εὑρῆσθαι.
And the Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius ii.
779, after observing that Lydia was formerly called “Asia,” adds καὶ ἡ κιθάρα ᾽Ασιὰς λέγεται, ἐπεὶ ἐν Λυδίᾳ πρῶτον εὑρέθη.
So Etymol.
Magn. s. vv. ᾽Ασιᾶτις, and ᾽Ασιάδος κρούματα.
Under the latter heading the author says, τῆς κιθάρας.
Οὕτως 'Αριστοφάνης εἶπε, παρῳδῶν τὸ ἐξ ᾽Ερεχθέως Εὐριπίδου.
There are indeed many reminiscences of Euripides in this lyrical dialogue, but they are, perhaps, more directly reminiscences of Agathon, who may himself have borrowed them from the elder Poet.121.
ποδὶ εὔρυθμα Φρυγίῳ] τῇ Φρυγίᾳ ἁρμονίᾳ ἡρμοσμένα. — Scholiast.
One would not have supposed the wild enthusiastic Phrygian mode or harmony, however fit for the dances of the Trojan women (Eur. Troades, 151, 545), to be suitable for the stately movement of the heavenly Graces.
The line may seem to lend some colour to Bothe's view, mentioned in the note on 104-106 supra, as to the composition of Agathon's Chorus.123-129.
σέβομαι ..
Λατοῦς]
I worship
Leto the queen, and the lyre the mother of hymns, with notable masculine song:
by which (that is, the lyre) and by means of our suddenly raised voices, light flashes from eyes divine.
For this cause magnify King Phoebus.
Hail to thee, Leto's blessed son.
The epithet ἄρσενι, whether bor­ rowed from Agathon or not (cf. Persius, vi. 4), is placed by Aristophanes in the maidens' song, to ridicule the effeminacy of Agathon and Agathon's poetry.
With these lines Agathon concludes his lyrics, and we know from the stage-directions that as he himself gave a little warble at the commencement, so Mnesilochus gives a squeal of pleasure at the end.
The expression ὀλολύζει 6 γέρων " signi­ ficat," as Kuster observes, Mnesilochum, audito cantico Agathonis, prae voluptate et laetitia clamorem edidisse.”
His expressions of delight are continued through the first four lines of his speech.
The strain is θηλυδριῶδες, soft, voluptuous, like Agathon himself :
and κατεγλωττισ­ μένον and μανδαλωτὸν, suggestive of lascivious kisses ;
Ach.
1201, Clouds 51.
The last of the four lines (“ podicem ipsum subierit titillatio.”—Kuster) may have been in Persius's mind when he wrote lines 20, 21 of his first Satire.
Of course, in the intention of Aristophanes, these compliments are part of the satire.
ὄνομα πεποιῆσθαι.—Scholiast.
Here we have Genetyllides in the plural :
in Clouds 52 and Lysist.
2, Genetyllis occurs in the singular, and the Scholiast on the Clouds says Γενετυλλὶς, ἡ τῆς γενέσεως ἔφορος ᾽Αροδίτη.
The line between the principal goddesses and their satellites was never very clearly drawn.
For the present purpose it is sufficient to know that the Genetyllides were amatory deities, specially wor­ shipped by women.
γύννις means a weak, womanish fellow ;
δειλὸς, ἄνανδρος, γυναικώδης, Hesychius ;
ἀνδρόγυνος, μαλακὸς, Suidas.
The story of Lycurgus, to which Diomed refers in the sixth Iliad, as a warrant for his resolve, “ Of a truth I will nowise fight with the Gods, the abiders on high" (Way), is told with considerable varia­ tions by Diodorus Siculus (iii. 65), Apollodorus (iii. 34), and Hyginus (Fab. 132).
He was King of the Edonians who dwelt by the River Strymon, and drove Dionysus and the Bacchae with insult from his dominions.
For this he was punished with madness ;
and under the delusion that he was hacking down vines, he slew his wife and son and (some said) himself.
But cf. Soph. Antigone 955.
In the scene to which Mnesilochus is referring, Lycurgus, like Pentheus in the "Bacchae," has arrested and is questioning Dionysus ;
and in all probability not line 136 only, but the remaining questions are taken, with comic additions and variations, from the Tragedy of Aeschylus.
And compare Frogs 47.
The Scholiast further tells us that Eubulus commenced the Comedy, which after the Sicilian tyrant of that name he called Dionysius, by a similar enumeration of incongruous articles to be seen in the tyrant's residence ;
κεκρύφαλιος, a woman's sash and hair-net, see the notes on 249 and 257 infra, where Agathon is asked to lend these articles to Mnesilochus.
And as to the Λακωνικαὶ, the red Laconian shoes (ἀνδρεῖα ὑποδήματα.—Scholiast), see Wasps 1158, Eccl. 345 and the notes there.
We have seen in the note on Eccl.
537 that λήκυθοι, oil bottles, were in constant request by an Athenian, " in his house, at the bath, in the gymnasium, and even on the battlefield," and from the λήκυθ
ος being here contrasted with a woman's sash, we may infer that its use, during life, was practically confined to males.
With line 140 Bergler compares a line of Epicharmus, τίς yap κατόπτρῳ καὶ τυφλῷ κοινωνία ;
Stobacus, Flor. xc. 8, which Aristophanes seems here to be parodying.147.
τὴν ἄλγησιν K.T.X.] οὐκ ἐλυπήθην.— Scholiast. ';
dolorem nullum ostendi.”— Bergler.
In the following line ἅμα γνώγῃ means of set purpose.
Bergler says " consulto.
Idem est quod ξὺν νῷ, Nub. 580, et ἅμα ante γνώμῃ ponitur pro σὺν, ne fiat confusio cum συγγνώμῃ.”
This is better than the interpretation of Bourdin and Enger, ἁρμόττουσαν τῇ γνώμῃ.151.
αὐτίκα] for example ;
as in Wasps 1190, Birds 166, 378, 483, 574, 786, and 1000, Plutus 130.
For its frequent occurrence, in this sense, in Plato, see Ruhnken's Timaeus, s.v. γυναικεῖα
δρά­ para λέγεται, says the Scholiast, ἐν οἷς ὁ χορὸς ἐκ γυναικῶν ἐστὶν, ἀνδρεῖα δὲ ἐν οἷς ἐξ ἀνδρῶν.
The drama therefore on which Agathon was engaged, justified his adoption of womanly habiliments.
153.
Φαίδραν]
This, and the next, ob­ servation of Mnesilochus, appear to be addressed, aside, to Euripides.
Aga­ thon takes no notice of them, nor is there any known Play of his to which they would seem to be applicable.
On the other hand, the " Hippolytus " of Euripides was called the "Phaedra";
and is so named in the great Florentine MS. of Euripides (Valckenaer, Diatribe, p. 16) ;
whilst the Satyrs form the Chorus of the " Cyclops," and doubtless of other Plays of Euripides.
As to κελητίζειν, see Wasps 501, and the note there.155.
ὑπάρχον] that is, by nature.
The translation gives a different turn to the sentence.159.
ἄμουσον] out of harmony, incon­ gruous.
161. ῎Ιβυκος Κ. Τ. λ.]
These three Poets- Ibycus of Rhegium, Anacreon of Teos, and Alcaeus of Mitylene—are selected as the three most notable authors of the worst kind of erotic poetry.
Two of them are coupled in the same way in the line cited by Athenaeus xv. 49 from our poet's "Banqueters ”῎ᾼσον δή μοι σκολιόν τι λαβὼν ᾽Αλκαίον ΚΑνακρέοντος.
And all three are grouped together for precisely the same reason in a passage of the Tusculan Disputations to which Dr. Blaydes refers.
The Roman orator is in­ veighing against the dissolute poetry of the Greeks. " Who knows not," says he, "quae de iuvenum amore scribit Alcaeus ?
Nam Anacreontis quidem tota poesis est amatoria.
Maxime vero om­ nium flagrasse amore Rheginum Ibycum apparet ex scriptis.
Atque horum om­ nium libidinosos esse amores videmus " (iv. 33).
The Scholiast here intervenes with great effect in a difference of opinion which existed between the grammarians Aristophanes and Didy­ mus about the reading ᾽Αλκαῖος.
"In some copies," says he, " the name is written ᾽Αχαιὸς, and the older copies had it so.
And Aristophanes it was who changed it to ᾽Αλκαῖος.
For they are talking of old authors, but Achaeus was of later date."
(He was eleven years younger than (Sophocles.)
"And the argument of Didymus that they could not be referring to Alcaeus, since his writings, owing to their dialect, were not familiar to the public, is sheer nonsense ;
for Alcaeus is parodied both in the Wasps (1232) and in the Birds (1410).
And elsewhere Didymus says that the name Alcaeus may stand ;
only they are not referring to the lyric Poet (repeating the old argument about his poetry being unfamiliar), but to a harper whom Eupolis mentions in his Golden Age.'
But what have we to do with a harper here, when the talk is of Poets ?”162. ἐχύμισαν] ἔγχυμον ἐποίησαν.—
Scho­ liast.
Rendered soft and succulent;
from χυμὸς, the juice or liquid subsisting in animal or vegetable bodies.163.
τε καὶ διεκινοῦνθ᾽ ὧδέ πως ]
The MSS.
and some early editions read τε καὶ διεκίνωνV ᾽Ιωνικῶς, the others having τε καὶ διεκίνουν ᾽Ιωνικῶς.
And so Harpocration s. v. ᾽Ιωνικῶς.
for which Vales in his note there proposed διεκινοῖντ᾽, a sug­ gestion approved by both Kuster and Bergler, though both retain διεκίνουν in the text.
But all these readings give a syllable too many to the line.
Nor can it be set right by the omission of the enclitic τε, since κινέω, as Toup pointed out, always has the first syl­ lable long.
Commentators have conse­ quently made every effort to discover a metrical substitute for διεκίνουν.
Of the words suggested, Toup's διεκλῶντ᾽ has been the most generally accepted ;
though Fritzsche᾽s κἀχλίδων has also received some little support.
But διε­ κλῶντο introduces a stronger element than we should expect to find coupled with ἐμιτροφόρουν, and on the lips of Agathon ;
whilst κἀχλίων bears little re­ semblance to the MS.
reading.
And for my own part, I cannot bring myself to doubt that Aristophanes wrote διεκι­ νοῦντ᾽, or rather διεκινοῦνθ᾽ and that the error should be sought in the adverb, and not in the verb.
It seems to me that ᾽Ιωνικῶς sprang from a misreading of θ᾽ ὧδέ πως, and being very pat to the meaning, though in no way necessary (the idea being already implied in ἐμι­ τροφόρουν), has ever since maintained its usurped position without exciting suspicion.
The words διεκινοῦνθ᾽ ὧδέ πως correspond very closely to the ὡδὶ διαβὰς, διακινηθεὶς τῷ σώματι of Wasps 688 ;
and compare Peace 35 τὼ χεῖρέ πως ὡδὶ περιάγων.
Agathon here, as Bdelycleon in the Wasps, is giving a specimen of the motus Ionicos (Horace, Ode III. vi. 21).
Nothing is more com­ mon in Aristophanes than for a speaker thus to illustrate his words.
To the passages cited in the note to Wasps 1526 add Knights 21, Peace 36, Frogs 1029.164.
τοῦτον ...ἀκήκοας] ἐπεὶ Αθηναῖος ἦν.—Scholiast.
Moreover lie was later in date than any of the lyric poets just mentioned, and was certainly exhibit­ ing tiagedies after the birth of Euri­ pides.168.
φιλοκλέης...Ξενοκλέης ... Θέογνις]
Mnesilochus avails himself of the prin­ ciple which Agathon lays down, viz. that there must needs be some resem­ blance between a Poet and his poetry, to criticize three sorry Tragedians who were always obnoxious to Aristophanes.
We have met with all three before.
Philocles, the nephew of Aeschylus, is mentioned in Wasps 462 (where see the note) as the waspish composer of waspish tragedies.
And in the closing scene of the same play, Xenocles, the most dwarfish of the sons of Carcinus, is introduced upon the stage, to dance the extravagant new dances of the period in opposition to the old-fash­ ioned Tragic dances of Thespis and Phryniehus.
In Frogs 86 the mere mention of his name elicits from Diony­ sus the ejaculation ἐξόλοιτο νὴ Αία.
And see infra 440.
Yet Philoeles carried off the prize from Sophocles when the latter exhibited his Oedipus Tyrannus ;
and Xenocles from Euripides when the latter competed with his Troades.
The epithet ψυχρὸς, cold (that is dull, with­ out a vivifying spark of life or genius), belonged as of right to Theognis, who from his excessive ψυχρότης had ac­ quired the nickname of Χιὼν, Snow :
see the Scholiast on Ach.
11. In Ach. 140 it is noticed as a curious coincidence that whilst the Athenian ambassadors were detained in Thrace by frost and snow, the Athenian stage was occupied by the tragedies of Theognis.
There was a Theognis among the Thirty Tyrants ;
and the Scholiast on Ach.
11, who is copied by Suidas, asserts that the Poet and the Tyrant were one and the same person.
The ψυχρότης of Theognis is immortalized by the jest of Aristophanes ;
the ψυχρότης of Di­ philus, a later dramatist, is immor­ talized by a jest of the witty and dissolute Gnathaena :
— Quoth Diphilus "
Upon my word, Gnathaena’s wine is cold as snow.”
“Why yes,” Gnathaena says, “ we poured Your dramas in, to make it so."
Machon apud Athen. xiii. cap. 43.
Or rather “we pour” ;
we are in the habit of doing so:
it is a recipe we have.
172. ἐμαυτὸν ἐθεράπευσα] got myself up with careful treatment.
He is refer­ ring to his womanly equipment and appearance, so concluding the argu­ ment which he commenced supra 148.
θεραπεύω however is also a medical term, and Mnesilochus chooses to inter­ pret it of Agathon's womanly practice and inquires what method he follows.
But by this time the patience of Euri­ pides is exhausted :
he thinks that Mnesilochus has already monopolized the conversation too long ;
and accord­ ingly bids him stop that yapping,” and allow him to unfold the errand of life or death which has brought him to Agathon's door.
177, 178. ’Αγάθων ... λόγους]
These two lines are, as Bergler points out.
borrowed from the Aeolus of Euripides, except that ’Αγάθων is here substituted for the Παῖδες there :
see Stobaeus.
Flor. xxxv. 3. With the succeeding line the same commentator compares Alcestis 856, καίπερ βαρείᾳ συμφορᾷ πε­ πληγμένος.190.
πολιός] γέρων γὰρ τότε ὁ Εὐριπί­ δης ἦν.—Scholiast.
At the date of this Comedy he was about seventy years old;
ἐλέγετο δὲ καὶ βαθὺν πώγωνα
θρέψαι, says the author of the Greek Life of Euri­ pides (first printed by Elmsley in his edition of the Bacchae), to which Fritzsche refers.
194.
χαίρεις ὁρῶν φῶς κ.τ.λ.] ἐξ ’Αλκή­ στιδος Εὐριπίδου (691).
—Scholiast.
The question is put by Pheres to his son Admetus, who expects his father to die as a substitute for himself.
Aristo­ phanes had already parodied the line in Clouds 1415.
There is probably a considerable Euripidean element in Agathon's next speech.199. φέρειν]
This word, though apt with παθήμασιν (ferre patiendo), is hardly suitable with τεχνάσμασιν.
For φέρειν τεχνάσμασιν must here be taken to mean " to endeavour to escape troubles by artful dodges, to meet them with artifices," as Euripides is now doing.201.
παθήμασιν]
“Hic iam alia παθή­ ματα intelliguntur;
nempe unde Pathici dicuntur.”—Bergler.205. κλέπτειν]
Euripides will be de­ tected as being a man ;
Agathon will be suspected as coming to play a woman’s part, and to steal away, by attracting to himself, the love which the women would otherwise enjoy.
The phrase ὑφαρπάζειν θήλειαν Κύπριν re­ appears in a slightly altered form in Eccl.
722 τὴν τῶν ἐλευθέρων ὑφαρπάζειν Κύπριν, and is probably a quotation from, or parody of, some tragic pas­ sage.
Mnesilochus, in the next line, scorns the euphemistic κλέπτειν, and in­ sists on calling a spade a spade :
nay rather say βινεῖσθαι.209.
ἀπόλωλ’ Εὐριπίδης]
We have already, supra 77, been told that this day is to decide εἴτ’ ἔστ’ ἔτι ζῶν, εἴτ’ ἀπόλωλ’ Εὐριπίδης.
Agathon's refusal is decisive in favour of the latter alterna­ tive ;
and so ἀπόλωλ’ Εὐριπίδης.210. μὴ σαυτὸν προδῷς]
Do not fail yourself in this crisis ;
do not give your­ self away ;
to your own self be true.

The first step in the process of converting Mnesilochus into a woman is to get rid of the tell-tale hair on his face and limbs;
the face is to be shaven, and the limbs are to be singed.
The idea of this depilation scene seems to have been borrowed from a Play of Cratinus called by the Scholiast the ’Ιδαῖοι, and by Clemens Alexandrinus (Stromata VI. ii. 26) the ’Εμπιπράμενοι, for doubtless, as Dindorf observes, these are two names of the same Play.
And Bergk conjectures that the Chorus con­ sisted of Idaean Dactyls, who, it is likely enough, smoothed their bodies and singed off their superfluous hair, as the effeminate ministers of the Phry­ gian Cybele.

He has already been described as ἐξυρη­ μένος, supra 191.220.
γενναῖος εἶ]
These words are a re­ cognition of Agathon's liberality in allowing them the use of his razor.
Cf. Frogs 179.
The succeeding line is ad­ dressed to Mnesilochus, who accord­ ingly takes his seat, so to say, in the barber’s chair, and blows the swoll'n cheek of a trumpeter."
However the operation has hardly commenced when he utters a piercing shriek, as if the razor had gashed his skin.222.
πάτταλον]
I will clap a gag in your mouth, says Euripides, if you don't keep silence.
Cf. Knights 375, 376. But a second gash follows, and Mnesilochus springs from his chair.224.

"Ad Eu­ menidum fanum;

Like the insulted triremes in Knights 1312, he will take refuge in the most sacrosanct and inviolable asylum in Athens, the Temple of the Erinyes, erected over the fissure still visible in the rock of Areopagus, through which the dread Goddesses, after their reconciliation with Athene, were be­ lieved to have descended to their ap­ pointed habitation.
See the closing scene of the Eumenides, and Euripides, Electra 1270-3.
The next line (225) is repeated with a slight variation from Wasps 1442.227.
τὴν ἡμίκραιραν] τὸ ἥμιον τῆς κεφα­ λῆς.—Suidas. τὴν μίαν κομῶν γνάθον, τὴν έτέραν ἐψιλωμένος.—Scholiast. " Nonne ridiculus eris semiraso capite ?
”—Brunck.
The appeal of Euripides prevails, and after this little outbreak Mnesilochus, with the words κακοδαίμων ἐγὼ, reluc­ tantly resumes his seat.
230. ἀνάκυπτε]
He is to lean back, and elevate his chin, so that Euripides may more easily shave off the hair under­ neath it.232.
ψιλὸς στρατεύσομαι]
I shall enter upon my campaign as a, ψιλὸς, with a play on the double meaning of ψιλὸς, a light-armed soldier and a man smooth- shaven.
The shaving is over, and Euripides hands the victim a mirror (κάτοπτρον must be understood after φέρε in line 234), that he may see how pretty (εὐπρεπὴς) he has become.
However when he looks into the mirror, he seems to behold not the manly old Mnesilochus, but Cleisthenes, the most effeminate of Athenians, and the constant butt of Athenian Comedy.
Cleisthenes is him­ self introduced on the stage infra 574, and in almost his first words calls attention to his smoothly shaven cheeks.236.
ἀφεύσω]
Now the singeing is to begin, and Mnesilochus has to stand up, and be singed fore and aft :
tirst in front, and then behind.237. δελφάκιον] a sucking-pig. ὗς, ἡ πρώην ἐπίτεξ εἶναι νομιζομένη, says a letter- writer in Alciphron iii. 73, ἀρτίως τέτοκε, καὶ ἔχω δελφάκων ἀφθονίαν.
γρὐζουσι δὲ μάλ’ ἀηδὲς, ἀλλ’ ἐδώδιμ
ον.
These sucking- pigs were much used in sacrifices, and it was customary to remove their bristles from the hide by singeing;
μετὰ γὰρ τὸ τυθη̃ναι τὰ δελφάκια φλογίζονται, ἵνα ψιλω­ θῶσιν.
—Scholiast.
Mnesilochus thinks that he will resemble one of these singed sucking-pigs;
and Euripides.
perhaps, carries on the idea in the reference tO his tail, κέρκος, in the next lino but one :
though κέρκος there, of course, involves the double signification which is found in Ach. 785-7 ;
Horace, Sat. 1. ii. 45 ;
and elsewhere.245.
ἀσβόλου] ἄσβολος καλεῖται ἡ αἰθάλη (sooty smoke) τοῦ πυρός. τράμις δὲ o πρωκτός.
Scholiast.
Here ἄσβολος signi­ ties the fumes arising from the singed hair.
The resentment which Mnesilochus exhibits, two lines below, at the idea of being sponged, arises from that use of the sponge which is mentioned in Frogs 487-90.249.
’Αγάθων κ.τ.λ.]
The person of Mnesilochus, being now smoothed and denuded of hair, has next to be attired in female clothing.
They know that Agathon can supply them with this, since he himself, as we have already seen, is partly equipped as a woman.
The costume of men, and the costume of women, were in many respects widely different, but the ground-work of both was the same.
Each consisted of two main articles of apparel, (1) a χιτὼν, tunic, or body-robe, which was put on (ἐνδύου, infra 253), and covering the shoulders, reached, in the case of women, to the feet;
and (2) an ἱμάτιον, or outer mantle, loosely thrown over one shoulder, and drawn underneath the other.
The χιτὼν was an ἔνδυμα, the ἱμάτιον was a περίβλημα.
Here the body- robe is called κροκωτὸς, and the outer mantle ἔγκυκλον, very common names in women's costume ;
the former from its yellow colour, the latter, probably, from its rounded shape.
See the notes on Eccl. 318, 333, and 536.
The στρόφιον was the sash or girdle which tied in the κροκωτὸς underneath the paps.
Agathon has also to furnish a net and hair-band for the head, and a pair of women's slippers for the feet, and the toilet is complete.
It must be remembered that he is at this moment attired in a κροκωτὸς, a στρόφιον, a κεκρύφαλος, and women's slippers, supra 138-42.
The arrangement of the speeches during the toilet scene is very uncertain, but it seems that Agathon points out the various articles;
Euri­ pides takes them and dresses Mnesilo­ chus, whilst the latter, after the painful experiences of the shaving and singeing operations, cannot conceal his delight at finding himself arrayed in these soft and comfortable garments.
250.
τουτῳί]
For the use of Mnesilo­ chus.
Enger well observes, "non sine causa hic τουτῳὶ addi, quod oppositum sit illis ἐπειδὴ σαυτὸν ἐπιδοῦναι φθονεῖς quoniam ipse te mihi invides, at saltem hie ut mihi operam possit praestare, mihi commoda vestem.”
ἱμάτιον is here used in the general sense of " a garment," and not in the special sense mentioned in the preceding note.252.
οὐ φθονῶ]
If Euripides had ex­ hibited the Madness of Heracles" shortly before the date of this Comedy, as is generally supposed, Aristophanes may be referring to the line in that Play (333) which Bergler cites, Κοσμεῖσθ’ ἔσω μολόντες οὐ φθονῶ πέπλων.
In the following line ἐνδύου can be addressed only to the person about to wear the apparel, and Bentley and others would therefore transfer the words τί οὖν λάβω;
to Mnesilochus.254.
ποσθίου] δέον εἰπεῖν μύρ
ου, fiVe ποσθίου. πόσθιον δέ ἐστι τὸ αἰδοῖον τοῦ ἀνδρός.
—Scholiast,
Being a woman's dress it would naturally smell of some fragrant perfumes, but inasmuch as it has been worn by a man, Mnesilochus substitutes παρὰ προσδοκίαν this ob­ jectionable word.257. κεκρυφάλου καὶ μίτρας] a woman's cap and snood.
This was the head-dress of Andromache, which Homer describes as κεκρύφαλόν τ'ἠδὲ πλεκτὴν ἀναδέσμην II.
xxii. 469.
The κεκρύφαλος was a cap for confining the hair, and was doubtless made in divers shapes and of divers materials.
Sometimes it was a plain kerchief (κεκρύφαλον' σουδάριον.—Pho­ tius), such as the Arnaut women still wear upon their heads.
—Dodwell, i. 141.
Sometimes it was a net, such as is shown on Pompeian frescoes, " a net­ work which confined, and more or less concealed the hair." — Gladstone's Homeric Synchronism, p. 50.
Its func­ tions are briefly described in an Epigram which appears in a double form in the Anthology (Antipater Sidonius 21 ;
Archias 5).
In that epigram five sisters are bringing gifts to the Heavenly Aphrodite, and one of them, Philaenis by name, offers a κεκρύφαλος.
In the first version it is said, And in the second, μίτρα means simply a band.
As a part of the headgear it was probably a ribbon tying the κεκρύφαλος, and curbing the too luxuriant tresses.
Catullus, describing the reckless grief of the deserted Ariadne, as she watched the receding ship which was carrying from her the faithless
Theseus, says that she looked like a frenzied Maenad, non flavo retinens subtilem vertice mitram, Non tereti stro­ phio luctantes vincta papillas, lxiv.
63. The use of the μίτρα as a hair-band seems to have commenced amongst the Asiatics (Hdt. i. 195, vii. 62, 90 ;
cf. Eur. Hec. 924, Bacchae 833), amongst whom it was common to men and women ;
but amongst the Hellenes in Europe its use by a man was accounted an act of the grossest effeminacy.
See supra 163. " I should be ashamed, Zeus," says Hera, speaking of Dionysus, " to have a son so effeminate and drunken, whose hair is bound up with a mitra," μίτρᾳ ἀναδεδεμένος τὴν κόμην, Lucian xviiith.
Dialogue of the Gods.258.
κεφαλὴ περίθετος] a hood or coif;
literally a put-on head ;
a strange name for a woman's head-dress, but one which is recognized, as Kuster observes, by both Pollux (ii. segm. 35) and Eustathius (at II. xxii. 470) ;
the latter writer calling it κόσμος γυναικεῖος "an article of womanly adornment," and expressing τῆς ἀναδέμης.
Here it is plain that Agathon offers it, and Euripides receives it, as a substitute for both κεκρύφαλος and ἀναδέσμη.
It was doubtless a hood, fitting close to, and so assuming the shape of, its wearer's head, whence it itself obtained the name of κεφαλή.
And, being something like the nightcaps which English ladies used to wear, it was quite capable of doing duty for both κεκρύφαλος and μίτρα.
And this is the meaning, as Hermann and Enger perceived, of the Scholium, πάντα ἒχουσα τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐν ἐαυτῇ,261.
ἀπὸ τῆς κλινίδος] from the couch whereon it was lying.
The form κλινὶς is employed to illustrate the effeminacy of Agathon, since it was specially appro­ priated to the luxurious carriage-seat which a newly-married bride occupied between the bridegroom and the grooms­ man.
κλινίς ἐπὶ τῆς ἀμάξης νυμφικὴ καθέδρα.—Hesychius.
οὐ μέντοι άγνοῶ, says Pollux, x. segm. 33, ὂτι κλινὶς έκα-262. τἀμὰ ταυτί]
He takes the slippers off his own feet, and hands them to Euripides.
Mnesilochus, a larger man than Agathon, doubts if he can get his own feet into them ;
and when he finds that he can, he says to Agathon, " Why then you like to wear loose shoes."
The Scholiast says, διαβάλλει πάλιν τὸν 'Αγάθωνα ὠς χαῦνον.
Agathon's part is now over, and he calls upon the μηχανο­ ποιὸν (Peace 174) to wheel him back again.
Apparently he has not left his chamber throughout the foregoing scene.
His house is now closed up, and we hear no more of him in the present Play.267.
ἦν λαλῇς]
In appearance and equipment Mnesilochus is now trans­ formed into a woman ;
but he must also " make liquid treble of that bassoon, his throat" ;
and doubtless he utters the word πειράσομαι in a "monstrous little voice," to imitate the tone of a woman.
272. ὂμνυμι τοίνυν]
This line is quoted from the Melanippe sapiens (see the note on line 14 above), except that Aristophanes substitutes τοίνυν for the δ' ἰερὸν of the original.
See Frogs 100 and the note there.
Mnesilochus does not see the sense of swearing by a dwelling-place, and thinks that Euri­ pides might as well swear by the lodgings in which Hippocrates and his swinish brood (of whom we have heard in Clouds 1001) are herding together.
Euripides, to satisfy him, proceeds to swear by all the gods in a lump.
ἂρδη> is a metaphor from the act of dragging up something by the very roots, so as to leave nothing behind ;
and ἂρδην πάντες, therefore, both here and in Phoenissae, 1146 (to which Dr. Blaydes refers), means all without exception or reserva­ tion.
With this wholesale swearing Bergler compares Medea, 746-52, where the heroine calls upon Aegeus to swear by " the Earth, the Sun, εῶν τε ... ἂπαν γένος."
The terms of the oath are now satisfactory;
but Mnesilochus, mindful of the famous line in the Hippolytus, ἠ γλῶσσ' ὀμὠμοκ' ἠ δὲ φρὴν ἀνώμοτος (as to which see Frogs 1471 and the note there), wishes to be sure that in this case the oath goes deeper than the tongue, and is binding upon the con­ science.
The words οὐδ' ὢρκωσ' ἐγὼ mean nor did I so put the oath.
It was not to your tongue only that I ad­ ministered it.277.
ἒκσπευδε ταχέως]
The παρεπιγραφὴ or stage-direction which immediately precedes these words indicates an entire change of scene ;
the Thesmophorium, or temple of Demeter and Persephone, being thrust out upon the stage, while the Chorus are crowding into the orchestra with lighted torches and loud religious cries, but without any formal entrance-song.
The change was effected by means of the ἐξώστρα, machinery considered by some grammarians, but wrongly, to be identical with the ἐκκὐ­ κλημα.
Indeed, even here, the Scholiast says παρεπιγραφή ἐκκυκλεῖται ἐπὶ TO ἒξω τὸ εσμοφόριον.
The ἐκκύκλημα had a circular movement on a pivot (περιστρέ­ φεται.—Scholiast Ach. 408 ;
Suidas), the front wall of the house opening like a door, and disclosing, and bringing out with itself, the interior chambers.
There was no περιστροφὴ with the ἐξώστρα, nor any disclosure of what was taking place within ;
it simply pushed something straight out upon the stage.
Nor was it so temporary an expedient as the ἐκκύκλημα, which merely disclosed the interior, without otherwise inter­ rupting the scene.
The ἐξώστρα created a new scene, which might continue, and in the present case apparently did con­ tinue, to the very end of the Play;
whilst in the Peace it continued from 173 to 729, the commencement of the Para basis.
The temple, so brought forward, has on it a σημεῖον, probably a pole or standard of some sort, to signify that an ἐκκλησία is about to commence, ὂτε ἒμελλε γίνεσθαι ἐκκλησία, says the Scholiast, ημεῖον ἐτίθετο. οὒτως οὖν, καὶ τῶν γυναικῶν μελλουσῶν ἐκκλησιά­ ζειν, σημεῖον τίθεται.
See Wasps 690 and the note there.
Though Mnesilochus does not really leave the stage, yet, as the scene suddenly changes from Aga­ thon's house to the temple, he must be imagined to pass from the one to the other, and hence the exhortation ἒκ­ σπευδε.
Euripides now makes off, and Mnesilochus, gathering his woman's dress about him, begins to speak in a fussy way, and with a woman's voice (μιμεῖται τὴν φωνὴν γυναικός.—Scholiast) to an imaginary servant-girl.281.
ὂσον τὸ χρῆμ.']
These words are usually accompanied by a genitive, TO χρῆμα τῶν νυκτῶν (or τῶν κόπων, or παρνό­ πων, or otherwise) ὂσον.
But here and in Peace 1192 they stand alone, and in each passage mean
What a crowd of people.
He uses the compound ἀνέρ­ χεται, because the worshippers had to ascend to the Thesmophorium.
which stood on elevated ground.
See 585 infra and the note there.
They have flaming torches in their hands, and the fiery vapour (λιγνις, a word used thrice only in these Comedies, once in each of three successive Plays, the Birds, the Lysistrata, and the Thesmophoriazusae) keeps rising from these torches and flaring and flickering over their heads.288. θύειν ἒχουσαν]
These words are probably to be taken together, to keep on sacrificing;
a meaning more com­ monly associated with the singular masculine, Clouds 509;
Birds 341 ;
Lys. 945 ;
Frogs 202, 512, 524 ;
Eccl. 853, 1151.
This seems a more probable con­ struction than to connect ἒχουσαν with ρολλὰ in the preceding line.
The infini­ tives are governed by δότε understood.
289.
Χορίον]
He prays for his boy and girl, just as Alcestis on her death- bed is represented as praying for hers.
Only the children for whom Mnesi­ lochus prays are merely the offspring of his own imagination.
He gives them names to signify their sex.
The girl is Χοιρίον from χοῖρος in the sense of the γυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον ;
and the boy Ποσθάληκος (like πόσθων in Peace 1300) from πόσθη (Clouds 1014) or πόσθιον (supra 254, infra 515).
On the girl's name the Scholiast remarks, ὠς τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτοῖ κατ ἐπίκλησιν οὒτω καλουμένης, οἶον Βοἶδιον, ἦ Χρυσιον, ἦ Μυρτίον (all pet names, the last being the equivalent of Χοιρίον).
For her, he prays that she may become the wife of a wealthy husband, not over­ burdened with brains, and so easily outwitted ;
ἀναισθήτου καὶ μωροῦ, says the Scholiast, ἲνα κρατῇ αὐτοῦ.
In the long passage cited by Athenaeus (vi. chap. 30, 236 f) from the Κόλακες of Eupolis (to which Bergler also refers) the chorus of Flatterers say, ἐπειδὰν­ κατίδω τιν' ἂνδρα I ἠλίθιον, πλουτοῦντα δ', εὐθὺς περὶ τοῦτον εἰμί.
For the son, he prays that he may develop into a wise and understanding man, νοῦν exopTa καὶ φρένας.
See Frogs 534, and infra 462.292.
ὲν καλῷ κ.τ.λ.] a good place for hearing the speeches.
The prayer is over and he is again the fussy Athenian matron.294.
δούλοις]
Doubtless none but free­ born women (εὺγενεῐς γυναῐκες, infra 330, ὃσαι πάρεσμεν ὰσταὶ, infra 541) could take part in the actual deliberations, but it seems that servants were allowed to accompany their mistresses into the precinets.
See infra 537, and the next note.
Mnesilochus, however, is speaking to an imaginary Thratta, and gets rid of her by this excuse.
295.
KHPYKAINA]
Now the women's ὲκκλησία begins.
The prayers and invo­ cations which follow, consisting of two exhortations by the Crieress, and two responsive hymns by the Chorus, are modelled on the preliminaries of an Athenian ὲκκλησία, but are varied by allusions to the Thesmophorian worship, and still more by alterations conse­ quent on the sex of the ecclesiasts.
Throughout the ensuing scenes there are never more than three speakers on the stage at once (1) Mnesilochus, the Crieress, and the First Woman ;
(2) Mnesilochus and the two Women ;
(3) Mnesilochus and the First Woman ;
(4) Mnesilochus, the First Woman, and Cleisthenes;
(5) Mnesilochus and the First Woman ;
(6) Mnesilochus and the First and Third Women ;
and (7) Mnesilochus and the Third Woman.
But there were many mute personages, the δουλάρια of 537, the nurse of 609, the τάσδε of 726, and the Mania of 728 and 754.
And of course the Chorus in the orchestra form part of the body of worshippers.
This bidding-prayer is in prose, but in the MSS.
and in all the older editions it is arranged in lines of unequal length ;
an arrangement re­ tained by both Fritzsche and Enger, and one which renders the proclamation so much more distinct and impressive, that I have not hesitated to follow their example.
The Scholiast says—πεζῇ εὺ­ (Birds 865-88) ἢ Φισμα (Birds 1035 seqq. and 1661) εὶσάγωσιν.
But this is not an invariable rule.297.
ταῑν θεσμοΦόροιν]
The first de­ parture from the ordinary formula consists in the substitution of an en­ tirely new group of divinities, for the assembly to invoke.
These are the two Thesmophorian Goddesses, and Lhe Powers whose worship was connected with theirs.
See Müller's Eumenides, § 86, and Greek Literature, chap. ii.
Even the Graces took part in escorting Persephone from the world below.
See the note on Frogs 453.
On Πλούτῳ the Scholiast remarks, ὼς ὰνδρὶ τῆς Περσε­ φόνης, whether as reading Πλούτωνι, or as considering Πλοῡτος and Πλούτων to be interchangeable names.
The con­ nexion between Πλούτων and the twain Goddesses, and their connexion again, as the givers of harvest, with Πλοῡτος, aided by the similarity of the names Πλούτων and Πλοῡτος, seem to have brought about a sort of amalgamation between these two Gods.
Here Πλοῡτος is used for Πλούτων, whilst in Plutus 727 (where see Spanheim's note) Πλούτων is, conversely, used for Πλοῡτος. In Plato's Cratylus, chap. xix (403 A), Socrates says that Πλούτων obtained his name κατὰ τὴν τοῡ πλούτου δόσιν, ὃτι ὲκ τῆς γῆς κάτωθεν ὰνίεται ό πλοῡτος.
And Plutus himself gives much the same explana­ tion of Pluto's name in Lucian's Timon 21.
As to Calligeneia, a name applied originally to Persephone herself, and afterwards to one of her handmaidens, see the remarks in the Introduction.
She is described by the Scholiast here300.
τῇ ΚουροτρόΦῳ τῇ Γῇ]
Earth, the nursing mother, the rearer of youth.
There was, Pausanias informs us (At­ tica xxii. 3, a passage to which Kuster indirectly refers), a temple Γῆς Κουρο­ τρόΦου καὶ Δήμητρος Χλόης close to the Acropolis of Athens:
doubtless the ὶερὸν τῆς Γῆς which Thucydides (ii. 15) mentions as close to the Acropolis, and the ὶερὸν τῆς χλόης (Lys. 835), beside which Cinesias is first espied by Lysi­ strata and the female garrison of the Acropolis, as he is hastening to the walls of that fortress.
312.
δεχόμεθα]
This is the choral re­ sponse to the bidding-prayer ;
and it is noteworthy that the singers invoke not the group of divinities mentioned by the Crieress, but an entirely different group, which in all probability consists of the Gods really invoked at the opening of the Athenian ὲκκλησία.
They are Zens the supreme God ;
Athene and Poseidon, the rival claimants for the possession of Athens ;
Apollo and Arte­ mis ;
and the Nymphs of the Sea and the Mountain.
Observe too how gold is everywhere considered the attribute of things divine.
Apollo is χρυσολύρα (cf. χρυσέα Φόρμιγξ below) :
Athene here, as in Eur.
Ion 9, is χρυσόλογχε, and Leto is χρυσῶπις, with face of gold.
Perhaps I may be allowed to quote some sentences which I noted down (Christmas, 1849) from Orlando Hy­ man's conversation on the first Olympian ode of Pindar.
"There was a notion of Divinity or Oriental Royalty con­ nected with this metal by the Greeks.
Χρυσοῑ θεοὶ, exclaims the slave in the Ranae.
χρυσέη 'ΑΦροδίτηιs Homer's well-known phrase, the aurea Venus of Virgil.
Leto is χρυσῶπις in Aristo­ phanes ;
Athene χρύσαιγις in Bacchy­ lides.
Pindar gives Lachesis a golden frontlet, χρυσάμπυξ.
The statues of Pheidias are of gold and ivory, χρυσελε­ Φάντινος.
If the deities spin, it is with golden spindles, χρυσηλάκατος ;
if they drive, it is with reins of gold, χρυσήνιοι, and in golden chariots, χρυσάρματοι.
They wore crowns of gold, χρυοστέΦανοι and swords of gold, χρυσάοροι, and sat on thrones of gold.
The roof and pave­ ment of Olympus are both of gold.
The golden-haired Apollo, χρυσοκόμης, strikes a lyre of gold, χρυσολύρης.
Posei­ don rules the sea with a golden trident, χρυσοτρίαινος.”
Of. Plato's Symposium chap. xxxiii (216 E) θεῑα καὶ χρυσα.319. περιμάχητον] for the possession of which she had contended with Poseidon.
It was the glory of Athens that these two great divinities were rivals for the honour of being her Πολιοῡχος.320. ολυώνυμε]
What are these "'many names " of Artemis ?
Aristophanes calls her Dictynna in the Wasps and the Frogs, and Agrotera in the Knights and the Lysistrata.
And see supra 116.
And in Lysistrata 439-47 he appears to call her Pandrosus, Phosphorus, and Tauropolis.
Another well-known name was Britomart, familiar to English readers from Spenser's ., Faery Queene."
See the note on Wasps 368.
Catullus in his hymn to Diana Carmen 34), after addressing her as “ Latonia" (Λατοῡς ἒρνος, scion of Leto), proceeds, Tu Lucina dolentibus I Juno dicta puer­ peris:
I Tu potens Trivia, et notho (borrowed) es I Dicta lumine Luna.
You are known as Εὶλείθυια, ‛Εκάτη, and Σελ̣ήνη.
See Müller, Dorians, Book II, chap. 9.Δωρίδος ὴὒκόμοιο, and whose names are given us by Hesiod, Theogony 240-64.327.
χρ
υσέα Φόρμιγξ] ή τοῡ 'Απόλλωνος, as the Scholiast rightly says.
For this is the χρυσέα Φόρμιγξ of the Immortals, which Pindar celebrates with such splendour at the commencement of his Pythian odes.
The epithet χρυσέα is itself sufficient to negative Fritzsche's notion, that the Chorus are calling upon the theatrical musicians to strike up.
They are praying to the Almighty Gods, and they trust that, as they pray, the strains of Apollo's golden lyre will vibrate through the Heavens, responsive to their prayer.
Cf. Birds 217-22.
The lyre and the phorminx were one and the same instrument.
331.
εὒχεσθε]
We now arrive at a passage of great interest.
The Crieress recites the Ai'A, as it was called, which was one of the preliminary ceremonies of an Athenian Assembly, and to which the Orators are constantly referring.
λέγετὴν Αρὰν, says one ;
ὰκούσατετῆς 'Αρᾱς, says another, and thereupon the 'Apa is read aloud.
Unfortunately, its exact terms are nowhere preserved, but enough may be gathered from the speeches to satisfy us that we have here a faithful parody or imitation of it.
The statement of Andocides (De Myst. 95) that the 'Apa was a νόμος Σόλωνος, though inaccurate, is not quite so "perfectly reckless and unmeaning" as Mr. Grote (chap. lxii) pronounced it.
For we now know (from Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 16 ad fin.) that in its origin it was so.
And cf. Demosthenes de F. L. 78 (p. 363).
Solon's law ran, ὲάντινες τυραννεῑν ὲπανιστῶνται ὲπὶ τυραννίδι, ἢ τὴν τυραννίδα τιςσυγκαθιστῇ, ἂτιμον εἶναι καὶ αὺτὸν καὶ γένος.
This would naturally be much strengthened after the expulsion of the Peisistratidae, and the Scholiast on 339 is doubtless right in saying ὲκτῆς κατάρας τῆς ὲπὶ τοῑς Πεισιστρατίδαις γενομένης ταῡτα παρέμιξεν.
This part of the 'Αρὰ was afterwards largely expanded by the Psephism of Demophantus, passed, Lycurgus (against Leocratcs §§ 127-131) tells us, after the overthrow of the Thirty, the actual words of which are given us by Andocides.
Every Athenian was to swear that he would, if possible, slay with his own hand ὂς ἆνκαταλύσῃ τὴν δημοκρατίαν τὴν Αθήνῃσι, καὶ ὲάν τις τυραννεῑν ὲπαναστῇ, ἢ τὸν τύραννον συγκαταστήσῃ, and finally ὲπεύχεσθαι εὺορκοῡντι μὲν εἶναι πολλὰ καὶ ὰγαθὰ, ὲπιορκοῡντι 6' έξώληαὺτὸνεἶναι καὶ γένος.
The oath was to be taken at the commencement of the Dionysia, as indeed had been the custom with the earlier editions of the oath ;
Birds 1072-5.
Other portions of the 'Αρὰ will be considered in the following notes.336.
ὲπικηρυκεύεται Μήδοις]
The 'Αρὰ appears to have consisted of several se­ parate clauses or articles, like those in our Commination Service.
The pre­ sent clause was inserted by Aristeides shortly after the termination of the great Persian wars ;
ἒτι δὲ apas θέσθαι τοὺς ὶερεῑς ἒγραψεν, says Plutarch in his Life of Aristeides, chap. x, εἲ τις ὲπικη­ ρυκεύσαιτο
Μήδοις, ἢ τὴν συμμαχίαν ὰπο­ λίποι τῶν'Ελλήνων.
We know that it continued to form part of the 'Apa in the next century ;
ὲν δὲ τοις συλλόγοις, says Isocrates (Paneg. 184), ἒτικαὶ νυν
Here the name of Euripides is added, as being the public enemy of the Athe­ nian women, even as the Modes were of the Athenian state.337. ὲπὶ βλάβῃ] to the injury of;
with intent to injure.
See infra 360 and 366.
βλάβη was the legal term for damage (Wasps 1407) ;
and ὲπὶβλάβῃ was the legal formula expressive of an intent to damage.
Isocrates in three different orations (Panegyricus 149, De Pace 87, Panathenaicus 237) contrasts a deed done ὲπὶ βλάβῃ with the same deed done in ὼΦελεία̣.
Dr. Blaydes refers to the law set out in Demosthenes against Meidias 146 (ὲπὶ βλάβῃ τοῡ δήμου) ;
to Dem.
against Timocrates 232 (ὲπὶ βλάβῃ τοῡ πλήθους) ;
and to Thuc. viii. 72, where the messengers of the Four Hundred say to the armament at Samos, that the constitution had been altered .340. κατεῑπεν] πρὸς τὸνδεσπότην.- Scholiast.
Aristophanes is now divert­ ing the denunciations of the 'Αρὰ.
so as to satirize the vices, real or supposed, of Athenian women.
Itis not the adulteress, or the wife who palms off a supposititions child upon her husband, whom they do­ nounce, but the traitress who reveals these offences to the husband—ὲνετρύλ­ λισεν, insusurravit.
As to the suppositi­ tious child see infra 407, 502, 565.
From the Epilogue to the Captives of Plautus, and the Prologue to the Eunuch of Terence, this seems to have been one of the stock incidents of Comedy.
And cf. Juvenal vi. 602.
We know of no­ thing in the 'Αρὰοn which these par­ ticular denunciations are framed.342.
ὰγγελίας ψευδεῑς]
Here again we come upon traces of the 'Αρά. For Schömann (De Corn. i. 8) is no doubt right in deriving this line from the curse which, it appears from Demo­ sthenes de F. L. 78-80 (p. 363), was denounced by the κῆρυξ at every As­ sembly on an Ambassador who brought false tidings, ὲξώλη ποιεῑν ποιεῑν, καὶ γένος καὶ οὶκίαν, though here the person denounced is not an ambassador, but a go-between.
And in like manner he derives the following line from the 'Αρὰ similarly denounced εἴ τις ὲξαπατῡ̣ λέ­ , Demosthenes against Aristocrates 115 (p. 653), Deinarchus against Demo­ sthenes 48 (p. 96).
345.
γραῡς ἳνα αὺτῇ συγγένηται.
—Scho­ liast.
Like the old woman in the Plutus, as Bergler observes.
And com­ pare Plutarch's Solon, chap. xx ad fin.
In the next line the copula καὶ connects the two verbs δίδωσι and δέχεται in such a way that we must needs understand δῶρα after the latter.
The meaning therefore is "
Or, being a mistress, takes bribes to desert her lover for a wealthier paramour."
The 'Αρὰ, as Schömann points out, included those who took bribes κατὰ τῆς πόλεως, Deinarchus ubi supra.
And probably the words προδι­ δοῦσα τὸν φίλον are the women's sub­ stitute for προδιδοὺς τὴν πόλιν.347.
κεἴ τις κάπηλος K.T.X.]
In his later Comedies Aristophanes enjoys a little jest at the (alleged) tippling habits of Athenian women.
The present denun­ ciation is launched against any vintner (male or female) who gives them short measure in their winecups.
A κοτύλη was about half-a-pint;
a χοῦς was nearly six pints ;
νόμισμα is " the stan­ dard measure " and may well have been employed in the 'Αρὰ in connexion with the offence of clipping the current coin.
διαλυμαίνσθαι is " to tamper with, to cut short, to injure."
Bergler has already referred to Plutus 435, where one of the old citizens, dismayed by the sudden appearance of Poverty, asks352.
ξυνευχόμεσθα]
The Chorus inti­ mate their concurrence in the 'Αρὰ by a little song, which commences and concludes with iambics, but is otherwise choriambic.
The sixth and seventh lines are pure choriambic dimeters, and they are followed by eleven lines in the glyconic metre, which is itself a branch of the choriambic.
See the Introduction to the Frogs, pp. xxxii, xxxiii.355.
ὅσαις προσήκει]
The Scholiast rightly explains the passage ;
ὅσαις δὲ προσήκει τὰ ἄριστα λέγειν, ταύτας νικᾶν λεγούσας, that their speeches may win to whom it appertains to speak what is best, that is, to gice the best advice.
With προσήκει we must understand λέγειν.
This omission of the infinitive is very common, and many examples will be found in the Oxford Lexicon s. v. προσ­ ήκω.363.
τἀπόρρητα]
The original fulmina­ tion was doubtless aimed at men who exported contraband of war for the service of the enemy (Frogs 362), but it is here diverted, as the word λέγουσι shows, to women who divulge to strangers the incommunicable secrets of the Thesmophorian festival (Eccl. 442).367. τε τοὺς θεοὺς]
I have added these words, which seem required by both the sense and the metre.
The MS.
reading, which with slight alteration is retained by the editors, is ἀσεβοῦσιν ἀδικοῦσίν τε τὴν πόλιν.
After παγκρατὲς, in line 368, a cretic foot commencing with a vowel, has dropped out.
Like its ten pre­ decessors, the line was originally in the glyconic metre, and I have inserted εὐμενὲς in brackets, rather to show a possible, than as thinking it the true, completion of the line.
Indeed, I am not sure whether ὄλβιε might not be more suitable.372.
ἔδοξε τῇ βουλῇ κ.τ.λ.]
This is quite in the regular form.
Thus in the armistice which preceded the Peace of Nicias, we read ἔδοξε τῷ Δήμῳ 'Ακά­ κ.τ.λ.
Tliuc. iv. 118.
The ἐπιστάτης was the President of the Prytanes, and in that capacity put the motion to the vote ;
the γραμματεὺς was their secre­ tary, who was responsible for the ac­ curate drawing up of the decree :
Laches in Thucydides, and Sostrata here, are of course the movers of the respective resolutions.
The suggestion of Fritzsche that under the names of Timocleia, Lysilla, and Sostrata, Aristophanes is satirizing three effeminate citizens named respectively Timocles, Lysicles (Knights 7G5), and Sostratus (Clouds 678) is perhaps more ingenious than probable.
Satire of that kind would be out of harmony with the general tone of the present passage.375.
τῇ Μέσῃ]
The Intermediate, day.
See the note on 80 supra.
On the words ᾗ μάλισθ' ἡμῖν σχολὴ, the Scholiast ob-377.
χρηματίζειν]
To transact business, to discuss.
λόγους διδόναι ἀλλήλοις.— Scholiast.
It is the regular term for " transacting business " in the Assembly.
See, for example, the passage cited from Isocrates in the note on 336 supra.378.
ἀδικεῖν δοκεῖ]
We all adjudge hint to be guilty.
See Birds 1585, Lysias (adv. Andoc. 14, adv. Nicom. 1, for Polystratus 16), Lives of the Ten Orators (Andoc. 9).379. τίς ἀγορεύειν βούλεται ;
]
This was the recognized formula, by which the κῆρυξ invited the citizens to commence the debate, TO κάλλιστον καὶ σωφρονέ­ στατον κήρυγμα τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει, as Ae­ schines calls it (adv. Ctes. 4). Aristo­ plumes repeats it Ach. 45, Eccl. 130.
In a famous passage of the De Corona (218-23)
Demosthenes is describing the stupefaction of the Athenians, when the news of the seizure of Elateia by Philip of Macedon had awakened them to a sense of his real designs and their own most imminent peril. "
The κῆ­ ρεξ," says he, " put the question τίς ἀγορεύειν βούλεται ;
and no one answered :
yea, though he put it again and again, yet no man arose, though all the generals were there, and all the orators, and the fatherland was calling with one voice for some one to come forward and speak to save her."
See Lucian's Zeus Trag. 18, Deorum Ecclesia all init.381.
σίγα K.T.X.]
Compare the third line of the Prologue to the Paenulus of Plautus, sileteque, et tacete, atque unimum advortite.
χρέμπτεται, expectorates, clears her throat ;
" a slight expectoration, just like what one makes before begin­ ning a long speech."
Woodstock, chap. 5.383. φιλοτιμίᾳ]
The Crieress now leaves the stage and the " First Woman " commences her speech.
Here, and nowhere else, the MSS.
and Scholiast prefix καλλιλεξία to ΓΥΝΗ, meaning it, apparently, for the name of the lady, and not as a compliment to her elo­ quence.
On the other hand there is, as Fritzsche observes, some ground for supposing that Aristophanes intended the speaker's name to be Mica (infra 760) ;
since the Woman who was robbed of her baby was probably she whose baby had previously appeared on the stage (infra 608, 609) ;
and this was almost cer­ tainly the First Woman."
And any­ how it seems better to retain that general appellation for the present speaker.
She delivers an able and well-considered speech to show how greatly the position of Athenian wives has been worsened by the attacks of Euripides.
Not that she denies the justice of those attacks:
she objects to them not because they are untrue, but because they are true :
because he has put the husband up to his wife's pecca­ dilloes, and so has prevented their repe­ tition.386. ὑμᾶς]
Observe the speaker's rhe­ torical artifice.
She begins as if she were seeking to redress merely the grievances of her audience :
though she very quickly glides into the admission that their grievances are also her own.387.
λαχανοπωλητρίας]
The market­ gardener's son :
the son of the vegetable- seller.
The trade of Cleito, the drama­ tist's mother, was a favourite jest with the Comic poets ;
and in Aristophanes it pervades the allusions to Euripides from his earliest appearance in the Acharnians to his latest appearance in the Frogs.
See the note oil Frogs 840.389. ἐπισμῇ]
Besmears us with, ἐπι­ χρίει, ἐπιξύει.
σμῆξαι δέ ἐστι τὸ TOV ῥύπον ἐπιξύσαι.
—Scholiast.
The lines which follow are well explained by Bisetus,392.
μυχοτρόπους]
She now proceeds to enumerate some of the names which Euripides has applied to the women.
By μυχοτρόπ
ους we are to understand unfathomable, impenetrable, shrouding their moods in mystery ;
and so, deceit­ ful, hypocritical;
τὰς τοὺς τρνπους ἐν μυχῷ τὰς δυσγνώστους.— Bisetus, clandestinis moribus praeditas, sive subdolas, fallaces.
— Kuster.
μυχὸς was a favourite word of Euripides, and he may well have applied it to the depths of a woman's mind.394.
τὰς οὐδὲν ὑγιές] scilicet οὔσας, no good, goud for nothings.
The expres­ sion οὐδὲν (or μηδὲν) ὑγιές occurs once in the Acharnians, once in the Ecclesiazusae, twice in the present Play (here and 636 infra), and no'less than seven times in the Plutus.395.
ἰκρίων]
From the benches, that is, from the theatre.
ἴκρια properly means wooden planks, and is commonly em­ ployed in Homer to describe the planks of a ship's deck.
At Athens the word signified the wooden benches or rows, on which before the Theatre of Diony­ sus in which these Comedies were ex­ hibited was erected, the audience were seated at the dramatic performances ;
ὡν ἐθεῶντο τοὺς Διονυσιακοὺς ἀγῶνας, πρὶν ἢ κατασκευασθῆναι τὸ τοῦ Διονύσου θέατρον.—Photius s. v.
So the Scholiast here, Hesychius and Suidas s.v., Eusta­ thius on Od. iii. 350, and other gram­ marians.
In the time of Aristophanes the seats were of stone, but the old name was retained.396.
ὑποβλέπουσι]
Look at us keenly and suspiciously, glancing up from under their bent brows.
See Lysistrata 519.401. στέφανον]
Now-a-days, if a woman is found merely weaving a chaplet, she is suspected of weaving it for some young reveller, and is charged with being in love.
The speaker is selecting certain examples of the injury occa­ sioned to women by the teaching of Euripides ;
and we may feel sure that in every instance there is an allusion to some particular scene or sentiment in the Euripidean drama.404. τῷ Κορινθίῳ ξένῳ] ἐκ Σθενεβοίας Εὐριπίδου.—Scholiast.
The "Corinthian stranger" is, of course, Bellerophon. " The ancients," says Athenaeus (x. chap. 30), " assigned to their dead friends the morsels of food which fell from their table ;
whence Euripides too says of Stheneboea, when she thought that Bellerophon was dead, Nothing that falls escapes her wistful eyes, ' That's for our friend from Corinth,' quick she cries.
But Athenaeus is apparently mistaken in connecting these lines with the superstition about the dead.
Long before there was any question of Bel­ lerophon's death, the love of Stheneboea had turned into hatred :
it is not a case of food falling from the table, but of some article dropped from the hand.
Aristophanes treats it here as a pitcher dropped by a woman not sitting at table, but perambulating the house, and makes the ejaculation.
like that ascribed to Myrrhina in Lys. 856, refer not to a dead, but to a living lover.
And it seems to me that the lines were spoken by some go-between, like the old nurse in the Hippolytus.
trying to kindle love in Bellerophon's breast by detailing the passion which is con­ suming her mistress.
This may be one of the scenes to which Aeschylus is referring in Frogs 1051.406.
τὸ χρῶμα κ.τ.λ.]
Though the line, as its metre shows, is not verbally taken from a Tragic Play, yet doubtless it represents some passage of Euripides :
not indeed from the Aeolus, as Fritzsche suggests, since there the brother was the corrupter, and not (as here) the sus­ picious guardian, of his sister's inno­ cence.407.
ὑποβαλέσθαι] to foist off a sup­ posititious child as her own:
to pretend to give birth to a child, which is really somebody else's child, secretly smuggled into her bed.
See the note on 340 supra.
She is really making the very charges, which create such indigna­ tion when Mnesilochus makes them, with regard to the conduct of the women.
413.
δέσποινα ... γυνή]
This line is cited by Stobaeus (Ixxi. 1) from the Phoenix of Euripides.
He was not the only poet who gave utterance to this sentiment.
See Athenaeus xiii. chap. 9.414. διὰ τοῦτον] through him;
by reason of his teaching.
Bergler thinks, with great probability, that the speaker is alluding to the Danae of Euripides, where the heroine was certainly repre­ sented as guarded by bolts and bars and seals ;
and as to the watch-dogs, Fritzsche refers to the commencement of Horace's Ode (iii. 16) " Inclusam Danaen turris aenea Robustaeque fores et rigilum canum Tristes excubiae mu­ nierant satis Nocturnis ab adulteris," where the precautions described are very possibly borrowed from the Attic tragedy.
416.
Μολοττικούς] Aristotle (de Ani­ mal.
Hist. ix.
1) mentions two well- known breeds of Molossian dogs:
(1) hounds for sporting, which however, he says, were not in any special manner distinguished from other sporting dogs, and (2) the large, powerful, and coura­ geous sheep-dogs, which are the " Mo­ lossian dogs" of literature.
Veloces Spartue catulos, acremque, Molossum, Pasce sero pingui;
nunquam custodibus illis Nocturnum stabulis furem, incursus­ que luporum, Aut impacatos a tergo horrebis Iberos, Virgil, Georg. iii. 405.
Molossus, aut fulvus Lacon, Amica vis pastoribus, Horace, Epodes, vi. 5. damus alta Molossis Personuit canibus, Id. Sat. II.
vi. 114. It is, of course, to these vigilant watch-dogs that the speaker is here referring.
417.
μορμολυκεῖα]
The word here signifies real terrors, but it generally stands for make-believe fictitious ter­ rors got up to frighten children ;
τὰ φο­ βερὰ τοῖς παισὶ προσωπεῖα, Timaeus, where see Ruhnken's note.
Such was the equipment of Death in Tennyson's "Gareth and Lynette."
So in the Phaedo, chap. 24, "Assume, Socrates," says Cebes, "that we are afraid of death, or rather not we, but the child within us" (the child's heart within the man's), " aDd teach that child not to be frightened at death, ὥσπερ τὰ μορμολυκει̑α."
So St. Ambrose, willing to die a martyr's death, despised the threats of the tyrant, μορμολυκει̑α yap ὑπέλαβε ταυ̑τα, μειρακυλλίοις ὑπό τινων πρ
οσφερόμενα, Theodoret H. E. v. 13. παίδων μορμολυκει̑α, St. Chrys. Hom. in Matth. xxviii (336 D).419. ταμιευ̑σαι] to cater for ourselves.
οὐκέτι ἐμοὶ. ταμιεύσεις, Knights 948. καὶ πρ
οαιρούσαις λαβει̑ν, and pick out and take corn and wine and oil.
For προαιρει̑ν in the sense of e penn aliquid promere Kuster refers to the Characters of Theophrastus, [περὶ. ἀγροικίας] προαιρω̑ν δέ τι ὲκ του̑ ταμιείον κ.τ.λ. and Casaubon's note there.
Here the orator comes to their chief grievance against Euripides.
His other offences might possibly be condoned, but no pardon can be ex­ tended to the man whose teaching has put a stop to these little pilferings from the household stores.
See Eccl. 15 and the note there.421. κλειδία] Pliny (N. H. vii. 57) attributes the invention of the key to Theodorus of Samos, apparently a COIl­ temporary of Solon ;
though there is much doubt as to his date, and also whether there were not more artists than one bearing that name.
The earliest keys were very simple, the part which turned the lock being merely a flat piece of wood without any division :
μονοβάλανα, the Scholiast calls them.
But soon locks were framed with complicated wards, and keys with complicated steps as they are now technically called;
teeth, as the ancients called them ;
γομφίους, οὓς ἡμει̑ς ὀδόντας, says the Scholiast;
"seu reserat fixo dente puella fores," Tibullus, I. ii.
18. See Frogs 572.
The Laconian keys en­ joyed a great celebrity, and are fre­ quently mentioned by ancient writers :
περιβόητοί εἰσιν αί Λακωνικαὶ κλει̑ες, the Scholiast tells us.
And he cites a line from Menander's Μισούμενος ("The man who was hated")
Λακωνικὴ κλείς ἐστιν ὡς ἔοικε μοι περιοιστέα.
And Brunck refers to Plautus, Mostellaria, II. i. 57, where Tranio says (in trochaics), " cla­ vem mihi harunce aedium LaconicamI Jam jube efferri intus ;
hasce ego aedes occludam foris."
It is interesting to observe that according to Plutarch (Romulus, chap. 22) κλειδω̑ν ὑποβολὴ was one of the three causes for which Romulus allowed a husband to divorce his wife.
The old-fashioned locks were easily picked, but with these intricate steps and wards it became quite another matter.
422.
κρυπτά]
Fritzsche, referring to Iliad xiv. 168, and Eustathius's com­ mentary thereon, thinks that the key itself was inclosed in a case of wood, or some other material;
but more probably the word here means merely secret, private.424.
οὐκ ἦν ἀλλ'] we had only to pick, we had nothing to do but to pick.
I have substituted οὐκ. for οὖν, which did not seem to make sense.425.
δακτύλιον] a signet-ring, in imita­ tion of their husbands':
σφραγίδιον παρα­ πλήσιον ᾧ ἐσφραάγιζεν ὁ ἀνήρ.—Scholiast.
Athenian husbands were accustomed not only to lock the storehouse door, but for greater security to affix their seal as well.
Till now, Athenian wives could laugh at these precautions.
They could easily open the lock, whilst they could buy a seal-ring for three obols, and replace the husband's broken seal by an exactly similar impression.
But now, thanks to the teaching of Euri­ pides, the husband used a complicated lock and key, which defied all the efforts of the wife ;
and instead of the old plain seal, he now wore a " worm- eaten seal" which it was quite im­ possible to imitate.
It was thought of such importance that a signet-ring should not be imitated, that according to Diog.
Laert. (Solon 57) Solon re­ quired the engraver to destroy the die of every ring he sold.
The ancients used not sealing-wax, but a tenacious clay, γη̑ σημαντρίδα, Hdt. ii. 38. ῤύπους, Lysistrata 1198.427. θριπήδεστ'] worm-eaten.
The word is not employed metaphorically, as might be supposed, of an intricate design for a seal.
There is abundance of authority to show that the ancients did, in reality, use pieces of worm- eaten wood for their seals.
Kuster refers to Eustathius on Odyssey i. 150 and Tzetzes on Lycophron's Cassandra 508, in both of which passages the fact is plainly stated.
See also Hesychius s. v. θριπόβρωτος.
The participle ἐξ­ αψαμένους seems simply to mean "wear­ in,, on their fingers."
Deinarchus, in his speech against Demosthenes, 37, ac­ cuses his opponent of parading about the streets in pomp and luxury, χρυὸν ἐκ τω̑ν δακτύλων ἀναψάμενος, in the midst of his country's misfortunes.432.
τη̑ς γραμματέως] the clerkess.
This was the γραμματεὺς TOO δήμου, the clerk who attended the Assembly, not neces­ sarily the same person as the γραμματεὺς τη̑ς βουλη̑ς mentioned supra 374.
The mover of a resolution either brought it ready written, or drew it up with the assistance of the γραμματεὺς in the Assembly itself.
See Schömann, Do Comitiis i. 11.
And see the last words of the oration, attributed to Demosthenes, de Foedere Alexandrino.
In the latter alternative the mover was said συγγράφεθαι (as here συγγραάψομαι), but the Oxford Lexicographers appear to be mistaken in saying that this sense is confined to the Middle, since the Psephism of Demophantus (as to which see the note on 331 supra) commences ῎Εδοξε τῃ̑ βουλῃ̑ καὶ τᾦ Αημῳ.
Αἰαντὶς ἐπρ
υτάνευε, Κλεογένης ἐγραμμάτευε, Βοθὸς ἐπεστάτει. τάδε Δημόαντος συνέγραψετ.433. οὔπτε κ.τ.λ.]
The Chorus here, like the Chorus in Wasps 631, and other Choruses elsewhere, indulge in a little song of triumph on the skill and eloquence of their advocate.
Each of the three speeches here delivered is followed by a short lyric :
the first and third being antistrophical to each other ;
whilst the second, which is con­ siderably the shortest of the three, is, as Enger observes, a sort of μεσῳδός.
In the strophe and antistrophe the opening line is spondaic, and all the rest tro­ chaic ;
in the mesode all the lines are trochaic.434.
πολυπλοκωτέρας]
The repetition of this word in the mesode makes it evident that the poet is ridiculing its application by Euripides, in some lost drama, to the intricate wiles of a woman's mind.
In his extant Tragedies, πολύποκον, many-woven, is applied to the coils of a serpent (Medea 481) and the "shifting maze of the draughts'' (Iph. in Aul. 197, Way's translation).437. ἐβάστασεν] weighed, pondered.
Such an expression as φρενὶ, which the MSS.
add here to the destruction of the metre, or ἐν γνώμᾳ, which Aeschylus adds in Prometheus 906, to which Bergler refers, is not essential to this meaning of the word.
Suidas, s. v. βαστάσας, to which Kuster refers, ex­ plains that participle by δοκιμσάς, and cites four lines from Eupolis :
441.
Ξενοκλέης]
See the note on 168 supra.
In saying that, by the side of the eloquent lady whose praise they are singing, he would seem to talk nonsense, the Chorus probably mean to imply that this is what he always does.443.
ὀλίγων μὲν ἕνεκ']
Another woman now comes forward, to second the remarks of the First speaker.
She is not an eloquent orator like her prede­ cessor ;
nor does she even allude to the Poet's attacks upon womankind.
Her grievance is like that of Demetrius the silversmith in the Acts of the Apostles.
A poor hard-working widow, she had earned a scanty livelihood for herself and her children by plaiting myrtle- chaplets for the worship of the Gods, but Euripides, by persuading the people that there are no Gods, has well-nigh ruined her trade.
Having unfolded her plain unvarnished tale, she forthwith leaves the Assembly, and returns to her chaplet-plaiting in the myrtle-market.
I have inserted μὲν, which is omitted in the MSS., probably because the following word commences with ἕτ-.
It is, how­ ever, necessary to the metre, and is found in the same position in both the other speeches (supra 383, infra 466), and indeed in very many speeches in Thucydides and Xenophon.
Other editors supply the missing syllable in other ways.446.
ἐν κύπρῳ]
She does not inform us how he came to be in Cyprus ;
but possibly the enlightened and beneficent rule of Evagoras was already beginning to attract Athenians thither ;
or there may have been some military operations there, in which the Athenians took part, subsequent to the expedition of Cimon about forty years before the date of this Play.448.
ἐν ται̑ μυρρίναις
In the myrthe­ market.
See the note on Wasps 789.
She plaited her coronals in the myrtle- market, because it was of myrtle that she made them, διὰ μυρρινω̑ν στεφάνους ποιου̑σα.—Scholiast.
The myrtle crown was prominent in divine worship, and especially in the worship of Demeter and Persephone.
See the note on Frogs 323.
And indeed there was but one shrine, whether in Greece or in Rome, to which the myrtle was a stranger.
That exception was the shrine of the Bona Dea, an exception so re­ markable that Plutarch in the twentieth of his Roman Problems" thought it necessary to inquire into its origin ;
διὰ οὐκ εἰσφέρουσιν;
His own solution is that the myrtle, being sacred to Aphro­ dite, was unacceptable to the pure and virgin goddess.
449. τέως]
Up to this time (that is, till Euripides came, cf. Frogs 989) I main­ tained myself (Knights 1258) though in a very poor way.
In the preceding line it was ἔβοσκον, I maintained my children ;
here it is ἐβοσκόμην, I maintained myself and children.
Teas, as Timaeus says in his Platonic Lexicon, means ἕως τινὸς, up to a certain date.
See the scene in the Phaedo, when Socrates drinks the hemlock ;
τέως μὲν, says the narrator, " up to that time we had managed to restrain our tears ;
but when we saw him drinking, our tears, in spite of ourselves, fell down like rain."451.
οὐκ εἶναι θεούς]
It will be sufficient to refer, with Bergler, to a passage in the ppet's Bellerophon, preserved by Justin Martyr, which commences Φησίν τις εἶναι δη̑τ' ἐν οὐρανῳ̑ θεούς ;
οὐκ εἰσὶν, οὐκ εἔσ'.
—Fragment x in Wagner's collection.459.
ἕτερ
ον αὖ κ.τ.λ.]
The Chorus are not in a critical mood, and they attribute to the plain statement of the Second Woman even more subtle-mindedness and elegance than they had attributed to the elaborate oration of the First.
With the parenthetical words φρένας ἔχουσα καὶ νόημα cf. 291 supra.466-519.
So soon as the Chorus have concluded their eulogy, Mnesilochus rises to address the assembly.
His first words may remind the reader of the politic manner in which Xenophon commences his speech to the irritated soldiery at Byzantium ;
ὅτι μὲν ὀργίζεσθε, ὦ ἄνδρες στρατιω̑ται, καὶ νομίζετε δεινὰ πάσχειν ἐξαπατώμενοι,οὐ θαυμάζω.
Like Xenophon too, he proceeds to argue that their irritation, though not surprising, is nevertheless unreasonable.
For, says Mnesilochus, though Euripides does indeed write some unpleasant things about us, yet, between ourselves, we know that we deserve them all, and more ;
we are ever so much blacker than he paints us.
As the courtesan in Truculentus (ii. 5) observes, Cumque cam rem in cordo agito, nimio minus perhibemur Malae, quam sumus ingenio.
And then, with broad Plautine humour, he sketches a number of scandalous incidents of which Euripides had never dreamed.
It is a very clever and witty speech, and Fritzsche can hardly find words to express his admiration of it.
To him it is "plena facetiarum et PAENE DIVIN A," and he adds, "ultima narratione a v. 502 nihil melius aut in suo genere praestantius ne optari quidem posse."470. εἰ μὴ] μαίνομαι]
I were mad else.
Clouds 660.
δοῦναι λόγον, in the next line, means to discuss the matter fairly and reasonably.472.
aὐταὶ γάρ ἐσμεν]
For ice are by ourselves ;
ἀντὶ τοῦ μόναι.—Scholiast.
So Acharnians 504.
The phrase is a very common one, and I will only observe that it is found, exactly as here, in the recently discovered Mimes of Herondas, vi. 70.—κοὐδεμί᾽ ἔκφορ
ος λόγου.
And there is no blab, no tell-tale, to reveal what we say ;
οὐδεμία εχφέρουσα τοὺς λόγους πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας.—Scholiast.
Cf. Eccl. 443.
It seems probable that Plato, in the last section of the Laches, is referring to this passage, and that we should there, as Fritzsche suggests, read οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἔκφορος λόγου (not λόγος).473. τί ταῦτ᾽ κ.τ.λ.] τί, as the Scholiast observes, stands for διὰ τί.
There is a line in the Acharnians (τί ταῦτα τοὺς Λάκωνας αἰτιώμεθα ;
Ach. 514) so very similar to this, that some have supposed ταῦτα here, as there, to be governed by αἰτιώμεθα.
But here ταῦτα seems rather to be connected with ἔχουσαι in the sense of οὕτως ἔχουσαι, Why being thus situated (or, in other words, this being so) do we blame Euripides?480.
ἑπτέτιν]
For another instance of a child corrupted at this early age, Fritzsche refers to the story told by Tzetzes (at Lycophron's Cassandra 103) about Theseus and Helen.
To which I may add Petronius, chap. 25.482. καταβαίνω]
It is plain that in the time of Aristophanes, as in the time of Homer, the θάλαμος or bed-chamber of the master and mistress of the house, was in the ὑπερῴον or upper story.
The " stealthy scratching of the finger-nail," τὸ κνῦμα τῶν δακτύλων (Eccl. 36) was a signal which the accomplice would understand, but which others would not even perceive.486.
κεδρίδας, ἄννηθ
ον, σφάκον]juniper­ berries, anise, sage;
ὠς ἐπιτήδεια παῦσαι στρόφον, as the Scholiast says.
He is preparing a remedy for his young wife's imaginary pains.
All these plants are well known for their medicinal qualities.
The juniperus Lycia is " used in alvine fluxes."
Of anise (pimpinella anisum) "the seeds have been long used by physicians as aromatic and carmina­ tive ;
their chief use is in flatulencies, and in the gripes to which children are especially liable " ;
whilst sage (salvia officinalis) " as possessing a share of aromatic and astringent power, may prove a valuable tonic in a debility of the stomach."
See Miller and Martyn's Dictionary.
Hippocrates, in his second book περὶ διαίτης (vol. i, 686, ed. Kühn), says that ἄνηθον is στατικὸν, that is, an astringent, calculated to stop diarrhœa.
And cf. Galen, περὶ ἁπλῶν φορμάκων, vi. 45.487.
TOV στροφέως ὕδωρ] ἵνα ὀλισθηρὸς γενόμενος μὴ —Scholiast;
to pre­ vent the hinges creaking.
Brunck refers to the passage with which
Act I, scene 3, of the Curculio of Plautus commences, where the old woman says to the girl she is letting out of doors, Go out softly, my own Planesium;
take you heed that the hinges creak not;
let not the opening doors be noisy;
let not our master hear us go ;
stay, on the hinge I'll pour some water (mane, suffundam aquulam).489.
παρὰ τὸν ᾽Αγυιᾶ]
On the statue, or rather the obelisk, which was sta­ tioned in front of the house to represent the divine Waywarden Apollo, see the note on Wasps 875.
It was natural that by its side should be planted the laurel of Apollo, laurus nobilis, our common sweet Bay.
κύβδα, in a stoop­ ing posture, Knights 365, Peace 897.495.
ἀπὸ τείχους]
For at this period of the war all the citizens of Athens were constantly under arms, ἦσαν ᾽Αθη­ ὅπλοις, Thuc. viii.
69. Cf. Lysistrata. 558 seqq.500. olov y ὑπ᾽ αὐγάς]
Many years ago it occurred to me that this was the easiest way of amending the unmetrical reading of the MSS.
ὑπ᾽ αὐγὰς οἷον.
I did not think it the right way, nor do I now think so ;
but as Bachmann has since proposed, and Velsen adopted, the amendment, I give it in the text as the nearest to the MS.
reading, ὑπ᾽ αὐγὰς is a very familiar phrase, and many examples of its use are collected by Kuster and Fritzsche here and by Ruhn­ ken and Hemsterhuys in their note on the Lexicon of Timaeus, s.v. ὑπ᾽ αὑγάς.
However the very familiarity of the phrase may have led to its super­ seding here what I suspect to have been the true reading, ὑπαυγὲς, the conjec­ ture of Bentley.
But this is a mere question of language :
the meaning of the passage is clear.
The wife stretches out her new mantle for her husband to admire, holding it up that the sun's rays may fall upon it, whilst under-
Heath its screen her lover slinks secretly away.502. έτέρυν 8' ἐγῳδ᾽]
He winds up his speech with a story of the methods employed by a wife for palming off a supposititious child upon her too credulous husband.
The practice has already been twice mentioned, supra 340, 407, and treated as something more common than blameworthy, but the shameless manner in which Mnesi­ lochus unfolds the minutest details of the transaction arouses, we shall find, the most profound indignation amongst his audience.
504.
ὠκυτόκι᾽]
These were helps, mostly in the nature of amulets, employed by women in travail to procure a speedy and safe delivery.
Theophrastus (H.P. ix. 9. 3) recommends the root of the cyclamen as an effective amulet for this purpose.
Fritzsche quotes Phry­ nichus Bekkeri, pp. 74, 5 ὠκυτόκιον. Plutarch, de solertia animalium, chap. 7 δίκαιον ἡμῖν ἀποτέκωσιν.
All these pas­ sages refer to amulets.
But the ὠκυ­ τόκια which Galen (Περὶ εὐπορίστων ii. 26. 13) prescribes are potions and the like, such as βολβοὺς πικροὺς τρίψας διὰ γλυκος, δὸς πιεῖς.505.
ἐν χύτρᾳ]
ὅτι ἐν χύτρᾳ τὰ παιδία
ἐξετίθεσαν.—Scholiast.
The child how­ ever in the present case was not a foundling, but a baby purchased from its parents.
It was brought to the house in a large earthen crock ;
and a piece of a honeycomb was placed in its mouth, which it could suck, and which would prevent it crying.
Inci­ dents of the present kind were frequent in the New Comedy, and were repro­ duced by the Roman comedians.
See the story told by Phronesium in the Truculentus of Plautus ii.
4 ;
and that concocted by Davus in the Andria of Terence:
missa est ancilla illico obstetricem accersitum ad eam, et puerum ut adferret simul (iii. 2. 34).o καλοῦμεν ἔλυτρον (Scholiast), the mem­ brane, or lining, of the womb.
It is difficult to determine whether these words.
form part of the wife's speech, or are the comment of Mnesilochus upon it;
but on the whole I think that the former is the true interpretation.
We have already been told that it was the midwife's signal which called forth the wife's exclamation:
and to attri­ bute it now to the babe's movement would be to give another and a con­ tradictory reason for its occurrence.
The substitution of χύτρας for μήτρας is purely comic, and is no real objection to putting the words into the woman's month.514.
λέων] that is, a prodigy, a lion­ like boy.
αὐτέκμαγμα means the very copy of yourself;
ἔκμαγμα being the impression made by a seal upon the clay.
Compare the language of Pau­ lina in the Winter's Tale ii.
3. κύτ­ ταρ
ος has many significations ;
the cell of a honeycomb, the cup of an acorn, the early pine-cone (τὰ τη̑ς πίτυος προαν­ θου̑ντα ϭτροβίλια), &c.
See the Scho­ liasts here and on Wasps 1111, Peace 199.
The epithet ϭτρεβλὸν, twisted, seems to show that in this passage it signifies a pine-cone.517. νὴ τὴν Ἄρτεμιν]
Mnesilochus does not forget, either here or in 569 infra, to use the women's oath Lys. 435, 922, 949, infra 742, Eccl.
90, 136. He now concludes his speech with a quota­ tion (the Scholiast tells us) from the Telephus of Euripides,520-530.
This little indignant out­ burst is, as we have already seen, the antistrophe to the triumphant eulogy with which the Chorus greeted the peroration of the First Woman's speech.528.
τὴν παροιμίαν]
The proverb was ὑπὸ παντὶ λίθῳ ϭκορπίος, but the Chorus change ϭκορπίος into ῥήτωρ, to suit the occasion.
Both in Athcnaeus (xv. 50, Seol. 18) and in the Anthology (Scol. 15) we find the following scolium by Praxilla of Sicyon :
The metre is that of the Ἀδμήτου λόγον scolium cited in Wasps 1238, which also is ascribed to Praxilla, a famous scoliuin-writer, and very partial to this particular metre.
And Fritzsche is altogether mistaken in supposing that ὑπὸ in the first line does not suit the metre;
the two syllables (technically called the base) which precede the choriambs may be of any quantity :
and many examples in which both are short will be found in Gaisford's learned notes to Hephaestion, chap.
x. Nor can I agree with Fritzsche that the “ancient proverb," which is frequently cited by old writers, was derived from the scolium ;
it was doubtless the sco­ lium which was derived from the pro­ verb.
The proverb is one of those illustrated by Erasmus, and he himself employs it in one of his letters to describe the alarm into which the educated classes of England had been thrown by the violent measures of King Henry VIII.
After noticing the execution of Fisher and the imprison­ ment of More, he proceeds “Caeteri amid, qui me subinde literis et muneri­ bus dignabantur, metu nec scribunt nee mittunt quicquam, neque quicquam a quoquam recipiunt, quasi sub omni lapide dormial scorpius.”
Epistle 1286, Erasmi Opera, Vol. iii, p. 1509.529. ὑπὸ λίθῳ]
The notion of G. Burges that by λίθος we are to under­ stand τὸ βη̑μα τη̑ς πυκνὸς, as in Peace 680 and elsewhere, though accepted by Fritzsche and Enger, seems to me mani­ festly wrong.
The ῥήτωρ could not be ὑπὸ τω̜̑ λίθῳ, though the audience might be.
Eccl. 87.532. οὐδὲν κάκιον]
They are apparently quoting from the Melanippe Desmotis of Euripides τη̑ς μὲν κακη̑ς κάκιον οὐδὲν γίγνεται Γυναικός.
Stobaeus lxix.11.
But the exception πλὴν ἄρ᾿ εἰ γυναι̑κες is tacked on by Aristophanes himself.
The concluding word γυναι̑κες is, of course, introduced παρὰ προϭδοκίαν.
The Chorus are casting about for some object whose vileness is greater than that of the most shameless woman ;
and the vilest object they can call to mind is—woman­ kind in general.
533. Ἄγραυλον] Agraulus (otherwise Ἄγλαυρος), Horse, and Pandrosus were the three daughters of Cecrops, and were famous in the old legends.
We have μὰ τὴν Ἄγραυλον here, and νὴ τὴν Πάνδροϭον (though the name there ap­ pears to belong to Artemis) in Lys. 439 ;
but we nowhere have μὰ or νὴ τὴν ῞Ερϭην.
And so the Scholiast observes, κατὰ τη̑ς Ἀγραύλου ὤμνυον, κατα δε της535.
Φθόρον]
This pest ;
compare Knights 1151.536. εἰ δὲ μή]
If any will help us to punish her (ϭυντιμωρει̑ϭθαι αὐτὸν βουλό­ μεναι.— Scholiast) well;
if not, we will do it ourselves, that is, by ourselves.
In the first branch of the sentence, she is referring to the audience ;
and this seems to be the meaning of the gloss, ἐπειδὴ ἐπὶ ϭκηνη̑ς εἰϭίν.
This elliptical mode of expression is technically called the ϭχη̑μα ἀνανταπόδοτον.
It occurs again in Plutus 468-470 (where many examples of the ϭχη̑μα are collected by Kuster and Bergler) and in St. Luke's Gospel xiii. 9.540. μὴ δη̑τα]
Words of deprecation (infra 751) very frequent in Euripides.
See Med. 337, Alc. 308, Suppl. 267, 320, Iph. in Aul. 1183, Helen 939.
Mnesi­ lochus, as we shall presently see, is quite ready for a stand-up fight;
but he naturally deprecates a mode of attack which would lead to his immediate de­ tection.

Μελανίππας ποιῶν] writing his Melanippes and his Phaedras ;
or rather, presenting those characters in his Plays.
As to Melanippe see the note on 14 supra.
Phaedra, as all know, fell sick for love of her own stepson.
Her name was sure to be prominent in any list of bad women, just as Homer's noble and virtuous Penelope would be foremost on the roll of the good.
Thus in a passage from Eubulus, preserved by Athenacus xiii.
8, a speaker exclaims, O Zeus! immortal Zeus!
am I the man To speak against the ladies?
May I die
If I don't think them excellent!
You name Medea ;
well, I name Penelope.
Then Clytaemnestra, you insist, was bad ;
True, but Alcestis, I reply, was good.
Then Phaedra was immoral :
true, but think
Of virtuous — whom ?-why bless me, whom ?
0 heavens,
My stock of virtuous names has clean run out.
Before my wicked ones are well begun.556.
ϭτλεγγίδας] ξύϭτρας.—Scholiast.
Of these strigils, or skin-scrapers, which were in common use at the baths to remove the sweat and oil from the bodies of the bathers, a great variety may be seen in the British Museum.
They are mostly of very simple con­ struction, not unlike our horse-scraper, or the segment of a hoop from a barrel.
The ϭτλεγγἰς and λήκυθος, being the regular concomitants of a bath, are frequently mentioned together:
οὐδ᾿ ἐϭτὶν αὐτῇ ϭτλεγγὶς οὐδὲ λήκυθος, Aris­ toph.
Daetaleis (Fragm. 29 in Meineke's collection) ;
Plato Charmides, chap. ix. (161 E);
Aelian V. H. xii.29 &c.
These two articles, when a well-to-do citizen went to the baths, were carried for his use by an attendant, who thence derived the somewhat abnormal name of ϭτλεγ­ ϭι̑τον.”
—Suidat.
A strigil was well adapted for scooping down grain, es­ pecially grain stored away where it could not be reached by the hand.
And that the women were addicted to little pilferings of corn is more than once alleged in this very Play, supra 420, infra 813.
And see Eccl. 15, 16 and the note there.
The meaning of the passage, therefore, is quite clear and satisfactory.
Unfortunately, Kuster took it into his head to propose that the word we should have expected to follow ϭιφωνίζομεν, viz.
οἶνον, should be substi­ tuted for the surprise-word ϭι̑τον ;
and this suggestion has been followed by every subsequent editor.
"Haec con­ jectura," Fritzsche truly says, "claro plausu excepta est a Reiskio, Berglero, Brunckio, Bothio, Dindorfio, aliisque passim" ;
and he himself adds his tribute of applause.
But having ac­ cepted and applauded it, the next thing is to make sense of it.
And this they practically admit to be impossible.
Reiske thinks that ϭτλεγγίδας must be a corruption of some other word sig­ nifying a straw, "probo enim Kusteri οἶνον" he adds, recognizing the cause of the difficulty.
Brunck thinks that στλεγγὶς is not used in its ordinary sense, or else that the strigil must have had a tubular handle, through which the wine was sucked.
Fritzsche, having seen the specimens in the Berlin Museum, knew that this would not do, and therefore suggests that the women drew the wine through a tube into the strigil ;
which could hardly, as Enger appears to see, be adduced as a proof of their good sense.
All this difficulty is admitted to be occasioned by Kuster's alteration, yet nobody has returned to the MS.
reading, which gives rise to no difficulty at all.558. ἐξ Ἀπατουρίων]
The Apaturia, the great festival of the phratries, was celebrated in the same month, if not at the very same time, as the Thesmo­ phoria.
The first day was called the Δόρπεια, the Banqueting Day, because in the evening of that day the members of each phratria met together at a great civic banquet ;
ἐπειδὴ φράτ
ορες ὀψίας ϭυνελθόντες εὐωχου̑ντο.—Scholiast at Ach. 146 ;
Suidas.
Doubtless some Athenian women had been recently detected in the act of purloining meat from these banquets, for the purpose (Mnesilochus insinuates) of giving it ται̑ς μαϭτροποι̑ς, to their go-betweens.560. πελέκει] του̑το 8th τὴν Κλυταιμνή]- ϭτραν, says the Scholiast;
and in truth, Euripides does constantly mention the πέλεκυς as the weapon with which Cly­ taemnestra slew her lord.
Hec. 1279, Troades 361, Electra 160, 279, 1160.
But Mnesilochus is talking not of what Euripides has described, but of what he has not described, οὐκ εἴρηκέ πω, and un­ doubtedly all these accusations refer to some recent and well-known incidents of Athenian life.
And another Scholiast rightly says οὐκ ἀπὸ ἱϭτορίας, meaning that there is no allusion to the old Clytaemnestra story.
And so in the next example (a wife driving her hus­ band mad with poisonous drugs) (ἀπὸ ἱϭτορίας παλαια̑ εἴληφεν, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς ἐν τῇ Ἀττικῇ τούτου γενομένου.
And again as to the Acharnian parricide, ὡς καὶ τούτου πάλιν γενομένου.
The Acharnian woman had murdered her father, and buried his body under the bath.
In the Wife of Bath's prologue 6347-54, Chaucer gives a list of female crimes very similar to that of Mnesilochus here.564.
ὡς ϭύ]
After enumerating the various crimes committed by Athenian women, he suddenly turns upon his antagonist herself, and charges her with exchanging her baby-girl with her maid­ servant's baby-boy.
This personal attack is too much for the other's patience ;
and a personal brawl ensues which might well have broken up the assembly altogether, but for the unexpected diversion occasioned by the appearance of Cleisthenes.567.
ἐκποκιῶ]
I'll pull your wool out :
I'll comb your coxcomb for you.568.
καὶ μὴν ἰδού]
With these words she throws herself into a fighting atti­ tude.
Mnesilochus, nothing loth, follows her example.
Thereupon she flings her upper garment to a friend, in prepara­ tion for the combat.
Compare the well-known words of Hippouax, λάβετέ μου θοἰμάτιον, κόψω Βουπάλου τὸν ὀφθαλ­ μόν :
and see the note on Wasps 408.569.
πρόϭθες μόνον]
Only lay a hand on me.
In the following line he insinuates that, notwithstanding it is the Νηϭτεία, the woman has been indulging in a feast of sesamé-cake, a favourite dainty with Athenian women, and the recognized wedding-cake at Athens.
See Peace 869, and the note on Peace 862.571. γυνή τις]
A feminine figure is seen approaching, which the Chorus naturally suppose to be a woman, but which turns out to be the notorious Cleisthenes, to whom Mnesilochus, when his face had been shaven into the similitude of a woman's, has already compared himself (supra 235), and who in almost every Comedy of Aristophanes, from the Acharnians to the Frogs, is satirized for the degrading effeminacy of his manners and habits.
So thoroughly is he identified with the womankind, that the Chorus express no indignation at his appearance amongst them ;
though indeed his first speech contains a sort of apologetic excuse for his intrusion.572. ὁμοῦ] ἀντὶ. τοῦ ἐγγὺς παρὰ τοȋς 'Αττικοȋς.—Scholiast.
The two words, however, have not quite the same mean­ ing.
Cleisthenes was already ἐγγύς ;
he would not be ὁμοῦ until he had actually reached them.574.
ξυγγενεȋς] τὰ αὐτά μοι πράττουσαι. —Scholiast.
The words ἐπίδηλος ταȋς γνάθοις refer to the circumstance that his face is as devoid of hair as a woman's, cf. infra 583
He is woman-mad, γυναικο­ μανῶ, just as a speaker in Birds 1344 declares himself to be bird-mad, ὀρνιθο­ μανῶ.
He is their πρόξενος, because, if any question arises about them among the men, he makes it his business to take their part and defend their in­ terests.581.
ἀφράκτοις] unprepared, literally unguarded.
Fritzsche refers to Thuc. i. κ.τ.λ.
With the last words of the line compare Peace 403.582.
τίδ' ἔστιν, ὦ παȋ]
The line is adapted from Wasps 1297, where see the note.585.
ὐναπέμψαι to send up, because the Thesmophorium was on rising ground;
whence the first day of the Festival, when the worshippers went up to the temple, was sometimes called ἡ "Ανοδος, the Ascent.
The Scholiast says, ἀναπέμψαι κυρίως, διὸ καὶ Ανοδος ἡ πρώτη λέγεται, παρ' ἐνίοις καὶ Κάθοδος διὰ τὴν θέσιν τοῦ Θεσ μοφορίου.
And again, θεσμοφόριον. Confer supra 281, infra 623, 1045.
The words Trap' ἐνίοις καὶ
Κάθοδος embody, of course, the ordinary confusion between the first and second days of the Festival.
῎Ανοδος means the Ascent of the women to the temple ;
Κάθοδος, the Descent of Persephone to the world below.
See the Introduction.
The feelings of Mnesilochus during the ensuing dialogue may be more easily imagined than described.
The next question of the Chorus, as Fritzsche remarks, "spirat tragoediam.”593.
ἠλίθιος]
Mnesilochus speaks with a keen recollection of the tortures he endured during the process which Clei­ sthenes is describing.
603.
πρώτη σύ]
It is probable that he is addressing the First Woman ;
and the παιδίον, the dummy child which her nurse is carrying, is doubtless, as Fritzsche suggests, the wine-flask dressed up in baby clothes which at line 690 Mnesilochus snatches from its (supposed) mother's arms.
See the note on 383 supra.605.
Κλεωνύμουγυνή]
If this is the Cleonymus so often mentioned in the earlier Plays, this is his last appearance in the Comedies of Aristophanes.
In the Acharnians and Knights lie is satirized merely for his gross bulk and enormous voracity ;
but thenceforward he is known as the ῥίψασπις, the ἀσπιδ­ αποβλής.
We may be sure that this act of " discretion " occurred at the battle of Delium, where there was a great casting-away of Athenian shields.
Fritzsche thinks it an intentional stroke of humour that the wife of Κλεωνύμη (Clouds 680) should be the first suspected of being a man.610.
ποȋ στρέφει ;

Whither are you turning away?
So supra 230, Lucian'.s Cataplus25, and (metaphorically) Plato's Phaedrus, chap. 12 (236 E).616. στραγγουριῶ]
He excuses his delay by alleging that he is afflicted with strangury, that is, to adopt Forcellini's definition, " urinae stillicidium, cum per intervallum et guttatim defluit ;
a στρὰγξ gutta, et ovpov urina.” ἐπισχε­ τικὰ γὰρ οὔρ
ου τὰ κάρδαμα, says the Scholiast.617.
τί καρδαμίζεις]
What are youwater­ cressing for?
" Finxit hoc verbum," as Bergler says, " a proximo κάρδαμα.
Sic in Vesp. 652, quum alter dixisset, ὧ πάτερ, alter inquit παῦσαι, καὶ μὴ πατε­ ριζε,” where see the note.
620.
Κοθωκιδῶν] Κοθωκίδαι, δῆμος τῆς Οἰνηίδοςφυλῆς.—Scholiast, Photius.
It is the deme to which in later times the orator Aeschines belonged (Lives of the X Orators), but we do not know where it was situated, or whether there was any special reason for its selection by Mnesilochus.
With the repetition in this and the following lines of the indefinite o or ἡ δεȋνα compare St. Chry­ sostom's o δεȋνα καὶ ὁ δεȋνα τὴν δεȋνα γαμείτωσαν (he is speaking of the mar­ riage-arrangements in the Republic of Plato), Horn, iv in 1 Cor. 30 c. Dindorf refers to Plautus, Mercator iv. 3. 23, and Trinummus iN,. 2. 62.624. ὅσ' ἔτη]
Every year.
The Scholiast explains συσκηνήτρια by φίλη συνδίαιτος. σκηνὰς γὰρ ἑαυταȋς ἐποίουν πρὸς τὸ ἱερόν.
We see therefore that, as a rule, two friends were accustomed to lodge and mess together.

This is the consequence, he suggests, of her drinking so much wine.

He is endeavouring to conceal the δερμάτινον αἰδοȋον (see the note on Eccl. 890) which comic actors wore, and the use of which Aristophanes in the Clouds had vainly attempted to discontinue.
See Clouds 538.648. πυκνότερον Κορινθίων] frequentius quam Corinthii.—Kuster. ἐπεὶ τὰςναῦς διὰ τοῦ ᾽Ισθμοῦ εἷλκον Κορίνθιοι, ὥστε μὴ περιέρχεσθαι.—Scholiast.
The Corinth­ ians, dwelling on an isthmus, with a port on each sea, had the inestimable advantage of being able to transport, not only their merchant vessels, but also, on occasion, their triremes, with great rapidity, from one sea to the other.
The ships were hauled on trolleys (ὁλκοὺς, Thuc. iii. 15) along a beaten track, which was from this custom called the Διολκὸς, whence διέλκεις in the present line ;
τὸνΔιολκὸν, δι' οὗτὰ πορθμεȋα ὑπερνεολκοῦσιν ἀπὸ τῆς ἑτέρας εἰς τὴν ἑτέρας θάλατταν, Strabo viii.
2 § 1. The term πυκνότερ
ον forbids us to restrict the speaker's meaning to the compara­ tively infrequent transit of ships of war, though several instances of this transit are recorded by historians ;
and though the present allusion is probably due to the circumstance that, less than two years previously, the Corinthians had, in fact, unobserved by the Athenians, transported in this manner a consider­ able part of their navy from the gulf of Corinth to the Saronic gulf.
Their navy had been operating in the former gulf against the Athenian squadron stationed at Naupactus ;
but at the commencement of the summer season of B.C. 412, Thucydides tells us, the Spartans, planning an expedition to Chios, arranged that the Corinthians τὸν 'Ισθμὸν, should dispatch them at once to Chios.
Accordingly the Corinth­ ians conveyed twenty-one ships across the isthmus without the Athenians knowing anything of the matter.
But shortly afterwards the Athenians at­ tended the Isthmian games, which were celebrated not far from the Διολκὸς, and so discovered what was going on.
Thuc. viii. 7-10.654. τοȋς πρυτάνεσιν]
It was the duty of the Prytanes to keep order at the meetings of the Ecclesia and the Council, employing for this purpose the Scythian archers who formed the police-force at Athens.
See Ach. 54-7, Knights 665, Plato, Protagoras, chap. x. (319 c), and the notes on Eccl. 87 and 143.
In the present case Mnesilochus had been occa­ sioning a disturbance in the Women's Ecclesia, convened by the order of their Council (supra 373-6) ;
and in punishing the offender, the Prytanes are acting as the officers of the Council, infra 943.
This means, no doubt, the Council of the Five Hundred, which, insensibly, takes the place of the βουλὴ τῶν γυναικῶν.655.
ἡμᾶς τοίνυν]
One Man has been discovered in the sacred precincts, and the Chorus now propose to make a minute and thorough search, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any others of that hostile sex are lurking about where no men should be.
In the ensuing Choral song they profess to be moving in and out through the place where the Assembly has just been held, peeping and peering in every direction ;
and they wind up by saying that they have searched in every quarter, and have satisfied themselves that no other Man is there.
But all this is a mere make-believe ;
they never really leave the orchestra at all.
Just as in the Frogs, the Mystic Chorus, without stirring from their station, represent by their gestures and evolutions the successive stages of the Eleusinian pro­ cession ;
so here the Chorus of Women, by their gestures and evolutions in the orchestra, represent the various steps of the vigilant and exhaustive investigation which they profess to be carrying out elsewhere.
The words τὰς λαμπάδας ἁψαμένας point to another, though a very slight, resemblance between the two Choruses.
Both enter with lighted torches;
both extinguish them, and afterwards relight them.
See supra 280, and the notes on Frogs 323, 454, and 1524.656.
τω̑ν θ' ἱματίων] τω̑ν ἐγκύκλωνἀπο­ δυσαμένας.—Scholiast.
They throw oil their upper mantles, to enable them to dance more freely.658. πύκνα]
They speak of the place where the ἐκκλησίαrav γυναιλω̑ν has just been held in terms more strictly appro­ priate to the meeting-place of the real Athenian ἐκκλησίσ.
By διόδους they mean the passages or aisles which traversed the real Pnyx, to enable the citizens to reach their seats, or to go up to the bema without any disorder.
There were tents in the Agora ;
indeed at one time the Scythian archers dwelt in tents in the midst of the Agora.—
Scholiast on Ach. 54.
But there is doubtless also an allusion here to the tents erected in the precincts of the Thesmophorium.
See supra 624.6G2. τὴν πρώτη]
First of all.
This adverbial expression, though not so common as the analogous τὴν ταχιστην (Wasps 990), is yet very frequently found.
See Hdt. i. 153 and iii. 134 ;
Xen. Mem. iii. 6. 10 ;
Demosthenes, Third Olynthiac § 2 ;
Lucian's Piscator § 39.
It is a special favourite with Heliodorus, who constantly employs it in his Aethiopics :
i. 10. 26 ;
iii. 13. 18;
v. 22. 27 ;
vii. 18.27.
The meaning is not quite identical in all the passages cited ;
and it would be im­ possible to supply always the same sub­ stantive ὢραν, ὀδὸν, or the like.
In addi­ tion to'the simple accusative τὴν πρώτην, we find also παρὰ τὴν πρώτην, κατὰ τὴν πρὠτην, and ἀπὀ πη̑ς πρώτης used in a similar sense.
χρη̑ν in this line is Bent­ ley's correction of the MS.
χρή-
If we adopt Porson's χρή σ', we must, I pre­ sume, consider the Coryphaeus to be directing some one member of the Chorus to lead the way in the circling dance.
In this case, of course, την πρώτην would lose its quasi-adverbial signification.
663. μάτενε πάντ'[ε'ρρωμένως]]
The MSS.
have μάτευε ταχὺπάντ' but the line should be a trochaic tetrameter cata­ lectic;
and I have omitted ταχὺ and inserted ἐρρωμέως, not as being the word written by Aristophanes, but as carrying on the metrical swing.667-686.
ἢν γαρ ... ἀποτίνεται]
This system, as Hermann first pointed out, is undoubtedly intended to correspond to that contained in lines 707-725 infra (rt ἂv οὖν... τύχη), although one is a pure Choral song, and the other a dia­ logue between the Chorus and Mnesi­ lochus.
But each system has become so muddled that it is impossible now, espe­ cially in the later lines, to bring them into complete harmony.
And I am not sure that critics have not, in some cases, altered the true reading in one system for the purpose of making it correspond to the corrupt reading in the other.
In the first line, however, it is clear that the error is in the strophe, ἢν γὰρ μὴ λάθῃ which gives a good sense (if a man shall be detected in this sacrilegious act), but does not suit the metre.
For the line, both here and in 707 infra, is plainly an anapaestic dimeter ;
the long syllable of the concluding anapaest being, in each case, resolved into two short syllables, so forming a proceleusmatic foot, ἀνσια here, -τά τις ὂτε there.
Fritzsche first changed μὴ) into ne, as the joint conjec­ ture of himself, Bergk, and an unnamed scholar ;
and this alteration has been generally followed.
Nobody has vouch­ safed to explain this reading, which does not seem altogether satisfactory, and certainly stands in need of some expla­ nation.
I take it to mean
If we shall dis­ cover any man icho, unperceived by me, has perpetrated this sacrilegious act ;
though it may also mean
If we fail to detect him, yet the Gods icill not leave him unpunished.
The first meaning is more suitable to the context;
the second gives the natural signification to ἢν λάθῃ.
Each of these little lyrical systems is preceded by a few trochaic tetrameters.
671.
ἀθέων τε τρόπων.]
That some words have dropped out here is shown both by the sense, and by the metre.
The in­ truder is to be made an example, not of "godless doings," but of the punish­ ment which awaits them ;
and the present line, like the corresponding one in the antistrophe (711), ought to be a complete anapaestic dimeter.674.
αδίμονας]
After this word an iambic dipody has been lost;
and from this point the antistrophical traces are very dimly perceivable.
It seems certain that the strophe has been more depraved than the antistrophe.
The verbiage which follows bears no resemblance to the usual style of Aristophanes, whose language and metres, like the thoughts they embody, are always very crisp and clear. "
He shall show to all mankind that they should reverence the Gods, and following after what is holy, and study­ ing what is lawful, should do the thing that is right."
γυναι̑κες τρει̑ς"—Scholiast.
Alexander was a Comic poet of uncertain date.
See Meineke (Fragm. Corn. Grace. iv. 555), who would correct the line into ἢσαν ἂνθρωποι δὲ πέντε καὶ γυναι̑κες τέτταρες.
The joke is similar to that in the Scolium of Timocreon of Rhodes, which is adapted in Ach.
533.685. παραχρη̑μ' ἀποτνεται]
The adverb παραχρη̑μα is emphatic.
The punishment is instant, and does not tarry.
The XIIIth Satire of Juvenal should doubt­ less commence EXTEMPLO quodcunque malum committitur, ipsi Displicet auctori.
PRIMA est haec ultio, etc. instead of the jejune " Exemplo quod­ cunqne malo " into which editors have corrupted the MS "Exemplo quod­ cunque malum."
See lines 237, 238, of the same Satire.
The Delphian oracle cited in Ael. V. H. iii. 43 declared So Eusehius (H. E. VI. ix. 5), recording the speedy vengeance which fell upon the slanderers of Narcissus, says 'Αλλ' ού καὶ ὁ τη̑ςΔίκης μέγαςὀφθαλμὸς έπί τοίς πεπραγμένοιςἠρέμει μετῄει δὲ ὡς τάχιστα τοὺς ἀσεβει̑ς So in the De Imitatione Christi i. 6. 2 " Si autem prosecutus fuerit quod concupiscitur, STATIM ex reatu conscientiae gravatur.
"689. ἆa]
As the Chorus are CUll­ cluding their search, Mnesilochus sud­ denly snatches a baby from a woman on the stage (apparently the First Woman, who has taken her baby from the nursemaid, supra 608), and flees with it to the altar of the Thesmo­ phorian Goddesses.
There he takes his seat with the child in his arms.
See infra 886.691.
φρου̑δος] he is off.
With the words τὸ παιδίον ἑξαρπάσας μοι φρου̑δος compare Frogs 1343 τὸν ἀλεκτρυόνα μου συναρπάσασα Φρούδη̑Γλύκη.
Both passages are probably adumbrated from some scene in a Euripidean Play, possibly that in which Telephus, in order to gain a hearing, runs off with the infant Orestes.
See the note on Frogs 855.692. ψωμιει̑ς] shall feed him with sops and morsels.
ψωμὸς o εἰς μικρὰ κεκομμε­ νος. — Etym. Magn. Cf. Knights 715 ;
Lys. 19. says Fritzsche, "bene Schol.
Rav.exponit ἐπὶ τω̑ν βωμω̑ν, qui melius etiam dixisset ἐπὶ του̑ βωμου̑"
This is doubtless correct, for μηρίων cannot be understood of the infant's limbs, as a mere ordinary dimi­ nutive of μηρίων But, of course, it must not be supposed that there were really any pieces cut from the victim's thighs" or any sacrificial knife (not­ withstanding the words μαχαίρᾳ. τῃδε) on the altar of the Twain Goddesses.
Mnesi­ lochus speaks in a high tragic vein, and is probably adopting the very words, if not of the Telephus, of some other tragic play.
Indeed, throughout the scene the language is the language of tragedy.
The incident, though analo­ gous to that in the Acharnians (326 seqq.), differs widely in its details.697. τροπι̑ον]
We are still on tragic ground, and the language employed is not exactly appropriate to the matter in hand.
The expressions ἰστάναι βοὴν, to raise a war-cry, and ἰστάαιτροι̑ον to erect a trophy, are very familiar, and here constitute a call to arms, to defeat the aggressive manœuvre of Mnesilochus.
Some, indeed, take τροπαι̑ον as an ad­ jective, connected with βοὴν, a war-cry which may turn our enemy to flight.
But this can hardly be the true meaning.
And, in fact, Mnesilochus has already taken flight, and the object of the woman (supra 689) is to stay him.704.
ἐξαράξει]
The MSS.
and early editions read ἐξάρξω, without sense or metre.
Bentley suggested either ἐξα­ ράξω or ἐξαράξει;
and one or other of these conjectures is adopted by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
ἐξαράξει seems to me indubitably right.
The olov with which the line commences must necessarily carry on the idea of the double olov of the preceding line, olov δέδρακενἒργον;
olov ἐξαράξει k.T. A.
Those who read ἐξαράξωtranslate it, with Reiske, 0 quam pulchre vobis nimiam restrain audaciam excutiam, which en­ tirely ignores the sense in which οἶον has just been employed, a sense rendered emphatic by repetition.
705.
SeLva καὶπεραιτέρω] Dreadful, and more than dreadful.
Compare Birds 416, ἂπιστα καὶ πέpa, incredible, and more than incredible.
Οὓκουν δεινὸνὦ γη̑ και θευὶ καὶ πέραδεινου̑;
exclaims Demosthenes in his First against Stephanus " 90. So Eusebius (H. E. III. v. 3) says that the sufferings of the Jews during the last siege of Jerusalem were δεινὰ καὶ πέρα δεινω̑ν Much in the same way Theodoret, (H. E. 1. vii. 11) δεινὸν καὶ ἂγανδεινόν.
The tirst four words of the present line are repeated from Wasps 417.710.
ὃθεν οὐ φεύξει
The reading of the MSS.
and editions generally is ὂθεν ἢκεις, which can only be translated, as Bentley translates it, Uncle 'itidem veneris nescia.
But the women knew perfectly well whence he came :
the line is an ana­ paestic dimeter, and the true reading may be gathered from the scholium ἢκεις, φησὶν, εἰς τὰς χει̑ρας ἠμω̑ν οὐ721.
ἀθέοιςἒργοις]
Mesilochushas been guilty of the grossest sacrilege by entering the Temple of the Thesmo­ phorian Goddesses:
the Women will requite him by acts of equal sacrilege, for they will burn him at the altar.
" Impium et nefandum est, "says Bergler, " violare eum qui ad aram confugerit :
hunc autem mulieres volunt combu­ rere."726. ἀλλὰτάσδε]
To this line the MSS.
(H originally, and R as corrected) prefix the words πρὸςτὰς γυναι̑κας, meaning that up to this time the Chorus have been addressing Mnesiloohus, but that now they turn to the Women :
though, indeed.
the exhortation is specially directed to the bereaved mother.
It is she who is to take some of the bystanders, bring out the firelogs, and (πυρπολει̑ν) make a con­ flagration of Mnesilochus.
On τάσδε see the note on 295 supra.728.

κληματίδες αἰ ἐκτω̑ν κλημάτων δέσαι- Hesychius.
She addresses this line to her servant;
the next, to Mnesilochus.735.
ὦ θερμόταται γυναι̑κες]
On ascer­ taining that the baby is not a real baby at all, but a large leathern bottle full of wine, Mnesilochus desists awhile from his operations, and apostrophizes " this most headstrong and most winebibbing race of women."
They are, or rather their bibacity is, the. ruin of their husbands' chattels, which they sell or pawn to get wine ;
and also of their own labours of the loom, which can be carried out only by steady hands and sober heads.
They ruin their husbands, and benefit only the vintners.738.
τοι̑ς σκευαρίοις] ἂπαντα γάp ἔκεκα του̑πιει̑νἐνέχυρα τίθεται καὶπιπράσεται.—
Scholiast.
I am not sure that this ex­ planation is not intended, and rightly intended, to refer to τῃκρόκῃas well ;
but Kuster's interpretation of the latter words, "sensus est, ebriosis mulieres et vino deditas parum et male texere," has obtained universal acceptance.
The women now return with the faggots.
They do not at first perceive that their enemy has discovered the fraud about the baby.
741.
δέκα μῆνας]
The period of gesta­ tion is about 280 days, which we, reckon­ ing by calendar months, commonly describe as 9 months, but which the Greeks, reckoning by lunar months, in­ variably describe as 10 months.
Fritzsche refers to Hdt. vi. 69, Menander (cited by Aulus Gellius iii. 16), Terence, Adelphi III.iv.29, Plantus, Cist. I. iii. 15, Pompo­ nius ap. Non. s. v. verminare, and Varro Fragm. p. 318 ed. Bipont ;

The Woman now for the first time comprehends that he has unswathed the baby and found the bottle.
In the next line but one, he holds it out for her inspection.

τρεῖς Χοᾶς ἢ τέτταρας ;
]
Three Pitcher-feasts, or four For, as Brunck observes, "per Χοᾶς intelligendum τὴν τῶν Χοῶν ἑορτὴν, cujus frequens in Acharnensibus mentio."
Χόες was the name of the second day of the Anthe­ steria, and this is one of the many passages which seem to show (contrary to Boeckh's contention) that the Anthe­ steria and the Lenaea were two names for one and the same festival.
For the age of the wine would surely be measured from the date of the Lenaea when the wine was made ;
just as Theocritus (xiv. 16) speaks of wine τετόρων ἐτέων σχεδὸν ὡς ἀπὸ λανῶ, nearly four years old from the wine-press, that is, from the time of making.
In the Woman's answer here, I take σχεδὸν to be a qualified assent to the preceding question.
Ita fere est;
you are not far wrong.
It is three or four years old (she does not distinguish between these two figures) plus the time which has elapsed since the last Dionysia, that is, since the last Pitcher-feast.
"Fere tantum, et quantum effluxit tem­ poris ab ultimis Anthesteriis."—Brunck.
The Thesmophoria were celebrated some eight months after the Anthesteria.
This seems to have been a very fine bottle for its years ;
not like the diminutive flask of wine which an admirer gave to Phryne.
Tt's ten years old, lie said ;
It's mighty little for its age, said Phryne.
Athenaeus xiii. 49. The same repartee is attributed (Ath. xiii. 47) to Gnathaena who, like other noted wits, obtained credit not only for her own smart say­ ings, but for many others of a similar character.
And a kindred witticism is recorded of Cicero (Macrobius, Sat. ii.
3) who, when his host was pressing upon him some very moderate wine as Falernian forty years old, observed, It bears its years remarkably well (beneacetatem fert):
meaning that no one would suspect it of being so old.748.
μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τουτογί]
Not it, by Apollo.
The reading of the MSS.
and editions is μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τουτονὸ, which the Latin translators, Andrea Diva and Kuster, took in a similar sense, whilst Bothe explained τουτονὶ by τὸν ἀσκόν.
But Brunck, in revising Kuster's trans­ lation, saw that the words must mean No, by Apollo here, and Fritzsche, after suggesting τουτογὶ, was content to be­ lieve that Mnesilochus is addressing the statue of Apollo Ἀγυιεὺς, of which Pollux (iv. segm.
123) says, ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ Ἀγυιεὺς ἔκειτο βωμὸς πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν.
But the language of Pollux, πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν, shows that he is speaking only of scenes which represented the exterior of a house, and in such cases the προθύρου προπύλαιος would naturally be stationed before the door.
Such was the case, as we know, in the Wasps (see the note on Wasps 875) ;
and such was also the case in the line of Menander which Fritzsche cites from Suidas (s. vv. ναὶ μὰ TO) μαρτύ­ ρομαι τὸν Ἀπόλλω TOVTOV, καὶ -ray θύρας, as the last words plainly show.
And here too, so long as the scene repre­ sented the outside of Agathon's house, there would doubtless be an Ἀγυιεὺς at the door.
But now that the scene has changed, and we are within the precincts of the Thesmophorium, there could be no Ἀγυιεὺς for Mnesilochus to adjure.
And though the old translators gave τουτονὶ a meaning which it could not bear, I think that they were guided by a sound Aristophanic instinct, and that their meaning must be obtained by reading μὰ τὸν Ἀπόλλω τουτογί.
There is a similar confusion between τουτονί and τουτογὶ infra 880.752.
ὑπέρ ye τούτου]
In his stead:
like the δίκαιος ὑπὲρ ἀδίκων of St. Peter i. 3. 18.
She would sooner lose her life than her wine :
" potius vult amittere vitam quam vinum," as Bergler says.754.
σφάγιον] TO τοῦ αἵματος δεκτικὸν ἀγγεῖον, ὁ εἶπεν ποιητὴς (Homer, Od. iii. 444) ἀμνίον.—Suidas s.v., an explanation borrowed from, and doubtless represent­ ing the true reading, now a little con­ fused, of the Scholium here.
Eustathius, in his commentary on the above-men­ tioned' line of Homer, says, Ἀττικοὶ σφάγιον τὸ τοιοῦτον ἀγγεῖον ἐκάλουν.
And although Photius s. v., after explaining the word to mean TO ἀγγεῖον εἰς o τὸ αἶμα τῶν σφαζομένων ἱερείων δέχονται, adds πεϱισπᾶται ἡ δευτέρα συλλαβὴ, there seems no doubt that both forms, σφάγιον and σφαγεῖον, were, as Fritzsche contends, employed to denote the sacrificial bowl.
Pollux, as he observes, uses the two forms indiscriminately, Book x. segmm.
65 and 97, and Hesychius spells the word σφάγιον ;
whilst Fritzsche's own emendation of Iph. in Taur. 335, πρὸς χέρνιβας καὶ σφάγιον ἐξέπεμπέ σοι, seems at least as probable as Musgrave's πρὸς χέρνιβάς τε καὶ σφαγεί᾽ ἔπεμπέ σοι.
On the other hand σφαγεῖον is probably the more common form.
But here neither the μοι nor the τὸ can be spared.756.
ὕπεχ᾽ αὐτό]
Mnesilochus, prepar­ ing to drain the contents of the wine- skin, still speaks of it as a victim which he is about to sacrifice.
Compare Lysi­ strata 202.
The Woman therefore calls for the sacrificial bowl, which was held underneath by the priest to catch the blood of the victim, her object being to get for herself a few drops of the precious liquid contained in the wine-skin.
He does not object to her performing this part of the priest's duty, especially as he intends that every drop of the wine shall go down his own throat, and none shall fall into the bowl beneath.
To the Woman's disgust therefore she receives for her perquisite as priestess, not a drop of wine, but merely the empty wine-skin, the entire contents of which Mnesilochus has drained.757.
φθονερὸς κ.τ.λ.]
Grudging and unfriendly, for not leaving her a drop of the wine.αὐτῇ TOV ἀσκόν.—Scholiast.
Kuster refers to a statement which is found, in almost identical terms, in the Scholia on Wasps 695 and Plutus 1185, νόμος ἦν τὰ ὑπολει­ .760.
ταλαντάτη]
Another Woman now comes in, full of commiseration for this most unfortunate Mica.
Her name, as she herself informs us, infra 898, is Critylla :
and she remains on the stage till all the actors go out before the great dance-song, infra 947.
ἐξεκόρησέ σε literally means has swept or cleaned you out :
but here it is used as if from κόρη, has deprived you of your child.763.
λαβοῦσα Κλεισθένην]
Cleisthenes has already gone, supra 654, to tell the Prytanes what has occurred.
Mica will now go herself to invoke their aid, over­ taking Cleisthenes, and bringing him with her, as the recognized Women's Advocate.
Having thus adroitly shifted to Critylla's shoulders the duty of keep­ ing guard on Mnesilochus, she at once leaves the stage, and Mnesilochus com­ mences a soliloquy on his own alarming situation.
Observe that in 767 it is Euripides who has involved him in this scrape :
in 651 supra, it was he himself ;
but of course both statements are true.770.
ἐκ τοῦ Παλαμήδους] the Palamede of Euripides is said to have been ex­ hibited in the early spring of B. c. 415, together with the Alexander, the still extant Troades, and a satyric drama called the Sisyphus.
—Aelian V. H. ii.
8. Palamede was put to death by the Achaeans in Troyland, on a false charge of treachery;
and his brother Oeax, wishing to send intelligence of his fate to their father Nauplius in Euboea, hit upon the device of writing it upon oar- blades, and launching the oar-blades into the Aegean sea.
Mnesilochus do­ termines to send news of his misad­ venture to Euripides in a similar way, but the difficulty is that he has got no oar-blades.
However, he soon thinks of a substitute.
Massinger, in the Great Duke of Florence V. i, makes his prisoner write his sad story with a diamond ring on a pane of glass which he then throws out of the window.
778.776. ὦ χεῖρες ἐμαί]
It is impossible to say how much of this little anapaestic system is borrowed, or parodied, from Euripides, and how much of it is purely Aristophanic.
We cannot suppose that, in the Tragedy, Oeax was represented on the stage in the act of launching his oar-blades on the waves.
The deed must have been narrated in the speech of some Messenger, or described in some choral song.
Fritzsche gives to Euripides lines 778-780 (ἄγε δὴ—μόχθων), and 783 784 (βάσκετ'—ταχέως χρή).
With the Doricisms κείνᾳ ταύτᾳ in the last line Poison compares Eurip.
Hec. 163 ποίαν, ἢ ταύταν ἢ κείναν, στείχω ;
Probably the first three words, ὦ χεῖρες ἐμαὶ, are also Euripidean, and are to be considered as standing apart, so that Aristophanes felt himself justified in commencing the next line with a vowel.
On the other hand, Euripides could have had nothing to do with the play on words which, as Fritzsche observes, runs through the passage :
χεῖρες, ἐγχειρεῖν ;
μόχθων, μοχ­ θηρόν ;
πορίμῳ and πόρον supra 769.
For ἔργον πόριμον, to quote the same com­ mentator, means in this passage "faci­ nus, quod πόρον, viam salutis ostendat."781. τὸ ῥῶ].
This R.
He has got to the third letter of his friend's name, according to the Scholiasts :
ὡς Εὐριπίδην γράφων, ἐν ᾦ τὸ p, says one ;
and another, ἐν τῷ γράφειν τὸ τοῦ Εὐριπίδου ὄυομα, τοῦτό φησιν.
The words which follow, χώρει, χώρει, are supposed by Fritzsche to be part of the message to Euripides, Mnesi­ lochus repeating aloud what he is writing ;
veni, veni, Euripides.
But χώρει would not mean veni ;
and Enger is no doubt right in thinking them to be addressed to the σμίλη with which he is cutting his message on the wood.
Move on, move on, he says, as he carefully guides the instrument over the surface ;
but presently it makes too deep or too prolonged a cut, and he can only exclaim ποίαν αὔλακα (subaud. χωρεî) ;
There's a furrow for you.
When he has finished, he flings the tablets hither and thither about the stage.785. ἡμεîς τοίνυν].
Here follows, if not the last Parabasis proper which Aristo­ phanes ever wrote, at all events the latest which has survived.
The introductory line is, or does duty for, the Commation.
In general, before the Parabasis com­ mences, all the actors are withdrawn from the stage, and when it concludes, we are confronted with an entirely new scene.
Here however Mnesilochus is, apparently, unable to leave, and Cri­ tylla remains to guard him ;
and conse­ quently the Parabasis marks no change in the position of the actors ;
and when it is over, the thread is taken up un­ broken.787.
ἐσμὲν κακόν]
They may well de­ clare that everybody says so, for the maxim κακὸν γυναîκες had been a common- place with the poets from the earliest time.
The very first words of Comedy that have come down to us are
And it would be easy to frame an ample catena of similar libels on womankind from the poets who flourished both before and after the time of Susarion.
Bergler thinks that the repetition of κακὸν in the passage before us is pointed at the speech of Hippolytus (Eur. Hipp. 616, 617, and 625-631), where indeed the changes are rung on κακὸν (as a description of women) through several lines.790.
μήτ'ἐξελθεîν]
That married women, as well as maidens, were ex­ pected, as a general rule, to keep within the precincts of the house, is of course well known.
The αὔλειος θύρα, or outer door, was the limit for the former ;
the μέσαυλος, or inner door, the limit for the latter.
Menander (in Stobaeus 74. 11) says, Meineke, as others had done before him, refers these lines to the 'Ιέρεια of Menan­ der, and in commenting upon them cites from Philo de Legg.
Spec. p. 803 c the statement given above as to the limits within which married women and maidens respectively were accustomed to keep themselves.795.
παίζουσαι]
That is, as Fritzsche suggests, in some festal ceremony, infra 947, 983.
He translates the passage, Atque si domi alinae obdormiverimus diem agentes festum lusuque fatigatae, unusquisque hoc malum(uxorem) quaerit, lectos circumiens.797.
ζητεîτε θεᾶσ θαι]
The alteration, universally accepted, of the manuscript ζητεîτὸκακὸν τεθεᾶσθαι into TO κακὸν ζητεîε θεᾶσθαι is due to the late Bishop Kaye, a very excellent scholar.
On Porson's death, it was doubtful whether Monk (afterwards Bishop of Gloucester), Kaye, or Dobree, would be selected to fill the vacant chair.
Monk was chosen, and Kaye was made Regius Professor of Divinity and afterwards became Bishop of Lincoln.
His name was a puzzle to Fritzsche, who says ”Dobraeus breviter, ut solet, Lege cum J. Kaye τὸ κακὸν ζητεîε θεᾶσθσθαι.
Moriar,si hunc Criticum J. Kaye, niger anne albus sit, notum habeo.
”804. Ναυσιμάχης K. T. X.]
They bring forward for comparison five female names, Nausimache, Salabaccho, Aristo­ mache, Stratonice, and Eubule.
Sala­ baccho, we know, was a bold and vulgar courtezan, but, notwithstanding the guesses of the Scholiast, there is no reason for placing any of the others in the same category.
They stand on quite a different footing.
It is for her character, not for her name, that she is intro­ duced ;
the others are selected solely for their names, and possibly are not in­ tended to represent any particular indi­ viduals.
The name Nausimache signifies a Naval engagement ;
and Charminus, a well-known Athenian officer of the day, is said to be unequal to Nausimache, Ναυσιμάχηςἥττων, in reference to his defeat, ἧτταν, in a naval engagement which occurred off the little island of Syme about a year before the exhibition of this Play.
He was stationed there with a squadron of twenty Athenian ships, to intercept some Peloponnesian reinforcements, sailing northward ;
when the entire Peloponnesian fleet, moving southward from Miletus, sud­ denly resolved to swoop down upon Syme, and attempt to surprise him there.
They arrived unseen at the other side of the islet, but in the night, which was wet and dark, some ships became detached from the main body, and at daybreak were fully visible to Charminus.
Thinking them to be the reinforcements for which he was lying in wait, he immediately attacked them with vigour and success ;
when suddenly the whole Peloponnesian fleet came swinging round the corner of the island, and began to close him in on every side ;
so that he was glad to escape with the loss of six Athenian vessels:
Thuc. viii. 41, 42. It was plain therefore, from what actually happened (δῆλα δὲ τἄργα), say the Chorus, that Charminus was not equal to Nausimache.805.
Σαλαβακχοῦς]
This is not the first time that this notorious πόρνη has been compared with, and pronounced supe­ rior to, a violent and unprincipled demagogue.
In Knights 765 Cleon ranks himself next in merit to Lysicles, Cynna, and Salabaccho ;
and here she holds a similar position in respect of Cleophon, the leading demagogue of the later years of the Peloponnesian War.
It was not however until some months after the exhibition of this Play that he commenced his fatal policy of inducing the Demus to reject every overture of peace from the Pelopon­ nesian Confederacy.806. 'Αριστομάχην]
They identify the names of 'Αριστομάχη and Στρατνίκη with the victory of Marathon, with which, they say, no mail would venture to com­ pete.
The words χρόνου πολλοῦ are usually connected with ἐγχειρεî, restrum a longo jam tempore
He conatur quidem certare ;
but having regard to their position, it seems more reasonable to treat them as genitives of Age (as one says, " a man ἐτῶν τριάκοντα ”), the famous battle of long ago.808.
Εὐβούλης]
This is an allusion to the tame surrender by the popularly elected Council of Five Hundred of their high offices of state to the usurping Four Hundred ;
an event which, like the defeat of Charminus, took place about a year before the exhibition of the present Play.
On this subject, and its bearing on the date of the Thesmo­ phoriazusae, the reader is referred to the Introduction.
In the name Εὐβούλη there is of course a play on the words βουλείαν, βουλευτής.
And possibly the speaker is referring to Eubule, one of the three daughters of Leos (τοῦ Λεὼ κόραι), who died to save Athens in her hour of peril, and in whose honour the grateful Athenians erected the Λεωκόριον, the fane of the daughters of Leos.
See Aelian Y. H. xii. 28 and the Commen­ tators there.
And certainly the sacrifice of Eubule and her sisters would furnish a striking contrast to the pusillanimity of the Five Hundred.
809.
οὐδ' αὐτός]
The speaker, as has frequently been observed, is singling out and addressing some one of the Five Hundred, who was sitting as a spectator in the theatre.
It must be remembered that the oligarchic Four Hundred had by this time disappeared, and the popular Council had been reinstated in its former position.811.
οὐδ' ἂν κλέψασα K. τ. λ.]
"Nor will a Woman come driving in a carriage and pair to the Acropolis" (as, she implies, Men do), " having filched from the public treasury 50 talents at a time."
Fritzsche thinks that the taunt is levelled at Peisander, and doubtless he was a notable offender in this line:
see Lysistrata 490.
On κατὰ πεντήκοντα τάλαντα (cf. Wasps 669) the Scholiast remarks, οὐκεἶπεν πεντήκοντα, ἀλλὰ κατὰ πεντήκοντα, τὸ συνεχὲς ἐκφαίνων.812.
ἐς πόλιν ἔλθοι] ἀπὸ συμμάχων ἢ στρατείας. — Scholiast.
And as his explanation is quoted by the Com­ mentators without a word of dissent, 1 presume that they acquiesce in it.
But it seems clearly wrong.
πόλις means the Acropolis ;
and the expression ζεύγει ἐς πόλιν ἔλθοι is exactly equivalent to the ἅρμ' ἐλαύνῃς πρὸς πόλιν of Clouds 69.813.
φορμόν]
A basket, that is, a basket­ ful.
We have the diminutive φορμὶς in Wasps 58.
The words φορμὸν πυρῶν τἀνδρὸς κλέψασα are, I believe, universally understood as explanatory of the pre­ ceding ἢν τὰ μέγισθ' ὑφέληται ;
" the greatest of her thefts is to purloin a basketful of wheat from her husband, and even that she replaces the very same day."
But though in my translation I have followed this interpretation, I very much doubt if it is the correct one.
It is difficult to understand how the wife could replace the wheat she had pur­ loined from her husband ;
and equally difficult, in this view, to give any mean­ in-, to αὔτ'.
For neither Bothe's aUTO familiariter dictum pro αὐτὸν,τὸν φορμὸν πυρῶν,” nor Fritzsche's " αὐτὰ ad τὰ μέ­ γιστα refertur " can be considered satis­ factory.
The passage seems rather to mean "
A woman does not steal the public money by the 50 talents, and spend it in sumptuous equipages ;
how­ ever much of the public money she may steal, she replaces it the same day, having (for the purpose of replacing it) pur­ loined a basketful of wheat from her husband.”
She replaces the public money by the proceeds of the private theft.814-829.
ἀλλ' ἡμεîς ... σκιάδειον]
These sixteen lines constitute the Pnigos or Macron.
The Pnigos, which is invari­ ably in anapaestic dimeters, consists in the Knights of four lines, in the Achar­ nians of six, in the Wasps and the Peace of ten, in the Birds of fifteen, and here of sixteen.
It seems impossible how­ ever that the longer systems can have been really pronounced, ἀπνευστὶ, with­ out pausing to take breath.822.
τἀντίον κ. τ. λ.]
They are going to prove their superiority to men by show­ ing how much more carefully they have preserved their mothers' belongings, than the men have preserved what their fathers left them ;
“
We are still using, they say, “the ἀντίον, the κανὼν, the καλαθίσκοι, and the σκιάδειον, which our mothers used before us."
The σκιάδειον is an umbrella :
the other articles belong, two to the weaving, and one to the spinning, business.
They are all enu­ merated by Pollux, in his list τῶν εν γυναικωνίτιδι σκευῶν, and elsewhere, but without any explanation.
Eustathius however, in his Commentary on Odyssey xiii.
107, describes the ἀντίον as that ἐν ᾧ τυλίσσεται τὸὑφαινόμενον.
And in 2 Sam. xxi. 19 the words which we translate the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam are by the LXX translated τὸ ξύλον τοῦ δόρατος αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀντίον ὑφαινόντων.
And there seems no doubt that ἀντίον was the stout wooden bar at the top of the loom from which the threads de­ pended.
Κανὼν is any straight shaft or rod, and, as applied to weaving, signifies the weaving-rod.
Homer (Iliad xxiii. 761), describing Odysseus as running so close behind his antagonist in the foot­ race that his breast kept all but grazing the other's back, compares him to a woman working at the loom, who is always drawing her κανὼν through the threads, and yet keeping it close to her bosom.
The καλαθίσκοι are the work-baskets into which the spinning woman carded the wool.
Lysistrata 535, 579.
The σκιάδειον and κανὼν are, of course, selected with a view to the taunt about to be directed against the men.825.
ἀπόλωλεν o κανων]
The κανὼν and σκιάδειον of the men are quite different from those of the women.
The σκιάδειον is now the shield, under the shadow of which the warrior fights.
And the Scholiast explains κανόνα to be the spear- shaft, τὴν κάμακα τῆς λόγχης, τὸ ξύλον τῆς λόγχης, no doubt rightly, though in Homer κανόνες are the bars at the back of the shield, to which the leathern handle, or shield-strap, is fastened.
"But where are your κανὼν and σκιάδειον, your shield and spear-shaft ? ” ask the women ;
“ye have thrown them away as ye fled from the battlefield.” αἰνίττεται εἰς Κλεώννμ
ον, says the Scholiast ;
and cer­ tainly Cleonymus is, in Aristophanes, the regular representative of the ῥιψάσπιδες.
But the allusion here is not restricted to a single individual;
and many another Athenian shield, besides that of Cleo­ nymus, was vilely cast away in the dis­ orderly flight from Delium.830. μεμψαβίμεθ' ἄν]
The first line of the Epirrhema recalls the first line of the earliest Epirrhema extaut, οἱ γέροντες οἱ παλαιοὶ μεμφόμεσθα τῇ πόλει(Ach. 676).
In the Acharnians the special example of the injustice complained of is reserved for the Antepirrhema;
and there, as here, is introduced by the words τῷ γὰρ elIos, quomodo enim dequum est, how can it be seemly? (Ach. 703, infra 839).
There however the veterans have Iut one grievance :
here the Women have many.
With ἐν δίκῃ, δικαίως, Fritzsche compares διὰ κενῆς ἄλλως, Wasps 929 ;
εἰκῇ ῥᾳδίως, Frogs 733 ;
and other pas­ sages.834.
∑τηνίοισι καὶ ∑κίροις] ἀμφότεραι ἑορταὶ γυναικῶν.-Scholiast.
It was at the Scira, the Parasol festival, that the women in the Ecclesiazusae hatched their great conspiracy for seizing the reins of government.
See Eccl. 18, and the note there.
If the statements of the grammarians (which are collected by Kuster) are trustworthy, the Stenia were a sort of prelude to the Thesmo­ phoria.
They were celebrated, the Scholiast tells us, on the 9th of Pyanep­ οὕτωςΕὔβουλος. Probably the words εἰς To ἱερὸν have dropped out before τῆς Δήμητρ
ος ;
for there was no such thing as the ἄνοδος of Demeter ;
the first day of the Thesmophorian festival was known as the Ascent (ἄνοδος) of the women to the Thesmophorium.
The ∑τήνια took place on the 9th, the ἄνοδος on the 10th, of Pyanepsion, and prob­ ably in the night between those two days the women who had been celebrat­ ing the ∑τήνια were preparing for the ἄνοδος.
From the raillery which was banded about amongst them on that night, the word στηνιῶσαι (see Hesychius s. v.) became equivalent to λοιδορῆσαι.835. ἡμεῖς] that is, the Women.
And in the otherfestivals which we Women are accustomed to keep.839.
τῆς τὸν ἀνδρεῖον τεκούσης] τὸ ἑξῆς, ὑστέραν τῆς τὸν ἀνδρεῖον τεκούσης.—Scho­ liast.
With this suggestion of the Comic poet, compare the standard of precedence which the noble knights of mediaeval Christendom occasionally adopted and enforced in their jousts and tourna­ ments.
"
For in those days," so runs a fragment of an ancient author, cited by M. Guizot, "in those days when the land was at peace and joyous festivities were held, many knights, and ladies, and noble maidens would come and sit them down to see.
But if a lady or damsel of bad repute or blemished honour should have seated herself by the side of a virtuous matron or maiden of good re­ pute, then though she might be of higher lineage or a wealthier house, the loyal- hearted knights of that day would some­ times come to her in the presence of all, and would take the good, and advance her above the blemished (et de prendre les bonnes, et de les mettre an-dessus des blasmées) and would say to the evil­ minded lady in the presence of all '
Lady, let it not anger you that this matron or this maiden take the higher place, for though not so nobly born nor so richly wedded as you, yet is she of stainless honour, and therefore in the number of the good.'
Then the virtuous maidens would in their hearts thank
God that they had kept themselves pure, and were therefore held in honour and exalted to the higher place.
But those others sat with eyes cast down in great shame and dishonour."

We know from Clouds 552 that the mother of Hyperbolus was a favourite butt of the Comic writers ;
and one reason, at least, for their persistent hostility is disclosed in the passage before us.
It is plain that she made her wealth by money- lending, a business often profitable, but never popular.
Hyperbolus (Thuc. viii. 73) and Lamachus (Thue. vi. 101) were both dead at the date of this Play ;
and Aristophanes contrasts the rich and con­ temptible demagogue-the successor of Cleon, and the predecessor of Cleophon, less powerful and therefore less mis­ chievous than either-- with the poor but gallant soldier, who had fallen with honour in the Sicilian expedition.

The close of the Parabasis finds Mnesilochus and Critylla in the same place and attitude as at the com­ mencement.
He is still a suppliant at the altar of the Twain ;
she is still watching him there.
Ever since he despatched his tablets with a message for Euripides, he has been straining his eyes for some answer ;
but none has yet arrived.
Consequently he has become quite ἰλλὸς, cross-eyed, διεστραμμένος τὴν ὄψιν.

At the date of this Comedy, the Helen was one of the most recent of the Plays of Euripides.
It had been brought out, apparently, in the preceding year.
Here the Scholiast explains καινὴν by ὑπόγυον δεδιδαγμέην, quite recently exhibited :
on 1012 he tells us that the Andromeda συνδεδίδακται τῇ 'Ελένῃ ;
and on 1060 that the Andromeda was exhibited πέρυσιν, the year before it was parodied in the Thesmophoriazusae.853.
πικρὰν 'Ελένην ὂψει]
This is equi­ valent to our idiom, I'll Helen you.
It is the retort minatory.
The speaker catches up an obnoxious word used by the other, prefixes the epithet πικρὸς, and adds ἓξεις, ὄψει, or the like.
The idiom is as old as Homer.
When Odys­ seus, disguised as a beggar, is regaling the suitors with a fictitious tale of his adventures in Egypt and Cyprus, "Stand away from my table," roars Antinous, “μὴ τάχα πικρὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Κύπρ̇ον ἴδηαι," Od. xvii. 448. Aristophanes twice employs it in the Birds, 1045 and 1468.
So when in Lucian's Cataplus 13 Megapenthes is clamouring for prece­ dence in Charon's boat, on the round that he was a τύραννος, καὶ δορυφόρους εἶχε μυρίους, Clothe calls for a stick, and says, πικρὰν τὴν τυραννίδα ἓξεις, γευσάμενος τοῦ ξύλου. Cf. Id. Symposium 47.
And compare Euripides, Medea 398, 9 ;
Iph. in Aul. 955 ;
Bacchae 357 ;
Cyclops 589, and the epithet πικρόγαμος in Odyssey i. 266 and Heliodorus, Aethiopics vii. 28.855.
Νείλου K. T. λ.]
Mnesilochus, pay­ ing no heed to the woman's objurgation, at once starts off with the opening lines of the Helen of Euripides.
The first two lilies, and the first word of the third line, are quoted accurately, but for the Euripidean τακείσης χιόνος ὑγραίνει γύας he substitutes νοτίζει μελανοσυρμαῖον λεών.
The reader will find in the Introduction a full comparison of the actual lines in the Tragedy with their imitations in the Comedy.
Whether καλλιπάρθενοι ῥοαὶ are, as some think, streams frequented by beautiful nymphs, or, as others say, fair virgin streams, is a question which may be left to the interpreters of Euripides.856.
ἀντὶ δίας ψακάδος]

See Deuteronomy xi. 10,11 , where the Holy Land is contrasted with Egypt, as being a land which ἐκ TOO ἑετοῦ TOV ovpavov πίεται ὕδωρ.

but as Aristophanes has transformed the line, it becomes a singularly inappro priate epithet of Egypt itself.857.
μελανοσυρμαῖον λεών]
It will have been observed that Euripides in the Helen provides his verb with two accu­ satives, πέδον, plain, in the second line, and γύας, fields, in the third, not connecting the two by any copula.
Aristophanes ridicules this double accusative by changing γύας into μελανο­ συρμαῖον λεὼν, black-dosed people, so mak­ ing the whole passage absurd.
The μελανο- is intended merely as a contrast to λευκῆς ;
whilst -συρμαῖον is an allusion to the συρμαία, the purge and emetic which, according to Herodotus, the Egyptians were accustomed to take for three consecutive days every month.
κλύσμασι, ii. 77. But black-dosed In­ volves also a play on black-dressed, the σύρμα being a long trailing robe.
See Peace 1254, and the note there.858.
‘Εκύτηντὴν φωσφόρον] φωσφόρ
ος is a recognized epithet of Hecate, and as such is employed by Aristophanes elsewhere.
Yet there was always a certain quaintness about it ;
and as we are here dealing specially with the Helen of Euripides, it is not unlikely that Aristophanes is alluding to line 569 of that Play, ὠ̑ φωσφόρ ‘Εκάτη, πέμόε φάσματ’ εὐμενῆ. Hecate was specially invoked by women.
See Frogs 1362, and the note there.859. ἐμοί]
In the Helen it is ἡμι̃ν, but the sense is the same.
Mine is a father­ land nout unknown to fame, even Sparta ;
and Tyndareus was my father.
As a rule, the speeches of Mnesilochus before the entrance of Euripides are borrowed, with but little alteration, from the soliloquy of Helen in the Tragedy before the entrance of Teucer.861. φρυνώνδας] inemo veru, Phrynon­ das.
Phrynondas, though not an Athe­ nian, resided at Athens during some part of the Peloponnesian War.
He was a rogue of such superior and notable rascality, that to call a man a Phrynon­ das was equivalent to calling him a cheut ;
just as to call him a Melitides (Frogs 991) was equivalent to calling him a dolt.
Aeschines (against Ctesiphon, 137. p. 73) intimates his opinion that Demosthenes was far superior to Phry­ nondas in his distinguishing charac­ teristic.
And Taylor, in his note on that remark, to which Fritzsche refers, col­ lects the various passages in which Phrynondas is mentioned.
Aristophanes uses the name in a very similar fashion in his Amphiaraus, ὠ̑ μιαρὲκαὶ Φρυνῶνδα Kai πόνηρε σύ ;
and again in the Proagon, though the words have not been pre­ served.
Eupolis too more than once treats the name as synonymous with "swindler."
In Isocrates against Calli­ machus (66) the speaker, after showing how grossly Callimachus had perjured himself, concludes, ., For him to accuse me of lying is as though Phrynondas were to upbraid me for rascality."
So Lucian (Alexander 4) says that the man was the very prince τῶν ἐπὶ κακία διαβοή­ των, superior to Eurybatus and Phrynon­ das and other notorious rascals.
Eury­ batus and Phrynondas are frequently coupled in this connexion.
They are so by Aeschines in the passage cited above ;
by Plato, Protagoras, chap. 16 ;
and by Apuleius in his Apology (ii. 564, ed. Oudendorp), versutiam tam insi­ diosam, tam admirabili scelere con­ flatam, negabis to unquam cognovisse.
Quis Palamedes, quis Sisyphus, quis denique Eury batusant Phrynondas talem excogitasset ?”
Many other passages to the same effect will he found in Taylor's note.
Here the Woman, dis­ gusted with the knavery of Mnesilochus, declares that he must he the son of Phrynondas, the greatest swindler in all the world.
The Scholiast, after saying that Phrynondas ἐπὶ πονηρία διαβάλλεται, adds, τινὲςδὲ καὶπατέρα αὐτῷφασὶν ἀληθῶς εἰ̃ναι τοῖτον.
This last observation is of course quite groundless ;
Critylla knows nothing of Mnesilochus or his.

μὴ ψεῦσον K. T. λ.]
The Scholiast cites from the Peleus of Sophocles, μὴ ψεῖσον, ώ̑ Ζεῦ μή μ’ἔλης ὔνευδορός.
With τῆς ἐπιούσης ἐλπίδος, my dawning (literally, approaching) hope, compare Eccl. 105 τὴν ἐπιοῦσαν ἡμέραν, the damn­ ing day.
The expression ψευσθῆναι τῆς ἐλπίδ
ος is very common, and many in­ stances of its usage are collected by the Commentators here ;
but I will merely set down those which I have myself observed.
In Hdt. ix. 61, just before the commencement of the battle of Plataea, Pausanias, turning to Hera's temple, beseeches the Goddess μηδαμῶς σφέας ψευσθη̃ναι τη̃ς ἐλπίδος (Let me not be disappointed of my hope.
Psalm cxix.
116, Prayer-book version).
SoSophocles, Ajax 1382 ;
Xenophon, Hellenics vii. 5. 24 (of the tactics of Epaminondas before the battle of Mantinea).
But no writer is more partial to the phrase than Then­ doret in his Ecclesiastical History :
see I. vii.2;
IV,xix.16,xxi,10 ;
V.iv.4,xxxix.18.871.
τίς τῶνδ’]
Up to this point all the quotations from the Helen have been taken from the heroine's soliloquy, which forms the prologue of the Play.
That soliloquy is interrupted by the entrance of Teucer, whose first words are τίς τῶνδ’ ἐρυμνῶν δωμάτων ἔχει κράτος ;
Here, instead of Teucer, Euripides enters in the character of Menelaus, but his first words are the words of Teucer.
The two lines which follow are not borrowed from the Helen;
but the subsequent dialogue between Euripides and Mnesilochus to the end of 881 is altered from a dialogue occurring later on in the Euripidean Play, between Menelaus and an old lady who is keep­ ing the door of the Palace.
It is note­ worthy that no surprise is now exhibited by anybody at the intrusion of men—
Euripides, the Magistrate, the Scythian archer into the precincts of the Thesmo­ phorium.
It seems as though the cata­ strophe of Mnesilochus had operated here, as the introduction of the wounded Prince did in the College of Tennyson's Princess, where men, theretofore ex­ cluded, "out and in Walked at their will, and everything was changed.
"876.
Πρωτέας]
She need not be, but she probably is, referring to a real personage.
The Scholiast says, Πρωτέας ὕτωκαλούμενος ’Αθηναι̃ος, ὃς τπθνήκει πρόπαλαι ;
and Kuster's suggestion that she means the general whom Thucydides mentions (i. 45 ;
ii. 23) as one of the commanders of the Athenian navy about the time of the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, but of whom there is no subsequent record, has, not without reason, obtained universal acceptance.879.
πείθει τι τούτῳ]
With the first part of this line compare supra 592 ;
and with the latter part Peace 2.881.
ἐξώπιος]
This, as Kuster observes, is a favourite word of Euripides :
Medea 624;
Alcestis 546;
Supplier 1038.
But it is not found in the Helen, where Menelaus first inquires of the door­ keeper, whether Proteus ἔστ’ ἐν οἴκοις, and on being informed that Proteus is dead, and that his son is now the king, asks again που̃δη̃τ’ ἂν εἴη ;
πότερ
ον ἐκτὸς, ἢ 'v δόμοις ;
Helen 465, 467.882.
ναυτιᾷς]
The word is here used, not of actual set-sickness, but of the dazed bewilderment which the voyager may continue to feel, even after he has landed.
“Nauseo,” no doubt a transla­ tion of ναυτιάω, is used in precisely the same way by Plautus in his Amphitryon I. i. 173, where Sosia says "
Lassus sum hercle e navi, ut vectus hue sum ;
etiam nunc nauseo."886. τόδ’ ἐστὶν K. T. X.] τόδ’ ἐστὶν αὐτου̃ μνῆμα is in Helen 466 the reply of the doorkeeper to the inquiry of Menelaus whether Proteus is at home.
But, un­ like Mnesilochus, she is speaking the truth.
889.
τυμβήρεις ἔδρας]
This line does not occur in the Helen, but the heroine, before she has seen Menelaus, had re­ ferred to her place of refuge as ἔδρας τύφου.
We do not take up the Euri­ pidean dialogue again until line 905.S94.
ἐπὶ, κλοπη̃ τοῦ χρυσίου]
This is rather too bad of Critylla, for she knew perfectly well the real errand on which Mnesilochus had come, and that he had not intruded himself amongst the women for the purpose of stealing their trinkets.
This sort of theft, however, seems to have been common enough.
Cf. Ach. 258.
The next line appears to be a parody, but not of any passage in the Helen.
As to βάΰζε, ef. supra 173.898. εἰ μή]
These words are frequently employed to introduce, not a mere ex­ ception to, or qualification of, the pre­ ceding denial, but an affirmative state­ ment of the actual fact.
Aristophanes so employs them in Knights 186, Lysi­ strata 943.
Everybody is familiar with the New Testament examples, St. Matth. xxiv. 36 ;
Galatians i. 7, ii. 16. The woman is not Theonoe the daughter of Proteus, she is Critylla the daughter of Antitheus, who comes from Gargettus, now Garito, a village some miles to the north-east of Athens on the road to Mount Pentelicus.
It was a deme, as the Scholiast observes, τῆς Αἰγηίδος φυλῆς, and was in later times celebrated as the birthplace of Epicurus.902.
ἀνταυγεῖς κόρας]
This line does not come from the Helen, but is doubt­ less either borrowed from some lost Play of Euripides, or composed in imitation of his style.
The epithet ἀνταυγεῖς is susceptible of two interpretations ;
(1) sunlikeeyes, ἀντιμίμους ἡλίουτροχῷ, " eyes that do mislead the morn” ;
ἡλακὰς ἀκτῖνας, to employ the phrase with which Heliodorus (Aethiopics ii. 16) describes brightly glancing eyes ;
and to some extent like the ἀνθήλιον πρόσωπον, " the countenance flashing like the sun," a­ scribed to Athene in Eur.
Ion 1550 ;
(2) eyes meeting mine ;
τὰς κόρας σου ἀντι­ προσώπους μοι στρέψον, as the Scholiast explains it ;
and this is the general, and I think the right, interpretation.
So Empedocles (Plutarch, De Pythiae oraculis 12) says that the Sun, which obtains its brilliance from the heavenly light, And Ecphantus (Stobaeus xlviii.
64) calls the eagle ἀντωπὸν ἁλίῳ, just as Euripides (Iph. in Aul. 585) uses the words ὐντωποι̃ς βλεφάροισαν of the glances of Helen meeting the ardent glances of Paris.
αὐγὰς is used for the eyes in Eur.
Androm.
1180.903. ὑβρισμένη] ἐπιδὴ ξυρηθεὶς ἦν. Scholiast.
He remembers, for the moment, that Helen is the shaved and singed Mnesilochus, just as he remem­ bers, seven lines below, that Menelaus is really the market-gardener's son.904.
ἀφασία]
In Helen 549, 550 Menelaus says, δέμας δείξασα σὸν, "EK­ πληξιν ἡμῖν ἀφασίαν τε προστίθης.
But, as Bergler and Fritzsche observe, lines more resembling the present are to be found in Here.
Fur. 515 οὐκ οἶδα, θύγατερ· ἀφασία δὲ κἄμ' ἔχει, and Iph. in Aul. 837 ποίους γάμους φῄς· ἀφασία μ' ἔχει, γύναι.
The next line is altered from Helen 557 (see also Id. 72), whilst line 906 is taken from Helen 558 without any alteration at all.907.
'Ελληνὶς εἶ τις κ.τ.λ.]
Just as the commencement of the Choephoroe has been preserved only by its quotation in the Frogs, so this line has been restored to the Helen only from its quotation here.
It is absolutely necessary to the Euripidean dialogue, but had fallen out.
doubtless because the following line commenced with the same word 'Ελληνίς.
The transcribers of Aristophanes had been more careful, and Markland re­ placed the line in the Helen from the parody here.
The five following lines, down to ἐς χέρας, are taken from the Helen without any alteration except that mentioned in the next note.910.
ὃσα y' ἐκ τῶν ἰφύων]
To judge from those sprigs of lavender.
δέον εἰπεῖν —Scholiast.
Photius (s.v.) and Suidas (s.v. ἰφύη) also describe it as an ἄγρον λάχανον.
But this seems an error, arising from the fact that there is un­ doubtedly an allusion to the poet's mother, and to the ἄγπια λάχανα which she is represented as selling, supra 387, 456.
For Theophrastus, who frequently mentions it, invariably classes it with flowers, and not with potherbs.
In Hist. Plant. vi. 6. 11 he speaks of it as woody, and having a woody root ;
in vi. 8. 3 he says that it blossoms in summer ;
and in vii. 13.
7 he observes that the blossoms come before the leaves.
He­ sychius (s.v. ἴφια), after describing it both as ἄνθος and as λάχανον, adds ὃ ἡμεῖς Λαβαντίδα (lavandulam) καλοῦμεν.
And both Stackhouse, in his " Illustra­ tions of Theophrastus," and Sprengel, i. p. 86, identify it with the lavender plant.
Euripides would seem to be wearing some lavender about him, possibly a garland around his head, as Pierson suggests, in his note on Moeris, s.v. 'Αγυιᾶ.
The ἴφυον is mentioned again by Aristophanes in his Phoenissae.
Athenaeus iii. 39.913. λαβέ με κ.τ.λ.]
Here we part com­ pany with the Helen, and Mnesiloehus extemporizes a little series of emotional ejaculations, preparatory to his making off in the company of Euripides.
ταῦτα λέγει, says the Scholiast, ἀκολουθῶν αὐτῷ, καὶ βουλόμενος ἐκφυγεῖν.
In the Helen, it should be remembered, Menelaus does not believe that the lady is really his wife, though he is.
struck with the wonderful likeness ;
and therefore when she says, ὦ χρόνιος ἐλθὼν τῆς δάμαρτος ἐς χέρας, he exclaims, “ Wife indeed !
keep your hands off my clothes," ποίας δά­ μαρτος, μὴ θίγῃς ἐμῶν πέπλων.
However, in the next scene, when he is at last compelled to recognize her, Helen does indulge in a little outburst of delirious joy ;
, φίλαι, she cries, πόσιν ἐμὸν, ἐμὸν ἔχομεν ἔχομεν, ὃν ἔμενον ἔμενον ἐκ Τροίας πολυετῆ μολεῖν.922.
ᾐγυπτιάζετ'
Egyptianized, played at being Egypt,ians ;
referring of course to their previous conversation about Egypt:
but with a further allusion to the cunning craftiness with which the ancient Egyptians were credited.
The Scholiast says, ἐπανουργεῖσε· ὡς δὴ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων πανούργων ὄντων.
And the Scholiast on Clouds 1130, as Kuster ob­ serves, cites from Aeschylus δεινοὶ πλέκειν τοι μηχανἀς Αἰγύπτιοι (a line which passed lito a proverb, and is frequently quoted by ancient authors) and Theocritus xv. 47 οὐδεὶς κακοεργὸς Δαλεῖται TOV ἰόντα, παρέρπων Αἰγυπτιστί.
Many passages to the same effect are collected in Valcke­ naer's note on Theocritus.928.
μήρινθος]
An angler's line.
The speaker means that throw caught nothing," cf Wasps 175.
It is a proverb borrowed, as Brunck says, " a piscatori­ bus qui hamum retrahunt inanem."
This line, given to the Woman in the MSS.
and early editions, is by most recent editors transferred to Mnesi­ lochus.929. ὅδ' ἔσθ' κ.τ.λ.]
Cleisthenes had hurried off, after line 654, to lay a com­ plaint before the Prytanes about the misconduct of Mnesilochus ;
and Mica had followed him, after line 764.
And now one of these Magistrates enters to investigate the matter, accompanied by a Scythian archer (doubtless, until after he Choral song, represented by a Choregic actor), who was the proper minister to carry out his commands.
See the note on 654 supra.
They find the culprit hanging down his head for very shame at being detected by these officials in woman's clothes :
just as Demus, in Knights 1354, hung down his, when made conscious of his folly in times past.
And the words οὗτος, τί κύπτεις ;
were addressed to Demus there, just as they are to Mnesilochus here.930.
εἰσάγων]
Take him within, as Kuster rightly explains it.
See Clouds 1212;
Peace 842, 1020;
Eccl. 1037.
The Archer is to take Mnesilochus behind the scenes, and tie him to the plank ;
then to bring him out again, so tied, on the stage, and watch him there.
Mnesilochus is accordingly taken out after line 946, and is brought in again, bound, after line 1000.931.
σανίδι]
The σανὶς was a straight plank to which malefactors were bound, often as a preliminary .to execution.
Duris, the Samian historian, said that Pericles, after conquering Samos, carried the Samian trierarchs and marines to Miletus, and having tied them to planks, σανίσι προσδήσας, and exposed them for ten days, had their brains beaten out with cudgels;
but Plutarch (Pericles 28), who records the statement, does not believe a word of it.
So when Brutus condemned to death his own sons, and the other youths who were conspiring to bring back the Tarquins, “ stabant deligati ad palum nobilissimi juvenes :
missique lictores ad sumendum supplicium nudatos virgis caedunt, se­ curique feriunt,” Livy ii.
5. The plank was fixed perpendicularly in the ground ;
the culprit was in front with his back to the plank ;
and the process does not seem to have been painful in itself, though, like our pillory, it would become so by exposure to the sun and storms.
So long as Mnesilochus was personating Helen, it was appropriate that he should have been sitting on the altar of his own free will :
but now that he is to represent Andromeda chained to the rock, it is desirable that he should appear as a helpless victim tied to the plank.935.
ἱστιορράφος]
Literally, a sail­ stitcher.
ἐπεὶ ἄνω αἰγυπτιάζειν αὐτοὺς ἔφη, οἱ δὲ Αἰγύπτιοι λινοποιοί εἰσιν.
o πανοῦργος, ἀπὸ μεταφορᾶς τῶν τὰ ἄρμενα (ship-tackle) ῥαπτόντων.—Scholiast.
The verb ῥάπτειν is very commonly employed in relation to weaving plots and conspiracies, and Bergler thinks that ἱστιορράφ
ος is a play on the word μηχανορράφος with a con­ temptuous allusion to the shipwrecked stranger (873 supra) as a sailor of the lowest class.
But I suspect that in the colloquial language of the day ἱστιορ­ ράφος had come to mean a spinner of yarns, a romancer, a man who, to borrow Cleveland's description of Claud Halcro in the twelfth chapter of The Pirate, "spins as tough a yarn as ever an old man-of-war's man twisted on the watch at midnight.
"937. κοίλην προτείνειν]
To hold out, hollowed for the purpose of receiving coin.
According to Suetonius (Oct. xci), Au­ gustus was impelled by a nightly vision to beg alms of the people one day every year, “cavammanum asses porrigentibus praebens."
And Vespasian, when told that a large sum of money had been voted for his statue, held out his hand, and said that he should like to have the money instead.
His action is described by Suetonius (Vesp. xxiii) as " cavam manum ostentans," and by Dio Cassius lxxi. 14) προέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα.
The venality of the Prytanes has already been sati­ rized (Peace 908, see the note there).
And the last four words of the present line are repeated from Clouds 98.942.
ἑστιῶν]
While I am furnishing them with a dinner.946.
σωτηρίας]
All the Actors now leave the stage;
the Archer takes Mnesilochus away ;
and the Prytanis and Critylla severally depart.
To prevent the monotony which might be felt if the travesty of the Helen were followed im­ mediately by the travesty of the Andro­ meda, Aristophanes interposes between the two a dancing-song of considerable length, which combines at least three distinct dances, (1) the ring-dance, (2) the διπλῆ, a stately dance of Tragedy, and (3) a lively Bacchic evolu­ tion.947.

These are the ὄργια σεμνὰ which Demeter in­ stituted before she returned to her proper place within the Halls of Olympus ;
ἐπέφραδεν ὄργια πᾶσιν Σεμνά.
Homeric Hymn to Demeter 476.
And see infra 1151.
This Chorus, if we except the allusion to Pauson in the anapaestic dimeters, and possibly the stanzas in honour of Dionysus at the end, is ap­ parently a genuine representation of the service of dance and song which the Athenian women were accustomed to render at the Thesmophorian festival.
It is an invocation to the deities who preside over the pursuits and pleasures of their country homes ;
to Apollo the minstrel Archer, Artemis the huntress, and Hera the marriage Queen;
and again, to Pan and the Nymphs, and the pastoral Hermes;
and finally to the Wine-god Bacchus, into whose train both Pan and the nymphs were ulti­ mately absorbed.
We miss in the invo­ cation the names of the Twain, and the great name of Athene ;
but to these three goddesses a special hymn is appro­ priated infra 1136.949.
Παύσων]
They are sure that Pauson will keep a strict fast on the Νηστεία, “ non ex religione quadam, Red quia non habet quod comedat," as Bergler ob­ serves.
This Pauson was an animal- painter, of small means and less cha­ racter.
Aristophanes in his first extant play calls him Παύσων o παμπόνηρος (Ach. 854), and in his last extant play " the messmate, ξύσιτος, of Poverty" (Plutus 602).
He is such a devotee of fasting, the Chorus go on to say, that he will without intermission (ἐκ τῶν ὡρῶν ἐς τὰς ὥρας, from one season to another) pray the Twain that such ob­ servances may frequently fall to his lot.954.
is κύκλον] “ Describitur hic chorea, quae fiebat in orbem, et consertis mani­ bus.”— Kuster.
The four-and-twenty persons of the Chorus form themselves into one great ring, and, all joining hands, dance round and round the Thymele in the orchestra, after the fashion of the old English dance “round the mulberry-bush."
This was a wild and romping dance (χορομανὴς τρόπος) unsuitable for sacred hymns ;
and ac­ cordingly they discontinue it for a more sober movement before they actually commence the religious invocation.960.

It would perhaps be wrong to call them anti­ strophical, for the ring-dance did not easily lend itself to the movements of strophe and antistrophe.967. ὡςἐπ'ἔργον ῳ'δικόν]
The manuscript and common reading ὥσπερ ἔργον αὖ Tt καινὸν satisfies neither the sense nor the metre ;
nor am I sure that Hermann's οἷσπερ ἔργον, αὐτίκα, or Dindorf's ὥσπερ ἔργον αὐτίκα, is an improvement in either particular.
The Scholiast's comment is ἐπειδὴ μέλλουσιν ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν ᾠδὴν, and the emendation that I have made gives the right sense and the right metre ;
though it is too prosaic to be introduced into the text without brackets.
The meaning is, But ice must needs stay the graceful movement of the prettily circling dance, in preparation for the business of the odes.
στῆσαι βάσιν is sistere gradum, to stop the movement.
Yet strange to say the Commentators generally have taken it to mean the reverse.
Kuster explains it " rhythmice et in numerum terrain pedibus pulsare," and Fritzsche “cito te oportet primum in orbem sal­ tare itaque novam praeparare choream.
”969. πρόβαινε ποσί]
They are no longer to move in a circle.
They are to move forward, in a solemn and stately measure (the Tragic διπλῆ) befitting a religious strophe and anti strophe.
Three deities are invoked in each hymn.
In the strophe o Πύθιος Εὐλύρας 'Απόλλων (Eur. Alc. 571), "Αρτεfits, and "Hpa τελεία are proposed as the objects of prayer.
γάμων γινομένη.— Scholiast.
See Ruhn­ ken's Timaeus, s.v. προτέλεια. Τελείους τοὺς γεγαμηκότας καλοῦσι.
—Photius.
And so Hesychius, Pollux, and others.
For the Greeks did not consider an un­ married man τέλειος, complete and ful­ filled in his manhood, or an unmarried woman τελεία.
The Hindu religious books carried it further :
" lie only is a perfect man who consists of three per­ sons united ;
himself, his wife, and his offspring.”
Manu. ix. 45.
And though “Ηρα τελεία is commonly translated “ Hera, the Goddess of marriage," as if it were merely the equivalent of Juno pronuba, yet in reality the name strictly means the matron Hera,” “Ηρα τελεία, Zηνὸς εὐναία δάμαρ (Aesch. Fragm. Inc. 89, Wagner).
Zεὺς τέλειος and “Ηρα τελεία are the paterfamilias and mater­ familias (Plautus, Amphitryon II. ii. 201) of Olympus, and all earthly nuptials derived their sanctity from that primae­ val and heavenly union, which was em­ phatically styled the ἱερὸς γάμος.
Hence to dishonour and bring to nought the marriage tie, is to dishonour and bring to nought those mutual pledges of Zeus and Hera (“Ηρας τελείας καὶ Aids πιστώ­ ματα, Eumenides 205) to which all hu­ man marriages owed their significance.
Hence too the terrible irony with which Clytaemnestra, punning on the name, invokes Zεὺς τέλειος to fulfil her prayers (τὰς ἐμὰς εὐχὰς τέλει, Again. 946) for the murder of her husband.
The very hymenaeal song, heard at every earthly wedding, was a mere echo of that which had erst been sung at the divine nuptials of Zeus and Hera.
See Birds 1731-1735 ;
Theocritus xvii. 131-134.
The dances in which "Hpn τελεία specially loved to disport herself were, we may suppose, those which were the regular accompani­ ment of a marriage festivity (see the note on Peace 1317), though indeed the sacred chorus of dance and song was the bond of union between heaven and earth.
The Gods loved and joined in it, above:
men loved and joined in it, below.
No Goddess was too great, or too digni­ fied, to take part in that great choral music of sky, and earth, and sea.
Here it is Hera who joins in the chorus;
below (1136) it is Athene who is φιλό­ χορος;
in the Lysistrata (1315) it is Artemis who leads the dance, ἁγνὰ χοραγὸς εὐπρεπής.976.
κλῇδας γάμου φυλάττει]
Keeps the keys of wedlock.
The expression " to hold the keys " of a thing, in the sense of having control over it, is as common in Greek classical literature as it is in Holy Scripture.
See Pindar, Pyth. viii. 5, and Eur. Hipp. 538-541 where
Love is described as holding the keys of the bride-chambers of Aphrodite.
The words ., at her girdle" in my translation are probably derived from Tennyson's couplet about England, She moving, at her girdle clash The golden keys of East and West, a couplet which, though first printed by its author in 1889, long after the date of my translation, and introduced by him somewhat irrelevantly into his lines
To the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, had been familiar to me for nearly forty years before from its occurrence, with­ out the author's name, in the introduc­ tory chapter of Henry Lushington's " A Great Country's little Wars," pub­ lished in 1844.977.
'Ερμῆν, Flava, Νύμφας]
These are the three Powers invoked in the anti­ strophe.
Pan, himself the ποιμενικὸς θεὸς, the God of shepherds and of sheep- folds, was also the recognized associate and leader of the Nymphs.
The Homeric Hymn in his honour describes him as And in the Anthology (Scolium 8) he is addressed as ὀρχηστὰ, Βρομίαις ὀπαδὲ Νύμφαις.
Pan and the Nymphs were the rustic deities of the country folk.
It would be easy to multiply examples, but perhaps the Pastorals of Longus afford the best instance of the extent to which their conjoint worship permeated the entire rural life of the Greeks.
In that love-story Pan and the Nymphs are.
everywhere.
To them the rustics sacri­ fice and pray ;
by them they swear;
of them they dream ;
their help in peril they invoke.
ὦ Νύμφαι καὶ Πὰν, exclaims Daphnis in surprise and delight, when he sees Chloe returning to her home.
The pair take pleasure in decorating the grotto and fountain of the Nymphs, and the statue of Pall beside the fir-tree ;
to that grotto and statue they run, so soon as the advent of spring releases them from their long confinement indoors ;
and finally when the lovers marry, they settle down amongst their flocks and herds, θεοὺς σέβοντες, Νύμφας, καὶ Πᾶνα, καὶ Ἔρωτα.
And Hermes νόμιος, the pastoral deity of Arcady, was hardly less closely associated with the Nymphs.
In Homer's Odyssey xiv. 435 the swine­ herd Eumaeus dedicates a seventh part of the meat Νύμφῃσι καὶ Ἑρμῇ, on which Eustathius remarks, δωρεῖται μοῖραν 6 Εὔ-
And on the present passage the Scholiast says of Hermes, ἔφορος γὰρ τῶν θρεμμάτων o θεός.
And indeed Hermes was himself the father of Pan.
In the Hymn to which reference has already been made, we are told that, at the birth of Pan, his mother fled affrighted from her grotesque and misshapen offspring, but Hermes took him up and presented him to the as­ sembled gods.
However, in Lucian's Twenty-second Dialogue of the Gods, Hermes is thoroughly ashamed of the relationship, and says to his ungainly son, " When you and I are alone, we will be good friends, but πατέρα ὄρα μὴ καλέσῃς fAE, ἀκούοντός γε τινός.”
Hermes is far the principal personage in this invocation, a fact which perhaps accounts for the use of the singular χαρέντα just below ;
but the Nymphs naturally attracted the greatest affection, and hence the epithet applied to them, here and elsewhere, Νύμφαι φίλαι, "the dear Nymphs.”982. διπλῆν] Ὀρχήσεως εἶδος ἢ κρού­ ματος.—Hesychius.
And Pollux iv. segm.
105 includes it amongst the τραγικῆς ὀρχήσεως σχήματα.
It was obviously a stately religious dance, but of its cha­ racter we know nothing.
As to χάριν χόρείας, see the note on 959 supra.984.
πάντως δὲ νηστεύωμεν]
But waht­ ever we do, let us keep the fast.
The manu­ script reading νηστεύωμεν δὲ πάντως is unmetrical ;
and modern editors adopt Bentley's suggestion νηστεύομεν δὲ πάν­ τως.
But such a bald statement of fact would be quite out of place in this little exhortation ;
and by a mere transposi­ tion of the words, without the change of a letter, we not only preserve the sense and the metre, but also restore πάντως to its usual position at the head of the sentence ;
see Knights 232, 799 ;
Wasps 603 ;
Peace 1194;
Birds 935 ;

Eccl. 704 ;
Plutus 273.985. ἐπ' ἄλλ' ἁνάστρεφ']
The Cory­ phaeus is exhorting the Chorus to turn to another strain ;
just as the Cory­ phaeus in the Frogs does in lines 382, 383, and 396, 397 of that Play.
For now the διπλῆ which superseded the ring- dance is itself to be superseded ;
and the dancers are to enter upon a third system of choral evolutions.
Now they are to sing of Bacchus and his train of attendant Nymphs, sweeping with cries of religious ecstasy along the hills and glades of his own Cithaeron.
Those hills and glades had witnessed the por­ tentous events which form the ground- work of the Bacchae of Euripides ;
the frenzy of the Theban women, and the tragic death of Pentheus.
But it is not of events like these that the worshippers of the Twain are thinking.
In their song Cithaeron is echoing back nothing but the joyous cries of religious exalta­ tion.
From the direction τόρενε πασαν ᾠδὴν, shrill every song, we may possibly infer that this Bacchic hymn in some way imitated the shrill cries of the enthusiastic Bacchanals.986. τόρευε]
Τορῶς καὶ τρανῶς λέγε τὴν ᾠδήν.
—Scholiast.
In the following line I have substituted ᾠδῆς for the unme­ trical and unmeaning ὧδ' of the MSS.and editions.
Βάκχειε is an adjective, agree­ ing with δέσποτα (cf. Frogs 1259).
The proper name (in Aristophanes) is Βάκχιος.990.
Εὔιον]
The great dancing-song concludes with a short strophe and antistrophe in honour of Dionysus.
The Chorus appear to break into the exhorta­ tion of the Coryphaeus, explaining the σὲ in the preceding line by a triumphant cry of Εὔιον.
Διός τε is Fritzsche's correc­ tion for Διόνυσε.
The καὶ before the Mother's name implies that the Father's name has already been mentioned ;
and the alteration brings the first line of the strophe into accord with the first line of the antistrophe.933.
νυμφᾶν ἐρατοῖς ἐν ὕμνοις]
Amidst (that is, accompanied by) the pleasant hymnings of theNymphs.
FortheNymphs, as has already been observed, had be­ come mere satellites, moving in the train of Dionysus.
See the note on 947 supra.997.
ὄρη δάσκια]
The same expression was afterwards used by Euripides in Bacchae 218.
And indeed the whole of that Play forms the best illustration of these little Bacchic odes.999.
κισσός]
It is possible that a hymn to Dionysus was really a part of the Thesmophorian worship ;
but of course such a hymn is more especially appro­ priate to the divine patron of the drama at the Dionysian festivals.
And the epithet κισσοφόρε in the prelude can hardly have been used, and the reference here to the ivy's clinging tendril can hardly have been made, without the thought that if the Play were successful, the Poet himself would become κισσ
ο­ φόρος, and be crowned with the ivy's clinging tendril before the audience in the theatre.
And hence, long after­ wards, Antipater of Thessalonica (25) said, even of the Poet's written Plays,1001.
ἐνταῦτα κ.τ.λ.]
For ἐνταῦθα νῦν οἴμωζε πρὸς τὴν αἰθρίαν.
Cf. Plutus 1129.
The Scythian, now represented by a Professional Actor, brings out Mnesi­ lochus tied to the plank, and it is im­ portant to bear in mind that he remains in that ignominious position (in the pillory as it were) all the time that he is acting the part of Andromeda and down to line 1208 infra.
On the words πρὸς τὴν αἰτρίαν the Scholiast says, ἀντὶ τοῦ πρὸς τὴν αῖθρίαν.
βαρβαρίζει δὲ ὁ τοξότης.
He speaks a sort of broken Greek, and we are not to look for any­ thing (from a grammatical point of view) rational or consistent in his jargon.
In the lines immediately follow­ ing we have ῖκετεῦσι for ἱκετεύσῃς, δρᾶσ' for δρῶ, βοῦλις for βούλει and the like.
And he is as destitute of aspirates as a London cockney.1003.
ταῦτα δρᾶσ']
Ἀντὶ τοῦ δρῶ.
τοῦτο δὲ εἰπὼν, πλέον αὐτὸν ἐπισφίγγει.—
Scho­ liast.
The ἧλος was evidently a peg which, as it was turned this way or that, would tighten or relax the prisoner's bonds.
The Scythian, be­ sought to give it the relaxing twist, deliberately gives it the other.1007. πέρ' κ.τ.λ.]
Φέρε, ἐγὼ ἐξενέγκω φορμὸν, ἵνα φυλάξω σε.
It has been observed that the Scythian occasionally, though perhaps not invariably, termi­ nates all the persons of the singular with an iota.
We find it in the first person here, in 1104 infra κἀγὼ λέγι, I say so too, &c. ;
in the second, infra 1102 τί λέγι ;
for τί Aeyas-;
and in the third, in 1176 infra κῶμο τίς ἀνεγειρὶ, &c.
The Scythian now brings out.
his mat, and settles himself comfortably down beside his prisoner.
1011.
Περσεύς]
Ἀντὶ τοῦ to?
Περσεύς.— Scholiast.
Euripides shows himself for a moment disguised as Perseus in the Play, with his winged sandals, and the Gorgon's head.
His appearance in that costume is a sign that he is coming as Perseus to rescue Mnesilochus as Andro­ meda, a character which the latter ac­ cordingly sets himself at once to assume.
The Palamede and the Helen have proved unsuccessful, and the third Play to be travestied is the famous Andromeda, which, the Scholiast informs us, was put on the stage at the same time as the Helen, συνδεδίδακται τῇ Ἑλένῃ.1014.
παρέπτατο]
Else he would not haveflown by:
" alioqui enim non praeter­ volasset.”—Kuster.
The allusion is to the πτερόεντα πέδιλα with which Perseus came flying through the air.
Doubtless in the Tragedy he entered flying by some special machinery, which is probably caricatured in the Comedy.
But he does not enter yet, and Mnesilochus com­ mences by adopting to his own melan­ choly position the Lamentation which in the Tragedy Andromeda sang before the entry of Perseus.
The next seven lines from φίλαι παρθένοι to ἐλθεῖν are commonly given to Euripides, and are so given in my translation :
but although this arrangement may add to the liveli­ ness of the scene, I cannot but acquiesce in the view of Tyrwhitt and Elmsley that Euripides does not enter as Perseus until 1098 infra, and that the entire Lamenta­ tion from 1015 to 1055 is delivered by Mnesilochus in the character of Andro­ meda, in accordance with the original transcript of the Ravenna MS.
It is most unlikely that Euripides, as Perseus, should have appropriated part of the Lament of Andromeda which was sung, in the Play, before the appearance of Perseus ;
the άπέλθοιμι in line 1016 can be uttered by Mnesilochus only ;
the term γυναι̑καιn line 1021 would be quite inapplicable to the παρθένος Andromeda;
whilst Mnesilochus would naturally com­ mence the part of Andromeda, just as he did the part of Helen, before the entrance of Euripides.1015.
φίλαι παρθένοι]
Παρὰ τὰ έξ 'Ανδρ o- μέδας Εύριπίδ
ου "φίλαι παρθένοί, φίλαι μοι."—Scholiast.
In the original the παρθέοί φίλαι are the Court damsels who form the sympathizing Chorus of the Play.
νεται.—Scholiast.
Andromeda pauses after the word λάθοιμι (or whatever was the corresponding word in the original) and hears her last few syllables echoed back from the cavernous rocks around her.
The MSS., like the Scholiast, read προσαιδου̑σσαι τὰς, and very wild conjec­ tures, ὦ πρὸς Αίδαυ̑ςσὲ, ὦ προσαυδω̑ σὲ, have been introduced into the text.
but Elmsley's emendation & πραοΫδουσα seems certain.
The use of a participle after κλύειςὦ is quite in conformity with Euripidean phraseology;
κλύεις, ὦτεκου̑σα τόνδεμα̑τερ;
Phoenissae 298, κλύις, ὦ κατ' αύλὰν άλαίνων;
Id. 1536.
And compare such passages as ἓλθ' ὦ δμὰ ξουθα̑ν γενύων έλελιζομένα Helen 1111.
The ται̑ς may possibly refer to the Nymphs, but more probably to persons speaking, like Andro­ meda herself, at the entrance of the caverns hollowed out by the surge.
As to Echo dwelling in the rocks and caves Fritzsche cites Ovid, Met. iii. 394 ;
Aesch. Per-;
. 393 ;
Eur. Hec. 1110.1021. ώς τὴν γυναι̑κα]
"Andromeda dix­ erat forte τὴν μητέρα " (but see the Scho­ liast quoted in the preceding note);
" Mnesiloehus τὴν γυναι̑κα visere cupit :
et mox, v. 1206, Euripides eum demittit ώς τὴν γυναι̑κα καὶ τὰ παιδἲ οἲκαδε.—
Tyrwhitt.
Mnesilochus everywhere, in a ludicrous manner, interweaves his own personal troubles into the Lament of Andromeda.
ύπερθανει̑ν."—Scholiast.
In the Tragedy, as we saw in the note on 1015, Andro­ meda calls on Echo to cease from babbling, and allow her to continue her Lament without interruption.
But in the present parody Mnesilochus calls upon her to assist him in escaping from the custody of the Scythian.
However Echo makesno response,and Mnesilochus settles down into an uninterrupted La­ ment.
The expression πολυπονωτάτην βρο­ τω̑ν is also found, as Fritzsche observes, in Hec. 721 (where again it is addressed by the Chorus to the heroine of the Play), and the same Commentator cites many other instances of the use of the epithet by the Tragedians.
Some recent editors have, without any authority, altered the word into the far less ap­ propriate πολυστονωττην, apparently for the sole purpose of making the line iambic, not observing that in this part of the Lament there is a constant inter- mingling of iambic and trochaic lines.
Indeed this line corresponds in every syllable to ὄδε γὰρ o Σκύθης φύλαξ, three lines below.1027.
έφέστηκ']
Stands guard over me.
The use of the verbs έφέστηκε and έκρέ­ μασεν, without any conjunction, is an example of the άσύνδετον mentioned in the Scholium on 1018.1030.
όρα̑ς ;
... νεανίδων] Πάλιν έξ 'Ανδρομέδας. — Scholiast.
Andromeda would say, " Not with choral dances, nor by maidens of my own ate, am I escorted to the house of lilY bridegroom."
But Mnesilochus, for the maiden's joy, sub­ stitutes the joy of an old Athenian dicast, " am I standing by the verdict-box with my vote in my hund."
κάπισταίην έπὶ τοι̑ς κημοι̑ς ψηφιζμένωνότελευται̑
ος is the prayer of Philocleori in Wasps 754.
Though the words in the text 'φέ­ στηκ' ἓχουσα ψη̑φον cannot, for metrical reasons, be the actual words employed by Aristophanes, yet they undoubtedly express his meaning.
The MSS.
have ψη̑φον κημὸν ἓστηκ' ἓχουσ', which is mere nonsense.
Some omit ψη̑φον but of course it is the ψη̑φον, and not the κημὸς (the funnel through which the ψη̑φος was dropped into the verdict-box, see the note on Wasps 99), which the dicast would be holding in his hand.
ψη̑φων κημὸν, the prevailing reading in the printed editions, is open to the same objection as well as to others.
The dicast would be standing beside the κημὸς, and holding the ψη̑φος.
It might be permis­ sible to omit κημὸς, which would then be understood.
The ejaculation όρα̑ς ;
if not extra metrum is extra metri leges.1033.
κήτει βορά]
Bergler refers to the Scholiast on Birds 348, where the words έκθει̑ναι κήτει φορὰν are cited from the Andromeda of Euripides, possibly from the very Lament which Aristophanes is here adapting to his own purposes.
We have already heard of Glaucetes in Peace 1008 as a glutton and eager devourer of fish ;
όψοφάγος καὶγαστρίμαργος o Γλαυ­ κέτης, ώς έν Είρήνη δηλου̑αι says the Scholiast here.
And Kuster refers to the lines from the Περιαλγὴς of Plato Comicus, preserved by the Scholiast on Clouds 109, Meineke (Fragm. Coin. ii. 652) imagines that the only reason for this nickname.
of Glaucetes was because the ψη̑ττα (turbot) was his favourite food ;
but no doubt the real reason was that the ψη̑ττα was itself a voracious devourer of small fish, crustacea, and mollusea.
See Yarrell's British Fishes, ii. 327.
And that it was considered by the ancients a ravenous fish may be inferred from Lucian's Piscator 49.
There Lucian (under the name of Parrhesiades), angling for the pseudo-philosophers with a bait of tigs and gold, exclaims,1034.
γαμηλίῳ]
Kut του̑τοέξ 'Ανδρομέδας. —Scholiast.
Andromeda bewails her virgin death, as Polyxena does in the Hecabe, Electra in the Orestes, and Antigone in the Phoenissae.
And many other examples will at once occur to every reader's mind.
The term δέσμιος, as " Hotibius " also observes, recalls the fearful spell chanted by the Furies in the Eumenides of Aeschylus 311-328, which was δέσμιος φρενω̑ν, άφόρμικτος, αύονὰβροτοι̑ς.
But here of course the immediate allusion is to the prisoner's bonds mentioned four lines above.1039.
άπὸδὲ συγγόνων] Καὶ raTa έξ 'Ανδρομέδας.—Scholiast.
Andromeda has two causes for lamentation.
It is bitter, in any case, to be exposed to the sea- monster ;
but still more bitter to suffer this calamity at the hands of her own kith and kin.
These last-mentioned sufferings are different to the first (ἄλλα), and contrary to all moral law (ἄνομα).
With her the reference is to Cepheus and her own family ;
Mnesilochus prob­ ably intends it to be understood of his κηδστὴς Euripides, though the word is not apt for that purpose.1040.
φω̑ταλιτομέμαν]
Supplicating the memo
What follows seems to show that he is referring to Euripides, and not, as many have thought, to the Scythian.
The Scholium says δεομένη] TOO βαρβάρ
ου, that is, the Scythian.
It proceeds, προ­ ει̑πε δὲ" γοα̑σθέμ', ὦ γυναι̑κες."
The latter observation is intended to account for the accusative ;
γοα̑σθέ με λιτομέναν.
And this is certainly right, the intervening words from ώς μέλεα to ἄνομα πάθεα being parenthetic.
The Scholium continues, This alternative construction has of course no special connexion with the reading άντομαν, and seems to be, with λιτοέναν, the true construction.1041.
φεύζουοσαν] Bewailing:
cf. Aesch. Ag. 1279 τί του̑τ'ἓφευξας;
where Bp. Blomfield cites from Eustathius on II.
xxii. 447 οίμώζειν, τὸοϊμοι λέγειν, καὶ φεύζειν, τὸφευ̑ λέγειν
I have substituted φεύζουσαν for the φεύζουσαν of the MSS.
and the older editions.
Musgrave (on Eur. Or. 1394) suggested φεύζουσαν, corn- . paring Bacchylides (Stobaeus 55.
3) παιδικοί θ' ὕμνοιφλέονται, and Virgil's "incendentem luctus," Aen. ix.
500.
And this suggestion is adopted by most recent editors.
But it is not altogether satisfactory :
the passages cited are not entirely in point, and if so wide a de­ parture from the MS.
reading were necessary, I should prefer to borrow χέουσαν from the parallel passage in Eur. Suppl. 773 (to which Fritzsche refers) "Αδου δὲ μολπὰςέκχέω δακρυρρόους.1046. ἔνθα γυναι̑κες]
No translation can preserve the inimitable brevity of the original.
And the proposal of G. Burges to omit these two words as a gloss, well deserved the Ciceronian invective of Fritzsche, " Quousque tandem abutere patientiâ, nostra, Burgesi ?
Quern ad finem sese effrenata tua jactabit audacia?
Nugari te non vides ?
errare te, falli, ruere non sentis ?
Ah, Corydon, Cory­ don— ! "
We cannot doubt, though the Scholiast gives us no assistance on this point, that the rest of the Lament is more or less parodied from the Andro­ meda.
The language is quite Euripidean.
The words, ὦ κατάρατος έγὼ, occur also, as Fritzsche observes, in line 839 of the Andromache.
On the compound άνέ­ πεμψεν see the note on 585 supra.1050.
πυρφόρ
ος αίθέρ
ος άστήρ]
The fire­ flashing meteor of Ether, that is, the lightning-flash.
In Soph.
Phil.
1198
Zeus is called πυρφόρ
ος άστεροπητὴς, and Herwerden would so read here ;
but the quaintness of the expression in the text is no argument against its authenticity.
On βάρβαρον in the following line the Scholiast says, διχω̑ςτὸν ἄθλιον, and Brunck reads δύσμορον here.
And it is probable that, in the Tragedy, Andro­ meda did in truth call upon the light­ ning to consume herself τὴν δύσμορ
ον.
But in the parody, as Fritzsche was the first to point out, Mnesilochus, while adopting the language of Andromeda, is careful at the last moment to divert the curse from his own head to that of his gaoler.
Of. supra 349.
For a similar transfer of a curse, see Catullus, xliv..20, where the poet acknowledges his fault in having listened to Sextius, promises never to do it again, and prays, that, if he does, a curse may fall non mi sed ipsi Sextio.
In order to preserve the point in the translation, another line should be added :
0 how they will chide me, and gibe, and deride me !
And 0 that the flashing, and roaring, and dashing Red bolt of the thunder might smite me in sunder The Scythian who lingers beside me !
where the "me" in the third line is used as in the " Knock me at the gate " of Shakespeare, or " Saddle me the ass " of the Book of Kings.
In Greek it should be not με but μοι.1054.
ἄχη ... πορείαν]
If these words' are to be amenable to any laws of grammar, they must be treated as, what grammarians call accusatives in ap­ position to an entire sentence, in order to express an opinion or judgment upon the contents of that sentence."
The phrases are certainly Euripidean, and are, in all probability, taken from the Andromeda itself, where they may have been either " accusatives in apposition," or little detached ejaculatory sentences such as are found in almost every Greek Tragedy, where two mourners are mingling their lamentations together.
To take one example out of hundreds, the speech of Helen τὰ δ’ ἐμὰ κατὰ μέλαθρα πάθεα, πάθεα, μα̑τερ, οἲ ’γώ.
(Helen 684) is a mere exclamation, having no grammatical connexion with anything which precedes, or anything which follows.
And the expressions " throat-cutting agonies from the Gods ” and the twilight journey close upon the dead" may have been similar ejaculations in the Andromeda.
The epithet αἰόλαν is by some translated speedy, but the Scholiast explains it by σκοτεινὴν, and the word is so constantly connected with Night (in the sense of variegated by stars), αἰόλη νὺξ, αἰολόχ
ρως νὺξ and the like, that it seems to have itself acquired the signification of “nightly.”1056.
ΗΧΩ]
The MSS.
prefix Εὐριπ. ἠχὼ, and the Scholiast says, ὑποκρίνεται Εὐριπίδης τὸ πρόσωπον τη̑ς ’Ηχοῦς.
But this, as Tyrwhitt observed, is certainly wrong.
Euripides was seen equipped as Perseus, supra 1009 ;
and he comes upon the stage in that character, infra 1098.
It is impossible that between these two lines he should make his ap­ pearance in a woman's dress, infra 1073, 1090.
And indeed, had he done so, Mnesilochus would have spoken a few lines after 1097, to give him time to discard the woman's dress and reassume the equipment of Perseus, but no interval whatever is allowed for that purpose.
Add to this that in line 1061 Echo speaks of herself as a personage distinct from Euripides ;
and I think that every reader will be ready to say with Dobree, "non puto Echûs personam egisse Euri­ pidem."
And, in truth, I do not believe that Echo appears on the stage at all.
The Scythian could hardly have asked Whence comes that voice ?
had he seen an actual woman in conversation with his prisoner, and the latter's allusion to a woman in the immediate neighbour­ hood seems to be merely a jest at the Scythian's expense.
It is very unlikely that in the Andromeda Echo appeared in a bodily form, and here too I believe that she was represented as vox et prae­ terea nihil.
It may be taken for granted that the voice was that of the actor who was personating Euripides, just as in the Frogs the Choreutae first sing the Frog-songs behind the scenes, and then enter as the Mystical Chorus ;
but that is a very different thing from the statement that Euripides is personating the Echo.
The two lines of the present speech were, in the Andromeda, prob­ ably spoken by some friend who entered before the entrance of Perseus.
The idea of Echo entering into a rational conversation is of course purely Aristo­ phanic.
1060.
πέρυσιν]
Last year.
ἐπεὶ πἐρυσιν ἐδιδάχθη ἡ ’Ανδρομέδα.—Scholiast.
So in the Prologue to the Amphitryo of Plautus (88—92)
Mercury says “Jupiter himself will act this Comedy.
Why marvel, as if it were something new for Jove to take part in a Play ?
Why but a year ago, on this very stage, the actors called on Jove, and he entered here to assist them " ;
doubtless as a ileus ex machinâ.
As to the bearing which this note of time has on the date of the Thesmo­ phoriazusae, some remarks will be found in the Introduction.
Sic enim locum hunc emendavit divinus Scaliger, in notis ad Varronem ;
quern nee locus hie Aristophanis fugerat.”— Kuster.
The epithet ἱερὰ is again given to Night in Eur. Ion 85.1072. θανάτου τλήμων]
The Scholiast says λείπει, μέλλουσα τυχεῖν, meaning, as Matthiae observed, that in the Tragedy the line stood θανάτου, τλήμων, μέλλουσα τυχεῖν.
Aristophanes purposely destroys both sense and grammar by appro­ priating the first two words only.
In the next line the Scholiast explains στωμλλομένη by φλυαροῦσα.1077.
μονῳδη̑σαι]
In the Tragedy, An­ dromeda is mingling her tears with those of her companions, and she says ἔασον, ’Αχοῖ, με σὺν φίλαις.
γόου πόθον λαβεῖν.
See the note on 1018 supra.
In the Comedy she is alone, and says ἔασόν με μονω̩δη̑σαι.
There is much chaff in the Frogs about the monodies of Euripides.
In.
using the masculine ὦγάθ’, Mnesi­ lochus seems to be making a little slip, unless indeed he is appealing to the actor as such.
For ὦγάθ’ cannot be ὦγαθὴ, as the Scholiast thinks (τὸ πλη̑ρες, ὦγαθή) ;
and there is no reason to believe that by any colloquialism, or otherwise, ὦγαθὲ could be applied to a female.1083.
σί λαλῖς;
]
For τί λαλεῖς ;
The Scythian suddenly awakes to the fact that his prisoner is carrying on a con­ versation with somebody.
That he does not see the other party to the dialogue seems plain from his questions, Whence comes thatroice ?
and Whereis the minx?
See the note on 1056 supra.
On λαλῖς the Scholiast remarks χωρὶς τοῦ ε γρά­ φεται´ o γὰρ Σκύθης βαρβαρίζει.1085.
σί κακόν ;
]
For τί κακόν ;
as supra 1080.
In the next line the Scholiast rightly explains πώτε TO πωνή ;
by πόθεν ἡ φωνή;
and adds θαυμα̇ζει τὴν ἠχώ.1089.
κακκάσκι μοι ;
]
Are you mocking me ?
There is no doubt about the mean­ ing, but there is considerable doubt about the verb which κακκάσκι represents.
The Scholiast thinks it a corruption of κατα­ γελᾶ̣ς, Bergler of καγχάζεις, Fritzsche of καταχάσκεις.1094.
οὐ καιρήσεις]
’Αντὶ τοῦ, οὐ χαιρή­ σεις.—Scholiast.
You shall not do this with impunity, you shall smart for it.
Fritzsche refers to Knights 235, 828, and Plutus 64 ;
to which passages may be added Acharnians 563, Wasps 186, supra 719, Frogs 843.
The old reading was οὐκ αἰρήσεις;
which Bothe defends on the ground that the Scythian, being half asleep, forgets that Mnesilochus cannot stir hand or foot, and calls upon him to catch the Echo. " Paene irascor Bothio,” observes Fritzsche, "cui 'somni­ culosus lictor ridicule Mnesilocho cruci adfixo imperare videtnr, ut aufugientem Euripidem corripiat.'
EgocitiusBothium dixerim somniasse, quam lictorem."
So, two lines below, the imperative λαβὲ is addressed neither to Mnesilochus, as Bothe supposes, nor yet to any casual passel--by, as Fritzsche suggests.
It is a mere formula of self-exhortation, like the reiterated λαβὲ in Eumenides 125.
τὴ μιαρὰ, of course, represents τὴν μιαράν.1097.
γύναικο]
The Scholiast says that these words stand for τὴν λάλον καὶ κατά­ ρατον γυναῖκα, but they seem rather to be nominatives, 0 the chattering and abominable woman.
With this, the Echo­ interlude is ended.1098.
ὦ θεοὶ κ.τ.λ.]
Euripides now enters as Perseus with his winged sandals ταχεῖ πεδίλῳ, to effect the rescue of the doomed Princess.
He is reciting the lines which Perseus spoke, when he first arrived at the rugged coast, whereon Andromeda was awaiting the approach of the sea-monster, ἐστὶ Περσέως (so Fritzsche for εἰς Περσέα) ἐξ ’Ανδρομέδας τρία τὰ πρῶτα´ καὶ λοιπὸν (Enger, with great probability, suggests ἄλλοθεν) ἐπέ­ ζευξε τὰ ἑξῆς.
—Scholiast.
Apparently all the lines come from the Andromeda, but the first three from one place, and the remaining line and a half from another.1100. τέμνων κέλευθον]
The phraseo­ logy is thoroughly Euripidean.
Kuster compares the first line of the Phoenissae, ὦ τὴν ἐν ἄστροις οὐρανοῦ τέμνων ὁδὸν, and the somewhat similar address to the Sun in the Poet's epigram, preserved by Athenaeus ii. 57 ;
and Fritzsche adds τέμνων κέλευθον from Rhesus 423.
Kuster also cites the Latin phrase secare viam, and the via secta of Lucretius v. 273 ;
and with the latter part of the line he compares τιθεὶς πόδα Rhesus 571, ἁβρὸν πόδα τιθεῖσ’ Helen 1528, and other pas­ sages.
The epithet ὑπόπτερον is specially appropriate to Perseus.
In the very pleasant narrative of Andromeda's rescue given in the Fourteenth Sea-Dialogue of Lucian, one of the Nereids asks But how did Perseus get to Libya" (where the Gorgons were) ?
And Triton answers διὰ τοῦ ἀέρος´ ὑπόπτερον γὰρ αὐτὸν ἡ ’Αθηνᾶ ἔθηκεν.
Φαλήν;
For Fritzsche is undoubtedly right in holding that πέρι is not the preposition (as the Scholiast and pre­ vious Commentators had considered it to be) but is intended to represent φέρεις :
cf. supra 1007.
ό δὲ Γόργος, says the Scholiast, γραμματεὺς, ἀλλὰ καὶ βάρ­ βαρος.
The latter description is probably derived from Birds 1700, βάρβαροι δ’ εἰσὶν γένος Γοργίαι τε καὶ Φίλιπποι. For, in my opinion, by “the writer Gorgos” the Scythian means the eminent rhetorician Gorgias of Leontini, who has already been mentioned in the Wasps and the Birds, and who was probably, at this very moment, a resident at Athens ;
and possibly a spectator of the present Comedy.
In Plato's Symposium, chap. xx. (198 c) there is a similar play of words upon the Gorgon's head, and the head of Gorgias of Leontini.
And it may be observed that Gorgias, Periander's brother, who is introduced into Plutarch's " Symposium of the Seven Wise Men " (§ 17), is more commonly known as Γόρ­ γος.
See Müller’s Dorians I. vi. 8 note.1104.
Γοργό]
The word is doubtless used by the Scythian merely as an exclamation of menace or derision, like μορμὼ in Knights 693, Theocr.xv.40.
"Est autem γοργὸ pro γοργὼ, quod adverbia­ liter accipio, ut alibi μορμώ.
”—Brunck.
Fritzsche laughs at this notion, but it is, I may observe, strongly supported by the fact that Γοργὼ, as well as Μορμὼ, was employed, as a sort of bugbear, to frighten children ;
τοῖς παισὶ προσφέρομεν καὶ ἡ Μορμολήκη Strabo i. 2 (vol. i. p. 51, ed. Siebentees).
εἰκώ τινα.”—Scholiast.
To the Scholiast's quotation scholars have added, from other sources, another line and a half .
See Mus­ grave Eur. Fragm., Porson on Phoe­ nissae 466, Bp. Monk on Alcestis 358. “ Verba sunt Persei,” says Person, "An­ dromeden e longinquo spectantis, quam imaginem esse ex ipso saxo, cui alligata est, sculptam sibi fingit."
The words ναῦν ὅπως ὡρμισμένην seem, as Bergler observes, to be borrowed from Herc. Fur. 1094.
Whether the answer of Mnesilochus comes from the Andro­ meda is unknown.
1107. ὦ ξένε]
This little prayer is the only contribution which Mnesilochus, who took so large a part in the dialogue of the Helen, makes to the dialogue of the Andromeda.
Aristophanes, doubtless for the purpose of avoiding monotony, prefers to rely here upon the farcical barbarisms of the Scythian guard.1114.
τὸ κύστο]
For TOV κύσθον.
Euri­ pides had described Mnesilochus as a woman.
The Scythian, waxing ironical, retorts ακέψαι τὸ γυναικεῖ αἰδοῖον, and therewith (to use the words of the Scholiast) δείκνυσιν αὐτῷ τὸ αἰδοῖον of Mnesilochus, which of course is τὸ σκύ­ τινον of Clouds 538, and not a γυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον at all.
κύστο is Scaliger's emenda­ tion of the MS.
σκύτο, which the Scythian could hardly have used, and which, be­ sides, gives us a spondee in the second place ;
and the Scythian, however bar­ barous his phraseology, is expected to conform to the laws of metre, μικτὸν is a barbarism for μικρόν.
περανεῖν.—Scholiast.
"Indicativo utitur Scytha pro infinitivo."—Enger.1122.
πεσεῖν κ.τ.λ.]
It is difficult to believe, with Person at Hec. 1010, that this line is taken from the Andromeda.
More probably, if not composed by Ari­ stophanes in the style of Euripides, it was borrowed, like 1130 infra, from some other of the Poet's tragedies.
The expression γαμήλιον λέχος is found in Orestes 1050, and has already been em­ ployed by Aristophanes in Birds 1758.1130.
σκαιοῖσι γάρ]
This line, as the Scholiast points out, is found in Medea 299, And Bergler refers to Athenaeus x. 43. 6 Σοφοκλῆς φησὶ,
But this is an obvious parody of the passage in the Medea, and cannot be rightly ascribed to Sophocles.
1132.
προσοιστέον]
He borrows the word προσφέρειν from 1130 supra, but applies it in a slightly different sense ;
a sense in which he himself employs it in Iph. in Taur. 112.
The expression προσφέρειν μηχανάς TItI is a metaphor, drawn from assailants who are bringing their warlike engines to bear upon a hostile fortification.
And therefore in the Clouds (479-81), when Socrates is inquiring into the intellectual character of Strepsiades, Strepsiades immediately exclaims in alarm
The engine "befitting" the gross and licentious character of the Scythian is itself so gross and licentious as to cast a dark shadow over the concluding scenes of the Play.1133.
ἐπιτήκιζέ] Πιθηκίζειν, to play the monkey, Wasps 1290.
Euripides now leaves the stage.
The line which Mnesilochus flings after him, though not actually taken from the Andromeda, is probably a reminiscence of the virgin's address to Perseus as he is going forth to do battle with the monster.
1136.
Παλλάδα κ.τ.λ.]
Euripides having departed to perfect his new device, Mnesilochus and the Scythian relapse into their former condition.
The action is therefore for the moment at a standstill, and the Chorus take the opportunity of singing a little ode, mostly in glyconics and dactylics.
It consists of two addresses ;
the first to Athene, the Πολιοῦχος of the City :
the second to the two Thesmophorian Goddesses, Demeter and Persephone.
One would have expected these addresses to be antistrophical, but it is certain that they were not intended to be so.
The hymn to the Twain is almost en­ tirely dactylic, and is singularly light and airy, even more so, perhaps, than the dactylics in the last song which the Athenian Chorus sing in the closing scene of the Lysistrata.
The hymn to Athene is more complicated.
If we omit the two bacchic dimeters, (1143, 1144), it consists of three glyconic triplets, though indeed the first triplet, having always a dactyl for its base, may perhaps be more naturally described as dactylic.
The -xopov in φιλόχ
ορον is merely a long syllable re­ solved into two short ones.
As to the application of this epithet to Pallas, see the note on 973 supra.1138.
παρθένον]
The late Bp. Words­ worth of Lincoln, in the sixteenth chapter of his " Athens and Attica," describes in a very felicitous manner the three famous statues of Athene in the Acropolis, and their influence in Hel­ lenic literature, with special reference to Knights 1169-1180.
And even in a passage like the present, possibly with­ out any express allusion being intended, the epithets are naturally determined by the same triple presentment of the national goddess.
The Παρθένος is the Maiden of the Parthenon :
she who τὴν πόλιν ἔχει is the Πολιοῦχος of the Erectheum ;
and the Goddess who alone is the manifest strength and bulwark of Athens is the great Athene Proma­ chus, the colossal statue of bronze, the point of whose glittering spear, and the crest of whose burnished helm, became visible to the approaching mariner soon after he had rounded the promontory of Sunium.1142.
κλῃδοῦχος]
The Keeper of the Keys;
the Warder or Chatelaine of Athens.
See Bp. Lowth on Isaiah xxii. 22.
We may conclude, from the use of the word καλεῖται, that this was a re­ cognized appellation of the goddess.
1143.
τυράννους στυγῦσ']
This is, very probably, a mere ordinary democratic compliment on the part of the δῆμος γυναικῶν.
Yet there may possibly be a reference to the downfall of the 'Four Hundred, which occurred a few months previously, and produced, Thucydides tells us, an unwonted harmony and good feeling amongst all classes of the citizens.
Thuc. viii. 97.1147. εἰρήνην φιλέορτον]
Festival-lov­ ing Peace.
The comedy of the " Peace forms the best commentary on this epithet.1148.
ἥκετε κ.τ.λ.]
This little hymn to Demeter and Persephone, even if its ideas are borrowed from the Thesmo­ phorian service, cannot really belong to the Intermediate Day, the day of Persephone's absence.
On the ὄργια σεμνὰ θεαῖν see the note on 974 supra.1153. ἵνα] "Οπου.—Scholiast. " Ubi facibus (inter faces) ostenditis immor­ talem faciem " Kuster.
Torches were a general accompaniment to the worship of Demeter and Persephone ;
and their δᾳδοῦχος was a very important official in the celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries.
1157.
ἐπηκόω]
In answer to our prayers.1160.
EY.]
Euripides, who has al­ ready entered as Menelaus and as Perseus, now enters for the last time disguised as an old music-woman, and accompanied by an actor dressed up as one of those ὀρχηστρίδες who were con­ stantly associated with Athenian revelry, and who were generally persons of in­ different repute.
See Ach. 1093, Clouds 996, Frogs 514-516, 542-548.
The dancing-girl is not represented by one of the three Actors provided by the State :
they are now taking the parts of Euripides, Mnesiloehus, and the Scythian ;
she is represented by a Choregie Actor, that is to say by an additional actor supplied by the Chore­ gus at his own expense.
Euripides does not begin to talk in his new character until twelve lines later, where the Scholiast says Εὐριπίδης ἐν σχήματι προαγωγοῦ γραός.1163. ταῦτ' ἐπικηρυκεύομαι]
He speaks as a belligerent offering terms in the ordinary fashion through a herald.
1168.
ἂ νῦνὑποικουρεῖτε]
Λάθρᾳ ποιεῖτε.— Scholiast.
What ye do in your houses;
how ye carry on at home in their absence.
1172. 'Ελάφιον] 'Εταίρας ὄνομα 'Εταίρας­ φιον, ὡς Χρυσίον καὶ τὰ ὅμοια.—Scholiast.
Cf. supra 289.
The reader must beware of supposing that these diminutives have any reference to stature :
they are merely pet-names.
1174.
ἀνακόλπασον]
Tuck up your skirts for the dance, by drawing the dress up, and letting it fall in a loose fold, κόλπος, over your girdle.1175.
ἐπαναφύσα Περσικόν]
He bids the piper play the accompaniment to the Persian dance ;
the music to which the Περσικὸν ὄρχημα was danced.
Com­ pare the use of πυρρίχη in Frogs 153.
The dance is described by Xenophon, Anabasis V. ix. 9 (cf. Athenaeus, i. 27), "Then," says he, " he danced the Per­ sian dance, rattling his two targes together, and he kept sinking down on his haunches, and springing up again, ὤκλαζε καὶ ἀνίστατο ;
and this he did rhythmically to the sound of an αὐλός."
This sinking on the haunches seems to have been the special peculiarity of the Persian dance, so that the entire dance, as the Scholiast here observes, sometimes went by the name of ὄκλασμα.
See Pollux iv. segm.
100.
The same dance is described by Heliodorus under the name of " Assyrian."
Καὶ τοὺς μὲν αὐτοῦ iv.
17. We may perhaps infer from this passage, coupled with 1217 infra, that while Teredon played the αὐλὸς, Euripides himself was playing the π ηκτὶς or Lydian lute.
Teredon seems, as Fritzsche observes, to be the name of a man, like Sarpedon, and not, as the Scholiast supposed, the name of a woman.
And indeed it is very unlikely that Euripides and Elaphium were ac­ companied by a piper of their own :
the appeal is doubtless made to the theatrical αὐλητής.
See Eccl. 891 and the note there.1178.
ὡς ἄνδρας τινάς]
That is, at some symposium.
1179.
ὀρκῆσι K. T. X.] 'Ορχησάσθω καὶ μελετησάτω' οὐ κωλύσω ἐγώ.
'Ως ἐλαφρὰ, ὥσπερ ψύλλα κατὰ τὸ κώδιον. " Scytha, qua est morum elegantia, Elaphium puellam eamque saltatricem mirabun­ dus, dicit tanta esse agilitate, quanta in lecto pulicem, eximium profecto sal­ tatorem."
—Fritzsche.
This is perhaps a little hard upon the Scythian's manners, for the dancing-girl, now subsiding to the ground, now bounding up, and whirling round with her whole body in motion, might not altogether inaptly be compared to " a flea upon a blanket."
Aristophanes was apparently the first to use this metaphor, which in modern times is not uncommon.
In St. Ronan's Well, chap. viii, a lawyer, speaking of the difficulty of catching a poacher, says "
A poacher may just jink ye back and forward like a flea in a blanket (wi' pardon), hap ye out of ae county and into anither."
And the same metaphor is employed at the end of the first chapter of Redgauntlet.1181.
κατάθου μέν]
I have substituted these words for the ἄνωθεν of the MSS.
and editions, which seems to give no sense.
It is plain that Elaphium is here directed to lay aside her upper garment, which she resumes in 1189 infra.
And for this process κατάθου is the regular word.
κατάθου ταχέως θοἰ­ μάτιον Plutus 926 ;
where indeed the next direction is (very much as here) ἔπειθ' ὑπόλυσαι.
So in Clouds 497 ἴθι νυν κατάθου θοἰμάτιον.
The ostensible purpose for which Elaphium is to dis­ card her upper garment and her shoes is that she may execute the evolutions of the dance with still greater rapidity ;
and Euripides accordingly calls upon the piper to quicken his tune, αὔλει σὐ θᾶττον.
But this is not the real purpose, and it is not even quite certain that she does in fact dance any more.
All this is merely a bait to beguile the Scythian from his duty.τιτθίον, ὥσπερ γογγύλη, firm as a turnip.1187.
καλό κ.τ.λ.]
Καλή γε ἡ πυγή. κλαύσει ἢν μὴ ἔνδον (sub reste) μένῃς. " Mutonem ipsum alloquitur," says Fritzsche, referring to Horace Sat. I. ii. 68, "mala ei maxima minitans, nisi quieverit."
ἀνακύπτει καὶ παρακύπτει ἀπεψωλημένον (scilicet TO πέος).
εἶεν. καλὸν τὸ σχῆμα περὶ τὸ πόσθιον.
Some think that these observations are made as Elaphium is whirling round in the dance ;
but I doubt if she ever leaves the Scythian after line 1182.1195.
κάρισο]
Χάρισο, grant me this favour.
δῶσι in the following line stands for δώσω.1197.
ἔκὠδέν]
'Αλλὰ οὐκ ἔχω οὐδέν ̇ ἀλλὰ τὴν σιβύνην λαβέ.
But I have not got any;
but take this bow-ease.
συβήνη is a barbarous form of σιβύνη, which here, as the Scholiast observes, is equiva­ lent to τοξοθήκη, the case which held the bow and sometimes the arrows also.
It was doubtless the only article of value which the Scythian had to offer ;
and he would naturally be responsible to the State for its safety.
And this is why he is so anxious to get it back ;
ἔπειτα κομιεῖς αὖθις, he says, you will let me have it back again, when I bring you the drachma.
τήρει. Keep an eye on the prisoner.
Μεμνῆσι, a line or two below, represents μεμνήσομαι, I'll remember.
The Scythian and Elaphium leave the stage, and Euri­ pides and Mnesilochus are there alone.
1202.
'Ερμῆ δόλιε]
It need hardly be mentioned that δόλιος (the God of craft) was one of the special appellations of Hermes, cf. Plutus 1157, Frogs 1143, 1144.
How worthily he earned the title on the very day of his birth, we learn from the Homeric Hymn in his honour.1203.
σύ μὲν ο̕ὖν κ.τ.λ.]
This derisive exclamation, like that in 1226 infra, is flung after the Scythian who has just disappeared.
"
You be off with the girl, and I will release your prisoner."
Tu igitur hinc proripe cursu, puellâ hâc sumptâ:
ego verosolvam hunc (Kuster).
So all the earlier Commentators.
Fritzsche, however, who is followed by the more recent editors, considers παιδάριον to be the vocative addressed to Teredon, You, boy, be off, taking this ;
the Scholiast ex­ plaining TOUT!
by τὴν τοξοθήκην, and, as an alternative, τὰ ὄργανα τῆς ὀρχηστρίδος.
The reason for this construction is that (to use the words of Enger) " παιδάριον semper puerum significat."
But this is a heresy against which the ancient grammarians with -one voice protest.
In other dialects, they say, παιδάριον always means a boy ;
in the Attic dialect it means either a boy or a girl, παιδάριον καὶ τὸ θυμάτριον 'Αττικῶς' παιδάριον, μόνως τὸ appell, 'ΕλΛηνικως.—Moeris ;
where Hudson cites demons Alex. Paedagog. 1. iv. 11 ταύτη μοι δοκοῦσιν οἱ 'Αττικοὶ. παιδάριον ἐπικοίνως οὐ μόνον τὸ appell ἀλλὰ καὶ TO θῆλυ κεκληκέναι.
See also Pierson's note on the same passage.
Photius says παιδάριον οὐ μόνον τὸ ἄρρεν, ἀλλὰ Kat τὸ θῆλυ λέγουσιν.
And so Pollux, Suidas, and others.
All that Fritzsche can oppose to this array of authorities is the feeble remark, that none of them state "puellam istâ voce saepenumero indicatam esse."
And indeed he himself admits that " per se παιδάριον, quippe deminutio verbi παῖς, non minus quam ὁ, ἡ, παῖς, tarn puellas quam pueros significare potest."
And doubtless it signifies the dancing- girl here.
Trot! ὁ γέρων ἐντευθενί;
The Scythian re-enters with Elaphium, to find that he has been a mere dupe ;
and that his prisoner, and the old woman who had undertaken to guard him, have, during his absence, disappeared together.1214.
διέβαλλέ] 'Εξηπάτησεν. ὁ αὐτὸς ἐν" Ορνισι (1648) " διαβάλλεταί σ' ὁ θεῖος." —Scholiast.
Incensed at discovering that Elaphium was acting as a bait to lure him from his post, the Scythian turns angrily upon her, " eamque," to use Fritzsche's language, "facessere hinc atque abire Morboniam jubet";
ἀπότρεχ' ὡς τάχιστα σύ. Of. supra 1203.1215.
ὀρτῶς K.T.X.]
'Ορθῶς δὲ σιβύνη ἐστί (it is rightly so called) ;
κατεβίνησε γάρ (for it played me a foul trick, that is, deceived me).
Or it may mean She (the old woman) played me a foul trick.
" Pharetram, quam συβίνην appellat Scytha," says Brunck, "ἐπώνυμον esse, recteque sic appellari dicit, vel quia, hoc pignore date, meretriculam ἐβίνησε, vel potius, quia ipse quodammodo κατα­ βεβίνηται.
Scilicet anus, accepto hoc pignore, os ei sublevit, eumque ludibrio habuit, quod verbo καταβινεῖν exprimit."
συβίνη, I may explain, is Brunck's alter­ ation of the MS.
συβήνη.
In the next line τί δρᾶσι stands for τί δράσω.1217.
τὰς πηκτίδας ;
]
The instrument called the πηκὶς, or the πηκτίδες (Pollux, iv. chap. 9), was a Lydian lute from which, according to Pindar (Athenaeus, xiv. 37), Terpander derived the idea of the Greek βάρβιτον.
Cf. Müller's Greek Literature, xii.
4. Photius describes it as a Λύδιον ὄργανον, χωρὶς πλήκτρου ψαλλό­ μενον. Herodotus (i. 17) tells us that the armies of Alyattes, the King of Lydia and father of Croesus, marched on to the sound συρίγγων τε καὶ πηκτίδων.
Athenaeus, in the chapter mentioned above, refers τῆ παρὰ Λυδοῖς πηκτίδι.
In the previous chapter he had cited from the Mysians of Sophocles :
And in the twenty-first chapter of the same book he quotes from Telestes :
And see the note on 1175 supra.1221.
ταυτηί]
That the Chorus have only succeeded in bewildering the Scythian is plain from the following line, 0 luckless me, which is the way she went ?
And Dobree therefore supposes that the τύτη in this line Indicates a different route from that which is indicated by the ταύτη of line 1218.
But it seems more probable that on each occasion the vague and inde­ finite gesture of the Coryphaeus left in doubt which exit he intended to designate.
1223.
ὀρθὴν ἄνω]
Straight up the hill ;
doubtless, as Bothe observes, pointing towards the Acropolis, on the side of which the theatre was constructed.
On ποί θεῖς ;
the Scholiast observes ὡς οἷαν ἀπῆλθον οἱ περὶ τὸν Εὐριπίδην.
Not­ withstanding the confusing directions of the Chorus, he has accidentally stumbled upon the right track, and has to be promptly recalled.1225.
ἀλλὰ τρέξι]
At interim currit Artamuxia.—Brunck.
But while I am delaying, Artamuxia is running, τρέι is the third person singular:
see the note on 1007 supra.
Some alter ἀλλὰ into ἄλλα, aliâ aufugit Artamuxia (Kuster), but this is no improvement.
The Scythian now runs out by the opposite route to that which the fugitives have taken.1226.
ἐπουρίσας]
"Scudding before the favouring breezes," "with the wind in your sails," secundis ventis, or, in other words, "as quickly as you can."
The second τρέχε νυν was added by Brunck, since the line is obviously an iambic senarius.

So that in very truth (referring to the words of Euri­ pides, supra 1189, wopa 'στὶ νῷν ἤδη βαδί­ ξειν) it is time for us to be going, each to her own home.
The MSS.
read ὤρα δή 'στι, which Bothe and others have cor­ rected into ὤρα δῆτ ̓ ἐστὶ, because we should here expect a full anapaestic dimeter, rather than a paroemiac verse.
And I have followed their correction for the further reason that δῆτα is almost invariably found in repetitions of this kind, as, for example, in lines 739, 740 supra, And in Peace 977, 978,And (to take an example from Tragedy) in Eur.
Electra 672, 673,Yea in very truth accept it.
Yea in very ruth have mercy upon us.1231.
ἀγαθὴν χάριν]
A good reward, by giving them the victory in the theatrical contest.
No record of the issue has come down to our times, but we cannot doubt that their wish was fulfilled, and that the prize was not withheld from what is one of the wittiest and pleasantest specimens of Aristophanic comedy.
THE greater part of this translation was composed from memory, when the translator had no copy of Aristophanes at hand.
Consequently, it everywhere departs from the sense of the original;
words, sentences, and even whole speeches have been omitted, transposed, or added;
actives are changed into passives, and vice versa;
and sometimes the English goes clean contrary to the meaning of the Greek.
It was completed from a copy of Bekker's Aristophanes, the text and arrangement of which differ widely from the text and arrangement of the present edition.
If therefore any critic should observe that there is hardly a line in the translation which represents the exact meaning of the original, let him remember that the translator heartily agrees with him;
habet confitentem reum.
Nevertheless it is hoped that even from this inaccurate version, a reader, taking the Play as a whole, may obtain an idea, not altogether inaccurate, of the Thesmophoriazusae of Aristophanes.
EURIPIDES, the famous Tragic Poet.
MNESILOCHUS, his connexion by marriage.
ATHON, another well-known Tragic Poet.
AGATHON'S SERVANT.
CLEISTHENES, an effeminate Athenian.
A POLICEMAN, really an important Athenian Magistrate, but in this version taking a more homely position.
A SCYTHIAN, one of the Scythian archers, the real Athenian police.
CHORUS of Athenian matrons celebrating the Thesmophoria, or festival of Demeter and Persephone as givers of home and social customs.
A CRIERESS.
SECOND WOMAN.
ECHO, heard but not seen.
HOP-O-MY-THUMB, a dancing-girl, seen but not heard.
Several Athenian women, attendants on the principal Women ;
amongst them, Mica's nursemaid.
THE THESMOPHORIAZUSAETwo elderly men are discovered, when the Play opens, pacing along an Athenian street.
In one, both by his gait and by his language, we at once recognize a Philosopher and a Genius.
His companion is a garrulous and cheery old man, evidently tired out by a long promenade.
They prove to be the poet Euripides, and Mnesilochus his connexion by marriage, in the translation inaccurately styled his cousin.
The latter is the first to speak.
MN. Zeus !
is the swallow NEVER going to come ?
Tramped up and down since daybreak !
I can't stand it.
Might I, before my wind's ENTIRELY gone, Ask where you're taking me, Euripides ?
EUR.
You're not to hear the things which face to face
You're going to see.
MN.
What!
Please say that again.
I'm not to hear ?
EUR.
The things which you shall see.
MN.
And not to see?
EUR.
The things which you shall hear.
MN. A pleasant jest!
a mighty pleasant jest!
I'm not to hear or see at all, I see.
EUR.
(In high philosophic rhapsody.)
To hear !
to see !
full different things, I ween;
Yea verily, generically diverse.
MN. What's " diverse " ?
EUR.
I will explicate my meaning.
When Ether1 first was mapped and parcelled out, And living creatures breathed and moved in her, She, to give sight, implanted in their heads The Eye, a mimic circlet of the Sun, And bored the funnel of the Ear, to hear with.
MN.
DID SHE !
That's why I'm not to hear or see !
I'm very glad to get that information.
0, what a thing it is to talk with Poets!
EUR.
Much of such knowledge I shall give you.
IN. (Involuntarily.) 0 ! Then p'raps (excuse me) you will tell me how Not to be lame to-morrow, after this.
EUR.
(Loftily disregarding the innuendo.)
Come here and listen.
MN. (Courteously.)
Certainly I will.
EUR.
See you that wicket?
MN.
Why, by Heracles, Of course I do.
EUR.
Be still.
MN.
Be still the wicket ?
EUR.
And most attentive.
MN.
Still attentive wicket ?
EUR.
There dwells, observe, the famous Agathon, The Tragic Poet.
MN. (Considering.)
Agathon.
Don't know him.
EUR.
He is that Agathon— MN. (Interrupting.)
Dark, brawny fellow ?EVIL 0 no, quite different;
don't you know him really ?
MN.
Big-whiskered fellow ?
EUR.
Don't you know him really ?
MN. No. (Thinks again.)
No, I don't;
at least I don't remember.
EUR. (Severely.)
I fear there's much you don't remember, sir.
But step aside:
I see his servant coming.
See, he has myrtles and a pan of coals
To pray, methinks, for favourable rhymes.
(The two retire into the background.
Agathon's servant enters from the house.
SERVANT.
All people be still!
Allow not a word from your lips to be heard, For the Muses are here, and are making their odes
In my Master's abodes.
Let Ether be lulled, and forgetful to blow, And the blue sea-waves, let them cease to flow, And be noiseless.
MN. Fudge !
EUR.
Hush, hush, if you please.
SERV.
Sleep, birds of the air, with your pinions at ease ;
Sleep, beasts of the field, with entranquillized feet;
Sleep, Sleep, and be still.
MN. Fudge, Fudge, 1 repeat.
SERV.
For the soft and the terse professor of verse, Our Agathon now is about to— MN. (Scandalized1.)
No, no !
SERVo What's that ?
MN.
'Twas the ETHER, FORGETTING TO BLOW !SERVo (Beginning pettishly, but soonfalling back into his former tone.)
I was going to say he is going to lay
The stocks and the scaffolds for building a Play.
And neatly he hews them, and sweetly he glues them, And a proverb he takes, and an epithet makes, And he moulds a most waxen and delicate song, And he tunnels, and funnels, and- MN.
Does what is wrong.
SERV.
What clown have we here, so close to our eaves ?
MN.
Why, one who will take you and him, by your leaves.
Both you and your terse professor of verse, And with blows and with knocks set you both on the stocks, And tunnel and funnel, and pummel, and worse.
SERVo
Old man, you must have been a rare pert youngster.
EUR.
0, heed not him;
but quickly call me out Your master Agathon;
do pray make haste.
SERVo
No need of prayer:
he's coming forth directly.
He's moulding odes;
and in the cold hard winter
He cannot turn, and twist, and shape his strophes Until they are warmed and softened in the Sun.
(The servant goes back into the house.)MN.
And what am I to do?
EUR.
You're to keep quiet.
O Zeus !
the Hour is come, and so's the Man !
MN.
0, what's the matter ?
what disturbs you so ?
0, tell me what:
I really want to know.
Come, I'm your cousin ;
won't you tell your cousin ?
EUR.
There's a great danger brewing for my life.
MN. 0, tell your cousin what.
EUR.
This hour decides Whether Euripides shall live or die.
MN.
Why, how is that ?
There's no tribunal sitting, No Court, no Council, will be held to-day.
'Tis the Mid-Fast, the third Home-Festival.
EUR.
It is !
it is !
I wish enough it wasn't.
For on this day the womankind have sworn
To hold a great assembly, to discuss
How best to serve me out.
MN.
Good gracious !
Why ?EUR.
(With the mild surprise of injured innocence.)
Because, they say, I write lampoons upon them.
MN. Zeus and Poseidon !
they may well say that.
But tell your cousin what you mean to do.
EUR.
I want to get the poet Agathon To go among them.
MN.
Tell your cousin why.
EpIc
To mingle in the Assembly, perhaps to speak
On my behalf.
MN.
What, openly, do you mean ?
EUR, 0 no, disguised :
dressed up in woman's clothes.
MN.
A bright idea that, and worthy you :
For in all craftiness we take the cake.
(By a contrivance very common in ancient theatres, a portion of Agathon's house is here wheeled forward, turning on a pivot, so as to disclose the interior of an apartment.
The poet is dis­ / covered, surrounded by the most effeminate luxuries, and in the act of writing a Tragic Play.
He has just composed, and is now about to recite, a little lyrical dialogue between his Chorus and one of his actors.)EUR.
0, bush !
LAIN.
What now ?
EUR.
Here's Agathon himself.
MN.
Where?
Which ?
EUR.
Why there:
the man in the machine.
MN. 0 dear, what ails me ?
Am I growing blind ?
I see Cyrene1;
but I see no man.
EUR.
Do, pray, be silent;
he's just going to sing.
(Agathon gives afantastic little trill.)MIN.
Is it " the Pathway of the Ants," or what ?
(Agathon now sings his little dialogue in a soft womanly voice and with pretty effeminate gestures.)
AGATHON.
(As actor.)
Move ye slowly, with the holy Torchlight dear to Awful Shades, Singing siceetly, dancing featly, Yes, and neatly,freeborn maids.(As Chorus.)
Whose the song of festal praise ?
Only tell us, we are zealous Evermore our hymns to raise.
(As actor.)
Sing of Leto 1, sing of Thee too, Archer of the golden how, Bright Apollo, in the hollow Glades where Ilian rivers flow, Building buildings, long ago.(As Chorus.)
Raise the music, softly swelling
To the fame of Leto's name, To the Coil in song excelling, Brightest he, of all there be, Giving gifts of minstrelsy.(As actor.)
Sing the maiden, quiver-laden, From the woodland oaks emerging, Haunted shades of mountain glades, Artemis, the ever Virgin.(As Chorus.)
We rejoice, heart and voice, Hymning, praising, gently phrasing:
Her, the maiden quiver-laden.(As actor.)
Soft pulsation of the Asian Lyre, to which the dancers go, When the high and holy Graces Weave their swiftly whirling paces, Phrygian measure, to andfro.(As Chorus.)
Lyre Elysian, heavenly vision,
When thy witching tones arise, Comes the light of joy and gladness Flashing from immortal eyes.
Eyes will glisten, ears will listen, When our manful numbers ring.
Mighty master, Son of Leto, Thine the glory, Thou the King.
(Mnesilochus utters a cry of delight.)MIN.
Wonderful!
Wonderful !
How sweet, how soft, how ravishing the strain !
What melting words!
and as I heard them sung-,
Ye amorous Powers, there crept upon my soul A pleasant, dreamy, rapturous titillation.
And now, dear youth, for I would question thee And sift thee with the words of Aeschylus, Whence art thou, what thy country, what thy garb ?
Why all this wondrous medley ?
Lyre and silks,
A minstrel's lute, a maiden's netted hair, Girdle and wrestlers oil!
a strange conjunction.
How comes a sword beside a looking-glass ?
What art thou, man or woman ?
If a man, Where are his clothes ?
his red Laconian shoes ?
If woman, 'tis not like a woman's shape.
What art thou, speak ;
or if thou tell me not, Myself must guess thy gender from thy song.
AG.
Old man, old man, my ears receive the words
Of your tongue's utterance, yet I heed them not.
I choose my dress to suit my poesy.
A poet, sir, must needs adapt his ways
To the high thoughts which animate his soul.
And when he sings of women, he assumes A woman's garb, and dons a woman's habits.
MN. (Aside to Eur.)
When you wrote Phaedra1, did you take her habits?
AG.
But when he sings of men, his whole appearance Conforms to man.
What nature gives us not, The human soul aspires to imitate..IN.
(As before.)
Zounds, if I'd seen you when you wrote the Satyrs!
AG.
Besides, a poet never should be rough, Or harsh, or rugged.
Witness to my words Anacreon, Alcaeus, Ibyeus,
Who when they filtered and diluted song, Wore soft Ionian manners and attire.
And Phrynichus, perhaps you have seen him, sir, How fair he was, and beautifully dressed;
Therefore his Plays were beautifully fair.
For as the Worker, so the Work will be.
MN.
Then that is why harsh Philocles writes harshly, And that is why vile Xenocles writes vilely, And cold Theognis writes such frigid Plays.
AG.
Yes, that is why.
And I perceiving this Made myself womanlike.
MN.
My goodness, how ?EUR.
0, stop that yapping :
in my youthful days I too was such another one as he.
MN.
Good gracious !
I don't envy you your schooling.
EUR. (Sharply.)
Pray, let us come to business, sir.
MN.
Say on.
EUR.
A wise man, Agathon, compacts his words, And many thoughts compresses into few.
So, I in my extremity am come To ask a favour of you.
AG.
Tell me what.
EUR.
The womankind at their Home-feast to-day Are going to pay me out for my lampoons.
AG.
That's bad indeed, but how can I assist you ?
EUR.
Why every way.
If you'll disguise yourself, And sit among them like a woman born, And plead my cause, you'll surely get me off.
There's none but you to whom I dare entrust it.
AG.
Why don't you go yourself, and plead your causeEUR.
I'll tell you why.
They know me well by sight;
And I am gray, you see, and bearded too, But you've a baby face, a treble voice, A fair complexion, pretty, smooth, and soft.
(After a short pause Agathon bethinks him of a famous line in the Alcestis of Euripides.)AG.
Euripides !
EUR.
Yes.
AG.
Wasn't it you who wrote
You VALUE LIFE;
DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER DOESN'T?
EUR.
It was :
what then ?
AG.
Expect not me to bear Your burdens;
that were foolishness indeed.
Each man must bear his sorrows for himself.
And troubles, when they come, must needs be met By manful acts, and not by shifty tricks.
MN. Aye, true for you, your wicked ways are shown
By sinful acts, and not by words alone.
EUR.
But tell me really why you fear toAG.
They'd serve me worse than you.
EUR.
How so ?
AG.
HOW so ?
I'm too much like a woman, and they'd think
That I was come to poach on their preserves.
IN.
Well, I must say that's not a bad excuse.
EUR.
Then won't you really help ?
AG.
I really won't.
EUR.
Thrice luckless I!
Euripides is done for !
Mx. 0 friend !
0 cousin !
don't lose heart like this.
EUR.
Whatever can I do ?
MN.
Bid him go hang !
See, here am I;
deal with me as you please.
EUR.
(Striking while the iron is hot.)
Well, if you'll really give yourself to me, First throw aside this overcloke.
MN.
'Tis done.
But how are you going to treat me ?
EUR.
Shave you here,
And singe you down below.
MN. (Magnanimously.)
Well, do your worst;
I've said you may, and I'll go through with it.
EUR.
You've always, Agathon, got a razor handy;
Lend us one, will you ?
AG, Take one for yourself, Out of the razor-case.
EUR.
Obliging Youth !(To Mn.)
Now sit you down, (Mnesilochus seats himself in a chair.) and puff your right cheek out.
MN.
Oh !
EUR.
What's the matter ?
Shut your mouth, or else I'll clap a gag in.
MN. Lackalackaday !
(-He jumps up, and runs awayEUR.
Where are you fleeing ?
MN.
To sanctuary I.
Shall I sit quiet to he hacked like that ?
Demeter, no !
EUR.
Think how absurd you'll look, With one cheek shaven, and the other not.
MN. (Doggedly.)
Well;
I don't care.
EUR. 0, by the Gods, come back.
Pray don't forsake me.
MN.
Miserable me !
(He resumes his seat.
Euripides goes on with the shaving.
EUR.
Sit steady;
raise your chin ;
don't wriggle so.
MN. (Wincing.) 0 tchi, tchi, tchi!
EUR.
There, there, it's over now.
MN. And I'm, worse luck, a Rifled Volunteer.
EUR.
Well, never mind;
you're looking beautiful.
Glance in this mirror.
MN.
Well then, hand it here.
EUR.
What see you there ?
-LAIN. (In disgust.)
Not me, but Cleisthenes 1.EUR.
Get up :
bend forward.
I've to singe you now.
Mx. 0 me, you'll scald me like a sucking-pig.
EUR.
Some one within there, bring me out a torch.
Now then, stoop forward :
gently;
mind yourself.
MN.
Fit see to that.
Hey !
ITve caught fire there.
Hey !
0, water !
water !
neighbours, bring your buckets.
Fire !
Fire !
I tell you;
I'm on fire, I am !
EUR.
There, it's all right.
MN.
All right, when I'm a cinder?
EUR.
Well, well, the worst is over;
'tis indeed.
It won't pain now.
MN.
Faugh, here's a smell of burning !
Drat it, I'm roasted all about the stern.
EUR.
Nay, heed it not.
I'll have it sponged directly.
MN.
I'd like to catch a fellow sponging me,EUR Though you begrudge your active personal aid, Yet, Agathon, you won't refuse to lend us A dress and sash :
you can't deny you've got them.
AG.
Take them, and welcome.
I begrudge them not.
MN.
What's first to do ?
EUR.
Put on this yellow silk.
MN. By Aphrodite, but 'tis wondrous nice.
EUR.
Gird it up tighter.
MN.
Whereas the girdle?
EUR.
Here.
MN.
Make it sit neatly there about the legs.
EUR.
Now for a snood and hair-net.
AG.
Will this do?
It's quite a natty hairdress;
it's my nightcap.
EUR:
The very thing:
i'faith, the very thing.
MN. Does it look well?
EUR.
Zeus !
I should think it did !
Now for a mantle.
AG.
Take one from the couch.
EUR.
A pair of woman's shoes.
AG.
Well, here are mine.
MN.
Do they look well ?
EUR.
They are loose enough, I trow.
AG.
You see to that;
I've lent you all you need.
Will some one kindly wheel me in again ?
(Agathon's apartment, with Agathon in it, is wheeled back into the house;
Euripides and Mnesilochus are left standing on the stage.
Euripides turns Mnesilochus round, and surveys him with complacency.)
EUR.
There then, the man's a regular woman now, At least to look at;
and if you've to speak, Put on a feminine mincing voice.
MN. (in a shrill treble.)
I'll try.
EUR.
And now begone, and prosper.
MN.
Wait a bit.
Not till you've sworn- EUR.
Sworn what?
MN.
That if I get In any scrape, you'll surely see me through.
EUR.
I swear by Ether, Zeus's dwelling-place.
MN.
As well by vile Hippocrates's cabin.
EUR.
Well, then, I swear by every blessèd God.MN.
And please remember 'twas1 your MIND that swore, Not your tongue only;
please remember that.
(The background of the scene opens and a large building is pushed forward upon the stage, representing the Thesmophorium or Temple of the Home-givers.
The Athenian ladies, who form the Chorus of the Play, are seen, a few lines later, thronging into the orchestra, to assist in the solemnities of the festival, and to take part in the Assembly they are about to hold.
The air above them is thick with the smoke of the torches they are bearing in their hands.
Euripides thinks it time to make himself scarce.
Mnesilochus assumes the fussy airs and treble voice of an Athenian matron, talking to an imaginary maidservant.)
Erit. 0, get you gone :
for there's the signal hoisted Over the Temple;
they are assembling now.
I think I'll leave you.
IN.
Thratta, come along.
O Thratta, Thratta, here's a lot of women Coming up here !
0, what a flare of torches !
O sweet Twain-goddesses, vouchsafe me now A pleasant day, and eke a safe return.
Set down the basket, Thratta;
give me out The sacred cake to offer to the Twain.
O dread Demeter, high unearthly one, O Persephassa, grant your votaress grace
To join in many festivals like this, Or if not so, at least escape this once.
And may my daughter, by your leaves, pick up A wealthy husband, and a fool to boot;
And little Bull-calf have his share of brains.
Now, then, I wonder which is the best place
To hear the speeches ?
Thratta, you may go.
These are not things for servant-girls to hear.
(The officials now take their places, and the Assembly at once begins.)CRIERESS.
Worldly clamour Pass away!
Silence, Silence,
While we pray;
To the Twain, the Home-bestowers, Holy Parent, holy Daughter, And to Wealth, and Heavenly Beauty, And to Earth the foster-mother, And to Hermes and the Graces, That they to this important high debate Grant favour and success, Making it useful to the Athenian State, And to ourselves no less.
And 0, that she who counsels best to-day About the Athenian nation, And our own commonwealth of women, may Succeed by acclamation.
These things we pray, and blessings on our cause.
Sing Paean, Paean, ho! with merry loud applause.
CHORUS.
We in thy prayers combine, And we trust the Powers Divine Will on these their suppliants smile, Both Zeus the high and awful, And the golden-lyred Apollo From the holy Delian isle.
And thou, our Mighty Maiden, Lance of gold, and eye of blue, Of the God-contested city, Help us too :
And the many-named, the Huntress, Gold-fronted Leto's daughter;
And the dread Poseidon ruling Over Ocean's stormy water;
Come from the deep where fishes Swarm, and the whirlwinds rave;
And the Oreads of the mountain, .
And the Nereids of the wave.
Let the Golden Harp sound o'er us And the Gods with favour crown This Parliament of Women, The free and noble matrons
Of the old Athenian town.
CREHESS.
0 yes !
0 yes !
Pray ye the Olympian Gods-and Goddesses, And all the Pythian Gods-and Goddesses, And all the Delian Gods-and Goddesses, And all the other Gods-and Goddesses, Whoso is disaffected, ill-disposed Towards this commonwealth of womankind, Or with Euripides, or with the Medes Deals to the common hurt of womankind, Or aims at tyranny, or fain would bring-
The Tyrant back;
or dares betray a wife For palming off a baby as her own ;
Or tells her master tales against her mistress;
Or does not bear a message faithfully;
Or, being a suitor, makes a vow, and then Fails to perform;
or, being a rich old woman, Hires for herself a lover with her wealth;
Or, being a girl, takes gifts and cheats the giver;
Or, being a trading man or trading woman, * Gives us short measure in our drinking-cups;
-
Perish that man, himself and all his house;
But pray the Gods-and Goddesses-to order To all the women always all things well.
CHOP..
We also pray, And trust it may Be done as thou premisest, And hope that they Will win the day Whose words are best and wisest.
But they who fain Would cheat for gain, Their solemn oaths forgetting, Our ancient laws And noble cause And mystic rites upsetting-;
Who plot for greed, Who call the Mede With secret invitation, I say that these The Gods displease, And wrong the Athenian nation.
O Zeus most high In earth and sky, All-powerful, all-commanding, We pray to Thee, Weak women we, But help us notwithstanding.
CRIERESS.
0 yes!
0 yes!
The Women's Council-Board Hath thus enacted (moved by Sostrata, President Timocleia, clerk Lysilla), To hold amorning Parliament to-day When women most have leisure;
to discuss
What shall be done about Euripides, How best to serve him out;
for that he's guilty
We all admit.
Who will address the meeting ?
MICA.
I wish to, I.
CRIERESS, Put on this chaplet first.
Order !
order !
Silence, ladies, if you please.
Slices learnt the trick ;
she hems and haws;
she coughs in preparation;
'I know the signs;
my soul divines a mighty long oration.
MICA.
'Tis not from any feeling of ambition I rise to address you, ladies, but because I long have seen, and inly burned to see The way Euripides insults us all, The really quite interminable scoffs
This market-gardener's son pours out against us I don't believe that there's a single fault He's not accused us of;
I don't believe
That there's a single theatre or stage, But there is he, calling us double-dealers, False, faithless, tippling, mischief-making gossips, A rotten set, a misery to men.
Well, what's the consequence ?
The men come home Looking so sour—O, we can see them peeping
In every closet, thinking friends are there.
Upon my word we can't do ANYTHING
We used to do;
he has made the men so silly.
Suppose I'm hard at work upon a chaplet, Hey, she's in love with somebody ;
suppose I chance to drop a pitcher on the floor, And straightway 'tis, For whom was that intended ?
I warrant now, for our Corinthian 1 friend.
Is a girl ill ?
Her brother shakes his head;
The girl's complexion is not to my taste.
Why, if you merely want to hire a baby.
And palm it off as yours, you've got no chance.
They sit beside our very beds, they do.
Then there's another thing;
the rich old men
Who used to marry us, are grown so shy We never catch them now;
and all because Euripides declares, the scandal-monger, An old man weds a Tyrant, not a wife.
You know, my sisters, how they mew us up, Guarding our women's rooms with bolts and seals, And fierce Molossian dogs.
That's all his doing.
We might put up with that;
but, 0 my friends, Our little special perquisites, the corn, The wine, the oil, gone, gone, all gone for ever.
They've got such keys, our husbands have, such brutes, Laconian-made, with triple rows of teeth.
Then in old times we only had to buy A farthing ring, and pantry-doors flew open.
But now this wretch Euripides has made them Wear such worm-eaten perforated seals, 'Tis hopeless now to try it.
Therefore, ladies, What I propose is that we slay the man, Either by poison or some other way;
Somehow or other he must die the death.
That's all I'll say in public:
I'll write out A formal motion with the clerkess there.
CHOR.
Good heavens !
what force and tact combined !
0, what a many-woven mind !
A better speech, upon my word, I don't believe I ever heard.
Her thoughts so elean dissected, Her words so well selected, Such keen discrimination, Such power and elevation, 'Twas really quite a grand, superb, magnificent oration.
So that if, in opposition, Xenocles came forth to speak, Compared with her You'd all aver All his grandest, happiest efforts are immeasurably weak !
SECOND WOMAN.
Ladies,
I've only a few words to add.
I quite agree with the honourable lady
Who has just sat down :
she has spoken well and ably.
But I can tell you what I've borne myself.
My husband died in Cyprus, leaving me Five little chicks to work and labour for.
I've done my best, and bad's the best, but still I've fed them, weaving chaplets for the Gods.
But now this fellow writes his Plays, and says There are no Gods;
and so, you may depend, My trade is fallen to half;
men won't buy chaplets.
So then for many reasons he must die;
The man is bitterer than his mothers potherbs.
I leave my cause with you, my sisters :
I Am called away on urgent private business, An order, just received, for twenty chaplets.
CHOR.
Better and better still.
A subtler intellect, a daintier skill.
Wise are her words, and few;
Well timed and spoken too.
A many-woven mind she too has got, I find.
And he must clearly, This rascal man, be punished most severely.
(The motion for putting Euripides to death having, so to say, been propose and seconded, Mnesilochus rises to speak in opposition.)MN. Mrs. Speaker and ladies, I'm not surprised, of course I'm not surprised, To find you all so angry and aggrieved At what Euripides has said against is.
For I myself-or slay my babies else-
Hate him like poison, to be sure I do, He's most provoking, I admit he is.
But now we're all alone, there's no reporter, All among friends, why not be fair and candid ?
Grant that the man has really found us out, And told a thing or two, sure they're all TRUE, And there's a many thousand still behind.
For I myself, to mention no one else, Could tell a thousand plaguy trieks I've played
On my poor husband;
I'll just mention one.
We'd been but three days married;
I'm abed, Husband asleep beside me;
when my lover (I'd been familiar with him from a child) Came softly scratching at the outer door.
I hear;
I know " the little clinking sound," And rise up stealthily, to creep downstairs.
Where go you, pray ?
says husband.
Where !
say I, I've such a dreadful pain in my inside I must go down this instant.
Go, says he.
He pounds his anise, juniper, and sage, To still my pains :
I seize the water-jug, And wet the hinge, to still its creaking noise, Then open, and go out:
and I and lover Meet by Aguieus and his laurel-shade, Billing and cooing to our hearts' content.
(With vivacity.)
Euripides has never found out that.
Nor how a wife contrived to smuggle out Her frightened lover, holding up her shawl
To the sun's rays for husband to admire.
Nor how we grant our favours to bargees
And muleteers, if no one else we've got.
Nor how, arising from a night's debauch, We chew our garlic, that our husbands, coming Back from the walls at daybreak, may suspect Nothing amiss at home.
Then what's the odds
If he does rail at Phaedra ?
Let him rail.
What's that to us ?
Let him rail on, say I. Phaedra indeed !
He might come nearer home.
I knew a woman, I won't mention names, Remained ten days in childbirth.
Why, do you think ?
Because she couldn't buy a baby sooner.
Her husband runs to every medicine-man In dreadful agitation;
while he's out, They bring a little baby in a basket, Bunging its mouth up that it mayn't cry out, And stow it safe away till he comes home.
Then at a given sign she feebly says, My time is come:
please, husband, go away.
He goes;
they open basket;
baby cries.
0, what delight, surprise, congratulations !
The man runs in ;
the nurse comes running out, (The same that brought the baby in the basket,) A prodigy !
a Lion !
such a boy !
Yourform, yourfeatures:
just the same expression :
Your very image:
lucky!, lucky man !
Don't we do this ?
By Artemis, we do.
Then wherefore rail we at Euripides ?
We're not one bit more sinned against than sinning.
CHOR.
What a monstrous, strange proceeding!
Whence, I wonder, comes her breeding?
From what country shall we seek her, Such a bold audacious speaker?
That a woman so should wrong us, Here among us, here among us, I could never have believed it;
such a thing was never known.
But what may be, no man knoweth, And the wise old proverb showeth, That perchance a poisonous sophist lurketh under every stone.
0, nothing, nothing in the world so hateful will you find
As shameless women, save of course the rest of womankind.
MICA.
What can possess us, sisters mine ?
I vow by old Agraulus, We're all bewitched, or else have had some strange mischance befall its, To let this shameless hussy tell her shameful, bold, improper, Unpleasant tales, and we not make the least attempt to stop her.
If any one assist me, good:
if not, alone we'll try, We'll strip and whip her well, we will, my serving-maids and I.MIN.
Not strip me, gentle ladies;
sure I heard the proclamation, That every freeborn woman now might make a free oration;
And if I spoke unpleasant truths on this your invitation, Is that a reason why I now should suffer castigation ?
MICA.
It is, indeed:
how dare you plead for him who always chooses Such odious subjects for his Plays, on purpose to abuse us;
Phaedras and Melanippes too :
but ne'er a drama made he About the good Penelope, or such-like virtuous lady.
MN.
The cause I know ;
the cause I'll show :
you won't discover any Penelope alive to-day, but Phaedras very many.
MICA.
You will ?
you dare ?
how can we bear to hear such things repeated, Such horrid, dreadful, odious things?
Mx. 0, I've not near completed
The things I know;
I'll give the whole :
I'm not disposed to grudge it.
MICA.
You can't, I vow;
you've emptied now your whole disgusting budget.
Mx.
No, not one thousandth part I've told :
not even how we take
The scraper from the bathing-room, and down the corn we rake, And push it in, and tap the bin.
MICA.
Confound you and your slandersMN.
Nor how the Apaturian meat we steal to give our panders, And then declare the cat was there.
MICA.
You nasty tell-tale you !
MN.
Nor how with deadly axe a wife her lord and master slew, Another drove her husband mad with poisonous drugs fallacious, Nor how beneath the reservoir the Acharnian girl- MICA.
Good gracious!
MN.
Buried her father out of sight.
MICA.
Now really this won't do.
MN.
Nor how when late your servant bare a child as well as you, You took her boy, and in his stead your puling girl you gave her.
MICA.
0, by the Two, this jade shall rue her insolent behaviour.
I'll comb your fleece, you saucy minx.
MN.
By Zeus, you had best begin it.
MICA.
Come on !
MN.
Come on !
MICA.
You will?
you will ?
(Flinging her upper mantle to Philista.)
Hold this, my dear, a minute.
MN. Stand off, or else, by Artemis, I'll give you such a strumming—CHOR.
For pity's sake, be silent there :
I see a woman coming, Who looks as if she'd news to tell.
Now prithee both be quiet, And let us hear the tale she brings, without this awful riot.
(The supposed woman turns out to be the notorious Cleisthenes, of whom ice have already heard.
I The reader must imagine the feelings of Mnesilochus during the ensuing dialogue.)
CLEI.
Dear ladies, I am one with you in heart;
My cheeks, unfledged, bear witness to my love, I am your patron, aye, and devotee.
And now, for lately in the market-place I heard a rumour touching you and yours, I come to warn and put you on your guard, Lest this great danger take you unawares.
CHOR.
What now, my child ?
for we may call thee child, So soft, and smooth, and downy are thy cheeks.
CLEI.
Euripides, they say, has sent a cousin, A bad old man, amongst you here to-day.
CHOR. 0, why and wherefore, and with what design ?
CLEI.
To be a spy, a horrid, treacherous spy, A spy on all your purposes and plans.
CHOR.
0, how should he be here, and we not know it?
CLEI.
Euripides has tweezered him, and singed him, And dressed him up, disguised in woman's clothes.,AIN.
(stamping about with a lively recollection of his recent safferings.)
I don't believe it;
not one word of it;
.
No man would let himself be tweezered so.
Ye Goddesses, I don't believe there's one.
CLEI.
Nonsense :
I never should have come here else, I had it on the best authority.
CHOR.
This is a most important piece of news.
We'll take immediate steps to clear this up.
We'll search him out:
we'll find his lurking-place.
Zounds, if we catch him !
r-r-r !
the rascal man.
Will you, kind gentleman, assist the search ?
Give us fresh cause to thank you, patron mine.
CLEI. (To Mica.)
Well, who are you ?
MN. (Aside.)
Wherever can I flee?
CLEI.
I'll find him, trust me.
MN. (Aside.)
Here's a precious scrape !
MICA.
Who?
I? CLEI, Yes, you.
MICA.
Cleonymus's wife.
CLEI.
Do you know her, ladies?
Is she speaking truth ?
CHOR.
0 yes, we know her:
pass to some one else.
CLEI.
Who's this young person with the baby here ?
MICA.
0, she's my nursemaid.
MN. (Aside.)
Here he comes;
I'm done for.
CLEI.
Hey!
whereas she off to?
Stop!
Why, what the mischief!
CHOP.
(Aside to Clei.)
Yes, sift her well;
discover who she is.
We know the others, but we don't know her.
CLEI.
Come, come, no shuffling, madam, turn this way.
MN. (Fretfully.)
Don't pull me, sir, I'm poorly.
CLEI.
Please to tell me Your husband's name.
MN.
My husband's name ?
my husband's ?
Why What-d'ye-call-him from Cothocidae.
CLIn.
Eh, what?
(Considers.)
There was a What-d'ye-call-him once-MN.
He's Who-d'ye-call-it's son.
CLEI.
You're trifling with me.
Have you been here before ?
MN. 0, bless you, yes.
Why, every year.
CUrI.
And with what tent-companion?
iN. With What's-her-name.
CLEI.
This is sheer idling, woman.
MICA.
(To (]lei.)
Step back, sir, please, and let me question her On last yearns rites ;
a little further, please;
No man must listen now.
(To JIn.)
Now, stranger, tell me
What first we practised on that holy day.
J\JN. Bless me, what was it?
first?
why, first we-drank.
MICA.
Right;
what was second ?
MN.
Second ?
Drank again.
MICA.
Somebody's told you this.
But what was third?
MN. Well, third, Xenylla had a drop too much.
MICA.
Ah, that won't do.
Here, Cleisthenes, approach.
This is the MAN for certain.
CLEI.
Bring him up.
Mnesilochus is seized, carried before a jury of matrons, and pronounced a MAN !
A general uproar ensues.)
CHOR.
0, this is why you mocked and jeered us so !
And dared defend Euripides like that!
0, villain, villain.
MN.
Miserable me!
I've put my foot in it, and no mistake.
MiCA.
What shall we do with him?
CLEI.
Surround him here.
And watch him shrewdly that he 'scape yon not.
I'll go at once and summon the Police.
(Cleisthenes goes out.)CHOR.
Light we our torches, my sisters, and manfully girding our robes, Gather them sternly about us, and casting our mantles aside
On through the tents and the gangways, and up by the tiers and the rows, Eyeing, and probing, and trying, where men would be likely to hide.
Now 'tis time, 'tis time, my sisters, round and round and round to go, Soft, with light and airy foot-fall, creeping, peeping, high and low.
Look about in each direction, make a rigid, close inspection, Lest in any hole or corner, other rogues escape detection.
Hunt with care, here and there, Searching, spying, poking, prying, up and down, and everywhere.
For if once the evil-doer we can see, He shall soon be a prey to our vengeance to-day, I And to all men a warning he shall be Of the terrible fate that is sure to await The guilty sin-schemer and lawless blasphemer.
And then he shall find that the Gods are not blind To what passes below;
Yea, and all men shall know
It is best to live purely, uprightly, securely, It is best to do well, And to practise day and night what is orderly and right, And in virtue and in honesty to dwell.
But if any one there be who a wicked deed shall do, In his raving, and his raging, and his madness, and his pride, Every mortal soon shall see, aye, and every woman too, What a doom shall the guilty one betide.
For the wicked evil deed shall be recompensed with speed, The Avenger doth not tarry to begin, Nor delayeth for a time, but He searcheth out the crime, And He punisheth the sinner in his sin.
Now we've gone through every corner, every nook surveyed with care, And there's not another culprit skulking, lurking anywhere.
(Just as the Chorus are concluding their search, Mnesilochus snatches JJficct's baby from her arms, and fakes refuge at the altar.)
MICA.
Hoy !
Hoy there !
Hoy !
He's got my child, he's got my darling, 0 !
He's snatched my little baby from my breast.
0, stop him, stop him !
0, he's gone.
0 ! 0 !MN. Aye, weep!
you ne'er shall dandle him again, Unless you loose me.
Soon shall these small limbs, Smit with cold edge of sacrificial knife, Incarnadine this altar.
MICA.
O !
O !
O !
Help, women, help me.
Sisters, help, I pray.
Charge to the rescue, shout, and rout, and scout him.
Don't see me lose my baby, my one pet.
CHOR.
Alas!
Alas! Mercy o' me!
what do I see?
What can it be?
What, will deeds of shameless violence never, never, never, end ?
What's the matter, whales he up to, what's he doing now, my friend ?
Mx.
Doing what I hope will crush you out of all your bold assurance.
CHOR.
Zounds, his words are very dreadful;
more than dreadful, past endurance.
MICA.
Yes, indeed, they're very dreadful, and he's got my baby too.
CHOR.
Impudence rare !
Look at him there, Doing such deeds, and I vow and declare Never minding or caring- MN.
Or likely to care.
CHOR.
Here you are come :
here you shall stay, Never again shall you wander away;
Wander away, glad to display All the misdeeds you have done us to-day, But dear you shall pay.
IN.
There at least I'm hoping, ladies, I shall find your words untrue.
CHOR.
What God do you think his assistance will lend, You wicked old man, to escort you away?
MN. Alia but I've captured your baby, my friend, And I shan't let her go, for the best you can say.
CHOR.
But no, by the Goddesses Twain, Not long shall our threats be in vain, Not long shall you flout at our pain.
Unholy your deeds, and you'll find That WE shall repay you in kind, And perchance you will alter your mind When Fate, veering round like the blast, In its clutches has seized you at last, Very fast.
Comrades, haste, collect the brushwood :
pile it up without delay :
Pile it, heap it, stow it, throw it, burn and fire and roast and slay.
MICA.
Come, Mania, come;
let's run and fetch the fagots.
(To Mn.)
Ah, wretch, you'll be a cinder before night.
MN. (Busily engaged in unpacking the baby.)
With all my heart.
Now I'll undo these wrappers, These Cretan long clothes;
and remember, darling, It's all your mother that has served you thus.
What have we here ?
a flask, and not a baby !
A flask of wine, for all its Persian slippers.
O ever thirsty, ever tippling women, O ever ready with fresh schemes for drink, To vintners what a blessing :
but to us
And all our goods and chattels what a curse!
MICA.
Drag in the fagots, Mania;
pile them up.
MN.
Aye, pile away ;
but tell me, is this baby Really your own?
MICA.
My very flesh and blood.
MN.
Your flesh and blood ?
MICA.
By Artemis itMN.
Is it a pint?
MICA.
0, what have you been doing?
0, you have stripped my baby of its clothes.
Poor tiny morsel!
MN.

Tiny ?
MICA.
\es, indeed.
MN.
What is its age ?
Three Pitcher-feasts or four ?
MICA.
Well, thereabouts, a little over now.
Please give it back.
MN.
No thank you, not exactly.
MICA.
We'll burn you then.
MN. 0, burn me by all means ;
But anyhow I'll sacrifice this victim.
MICA.
O! O! O!
Make me your victim, anything you like ;
But spare the child.
MN.
A loving mother truly.
But this dear child must needs be sacrificed.
MICA.
My child !
my child!
give me the bason, Mania, I'll catch my darling's blood, at any rate.
MN.
And so you shall;
I'll not deny you that.
(Puts the bottle to his lips and drains every drop;
taking care that none shall fall into the bason which Mica is holding underneath.)
MN.
This skin, fair priestess, is your perquisite.
MICA.
What is my perquisite?
iN.
This skin, fair priestess.
(Another woman, Gritylla, now enters.)Cm. 0 Mica, who has robbed thee of thy flower, And snatched thy babe, thine only one, away ?
MICA.
This villain here :
but I'm so glad you're come.
You see he doesn't run away, while I Call the police, with Cleisthenes, to help us.
(Mica goes out.)MN. (Soliloquizes.)
0 me, what hope of safety still remains ?
What plan ?
what stratagem ?
My worthy cousin,
Who first involved me in this dreadful scrape, " He cometh not."
Suppose I send him word.
But how to send it ?
Hah, I know a trick
Out of his Palamede.
I'll send a message Written on oar-blades.
Tush !
I've got no oar-blades.
What shall I do for oar-blades ?
Why not send
These votive slabs instead ?
The very thing.
Oar-blades are wood, and slabs are wood.
I'll try.
(Writes, and sings to himself as he urites.)
Now for the trick;
fingers be quick ;
Do what you can for my notable plan.
Slab, have the graee to permit me to trace Grooves with my knife on your beautiful face.
The tale of my woe it is yours for to show.
Oh, oh, what a furrow !
I never did see Such an horrible " R " as I've made it to be.
Well, that must do ;
so fly 1 away yon, Hither and thither, off, off, and away.
Do not delay for a moment, I pray.
(Here follows the PARABASIS.
As a rule, all the actors leave the stage before the Parabasis begins:
but Mnesilochus is unable to leave, and Critylla remains to keep watch.)
CHOR, Now let us turn to the people, our own panegyric to render.
Men never speak a good word, never one, for the feminine gender, Every one says we're a Plague, the source of all evils to man, War, dissension, and strife.
Come, answer me this, if you can;
Why, if we're really a Plague, you're so anxious to have us for wives;
And charge us not to be peeping, nor to stir out of doors for our lives, Isn't it silly to guard a Plague with such scrupulous care ?
Zounds!
how you rave, coming home, if your poor little wife isn't there.
Should you not rather be glad, and rejoice all the days of your life, Rid of a Plague, you know, the source of dissension and strife ?
If on a visit we sport, and sleep when the sporting is over, 0, how you rummage about;
what a fuss, your lost Plague to discover.
Every one stares at your Plague if she happens to look on the street:
Stares all the more if your Plague thinks proper to blush and retreat.
Is it not plain then, I ask, that Women are really the best ?
What, can you doubt that we are ?
I will bring it at once to the test.
We say Women are best;
you men (just like you) deny it, Nothing on earth is so easy as to come to the test, and to try it.
I'll take the name of a Man, and the name of a Woman, and show it.
Did not Charminus give way to Miss-Fortune ?
Do you not know it?
Is not Cleophon viler than vile Salabaccho by far?
Is there a Man who can equal, in matters of glory and war, Lady Victoria, Mistress of Marathon, queen of the Sea ?
Is not Prudence a Woman, and who is so clever as she ?
Certainly none of your statesmen, who only a twelvemonth ago Gave up their place and their duty.
Would women demean themselves so'
Women don't ride in their coaches, as Men have been doing of late, Pockets and purses distended with cash they have filched from the State We, at the very outside, steal a wee little jorum of corn, Putting it back in the even, whatever we took in the morn.
(The Strophe.)
But this is a true description of you.
Are ye not gluttonous, vulgar, perverse, Kidnappers, housebreakers, footpads, and worse ?
And we in domestic economy too Are thriftier, shiftier, wiser than you.
For the loom which our mothers employed with such skill, With its Shaft and its Thongs,—we are working it still.
And the ancient umbrella by no means is done, We are wielding it yet, as our Shield from the Sun.
But 0 for the Shafts, and the Thong of the Shield, Which your Fathers in fight were accustomed to wield.
Where are they to-day?
Ye have cast them away
As ye raced, in hot haste, and disgraced, from the fray !(The Epirrhema,) Many things we have against you, many rules we justly blame;
But the one we now will mention is the most enormous shame.
What, my masters !
ought a lady, who has borne a noble son,
One who in your fleets and armies great heroic deeds has done, Ought she to remain unhonoured ?
ought she not, I ask you, I, In our Stenia and our Scira still to take precedence high ?
Whoso breeds a cowardly soldier, or a seaman cold and tame, Crop her hair, and seat her lowly ;
brand her with the marks of shame;
Set the nobler dame above her.
Can it, all ye Powers, be right That Hyperbolus's mother, flowing-haired, and robed in white, Should in public places sit by Lamachus's mothers side, Hoarding wealth, and lending monies, gathering profits far and wide ?
Sure 'twere better every debtor, calm resolving not to pay, When she comes exacting money, with a mild surprise should say, Keeping principal and income, You to claim percentage due!
Sure a son so capital is CAPITAL enough for you.
(The close of the Parabusis finds the position of Mnesilochus unaltered.
The dispatch of the tablets has, so far, produced no result.)
MN. I've strained my eyes with watching;
but my poet, " He cometh not."
Why not ?
Belike he feels Ashamed of his old frigid Palamede.
Which is the Play to fetch him ?
0, I know;
Which but his brand-new Helen?
I'll be Helen.
I've got the woman's clothes, at all events.
CRI.
What are you plotting ?
What is that you're muttering ?
I'll Helen you, my master, if you don't Keep quiet there till the Policeman comes.
(We have had a short caricature of the “ Palamede.”
We are about to have a more elaborate caricature of the Helen, which is still extant.
Almost all the speeches of Euripides and Mnesilochus in the ensuing scene are taken, with occasional comic perversions, from that Play.)MN. (As Helen,)
These are the fair-nymphed waters of the Nile, Whose floods bedew, in place of heavenly showers, Egypt's white plains and black-dosed citizens.

Ah, not unknown my Spartan fatherland, Nor yet my father Tyndareus.
CRI.
My gracious!
Was he your father ?
Sure, Phrynondas was.

You've not been punished for your first freak yet.

And now I linger here ;
but Menelaus, My dear, dear lord, ah wherefore comes he not ?
O sluggish crows, to spare my hapless life!
But soft!
some hope is busy at my heart, A laughing hope—O Zeus, deceive me not.

Will he extend his hospitable care
To some poor storm-tossed, shipwrecked mariners ?

And wherefore sitt'st thou on this monument, Veiled in thy mantle, lady?

Why do you tell the gentleman such fibs?
Good gentleman, he's a bad man;

CiI.
I say now, none of this.
Let go there, or I'll strike you with this link!
EUR.
Let go my wife, the child of Tyndareus, Not take her home to Sparta?
0, what mean you?

You're a bad one too !
Both of one gang.

The whip, and smite them.

Aye, one came but now Spinning his yarns, and all but got him off.

What should I grant you ?

Don't expose me thus;
Do tell the Scythian he may strip me first;
Don't let a poor old man, in silks and snoods, Provoke the laughter of the crows that eat him.

And the Chorus commence their great ceremonial worship of dance and song.)
CHOR, Now for the revels, my sisters, which we to the great Twain Powers Prayerfully, carefully raise, in the holy festival hours.
And Pauson will join in our worship to-day, And Pauson will join in the fasting, And, keen for the fast, to the Twain he will pray For the rite to be made everlasting, I ween, For the rite to be made everlasting.
Now advance
In the whirling, twirling dance, With hand linked in hand, as we deftly trip along, Keeping time to the cadence of the swiftly-flowing song;
And be sure as we go That we dart careful glances, up and down, and to and fro.
Now 'tis ours
To entwine our choicest flowers, Flowers of song and adoration to the great Olympian Powers.
Nor expect
That the garland will be flecked With abuse of mortal men;
such a thought is incorrect.
For with prayer
And with sacred loving care, A new and holy measure we will heedfully prepare.
To the high and holy Minstrel Let the dancers onward go, And to Artemis, the maiden Of the quiver and the bow ;
0, hear us, Far-controller, and the victory bestow.
And we trust our merry music
Will the matron Hera please, For she loves the pleasant Chorus And the dances such as these, -Wearing at her girdle The holy nuptial Keys.
To Pan and pastoral Hermes
And the friendly Nymphs we pray, That they smile with gracious favour
On our festival to-day, With their laughter-loving glances beaming brightly on our Play, As we dance the Double chorus To the old familiar strain, As we weave our ancient pastime
On our holy day again, —Keeping fast and vigil In the Temple of the Twain.
Turn the step, and change the measure, Raise a loftier music now ;
Come, the Lord of wine and pleasure, Evoi, Bacchus, lead us thou !
Yea, for Thee we adore !
Child of Semele, thee With thy glittering ivy-wreaths, Thee with music and song Ever and ever we praise.
Thee with thy wood-nymphs delightedly singing, Evoi!
Evoi!
Evoi!
Over the joyous hills the sweet strange melody ringing.
Hark !
Cithaeron resounds,
Pleased the notes to prolong ;
Hark !
the bosky ravines
And the wild slopes thunder and roar, Volleying back the song.
Round thee the ivy fair With delicate tendril twines.

These are the joys Euripides has brought me!
(Euripides makes a momentary appearance in the character of Perseus.
The third Play to be caricatured is the famous Andromeda.)O Gods !
O Saviour Zeus !
there's yet a hope.
Then he won't fail me !
Out he flashed as Perseus.
I understand the signals, I'm to act The fair Andromeda in chains.
Ah, well, Here are the chains, worse luck, wherewith to act her.
He'll come and succour me ;
he's in the wings.
(Euripides enters singing airily.)EUR, Now to peep, now to creep Soft and slily through.
Maidens, pretty maidens,
Tell me what I am to do.
Tell me how to glide
By the Scythian Argus-eyed, And to steal away my bride.
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell, Echo, always lurking in the cavern and the dell.
(Euripides retires, and Mnesilochus commences a Euripidean monody, mostly composed of quota­ tions from the Andromeda, adapted to his own position.)MN.
A cold unpitying heart had he Who bound me here in misery.
Hardly escaped from mouldy dame, I'm caught and done for, just the same.
Lo, the Scythian guard beside me, Friendless, helpless, here he tied me;
Soon upon these limbs of mine
Shall the greedy ravens dine.
Seest thou ?
not to me belong Youthful pleasures, dance and song, Never, never more shall I With my friends sweet law-suits try, But woven chains with many a link surround me, Till Glaucetes, that ravening whale, has found me.
Home I nevermore shall see;
Bridal songs are none for me, Nought but potent incantations;
Sisters, raise your lamentations, Woe, woe, woeful me, Sorrow, and trouble, and misery.
Weeping, weeping, endless weeping, Far from home and all I know, Praying him who wronged me so.
O! O! Woe ! woe!
First with razor keen he hacks me, Next in yellow silk he packs me, Sends me then to dangerous dome, Where the women prowl and roam.
O heavy Fate!
0 fatal blow!
O woeful lot!
and lots of woe !
0, how they will chide me, and gibe, and deride me !
And 0 that the flashing, and roaring, and dashing, Red bolt of the thunder might smite me in sunder, For where is the joy of the sunshine and glow To one who is lying, distracted and dying, With throat-cutting agonies riving him, driving him Down, down to the darkness below.
(A voice is heard from behind the scenes.
It is the voice of Echo.)ECHO.
O welcome, daughter;
but the Gods destroy Thy father Cepheus, who exposed thee thus.
MN. 0, who art thou that mournest for my woes ?
ECHO.
Echo, the vocal mocking-bird of song, I who, last year, in these same lists contended, A faithful friend, beside Euripides.
And now, my child, for thou must play thy part, Make dolorous wails.
MN.
And you wail afterwards?
ECHO.
I'll see to that;
only begin at once.
MN, O Night most holy, O'er dread Olympus, vast and far, In thy dark car Thou journeyest slowly Through Ether ridged with many a star.
ECHO.
With many a star.
MN.
Why on Andromeda ever must flow Sorrow and woe ?
ECHO.
Sorrow and woe ?
IN.
Heavy of fate.
ECHO.
Heavy of fate.
MN.
Old woman, you'll kill me, I know, with your prate.
ECHO.

MN.
Why, how tiresome you are:

ECHO.
You are going too far.
MN. Good friend, if you kindly will leave me in peace, You'll do me a favour, 0 prithee, cease.

Bring Peace again with thee, Jocundly, merrily, Long to reign o'er is.
Sacred, unearthly ones, Awfullest Shades, Graciously, peacefully, Come to your glades.
Man must not gaze on the Rites at your shrine, Torch-glimmer flashing o'er Features divine.
Come, for we're pouring Imploring, adoring, Intense veneration;
Dawn on your worshippers, Givers of Home and our Civilization.
(Euripides comes in, dressed as an old music-woman.)EUR.
Ladies, I offer terms.
If well and truly Your honourable sex befriend me now, I won't abuse your honourable sex From this time forth for ever.

But what's your object in proposing this ?
EUR.
That poor old man there, he's my poor old cousin.
Let him go free, and nevermore will I Traduce your worthy sex ;
but if you won't, I'll meet your husbands coming from the Wars, And put them up to all your goings-on.
CHOP.
We take your terms, so far as we're concerned, But you yourself must manage with the Scythian.

And mind the things I taught you on the way.
Hold up your frock :

Sc. Yesh!

Well, p'raps on that consideration, Scythian, We won't object;

The Scythian flings his bow-case to Euripides and runs after her.)EUR.
0 tricky Hermes, you befriend me still.
Good-bye, old Scythian;

Meanwhile I'll free your prisoner :
and do you (to Mn.)
Run like a hero, when I've loosed your bonds, Straight to the bosom of your family.
MN.
Trust me for that, so soon as these are off.
EUR.
There then, they are off :
now run away, before The Scythian come and catch you.
MN.
Won't I just!
(Euripides and Mnesilochus leave the stage.
They are hardly out of sight when the Scythian returns.)
CHOR.

Sc.
Yesh, does zu saw her ?
CHOR.
Yes, indeed I did.
She went that way:
there was an old man with her.

Exactly so.
I think you'll catch them if you take that road.
Sc. Yare bad ole lady, did se vich vay run ?

Straight up the hill ;
no, no, not that direction.
(They are of course misdirecting him :
notwithstanding which, lie seems likely, in his flurry, to stumble on the right rond.)
You're going wrong:
see, that's the way ,-lie went.
Sc. 0 dear, 0 dear, but Hartomixer runnish.
(He runs out the wrong way.)CHOR.
Merrily, merrily, merrily on to your own confusion go.
But we've ended our say, and we're going away, Like good honest women, straight home from the Play.
And we trust that the twain Home-givers will deign To bless with success our performance to-day.
THERE are only two MSS.
now known to exist, which contain the Thesrnophoriazusae, viz.:
R. The Ravenna MS.H. The Munich MS. (No. 492).
There are two Aristophanie MSS.
in the library of Munich ;
but as they do not overlap each other, one containing the Clouds, Frogs, Ecclesiazusae, and Plutus, and the other the Lysistrata and Thesmo­ phoriazusae, it seemed unnecessary to discriminate between them as H. and H1.;
and they are both cited as H.Both R. and H. were fortunately collated by Velsen, the prince of collators.
No part of the Thesrnophoriazusae was found in the MS.
or MSS.
from which the learned Marco Musuro prepared the Aldine edition.
Both this play and the Lysistrata were first published in 1515 by Bernard Junta as a supplement to his edition of the nine other plays published earlier in the same year.
He describes the manuscript from which he took them as " ex Urbinate Bibliothecâ.
antiquissimum Ari­ stophanis exemplary and adds that it was so ancient "ut altera interdum dictionis pars ibi desideretur."
The two plays were omitted by Fracini and Gormont, but reappear in Zanetti and all subsequent editions of Aristophanes.
The editions of the Thesmophoriazusae in my possession are as follows:
-(3) Farreus.
Venice, 1542.(4) Grynaeus.
Frankfort, 1544.(5) Gelenius.
Basle, 1547 (sometimes called Froben).(6) Rapheleng.
Leyden, 1600 (sometimes called Plantin).(7) Portus.
Geneva, 1607.(8) Sealiger. Leyden, 1624.(9) Faber. Amsterdam, 1670.(10) Kuster. Amsterdam, 1710.(11) Bergler. Leyden,-1760.(12) Brunek.- London, 1823 (originally published at Strasburg, 1783).
(13) Invernizzi and others.
Leipsic, 1794-1823.
(The notes to this play are by Dindorf.)(14) Bekker.
London, 1829.(15) Bother first edition.
Leipsie, 1829.(17) Dindorf.
Oxford, 1835.(18) Fritzsehe's Thesmophoriazusae.
Leipsie, 1838.(20) Enger's Thesmophoriazusae.
Boni, 1844.(21) Bothe's second edition.
Leipsic, 1845.(24) Hold en. London, 1868.(25) Blaydes.
Halle, 1880.(26) Velsen's Thesmophoriazusae, 1883.(27) Hall and Geldart.
Oxford, 1900.
But the second volume of Messrs.
Hall and Geldart's work was not published until 1901, after my edition of the Frogs and Ecclesiazusae (Vol.
V of this series) had been printed, so that I had not the assistance of their excellent revision for these two plays.
To a little dissertation on the Thesmophoria, published in 1820, Wellauer appended a few valuable critical notes on the text of this play, which are noticed, in their proper places, in this Appendix.
This Comedy has been fortunate enough to attract two excellent editors, Fritzsche and Enger:
the former brimming over with learning, originality, and wit, often making the most untenable suggestions, but supporting them with a wealth of illustration and argument, which extorts our admiration, even though it cannot convince;
the latter careful and sagacious, but far too fond (considering that he was the younger man) of ostentatiously pricking the bubbles which his more brilliant predecessor had blown.
In his Preface he refers to the edition published " a Francisco Fritzschio, magnae viro doctrinae, multaeque lectionis, qui si modestius de se ipse sentiret, neque quidquid in mentem venisset, id omne existimaret effutiendum, majore deniqne uteretur prudentiâ atque cautione, multum posset ad Aristophanem et emen­ dandum et rectius intelligendum conferre."
Fritzsche was not the man sit still under this rebuke, and in the Preface to his edition of the Frogs, published in the following year, he took occasion to refer, apropos of nothing, " nugis Robert!
Engeri, qui si, impudentiâ depositâ, doctrinae copiolas auxerit, forsitan aliquando literis nostris poterit prodesse."
Peace be to their ashes.
We could ill have dispensed with the services of either.
Here, as in the Appendix to the Ecclesiaznsae, I have endeavoured to give, not only a full synopsis of the reading of the MSS., but also a general idea of the changes which have taken place, from time to time, in the text of the printed editions.
No Aristophanic text is so corrupt as that of the Thesmophoriazusae;
and therefore considerable licence of conjecture is not only allowable but necessary.
In the present play, as well as in the Lysistrata, the Ravenna illS.
fails to maintain its usual high standard of accuracy.
It is true that we have the Ravenna MS., says Fritzsche in his Preface, " At qui tandem Ravennas ?
Non is, quern in Nubibns, Ranis, Pluto, Equitibus, Vespis, Pace, Avibus, merito admiramur;
ne is quidem, quern in Acharnensibus et Eccle­ siazusis, non per se et propter se, sed codicis incpiâ melioris, optimam judicamus."
And he goes on to declare, with some exaggeration, that in these two plays it is distinguished " non tam lectionum proprietate aut praestantiâ, quam mendorum et ineptiarum varietate.
"More fortunate than in the Ecclesiazusae, Brunck in this play had access to H., a manuscript little, if at all, inferior to R.2. ἀλοω̑ν R. H. vulgo.
Bisetus ob­ serves βέλτιον ἴσως ἀλω̑ν, a conjecture approved by several editors, but intro­ duced into the text by Holden only.
The aspirate was added to ἅνθρωπος by Bekker.
Before Portus ὲξ ἑωθινου̑ was written as one word ἔ̍ξεωθινου̑.3. οἱ̑όν τε Zanetti, Farreus, Portus, recentiores.

Kuster placed a note of interrogation after this line, which seems wrong ;
but he is followed by Bergler, Fritzsche, Holden, Blaydes, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.
11.
χωρὶς.
The editions before Gry­ naeus have χωροι̑ς, a mere typographical error, since they all have χωρίς ;
two lines below.
12. MN. του̑ μήτ' ἀκούειν μήθ' ὁρα̑ν :
EY.
This mode of punctuating and dividing the line is really found in R. H. and all editions before Brunck ;
but as they omit EY.
at the commencement of line 11, they give to Mnesilochus the three lines and a half from πω̑ς μοι παραινει̑ς to μήθ' ὁρα̑ν ;
Bergler pointed out that EY.
should be prefixed to line 11 ;
and Brunck, adopting this, gave both 11 and 12 as one speech to Euri­ pides, striking out the note of interro­ gation and the EY.
after όρα̑ν.
And this unfortunate change was followed byInvernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, Fritzsche, Weise, and Bothe.
Meanwhile Tyrwhitt and Dobree had suggested the true mode of punctuating and dividing the line :
and even before their Adversaria were published, though long after they were written, it was restored by Thiersch.
Since then it has been adopted by Enger, Bergk, and all subsequent editors.15.
αὑτω̨̑ Brunck, recentiores.
αὐτω̩̑ H. editions before Brunck.
R. has αυτω̨̑, without any breathing.18.
ἀκοη̨̑ δὲ χούνην Dobree, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Hall and Geldart.
Meineke, however, in his Vind.Aristoph., falls away to a conjecture of Bernays, διττὴν δὲ χοάνην.
ἀκοὴν δὲ χοάνης R. H. vulgo.
Scaliger suggested ἀκοη̑ς δὲ χο­ άνην, and so Wellauer and Bothe.
But the dative ἀκοη̨̑ is required as a parallel to ὧ̨ μὲν βλέπειν χρὴ two lines above.
It is equivalent, as Meineke said, to ὧ̨ δὲ ἀκούειν χρή.
Bisetus thought that the words ἀκοὴν δὲ χοάνης might be used, as a joke, for χοάνην δὲ ἀκοη̑ς ;
a curious joke.
Both Reiske and Tyrwhitt sug­ gested δίκην δὲ χοάνης.
It is not an observation of much importance, but there is no instance of this use of δίκην by Aristophanes.
This suggestion is, however, adopted by Enger and Blaydcs, though the latter dissents from it in his footnote.
Fritzsche reads ἀκμη̨̑ δὲ χώνης as- if it were a question of Ether's modus operandi.20.
ἥδομαί γε R. H. vulgo ;
but by a slight typographical error, very slight in those days of contractions, the editions from Gelenius to Bergler (inclusive) have ἥδομαι γὰρ.21.
οἱ̑όν γέ πού 'στιν, after the lemma scholii, Person, Bothe, and Hall and Geldart.
For ye πού ,τέ που 'στὶν, variously accented, is given by R. H. and vulgo.
Brunck read τί που 'στὶν, and is followed by Invernizzi,Dindorf,Thiersch, and Blaydes.
Fritzsche has γέ τοἰστὶν, and so Enger, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, and Velsen.
But of.
Wasps 27 and the line of Eupolis cited in the Commentary on the present line.
24. προσμάθοιμι Wellauer, Dindorf, Enger, Bothe, Bergk, recentiores.

προσμάθοις μὴ Zanetti, Farreus, Grynaeus, Scaliger (in notes), Kuster (in notes), Bergler. προσμάθω μὴ Tyrwhitt, Reiske, Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Fritzsche.
In the editions before Brunck this line and the following were given to Euri­ pides.
27.
σιώπα Dobree, Meineke. σίγα R. H. vulgo.
But Mnesilochus when he says σιωπω̑ τὸ θύριον must be adopting the very words of Euripides.
In the editions called Scaliger's and Faber's, and in Invernizzi, EY. is substituted for γὸ.29.
ἐνταυθ' R. H. vulgo.
Invernizzi, whether by misreading R., or out of his own head, substituted ἐνθάδε δ'.
Wellauer, supposing this to be R.'s reading, observed " recipi potest, modo legatur ἐυθάδ' Ἀγάθων, deleto illo δὲ, quod et sensus et metri causa molestum est, neque obscurum habet corruptelae fontem."
And ἐνθάδ'is accordingly read by Dindorf, Enger, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden.
But it is not R.'s reading, and Invernizzi himself was the only fons corruptelae.30.
'Αγάθων.
The article or aspirate was added by Scaliger, Bentley, and Kuster in their notes, and has been introduced into the text by Brunck and all subsequent editors.
31.
EY.
The mark of a new speaker is prefixed to this line by H. Brunck, and all subsequent editors.
It is omitted by R. and all earlier editors, who give to Mnesilochus everything from ποι̑οςto καρτερός ;
inclusive :
Junta and others reading ποι̑ος οὗτος 'Αγάθων "Εστιν ;
τίς 'Αγάθων;
whilst Gelenius and others read ποι̑ος οὗτος Αγάθων;
Εστιν τις ,Αγάθων ;
32.
ἑόρακας.
All the editions before Brunck have ἑώρακας contra metrum.
Kuster in his note proposed ἑώρακάς ποτε, Dawes proposed ἑώρας, which is approved by Person and followed by Brunck and Invernizzi.
Then Bentley's emendation, έόρακας, came to light, which has been adopted by Bekker and every subsequent editor except Weise :
and is now rendered certain by the discovery that R., who gives the words to Mnesi­ lochus, reads ἑόρακα.
H. has ἑώρακα.
Weise says that no alteration is re­ quired, since ἑώ- is to be read as one syllable, not observing that this, if true, would not mend matters.
38.
ἔοικε.
The omission of ὡς has troubled some recent scholars.
Meineke reads οἷμαί γε, and in his Vind.
Arist.
suggests προθυσομένω̜ δ' ἔοικε, Dindorf and Rutherford think the verse spurious, and Velsen encloses it in brackets.

And so R. originally, but afterwards the final ς was erased, so that the reading became σίγα.
τί λέγει;
which is read by Fritzsche and Enger.
Reiske proposed σίγα.
θΕ. τίς λέγει ;
contra metrum.
Bothe reads σίγα.
MN. τίλέγεις ;
and Meineke, fol­ lowed by more recent editors, σίγα.
MN. τί λέγει;
The common reading seems to me greatly preferable to either of these alterations.

This line is divided as in the text by Junta and all editors before Invernizzi, and by Thiersch, Bekker, Fritzsche, Weise, and Bergk since.
Invernizzi gave the first part to Euripides, and the second to Agathon's servant, and so Bothe, Enger, Meineke, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.
Blaydes leaves the first part to Mnesi­ lochus, but transfers the second to Aga­ thon's servant.
74.
ἐμόν R. H. vulgo.
ἐμὲ is suggested by Brunck, referring to Lys. 714, and Soph. Electra 957 (but cf. 1165 infra), and is read by Blaydes and Yelsen.80.
ἐπεὶτρίτη 'στὶ.
-Not understanding the line Nauek proposes, and Meineke (Vind. Aristoph.) approves, ἐπείπερ ἐστὶ.86. δίκαιά γ'ἂνGrynaeus, Scaliger (in notes), Kuster, Bekker, Bothe, Fritzsche, recentiores.
The reading is commonly attributed to Scaliger, but was adopted.
a century before, by Grynaeus.
δίκαι' ἂν R. all editions, except Grynaeus, before Kuster.
Διὰ δίκαι'ἂν H. Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Thiersch, Din­ dorf.87. ἐκ ταύτης R. H. vulgo.
Bergler proposed ἐκ τούτων, which is adopted by most subsequent editors.
But Reiske proposed ἐπὶ ταύταις.
Wellauer would change ἀτὰρat the commencement of the line into ἄτης.
Fritzsche reads ἐξ αὐτη̑ςιn the sense of forthwith, and so Enger in the form of fK γ'αύτης.
Bergk and one or two more retain ἐκ ταύτης.90.
ἐκκλησιάσοντ' R. vulgo.
ἐκκλησιά­ ζοντ' H. ;
see the Appendix on Ecel. 161.—κἂν R. H. all editions before Brunck, and Fritzsche and Hall and Geldart afterwards.
But Markland (at Eur. Suppl. 364 ἃ'ν τοκευ̑σι δω̜̑) suggested X ἃ'v, and that (as χἄν) has been adopted by Brunck, and, save as aforesaid, all subsequent editors.
It is also approved by Porson.
But I agree with Fritzsche that κἂν δέη̜, if need be, if the occasion should urine, is more probable here than χἂν δέη̜, what shall be required:
though, no doubt, later on, Euripides assumes that his advocate will have to deliver a speech.95. 'Αγάθων.
The aspirate or article was added by Bentley, Brunck, recen­ tiores.
99.
νυ̑ν.
So, I think, we should prob­ ably read.
ἂν R. H. editions before Bergler. αὖ Scaliger in notes, Bergler, recentiores, except as hereafter men­ tioned.
This is supposed to be sup­ ported by the very similar line in Birds 226 οὕποψ μελω̜δει̑ν αὖ παρασκευάζεται, but there the Hoopoe had, while here Agathon has not, already sung.
Thiersch reads ἅ 'ν.
Bergk γὰρ, which is adopted by Velsen and Hall and Geldart.
Meineke for μελω̜δει̑ν ἂν writes μελω̜δίαν.
It seems to me that νι̑ν is nearer the MS.
reading, and also more probable in itself than γὰρ.103.
πατρίδι R.H. vulgo.
πατρία̜ Kuster (in notes), Dobree.
πάτρια Meineke, Holden.
πατρίδι is of course, here as elsewhere, used as an adjective.
Mr. Richards (Classical Review, xvii. 10) suggests πραπίδι.—χορεύσασθε Bentley, Kuster (in notes), Dobree, Fritzsche, recentiores.
χορεύσασθαι R. H. editions before Fritzsche. χορεύσατεScaliger (in notes).—βοα̜̑ Kuster (in notes), Dobree, Meineke, Holden.
βοάν R. H. vulgo.
Kuster was really the first editor who understood the passage.104.
τίνι δὲ Reisig, Dindorf (in notes), Bergk, Blaydes, Velsen.
τίνι (without δὲ) R. H. vulgo.
But this and the follow­ ing line seem to be in the same metre, and the δὲ might easily drop out before δαιμόνων.105.
νυν (or νυ̑ν) R. H. vulgo.
Meineke proposed, and Blaydes reads, νιν.
And for εὐπίστως(R. H. vulgo) Reiske suggested and Blaydes and Velsen read εὐπείστως.107.
ὄλβιζε Dentley,Dindorf (innotes), Enger, Holden, Blaydes, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.
ὃπλιζε R. H. vulgo.

who in his Vind.
Aristoph.
remarks "Bentleius ὄλβιζεconjecit, quae etsi ingeniosa conjectura est, fortasse tamen rectius scripsi ὦ κλη̜̑ζε, mutatione fere nulla."
He does not seem to ob­ serve that his conjecture, besides being supremely ridiculous in itself, goes much further from the original than Bentley's, which is undoubtedly right.
See the Commentary.
Bergk suggests, but does not read, ὄπαζε μούσα.111.
καλλίσταις ἀοιδαι̑ς R. H. vulgo.
καλλίστας Dobree, with great doubt;
but his suggestion is followed by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, Hall and Geldart.115.
ἀείσατ’ Zanetti, and all editors except Junta, Gelenius, and Enger. ἀείσαντ’ R. Junta, Gelenius. ἄεισαντ’ H. ἄεισον Enger.
I do not understand why recent editors call ἀείσατ’ Kuster's conjecture.
He merely followed his predecessors without remark.
It seems probable that some word has been omitted at the commencement of this line, which would make it conform with the preceding, and παρθένον has been suggested.121. ποδὶ 7rap' εὔρυθμα Φρυγίῳ δινεύματα Χαρίτων Bergk (in notes) and (with ἔρρυθμα for εὔρυθμα) Enger, Meineke, Holden, and (with Φρυγίων for Φρυγίῳ) Dindorf.
ποδὶ παράρυθμ’ εὔρυθμα Φρμγίων διανεύματα Χαρίτων R. H. vulgo.
δινεύματα was Bentley's correction, which was adopted by (besides the editors above- mentioned), Brunck, Thiersch, Bothe in his second edition, and all editors since Enger, except Hall and Geldart.
Fritzsche has διὰ νεύματα. For Χαρίτων Bentley (reading Φρυγίων) suggested Κουρήτων.125.
δοκίμῳ R. H. vulgo.
Dindorf sug­ gested δόκιμον which Meineke, Blaydes, Yelsen, and Hall and Geldart accept.
Meineke, however, preferred δοκίμων which Holden accepts.
126.
Φω̑ς... δαιμονίοις ὄμμασι R.H.vulgo.
Many recent editors seek to make this a dactylic line.
Enger changed φω̑ς into φύος, and so Meineke, Holden, Vel­ sen, and Hall and Geldart.
He also inserted τέ σου for which the other four have θεου̑.
But Bothe's suggestion δαί­ μονος ὄμμασιν is far simpler and better.
Meineke, always very inaccurate in his references to the MSS., ascribes Bothe's suggestion to them.
For ὄμμασι Hermann proposed στόμασι, and Bergk οἴμασι.
The latter is brought into the text by Meineke and Holden.
Fritzsche, as a corollary to his alteration in the next line, read τα̑ς for τᾷ in this.
128.
ὧν χάριν.
H. has a line, which signifies a new speaker, before these words ;
and Dr. Blaydes suggests that this verse should be assigned to the actor, and that the following verse is the response of the Chorus.
“Nam in praecedentibus prima persona loquitur Chorus, ἔπομαι κλῄζουσα v. 116, σέβομαι v. 123.
Agatho contra secunda ὄλβιζεv. 107, ἀείσατ’ A-. 115."
This suggestion, though Dr. Blaydes does not himself introduce it into the text, is adopted by Yelsen, and seems to me extremely prob­ able.—ἄγαλλε R. H. Scaliger, Kuster, and Bergler (in their respective notes), Brunck, recentiores.
ἄλλε all editions before Brunck except Zanetti, Farreus, Rapheleng, and Bergler who have ἀλλἀ.
—τιμᾷ is ejected or bracketed by Dindorf and several recent editors.
For ἄνακτ’ ἄγαλλε Φοι̑βον Meineke and Holden read Φοι̑βον ἄνακτ’ ἄγαλλε.
After 129.
ὀλολύζει ὀ γέρων.
This stage- direction is rightly given by Suidas, s.v.
In R. H. the article ὁ is changed into ς, ὀλολύζεις γέρων, so that it naturally became a part of the preceding speech ;
and it so continued till the time of Brunck, though Zanetti and Farreus write it ὀλολύζης I γέρων.
Bentley, how­ ever, enclosed it in brackets, as in my text, for the purpose, not of deleting it as his editors in the Classical Journal sup­ pose, but of showing that it was merely a stage-direction :
a fact which was also recognized by Kuster in his notes.
Brunck and subsequent editors (except Fritzsche) omit it altogether, though many of them retain the corresponding παρεπιγραφὴ after 276 infra.
Fritzsche retains the first word ὀλολ and asks, very sensibly, who would venture to sweep away the stage-directions from modern plays, and so increase the diffi­ culty of understanding them To which Enger solemnly replies that modern editors ‘‘ non ducent fabulas, sed seri­ bunt;
” as if Aristophanes did not also write his plays, and as if the additional fact that they were placed on the stage under his superintendence did not con­ stitute an additional reason for his giving stage-directions.
There seems every reason to believe that these παρεπιγραφαὶ must have been intro­ duced, if not by the hand, at least under the direction, of Aristophanes himself.
130.
πότνιαι all the printed editions except Junta, which, with R. H., lUas πότνια.134. νεανίσχ’ ὄστις vulgo.
νεανίσχ’ εἴ τις R. Junta. νεανίσκ’ εἴ τις H. Grynaeus, Bothe, Thiersch. νεανίσχ’ ἥτις Gelenius to Kuster both inclusive.
Porson sug­ rested νεα̑νις ἥτις which is read by Fritzsche, Enger, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden.135.
Λυκουργίας R. H. vulgo.
Dobree wrote “Λυκουργείας ut ’Ορεστείας Ran.”
This is one of the hasty suggestions of that brilliant scholar, which a little further consideration would have led him to retract.
‘Ορέστεια is properly formed from ‘Ορέστης, as ἀσθένεια from ἀσθενὴς, εὐλάβεια from εὐλβαὴς, εὐσέβεια from εὐσεβὴς, ἀλήθεια from ἀληθὴς, and the like.
But Λυκουργία is properly formed from Λυκου̑ργος, as κακουργία from κακου̑ργος, πανουργία from πανουργος, and the like.
Yet Dobree's mistake, in de­ .
fiance of all theauthorities, has been intro­ duced into the text by Bothe, Thiersch, Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
And in a moment of weakness I allowed my Λυ­ κουργία in the note on Frogs 1124 to be corrected into Λυκουργεία.
For ἔρεσθαι (the present, rarely if ever used) Dindorf substituted the aorist ἐρέσθαι.
And this is generally followed.146.
του̑ φθόνου μὲν τὸν ψόγον R. H. vulgo.
Reiske proposed either to change ψόγον into ψόφον, or to read τὸν φθόνον μὲν του̑ ψόγου.
In the next line for παρεσχόμην (R. H. vulgo), Bergk sug­ gested παρῃσθόμην, Meineke παρέσχετο, and Velsen παρέσχε μοι.
But in neither line has the text been altered :
so again, in the line which follows, Meineke for ἅμα γνώμῃ suggests όμόγνωμον, but does not introduce that astonishing con­ jecture into the text.
149.
χρὴ γὰρ R. (as corrected) H. Bentley, Porson, Invernizzi, recentiores.
All editions before Scaliger read χρὴ alone (without γὰρ) contra metrum.
Scaliger in his note proposed either χρὴ γὰρ or χρὴ τὸν, and χρὴ τὸν was read from Scaliger to Brunck inclusive.
But as Person observed " vox ἀνὴρ, quando juncta est alio substantive, articulum, quod sciam, non asciscit."158.
ἐστυκὼς R. H. vulgo.
ἐστηκὼς Gelenius to Le Fevre (inclusive), In­ vernizzi, Bothe, Meineke.
This innova­ tion destroys the whole point of the interruption.
Agathon had said that a poet should adapt himself to the cha­ racters he is describing.
Whereupon Mnesilochus remarks (either to Agathon or to Euripides) "
When you described Phaedra, did you act like a harlot?"
And again, "
When you describe Satyrs, let me come and describe them with you, adopting the manner in which Satyrs are represented on the stage."
In Bentley's time ἐστηκὼς had possession of the text, and that great critic ob­ served "Lege, ut in Grynaeo, ἐστυκώς. Galenus, Σατυρισμὸς, αἱ τω̑ν αἰδοίων ἐκ­ τάσεις."
And the author of the Etymol.
Magn.
derives the word Σάτυρ
ος from σάθη, τὸ αἰδοι̑ον, though others derive it otherwise.
162. κ‘Αλκαι̑ος R. H. vulgo.
See the- Commentary.
κἀχαιὸς Meineke, Holden. χὼ Κει̑ος (meaning Simonides) Fritzsche, Blaydes.
ἅρχαιος was suggested by Her­ mann and thought probable by Enger.
Velsen omits the word, marks a lacuna , and suggests καὶ πάντες.—οἴπερ ... ἐχύ­ μισαν.
So Bentley from Suidas,s.v.v. ἐμι­ τρώσατο and ἐχύμισαν, and Bisetus makes the same suggestion, οἴπερ is read by Por­ tus and all subsequent editors excepting Hall and Geldart ;
ἐχύμισαν by Kuster and all subsequent editors, οἴ πρερἰ... ἐχύμησαν R. H. and all editors before Portus and Kuster respectively.
οἴ περὶ ... ἐχύμισαν Hall and Geldart, possibly because they object to the use of οἴπερ for the simple definite οἴ.
But this is the constant usage in Aristophanes :
see for example in this very play lines 480 and 1060.163.
διεκινου̑νθ’ ὧδέ πως. See the- Commentary.
διεκίνων ’Ιωνικω̑ς R. H. Junta, Grynaeus, Gelenius, Rapheleng.
διεκινουν ’Ιωνικω̑ς Harpocration (s. v. ’Ιωνικὸς), Suidas (s.v. ἐμιτρώσατο), Za­ netti, and except as aforesaid all editors down to and including Bergler.
Yales, on Harpocration ubi supra, suggested διεκινου̑ντ’ which both Kuster and Bergler approved, though retaining διεκίνουν in their text :
Kuster, too, to assist the metre proposed to omit τε.
But even so the line remained unmetrieal.
" Recte quidem, si sensum loci spectes, Valesius, quo nemo fere elegantiori ingenio has literas tractavit, legebat διεκινου̑ντο, se movebant.
Quod vero dicit Kusterus, particulam τε redundare, in hoc judicium ejus desidero.
Sed ne sic quidem versus sanus erit ;
imo, quod nee Valesius nec Kusterus viderat, misere oneri succumbit.
Verbum enim κινεῖν primam semper producit.
Quo pacto quartam sedem degravat spondeus.
Vide igitur an nos rem acu tetigerimus ;

περὶ τῆς τοῦ Δημοσθένους δεινό­ τητος p. 310 ed. Hudson, τῶν ῥυθμῶν τοὺς ὑπορχηματικούς τε καὶ Ί ωνικοὺς καὶ διακλω­ μένους.
His conjecture is adopted by Brunck and, except as hereinafter men­ tioned, all subsequent editors.
Inver­ nizzi writes the line ἐμιτροφόρουν τε, κᾀδεικανόωντ Ί ωνικῶς.
Thiersch, omitting τε, reads διεκναίοτ'.
Fritzsche, retaining διεκλῶντ in his text, yet disapproves of it in his note, and propounds two other conjectures, (1) διεχλίδων Ί ωνικῶς, omit­ ting the τε ;
and (2) κἀχλίδων Ί ωνικῶς, retaining the τε.
He himself preferred the first form.
The second is introduced into the text by Meineke and Holden :
Bergk reads διέκλων.
St. Chrysostom says TO μαλακὸν ἱμάτιον καὶ τὴν αὐστηρὰν ἐκλύει ψυχὴν, διακλᾷ καὶδιαχεῖ Hom. xxix. in Hebr. (275 B) and frequently uses διάκλασις and διακλωμένους in a similar sense.
Blaydes makes eight conjectures, but does not mean any of them to be adopted.161). κάλ' (or καλὰ) ἦν τὰ δράματα R. H. vulgo.
Dindorf, apparently by an over­ sight, wrote τὰ δράματ'.
ἦν καλά, and this has been followed by several sub­ sequent editors.
168.
Φιλοκλέης and (in the following line) Ξνοκλέης Bentley, Brunck, Din­ dorf, and subsequent editors;
unani­ mously, as regards the latter name ;
but a few of the less recent editors wrote ἆρ6 Φιλοκλῆς in the former line.
Φιλοκλῆς and Ξενοκλῆς R. H. and all editors before Brunck.
In 168 R. has ὦ for the article ὁ.
Line 169 was ori­ ginally omitted in R , but was inserted by a second corrector after line 170.
ό δ' αὖR. and all editors before Brunck. δ' αὖ(without the article) H. Brunck changed this to ὁ δὲ Ξνοκλέης and he has been followed by subsequent editors except Hall and Geldart.171.

"In­ eptissime, ut mihi quidem videtur, poeta Euripidem ad simplicissimam Mnesi­ lochi interrogationem πῶς πρὸς τῶν θεῶν;
respondentem fecit παῦσαι βαΰζων.
Scri­ bendum suspicor παῦσαι βασανίζων."
Meineke.
So that Meineke actually supposed the interruption of Euripides to have special reference to the latest question of Mnesilochus :
and did not perceive that the poet, to whom the matter is one of life and death, is tired out with the unending garrulity of Mnesilochus, and breaks in with the interruption
Do stop that yapping, with­ out the slightest reference to the words just uttered.

διδόναι ' ἐμαυτὸν Bentley and (in their notes) Scaliger, Kuster, and Bergler.
So Brunck originally, though he afterwards went over to Dawes's correction ;
and so Invernizzi, Bekker, Thiersch, and Weise.
And this comes nearest to the unmetrical reading of It. H., διδόναι γ'αὐτὸν, which was read in all editions before Brunck, except that Zanetti and Farreus make matters worse by omitting αὐτὸν altogether.
Dindorf, indeed, says that ἐμαυτὸν was the original reading of H., but Velsen does not con­ firm this.
Dawes proposed 'πιδοὒναι 'μαυτὸν, and this was, on second thoughts, accepted by Brunck, and is read by Meineke, Holden, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.
'πιδιδόναι γ' αὑτὸν Toup, Enger. μηδὲ διδόναιγ'αὑτὸνΒοthe. 'πιδιδόναι 'μαυτὸν Dindorf.

The choice seems to lie between the emendations of Bent­ ley and Dawes :
and that of Dawes is furthest from the MS.
reading, nor does the use'of the compound ἐπιδίωμι by Euripides in vv. 213 and 249 necessitate its use by Mnesilochus in the present passage.
At the commencement of the line, Mr. Richards (Classical Review, xvii. 10) would change ἢ into ἣ.218.
μέντοι It. vulgo. μὲν δὴ H.222. ὤμοι (or ᾥμοι) R. H. vulgo.
οἴμοι Dindorf, who is followed by Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Yelsen.225.
Δήμητρά γ" R.H. Kuster, Bergler, Brunck, Bekker, Weise, and Hall and Geldart.
This, of course, is against Porson's rule, " Post jusjurandum,qualia sunt υὴ Δία, νὴ τὸν Άπόλλω, et cetera hujusmodi, nunquam sequitur particula ΓΕ nisi alio vocabulo interposito," and he therefore in the present line would read Δήμητρ' ἔτ', comparing Wasps 1442, Clouds 814, Plutus 64.
He thought that the γε in this line arose "ex Kusteri interpolatione," and was not aware that it is given in both the MSS., but I do not suppose that, had he been so aware, he would have dealt with it differently.
See the first of the " Observations variae " in his Adversaria, and his note on the present line.
But Porson's rule, though undoubtedly embodying the general usage, is certainly not without exceptions (see Neil's note on Knights 698 and his Appendix [ to that play) ;
and I think that the present line is an exception, and that Mnesilochus uses the particle to emphasize the fact that lie is swearing by the Thesmophorian deity.
Porson's emendation is, however, accepted by Dindorf, Enger, and all subsequent editors down to and in­ cluding Velsen.
All editors before Kuster, and Invernizzi afterwards, have Δήμητρα without the γε. Scaliger sug­ gests, and Fritzsche reads, Δήμήτερ'.
Bothe has Δήμητραν.—
ἐνταυθοῖ R. H. vulgo.
ἐνταυθὶ Dindorf, Enger, Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Yelsen.
For Δή­ μητρά ' ἐνταυθοῖ Thiersch reads Δήμητρ'

ἀτρέμα σαυτὸν R. H. vulgo. " Qu. ἀτρέμας αὐτοῦ ?" Dobree ;
and this sug­ gestion is followed by Meineke and Holden.231.
μῦ μῦ R. H. vulgo.
μυμῦ is intro­ duced by Bothe and Dindorf, and fol­ lowed by several subsequent editors.
In the MSS.
and in the editions of Junta, Gelenius, Portus, and Kuster, the last three words of this line form the commencement of the speech of Mnesi­ lochus, but they obviously belong to Euripides, to whom they are continued by Zanetti and all other editors.233.

But the form which is found in the MSS., both here and in 880 infra, and in the Scholium, seems sufficiently authenticated by in­ scriptions 103 and 3562 in the Corpus Inscriptionum Gracearum.281.
ἀνέρχεθ’ ὐπὸ R. H. vulgo.
Velsen reads ἀνέρχεται after a conjecture of Reiske, who wished to find a genitive for τὸ χρη̂μα.
But, as Enger remarks (and the remark applies to many pas­ sages besides the present), " locus non emendari sed intelligi debet.
"284. κάθελε R. H. vulgo.
κατάθον Herwerden, Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.
But the jingle is quite in the manner of Aristophanes, and is very suitable to the assumed character of Mnesilochus.
If, indeed, Thratta were herself carrying the πόπανα, we should expect the middle ;
and Bergk therefore suggests καθελου̂ ;
but here everything is unreal:
and we do not know from what imaginary place the imaginary Thratta is to take down the imaginary cist.285.
τὸ πόπανον ὡς Bentley, Hermann. τὸπόπανον ὅπως R. H. vulgo.
ὄπως may well have been a corruption of -ov ὡς.
“Versus multo facilius restitui potest, si τὸ ante πόπανον omittitur," says Wellauer, De Thesm.
Diss. p. 37, note.
And this is done by Bothe, Weise, and Enger.
Person in his Adversaria (on Eur. Suppl.
901) suggested τὰ πόπαν’ ὄπως;
but afterwards in his Aristo­ phanica he is said by Dobree to have preferred τὸπόπανον Iva.
The former suggestion is adopted by Fritzsche, Bergk, Meineke, and Holden ;
the latter by Blaydes and Velsen.
For ταιν θεαîν, both here and in 948, 1151 infra, and Wasps 378, Cobet would write τοιν θεοîν, and Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart so write it.
It is true that the Twain Goddesses are in adjurations uniformly styled τὼ θεὼ, but in other cases the usage was by no means uniform.
The Scholiast on 566 infra says, τὼ θεώ οὐκέτι δὲ τοîν θεοîν ἀλλὰ ταîν θεαîν.289.
τὴν θυγατέρα H. and (as corrected) R. vulgo.
τὴν θυγατέραν R. originally.
τὸν θνγατέρ
ος is proposed by Scaliger, Kuster, and Bergler in their notes, and adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, and Weise.
Meineke's wanton altera­ tion of the words into του̂ θυγατρίου followed by Yelsen and by Hall and Geldart.—Χοιρίον Fritzsche, Enger, and the Scholiast obviously so read.
χοîρον R. H. vulgo.290.
ἄλλως ’R.
H. vulgo.
ἄλλως δ’ Hermann, and this is adopted by Bothe and several recent editors.
Junta and Grynaeus present the latter part of the line in a very peculiar way, viz.
ἀλλως τη̂ λ ίθι οὐκ ἀβελτέ ρου.291.
Ποσθάληκον Fritzsche.
πρὸς θά­ ληκον R. H. vulgo.
Bisetus, Scaliger, Kuster, and Bergler in their notes pro­ pose, and Brunck, Bekker, and Weise read πρὸς φάλητα.
πρὸς φαλλικὸν Za­ netti,Farreus,Invernizzi:
the last-named considering it, wrongly, the reading of R. Kuster suggested πρὸς θύλακόν rE.
Thiersch reads πρὸς τὸ πρόσθε and sug­ gests πρὸς Θαλη̂ν τὸν, while Bothe reads πρὸς τὸ ληκᾳ̑ν.
Notwithstanding the explanation of the Scholiast, τὸν παι­ δαρίσκον’ ἴσως δὲ παρὰ τὴν πόοθην αὐτὸ συνέθηκεν, it does not seem to have oc­ curred to any editor before Dindorf that this line is a prayer for the welfare of an imaginary boy.
He read ποσθαλίσκον, not as a proper name but as a comic equivalent to παιδαρισκον, and is followed by Enger, Meineke, recentiores.
But this would require the article, as θυματέρα above :
and Ποσθάληκον, as a proper name, both accounts for the reading of the MSS.
and answers rightly to the daughter's name Χοιρίον.294.
δούλοις γὰρ.
Meineke would omit this line, and it is bracketed by Velsen and Hall and Geldart.300.
τῇ
Γῇ R. H. vulgo.
The words are omitted by Dobree, Bothe, Enger, Holden, and Yelsen, and bracketed by Fritzsche, Bergk, and Blaydes.
Reiske omits the τῇ.306.
τὴν δρω̑σαν καὶ. τὴν Grynaeus, Dindorf, Bergk.
And according to Bekker, R., as corrected, so reads.
The καὶ is omitted in the original R. and in H., and in all editions except Grynaeus before Dindorf.
But at Reiske's sug­ gestion Brunck added the enclitic τ’ to the second τὴν, and this is followed by most of the subsequent editors except as herein mentioned.
Helwig for δρω̑σαν proposed ὁρω̑σ αν, and this strange con­ jecture is approved by Meineke (Vind. Ar.) and introduced into the text by Holden and Velsen.
Bothe and Velsen omit the words καὶ τὴν ἀγορεύ
ουσαν,307.
τω̑ν Ἀθηναίων R. H. vulgo.
τὸν Ἀθηναίων Dindorf, Bergk, recentiores.
Bothe, Blaydes, and Velsen omit or bracket the words τω̑ν Ἀθηναίων καὶ.310.
εὔχεσθε
It vulgo.
εὔχεσθαι H.— ὑμῖν R. vulgo. ἡμῖν H. Bothe, Thiersch. —τἀγαθά R. H. vulgo.
Dindorf sug- gested πολλὰ κἀγαθά, which Velsen adopts.
Meineke and Holden read πάντ’ ἀγαθά, a probable alteration.311.
ἰὴ παιὼν (twice) R. Dindorf, Bergk, and subsequent editors down to, and including, Velsen ;

οἰκοῦσα R. H. vulgo.
ἒχουσα, besides being more rhythmical, seems more natural after the Δη̑λον ὂς ἒχεις two lines above.
331.
The words τοȋς θεοȋσι are omitted by Zanetti, whilst Grynaeus for θεοȋσι τοȋς has simply θεοȋς.334.
τοȋς τ ἄλλοις Grynaeus.
Brunck, recentiores, except Invernizzi.
The reading is sometimes attributed to Scaliger, but wrongly.
καὶ τοȋς ἒλλοις;
R. H. and the other editions.
337. Μήδοις τ’ Scaliger (in notes), Kuster, recentiores, except Invernizzi.
Μήδοις (without any copula) R. H. edi­ tions before Kuster, and Invernizzi.
Blaydes, with some probability, sug­ gests but does not read ἣ Μήδος.340.
κατεȋπεν Bentley, Elmsley (at Ach. 178), Bothe, Enger, Meineke, re­ centiores.
κατεȋπέν τις R. H. editions (except Grynaeus) before Brunck. κατεȋπέ τις Grynaeus, Scaliger (in notes), Brunck, and subsequent editors, except those mentioned above.
346.
έταίρα R. H. vulgo.
The Scho­ liast mentions another reading έταίρᾳ, which he explains as meaning “receives gifts from a courtesan for handing over a lover to her," and Fritzsche adopts this reading.
John Seager would read έταίρας, And treacherously entertains a friend's lover.351.
κἀγαθά R. H. vulgo.
τἀγαθά Za­ netti, Farreus, Rapheleng, Kuster, Bergler.
But see the terms of the Pse­ phism of Demophantus set out in the Commentary on 331.352-4.
ξυνευχόμεσθα ... γενέσθαι.
The first three lines of this Chorus are sup­ posed to be antistrophieal to the first three lines of the preceding Chorus, the remainders of the two Choruses diverging into very different metrical systems.
This does not seem sufficiently probable to justify any serious altera­ tion of the language of either, though where, as in the first word of the present line, a very slight and immaterial change will suffice to bring the two into har­ mony, it seems right to adopt it.
ξυνευ­ χόμεσθα Bothe, Thiersch, Dindorf, re­ centiores.
ξυνευχόμθα R. H. vulgo.
In the third line (τάδ’ εὕγματα γενέσθαι R. H. vulgo) it is thought that the fourth syllable should be long, or doubled into two short syllables, to make the systems correspond, but no probable alteration has been suggested.
Dindorf reads εὕγματ’ ἐκγενέσθαι and is followed by Bergk and Blaydes :
Fritzsche reads δὕγματ’ αὖ γενέσθαι. Meineke (V. A.) proposes τάδε γ’ εὕγματα, which does not meet the difficulty, but is adopted by Holden.
Velsen reads ἄπαντα τάδε γενέσθαι.353.
τέλειί τε R. all editions before Brunck, and Invernizzi and Fritzsche afterwards.
For τε H. has δὲ. and so Brunck and the other subsequent editions.
iut it is the δὲ in the fourth line which answers to the μἐν in the first.
Fritzsche refers to Peace 162, 163 ;
Lys. 262, 263.355. ὄσαις R. vulgo.
ὄσαι H. Junta, Rapheleng. ὄσα Scaliger (in notes), ὄσ ἃν προσήκῃ Meineke (in V. A.), Holden.
But Meineke's conjecture is founded on the erroneous notion that ὅσαις is merely the conjectura nescio cujus,” and that both MSS read ὄσαι.356.
Χγούσαις It. 11. vulgo.
λεγούσας Dindorf, Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.360. οὕνεκ’ Bentley, Dindorf, and most recent editors.
It. H. and the editions before Dindorf had ἒνεκ’.
Bentley said “ Lege εἴνεκ’ vel οὕνεκ’, ut 366," and οὕνεκ has been read since Dindorf's time, except by a few editors who prefer everywhere to read εἴνεκ’.365, 366. γῃ̑ κερδῶν Velsen, Hall and Geldart.
τη̑ς χώρας MSS.
vulgo.
This made no sense.
Brunck omitted οὕνεκα, and so made the lines intelligible, but at the expense of the metre.
Weise follows Brunck.
Bothe went further, and omitted the three words οὕνεκ’ ἐπὶ βλάβῃ.
Fritzsche for χώρας read ὥρας.
Meanwhile Reiske proposed to read κερδῶν, as six lines above.
It seems to me very probable that the words κερδῶν οὕνεκα ἐπὶ βλάβῃ are a formula used in the ’Αρὰ, and are repeated here, and I have therefore, with Velsen and Hall and Geldart, adopted Reiske's suggestion as to line 366.
Reiske, however, threw back χώρας into line 365, so making that line unmetrical ;
and I have there­ fore, again with Hall and Geldart, adopted, though with some hesitation, Velsen's conjecture γῃ̑.
Meineke's lamentable suggestion ἢ μοιχοὺς ἀπά­ γουσι γη̑ς only shows, as indeed many of his conjectures show, how incapable a really eminent scholar may be of entering into the true spirit of Aristo­ phanic humour.368. ἀλλ’ ὦ παγκρατὲς [εὐμενὲς].
I have added εὐμενὲς in brackets.
See the Commentary.
It does not seem to have been observed that this is part of a glyCOlliC line, the remainder of which, probably another epithet of Zeus, has dropped out.373.
ἄκουε πα̑ς R. H. vulgo.
Fritzsche, in the Addenda to his edition (p. 635), suggests ἄκουε πα̑σ’, which is adopted by Enger, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.­ τάδε R. H. vulgo.
ταδὶ Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes.386. υ̒μα̑ς R. H. vulgo.
η̒μα̑ς Grynaeus, Meineke, recentiores.

μοιχοτρόπους Suidas (s.v. οἰνοπίπας),Zanetti, Farreus, Brunck, Bothe, Fritzsche, Enger, recentiores.
The MS.
reading is far preferable.
We are supposed to be listening to the language of Euripides, to whom such a word as μοιχοτρόπ
ους would have been abhorrent;
and besides it would have practically the same meaning as ἀνδρε
ραστρίας, which immediately follows it.394.
ἀνδράιν.
The final v was added by Kuster.
It is omitted in the MSS.
and earlier editions.398.
ὥσπερ καὶ R. H. vulgo.
Cf. Eccl. 221-228. ὧνπερ is suggested for ὥσπερ by Kuster, and is read by Fritzsche, Meineke, and Velsen ;
the last-named changing also καὶ into ἦν.400.
ἐάν τις νυ̑ν πλέκῃ, I have added the vvv. ἐάν τις πλκῃ (a syllable short) R. H. and all editions before Brunck.
Kuster suggested ἐάν γέ τις πλέκῃ, which is read by Brunck and all subsequent editors before Meineke, except Thiersch (who has ἐάν τινί τις), Fritzsche (who has ἐάν τέ τις), and Enger (who marks a lacuna).
Other modes of supplying the missing syllable have been :
ἐάνπερ τις Meineke, Hall and Geldart;
ἐάν τις καὶ Dobree, Holden ;
ἐάν τίς τῳ Blaydes, after another suggestion of Dobree ἐάν ἔνα τις Schneider, Velsen ;
while Bentley proposed ἐάν τίς που, and Bergk ἐὰν πλέκῃ νέα.403.
ἁνὴρ.
Here the aspirate, or article, was added by Brunck;
in ἁδελφὸς two lines below by Scaliger and Bentley ;
and in ἱίνδρες (infra 409) by Dindorf.411.
γέρων and (in the following line) θέλει R. H. vulgo.
ἔτι and ἐθέλει Bach­ mann.
Both alterations are adopted by Velsen ;
and the last by Hall and Geldart also.419.
ταμιευ̑σαι καὶ Reiske, Fritzsche, Enger, Meineke, Holden, Yelsen, and Hall and Geldart.
ταμιεύεσθαι
It. H. vulgo.
Kuster suggested αὺταȋσι ra­ μιείου, and Brunck so reads ;
whilst Blaydes adopts Dobree's suggestion, ταμιευούσαις, and reads αὐταȋς ταμιευού­ σαις προαιρύσαις λαθεȋν, a line which could not have proceeded from Aristo­ phanes.
—λαβεȋν R. H. vulgo. λαθεȋν Scaliger (in notes), Dobree, Bothe, Meineke, Holden, Blaydes, Yelsen, and Hall and Geldart.
But the question here is not one of secrecy or detection ;
it is a question of their ability or in­ ability to take the things.
Their griev­ ance is not that they cannot take them without detection, but that they cannot take them at all.
424.
οὐκ ἦν.
So I think we should read.
οὖν ἦν R. H. vulgo.
Bentley said, “ Lege ἀνθυποȋξαι vel Προτου̑ μὲν οὐκ ἄλλ’ ἦν.”
But the change which I have made is certainly simpler, and (I think) more satisfactory.433.
οὔποτε Thiersch. οὔπω τε R. (originally).
οὐπώποτε H. and (as cor­ rected) R. vulgo.
οὔπω Hermann, Din­ dorf, Weise, Enger, Meineke, recentiores.437.
ἐξετάζει Fritzsche, which restores the metre, and harmonizes well with λέγει in the preceding line.
ἐξήτασεν R. H. vulgo.— παντα δ’ It. If. vulgo.
Enger suggests πα̑ν τ’, and Holden reads πάντ’.—ἐβάστασεν Thiersch, which Enger approves.
ἐβάστασεν φρένι R. H. vulgo.
φρένι ι is destructive of the metre, and unnecessary to the sense, and is probably a mere explanatory gloss which has crept into the text.
Velsen transposes and rewrites the passage out.
of all recognition.440. παρ’ αὐτὴν Zanetti, Farreus, Berg­ ler, recentiores, except Fritzsche and Velsen.
And so Scaliger and Kuster in their notes.
And so Elmsley (at Medea 262), who was the first to arrange rightly the concluding lines of this Chorus.
παρ’ αὐτη̑ς R. H. all other editions before Bergler ;
and Fritzsche afterwards.
μετ’ αὐτὴν Bachmann, Velsen.— Ξενοκλέης Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
Ξενοκλη̑ς R. H. editions before Brunck.443.
ὀλίγων μὲν ἕνεκ’ αὐτὴ.
See the Commentary.
ὀλίγον ἕνεκ’ αὐτὴ R. H. Zanetti, Farreus.
And so (with ὀλίγων for ὀλίγον all other editions before Brunck.
This made the line a syllable too short, and many attempts have been made to restore the missing syllable.
Bentley proposed αὐτηὶ or αὐτὴ τῃ̑δε :
Kuster ἕνεκέν γ’:
Bergler ἕνεκά y, which is adopted by Brunck and Invernizzi.
Bothe reads ἕνεκεν.
Porson proposed καὐτὴ, which is followed by Bekker and all subsequent editors except Bothe.446.
ἁνὴρ.
The aspirate was first added by Brunck, who also first restored the final ν to ταȋσιν in 450.
The final v in ἁπάσαισιν 453 was added by Kuster.452.
οὐδ’ εἰς ἥμισυ It. H. vulgo.
ούδὲ θἤμισυ Hamaker, Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes.45G.
Tots λαχάνοις Bentley, Brunck, recentiores.
The article is omitted in R. H. and all editions before Brunck, but is retained, as Brunck observed, in Plutarch's " Comparison of Aristophanes and Menander,”and Aulus Gellius xv. 20.460.
ἢ τὸ πρότερον R. HI. vulgo.
Bothe omits these words, which is certainly an improvement to the rhythm.461.
κατεστωμύλατο R. H. vulgo.
κὰστω­ μύλατο Dobree, Dindorf, Fritzsche, Enger to Velsen inclusive.
But Aristophanes seems to have commenced this line with a dactyl, corresponding to the πάντα δ’ ἐβάστασεν in 437 supra.
The compound καταστωμύλλομι is found also in Frogs 1160.472.
ἔκφορος R. H. vulgo.
ἐκΦορὰ Valckenaer (at Eur. Hipp. 294), Brunck, and subsequent editions before Fritzsche;
and Weise and Blaydes afterwards.475.

δράσας the other editions before Bergler.477.
πολλὰ δείν’ Dawes, Brunck, recen­ tiores, except Bothe who prefers his own ridiculous πολλὰ πόλλ’.
The MSS.
and all the editions before Scaliger's omit δείν’, and so leave the line a syl­ lable too short.
And so Kuster and Bergler.
Bisetus proposed ἐκεȋυο δ’ οὐν ὅτι, which is read in the editions called ‘Scaliger's” and "Faber's."
Bentley proposed δείνα πόλλ’, Dawes πολλὰ δείν’ or πολλὰ δρω̑σ’.478. ’καθεȋδεν or καθευ̑δεν or καθηȋδεν).
Zanetti, Farreus, Grynaeus, Bergler, re­ centiores.
καθεύδειν R. H. Junta, Gele­ nius to Kuster inclusive.
But Scaliger, Bentley, and Kuster had all corrected it in their notes.
480.
διεκόρευσεν R.H. vulgo.
διεκόρησεν Pollux, iii. segni. 42, Fritzsche, Meineke, Blaydes, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.
Both forms, as Brunck observes, are found in Lucian and elsewhere.—
σὖσαν ἑπτέτιν Pollux, ubi supra, Scaliger, re­ centiores.
The words are transposed in R. H. and the editions before Sca­ liger.482.
κἆ̣τ’ R. H. vulgo.
Meineke sug­ gests, and Velsen reads, κἀγὼ.486.
ἄννηθον Thiersch, Dindorf, Fritzsche, Enger. recentiores.
ἄνηθον R. H. and the other editions.
Dobree suggested488.
Kuster. recentiores, except Bergk and Meineke.

Fritzsche suggested, and Bergk and Meineke read, ἐρείδομαι.489.
κίβδ’ H. Brunck, recentiores. κύδ' R. editions before Brunek, though Bergler suggested the true reading.490.
εἶφ',ὁρα̑τ R.H. Grynaeus, Bentley, Brunck, reeentiores. ἐφ' ὸρα̑τ' Junta. ἐφωρα̑τ' Zanetti, Farreus, Gelenius, and all subsequent editions before Brunck.
Dawes suggested εἶφ', όρα̜̑ς.495. ἵν'ὀσφρόμεν
ος ὰνὴρ ἀπὸ τείχους εἰσ­ ιών.
So Bentley ordered the line (except that the aspirate was added to ἀνὴρ by Dawes, and Elmsley at Ach. 179).
But Dawes went astray in the latter part of the line.
"Maluit Dawesius," says Elmsley, " ἀπὸ του̑ τείχους ἰών;
sed arti­ culus recte abest, ut in Av. 497, ἒξω τείχους."
He might have added that εἰοιὼν, when he comes in, is necessary to the sense of the passage.
The line is read as in the text by Bothe, Fritzsche, Enger, recentiores. ἵν' ὀσφραινόμεν
ος ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ του̑ τείχους εἰσιὼν R. H. editions before Brunek ;
and Weise afterwards.
Brunck substituted εὐθὺς for ὀσφραινό­ μενος, and was followed by Invernizzi and Bekker.
Thiersch and Dindorf, having pushed ἵνα into the preceding line, retain ὀσφραινόμενος and finish the line as in the text.
500.
οἷόν γ' ὑπ' αὐγάς Bachmann, Vel­ sen. ὑπ' αὐγὰς οἷον R. H. vulgo, contra metrum.
Bentley suggested, and Bothe reads, ὑπαυγὲς, which is probably right.
όποι̑ον ὑπ' αὐγὰς Fritzsche.
Dindorf sug­ gested, and Blaydes reads, ὑπ' ὀρθρὸν, which does not give the right sense for the present passage.504.
περιήρχετ R. H. vulgo.
Elmsley (at Heracleidae 210) observes that ἠρχό­ μην is seldom used, and though he gives several unquestionable examples of its use, yet suggests that here we should substitute either περιη̜̑εν or περιηρρεν.
Holden reads περιή̜ειν. Bergk conjectured περιέτρεχ', which is read by Meineke, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.—ὠκυτόκι' Pollux, ii. 7, Sehäfer (at Bos. Ellips. p. 512), Bothe, Dindorf, recentiores, ex­ cept Weise.
ὠκυτόκεια R. H. editions before Bothe ;
and Weise afterwards.512.
ἣ 'φερεν.
The final v was added by Brunck.
The MSS.
and earlier editions have ἣ ἔφερε.514. αὐτέκμαγμα Reiske, Bekker, re­ centiores, except Hall and Geldart. αὖτ' εἴγμα all editions before Scaliger.
Scaliger in his notes suggested αὖτ' ἔïγμα, but the edition which bears his name (with R. H. Pollux, Eustathius, and Suidas) has αὖτ' ἔκμαγμα, and so all subsequent editions before Bekker ;
and Hall and Geldart.532.
πλὴν ἄρ' εἰ R. Fritzsche, Enger, Meineke, recentiores.
Fritzsche refers Birds 601, Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 21, and Euripides Danae (Stob. x. 18), but there Porson and Gaisford read εἷς.
Fritz­ sche himself, however, changes γυναι̑κες into γυνή τις. πλὴν ἄρ' ἣ H. vulgo.533. "Αγραυλον R. H. all editions before Brunck, and Bergk afterwards.
"Αγλαυρον Brunck and all subsequent editions except Bergk.
Brunck based his change on the theory (first, I believe, propounded by Musgrave on Eur. Ion 23) that the wife of Cecrops was named Agraulus, and their daughter Aglaurus.
But doubtless the mother and daughter bore the same name ;
Agraulus and Aglaurus are merely different forms of the same word ;
and I suspect that the true form in each case is Agraulus.
If the daughter is called Aglaurus by Hdt. (viii. 53), Pausanias (i. 18), Hesychius (s.v.'Αγραυλος), and Ovid (Met. ii. 777), she is called Agraulus by Aristophanes here, Plutarch (Alcibiades, chap. 15), Apollodorus (iii. 14. 2), Ulpian on Demosthenes De F. L. 346 (p. 348), and Philochorus there mentioned.
In the text of Demosthenes, ubi supra, several MSS.
have "Αγραυλος, and several "Αγ­ λαυρος. Dr. Blaydes, though he follows Brunck, yet says very sensibly, '' Scri­ pturae "Αγραυλος certe favet analogia nominum Πάνδροσος et "Ερση.
Euphoniae autem gratiaâ nonnunquam "Αγλαυρος, scriptuin esse satis credibile est :
nam per se nomen "Αγλαυρος non habere videtur undo derivari potuerit."
There seems no sense in altering the IIS.
reading for the purpose of making the names of the mother and daughter disagree:
a disagreement which Apol­ lodorus denies, and no ancient author affirms.
And see the Annotations of Maussacus on Harpocration, s.v. Περί­ πολος, and the note of Vales on those Annotations ;
and Hemsterhuys on Pollux, vii. segm.

In the MSS.

Brunck says '· E puriori Atticismo excudi debuit η̜̆δης '' ;

Of these forms one is as "pure Attic " as the other ;
the '' purer Attic ·' merely means the form which none but Attics used.
555.
μὰ Δἴ οὐδέπω τὴν Dobree, Din­ dorf, Fritzsche, Enger, recentiores.
For οὐδέπω the MSS.

Various modes of sup­ plying the missing syllable have been suggested. μὰ τὸν Δί' οὐ τὴν Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker. μὰ Δί οὐδὲ τήν γε Bentley, Bothe, Weise, though in his second edition Bothe changed to μὰ Δί', οὺδὲ δὴ τὴν.

σι̑τον R. II.
all editions before I Brunck. olvov Kuster (in notes), Brunck, recentiores.
Velsen says that Pollux reads oivov, but this is an entire mistake.
Pollux has a chapter (Book vi, chap.
2) on the vessels appertaining to wine, and amongst other things he mentions the siphon, used for tasting wine.
He then adds as an independent sentence, "Aristophanes uses the verb σιφωνίζειν."
It is impossible to say whether he is alluding to the present, or to some lost, passage of Aristophanes ;
but assuming him to refer to the present passage, he is perfectly right.
Aristophanes does here use the verb σιφωνίζειν, and not only so, but he of course means it to be understood in the sense of drawing out wine, though παρὰ προσδοκίαν, he sub­ stitutes aΙΤον for οἶνον.
With the use to which Aristophanes puts the verb Pollux, whose work is a mere register of words, has nothing to do ;
and there is not even a presumption that he read οἶνον here.
The Scholiast and Suidas both read σι̑τον.
Nor is there a dis­ cordant note in any grammarian.

τὸν ἄυδρα τω̜̑ πελέκει γυνὴ R. H. vulgo.
This gives an anapaest in the fourth foot of an iambic tetrameter catalectic, contrary to the rule laid down by Person in the supplement to his preface to the Hecuba.
But that rule has been strenuously, and I think successfully, disputed.
Person himself, referring to Suidas, who under the word κατεσπόδησε, says κατέκοψε Ετέρα τὸν ἄνδρα τω̜̑πελέκει κατεσπόδησε, adopts that reading here, and omits γυνη.
He is followed by Meineke but by nobody else.
And Suidas is obviously quoting carelessly, and has transferred ετερα from the next line, where it is right, to the present, where it is wrong.
Enger says that if any change were necessary it would be easy to transpose γυνὴ to the second place, and this is done by Holden and Velsen.
Blaydes for τῷ πελέκει γυνὴ reads γ’ἡγυνὴ πελέκει.
But all other editors retain the MS.

Brunck interposed a σὲ between these two words, not observing that the pronoun is already given in the preceding line;
and he is followed by Invernizzi.571.

It is one of the reasons for Cleisthenes coming.
He came ῖνα τηρῆτε καὶἵνα μὴ προσπέσῃ.
But Kuster, supposing the words to be governed by τηρῆτε, proposed μή τι, which is read by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Bekker.
Far better than this is Porson’s μὴ καὶ, which is adopted by Bothe, Thiersch, Dindorf, and all subsequent editors.581.

R. H. and all the editions before Brunck simply omit εἴμ’, so leaving the line a syllable short.
Brunck read ἤρου;
KA. ναί.
And this is followed by Invernizzi, Bekker, and Bothe.
Bentley proposed either εἴμ’ ἤρου ;
or ἤpου ;
τοῦ.
The former conjecture was made independently by Tyrwhitt and Person, and is adopted by Dindorf, Thiersch, Weise, Enger, and all sub­ sequent editors ;
the latter is adopted by Fritzsche.606.
ἤτις ἔσθ’ R. H. vulgo.
εἴτις ἔσθ’ Zanetti, Farreus.—ἤδ’ἡ.
The reading of R. and all editions except Grynaeus before Portus was ἤδε contra metrum.
Bentley proposed ἤδ’ ἡ or ἡδὶ.
The former is found to be the reading of H. and is adopted by Portus and all sub­ sequent editors to and including Bekker;
and by Thiersch ,Dindorf, Weise, Blaydes, and Hall and Geldart.
The latter is apparently read by Grynaeus (though the accent is on the ἡ), and is followed by the other editors subsequent to Bekker.624.
ὄσ’ἔτη R. H. vulgo.
ότέτη Sehäfer, Dindorf, Thiersch, recentiores, except Weise and Bergk.
There seems no reason for any change.
The form ὄσαἔτη, every year, is found three times in Xen.
De Rep. Ath. iii. 4, whilst ὁσέτο, though doubtless an unexception­ able form, does not seem to occur else­ where.625.
ὀίμοι τάλας.
These two words in the MSS., and generally, are the com­ mencement of Cleisthenes's speech ;
but are transferred to Mnesilochus by Schäfer, Bekker, Fritzsche, Enger, Bergk, and others :
and this seems a much better arrangement.
Mnesilochus feels that he has come to the end of his tether, and that instant detection is impending.631.
τίδαὶ Bentley :
for his editors are mistaken in referring this to the following line ;
there he proposes τί δ’ αὖ.
TL δὲ It. H. vulgo. — μετὰ τοῦτο Suidas (s.v. προπίνει),Zanetti,recentiores.
με TOVTO R. H. Junta.633. Ξένυλλ’R. H. Brunck, recen­ tiores.
ξένη μ’all editions before Brunck.
But both Bisetus and Bentley called attention to the fact that Pollux, x. chap. 9, cited, as from the Polyeidus of Aristophanes, the line σκάΦιον Ξένυλλ’ ᾔτησεν, ov γὰρ ἦν ἀμίς ;
and Bisetus sug­ gested that we should so read the present line, and with this Kuster and Bergler agreed.
Finally Brunck, from H , re­ stored the true reading.634. δεσῦρ’ ὦ R. (as corrected) and all printed editions.
δεῦρο R. (originally) and H.—Κλείσθενες all printed editions.
Κλεισόσθενες R. H.635. ἀνὴ(ivr)(j.
The article, or aspirate, was first added by Bentley, and has been adopted by Brunck and all sub­ sequent editors.646.
μἀλλὰ (or μὴ ἀλλὰ)
Bentley, Din­ dorf, Thiersch, Fritzsche, recentiores.
ἀλλὰ R. H. and all other editions before Fritzsche.647.
ἰσθμόν k.T.λ.
This line was omitted in R. and H., but is written by a corrector in the margin of each.
In R. it is written in the right place ;
in H. three lines too high.
Nor is it found in any edition before Portus.
Bisetus, however, pointed out that this and the following line are quoted as one speech by Suidas, s. v. ἰσθμὸς, and that the text here should be reformed accordingly.
And the line has been replaced by Portus and all subsequent editors.
657.
ἐσελήλυθε Bentley, Kuster, re­ centiores, except as hereinafter men­ tioned.
ἐσελήλυθεν It H. εἰσελήλήλυθν all editions before Kuster except Gry­ naeus, who has εἰσελήλυθε.
Bentley also suggested, as an alternative, εἰσήλυθε ;
and Elmsley (at Ach. 42) εἰσῆλθεν.
Fritzsche reads ἀνελήλυθε, referring to the passages cited in the Commentary on 585 supra.
This is a very infelicitous alteration, since the question is not who has "ascended" the hill on which the Temple stood, which anybody might do;
but who has " entered into the Temple " itself, from which men were excluded.
Yet, after having been justly rejected by Enger, Bergk, Meineke, and others, it has been adopted by Blaydes, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.658.
διαθρῆσαι Kuster in his notes, Brunek, recentiores.
ἀθρῆσαι R. H. and all editions before Brunck.
ἀθρῆσαι formed a separate line in R. and in all editions before Portus, who was the first to elevate it into its proper place.— πύκνα R. H. vulgo ;
but Brunck, Bothe, and Weise prefer to write it πνύκα.665.

See the Commentary.
μὴ λάθῃ R. H. vulgo.
ληφθῇ Reisig.
Blaydes.
The discovery that lines 667-686 are antistrophical to lines 707-725 has naturally called forth a variety of at­ tempts to bring the two systems into exact metrical uniformity.
That they were originally uniform cannot be doubted, but each system has fallen into disrepair, and if we correct one by the other, we may be altering a genuine text to make it correspond with a cor­ rupt one.
Occasionally they can be brought into conformity by an altera­ tion which commends itself on other grounds ;
and occasionally the metre shows which system is necessarily right:
But several scholars have gone beyond these isolated points, and have elabo­ rated complete systems, involving great and (except for this purpose) unneces­ sary alterations.
These have met with no acceptance, and are too lengthy to be cited here.
671.
ἀθέων τε τρόπων.
After these words an anapaestic dipody seems to have fallen out.
Fritzsche adds a second παράδειγμα.674.
δαίμονας.
After this word an iambic dipody has dropped out.
Velsen completes the line by reading δαιμόνων δίκην ἀεὶ.679.
οὐχ ὅσιόν τι δρῶν.
So I venture to read, to bring the strophe more into accord with the antistrophe.
ἀνόσιόν τι δρῶν Hermann, Enger, Blaydes, Vel­ sen, and Hall and Geldart.
ὅσια δρῶν R. H. Junta, Grynaeus, Gelenius, and (as a counsel of despair) Thiersch, Dindorf, Fritzsche, Bergk.
ἀνόσια δρῶν Zanetti,Farreus, Rapheleng, recentiores, except as herein mentioned.
οὐκέθ᾽ ὅσια δρῶν Meineke, Holden.
It seems clear that these lines αὐτῶν...παράκοπ
ος should be brought, as far as possible, into coil­ formity with the three iambic dimeters of 718-20 ἀλλ᾽ οὐ ... ἀνοσίους, and that the endeavour of some recent editors to bring those iambic dimeters into con­ formity with the present lines is an endeavour to spoil what is obviously right by bringing it into conformity with what is obviously wrong.
689.

ἆ ἆ (extra metrum) ποῖ R. H. and (save as hereafter mentioned) all editions before Brunck.
ἔα (extra me­ trum) ποῖ Zanetti, Farreus, Rapheleng.
The question is, as Bergler observed, whether a second ποῖ should be added or one ἆ omitted and so a single sena­ rius formed.
The latter alternative is adopted by Weise and subsequent edi­ tors :
but both MSS.
give the ἆ ἆ as extra metrum, and it is obvious that the doubled ποῖ is more in character with the Woman's speech, οὗτος, οὗτος, τάλαινα τάλαινα.691.

a reading which doubtless arose from -η- intended as a correction of -εο- having slipped in beside it.
See on 684-6 supra.697.
αὶ τροπαῖον Scholiast on Plutus 453, Zanetti, Farreus, Rapheleng, Kus­ ter, recentiores.

and Brunek, Invernizzi, Bekker, and Dindorf.
ἅπαντ᾽ Gelenius to Bergler nclusive.
Kuster in his notes sug­ gested ἅπαντά γ᾽.—ἔργα R. IT. vulgo.
Suidas (s.v. ἅπαντα) gives, as a proverb, ἅπαντα τόλμης πλέα κὰναισχυντίας, a pro­ verb doubtless derived from the present line, as indeed very many of the pro­ verbs preserved by the paroemiographers are derived from Aristophanes.
Person wrote in the margin of his copy of Portus, " Forte ἅπαντα μεστά. Vide Pae. 554," and this suggestion is carried out by Meineke, Blaydes, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart;
Blaydes writing ὡς ἅπαντα μεστὰ τόλμης ἐστὶ and the others ὡς ἅπαντ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐστὶ τόλμης μεστὰ.
This is rather an attractive alteration, but perhaps ἔργα is more in keeping with the ideas of the Chorus of Women.704.
ἐξαράξει Bentley, Enger, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Velsen.
See the Com­ mentary.
The Editors, in the Classical Journal, of Bentley's notes, ascribe the same conjecture to Tyrwhitt, but it is not given in Elmsley's edition of Tyr­ whitt's notes to this play.
ἐξάρξω It. H. editions before Brunek.
Bentley's al­ ternative suggestion, ἐξαράξω, which is also the conjecture of Toup and Reiske, is followed by Brunek, and save as aforesaid subsequent editors.
Dawes suggested ἐξερῶ 'yMo, " Quali modo ves­ tram ego effraenatam insolentiam de­ clarabo!"
His wonted sagacity, as Brunck observes, had failed him here.710.
ἥκεις (without θ᾽ or y') Bekker, Dindorf, and others.
ἥκεις τ᾽ R. ἥκεις θ᾽ editions before Gelenius.
ἥκεις γ᾽ Suidas (s.v. ἥκεις), Gelenius, and all subsequent editors to Brunck, and several after­ wards.
Kuster translated it sed non redibis (salvus) eo, unde venisti, and ob­ served " verti ae si legeretur ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ἥξεις &c.," and this reading was adopted by Brunek and Bothe.

ὅθεν ἥκεις R. H. vulgo. ὅθεν οὐχ ἥξεις Fritzsehe. ὅθεν οὐκ ἔξει Cobet, and Bergk seems to have intended to adopt this, but he left the MS.
reading in his text.
Reisig proposed to omit ἥκεις altogether, and to read ὅθεν οὐ φαύλως γ᾽ | ἀποδρὰς λέξεις, and this reading is adopted by Enger and sub­ sequent editors (except that some omit the y' after φαύλως.
φαύλως T' R. H. vulgo.711. οὔποτε.
I have added the -ποτε.
οὐ R. H. vulgo.715. τίς οὖν σοι R. H. vulgo.

Meineke ascribes the alteration to Brunek.
but this seems a mistake.
719.

ἐνυβρίσεις It. H. and all the earlier editions.
To com­ plete the metre I have inserted ἔμ᾽ which might easily have dropped out before the ἐν-, as indeed might ἔτ᾽, which Dobree proposed and Blaydes reads.720.
τε λέξεις R. H. vulgo. λέξεις τ' Fritzsche, which is followed by several editors, who do not see that we have here three iambic dimeters.
The two trochaic dimeters, just below, have been more carefully preserved, both in the strophe and in the anti­ strophe.721.
ἔργοις. Hermann added ἐπ' before and καὶ after ἔργοις.
And so (or with ἐπ' inserted before ἀθέοις) Enger, Meineke, Holden, and Yelsen.
I have preserved the text of the MSS.
which seems perfectly right.723.
τάχα κ.τ.λ.
These lines are written in the MSS.
and vulgo τάχα | ἐπέχει τις τύχη.
Editors write them in various ways.
The only alterations in the text are the transposition of σε and the omission of τις.
Both of these alterations have already been made by several editors, but accompanied by more radical, and less desirable, changes.

δέκα (without καὶ) R. H. editions before Portus.
Scaliger proposed δέκα γε, Fritzsche, accepting καὶ, suggests the insertion of γε after μῆνας, and Blaydes inserts it accordingly.
746.

So? μοι TO σφύγιον R. (originally) Bentley, Bekker.
δός μοι τὸ σφαγεῖον H. and (as corrected) R. all editions before Bekker.
Tyrwhitt is said to have suggested the omission of τὸ, and Person did the same, and this suggestion is followed by all editions after Bekker excepting Blaydes, who omits the μοι instead.
Fritzsche reads δός μοι σφάγιον, ὦ.It seems to me that both μοι and τὸ are necessary, and as it seems clear that the bowl for catching the victim's blood was called either σφαγεῖον or σφάγιον, I have followed Bentley, Bekker, and Fritzsche in adopting the latter form.
See the Commentary.768. φαίνετ' οὔπω R. H. vulgo. " For­ san φαίνεταί πω " Dobree.
And so Meineke, recentiores.—τίν οὖν ἂν Porson, Thiersch, Dindorf, recentiores, save that Bothe, who in his first edition accepted Porson's reading, in his second goes over to Brunck's.

πόθεν ;
the final πόθεν was added by Scaliger (in his notes) and Bentley ;
and is read by Thiersch, Weise, Holden, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.
In R. H. and all editions before Brunck, and Bekker afterwards, the line is a foot short.
There have been other suggestions for completing the line.
Bisetus proposed πόθεν πλάται ;
(which Fritzsche accepts) or πόθεν ξύλον ;
Bothe reads πόθεν ποτε ;
Brunck substitutes ἀθλίῳ for μοι, and is followed by Dindorf and Bergk.
Din­ dorf proposed, however, to change πλάται into πλάτας λαβεϊν, retaining γένοιτ', and this is followed by Meineke and Blaydes ;
whilst Enger reads πόθεν ἂν γένοιντ' ἄν οὖν ἐμοί ;
773. εἰ ταδὶ Suidas (s.v. Παλαμήδης), Scaliger (in notes), Kuster, recentiores.
εἰ τάδε Zanetti, Farreus, Rapheleng. εἶτα. διὰ R. H. and the other editions before Kuster.776.
ὦ χεīρες ἐμαἰ.
Before these words H. has Εὐριπ.
And it may be that they are an actual quotation from Euripides, whether from his Palamede or from some other play :
and if so, it may be possible in this way to explain the hiatus ἐμαὶ ἐγχειρεῖν.
Porson, however, in his copy of Portus, marked a lacuna after ἐμαὶ, thinking that an anapaestic dipody has dropped out;
which Her­ mann would supply by reading μὴ ἀλλ' ἐγχειρεῖν I ὑμᾶς ἔργῳ πορίμῳ χρή
This is adopted by Meineke except that he changes μὴ ἀλλ' into νῦν δὴ.
Fritzsche avoids the hiatus by reading χρῆν ἐγχει­ ρεῖν, and Velsen by reading χρή μ' ἐγ­ χειρεῖν, but all other editors leave it untouched.
The hiatus in the next line χρὴ ἔργῳ (R. H. vulgo) admits of no defence ;
Bentley changed χρὴ) into χρῆν, and so Brunck, Bothe, Thiersch, Din­ dorf, and recent editors generally.
782.

In his note on Porson's Plutus 586 Dobree sug­ gested ὑμεῖς for ἡμᾶς.
This was such an obvious mistake that he did not repeat it in his notes on this play, but it is brought into the text by Meineke and Holden.790.

But in the MSS.

To turn the concluding tribrach into a dactyl, Fritzsche reads χοὔτως for οὕτως;
and Person proposed to transpose the words.
In his Aristophanica his trans­ position appears as παρακύψαν TO κακὸν ἰδεῖν.
But this would violate the rule on which lie always insisted ;
and doubt­ less, as Enger says, he intended to write, what Dindorf afterwards wrote, TO κακὸν παρακύψαν ἰδεῖν.
In this form the trans­ position is accepted by Enger, Bergk, recentiores.804.

But Elmsley, at Ach. 109, pointed out that Aristo­ phanes uses μὴν only after ὰλλἀ, γε, ἦ, καὶ, οὐ, or οὐδέ.
Bentley proposed to amend the metre by changing ἥττων into χείρων, but ἥττων contains an allu­ sion to the defeat, ἧττα, of Charminus.— ἐστὶν.
The final v, which is omitted in R. H. and the earlier editions, was first added by Kuster.— δῆλα δὲ τἄργα Portus, recentiores.

And Kuster's suggestion is adopted by Brunck, and subsequent editors before Blaydes.853.
Ἑλένην all printed editions.

In Euri­ pides it is written ψεκάδος, and that form is adopted by Brunck, Invernizzi, and Weise.860.

σύ τ᾽ H. and (as corrected) R. Junta, Grynaeus.867.
Μενέλαος R. H. vulgo.
Μενέλεως Brunck to Blaydes inclusive.
But, as Velsen observes, the forms Μενέλαος and Μενέλεως are used indiscriminately by Euripides in the Helen (1196 and 1215, 1003 and 1031) ;
and there is not the slightest reason for altering the MS.
reading here.868.
τῶν κοράκων πονηρίᾳ.
These words are continued to Mnesilochus by R. H. and all editions (except Bothe) before Fritzsche.
Bentley suggested that they should be transferred to the Woman, and this must have been the reading of the Scholiast, who says, ὅτι πονηροὶ οἱ K¡}paKf,>, K(ii urt fLÉXPL ¡'UV OUK f'umίpag¡lv UE.
And so Bothe, Fritzsche, recentiores.
But this would be making Critylla enter into the jest, which she is noway inclined to do.874.
ποίου Πρωτέως ;
the MSS.
indi­ cate that these words belong to a new speaker, but do not say to-whom.
All the editions, except as hereinafter men­ tioned, give them to Euripides, and I think rightly.
However, Bentley, Tyrwhitt, Elmsley, and Dobree, four of the greatest names in Aristophanic literature, all proposed to transfer them to the Woman.
And at first sight this is a very attractive suggestion ;
giving ποίου the meaning of scornful repudiation which it so often bears in Aristophanes Proteus indeed!
Neverthe­ less it cannot, I think, be right.
Cri­ tylla, as the next line shows, supposes Mnesilochus to be referring to Πρωτέως;
(genitive Πρωτέου), and she would be giving herself away, if she began by repeating Πρωτέως, which could only be the genitive of Πρωτεύς.
" Neque enim," says Enger, "hoc dicere potest 'quem Proteum tu narras ?
imo Proteam, sed hie jamdudum est mortuus.'"
Accord­ ingly the alteration is rejected by all editors except Bothe, Fritzsche, Blaydes, and Yelsen.
ποίου is a simple interroga­ tive, as it is three lines below.878.

Meineke rewrites the verse κακὴ κακῶς τἄρ᾽ ἐξόλοιο, κἀξολεῖ, and this, with the astonishing κακὴ, is accepted by Holden, and, with κακὴ changed into κακὸς, by Velsen.889.

This line stands in the text as in R. H., except that for Μενελάῳ σ᾽ they have Μενέλαον, and for ἰφύων, ἀφύων.
Μενελάῳ σ has been restored from Eur. Hel. 565, and ἰφύων from Suidas, s.v. ἰφύη.
The MS.
reading is retained by all editions before Kuster, who, leaving the first three words as they stood, con­ tinued (from the Helen) γέ σ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ἔχω) τί φῶ, but seems from his note to have intended the further change of Μενέλαον into Μενελάῳ.
And, with this further change, he is followed by Bergler and Blaydes.
Meanwhile Pierson (on Moeris, s.v. Ἀγυιᾶ) pointed out that Suidas (s.v. ἰφύη) had retained the true reading ἰφύων, and Brunck accordingly settled the line as in the present text.
He is followed by all subsequent editors except Blaydes :
and except that Thiersch, Din­ dorf, and Enger (contrary to all the MSS. both of Euripides and Aristophanes) change Μενελάῳ into Μενελέῳ, and that Bergk, Meineke, and Holden follow Person in reading σέ γ’ for a' ὅσα y'.
Before the reading ἰφύων had become known, Bourdin suggested ὀφρύων for ἀφύων.911.

In his note on Horace A. P. 441 (see the Com­ mentary on line 53) Bentley proposed τόρνευε, but in his Aristophanic jottings he left the MS.

but in his notes Dindorf reverts to δαιμόνων.
A friend of Fritzsche suggested δαιμόνι which Fritzsche (while citing δαιμόνι' ἂχη from Aesch.

The conjectures δαιμονῶν, αἰόλᾳ, and πορείᾳ are by Inver­ nizzi carelessly attributed to R.1056.
ΗΧΩ.
See the Commentary.
R. originally prefixed no name to any of the speeches of Echo, giving merely a line (as its manner was) to denote a new speaker :
but the second corrector inserted Εὺριπ.
ἠχὡ here and ήχὼ alone in 1069 and 1082.
H. has Εὐριπ.
ἠχὼ here and in 1069, and ήχὼ alone in 1082 and 1085, elsewhere prefixing a line only.
The Editio Princeps gave Εύ. here, and ἠχὼ to all the other speeches, and so all the other editions before Brunck, excepting that Portus prefixed Εύριπίδης ὼς ήχὼ to the present line.
Brunck, whilst retaining the same prefix as Portus here, made the deplorable mistake of changing ἠχὼ into Εὺρ.

and this error is followed by all subsequent editors.1058.
ἢτις (R. H. vulgo) is omitted by Junta, Zanetti, and Farreus.1062.
τὸ σαυτη̑ς.
All editions before Fritzsche read τοσαυ̑τα, on which Bentley conjectured τὸ σαυτου̑ in accordance with τέκνον.
But it having been ascertained that R. H. have τοσαύτης, it was seen that the true reading was TO σαυτη̑ς in accordance with 'Ανδρομέδα, and so Dindorf suggested, and Fritzsche and all subsequent editors read, except Bothe who retains τοσαυ̑τα.1063.

The MSS.
and editors before Brunck have κλαύσαιμι, which Brunck altered into κλαύσει, and he is followed by all subsequent editors.
But the Scythian is not at all likely to have spoken such good Greek as κλαύσει, nor is κλαύσει likely to have been corrupted into κλαύσαιμι.
I imagine that the Scythian said κλαίσαι (for κλύσει) to which some copyist would naturally add the orthodox -μι.
Bentley conjectured κλαύσεμι.1092.

To the Scythian's exclamations ποȋποȋ πεύγεις ;
and οὺ καιρήσεις there is no correspond­ ing echo in the MSS.
or any of the editions before Brunck.
Brunck added it in each case, and is followed generally by subsequent editors.
I have, with Fritzsche, inserted it only after οὐ καιρή­ σεις, since the Scythian's ἔτι γὰρ γρύζεις, whilst it implies an echo immediately preceding, seems also to imply a pre­ vious silence.
1102, 1103.
These two lines are omitted in R. and H., doubtless because line 1101 and line 1103 end with the same word Γοργόνος.
They are inserted by the second corrector of R., recog­ nized by the Scholiast, and found in every printed edition.1102.
or, Thiersch, Blaydes. τί R. H. vulgo.
I have followed Thiersch because we have had the very word σί for τί before, but I do not think it necessary to make the Scythian's jargon consistent, and I have therefore retained some words which recent editors have altered to preserve the analogy.
—Γόργος Fritzsche, Enger, Bergk, Meineke, Hol­ den, Velsen, Hall and Geldart.
Γοργόνος the corrector of R. and vulgo ;
Brunck and the subsequent editors who retain Γοργόνος, omitting the preceding τὴ and so making the line metrical.
Thiersch also omitted the preceding τὴ and wrote Γόργο τῇ.
Dindorf proposed Γοργῶ, which Weise reads, and Blaydes reads Γόργου.
Though accepting Fritzsche's reading, I should myself have been inclined to read Γοργοῦς, as in Eur.
Orestes 1520, 1521 ;
Phoen. 456 (Porson's reading).
In the edition of Portus the iota in πέρι is, apparently by a defect in the type, written ;
and subsequent editors, restor­ ing the iota, also retained the ;
as a note of interrogation :
but Fritzsche who was the first to understand the line rightly, and to see that πέρι stands for φέρεις, struck out the note of interroga­ tion here, and placed it after λέγι as in the text.
1103.
κεπαλή Bothe, Fritzsche, recen­ tiores.
κεφαλὴ or κεφαλῇ the corrector of R. and all other editions before Bothe.
The last two words of the line τὴν Γορ­ γόνος are continued to the Scythian by the corrector of R. and all editors be­ fore Thiersch ;
Thiersch transferred them to Euripides, an arrangement uni­ versally approved.
And it may he ob­ served that R. has a colon, and Junta a full stop after κεφαλή.
Euripides means that he said Γοργόνος not Γόργος.1108.

Between the words καλεῖται and φάηνθ᾽ R. had στυγνᾶς ὥσσε (struck out by the second corrector), and H. στυγνὰς ὡς ἐ.
Apparently, as Fritzsche and finger observe, the copyist had com­ menced to write line 1144 (στυγοῦσ᾽ ὥσπερ εἰκός) before line 1143, but when he had reached the second syllable of ὥσπερ, he found out his mistake, and reverted to line 1143 (φάυηθ᾽ ὦ τυράννους).
Unfortunately he omitted to cancel the miswritten words which, making no sense, became still further corrupted.
They are not recognized in any printed edition, excepting in that of Thiersch, who writes the lines as follows, Στυγός θ᾽ (she is called not only κλῃδοῦχος but Στυγὸς) ὡς ἐκ|φανέντας τοὺς τυράννους | στυγοῦσ᾽ ὥσπερ εἰκός.1150.

And so Bothe, who however places it after εἰσορᾶν, and changes οὐ into οὐχὶ.1155.
ἀντόμεθ᾽ R. H. vulgo.
Gelenius, by mistake, wrote αἰτόμεθ᾽, which con­ tinued till Kuster, who (with Bergler) wrote αἰτούμεθ᾽.
This and the follow­ ing line are transposed by Hermann, Fritzsche, Meineke, and Holden.1157.
εἰ καὶ R. H. vulgo.
Here again Gelenius erroneously wrote εἰ γὰρ, which kept its place until Invernizzi, from R., restored the true reading.
Meineke and Holden omit εἰ.1158.
ἤλθετον ... χἠμῖν.
These words are written according to the arrange­ ment first adopted by Fritzsche, from the emendations of Hermann and Reisig, and followed by Enger and Hall and Geldart.
ἤλθετον ἔλθετε vvv ἀφίκεσθ᾽ Reisig, Fritzsche, Enger, Hall and Gel­ dart. ἤλθετον νῦν ἀφίκεσθον R. H. vulgo.
ἤλθετε νῦν ἀφίκεσθον Hermann. ἤλθετε νῦν ἀφίκεσθ᾽ Thiersch, Holden, Blaydes, and Velsen.
Before ἱκετεύομεν Thiersch inserts ἱκετεῖς, Meineke ἰὼ, and Holden a second ἀφίκεσθ᾽.1159.

οὐδὲν μοῦ Bentley.

The μοῦ seems necessary, since Euripides intends, not to guarantee their immunity from all attacks, but merely to promise them immunity from his own.1167.

ἄνωθεν R. H. vulgo.
For ἄνω­ θεν, ὦ Velsen conjectures θὲς ἐκποδὼν.
Dr. Blaydes has seven suggestions :
1184.
ναὶ τυγάτριον R. H. vulgo.
ναικὶ τυγάτριον Bothe, Fritzsche, Hall and Geldart. ναὶ ὦ τυγάτριον Enger, Meineke, Holden. ναίκ' ὦ τυγάτριον Blaydes.
ναὶ σὺ τυγάτρίον Velsen.
But the Scythian may well have lengthened the second syllable of θυάτριον.1185.
στέριπο τὸ R. H. Brunck, recen­ tiores.
τέριπο TO editions before Ge­ lenius.
τέρι τὸ Gelenius until Kuster.
τέριπα τὰ Kuster, Bergler.—γογγύη H. Gelenius, recentiores, except Velsen.
γογγύλή R. editions before Gelenius.
γογγυλί Velsen, after a suggestion of Enger.
It is perhaps unnecessary to record all alterations in the Scythian's barbarisms.1186.
ἔτι.
Tyrwhitt suggested H TI.
I do not know how he meant to accent the η.1187.
κλαῦί γ' R. Bentley, Thiersch, Fritzsche, Enger, Meineke, recentiores κλαύσει γ'H. all editions before Brunck.
κλαύσετ' (with μένῃ) Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Bothe, Dindorf.
The next line was thought by Bentley to be a παρεπι­ γραφὴ, and is inserted, as a παρεπιγραφὴ, between the words πυή and κλαῦσί by Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, and Fritzsche, and is omitted altogether by Bothe, Dindorf, Enger, Bergk, Meineke, Blaydes, and Velsen.
It is therefore not numbered, even by those who retain it.
1 am much inclined to agree with Bentley's suggestion and Brunck's ar­ rangement.
For ἀνακύπτι R. H. have ἀνακύπτη, and all the editions before Thiersch have ἀνακύπτει.
On the other hand R. H. read παρακύπτι, but here again all the editions before Thiersch have παρακύπτει.1190.
οὐκὶπιλῆσι Person, Dindorf (in notes), Weise, Enger, Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Hall and Geldart.

οὐκὶ πιλήσει Brunck and, except as herein mentioned, recentiores.

Dr. Blaydes not merely reads Ἀρτομουξία here, but alters the MS.
reading in the four other places in which the name occurs, to make it conform with this.

διέβαλλέ μ' ὁγραῦς R. H. vulgo.
But for o Zanetti, Farreus, and Raphe­ leng have ὦ, and I have written ὀ. Suidas (s.v. διέβαλεν, which he explains by ἐξηπάησεν) reads διέβαλέ μ' ἡ γραῦς.
Brunck reads διέβαλέ μ' ὦ, γραῦς, and this reading is adopted by Invernizzi, Bekker, Bothe, Dindorf, and subsequent editors down to and including Holden, most of them however having ὡ or ὠ for ὦ.
Suidas seems to have turned the Scythian's dialect into Attic Greek ;
διέβαλλε may well stand for the aorist in Scythianese.
διέβαλό μ' ὦ γρα Blaydes, Velsen.
διέβαλλέ μ'ἠ γραυς Hall and Geldart.
The MSS.
and edi­ tions before Brunck had τάχιστα, for which Brunck first wrote τάκιστα.1215.
ὀρῶς 8f R. H. vulgo.
But several critics, considering the first syllable of συβήνη to be short, insert another short syllable after δὲ.
ὀρτῶς δὲ τὸ Person.
ὀρτῶς δέ τι Hermann, Enger, Meineke, Velsen.
ὀρτῶς δὲ σὺ Bothe, Fritzsche, Blaydes.
But συβήνη is a form of the Scythian's own coinage, and it is impossible to tell whether he meant the first syllable to be long or short.
In 1197 both MSS.
spell it συμ­ βήνη,which may possibly be the right reading in both places.—συβήνη 'στί καταβηνῆσι R. H. vulgo.
συβίνη 'στί καταβηνῆσι Brunck, and most recent editors.
σιβύνη 'στὶ, καταβηνῆσι Enger, Meineke.
συβίνη 'σσί καταβηνῆσι Bothe. συβίνη' καταβηνῆσι Blaydes.
See at 1197 supra.1216.
δρᾶσι Blaydes (in the Preface to his first edition of the Birds, pub­ lished in 1842), Enger, recentiores, ex­ cept Bergk.
And Bergk, although in his text he retained δράσει (the reading of R. H. and of all editions before Enger), yet suggested the arrangement of this line, with δρᾶσι, which is adopted by Meineke, Holder and Hall and Gel­ dart, and in this edition.
For in the MSS. (and vulgo) the lines run οἴμοι, τί δράσει ;
ποῖτὸ γρᾴδιο ;
| Ἀρταμουξία.
But it is clear that οἴμοι should stand by itself and Ἀρταμουξία be brought up into the preceding line, so making a perfect senarius.
In the MS. arrange.
­ ment the senarius is a foot short, and various suggestions were made for sup­ plying the missing foot.
ποῖδὲ, ποῖ τὸ γρᾴδιο ;
Hermann.
ποῖτὸγρᾴδιο ;
γρᾴδιο Bothe. ποῖ τὸ γρᾴδι' οἴκεται ;
Blaydes (in 1842).
ποῖτὸ γρᾷο ;
γρᾴδιο Fritzsche, Enger.1224. διώξεις R. H. vulgo.
R. H. and Junta indeed write τῆ 8' ἴδ' ὤξεις, but it is obvious that all three meant τῃδὶ διώξεις, and so Zanetti and all sub­ sequent editors have taken it.
Elmsley (at Ach;
278) proposed διώξει, which is adopted by Thiersch, Dindorf, Meineke, and subsequent editors, but rejected by Fritzsche, Enger, and Bergk.
And as, both here and in Knights 969 and Clouds 1296, the MSS.
have the active form, and the active and middle forms are admittedly employed by Attic writers, there seems no sufficient reason for departing from the authority of the MSS.
here.
Cobet annexes the s taken from διώξεις to the succeeding sentence, διώξει ;
'ς τοὔμπαλιν, and this too is fol­ lowed by Meineke, Holden, and Hall and Geldart.1225.
ἀλλὰ τρέξι R. H. vulgo.
ἄλλα (aliâ viâ) τρέξι Portus and subsequent editions before Brunck ;
and Fritzsche, Enger, Bergk, Meineke, Holden, and Blaydes afterwards.
1226. τρέχενυν.
The second τρέχε νυν was added by Brunck, the MSS.
having the line a foot short.
Enger com­ mences the line with ἀλλὰ.
Kuster suggested the insertion of ταχέως, which Blaydes inserts.
Meineke added τρέχε at the end of the line.
Brunck's con­ jecture seems incomparably superior, and is adopted by Invernizzi, Bekker, Bothe, Thiersch, Dindorf, Fritzsche, and Bergk.
Meineke's is adopted by Holden, Velsen, and Hall and Geldart.1228.
ὥρα δη̑τ’ ἐστὶ Bothe, Thiersch, Dindorf, Fritzsche, Weise.
See the Commentary.
ὥρα δή 'an R. H. vulgo.
But in the MSS.
and all the editions before Brunck, and in Meineke after­ wards, this was a metrical necessity, since they united lines 1227 and 1228 into one anapaestic tetrameter."
Mr. Rogers is doing a great service to culture and civilization.
He needs no praises, for it is obvious that his work is his delight.
Of his edition the words may be not inappropriately used ‘ Cras amet qui nunquam amavit, quique amavit eras amet.’...
It is with a thrill of pleasure that we read such lines as Knights 756, 757, and 824-7, or the cretics of the old Acharnians in pursuit of the peacemaker.
Nor could anything be more like Aristophanes than the mock oracles, which are really some of the best hexameters ever achieved....
The reader ends, if he is a Grecian, by admiring Mr. Rogers much, but Aristophanes still more ;
if he knows no Greek, he ends with the desire to learn enough himself to appreciate Aristophanes as Mr. Rogers appreciates him.”— Morning Post."
These two volumes [the Acharnians and the Knights] are indeed illuminating at all points.
The scholar will find troublesome questions of textual, historical, and critical import adequately met and answered by one who is more than commonly qualified for the task.
The student could hardly have a safer guide;
the reader for pleasure will enjoy Mr. Rogers's polished and incisive wit, and the musical, and at times even haunting, quality of his verse.”—Guardian.
"The publication of Mr. Rogers's translation of Aristophanes is an event of the first importance in English classical scholarship.
It is indeed not only a great translation, but a great edition of the Greek text also.”—Liverpool Courier.
The qualities which distinguished his previous renderings, ease and lightness of touch, absence of superfluous verbiage, deftness and ingenuity, reappear in the Acharnians.
The translation is surprisingly faithful, and yet is so spirited that it can be read with pleasure apart from the text.
Nothing drags or trails in it....
In his edition the translation is the principal thing, and the Commentary is designed to supplement it with such information about the manners of the time, the special allusions of the Play, and the business of the stage as the ordinary cultivated reader desires.
He works, in short, with an eye to the immediate literary enjoyment of the piece ;
his notes are models of good English and good sense, and display a keen interest in the life of Ancient Athens fortified and expanded by an interest in human life at large....
Our admiration of this series of version is great, and we offer to Mr. Rogers our best wishes for the successful completion of the whole."- The Times.“
For scholars of all degrees of scholarship there is a real treat in this volume.
It is heartily welcome.”—Pall Mall Gazette."
As good as it can be.
The notes are as full of scholarship as the version is of ingenuity and felicity.
"-Spectator."
To younger men, who range more wide than deep, and conceive that the Germans are the only thorough guides to scholarship, Mr. Rogers should be something of a revelation.
He is master of the graces of his own language no less than of Greek.
The excellence of his translations is well known.
The main points which stand out, in this edition as in the others of the series, are the abiding sanity of the editor, his judicial fairness in estimating varieties of reading and rendering, and his intimate sense—we might almost call it the intuitive sense-of the humour and the subtlety of Aristophanes....
We can re-echo the epithet which Christians and pagans alike have bestowed on the poet—ὁ χαρίεις.
It is this charm, this ease and grace, which Mr. Rogers repro­ duces for us so well in an age of slovenly English and unlovely worldlings.”— Athenaeum."Mr. Rogers's verse translation is of course the standard version.
His mastery of tetrameters of all kinds is unrivalled.
His introduction and notes present the same combination of erudition, literary taste, and common sense that has endeared his previous commentaries to all lovers of Aristophanes.
We congratulate him most warmly on the successful completion of an edition which is equally beloved by the scholar and the layman.
He has translated Aristophanes once and for all, and he may lay down his pen with the comfortable assurance that his work will not be superseded.”—Cambridge Review."
The sparkling versions of the great comic dramatist made by Mr. Rogers are praised both by scholars and by readers who, with small Latin and less Greek, want to know something of the culture of the ancient world.
It may be doubted if he has ever been more happy than in the rendering of the Acharnians.
The Commentary is full of interest and learning, and especially likely to please readers who do not care to let the lexicographer and gram­ marian have all the talk when the business is the elucidation of a comic poet.”—Scotsman."
It is difficult to find new terms of praise for Mr. Rogers's translations.
In the lyrics he is inimitable ;
they go with a snap and a swing that make it difficult to realize that they are translations.”—Manchester Guardian."Mr. Rogers's name is known far and wide among classical scholars in connexion with his work on the plays of Aristophanes, and nobody has done more than he to popularize the Athenian comedian's best work among modern readers.
A real service is performed to classical literature by the issue of the present series, and it is undoubted that this publication will do much to extend the area of the dramatist's public.
The verse translation runs with a consistently light and tripping measure, the Greek text is well censored, and the notes and introduction are excellent.
”—Manchester Courier.
“The translation is excellent.
How racy it is our readers will have seen by our extracts;
and not only is it far livelier than the well-known version of Hookham Frere, but it also keeps considerably closer to the original.
Lovers of classical literature have long delighted in Mr. Rogers's scholarship and skill, and will welcome the appearance of the present volume.”—Westminster Gazette."
One of Mr. Rogers's always welcome volumes.
Fully on the level of the previous Plays.”—Glasgow Herald."
Another volume of Mr. Rogers's masterly edition of the great comic poet will be another delight to scholars and to general readers.
The verse rendering on the pages opposite to the Greek text is worthy of the original.
It is surprisingly resourceful, spirited, and exact ;
and it reads as an independent English poem.
It is a triumph of the translator's art.
The whole work is most capable and thorough-a signal credit to English scholarship.”— Educational Times.
"After many years' study of Aristophanes, Mr. Rogers has reached a position as his expositor which is recognized as supreme by the world of scholarship and letters....
Thanks to him the English reader is able to appreciate the brilliance of Aristophanes in dialogue, and that sense of fun and point which makes him still abundantly amusing.”—Athenaeum."
Not only a translator who succeeds wonderfully in welding the English language into the varied accents and rhythm of Greek poetry.
To a fine sense of the music and swing of the original he adds that minute knowledge of the language, of the texts, and of the special history of the period which has enabled him to produce an edition of The Knights ' that will appeal first to the Grecian scholar, but also to unlearned folk.
The translation is full of the humour and pith of the original;
and the notes, whether linguistic or explanatory, are such as to make the volume complete in itself.
The book is alive with that sort of scholarship which makes the past live again.
”—Scotsman.
"We are very glad to see another volume of Mr. Rogers's admirable translations.
The dialogue is full of topical allusions which almost defy translation, but Mr. Rogers has overcome all difficulties with his accustomed skill.”—Spectator."Mr. Rogers's work on Aristophanes is well known.
His translation has received, and deserves, high commendation.
The introduction to the present volume is a model of its kind.
The English reader who follows the guidance of Mr. Rogers is well equipped for appreciating somewhat of the comic spirit of the great and daring Athenian.”—Evening Standard and St. James's Gazette.“
Mr. Rogers shows once more that command of metre which makes these translations so agreeable to read, while the fidelity with which he has adhered to the Greek is nearly perfect.
With the usual excellent explanatory and critical notes, this volume is as good as Mr. Rogers's ‘ Plutus,' and no higher praise is needed.”—Pall Mall Gazette."
Few classical books find a warmer welcome than The Knights of Aristophanes by B. B. Rogers.'
His translation shows the qualities we have learned to look for in him—vigour, wit, and spontaneous felicity.
The notes are breezy without being flippant, learned without being pedantic.”—Manchester Guardian."Mr. Rogers is as happy as usual in his rendering of the original;
the coarse jests of the rival ‘ mud-slingers,' Clean and the Sausage-seller, are rendered palatable by ingenious tours de force;
the fragments of exquisite lyric in which Aristophanes soars high above the mire of conventional ribaldry are charmingly rendered, and the verve and swing of the Parabasis find their equivalent in Mr. Rogers's masculine trochaics.”—Nation.
"One can only repeat one's expression of admiration for his literary deftness and sober scholarship.
The spirit of the original is reproduced in his brilliant rendering with remarkable adherence to the language of the text, and yet his version reads like an independent English drama.
The notes are very instructive, and the textual criticism in the appendix is full and judicious."- Educational Times.
"Another volume of Mr. B. B. Rogers's translation of Aristophanes is a great event and a great pleasure.
To admirable scholarship he adds a skill in comic verse like Mr. Gilbert's, and a power which that writer's subjects have never called for.
To read The Knights’ in Mr. Rogers's version is to read a brilliant English play, though there are no such plays in English outside these translations.
The notes at the foot of the page are not only helpful and packed with learning of many kinds, but they are a delight to read even apart from the text, for their curious lights upon literature, history, and social life in Greece, down to cookery and children's games.”
—Daily Chronicle.
