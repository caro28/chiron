FOR " the ἀλεκτροΦωνία, or third watch of the night, having passed," it would have been more correct to have said the ἀλεκτοροΦωνία, or signal of the presence of the fourth watch of the night, having passed."
See Grotius and Bochart (apud Pole's Synopsis Criticorum) on St. Matthew xxvi. 34. In the second line of the text if we do not, with Ernesti and Reisig, put a colon after ὅσον, it is much better to suppose ὅσονto be used for ὡς, than to adopt Hermann's ex­ planation τόσον, ὅσονἀπέραντον.For " Cæsyra” here and in the note, read " Cœsyra.
”This note proceeds on the supposition that του̑ πάππουmeans " the grandfather of Phidippides,” Phidon and Phidonides being considered different forms of one and the same name.
See Dindorf at v. 134.
Yet του̑ πάππου may with equal probability signify “ the grandfather of Strepsiades,” in which case Phidon would be the son of Phidonides, as in Thucydides i. 61, Callias is the son of Calliades.
For “ Persia" towards the close of the note should be read more strictly " Media."ὡς.]
Elmsley's interpretation of this word (given by Mitchell) is not altogether satisfactory, nor are the instances there quoted in all respects similar.
A closer parallel would have been Sophocles, Ajax 39, where again I cannot agree with Wünder's interpretation.
In both passages ὡς seems to signify be assured that, “believe that, ἴσθι or some such word being perhaps understood.
In Acharnians 335 it signifies being assured that," " in the belief that."
tHermann gives a remarkably ingenious theory on the composition of this line.
He thinks it has arisen from a collection of glosses on the two preceding lines.
Ad φέρε ascripserat aliquis, ὡςοὐ καθορών.
soil. φησὶ ταυ̑τα.
Ad αὖταιπλάγιαι, — Trapa τὴνἐίσοδον.
Ad τίΤΟ χρη̑μα,—ἢδη ὡς μόλις ὁρω̑ν vel ἀθρω̑ν.
Such an interpolation might easily be conceived.
For instance, the scholium on 1131 might well be foisted into the text,See also the prologues to " the Fox," and the " Every Man in his Humour," of Ben Jonson, where he says he scorns to employ the usual claptrap jests, but adopts " deeds and LANGUAGE [ἔπη] such as Men do use, and persons such as Comedy would choose, ℱc,” and compare this with the analogy between the Pro­ logue of the English, and the Parabasis of the Greek drama, mentioned in the note on v. 500.κακ
ουργου̑ντ οἶδ’ ὅτι.]
There is certainly a difficulty about these words, which has not been sufficiently cleared up.
Bentley proposes to substitute for οἶδ’ ὃτι the words εὖποιεȋν or εὐνοεȋν, but this is manifestly too great a departure from the reading of the MSS.
Another emendation which I think I have somewhere seen, αὖπαθεȋν, is liable to the same objection.
Whether any alteration is necessary, and whether, if so, κακουργεȋν οὐδένα is admissible, I leave to the judgment of others.
