A mother killed [her] son, who had left the battle after the death of his companions;

His mother, kindling with disdain That she had borne him, struck him dead;
For courage, and not birth alone, At Sparta testifies a son.

After painting Deucalion and Phaethon, you ask, Me­ nestratus, what each is worth.

1The Nymphs washed Bacchus, just rolling over the ashes,2 when the child had leapt from the fire.
Hence, Bromius [Bacchus] is a friend together with the Nymphs;

4Great Bacchus, born in thunder and in fire, By native heat asserts his dreadful sire.
Nourished near shady hills and cooling streams, He to the Nymphs avows his amorous flames.
To all the brethren at the Bell and Vine, The moral says, " Mix water with your wine.

When infant Bacchus from encircling flame Leap'd into life, the Nymphs in pity came;

The life of voice-dividing [men], is the sport of For­ tune, pitiable, wandering, tossed between wealth and poverty.

Gray hairs, if you are silent, are understanding ;

I, this helmet, have obtained a double charm, I am both a pleasure for my friends to look upon, and a fear to my enemies.
And Piso born of Pylæmenes possesses me.
The helmet neither became other hair, nor did other hair become the helmet.
If you look at me, I also [look at] you.
Why do you look at me with eyes ? 1 But I do not see you with eyes,.
for I have none.
And if you wish, I speak to you with­ out a voice;
for the voice is yours, but I have lips that open in vain.
As we gaze on each other, your eyes look at me ;
But eyes I have none;
though I look, I don't see.
I'll converse, if you please;
you'll hear nothing, 'tis true ;
For I open my lips, but have no voice like you, H.

Therefore I beg of you, write more;

ONE person was maimed in his feet, and another in his eyes;

Thrasybulus came to Pitané breathless on his shield, after receiving from the Argives seven wounds, showing them all in front.
Him [weltering] in his blood the aged Tynnichus placed upon the funeral pile, and spoke thus :
" Let cowards be wept for;
but I will bury thee, my son, without a tear, thee, who wast both mine and a Lacedæmonian.
”When Thrasybulus from the embattled field Was breathless borne to Sparta on his shield, His honoured corse, disfigured still with gore From seven wide wounds, (but all received before,) Upon the pyre his hoary father laid, And to the admiring crowd triumphant said­ " Let slaves lament;
while I without a tear Lay mine and Sparta's son upon his bier.

A Laconian woman, on seeing her own son returning without his shield from war, and putting out a rapid foot towards his native soil, rushed to meet him, and thrust a spear through his liver, bursting forth into a manly exclamation over him when killed—“ Offspring, an alien to Sparta, go to Hades, go, since thou wast false both to thy country and to thy father.
"A Spartan woman, when she saw her son, Who without arms had from the battle run, And with quick foot his native soil had pressed, Meeting, a spear's point drove right through his breast, And o'er his corpse with manly voice she cried­ " Go, bastard son of Sparta, go, and hide In Hades' darkness thee and thy disgrace;

A Spartan had once fled from battle;
and meeting him, his mother said, raising a sword against his breast, " By living thou bindest thoroughly1 disgrace upon thy mother, and breakest the ancestral laws of mighty Sparta;
but if thou diest by my hands, I shall hear myself called an unhappy mother, but saved in my country.
"From the dire conflict as a Spartan fled, His mother cross'd his path and awful said, Pointing a sword against his dastard heart­ " If thou canst live, the mark of scorn and shame, Thou liv'st, the murderer of thy mother's fame, The base deserter from a soldier's part.
If by this hand thou diest, my name must be Of mothers most unblest;

Xerxes, seeing the great body of Leonidas, self-slain, was covering it with a purple cloak.

Thou oird, the carrier to and fro of the son of Saturn [Jupiter], why standest thou with a stern look upon the tomb of great Aristomenes ? I am announcing to men, that as I am the bravest of birds, so he is of heroes.

A scrip, and a cloak, and a barley-loaf kneaded with water, and a staff leant upon before his feet, and a cup [made] of clay, are sufficient means of life for the wise Cynic.
And even in these there is something superflu­ ous.
For on seeing a herdsman draw 1 a draught [of water] in the hollow of his hands, he said, " Why have I been vainly carrying thee, 0 shell-shaped clay, as a burden ? "Say by what means dost thou measure the world and the bounds of the earth, having a small body [composed] of a small portion of earth.
Measure thyself first, and know thyself, and then shalt thou measure the boundless earth.
But if thou measurest not the little clay of thy body, how canst thou know the measures of the measure­ less ?I would wish to be rich, as Crœsus once was rich, and to be king of the great Asia.
But when I look upon Nica- nor the coffin-maker, and know for what he makes those cases, I, scattering cates,1 and moistening [myself] with cups, sell Asia for ointments and cups.
Wealth, such as Crœsus erst could own, I'd ask, or Asia's mighty throne.
But at Nicanor's shop hard by, When I the undertaker spy, Making those cupboards, you know why, All Asia's grandeurs I resign For garlands, odours, cates, and wine.

Hermocrates, the money-lover, when dying, in his will, wrote himself the heir of his possessions.
And he lay, reckoning how much he should give as a reward to the physicians, on rising [from his sick bed], and what he ex­ pends when sick.

I was a reed, a useless plant;

But a man initiated me in the mysteries of Helicon, boring [in me] thin lips, and making me the channel for a narrow stream.

2An useless plant I was of yore, Nor fig, nor grape, nor apple bore;
But a man did to me impart Of Helicon the secret art.
Through him my lips were slender made, And narrow channel so displayed, That when some drops of blackened ink, Like one with Bacchus full, I drink, With mouth, that has no voice, I still Can talk whatever words you will.

Mayest thou neither be lifted up by the noisy [wing] 6 of much-possessing Fortune, nor may care wear down thy freedom.

Envy, according to Pindar, is better than pity.
The envied enjoy a brilliant life;

Pity, says the Theban bard, From my wishes I discard;
Envy, let me rather be, Rather far, a theme for thee.
Pity to distress is shown;
Envy to the great alone.

I prefer the golden mean, Pomp and penury between.
For alarm and peril wait Ever on the loftiest state;
And the lowest to the end Obloquy and scorn attend.

"Some one told me of your fate, 0 Heraclitus, and it brought a tear to me;
and I remembered how often we both 1made the sun to set in talking.
1 But you are some where, 0 stranger of Halicarnassus, ashes four ancient­ ly;
2 but your songs live;
upon which Hades, the snatcher of every thing, shall not throw his hand.
They told me, Heraclitus, thou wert dead;
And then I thought, and tears thereon did shed, How oft we two talked down the sun;
but thou, Halicarnassian guest, art ashes now ! Yet live thy nightingales of song.
On those Forgetfulness her hand shall ne'er impose.

I do not know whether I shall call you a shield, with whom as a faithful ally I armed myself against many ad­ versaries, or whether a small sea-boat for me, which con­ veyed me swimming from the sunk ship to the shore.
I have escaped in wars the wrath of Mars, and of Nereus in the sea, and you truly were my armour in both.
Whoever thou art, who bringest thy foot by my tomb, know that I am a son of Callimachus and a father.
You may know both.
One formerly commanded the arms of his country;

There is no Nemesis [for such a boast];

The stone-cutter Architeles raised, with miserable hands, a tomb to his deceased child Agathonor.
Alas ! alas ! for the stone, which iron did not cut, but was wasted away wet with frequent tears.
3 Alas ! 0 pillar, remain light on the dead, that he may say—“ The hand of my father really placed a stone upon me.
"The stone-hewer Architeles uprears, Fashioned by sorrowing hands, this monument To Agathonor, his departed son.
That stone, alas ! needed no chisel;

Lie light upon the dead, thou stone;

O country Sparta, we the three hundred after fighting about Thurea with the descendants of Inachus' of equal number, and not turning our necks there left our life in the place, where we first fitted our footsteps.
But if any one of the Greeks fled his fate, he was [descended] from Adrastus.

O native Sparta, when we met the host In equal combat from th' Inachian coast, Thy brave three hundred never turned aside;
But where our feet first rested, there we died.

Behold Hercules, of endless toil, your labours, which after enduring, you went to Olympus, the house of the immortals, [namely] Geryon, the famed apples, the great labour of Augeias, the horses, Hippolyte, the many-head­ ed serpent, the boar, the roaring dog of Chaos, the wild beast of Nemeia, the birds, the bull, the stag of Mcenalia.
The children of Neptune and Jupiter exercised their youth for the prizes of strong wrestling.
And their con­ test lies not about a brazen cauldron, but which shall carry off life or death.
The fall is of Antæus.
It be­ comes Hercules the son of Jupiter to conquer.
Wrest­ ling belongs to the Greeks, not the Libyans.
Two wrestlers here their youthful vigour prove.
The son of Neptune this, and that of Jove.
They for no vase of bronze contend ;
no prize Is set.
Whichever lives, the other dies.
Antæus falls.
'Tis Jove's son, Hercules, Must win.
The art's not Libyan, but of Greece.

Even now, an infant, stop the wrath of the jealous Juno.

For neither a bowl of beaten brass, nor cauldrons, but a road to the hall of Jupiter, is the prize.
O Chæronean Plutarch, the sons of the brave Auso­ nians placed this much-celebrated statue of you, because you fitted by parallel lives the best of the Greeks to the well-warring inhabitants of Rome.
But you could not write another life parallel to your own;
for you have not one like it.
Chæronean Plutarch, to thy deathless praise Does martial Rome this grateful statue raise.

But thou thyself could'st never write thy own;
Their lives have parallels ;

Diogenes the Cynic, having come to Hades, after he had finished a truly wise old age, saw Crœsus, and laughed.
And the old man, having spread his small cloak near to him, who had drawn out much gold from a river,1 said—“ To me there is now a greater place ;
for whatever I had, I bring all with me;
jut you, Crœsus, have nothing.
"If you love me, love me in deed, and do me no wrong, making our friendship the beginning of doing an injury;
for I assert that open malice is much better for all men than deceitful friendship;
and men say too that rocks under the sea are worse than conspicuous rocks for sea­ wandering ships.
Art thou my friend-forbear to do me guile, Nor clothe a secret grudge in friendship's smile :
For traitorous friendship wounds th' unguarded breast With surer aim than enmity professed ;
And more on shoals the sailor fears to wreck, Than where the rocks hang frowning o'er his deck.

0 CHILD of impudence, most uneducated offspring of folly, say, why do you swagger, knowing nothing? You are a Platonist among the grammarians.
But if one ex­ amines the dogmas of Plato, you are a grammarian again.
You fly from the one to the other;
and you neither know the art of grammar, nor are you a Platonist.
“I know all things," you say;

Having a smack of all things, you have nothing of your own.
I see a strange kind of reeds.
Surely they have shot up rather quickly from another [strange] brazen ground;
nor are they moved by our wind, but a gale rushing from a bull-hide cavern [bellows], travels below under the root of well-bored pipes.
And some powerful man, having quick fingers of hand, knows how to handle the harmo­ nizing lines of the pipes.
And they leaping squeeze out a soft tune.
Why, 0 shepherds, do you drag by a shameless cap­ ture from dewy boughs, me a Cicada, the lover of soli­ tude, the road-side songster of the Nymphs, chirping shrilly in mid-day heat on the mountains, and in the shady groves.
Behold the thrush and blackbird, be­ hold how many starlings are the plunderers of field- abundance.
It is right to take the destroyers of fruits.
Kill them.
What grudging is there of leaves and grassy dew ?Why, ruthless shepherds, from the dewy spray, In my lone haunt, Cicada tear away ? Me, the Nymphs’ way-side minstrel, whose sweet note O'er sultry hill is heard and shady grove to float ? Lo ! where the blackbird, thrush, and greedy host Of starlings fatten at the farmers cost.
With just revenge these ravagers pursue ;
But grudge me not a leaf, or grassy dew.

0 traveller, as you go by, do not blame my monument;
I have not, even when dead, any thing worthy of lament­ ations.
I have left children's children, and have en­ joyed one wife of the same old age with myself.
I have given marriages to three children, of whom many times I have borne the children in my lap;
nor have I lamented the disease or death of one of them;
who have poured libations on me unharmed, and have sent me to the country of the pious to sleep a sweet sleep.
Think not, whoe'er thou art, my fate severe ;
Nor o'er my marble stop to shed a tear ! One tender partner shared my happy state, And all that life imposes, but its weight.
Three lovely girls in nuptial ties I bound, And children's children smiled my board around, And, often pillow'd on their grandsire's breast, Their darling offspring sunk to sweetest rest.
Disease and death were strangers to my door, Nor from my arms one blooming infant tore.
All, all survived, my dying eyes to close, And hymn my spirit to a blest repose.

Melitinna heard unexpected news that her son had been overwhelmed by a wave bearing him;

But Dion came safe to land upon an unbroken ship from a trafficking voyage.
How unequal a fate did the mothers get by lot! the one has an unexpected living body, but the other will not see even the corpse [of her son].
I, Hermocrateia, after bringing forth twenty and nine [children], beheld the death neither of one son nor of one daughter;
for Apollo did not shoot at my sons, Diana did not take my daughters mourning heavily ;

See how I conquer justly with my children and tem­ perate tongue the daughter of Tantalus.
Letoius and Paulus both, being brothers, had a com­ mon union in life;

Archippus the ploughman, just leaving life from a heavy disease, and going to Hades, spoke these words to his sons—“ Oh! my dear children, be content with my spade and ploughman's life ;

As much as your mother was sweeter than your stepmother, so much is the land more desirable than the sea white [with foam].
Death robbed me of the autumn of youth ;

O traveller, do even you, seeing these letters, lament greatly;

I lost a little pig, and an ox, and one she-goat, on ac­ count of which you, Menecles, have received a small ice.
But neither has any thing happened in common to me and Othryades;

” 1Well, old Lysippus, Sicyonian modeller, hast thou done, in making an image of the Samian Æsop, and placing him in the front of the Seven Wise Men;
since they indeed introduced compulsion, and not persuasion, by their words.
But he, by saying seasonable things in wise speeches, and playing in earnest, persuades [people] to be sensible.
Now sharp counsel is a thing to be avoided;
but the sweetness of the Samian fable has a pleasant bait.
Well done, old Sicyonian, sculptor famous.
Well hath Lysippus grouped Æsop of Samos, Before the Sages Seven, whose sayings stern Oblige, while his persuade, wisdom to learn.

Cleobulus the Lindian said, Moderation is best.
But Chilon in hollow Lace­ daemon said, Know yourself.
But Periander, who in­ habited Corinth, said, Restrain anger.
Pittacus, whose family was of Mitylene, said, Nothing too much.
But Solon said, in holy Athens, Consider the end of life.
But Bias of Priene declared, The majority are the worse.
But Thales, the Milesian, said, Avoid being a security.
Erinna was of few words, and not of many stories, in songs;
but these little words obtained for her the Muses.
Therefore she has not missed a remembrance;
neither is she kept under the dark wing of black night;
but we the numberless myriads of new minstrels, waste away in ob­ livion in heaps.
The little lament of a swan is more agreeable than the cawing of jackdaws uttered in the spring-clouds.
Few were thy notes, Erinna, short thy lay;
But thy short lay the Muse herself has given ;
Thus never shall thy memory decay, Nor night obscure thy fame, which lives in heaven :
While we, the unnumbered bards of after-times, Sink in the melancholy grave unseen ;
Unhonour'd reach Avernus' fabled climes, And leave no record that we once have been.
Sweet are the graceful swan's melodious lays, Though but an instant heard, and then they die;
But the long chattering of discordant jays The winds of April scatter through the sky.

This is the Lesbian wax-tablet 2 of Erinna;
it is something sweet;
a little thing, but wholly mixed with the honey of the Muses ;
and the three hundred verses of her are equal to those of Homer;
her, the maiden nineteen years old, who through the fear of her mother stood by the distaff, or at the loom, a servant of and in­ spired by the Muses.
But as much as Sappho is better in lyrics than Erinna, by so much is Erinna better than Sappho in hexameters.
A parrot with human voice, having left its cage with sides of withies, came with its bright-coloured wing to a thicket, always practising salutations for illustrious Cæsar;

What path of life shall a person cut through ! In the forum are quarrels and difficult suits;
at home cares;
in the fields enough of toils ;
in the sea fright;
in a foreign land fear, if you have any thing;
but if you are in a difficulty, vexation.
Have you a wife ? you will not be without anxiety.
Are you unmarried? you live still more solitarily.
Children are troubles.
A childless life is a maimed condition.
Youth is thoughtless.
Grey hairs are strengthless.
There is a choice of one of these two things, either never to have been born, or to die as soon as born.
What path of life would man desire to keep ? Wrangling and strife the forum yields ;
at home Are cares ;
abroad, incessant toils ;
the deep Is vex'd with storms.
An exile would'st thou roam ? If wealthy, fears ;
if needy, slights await.
Would'st seek to wed ? Expect not so to shun The general doom.
Would'st choose a single state? In joyless gloom thy heavy hours will run.
Children are plagues ;
a childless life's accurst;
Folly's in youth ;
in age fresh infancy.
Never to have been born, the wise man first Would wish;
and next, as soon as born, to die.

You may cut through any path of life.
In the forum there is reputation and clever suits;
at home, rest;
in the fields, the beauty of Nature ;
in the sea, gain ;
in a foreign country, if you have any thing, fame ;
but if you are in a difficulty, you alone know it.
Have you a wife ? home will be best.
Are you unmarried ? you live still more easily.
Children are a desire ;
a childless life is without care.
Youth is robust;
and, on the other hand, grey hairs are pious.
There is not then the choice of one of two things, either never to have been born, or to die;
for all the things of life are good.
In every way of life true pleasure flows.
Immortal fame from public action grows.
Within the doors is found appeasing rest;
In fields the gifts of Nature are exprest.
The sea brings gain.
The rich abroad provide To blaze their names ;
the poor their wants to hide.
All households are best governed by a wife :
His cares are light, who leads a single life.
Sweet children are delights, which marriage bless ;
He, that hath none, disturbs his thoughts the less.
Strong youth can triumph in victorious deeds;
Old age the soul with pious notions feeds.
All states are good;
and they are falsely led, Who wish to be unborn, or quickly dead.

O Heliodora, I will give tears to you, even when un­ der the earth, 1 the remainder of my affection to Hades,1 tears sadly wept;
and I pour a libation upon the much- wept tomb, a stream2 of regret, a remembrance of my friendly feeling.
For piteoisly do I, Meleager, pite­ ously wail for thee, beloved even among the dead ;
a vain pleasure for Acheron.
Alas ! alas ! where is my regret­ ted blossom? Hades has snatched it, has snatched it.
But to thee, Earth, all nourishing, do I fall on my knees, that thou mayest, 0 mother, place gently in thy bosom her greatly bewailed.
Tears, all that love has left to give the dead, Take, Heliodora, e'en in Earth's lone bed.
Tears, bitter tears, the glistening mound below, Regress, affection's, fond memorials flow.
Thee sorely, sorely loved, though lost, laments Meleager ;
Pluto's bosom nought relents.
Ah ! where's my sours sweet blosom ? reft, the tomb Hath reft it;
dust has stain'd her prime of bloom.
All-nursing Earth ! oh, bid her softly rest, And gently fold my mourned one to thy breast.

But the father on seeing me, said—“ Thanks to yc u, my friend ;

For I send many souls untimely to Hades;

"A doctor, fond of letters, once agreed Beneath my care his son should learn to read.

Tantalus ate nothing, for the fruit of the plants shaken from above over his head fled from him;

But we, having been invited, eat all kinds of salted things, chennia,2 and cheeses, the salted fat of a goose, birds, and veal;

They say that Sarapis stood as a vision of the night over a murderer, while sleeping near a rotten wall, and uttered an oracle—“ Hollo ! you that lie there, stand up;
and having changed the place, sleep, wretched one, some where else.
" And he, through the dream, changed the place;
and the rotten wall on a sudden lay on the ground in pieces ;
and the malefactor rejoicing sacrificed to the gods early in the morning gifts for his safety, thinking that the god was pleased with murderers.
But Sarapis again stood near him in the night, and gave a pro­ phecy—“ Thinkest thou, wretch, that I care for the un­ just ! 1 If I had not left you to die, you had now escaped a painless death;
' but know that you are pre­ served for the cross.
"A murderer, sleeping by a tott'ring wall, Saw in a dream Sarapis' awful face;
And—“ Ho, thou sleeper, rise "-he heard him call, Go take thy slumber in some other place.
The murderer woke ;
departed ;

Calligenes, a countryman, when he had cast the seed in the ground, went to the house of Aristophanes, the astrologer, and inquiring, asked if there would be to him a favourable summer, and ungrudging abundance of ears of corn.
And he, after taking his counters, and arranging them over the tablet, and bending his fingers, spoke to Calligenes—“ If indeed the ground has become wet, as much as is sufficient, and shall not produce any flowers turning to wood [not fruit], and if the frost shall not break the furrow, nor the top of the rising sheaf be rubbed off by a hailstorm, nor fawns consume the crops, nor you see2 any failure of air or earth, I foretell to you a good harvest, and you shall well cut down the ears.

” 1WHAT man carelessly cut an unripe grape, the producer of wine, from a branch of a vine [sacred to] Bacchus ;

For by a draught from this some one might perhaps have come to singing, or had a release from sorrowful care.
Who has that unripe cluster torn, And thrown, with wrinkled lip, away, And left the parent vine to mourn Her fruit, to barbarous hands a prey ? May Bacchus on the spoiler turn His fiercest rage and bitterest smart, His head with fever'd phrensy burn, With agony distract his heart.
For hence some transitory pleasure The child of misery might have found, Burst into song of wildest measure, And quaff'd oblivion of his wound.

Theron, the [son] of Menippus, did, when a youth, pour out [waste] his paternal wealth basely upon ex­ pense uncontrolled.
But Euctemon, a friend of the family, when he perceived him now worn down by po­ verty, dry as a stick, did, shedding tears, raise him up, and made him the husband of his own daughter, and gave many marriage presents.
But when wealth came to Theron contrary to his expectations, immediately he indulged in the same expenses;
and thus did a second time the wave of destructive poverty flowing again hide [overwhelm] Theron.
A second time did Euctemon weep, not for him, but for the dowry and the marriage-bed of his daughter;
and perceived that it is not possible for a man, who had used improperly his own property, to be trust-worthy in that of another.
Phœbus said of Glaphyrus,1 the shrill-toned, after he had played sweetly upon the flute with many holes, “You have spoken falsely, Marsyas, about your invention;
for this person has taken as a spoil the flute of the Phrygian Athéné;

”Of Hope and Fortune there is to me no longer a care;

I am a poor man in Poverty, but I dwell with Freedom.

Do not, man, sit thou at the table of another, gratifying the belly with a morsel to be reproached;
at one time weep­ ing with a person weeping, and saddened [as to his] eye, and again laughing with him laughing, having no need thyself either of weeping or laughter.
I weep with Milia,l and I laugh with Milia.
Oh, do not at a stranger's table sit, Thy belly pleasing with a shameful bit;
Now weeping with the weeper's sadden'd face, Now laughing with the laugher's broad grimace, Needing thyself no tears or laugh;
the while I weep with Milia, and with Milia smile.

Hail, Frugality, 2 goddess [and] mistress, the object of desire to virtuous men,2 the offspring of renowned Tem­ perance, your excellence such persons honour, as prac­ tise what is just.
I came upon earth naked, and naked I shall go under the earth.
Why do I labour in vain, beholding my naked end ?Many things happen between the cup and the tip of the lip.
1Life has obtained by lot all pleasant paths.
In the midst of the city fellow-bands are a boast;
griefs at home are concealed.
The field brings delight, the sail­ ing gain;
a strange land knowledge.
From marriage a family has an union of sentiment;
to the unmarried life is without care.
A child becomes a wall of defence to a father;
to the childless fear is not in their path.
Youth knows how to give manliness;
grey [hairs] wisdom.
From thence obtaining confidence, 0 mortal, beget thou a family.
How shall any one fly from you, Life, without death ? For numberless are your pains ;
and neither to fly from nor endure them is it easy.
What are naturally beauti­ ful are pleasant, the earth, sea, stars, the orbs of the moon and sun.
But all the rest is fear and grief;
and should any one have any good, he waits for a retributive Nemesis.
From thee, 0 Life, and from thy myriad woes, Who, but by death, can flee, or find repose ? For though sweet Nature's beauties gladden thee, The sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, the sea, All else is fear and grief;
and each success Brings its retributive unhappiness.

The recently-born child of Lysippé having crept to a precipice, was commencing the unhappy fate of Asty­ anax.
But she guided it away, by putting forward the teat from her bosom, the deliverer from hunger and death.
Her infant playing on the verge of fate, When but an instants space had been too late, And pointed crags had claimed his forfeit breath, The mother saw.
She laid her bosom bare.
Her child sprang forward the known bliss to share, And that which nourished life now saved from death.

A single heifer, and a sheep with wool like hair, was the wealth of Aristides;
by these he kept off hunger from his door.
But he failed in both.
A wolf killed the sheep, and labour-pains the heifer;
and the herd of poverty perished :
and he having twisted a noose, with the string that tied round his wallet, to his neck, died piteously by his cabin, where there was no lowing.
One fleecy ewe, one heifer, were the store That drove dire want from Aristides' door.
He lost them both.
His teeming heifer died.
His single ewe the ravenous wolf descried, And bore away.
Thus all he had was gone.
Retiring to his silent hut alone, The belt that bound his empty scrip he takes, Fastens the noose, and wretched life forsakes.
F.
HA single heifer and a coarse-wool'd sheep Was all the wealth of Aristides poor.
With these he fondly fancied he could keep At least the pains of hunger from his door.
In both he fail'd.
A wolf the sheep devoured;
His heifer in the pains of labour died.
His flock thus lost, lie hung himself, mind-sour'd, In a noose twisting what his wallet tied, Hard by his cabin ;
where the poor man's shed Sounds heard no more;
himself and flock were dead.

Love does not wrong the race of voice-dividing [men];
but love is the pretext to the ill-regulated minds of mortals.
Why fear ye death, the parent of quietness, that which causes to cease diseases and the pains of poverty? He alone is at hand once to mortals, nor has any mortal seen him coming a second time.
But diseases are many and various, coming some to some mortals, and others to others, and changing places.
Why shrink from death, the parent of repose, The cure of sickness and all human woes ? As through the tribes of men he speeds his way, Once, and but once, his visit he will pay;
Whilst pale diseases, harbingers of pain, Close on each other crowd, an endless train.
W.
SHEPHERD.
Why fear ye death, the parent of repose, Who numbs the sense of penury and pain ? He comes but only once, nor ever throws, Triumphant once, his painful shaft again.

The road down to Hades is straight, whether you go from Athens, or depart from Meroé a corpse.
Let it not vex you that you have died at a distance from your country.
There is one wind that carries you from every where to Hades.
Whether from Athens thou begin, Or Meroé thy road, One trodden path still points the way Unto the joyless god.
And though an exile's death thou die, And see thy home no more, Blows from each clime a steady gale Swift to the Stygian shore.

Nature has found amongst men nothing more baneful than a man who makes a false show of pure friendship.
For we are not any longer on the watch as against an enemy;
but loving him as a friend, in this we are hurt the more.
No mischief worthier of fear In Nature can be found, Than friendship, in ostent sincere, But hollow and unsound.
For lull'd into a dangerous dream, We close in fold a foe;
Who strikes, when most secure we seem, The inevitable blow.

A home and country [are] the charm of life;
but overmuch care is to men not life, but labour.
I have seen the wall of the ancient1 Babylon, upon which chariots ran, and [the statue of] Jupiter2 by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens [of Babylon], and the Colossus of the Sun,1 and the great labour of the lofty Pyramids, and the vast monument of Mausōlus.
But when I beheld the house [temple] of Diana [at Ephesus],2 running up to the clouds, all these were ob­ scured ;
and if the sun has seen,3 it has never beheld any thing of such a kind, except Olympus.
Boldness, thou first leader of ships 4—for thou hast discovered the running over the sea, and hast excited the minds of men by gain-what deceitful timber hast thou planned and worked;
what a love of gain, detected by death, hast thou infused into man! 5 The age of voice- dividing men was truly golden, if the sea was seen from the land at a distance, as Hades is.
The wealth of the soul is the only true wealth.
6The rest of possessions have more annoyance.
6 That man it is just to call a possessor of much and wealthy, who is able to use his good things.
But if one is wasted away amongst pebbles [counters], ever hastening to heap one kind of wealth upon another, this man will labour, like the bee in its hive with many holes, while others take away the honey.
The riches of the mind alone are true ;
All other wealth only more trouble brings.
To him the title of a rich man's due, Who's able to make use of his good things.
But whoso's mind on calculations dwells, Intent on heaping money upon money, He, like the bee, adds to the hive new cells, Out of which others will extract the honey.

The expectation of death is a very painful sorrow.
A mortal when dead has this as a gain.
1 Do not then weep for him who has departed from life.
Of death there is no second suffering.
Death to expect brings much of grief and pain ;
Which not to feel the dead may count a gain.
For him lament not, who yields up his breath ;
There is no second suffering after death.

Temperance and Love, after coming in opposition to each other, both lost their lives.

For you are dead:
and much have the daughters of Mne­ mosyné [the Muses] lamented you, and chiefly your mo­ ther Calliopé.
Why do we moan over our own sons, when dead ? since even to the deities there is not a power to ward off Hades from their children.
No longer, Orpheus, shall thy sacred strains Lead oaks, and rocks, and beasts along the plains;
No longer put the boisterous winds to sleep, Or still the billows of the raging deep.
For thou art gone.
The Muses mourn'd thy fall In solemn strains ;
thy mother most of all.
Ye mortals, idly for your sons ye moan, Since thus a goddess could not save her own.

Ho, Nymphs, Nymphs, awake up the herdsman, bold as a wolf, lest Love be­ come a prey to wild beasts.

All things of yours I love;
but I dislike alone your ill-judging eye, that is pleased with men hateful [to me].
That man is the very best, who knows himself all things.
He too is good, who yields to a person who speaks correctly.
But he, who neither knows himself, nor determines in his mind to listen to another, that man is on the contrary useless.
Your sire, Hercules, has given an honourable return to the sweat [exertion] of your valour;
since labour knows how to bring an unbounded boasting to men, after an endless circle of contests.
Let no person persuade you, Cyrnus, to love a bad man.
Of what use is that man in being a friend ? He would neither defend you from a difficult trouble and calamity, nor be willing, while possessing a good, to share it.
In the case of him who does a good to bad persons, the favour is most vain.
It is equal to sowing the sea of the white ocean.
For neither in sowing the sea would you reap a rich harvest, nor in doing good to the bad would you receive any good in return.
For the bad have a feeling not to be satisfied.
Should you fail in one thing, the friendship arising from all previous acts is poured out [lost].
But the good, who derive the greatest advantage during their suffering, preserve a re­ membrance of the good done, and a gratitude for the future.
Never make the bad man your friend and com­ panion, but ever avoid him as a bad [unsafe] haven.
Many are the companions in drinking and eating;
but in a serious matter rather few.
Let no persuasive art tempt you to place Your confidence in crafty minds and base.
How can it answer ? Will their help avail, When danger presses, and your foes assail ? The blessing, which the gods in bounty send, Will they consent to share it with a friend ? No.
To bestrew the waves with scattered grain, To cultivate the surface of the main, Is not a task more absolutely vain, Than cultivating such allies as these, Fickle, and unproductive as the seas.
Such are all baser minds.
Never at rest, With new demands importunately pressed, A new pretension or a new request;
Till foil'd with the refusal of the last, They disavow their obligations past.
But brave and gallant hearts are cheaply gain'd, Faithful adherents, easily retained;
Men, that will never disavow the debt Of gratitude, or cancel or forget.
Never engage with a poltroon or craven;
Avoid him, Kurnus, as a treacherous haven;
Those friends and hearty comrades, as you think, Ready to join you, when you feast and drink, Those easy friends from difficulty shrink.
FRERE.
Be willing to live piously with little means, [rather] than to be wealthy, having obtained property unjustly.
All virtue, [to speak] comprehensively, consists in justice;
and every man, Cyrnus, is good by being just.
Fortune gives wealth even to a thoroughly bad man ;
but virtue, Cyrnus, follows a few men.
Satiety begets insolence, when wealth attends upon a bad man and one, to whom there is not a sound mind.
Never do thou, having been annoyed, lay to the charge of a person his poverty, that.
destroys feelings, nor his wretched want of means.
For Zeus turns the balance to one person on one side and on another to another, so as to be wealthy at one time, and to have nothing at another.
Never, Cyrnus, speak a big word.
For not a single person knows what a night and day will bring to pass to a man.
A part of this extract is thus translated by Frere— Wealth nurses Insolence;
and wealth we find, When coupled with a poor and paltry mind, Is evermore with Insolence combined.
Never in anger with the meaner sort Be moved to a contemptuous harsh retort, Deriding their distresses, nor despise In hasty speech their wants and miseries.
Jove holds the balance, and the gods dispense For all mankind riches and indigence.
We seek, Cyrnus, rams and asses and well-bred horses, and one wishes them to come from a good stock.
But a good man cares not to marry the bad [daughter] of a bad [father], if he [the father] gives him [the man] much wealth.
Nor does any [woman] refuse to be the wife of a bad man of wealth;
but she wishes a rich instead of a poor [man].
Persons honour wealth.
A good man has married out of a bad [family], and a bad one out of a good.
Wealth has mingled the race.
With kine and horses, Kurnus, we proceed By reasonable rules, and choose a breed For profit and increase, at any price, Of a sound stock, without defect or vice.
But in the daily matches that we make The price is every thing.
For money's sake Men marry ;
women are in marriage given ;
The churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven, May match his offspring with the proudest race:
Thus every thing is mix'd, noble and base.
FRERE.
Wealth to the man, to whom it comes from Zeus and with justice, ever flourishes purely and abidingly.
But if a man with a mind loving gain, shall possess it unjustly [and] unseasonably, or through an oath, having laid hold of it contrary to right, he seems indeed for the instant to carry off some gain;
but at the end there is, on the other hand, an evil.
The mind of the gods has the superiority.
Of riches no end has been laid down for man.
For such of us as have the greatest means of living hasten [to get] twice as much.
Who shall satisfy all ? Money to mortals becomes a madness.
The bad have been born altogether bad from the womb ;
but by having formed a friendship with bad men they have learned deeds of ill, and words of ill, and in­ solence, thinking that they [the bad] are saying all that is true.
Many bad persons are rich, while the good are poor.
But we will not change with them their wealth for our virtue, since the one is firm for ever ;
but wealth some­ times one, and sometimes another possesses.
A good man, Cyrnus, preserves his mind ever firm, and is bold, lying either in a good or bad state.
But if a deity gives to a bad man the means of living and wealth, he is un­ able through his folly to restrain his wickedness.
Hasten after nothing too much.
A fitting time is the best for all acts of man.
Often does a person hasten to virtue, while seeking gain, whom a deity on set purpose leads astray to a great mistake, and causes things easily to seem to him to be good, which are [really] evil, and those to be evil, which are useful.
Schemes unadvisable and out of reason Are best adjourned.
Wait for a proper season Time and a fair conjuncture govern all.
Hasty ambition hurries to a fall;
A fall predestined and ordained by heaven.
By a judicial blindness madly driven, Mistaking and confounding good and evil, Men lose their senses, as they lose their level.

Opinion is to men a great evil;
but a trial the best thing.
Many have an opinion of good things untried.
Do not, diseased in mind, be grieved at ills, nor be delighted at good things on a sudden, before seeing the extreme end.
Many silly persons has satiety destroyed;
for it is difficult to know moderation, when good things are present.
To a person doing a kindness to cowards there are two evils.
For he will deprive himself of many things belonging to himself, and there [ will be] no thanks [to him].
Do not praise, before you know a person clearly, his temper, and measure [of life] and conduct, whatever it may be.
Many, having a manner, like base [coin and] deceitful, conceal it, assuming feelings for the day.
But the habit of each of all these time shows forth.
For I have been very far from judgment;
and I have gone on in praising, before I knew all your habits.
But now, as a ship, I sheer off at a distance.
Oh Timagoras, it is difficult for a person looking from a distance to know the temper of many persons, although he is wise.
For some have concealed their wickedness by wealth, and others their virtue by destructive poverty.
Though gifted with a shrewd and subtle ken, Timagoras, the secret hearts of men, You'll find it, are a point hard to be guess'd.

Hope is the only kind deity to men.
The others have left and gone to Olympus.
Faith, a great goddess, has gone, and gone the Temperance of men, and the Graces, friend, have left the earth.
Just oaths are no longer trusted amongst men, nor does a single person regard the immortal gods.
The race of pious people has per­ ished ;
nor do [men] know any longer justice or piety.
But as long as one lives and beholds the light of the sun, being pious, as regards the gods, let him wait for Hope.
And let him pray to the gods, and, burning splendid thigh-offerings, let him sacrifice to Hope the first and last;
1 and let him even think upon the indirect language of unjust men, who, paying no regard to the immortal gods, ever keep their thoughts upon the goods of others, having made a base compact by evil deeds.
'For human nature Hope remains alone Of all the deities;
the rest are flown.
Faith is departed;
Truth and Honour dead;
And all the Graces too, my friends, are fled The scanty specimens of living worth, Dwindled to nothing, and extinct on earth.
Yet whilst I live and view the light of heaven, Since Hope remains and never has been driven From the distracted world-the single scope Of my devotion is to worship Hope.
When hecatombs are slain, and altars burn, When all the deities adored in turn, Let Hope be present;
and with Hope, my friend, Let every sacrifice commence and end.

No one can by giving a ransom escape from death or even a heavy misfortune, unless fate brings an end;
nor can a mortal man escape, although wishing it, from an unhappy state of mind, by means of gifts.
Ye Pierian Muses, the splendid children of Memory and Olympian Jove, hear me, while praying.
Grant me to possess happiness at the hands of the blessed gods, and ever a fair fame amongst all men ;
and to be pleas­ ant to friends, and bitter to enemies, and to appear to the former an object of respect, and to the latter of fear.
Property I desire indeed to possess;
but I do not wish to obtain it unjustly.
Last of all comes punishment.
But the wealth which the gods give, remains to a man firm from the lowest foundation to the top.
But that which men honour, comes from insolence, and not orderly, but obedient to unjust actions.
Nor does it follow willingly, but it is quickly mixed up with calamity.
Its commencement is from a little, as that of fire is, trifling at first, but it ends producing pain ;
for the acts of insolence do not exist a long time to mortals.
To many there is a custom to contradict upon ever;
subject equally;
but to contradict rightly, this is no in their custom.
Now to these the old saying is alon( sufficient-" This appears good to you;
that to me.
' Any one would by speaking well persuade most quickly the intelligent, who are persons of the easiest instruction.
To contradict alike, whatever is meant, Is more in fashion than fair argument.
And to all such the common phrase comes pat— " I am of this opinion;
you're of that.
" Yet men of sense at once to sense give way, As apprehending soonest what you say.

Once at the hour of midnight, when the Bear was turn­ ing at the hand of Βοο̄tes, and all the tribes of voice- dividing [men] were lying, subdued by toil, then did Cupid standing by knock at the bolts of my doors.
“ Who," said I, “ is battering the door ? you will break my dreams.
" And Love says—“ Open, I am a child;
be not alarmed;
and I am wet;
and I have been wan­ dering through a moonless night.
" On hearing this I pitied him.
And straightway lighting a lamp, I opened [the door] ;
and I beheld a child bearing a bow, and wings, and a quiver.
And placing him by the hearth, I warmed his hands in mine, and squeezed out the water from his wet hair.
But he, when the cold had left him, says—“ Come, let us try this bow, whether the string is at all injured by having been wetted.
And he extends [the arrow], and hits me in the middle of the liver, as if he were the sting of the gad-fly.
And he leaps up, laughing, and, " Stranger," said he, “ rejoice with me.
The horn 1 is uninjured ;
but you will have a pain at the heart.
"T was midnight's hour;

Who beats my door, thus loud and late, And scares my dreams ? " 'Tis I am here-- Open-a child ;
you need not fear.
I drop with wet, and, gone astray Through moonless night, have lost my way.
" I melted as he begg'd so hard, Rose;
struck a light;

And wrung the ringlets of his hair Rain-dropping on his face so fair.
When by degrees the cold had fled, " Come, let me try the bow," he said, " If wet has spoiled the flagging cord.

I wish, I wish to be in love.
Cupid was persuading me to love.
But I having a mind not given to advice, was not persuaded.
And he taking up instantly his bow and golden quiver, challenged me to a fight.
And I, taking on my shoulder a corslet, like Achilles, and spears, and a builds hide [shield], fought with Cupid.
He hit me;
and I fled.
But when he had his arrows no longer, he was annoyed, and shot himself as an arrow;
and he entered the middle of my heart, and dissolved [my strength].
In vain do I possess a bull's hide [shield].
or why should we be girt without, when a battle occu­ pies us within ?I will, I will Love's power obey.
Love woo'd me long to own his sway;
But when with thoughtless scorn elate I mock'd submission to his state, He snatch'd his bow and quiver'd pride, And to fierce combat me defied.
In haste to my defence I flew;
My mail across my shoulders threw ;
Like some Achilles braved the field, And shook my spear, and grasp'd my shield.
With Love I entered rebel-fight;
He wing'd his darts, I wing'd my flight;
Till having spent his feathered store, When that supplied revenge no more, Inflamed with rage, a living dart He shot himself into my heart.
Dissolved my soul, and revell'd there.
In vain a useless shield I wear;
An outward guard to folly turns, When in my breast the battle burns.

Oh thou clever one, earth-born, song-loving, without suffering, having flesh without blood, thou art nearly equal to the gods.
On your verdant throne elate, Lovely insect, there in state, Nectar'd dew you sip, and sing, Like a little happy king.
All thou seest so blooming fine, Lovely insect, all is thine, Which the painted fields produce, Or the soft-wing hours profuse.
Swains adore thy guiltless charms;
None thy blissful revel harms;
Thee, sweet prophet, all revere;
Thou foretell'st the ripening year.
Thou by Muses art caressed, Thou by golden Phoebus bless'd ;
He inspired thy tuneful voice;
Age ne'er interrupts thy joys.
Wisest offspring of the earth, Thou for nothing car'st but mirth;
Free from pain, and flesh, and blood, Thou'rt almost a little god.
ADDISON.
It is a hard thing not to love;
and it is hard likewise to love;
but the hardest of all is, when loving to fail.
To Love, family is nothing.
Wisdom, conduct is trodden down.
To money alone do [men] look.
May he perish who first loved silver.
For this a brother is not [a brother];
for this parents are not [parents].
Wars, murders, are for this.
And still worse, for this we lovers are undone.
'T is a pain to miss Love's smart;
Wing'd with pain is Cupid's dart;
But the most joy-killing pain Waits the love which loves in vain.
Noble birth has lost its charms ;
Wit no more the heart alarms;
Virtue pleads in vain for Love;
Gold alone can Beauty move.
Curst be he, ah! doubly curst, Who adored the idol first.
Gold 'mongst brothers sows debate;
Gold begets paternal hate;
Lights the torch of civil strife;
Kindles all the feuds of life:
Happy, ceased its mischiefs here;
Gold.
makes wretched Love despair.
ADDISON.
Venus was making a loud cry after Love, her son— " If any one has seen Love wandering in cross-roads, the run-away is mine.
The informer shall have a pre­ sent.
The child is very remarkable.
You would know him amongst twenty together.
He is not pale, as to his skin, but like fire.
His eyes are rather sharp, and lit up.
His thoughts are wicked.
His talk is pleasant;
for he does not mean and say alike.
His voice is like honey.
But if he is in a passion, his mind is ungentle.
He is a deceiver, saying nothing true.
A crafty child.
Savage in sport.
He has a head of handsome hair, but a pouting look.
His weapons are tiny, but he shoots them even to Acheron and the king of Hades.
He is naked as to his body;
but his mind has a thick cloak.
And winged, like a bird, he flies at one time against some men and women, and at another time against others.
And he settles on their entrails [heart].
He has a very small bow, and upon the bow an arrow.
The arrow is a tiny one;
but it is borne even to the sky.
And there is a golden quiver round his back.
But there are sharp arrows in it, with.
which he wounds even myself.
All his [doings] are cruel, all.
But much more is the torch, that, although it is little, burns even the sun itself.
If you catch him, bind and bring him.
Do not pity him.
And should you see him weeping, have a care lest he deceive you.
And if he laughs, drag him along.
But if he wants to kiss you, avoid him.
His kiss is mis­ chievous.
His lips are a poison.
But if he says, ' Take non-luxurious.
And guard against doing that which begets envy.
Do not expend beyond what is season­ able, like a person ignorant of what is honourable.
Nor be illiberal.
Moderation in all things is best.
And do those things which will not injure you:
and calculate before the act.
Nor receive sleep upon your softened eyes before you have thrice gone over each act of the day-What have I passed by? What have I done? What necessary act has not been done by me ? And be­ ginning from the first, go through them.
And then, if you have acted improperly, reproach yourself;
but if properly, be glad.
So labour;
so practise:
these precepts it is meet for you to love.
These will place you on the footsteps of divine virtue.
While I was still dreaming, the mighty Venus stood by me, leading by the hand Love infant-like, with his head stooping towards the ground;
and such a word she said —" Take Love, dear herdsman, and teach him to play.
" As she said this, she went away.
And I, a simpleton, began to teach Love, as if he were willing to learn, what herdsman's lore I knew;
how that Pan discovered the transverse flute, Athené the [straight] hautboy, Mercury the shell, and Apollo the reed.
This I was teaching him.
But he regarded not the stories;
but sang himself love ditties, and taught me the desires of mortals and immortals, and the doings of his mother.
And I indeed forgot whatever I had taught Love;
but whatever Love had taught myself, that I learnt all.
I dreamt I saw great Venus by me stand, Leading a nodding infant by the hand ;
And that she said to me familiarly­ " Take Love, and teach him how to play to me.
" She vanish'd then.
And I, poor fool, must turn To teach the boy, as if he wish'd to learn.
I taught him all the pastoral songs I knew And used to sing;
and I informed him too, How Pan found out the pipe, Pallas the flute, Phœbus the lyre, and Mercury the lute.
But not a jot for all my words cared he, But lo ! fell singing his love-songs to me;
And told me of the loves of gods and men, And of his mother's doings ;
and so then I forgot all I taught him for my part, But what he taught me, I learnt all by heart.
LEIGH HUNT.
O SOUL, soul,.
who art tost in cares, where the means of escape are difficult, keep thyself up, and protect thy­ self by throwing the breast before the foe, and stand firmly near the enemy in ambush ;
2 and neither, when a victor, be openly elated;
nor, when vanquished, fall down in the house and mourn.
But neither joy (too much) in things of joy, nor be dispirited too much in 'he midst of ills ;
but understand what kind of measure keeps men (within bounds).
Soul, oh ! soul, when round thee whelming Cares, like mountain surges, close, Patient bear their mighty rage, and With thy strength their strength oppose.
Be a manly breast your bulwark;
Your defence firm-planted feet;
So in serried line of battle Spears with calm composure meet.
Yet in victory's golden hour Raise not your proud vaunts too high;
Nor if vanquished, meanly stooping Pierce with loud laments the sky.
But in prosperous fortune so re­ joice, and in reverses mourn, As well knowing what is destined For the race of woman born.

Nor, conquered, yield, fall down at home and weep ;
Await the turns of life with duteous awe;

O Life ! how can we fly thee, Save through the gates of Death ? For cruel, countless, are the ills Encompassing thy path.
Impossible for any one, Either to suffer or to shun.
Yet beautiful is Nature In star, in earth, in sea, In silver moon, and golden sun;
Nought else from care is free.
And if with light man's spirit burns Awhile, the deeper gloom returns.

There is a saying,1 that Virtue dwells in rocks, to be ascended with difficulty, and that she is to be seen2 tending the holy spot.
And yet she is not to be looked upon by the eyes of all mortals.
He, to whom sweat eating the spirit shall not have come from within,1 (shall not) reach2 to the pinnacle of manliness.
'Tis said that Virtue dwells on high, 'Mid rocky steeps, that seek the sky, Where o'er a hallow'd realm she holds her sway.
No mortal eye her form hath met, Save his, from whose heart galling sweat Breaks out, and wins to manhood's top the way.
G.
Bo.
Virtue delights her home to keep, Say the wise of the olden time, High on a rugged, rocky steep, Which man may hardly climb.
And there a pure, bright, shining band, Her ministers, around her stand.
No mortal man may ever look That form august to see, Until with patient toil he brook The sweat of mental agony, Which all must do, who reach that goal, The perfect manhood of the soul.
HAT.
They say that Virtue doth aspire To dwell on high and pathless steeps, And there a bright celestial choir Around her constant vigil keeps.
Nor is she seen by mortal eyes, Unless through toil, that gnaws the soul, He, who would be her votary, rise To manhood's pure and perfect goal.

Thou oughtest, 0 blind Plutus! to be seen neither on earth, nor on the sea, nor on the continent;

But doom'd to dwell in deepest Hell:
Our woes are all from thee.

Being of a good mind, row on the way to Hades at a slow pace;
for the way is not hard to pass, nor is it crooked, nor is it filled with wanderings;
it is particu­ larly straight, and all sloping downwards, and is travelled even by persons with eyes closed.
With courage seek the kingdom of the dead;
The path before you lies, It is not hard to find, nor tread;
No rocks to climb, no lanes to thread;
But broad, and straight, and even still, And ever gently slopes down-hill;
You cannot miss it, though you shut your eyes C.

A vine creeping up conceals me, a withered plane- tree, and I bloom with a foreign leaf, I, who formerly nourished bunches of grapes on my flourishing branches ;
I, who was with not less leaves than this (vine).
Such a mistress however let one nourish hereafter, who alone knows how to requite even the dead.
See yonder blushing vine-tree grows, And clasps a dry and withered plane, And round its youthful tendrils throws, A shelter from the wind and rain.
That sapless trunk in former time Gave covert from the noon-tide blaze, And taught the infant shoot to climb, That now the pious debt repays.
E'en so, kind Powers, a partner give To share in my prosperity, Hang on my strength, while yet I live, And do me honour, when I die.
F.

Me, a dry plane-tree now, this creeping vine Mantles in robes, whose verdure is not mine;
For these bare arms, once leafy as her own, Would nurse her clusters, and their beauty crown.

ARCHIAS OF MITYLENE.
Let any one praise the Thracians,1 in that they lament for sons, who came to light from the womb of a mother;
and, on the other hand, deem happy such as, leaving life, Death, not previously seen, the servant of the Fates, has seized upon.
For they, who live, are ever passing on to evils of all kinds;
while the dead have found a remedy for ills.
Thracians, who howl around an infant's birth, And give the funeral hour to songs and mirth, Well in your grief and gladness are expressed, That life is labour, and that death is rest.
BL.
The Thracians' custom I applaud, for they Bewail the infant on his natal day ;
But joy, when death with unexpected blow Consigns the spirit to the shades below.
Full well, for every ill besets man's life ;
But death's the balm of all its varied strife.

I love not the ploughed fields with their heavy crops, nor the happiness, like what Gyges had, from much gold ;

How far, 0 wretched soul! wilt thou, still flying with vain hopes close to the cold clouds, write down your dreams of wealth, some in this way, and others in that ? By mortals nothing is to be obtained spontaneously.
But do you go after the gifts of the Muses, and give up these indistinct phantoms of the soul to simpletons.
How long upon vain hopes, 0 wretched soul ! Still fluttering too near the cloud's cold chill, Shall dream on dream of riches thee cajole ? For nought accrues to mortals, as they will.
Seek thou the Muses' gifts, and leave to fools These visions dim, wrought by thy fancy's tools E.

Lo ! the beautiful (and) self-elaborated flowing1 from bees in the air,2 and the self-fixed cells, not made by hands (of man) 3 a gratis-boon for the life of man, that requires not a spade (to dig), nor an ox (to plough), nor crooked scythes (to reap), but a small bowl, where the sweet stream of the bees4 flows, as a fountain, abundant from a small hut (hive).
Farewell, ye light-borne5(crea­ tures), and may ye feed on flowers, the winged workers of ethereal nectar.
Ah ! sweet spontaneous effluence of the bee, Air-form'd.
Ah! cells by hands unlabour'd, ye.
Free boon to man ;
no need has he of hoe, The plough's slow tilth, or sickle's reaping bow;

A staff led me up to a temple, when 1 was uninitiated, 1 not only in sacred rites, but in the light of the sun.

But as time, while progressing, produces interest, so does it hoary old age likewise;

All things are a laugh, and all are dust, and all are nothing.
For all are produced from things without rea­ son.
Children are cares, if they suffer some great evil;
and cares too they are not a few, even when living.
A good wife has in herself some delight;
but a bad one brings to the husband a bitter life.
I Lais, who was of old (Love's) dart to all, am no longer Lais, but am become, conspicuous to all, the Nemesis of years.

O goddess! who hatest the poor, and art the sole sub­ duer of wealth, (and) who knowest how to live well at all times, thou delightest to be supported on strange feet, and knowest how to wear shoes of felt,1 and oint­ ments are a care to thee.
Thee too a garland delights, and the liquor of the Ausonian Bacchus.
But these things never exist at any time to the poor.
And there­ fore thou fliest from the threshold of poverty, that has no copper, and art delighted, on the other hand, in coming to the feet of wealth.
Let a seal for words not to be spoken lie on the tongue.
A watch over words is better than over wealth.

Oh! the race of man, subject to many tears, without strength, an object of pity, dragged below the earth, and resolved (into it).
Tears were my birthright;
born in tears, In tears too I must die;

Life is an unsafe voyage;
for being tost in a storm we often make stumblings in it, more piteous than persons shipwrecked.
But having fortune, as the pilot of life, we sail, as it were on a sea, in a doubtful manner;
some with a favourable voyage, others, the contrary.
And yet all of us depart to one port, which is below the earth.
Life is an unsafe voyage, where we 're tost And suffer more than those in shipwrecks lost.
But should we Fortune take the helm to guide, Still is the bark oft strain'd from side to side.
Some lucky onwards sail;
and back some fall;
One port beneath the earth is reach'd by all.

You are rich.
And what remains ? Do you, when you depart, drag your wealth with you, being dragged to the tomb ? Wasting your time, you collect riches;
but you are not able to heap up a more abundant mea sure of life.
Alas! for the short pleasure that is in life.
Lament the fleetness of time.
We sit and lie down, in trouble or in luxury.
But time runs on;
(and) as it runs against us unhappy mortals, it brings to the life of each an (evil) turn.
A suffering of the soul (is) the body, Hades, Fate, the burden of Necessity,1 and a powerful chain, and a punishment by tortures.
But when it (the soul) shall have departed from the body, it flies, as if from the bonds of death, to an immortal god.
Columns, and painters' brushes,2 and triangular desks,3 are the cause of great delight to those, who possess them, as long as they live;
for vain-glories benefit not much the spirits of men deceased.
But virtue and the grace of wisdom go together even thither,4 and they remain here attracting a remembrance.
Thus neither Plato nor Homer pride themselves on colours or columns, but on their wisdom alone.
Happy ( are they), of whom the remembrance dwells for ever in the forms of clever books, and not in vain likenesses.
Of Death—Rest's parent, leech of all disease And poverty's deep pangs-what means our fears ? Death, before whom all human sorrow flees;
Death, who but once, and only once, appears.
Whereas disease is multiform ;

fear then Disease and Pain.

Seated by this table of polished stone, you will have a pleasant game in shaking the rattling dice.
But when vou are the winner, do not be elated ;
nor when the loser, be grieved, finding fault with the trifling throw.
For the mind of a man is seen through in trifles, and the dice tell the depth of the power of mind.
All these things are games.
The rush of fortune, which takes different turns, is borne along, like throws without reason.
And you will perceive a slippery1 imi­ tation of the life of man, by being now the superior, and now the inferior.
We praise then him, who both in life, and at dice (playing), adopts moderation in joy and sorrow.
Whither dost thou direct the sword ? Against my belly or my breast ? The belly brought thee forth;

O Glaucus ! son of Epicydes, for the present indeed it is more gainful to conquer thus by an oath, and to ob­ tain the spoil of money.
Swear ;
since death awaits even the man, who keeps his oath.
But there is of oath an offspring without a name, nor has it hands or feet.
And yet it pursues fleetly, until it seizes and destroys the whole race, and the whole house.
But better after­ wards is the race of the man, who keeps his oath.
The holy places of the gods are open to the good;
nor is there a need of purifications;
no pollution touches virtue.
But thou, who (hast) a mischievous heart, de­ part ;
for shall a wetted body wash out thy soul ?Come, pure as to thy soul, to the grove of a pure deity, after you have touched a virgin-like stream, since for the good, a small drop is sufficient.
2 But the bad man not even the whole ocean would with its waters wash.
3Enter the pure god's temple sanctified In soul, with virgin water purified.
One drop will cleanse the good ;
the ocean wave Suffices not the guilty soul to lave.

If a little of sweet wine be left in vessels, the portion left is turned to vinegar.
So after having drawn out the whole of life, and coming to the depth of old age, the old man becomes soured.

And thus, if to the dregs life's joy you drain, The peevishness of sour old age is thine.

He is not a friend, who, while drinking wine close to a full bowl, speaks of quarrels, and tear-bringing war;
but he, who, mixing together the brilliant gifts of the Muses and Venus, calls to mind a joyousness delightful.

When the wind roared, while blowing against the well-wrought chest, and the water was agitated (Danaë) sunk with fear ;
nor with cheeks unwetted did she throw her arms around Perseus, and said-Alas ! my child, what troubles do I endure! and yet thou slumberest sweetly;
and with the feelings of the suckling1 thou steepest in a dwelling, cheerless, and bound with bolts of brass, and in darkness, where the night shines with a livid colour.
But thou regardest not the wave passing by above thy dry and thick hair, nor the noise of the wind, lying with thy pretty face in a small purple robe.
If any thing were dreadful to thee, this at least is dreadful.
And if thou couldest give a slight ear to my words, I ex­ hort thee-Sleep, my babe;
sleep too, thou sea:
and sleep, my measureless ills.
But may some change of plan 3 ap­ pear from thee, 0 Zeus ;
and, what is a bold word, I pray for judgments in my favour by the hands of my child.
When the wind resounding high Bluster'd from the northern sky ;
When the waves in stronger tide Dash'd against the vessel's side, Her care-worn cheek with tears bedew'd, Her sleeping infant Danaë view'd ;
And trembling still with new alarms, Around him cast a mother's arms.
My child, what woes doth Danaë weep ! But thy young limbs are wrapt in sleep.
In that poor nook all sad and dark, While lightnings play around our bark, Thy quiet bosom only knows The heavy sigh of deep repose.
The howling wind, the raging sea, No terror can excite in thee :
The angry surges wake no care, That burst above thy long deep hair.
But could'st thou feel, what I deplore, Then would I bid thee sleep the more.
Sleep on, sweet boy ;
still'd be the deep ;
Oh ! could I lull my woes to sleep ! Jove, let thy mighty hand o'erthrow The baffled malice of my foe ;
And may this child in future years Avenge his mother's wrongs and tears.

But when around that Dædalean ark The wind blew roaring, and the upheaved deep Overwhelmed the mother's soul with new alarms, Her cheeks bedew'd with mournful brine, She clasp'd young Perseus in her arms, And said, " What woes, beloved child, are mine! But thou dost sleep a balmy sleep, Like thine own peaceful breast profound, Within this joyless home, joyless and dark, With brazen bolts encompassed round, All undisturbed ;
though moonbeams play Upon the wave, no glimmering ray Finds entrance here;
nor billows wild, That harmless burst above thy long deep hair, Nor the loud tempest's voice, my child, Awake in thee one thought of care.
Thou sleep'st as on a couch;
thy beauteous head Still on its purple cloaklet spread ;
Yet could these terrors terror wake in thee, Or could thine infant ear Catch but the note of fear, These lips pronounce, my words should rather be, Sleep, sleep, my child ;
and sleep, thou sea;
And sleep, oh ! sleep, my misery.
But hear, great father Jove, my prayer! Frustrate this babe's untimely doom- Spare him, great Jove;
I bid thee spare- (Oh! what a mother's soul may dare—) Avenger of my wrongs in years to come.

Well has the sculptor felt, what he expressed;

Ever your glory through the land shall live, dearest Harmodius and Aristogeiton, because ye killed the tyrant, and caused Athens to be under equal laws.
I 'll wreathe my sword in myrtle bough, The sword that laid the tyrant low;
When patriots burning to be free, To Athens gave equality.
Harmodius, hail! though reft of breath, Thou ne'er shalt feel the stroke of death.
The heroes' happy isles shall be The bright abode allotted thee.
I '11 wreathe the sword in myrtle bough, The sword that laid Hipparchus low, When at Minerva's adverse fane, He knelt, and never rose again.
While freedom's name is understood, You shall delight the wise and good;
You dared to set your country free, And gave her laws equality.

In myrtles veil'd I will the falchion wear;
For thus the patriot sword Harmodius and Aristogeiton bare, When they the tyrant's bosom gored ;
And bade the men of Athens be Regenerate in equality.
Beloved Harmodius, oh ! never Shall death be thine, who livest for ever.
Thy shade, as men have told, inherits The islands of the blessed spirits:
Where deathless live the glorious dead, Achilles fleet of foot and Diomed.
In myrtles veiled I will the falchion wear ;
For thus the patriot sword Harmodius and Aristogeiton bare.
When they the tyrant's bosom gored;
When, in Minerva's festal rite, They closed Hipparchus' eyes in night.
Harmodius' praise, Aristogeiton's name, Shall bloom on earth with undecaying fame:
Who with the myrtle-wreathed sword The tyrant's bosom gored;
And bade the men of Athens be Regenerate in equality.

My wealth is a great spear and sword, and a beauti­ ful shield, made out of a raw hide, the defence of my skin.
With this I plough ;
with this I reap ;
with this I tread sweet wine from the vine;
by this I am called the lord of the household.
And they, who dare not possess a spear and a beautiful shield, made out of a raw hide, all fall on their knees to me, and worship me as their lord, and call me mighty king.
My wealth is here ;
the sword and spear;
The breast-defending shield;
With this I plough;
with this I sow;
With this I reap the field.
With this I tread the luscious grape, And drink the blood-red wine;
And slaves around in order wait.
And all are counted mine.
But he, who will not rear the lance Upon the battle-field, Nor sway the sword, nor stand behind The breast-defending shield, On lowly knee must worship me, With servile kiss adored, And peal the cry of homage high, And hail me mighty lord.
SIR DANIEL SANDFORD.
Much riches these me yield, My gallant spear and sword, And my brave hide-cover'd shield, The bulwark of its lord.
'Tis thus I reap and plough ;
'Tis thus the sweet grape tread 'Tis thus the household bow, And call me lord and head.
By those, who will not dare The spear and sword to wield, And the bulwark will not bear Of the brave hide-cover'd shield, Down on their knees before me, While one and all I bring, Must as their liege adore me, And hail me mighty king.

O health! thou most to be honoured amongst the blessed (powers), with thee may I live the remainder of life;
and may thou be my careful fellow-dweller.
For if there be to man any pleasure in wealth, or in chil­ dren, and in kingly-rule, equal to the gods, or in the desires, which we hunt after with the hidden nets of Venus;
or if there has been seen any other delight given by the gods to man, or respite from labours, with thee, blessed health, all things flourish, and shines the spring of loveliness.
But without thee no one is happy.
Health, brightest visitant from heaven, Grant me with thee to rest;
For the short term by nature given, Be thou my constant guest.
For all the pride that wealth bestows;
The pleasure that from children flows;
Whatever we court in regal state, That makes men covet to be great;
Whatever sweet we hope to find In love's delightful snare ;
Whatever good by heaven assign'd, Whatever pause from care;
All flourish at thy smile divine, The spring of loveliness is thine ;
And every joy that warms our hearts, With thee approaches and departs.

Hygeia, thou most blest of heavenly powers, Oh! may I spend my life's remaining hours With thee;
and deign thou, goddess ever blest, To dwell with me, a well-pleased fellow-guest.
Since all the joys, which wealth or offspring brings, The pomp, the power, the circumstance of kings, Whereby the monarch vies with gods above, The eager, furtive, toil-won joys of love, All the delights, which heaven to man may doom, Bless'd Hygeia, live with thee and bloom.
Bright shines the Graces' spring, when thou art near, And happy hours without thee disappear.
HAY.
Oh holiest Health! all other gods excelling, May I be ever blest With thy kind favour, and in life's poor dwelling Be thou, I pray, my constant guest.
If aught of grace or charm to mortals lingers Round wealth, or kingly sway, Or children's happy faces in their play, Or those sweet bands which Aphrodite's fingers Weave round the trusting heart, Or whatsoever joy or breathing space Kind Heaven has given to worn humanity, Thine is the charm, to thee they owe the grace.
Life's chaplet blossoms only where thou art, And Pleasure's year attains its sunny spring :
And where thy smile is not, our joy is but a sigh.

The Paphian Cytherea (Venus) came by sea to Cnidus, desirous of beholding her own image ;
and after looking round 1 every where in a spot, seen all around,1 she cried out-Where did Praxiteles see me naked ? Praxiteles did not see what was not lawful;
but the iron (chisel) cut the Paphian, such as Mars wished.
Bright Cytherea thought one day To Cnidos she'd repair, Gliding across the watery way To view her image there.
But when arrived, she cast around Her eyes divinely bright, And saw upon that holy ground The gazing world's delight, Amazed, she cried-while blushes told The thoughts that swelled her breast- Where did Praxiteles behold My form ? or has he guess'd ? J.

Let the rough tops of the oak-grove be silent, and the rills from the rock, and the much-mingled bleating of ewes who have young;
since Pan himself is playing on his well-toned pipe, by putting his flexible lips over the united reeds;
and the Nymphs who preside over waters, and those who preside over oaks, have formed a dance around with their tender feet.
Sleep, ye rude winds, be every murmur dead On yonder oak-crown'd promontory's head.
Be still, ye bleating flocks ;

Hang silent on your rocks, ye waterfalls.
Pan on his oaten pipe awakes the strain, And fills with dulcet sounds the pastoral plain ;

Bringing your foot (hither) direct it in a quiet manner, lest perchance you rouse up the boy, who is soothed by a gentle slumber.

Mute marble once from man I learn'd to live.

In purple wine denied to revel more, Sweet draughts of water from my urn I pour.
But, stranger, softly tread, lest any sound Awake yon boy, in rosy slumbers bound.

Behold the old Anacreon, abundantly shaken by wine, with a garland1 (on his head), upon a well-turned mar­ ble (seat).
How the old fellow looks with eyes lascivi­ ous.
and moist, and has drawn his robe down to his heels;
but one of his slippers he has, like a drunken man, lost;
and the other fitted to his wrinkled foot.
And he is singing either of the lovely Bathyllus, or Megisteus, while raising on high the lyre, ill-suited to love,2 with his hand.
But do you, father Dionysus, guard him.
For it is not reasonable that a servant of Bacchus should, through Bacchus, fall.
Come, see your old Anacreon, How, seated on his couch of stone, With silvery temples garlanded, He quaffs the rich wine rosy-red.
How, with flush'd cheek and swimming eye, In drunken fashion from his thigh He lets his robe unheeded steal, And drop and dangle o'er his heel.
One sandal's off, one scarce can hide The lean and shrivell'd foot inside.
Old Anacreon ! hark, he sings Still of love to th' old harp-strings.
Still, Bathylla, still, Megisté, How he coax'd ye, how he kiss'd ye.
Gentle Bacchus, watch and wait, You must watch, and hold him straight;
Hold him up ;
for if he fall, You lose your boldest Bacchanal.

Do not, way-farer, drink here the warm water from a pond surrounded1 by mud, and frequented by sheep, but go a little further over the high ground, where heifers feed;

Not here, 0 thirsty traveller, stop to drink, The sun has warmed, and flocks disturb'd its brink;

There will you find a bubbling rill, that flows Down the smooth rock, more cold than Thracian snows.

Mischievous Love, having laid aside his torch and arrows, took up an ox-driving stick, and placed a wallet adown his shoulders;

The sportsman, Epicydés, searches after every hare in the mountains, and the footsteps of every fawn, making use of the hoar-frost and the snow.
But if any one says —" Here, this animal has been hit”—he does not take it up.
And such is my love.
It knows how to pursue what flies from it;
but it flies past what lies before it.
2Mark, Epicydes, how the hunter bears His honours in the chase.
When timid hares And nobler stags he tracks through frost and snow O'er mountains, echoing to the vales below, If then some clown bawls out—“ Here, master, here, Lies panting at your feet the stricken deer—” He takes no heed, but starts for newer game.
Such is my love, and such his arrows' aim;
That follows still with speed the flying fair, But deems the yielding slave below his care.

The hunter, used to frost and snow, Tracks o'er the mountains every roe And every timid hare.
But say to him—“ Ho ! there, Look to your stricken game—” he takes no heed.
My passion, Epicydes, is the same;
I chase each flying nymph with eager speed, But pass with disregard the yielding dame.

WSo may you sleep, Conopion, as you cause me to lie at these cold portals.
So may you sleep, most unjust one, as you cause your lover to lie;
and with not even the shadow of pity have you given him to meet.
' The neighbours pity me.
But you not even the shadow of it.
But your grey hair will shortly remind you of all these matters.
Such sleep, Conopion, on thine eyelids wait, As sits on his, now shivering at thy gate.
Such sleep, thou false one, as thou bidst him prove, Who vainly sues thy stony breast to move.
Not e'en a shade of pity thou 'It bestow.
Others may weep to see me suffer so ;
But thou-not e'en a shade.
Oh cruel fair ! Be this remembered with thy first grey hair.

The Graces are four.
For, in addition to the three well known, one has lately been moulded;

Four are the Graces.

No more, 0 Nymph-begotten Satyr, shalt thou through pine-producing Phrygia play, as erst, a strain, speaking through the well-bored reeds;
nor, as before, shalt bloom in thine hands the work of the Tritonian Athéné.
For thou art kept down as to thy hands by chains, not to be loosened ;
because thou, a mortal, didst meet Phœ­ bus in a divine contest:
and the pipe which sounded a strain, equally sweet with the harp, has given after the contest not a garland but Hades.
No more through Phrygia's pine-bearing land Shalt thou, as erst, 0 Nymph-born Satyr, play;
Nor bid through well-bored reeds the strains expand From what Athéné fashion'd ;
for in chains, Not to be loosen'd, are thy fingers bound ;
And pipes, that breathed the harp's mellifluous strains, Have garland none for thee, but Hades found ;
Since a mere mortal thou didst dare to call To contest Phœbus, lord of music all.

Who has thus fettered you and made you unholily a captive? Who has bound your hands in folds, and devised your dirty face ? Where are your rapid arrows, infant ? Where the bitter and fire-bearing quiver ? Surely the sculptor has laboured vainly, who in this net hath bound you, who cause the gods to be tost wave­ like with madness.
Breathe, Pan, the mountain-treader, a strain with thy pleasant lips;
breathe it, delighted with the shepherd's reed, and pour forth melody with thy sweet-sounding pipe;
and rattle away, directing the harmony of thy fellow-minstrel's words.
And around thee, according to the beat of the rhythm, let a divine footing break out from these Water-Nymphs.
Who has tied up to this.
oak the newly despoiled arms ? Whose Dorian small-shield has an inscription on it? I Who of the brigade at Thyria has approached after the bloody battle ?1 We are left, the only two of the Argives.

Stop your going.
For the victory of the Laconians is proclaimed on this2 shield by drops of the blood of Othryades, and he who laboured at this work is gasping near.
Oh ancestral Jove, hate the marks of a fight, where victory is not.
Venus is not at Sparta, as in other cities, placed as a statue, dressed in soft garments;
but on her head she has a helmet instead of a veil, and instead of golden boughs,3 a spear.
For it is not meet that she, who is the wife of the Thracian Mars, and a Lacedæmonian, should be without arms.
A Spartan Venus! yes, for there she stands, Not in soft vestments, as in other lands;
A helmet's weight and not a veil she wears;
No golden myrtle, but a lance she bears.
So should it be;
a warlike Spartan's dame And Mars' own queen should be equipped the same.

1Some say that your nurse, Homer, was Colophon ;
others, the beautiful Smyrna;
others, Chios ;
others, los ;
and others have bawled out for Salamis with its happy allotments;
2 others again for Thessaly, the mother of the Lapithæ.
And some have shouted for one land, and some for another.
But if I must speak unhesitatingly the knowing oracles of Phœbus, the great heaven is your country, and you were not from a mortal parent, but from Calliopé your mother.
From Colophon some deem thee sprung ;
From Smyrna some, and some from Chios ;
These noble Salamis have sung, While those proclaim thee born in Ios ;
And others cry up Thessaly, The mother of the Lapithæ.
Thus each to Homer has assigned The birth-place just which suits his mind.
But if I read the volume right, By Phœbus to his followers given, I'd say-They 're all mistaken quite, And that his real country 's heaven ;
While for his mother, she can be No other than Calliope.

As much as the trumpet sounds above the flute, made of the bones of fawns, so much does your harp sound above all.
Nor in vain has the brown swarm (of bees) formed their honey, bound with wax, around your tender lips, 0 Pindar.
The horned god of Mænalus is the wit­ ness, by singing your hymn (upon him) and forgetting the shepherd's reeds.
As the loud trumpet to the goat-herd's pipe, So sounds thy lyre, all other sounds surpassing;
Since round thy lips, in infant fulness ripe, Swarm'd honey-bees, their golden stores amassing.
Thine, Pindar, be the palm by him decreed, Who holds on Mænalus his royal sitting;
Who for thy love forsook his simple reed, And hymns thy lays in strains a god befitting.

As the voice of the jubilant trumpet's swell Surpasses the goatherd's flute, So, Pindar, wherever thou strik'st the loud shell, Overpower'd, all others are mute.

And Mænalian Pan, for the charm of thy song, Laid his pastoral ditty aside.

1Where has thy grandeur, Corinth, shrunk from sight ? Thy ancient towers, and thy rampart's height ? Thy godlike palaces and fanes ? Oh ! where Thy mighty myriads and majestic fair ? Relentless war has poured around the wall, And hardly spared the traces of thy fall.

This is a small dwelling—since I am located near the dark wave, the mistress of the moistened shore-but dear to me;
for I rejoice at the ocean widely fearing, and sailors being saved through me.
Propitiate Venus ;
and I will breathe favourably upon you, either in love-mat­ ters, or on the wide-gaping sea.
Small is this dome, where o'er the billowy main, Sole empress of the sea-beat shore, I reign, Yet dear ;
for much I love the roaring sea, And much the shipwrecked seaman saved by me.
Worship thou Venus.

Simple this shrine, where by the dark-white wave I sit the mistress of a briny shore, Simple, but loved ;

Thee, 0 swallow, the mother of young ones lately born-thee, just now warming thy offspring under thy wing, did a serpent with many folds, after having en­ tered within the nest where nurslings are tended, de­ prive of what had been thy labour pains ;
and when it came rolled up1 to destroy thee too, while lamenting, it fell into the violent breath of a fire from a hearth.
Thus did the evil-doer die.
See how Vulcan, as a protector, saved the race,2 that came from his son Erichthonius.
Lampon, the hunting dog of Midas, did thirst destroy, although it had laboured much for its life.
For with its feet it had dug up the moist ground;
but the sluggish water did not hasten from a blind fountain;
and it fell giving up the task.
The water bubbled up, however.
Surely the Nymphs brought upon Lampon their anger for the fawns that had been killed.
I am lying down.
Tread with thy heel upon my neck, thou savage deity.
I know thee, by the gods, as being difficult to bear.
I know too thy arrows of fire.
But if thou hurlest fire-brands against my heart, thou wilt not burn it now.
It is all a cinder.
Ay, tread on my neck, tyrant Cupid.
I swear, Though so little, your weight is no trifle to bear.
But I laugh at your darts, tipp'd with flaming desire;
Since my heart, burnt to ashes, is proof against fire.
B.

Why is it strange, if Love, the man-destroyer, shoots his fire-breathing arrows, and laughs bitterly with his saucy eyes.
Does not his mother love Mars ? and is she not the wife of Vulcan, and thus common to fire and swords ? Does not the Sea, the mother of his mother, roar roughly under the lashings of the winds ? And no one is his father, and he is the father of no one.
Hence he possesses the fire of Vulcan, and cherishes anger equal to the waves, and (has) the blood-stained weapons of Mars.
No wonder Love, the ravisher of hearts, For slaughter raging, hurls fire-breathing darts;
With bitter scorn envenoms every wound, And laughs at every death he scatters round.
For Mars, the homicide, his mother vows A lawless flame, while Vulcan is her spouse.
Common to fire and sword, the daughter she Of the wild, boisterous, tempest-scourged Sea.
But who or whence his sire, can no man trace.
No wonder then, since such is Cupid's race, His arrows Mars, hot Vulcan's forge supplied His fire, his fury the remorseless tide.

Terrible is Love, terrible.
But what avails it, if I should say, again and again, mourning often, terrible is Love ? For surely the boy laughs at this, and is pleased, when often ill-treated;
and is nourished, should I speak abuse.
And it is a wonder to me, how you, Venus, who appeared through a blue wave, produced out of a moist substance, fire.
Mighty is Love;
most mighty;
once again I cry, most mighty, writhing with my pain, And deeply groaning;
who, for mischief born, Mocks at our woes, and laughs our wrongs to scorn.
The cold blue wave, from which thy mother came, Proud boy, should quench, not feed, that cruel flame.

By Venus, I will burn all things of yours, Love, by firing them, both the bow and quiver that holds the Scythian arrows.
Yes, I will burn them.
Why do you laugh in a silly manner, and turn up your lip, grinning with a Satyr-like look? Perhaps you will have a Sardonic1 laugh.
For surely I will cut off your quick wings, the guides of desires, and I will rivet a fetter, bound with brass, around your feet.
And yet I shall have a Cad­ mean victory,2 if I join you as a near-dweller to my soul, a lynx near goat-folds.
3 But come thou, hard to be conquered, and take your light sandals and stretch thy rapid wings towards others.
Love, by the author of your race, Of all your sweetest joys the giver, I vow to burn, before your face, Your arrows, bow, and Scythian quiver.
Yes, though you point your saucy chin, And screw your nostrils like a Satyr, And show your teeth, and pout, and grin, I'll burn them, boy, for all your clatter.
I'll clip your wings, although they be Heralds of joy;
your legs I'll bind With brazen bolts ;
you shan't get free.
Alas! I have but caught the wind.
Oh ! what had I with Love to do, A wolf among the sheep-folds roaming ? There, take your wings, put on your shoe, And tell your playmates you are coming.

Where is the former study of reason ? Let the great labour of wisdom be cast aside.
This one thing only do I know, that Love has brought down even the proud bearing of Jove.

Oh ! where has godlike Reason fled ? And Wisdom, where ? They prostrate lie among the mighty dead.

Surely thou art by nature a traitor, and not to be trusted;
and telling me to conceal thy mysteries, thou art now'willing to disclose mine.
Bacchus, I yield me to thy sway;
Master of revels, lead the way.
Conqueror of India's burning plain, My heart obeys thy chariot rein.
In flames conceived, thou sure wilt prove Indulgent to the fire of love ;
Nor count me rebel, if I own Allegiance to a double throne.
Alas! alas! that power so high Should stoop to treacherous perfidy! The mysteries of thy hallowed shrine I ne'er profaned.

oh! how can I be free ? Since Loves on every side enclose me round, Forbidding me to breathe a single hour In peace, since first thy beauty, then thy lyre, Thy face, and then-oh! words of feeble power- Thy perfect all has set me all on fire.

The three Graces 2 (have given) a triple crown to my mistress2 Zenophila, the symbols of a three-fold beauty.
One has placed upon her Desire, on account of her colour;
another, Love on her form ;
and another, on her discourse sweet-spoken words.
Triply fortunate is she, whose bed Venus has furnished;
3 language, Per­ suasion;
and sweet beauty, Love.
The Sister-Graces for my fair A triple garland wove, When with each other they to make A perfect mistress strove.
A tint, to mock the rose's bloom;
A form, like young Desire ;

Thrice-happy fair! whom Venus arm'd With joy's ecstatic power, Persuasion with soft eloquence, And Love with beauty's flower.

I make a proclamation against Love, the wild boy.
For now, just now, he went away early in the morning, flying from his bed.
The boy is, with sweet tears, ever talking, quick, fearless, laughing slyly, with wings on his back, (and) bearing a quiver.
But from what father he is, I cannot tell.
For neither the Air, nor Earth, nor Sea, say that they begat the daring (urchin).
For he is hated in every way by all.
But look to him, lest some­ how he place other1 nets upon your souls.
And yet, behold, he is about his lair.
Thou hast not escaped me, archer, concealed in the eyes of Zenophila.
Love, I proclaim, the vagrant child, Who, even now, at dawn of day, Stole from his bed and flew away.
He's wont to weep, as though he smiled, For ever prattling, swift, and daring ;
Laughs with wide mouth and wrinkled nose;
Wing'd on the back, and always bearing A quiver, rattling as he goes.
Unknown the author of his birth;
For Air, 'tis certain, ne'er begot The saucy boy;
and as for Earth And Sea, both swear they own him not.
To all and every where a foe.
But you must look, and keep good watch, Lest he should still around him throw Fresh nets, unwary souls to catch.
Stay, while I yet am speaking, lo ! There, there he sits, like one forbidden;
And did you hope to 'scape me so- In Lesbia's eyes, you truant, hidden.
J.
H.
M.
OYEZ.
Take notice, Love, the runaway, Fled from his bed-chamber at break of day.
The boy is an adept at wheedling, crying;
Talks much, is swift of foot, and given to lying;
Audacious, cunning, and with malice fraught, He laughs at mischief his own wiles have wrought.
With wings for flight equipped;
and for attack, With darts, he bears a quiver on his back.
Who is his father, I could ne'er discover;
Earth, Air, and Sea, alike disown the rover.
He's every body's foe.
Ah, maids, beware;
Youths, too, take heed.
For you he spreads the snare.
But look, can I be wrong ? No.
There I spy The truant archer, hid in Lesbia's eye.

Now the white violet is in bloom;
in bloom too the narcissus;
and in bloom the lily that frequents the hills.
And now Zenophila, loved by friends, amongst flowers a flower in its prime, is in bloom, the sweet rose of Persuasion.
Ye meadows, why do ye joyous laugh for your herbage? For the maiden is better than sweet- breathing garlands.
Now the white snowdrop decks the mead ;
The dew-besprent narcissus blows;
And on the flowery mountain's head The wildly scatter'd lily grows.
Each loveliest child of summer throws Its fragrance to the sunny hour;
But Lesbia's opening lips disclose Divine Persuasion's fairer flower.
Meadows, why do ye smile in vain, In robe of green and garlands gay ? When Lesbia moves along the plain, She wears a sweeter charm than they.

See, the snow-flake blossoms gaily;
Blossoms too narcissus dank ;
Blossom all the lilies daily, Straying over mountain-bank.
Nay, but now, the flower of flowers, Fair Zenophile, is seen ;
Sweetest rose-bud from the bowers Of the love-bewitching queen.
Meadows, vain your sunny smiles On those tresses bright to wear;
For the maid hath mightier wiles Than the wreaths that scent the air.

SHEPHERD.
Now the white violets bloom, now bloom the flowers, The hyacinths that delight in dewy showers;
Now bloom hill-loving lilies, and the rose, Love's and Persuasion's flower, in blushing sweetness glows.
Zenophile, thou heart enslaver, say, Why laugh the meads in all that vain array Of beauty ? since my girl is lovelier far, Than sweetly-breathing garlands ever are.
HAY.
The goblet is pleasant and glad.
It says it touches the sweetly-prattling mouth of Zenophila, dear to Love.
Happy is it.
I wish she would place her lips to my lips, and without drawing breath drink out the soul that is in me.
Blest is the goblet, oh! how blest, Which Heliodora's lips have prest.
Oh! might thy lips but meet with mine, My soul should melt away in thine.

Let him be sold, even while slumbering on his mo­ ther's breast.
Let him be sold.
Why should I bring up this bold thing ? For he is naturally with a.
sly leer, and wings under him;
and he scratches the surface (of the skin) with his nails, and in the midst of weeping fre­ quently laughs ;
and still in addition he is not to be turned aside;
ever prattling;
keen-looking, wild, and not tamed even by his dear mother;
(and) is in every respect a prodigy.
He shall therefore be sold.
If any trader, sailing away, wishes to buy the boy, let him come forward.
And yet, see, he is supplicating, bathed in tears.
I will not sell you.
Be of good cheer.
Remain here a fellow-boarder with Zenophila.
Sell him, whilst on his mother's breast He gently sinks in placid rest.
Sell him.
Why should I keep a child So bold, so graceless, and so wild ? How broad his nose ! how keen his eyes ! And now he laughs, and now he cries ;
With fluttering wings and active nails He every mortal wight assails.
The prattling rogue's so bent on riot, His mother cannot keep him quiet.
Sell him.
Who 'U buy the infant slave, And bear him cross the wintry wave ? But, see, he prays with flowing tears.
I will not sell thee.
Calm thy fears.
With me, dear boy, thou still shalt stay, And with thy lovely mistress play.
SHEPHERD.
Within my heart has Love himself moulded the sweetly-prattling Heliodora, a soul (within) a soul.
Pour into (the cup) and speak again and again of Heliodora;
speak;
mingle her sweet name with un­ mixed (wine);
and place around me, wetted with oint ments, and being (a reveller) yesterday, a garland in remembrance of her.
See, the rose, loved by lovers, weeps, because it beholds her elsewhere and not in ray bosom.
Fill high the goblet;
fill it up ;
With Lesbians name divine Thrice utter'd crown the sparkling cup, And sweeten all the wine.
Tie round my brows the rosy wreath, Which yesterday we wove With flowers that yet of odours breathe, In memory of my love.
See how yon rose in tears is drest, Her lovely form to see No longer folded on my breast, As it was wont to be.

Fill-give the health-once more, once more- Mix Heliodora's name with wine ;
The ruby juice untemper'd pour, And round my brow the garland twine ;
Memorial of the gift it blooms With flowers that yesterday o'ertopp'd their stems ;
But now, dipped moist in new perfumes, Shed odour drops from their anointed gems.
Lo ! the rose weeps, the lover-loving flower, To see the nymph away, who shared my bower.
ELTON,I will twine the white violet;
I will twine the tender narcissus with myrtles;
I will twine also the laughing lilies.
I will twine too the sweet crozus;
and I will twine, in addition, the purple hyacinth;
and I will twine the roses, loved by lovers;
in order that on the temples of Heliodora with perfumed locks a gar­ land may throw flowers on her hair with beautiful ringlets.
I '11 wreathe white violets ;
with the myrtle shade Bind soft narcissus ;
and amidst them braid The laughing lily ;
with whose virgin hue Shall blend bright crocus, and the hyacinth blue.
There many a rose shall interwoven shed Its blushing grace on Heliodora's head, And add fresh fragrance, amorously entwining Her clustered locks, with spicy ointments shining.

I '11 twine white violets, and the myrtle green;

By Love, I would rather hear the voice of Heliodora close to my ears, than the harp of the son of Latona.
Dear Jenny Lind ! I'd rather hear you sing, Than Paganini fiddle “on one string.

O bee, living amongst flowers, why touch the skin of Heliodora, and leave the buds just expanded in the spring ? Surely you point out that it is both sweet, and possesses ever the bitter sting of love, to be with diffi­ culty endured by the heart.
Yes, I think, you have said so.
Go then, loved by lovers, with your foot back again.
We have known of old your tidings.
Wandering bee, who lov'st to dwell In the vernal rose-bud's cell, Wherefore leave thy place of rest, To light on Heliodora's breast ? Is it thus you mean to show, When flies the shaft from Cupid's bow, What a sweet and bitter smart It leaves within the wounded heart ? Yes, thou friend to lovers, yes, I thy meaning well can guess :
'Tis a truth too soon we learn ;
Go ;
with thy lesson home return.
J.

M.
Little bee, on blossoms faring, Why neglect the spring to seek ? Why to settle art thou daring On my Heliodora's cheek ? Is it, thou art me assuring Love has something sweet to bring, But withal, past heart's enduring, Leaves a bitter in his sting.
Yes, I ween, this was your presage ;
Get thee hence, thou lover's friend ;
Long ago I've known your message ;
Hence begone, I cannot mend.

Thou vocal Tettix, drunk with drops of dew, thou singest the Muse, that lives in the country, and prattles in the desert;
and sitting with thy serrated limbs on the tops of petals, thou givest out the melody of the lyre with thy dusky skin.
Come then, friend, and speak some new playful thing to the Wood-Nymphs, and chirrup a strain responsive to Pan, in order that, after flying from Love, I may find mid-day slumber here, reclining under a shady plane-tree.
Oh! shrill-voiced insect, that with dew-drops sweet Inebriate, dost in desert woodland sing, Perch'd on the spray-top with indented feet, Thy dusky body's echoings, harp-like, ring.
Come, dear Cicada, chirp to all the grove, The Nymphs and Pan, a new responsive strain, That I, in noon-day sleep, may steal from Love, Reclined beneath the dark o'erspreading plane.
ELTON.
Tipsy with dew-drops, through the desert shrill, Noisy Cicada, thou thy strain dost trill;
And from thy dusky sides with jagged feet, Perch'd on an air-hung spray, draw'st music sweet.
With some new chirrup, friend, the Dryads cheer, Rival to Pan's, some carol bid them hear;
That 'scaped from Love, secure at noon-tide laid, I may woo slumber 'neath the plane-tree's shade.

Loud-sounding grasshopper,'tis thine, with dew-drops drunk, to fill The speaking solitudes afar, with thy rural notes so shrill;
Thou sitt'st on high, and ne'er thy feet, broad, flat, and saw-like, tire In striking from thy dusky wings clear notes, as from a lyre;
Come then, some new and sportive song, to the Wood- Nymphs now essay, Thou loved one, while thy rival Pan gives back th'alternate lay;
That Love may for a while forbear to pierce this heart of mine, While I, in quest of noon-tide sleep, in the plane-tree's shade recline.
HAT.
Fill'd with the morning's roseate dew, thy song I heard along the solitary hills Resounding, and the lonely crags, far off From haunts of men.
For thou the leafy shade Lovest, and woodland solitudes ;
there best Thy lyre attuning, and with joyous feet Striking thy wings sonorous.
For my sake Sing to the Nymphs, who haunt the forest glades;
Sweet insect-warbler, sing another song, Pan's own pipe rivalling;
and sing for me, That, flying Love importunate, in peace My noon-day slumbers I may take, stretch'd out In some cool grot, or where the streamlet winds Beneath yon Platane's broad incumbent shade.

a thou cricket, that cheatest me of my regrets, the soother of slumber ! a thou cricket, that art the Muse of the ploughed fields, and art with shrill wings the self-formed imitation of the lyre, chirrup me something pleasant, while beating your vocal wings with your feet.
How I wish you would, a cricket, release me from the troubles of much sleepless care, weaving the thread of a voice, that causes Love to wander away.
And I will give you for morning-gifts leek ever bloom­ ing, and drops of dew cut up for thy mouth.
Thou locust, soother of my love, whose music slumber brings- Thou locust, minstrel of the fields, endowed with shrilly wings- Thou artless mimic of the lyre, some song of beauty sing, By striking with thy pliant feet each music-speaking wing.
Thou locust, trill me from thy chords a love-releasing strain, That thus thou may'st remove my care, my ever wakeful pain;
And I'll the evergreens to thee as morning gifts assign, And dew-drops split in parts to fit that little mouth of thine.

The bull himself bellows as a suppliant at thy altar, ethereal Jove, as if about to release1 his soul from death.

Lysippus has moulded the daring and the whole form of Alexander.
What meaning has this brass here ? He in brass is, while looking up to Jupiter, like to a person about to say-“ I place the Earth under me;
do you, Jupiter, keep Olympus.
"What power, Lysippus, hath thy bronze ! The conqueror's daring mien And Alexander's glorious self Embodied here is seen.
The living metal seems to say, With eyes uplift to Jove- Mine are the realms of earth below ;

Such was Milo, when he lifted up from the earth as a weight a four-year-old heifer at a feast sacred to Jove;
and carried on his shoulders the monstrous ani­ mal, as if it were a young lamb, easily through the whole public meeting.
This was a wonder.
But he performed a still greater wonder than this, 0 stranger, when present at the sacrificial festival at Pisa.
For the bull, with which, not as yet put under the yoke, he had made a procession, he cut up for its flesh, and ate all of it alone.
Give me a cup, made of the clay, from which I came, and under which I shall lie when dead.

Tell me, was he not' beautiful ? or have I (Pan) 2 become 3 a goat, not only in my legs, but still more in my heart ?I fell in love with Demo of a Paphian family.
It is no great wonder.
And secondly with Demo of Samos.
This is no great thing.
And thirdly, again, with Demo of Ionia.
Are not all these playthings ? And fourthly with Demo of Argolis.
Surely the Fates themselves have named me Philo-Demus (Demo-loving);

Not yet is thy summer naked of buds, nor has the grape, which first shows forth the beauties of a maiden, become dark;

Let us fly, who are ill in love, while the arrow is not yet on the string.
I am the fore­ teller of a great conflagration shortly.
Not yet the blossoms of the spring decay'd, Nor full the swelling treasures of the vine ;

Artemidorus has given us cabbage, Aristarchus pickled fish, and Athenagoras little bulbous roots;
Philodemus, a small hearty Apollophanes, two minae worth of pork;
and there were still three from yester­ day.
Eggs, and garlands, and sandals,2 and myrrh take from us, boy;
I am willing to come at the tenth 4 hour.
0 Melicerta, the daughter of Ino, and thou, Leu­ cothoë with blue eyes, who rulest the main, a deity warding off evil, and ye choirs of Nereids, and ye waves, and thou Neptune, and thou Thracian Zephyr, the mild­ est of winds, propitiously carry me, while escaping over the wide wave, safe to the sweet land of the Peiræus.
The stone contains three immortals.
For the head marks correctly Pan, with goat's horns;

Do not any longer, stranger, refuse to sacrifice.
For of one sacrifice do we three gods partake.
There is already the rose, and the chick-pea in its prime, and the stalks of the first-cut cabbage, Sosylus;
and 1 the shining mæne,1 and the salt-cheese lately prest, and the delicate-grown 2 leaves of the crisp lettuce.
But we do not go to the sea-shore;

To-morrow to a slender nest-like hut does a muse­ loving friend draw thee, dearest Peison, at the ninth hour, when celebrating his twentieth birthday.
But should you miss the teats (of a sow),4 and the quaffing of wine, produced at Chios, still will you see very true friends;
still will you hear strains more mellifluous than those in the land of the Phæacians.
5 But if you will turn your eyes upon us, Peison, we will cele­ brate our twentieth (birthday) rather richly instead of frugally.
To-morrow, Piso, at the evening hour, Thy friend will lead thee to his simple bower, To keep with feast our annual twentieth night;
If there you miss the flask of Chian wine, ;
Yet hearty friends you '11 meet, and while you dine, Hear strains like those in which the gods delight;
And if you kindly look on us the while, We'll reap a richer banquet from thy smile.

It is of brass;
but see what boldness of a boar has the modeller produced, while giving a form to a breathing wild beast, that bristles with the hairs on its neck, gnashes with its sharpened tusk, sends from its eyes a terrible brilliancy, (and) has its lips moistened with foam.
It is no wonder that it destroyed a select host of young men.
1'Tis bronze;
but mark with what fierce prowess fired, By cunning hands, and with what life inspired.
Erect his bristles stand;
his tusks for fight He gnashes, and his eyes flash horrid light;
All bathed his lips in foam.
Heroes, no more We marvel, that ye fell by such a boar.

On this wave-beaten rock did sailors place me, Pria­ pus, as the guardian of the Thracian Bosporus;
to whom, when calling upon me, I have frequently come as a quick helper, 0 stranger, bringing the pleasant Zephyr down on the stern.
Wherefore, as is right, you shall behold my altar not without the steam of fat, nor wanting the garlands of the spring, but ever with frankincense and the fire of sacrifice.
And yet not even an hecatomb so pleases1 the deities, as does a slight honour.
I, Priapus, little to look upon, am dwelling upon a spur of land on the sea-shore, with a life not the least hostile to sea-birds, with a pointed head, without feet, such as the sons of hard-labouring fishermen would have carved on desert strands.
But if any person, fishing with a basket or a rod, shall call upon me to assist, I come quicker than the wind, and I behold what is run­ ning2 under the water.
Truly the deities have a charac­ ter from their acts, not their form.
The (horse called) Eaglet who formerly shone (in glory) more than the steeds, whose feet are as fleet as hurricanes-who formerly concealed2 his limbs under (costly) trappings3-whom the oracle-singing Pytho crowned as the prize of Phœbus, when it started, like a bird, swift on wing, and Nemea, the nurse of the grim lion,4 and Pisa, and the Isthmus, that has a doubled sea- shore,5 is now fettered in his neck by a clog, as if it were a rein, and grinds6 with a rugged stone the fruit of Ceres, enduring a fate equal to that of Hercules;
for he, after having accomplished deeds so many, fitted himself to a slavish yoke.
I, 0 man,7 who carried away the crown at the Al­ phéus8—I, who was formerly twice proclaimed (victor) at the water of Castalia—I, who was formerly bruited at Nemea—I, formerly the (race)-horse at the Isthmus—I, who formerly ran equal to the winged winds—am now, when become old, turning round, as you see the stone that runs in a circle, (and) 9am driven along, the inso­ lence of crowns.
9Beside Alpheus victor I was named, And by Castalia's waters twice proclaimed;
Known to the Nemean and Isthmian course;
Not the wing'd wind could match the favourite horse ;
Now, in my age, I turn this circling stone, And shame the glory of each youthful crown.

Thou, 0 swallow, who hast flown through the whole of the earth and islands, art bringing up thy young in the picture-frame of a painted Medea;
and dost thou expect that this Colchian will keep any faith with thy young ones, who did not spare even her own children ?Thou sielie fowle, what means this foolish paine, To flie to Colche to hatch thy chickins there ? A mother thou mayst hap returne again;
Medea will destroy thy broode, I feare.
For she, that spared not to spoil hir owne, Will she stand friend to fowles, that are unknowne ? TUBERVILLE.
Although I lie here, Mycéné, the dust of a desert, and although I am more obscure to the sight than every hillock, yet any one, who has looked upon the renowned city of Ilus, whose walls I have trodden down, and made empty every dwelling of Priam, will know from thence how strong I was formerly;
and though old age has exposed me to insult, I am satisfied with Mæonides (Homer) as a witness (in my favour).
The diviners by stars say I shall breathe (live) for thrice ten and twice three (years).
But for me even the third decad is sufficient.
For this is the limit of the life of man.

Erinna;
the renowned Telesilla;
and thee, Corinna, who sang the martial shield of Athéné ;
the sweet-tongued2 Nossis;
and Myrtis the sweet-sounding, all workers on the pages that flow (live) for ever.
The great Heaven has produced nine Muses ;
and nine, too, the Earth, an unperishing source of delight to mortals.
The Heliconian springs and rocky steeps Of Macedonian Piërus have heard The god-voiced strains of women, and with songs Praxilla nurtured—Myro—Anyté, The female Homer—thee of Lesbian dames Famed for their flowing ringlets—Sappho first In glory-and Erinna—Telesilla, Great in thy growing fame-Corinna, thee- Thee, the bright songstress of the warlike shield, Athena's-Nessis mild and woman voiced-- And gentle Myrtis last-meet makers all On the bright page of ever-living song.
Nine Muses mighty Uranus produced, And nine the Earth-a deathless joy to man.

And though Homer holds the sceptre of song, and Jove is superior to Nep­ tune, yet Neptune, inferior to him, is the (next) highest of the immortals.

O books of Aristophanes, the labour of a god, on which the ivy of Acharnae has shed in abundance its green foliage.
See how much of Bacchus does the page pre­ sent;
and how the tales, filled with austere Graces, send a sound.
Oh thou the best in spirit, and a Comic writer equal to the habits of Greece ! who hast both a hate of, and a laugh against, things worthy (of either).
The plays of Aristophanes ! around that work divine, Th'Acharnian ivy's clustering wreaths in verdant glory twine.
What inspiration in the page! 'Tis Bacchus' self ! What sounds Of graceful poesy, which yet with dreaded wit abounds.

Juno once said, when cut up 1 by the beauty of Gany­ mede, and having in her heart the soul-eating sting of jealousy, " Troy has produced a male flame for Jupiter;
therefore will I send a flame against Troy, (namely,) Paris the bringer of calamity;
and there shall come to the peo­ ple of Ilium not an eaglet but vultures, to a feast, when the Greeks shall take away the spoils of their labours.
"I will snatch, Love, the burning torch from your hand, and I will rob you of the quiver that hangs about your shoulders, if you, the offspring of fire, are really asleep, and if we mortals have for a little time rest from your arrows.
But even thus I fear yon, the plotter of craft, lest you should conceal3 some things against me, and see even in sleep an unpleasant dream.

When the hand of Timomachus was painting the mur­ derous Medea, drawn in opposite directions by jealousy and (love for) her children, it undertook an endless task, that it might trace a twofold conduct, one inclining to anger, the other to pity.
But it fulfilled both.
Look on the form.
Amidst the threat there is a tear, and in the midst of pity passion holds a place.
" The delay is sufficient," said a wise man.
The blood of children was becoming to Medea, but not to the hand of Timomachus.
When bold Timomachus essay'd to trace The soul's emotions in the varying face, With patient thought and faithful hand he strove To blend with jealous rage maternal love.
Behold Medea.
Envy must confess, In both the passions, his complete success.
Tears in each threat;
a threat in every tear;
The mind with pity warm, or chill with fear.

In addition to all his labours, Juno wished this the last, namely, to see the daring Hercules deprived of arms.
Where is the lion's cloak, and the arrow that rattled on his shoulders, and the branch of a tree with its heavy foot, that was the wild-beast destroyer ? Of all has Love stript thee.
And yet it is not strange, that, after making Jupiter a swan, he has despoiled Hercules of arms.
Each toil attempted, and each toil surpast, Juno reserved this labour for the last.
Spoil'd of his arms she wished him ;

No more Alcides, formidably drest, Arms with the lion's skin his milder breast;
His winged quiver seems an useless freight;
Nor feels he of his club the force, but weight.

When Venus came out naked from the azure wave, her hair dropping with the foam of the sea, thus did she lay hold with her hands of the ringlets hanging down her white cheeks, and squeeze out the salt-water of the Ægean, showing only her bosom-for such was lawful.

Thou, that bringest sleepless cares upon mortals, art sleeping, the child of the mischievous2 foam-begotten (Venus);
not lifting up the burning torch, nor twanging the arrow not-to-be-guarded-against, from the horn­ tips, bent in opposite directions.
Let others feel conn­ dent ;
but I fear, 0 thou proud in spirit, lest thou see, while sleeping, a dream bitter to myself.
Do.
-it thou, that bid'st us mortals wake to weep, Fell child of foam-born Venus, dost thou sleep ? No flaming torch thou hold'st up;
on thy string No fatal arrow now is quivering.
Others may courage take.

Why hast thou, bird, taken away my pleasant sleep ? The sweet vision of Pyrrha has gone away flying from my bed.
Is this the payment thou givest for thy bring­ ing up, since I placed thee, ill-fated one, to rule over the whole egg-getting flock in my dwelling.
By the altar and sceptre of Sarapis, thou shalt no longer crow by night;
thou shalt stain with blood the altar, by which I have sworn.
Whilst I was once turning over the book of Hesiod in my hands, I saw on a sudden Pyrrha coming to me.
And throwing down the book on the ground with my hand, I bawled out these words—“ Why art thou, old Hesiod, giving me trouble ?”Of late perusing Hesiod's " Works and Days," Advancing, Pyrrha met my raptur'd gaze;
I dropped the book, and cried for all to hear­ " Hence with thy works o' days, when Pyrrha's near.

Thou flagon, my old partner at supper, the lover of the tapster's measures, thou pretty prattler, with a gentle smile and a long throat, thou sharer in the mysteries of my poverty at a small expense, thou hast come, however, after a long time to my hand.
Would thou hadst been present, unmixed and unwatered,1 as a maiden, who comes undefiled to her husband.
Thou wilt lie, when dead, occupying five feet (of earth);
nor shalt thou (enjoy) the pleasures of life, nor behold the light of the sun.
So that take thou and drain with joy the cup of genuine Bacchus (wine), 0 Cincius, holding thy very beautiful wife in thy arms.
But if thou hast any notion of immortal wisdom, know that Cleanthes and Zeno have gone to the depths of Hades.
Loosen the long stern cables from the vessels in a safe port, and, after letting out the well-running sails, pass over the sea, 0 trader;
for the storms have gone away, and mildly-smiling Zephyr is just now rendering gentle the blue wave.
And now the offspring-loving swallow is building its marriage-dwelling of mud and dry thatch, while twittering with its lips;
and flowers are springing up on the land;
wherefore do thou, obeying Priapus, lay hold of every kind of a sailing business.
I am revelling, while looking upon the golden dance of the stars in the west, 1nor have I with my heel pressed heavily the dances of others;
1 and after crowning the hair of my head with flowers thrown upon it, I have put into movement the noisy tambourine with tuneful hands;
and in doing so I pass a life, like that of the world;
for the world itself is not without a lyre and a crown.
2Thou wert, 0 pleasant flagon, broken near wine- drinkers, after having poured forth Bromius (wine) from the whole of thy belly;
for a stone with a heavy crash came, like a thunderbolt, from a distance against thee, (sent) not from the hands of Jove, but of Dion.
And there was a laugh against thee and frequent jokes on thy being broken, and a great uproar arose amongst friends.
I do not lament for thee, 0 flagon, that hast produced Bacchus the reveller, since thou and Semelé have suffered equally.
3No longer do thou, 0 blackbird, whistle in the oak;
no longer utter thy notes reposing on the highest bough.
This tree is thy enemy;
but haste thither, where the vine springs up, shaded by its dark-green leaves.
Upon its branch fix thy foot;
and about it sing, pouring forth shrill notes from thy mouth.
For the oak produces the lime-substance, hostile to birds;
but the vine the grape;
and Bacchus loves the trillers of song.
Beautiful are the laurels;
beautiful does the water bubble forth under the roots (of the trees), and the thick wood is shady far and wide, run down1 by the Zephyrs.
To way-farers there is a defence against thirst and toil, and the heat of the sun.
Me Love in return for love did Praxiteles give to Phryné, a god to a mortal, after discovering that even a god was a reward.
Nor did she give a denial to the artist.
For her mind felt a fear, lest the god to should take up arrows, his allies, in the place of art ;
2 and she dreads no longer the child of Venus, but thine, Praxiteles, through knowing that art is its mother.

Who has destroyed thee ? B.
It is Love, the winged, 3who is really singly3 a heavy labour.

Although you boast of your beauty, know that even the rose comes into flower;
and yet, when faded, it is quickly thrown on the dung-heap.
For the flower and beauty obtain by lot an equal time;
and time, through envy, causes them to fade equally.
Where is now Praxiteles ? where are the hands of Polycleitus, that formerly gave breath to art itself? Who shall model the sweet-scented ringlets of Melité, or her eyes of fire, and the brilliancy of her neck ? Where are the moulders? where the stone-cutters? It were be­ coming for such a form to have a temple, like a statue of the blessed (gods).
I send to thee, my Rhodocle, this wreath entwined with flowers, Which I with mine own hands have newly cull'd among the bowers :
The lily and the rose, and that sweet bud that woos the wind, With the violet and dew-besprinkled daffodil combined.
When then the chaplet shades thy brow, cast haughty looks away ;
For thy beauty, blooming like the flowers, will like the flowers decay.

Since, like thyself, the flowers that crown thy brow, Bloom for awhile and die—the flowers and thou.
HAy.
My Rhodoclea! take this flowery band, Which I have fashion'd with my proper hand, Of lilies and of roses, fitly set Amongst narcissi, and anemones wet With dews, and many a purple violet.
But, lady ! wreathe it humbly round thy brow ;
Thou know'st it soon will fade-and so must thou.

A wreath of flowers I send to thee, Woven by myself, my Rhodoclé.
How bright the rose appears Beside the lily ! anemone set Near the narcissus and blue violet, All wet with dewy tears.
Thus, rich with many a living gem, Place on thy head the diadem ;
Thyself a fairer flower By far than all, that blended bloom.
But be not proud;
'tis Beauty's doom To wither in an hour.

Let us, Prodice, wash and deck ourselves with gar­ lands, and quaff the wine unmixed, and take still larger glasses.
Short is the life of those in joy ;
then to what remains old age puts a stop, and lastly death.
Now as we rise from the reviving wave, Braid we our locks, my Prodice, with flowers ;
Drain we deep bowls of wine, and wisely save From slow-paced Care Youth's transitory hours.
For withering Age upon our path attends ;
Joys drop by joys, and Death the picture ends.

nor shall he conquer while one is against one;
and I a mortal will stand up with an immortal.

If Bacchus fight on Cupid's side, 'Tis surely no disgrace to yield.

With love I war, and reason is my shield, Nor ever, matched thus equally, will yield :
If Bacchus joins his aid, too great the odds;
One mortal cannot combat two such gods.

The Queen of heaven's bright eyes illume thy face;
Great Pallas lends thine arms her polished grace;
Thetis thine ancle's slender strength bestows, And Venus in thy swelling bosom glows.

Who listens to thy melting voice, thrice blest;
Almost a god, whose love is met by thine ;

Having seen opportunely Prodicé alone, I became a suppliant, and, touching her ambrosial knee, said, " Save a man lost all but a little, and give me the breath of life, which is escaping.
" And, on my saying so, she wept;
but after wiping away the tear, she secretly with her de­ licate hands cast me out.
When blest I met my Prodice alone, On the cold earth a timid suppliant thrown, I clasped her beauteous knees, and bade her save A wretch, at her disposal, from the grave.
Listening she wept.

Who, and from whence art thou, Dionysus ? For, by the genuine Bacchus, 1I know thee not at all.
1 The son of Jove I know alone.
He smells of nectar, but thou of a goat.
Surely Celts, in their poverty of grapes, have formed thee of grain.
Hence it is meet to call thee 1 Demetrius, not Dionysus;
and Bromus, born of grain, not Bromius,1 (of grapes).
The women jeer at me as an old man, telling me to look at the remains of youth in a mirror.
But, whether I carry white hairs or black, I care not, when coming towards the end of life;
but I put a stop to annoying cares by sweet-scented myrrh, and garlands with beau­ tiful leaves.
The laughing women call me old, And bid me in the glass behold The ruins of my former state ;
But let the locks my temples bear Be gray or black, I little care, And leave it to the will of Fate.
Yet this I know ;
though Nature's call Subjects me to the lot of all, Still, as my ebbing days decline, I '11 make the most of my short hours, Be bathed in odours, crowned with flowers, And drown old care in floods of wine.

Let us, Pieridés, fly the well-inhabited city ;
let us seek another country.
I proclaim to all that destruc­ tive drones have done a hurt to the bees.
Would that my sire had taught his son to keep, 'Neath sheltering rocks or elms, the fleecy sheep;
To seek the solace of dull care and grief In the pipe's music, and there find relief.
Ye Muses, come ;
together let us flee The well-built city's splendid misery;
Seek we another home to sing at ease;
For here the wretched drones destroy the bees.

Maria, an object of desire, makes much of herself.
But may you, venerable Justice, follow up her proud bearing;
not with death, 0 queen, but the reverse, may she arrive at the hairs of old age ;
and may her counte­ nance become hard with wrinkles.
May gray locks pay for these tears.
May beauty, the cause of sinning, pay for the sinning of the mind.
You see the true form of the wretched Niobé, as if still lamenting the fate of her children.
If (the statue) has not obtained a soul, lay not this blame to the art.
It has represented the womanly feeling in stone.
When Timomachus painted Medea, he introduced into the likeness the twofold feelings of a form without life.
For he combined the jealousy felt on account of a bed, and the love at the same time for her children, and showed by her looks that she was drawn in opposite directions.
Love once washed his Cyprian mother in this bath, after having himself secretly warmed the beautiful water with his torch.
And when sweat had poured from her ambrosial skin, mixed with the clear water, 1 how great a spring of breath did it light up.
1 From thence they ever 2 boil up a rose-like vapour,2 as if the golden Pa­ phian (Venus) was still being washed.
As in this fount Love wash'd the Cyprian dame, His torch the water tinged with subtle flame ;
And, while his busy hands his mother lave, Ambrosial dews enrich the silver wave, And all the undulating bosom fill ;
Such dews did her celestial limbs distil.
Hence how delicious float these tepid streams ! What rosy odours! what nectareous steams ! So pure the water and so soft the air, It seems as if the goddess still were there.

Here, under the plane-trees, did Love, when tired.
sleep in a gentle slumber, after handing over his torch to the Nymphs ;
and the Nymphs said to one another- Why do we hesitate ? 1 Would we had extinguished to­ gether with him the fire of the heart of mortals—1 But when the torch had burnt even the water, the Nymphs, presiding over Loves, poured from thence into a bath warm water.
The little Love-god, lying once asleep, Laid by his side his heart, in flaming brand, Whilst many Nymphs, that vow'd chaste life to keep, Game tripping by ;
but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire, Which many legions of true hearts had warmed ;
And so the General of hot desire Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by, Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual, Growing a bath, and healthful remedy For fileD diseased.
But I, my mistress' thrall, Came there for cure ;
and this by that I prove, Love's fire heats water ;
water cools not love.

And if she had burst forth into voice with the loud tone of tragedy, she would have fashioned the swell of Melpomené.

But when the dawn of morning comes, gratifying me so that I can have a little respite, swallows twitter round, and throw me into tears, by driving off a sweet and heavy sleep;

Cease, ye envious chatterers;
for I did not cut out the tongue of Philomela;
and do ye lament Itylus on hills, and moan while sitting at the old dwelling of Epops, so that I may sleep a little;
and perhaps a dream will come, that shall throw me into the arms of Rhodanthe.
All night I sigh with cares of love opprest;
But when the morn indulges balmy rest, These twittering birds their noisy matins keep, Recall my sorrows and prevent my sleep.
Cease, envious birds, your plaintive tales to tell, I ravished not the tongue of Philomel.
In deserts wild, or on some mountain's brow, Pay all the tributary grief you owe To Itys in an elegy of woe.
Me leave to sleep ;
in visionary charms Some dream may bring Rhodanthé to my arms.

The live-long night I moan;
but when the morn Would visit with short sleep mine eyes forlorn, The swallows twitter round, above, below;
And from my jaded lids the tear-drops flow, And orbs wet-dropping keep the watch of woe.
And then again before my heart is brought Rhodanthé’s image in tumultuous thought.
Ill-natured babblers, cease.
Who ever said I tore the tongue from Philomela's head ? Go to the hills, and Itylus bemoan, Or sitting on the Hoopoe's rugged throne, Speak out your sorrows, that of ease a gleam May on me fall;
when, should there come a dream, I in Rhodanthe's arms enclasp'd may seem.

For if thou shalt touch it with thy lips, it is not easy to be sober, nor to escape from the sweet cup-bearer.
For the cup conveys to me a kiss from thee, and it tells me the pleasure it has received.
Farewell to wine ! or, if thou bid'st me sip, Present the cup, more honoured, from thy lip.
Pour'd by thy hand, to rosy draughts I fly, And cast away my dull sobriety.
For, as I drink, soft raptures tell my soul, That lovely Glycera has kiss'd the bowl.

For how is the soul able to be mad with love, that reasons correctly ?Do you too, Philinna, suffer from desire ? Are you too ill, wasted away with eyes dried up ? Or do you enjoy slumber most sweet, while of my cares no account or number is taken ? Perhaps you will find an equal fate;
and I shall behold the cheek of you unenvied, moistened with many tears.
For Venus is in other re­ spects of an ill-temper;
but she has obtained by lot one good thing, to hate women who give themselves airs.
Hastening to know whether Ereutho with beautiful eyes loved me, I tried her heart with a fiction of a profitable kind.
I shall go,1 (said I,) to a foreign land ;
but do you remain a steady girl, and preserve the remembrance of my love.
When she grieved greatly and was excited, and struck 2 her own face, and tore the grape-like (knot) of her well-plaited hair, and begged me to stay.
And I, as a person slow of persuasion, ex­ pressed by a nod, with a face full of airs, that I would stay.
3 (And) happy am I in my love.
For that which I was eager to accomplish by all means, conceded as5 a great favour.
In wayward mood by artifice I strove To try the fervour of my Helen's love :
And, " Oh farewell, my dearest girl," I cried, " Forget me not, when seas and lands divide.
" Pale at the news, she wept, and in despair Her forehead struck, and tore her silken hair ;
And sigh'd, " Forsake me not.
" By sorrow prest I nod compliance with her fond request;
I yield by generous selfishness inspired, And hardly grant her what I most desired.
BL.
I long'd to try Ereutho's heart, If me alone she loved, And by a sleight of crafty art My doubts I thus removed.
" I go to foreign lands," I said, " Be constant aye to me ;
And ne'er forget, my lovely maid, The love I bear to thee.
" She started, shriek'd, her forehead smote, And her locks of clustering hair She scatter'd, and—“ Oh ! leave me not," She cried with frantic air.
Then I, like one full loth to brook Entreaty, answer’d—“Nay ;
” But yet my faltering, down-cast look Declared that I would stay.
How happy is my love! since she Should thankfully receive, What was to happy, happy me, The greatest bliss to give.

“ Nothing too much "-a wise man said ;
but I, being an object of love, and beautiful, was lifted up by my high thoughts, and I fancied that in my hands lay the whole life of the maiden, who was perchance gainful.
2 But sie was lifted up still more, and held up her haughty eye-brow, as if finding fault with her former conduct.
And now I, who was the stern-looking, the iron- (hearted), the slowly-persuaded, the former flyer in the air, fell on a sudden, and all things have become changed;
and falling at the knees of the maiden, I cried out—“ Be kind-hearted;
it was my youth that erred.
"There is not so great a labour to young men, as there comes upon us females with a tender soul.
For to them there are equals in age, to whom they tell the anguish of cares with the language of confidence, and they attend to pastimes that soothe them, and they wander in the streets, lounging amongst coloured pic­ tures.
But for us it is not lawful to look even upon the light of day;
and we are hidden in the house, wasted away with dark thoughts.
Go, idle, amorous boys ;
What are your cares and joys, To love that swells the longing virgin's breast ? A flame half-hid in doubt, Soon kindled, soon burnt out, A blaze of momentary heat at best.
Haply you well may find, Proud privilege of your kind, Some friend to share the secret of your heart;
Or, if your inbred grief Admit of much relief, The dance, the chase, the play assuage your smart.
Whilst we poor hapless maids, Condemned to pine in shades, And to our dearest friends our thoughts deny, Can only sit and weep, While all around us sleep, Unpitied languish, and unheeded die.

For comrades of cheery speech have they, To blandish the woes of thought away ;
With games they can cheat the hours at home ;

But as for us poor prisoned elves, We are shut out from sunlight, buried in rooms, And fretted away by our fancy's glooms.

But as far as one may understand from the eye of a person enraged, he is giving this1 order—“ Say no more what is not right.
"Is your reed, 0 little satyr, sending forth a sound of its own accord ? Or why have you thus inclined your ear to the reed ? But he smiles and is silent.
Perhaps he would have spoken a word ;
but through his delight he is kept in a state of forgetfulness.
For it is not the wax (of the picture) that prevents him.
But he willingly loves silence, while delighting 3 his whole soul by being en­ gaged on the instrument.
Yield to me,4 thou holy hill-top of Daphne, that liest away from the sea, the beauty of a desert spot where rustics dwell.
For here are Nymphs, that pre­ side over trees, and the Nereids have made their common place of meeting near the sea.
For they have contended about me.
And (Neptune) the god with azure hair has acted as judge, and placed me as a boundary between both.
O city, where are thy famous5 walls ? Where the temples of much wealth? Where the heads of the slaughtered oxen? Where the myrrh-boxes of the Paphian (Venus) ? and her upper garment all gold ? and where the image of the indigenous 1 Triton-born (Pallas) ? All hath the bustle (of War), and the flow of Time, and powerful Fate seized upon, throwing round thee a strange kind of misfortune.
And so much has grievous Envy subdued thee;
but thy name alone 2 and glory it is not able to hide.
O city, where are those walls of thine, And thy temples rich with slaughtered kine ? And where are the perfumes, the vest of gold, That the Paphian queen adorn ? And where the image, thou hadst of old, Of thy native Triton-born ? The toils of War, and the ruins of Time, and the might of Destiny, Have seized on all, and brought in their stead far different hap to thee.
Thus far bitter Envy bath conquer'd thee.
But alone survives thy name;
And Envy itself shall conquered be ;
For it cannot hide thy fame.
\ E.
S.
Where, hapless city, are thy walls renown'd ? Where in rich temples heads of victim'd kine ? Where the rose ointments for thy Venus found ? And where her vest, that once all gold did shine ? And where the likeness of the Triton-born In tapestry woven ? All hath War and Strife, And flow of Time, and strong Fate from thee torn, And round thee thrown a stranger's lot and life.
Thee hostile Envy has overcome.
Thy name And glory it can't hide, that still remain.

If thou art descended from Sparta, stranger, do not laugh:
for not upon me alone has Misfortune brought this to pass.
But if from Asia, do not weep :
for all the city of the sons of Æneas has nodded by Dardan sceptres.
But though the envious war of hostile (bands) has made empty the holy groves of the gods, and my walls, and the dwellers therein, I am again a queen;
and do you, 0 fearless Rome, my child, place upon the Greeks the yoke-harness of thy justice.
Nature, herself the modeller, has given to you, 0 painter, the power to represent the Pierian (Muse) of Mitylené.
The transparency of her eyes is like that of a fountain, and this clearly marks a fancy full of a suc­ cessful aiming;
and the flesh, which is naturally smooth and not laboriously luxuriant,2 has the ease (of style) portrayed by it;
and from her countenance, mixed up with what is joyous and intellectual, she proclaims a Muse united to Venus.
Nature herself this magic portrait drew, And, painter, gave thy Lesbian Muse to view.
Light sparkles in her eyes ;
and Fancy seems The radiant fountain of those living beams ;
Through the smooth fulness of the unclouded skin, Looks out the clear ingenuous soul within.
Joy melts to fondness in her glistening face, And Love and Music breathe a mingled grace.

Neither is the rose in need of a garland, nor art thou, adorable maiden, of an outer garment, nor a head-dress set with precious stones.
Gems fade before thy colour;
nor does gold impart splendour, when thy hair is not to be combed.
1 The Indian hyacinth possesses the beauty of a dark splendour, but far inferior to thine eyes ;
and thy dewy lips, and the honey-mingled harmony of manners is the cestus of the Paphian (Venus).
By all these I am subdued ;
by the eyes alone am I soothed, in which there dwells honey-dropping hope.
We ask no flowers to crown the blushing rose, Nor glittering gems thy beauteous form to deck.
The pearl, in Persia's precious gulf that glows, Yields to the dazzling whiteness of thy neck.
Gold adds not to the lustre of thy hair, But, vanquished, sheds a fainter radiance there.
The Indian hyacinth's celestial hue Shrinks from the bright effulgence of thine eye, The Paphian cestus bathed thy lips in dew, And gave thy form ambrosial harmony.
My soul would perish in the melting gaze, But for thine eyes, where hope for ever plays.
BL.
No garland needs the rose ;
nor thou, my fair, That gem-bespangled net-work for thy hair.
On thee that robe is but an useless cost, Who art, " when unadorned, adorned the most.
" Thy skin bedims the pearl;
and dim the glare Of gold beside thy wild luxuriant hair.
The Indian gem its flaming grace may prize, But pale its lustre when before thine eyes.
Thy dewy lips, harmonious form and soul, Honey'd as Venus' zone, thy perfect whole, Overwhelm me all;
thine eyes alone, my fair, In their soft language bid me not despair.
HAY.
No wreath the rose doth need to grace her brow;
No broider'd robe nor jewell'd head-dress thou.
Not whitest pearl can with thy skin compare, Nor gold so bright as thy loose flowing hair.
The loveliest hyacinth of Indian fields To thy full-beaming pupil's lustre yields.
That dewy lip, that form of melting mould, Thy magic girdle, Venus, here behold.
All these undo me;
only in thine eyes Comfort I find;
there sweet hope ever lies.

From the time when Chariclo, while laughing and talking to me, as I was drinking, put round me her own garland secretly, a destructive fire has been devouring me;
for the garland had, as I fancy, something which burnt up likewise Glaucé, the daughter of Creon.
1Alas ! alas ! Envy wards off the honey-sweet talk, and the look of the eyes, which speak in secrete And stand­ ing near, we are astonished at the look of the old woman, like the many-eyed herdsman (Argos) of (Io), the daughter of Inachus.
Stand thou and keep a look-out;
but in vain vex thy heart.
For thou canst not extend thine eye to the soul.
Chrysis, after plucking a single hair of her golden locks, bound my hands, like those of a war-captive.
And I at first laughed, thinking to shake off easily the chains of my adored Doris.
But when I was unable to burst through them, I gave a groan, as if riveted to a fetter of brass not to be loosened.
And now, thrice- wretched, I am hung by a hair,3 and frequently dragged, wherever my mistress pulls me.
In wanton sport, my Doris from her fair And glossy tresses tore a straggling hair ;
And bound my hands, as if of conquest vain, And I some royal captive in her chain.
At first I laugh’d-“ This fetter, lovely maid, Is lightly worn, and soon dissolved," I said.
I said:
but ah ! I had not learned to prove How strong the fetters that are forged by love.
That little thread of gold, I strove to sever, Was bound, like steel, about my heart for ever;
And from, that luckless hour, my tyrant fair Has led and turned me by a single hair.

I swore I would remain far away from thee, 0 damsel fair, to the twelfth morning, ye gods.
But I, wretched, could not endure it;
for the morrow seemed to me, I swear by thyself, more distant than the twelfth moon.
But beg, my dear, of the gods not to engrave these oaths on the back of the page - of the Furies ;
and do thou soothe my mind by thy favours, lest the whip2 of the blessed (gods) cause a wheal upon thee, 0 adored one.
When I left thee, love, I swore Not to see that face again For a fortnight's space or more ;
But the cruel oath was vain ;
Since the next day I spent from thee, Was a long year of misery.
Oh, then, for thy lover pray Every gentler deity, Not in too nice scales to weigh His constrained perjury.
Thou, too, oh pity his despair;
Heaven's rage and thine he cannot bear.

They say that a man, who has been bitten by the maddening poison of a dog, sees the image of a wild beast in water.
And perhaps maddening Love has fixed his sharp fang in me, and by madness despoiled me of my mind.
For thy loved image does the sea present to me, and the eddies of rivers, and the cup of the wine­ bearer.
They say that one, who hath chanced to suffer The venomous bite of a rabid hound, Will see a creature of horrible feature Imaged on all the waters round.
So me hath rabid Cupid bitten, And smitten my soul with his raging bane;
And an image I trace on the river's face, In the glistening wine, on the level main.
But the image which wakens my soul's distress, Is an image of exquisite loveliness.

Cleophantis is delaying long, and the third wick is be­ ginning already to sink down, wasted away slowly.
Would that the lamp of my heart were extinguished with the wick, and that it had not been burning me a long time by sleepless desires.
How often has Hespe­ rus sworn that Venus would come !1 But she has no re­ gard for men or gods.
I, who formerly, with a mind not to be softened, did in my youth disavow the pleasant laws of the madness- producing Paphian (deity)—I, who was formerly not to be approached by the limb-devouring darts of Love, do now bend in middle age my neck to thee, 0 Venus, Receive me with a smile ;
because thou art now a victor overPallas, more than thou wast formerly for the apple of the Hesperides.
The youth, who, with unmitigated mind, Inciting Paphia's gentle sway declined, Who proved so unassailable when blooming, And set at nought Love's arrows, limb-consuming, Now, Cypris, with his wise head frosted over, Bends low to thee his neck, and turns a lover.
Take me and laugh.
Thou thwartest Pallas wise, E'en more than when she lost the Hesperid golden prize.

I, who with heart unsoften'd in my prime, Of Venus, bringing madness, spurn'd the power- I, whom no dart could reach in former time Of Love, the heart-consuming-in the hour Of middle age, to thee my neck I bow, O Cyprian queen ! Laugh, and receive thy slave;
More is thy triumph seen o'er Pallas now, Then when the Hesperian apple glory gave.

Does thine hair a head-dress bind ? With a violent feeling I am wasted away, on beholding the likeness of the tower-bearing Rhea.
Is thy head without a cover­ ing? By the auburn colour of thy tresses, I drive from my breast my mind, that has melted away.
Dost thou conceal thy pendent locks with a white veil ? A fire not less intense lays hold of my heart.
A triad of Graces attend upon thy triple state;
and every state sends forth its own fire.
Being about to say to thee—“ Fare thee well”—I pull back again the voice, so as to return;
and again I remain near thee.
For I shudder at the terrible dis­ tance from thee, as at the bitter night of Acheron.
For thy light is like the day;
but a portion of it is voiceless;
do thou, then, bring the prattling, which is sweeter than the Sirens, and on which all the hopes of my very soul hang.
When T meant, lovely Ida, to bid thee farewell, My faltering voice the sad office denied;
From my lips broken accents of tenderness fell, And I remained motionless close by thy side.
Nor wonder, sweet girl, at the baffled endeavour ;
The pang of the moment, that tears me away, Can only be equaled by that, which for ever Shuts out from my soul the blest prospect of day.
Oh ! Ida, 'tis thou art my day.
'Tis to thee I look for the light, that should make me rejoice ;
Thy presence the day-spring of pleasure's to me ;
But raptures of paradise dwell in thy voice.
Thy voice—oh ! how sweeter than aught that is feign'd Of Sirens or Mermaids, that float on the wave;
It holds all my joys, all my passions enchained, And is able alike to destroy me or save.

The sea washes the seats on the land;
and the back of the land, although sailed over, blooms with groves in the midst of the sea.
How clever was he, who mingled the sea-deeps with the land, and sea-weeds with garden- plants, and the streams of the Nereids with the rills of the Naiads.
This lovely spot old Ocean laves, And woody coverts fringe the waves.
Happy the art, that could dispose Whatever in sea or garden grows, And summoned to the enchanted land The Naiads' and the Nereids' band.

Touch, 0 cup, the mouth dropping with honey;
you have found it;
draw it, like milk;
I do not begrudge you;
but I wish I had your lucky fate.
You have the name of Libanus, the form of the Graces, the manners of Persuasion, 0 damsel, and the cestus of Venus under your loins;
and in dances you frolic, like a light Cupid, drawing to you all (men) by your beauty and art.
The Cytherean (Venus) loved Anchises and the Moon Endymion:
such do the people of the past tell in tales.
But now some new tale will be sung, 1 how that Victory has fallen in love with the looks and the chariot of Porphyrius.
Dionysus, on seeing a satyr, having so great2 a pain, and pitying him, turned him into stone.
But even thus he did not cease from pains hard to be borne.
For still does he suffer, the hapless one, although he is a stone.
Did you, Hippomenes, throw this golden prize to the damsel, as a marriage-gift, or to delay her speed ? The apple has accomplished both purposes;
since it with­ drew the maiden from her rapid movement, and was the symbol of the yoke of Venus.
It was possible to hear clearly Pan playing on the pipe;
for the moulder had mixed up breath with the form.
But (Pan), on seeing Echo flying away, stands1 not knowing what to do, (and) he has refused (to give) the useless voice of the pipe.

That (morrow) is never mine, while your habit of putting off is ever in­ creasing.
In this way alone do you gratify my longing;
but to others you grant other favours, disowning my confidence in you.
A.
At evening I will see thee.
B.
What is a woman's evening ? It is old age filled with wrinkles without measure.
A.
Why is thy sword drawn from the sheath? B.
(I swear) by thyself, maiden, it is that I may not do any act foreign to Venus, but that I may show how Mars, although hot with rage, is obedient to gentle Venus.
This is, while I am in love, my fellow-traveller;
nor do I want a mirror;
2but in it I see myself, how beautiful (I am) in love;
2 yet should you release yourself from me,1 the sword will sink into my side.
A.
Why from its sheath is drawn thy sword ? B.
I swear, By thee, to do no wrong to Love, my fair.
'Tis but to show how Mars, with fury wild, By gentle Venus soften'd, is a child.
While in Love's paths I tread, it sticks to me.
I want no mirror.
Here myself I see.

2 Yet is thy mouth naturally a hook, full of points;
and as soon as I bite, it holds me fast, hanging from thy rosy lip.
2Ruthless to me as death, in sound how fair, Inconstant Constance, is the name you bear! Beloved, you fly;
not courted, you pursue, That you may fly again, when loved anew.

I have not wished for gold and ten thousand cities of the earth, nor what Homer3 says that Thebes possessed;
but that the round cup might bubble with Lyæus (wine), while its lip is washed with an ever-flowing stream, of1 which (cup) the talkative choir of old men have drunk together;
2but the clever men labour, as workers at vines.
2 (May) this loved happiness evei (be) to me in great quantity;
and I care not for the golden Consuls, while I hold fast the flask.
I ask not gold ;
I ask not power;
I never pray'd great Jove to shower On me the wealth that Homer sings, The grandeur of the Theban kings.
I shall be well contented, so My cup with ceaseless bumpers flow, And my moist lips for ever shine In honour of the god of wine, And friends, who share my inmost soul, Share likewise in the fragrant bowl.
But let the grave and dull possess Their toil-won wealth, short happiness.
These are my riches;
these I'll love, As long as I'm allowed by Jove.
For while the sparkling bowl I drain, The boasts of pride and pomp are vain.

MWe, who drink without drawing breath, the com­ batants belonging to king lacchus, will arrange the acts of the carousal, where cups form the fight, and make big libations from the unsparing gifts of the Icarian Lyæus (Bacchus).
To others let the glories of Triptolemus be a care;
where are oxen, and ploughs, and the pole be­ tween the oxen, and the handle (of the plough-share), and the corn-field, and the foot-prints of the snatched away Proserpine.
But if there is ever a necessity to put any food into the mouth, the dried raisin of Bromius ( the vine) is sufficient for wine-drinkers.
By me, who was ill yesterday, there stood a physician, no friendly person, who forbade the nectar of cups;
and told me, the vain fellow, to drink water;
nor had he learnt that Homer says' that wine is the strength of man.
Ye men, to whom the orgies of Bacchus, who is with­ out pain, are a care, through the hopes which the vine produces,2 throw away poverty.
To me let the cup be a crater;
and near me a wine-press, not a keg, the dwell­ ing of smooth-faced joyousness;
and straightway, after drinking a large goblet of our Lyæus (wine) I will fight, if you wish it, with the Canastræan3 youths.
I fear not the sea that is not to be soothed, nor the thunderbolts, while possessing the confident boldness of fearless Bro­ mius.
If hopes, the friends of misfortune, play with the life of mortals, by gratifying the whole of it in a delaying manner, I, since I am a mortal, am played upon, and well do I, a man, know I am mortal.
But being played upon by protracted hopes, I am pleased with myself willingly, although wandering;
nor may I become, as regards my judgment, a severe Aristotle.
For I pre­ serve in my mind the exhortation of Anacreon-" It is not meet to keep hold of care.
"Why, Venus, hast thou driven three arrows against a single target ? and (why) are these arrows fixed in one soul? With one I am burnt;
with another I am drawn along;
and by another I am in doubt to what pointI shall incline;
but by a violent flame I am wholly scorched.
After placing me in a strange port of desires how great, thou dost not, Venus, pity me, although thou hast an experience thyself of troubles.
Dost thou wish me to suffer things not to be borne, and to say this word ?— " Venus alone has wounded the man made wise through the Muses.
"With fire and snow, and, if thou wilt, with lightning strike (me), and drag me to precipices and to seas;
for him, who has become faint-hearted by troubles, and is subdued by Love, not even the fire of Jove, when hurled against him, can wear down.
Poverty and Love are my two ills.
The one I can bear easily;
but the fire of Venus I cannot support.
Two evils, Want and Love, my spirits tame:
The hunger I can bear, but not the flame.

the dead will not have a drop.
Seek not to glad these senseless stones With fragrant ointments, rosy wreaths ;

But in the water wash not;
lest thou feel Loathing and strange antipathy to wine ;
Such power it hath to make thee hate the vino, E'er since my fount did Prætus' daughters heal.

0 Pan, speak out a sacred saying1 to the flocks as they are feeding, by placing thy bent lip over the golden reeds, in order that the ewes may frequently bring to the dwelling of Clymenus their presents of white milk, heavy in their udders;

I possess, way-farer, this rocky and desert spot;
and yet, not I, but Archelochus, who placed me here, is the cause.
For I, Hermes, do not delight in mountains nor the crests of hills, but am pleased rather with by-paths.
But Archelochus, as being himself a lover of desert places, and unneighbourly, has caused me too, passer-by, to dwell in such a manner.
'aris has seen me naked, and Anchises, and Adonis.
These three only do I know of.
But whence did Prax.

where the pine-tree agitated by the breath of the zephyr shall soothe you, while listening to the music of the tettix;
and the shepherd on the mountain is playing on the pipe his mid-day tune near a fountain, and in a thicket under a shaggy plane-tree is avoiding the heat of the autumnal dog-star;
and to-morrow you shall pass the grove.

You are, 0 painter's brush, envious, and grudgest those who are looking on, by your having concealed the golden ringlets under a head-dress.
But if you hide in the likeness the chief elegance of the chiefest lo not furnish a belief in the rest of the beau winter's brush favours the form.
But you a tealthily taken away the splendour of TheodoA reed I am ;
I cannot bear Grape, or apple, eg, or pear, For gastronomic uses ;
\ But mine is a divine estate, When man doth me initiate A priest of all the Muses.
My point he pares, and splits, and nips, And frames a throat and narrow lips, And fills with sable wine ;
Then, though my mouth is ever dumb, Like one inspired I straight become;
A world of words is mine.

Hunting is a practice for war;
1 and hunting teaches (one) to catch a thing concealed;
to wait for those com­ ing on ;
to pursue the flying.
The diviners of the sky laid down three decads of years, (and) two triads, as the measure of my life.
I am satisfied with these.
For the period of early age is the brightest flower.
Even the thrice old Pylian (Nestor) died.
Why thus, ye shepherds, shamelessly pursue, And drag me from the branches moist with dew, The grasshopper-the friend of solitudes- Shrill-singing to the hills and shady woods, Nymphs' songster-me, who chirp my lays, r them through the heats of summer days ? .
e and thrush-those robbers-see, 'tis they, h, that bear the rough earth's fruit away.
stto catch those spoilers;
kill the thieves ;
,/grudge the grasshopper fresh dew and leaves ? HAA spider having woven its thin 1 web with its sliir 1eet 1 caught a tettix, hampered in the intricate net.
J did not however, on seeing the young thing that love;
music, run by it, while making a lament in the thin fet ters;
but freeing it from the net I relieved it, and spok thus-" Be saved, thou, who singest with a music noise.
"Her web with subtle feet a spider wrought And in its toils a poor cicada caught.
Hearing it lowly wail its flimsy chain, I left not the young songster to complain, But burst its bonds, and let it loose, and said­ " For thy sweet music, freedom be thy meed.
" F.

While with lithe feet her task the spider plied, Within her snares a grasshopper she drew;
Under the tiny chains the captive sigh'd, And to release the child of song I flew.
" Save thee," I cried;
" thy chains are off;
be free ;
And now indulge thy sweetest minstrelsy.

2Hesperius has overcome me and at the same time an early-morning slumber;
the latter, by falling heavily upon me;
the former, by not calling me.
Of which two let the former perish;
but may the other be pro­ pitious, that appeared, knowing the measure of hours.
2When now the Cynic in dark Pluto's reign His earthly task of snarling wisdom closed, Laughing he heard the Lydian king complain, And spread his cloak, and near the prince reposed.
" Drainer," he cried, " of streams that flow'd with gold, My higher dignity in hell behold ;
For all I had on earth, this nether sphere Receives with me;
but thou hast nothing here.

Three damsels once played with each other, by draw­ ing lots, which should first go to Hades.
And thrice they threw from their hands the die;
and the die of all came to one party;
and she laughed at the lot, that was destined for her.
But she, ill-fated, slipped by an un­ expected fall from the roof, and went to Hades, as she had obtained by lot.
Without falsehood is the lot, in which evil (is);
but for what is better, neither prayers are successful in their aim to mortals, nor are hands.
Three damsels once essay'd, in mirthful vein, Who first should visit Pluto's gloomy reign ;
And thrice with anxious hearts they threw the die That should decide their future destiny.
The lot on one was cast;
but no alarm Excited;
she but mock'd the idle charm.
Yet unawares her destiny fulfill'd, Slipp'd from the roof and by the fall was kill'd.
True are the Fates, when hovering evils brood;
Forbear to trust them, when they promise good.

Pindar of Thebes twanged (his lyre) with a loud sound;
the Muse of Simonides, with voice, like honey, sweet, breathed delight;
Stesichorus and Ibycus were brilliant;
Alcman was sweet;

Persuasion followed Ana­ creon.
The Lesbian Alcæus spoke in varied measures with his Æolian harp.
And Sappho is enrolled the ninth not amongst men, but the tenth Muse amongst the lovely2 Muses.

Surely you will think you are hearing the pleasant strain of Calliope herself.
Come, Lesbian maids, to Juno's royal dome, With steps that hardly press the pavement, come;
Let your own Sappho lead the lovely choir, And to the altar bear her golden lyre.

No language greater than thine, 0 pre-eminent mouth of the well-tongued Attica, has every page of the Pan- Hellenes concealed.
For thou didst first, 0 divine Plato, stretch thine eye to god and heaven, and survey mortals and life, and didst with the Socratic sneer mix up the Samian mind, a union 1 most beautiful in a venerable difference of sentiment.
It was meet to place thee, Menander, in union with thy beloved Cupid, living with whom you were initiated in the delightful mysteries of the god.
And thou art plainly carrying about every where the god;

Menander, sweet Thalia's pride, Well art thou placed by Cupid's side.

And thou, 0 Hymen, didst suit, by a change in the strain, that song of marriage to the language of a mournful dirge.
I am the tomb of Ida, hapless bride ! Unto this pillar, traveller, turn aside;
Turn to this tear-worn monument and say­ " Oh ! envious Death, to snatch this life away.
” These mystic symbols all too plainly show The bitter fate of her, who sleeps below.
The very torch that laughing Hymen bore To light the virgin to the bridegroom's door, With that same torch the bridegroom lights the fire, That dimly glimmers on her funeral pyre.

Such is of wanderers the life that is no life.
Yet have the Muses loved me, and instead of things sad, I have what flows with honey;

Far from Tarentum's native soil I lie, Far from the land beloved of infancy.
'Tis dreadful to resign this mortal breath;
But in a stranger-clime 'tis worse than death.
It is not life to pass our fever'd age In ceaseless wanderings o'er the world's wide stage;

Nor lets my memory decay, but long To distant times preserves my deathless song.

A Nymph carried off Astacides, who was a Cretan, and a goat-herd, from a mountain;
and now Astacides lives as a holy person under the Dictæan oaks.
No longer shall we shepherds sing of Daphnis, but Astacides.
I wept, my Heracleitus, when they told That thou wert dead;
I thought of days of old, How oft in talk we sent the sun to rest.
Long since hast thou, my Halicarnassus' guest, Been dust;

In a shady grove of Locris did the Nymphs wash from their fountains the corpse of Hesiod, and raised up a tomb;
and shepherds wetted it with the milk of goats after mixing it with yellow honey.
For such (a honied) voice did the old man breathe out, after he had tasted the pure rills of the Muses.
Deep in a shady Locrian glade The Wood-Nymphs Hesiod's funeral made.
They washed his corpse, they raised a mound, While shepherds on that hallowed ground The stream of milk and honey pour'd To him whom all their hearts adored.
For why ? Because the Muses nine Once fed him from their font divine ;
And from that hour the poet's song Like milk and honey flow'd along.

This is the monument of the Samian Philænis;

I am not she, who described the acts occurring1 amongst women, and who thought nothing of the goddess of Shame.

and may my bones be delighted at my repelling the harsh report.
By the oath held in honour amongst the dead, we, the daughters of Lycambes, who have obtained a hateful reputation, did not disgrace our virginity, nor our parents, nor Pares, the most exalted of holy islands.
But against our family has Archilochus blurted out a freezing reproach and a hateful report.
By the gods and demons, we never knew Archilochus, either in the street, nor at the great shrine of Juno.
If we had been lascivious and full of frowardness, he never would have been willing to have lawful children by us.

Oh! master! shroud my body, when I die, In decent cerements, from the vulgar eye.
But burn me not upon your funeral pyre, Nor dare the gods, nor desecrate their fire.

O father Jove, hast thou ever seen any other man superior to Othryades, who alone was unwilling to re­ turn from Thyrea to his native Sparta, and drove a sword through his side, 1 after writing these conspicuous words—" Behold the spoil (taken) from the descendants of Inachus.
" 1Thou didst, Philænion, perish before marriage;
nor did thy mother Pythias lead thee to the seasonable nup­ tial chamber of a husband, but after disfiguring pite­ ously her cheeks she hid thee, fourteen years old, in this tomb.
Why, woman, dost thou lift up thy shameless hand towards heaven, and after letting down thy maddened locks from thy godless head, surveyest the great anger of Latona ? Oh thou with many children, lament now for the contest, bitter and founded on bad advice.
For of your girls, one is panting near;
another is on the ground with her breath leaving her;
and over another heavy fate is hanging.
Nor is this the end of your troubles;
for a swarm of male children dead is strewed around.
Oh, heavily lamenting their birthday, thou wilt, Niobé, become thyself a stone, worn down by sorrow.
Few subjects briefly treated form the lays, For which Erinna wears the Muse's bays ;
Thus fame is hers ;
nor o'er what she bath sung Hath sable night its shadowy pinions flung.

Pass not, my friend, Anacreon's simple grave- If e'er my verses aught of pleasure gave- Pour wine libations, that the joyous rite My very bones may moisten with delight.

For my mother killed me with an iron weapon, that cut right through me;
nor did she unhappy spare her own life;
for she tied her neck to a cord placed around her throat;
since a death with freedom was to us better than slavery.
Here sleeps a daughter by her mother's side;
Nor slow disease nor war our fates allied.
When hostile banners over Corinth waved, Preferring death, we left a land enslaved.

This is the monument of the hoary-headed Maronis, upon whose tomb you can see yourself a cup, sculptured out of stone.
But she, fond of unmixed (wine), and an everlasting talker, does not mourn for her children, nor for the father of her children, without property;
but even under the grave she laments this one thing, that the chattel, fit for Bacchus, is on her tomb not full.
This tomb Maronis holds, o'er which doth stand A bowl, carved out of flint by Mentor's hand.
The tippling crone, while living, death of friends Ne'er touch'd, nor husband's, nor dear children's ends.
This only troubles her, now dead, to think The monumental bowl should have no drink.

By the right hand of the god Hades, and the dark bed of the unspeakable Proserpine, we swear, that we are truly virgins even under the earth.
But many disgrace­ ful things has the bitter Archilochus blurted out against eur virginity, and 1 putting into verse bad language, applied to not good acts, he has turned woman and man to war.

Alas! of mother's breast the bounteous store How ill repaid! how vain the pangs she bore! Unfruitful Fate! thou, maid of ruthless mind, Hast given a mother's yearnings to the wind.

Not Hymen, but Hades, did Clearista receive as a young husband, having been loosened as to the band of virginity.
For just now, at evening, were the lutes sounding at the portals of the bride, and the doors of the bridal chamber were making a din.
But in the morning they resounded with the howl of sorrow;
and Hymen, after becoming silent, fitted himself by a change to the voice of lamentation;
and the very pitch-pines, that had yielded a torch-light near the nuptial chamber, pointed out the road below to her who had died.
The Morne, which saw me made a bride, That evening witnest that I dyed.
Those holy lights, wherewith they guide Unto the bed the bashful bride, Served but as tapers for to burne, And light my reliques to their urne.

At morn sad bowlings echo round the bed, And the glad hymns on quivering lips expire.

Shed their bright radiance o'er the bridal room, Those very torches, with the morning's light, Conduct the victim to the silent tomb.

and I, Meleager, the son of Eucrates, grew up in the society of the Muses,5 after having run and gained the first prize with the graces of Menippus.
5 But if I am a Syrian, what is the wonder ? We inhabit, stranger, the world, one country (to all) ;
(and) one Chaos has produced all mortals.
On the tablets placed in front of my tomb have I, a man of many years, engraved these words;
for old age is a near neighbour to death ;
but mayest thou, bidding a talkative old man farewell, arrive thyself at a talkative old age.
Tyre was my island-nurse-an Attic race I boast, though Gadara my native place- Herself an Athens.
Eucrates I claim For sire, and Meleager is my name.
From childhood in the Muse was all my pride;
I sang, and, with Menippus side by side, Urged my poetic chariot to the goal.
And why not Syrian ? To the free-born soul Our country is the world, and all on earth One universal Chaos brought to birth.
Now old, and heedful of approaching doom, These lines, in memory of my parted bloom, I on my picture trace, as on my tomb.

A tomb near the tops of the Thracian Olympus holds Orpheus, the son of the Muse Calliopé;
whom oaks did not disobey ;
whom the lifeless stone followed, and the herd of wood-ranging wild beasts;
who formerly in­ vented the mystic rites of Bacchus, and formed the verse joined together by the heroic1 foot:
who 2 with his lyre soothed the heavy thoughts of Clymenus, not to be soft­ ened, and his feelings not to be assuaged.
2Here, after raising his shield as an aider in behalf of Ambracia, did Aristagoras, the son of Theopompus, choose to die rather than to fly.
Feel no surprise.
A Dorian man thinks on his country destroyed, not on his own youth.
By Jupiter, who presides over hospitality, we beg of thee, man, on our knees, to go to the Æolian Thebes, and tell our father Charinus that Menis and Polynicus are dead;
and may you say this-that we do not lament for our death by treachery, although we perished by the hands of Thracians, but for his old age, lying under a sad bereavement.
O Phocæa, thou city of renown, this last word did Theano pronounce, when descending to cheerless1 night —" Woe's me, the unhappy ! What sea art thou, Apel­ lichus, my husband, passing over in thy own vessel, while death is standing near me ? Oh! how I wish to have died, laying hold of your dear hand with my hand.
2These the last words Theano, swift descending To the deep shades of night, was heard to say­ " Alas ! and is it thus my life is ending, And thou, my husband, far o'er seas away ? Ah ! could I but that dear hand press in mine Once-once again-all else I would resign.
" J.

Her absent spouse Theano thus addressed, When at Phocæa death upon her press'd- " Ah me ! Apellichus, why far remain, And with thy fragile bark still plough the main ? Death hovers o'er me ! Would that I could lie With thy dear hand in mine, and calmly die.
" M.

To cheerless night as she descended fast, These words Theano spoke-they were her last— "Apellichus, my husband, where doth roam Thy bark on seas far from Phocæa's home, While death stands near me ? Oh that I might hold Thine hand in mine, till feeling all is cold.

Boldness carries a man to hell and heaven.
It caused Dorotheus, the son of Sosander, to come upon a funeral pile.
For, while bringing a day of freedom to Phthia, he was lost between 1 Sect and Chimara.
1I am the tomb of a person shipwrecked;
yet do thou sail.
For when we were lost, other vessels passed over the sea successfully.
2a Theudotus, (thou art) a great tear-shedding to thy relations, who lamented thee dead, after they had lighted thy unhappy funeral pyre, 0 thou with a sad thread (of life and) a very immature (death);
for instead of marriage and youth thou hast left to thy dearest 4 mother lamentations and griefs.
Archianax, of three years old, while playing round a well, did the mute image of his form draw to itself;
but from the water did the mother snatch him wet- ted thoroughly, and examined whether he exhibited any particle of life.
And the infant had not brought a pollu­ tion upon the water;
but while lying on the knees of its mother, it fell into the deep sleep ( of death).
Archianax was three years old, When playing round a well, Lured by its lifeless image there, He on the surface fell.
The mother snatched her drowning child From out the ruthless wave, To see what sign of life might be, Though slight, her boy to save.
Oh ! he would not-that infant child— The Nymphs' fair home defile ;
But slumbering on his mother's knees, He slept in death the while.

Mayest thou, 0 dirty ground, cause to roll along me on every side the rough thorn, or the savage limbs of the crooked bramble, so that not even a bird may in spring fix its light foot over me, and I may be in a de­ sert, reclining in quietness;
for I, Timon, the man-hater, the man loved not even by fellow-citizens, am a corpse not loved1 in Hades.
Twist round me, thou rough earth, the prickly thorn ;
Let the crook'd savage bramble-branch adorn My tomb, that birds of spring may shun the placer, And I may rest alone in perfect peace.

Do thou, who rowest the boat of the dead in the water of this lake, full of reeds,1 for Hades,2 having a painful task, stretch out, dark Charon, thy hand to the son of Cinyras, as he mounts 3 on the ladder by the gang-way, and receive him.
For his sandals will cause the lad to slip about;
and he fears to put his feet naked on the sand of the shored.
4Over thy head I will heap with my hands the cold sand of the sea-shore, and pour it over thy frozen corpse.
For thy mother has not, lamenting at thy tomb, 5 seen the fate of thee worn away by the sea in the sea;
5 but the desert and inhospitable rocks, near the Ægean shore, have received thee;
so that receive thou, 0 stranger, a small portion of the sand 6 and much of tears, since thou hast come to a fatal mercantile venture.
Accept a grave in these deserted sands, That on thy head I strew with pious hands ;
For to these wintry crags no mother bears The decent rites, or mourns thee with her tears.
Yet, on the frowning promontory laid, Some pious dues, Alexis, please thy shade.
A little sand beside the sounding wave, Moistened with flowing tears, shall be thy grave.

Not even though dead, shall I, Theris, driven, when shipwrecked, by the waves to land, be forgetful of the sleepless shore.
For under a neck (of land), where the sea breaks, near the hostile main, have I met with a tomb at the hands of a stranger.
And I unhappy hear, even amongst the dead, the hateful sound of the sea ever booming;
nor has the grave given me rest from troubles;
since I alone, though dead, do not lie in gentle quiet­ ness.
I, Theris, wreck'd and cast a corpse on shore, Still shudder at old Ocean's ceaseless roar ;
For here beneath the cliffs, where breakers foam, Close by the sea a stranger dug my tomb.
Hence still its roaring, reft of life, I hear ;
Its hateful surge still thunders in my car.
For me alone, by Fate unrespited, Remains no rest to soothe me, e'en though dead.

Oh! thou leader of the dead to Hades, thou, delight­ ed with the tears of all, who ferriest over this deep water of Acheron, do not, even if your skiff is heavy with the ghosts of the dead, leave behind me, Diogenes the dog.
I bring with me a basin, and a staff, and a gar­ ment twice folded, and a wallet, and a farthing for thy boat-trip.
These articles alone when living I possessed, which I bring here even dead;

Thy mother herself, who bore thee, Demetrius, gave thee to death, when thou hadst been a coward contrary to what was proper, and she bathed a war-(weapon in blood) within thy hollow flanks;
and she said, while holding the steel weltering in, and full of, the blood of her own son, and moving her jaw,1 full of foam, with a noise like a saw, and looking like a Laconian woman, with eyes turned aside—" Quit the Eurotas ;
go to Tartarus;
since thou hast known a coward's flight, thou art not mine, nor a Laconian.
"Thy mother gave thee death, thou 'dst basely fled:
Through thy deep flank the sword thy mother sped, Demetrius ;
she that bare thee ;
and she cried, With hand upon the steel thy life-blood dyed, Champing her foaming lip in furious wise, And Sparta's daughter glaring in thy eyes­ " Eurotas spurns, Hell calls thee ;

This is the place, where Leander swam over;
1 this the passage over the sea, that was hostile not to the male lover alone;
this was the former dwelling of Hero ;
this the remains of the turret;
here was placed the treacher­ ous lamp.
This common tomb holds them both, whc even until now are blaming that envious wind.
This Magnesian tomb is not of Themistocles;
but I am heaped up, as a monument of the envious and incor­ rect judgment of the Greeks.
Ausonian dust possesses me a Libyan woman, and near Rome I lie a virgin by this sea-sand;
and Pompeia, who brought me up in the place of a daughter, wept over me, and put me in the tomb of a freed person, while she was hastening (for me) another fire;
but 3 this came before-hand ;
nor did Proserpine light the lamp accord­ ing to our prayer.
3Oh! hapless Nicanor, who didst meet with thy fate in the ocean, white (with foam), thou liest naked on a strange sea-shore, or near to rocks :
and all those happy homes of thine are no more, and the hope of all Tyre has perished;
nor has aught of thy possessions been thy guard.
Alas! piteously hast thou perished, having la­ boured for the fishes and the sea.
Doom'd, poor Nicanor, to the hoar sea-wave, Naked thou liest on a foreign coast, Or haply 'neath some rock.
Thy palace brave Is gone for aye, and all Tyre's hopes are lost.
Of all thy wealth nought saved thee ;

The parents of Aristippus felt joy and sorrow for their child.
One day had a share in both.
For after he had fled from a house on fire, Jupiter sent direct against his head the ineffable glare of lightning;
and this word did those, who wept over his corpse, say—“ Oh ! thou un­ happy, who didst owe a debt to the fire of the deity! "Heliodorus was the first to go, and his wife Dioge­ neia followed her dear husband after scarcely the inter­ val of an hour;
and as both had dwelt together, they are entombed in one spot, delighted with a common sepul­ chre, as with a (common) marriage-bed.
1 Thy fate was changed for death,1 and in the place of thee, my master, I, a slave, filled up a hateful tomb, when I was making thy lamented grave under the earth, in order that I might bury there the body of thee deceased;
but the hollowed-out dust slipped around me.
Hades however is not disagreeable to me.
I shall live 2 under thy sun.
2And who is he, that, after weeping for a son, has not endured the extreme of ill ? But the house of Poseidip­ pus buried all the four children;
whom days of death, equal in number (to those of the children), snatched away, and cut off the great hopes entertained of them;
but the wretched eyes of the father, flooded by showers of sorrow, were destroyed;
and one common night lays hold of all.
Othryades, the great glory of Sparta, and the naval warrior Cynegeirus, and the deeds of all battles, has Arrius, the Italian spearman, surpassed.
Having fallen at the stream of the Nile, and half-dead from many arrows, when he saw the eagle of his own army seized upon by the enemy, he sprung up again from the dead, renowned in fight, and killing the party, who was carry­ ing it, (the eagle,) he preserved it for his own leaders, and alone obtained a death unconquered.
Let Cynegeirus' name, renowned of yore, And brave Othryades, be heard no more.
By Nile's swoln wave Italian Arrius lay, Transfix'd with wounds, and sobb'd his soul away;
But seeing Rome's proud eagle captive led, He started from the ghastly heaps of dead;
The captor slew;
the noble prize brought home, And found death only to be not overcome.

Over the change in the fate of her two children their mother, throwing herself around both, pronounced, an object of pity, these words—“ On this day I did not ex­ pect to lament over thy corpse, my child;
nor to see thee too amongst the living.
But the demons1 have been changed as regards you two, while a not-lying sorrow has come upon me.
"a thou hapless one! with what word shall I ad­ dress thee first ? with what last, thou hapless one ? for this one word is true in every ill.
Thou art gone, my charming wife, after carrying off the highest honours for the beauty of form and the moral conduct of soul;
and truly was thy name Proté (first);
for every thing was second to thy inimitable grace.
1The earth was called also my mother ;
1 the earth hides me, even a corpse.
This is not worse than that.
2 In this I shall be for a long time.
From my mother 3 has the burning heat of the sun snatched me away.
And I lie in a strange land under a heap of stones, the much- lamented Inachus, the obedient servant of Crinagoras.
Why do we, wretched, wander about, trusting to vain hopes, and forgetful of calamitous death.
This was Se­ lecus, in all respects exact in conversation and con­ duct, but enjoying a short period of youth.
In the extreme Iberia,4 distant twice as far as Lesbos, he lies a stranger on unmeasured sea-shores.
Other islands too have denied their previous names of no note, and have come to bear the same name as men.
5 And may you likewise be called “ Erotides" (the Lovely).
There will be no anger from Nemesis against you for making this change in the name.
For to the boy, whom ye have placed in the tomb under a holy sod, Love himself had given a name and form.
0 land, 1that still sees the monument,1 and 0 sea, near the shore, mayest thou (the former) lie lightly, and thou (the latter) quietly.
Full oft of old the islands changed their name, And took new titles from some heir of fame ;
Then dread not ye the wrath of gods above, But change your own and be the " Isles of Love.
” For Love's own name and shape the infant bore, Whom late we buried on your sandy shore.
Break softly there, thou never-weary wave, And earth, lie lightly on his little grave.

A hostile association hurled Cleitonymus to the fishes and sea, when he, the tyrant-killer, arrived at the cita­ del.
But the deity of Justice buried him.
For the bank, having been torn away, buried the whole body from foot to head, and he lies not wetted by the water;
and the earth, reverencing the haven of her own free­ dom,2 conceals him.
Lo! to the fishes and the stream a murderous band hath roll'd Cleitonymus, who came to slay the tyrant in his hold.
But Justice found him burial;

And now the waters drench him not;

Two eyes, the buddings from thy land, Miletus, has the dust of Italy covered by a rapid death, and thou hast obtained in exchange griefs for garlands;
their relics, alas ! thou hast seen put up in a small urn.
Alas! unhappy country.
From whence, or when shalt thou boast again of such stars shining in Greece ?Unhappy Cleanassa, thou wert a damsel seasonable for marriage, and, as it were, in the very prime of youth.
But not Hymen, who presides over wedlock, nor the torches of Juno the Yoker, met at your nuptial cham­ ber ;
but mournful Hades revelled there;
and around did a Fury of blood send forth an ill-fated voice from er mouth;
and on the day, in which the bridal room w-as lit up with torches, in that didst thou meet with a iuneral pyre, not the marriage bed.
The island of Pelops, and Crete, where sailing is diffi­ cult, and the blind sunk-rocks of Malea, when it is be- ing doubled,1 have destroyed the Cydonian Astydamas, the son of Damis;
and he has filled the stomachs of sea­ monsters.
But persons have placed a lying tomb on the ground.
What wonder? where the Cretans are liars;

Not because care has been wanting to me, when dead, nor that I lie here a naked corpse upon wheat-producing land, 3 ( do I complain,) 3 for I have been formerly buried;

Who will surely say that death is a deliverance from ills ? since, stranger, not even my tomb is the last of my sufferings.
A long age shall sing of thee, Protesilaus of Thessaly, who didst begin the falling (of thy body), due as a debt to Troy.
Thy monument, sheltered by elms, do the Nymphs bedeck, (who dwell) opposite to hated Ilion;
4 where trees with angry feelings shed their dry foliage, whenever they behold the walls of Troy.
4 How great then was the anger felt by heroes, since a portion of enmity is preserved even now in lifeless boughs!Having already approached near to my native land, I said—“ To-morrow will my long and difficult voyage be tired out against me.

Form a conjecture of the man, who loved his country, by Salamis and the vessels there, and you shall know from them that he was greater than the land of Cecrops.
Let these stone dwellings 3 of my night, which con­ ceals me,3 and the water of Cocytus, around which are lamentations, witness, that my husband did not, as per­ sons say, murder me, while looking after a marriage with another woman.

Paulla of Tarentum is surely not the solitary (wife), who has died y a rapid death.

Why, alas! does an envy, mixed with passion, of good men ever possess the descendants of Theseus ?Under me, 0 stranger, do I hold Menander, the son of Diopeithes, a descendant of Cecrops, to whom Bacchus and the Muses were a care :

For as the water rose didst thou, fearing the violence of the sea, fall out over the hollow vessel.
And the tomb tells thy name and land of Cumé ;
but thy bones are washed on the cold shore, an ill, bitter to thy father Aristomachus;

1Cold on the wild wave floats thy virgin form;
Drenched are thy auburn tresses by the storm ;
Poor lost Eliza ! In the raging sea Gone is my every joy and hope in thee.
These sad recording stones thy fate deplore;
Thy bones are wafted to some distant shore.
What bitter sorrows did thy father prove, Who brought thee destined for a bridegroom's love ! Sorrowing he came, nor to the youth forlorn Consigned a maid to love, nor corpse to mourn.

Orpheus by his harp obtained the greatest honour from mortals;
Nestor, by the wisdom of his sweetly talking tongue;

Traveller! regret not me ;
for thou shalt find Just cause of sorrow none in my decease;
Who, dying, children's children left behind, And with one wife lived many years in peace:
Three virtuous youths espoused my daughters three;
And oft their infants in my bosom lay;
Nor saw I one, of all derived from me, Touch'd by disease, or torn by death away.
Their duteous hands my funeral rites bestowed, And me, by blameless manners fitted well To seek it, sent to the serene abode, Where shades of pious men for ever dwell.

None have I mourn'd for in disease or death ;
They wept, when painless I resigned my breath, And a sweet sleep convey'd me to the blest.

LOVELY by name, and more so in mind than face, is dead.
Alas! the spring-time of the Graces has perished.

More for her gracious spirit than her face, This graceful maid deserved her name of " Grace," Yet died she in the spring-time of her charms.

For thee a father and for thee a husband shed bitter tears;

but the tomb, alas ! holds thee only sixteen years old.

Hector and the shield-bearing Ajax gave to each other a bitter present, as the remembrance of friendship after a fight.

These in behalf of their country placed their arms for contest, and scattered the insolence of their antagonists:

Their fa­ ther-land holds the bodies of those, who laboured for the best;
' since a decision from Jupiter has come* to mor­ tals—" It is for the gods not to err, and to arrange every thing correctly ;

" 3These were the brave, unknowing how to yield ;
Who, terrible in valour, kept the field Against the foe ;
and, higher than life's breath Prizing their honour, met the doom of death, Our common doom ;

2 since the goddess 3 has effected a truce.
I am, 0 Zephyritis, a shell, 4 the marvel of sailing.
4 But thou, Venus, dost now possess me, a Nautilus, the first offering of Selenéa ;
me, who used to sail over the sea, if there was a breeze, stretching a sail by my own cordage;
5 but if there was a calm, I ran over the plain of the smooth (sea),5 rowing with my feet:
6 my name coincides with the work of a vessel.
6 And I was stranded near the shore of Julius, in order that I might become a plaything, surveyed all round, for thee, Arsinoé ;
and that no longer in me, as a recess, 7 the egg of the hapless Alcyoné might be hatched as formerly-for I am without breathe But grant thou thy grace to the daughter of Clinias;
for she knows how to perform good acts;
and she is from Smyrna in Æolia.
Queen of the Zephyr's breezy cape ! to thee This polished shell, the treasure of the sea, Her earliest offspring young Seléna bears, Join'd with the incense of her maiden prayers.
Erewhile with motion, power, and sense endued, Alive it floated on the parent flood ;
When, if the gale more rudely breathed, it gave Its natural sail expanded to the wave ;
But while the billows slept upon the shore, And the tempestuous winds forgot to roar, Like some proud galley, floated on the tide, And busy feet the want of oars supplied.
Shipwrecked at last upon th' Iulian strand, It now, Arsinoe, asks thy favouring hand.
No more its vows the plaintive Halcyon hail For the soft breathings of a western gale ;
But that, 0 mighty queen, thy genial power On young Seléna every gift may shower, That love with beauteous innocence can share ;
For these, and only these, accept the prayer.

Erst a mere conch, I now an offering shine- Selene's first, to Venus Zephyrine.
Then, lightly skimming o'er the azure seas, My native sail I hoisted to the breeze;
Or ploughed, becalmed, with oary feet the main ;
And thus deserved the name I still retain.
Now tost by storms on fair Iulis' strand, A brilliant toy, I grace Arsinoe's hand.
Nor longer need, from all my toils at rest, The Halcyon more lament her rifled nest;
But for the offering fitting thanks be paid To Clinias' daughter, Smyrna's pious maid.

WRANGHAM.
Oh ! Zephyritis, for Selena's sake, My ancient shell, her virgin offering, take.
Venus, thou art my goddess now;
the sea, When the south winds blew cheerly, wafted me, Thy Nautilus, who swam before the gale, Stretching with cordage all my own the sail.
In the bright calm with twinkling feet I float, Rapidly rowing ;
hence my name of boat.
Cast on Iulis' shore, 'tis mine to be A plaything and thy toy, Arsinoe, To gaze on with delight;
for I am dead, And sad Alcyoné finds not the bed, In which to lay her eggs, where once she laid, And hatched her young.
But let all thanks be paid To Clinias' daughter, who the offering gives Duteous, and in Æolian Smyrna lives.
W.
LISLE BOWLESOnce a mere shell, no more;
but now to thee, O Venus Zephyritis, the first gift From Selenæa, offer'd here am I, The Nautilus, the ocean's voyager:
Who, when soft breezes breathed, was wont to stretch With mine own cordage mine own proper sail;
But in bright calms to scud along, self-steer'd With oary feet, as well my name implies, Till I was stranded on the Julian shore;
A toy indeed-but not unprized by thee, Arsinoé—for in thy temple placed, Never again, as heretofore, shall I, Now lifeless, watch the mournful Halcyon, Brooding in peace upon the tranquil deep.
Be gracious then to Clinias' daughter;
good Her life, who in Æolian Smyrna dwells.

Achrylis, the Phrygian chamber-attendant (on Cybelé), she, who often let flow her holy ringlets about the torches—she, who often gave for the Gallic 1 howling of Cybelé sounds from her mouth, that (came) heavy to the ear, has placed around the door these locks in honour of the mountain goddess;
since she has stopt the foot fe­ vered by madness.
The harp, and the bows and arrows, and the crooked nets, are for Phœbus, (the gifts) of Sosis, Phile, Polycra­ tes.
The archer has given the bow tipped with horn;
the minstrel on the lyre, the shell;

The bull, that once bellowed on the high grounds of Mount Orbelius, the wild animal that formerly made Ma­ cedonia a desert, has the lightning-like Philip, the over­ thrower of the Dardanians, destroyed by striking the middle of its head with a hunting pole ;
and these horns, the defence of its (once) unrestrained head, has he put up for thee, Hercules, not without its strong hide.
From thee as a root has he run up ;
nor is it unseemly for him to rival the ancestral arts of bull-slaying.
These sandals that keep the feet warm, the delightful labour of skilful shoemakers, (has) Bitenna (offered up);
and Philonis, this binder of the hair, that loves to be plaited, a cap dyed in the colour of the white sea;
and Anticlea, the fan;
and the lovely Heliodora, the veil for the face, a work partaking of the spider's web ;
but she, who has a name called after her father Aristotle, the ser­ pent with pretty folds, an ornament of gold for her slim ancles ;
all of one mind and age, (have given) presents to the heavenly Cythéra-born.
What mortal has tied up around the coping-stones these spoils for me, a delight disgraceful to Mars ? For neither broken spears, nor a helmet without its crest, nor a shield stained with blood is hung up ;
1 but things vainly glittering, and not battered by iron, such as are the spoils not in a (war)-shout, but in a dance;
with which adorn ye a bridal chamber;

Dionysius, the son of Protarchus, has offered me up to the Nymphs, who dwell in caves, and I am a present from the sacred (coast of) Pelorus;
and a nar­ row and crooked sea-strait threw me up, in order that I might be a plaything for the smooth-faced Cave- Nymphs.
Bitenna (gave) these sandals;
and Philænis the purple cap, that protects the much-wandering hair;
and the light-haired Anticleia the fan, that conceals a not genuine breeze,3 (and) wards off violent heat;
and Heracleia this thin concealment of the face, made like the nets of the spider ;
and she who bears the name of her father Arts- totle, the beautiful folds of the serpent round the ancle, these splendid presents to thee, Venus, who presidest over marriage, have equals in age offered, who dwell by the sea-shore, 1 at Naucratis.
Cythera of Bithynia has, after making a vow, offered up me, a white-marble representation of thy form, Venus.
But do thou, for a small favour, give in return a great one, as is the custom.
She is satisfied with the agree­ ment in mind of her husband.

We roses formerly bloomed in the spring, but now in the midst of winter we lay open our scarlet buds, smiling upon thy birth-day, and pleased with this morning, the nearest to the time of thy marriage-bed.
It is better to be seen on the temples of Callista a wife, than to wait for the sun of spring.
Children of spring, but now in wintry snow We purple roses for Callista blow.
Duteous we smile upon thy natal morn ;
Thy bridal bed to-morrow we adorn.
Oh ! sweeter far to bloom our little day, Wreath'd in thy hair, than wait the sunny May.

We roses, Lady, with flower-loving May Are wont to come ;
but now 'mid winter's cold We love our purple blossoms to unfold, And greet thee well on this thy natal day.

On a votive morning we perform these holy rites to Jupiter, presiding over marriage, and to Diana, the mild (goddess) of the pains of child-birth.
For to them my brother, while yet without down on his chin, vowed he would offer the first-fruits of the spring (seen) upon the cheeks of young men.
And may ye deities receive it;
and forthwith from this down up to hoary hairs may ye lead Euclides.
To thee, the superintendent of the shore near the sea, I send these small cakes of meal, and gifts of a slight sacrificial rite.
For to-morrow I shall pass over the wide wave of the Ionian (sea), while hastening to the bosom of my Eidotheé.
And do thou shine propitious to my love and sail-mast, 0 Venus, the mistress of marriage- beds and strands.
To thee, the deity over roads,1 has Antiphilus offered up this felt-covering for his head, the symbol of his way-faring life.
For thou hast listened to his prayers;
(and) been propitious to his paths.
The present is not much, but it is a holy one.
Nor let any greedy traveller snatch with his hand this offering of mine.
It is not safe to steal even small things.
In fortune, mistress, I am little.
But I say that (my gift) peers above the wealth of all, inasmuch as it is from the heart.
And do thou receive the covering of a carpet made of soft and thick sheep's wool, conspicuous with its bright-coloured scarlet, and worsted thread of a rose­ colour, and nard for thy dark-haired locks, enclosed in a blue glass (bottle), in order that a vest may cover thy skin, and the work prove the manufacture, and a sweet smelling exhalation come from thy ringlets.
Who has filled, with (the flour of) Ceres, me a cask made for Dionysius? who me, a receptacle for the nectar-like wine of the Adriatic ? What grudging is there to me of wine ? Or is there a scarcity of vessels fit for corn ? He has disgraced both (deities).
Bacchus has been robbed, and Ceres does not2 receive drunken­ ness as a fellow-boarder.
I have an apple, as big as an ostrich,.
preserved from the preceding year, still beautiful in its youthful bloom, without a spot, without a wrinkle, with the down on it equal to those recently produced, still sticking to the full-leaved bough, a rare honour to the season of win- ter;
but for thee, 0 queen, such a fruit bears even the cold of snow.
Do thou, Juno, who rulest over Samos, and who hast obtained by lot the river Imbrasus, receive, 0 venerable deity, as the sacrificial rites on a birth-day, these sacred (portions) of calves, which we, who know the or don­ nances of the blessed (gods), know to be the most agree­ able of all things.
Maximus, on making the libations, uttered a prayer;
and she (the goddess) has nodded favourably.
Matters are firmly placed;
and the threads of the Fates feel no envy.
Who has offered cakes greasy with oil ? who grapes to Mars the city-destroyer ? who the cup-like buds of roses ? These things I wish a person would carry to the Nymphs.
I, the bold-planning Mars, do not receive on my altars sacrifices unstained by blood.
Another person sends you birth-day presents, ob tained from the hunter's net-stakes;
and one from the air;
and another from the sea;
but from me receive a line of the Muses, which remains for ever, and is the mark of (my) friendship and (your) good education.
One sends thee game from nets and stakes obtain'd;
Fowls of the air, another;
fish has gained Another from the sea, to grace the day That marks thy birth ;

From poverty, as you know, Venus, that is genuine, yet honesty receive these gifts from Leonidas;
this small purple grape, and this ripe salted olive, and the law­ ful sacrifice of small cakes, and a libation (of wine), which I have drawn without being shaken, and figs sweet as honey.
Do thou then defend me as from dis­ ease, so likewise from poverty.
And then thou shalt see me sacrificing an ox;
and mayest thou, my good genius, hasten to receive my thanks in return.
Philoxenides, the celebrated1 goat-driver, after cut­ ting thee, Pan, from a beech, has placed the figure with the bark on, after sacrificing a hoary goat, that mounts the ewes, and making the sacred altar drunk with the first-produced milk;
in return for which may 2 the ewes in the folds be pregnant with two young ones, after escaping from the rough tooth of the wolf.
The rounded lead, the marker of the sides of the page, and the scraper and splitter of the reeds with arrow­ like tips, and the ruler placed at the top,3 and the pumice-stone, (rolled) along the shore,4 the dried stone with holes made in it by the sea, has Callimenes offered up to the Muses, after ceasing from business;

2To thee, Priapus, delighted with both the sunken rocks, worn down by the waves of Nessis3 on the sea- shore, and the bluff upper rocks, has Paris, the fisher­ man, hung up a crab, with its oyster-like shell, killed by the cleverly-catching rod;
the flesh, when exposed to, fire, did he happy place under his tooth, half-eaten (by age), but the offal-shell has he given to thee.
Where­ fore do thou give him not many things, but by means of a line, catching successfully, a quietness to his barking belly.

The aged Cinyras, on ceasing to labour, has offered up to the Nymphs these nets worn away by the con­ tinued catching (of fish).
For no longer was he able, with a trembling hand, to cast the circular bosom of the opened net.
If there be the offering of a small present, this, ye Nymphs, is no blame (to me);
since the whole life of Cinyras is this.
To Ocean's Nymphs old Cinyras gives o'er This useless net, which he can cast no more.
Now sport, ye fish, securely on the sea, For he no longer threats your liberty.

And she carried it again to Love.
For it is just that those in love bring Love him­ self as a gift to Love.
To Persuasion and the Paphian goddess, has Eury­ nomas the neatherd, the bridegroom of Hermophile, with a chaplet of rose-buds offered up a cheese and honey­ combs.
And do ye receive the cheese in return for her, and the honey for me.
Porphyris of Cnidus has for thyself, Dionysus, placed on high before thy chapel these ornaments of her beauty and madness, namely, the chaplets on her head, and the spear with a double pine-cone, and the ancle-band, with which she acted the Bacchant freely, when, after uniting to her bosom the fawn-skin, decked with ivy, she fre­ quented the orgies of Dionysus.
To the Paphian goddess her garland, to Pallas her ringlets, (and) to Artemis her girdle, has Callirrho6 offered up.
For she has found the suitor she wished, and has reached a prudent period of youth, and borne a male race of children.
Venus ! this chaplet take ! Callirrhoé pray'd.
Thy youth I loved, thy power hath made him mine.

Your husband Anchises, for whose sake you did, Venus, often run formerly to the shores of Ida,1 has now with difficulty found a black hair to cut off from his head, and has offered to you the relic of his former youth.
But do you, goddess, for you can, either make me young, or receive my hoary age, as if it were youth.
Oft hast thou left the realms of air To dwell with me on Ida's shore;
But now gay youth is mine no more, And age has marked my brows with care.

Stratonicus, the ploughman, has, in return for kind­ ness, offered up to thee, Pan, who dwellest on the crests of hills, these unsown holy enclosures;
and he said­ " Feed with delight thy herds, and look upon thy ground, never as yet cut down by iron.
Thou wilt find a proper dwelling-place;
for here will Echo, pleased with thee, consummate even a marriage.
"To thee the ten-thousand tearings of garlands, de­ prived of leaves-to thee the broken cups of drunkenness disturbed in its mind — to thee the ringlets bedewed with myrrh,-all these lie in the dust as spoils for thee, Lais, from the love-struck Anaxagoras.
For at thy threshold the unhappy man, after passing frequently the whole night with companions in the prime of youth, has never extorted a word, or a pleasant promise, or the saucy language of honey-dropping hope.
Alas ! alas ! wasted in limbs, he has left these symbols of revellings, and blames the beauty of the damsel not to be turned.
To thee the relics of a thousand flowers Torn from the chaplet, twined in gayer hours- To thee the goblet, carved with skill divine, Erewhile that foam'd with soul-subduing wine- The locks now scattered on the dusty ground, Once breathing odours and with garlands crown'd— Outcasts of pleasure and of hope bereft, Lais ! to thee thy Corydon has left.
Oft on thy threshold stretched at close of day, He wept and sigh'd the cheerless night away ;
Nor dared invoke thy name, nor dared aspire To melt thy bosom with his amorous fire ;
Or plead a gracious respite to his pain, Or speak the language of a happier swain.
Alas ! alas ! now cold and senseless grown, These last sad offerings make his sorrows known, And dare upbraid those scornful charms that gave His youth unpitied to the cheerless grave.

and the Water-Nymphs together with those who haunt the woods, who have made a dance;
since it had oftentimes thrown them into a fright.

I, Daphnis the reed-player, labouring under a trem­ bling old age, have offered up to Pan, fond of a country life, this shepherd's crook belonging to a hand unable to work, and weighed down, after having ceased in old age from the labours of a shepherd.

To Bacchus with ivy-bound hair 2 Lenagoras, a person working at vines, has offered up a Satyr, shaken by wine.
Upon him, heavy in his head, you would say that the dress made of a skin, the hair, the ivy, (and) the grape are all drunk ;

The old Amyntichus bound a net with lead at its ex­ tremity round the trident (of Neptune), after ceasing from his toils in the sea, and said to the deity, while shedding tears from his eye-lids, like3 the salt swell of the sea—" Thou knowest, 0 blessed (power), that I am past work.

SORROWS for the dead, Pericles, are full of groans, and no one, who bears them in remembrance, will be delight­ ed with feastings or drinking.
1 For of such kind of per­ sons 1 has the wave of the much-roaring sea overwhelmed, and we have our lungs swollen with sorrow.
But for ills not to be cured have the gods, my friend, given a remedy in a strong endurance.

For neither by weeping shall I medicine bring, nor shall I make the evil worse by attending to pleasures and feastings.
Loud are our griefs, my friend, and vain is he Who steeps the sense in mirth and revelry.
O'er those we mourn the hoarse resounding wave Has closed, and whelm'd them in their ocean grave.
Deep sorrow swells each breast.

Had we but seen th' accustomed flames aspire, And wrap his corse in purifying fire !Yet what avails it to lament the dead ?

Many bows are not stretched, nor frequent slings (hurled), when war brings together the combat in the plain ;
but of swords there will be the much-groan-pro­ ducing work;
for in this kind of fight are skilled those lords of Eubœa, renowned for the spear.
Bows will not avail thee, Darts and slings will fail thee, When Mars tumultuous rages On wide-embattled land ;
Then with faulchions clashing, Eyes with fury flashing, Man with man engages In combat hand to hand.

Look you, Glaucus, for the deep sea is disturbed by waves, and a cloud stands 1 erect in a circle around the tops,l a sign of a wintry storm, and fear lays hold ( of us) from its unexpectedness.
Behold, my Glaucus ! how the deep Heaves, while the sweeping billows howl, And round the promontory steep The big black clouds portentous scowl, With thunder fraught and lightning's glare, While Terror rules, and wild Despair.

Place all things in the hands of the gods.
Often after ills they cause men to stand erect, who have been lying on the dark1 earth;
and often do they overturn even those, who have been walking very firmly, and throw them on their backs.
Then many ills arise, and 3 of life it is necessary that a person does not wander, 3 and (is) carried aside in mind.
Leave the gods to order all things;
Often from the gulf of woe They exalt the poor man, grov'ling In the gloomy shades below.
Often turn again and prostrate Lay in dust the loftiest head, Dooming him through life to wander, Reft of sense and wanting bread.

Of things there is not one unexpected, nor to be forsworn, nor to be wondered at ;
since Zeus, the father of the Olympian (gods), has out of the mid-day brought night, and concealed the light of the shining sun;
and a moist4 fear has come upon men.
5From hence all things arise, not to be disbelieved, and to be expected5 by man;
nor let any one of you wonder at beholding, even if wild beasts exchange with dolphins their pasture in the sea, or if the booming waves become more agreeable than the continent to them (the dolphins);
1 and a mountain is pleasant to them.
1Never man again may swear Things still shall be, as erst they were:
Never more in wonder stare, Since Jove, th' Olympian thunderer, Bade the sun's meridian splendour Hide in shades of thickest night;
While th' affrighted nations started, Trembling at the fearful sight.
Who shall dare to doubt hereafter, Whatsoever man may say ? Who refuse with stupid laughter, Credence to the wildest lay ? Though for pasture dolphins ranging, Leap the hills and scour the wood, And fierce wolves, their nature changing, Dive beneath th' astonished flood.

2No one, when dead, although previously3 a man of might, becomes an object of reverence with citizens.
2 We who are alive, pursue rather the favour of the living;
but to the dead man himself4 the worst things occur.
Nor5 is it well to speak in a galling manner over men who are dead ?Death seals the fountains of reward and fame;
Man dies, and leaves no guardian of his name.
Applause awaits us only while we live, While we can honour take and honour give.
Yet it were base in man, of woman born, To mock the naked ghost with jests or scorn.

2I, being a little one without a voice,2 say this-should a person ask—after I have put down an untired voice at (my) feet, “Aristo, (the wife) of Hermocleidas, (who was the son) of Saoniadas, has offered me up to the daughter of Latona (worshipped) at Æthiopium,3 thy servant, 0 mistress of women;
for whom do thou, pleased and with forethought, render famous our family.
"Does any ask ? I answer from the dead ;
A voice that lives is graven o'er my head To dark-eyed Dian, ere my days begun, Aristo vow'd me, wife of Saon's son.

but he is one, who, mixing together the glorious gifts of the Muses and Venus, brings to remembrance delightful mirth.

From the time when the sea divided Europe from Asia, and impetuous Mars superintended the wars of mortals, never has a deed been done by men on the earth more honourable, on the continent and by sea to boot.
For these, after destroying many of the Medes on land, took at sea a hundred ships of the Phœnicians, full of men;
and greatly did Asia groan, when struck by them, by both arms, the strength of war.
Ne'er since that olden time, when Asia stood First torn from Europe by the ocean flood, Since horned Mars first pour'd on either shore The storm of battle, and its wild uproar, Hath man by sea and land such glory won, As for the mighty deed this day was done.

By sea a hundred Tyrian ships are drowned, With all their martial host;

O thou vine, the all-soother, the nurse of wine, the mother of the grape, who producest the .
twisting bend of the curling tendril, mayest thou grow in freshness on the top of the grave-stone of Anacreon, and on the slight mound of this tomb, so that the lover of the un­ mixed juice, and who heavy with wine was fond of revelry, may all night long strike the lyre, dear to youths, and drink even in the grave, and take to himself the transparent grape from the branch in due season hang­ ing over his head ;
and may its dew-drop moisten him, sweeter than which the old man was wont to breathe from his soft lips.
All-cheering vine, with purple clusters crown'd, Whose tendrils, curling o'er the humble mound Beneath whose turf Anacreon's relics rest, Clasp the low column rising o'er his breast, Still may'st thou flourish ;
that the bard divine, Who nightly sang the joys of love and wine, May view, though sunk amongst the silent dead, Thy honours waving o'er his aged head;
Whilst on his ashes in perennial rills, Soothing his shade, thy nectar'd juice distils ;
Sweet juice! but sweeter still the words of fire, That breathed responsive to his tuneful lyre.

Breathe o'er his tomb thy sweet and dewy rain;
Who rests below once waked a sweeter strain.

This tomb in his country of Teos has received Ana­ creon, the minstrel immortal through the Muses;
who fitted songs, breathing Graces and breathing Loves, to his delightful desire for young persons.
He alone is weighed down (with grief) near Acheron, not because leaving the sun he has met there with the mansions of oblivion, but because he has left the graceful Megisteus in company with young persons, and the love he felt for the Thracian Smerdis.
And he does not forget the strain, delighting like honey;
and though dead he has not put to sleep that lyre of his in Hades.
Behold ! where Teos shrouds her minstrel son, The deathless bard, the lost Anacreon, Whose raptur'd numbers, wing'd with soft desire, Did all the Graces, all the Loves inspire.
For this alone he grieves within the grave ;
Not that the sun is dark on Lethe's wave, But that Megiste's eyes he may not see, Nor, Thressa, still look wistfully on thee.
Still he remembers musics honeyed breath, Still wakes the lyre beneath the house of death.

There is nothing amongst men that remains firmly fixed for ever;
and this one sentiment the man of Chios has expressed the best,—“ As is the race of leaves, such is of men.
" But few mortals, receiving it through the ears, deposit it in their breasts.
For to each is present the hope, which is implanted in the bosoms of young men.
And as long as a mortal possesses the much-de­ sired flower of youth, he has light thoughts, and imagines many things that are never to be accomplished.
For he has no expectation of becoming old or dying, nor, when he is in health, has he any thought of sickness.
Simple­ tons (are they), whose mind lies in this direction, and who know not that short is the period of youth and life to mortals;
but do you, after learning this, endure to the end of life in gratifying your soul with good things.
All human things are subject to decay;
And well the man of Chios tuned his lay— " Like leaves on trees, the race of man is found.
" Yet few receive the melancholy sound, Or in their breasts imprint this solemn truth;
For Hope is near to all, but most to youth.
Hope's vernal season leads the laughing hours, And strews o'er every path the fairest flowers;
To cloud the scene no distant mists appear;
Age moves no thought, and death awakes no fear.
Ah ! how unmindful is the giddy crowd Of the small span to youth and life allow'd! Ye who reflect, the short-lived good employ, And while the power remains, indulge your joy.

When a Gallus,5 to avoid the approach of a snow- storm, arrived under a deserted cliff, and had wiped off the wet from his hair, on his footsteps came a lion very hungry 1 to the hollow path;
when he, laying hold of a large tambourine with his extended hand, struck it, and the whole cavern resounded with the noise;
nor did the wood-inhabiting wild beast 2remain to endure2 the sacred sound of Cybelé, but rushed quickly through the woody mountain, fearing the half-female servant of the goddess, who for Rhea has hung up these, his dress and auburn locks.
From wintry snows, descending fiercely round, A priest of Cybele a shelter found Beneath a desert cliff, that beetling stood O'er the wild margin of the ocean flood.
Here, as he wrung the moisture from his hair, He saw, advancing to his secret lair, With hunger fierce, and horrid to behold, The grim destroyer of the nightly fold.
Then, all dismayed, the sacred drum he shook With wide-extended hand, and wildly struck.
He struck ;
the hollow cave, within, around, On every side, rebellow'd to the sound.
The forest's lord, overcome with holy dread, Back to his native woods, loud howling, fled;

The best measure for Bacchus (wine) is what is not much, nor very little.
For he is the cause either of grief or madness.
He rejoices in being mixed, himself the fourth, with three Nymphs;
1 and then he is the most ready for the rites of wedlock.
But if he 2 breathes violently,2 he turns away the Loves, and is drowned in sleep, the neighbour of death.
Water your wine in moderation- There's grief or madness in a strong potation ;
For 'tis young Bacchus' chiefest pleasure To move with Naiads three in linked measure.
'Tis then he is good company For sports, and loves, and decent jollity.
But, when alone, avoid his breath;
He breathes not love, but sleep-a sleep like death.

A frog, an attendant on the Nymphs, rain-loving, a moist minstrel, delighted with slight leapings,2 did a wayfarer mould in brass, and put up as his vow, on having cured1 his thirst, the most disagreeable in hot weather.
For it showed him, while wandering, the water, by croaking opportunely with its amphibious mouth from a hollow and wet place ;

Croaking minstrel, faithful guide, I reveal'd the hidden tide Of waters, bubbling from the reedy lake, That agony of burning thirst to slake.

Tears for Hecuba and the women of Ilium did the Fates weave, 3 for them born then.
3 But for thee, Dion, who hadst made for thyself a wreath of victory for hon­ ourable deeds, have the deities scattered thy wide1 hopes;
and thou liest in thy extensive native land, honoured by citizens, 0 Dion, thou that hast maddened my mind with love.
Old Hecuba's and Trojan matrons' fears Were interwoven by the Fates with tears;
But thee, with blooming hopes, dear Dion, deckt, Gods did a trophy of their power erect.
Thy honoured relics in thy country rest, Ah ! Dion, whose love rages in my breast.

For Priam's queen and daughters at their birth The Fates weaved tears into the web of life;
But for thee, Dion, in thy hour of mirth, When triumph crown'd thine honourable strife, Thy gathering hopes were pour'd upon the sand.

Thou seest me a shipwrecked person, whom the sea through pity was ashamed to despoil of my last dress.
But a man with fearless hands stript me, taking upon himself for such a gain such an unholy deed;
1 and may he put it on,1 and may it be carried to Hades, and may Minos see him possessing my rag.
The cruel sea, which took my life away, Forbore to strip me of my last array.
From this a covetous man did not refrain, Crime so great acting for so small a gain.
But let him wear it to the shades, and there Before great Pluto in my dress appear.

A shipwrecked mariner you here behold, From whose dead limbs e'en Ocean rude relented To strip the cloak, that did these limbs enfold.

So let him bear away his plunder'd store, And go to hell:
he'll wish the deed undone, When Minos sees him with my tatters on.

When we arrived at a grove in deep shade, we found within the child of Cythera, 2 like, as to his mouth, to ruddy apples.
2 He had neither an arrow-holding quiver, nor a bent bow;
for they were hanging on wide-spread­ ing trees ;
and he was slumbering, fettered by sleep and smiling amongst rose-leaves;
and brown bees above him kept going to his wax-shedding lips 3 for the sake of get­ ting honey.
3Within the covert of a shady grove We saw the little red-cheeked god of love;
He had no bow or quiver;
these among The neighbouring trees upon a bough were hung.
Upon a bank of tender rose-buds laid, He smiling slept;
bees with their noise invade His rest, and on his lips their honey made.
T.
STANLEY,Deep in the bosom of a shady grove, We found, conceal'd, the truant god of love.
The boy was sleeping;
and his smiling face Glowed like ripe peaches with a ruddy grace.
Unarmed he lay;
his bow and quiver hung Upon the leafy boughs of trees;
among Roses fresh blown his little head reposed, And round his laughing lips, that, half unclosed, Invited kisses ;
dropping from on high, A swarm of golden bees began to ply Their busy task ;
as if no hive could prove So fit for honey as the mouth of Love.
K.
To a thick wood we came;
and there we found Young Love, as ruddy apples fair to see, And fast in slumber's softest shackles bound.
Nor bow nor quiver full of shafts had he;
For they were hanging on the green-wood tree.
The boy himself, with rose-leaves cradled round, Lay smiling, as he slept, with half-closed lip, Whose juice nectareous oft the brown bee stooped to sip.

2Sweet Vine, when howls the wintry hour, Not now thy leafy honours shower, Nor strew them on the thankless plain ;
Soon autumn will come round again.

Thus Beauty should be crown'd with joy.

Then let us hence, Miletus dear, sweet native land, farewell;
Th' insulting wrongs of lawless Gauls we fear, whilst here we dwell.
Three virgins of Milesian race, to this dire fate compell'd By Celtic Mars ;

(I went) 1 above the wealthy people of the distant Hyperboreans, with whom once upon a time Perseus, 2 the king and hero,2 feasted.
There dwell the Massa­ getæ the mounters upon swift horses, trusting to their far-shooting bows;
and I came round the divine river of the ever-flowing Campasus, that rolls its sacred water to the eternal sea.
From thence I went round the islands darkened with green olive 3 trees, and overspread with tall-leaved reeds, and I fancied the giant people to be a race of half-dogs ;
who nourished above their well- turned shoulders the head of a dog, grisly, with very powerful fangs;
and theirs was the howl, as it were of dogs;
nor did they know 4 the voice of other men, 5 that call things by their name.
5I reached the distant Hyperborean state- The wealthy race, at whose high banquet sate Perseus the hero.
On those wide-stretch'd plains Ride the Massagetæ, giving the reins To their fleet coursers, skilful with the bow And then I came to the stupendous flow Of Campasus, who pours his mighty tide To the ocean sea, eternally supplied.
Thence to isles clad with olives green and young, With many a tufted bulrush overhung.
A giant race, half-man, half-dog, lives there;
Beneath their shoulders grow the heads they wear, Jaws long and lank and grisly tusks they bear;
Much foreign tongues they learn, and can indite, But when they strive to speak they bark outright.

Curl, ye sweet flowers ;

The Muses themselves1 beheld thee, Hesiod, tending sheep in mid-day on old mountains, and all of them, after plucking with their hands3 a branch with its beau­ tiful flower of the holy laurel, handed it to thee;
and they gave thee the inspiring water of the fountain of Helicon, which the heel of the winged steed had previ­ ously struck ;
with which, when thou wert satisfied, thou didst write in songs of the race of the blessed (gods),5 and of works of husbandry,6 and of the family of the ancient half-gods.
7The Muses, Hesiod, on the mountain steep, Themselves at noon thy flocks beheld thee keep.
The bright-leaved bay they pluck'd, and all the Nine Placed in thy hand at once the branch divine.

0 ye that pass this road, whether ye are going to the country from town, or from the country to the Acropolis, we two deities (are) the guardians of boundaries;
one of whom is Hermes, such as you see me;
the other, Hercules.
Both listen kindly to mortals ;
but if you place here pears, (either) preserved1 or unripe, he gob­ bles them up.
And in like manner he makes ready his " chops for2 grape bunches, whether they are just fit to eat, or unripe of no value.
I dislike a partnership, nor am I pleased at it.
But let a person, who brings any thing for both, put it down, not in common for the two, and say-Take this, Hercules;
and you, Hermes, this-and he will dissolve the quarrel between both.
Wayfarers, who along this road your journey take, Whether amidst the fields a holyday to make, Or town ward bending, to the famed Acropolis, We rival gods, who guard the city's boundaries, I, who am Hermes hight, and th' other Hercules, Bid weary mortals peace, good-will, and lasting bliss.
But for ourselves, alas! nor peace nor joy have we- At least I say so—I, unlucky Mercury.
If any swain brings pears or apples to our shrine, E'en though unripe they be, not one of them is mine.
That glutton bolts them all.
The same too with our grapes;
Not one, or sweet or sour, his greedy maw escapes.
Community of goods I therefore can't abide, Let him, who means me well, my portion set aside;
And say—" This, Hermes, is for thee;
that for thy friend Alcides.
" Thus, at least, our strife may have an end.

The judg­ ment is not about size, but fortune.
To another let there be more for the rudder (to do).
There is one boldness to one vessel, and another to another.
But may I be saved by the gods.
They say that I am small and frail, And cannot live in stormy seas;
It may be so;

Not strength nor size can then hold fast;
But Fortune's favour, Heaven's decree:
Let others trust in oar and mast;
But may the gods take care of me.

and if there be for herbs, penny-royal, or thyme, and wretched groats to serve as a sweet-mixed relish.
Cling to thy home.
If there the meanest shed Yield thee a hearth and shelter for thy head;
And some poor plot, with vegetables stored, Be all that Heaven allots thee for a board- Unsavoury bread, and herbs that scatter'd grow Wild on the river brink or mountain-brow- Yet e'en this cheerless dwelling shall provide More heart's repose than all the world beside.
Not only sitting upon lofty trees do I know how to sing, warmed with the great heat of summer, an unpaid minstrel to wayfaring men, and sipping the vapour of dew, 1that is like woman's milk.
1 But even upon the spear of Athené with her beautiful helmet will you see me, the Tettix, seated.
For as much as we are loved by the Muses, by so much is Athené by us.
For the virgin 2has established a prize (for melody).
2Not only on the tree-top do I sing, When summer heat expands my vocal wing, Sipping the dewy morning's virgin tear, Sweet unbought bard, to weary travellers dear;
But now you may behold me resting here, E'en on the point of armed Minerva's spear.
Who love the Muses, thus each other suit;
Theirs is my voice;
and theirs her maiden flute.

Ye shepherds, who tend goats and fine-fleeced sheep, while walking over this back-bone of a mountain, pay, (I pray,) by the earth, to Cleitagoras a slight but agree­ able tribute, for the sake of Proserpine under ground.
Let the sheep bleat for me;
and let a shepherd on the unpolished rock, pipe gently to them while feeding;
and let a person of the place in earliest spring cut down flowers in the meadow, and adorn my tomb with a gar­ land;
and let him bedew it thrice 1 with milk from an ewe that has fine lambs, by holding her udder full of milk (over it), moistening even the base of my tomb.
There are favours paid to the dead, and there are returns made even by the dead.
List, all ye swains, whose thirsty flocks In silence wander o'er these rocks.
And oh ! let my sad spirit share Your constant love, your tender care.
In parching summer's fervid heat May your young lambs a requiem bleat;
Whilst on the rock the shepherd swain In mournful murmurs swells his strain.
To my lone shade in early spring, Ye pilgrims, grateful offerings bring ;
And o'er my solitary grave With reverence pour the milky wave.
Then rifle every floweret's bloom To deck the turf that forms my tomb.
For think not, that, when life is fled, No hopes or fears can reach the dead ;
E'en then their shades your care approve, And own with gratitude your love.
Thou bee with a varying movement,1 who showest forth the spring blooming with delight, of a brown colour, (and) mad (with love) for the flowers in season, (and) on the wing to (thy) sweet breathing-place, lay on thy work, until thy cell bound by wax is full.
Many-coloured sunshine-loving, spring-betokening bee, Yellow bee, so mad for love of early-blooming flowers, Till thy waxen cell be full, fair fall thy work and thee, Buzzing round the sweetly smelling garden plots and bowers.

whether the first of immortal gods, such as Erebus and queen Night produced of old as their children, under the waves of the wide Ocean, or the son of the very-clever Venus, or of Earth, or of the Winds ;
for being of such a kind thou dost wander about, thinking of evil and good for mankind;
and hence is thy body two-sexed.
Whither shall we go to prove The genealogy of Love ? Shall we call him first created Of the gods from Chaos dated, When Erebus and Night were mated, And their glorious progeny Sprung from out the secret sea ? Or with Venus claim Love's birth ? Or the roving Winds, or Earth ? For his temper varieth so, And the gifts he doth bestow- Like his form, which changeth still, Taking either sex at will- Are now so good, and now so bad, We know not whence his heart he had.

5 For their strength is as fire ;
6 and the highest of the gods knows how to increase (it) 7 amongst those fighting in the front ranks ;
7 8and it were the part of Melistion8 to receive thanks for aid from the people of Schænus as a family honour.
This bow, that erst that earth-born Dragon slew, O mighty god of day, restrain.
Not now those deadly shafts are due That stretch the woodland tyrants of the plain.
Rather, 0 Phœbus, bring thy nobler darts, With which thou piercest gentle hearts;
Bid them Themistio's breast inspire With Love's bright flame, and Valour's holy fire— Pure Valour, firm Heroic Love;
Twin deity, supreme o'er gods above, United in the sacred cause Of his dear native land and freedom's laws.
So let him win the glorious crown His fathers wore, bright meed of fair renown.

I do not, Philotherus, wish to banquet in the city, but in the ploughed field, delighted with the breath of the Zephyr.
A slight1 bed strewn on the ground under my sides is sufficient for me;
for near is the couch of a wil­ low of the country, and the osier, the ancient garland of the Carians.
But let wine be brought and the agree­ able lyre of the Muses, so that, while drinking what cheers the soul, we may sing the renowned bride of Jupiter, the mistress of our island.
2Not in the city be my banquet spread, But in sweet meadows, where around my head The Zephyr may float freely;
be my seat The mossy platform of some green retreat, Where shrubs and creepers, starting at my side, May furnish cushion smooth and carpet wide.
Let wine be served up, and the warbling lyre Trill forth soft numbers of the Muses' choir;
That we still drinking and our hearts contenting, Still to the dulcet tunes new hymns inventing, May sing Jove's bride, from whom these pleasures come, The guardian goddess of our island home.

1 Wine is to the agreeable bard a rapid steed ;
1 but he, who drinks water, will bring forth nothing wise.
So said, 0 Dionysus, and breathed Cratinus, the man not of one skin (of wine), but who smelt of a whole cask.
2Hence did his whole2 house bloom with garlands, and he had his forehead adorned, like you, with the yellow bud of the ivy.
" Wine is the Pegasus, whose wings The pleasant poet plies;
But he, who drinks pure element, Is pleasant in no wise.
" Thus sang Cratinus, reeking with The perfume of the cask;
When he had tried to his content The strength of every flask.
And as he sate, his mansion walls, Festoon'd from side to side, His temples ivy-garlanded, With purple Bacchus vied.

For wine is the horse of Parnassus, Which hurries a bard to the skies.
O Sardis, the ancient dwelling of my ancestors, had I been brought up in thee, I should have been an handi- craft, or a gold-wearing eunuch, 1 beating the beautiful tambourines.
But now is my name Alcman, 2 and I am at Sparta, with many tripods,3 and I have been taught the Heliconian Muses, who have made me greater than Daskyles4 and Gyges.
Sardis, my ancient father-land, Hadst thou, by Fate's supreme command, My helpless childhood nourished, I must have begg'd my daily bread, Or else, a beardless priest become, Have toss'd Cybelé frantic down.
Now Aleman I am call'd—a name Inscribed in Sparta's lists of fame, Whose many tripods record bear Of solemn wreaths and tripods rare, Achieved in worship at the shrine Of Heliconian maids divine, By whose great aid I'm mounted higher Than Gyges or his wealthy sire.

Half of my soul is still breathing;
but half I know not whether Love or Hades has seized, except that it has disappeared.
Surely it has gone back to some strip­ ling.
And yet I have often denied5 it.
" Do not, youths, receive the run-away.
" Has it not gone to Cephisus ? 6 (Yes.
) For thither it bends its way.
I know that, 1 when it is pelted with stones, 1 and is ill-disposed for love.
Half of my soul yet breathes;
the rest I know not whether Cupid or Hades has possest, 'Tis altogether Vanished.
Among the virgin train Perhaps 'tis straying.
O send the wanderer home again, Or chide its staying.
Perhaps on fair Cephisa's breast 'Tis captive lying.
Of old it sought that haven's rest, When almost dying.

In addition to two1 children previously, a third did a mother place on the funeral fire, and, finding fault with the deity not to be satisfied, she brought forth a fourth source of sorrow, and did not wait for uncertain hopes, but placed the living infant in the fire, saying, I will not bring it up ;
for what profits it ? my breasts labour for Hades.
A grief that has a less trouble 2 is a gain to me.
2Twice had a wretched mother to the tomb Borne the sad produce of her teeming womb.
A third in bitterness of soul she gave, To feed the fierce insatiable grave.
But when a fourth time destined to sustain The heavy load of ill-requited pain, Then, madly desperate of a better fate, The greedy flames she dared anticipate ;
And to their rage her living fruit consigned, Saying, “ No longer shall this bosom find Nurture for those, whom Pluto claims his due ;
If I must mourn, I will not labour too.

Happy is Hemathia, that 5 is ruled over by such a leader.
The mighty bull's capacious hide And horns-the forest's stately pride- Are offer'd, Hercules, to thee, By a kingly votary;
Who with javelin's force arrested The bellowing monster's mad career, Braving the fury of his spear, Beneath Orbelus' heights, where long In verdant pastures unmolested, He ranged his subject herds among.

The children in Ios pained Homer the minstrel of heroes, after having woven the riddle 1 of the Muses ;
and the marine daughters of Nereus anointed him with nectar, and they placed his corpse under a rock on the sea-shore, because he had glorified Thetis and her son, and the conflict of other heroes, and the doings of (Ulysses) the son of Laertes of Ithacus.
Most blessed of islands in the sea is Ios, because, though little, it con­ ceals the star of the Muses and Graces.
The visionary dream of life is o'er ;
The bard of heroes sleep on Ios' shore.
Fair los' sons their lamentations pay, And wake the funeral dirge or solemn lay.
O'er his pale lifeless corse and drooping head, Ambrosial sweets the weeping Nereids shed ;
And on the shore their slumb'ring poet laid, Beneath the towering mountain's peaceful shade.
Nor undeserved their care.
His tuneful tongue Achilles' wrath and Thetis' sorrows sung.
His strains Laertes' son in triumph bore Through woes unnumber'd, to his native shore.
Blest isle of los ! on thy rocky steeps The star of song-the grace of Graces-sleeps.

Not even dead does the old man nourish on his tomb the mild grape-bunch from the vine, but the bramble, and the wild pear, that suffocates, causing the lips of way­ farers to wrinkle up, and the throat to be dry with thirst.
But let a person, as he passes by the monument of Hipponax, pray that the dead may sleep good-tem­ pered.
Thy tomb no purple clusters rise to grace, But thorns and briers choke the fearful place ;
There herbs malign and bitter fruits supply Unwholesome juices to the passer-by.
And as, Hipponax, near thy tomb he goes, Shuddering he turns and prays for thy repose.

The great Acrocorinthus of Achæa, the star of Hellas, and the double shores that run together of the Isthmus, has Lucius destroyed;
and a single rock holds the bones heaped up3 of the dead that were cowed by the spear.
And the Achæans, who destroyed the house of Priam by fire, have the descendants of Æneas deprived unwept of funeral rites.
Achæan Acrocorinth, the bright star Of Hellas, with its narrow Isthmian bound, Lucius overcame, in one enormous mound Piling the dead, conspicuous from afar.
Thus to the Greeks, denying funeral fires, Have great AEneas' later progeny Performed high Jove's retributive decree, And well avenged the city of their sires.

Just as the death-mists on her eyelids fell, In those maternal arms she loved so well.

Alas! alas ! thus grief is made to flow A ceaseless stream-eternity of woe.

Bacchus standing yesterday near my couch, when I had been filled with water unmixed (with wine), spoke thus, " Thou art sleeping the sleep of those, hateful to Venus.
Tell me, thou sober fellow, hast thou heard of Hippolytus ? Have a fear, lest thou sufferest something like (his fate).
" So saying he departed;
and to me from that (day) water has been no longer pleasant.
Bacchus found me yesterday, As at full length stretched I lay, Sated with the crystal tide.

Say, idiot, didst thou never hear Of one Hippolytus ? Beware.

For thou wast the target to a youthful love,1 and against thee alone he directed his bow and not crooked2 far-shooting archery.
At length thy golden hours have wing'd their flight, And drowsy death thine eyelid steepeth;
Thy harp, that whispered through each lingering night, Now mutely in oblivion sleepeth.
She too, for whom that heart profusely shed The purest nectar of its numbers- She, the young spring of thy desires, has fled, And with her blest Anacreon slumbers.
Farewell;

Now on her steps I tread;

The winter with its winds having departed from the sky, the purple period of flower-bearing spring was smiling, and the light-blue earth had arrayed itself in green grass ;

and the meadows, drinking the tender dew of morning, that causes plants to increase, were smiling, as the rose (buds) were opening.
And the shepherd, playing shrilly with his pipe on the moun­ tains, is pleased;
and delighted too the goat-herd with the white kids.
And now mariners are sailing over the wide waves, while the Zephyr is causing the sails to swell out with its harmless breath.
And now persons, in honour of the grape-producing Dionysus, are uttering the Euan cry, decked as to their hair with the bunch­ like flower of the ivy.

the halcyons about waves, the swallows about dwellings, the swan on the banks of a river, and the nightingale in the grove.
Now where the leaves of plants feel a de­ light, and the earth is blooming, and the shepherd is piping, and well-fleeced flocks are gladdened, and marin­ ers are sailing, and Dionysus is dancing, and birds are singing, and bees are in labour-pains, how must not a minstrel too sing sweetly in the spring ?Hush'd is the howl of wintry breezes wild;
The purple hour of youthful spring has smiled ;
A livelier verdure clothes the teeming earth;
Buds press to life, rejoicing in their birth ;
.
The laughing meadows drink the dews of night, And, fresh with opening roses, glad the sight;
In songs the joyous swains responsive vie;
Wild music floats and mountain melody.
Adventurous seamen spread th* embosom'd sail O'er waves light heaving to the western gale.
While village youths their brows with ivy twine, And hail with song the promise of the vine.
In curious cells the bees digest their spoil, When vernal sunshine animates their toil.
And little birds with warblings sweet and clear Salute thee, May, the loveliest of the year.
Thee round the waves the tuneful Halcyons hail, On streams the swan, in woods the nightingale;
Thee, too, the swallows, when from flight they rest, And on man's dwellings fix their clay-built nest.
If earth rejoices, with new verdure gay, And shepherds pipe, and flocks exulting play, And sailors roam, and Bacchus leads his throng, And bees to toil, and bards awake to song;
Shall the glad bard be mute in tuneful spring, A.
nd, warm with love and joy, forget to sing ? BL.
She, who was formerly elated with her splendid form;
she, who shook her plaited curls of hair, and walked proudly;
she, who boasted greatly over my attentions to her, has become wrinkled with old age, and lost her former charms.
Her bosom has gone down;
her eye­ brows have fallen ;
her face has wasted away;
her lips mumble with the talk of an old woman.
Gray hair I call the Nemesis of desire;
for it judges according to law, and comes rather quickly upon haughty women.
She, who but late in beauty's flower was seen, Proud of her auburn curls and noble mien- Who froze my hopes and triumphed in my fears, Now sheds her graces in the waste of years.
Changed to unlovely is that breast of snow, And dimm'd her eye, and wrinkled is her brow;
And querulous the voice by time repressed, Whose artless music stole me from my rest.
Age gives redress to love;
and silvery hair And earlier wrinkles brand the haughty fair.

Of Nicostratus, another Aristotle, (and) equal to Plato, the talker of the quibbles of wisdom most high, a person made this inquiry on the subject of the soul:
" How may one say of the soul, that it is mortal, or, on the other hand, immortal ? and must we call it body, or without body? and must it be ranked amongst things to be grasped by the mind, or laid hold materially ? or is it both together ? " When he had read over the books of Aristotle on things Sublime, and his work on the Soul, and, after poring over the sublimity of Plato in the Phædo, had meditated upon the whole truth and on every side, then wrapping his cloak round and stroking down his beard to the tips, he put forth his solution (of the inquiry).
“ If there be to the soul! wholly a na­ ture—for I really do not know-it is altogether mortal or immortal, of a solid substance, or immaterial.
But when you shall have passed over Acheron, you will know the truth there, as Plato does.
Or if you like, imitate Cleombrotus the Ambraciote, and from the roof release your body (from life);
and then you will know yourself, as being separated from the body, having left behind you that alone which you are seeking.
Nicostratus, that second Stagirite, Who sits, like Plato, perch'd on wisdom's height, A simple scholar thus address'd one day:
" What is the soul, thou sage illumined, say- Mortal or deathless ? substance or mere shade ? Of reasoning sense, or naked feeling made ? Or both alike ? Resolve my doubts," he said.
The sage his book of Meteors 'gan unroll, And Aristotle's treatise on the Soul, And Plato's Phædon to its source explored, Where truth from heaven's eternal fount is pour'd.
Then waved his wand-applied it to his chin- And utter'd thus the oracle within:
" If all the world be soul-and if 'tis so Or not, I must confess, I do not know- But if, I say, all nature spirit be, It must be mortal, or from death be free;
Must be substantial;
or, if not, mere shade;
Of reasoning sense, or naked feeling made, Or both or neither.
But, my friend," he said, " If more you wish to learn, to Hades go, And there, as much as Plato, soon you'll know.
Or, if you choose, ascend the rampart's height, Mimic Cleombrotus, and plunge to night.
I Quit this encumbering vest of moistened clay;
And then return, and teach me, as you may.

Bearing a ghost-like body, (and) kindred2 to the in­ visible air, do not be so bold as to approach any one, lest, while he inspires, he takes you into his nostrils, you, who are much lighter than a breath of air.
You canno4 fear death.
For there again without any change you will be in the same manner the ghost you were formerly.
So shadow-like a form you bear, So near allied to shapeless air, That with some reason you may fear, When you salute, to draw too near, Lest, if your friend be short of breath, The dire approach may prove your death;
And that poor form, so light and thin, Be at his nostrils taken in.
Yet, if with philosophic eye You look, you need not fear to die;
For, if poetic tales be true, No transformation waits for you.
You cannot, e'en at Pluto's bar, Be more a phantom than you are.

Day-break had gone by, Chrysilla, and long since the cock in the east had been heralding and bringing on the envious Aurora.
Mayest thou perish, most envious of birds, who drivest me from home to many 1 conversations with youths.

For why hast thou driven away so early from bed thy partner Aurora ?Oh ! hateful bird of morn, whose harsh alarms Drive me thus early from Chrysilla's arms, Forced from th' embrace, so newly tried, to fly With bitter soul to cursed society.

No more his veins in ruddy currents flow.
How cold his sense-his withered heart how dead- Who drives so soon a goddess from his bed! J.

“ Let a man practise (the art) which he has learnt.

Through a wintry night, while avoiding a sweeping storm of hail and snow, and a piercing frost, a solitary lion, already suffering as to his contracted3 limbs, came to the hut of goat-herds,4 that love high grounds.
But they, taking no care of the goats, but of themselves, sat calling upon Jove the saviour.
But the wild beast, after remaining during the storm through the night, and in­ juring none of the men or cattle, went away, having made use of the hut.
And they1 placed up by this oak with strong roots this well-painted picture of the event to Jove,2 who is on the hill-top.
In a dark winter's night, while all around The furious hail-storm clatters on the ground, And every field is deep in drifted snow, And Boreas bids his bitterest tempests blow, A solitary lion, gaunt and grim, Ravenous with cold and numbed in every limb, Stalks to a goat-herd's miserable shed, From the rude air to shield his storm-beat head.
The astonished dwellers in the lowly spot With cries of stifled horror fill the cot;
No more the numerous herds demand their care;
'Tis for themselves they pour the earnest prayer;
And call on Jove the saviour, as they stand Together press'd, a pale and shuddering band.
Meanwhile the lordly savage, safe and warm, Stays through the pelting of the wintry storm;
Then calmly quits the whole affrighted horde, And leaves their meal untouch'd upon the board.

This is not love, if a person desires to possess her, who has a lovely form, through being persuaded by his intelligent eyes ;
but if, 1 on seeing an ugly one, i'he is carried away by the goad of passion, and inflamed by a maddened mind.
This is love;
this a flame.
For beau­ tiful objects delight equally all those, who know how to judge of form.
Call it not a test of love If sun-like beauty lights the flame;
Beauty every heart can move, It delights the gods above, And is to all the same.
But if thy fond doting eye Has taught thy heart a different creed If for wrinkled age you sigh, Or adore deformity, Then love you must indeed.

For me thy wrinkles have more charms, Dear Lydia, than a smoother face;

Yesterday did Hermonassa pour from a jug water upon me, while, after revels that love wine unmixed, I was weaving garlands around the doors of her dwelling ;
and she spoilt my hair, which with difficulty I plaited again on the third twilight.
And yet I was inflamed still more by the water;
for the jug had derived from her sweet lips a secret fire.
The voice of the song and the banquet was o'er, And I hung up my chaplet at Glycera's door, When the mischievous girl from a window above, Who looked down and laugh'd at the off'ring of love, Fill'd with water a goblet whence Bacchus had fled, And pour'd all the crystal contents on my head.
So drench’d was my hair, three whole days it.

*Philinnium is little and a brunette;
but with hair more curly than parsley, and with a skin softer than down;
and in speaking has more of magical power than the cestus (of Venus), and grants me every favour, and is frequently sparing in asking for any thing.
Such a Philinnium may I love until I find another, 0 golden Venus, more perfect.
My Helen is little and brown ;
but more tender Than the cygnet's soft down or the plumage of doves ;
And her form, like the ivy, is graceful and slender, Like the ivy entwined round the tree that it loves.
Her voice—not thy cestus, 0 goddess of pleasure, Can so melt with desire, or with ecstasy burn ;
Her kindness unbounded, she gives without measure To her languishing lover, and asks no return.
Such a girl is my Helen—then never, ah ! never, Let my amorous heart, mighty Venus, forget her ;
Oh grant me to keep my sweet mistress for ever- For ever:
